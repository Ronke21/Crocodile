<text>Charles VII (22 February 1403 – 22 July 1461), called the Victorious () or the Well-Served (), was King of France from 1422 to his death in 1461. His reign saw the end of the Hundred Years&#x27; War and a &quot;de facto&quot; end of the English claims to the French throne.

During the Hundred Years&#x27; War, Charles VII inherited the throne of France under desperate circumstances. Forces of the Kingdom of England and the duke of Burgundy occupied Guyenne and northern France, including Paris, the capital and most populous city, and Reims, the city in which French kings were traditionally crowned. In addition, his father, Charles VI, had disinherited him in 1420 and recognized Henry V of England and his heirs as the legitimate successors to the French crown. At the same time, a civil war raged in France between the Armagnacs (supporters of the House of Valois) and the Burgundian party (supporters of the House of Valois-Burgundy, which was allied to the English).

With his court removed to Bourges, south of the Loire river, Charles was disparagingly called the &quot;King of Bourges&quot;, because the area around this city was one of the few remaining regions left to him. However, his political and military position improved dramatically with the emergence of Joan of Arc as a spiritual leader in France. Joan and Jean de Dunois led French troops to lift the sieges of Orléans and other strategic cities on the Loire river, and to crush the English at the Battle of Patay. With the local English troops dispersed, the people of Reims switched allegiance and opened their gates, which enabled Charles VII to be crowned at Reims Cathedral in 1429. Six years later, he ended the English-Burgundian alliance by signing the Treaty of Arras with Burgundy, followed by the recovery of Paris in 1436 and the steady reconquest of Normandy in the 1440s using a newly organized professional army and advanced siege cannons. Following the Battle of Castillon in 1453, the French expelled the English from all their continental possessions except the Pale of Calais.

The last years of Charles VII were marked by conflicts with his turbulent son, the future Louis XI.

==Early life==
Born at the &quot;Hôtel Saint-Pol&quot;, the royal residence in Paris, Charles was given the title of Count of Ponthieu six months after his birth in 1403. He was the eleventh child and fifth son of Charles VI of France and Isabeau of Bavaria. His four elder brothers, Charles (1386), Charles (1392–1401), Louis (1397–1415) and John (1398–1417) had each held the title of Dauphin of France as heirs apparent to the French throne in turn. All died childless, leaving Charles with a rich inheritance of titles.

==Dauphin==

Almost immediately after becoming dauphin, Charles had to face threats to his inheritance, and he was forced to flee from Paris on 29 May 1418 after the partisans of John the Fearless, Duke of Burgundy, had entered the city the previous night. By 1419, Charles had established his own court in Bourges and a Parlement in Poitiers. On 11 July of that same year, Charles and John the Fearless attempted a reconciliation on a small bridge near Pouilly-le-Fort, not far from Melun where Charles was staying. They signed the Treaty of Pouilly-le-Fort in which they would share authority of the government, assist each other and not to form any treaties without the other&#x27;s consent. Charles and John also decided that a further meeting should take place the following 10 September. On that date, they met on the bridge at Montereau. The Duke assumed that the meeting would be entirely peaceful and diplomatic; thus, he brought only a small escort with him. The Dauphin&#x27;s men reacted to the Duke&#x27;s arrival by attacking and killing him. Charles&#x27;s level of involvement has remained uncertain to this day. Although he claimed to have been unaware of his men&#x27;s intentions, this was considered unlikely by those who heard of the murder. The assassination marked the end of any attempt of a reconciliation between the Armagnac and Burgundian factions, thus playing into the hands of Henry V of England. Charles was later required by a treaty with Philip the Good, the son of John the Fearless, to pay penance for the murder, which he never did.

==Treaty of Troyes (1420)==
At the death of Charles&#x27; father Charles VI in October 1422, the succession was cast into doubt. Under the Treaty of Troyes, signed by Charles VI on 21 May 1420, the throne would pass to Henry V or his heir. Henry had died in July 1422: his heir was the infant King Henry VI of England, son of Henry and Charles VI&#x27;s daughter Catherine of Valois. However, Frenchmen loyal to the Valois regarded the treaty as invalid on grounds of coercion and Charles VI&#x27;s diminished mental capacity. Those who did not recognize the treaty and believed the Dauphin Charles to be of legitimate birth considered him the rightful heir to the throne. Those who considered Charles illegitimate recognized as the rightful heir Charles, Duke of Orléans, cousin of the Dauphin, who was in English captivity. Only the supporters of Henry VI and the Dauphin Charles were able to enlist sufficient military force to press effectively for their candidates. The English, already in control of northern France, enforced Henry&#x27;s claim in the regions of France that they occupied. Northern France, including Paris, was thus ruled by an English regent, Henry V&#x27;s brother, John of Lancaster, Duke of Bedford, based in Normandy (see Dual monarchy of England and France).

==King of Bourges==
In his adolescent years, Charles was noted for his bravery and flamboyant style of leadership. At one point after becoming Dauphin, he led an army against the English dressed in the red, white, and blue that represented his family; his heraldic device was a mailed fist clutching a naked sword. On 25 June 1421, he took Gallardon and executed, as traitors, the garrison, and by the end of June Charles had invested Chartres. He then went south of the Loire River under the protection of Yolande of Aragon, known as &quot;Queen of the Four Kingdoms&quot; and, on 18 December 1422, married her daughter, Marie of Anjou, to whom he had been engaged since December 1413 in a ceremony at the Louvre Palace.

Charles claimed the title King of France for himself, but failed to make any attempts to expel the English from northern France out of indecision and a sense of hopelessness. Instead, he remained south of the Loire River, where he was still able to exert power, and maintained an itinerant court in the Loire Valley at castles such as Chinon. He was still customarily known as the &quot;Dauphin&quot;, or derisively as the &quot;King of Bourges&quot;, after the town where he generally lived. Periodically, he considered flight to the Iberian Peninsula, which would have allowed the English to advance their occupation of France.

===Siege of Orléans===
Political conditions in France took a decisive turn in the year 1429 just as the prospects for the Dauphin began to look hopeless. The town of Orléans had been under siege since October 1428. The English regent, the Duke of Bedford (the uncle of Henry VI), was advancing into the Duchy of Bar, ruled by Charles&#x27;s brother-in-law, René. The French lords and soldiers loyal to Charles were becoming increasingly desperate. Then in the little village of Domrémy, on the border of Lorraine and Champagne, a teenage girl named Joan of Arc (), demanded that the garrison commander at Vaucouleurs, Robert de Baudricourt, collect the soldiers and resources necessary to bring her to the Dauphin at Chinon, stating that visions of angels and saints had given her a divine mission. Granted an escort of five veteran soldiers and a letter of referral to Charles by Lord Baudricourt, Joan rode to see Charles at Chinon. She arrived on 23 February 1429.

Second-hand testimony by witnesses who were not present when Joan and the Dauphin met state Charles wanted to test her claim to be able to recognise him despite never having seen him, and so he disguised himself as one of his courtiers. He stood in their midst when Joan entered the chamber in which the court was assembled. Joan identified Charles immediately. She bowed low to him and embraced his knees, declaring &quot;God give you a happy life, sweet King!&quot; Despite attempts to claim that another man was in fact the king, thereafter Joan referred to him as &quot;Dauphin&quot; or &quot;Noble Dauphin&quot; until he was crowned in Reims four months later. After a private conversation between the two, Charles became inspired and filled with confidence.

After her encounter with Charles in March 1429, Joan of Arc set out to lead the French forces at Orléans. She was aided by skilled commanders such as Étienne de Vignolles, known as La Hire, and Jean Poton de Xaintrailles. They compelled the English to lift the siege on 8 May 1429, thus turning the tide of the war. The French won the Battle of Patay on 18 June, at which the English field army lost about half its troops. After pushing further into English and Burgundian-controlled territory, Charles was crowned King Charles VII of France in Reims Cathedral on 17 July 1429.

Joan was later captured by Burgundian troops under John of Luxembourg at the Siege of Compiègne on 24 May 1430. The Burgundians handed her over to their English allies. Tried for heresy by a court composed of pro-English clergy such as Pierre Cauchon, who had long served the English occupation government, she was burned at the stake on 30 May 1431.

==French victory==

Nearly as important as Joan of Arc in the cause of Charles was the support of the powerful and wealthy family of his wife Marie d&#x27;Anjou, particularly his mother-in-law, Queen Yolande of Aragon. But whatever affection he may have had for his wife, or whatever gratitude he may have felt for the support of her family, the great love of Charles VII&#x27;s life was his mistress, Agnès Sorel.

Charles VII and Philip the Good, Duke of Burgundy, then signed the 1435 Treaty of Arras, by which the Burgundian faction rejected their English alliance and became reconciled with Charles VII, just as things were going badly for their English allies. With this accomplishment, Charles attained the essential goal of ensuring that no Prince of the Blood recognised Henry VI as King of France.

Over the following two decades, the French recaptured Paris from the English and eventually recovered all of France with the exception of the northern port of Calais.

==Close of reign==

Charles&#x27;s later years were marked by hostile relations with his heir, Louis, who demanded real power to accompany his position as the Dauphin. Charles consistently refused him. Accordingly, Louis stirred up dissent and fomented plots in attempts to destabilise his father&#x27;s reign. He quarrelled with his father&#x27;s mistress, Agnès Sorel, and on one occasion drove her with a bared sword into Charles&#x27; bed, according to one source. Eventually, in 1446, after Charles&#x27;s last son, also named Charles, was born, the king banished the Dauphin to the Dauphiné. The two never met again. Louis thereafter refused the king&#x27;s demands to return to court, and he eventually fled to the protection of Philip the Good, Duke of Burgundy, in 1456.

In 1458, Charles became ill. A sore on his leg (an early symptom, perhaps, of diabetes or another condition) refused to heal, and the infection in it caused a serious fever. The king summoned Louis to him from his exile in Burgundy, but the Dauphin refused to come. He employed astrologers to foretell the exact hour of his father&#x27;s death. The king lingered on for the next two and a half years, increasingly ill, but unwilling to die. During this time he also had to deal with the case of his rebellious vassal John V of Armagnac.

Finally, however, there came a point in July 1461 when the king&#x27;s physicians concluded that Charles would not live past August. Ill and weary, the king became delirious, convinced that he was surrounded by traitors loyal only to his son. Under the pressure of sickness and fever, he went mad. By now another infection in his jaw had caused an abscess in his mouth. The swelling caused by this became so large that, for the last week of his life, Charles was unable to swallow food or water. Although he asked the Dauphin to come to his deathbed, Louis refused, instead waiting at Avesnes, in Burgundy, for his father to die. At Mehun-sur-Yèvre, attended by his younger son, Charles, and aware of his elder son&#x27;s final betrayal, the King starved to death. He died on 22 July 1461, and was buried, at his request, beside his parents in Saint-Denis.

==Legacy==

Although Charles VII&#x27;s legacy is far overshadowed by the deeds and eventual martyrdom of Joan of Arc and his early reign was at times marked by indecisiveness and inaction, he was responsible for successes unprecedented in the history of the Kingdom of France. He succeeded in what four generations of his predecessors (namely his father Charles VI, his grandfather Charles V, his great-grandfather John II and great-great grandfather Philip VI) failed to do – the expulsion of the English and the conclusion of the Hundred Years&#x27; War.

Charles created France&#x27;s first standing army since Roman times. In &quot;The Prince&quot;, Niccolò Machiavelli asserts that if his son Louis XI had continued this policy, then the French would have become invincible.

Charles VII secured himself against papal power by the Pragmatic Sanction of Bourges. He also established the University of Poitiers in 1432, and his policies brought some economic prosperity to his subjects.

==Family==

===Children===
Charles married his second cousin Marie of Anjou on 18 December 1422. They were both great-grandchildren of King John II of France and his first wife Bonne of Bohemia through the male line. They had fourteen children:
===Mistresses===
* Agnès Sorel, by whom he had three illegitimate daughters:
** Marie, possibly born the summer of 1444.
** Charlotte, m. Jacques de Brézé (their son, Louis de Brézé, seigneur d&#x27;Anet, in turn married Diane de Poitiers, herself ultimately a famous royal mistress). 
** Jeanne.
* Antoinette de Maignelais, cousin of Agnès Sorel.

<text>A chocolate chip cookie is a drop cookie that features chocolate chips or chocolate morsels as its distinguishing ingredient. Chocolate chip cookies are claimed to have originated in the United States in 1938, when Ruth Graves Wakefield chopped up a Nestlé semi-sweet chocolate bar and added the chopped chocolate to a cookie recipe; however, historical recipes for grated or chopped chocolate cookies exist prior to 1938 by various other authors.

Generally, the recipe starts with a dough composed of flour, butter, both brown and white sugar, semi-sweet chocolate chips, eggs, and vanilla. Variations on the recipe may add other types of chocolate, as well as additional ingredients such as nuts or oatmeal. There are also vegan versions with the necessary ingredient substitutions, such as vegan chocolate chips, vegan margarine, and egg substitutes. A &quot;chocolate chocolate chip cookie&quot; uses a dough flavored with chocolate or cocoa powder, before chocolate chips are mixed in. These variations of the recipe are also referred to as ‘&quot;double&quot;’ or ‘&quot;triple&quot;’ chocolate chip cookies, depending on the combination of dough and chocolate types.

==History==

===Toll House cookie===
The most notable chocolate chip cookie recipe was invented by American chef Ruth Graves Wakefield in 1938. She invented the recipe during the period when she owned the Toll House Inn, in Whitman, Massachusetts. In this era, the Toll House Inn was a popular restaurant that featured home cooking. A myth holds that she accidentally developed the cookie, and that she expected the chocolate chunks would melt, making chocolate cookies. That is not the case; Wakefield stated that she deliberately invented the cookie. She said, &quot;We had been serving a thin butterscotch nut cookie with ice cream. Everybody seemed to love it, but I was trying to give them something different. So I came up with Toll House cookie.&quot; She added chopped up bits from a Nestlé semi-sweet chocolate bar into a cookie. The original recipe in &quot;Toll House Tried and True Recipes&quot; is called &quot;Toll House Chocolate Crunch Cookies&quot;. Wakefield gave Nestle the recipe for her cookies and was paid with a lifetime supply of chocolate from the company.

===Later history===
Wakefield&#x27;s cookbook, &quot;Toll House Tried and True Recipes&quot;, was first published in 1936 by M. Barrows &amp; Company, New York. The 1938 edition of the cookbook was the first to include the recipe &quot;Toll House Chocolate Crunch Cookie&quot; which rapidly became a favorite cookie in American homes.

During World War II, soldiers from Massachusetts who were stationed overseas shared the cookies they received in care packages from home with soldiers from other parts of the United States. Hundreds of soldiers wrote home asking their families to send them Toll House cookies, and Wakefield received letters from around the world requesting her recipe, helping spread their popularity beyond the east coast. Chocolate chip cookies were first sold in the UK in 1956 by Maryland Cookies.

===Original recipe===
Sue Brides, a baker who worked with Ruth Graves Wakefield at the Toll House Inn, passed down the original recipe to her daughter, Peg, who shared it in a 2017 interview:

* cups (350 mL) shortening
* cups (265 mL) sugar
* cups (265 mL) brown sugar
* 3 eggs
* teaspoon (7.5 g) salt
* cups (750 mL) of flour
* teaspoon (7.5 g) hot water
* teaspoon (7.5 g) baking soda
* teaspoon (7.5 g) vanilla
* chocolate chips (The &quot;Tried and True Recipes&quot; cookbook specifies &quot;2 bars (7 oz.) Nestlé&#x27;s yellow label chocolate, semi-sweet, which has been cut in pieces the size of a pea.&quot;).

==Composition and variants==

Chocolate chip cookies are commonly made with white sugar; brown sugar; flour; salt; eggs; a leavening agent such as baking soda; a fat, typically butter or shortening; vanilla extract; and chocolate pieces. Some recipes also include milk or nuts (such as chopped walnuts) in the dough.

Depending on the ratio of ingredients and mixing and cooking times, some recipes produce a soft, chewy cookie while others will produce a crunchy, crispy cookie. Regardless of ingredients, the procedure for making the cookie is fairly consistent in all recipes: First, the sugars and fat are creamed, usually with a wooden spoon or electric mixer. Next, the eggs and vanilla extract are added followed by the flour and leavening agent. Depending on the additional flavoring, its addition to the mix will be determined by the type used: peanut butter will be added with the wet ingredients while cocoa powder would be added with the dry ingredients. The titular ingredient, chocolate chips, as well as nuts are typically mixed in towards the end of the process to minimize breakage, just before the cookies are scooped and positioned on a cookie sheet. Most cookie dough is baked, although some eat the dough as is, or use it as an addition to vanilla ice cream to make chocolate chip cookie dough ice cream.

The texture of a chocolate chip cookie is largely dependent on its fat composition and the type of fat used. A study done by Kansas State University showed that carbohydrate-based fat substitutes tend to bind more water, leaving less water available to aid in the spread of the cookie while baking and resulting in softer, cakelike cookies with less spread.

===Common variations===
* The &quot;M&amp;M party cookie&quot; is baked with M&amp;M&#x27;s instead of chocolate chips.
* The &quot;chocolate chocolate chip&quot; or &quot;double chocolate&quot; cookie uses a dough that is chocolate-flavored by the addition of cocoa or melted chocolate. Variations on this cookie include replacing chocolate chips with white chocolate or peanut butter chips.
* The &quot;macadamia chip cookie&quot; has macadamia nuts and white chocolate chips.
* The &quot;chocolate chip peanut butter cookie&quot; replaces the vanilla-flavored dough with a peanut butter-flavored one.
* Chocolate chip cookie dough baked in a baking dish instead of a cookie sheet results in a &quot;chocolate chip bar cookie&quot;, also known as &quot;congo bars&quot; or &quot;blondies&quot;.
* Other variations include different sizes and shapes of chocolate chips, as well as dark or milk chocolate chips. These changes lead to differences in both flavor and texture.

===Marketing===

There are at least three national (U.S./North America) chains that sell freshly baked chocolate chip cookies in shopping malls and standalone retail locations. Several businesses—including Doubletree hotels—offer freshly baked cookies to their patrons to differentiate themselves from their competition.

To honor the cookie&#x27;s creation in the state, on July 9, 1997, Massachusetts designated the chocolate chip cookie as the Official State Cookie, after it was proposed by a third-grade class from Somerset, Massachusetts.

<doc id="76741" wikidata="Q5589197" url="?curid=76741" title="Government of Colombia">
<text>The Government of Colombia is a republic with separation of powers into executive, judicial and legislative branches. 
Its legislature has a congress,
its judiciary has a supreme court, and
its executive branch has a president.
The citizens of Colombia cast votes concerning their government, and they employ a &quot;public&quot; sector office for an inspector general to oversee the public interface of the government. This safeguards the public, and guarantees the human rights spelled out in the &quot;Constitution of 1991&quot;, which provides the framework for a welfare state and a unitary republic.

Colombia has &quot;control institutions&quot; that mix government and public officials, who work alongside one another. For example, the public&#x27;s inspector general works closely with the government&#x27;s controller general, whose job it is to ensure governmental fiscal responsibility. An independent Ombudsman deals with maladministration complaints and functions.

==Executive==

The executive branch of power in Colombia is headed by the President of the Republic. He is supported by the Vice President of Colombia, the Council of Ministers and Government entities of Colombia| Administrative Departments of Colombia. The government is in charge of creating and developing policies concerning Colombia, while the governors of the Departments of Colombia are elected by popular vote to represent the president and the executive branch of government. 
Mayors are subordinated to the governors, who are the maximum representatives of the executive branch of government at a municipal level. Mayors are also elected in regional elections, along with the department governors.

In 2015, Colombia&#x27;s Congress limited presidency to single term, preventing the president from seeking re-election.

In Colombia, reelections are not allowed, but they are given the four full years. In those four years, the president is head of the state and head of the government. The president is also commander-in-chief of armed forces and supreme administrative authority.

==Legislative==
The legislative branch is the branch that makes laws. Representatives are elected by the people and support their thoughts in government. The legislative branch is divided into two branches: the Senate and the House of Representatives. The Senate consists of 114 members whereas the House of Representatives consists of 199 members. Despite being broken up into two branches, they must work together to make sure that they take control of their responsibilities.

==Judiciary==

The judiciary of Colombia (Spanish: Rama Judicial de Colombia) is a branch of the State of Colombia that interprets and applies the laws of Colombia, to ensure equal justice under law, and to provide a mechanism for dispute resolution. The judiciary comprises a hierarchical system of courts presided over by judges, magistrates and other adjudicators.

Colombia is a centralized state, thus there is only one jurisdiction (with the exception of special indigenous jurisdictions), which is functionally divided by subject matter into an ordinary, penal, administrative, disciplinary, constitutional and special jurisdictions (military, peace, and indigenous matters).

<doc id="76746" wikidata="Q565155" url="?curid=76746" title="Osborne House">
<text>Osborne House is a former royal residence in East Cowes, Isle of Wight, United Kingdom. The house was built between 1845 and 1851 for Queen Victoria and Prince Albert as a summer home and rural retreat. Albert designed the house in the style of an Italian Renaissance palazzo. The builder was Thomas Cubitt, the London architect and builder whose company built the main facade of Buckingham Palace for the royal couple in 1847. An earlier smaller house on the Osborne site was demolished to make way for the new and far larger house, though the original entrance portico survives as the main gateway to the walled garden.

Queen Victoria died at Osborne House on 22 January 1901, aged 81. Following her death, King Edward VII, who had never liked Osborne, presented the house to the state on the day of his coronation, with the royal pavilion being retained as a private museum to Victoria. From 1903 to 1921, part of the estate around the stables was used as a junior officer training college for the Royal Navy, known as the Royal Naval College, Osborne. Another section of the house was used as a convalescent home for officers. In 1933, many of the temporary buildings at Osborne were demolished. In 1954, Queen Elizabeth II gave permission for the first floor rooms (the private apartments) in the royal pavilion to be opened to the public. In 1986, English Heritage assumed management of Osborne House. In 1989, the second floor of the house was also opened to the public.

The house is listed Grade I on the National Heritage List for England, and the landscaped park and gardens are listed Grade II* on the Register of Historic Parks and Gardens.

== History ==

=== Royal retreat ===
Queen Victoria and Prince Albert bought Osborne House on the Isle of Wight from Lady Isabella Blachford in October 1845. They wanted a home removed from the stresses of court life. Victoria had spent two holidays on the Isle of Wight as a young girl, when her mother, the Duchess of Kent, rented Norris Castle, the estate adjacent to Osborne. The setting of the three-storey Georgian house appealed to Victoria and Albert, in particular, the views of the Solent reminding Albert of the Bay of Naples in Italy. They soon realised that the house was too small for their needs and decided to replace the house with a new, larger residence.

The new Osborne House was built between 1845 and 1851 in the Italian Renaissance style, complete with two belvedere towers. Prince Albert designed the house himself in conjunction with Thomas Cubitt, the London architect and builder, whose company also built the main façade of Buckingham Palace. The couple paid for much of the furnishing of the new house from the sale of the Royal Pavilion at Brighton. The Prince Consort participated directly in laying out the estate, gardens and woodlands, to prove his knowledge of forestry and landscaping. At the more official royal residences, he had been overruled by the Commissioners of Woods and Forests, who had official responsibilities for the grounds. Below the gardens on Osborne Bay was a private beach, where the Queen kept her own private bathing machine. According to a news report: &quot;The queen&#x27;s bathing machine was unusually ornate, with a front veranda and curtains which would conceal her until she had entered the water. The interior had a changing room and a plumbed-in WC.&quot;

The original square wing of the house was known as &quot;The Pavilion&quot;, containing the principal and royal apartments on the ground and first floors, respectively. The principal apartments, particularly, hold reminders of Victoria&#x27;s dynastic links with the other European royal families. The Billiard Room holds a massive porcelain vase that was a gift of the Russian Tsar. The Billiard Room, Queen&#x27;s Dining Room, and the Drawing Room on the ground floor all express grandeur.

In marked contrast is the more homely and unassuming décor of the royal apartments on the first floor. They include the Prince&#x27;s Dressing Room, the Queen&#x27;s Sitting Room, the Queen&#x27;s Bedroom, and the children&#x27;s nurseries. Intended for private, domestic use, the rooms were made as comfortable as possible. Both Queen Victoria and Prince Albert were determined to bring up their children in a natural and loving environment. They allowed the royal children to visit their parents&#x27; bedrooms frequently, at a time when children of aristocrats often lived removed from their parents in nurseries, only joining them occasionally in public rooms, rather than in shared intimate spaces.


The main wing was added later. It contains the household accommodation and council and audience chambers, as well as a suite for Victoria&#x27;s mother. The final addition to the house was a wing, built between 1890 and 1891, designed by John Lockwood Kipling, father of the poet Rudyard Kipling. The ground floor includes the famous Durbar Room, named after an Anglicised version of the Hindi word &quot;durbar,&quot; meaning court. The Durbar Room was built for state functions. It was decorated by Bhai Ram Singh in an elaborate and intricate style, and has a carpet from Agra. It now holds gifts Queen Victoria received on her Golden and Diamond jubilees. They include engraved silver and copper vases, Indian armour, and a model of an Indian palace. The first floor of the new wing was for the sole use of Princess Beatrice and her family. Beatrice was the Queen&#x27;s youngest daughter, and she lived near Victoria during her life.

Osborne House expresses numerous associations with the British Raj and India, housing a collection of paintings of Indian persons and scenes, painted at Queen Victoria&#x27;s request by Rudolf Swoboda. These include depictions of Indians resident or visiting Britain in the 19th century, and scenes painted in India when Swoboda travelled there to create such works.

The royal family stayed at Osborne for lengthy periods each year: in the spring for Victoria&#x27;s birthday in May; in July and August when they celebrated Albert&#x27;s birthday; and just before Christmas. In a break from the past, Queen Victoria and Prince Albert allowed photographers and painters to make works featuring their family in the grounds and in the house. That was partly for their own enjoyment and partly as a form of public relations, to demonstrate to the nation their character as a happy and devoted family. Many thousands of prints of the royal family were sold to the public, which led Victoria to remark, &quot;no Sovereign was ever more loved than I am (I am bold enough to say).&quot; Writing to her daughter Princess Victoria in 1858 about the gloominess of Windsor Castle, Queen Victoria stated, &quot;I long for our cheerful and unpalacelike rooms at Osborne.&quot;

The grounds also included a &quot;Swiss Cottage&quot; for the royal children. The cottage was dismantled and brought piece by piece from Switzerland to Osborne where it was reassembled. There, the royal children were encouraged to garden. Each child was given a rectangular plot in which to grow fruit, vegetables and flowers. They sold their produce to their father. Prince Albert used this as a way to teach the basics of economics. The children also learned to cook in the Swiss Cottage, which was equipped with a fully functioning kitchen. Both parents saw this kind of education as a way of grounding their children in the activities of daily life shared by the people in the kingdom despite their royal status.

In 1859, Prince Albert designed a new and larger quadrangular stable block, which was built by Cubitts on the former cricket pitch. The building is listed Grade II* on the National Heritage List for England. After Prince Albert died at Windsor Castle in December 1861, Queen Victoria continued to visit Osborne House because it was one of her favourite homes. In 1876, as a tribute to Queen Victoria, the Government House in the colony (now State) of Victoria, Australia, was constructed as a copy of Osborne House.

On 14 January 1878, Alexander Graham Bell demonstrated an early version of the telephone to the queen at Osborne House, placing calls to Cowes, Southampton and London. They were the first publicly witnessed long-distance telephone calls in Britain. The queen tried the device and considered the process to be &quot;quite extraordinary&quot; although the sound was &quot;rather faint&quot;. She later asked to buy the equipment that was used, but Bell offered to make &quot;a set of telephones&quot; specifically for her.

=== National gift ===

Queen Victoria died at Osborne on 22 January 1901, with two generations of her family present. Although she adored Osborne, and her will left strict instructions that Osborne was to remain in the family, her children did not share the attachment. Princess Beatrice and Princess Louise were granted houses on the estate. Edward VII presented Osborne to the nation on his Coronation Day in August 1902. The royal apartments on the upper floors of the pavilion wing, including the late Queen&#x27;s bedroom, were turned into a private museum accessible only to the royal family.

=== Later uses ===
==== Royal Naval College, 1903–1921 ====

In 1903, the new stable block became a junior officer training college for the Royal Navy known as the Royal Naval College, Osborne. Initial training began at about the age of 13, and after two years studies were continued at the Royal Naval College, Dartmouth. The college closed in 1921, with the last students leaving on 9 April 1921. Former students of Osborne included Queen Victoria&#x27;s great-grandsons, the future Edward VIII and George VI, and their younger brother George, Duke of Kent. Another well-known alumnus of the college was Jack Llewelyn Davies, one of the five Llewelyn Davies boys who inspired J. M. Barrie&#x27;s Peter Pan. The case of George Archer-Shee from 1908, who was expelled from Osborne after being falsely accused of stealing a 5-shilling postal order, inspired the play &quot;The Winslow Boy&quot;.

==== Military convalescent home ====
During World War I, the secondary wings of Osborne House were used as an officers&#x27; convalescent home. Robert Graves and A. A. Milne were two famous patients. Known as the King Edward VII Retirement Home for Officers, it later accommodated convalescents from military and civil service backgrounds, including retired officers of the British armed services until 2000.

== Thomas Cubitt ==
Thomas Cubitt was one of the most renowned architects of the 19th century, known as &quot;the Emperor of the building trade&quot;.

Prince Albert, impressed with his previous works, commissioned him to rebuild Osborne House. Cubitt and Prince Albert worked hand in hand in constructing and designing the house, creating the mix of Palladian architecture and Italian renaissance style. Cubitt not only designed the structure but also implemented many of his own features into the house from his own workshops. As well as the doors and fireplaces of his own design, he also incorporated his own patterns for the plaster within the house.

The design of Osborne House is stately and intended for royalty, but it is not so grand that it is unwelcoming. Queen Victoria and Prince Albert wanted an escape from the stuffiness of Buckingham Palace; they wanted a home for their children to feel free and welcome. Once Osborne House was complete, they commissioned Cubitt to build the east wing of Buckingham Palace. Victoria admired Cubitt not only for his work on Osborne House but also for his character. She referred to him as &quot;our Cubitt&quot; and on his death said that &quot;a better, kinder-hearted man never breathed&quot;.

== Preservation ==

Since 1986, Osborne House has been under the care of English Heritage. It is open to the public. The house is listed Grade I on the National Heritage List for England, and the landscaped park and gardens are listed Grade II* on the Register of Historic Parks and Gardens.

The former Naval College&#x27;s cricket pavilion was converted into a holiday cottage in 2004. Since 2005, the house has occasionally hosted picnic-style concerts on the lawn outside the main house.

Queen Victoria&#x27;s private beach at Osborne, including her personal bathing machine, was opened to the public for the first time in July 2012, following an extensive restoration programme.

<doc id="76747" wikidata="Q311885" url="?curid=76747" title="Patrick Henry">
<text>Patrick Henry (May 29, 1736 O.S. May 18, 1736]June 6, 1799) was an American politician, planter and orator who declared to the Second Virginia Convention (1775): &quot;Give me liberty or give me death!&quot; A Founding Father, he served as the first and sixth post-colonial governor of Virginia, from 1776 to 1779 and from 1784 to 1786.

A native of Hanover County, Virginia, Henry was primarily educated at home. After an unsuccessful venture running a store, as well as assisting his father-in-law at Hanover Tavern, he became a lawyer through self-study. Beginning his practice in 1760, Henry soon became prominent through his victory in the Parson&#x27;s Cause against the Anglican clergy. He was elected to the Virginia House of Burgesses, where he quickly became notable for his inflammatory rhetoric against the Stamp Act 1765.

In 1774, Henry served as a delegate to the First Continental Congress where he signed the Petition to the King, which he helped to draft, and the Continental Association. He gained further popularity among the people of Virginia, both through his oratory at the convention and by marching troops towards the colonial capital of Williamsburg after the Gunpowder Incident until the munitions seized by the royal government were paid for. Henry urged independence, and when the Fifth Virginia Convention endorsed this in 1776, he served on the committee charged with drafting the Virginia Declaration of Rights and the original Virginia Constitution. Henry was promptly elected governor under the new charter and served a total of five one-year terms.

After leaving the governorship in 1779, Henry served in the Virginia House of Delegates until he began his last two terms as governor in 1784. The actions of the national government under the Articles of Confederation made Henry fear a strong federal government, and he declined appointment as a delegate to the 1787 Constitutional Convention. He actively opposed the ratification of the United States Constitution, both fearing a powerful central government and because there was as yet no Bill of Rights. He returned to the practice of law in his final years, declining several offices under the federal government. A slaveholder throughout his adult life, he hoped to see the institution end but had no plan beyond ending the importation of slaves. Henry is remembered for his oratory and as an enthusiastic promoter of the fight for independence.

==Early life (1736–1759)==
Henry was born on the family farm, Studley, in Hanover County in the Colony of Virginia, on May 29, 1736. His father was John Henry, an immigrant from Aberdeenshire, Scotland, who had attended King&#x27;s College, University of Aberdeen, before emigrating to Virginia in the 1720s. Settling in Hanover County in about 1732, John Henry married Sarah Winston Syme, a wealthy widow from a prominent local family of English ancestry.

Patrick Henry shared his name with his uncle, an Anglican minister, and until the elder Patrick&#x27;s death in 1777 often went as Patrick Henry Jr. Henry attended a local school until about the age of 10. There was no academy in Hanover County, and he was tutored at home by his father. The young Henry engaged in the typical recreations of the times, such as music and dancing, and was particularly fond of hunting. Since the family&#x27;s stock, considerable lands, and slaves would pass to his older half-brother John Syme Jr., due to the custom of primogeniture, Henry needed to make his own way in the world. At age 15, he became a clerk for a local merchant and a year later opened a store with his older brother William. The store was not successful. His sisters were pioneer and writer Annie Henry Christian and Elizabeth Henry Campbell Russell, a Methodist lay leader.

The religious revival known as the Great Awakening reached Virginia when Henry was a child. His father was staunchly Anglican, but his mother often took him to hear Presbyterian preachers. Although Henry remained a lifelong Anglican communicant, ministers such as Samuel Davies taught him that it is not enough to save one&#x27;s own soul, but one should help to save society. He also learned that oratory should reach the heart, not just persuade based on reason. His oratorical technique would follow that of these preachers, seeking to reach the people by speaking to them in their own language.

Religion played a key role in Henry&#x27;s life; his father and namesake uncle were both devout and were both major influences in his life. Nevertheless, he was uncomfortable with the role of the Anglican Church as the established religion in Virginia, and he fought for religious liberty throughout his career. Henry wrote to a group of Baptists who had sent a letter of congratulations following Henry&#x27;s 1776 election as governor, &quot;My earnest wish is, that Christian charity, forbearance and love may unite all different persuasions as brethren.&quot; He criticized his state of Virginia, feeling that slavery and lack of religious toleration had retarded its development. He told the Virginia Ratifying Convention in 1788, &quot;That religion or the duty which we owe to our Creator, and the manner of discharging it, can be directed only by reason and conviction, not by force or violence, and therefore all men have an equal, natural and unalienable right to the free exercise of religion according to the dictates of conscience, and that no particular religious sect or society ought to be favored or established by law in preference to others.&quot;
In 1754, Henry married Sarah Shelton, reportedly in the parlor of her family house, Rural Plains. (It also became known as Shelton House.) As a wedding gift, her father gave the couple six slaves and the Pine Slash Farm near Mechanicsville. Pine Slash was exhausted from earlier cultivations, and Henry worked with the slaves to clear fresh fields. The latter half of the 1750s were years of drought in Virginia, and after the main house burned down, Henry gave up and moved to the Hanover Tavern, owned by Sarah&#x27;s father. 

Henry often served as host at Hanover Tavern as part of his duties and entertained the guests by playing the fiddle. Among those who stayed there during this time was Thomas Jefferson, aged 17, en route to his studies at the College of William &amp; Mary, and who later wrote that he became well acquainted with Henry then, despite their age difference of six years. Jefferson in 1824 told Daniel Webster, &quot;Patrick Henry was originally a bar-keeper&quot;, a characterization that Henry&#x27;s biographers have found to be unfair; that his position was more general than that, and that the main business of Hanover Tavern was serving travelers, not alcohol. William Wirt, Henry&#x27;s earliest biographer, rejects Jefferson&#x27;s suggestion that Henry&#x27;s profession was a bartender but notes it would have been &quot;very natural in Mr. Henry&#x27;s situation&quot; to do what was necessary to ensure that guests were properly seen to.

== Revolutionary lawyer and politician (1760–1775) ==
===Parson&#x27;s Cause (1760–1763)===
While at Hanover Tavern, Henry found time to study the law. How long he did so is unclear; he later said it was as little as a month. On the advice of a local lawyer, Henry in 1760 applied for a lawyer&#x27;s license, appearing before the examiners—prominent attorneys in the colonial capital of Williamsburg. The examiners were impressed by Henry&#x27;s mind even though his knowledge of legal procedures was scant. He passed in April 1760, and he thereafter opened a practice, appearing in the courts of Hanover and nearby counties. Henry became a skilled lawyer because in court &quot;he displayed quick wit, knowledge of human nature, and forensic gifts.&quot;

The droughts of the 1750s had led to a rise in the price of tobacco. Hard currency was scarce in Virginia, and salaries in the colony were often expressed in terms of pounds of tobacco. Prior to the drought, the price of tobacco had long been twopence per pound (0.45 kilograms) and in 1755 and 1758, the Virginia House of Burgesses, the elected lower house of the colonial legislature, passed the Two Penny Act, allowing debts expressed in tobacco to be paid at the rate of twopence per pound for a limited period. These payees included public officials, including Anglican clergy—Anglicanism was Virginia&#x27;s established church—and several ministers petitioned the Board of Trade in London to overrule the Burgesses, which it did. Five clergymen then brought suit for back pay, cases known as the Parson&#x27;s Cause; of them, only the Reverend James Maury was successful, and a jury was to be empaneled in Hanover County on December 1, 1763, to fix damages. Henry was engaged as counsel by Maury&#x27;s parish vestry for this hearing. Patrick Henry&#x27;s father, Colonel John Henry, was the presiding judge.
After the evidence was presented proving the facts at issue, Maury&#x27;s counsel gave a speech in praise of the clergy, many of whom were in attendance. Henry responded with a one-hour speech, ignoring the question of damages, but which focused on the unconstitutionality of the veto of the Two Penny Act by the king&#x27;s government. Henry deemed any king who annulled good laws, such as the Two Penny Act, as a &quot;tyrant&quot; who &quot;forfeits all right to his subjects&#x27; obedience&quot;, and the clergy, by challenging an impartial law designed to bring economic relief, had shown themselves to be &quot;enemies of the community&quot;. The opposing counsel accused Henry of treason, and some took up that cry, but Henry continued, and the judge did nothing to stop him. Henry urged the jury to make an example of Maury, for the benefit of any who might seek to imitate him and suggested the jury return damages of one farthing. The jury was out for only moments and fixed damages at one penny. Henry was hailed as a hero. According to biographer Henry Mayer, Henry had &quot;defined the prerogatives of the local elite by the unorthodox means of mobilizing the emotions of the lower ranks of religious and political outsiders.&quot; Henry&#x27;s popularity greatly increased, and he added 164 new clients in the year after the Parson&#x27;s Cause.

===Stamp Act (1764–1765)===
In the wake of the Parson&#x27;s Cause, Henry began to gain a following in backwoods Virginia because of his oratory defending the liberties of the common people and thanks to his friendly manner. He boosted his standing further in 1764 by representing Nathaniel West Dandridge, elected for Hanover County, in an election contest before the Burgesses. Dandridge was alleged to have bribed voters with drink, a practice common but illegal. Henry is said to have made a brilliant speech in defense of the rights of voters, but the text does not survive. Henry lost the case but met influential members on the Committee of Privileges and Elections, such as Richard Henry Lee, Peyton Randolph and George Wythe. In 1765, William Johnson, the brother of Thomas Johnson (who had been one of Henry&#x27;s clients in the Parson&#x27;s Cause) resigned as burgess for Louisa County. As Henry owned land in the county (acquired from his father to settle a loan), he was eligible to be a candidate, and he won the seat in May 1765. He left immediately for Williamsburg as the session had already begun.

The expense of the Seven Years&#x27; War (called the French and Indian War in North America) (1756–1763) had nearly doubled Britain&#x27;s national debt, and as much of the war had taken place in and around North America, the British government looked for ways of directly taxing the American colonies. The 1765 Stamp Act was both a means of raising revenue and one of asserting authority over the colonies. The Burgesses instructed their agent in London, Edward Montague, to oppose the measure, and other colonial legislatures similarly instructed their representatives. Considerable debate began over the proposed measure, and in Virginia pamphleteers developed arguments Henry had made in the Parson&#x27;s Cause.

Patrick Henry was sworn into a sleepy session of the legislature on May 20; many of the members had left town. On about May 28, a ship arrived with an urgent letter from Montague: the Stamp Act had passed. On May 29, Henry introduced the Virginia Stamp Act Resolves. The first two resolutions affirmed that the colonists had the same rights and privileges as Britons; the next two stated that taxation should be exacted only by one&#x27;s representatives. The fifth was the most provocative, as it named the Virginia legislature, the General Assembly, as the representatives of Virginia empowered to tax. Two other resolutions were offered, though their authorship is uncertain. Edmund and Helen Morgan, in their account of the Stamp Act crisis, suggest that Henry saw the Stamp Act as both a threat to Virginians&#x27; rights and an opportunity to advance himself politically.

There are no verbatim transcriptions of Henry&#x27;s speech in opposition to the Stamp Act. Texts are reconstructions, for the most part based on recollections decades later, by which time both the speech and Henry had become famous. For example, Jefferson, still in his studies at the nearby College of William &amp; Mary, recalled the splendor of Henry&#x27;s oratory. No attempt was made to reconstruct Henry&#x27;s words until 1790, when James Madison wrote to former burgess Edmund Pendleton, but Madison learned that Pendleton had not been present; a second attempt did not occur until Wirt began work on his biography of Henry in 1805. A French traveler whose name is not known and whose journal was discovered in 1921 recorded at the time of Henry&#x27;s speech that &quot;one of the members stood up and said that he had read that in former times Tarquin and Julius had their Brutus, Charles had his Cromwell, and he did not doubt but some good American would stand up, in favour of his country&quot;. As Henry had seemingly called for the killing of King George III, there were cries of &quot;Treason!&quot; in the chamber, including by Speaker John Robinson. John Tyler Sr. (father of the future president), who was standing with Jefferson as they watched the session, called this one of &quot;the trying moments which is decisive of character&quot;, and both recalled that Henry did not waver: &quot;If this be treason, make the most of it!&quot;. 

The Burgesses adopted the first five resolutions—the two others, which denied the right of any other body but the General Assembly to tax Virginians and which branded anyone who stated that Parliament had that right an enemy of the colony, were not passed. According to the Morgans, the passed resolutions differed little from language in petitions sent by the Burgesses to London in 1764, and the opposition to Henry may have been in part because he was an upstart in Virginia politics. On May 31, with Henry absent and likely returning home, the Burgesses expunged the fifth resolution, and Royal Governor Francis Fauquier refused to allow any of them to be printed in the official newspaper, the &quot;Virginia Gazette&quot;. With the official texts of the passed resolutions denied them, newspapers in the colonies and in Britain printed all seven resolutions, all of them presented as the resolves of the influential Colony of Virginia. The resolutions, more radical as a group than what was actually passed, reached Britain by mid-August, the first American reaction to the passage of the Stamp Act. In North America, they galvanized opposition to the Stamp Act and made Virginia the leader in opposition to Parliament&#x27;s action. According to Thad Tate in Henry&#x27;s &quot;American National Biography&quot; article, &quot;Not only in Virginia but across the mainland British colonies, Henry quickly established his reputation as an uncompromising opponent of imperial policy.&quot; The Morgans note &quot;In Virginia the Stamp Act provided the opportunity for Patrick Henry&#x27;s spectacular entry into politics&quot;.

=== Lawyer and landowner (1766–1773)===
Fauquier dissolved the Burgesses on June 1, 1765, hoping new elections would purge the radicals, but this proved not to be the case as conservative leaders were instead voted out. The governor did not call the Burgesses into session until November 1766, by which time the Stamp Act had been repealed by Parliament, preventing Virginia from sending delegates to the Stamp Act Congress in New York. Henry&#x27;s role in the active resistance that took place in Virginia against the Stamp Act is uncertain. Although the lack of a legislative session sidelined Henry during the crisis, it also undermined the established leaders of the chamber, who remained scattered through the colony with little opportunity to confer as the public rage for change grew hotter.

When the Burgesses eventually convened, Henry sometimes opposed the colonial leaders but united with them against British policies. In the late 1760s and early 1770s, Henry spent more time concentrating on his personal affairs, though he advanced in standing within the Burgesses serving on powerful committees. The Henry family moved to a new house on his Louisa County property, probably in late 1765, and lived there until 1769 when he returned to Hanover County. His law practice remained strong until the courts under royal authority closed in 1774. Jefferson later complained that Henry was lazy and ignorant in the practice of the law, his sole talent trying cases before juries, and accused Henry of charging criminal defendants high fees to get them acquitted. Norine Dickson Campbell, in her biography of Henry, found Jefferson&#x27;s comments unfounded; that Henry&#x27;s rates were moderate for the time and cited earlier historians as to Henry&#x27;s competence. Jefferson&#x27;s comments came years after the two, once friends, quarreled. In 1769, Henry was admitted to practice before the General Court of Virginia in Williamsburg, a venue more prestigious than the county courts.

Henry invested some of his earnings in frontier lands, in what is now the western part of Virginia, as well as in present-day West Virginia and Kentucky. He claimed ownership though many of them were controlled by the Native Americans, and he sought to get the colonial (and, later, state) government to recognize his claims. This was common among Virginia&#x27;s leading citizens, such as George Washington. Henry foresaw the potential of the Ohio Valley and was involved in schemes to found settlements. Income from land deals in 1771 enabled him to buy Scotchtown, a large plantation in Hanover County, which he purchased from John Payne, the father of Dolley Madison—she lived there for a brief time as a child. Scotchtown, with 16 rooms, was one of the largest mansions in Virginia.

Henry was a lifelong slaveholder from the time of his marriage at age 18. Henry professed that slavery was wrong and expressed hopes for its abolition, but he had no plan for doing so nor for the multiracial society that would result, for he did not believe schemes to settle freed slaves in Africa were realistic, &quot;to re-export them is now impracticable, and sorry I am for it.&quot; He wrote in 1773, &quot;I am the master of slaves of my own purchase. I am drawn along by the general inconvenience of living here without them. I will not, I cannot justify it.&quot; But the number of slaves he owned increased over time and as a result of his second marriage in 1777, so that at his death in 1799, he owned 67 slaves. In 1778, Henry and other planters, believing there to be a surplus of slave labor in Virginia, easily brought the transatlantic importation of new enslaved Africans to an end. The planters supported the effort to limit slave imports for their own economic reasons and for fear of slave rebellions, but they did not seek abolition of slaves already in Virginia, although moving towards abolition said to be a reason for passing the act. With a surplus of slaves and the ability to import more African slaves cut off, Virginia later became a source of slaves sold south in the coastwise slave trade.

===Renewed involvement and First Continental Congress (1773–1775)===
In 1773, Henry came into conflict with the royal governor, John Murray, 4th Earl of Dunmore. The governor, appointed in 1771, had sent British soldiers to Pittsylvania County to aid in apprehending a gang of counterfeiters. Once captured, they were immediately taken to Williamsburg for trial before the General Court, ignoring precedent that judicial proceedings should begin in the county where the offense took place or where the suspect had been captured. This was a sensitive matter especially because of the recent &quot;Gaspee&quot; Affair in Rhode Island, in which the British sought to capture and transport overseas for trial those who had burned a British ship. The Burgesses wanted to rebuke Dunmore for his actions, and Henry was part of a committee of eight that drafted a resolution thanking the governor for the capture of the gang but affirming that using the &quot;usual mode&quot; of criminal procedure protected both the guilty and the innocent. They also penned a plan, adopted by the Burgesses, for a committee of correspondence to communicate with leaders in other colonies to inform and coordinate with each other. The members included Henry.

Although Henry had by this time come to believe that conflict with Great Britain, and independence, were inevitable, he had no strategy for this. The Burgesses were sitting when in 1774, word came that Parliament had voted to close the port of Boston in retaliation for the Boston Tea Party, and several burgesses, including Henry, convened at the Raleigh Tavern to formulate a response. According to George Mason, a former burgess from Fairfax County who joined the committee in the work, Henry took the lead. Mason and Henry formed a close political relationship that lasted until Mason&#x27;s death in 1792. The resolution that Henry&#x27;s committee produced set June 1, 1774, the date upon which the Port of Boston was to be closed, as a day of fasting and prayer. It passed the Burgesses, but Dunmore dissolved the body. Undeterred, the former legislators met at the Raleigh Tavern and reconstituted themselves as a convention to meet again in August, after there was time for county meetings to show local sentiment. They also called for a boycott of tea and other products.

The five Virginia Conventions (1774–1776) would guide the Colony of Virginia to independence as royal authority came to an end. Their work was advanced by many resolutions of county meetings, denying the authority of Parliament over the colonies and calling for a boycott of imports. The first convention met in Williamsburg in the chamber of the Burgesses beginning on August 1; Dunmore was absent from the capital fighting the Native Americans and could not interfere. Divided between those who wanted separation from Britain and those who still hoped for some accommodation, it met for a week; one major decision was the election of delegates to a Continental Congress in Philadelphia. Henry was chosen as one of seven delegates, tying for second place with Washington, burgess for Fairfax County, both receiving three votes less than Randolph.
As Washington&#x27;s estate, Mount Vernon, lay on the way from Scotchtown to Philadelphia, he invited Henry to stop there and to ride to Philadelphia with him. Henry and Pendleton, another Virginia delegate to the Congress and a political rival of Henry&#x27;s, accepted the invitation. Delegates and prominent Philadelphians took an intense interest in the Virginians, who had taken the lead in resistance to Britain but whom few in the other colonies had met. This was Henry&#x27;s first stay in the North aside from a brief business trip to New York in 1770, but he found that his actions were well known. The sessions began on September 5, 1774, at Carpenters&#x27; Hall. Silas Deane of Connecticut described Henry as &quot;the compleatest speaker I ever heard ... but in a Letter I can give You no Idea of the Music of his Voice, or the highwrought, yet Natural elegance of his Stile, or Manner&quot;. The secretary of the Congress, Charles Thomson, wrote that when Henry rose, he had expected little from a man dressed as plainly as a rural minister. &quot;But as he proceeded, [he] evinced such [an] unusual force of argument, and such novel and impassioned eloquence as soon electrified the whole house. Then the excited inquiry passed from man to man ... &#x27;Who is it? Who is it?&#x27; The answer from the few who knew him was, it is &quot;Patrick Henry&quot;.&quot;

Henry was involved in the first dispute within the Congress on whether each colony should have an equal vote, taking the position that there should be proportional representation giving the larger colonies a greater voice. He argued that colonial borders must be swept away in the need for Americans to unify and create a government to fill the void left with the end of British authority, &quot;Fleets and armies and the present state of things shew that Government is dissolved. Where are your landmarks? your boundaries of colonies? The distinctions between Virginians, Pennsylvanians, New Yorkers, and New Englanders are no more. I am not a Virginian, but an American.&quot; Henry lost the argument, and his theatrics made Congress&#x27;s leaders afraid he would be unpredictable if placed on the lead committee charged with composing a statement regarding colonial rights. Instead, he was put on the next most important committee, one inquiring into commercial regulation. In the end, though, neither committee produced much of importance. Henry believed the purpose of the Congress should be to mobilize public opinion towards war. In this, he found common cause with John Adams and Samuel Adams of Massachusetts, but not all were of that opinion. According to Tate, Henry &quot;turned out not to be an especially influential member of the body&quot;. The Congress decided on a petition to the king; Henry prepared two drafts, but neither proved satisfactory. When Congress on October 26 approved a draft prepared by John Dickinson of Pennsylvania, who had consulted with Henry and also Richard Henry Lee, Henry had already departed for home, and Lee signed on his behalf. The petition was rejected in London.

After the birth of their sixth child in 1771, Patrick&#x27;s wife Sarah Shelton Henry began to exhibit symptoms of mental illness, and one reason for the move from Louisa County to Scotchtown was so they could be near family members. Henry&#x27;s biographer, Jon Kukla believes she was the victim of postpartum psychosis, for which there was no treatment. At times, she was restrained in a form of straitjacket. Although Virginia had opened the first public mental facility in North America in 1773, Henry decided that she was better off at Scotchtown and prepared a large apartment for her there. She died in 1775, after which Henry avoided all objects that reminded him of her and sold Scotchtown in 1777.

===&quot;Liberty or Death&quot; (1775)===

Hanover County elected Henry as a delegate to the Second Virginia Convention, which convened at St. John&#x27;s Episcopal Church in the town of Richmond on March 20, 1775. Richmond was selected as better protected from royal authority. The convention debated whether Virginia should adopt language from a petition by the planters of the Colony of Jamaica. This document contained complaints about British actions but admitted the king could veto colonial legislation, and it urged reconciliation. Henry offered amendments to raise a militia independent of royal authority in terms that recognized that conflict with Britain was inevitable, sparking the opposition of moderates. On March 23, he defended his amendments, concluding with the statement he is well known for:

As he concluded, Henry plunged an ivory paper cutter towards his chest in imitation of the Roman patriot Cato the Younger. Henry&#x27;s speech carried the day, and the convention adopted his amendments. Still, they passed only narrowly, as many delegates were uncertain where the resistance urged by Henry and other radicals would lead, and few counties formed independent militia companies at the urging of the convention.

The text of Henry&#x27;s speech first appeared in print in Wirt&#x27;s 1817 biography, published 18 years after Patrick Henry&#x27;s death. Wirt corresponded with men who had heard the speech and others who were acquainted with people who were there at the time. All agreed that the speech had produced a profound effect, but it seems that only one person attempted to render an actual text. Judge St. George Tucker, who had been present for the speech, gave Wirt his recollections and Wirt wrote back stating that &quot;I have taken almost entirely Mr. Henry&#x27;s speech in the Convention of &#x27;75 from you, as well as your description of its effect on your verbatim.&quot; The original letter with Tucker&#x27;s remembrances has been lost.

For 160 years Wirt&#x27;s account was taken at face value. In the 1970s, historians began to question the authenticity of Wirt&#x27;s reconstruction. Contemporary historians observe that Henry was known to have used fear of Indian and slave revolts in promoting military action against the British and that, according to the only written first-hand account of the speech, Henry used some graphic name-calling that Wirt did not include in his heroic rendition. Tucker&#x27;s account was based upon recollections and not notes, several decades after the speech; he wrote, &quot;In vain should I attempt to give any idea of his speech&quot;. Scholars have argued to what extent the speech we know is the work of Wirt or Tucker.

=== Gunpowder incident (1775) ===
On April 21, 1775, Governor Dunmore had the Royal Marines under his command seize gunpowder from the magazine in Williamsburg and take it to a naval ship. The gunpowder belonged to the government, to be issued in case of need, such as a slave uprising. Dunmore&#x27;s actions outraged many Virginians. Henry had departed for Philadelphia, having been elected a delegate to the Second Continental Congress, but a messenger caught up with him before he left Hanover County, and he returned to take command of the local militia. Seeking the restoration of the powder, or that the colonists be compensated for it, on May 2, Henry led his troops towards Williamsburg with, as Dunmore wrote, &quot;all the Appearances of actual War&quot;. By this time, word of the Battles of Lexington and Concord had arrived, and many Virginians believed that war with Britain had begun. With his troops reinforced by eager volunteers from nearby counties, Henry likely had force enough to take Williamsburg and deal Dunmore a humiliating defeat, but increasingly prominent messengers urging caution slowed his advance, and in New Kent County, still some from Williamsburg, three of Henry&#x27;s fellow delegates to Congress helped persuade him to leave off his march. As Henry insisted the colonists be compensated, a member of the Governor&#x27;s Council agreed to pay the value of the powder by bill of exchange.

Although Dunmore issued a proclamation against &quot;a certain &quot;Patrick Henry&quot;, of the County of &quot;Hanover&quot;, and a Number of his deluded Followers&quot;, 15 county committees quickly approved Henry&#x27;s action, and when he finally departed for Philadelphia, he was escorted to the Potomac by militia who lined the shore, cheering as his ferry pulled away. Not all approved; Henry&#x27;s march appalled some moderates who feared he might provoke a conflict in which Virginia stood alone against Britain&#x27;s might. They also saw him as a threat to the sanctity of property, for anyone&#x27;s might be taken by Henry and his troops. As popular support for independence grew, opponents either joined in the movement or decided it was wiser to remain silent.

Henry belatedly arrived at the Congress on May 18, 1775. Jefferson later stated that Henry played only a supporting role, and though there is not a complete record, the fact that he was not written of as having an impact appears to confirm that. The Congress appointed Washington as head of American forces, an appointment that Henry supported. At the end of the session, in August, Henry left Philadelphia for Virginia and would never again hold office outside its borders.

While Henry was returning, the Third Virginia Convention in August commissioned him as colonel of the 1st Virginia Regiment, and he took up the appointment later that month. Although Henry had little military experience, this was not considered a major drawback at the time, and he was held to have distinguished himself in the march on Williamsburg. General Washington, though, felt that the convention had &quot;made a Capital mistake when they took Henry out of the Senate to place him in the Field&quot;. In September, Virginia&#x27;s Committee of Safety placed Henry in charge of all Virginia&#x27;s forces. Despite the high title, Henry was placed under tight civilian control, and to an extent the willingness of moderates to go along with the appointment reflected a view that in that position, the volatile Henry would be contained.

Henry moved to organize his regiment and had no difficulty recruiting men. As commander, he organized a navy. In November 1775, Dunmore, who though he had abandoned Williamsburg still held Norfolk, issued a proclamation offering freedom to any black slave or indentured servant willing and able to serve in his forces, which already included several hundred former slaves. Henry wrote to all county lieutenants, stating that the proclamation &quot;is fatal to the publick Safety&quot; and urging an &quot;unremitting Attention to the Government of the SLAVES may, I hope, counteract this dangerous Attempt. Constant, and well directed Patrols, seem indispensably necessary.&quot;

Henry saw no action himself, and there were murmurs in the convention against his command; some feared he was too radical to be an effective military leader. In February 1776, Virginia&#x27;s forces were reorganized as they were placed under Continental command. Henry was to retain his rank of colonel but was placed under a former subordinate. Henry refused and left the army; his troops were outraged by the slight to him and considered leaving service, but he calmed the situation.

== Independence and first time as governor (1776–1779) ==
Henry did not sit in the Fourth Virginia Convention which met in December 1775, as he was ineligible because of his military commission. Once he was again a civilian, the freeholders of Hanover County in April 1776 elected him to the fifth convention, to meet the following month. Most delegates were for independence but were divided on how and when to declare it. Henry introduced a resolution declaring Virginia independent and urging the Congress to declare all the colonies free. When he at last spoke, according to clergyman Edmund Randolph, Henry &quot;appeared in an element for which he was born. To cut the knot, which calm prudence was puzzled to untie, was worthy of the magnificence of his genius. He entered into no subtlety of reasoning but was roused by the now apparent spirit of the people as a pillar of fire, which notwithstanding the darkness of the prospect would conduct to the promised land.&quot; The eventual resolution was based in large part on Henry&#x27;s and passed unanimously on May 15, 1776. As well as declaring Virginia independent, the resolution instructed the state&#x27;s delegates in Congress to press for American independence, which they would, with Lee introducing the motion and Jefferson penning the Declaration.

The convention then proceeded to consider a constitution for Virginia&#x27;s government. Henry was appointed to a committee under the leadership of Archibald Cary. Much of the work fell to the final appointee to the committee, George Mason of Fairfax County, who did not arrive in Williamsburg until May 18, delayed by illness. Mason first drafted a Declaration of Rights; it was discussed in the Cary Committee on May 25. Mason&#x27;s draft, more than the final declaration, would be highly influential, used by Jefferson in writing the Declaration of Independence and by writers of many 18th and 19th century state constitutions. When the draft was debated, Henry, at the request of a young delegate from Orange County, James Madison, produced an amendment changing Mason&#x27;s call for religious tolerance to one requiring full freedom of religion. This was seen as a threat to Virginia&#x27;s established religion, Anglicanism, and did not pass. Madison reworked it and had another delegate introduce it, likely Edmund Randolph, and it passed. Mason&#x27;s draft called for a ban on bills of attainder. Henry got it removed by telling the delegates that some high offender might be reached by no other means. The convention approved the Declaration of Rights on June 12.

Virginia&#x27;s form of government, to be placed in its constitution, became a national concern; Jefferson, in Philadelphia though he would have preferred to be in Williamsburg, sent a plan, and John Adams sent Henry a pamphlet containing his own views, to which Henry replied, &quot;your sentiments are precisely the same I have long since taken up, and they come recommended by you&quot;. But it was Mason&#x27;s plan for the government of Virginia which dominated, with much power given to the Virginia House of Delegates, the lower house of the legislature. The House of Delegates and the Senate of Virginia together formed the General Assembly, as the Virginia legislature is known. Under the 1776 constitution, the governor, elected by the two houses of the legislature, was not even given the power to veto legislation and was required to act with the approval of the Governor&#x27;s Council on important matters. Henry opposed the weakness of the governor, feeling it was risky at a time of war to have the executive so weak, but his views did not prevail. He had reason to rue the office&#x27;s lack of power, as on June 29, 1776, the convention elected him as Virginia&#x27;s first post-independence governor, by 60 votes to 45 for Thomas Nelson Jr. The election of Henry, at that time Virginia&#x27;s most popular politician, helped assure acceptance of the new authorities but also placed him in a figurehead position, removed from the true power in the new government, the House of Delegates.

Henry was taken ill almost immediately upon being sworn in as governor on July 5 and recuperated at Scotchtown. He returned to Williamsburg in September and corresponded with General Washington about the military situation. Washington, who was less effective because of the inadequacies of his troops, complained about the state militias, feeling a Continental Army committed for the duration of the war was needed. Henry helped recruit new troops for Washington, but his efforts were hampered by several issues, including the weakness of Henry&#x27;s office. In December 1776, with the General Assembly alarmed at reports Washington&#x27;s army was in retreat as the British occupied Philadelphia, legislators granted Henry temporary expanded powers, something that Jefferson was still unhappy about years later, feeling that Henry was trying to set himself up as dictator. In March 1777, Henry wrote to Washington seeking permission to recruit soldiers for terms of up to eight months. Washington&#x27;s anger in his response that such troops were not useful caused Henry to drop the matter, stating that he deferred to Washington&#x27;s experience in military matters. Recruiting remained a problem; many Virginians were willing to be members of the county militia but did not want to join the Continental Army lest they be sent out of state or exposed to disease. Desertion was also a problem Henry labored to solve with limited success; many Virginians had been induced to enlist with promises they would not be sent outside the state or local area, and they left when orders came to march.

Henry was elected to a second one-year term without opposition and took the oath on July 2, 1777. On October 9 at Scotchtown, he married Dorothea Dandridge, daughter of his old client, Nathaniel West Dandridge of Hanover County. This made him closer kin to Washington, as Nathaniel Dandridge was Martha Washington&#x27;s uncle. To add to the six children he had by Sarah Henry, he would have eleven more by Dorothea, though two by the second marriage died very young. She brought 12 slaves with her, adding to the 30 Patrick Henry already had. He sold Scotchtown in 1777 and moved to Leatherwood Plantation in Henry County, which the General Assembly had just created and named for him.

When Washington and his troops encamped at Valley Forge in the winter of 1777–78, Henry arranged for livestock and other food to be sent to their relief. There was discontent against Washington, who was not seen by some as a successful general, and this resulted in the so-called Conway Cabal. Henry supported Washington when Dr. Benjamin Rush of Philadelphia, one of those unenthusiastic about Washington, sent the governor an unsigned letter, discussing machinations against the general. Henry immediately sent Washington the letter, and though it is uncertain if Henry recognized Rush&#x27;s handwriting, Washington did, tipping him off to the conspiracy. President Washington wrote of Henry in 1794, &quot;I have always respected and esteemed him; nay more, I have conceived myself under obligation to him for the friendly manner in which he transmitted to me some insidious anonymous writings in the close of the year 1777 with a view to embark him in the opposition that was forming against me at that time&quot;.

In an effort to secure Virginia&#x27;s vast claims in the West (to the Mississippi River and north to present-day Minnesota) against British and Native American forces, Henry in December 1777 sent George Rogers Clark on an expedition against Kaskaskia, site of a British and French settlement. This part of Clark&#x27;s mission was secret; his public orders merely stated he was to raise a militia and go to Kentucky (then part of Virginia). Clark captured Kaskaskia in July 1778 and remained north of the Ohio River for the remainder of Henry&#x27;s governorship. Although the expedition did not turn out as well as hoped, Henry trumpeted its successes, but after he left the governorship in 1779 and was elected to the House of Delegates, he became a foe of Clark.
Henry was elected to a third term on May 29, 1778, again without opposition. Jefferson led the committee of notables sent to inform him of his election. In December 1778, Henry sent an urgent appeal to Congress for naval aid in protecting Chesapeake Bay. None was forthcoming, and on May 8, 1779, in the final days of Henry&#x27;s governorship, British ships under Sir George Collier entered the bay, landed troops, and took Portsmouth and Suffolk, destroying valuable supplies. The British departed on May 24, and Henry, limited to three consecutive terms in office by the 1776 constitution, left office soon after, succeeded by Jefferson, and with his family returned to Leatherwood.

== Leatherwood and the House of Delegates (1779–1784)==
At Leatherwood, Henry devoted himself to local affairs in the thinly-populated county and was given seats on the county court (the local governing body), as prominent landowners were, and on the parish vestry. He refused to be elected a delegate to Congress, stating that his personal business and past illness made that impossible. When Governor Jefferson sent a note to him in early 1780, Henry replied with gratitude, complaining of his isolation, and wrote of his many concerns about the state of affairs as the war continued. The freeholders of Henry County soon thereafter sent its eponym to the House of Delegates. But within weeks, health problems recurred, causing his return to Leatherwood. While in Richmond (where the capital had been moved) Henry opposed a congressional plan to revalue Continental currency and impose certain taxes, feeling it would mostly benefit the North. He was successful in defeating it, but after he left Richmond, supporters persuaded the legislature to pass it. Once he returned home, he was heavily involved in efforts to recruit local volunteers to suppress bands of Loyalists who were conducting raids in the frontier area. Henry rode with the troops, though he did not lead them, and they were generally successful in suppressing the resistance. The volunteers were disbanded in September 1780.

In January 1781, British forces under the renegade former American general, Benedict Arnold, sailed up the James River and captured Richmond with little opposition as Henry joined the other legislators and Governor Jefferson in fleeing to Charlottesville. Although Arnold soon withdrew to Portsmouth, in February, troops under Lord Cornwallis entered the state from North Carolina; the war, which had for the most part been fought out of state, would have many of its final moves played in Virginia. With Washington&#x27;s army near New York, Henry sought to recruit soldiers to defend the state and in March helped draft an angry remonstrance from the House of Delegates to Congress, demanding help. Nevertheless, in May, British forces under Colonel Banastre Tarleton raided Charlottesville, nearly capturing the Virginia government, which fled to Staunton. There is a story that Henry fled with other prominent leaders and sought refuge at the home of a woman who initially spurned them as cowards for fleeing Charlottesville. But on learning Henry was with the group, she decided it must be all right, and offered them the best she had.

Jefferson did not go to Staunton: his term as governor had just expired, but the legislature had not met to hold an election. After the raid, he took refuge at his farm in Bedford County, and Virginia had no governor for ten days. Several legislators complained of Jefferson&#x27;s actions and called for an inquiry into the conduct of the executive (Jefferson and his council), and Henry was among those who took the lead. The resolution passed, but the inquiry was set for the next session, and the legislature thought better of it. Jefferson was angered at Henry&#x27;s actions and held a grudge that did not abate until well after Henry&#x27;s death in 1799.

With the war effectively ended by the American victory at the siege of Yorktown, Henry served as delegate from his county through 1784, when he was elected again as governor. Peace brought many adjustments, and Henry sponsored legislation to reform Virginia&#x27;s currency and to adjust payments from contracts still outstanding from before periods of high inflation. Jefferson and others wanted to reopen contracts that had been already settled but in depreciated currency; Henry thought that unjust, and because of his influence in the General Assembly, his version prevailed. This had international implications, as some of the creditors were British, who sought payment in hard money rather than the depreciated currency that had been paid into escrow. At the May 1783 House of Delegates session, Henry successfully sponsored a resolution to repeal the trade embargo against Britain. That passed despite opposition from Speaker John Tyler Sr. Henry also introduced legislation to permit Loyalists to return to Virginia. There was considerable opposition to that, and the measure was held over until later in the year, by which time public sentiment had been gauged through meetings in each county. Henry spoke in the debate, asking &quot;shall we, who have laid the proud British lion at our feet, be frightened of its whelps?&quot; Once it was amended (though in what way is not clear), the bill passed in November 1783.

Henry worked together with James Madison, a delegate after three years in Congress, on a number of issues. They differed, though, on state support for Virginia&#x27;s Protestant churches. Madison, like Jefferson, desired a separation between church and state that meant no public financing of religion, but Henry believed that taxpayers who were Christians should be assessed for the maintenance of the Protestant church of their choice, financing an array of churches in the way that Anglicanism had been funded in Virginia until the start of the war. Henry was not alone in this belief; both Washington and Lee supported such plans. According to Thomas S. Kidd in his biography of Henry, &quot;the general assessment plan is one of the main reasons Henry is not more widely esteemed as a Founder, for in this debate, he seems to have diverted from the progressive flow of history.&quot; The General Assembly might well have passed the bill, but on November 17, 1784, the legislators elected Henry as governor. Madison believed that Henry took the position for family reasons—his wife and children were likely quite happy to be in Richmond rather than in remote Henry County—but the cost was Henry&#x27;s bill as Madison got it postponed to the following year and eventually defeated. Instead, Madison got Jefferson&#x27;s Statute for Religious Freedom through the legislature. This law requiring a separation of church and state passed the General Assembly in 1786.

== Second period as governor (1784–1786) ==
Henry&#x27;s second time as governor was for two years, as the legislature re-elected him in 1785. It was, generally, more placid than his first. During this time, Henry and his family lived at &quot;Salisbury&quot;, in Chesterfield County, about from Richmond in open country that he rented, though he had an official residence close to the Virginia Capitol, which was then under construction. The General Assembly had passed legislation for new arms for the militia, and Henry worked with Lafayette to have them sent from France.

Each county&#x27;s militia was under firm local control, a state of affairs that had resulted in problems during the war as local militia refused orders from Henry and other governors when asked to serve out of state or conscript recruits into the Continental Army. In 1784, seeking to bring the militias under central control, the General Assembly passed an act terminating all militia officer commissions and allowing Henry, with the consent of the Governor&#x27;s Council, to appoint replacements. The Virginia Constitution required that there be a recommendation from the county court. Instead of asking the county court, Henry solicited recommendations from prominent citizens in each county whom he or his council members knew. The result was near revolt in the counties, as citizens protested the act as unconstitutional, and counties refused to obey. The law went widely unenforced, and in October 1785, Henry requested the legislators to repeal it; they complied the following year.

Residents of western North Carolina, what is today the state of Tennessee, sought to separate and become the State of Franklin. A former delegate, Arthur Campbell, wanted to join Virginia&#x27;s adjacent Washington County as part of the scheme in 1785. Henry had Campbell removed as a militia officer and from his other county offices, as well as ousting Campbell&#x27;s supporters, replacing them with residents of known loyalty. Although Henry urged leniency in his report to the General Assembly that October, stating that the Washington County separatists had been led astray by anxiety because of the poor economy, he had the legislature pass a Treason Act forbidding the setting-up of a rival government within Virginia territory.

Henry also sought to advance Virginia&#x27;s development, both as governor and through his personal investments. He backed schemes to open navigation on the upper Potomac and James rivers, envisioning canals to connect them to the Ohio River Valley. He also supported a scheme to develop a canal across the Great Dismal Swamp, believing that with it, the trade of eastern North Carolina would flow through Norfolk. He owned land along the proposed route and sought to interest General Washington in the scheme but was not successful. Despite Henry&#x27;s support for internal improvements, he failed to notify Virginia&#x27;s representatives of their appointment to meet with Maryland over navigation on the Potomac, and only two, including George Mason, attended what became known as the Mount Vernon Conference in 1785. Randolph, unable to attend because of lack of timely notification, hinted that the reason for Henry&#x27;s neglect was not forgetfulness but a growing hostility towards things federal. In 1786, Henry was more assiduous in notifying delegates to the Annapolis Conference called with the support of Madison, who was appointed a delegate. Henry stepped down at the end of his fifth term, stating he needed to devote time to his family and earn money to support it. Randolph succeeded him as governor.

== Opponent of the Constitution (1787–1790) ==
Disinclined to return to distant Leatherwood after his time as governor ended in November 1786, Henry hoped to purchase land in Hanover County but bought property in Prince Edward County instead. Hampden-Sydney College, which he had helped found in 1775, is located in that county, and Henry enrolled his sons there. The local freeholders elected Henry to the House of Delegates in early 1787, and he served there until the end of 1790. Governor Randolph offered to make Henry a delegate to the Constitutional Convention, scheduled to meet in Philadelphia later that year to consider changes to the Articles of Confederation, the document that had governed the loose union among the states since 1777. Henry refused the appointment, alleging it would be difficult financially. One legend is that when Henry was asked why he had not gone, he replied, &quot;I smelt a rat.&quot;

Henry&#x27;s record of urging unity made him a potential supporter of a closer bond between the states, and as late as the end of 1786, Madison hoped for Henry as an ally in the fight. Several factors had eroded Henry&#x27;s trust in the Northern states, including what he deemed Congress&#x27;s failure to send adequate troops to protect Virginia settlers in the Ohio River Valley. Henry was outraged by the Jay–Gardoqui Treaty, which would have ceded exclusive navigation on the Mississippi River to Spain for 25 years. This was in exchange for commercial concessions that would benefit New England, where there was a growing separatist movement. Northern votes were sufficient to relax John Jay&#x27;s negotiating instructions, which had originally forbidden restricting American navigation on the Mississippi, to allow him to reach a deal; Southern votes were sufficient to block the treaty&#x27;s ratification. These events caused Henry and some other Virginia leaders to feel betrayed and to have little trust in the good faith of the North.

When the Philadelphia convention adjourned in September 1787, its president, Washington, returned home and immediately sent a copy of the new Constitution to Henry, recommending he support it. Henry was in Richmond for the autumn legislative session as delegate for Prince Edward County. While thanking Washington for presiding in Philadelphia and for sending the document, he said of it, &quot;I have to lament that I cannot bring my Mind to accord with the proposed Constitution. The Concern I feel on this account is really greater than I am able to express.&quot; He hinted, though, that he was still open to changing his mind. This allowed Henry to remain noncommittal as opponents of the Constitution, such as Mason and Edmund Randolph (both delegates at Philadelphia) published their opinions, and to refine his views. In the initial Virginia battle over the Constitution, the call for a convention to decide whether the state should ratify it, Henry and Mason were among those who supported allowing the convention to ratify it conditional on amendments being made. The matter was compromised with language allowing the convention&#x27;s members full rein in deciding what to do, and it was set for June 1788, with elections in March; both those who supported it and those who did not felt time would be to their advantage.

Henry was elected to the convention from Prince Edward County without difficulty, though John Blair Smith, president of Hampden-Sydney, caused him some annoyance by having students read at an assembly, in Henry&#x27;s presence, a speech by Henry on the subject of the Constitution and Smith&#x27;s own rebuttal. Henry opposed the Constitution because of its grant of a strong executive, the president; he had not fought to free Virginia from King George to surrender such powers to what might prove a despot. Henry accordingly deemed the Constitution a backwards step and a betrayal of those who had died in the Revolutionary cause. At the Virginia Ratifying Convention, which began on June 2, 1788, according to Kidd, Henry&#x27;s &quot;personality blazed in all its power and glory.&quot; Henry suggested that the framers of the Constitution had no right to begin it &quot;We the People&quot; and ignore the powers of the states. He suggested that the document put too much power in the hands of too few. He noted that the Constitution, proposed without a Bill of Rights, did not protect individual rights: 
Madison, the lead supporter of the Constitution, was inhibited in replying to Henry&#x27;s criticisms, since he was ill through most of the convention. Henry likely realized he was fighting a losing battle as sentiment in the convention moved towards ratification, but he continued to speak at length, and his speeches fill nearly one-quarter of the pages of the Richmond convention&#x27;s debates. Governor Randolph, who had become a supporter of ratification, suggested that if the convention allowed Henry to continue arguing, it would last six months rather than six weeks. After the convention voted on June 25 to ratify the Constitution, Henry was somewhat mollified by the fact that the convention had proposed about 40 amendments; some of them were later incorporated in the Bill of Rights. Mason, Henry&#x27;s ally in opposing ratification, intended a fiery diatribe on the faults of the new plan of government; he was talked out of it. By one account, Henry told other opponents that he had done his duty in opposing ratification, and as republicans, with the issues settled in a democratic way, they had best all go home. Madison wrote to Washington that Henry still hoped for amendments to weaken the power of the federal government, possibly to be proposed by a second national convention.

Henry returned to the House of Delegates where he successfully defeated Madison&#x27;s effort to become federal senator from Virginia, for under the original Constitution senators were elected by legislators, not the people. Although Henry made it clear he would not serve in office outside Virginia, he received a number of votes in the election. Madison gained election to the House of Representatives in a district where he was opposed by James Monroe, though Madison&#x27;s supporters complained that Henry&#x27;s supporters in the legislature had unfairly placed Orange County, Madison&#x27;s home county, in a district leaning anti-Federalist. Henry also saw to it that the requested amendments were incorporated in petitions from the legislature to the federal Congress. Despite his qualms, Henry served as one of Virginia&#x27;s presidential electors, voting for Washington (elected President) and John Adams (elected Vice President). Henry was disappointed when the First Congress passed only amendments dealing with personal liberties, not those designed to weaken the government.

A final cause Henry engaged in before leaving the House of Delegates at the end of 1790 was over the Funding Act of 1790, by which the federal government took over the debts of the states, much of which dated from the Revolutionary War. On November 3, 1790, Henry introduced a resolution which was passed by the House of Delegates and by the state Senate, declaring the act &quot;repugnant to the constitution of the United States, as it goes to the exercise of a power not granted to the general [federal] government&quot;. This would prove the first of many resolutions passed by Southern state legislatures in the decades to come, defending states&#x27; rights and strict interpretation of the Constitution.

== Later years ==

Leaving the House of Delegates after 1790, Henry found himself in debt, owing in part to expenses while governor, and sought to secure his family&#x27;s fortune through land speculation and a return to the practice of law. Not fully reconciled to the federal government, Henry contemplated a new republic in the sparsely settled frontier lands, but his plans came to nothing. He did not travel as widely for cases as he had in the 1760s, confining his practice mostly to Prince Edward and Bedford counties, though in a compelling case, or for a large enough fee, he would travel to Richmond or over the mountains to Greenbrier County (today in West Virginia).

When the new federal court opened in Virginia in 1790, British creditors promptly filed over a hundred cases seeking to enforce claims from the Revolutionary War. Henry was part of the defense team in &quot;Jones v. Walker&quot; before the federal court in 1791; his co-counsel included John Marshall, who prepared the written pleadings while Henry did much of the courtroom advocacy. Henry argued the case for three days; Marshall, looking back, called him &quot;a great orator ... and much more, a learned lawyer, a most accurate thinker, and a profound reasoner&quot;. The case ended inconclusively after one of the judges died, but the legal teams reassembled for the case of &quot;Ware v. Hylton&quot;. Argued before another three-judge panel that included Chief Justice of the United States John Jay and Associate Justice James Iredell, Henry&#x27;s argument provoked Justice Iredell to exclaim, &quot;Gracious God! He is an orator indeed.&quot; Henry and Marshall were initially successful, but the plaintiffs appealed, and after Marshall argued his only case before the Supreme Court, that court in 1796 ruled for the British creditors.

Henry&#x27;s friendship with Washington had cooled somewhat amid the ratification debates, but by 1794, both men were looking to reconcile. Henry found himself more aligned with Washington than with Jefferson and Madison, and Washington still considered himself indebted to Henry for notifying him about the Conway Cabal. Washington offered Henry a seat on the Supreme Court in 1794, but he refused, feeling his family needed him. Washington also tried to get Henry to accept positions as Secretary of State and as minister to Spain, and Virginia Governor &quot;Light-Horse&quot; Harry Lee wanted to appoint him to the Senate. Henry refused each time. Henry&#x27;s continuing popularity in Virginia made him an attractive ally, and even Jefferson tried to recruit him, sending word though a mutual friend that he bore no grudge. After Washington made it clear he would not seek a third term in 1796, Marshall and Lee discussed a possible Henry run for president with him, but Henry was unwilling. The General Assembly elected him as governor again that year, but he declined, citing age and health. Henry&#x27;s refusal to accept these offices increased his popularity as he was, like Washington, seen as a Cincinnatus, giving up power to return to his farm and his plow.

Henry sold his property in Prince Edward County in 1792, moving with his family to Long Island, a plantation in Campbell County. In 1794, Henry purchased Red Hill near Brookneal, Virginia in Charlotte County, where he and his family lived much of the year, though they moved to Long Island in the &quot;sickly season&quot;. Henry was gratified at the election of his old friend John Adams as president in 1796 over his foe Jefferson, but Henry&#x27;s commitment to the Federalist Party was tested by the repressive Alien and Sedition Acts of 1798. He chose to say nothing but supported the campaign of Marshall, a moderate Federalist, for the House of Representatives; Marshall won narrowly. Henry was under considerable pressure from Virginia Federalists to return to politics, but it was not until former president Washington urged him to run for the legislature in early 1799 that Henry gave in. Turning down an offer from President Adams to make him an envoy to France, Henry was elected as delegate from Charlotte County on March 4, 1799. The legislature had no immediate session scheduled, so he returned to Red Hill and never left again, dying there of intussusception at his home on June 6, 1799. He was buried at Red Hill. In Henry&#x27;s will, he left his estates and his 67 slaves to be divided between his wife and his six sons. He did not free any slaves, despite his speeches against enslavement by tyrants and despite his various comments opposing the institution of slavery itself.

The tributes to Henry upon his death were many. The &quot;Virginia Gazette&quot; printed a death notice bordered in black, &quot;As long as our rivers flow, or mountains stand, Virginia ... will say to rising generations, imitate my H &quot;. The &quot;Petersburg Intelligencer&quot; regretted the death of a man who might have been able &quot;to conciliate all parties and produce that harmony and accord&quot; needed at a time of national controversy. The &quot;Argus&quot;, a paper which supported Jefferson&#x27;s faction, noted that Henry &quot;pointed out those evils in our Constitution ... against which we now complain ... If any are disposed to censure Mr. Henry for his late political transition [to supporting the Federalists], if anything has been written on that subject, let the Genius of American Independence drop a tear, and blot it out forever.&quot;

==Monuments and memorials==

Several of Henry&#x27;s homes are recognized for their association with him. Scotchtown Plantation is a National Historic Landmark. The Red Hill Patrick Henry National Memorial preserves Henry&#x27;s final home, gravesite, and his law office. The site of his birthplace, which burned in 1807 and is now reduced to archaeological remains, is also preserved; it is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. A plaque placed by the Daughters of the American Revolution marks the site of Leatherwood in Henry County.

Henry helped found Hampden-Sydney College, believing that &quot;every free state&quot; should promote &quot;useful knowledge amongst its citizens&quot;. He was an original trustee and sent seven of his sons there. Henry was instrumental in getting its charter passed by the General Assembly in 1783. Emory and Henry College in Emory, Virginia was named for him and John Emory, an early bishop in Virginia. According to the college, &quot;Bishop Emory symbolizes belief in the union of faith and learning, while Governor Henry represents the commitment to the ideals of freedom and civic virtue.&quot;

Fort Henry stood in what is now Wheeling, West Virginia, but was at the time part of Virginia. It was built in 1774 and named Fort Fincastle after one of Lord Dunmore&#x27;s titles but was renamed for Henry, then governor, after independence. Fort Patrick Henry was built during the American Revolutionary War along the South Fork Holston River at the present-day site of Kingsport, Tennessee. This fort serves as the namesake of Fort Patrick Henry Dam and its reservoir on the river. At least four ships have been named in Henry&#x27;s honor: the passenger and freight packet ship &quot;Patrick Henry&quot;, the Civil War Confederate Navy steamboat , World War II Liberty ship and the ballistic missile submarine .

Camp Patrick Henry was a World War II-era military camp near Newport News, Virginia. Decommissioned in 1946, it became the site of the Newport News/Williamsburg International Airport on . When opened in 1949, the airport was called Patrick Henry Field and was later renamed Patrick Henry International Airport, a name it retained until 1990. The airport code is still PHF.
Patrick Henry has been honored twice on U.S. postage stamps. On October 7, 1955, the United States Post Office Department issued a $1 definitive stamp honoring Henry, one of the high values in the Liberty issue. A painting of Henry by American artist Alonzo Chappel was used as the inspiration and as the model by the engraver for this issue. In 1960–1961, the U.S. Post Office issued the American Credo series, six stamps with well-known patriotic quotations. Patrick Henry&#x27;s most famous words are inscribed on the final issue in the series, a 4-cent stamp first released in Richmond on January 11, 1961.
== Legacy and historical view ==
As historian Richard Beeman put it, Henry was a man who &quot;did not bother to write much of anything down&quot;, a handicap when being evaluated by history. The lack of primary source materials regarding Henry—only a handful of papers and a few of his speeches survive—has frustrated Henry&#x27;s biographers from Wirt (1817) to Beeman (1974). Two years before publishing his book, Wirt commented: &quot;It is all speaking, speaking, speaking. &#x27;Tis true he could talk—Gods! how he &quot;could&quot; talk! but ... to make the matter worse, from 1763 to 1789 ... not one of his speeches lives in print, writing or memory&quot;. Beeman, for his part, concludes, &quot;the Revolutionary firebrand, whatever his achievements, possessed a miserable sense of history&quot;. This was a deficiency not possessed by Jefferson, who not only survived Henry by a quarter century, but who got to fill the vacuum of information about Henry with his own recollections and opinions. Wirt did not print many of Jefferson&#x27;s criticisms of Henry, who had irritated Jefferson to such an extent he was still criticizing Henry to guests at Monticello in 1824. Jefferson&#x27;s negative assessments of Henry, whether justified or not, have adversely affected Henry&#x27;s historical reputation.

Henry has always been acclaimed by Americans for the brilliance of his political oratory. Kukla writes, &quot;Henry explained the Revolution to ordinary men and women through America in words they understood—and inspired them to fight for liberty.&quot; Mayer argues, &quot;Henry had forged a popular and partisan political style whose democratic implications took another generation to realize fully and accept. His career pointed the transition from the political squirearchy of the eighteenth century to the mass politics of Andrew Jackson&#x27;s day&quot;. In his study of Henry&#x27;s oratory, David A. McCants suggests that Henry&#x27;s position as great American orator of his day was not so much because of his &quot;heroism and eloquence&quot; but for adapting the clashing philosophies, religious and political, that met in Henry&#x27;s Virginia, to create a new style of oratory that appealed to the masses. According to Tate, &quot;by his unmatched oratorical powers, by employing a certain common touch to win the unwavering loyalty of his constituents, and by closely identifying with their interests, he almost certainly contributed to making the Revolution a more widely popular movement than it might otherwise have become&quot;. Kidd argues that the historical focus on the quality of Henry&#x27;s oratory may result from a discomfort with the content of his speeches, especially his opposition to the Constitution.

During the Civil War era, both sides claimed Henry as a partisan, abolitionists citing his writings against slavery, and those sympathetic to the Southern cause pointing to his hostility to the Constitution. That opposition by Henry came to be seen by many writers, even those friendly to Henry, as a blot on an otherwise admirable career. Beeman, writing in 1986, just before the Constitution&#x27;s bicentennial, predicted that during that anniversary, &quot;it will be hard to avoid depicting Henry as one of history&#x27;s losers, as one too short-sighted to see beyond the bounds of his own native state to glimpse the promise of national greatness embodied in the federal Constitution.&quot;

Henry has been cited as a hero to both Left and Right but has become a particular favorite of the latter. He is especially attractive to Christian conservatives, who cite his deep religious beliefs as well as his writings and speeches in favor of Christian virtue and in defense of religious liberty. Because Henry was educated at home by his father, he has become a symbol of the homeschooling movement. In 2000, Patrick Henry College was founded in Purcellville, Virginia, in large part for those who had been homeschooled. Although Henry&#x27;s most famous declaration has proved as adaptable as ever in the hands of the Right (one sign at a Tea Party rally in 2010 read &quot;Give Me Liberty or Give Me Debt&quot;), according to Kidd, &quot;few Americans today, Tea Partiers or others, take seriously Henry&#x27;s fundamental criticisms of the Constitution.&quot;

Tate writes of Henry, &quot;Of the numerous leaders who were active largely at the state level and who generally opposed ratification of the Federal Constitution, Henry was one of the few who came to be ranked among the truly major figures of the American Revolution.&quot; Kukla concurs, noting that except for two years in the Continental Congress, Henry never held national office, &quot;and yet he was a founder of the republic&quot;. Kidd notes the hazy view of Henry that Americans today have:

<text>John Butler Yeats RHA (16 March 1839 – 3 February 1922) was an Irish artist and the father of W. B. Yeats, Lily Yeats, Elizabeth Corbett &quot;Lollie&quot; Yeats and Jack Butler Yeats. The National Gallery of Ireland holds a number of his portraits in oil and works on paper, including one of his portraits of his son William, painted in 1900.

==Career==
Yeats was born in Lawrencetown, townland of Tullylish, County Down. His parents were William Butler Yeats (1806–1862) and Jane Grace Corbert; John Butler Yeats was the eldest of nine children. Educated at Trinity College Dublin, and a member of the University Philosophical Society, John Butler Yeats began his career as a lawyer and devilled briefly with Isaac Butt before he took up painting in 1867 and studied at the Heatherley School of Fine Art. After John Butler Yeats returned to Ireland in 1881, he began to exhibit paintings at the Royal Hibernian Academy, which elected him a member (RHA) in 1892. There are few records of his sales, so there is no catalogue of his work in private collections. It is possible that some of his early work may have been destroyed by fire in World War II. It is clear that he had no trouble getting commissions as his sketches and oils are found in private homes in Ireland, England and America. His later portraits show great sensitivity to the sitter. However, he was a poor businessman and was never financially secure. He moved house frequently and shifted several times between England and Ireland.

In 1907, at the age of 68, he travelled to New York aboard the &quot;&quot; with his daughter Lily and never returned to Ireland. In October 1909 he moved into his final home, a boarding house run by the Petitpas sisters which was located at 317 West 29th Street. In New York, he was friendly with members of the Ashcan School of painters. He died in the boarding house on 3 February 1922. Edmund Quinn made a death mask which is now in the collection of the Yeats Society in Sligo. John Butler Yeats is buried in Chestertown Rural Cemetery in Chestertown, New York, next to his friend, Jeanne Robert Foster.

==Family==
Yeats married Susan Pollexfen (13 July 1841 – 3 January 1900) on 10 September 1863 at St. John&#x27;s Church, Sligo. Susan Yeats was dismayed when her husband abandoned the study of law to become an artist. Susan is described as a &quot;shadowy figure&quot; who went &quot;quietly, pitifully, mad&quot;.

John and Susan had three sons and three daughters, including writer William Butler Yeats and artists Jack Butler Yeats, Susan Mary &quot;Lily&quot; Yeats, and Elizabeth Corbet &quot;Lollie&quot; Yeats.

<text>In fiction, a character is a person or other being in a narrative (such as a novel, play, radio or television series, music, film, or video game). The character may be entirely fictional or based on a real-life person, in which case the distinction of a &quot;fictional&quot; versus &quot;real&quot; character may be made. Derived from the Ancient Greek word , the English word dates from the Restoration, although it became widely used after its appearance in &quot;Tom Jones&quot; by Henry Fielding in 1749. From this, the sense of &quot;a part played by an actor&quot; developed. (Before this development, the term &quot;dramatis personae&quot;, naturalized in English from Latin and meaning &quot;masks of the drama&quot;, encapsulated the notion of characters from the literal aspect of masks.) A character, particularly when enacted by an actor in the theater or cinema, involves &quot;the illusion of being a human person&quot;. In literature, characters guide readers through their stories, helping them to understand plots and ponder themes. Since the end of the 18th century, the phrase &quot;&quot; has been used to describe an effective impersonation by an actor. Since the 19th century, the art of creating characters, as practiced by actors or writers, has been called characterization. 

A character who stands as a representative of a particular class or group of people is known as a type. Types include both stock characters and those that are more fully individualized. The characters in Henrik Ibsen&#x27;s (1891) and August Strindberg&#x27;s &quot;Miss Julie&quot; (1888), for example, are representative of specific positions in the social relations of class and gender, such that the conflicts between the characters reveal ideological conflicts.

The study of a character requires an analysis of its relations with all of the other characters in the work. The individual status of a character is defined through the network of oppositions (proairetic, pragmatic, linguistic, proxemic) that it forms with the other characters. The relation between characters and the action of the story shifts historically, often miming shifts in society and its ideas about human individuality, self-determination, and the social order.

==Creation==
In fiction writing, authors create dynamic characters using various methods. Sometimes characters are conjured up from imagination; in other instances, they are created by amplifying the character trait of a real person into a new fictional creation.

=== Real people, in part or in full ===
An author or creator basing a character on a real person can use a person they know, a historical figure, a current figure whom they have not met, or themselves, with the latter being either an author-surrogate or an example of self-insertion. The use of a famous person easily identifiable with certain character traits as the base for a principal character is a feature of allegorical works, such as &quot;Animal Farm&quot; by George Orwell, which portrays Soviet revolutionaries as pigs. Other authors, especially for historical fiction, make use of real people and create fictional stories revolving around their lives, as with &quot;The Paris Wife&quot; which revolves around Ernest Hemingway.

=== Archetypes and stock characters ===

An author can create a character using the basic character archetypes which are common to many cultural traditions: the father figure, mother figure, hero, and so on. Some writers make use of archetypes as presented by Carl Jung as the basis for character traits. Generally, when an archetype from some system (such as Jung&#x27;s) is used, elements of the story also follow the system&#x27;s expectations in terms of storyline.

An author can also create a fictional character using generic stock characters, which are generally flat. They tend to be used for supporting or minor characters. However, some authors have used stock characters as the starting point for building richly detailed characters, such as William Shakespeare&#x27;s use of the boastful soldier character as the basis for John Falstaff.

Some authors create charactonyms for their characters. A charactonym is a name that implies the psychological makeup of the person, makes an allegorical allusion, or makes reference to their appearance. For example, Shakespeare has an emotional young male character named Mercutio, John Steinbeck has a kind, sweet character named Candy in &quot;Of Mice and Men&quot;, and Mervyn Peake has a Machiavellian, manipulative, and murderous villain in &quot;Gormenghast&quot; named Steerpike. The charactonym can also indicate appearance. For example, François Rabelais gave the name Gargantua to a giant, and the huge whale in &quot;Pinocchio&quot; (1940) is named Monstro.

==Types==
===Round vs. flat=== 
In his book &quot;Aspects of the Novel&quot;, E. M. Forster defined two basic types of characters, their qualities, functions, and importance for the development of the novel: flat characters and round characters. Flat characters are two-dimensional, in that they are relatively uncomplicated. By contrast, round characters are complex figures with many different characteristics, that undergo development, sometimes sufficiently to surprise the reader.

In psychological terms, round or complex characters may be considered to have five personality dimensions under the Big Five model of personality. The five factors are:
* extraversion (outgoing/energetic vs. solitary/reserved)
* agreeableness (friendly/compassionate vs. critical/rational)
* openness to experience (inventive/curious vs. consistent/cautious)
* conscientiousness (efficient/organized vs. extravagant/careless)
* neuroticism (sensitive/nervous vs. resilient/confident)

Stock characters are usually one-dimensional and thin. Mary Sues are characters that usually appear in fan fiction which are virtually devoid of flaws, and are therefore considered flat characters.

Another type of flat character is a &quot;walk-on&quot;, a term used by Seymour Chatman for characters that are not fully delineated and individualized; rather they are part of the background or the setting of the narrative.

===Dynamic vs. static===

Dynamic characters are those that change over the course of the story, while static characters remain the same throughout. An example of a popular dynamic character in literature is Ebenezer Scrooge, the protagonist of &quot;A Christmas Carol&quot; by Charles Dickens. At the start of the story, he is a bitter miser, but by the end of the tale, he transforms into a kindhearted, generous man.

===Regular, recurring and guest characters===
In television, a regular, main or ongoing character is a character who appears in all or a majority of episodes, or in a significant chain of episodes of the series. Regular characters may be both core and secondary ones.

A recurring character or supporting character often and frequently appears from time to time during the series&#x27; run. Recurring characters often play major roles in more than one episode, sometimes being the main focus.

A guest or minor character is one who acts only in a few episodes or scenes. Unlike regular characters, the guest ones do not need to be carefully incorporated into the storyline with all its ramifications: they create a piece of drama and then disappear without consequences to the narrative structure, unlike core characters, for which any significant conflict must be traced during a considerable time, which is often seen as an unjustified waste of resources. There may also be a continuing or recurring guest character. Sometimes a guest or minor character may gain unanticipated popularity and turn into a regular or main one; this is known as a breakout character.

==Classical analysis==
In the earliest surviving work of dramatic theory, &quot;Poetics&quot; (), the Classical Greek philosopher Aristotle states that character (&quot;ethos&quot;) is one of six qualitative parts of Athenian tragedy and one of the three objects that it represents (1450a12). He understands character not to denote a fictional person, but the quality of the person acting in the story and reacting to its situations (1450a5). He defines character as &quot;that which reveals decision, of whatever sort&quot; (1450b8). It is possible, therefore, to have stories that do not contain &quot;characters&quot; in Aristotle&#x27;s sense of the word, since character necessarily involves making the ethical dispositions of those performing the action clear. If, in speeches, the speaker &quot;decides or avoids nothing at all&quot;, then those speeches &quot;do not have character&quot; (1450b9—11). Aristotle argues for the primacy of plot (&quot;mythos&quot;) over character (&quot;ethos&quot;). He writes:

Aristotle suggests that works were distinguished in the first instance according to the nature of the person who created them: &quot;the grander people represented fine actions, i.e. those of fine persons&quot; by producing &quot;hymns and praise-poems&quot;, while &quot;ordinary people represented those of inferior ones&quot; by &quot;composing invectives&quot; (1448b20—1449a5). On this basis, a distinction between the individuals represented in tragedy and in comedy arose: tragedy, along with epic poetry, is &quot;a representation of serious people&quot; (1449b9—10), while comedy is &quot;a representation of people who are rather inferior&quot; (1449a32—33).

In the &quot;Tractatus coislinianus&quot; (which may or may not be by Aristotle), Ancient Greek comedy is defined as involving three types of characters: the buffoon (&#x27;), the ironist (&#x27;), and the imposter or boaster (). All three are central to Aristophanes&#x27; Old Comedy.

By the time the Roman comic playwright Plautus wrote his plays two centuries later, the use of characters to define dramatic genres was well established. His &quot;Amphitryon&quot; begins with a prologue in which Mercury claims that since the play contains kings and gods, it cannot be a comedy and must be a tragicomedy.

<text>The Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), also known as the DR Congo, Congo-Kinshasa, or simply the Congo, is a country in Central Africa. By land area, it is the second-largest country in Africa and the 11th-largest in the world. With a population of around 111 million, the Democratic Republic of the Congo is the most populous nominally Francophone country in the world. The national capital and largest city is Kinshasa, which is also the economic center. The country is bordered by the Republic of the Congo; Central African Republic; South Sudan; Uganda; Rwanda; Burundi; Tanzania (across Lake Tanganyika); Zambia; Angola; the Cabinda exclave of Angola; and the South Atlantic Ocean.

Centered on the Congo Basin, the territory of the Congo was first inhabited by Central African foragers around 90,000 years ago and was settled in the Bantu expansion about 2,000 to 3,000 years ago. In the west, the Kingdom of Kongo ruled around the mouth of the Congo River from the 14th to 19th centuries. In the center and east, the empires of Mwene Muji, Luba, and Lunda ruled from the 15th, 16th, and 17th centuries to the late 19th and early 20th centuries. King Leopold II of Belgium formally acquired rights to the Congo territory from the colonial nations of Europe in 1885 and declared the land his private property, naming it the Congo Free State. From 1885 to 1908, his colonial military forced the local population to produce rubber and committed widespread atrocities. In 1908, Leopold ceded the territory, which thus became a Belgian colony.

Congo achieved independence from Belgium on 30 June 1960 and was immediately confronted by a series of secessionist movements, the assassination of Prime Minister Patrice Lumumba, and the seizure of power by Mobutu Sese Seko in a 1965 coup d&#x27;état. Mobutu renamed the country Zaire in 1971 and imposed a harsh personalist dictatorship until his overthrow in 1997 by the First Congo War. The country then had its name changed back and was confronted by the Second Congo War from 1998 to 2003, which resulted in the deaths of 5.4 million people and the assassination of President Laurent-Désiré Kabila. The war ended under President Joseph Kabila, who governed the country from 2001 to 2019 and under whom human rights in the country remained poor and included frequent abuses such as forced disappearances, torture, arbitrary imprisonment and restrictions on civil liberties.

Following the 2018 general election, in the country&#x27;s first peaceful transition of power since independence, Kabila was succeeded as president in a highly contentious election won by Félix Tshisekedi, who has served as president since. Eastern Congo has remained unstable since the Congo Wars and has been the site of an ongoing military conflict involving over 100 armed groups. One of the region&#x27;s largest cities, Goma, was occupied by the March 23 Movement (M23) rebels in 2012 and again in 2025. Since 2022, there has also been conflict between the DRC and Rwanda, which has been providing military support to M23 and sending troops into Congolese territory.

The Democratic Republic of the Congo is extremely rich in natural resources but has suffered from political instability, a lack of infrastructure, corruption, and centuries of both commercial and colonial extraction and exploitation, followed by more than 60 years of independence, with little widespread development; the nation is a potential example of the &quot;resource curse&quot;. Besides the capital Kinshasa, the two next largest cities, Lubumbashi and Mbuji-Mayi, are both mining communities. The DRC&#x27;s largest export is raw minerals, with China having accepted over 50% of its exports in 2019. In 2025, DR Congo&#x27;s level of human development was ranked 180th out of 193 countries by the Human Development Index and is classified as being one of the least developed countries by the United Nations (UN). , following two decades of various civil wars and continued internal conflicts, around 600,000 Congolese refugees were still living in neighbouring countries. Two million children risk starvation, and the fighting has displaced 4.5 million people. The country is a member of the United Nations, Non-Aligned Movement, African Union, COMESA, Southern African Development Community, , and Economic Community of Central African States.

==Etymology==

The Democratic Republic of the Congo is named after the Congo River, which flows through the country. The Congo River is the world&#x27;s deepest river and the world&#x27;s third-largest river by discharge. The &quot;Comité d&#x27;études du haut Congo&quot; (&quot;Committee for the Study of the Upper Congo&quot;), established by King Leopold II of Belgium in 1876, and the International Association of the Congo, established by him in 1879, were also named after the river.

The Congo River was named by early European sailors after the Kingdom of Kongo and its Bantu inhabitants, the Kongo people, when they encountered them in the 16th century. The word &quot;Kongo&quot; comes from the Kongo language (also called &quot;Kikongo&quot;). According to American writer Samuel Henry Nelson: &quot;It is probable that the word &#x27;Kongo&#x27; itself implies a public gathering and that it is based on the root &quot;konga&quot;, &#x27;to gather&#x27; (trans[itive]).&quot; The modern name of the Kongo people, &quot;Bakongo&quot;, was introduced in the early 20th century.

The Democratic Republic of the Congo has been known in the past as, in chronological order, the Congo Free State, Belgian Congo, the Republic of the Congo-Léopoldville, the Democratic Republic of the Congo and the Republic of Zaire, before returning to its current name the Democratic Republic of the Congo.

At the time of independence, the country was named the Republic of the Congo-Léopoldville to distinguish it from its neighbour Congo, officially the Republic of the Congo. With the promulgation of the Luluabourg Constitution on 1 August 1964, the country became the DRC but was renamed Zaire (a past name for the Congo River) on 27 October 1971 by President Mobutu Sese Seko as part of his &quot;Authenticité&quot; initiative.

The word &quot;Zaire&quot; is from a Portuguese adaptation of a Kikongo word &quot;nzadi&quot; (&quot;river&quot;), a truncation of &quot;nzadi o nzere&quot; (&quot;river swallowing rivers&quot;). The river was known as &quot;Zaire&quot; during the 16th and 17th centuries; &quot;Congo&quot; seems to have replaced &quot;Zaire&quot; gradually in English usage during the 18th century, and &quot;Congo&quot; is the preferred English name in 19th-century literature, although references to &quot;Zaire&quot; as the name used by the natives (i.e., derived from Portuguese usage) remained common.

In 1992, the Sovereign National Conference voted to change the name of the country to the &quot;Democratic Republic of the Congo&quot;, but the change was not made. The country&#x27;s name was later restored by President Laurent-Désiré Kabila when he overthrew Mobutu in 1997. To distinguish it from the neighboring Republic of the Congo, it is sometimes referred to as &quot;Congo (Kinshasa)&quot;, &quot;Congo-Kinshasa&quot;, or &quot;Big Congo&quot;. Its name is sometimes also abbreviated as &quot;Congo DR&quot;, &quot;DR Congo&quot;, &quot;DRC&quot;, &quot;the DROC&quot;, and &quot;RDC&quot; (in French).

==History==

Before Bantu expansion, the territory comprising the Democratic Republic of the Congo was home to Central Africa&#x27;s oldest settled groups, the Mbuti peoples. Most of the remnants of their hunter-gatherer culture remain in the present time.

===Early history===
The geographical area now known as the Democratic Republic of the Congo was populated as early as 90,000 years ago, as shown by the 1988 discovery of the Semliki harpoon at Katanda, one of the oldest barbed harpoons ever found, believed to have been used to catch giant river catfish.

Bantu peoples reached Central Africa at some point during the first millennium BC, then gradually started to expand southward. Their propagation was accelerated by the adoption of pastoralism and of Iron Age techniques. The people living in the south and southwest were foraging groups, whose technology involved only minimal use of metal technologies. The development of metal tools during this time period revolutionized agriculture. This led to the displacement of the African pygmies. Following the Bantu migrations, a period of state and class formation began circa 700 with three centres in the modern-day territory; one to the west around Pool Malebo, one east around Lake Mai-Ndombe, and a third even further east and south around the Upemba Depression.

By the 13th century, there were three main confederations of states in the western Congo Basin around Pool Malebo. In the east were the Seven Kingdoms of Kongo dia Nlaza, considered to be the oldest and most powerful, which likely included Nsundi, Mbata, Mpangu, and possibly Kundi and Okanga. South of these was Mpemba which stretched from modern-day Angola to the Congo River. It included various kingdoms such as Mpemba Kasi and Vunda. To its west across the Congo River was a confederation of three small states; Vungu (its leader), Kakongo, and Ngoyo.

The Kingdom of Kongo was founded in the 14th century and dominated the western region. The empire of Mwene Muji was founded around Lake Mai-Ndombe. From the Upemba Depression the Luba Empire and Lunda Empire emerged in the 15th and 17th centuries respectfully dominated the eastern region.

===Congo Free State (1877–1908)===

Belgian exploration and administration took place from the 1870s until the 1920s. It was first led by Henry Morton Stanley, who undertook his explorations under the sponsorship of King Leopold II of Belgium. The eastern regions of the precolonial Congo were heavily disrupted by constant slave raiding, mainly from Arab–Swahili slave traders such as the infamous Tippu Tip, who was well known to Stanley.

Leopold had designs on what was to become the Congo as a colony. In a succession of negotiations, Leopold, professing humanitarian objectives in his capacity as chairman of the front organization &quot;Association Internationale Africaine&quot;, actually played one European rival against another.

King Leopold formally acquired rights to the Congo territory at the Conference of Berlin in 1885 and made the land his private property. He named it the Congo Free State. Leopold&#x27;s regime began various infrastructure projects, such as the construction of the railway that ran from the coast to the capital of Leopoldville (now Kinshasa), which took eight years to complete.

In the Free State, colonists coerced the local population into producing rubber, for which the spread of automobiles and development of rubber tires created a growing international market. Rubber sales made a fortune for Leopold, who built several buildings in Brussels and Ostend to honor himself and his country. To enforce the rubber quotas, the &quot;Force Publique&quot; was called in and made the practice of cutting off the limbs of the natives a matter of policy.

Under the Congo Free State concessions were granted to private industry, granting a monopoly over violence and resource extraction. The most violent of these concession regions, were surrounding rubber plantations. Concession regions would align with villages, employing local chiefs to aid in enforce strict quotas. Failure to comply or to meet quotas would result in kidnaping of family, held ransom until quotas could be met or physical violence. Violence was carried out by &quot;village sentries,&quot; European militias employed to ensure collection. These sentries were granted full impunity for violence, without proper oversight were known to kill and eat underperforming workers.

During 1885–1908, millions of Congolese died as a consequence of exploitation and disease. In some areas the population declined dramatically – it has been estimated that sleeping sickness and smallpox killed nearly half the population in the areas surrounding the lower Congo River.

News of the abuses began to circulate. In 1904, the British consul at Boma in the Congo, Roger Casement, was instructed by the British government to investigate. His report, called the Casement Report, confirmed the accusations of humanitarian abuses. The Belgian Parliament forced Leopold II to set up an independent commission of inquiry. Its findings confirmed Casement&#x27;s report of abuses, concluding that the population of the Congo had been &quot;reduced by half&quot; during this period. Determining precisely how many people died is impossible, as no accurate records exist.

===Belgian Congo (1908–1960)===


In 1908, the Belgian parliament, in spite of initial reluctance, bowed to international pressure (especially from the United Kingdom) and took over the Free State from King Leopold II. On 18 October 1908, the Belgian parliament voted in favour of annexing the Congo as a Belgian colony. Executive power went to the Belgian minister of colonial affairs, assisted by a Colonial Council (Conseil Colonial) (both located in Brussels). The Belgian parliament exercised legislative authority over the Belgian Congo. In 1923 the colonial capital moved from Boma to Léopoldville, some further upstream into the interior. The transition from the Congo Free State to the Belgian Congo was a break, but it also featured a large degree of continuity. The last governor-general of the Congo Free State, Baron Théophile Wahis, remained in office in the Belgian Congo and the majority of Leopold II&#x27;s administration with him. Opening up the Congo and its natural and mineral riches to the Belgian economy remained the main motive for colonial expansion – however, other priorities, such as healthcare and basic education, slowly gained in importance.

Colonial administrators ruled the territory and a dual legal system existed (a system of European courts and another one of indigenous courts, &quot;tribunaux indigènes&quot;). Indigenous courts had only limited powers and remained under the firm control of the colonial administration. The Belgian authorities permitted no political activity in the Congo whatsoever, and the &quot;Force Publique&quot; put down any attempts at rebellion.

The Belgian Congo was directly involved in the two world wars. During World War I (1914–1918), an initial stand-off between the &quot;Force Publique&quot; and the German colonial army in German East Africa turned into open warfare with a joint Anglo-Belgian-Portuguese invasion of German colonial territory in 1916 and 1917 during the East African campaign. The &quot;Force Publique&quot; gained a notable victory when it marched into Tabora in September 1916 under the command of General Charles Tombeur after heavy fighting.

After 1918, Belgium was rewarded for the participation of the &quot;Force Publique&quot; in the East African campaign with a League of Nations mandate over the previously German colony of Ruanda-Urundi. During World War II, the Belgian Congo provided a crucial source of income for the Belgian government in exile in London, and the &quot;Force Publique&quot; again participated in Allied campaigns in Africa. Belgian Congolese forces under the command of Belgian officers notably fought against the Italian colonial army in Ethiopia in Asosa, Bortaï and Saïo under Major-General Auguste-Eduard Gilliaert.

===Independence and political crisis (1960–1965)===

In May 1960, a growing nationalist movement, the Mouvement National Congolais led by Patrice Lumumba, won the parliamentary elections. Lumumba became the first Prime Minister of the Republic of the Congo, on 24 June 1960. The parliament elected Joseph Kasa-Vubu as president, of the Alliance des Bakongo (ABAKO) party. Other parties that emerged included the Parti Solidaire Africain led by Antoine Gizenga, and the Parti National du Peuple led by Albert Delvaux and Laurent Mbariko.

The Belgian Congo achieved independence on 30 June 1960 under the name &quot;République du Congo&quot; (&quot;Republic of Congo&quot; or &quot;Republic of the Congo&quot; in English). Shortly after, on 15 August 1960, the neighboring French colony of Middle Congo also gained independence and adopted the same name, &#x27;Republic of Congo.&#x27; To avoid confusion between the two, the former Belgian Congo became known as the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DR Congo), while the former French colony retained the name &#x27;Republic of the Congo&#x27; (Congo).

Shortly after independence the &quot;Force Publique&quot; mutinied, and on 11 July the province of Katanga (led by Moïse Tshombe) and South Kasai engaged in secessionist struggles against the new leadership. Most of the 100,000 Europeans who had remained behind after independence fled the country. After the United Nations rejected Lumumba&#x27;s call for help to put down the secessionist movements, Lumumba asked for assistance from the Soviet Union, who accepted and sent military supplies and advisers. On 23 August, the Congolese armed forces invaded South Kasai. Lumumba was dismissed from office on 5 September 1960 by Kasa-Vubu who publicly blamed him for massacres by the armed forces in South Kasai and for involving Soviets in the country. On 7 September, Lumumba made a speech to the Congolese House of Representatives, arguing his dismissal was illegal under the nation&#x27;s laws. Congolese law gave parliament, not the president, the authority to dismiss a government minister. The House and Senate both rejected the dismissal of Lumumba, but the removal proceeded unconstitutionally.

On 14 September, Colonel Joseph Mobutu, with the backing of the US and Belgium, removed Lumumba from office. On 17 January 1961, Lumumba was handed over to Katangan authorities and executed by Belgian-led Katangan troops. A 2001 investigation by Belgium&#x27;s Parliament found Belgium &quot;morally responsible&quot; for the murder of Lumumba, and the country has since officially apologised for its role in his death.

On 18 September 1961, in ongoing negotiations of a ceasefire, a plane crash near Ndola resulted in the death of Dag Hammarskjöld, the Secretary-General of the United Nations, along with all 15 passengers, setting off a succession crisis. Amidst widespread confusion and chaos, a temporary government was led by technicians (the Collège des commissaires généraux). Katangan secession ended in January 1963 with the assistance of UN forces. Several short-lived governments of Joseph Ileo, Cyrille Adoula, and Moise Kapenda Tshombe took over in quick succession.

Meanwhile, in the east of the country, Soviet and Cuban-backed rebels called the Simbas rose up, taking a significant amount of territory and proclaiming a communist &quot;People&#x27;s Republic of the Congo&quot; in Stanleyville. The Simbas were pushed out of Stanleyville in November 1964 during Operation Dragon Rouge, a military operation conducted by Belgian and American forces to rescue hundreds of hostages. Congolese government forces fully defeated the Simba rebels by November 1965.

Lumumba had previously appointed Mobutu chief of staff of the new Congo army, Armée Nationale Congolaise. Taking advantage of the leadership crisis between Kasavubu and Tshombe, Mobutu garnered enough support within the army to launch a coup. A constitutional referendum the year before Mobutu&#x27;s coup of 1965 resulted in the country&#x27;s official name being changed to the &quot;Democratic Republic of the Congo&quot;. In 1971 Mobutu changed the name again, this time to &quot;Republic of Zaire&quot;.

===Mobutu autocracy and Zaire (1965–1997)===

Mobutu had the staunch support of the United States because of his opposition to communism; the U.S. believed that his administration would serve as an effective counter to communist movements in Africa. A single-party system was established, and Mobutu declared himself head of state. He periodically held elections in which he was the only candidate. Although relative peace and stability were achieved, Mobutu&#x27;s government was guilty of severe human rights violations, political repression, a cult of personality and corruption.

By late 1967, Mobutu had successfully neutralized his political opponents and rivals, either through co-opting them into his regime, arresting them, or rendering them otherwise politically impotent. Throughout the late 1960s, Mobutu continued to shuffle his governments and cycle officials in and out of the office to maintain control. Joseph Kasa-Vubu&#x27;s death in April 1969 ensured that no person with First Republic credentials could challenge his rule. By the early 1970s, Mobutu was attempting to assert Zaire as a leading African nation. He traveled frequently across the continent while the government became more vocal about African issues, particularly those relating to the southern region. Zaire established semi-clientelist relationships with several smaller African states, especially Burundi, Chad, and Togo.

Corruption became so common the term &quot;le mal Zairois&quot; or &quot;Zairian sickness&quot;, meaning gross corruption, theft and mismanagement, was coined, reportedly by Mobutu. International aid, most often in the form of loans, enriched Mobutu while he allowed national infrastructure such as roads to deteriorate to as little as one-quarter of what had existed in 1960. Zaire became a kleptocracy as Mobutu and his associates embezzled government funds.
In a campaign to identify himself with African nationalism, starting on 1 June 1966, Mobutu renamed the nation&#x27;s cities: Léopoldville became Kinshasa (the country was known as Congo-Kinshasa), Stanleyville became Kisangani, Elisabethville became Lubumbashi, and Coquilhatville became Mbandaka. In 1971, Mobutu renamed the country the &quot;Republic of Zaire&quot;, its fourth name change in eleven years and its sixth overall. The Congo River was renamed the Zaire River.

During the 1970s and 1980s, Mobutu was invited to visit the United States on several occasions, meeting with U.S. Presidents Richard Nixon, Ronald Reagan and George H. W. Bush. Following the dissolution of the Soviet Union U.S. relations with Mobutu cooled, as he was no longer deemed necessary as a Cold War ally. Opponents within Zaire stepped up demands for reform. This atmosphere contributed to Mobutu&#x27;s declaring the Third Republic in 1990, whose constitution was supposed to pave the way for democratic reform. The reforms turned out to be largely cosmetic. Mobutu continued in power until armed forces forced him to flee in 1997. &quot;From 1990 to 1993, the United States facilitated Mobutu&#x27;s attempts to hijack political change&quot;, one academic wrote, and &quot;also assisted the rebellion of Laurent-Desire Kabila that overthrew the Mobutu regime.&quot;

In September 1997, Mobutu died in exile in Morocco.

===Continental and civil wars (1996–2007)===
By 1996, following the Rwandan Civil War and genocide and the ascension of a Tutsi-led government in Rwanda, Rwandan Hutu militia forces (Interahamwe) fled to eastern Zaire and used refugee camps as bases for incursions against Rwanda. They allied with the Zairian Armed Forces to launch a campaign against Congolese ethnic Tutsis in eastern Zaire.

A coalition of Rwandan and Ugandan armies invaded Zaire to overthrow the government of Mobutu, launching the First Congo War. The coalition allied with some opposition figures, led by Laurent-Désiré Kabila, becoming the Alliance of Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Congo. In 1997 Mobutu fled and Kabila marched into Kinshasa, naming himself as president and reverting the name of the country to the Democratic Republic of the Congo.

Kabila later requested that foreign military forces return to their own countries. Rwandan troops retreated to Goma and launched a new Tutsi-led rebel military movement called the Rassemblement Congolais pour la Democratie to fight Kabila, while Uganda instigated the creation of a rebel movement called the Movement for the Liberation of the Congo, led by Congolese warlord Jean-Pierre Bemba. The two rebel movements, along with Rwandan and Ugandan troops, started the Second Congo War by attacking the DRC army in 1998. Angolan, Zimbabwean, and Namibian militaries entered the hostilities on the side of the government.

Kabila was assassinated in 2001. His son Joseph Kabila succeeded him and called for multilateral peace talks. UN peacekeepers, MONUC, now known as MONUSCO, arrived in April 2001. In 2002–03, Bemba intervened in the Central African Republic on behalf of its former president, Ange-Félix Patassé. Talks led to a peace accord under which Kabila would share power with former rebels. By June 2003 all foreign armies except those of Rwanda had pulled out of Congo. A transitional government was set up until after the election. A constitution was approved by voters; further, on 30 July 2006, DRC held its first multi-party elections. These were the first free national elections since 1960, which many believed would mark the end to violence in the region. However, an election-result dispute between Kabila and Bemba turned into a skirmish between their supporters in Kinshasa. MONUC took control of the city. A new election took place in October 2006, which Kabila won, and in December 2006 he was sworn in as president.
=== Continued conflicts (2008–2018) ===
 Laurent Nkunda, a member of Rally for Congolese Democracy–Goma, defected along with troops loyal to him and formed the National Congress for the Defence of the People (CNDP), which began an armed rebellion against the government. In March 2009, after a deal between the DRC and Rwanda, Rwandan troops entered the DRC and arrested Nkunda and were allowed to pursue FDLR militants. The CNDP signed a peace treaty with the government in which it agreed to become a political party and to have its soldiers integrated into the national army in exchange for the release of its imprisoned members. In 2012 Bosco Ntaganda, the leader of the CNDP, and troops loyal to him, mutinied and formed the rebel military March 23 Movement (M23), claiming the government had violated the treaty.

In the resulting M23 rebellion, M23 briefly captured the provincial capital of Goma in November 2012. Neighboring countries, particularly Rwanda, have been accused of arming rebel groups and using them as proxies to gain control of the resource-rich country, an accusation they deny. In March 2013, the United Nations Security Council authorized the United Nations Force Intervention Brigade to neutralize armed groups. On 5 November 2013, M23 declared an end to its insurgency. Additionally, in northern Katanga, the Mai-Mai created by Laurent Kabila slipped out of the control of Kinshasa with Gédéon Kyungu Mutanga&#x27;s Mai Mai Kata Katanga briefly invading the provincial capital of Lubumbashi in 2013 and 400,000 persons displaced in the province . On and off fighting in the Ituri conflict occurred between the Nationalist and Integrationist Front and the Union of Congolese Patriots who claimed to represent the Lendu and Hema ethnic groups, respectively. In the northeast, Joseph Kony&#x27;s Lord&#x27;s Resistance Army moved from their original bases in Uganda and South Sudan to DR Congo in 2005 and set up camps in the Garamba National Park.
The war in the Congo has been described as the bloodiest war since World War II. In 2009, &quot;The New York Times&quot; reported that people in the Congo continued to die at a rate of an estimated 45,000 per month – estimates of the number who have died from the long conflict range from 900,000 to 5,400,000. The death toll is caused by widespread disease and famine; reports indicate that almost half of the individuals who have died are children under five years of age. There have been frequent reports of weapon bearers killing civilians, of the destruction of property, of widespread sexual violence, causing hundreds of thousands of people to flee their homes, and of other breaches of humanitarian and human rights law. One study found that more than 400,000 women are raped in the Democratic Republic of Congo every year. In 2018 and 2019, Congo reported the highest levels of sexual violence in the world. According to the Human Rights Watch and the New York University-based Congo Research Group, armed troops in DRC&#x27;s eastern Kivu region have killed over 1,900 civilians and kidnapped at least 3,300 people since June 2017 to June 2019. On 10 May 2018, Congolese gynecologist Denis Mukwege was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for his effort to end the use of sexual violence as a weapon of war and armed conflict.

In 2015, major protests broke out across the country and protesters demanded that Kabila step down as president. The protests began after the passage of a law by the Congolese lower house that, if also passed by the Congolese upper house, would keep Kabila in power at least until a national census was conducted (a process which would likely take several years and therefore keep him in power past the planned 2016 elections, which he is constitutionally barred from participating in). This bill passed; however, it was gutted of the provision that would keep Kabila in power until a census took place. A census is supposed to take place, but it is no longer tied to when the elections take place. In 2015, elections were scheduled for late 2016 and a tenuous peace held in the Congo. On 27 November 2016 Congolese foreign minister Raymond Tshibanda told the press no elections would be held in 2016: &quot;it has been decided that the voter registration operation will end on July 31, 2017, and that election will take place in April 2018.&quot; Protests broke out in the country on 20 December when Kabila&#x27;s term in office ended. Across the country, dozens of protesters were killed and hundreds were arrested.

According to Jan Egeland, presently Secretary-General of the Norwegian Refugee Council, the situation in the DRC became much worse in 2016 and 2017 and is a major moral and humanitarian challenge comparable to the wars in Syria and Yemen, which receive much more attention. Women and children are abused sexually and &quot;abused in all possible manners&quot;. Besides the conflict in North Kivu, violence increased in the Kasai region. The armed groups were after gold, diamonds, oil, and cobalt to line the pockets of rich men both in the region and internationally. There were also ethnic and cultural rivalries at play, as well as religious motives and the political crisis with postponed elections. Egeland says people believe the situation in the DRC is &quot;stably bad&quot; but in fact, it has become much, much worse. &quot;The big wars of the Congo that were really on top of the agenda 15 years ago are back and worsening&quot;. Disruption in planting and harvesting caused by the conflict was estimated to escalate starvation in about two million children.

Human Rights Watch said in 2017 that Kabila recruited former 23 March Movement fighters to put down country-wide protests over his refusal to step down from office at the end of his term. &quot;M23 fighters patrolled the streets of Congo&#x27;s main cities, firing on or arresting protesters or anyone else deemed to be a threat to the president,&quot; they said. Fierce fighting has erupted in Masisi between government forces and a powerful local warlord, General Delta. The United Nations mission in the DRC is its largest and most expensive peacekeeping effort, but it shut down five UN bases near Masisi in 2017, after the U.S. led a push to cut costs.

A tribal conflict erupted on 16–17 December 2018 at Yumbi in Mai-Ndombe Province. Nearly 900 Banunu people from four villages were slaughtered by members of the Batende community in a deep-rooted rivalry over monthly tribal duties, land, fields and water resources. Some 100 Banunus fled to Moniende island in the Congo River, and another 16,000 to Makotimpoko District in Republic of Congo. Military-style tactics were employed in the bloodbath, and some assailants were clothed in army uniforms. Local authorities and elements within the security forces were suspected of lending them support.

=== 2018 election and new president (2018–present) ===
On 30 December 2018, a general election was held. On 10 January 2019, the electoral commission announced opposition candidate Félix Tshisekedi as the winner of the presidential vote, and he was officially sworn in as president on 24 January. However, there were widespread suspicions that the results were rigged and that a deal had been made between Tshisekedi and Kabila. The Catholic Church said that the official results did not correspond to the information its election monitors had collected. The government had also &quot;delayed&quot; the vote until March in some areas, citing the Ebola outbreak in Kivu as well as the ongoing military conflict. This was criticized as these regions are known as opposition strongholds. In August 2019, six months after the inauguration of Félix Tshisekedi, a coalition government was announced.

The political allies of Kabila maintained control of key ministries, the legislature, judiciary and security services. However, Tshisekedi succeeded in strengthening his hold on power. In a series of moves, he won over more legislators, gaining the support of almost 400 out of 500 members of the National Assembly. The pro-Kabila speakers of both houses of parliament were forced out. In April 2021, the new government was formed without the supporters of Kabila.

A major measles outbreak in the country left nearly 5,000 dead in 2019. The Ebola outbreak ended in June 2020, after causing 2,280 deaths over 2 years. Another, smaller Ebola outbreak in the Équateur Province began in June 2020, ultimately causing 55 deaths. The global COVID-19 pandemic also reached the DRC in March 2020, with a vaccination campaign beginning on 19 April 2021.

The Italian ambassador to the DRC, Luca Attanasio, and his bodyguard were killed in North Kivu on 22 February 2021. On 22 April 2021, meetings between Kenyan President Uhuru Kenyatta and Tshisekedi resulted in new agreements increasing international trade and security (counterterrorism, immigration, cyber security, and customs) between the two countries. In February 2022, allegations of a coup d&#x27;état in the country led to uncertainty, but the coup attempt failed.

After the 2023 presidential election, Tshisekedi had a clear lead in his run for a second term. On 31 December 2023, officials said that President Felix Tshisekedi had been re-elected with 73% of the vote. Nine opposition candidates signed a declaration rejecting the election and called for a rerun.

In May 2024, during a parliamentary crisis related to the election for the leadership of parliament, Christian Malanga led an attempted coup which was repelled by security forces loyal to President Félix Tshisekedi. Three belligerents reportedly carrying US passports were arrested by security forces, and videos of their capture were shared online.

Due to Rwanda&#x27;s support for the Goma offensive by the M23 rebels, the DRC severed diplomatic ties between the two countries on 26 January 2025. President Tshisekedi called for a national mobilization, urging citizens to rally behind FARDC against what he called &quot;Rwanda&#x27;s barbaric aggression&quot;. Nearly 3,000 people were killed in the fighting in Goma. It was reported that hundreds of female inmates were raped and burned alive during the mass jailbreak from Goma&#x27;s prison.

==Geography==


The DRC is located in central sub-Saharan Africa, bordered to the northwest by the Republic of the Congo, to the north by the Central African Republic, to the northeast by South Sudan, to the east by Uganda, Rwanda and Burundi, and by Tanzania (across Lake Tanganyika), to the south and southeast by Zambia, to the southwest by Angola, and to the west by the South Atlantic Ocean and the Cabinda Province exclave of Angola. The country lies between latitudes 6°N and 14°S, and longitudes 12°E and 32°E. It straddles the Equator, with one-third to the north and two-thirds to the south. With an area of , it is the second-largest country in Africa by area, after Algeria.

As a result of its equatorial location, the DRC experiences high precipitation and has the highest frequency of thunderstorms in the world. The annual rainfall can total upwards of in some places, and the area sustains the Congo rainforest, the second-largest rainforest in the world after the Amazon rainforest. This massive expanse of lush jungle covers most of the vast, low-lying central basin of the river, which slopes toward the Atlantic Ocean in the west. This area is surrounded by plateaus merging into savannas in the south and southwest, by mountainous terraces in the west, and dense grasslands extending beyond the Congo River in the north. The glaciated Rwenzori Mountains are found in the extreme eastern region.
The tropical climate produced the Congo River system which dominates the region topographically along with the rainforest it flows through. The Congo Basin occupies nearly the entire country and an area of nearly . The river and its tributaries form the backbone of Congolese economics and transportation. Major tributaries include the Kasai, Sangha, Ubangi, Ruzizi, Aruwimi, and Lulonga.

The Congo River has the second-largest flow and the second-largest watershed of any river in the world (trailing the Amazon in both respects). The sources of the Congo River are in the Albertine Rift Mountains that flank the western branch of the East African Rift, as well as Lake Tanganyika and Lake Mweru. The river flows generally west from Kisangani just below Boyoma Falls, then gradually bends southwest, passing by Mbandaka, joining with the Ubangi River, and running into the Pool Malebo (Stanley Pool). Kinshasa and Brazzaville are on opposite sides of the river at the Pool. Then the river narrows and falls through a number of cataracts in deep canyons, collectively known as the Livingstone Falls, and runs past Boma into the Atlantic Ocean. The river and a strip of coastline on its north bank provide the country&#x27;s only outlet to the Atlantic.

The Albertine Rift plays a key role in shaping the Congo&#x27;s geography. Not only is the northeastern section of the country much more mountainous, but tectonic movement results in volcanic activity, occasionally with loss of life. The geologic activity in this area also created the African Great Lakes, four of which lie on the Congo&#x27;s eastern frontier: Lake Albert, Lake Kivu, Lake Edward, and Lake Tanganyika.

The rift valley has exposed an enormous amount of mineral wealth throughout the south and east of the Congo, making it accessible to mining. Cobalt, copper, cadmium, industrial and gem-quality diamonds, gold, silver, zinc, manganese, tin, germanium, uranium, radium, bauxite, iron ore, and coal are all found in plentiful supply, especially in the Congo&#x27;s southeastern Katanga region. The gold production in 2015 is 37 metric tonnes.

On 17 January 2002, Mount Nyiragongo erupted, with three streams of extremely fluid lava running out at and wide. One of the three streams flowed directly through Goma, killing 45 people and leaving 120,000 homeless. Over 400,000 people were evacuated from the city during the eruption. The lava flowed into and poisoned the water of Lake Kivu killing its plants, animals and fish. Only two planes left the local airport because of the possibility of the explosion of stored petrol. The lava flowed through and past the airport, destroying a runway and trapping several parked airplanes. Six months after the event, nearby Mount Nyamuragira also erupted. The mountain subsequently erupted again in 2006, and once again in January 2010.

=== Climate change ===
===Biodiversity and conservation===


The rainforests of the Democratic Republic of the Congo contain great biodiversity, including many rare and endemic species, such as the common chimpanzee and the bonobo (or pygmy chimpanzee), the African forest elephant, mountain gorilla, okapi, forest buffalo, leopard and, further south in the country, the southern white rhinoceros. Five of the country&#x27;s national parks are listed as World Heritage Sites: the Garumba, Kahuzi-Biega, Salonga and Virunga National Parks, and the Okapi Wildlife Reserve. The Democratic Republic of the Congo is one of 17 Megadiverse countries and is the most biodiverse African country.

Conservationists have particularly worried about primates. The Congo is inhabited by several great ape species: the common chimpanzee (&quot;Pan troglodytes&quot;), the bonobo (&quot;Pan paniscus&quot;), the eastern gorilla (&quot;Gorilla beringei&quot;), and possibly a population of the western gorilla (&quot;Gorilla gorilla&quot;). It is the only country in the world in which bonobos are found in the wild. Much concern has been raised about great ape extinction. Because of hunting and habitat destruction, the numbers of chimpanzee, bonobo and gorilla (each of whose populations once numbered in the millions) have now dwindled down to only about 200,000 gorillas, 100,000 chimpanzees and possibly only about 10,000 bonobos. The gorillas, chimpanzee, bonobo, and okapi are all classified as endangered by the World Conservation Union.

Major environmental issues in DRC include deforestation, poaching, which threatens wildlife populations, water pollution and mining. From 2015 to 2019, the rate of deforestation in the Democratic Republic of the Congo doubled. In 2021, deforestation of the Congolian rainforests increased by 5%.
==Government and politics==

After a four-year interlude between two constitutions, with new political institutions established at the various levels of government, as well as new administrative divisions for the provinces throughout the country, a new constitution came into effect in 2006 and politics in the Democratic Republic of the Congo finally settled into a stable presidential democratic republic.
The 2003 transitional constitution had established a parliament with a bicameral legislature, consisting of a Senate and a National Assembly.

The Senate had, among other things, the charge of drafting the new constitution of the country. The executive branch was vested in a 60-member cabinet, headed by a President and four vice presidents. The President was also the Commander-in-Chief of the armed forces. The transitional constitution also established a relatively independent judiciary, headed by a Supreme Court with constitutional interpretation powers.

The 2006 constitution, also known as the Constitution of the Third Republic, came into effect in February 2006. It had concurrent authority, however, with the transitional constitution until the inauguration of the elected officials who emerged from the July 2006 elections. Under the new constitution, the legislature remained bicameral; the executive was concomitantly undertaken by a President and the government, led by a Prime Minister, appointed from the party able to secure a majority in the National Assembly.

The government – not the President – is responsible to the Parliament. The new constitution also granted new powers to the provincial governments, creating provincial parliaments which have oversight of the Governor and the head of the provincial government, whom they elect. The new constitution also saw the disappearance of the Supreme Court, which was divided into three new institutions. The constitutional interpretation prerogative of the Supreme Court is now held by the Constitutional Court.

Although located in the Central African UN subregion, the nation is also economically and regionally affiliated with Southern Africa as a member of the Southern African Development Community (SADC).

===Administrative divisions===

The country is currently divided into the city-province of Kinshasa and 25 other provinces. The provinces are subdivided into 145 territories and 33 cities. Before 2015, the country had 11 provinces.

===Foreign relations===

The global growth in demand for scarce raw materials and the industrial surges in China, India, Russia, Brazil and other developing countries require that developed countries employ new, integrated and responsive strategies for identifying and ensuring, on a continual basis, an adequate supply of strategic and critical materials required for their security needs. Highlighting the DR Congo&#x27;s importance to United States national security, the effort to establish an elite Congolese unit is the latest push by the U.S. to professionalize armed forces in this &quot;strategically important&quot; region.

There are economic and strategic incentives (for external countries) to bring more &quot;security&quot; to the Congo, which is rich in natural resources such as cobalt, a metal used in many industrial and military applications. The largest use of cobalt is in superalloys, used to make jet engine parts for high speed war planes. Cobalt is also used in magnetic alloys and in cutting and wear-resistant materials such as cemented carbides. The chemical industry consumes significant quantities of cobalt in a variety of applications including catalysts for petroleum and chemical processing; drying agents for paints and inks; ground coats for porcelain enamels; decolorant for ceramics and glass; and pigments for ceramics, paints, and plastics. The country possesses 80% of the world&#x27;s cobalt reserves.

It is thought that due to the importance of cobalt for batteries for electric vehicles and stabilization of electric grids with large proportions of intermittent renewables in the electricity mix, the DRC could become an object of increased geopolitical competition.

In the 21st century, Chinese investment in the DRC and Congolese exports to China have grown rapidly. In July 2019, UN ambassadors of 37 countries, including DRC, have signed a joint letter to the UNHRC defending China&#x27;s treatment of Uyghurs and other Muslim ethnic minorities. In 2021, President Félix Tshisekedi called for a review of mining contracts signed with China by his predecessor Joseph Kabila, in particular the Sicomines multibillion &#x27;minerals-for-infrastructure&#x27; deal.

===Military===
The military of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, known as the , consists of the Land Forces, the Air Force, and the Navy. There is also a separate Republican Guard that is outside of the FARDC command structure, being directly responsible to the president. In 2023 there were 103,000 soldiers in the Land Forces, 6,700 in the Navy, 2,550 in the Air Force, 14,000 in the central command, and 8,000 in the Republican Guard. All services together numbered 134,250 personnel, nominally making the FARDC the largest military in Central Africa. However, the FARDC has been undermined by low levels of professionalism, training, morale, pay, and equipment, along with rampant corruption, and its lack of vehicles and aircraft makes it difficult to move troops across the country&#x27;s large territory. 

The FARDC was established in 2003 after the end of the Second Congo War with the integration of many former rebel groups into its ranks, and it still also works with pro-government militias. Since then it has been a diverse combination of the former Zairian armed forces, rebel groups from the Congo Wars, and other militias that were integrated more recently. President Félix Tshisekedi announced the beginning of military reforms in 2022 to create a more cohesive national army. This effort included replacing most of the high command with younger officers that had a record of success and providing more military spending for the years between 2022 and 2024.

The armed forces are organized on the basis of geographic joint commands known as defense zones, one each for the western, south-central, and eastern DRC, which are further divided into military regions. The Land Forces consist of brigades, and in 2011, those in Eastern Congo were reorganized into regiments. It was estimated in 2023 that in total there are nine brigades, 27 regiments, one artillery battalion, and one military police battalion. Many units are reported to be at half of their official strength or less because of combat losses and desertions. The FARDC has spent decades fighting against over 100 armed groups in Eastern Congo and the Kasaï region, including local Mai-Mai militias, the Rwandan-backed March 23 Movement (M23), Nduma Defense of Congo-Renovated (NDC-R), the Allied Democratic Forces (which has become part of the Islamic State), and the Lord&#x27;s Resistance Army. 

The Democratic Republic of Congo signed the UN treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons.

===Law enforcement and crime===

The Congolese National Police are the primary police force in the Democratic Republic of the Congo.

===Corruption===

A relative of Mobutu explained how the government illicitly collected revenue during his rule: &quot;Mobutu would ask one of us to go to the bank and take out a million. We&#x27;d go to an intermediary and tell him to get five million. He would go to the bank with Mobutu&#x27;s authority and take out ten. Mobutu got one, and we took the other nine.&quot; Mobutu institutionalized corruption to prevent political rivals from challenging his control, leading to an economic collapse in 1996.

Mobutu allegedly amassed between US$50 million and $125 million during his rule. He was not the first corrupt Congolese leader by any means: &quot;Government as a system of organized theft goes back to King Leopold II,&quot; noted Adam Hochschild in 2009. In July 2009, a Swiss court determined that the statute of limitations had run out on an international asset recovery case of about $6.7 million of deposits of Mobutu&#x27;s in a Swiss bank, and therefore the assets should be returned to Mobutu&#x27;s family.

President Kabila established the Commission of Repression of Economic Crimes upon his ascension to power in 2001. However, in 2016 the Enough Project issued a report claiming that the Congo is run as a violent kleptocracy.

In June 2020, a court in the Democratic Republic of Congo found President Tshisekedi&#x27;s chief of staff Vital Kamerhe guilty of corruption. He was sentenced to 20 years&#x27; hard labour, after facing charges of embezzling almost $50m (£39m) of public funds. He was the most high-profile figure to be convicted of corruption in the DRC. However, Kamerhe was released already in December 2021.

In November 2021, a judicial investigation targeting Kabila and his associates was opened in Kinshasa after revelations of alleged embezzlement of $138 million.

===Human rights===


The International Criminal Court investigation in the Democratic Republic of the Congo was initiated by Kabila in April 2004. The International Criminal Court prosecutor opened the case in June 2004. Child soldiers have been used on a large scale in DRC, and in 2011 it was estimated that 30,000 children were still operating with armed groups. Instances of child labor and forced labor have been observed and reported in the U.S. Department of Labor&#x27;s &quot;Findings on the Worst Forms of Child Labor&quot; in the DRC in 2013 and six goods produced by the country&#x27;s mining industry appear on the department&#x27;s December 2014 &quot;List of Goods Produced by Child Labor or Forced Labor&quot;.

The Democratic Republic of the Congo has prohibited same-sex marriage since 2006, and attitudes towards the LGBT community are generally negative throughout the nation.
Violence against women seems to be perceived by large sectors of society to be normal. The 2013–2014 DHS survey (pp. 299) found that 74.8% of women agreed that a husband is justified in beating his wife in certain circumstances. The United Nations Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women in 2006 expressed concern that in the post-war transition period, the promotion of women&#x27;s human rights and gender equality is not seen as a priority. Mass rapes, sexual violence and sexual slavery are used as a weapon of war by the Armed Forces of the Democratic Republic of the Congo and armed groups in the eastern part of the country. The eastern part of the country in particular has been described as the &quot;rape capital of the world&quot; and the prevalence of sexual violence there described as the worst in the world.

Female genital mutilation (FGM) is also practiced in DRC, although not on a large scale. The prevalence of FGM is estimated at 5% of women. FGM is illegal: the law imposes a penalty of two to five years of prison and a fine of 200,000 Congolese francs on any person who violates the &quot;physical or functional integrity&quot; of the genital organs.

In July 2007, the International Committee of the Red Cross expressed concern about the situation in eastern DRC. A phenomenon of &quot;pendulum displacement&quot; has developed, where people hasten at night to safety. According to Yakin Ertürk, the UN Special Rapporteur on Violence against Women who toured eastern Congo in July 2007, violence against women in North and South Kivu included &quot;unimaginable brutality&quot;. Ertürk added that &quot;Armed groups attack local communities, loot, rape, kidnap women and children, and make them work as sexual slaves&quot;. In December 2008, GuardianFilms of &quot;The Guardian&quot; released a film documenting the testimony of over 400 women and girls who had been abused by marauding militia. In June 2010, Oxfam reported a dramatic increase in the number of rapes in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, and researchers from Harvard discovered that rapes committed by civilians had increased seventeenfold. In June 2014, Freedom from Torture published reported rape and sexual violence being used routinely by state officials in Congolese prisons as punishment for politically active women. The women included in the report were abused in several locations across the country including the capital Kinshasa and other areas away from the conflict zones. In 2015, figures both inside and outside of the country, such as Filimbi and Emmanuel Weyi, spoke out about the need to curb violence and instability as the 2016 elections approached.

==Economy==

The Central Bank of the Congo is responsible for developing and maintaining the Congolese franc, which serves as the primary form of currency in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. In 2007, The World Bank decided to grant the Democratic Republic of Congo up to $1.3 billion in assistance funds over the following three years. The Congolese government started negotiating membership in the Organization for the Harmonization of Business Law in Africa (OHADA), in 2009.

The DRC is widely considered one of the world&#x27;s richest countries in natural resources; its untapped deposits of raw minerals are estimated to be worth in excess of US$24 trillion. The DRC has 70% of the world&#x27;s coltan, a third of its cobalt, more than 30% of its diamond reserves, and a tenth of its copper.

Despite such vast mineral wealth, the economy of the Democratic Republic of the Congo has declined drastically since the mid-1980s. The DRC generated up to 70% of its export revenue from minerals in the 1970s and 1980s and was particularly hit when resource prices deteriorated at that time. By 2005, 92% of the DRC&#x27;s revenues derived from its minerals. Congolese citizens are among the poorest people on Earth. In 2023, 60% of Congolese subsisted on less than $2.15 a day, and food-price inflation had reached 173%. DR Congo consistently has the lowest, or nearly the lowest, nominal GDP per capita in the world. The DRC is also one of the twenty lowest-ranked countries on the Corruption Perceptions Index.

===Mining===
The DRC is the world&#x27;s largest producer of cobalt ore, and a major producer of copper and diamonds. As of 2023, the country is estimated to possess around 70% of the world&#x27;s cobalt production. Diamonds come from Kasaï Province in the west. By far the largest mines in the DRC are located in southern Katanga Province and are highly mechanized, with a capacity of several million tons per year of copper and cobalt ore, and refining capability for metal ore. The DRC is the second-largest diamond-producing nation in the world, and artisanal and small-scale miners account for most of its production.

At independence in 1960, DRC was the second-most-industrialized country in Africa after South Africa; it boasted a thriving mining sector and a relatively productive agriculture sector. Foreign businesses have curtailed operations because of uncertainty about the outcome of long-term conflicts, lack of infrastructure, and the difficult operating environment. The wars intensified the impact of such basic problems as an uncertain legal framework, corruption, inflation, and lack of openness in government economic policy and financial operations.

Conditions improved in late 2002, when a large portion of the invading foreign troops withdrew. A number of International Monetary Fund and World Bank missions met with the government to help it develop a coherent economic plan, and President Kabila began implementing reforms. Much economic activity still lies outside the GDP data. Through 2011, the DRC had the lowest Human Development Index of the 187 ranked countries.

The economy of DRC relies heavily on mining. However, the smaller-scale economic activity from artisanal mining occurs in the informal sector and is not reflected in GDP data. A third of the DRC&#x27;s diamonds are believed to be smuggled out of the country, making it difficult to quantify diamond production levels. In 2002, tin was discovered in the east of the country but to date has only been mined on a small scale. Smuggling of conflict minerals such as coltan and cassiterite, ores of tantalum and tin, respectively, helped to fuel the war in the eastern Congo.

Katanga Mining Limited, a Swiss-owned company, owns the Luilu Metallurgical Plant, which has a capacity of 175,000 tonnes of copper and 8,000 tonnes of cobalt per year, making it the largest cobalt refinery in the world. After a major rehabilitation program, the company resumed copper production operations in December 2007 and cobalt production in May 2008.

In April 2013, anti-corruption NGOs revealed that Congolese tax authorities had failed to account for $88 million from the mining sector, despite booming production and positive industrial performance. The missing funds date from 2010 and tax bodies should have paid them into the central bank. Later in 2013, the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative suspended the country&#x27;s candidacy for membership due to insufficient reporting, monitoring and independent audits, but in July 2013 the country improved its accounting and transparency practices to the point where the EITI gave the country full membership.

In February 2018, global asset management firm AllianceBernstein defined the DRC as economically &quot;the Saudi Arabia of the electric vehicle age,&quot; because of its cobalt resources, cobalt being essential in the production of the lithium-ion batteries that power many electric vehicles. Open-pit cobalt mining has led to deforestation and habitat destruction.

===Transportation===


Ground transport in the Democratic Republic of Congo has always been difficult. The terrain and climate of the Congo Basin present serious barriers to road and rail construction, and the distances are enormous across this vast country. The DRC has more navigable rivers and moves more passengers and goods by boat and ferry than any other country in Africa, but air transport remains the only effective means of moving goods and people between many places within the country, especially in rural areas. Chronic economic mismanagement, political corruption and internal conflicts have led to long-term under-investment of infrastructure.
Rail transportation is provided by the Congo Railroad Company (Société nationale des chemins de fer du Congo), the Office National des Transports Congo and the Office of the Uele Railways (Office des Chemins de fer des Ueles, CFU).

The DRC has fewer all-weather paved highways than any country of its population and size in Africa — a total of , of which only is in good condition. To put this in perspective, the road distance across the country in any direction is more than (e.g. Matadi to Lubumbashi, by road). The figure of converts to of paved road per one million of population. Comparative figures for Zambia and Botswana are and , respectively. Three routes in the Trans-African Highway network pass through DR Congo:
* Tripoli–Cape Town Highway: this route crosses the western extremity of the country on National Road No. 1 between Kinshasa and Matadi, a distance of on one of the only paved sections in fair condition.
* Lagos–Mombasa Highway: the DR Congo is the main missing link in this east–west highway; it requires a new road to be constructed before it can function.
* Beira–Lobito Highway: this east–west highway crosses Katanga and requires re-construction over most of its length, being an earth track between the Angolan border and Kolwezi, a paved road in very poor condition between Kolwezi and Lubumbashi, and a paved road in fair condition over the short distance to the Zambian border.

The DRC has thousands of kilometres of navigable waterways. Traditionally water transport has been the dominant means of moving around in approximately two-thirds of the country.

, DR Congo has one major national airline (Congo Airways) that offers flights inside DR Congo. Congo Airways is based at Kinshasa&#x27;s international airport. All air carriers certified by the DRC have been banned from European Union airports by the European Commission, because of inadequate safety standards.

Several international airlines service Kinshasa&#x27;s international airport and a few also offer international flights to Lubumbashi International Airport.

===Energy===

Both coal and crude oil resources were mainly used domestically up to 2008. The DRC has the infrastructure for hydro-electricity from the Congo River at the Inga dams. The country also possesses 50% of Africa&#x27;s forests and a river system that could provide hydro-electric power to the entire continent, according to a UN report on the country&#x27;s strategic significance and its potential role as an economic power in central Africa.
The generation and distribution of electricity are controlled by Société nationale d&#x27;électricité, but only 15% of the country has access to electricity. The DRC is a member of three electrical power pools. These are Southern African Power Pool, East African Power Pool, and Central African Power Pool.

Because of abundant sunlight, the potential for solar development is very high in the DRC. There are already about 836 solar power systems in the DRC, with a total power of 83 MW, located in Équateur (167), Katanga (159), Nord-Kivu (170), the two Kasaï provinces (170), and Bas-Congo (170). Also, the 148 Caritas network system has a total power of 6.31 MW.

==Demographics==

===Population===

The CIA World Factbook estimated the population to be over 115 million as of 2024. Between 1950 and 2000, the country&#x27;s population nearly quadrupled from 12.2 million to 46.9 million. Since 2000, it has maintained a high growth rate of about 3–3.5% per year, growing from 47 million to an estimated 111 million.

===Ethnic groups===
Over 250 ethnic groups and 450 tribes (ethnic subgroups) populate the DRC. They are in the Bantu, Sudanic, Nilotic, Ubangian and Pygmy linguistic groups. Because of this diversity, there is no dominant ethnic group in the Congo, however the following ethnic groups account for 51.5% of the population:

*Luba-Kasaï
*Kongo
*Mongo
*Lubakat
*Lulua
*Tetela
*Nande
*Ngbandi
*Ngombe
*Yaka
*Ngbaka

In , the UN estimated the country&#x27;s population to be million, a rapid increase from 39.1 million in 1992 despite the ongoing war. As many as 250 ethnic groups have been identified and named. About 600,000 Pygmies live in the DRC.

===Largest cities===
===Migration===

Given the often unstable situation in the country and the condition of state structures, it is extremely difficult to obtain reliable migration data. However, evidence suggests that DRC continues to be a destination country for immigrants, in spite of recent declines in their numbers. Immigration is very diverse in nature; refugees and asylum-seekers – products of the numerous and violent conflicts in the Great Lakes Region – constitute an important subset of the population. Additionally, the country&#x27;s large mine operations attract migrant workers from Africa and beyond. There is also considerable migration for commercial activities from other African countries and the rest of the world, but these movements are not well studied. Transit migration towards South Africa and Europe also plays a role.

Immigration to the DRC has decreased steadily over the past two decades, most likely as a result of the armed violence that the country has experienced. According to the International Organization for Migration, the number of immigrants in the DRC has fallen from just over one million in 1960, to 754,000 in 1990, to 480,000 in 2005, to an estimated 445,000 in 2010. Official figures are unavailable, partly due to the predominance of the informal economy in the DRC. Data are also lacking on irregular immigrants, however given neighbouring countries&#x27; ethnic links to DRC nationals, irregular migration is assumed to be a significant phenomenon.

Figures for Congolese nationals abroad vary greatly depending on the source; sources believe there are between three to six million Congolese living abroad. This discrepancy is due to a lack of official, reliable data. Emigrants from the DRC are above all long-term emigrants, the majority of whom live in Africa and to a lesser extent in Europe; 79.7% and 15.3% respectively, according to estimated 2000 data. New destination countries include South Africa and various points en route to Europe. The DRC has produced a considerable number of refugees and asylum-seekers located in the region and beyond. These numbers peaked in 2004 when, according to UNHCR, there were more than 460,000 refugees from the DRC; in 2008, Congolese refugees numbered 367,995 in total, 68% of whom were living in other African countries.

Since 2003, more than 400,000 Congolese migrants have been expelled from Angola.

===Languages===
French is the official language of the Democratic Republic of the Congo. It is culturally accepted as the &quot;lingua franca&quot;, facilitating communication among the many different ethnic groups of the Congo. According to a 2018 OIF report, 49 million Congolese people (51% of the population) could read and write in French. A 2021 survey found that 74% of the population could speak French, making it the most widely spoken language in the country.

In Kinshasa, 67% of the population in 2014 could read and write French, and 68.5% could speak and understand it.

In 2024, there were around 12 million native French speakers in the country.

Approximately 242 languages are spoken in the country, of which four have the status of national languages: Kituba (Kikongo), Lingala, Tshiluba, and Swahili (Congo Swahili). Although some limited number of people speak these as first languages, most of the population speak them as a second language, after the native language of their own ethnic group. Lingala was the official language of the &quot;Force Publique&quot; under Belgian colonial rule and remains to this day the predominant language of the armed forces. Since the recent rebellions, a good part of the army in the east also uses Swahili, where it competes to be the regional &quot;lingua franca&quot;.

Under Belgian rule, the Belgians instituted teaching and use of the four national languages in primary schools, making it one of the few African nations to have had literacy in local languages during the European colonial period. This trend was reversed after independence, when French became the sole language of education at all levels. Since 1975, the four national languages have been reintroduced in the first two years of primary education, with French becoming the sole language of education from the third year onward, but in practice many primary schools in urban areas solely use French from the first year of school onward. Portuguese is taught in the Congolese schools as a foreign language. The lexical similarity and phonology with French makes Portuguese a relatively easy language for the people to learn. Most of the roughly 175,000 Portuguese speakers in the DRC are Angolan and Mozambican expatriates.

===Religion===


Christianity is the predominant religion of the DRC. A 2013–14 survey, conducted by the Demographic and Health Surveys Program in 2013–2014 indicated that Christians constituted 93.7% of the population (with Catholics making up 29.7%, Protestants 26.8%, and other Christians 37.2%). A new Christian religious movement, Kimbanguism, had the adherence of 2.8%, while Muslims made up 1%. Other recent estimates have found Christianity the majority religion, followed by 95.8% of the population according to a 2010 Pew Research Center estimate, while the CIA World Factbook reports this figure to be 95.9%. The proportion of followers of Islam is variously estimated from 1% to 12%.

There are about 35 million Catholics in the country with six archdioceses and 41 dioceses. The impact of the Catholic Church is difficult to overestimate. Schatzberg has called it the country&#x27;s &quot;only truly national institution apart from the state.&quot; Its schools have educated over 60% of the nation&#x27;s primary school students and more than 40% of its secondary students. The church owns and manages an extensive network of hospitals, schools, and clinics, as well as many diocesan economic enterprises, including farms, ranches, stores, and artisans&#x27; shops.

Sixty-two Protestant denominations are federated under the umbrella of the Church of Christ in the Congo. It is often referred to as &quot;the Protestant Church&quot;, since it covers most of the DRC Protestants. With more than 25 million members, it constitutes one of the largest Protestant bodies in the world.

Kimbanguism was seen as a threat to the colonial regime and was banned by the Belgians. Kimbanguism, officially &quot;the church of Christ on Earth by the prophet Simon Kimbangu&quot;, has about three million members, primarily among the Bakongo of Kongo Central and Kinshasa.

Islam has been present in the Democratic Republic of the Congo since the 18th century, when Arab traders from East Africa pushed into the interior for ivory- and slave-trading purposes. Today, Muslims constitute approximately 1% of the Congolese population according to the Pew Research Center. The majority are Sunni Muslims.
The first members of the Baháʼí Faith to live in the country came from Uganda in 1953. Four years later,the first local administrative council was elected. In 1970, the National Spiritual Assembly (national administrative council) was first elected. Though the religion was banned in the 1970s and 1980s, due to misrepresentations of foreign governments, the ban was lifted by the end of the 1980s. In 2012, plans were announced to build a national Baháʼí House of Worship in the country.

Traditional religions embody such concepts as monotheism, animism, vitalism, spirit and ancestor worship, witchcraft, and sorcery and vary widely among ethnic groups. The syncretic sects often merge elements of Christianity with traditional beliefs and rituals and are not recognized by mainstream churches as part of Christianity. New variants of ancient beliefs have become widespread, led by US-inspired Pentecostal churches which have been in the forefront of witchcraft accusations, particularly against children and the elderly. Children accused of witchcraft are sent away from homes and family, often to live on the street, which can lead to physical violence against these children. There are charities supporting street children such as the Congo Children Trust. The Congo Children Trust&#x27;s flagship project is Kimbilio, which works to reunite street children in Lubumbashi. The usual term for these children is &quot;enfants sorciers&quot; (child witches) or &quot;enfants dits sorciers&quot; (children accused of witchcraft). Non-denominational church organizations have been formed to capitalize on this belief by charging exorbitant fees for exorcisms. Though recently outlawed, children have been subjected in these exorcisms to often-violent abuse at the hands of self-proclaimed prophets and priests.

===Education===
In 2014, the literacy rate for the population between the ages of 15 and 49 was estimated to be 75.9% (88.1% male and 63.8% female) according to a DHS nationwide survey. The education system is governed by three government ministries: the &quot;Ministère de l&#x27;Enseignement Primaire, Secondaire et Professionnel (MEPSP&quot;), the &quot;Ministère de l&#x27;Enseignement Supérieur et Universitaire (MESU)&quot; and the &quot;Ministère des Affaires Sociales (MAS)&quot;. Primary education is neither free nor compulsory, even though the Congolese constitution says it should be (Article 43 of the 2005 Congolese Constitution).

As a result of the First and Second Congo Wars in the late 1990s—early 2000s, over 5.2 million children in the country did not receive any education. Since the end of the civil war, the situation has improved tremendously, with the number of children enrolled in primary schools rising from 5.5 million in 2002 to 16.8 million in 2018, and the number of children enrolled in secondary schools rising from 2.8 million in 2007 to 4.6 million in 2015 according to UNESCO.

Actual school attendance has also improved greatly in recent years, with primary school net attendance estimated to be 82.4% in 2014 (82.4% of children ages 6–11 attended school; 83.4% for boys, 80.6% for girls).

===Health===

The hospitals in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) include the General Hospital of Kinshasa. The DRC has the world&#x27;s second-highest rate of infant mortality (after Chad). In April 2011, through aid from Global Alliance for Vaccines, a new vaccine to prevent pneumococcal disease was introduced around Kinshasa. In 2012, it was estimated that about 1.1% of adults aged 15–49 were living with HIV/AIDS. Malaria and yellow fever are problems. In May 2019, the death toll from the Ebola outbreak in DRC surpassed 1,000.

The incidence of yellow fever-related fatalities in DRC is relatively low. According to the World Health Organization&#x27;s (WHO) report in 2021, only two individuals died due to yellow fever in DRC.

According to the World Bank Group, in 2016, 26,529 people died on the roads in DRC due to traffic accidents.

Maternal health is poor in DRC. According to 2010 estimates, DRC has the 17th highest maternal mortality rate in the world. According to UNICEF, 43.5% of children under five are stunted.

United Nations emergency food relief agency warned that amid the escalating conflict and worsening situation following COVID-19 in the DRC, millions of lives were at risk as they could die of hunger. According to the data of the World Food Programme, in 2020, four in ten people in Congo lacked food security and about 15.6 million were facing a potential hunger crisis.

Air pollution levels in the Democratic Republic of the Congo are very unhealthy. In 2020, annual average air pollution in the DRC stood at 34.2 μg/m3, which is almost 6.8 times the World Health Organization PM2.5 guideline (5 μg/m3: set in September 2021). These pollution levels are estimated to reduce the life expectancy of an average citizen of the DRC by almost 2.9 years. Currently, the DRC does not have a national ambient air quality standard.

==Culture==
The culture of the Democratic Republic of the Congo reflects the diversity of its numerous ethnic groups and their differing ways of life throughout the country—from the mouth of the River Congo on the coast, upriver through the rainforest and savanna in its centre, to the more densely populated mountains in the far east. Since the late 19th century, traditional ways of life have undergone changes brought about by colonialism, the struggle for independence, the stagnation of the Mobutu era, and most recently, the First and Second Congo Wars. Despite these pressures, the customs and cultures of the Congo have retained much of their individuality. The country&#x27;s 81 million inhabitants (2016) are mainly rural. The 30% who live in urban areas have been the most open to Western influences.

=== Literature ===
Congolese authors use literature as a way to develop a sense of national consciousness amongst the people of the DRC. Frederick Kambemba Yamusangie writes literature for the between generations of those who grew up in the Congo, during the time when they were colonised, fighting for independence and after. Yamusangie in an interview said he felt the distance in literature and wanted to remedy that he wrote the novel, Full Circle, which is a story of a boy named Emanuel who in the beginning of the book feels a difference in culture among the different groups in the Congo and elsewhere. Rais Neza Boneza, an author from the Katanga province, wrote novels and poems to promote artistic expressions as a way to address and deal with conflicts.

===Music===
Congo has a rich musical heritage, rooted in traditional rhythms. The earliest known form of popular partnered dance music in Congo was &quot;Maringa&quot;, denoting a Kongolese dance practised within the former Kingdom of Loango, encompassing parts of the present-day Republic of the Congo, southern Gabon and Cabinda. The style gained popularity in the 1920s–1930s, introducing the &quot;bar-dancing&quot; culture in Léopoldville (now Kinshasa), incorporating unique elements like a bass drum, a bottle as a triangle, and an accordion.

In the 1940s and 1950s, the influence of Cuban son bands transformed &quot;Maringa&quot; into &quot;Congolese rumba&quot;. Imported records by Sexteto Habanero and Trio Matamoros, often mislabeled as &quot;rumba&quot;, played a significant role. Artists such as Antoine Kasongo, Paul Kamba, Henri Bowane, Antoine Wendo Kolosoy, Franco Luambo, Le Grand Kallé, Vicky Longomba, Nico Kasanda, Tabu Ley Rochereau, and Papa Noël Nedule authentically popularized the style and made significant contributions to it in the 1940s and 1950s.

The 1960s and 1970s saw the emergence of soukous, an urban dance music style that evolved from Congolese rumba. Soukous led to diverse offshoots, such as &quot;ekonda saccadé&quot;, reflecting the Mongo rhythmic influence, and &quot;mokonyonyon&quot;, emulating pelvic thrust dance movements from the Otetela ethnic background. The same soukous, under the guidance of &quot;le sapeur&quot;, Papa Wemba, have set the tone for a generation of young men always dressed up in exorbitant designer clothes. They came to be known as the fourth generation of Congolese music and mostly come from the former prominent band Wenge Musica.

Political and economic challenges under Mobutu prompted a mass exodus of musicians to Kenya, Tanzania, Uganda, Zambia, Sierra Leone, Liberia, Europe and Asia, expanding the spread of Congolese urban music. Notably, the quartet Ry-Co Jazz played a crucial role in globalizing Congolese music, touring West Africa, the Caribbean, and France. By the 1980s, numerous Congolese musicians were based in Europe, facilitating the global dissemination of their musical prowess. Congolese lead guitarists became a sought-after commodity, attracting bands worldwide eager to infuse a Congolese flavor into their compositions or learn the intricate art of Congolese guitar dexterity.

In the late 1980s, Ndombolo emerged as a fast-paced, hip-swaying dance music, drawing inspiration from Congolese rumba and soukous. This genre gained widespread popularity in Africa, Europe, and the Americas, with musicians like Papa Wemba, Koffi Olomide, Werrason, Awilo Longomba, Quartier Latin International, Général Defao, Aurlus Mabélé, Exra Musica, Wenge Musica, Wenge Musica Maison Mére and Fally Ipupa making significant contributions to its evolution and international stage.

===Media===

Newspapers of the DRC include , &quot;Radion Télévision Mwangaza&quot;, &#x27;, &#x27;, &quot;Le Phare&quot;, &quot;Le Potentiel&quot;, &quot;Le Soft&quot; and &quot;LeCongolais.CD&quot;, a web-based daily. Radio Télévision Nationale Congolaise (RTNC) is the national broadcaster of the Democratic Republic of the Congo. RTNC currently broadcasts in Lingala and French.

===Cuisine===
===Sports===

Many sports are played in the DRC, including football, basketball, baseball, and rugby. The sports are played in numerous stadiums throughout the country, including the Stade Frederic Kibassa Maliba. As Zaire, they participated in the 1974 FIFA World Cup.

Internationally, the country is especially famous for its professional basketball NBA and football players. Dikembe Mutombo is one of the best African basketball players to ever play the game. Mutombo is well known for humanitarian projects in his home country. Bismack Biyombo, Christian Eyenga, Jonathan Kuminga, and Emmanuel Mudiay are others who gained significant international attention in basketball. Several Congolese players and players of Congolese descent—including strikers Romelu Lukaku, Yannick Bolasie, and Dieumerci Mbokani—have gained prominence in world football. DR Congo has twice won the African Cup of Nations football tournament.

DR Congo&#x27;s women&#x27;s national volleyball team lastly qualified for the 2021 Women&#x27;s African Nations Volleyball Championship. The country featured a national team in beach volleyball that competed at the 2018–2020 CAVB Beach Volleyball Continental Cup in both the women&#x27;s and the men&#x27;s section.

<text>The American dipper (Cinclus mexicanus), also known as a water ouzel, is a semiaquatic bird species native to western North America.

== Description ==
It is a stocky grey bird with a head sometimes tinged with brown, and white feathers on the eyelids that cause the eyes to flash white as the bird blinks. It is long, has a wingspan of , and weighs on average . The name &quot;dipper&quot; derives from its long legs, which it uses to bob its whole body up and down during pauses as it feeds on the bottom of fast-moving, rocky streams.

==Taxonomy==
The American dipper was described by the English zoologist William Swainson in 1827 based on a specimen that had been collected in Mexico by the English naturalist William Bullock. Swainson placed the new species with the dippers in the genus &quot;Cinclus&quot; and coined the current binomial name &quot;Cinclus mexicanus&quot;. The type locality is Temascaltepec de González in Mexico.

There are five subspecies:

* &quot;C. m. mexicanus&quot; Swainson, 1827 – north and central Mexico
* &quot;C. m. anthonyi&quot; Griscom, 1930 – southeast Mexico, southwest Guatemala, east Honduras and northwest Nicaragua
* &quot;C. m. ardesiacus&quot; Salvin, 1867 – Costa Rica and west Panama
* &quot;C. m. dickermani&quot; Phillips, AR, 1966 – south Mexico
* &quot;C. m. unicolor&quot; Bonaparte, 1827 – Alaska, west Canada and west USA

==Description==
This species, like other dippers, is equipped with an extra eyelid called a nictitating membrane that allows it to see underwater, and scales that close its nostrils when submerged. Dippers also produce more oil than most birds, which may help keep them warmer when seeking food underwater.

The song consists of high whistles or trills &quot;&quot; repeated a few times. Both sexes of this bird sing year round.

==Distribution and habitat==
The American dipper inhabits the mountainous regions of Central America and western North America from Panama to Alaska. It is usually a permanent resident, moving slightly south or to lower elevations if necessary to find food or unfrozen water. The presence of this indicator species shows good water quality; it has vanished from some locations due to pollution or increased silt load in streams.
==Behaviour and ecology==
The American dipper defends a linear territory along streams. In most of its habits, it closely resembles its European counterpart, the white-throated dipper (&quot;Cinclus cinclus)&quot;, which is also sometimes known as a water ouzel.

===Breeding===
The American dipper&#x27;s nest is a globe-shaped structure with a side entrance, close to water, on a rock ledge, river bank, behind a waterfall or under a bridge. The normal clutch is 2–4 white eggs, incubated solely by the female, which hatch after about 15–17 days, with another 20–25 days to fledging. The male helps to feed the young. The maximum recorded age from ring-recovery data of an American dipper is 8 years and 1 month for a bird ringed and recovered in South Dakota.

===Feeding===
It feeds on aquatic insects and their larvae, including dragonfly nymphs, small crayfish, and caddisfly larvae. It may also take tiny fish or tadpoles.

=== Predators ===
Dippers may occasionally be preyed on by predatory fish such as by brook trout, bull or Dolly Varden trout.

===History===
The American dipper, previously known as the water-ouzel, was the favorite bird of famous naturalist John Muir. He dedicated an entire chapter in his book &quot;The Mountains of California&quot; to the ouzel stating &quot;He is the mountain streams&#x27; own darling, the humming-bird of blooming waters, loving rocky ripple-slopes and sheets of foam as a bee loves flowers, as a lark loves sunshine and meadows. Among all the mountain birds, none has cheered me so much in my lonely wanderings, —none so unfailingly. For both in winter and summer he sings, sweetly, cheerily, independent alike of sunshine and of love, requiring no other inspiration than the stream on which he dwells. While water sings, so must he, in heat or cold, calm or storm, ever attuning his voice in sure accord; low in the drought of summer and the drought of winter, but never silent.&quot;

<text>Paul David Hewson (born 10 May 1960), known by the nickname Bono ( ), is an Irish singer-songwriter and activist. He is a founding member, the lead vocalist, and primary lyricist of the rock band U2. Bono is known for his impassioned vocal style as well as his grandiose songwriting and performance style. His lyrics frequently include social and political themes, and religious imagery inspired by his Christian faith. 

Born and raised in Dublin, Ireland, he attended Mount Temple Comprehensive School where in 1976 he began dating his future wife, Alison Stewart, as well as forming, with schoolmates, the band that became U2. During U2&#x27;s early years, Bono&#x27;s lyrics contributed to the group&#x27;s rebellious and spiritual tone. As the band matured, his lyrics became inspired more by personal experiences shared with the other members. As a member of U2, Bono has received 22 Grammy Awards and has been inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.

Aside from his music, Bono is an activist for social justice causes, both through U2 and as an individual. He is particularly active in campaigning to fight extreme poverty and HIV/AIDS in Africa, for which he co-founded DATA, EDUN, the ONE Campaign, and Product Red. In pursuit of these causes, he has participated in benefit concerts and lobbied politicians and heads of state for relief. Bono has received numerous honours for his philanthropic efforts, including being named one of the &quot;Time&quot; Persons of the Year in 2005, being granted an honorary knighthood by Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom in 2007, being made a of the French (Order of Arts and Letters) in 2013, and receiving the Presidential Medal of Freedom in the United States in 2025. Bono has also attracted criticism for bypassing African businesses in his activist efforts and for tax avoidance in his personal finances.

Outside the band, he has recorded with numerous artists. He has collaborated with U2 bandmate the Edge on several projects, including: songs for Roy Orbison, Tina Turner, and Martin Garrix; and the soundtracks to the musical &quot;Spider-Man: Turn Off the Dark&quot; and a London stage adaptation of &quot;A Clockwork Orange&quot;. In business, he invested in the refurbishment of the Clarence Hotel in Dublin, and was managing director and a managing partner of the private equity firm Elevation Partners, which invested in several companies.

==Early life==
Paul David Hewson was born in the Rotunda Hospital in Dublin on 10 May 1960, the second child of Iris (née Rankin) and Brendan Robert &quot;Bob&quot; Hewson, then living in Stillorgan on Dublin&#x27;s Southside. His brother, Norman, is eight years older than him. Bono&#x27;s family moved to a new house on Cedarwood Road, between the Northside suburbs of Finglas and Ballymun when he was six weeks old, and he grew up there.

The Hewson brothers grew up in an interdenominational Christian household; their mother was a member of the Church of Ireland, and their father was a Roman Catholic. Both parents initially agreed that the first child would be raised Anglican and the second Catholic. Although Bono was the second child, he also attended Church of Ireland services with his mother and brother, while his father also sometimes brought him to Mass at the nearby Catholic church, St Canice&#x27;s. In 2000, Bono learned that Scott Rankin, a relative he thought to be his cousin, was actually his half-brother; Rankin was the offspring of an affair that Bob Hewson had with his wife&#x27;s sister Barbara.

Bono attended a Protestant primary school, Glasnevin National School, rather than the local Catholic-managed primary school in Ballymun. His teenage musical idols were Bob Dylan, Leonard Cohen, David Bowie, and Marc Bolan of T. Rex. After attending St. Patrick&#x27;s Cathedral Grammar School for a year, Bono moved to Mount Temple Comprehensive School, a multi-denominational school in Clontarf.

Bono&#x27;s mother died on 10 September 1974, three days after suffering a ruptured cerebral aneurysm at her father&#x27;s funeral. Many U2 songs, including &quot;I Will Follow&quot;, &quot;Mofo&quot;, &quot;Out of Control&quot;, &quot;Lemon&quot; and &quot;Tomorrow&quot;, focus on the loss of his mother. He said &quot;because of the way I grew up in Finglas -- sleeping on a couch, or because my mother died when I was a kid, I was in the house on my own a lot of the time, so I&#x27;d knock on the door of the Hanveys at teatime, or the Rowens at lunchtime.&quot;

During his childhood and adolescence, Bono and his friends were part of a surrealist street gang called &quot;Lypton Village&quot;. Two of his closest childhood friends, the artist Guggi and the musician Gavin Friday, lived on the same street; Guggi was also in Lypton Village. The gang had a ritual of giving nicknames. Bono had several names: first, he was known as &quot;Steinhegvanhuysenolegbangbangbang&quot;, then just &quot;Huyseman&quot;, followed by &quot;Houseman&quot;, &quot;Bon Murray&quot;, &quot;Bono Vox of O&#x27;Connell Street&quot;, and finally just &quot;Bono&quot;. &quot;Bono Vox&quot; is a modified form of &quot;Bonavox&quot;, which is the name of a hearing aid shop just off Dublin&#x27;s principal street, O&#x27;Connell Street. The name derives from the Latin phrase for &quot;good voice&quot;. The nickname was given by Guggi; Bono initially disliked it but after learning of its translation, he accepted it. Hewson has been known as &quot;Bono&quot; since the age of 14 or 15. In addition to it being his stage name, close family, friends and fellow band members also refer to him as Bono.

After Bono left school, his father told him he could live at home for one year, but if he was not able to pay his own way, he would have to leave the house.

==Musical career==

===U2===

On 25 September 1976, Bono, David Evans (&quot;The Edge&quot;), his brother Dik Evans, and Adam Clayton responded to an advertisement on a bulletin board at Mount Temple posted by fellow student Larry Mullen Jr. seeking people interested in forming a rock band. The band had occasional jam sessions in which they did covers of other bands. Tired of long guitar solos and hard rock, Bono wanted to play the Rolling Stones and Beach Boys songs. The band could not play covers very well, so they started writing their own songs.The band went by the name &quot;Feedback&quot; for a few months, before changing to &quot;The Hype&quot; later on. After Dik Evans left the group to join another local band, the Virgin Prunes, the remaining four officially changed the name from &quot;The Hype&quot; to &quot;U2&quot;. Initially, Bono sang, played guitar and wrote the band&#x27;s songs. He said of his early guitar playing in a 1982 interview, &quot;When we started out I was the guitar player, along with the Edge—except I couldn&#x27;t play guitar. I still can&#x27;t. I was such a lousy guitar player that one day they broke it to me that maybe I should sing instead. I had tried before, but I had no voice at all. I remember the day I found I could sing. I said, &#x27;Oh, that&#x27;s how you do it. When The Edge&#x27;s guitar playing improved, Bono was relegated mostly to the microphone, although he occasionally still plays rhythm guitar and harmonica. As of 2006, Bono has taken piano lessons from his children&#x27;s piano teacher as a means to improve his songwriting.

On 13 July 1985, U2 performed at the Live Aid benefit concert at Wembley Stadium before a crowd of 72,000 fans and a worldwide television audience of 1.5 billion people. During a 12-minute performance of &quot;Bad&quot;, Bono climbed down from the stage to embrace and dance with a female fan he had picked out of the crowd, showing television viewers the personal connection that he could make with audiences. Bono&#x27;s impromptu departure from the stage extended the length of &quot;Bad&quot;, cutting into their allotted time and forcing them to drop &quot;Pride (In the Name of Love)&quot;, their biggest hit at the time, from their setlist. The group initially regarded the concert as a missed opportunity, but many journalists called their performance one of the show&#x27;s highlights; &quot;The Guardian&quot; cited Live Aid as the event that made stars of U2 and their performance as one of 50 key events in rock history.
Bono writes the lyrics for almost all U2 songs, which often have social and political themes. His lyrics frequently allude to a religious connection or meaning, evident in songs such as &quot;Gloria&quot; from the band&#x27;s album &quot;October&quot; and &quot;I Still Haven&#x27;t Found What I&#x27;m Looking For&quot; from &quot;The Joshua Tree&quot;. During the band&#x27;s early years, Bono was known for his rebellious tone which turned to political anger and rage during the band&#x27;s &quot;War&quot;, &quot;The Joshua Tree&quot;, and &quot;Rattle and Hum&quot; eras. Following the Enniskillen bombing that left 11 dead and 63 injured on 8 November 1987, the Provisional IRA paramilitaries threatened to kidnap Bono. IRA supporters also attacked a vehicle carrying the band members. These acts were in response to his speech condemning the Enniskillen bombing during a live performance of &quot;Sunday Bloody Sunday&quot;. Bono had been advised to cut his on-stage outburst from the &quot;Rattle and Hum&quot; film, but it was left in.

The film also contains footage of the band&#x27;s 11 November 1987 free &quot;Save the Yuppies&quot; concert at Justin Herman Plaza in San Francisco, during which Bono spray-painted &quot;Rock N Roll Stops the Traffic&quot; on the Vaillancourt Fountain sculpture. Bono was criticised by Mayor Dianne Feinstein and faced a misdemeanour for defacing public property. He apologised in a written statement to local officials, and the band&#x27;s promoter Bill Graham agreed to pay to clean up the graffiti. With the band feeling a sense of musical stagnation towards the end of the Lovetown Tour, Bono hinted at changes to come during a 30 December 1989 concert; before a hometown crowd in Dublin, he said on stage that it was &quot;the end of something for U2&quot;, and that &quot;we have to go away and ... dream it all up again&quot;.
U2&#x27;s sound and focus dramatically changed with their 1991 album, &quot;Achtung Baby&quot;. Bono&#x27;s lyrics became more personal, inspired by experiences related to the private lives of the members of the band. During the band&#x27;s 1992–1993 Zoo TV Tour, Bono assumed a number of costumed stage personae in an attempt to be more lighthearted and escape the group&#x27;s reputation of being overly serious and self-righteous. Bono said: &quot;All through the Eighties we tried to be ourselves and failed when the lights were on. Which is what set us up for Zoo TV. We decided to have some fun being other people, or at least other versions of ourselves.&quot; Bono&#x27;s primary persona during the tour was &quot;the Fly&quot;, which originated from him wearing an oversized pair of blaxploitation sunglasses, given to him by wardrobe manager Fintan Fitzgerald, to lighten the mood in the studio. He developed the persona into a leather-clad egomaniac, and described his outfit as having Lou Reed&#x27;s glasses, Elvis Presley&#x27;s jacket, and Jim Morrison&#x27;s leather trousers. To match the character&#x27;s dark fashion, Bono dyed his naturally-brown hair black. In contrast to his earnest stage demeanour of the 1980s, as the Fly, Bono strutted around the stage with &quot;swagger and style&quot;, exhibiting mannerisms of an egotistical rock star. He often stayed in character as the Fly away from the stage, including for public appearances and when staying in hotels.

For his &quot;Mirror Ball Man&quot; stage character, Bono dressed in a shining silver lamé suit with matching shoes and cowboy hat. The character was meant to parody greedy American televangelists, showmen, and car salesman, and was inspired by Phil Ochs&#x27; Elvis persona from his 1970 tour. Bono said that the character represented &quot;a kind of showman America. He had the confidence and charm to pick up a mirror and look at himself and give the glass a big kiss. He loved cash and in his mind success was God&#x27;s blessing.&quot; Mirror Ball Man appeared during encores of concerts in 1992 and made prank calls from the stage, often to the White House in an attempt to reach U.S. President George H. W. Bush. Bono portrayed this alter ego on the first three legs of the tour, but replaced him with &quot;MacPhisto&quot; in 1993. MacPhisto was created to parody the devil and was named after Mephistopheles of the Faust legend. As MacPhisto, Bono wore a gold lamé suit with gold platform shoes, pale makeup, lipstick, and devil&#x27;s horns on his head. As the character, Bono spoke with an exaggerated upper-class English accent, similar to that of a down-on-his-luck character actor. According to him, &quot;We came up with a sort of old English Devil, a pop star long past his prime returning regularly from sessions on The Strip in Vegas and regaling anyone who would listen to him at cocktail hour with stories from the good old, bad old days.&quot; As MacPhisto, Bono continued his routine of making in-concert prank calls, targeting local politicians and mocking them by engaging them in character as the devil; he said, &quot;When you&#x27;re dressed as the Devil, your conversation is immediately loaded, so if you tell somebody you really like what they&#x27;re doing, you know it&#x27;s not a compliment.&quot;

During performances, Bono attempts to interact with the crowd as often as possible. He is known for pulling audience members onto the stage or moving himself down to the physical level of the audience. In 2005, during U2&#x27;s Vertigo Tour stop in Chicago, he pulled a boy onto the stage during the song &quot;An Cat Dubh / Into the Heart&quot;. Bono has often allowed fans to come on stage and perform songs with the band.
While accepting the 2003 Golden Globe Award for Best Original Song for &quot;The Hands That Built America&quot;, Bono called the award &quot;really, really fucking brilliant!&quot; during the live television broadcast. In response, the Parents Television Council condemned Bono for his profanity and started a campaign for its members to file complaints with the FCC. Although Bono&#x27;s use of &quot;fuck&quot; violated FCC indecency standards, the FCC refused to fine NBC because the network did not receive advance notice of the consequences of broadcasting such profanity and the profanity in question was not used in its literal sexual meaning.
In apparent reaction to the refusal, a group of congressmen introduced House Resolution 3687, the &quot;Clean Airwaves Act&quot;, on 8 December 2003, aiming to amend to provide an explicit list of profane words and phrases and remove ambiguity that could enable certain uses of the phrases to be allowed. The bill was not enacted. The incident has had a long-term impact on the handling of profanity on live broadcasts.

U2 were criticised in 2007 for moving part of their multimillion-euro song catalogue from Ireland to Amsterdam six months before Ireland ended a tax exemption on musicians&#x27; royalties. Under Dutch tax law, bands are subject to low to non-existent tax rates. U2 manager Paul McGuinness stated that the arrangement was legal and customary and businesses often sought to minimise their tax burdens. The move prompted criticisms in the Irish parliament. The band later responded by stating that approximately 95% of their business took place outside Ireland, and that they were taxed globally because of this. Bono was one of several wealthy figures whose tax arrangements were singled out for criticism in a report by the charity Christian Aid in 2008.

===Solo===

In November 2022, Bono embarked on a 14-date book tour across North America and Europe called &quot;Stories of Surrender&quot; to promote his memoir &quot;Surrender: 40 Songs, One Story&quot;. For the shows, he recited and acted out passages from his book and performed U2 songs in stripped-down arrangements. Though described as a &quot;one-man show&quot;, the performances were aided by musicians Kate Ellis (cello, keyboards, vocals), Gemma Doherty (harp, keyboards, vocals), and U2 producer Jacknife Lee (&quot;musical director&quot; – keyboards, percussion). Bono continued the tour with a residency of 11 shows at the Beacon Theatre in New York City from April to May 2023, which grossed $6.8 million.

===Collaborations===
In addition to his work with U2, Bono has collaborated with Frank Sinatra, Johnny Cash, Willie Nelson, Luciano Pavarotti, Sinéad O&#x27;Connor, Green Day, Tom Petty, Roy Orbison, Bob Dylan, Patti Smith, Tina Turner, B.B. King, Zucchero, Ray Charles, Quincy Jones, Kirk Franklin, Bruce Springsteen, Tony Bennett, Clannad, the Corrs, Wyclef Jean, Kylie Minogue, Carl Perkins, and Herbert Grönemeyer. On Robbie Robertson&#x27;s 1987 eponymous album, he played bass guitar and sang. For Michael Hutchence&#x27;s 1999 posthumous eponymous album, Bono and producer Andy Gill completed the unfinished song &quot;Slide Away&quot; by writing an additional verse and recording vocals by Bono. In 2015, he collaborated with African stars D&#x27;banj, Waje and Omotola Jalade Ekeinde for a women&#x27;s empowerment song entitled &quot;Strong Girl&quot;.

Bono and the Edge have written and recorded several songs together outside of U2. They wrote the musical score for the Royal Shakespeare Company&#x27;s London stage adaptation of &quot;A Clockwork Orange&quot;, which opened in 1990. The duo also wrote the eponymous theme song of the 1995 James Bond film &quot;GoldenEye&quot;, which was performed by Tina Turner. Bono and the Edge ventured into theatre again when they composed the music and lyrics for the Broadway musical &quot;Spider-Man: Turn Off the Dark&quot;; they were featured on the soundtrack&#x27;s single &quot;Rise Above 1&quot; with Reeve Carney in 2011. The duo collaborated with Jay-Z and Rihanna for the 2010 song &quot;Stranded (Haiti Mon Amour)&quot;, which benefitted the &quot;Hope for Haiti Now&quot; relief telethon for the 2010 Haiti earthquake. Bono and the Edge were featured on the song &quot;We Are the People&quot; by Dutch DJ Martin Garrix, which served as the official song of the UEFA Euro 2020 tournament and was released on 14 May 2021.

On 17 March 2020, Bono performed a new song, &quot;Let Your Love Be Known&quot;, via livestream to fans during the COVID-19 pandemic. On 24 March, the song was released on YouTube, retitled &quot;#SING4LIFE&quot;, as a collaboration with will.i.am, Jennifer Hudson, and Yoshiki.

==Musical style==
===Vocals===

Bono is known for his impassioned vocal style, often delivered in a high register through open-throated belting. Bono has been classified as a tenor, and according to him has a three-octave vocal range; one analysis found it to span from C to G on studio recordings over the course of his career. He frequently employs &quot;whoa-oh-oh&quot; vocalisations in his singing. Rock musician Billie Joe Armstrong of Green Day said: &quot;He&#x27;s a physical singer, like the leader of a gospel choir, and he gets lost in the melodic moment. He goes to a place outside himself, especially in front of an audience, when he hits those high notes.&quot; He added that Bono is &quot;not afraid to go beyond what he&#x27;s capable of&quot;.

In the early days of U2, Bono unintentionally developed an English vocal accent as a result of him mimicking his musical influences such as Siouxsie and the Banshees. He said: &quot;I still think that I sing like Siouxsie from The Banshees on the first two U2 albums. But I found my voice through Joey Ramone at that gig in Dublin. I stood there and heard him singing. He sang a bit like a girl too. It was all going to be OK after all. That was my way in.&quot; His vocal style evolved during the band&#x27;s exploration of roots music for &quot;The Joshua Tree&quot;; &quot;Spin&quot; said that he learned to command &quot;the full whisper-to-shout range of blues mannerisms&quot;. Bono attributed this maturation to &quot;loosening up&quot;, &quot;discover[ing] other voices&quot;, and employing more restraint in his singing. For &quot;Where the Streets Have No Name&quot;, Bono varied the timbre of his voice extensively and used rubato to vary its timing, while author Susan Fast found &quot;With or Without You&quot; to be the first track on which he &quot;extended his vocal range downward in an appreciable way&quot;.

Bono continued to explore a lower range in the 1990s, using what Fast described as &quot;breathy and subdued colors&quot; for &quot;Achtung Baby&quot;. One technique used on the album is octave doubling, in which his vocals are sung in two different octaves, either simultaneously or alternating between verses and choruses. According to Fast, this technique introduces &quot;a contrasting lyrical idea and vocal character to deliver it&quot;, leading to both literal and ironic interpretations of Bono&#x27;s vocals. On tracks such as &quot;Zoo Station&quot; and &quot;The Fly&quot;, his vocals were highly processed, giving them a different emotional feel from his previous work. Bono said that lowering his voice helped him find a new vocal vocabulary, as he previously felt limited to &quot;certain words and tones&quot; by his tenor voice. His singing on &quot;Zooropa&quot; was an even further departure from U2&#x27;s previous style; throughout the record, Bono &quot;underplay[ed] his lung power&quot;, according to Jon Pareles, and he also used an operatic falsetto he calls the &quot;Fat Lady&quot; voice on the tracks &quot;Lemon&quot; and &quot;Numb&quot;. As he has aged, Bono has continued to evolve his singing, relying more on &quot;the croon than the belt&quot;, according to &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;″s Joe Gross.

===Equipment===
In the early years of U2, Bono used a black Fender Lead 2 guitar connected to a Roland Bolt amplifier model Bolt 60.

He has used a Shure SM58 Premier S2 radio microphone in live performances; this was replaced by the Shure UHF-R series and he now uses a B58 capsule instead of the SM58 capsule. He is known to record in the studio with a standard Shure SM58 microphone.

==Activism and philanthropy==

Bono has been involved in philanthropy and activism for human rights and social justice causes, both as a member of U2 and as an individual. He explained that he was motivated to become involved in social and political causes by seeing one of the &quot;Secret Policeman&#x27;s Ball&quot; benefit shows, staged by Monty Python member John Cleese and producer Martin Lewis for the human-rights organisation Amnesty International in 1979. Bono stated, &quot;I saw &quot;The Secret Policeman&#x27;s Ball&quot; and it became a part of me. It sowed a seed...&quot;.

In 1984, musician Bob Geldof enlisted Bono to participate in the Band Aid charity single &quot;Do They Know It&#x27;s Christmas?&quot;; Bono reprised his singing role for the 2004 Band Aid 20 and 2014 Band Aid 30 singles of the same name. In July 1985, U2 performed at the Live Aid charity concert, which was organised by Geldof to benefit the Ethiopian famine; he and Bono later collaborated to organise the 20th anniversary Live 8 concerts in 2005, at which U2 also performed.
From September to October 1985, Bono and his wife Ali Hewson made a humanitarian visit to Africa, spending a month working at a feeding centre in Ajibar, Ethiopia. Along with other volunteers, they developed an educational programme consisting of songs and one-act plays to teach Ethiopian children important information about issues such as health and hygiene. During the trip, he also became aware of the corruption, trade agreements, and debts that were all claimed to be contributing factors to the famine and poverty in Africa. The trip was cited as fueling Bono&#x27;s passion for African issues that would come to characterise his future philanthropic and activist efforts.

In 1986, Bono and U2 performed on Amnesty International&#x27;s Conspiracy of Hope Tour of benefit concerts in the United States, alongside musicians such as Sting and Bryan Adams.
Since 1999, Bono has become increasingly involved with raising awareness of the plight of Africa and campaigning on its behalf. From 1999 to 2000, Bono was involved with the Jubilee 2000 coalition, working as an activist on its Drop the Debt campaign. He met with U.S. Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers, and with U.S. Republican politicians such as Jesse Helms, John Kasich, Orrin Hatch, J. Dennis Hastert, and Dick Armey in an effort to secure bipartisan support for the U.S. forgiving the debt of developing countries. He has met with several influential politicians, including former U.S. President George W. Bush and former Canadian Prime Minister Paul Martin. During a March 2002 visit to the White House, Bono lobbied Bush to provide financial assistance to developing countries. The following year, Bush signed legislation authorising the President&#x27;s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief program, which has been credited with saving 17 million lives over its lifetime. Bush told Bono that the initiative &quot;never would have made it out of Congress had [Bono] not been engaged&quot;.
The advocacy non-government organisation (NGO) DATA (Debt, AIDS, Trade, Africa) was established in 2002 by Bono and Bobby Shriver, along with activists from Drop the Debt. The organisation was funded by the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation, George Soros, and Edward W. Scott. In 2004, Bono and Shriver co-founded the One Campaign, with the aim of eliminating extreme poverty and disease in Africa by building citizen support. The organisation received a $3 million grant from the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation. In 2006, Bono and Shriver collaborated again to found (Red), an organization that licenses the Product Red brand to partner companies to raise money for the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria. Each company creates a product with the Product Red logo, and a percentage of the profits from the sale of these labelled products benefit the Global Fund. Partner companies include American Express, Apple, Converse, Motorola, Microsoft, Dell, The Gap, Giorgio Armani, Nike, and Starbucks; Bono was involved with securing most of Red&#x27;s corporate partners. In October 2007, it was announced that DATA and One Campaign would merge in the United States and that the new organization would be known simply as One. Red currently operates as a sister organisation of One. As of December 2018, One has 10 million members, 3 million of whom are in Africa. As of December 2020, Red has generated $650 million to support HIV/AIDS grants. In 2023, Bono announced he would leave the board of directors of the One Campaign at the end of the year.

In 2005, Bono recorded a version of &quot;Don&#x27;t Give Up&quot; with Alicia Keys, with proceeds going to Keep a Child Alive.
Bono has spoken at numerous events on behalf of his activist efforts. He spoke at the 54th Annual National Prayer Breakfast on 2 February 2006, encouraging the care of the socially and economically depressed and calling for an extra one per cent tithe of the United States&#x27; national budget. He has made multiple appearances at the World Economic Forum annual meeting in Davos, Switzerland.

Bono was a special guest editor of the July 2007 issue of &quot;Vanity Fair&quot; magazine, named &quot;The Africa Issue: Politics &amp; Power&quot;. It featured an assortment of 20 different covers, with photographs by Annie Leibovitz of a number of celebrities, political leaders, and philanthropists, each showcasing their contributions to humanitarian relief in Africa.

In 2021, Bono lent his voice to One&#x27;s animated series &quot;Pandemica&quot;, which was created to raise awareness of the importance of vaccines in ending the COVID-19 pandemic and the inequalities in worldwide vaccine availability.

In 2022, Bono supported Ukraine&#x27;s resistance to being invaded by Russia. A poem written by Bono about Saint Patrick and the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine was recited by Nancy Pelosi at a White House event for Saint Patrick&#x27;s Day, on 17 March 2022. The poem was widely derided by the public. In early April, Bono and the Edge recorded an acoustic rendition of &quot;Walk On&quot; for Global Citizen&#x27;s Stand Up for Ukraine livestream, which was organised to urge world leaders to raise funds for Ukrainian refugees. On 8 May 2022, as a show of solidarity for Ukrainians and at the invitation of Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy, Bono and the Edge performed in a Kyiv metro station that was being used as a makeshift bomb shelter.

===Efficacy and analysis===

Bono has become one of the world&#x27;s best-known philanthropic performers and was named the most politically effective celebrity of all time by the &quot;National Journal&quot;. He has been dubbed &quot;the face of fusion philanthropy&quot;, both for his success enlisting powerful allies from a diverse spectrum of leaders in government, religious institutions, philanthropic organisations, popular media, and the business world, as well as for spearheading new organizational networks that bind global humanitarian relief with geopolitical activism and corporate commercial enterprise.

On 15 December 2005, Paul Theroux published an op-ed in &quot;The New York Times&quot; called &quot;The Rock Star&#x27;s Burden&quot; (cf. Kipling&#x27;s &quot;The White Man&#x27;s Burden&quot;) that criticised stars such as Bono, Brad Pitt, and Angelina Jolie, labelling them as &quot;mythomaniacs, people who wish to convince the world of their worth.&quot; Theroux, who lived in Africa as a Peace Corps volunteer, added that &quot;the impression that Africa is fatally troubled and can be saved only by outside help—not to mention celebrities and charity concerts—is a destructive and misleading conceit.&quot;

In February 2006, Bono responded to his critics by calling them &quot;cranks carping from the sidelines. A lot of them wouldn&#x27;t know what to do if they were on the field. They&#x27;re the party who will always be in opposition so they&#x27;ll never have to take responsibility for decisions because they know they&#x27;ll never be able to implement them.&quot;

In an article in Bloomberg Markets in March 2007, journalists Richard Tomlinson and Fergal O&#x27;Brien noted that Bono used his band&#x27;s 2006 Vertigo world tour to promote his ONE Campaign while at the same time &quot;U2 was racking up $389 million in gross ticket receipts, making Vertigo the second-most lucrative tour of all time, according to Billboard magazine ... Revenue from the Vertigo tour is funnelled through companies that are mostly registered in Ireland and structured to minimise taxes.&quot;

Further criticism came in November 2007, when Bono&#x27;s various charity campaigns were targeted by Jobs Selasie, head of African Aid Action. Selasie claimed that these charities had increased corruption and dependency in Africa because they failed to work with African entrepreneurs and grassroots organisations, and as a result, Africa has become more dependent on international handouts.

==Other creative endeavours==
===Art===
Bono sketches and paints as a hobby. He developed his art style by drawing and painting on photographs, which he learned from his father who used to add colour to black-and-white instant film photographs of his wife. Describing Bono&#x27;s interest in visual artwork, &quot;The Atlantic&quot;″s editor-in-chief Jeffrey Goldberg said, &quot;He just walks around with an iPad and sketches everything.&quot;

Bono and his daughters Jordan and Eve provided original paintings for a 2003 book adaptation of &quot;Peter and the Wolf&quot;, which accompanied a musical release by Bono&#x27;s friend Gavin Friday and Maurice Seezer. A CD-book package was released in November 2003. Bono&#x27;s paintings, which were inspired by the 2001 death of his father, were auctioned at Christie&#x27;s in New York. Proceeds from the sales of the paintings and CD-book package benefitted the Irish Hospice Foundation.

Bono&#x27;s drawings of his musical influences were featured in a December 2022 issue of &quot;The Atlantic&quot; in an article profiling him. The following year, Goldberg commissioned him to illustrate the cover of &quot;The Atlantic&quot;″s June 2023 issue for a story about Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy. Bono&#x27;s artwork, a line-drawing sketched portrait of Zelenskyy in the colours of the Ukrainian flag, was inspired by protest art and political posters. U2 also sold merchandise featuring the portrait, including T-shirts, posters, and hoodies, with all proceeds benefiting United24 to purchase ambulances for Ukraine.

===Film===

Bono was an executive producer of Bill Carter&#x27;s 1995 documentary film &quot;Miss Sarajevo&quot;. Carter had previously enlisted U2&#x27;s help in bringing attention to the Siege of Sarajevo during their 1993 concerts on the Zoo TV Tour. Bono was also executive producer of the 2000 film &quot;The Million Dollar Hotel&quot;, which was developed from a story by himself and Nicholas Klein. It starred Jeremy Davies, Milla Jovovich, and Mel Gibson.

In the 2007 musical film &quot;Across the Universe&quot;, Bono made a cameo appearance during a psychedelic sequence, portraying the character &quot;Dr. Robert&quot; and singing the Beatles&#x27; &quot;I Am the Walrus&quot;. Bono served as an executive producer of the 2018 film &quot;Waiting for the Miracle to Come&quot;. Bono participated in the 2019 documentary &quot;Pavarotti&quot;, in which he expressed his admiration for the titular Italian tenor Luciano Pavarotti.

Bono voiced a character in the 2021 animated musical film &quot;Sing 2&quot;, the lion rock legend Clay Calloway. In April 2023, Max and Cartoon Network greenlit a short animated film adaption of &quot;Peter &amp; the Wolf&quot; with artwork based on Bono&#x27;s original illustrations for his 2003 book. The project features narration and music by Friday.
===Writings===
Bono&#x27;s memoir, &quot;Surrender: 40 Songs, One Story&quot;, was released on 1 November 2022, and was promoted with a book tour called &quot;Stories of Surrender&quot;. The book debuted at number two on &quot;The New York Times&quot; nonfiction best-seller list for the week ending 5 November 2022. For his work narrating the audiobook version of &quot;Surrender&quot;, Bono won the Audiobook of the Year honour at the 2024 Audie Awards.

==Business ventures==

In 1992, Bono, along with the Edge, bought and refurbished Dublin&#x27;s two-star 70-bedroom Clarence Hotel, and converted it into a five-star 49-bedroom hotel. In 2019, they sold the hotel leasehold, and four years later, they sold the property. Bono and McKillen are also co-owners of Clós Nua Ltd., a company that owns the Tramyard site in Dalkey and plans to redevelop it.

In 2005, Bono, Ali Hewson, and designer Rogan Gregory co-founded the EDUN fashion label (&quot;nude&quot; spelled backwards, to suggest both &quot;natural&quot; and the Garden of Eden). It was intended to help bring about positive change in Africa through a fair trade-based relationship rather than by direct aid.

Bono was a board member of the Elevation Partners private-equity firm, which attempted to purchase Eidos Interactive in 2005 and subsequently invested in other entertainment businesses. Bono was an investor in the Forbes Media group in the U.S. through Elevation Partners; his firm took a minority stake in Forbes Media, which encompassed the 89-year-old business that includes &quot;Forbes&quot; magazine, the Forbes.com website, and other assets. The terms of the deal were not disclosed, but reports said the stake was worth about €194 million ($250 million). Elevation Partners also owned a 1.5 per cent stake in social networking site Facebook, originally purchased for $210 million. Although it was reported that Bono&#x27;s stake was valued at approximately US$1 billion in February 2012, a 2015 article in &quot;Forbes&quot; stated that this estimate was based on an incorrect attribution of shares.

In 2016, Bono invested in and joined the board of directors of the &quot;Rise Fund&quot;, a new $2 billion impact investment fund founded by TPG. Rise&#x27;s investments fell across seven sectors, including agriculture, education, and healthcare, and were made into companies making &quot;a measurable positive social and/or environmental impact&quot;. In 2019, Bono and TPG announced the creation of Y Analytics, a company intended to measure the social and environmental impacts of investments.

Bono was among those named in the 2017 Paradise Papers after he was identified as an investor in Nude Estates, which bought a shopping mall in Lithuania in 2007 and transferred ownership to Nude Estates 1 in Guernsey, in an apparent attempt to avoid tax. Bono welcomed the subsequent investigation by the Lithuanian tax authority, saying that transparency was necessary and he had personally campaigned for it. Nude Estates paid €53,000 in taxes and fines after the investigation was completed and Bono severed ties with the company.

In September 2019, Bono joined the board of directors of Zipline.

==Awards and recognition==

Bono has won numerous awards with U2, including 22 Grammy Awards and two Golden Globe Awards for Best Original Song (for &quot;The Hands That Built America&quot; in 2003 and &quot;Ordinary Love&quot; in 2014). In 2005, Bono was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as a member of U2, in the group&#x27;s first year of eligibility. Bono has been recognised by music critics on several rankings of greatest singers and frontmen. Among singers, &quot;Q&quot; ranked him the 26th-greatest, &quot;Consequence of Sound&quot; ranked him the 32nd-greatest, and &quot;Mojo&quot; ranked him 57th-greatest. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; ranked him the 32nd-greatest singer in 2008, and the 140th-greatest in 2023. Among frontmen, &quot;Billboard&quot; ranked him the 9th-greatest lead singer in rock history, &quot;Gigwise&quot; ranked him the 45th-greatest frontman, and Steven Hyden of &quot;Uproxx&quot; ranked him the 16th-greatest lead singer. In 2015, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; ranked Bono and the Edge at number 35 on its list of the 100 Greatest Songwriters of All Time.

In 2003, Bono received the Legion of Honour from the French government, and the MusiCares Person of the Year award. The following year he was awarded the Pablo Neruda International Presidential Medal of Honour from the Government of Chile. &quot;Time&quot; included Bono on its annual &quot;Time&quot; 100 list of the most influential people in 2004 and 2006. In 2005, the magazine named him, Bill and Melinda Gates the Persons of the Year. Also in 2005, he received the Portuguese Order of Liberty for his humanitarian work. That year Bono was also among the first three recipients of the TED Prize, which grants each winner a &quot;wish to change the world&quot;. Bono made three wishes, the first two related to the One Campaign and the third that every hospital, health clinic, and school in Ethiopia could be connected to the Internet. TED rejected the third wish as being a sub-optimal way for TED to help Africa and instead organised a TED conference in Arusha, Tanzania. Bono attended the conference, which was held in June 2007.

In 2004, Bono was given an honorary Doctor of Laws degree from the University of Pennsylvania.

In 2007, Bono received several honours. At the 38th NAACP Image Awards, he won the Chairman&#x27;s Award. He was named in the UK&#x27;s New Year Honours List as an honorary Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire. He was formally granted honorary knighthood on 29 March in a ceremony at the residence of British Ambassador David Reddaway in Dublin, Ireland. On 27 September, Bono and DATA received the Philadelphia Liberty Medal for their humanitarian efforts. While accepting the honour, Bono said, &quot;When you are trapped by poverty, you are not free. When trade laws prevent you from selling the food you grew, you are not free.&quot; Bono donated the $100,000 prize to DATA; Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala accepted the prize on the organisation&#x27;s behalf.

On 11 December 2008, Bono received the annual Man of Peace prize, which is awarded by several Nobel Peace Prize laureates in Paris, France.

&quot;Time&quot; ranked Bono 8th on its list of the &quot;Most Influential Celebrities&quot; in 2013; he was the only person from the music industry in the Top 10. In July 2013, he was honoured by the French government as a , the country&#x27;s highest cultural honour.

In 2016, &quot;Glamour&quot; named him &quot;Man of the Year&quot;, breaking the 26-year tradition that saw the &quot;Woman of the Year&quot; accolade reserved only for women. Bono was recognized for establishing a campaign called &quot;Poverty is Sexist,&quot; which is &quot;specifically aimed at helping the world&#x27;s poorest women&quot;. In 2018, he was the first recipient of the George W. Bush Medal for Distinguished Leadership, which was awarded by Bush&#x27;s Presidential Center; the honour was in recognition of Bono&#x27;s humanitarian work against poverty and HIV/AIDS.

On 1 April 2022, Bono received the 2021 J. William Fulbright Prize for International Understanding from the Fulbright Association in recognition of his activist efforts.

In January 2025, Bono was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the highest civilian honour in the United States, by President Joe Biden. A statement on whitehouse.gov called Bono a &quot;pioneering activist against AIDS and poverty&quot; and credited him with creating bipartisan support for the U.S. PEPFAR program for AIDS relief.

==Personal life==
===Family life===

At the age of thirteen, Bono met Alison &quot;Ali&quot; Stewart, who was one year below him at Mount Temple Comprehensive School. After the September 1974 death of his mother left him emotionally adrift and in conflict with his father and brother, Stewart began taking care of him. In 1976, Bono and Stewart began dating. The pair split up briefly but reunited. Their relationship became more serious as she accompanied him in his efforts to break through in the music industry, and by 1979 they were discussing marriage, conditional upon his career becoming established.

Stewart and Bono married on 31 August 1982 in a Church of Ireland ceremony at All Saints Church in her home area, Raheny. The ceremony combined rituals of both conventional Protestantism and the Shalom Friendship Christian group that Bono and other U2 members had belonged to. U2 was in debt to their record label Island Records so the couple could not afford a honeymoon, but the label&#x27;s founder Chris Blackwell gave them use of the Goldeneye estate he owned in Jamaica. After returning to Ireland, the couple moved to a small mews house in Howth, which they shared with the rest of U2.

The couple have four children: daughters Jordan (born 10 May 1989) and Eve (born 7 July 1991) and sons Elijah Bob Patricius Guggi Q (born 17 August 1999) and John Abraham (born 20 May 2001). Elijah is the lead vocalist and guitarist in the rock band Inhaler, while Eve is an established actress.

===Residences===

After leaving the Howth peninsula, Bono and Ali bought a Martello tower in Bray in northern County Wicklow, south of Dublin. Since the 1980s, they have maintained a primary home on Vico Road, in the affluent Dublin suburb of Killiney. The house, Temple Hill, is located on the slopes of Killiney Hill and has views of Killiney Bay. Bono&#x27;s childhood friend Gavin Friday lives next door. Some years after the original purchase, the Hewsons bought one neighbouring house, Curlews, and shortly after, a second, the castellated Lios Beag.

Bono and Ali also own residences in the south of France and New York. In the late 1980s or early 1990s, Bono bought a top-floor duplex apartment in Manhattan&#x27;s San Remo apartment building from Steve Jobs for $15 million. Jobs had renovated it for his own use, but never moved in. In 1993, Bono and the Edge co-purchased a seafront house in Èze-sur-Mer in the south of France.

===Faith===
In 2013, when discussing his faith in Jesus Christ, Bono said that Christ was either who he claimed he was or he was &quot;a complete and utter nutcase&quot;. As early as 2005, Bono was invoking this argument, identified as the &quot;Lewis trilemma&quot;.

===Health and safety===
Bono is almost never seen in public without sunglasses, as he has had glaucoma since the 1990s; this also makes him sensitive to flash photography. During a &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; interview, he stated:
In January 1996, Bono was aboard a Grumman HU-16 aeroplane flown by musician Jimmy Buffett named &quot;Hemisphere Dancer&quot; that was shot at by Jamaican police, who believed the craft to be smuggling marijuana. The aircraft, which sustained minimal damage, was also carrying Ali Hewson, her and Bono&#x27;s two daughters, Chris Blackwell, and co-pilot Bill Dindy. The Jamaican government acknowledged the mistake and apologized.

In May 2010, while rehearsing for a North American leg of the U2 360° Tour, Bono suffered a herniated disk and severe compression of the sciatic nerve, and he was taken to a clinic in Munich for emergency neurosurgery. The North American tour was postponed and rescheduled for 2011.

On 16 November 2014, Bono was involved in a &quot;high energy bicycle accident&quot; when he attempted to avoid another rider in New York&#x27;s Central Park. Bono was rushed to NewYork–Presbyterian Hospital/Weill Cornell Medical Center&#x27;s Emergency Department and underwent &quot;multiple X-rays and CAT scans&quot; followed by five hours of surgery. Bono sustained fractures of the shoulder blade, humerus, orbit and pinky finger. Orthopaedic trauma surgeon Dean Lorich, MD, stated that &quot;[Bono] was taken urgently to the operating room... where the elbow was washed out and debrided, a nerve trapped in the break was moved and the bone was repaired with three metal plates and 18 screws.&quot; Bono posted to U2&#x27;s official website, &quot;As I write this, it is not clear that I will ever play guitar again,&quot; as reported in &quot;Cycling Weekly&quot;.

In 2016, during the recording sessions for U2&#x27;s album &quot;Songs of Experience&quot;, Bono had what the Edge called a &quot;brush with mortality&quot;; as a result of the episode, he decided to rework the album&#x27;s lyrics. &quot;The Irish Times&quot; reported that sometime in late 2016 between Christmas and New Year&#x27;s Day, Bono had a near-death experience. At the time, he did not specify what had happened, but in his 2022 memoir &quot;Surrender: 40 Songs, One Story&quot;, he revealed that he had undergone open-heart surgery due to a &quot;blister&quot; that formed over time in his aorta as a result of having a bicuspid aortic valve. The eight-hour operation was performed by David H. Adams at Mount Sinai Hospital, and Bono made a full recovery.

<text>&lt;onlyinclude&gt;is a Japanese manga series written and illustrated by Ken Akamatsu. It was serialized in Kodansha&#x27;s &quot;Weekly Shōnen Magazine&quot; from October 1998 to October 2001, with the chapters collected into 14 volumes by Kodansha. The series tells the story of Keitarō Urashima and his attempts to find the girl with whom he made a childhood promise to enter the University of Tokyo. The manga was licensed for an English-language release in North America and the United Kingdom by Tokyopop, in Australia by Madman Entertainment, and in Singapore by Chuang Yi. Two novelizations of &quot;Love Hina&quot;, written by two anime series screenwriters, were also released in Japan by Kodansha. Both novels were later released in North America and the United Kingdom by Tokyopop.

A twenty-four episode anime adaptation of the manga series, produced by Xebec, aired in Japan from April to September 2000. It was followed by a bonus DVD episode, Christmas and Spring television specials, and a three episode original video animation (OVA) entitled &quot;Love Hina Again&quot;. The anime series, special, and OVA were licensed for release in North America by Bandai Entertainment. In July 2007, the license was acquired by Funimation, who released a boxset of the television series in February 2009. The series is also licensed in Australia by Madman Entertainment and in the United Kingdom by MVM Films.&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;

The series has proved extremely popular around the world, both commercially and critically. In Japan, the manga had 20 million copies in circulation; over 1 million anime DVDs were also sold. The English release of the manga has been reprinted many times. Both anime and manga have received numerous industry awards in Japan and North America, as well as praise from critics.

==Plot==

The series takes place in the Kanagawa Prefecture, and centers on Keitarō Urashima and his attempts to fulfill a childhood promise that he made with a girl to enter the University of Tokyo together. However, he has forgotten the name of the girl he made the promise to and hopes to be accepted into the university in order to find her. Having failed the entrance exam twice and with his parents no longer willing to support him, he goes to stay at his grandmother&#x27;s hotel, only to find out that it has been converted into a female-only apartment (Dormitory). The tenants are about to kick him out when his aunt appears and announces that his grandmother has given him the title to the apartments. Much to their dismay Keitarō becomes the new manager of the family-owned girls&#x27; dorm Hinata House and must now balance his new responsibilities in addition to studying for the university entrance exam.

At Hinata House, Keitarō meets Naru Narusegawa, who is also studying to enter the university. Naru ranks first in the whole of Japan on the practice exams, and Keitarō convinces her to help him study. As the two of them grow closer through their studies, and after Keitarō accidentally reads a small section of Naru&#x27;s diary, he becomes increasingly convinced that Naru may be the girl with whom he made the promise. On the second day of the university exam, Keitarō asks Naru about the promise and is stunned when she tells him he is mistaken. Despite their studying, and Naru&#x27;s mock exam results, they both fail the exams. The pair then have an argument and independently run off to Kyoto to clear their heads. While on their trip they settle their differences and meet Mutsumi Otohime, who lives in Okinawa and is also studying for the university exams.

After returning from Kyoto, Keitarō and Naru decide to retake the exams. After a while, Mutsumi moves to Tokyo, and the three begin to study together. During this period, Naru becomes convinced that Mutsumi is Keitarō&#x27;s promised girl, but Mutsumi states that she made a childhood promise with Naru, not Keitarō. During the next round of university exams, Keitarō believes he has failed them once again and runs away before finding out his results. After learning of this, Naru chases after him without checking her exam results either, and they are followed by the rest of the residents of Hinata House who announce that Keitarō and Naru both passed the exams along with Mutsumi. Unfortunately for him, Keitarō has an accident at the University of Tokyo opening ceremony and is unable to attend classes for three months. After recovering from his injuries, Keitarō decides to study overseas with Noriyasu Seta. As Keitarō is about to leave, Naru finally confesses her feelings to him at the airport and decides to wait for him to return.

When Keitarō returns, he and Naru finally begin to express their feelings for each other. After they deal with new obstacles, Grandma Hina returns to Hinata House and reveals Naru is the girl of Keitarō&#x27;s promise. Three years later, a wedding ceremony (with a new girl, Ema Maeda, presented) is held at Hinata House for Naru and Keitarō as they finally fulfill their childhood promise to each other.

==Production==

Initial sketches for the series were created between September and December 1997, after the completion of &quot;A.I. Love You&quot;. Early storyboards with initial character designs were created between December 1997 and January 1998, and further character designs and location sketches followed between January and April 1998. The last storyboards before serialization were created between April and August 1998.

Around six months before the start of serialization, character designs were still going through several revisions before being settled upon. Several characters underwent complete redesigns and name changes. At one stage the character Naru was named Midori, and she was supposed to fall through a hole in the floor naked, bump her head on Keitaro and lose her memory. Naru&#x27;s name was changed many times before the author settled on Naru Narusegawa, and her final design is similar to Saati Namba from &quot;A.I. Love You&quot;. Mitsune &quot;Kitsune&quot; Konno&#x27;s money-grubbing nature and her older, jaded, and more mature personality were originally intended to be used for Kaolla Su. Shinobu Maehara&#x27;s nature was settled on from the beginning of the series, however her physical appearance and age were extensively redesigned as the series concept was shaped. In her early design, Shinobu had a similar appearance to Forty Namba from &quot;A.I. Love You&quot;.

Throughout the run of the manga, the series used digital editing processes. After a rough sketch of a page was created, the page layout and basic detail were drawn and scanned into an Apple Macintosh. The major page elements were then shaded or filled with patterns, and elements that were drawn separately were added digitally to the page. The manga also used a series of &quot;banked images&quot;, which were basic line drawings of locations, such as a characters room. Instead of redrawing a location from scratch every time it was used, these banked images could be used as a base, and extra detail added to them depending on the requirements for the scene.

Both of these techniques lead to characters having white outlines when copied digitally onto the scene. Parts of Hinata Inn and other locations used were inspired by real life locations and designed from photographs collected during research.

==Media==

===Manga===

Written and illustrated by Ken Akamatsu, &quot;Love Hina&quot; was serialized in Kodansha&#x27;s &quot;shōnen&quot; manga magazine &quot;Weekly Shōnen Magazine&quot;, between October 21, 1998, to October 31, 2001. Its chapters were collected in 14 volumes, released from March 17, 1999, to January 17, 2002. The series was later released in a partially colored format known as the &quot;Iro Hina version&quot;. The 14 Iro Hina volumes were released between July 2001 and April 2004. A new seven-volume edition was released by Kodansha between June and December 2014.

Kodansha published a bilingual English and Japanese edition under the Kodansha Bilingual Comics label. Eight volumes were produced under the bilingual format between October 2000 and July 2001. The edition was removed from sale after the series was licensed by Tokyopop.

The series was licensed for an English-language release in North America and the United Kingdom by Tokyopop, which released the 14 volumes between May 21, 2002, and September 16, 2003. The English release was one of Tokyopop&#x27;s first releases in the &quot;Authentic Manga&quot; lineup of titles using the Japanese right to left reading style. In doing so the artwork remained unchanged from the original. The series appeared consistently in Tokyopop&#x27;s top five selling manga and has been reprinted several times. In August 2009, it was revealed that Tokyopop&#x27;s license had been left to expire by Kodansha and would not be renewed. Kodansha Comics licensed the series with a new translation. This omnibus edition was released as 5 volumes between October 2011 and March 2013.

===Anime===

&quot;Love Hina&quot; was adapted into a 24-episode anime television series by Xebec, a division of Production I.G. The series aired on TV Tokyo April 19 through September 27, 2000. The opening theme was &quot;Sakura Saku&quot; and the closing theme was &quot;Kimi Sae Ireba&quot;. Both songs were written by Ritsuko Okazaki and performed by Megumi Hayashibara. The two themes were released as a CD single, which debuted on the Oricon charts at Number 7. A bonus 25th episode was later created and released as a DVD extra. The series and bonus episode were directed by Yoshiaki Iwasaki, written by Shō Aikawa and featured character designs by Makoto Uno.

In Japan, the television series was released on nine DVDs by Starchild Records between August 3, 2000, and April 2, 2001. &quot;Love Hina&quot; is credited with being one of the first anime series to be available unofficially as a digitally produced fansub, with multiple groups working on the series. The popularity and widespread availability of the series in this form meant that several potential licensors of the series such as ADV Films had concerns over licensing the series. The series was later licensed in North America by Bandai Entertainment, who released six DVDs between February 19 and November 19, 2002. In July 2007, Funimation Entertainment announced they had acquired the license to the series after Bandai&#x27;s license had expired. A new boxset of the television series across 4 discs was released by Funimation on February 24, 2009. It was then re-released as part of Funimation&#x27;s Viridian Collection on July 27, 2010. In the United Kingdom, the series is licensed by MVM Films, who released the series on six DVDs between September 6, 2004, and March 7, 2005, and as a boxset on May 14, 2007. In Australia and New Zealand the series is licensed by Madman Entertainment, who also released the series across six DVDs between September 18, 2002, and February 11, 2003. A box set was released on December 3, 2003.

After the television series was completed, a Christmas special, &quot;Love Hina Xmas Eve: Silent Night&quot;, was produced and shown on December 25, 2000, on TV Tokyo. A DVD was released in Japan on July 4, 2001. It was then released in North America on December 3, 2002, and in the United Kingdom on November 7, 2005. The Spring Special &quot;Love Hina Spring Special: I Wish Your Dream&quot; was also shown on TV Tokyo on April 2, 2001. The DVD was released in Japan on August 1, 2001, in North American on March 18, 2003, and in the United Kingdom on May 16, 2005. Finally, an OVA series called &quot;Love Hina Again&quot; was released on DVD in Japan in 3 parts between January 26 and March 27, 2002. A CD single featuring the opening theme &quot;Kirari Takaramono&quot; and the ending theme &quot;Be for Me, Be for You&quot; was released on February 28, 2002. A solo version was used for the first episode, and a duet with Yūji Ueda was used for the third episode. The North American and United Kingdom releases of &quot;Love Hina Again&quot; grouped the 3 parts together on one disc and were released on September 2, 2003, and January 7, 2008, respectively.

After the end of the television series, &quot;Love Hina Final Selection&quot; was released, containing a summary of the series and &quot;Love Live Hina&quot;, a live concert featuring all of the main cast members.

The anime was later used as the source for a film comic, &quot;Love Hina Anime Comics&quot;, which told the anime story in comic form using stills from the show as the comic panels. The anime Comics series follows the story of the television series, unaired 25th episode, and the Xmas and Spring specials and each volume contains 3 exclusive trading cards. The film comics also contain anime production info.

==Reception==
The first 11 volumes sold over 6 million copies in Japan by October 2001. By 2022, the manga had over 20 million copies in circulation. &quot;Love Hina&quot; won the Kodansha Manga Award for best &quot;shōnen&quot; title in 2001. It was selected as the &quot;Best Manga, USA Release&quot; at both the 2002 and 2004 Anime Expo conventions. In 2003, the title was among the top ten graphic novels on Nielsen BookScan&#x27;s list and one of the first graphic novels to ever appear in the general trade paperback list. The popular culture|pop culture website ICv2 voted &quot;Love Hina&quot; &quot;Anime Product of the Year&quot; in 2002.

The series was well received by critics. Tony Chen, of Anime News Network (ANN), found it to be a funny series, though finding the 16+ rating appropriate due to the number of jokes involving sexual innuendo. He praised the beautiful artwork, feeling the &quot;sexy and cute&quot; female designs were perfect for the series and that Keitarō&#x27;s design fit his dorky personality. Chen found Naru&#x27;s regularly catching Keitarō making a mistake and calling him a pervert redundant and annoying. Eric Luce of Ex.org notes an increased character development over other love comedies, and describes the series as &quot;nothing if not whimsical&quot;.

In Japan, the television series DVDs sold over 1 million copies. The release of the second and third DVDs in Japan was only the second time that an anime series had consecutive number 1 chart positions. This would not occur again until over 15 years later with &quot;Mr. Osomatsu&quot;.

ANN&#x27;s Bamboo Dong praised the anime adaptation for being very intriguing and mixing &quot;drama, romance, and slapstick comedy in a pleasing combination&quot;. She found the music &quot;incredibly cute&quot; and felt it was used in a way which contributed to many of the dramatic effects in the anime. In &quot;The Anime Encyclopedia: A Guide to Japanese Animation Since 1917&quot;, Jonathan Clements and Helen McCarthy felt the female characters were a &quot;standard rack of female anime archetypes&quot; and that the series as a whole was a &quot;culmination of a decade of geek-centered anime&quot;. Kenneth Lee, writing for Ex.org, praised the look and quality of the animation, highlighting the benefits of the digital creation of the adaption over traditional cel animation. Lee recognised elements from other series such as &quot;Maison Ikkoku&quot; and &quot;Kimagure Orange Road&quot;, and summarised the series as &quot;simply wonderful&quot;.
Chris Beveridge, of AnimeOnDVD.com, noted the first anime DVD volume was &quot;really well put together&quot;, but also felt the manga did not translate into an anime series particularly well. He praised the Christmas special, noting that it was &quot;several notches above the TV series&quot; but found that while the Spring Special had amusing moments, it was rushed with bad plotting.

The &quot;Love Hina Again&quot; OVA received more mixed reviews, with ANN&#x27;s Zac Bertschy feeling it reversed part of the plot of the main anime series and never reached the same entertainment level as the television series. The character of Kanako, Keitarō&#x27;s sister, was heavily criticized for being &quot;one of the most annoying characters ever created even though she would have been better for Keitaro than Naru.&quot; Beveridge praised the fun and comedy as well as the fan service, but also noted that one&#x27;s enjoyment would depend on whether they still cared for the characters.

<doc id="76796" wikidata="Q3313758" url="?curid=76796" title="History of the People's Republic of China (1949–1976)">
<text>The time period in China from the founding of the People&#x27;s Republic in 1949 until Mao&#x27;s death in 1976 is commonly known as Maoist China and Red China. The history of the People&#x27;s Republic of China is often divided distinctly by historians into the Mao era and the post-Mao era. The country&#x27;s Mao era lasted from the founding of the People&#x27;s republic on 1 October 1949 to Deng Xiaoping&#x27;s consolidation of power and policy reversal at the Third Plenum of the 11th Party Congress on 22 December 1978. The Mao era focuses on Mao Zedong&#x27;s social movements from the early 1950s on, including land reform, the Great Leap Forward and the Cultural Revolution. The Great Chinese Famine, one of the worst famines in human history, occurred during this era.

== 1949: Proclamation of the People&#x27;s Republic of China ==
On September 29, 1949, the Chinese People&#x27;s Political Consultative Conference unanimously adopted the Common Program as the basic political program for the country following the success of the Chinese revolution. The founding of the People&#x27;s Republic of China (PRC) was formally proclaimed by Mao Zedong, the Chairman of the Chinese Communist Party, on October 1, 1949, at 3:00 pm in Tiananmen Square in Beijing. The establishment of the Central People&#x27;s Government of the PRC, the government of the new nation, was officially declared during the proclamation speech at the founding ceremony. A military parade took place during the foundation ceremony.

==Early 1950s: Social revolution==
The People&#x27;s Republic of China was founded on a land that was ravaged by a century of foreign invasion and civil wars. Both urban and rural communities, as well as both agriculture and industry, experienced significant growth between 1949 and 1959. Mao&#x27;s government carried out land reform, instituted collectivisation and implemented the &quot;laogai&quot; camp system.

Economically, the country followed up on the Soviet model of five-year plans with its own first five-year plan from 1953 to 1957. The country went through a transformation whereby means of production were transferred from private to public entities, and through nationalization of industry in 1955, the state controlled the economy in a similar fashion to the economy of the Soviet Union.

==Korean War==

China&#x27;s role in the Korean war has been evaluated by each participant in sharply different ways. Soon after its founding, the newly born People&#x27;s Republic of China was drawn into its first international conflict. On June 25, 1950, Kim Il Sung&#x27;s North Korean forces crossed the 38th parallel, invaded South Korea, and eventually advanced as far as the Pusan Perimeter in south-east Korea. United Nations forces entered the war on side of the South, and American General Douglas MacArthur, having forced a Communist retreat, proposed to end the war by Christmas 1950. The Soviet Union and China saw a UN (and consequently, American) victory as a major political victory to the United States, a prospect seen as dangerous in the beginnings of the Cold War. However, Stalin had no desire to go to war with the United States, and left China the responsibility of saving the regime in Pyongyang. Up to this time, the Truman Administration was thoroughly disgusted with the corruption of Chiang Kai-shek&#x27;s government and considered simply recognizing the PRC. On June 27, the US 7th Fleet was sent to the Taiwan Straits both to prevent a Communist invasion of the island and to prevent an attempted reconquest of the mainland. China meanwhile warned that it would not accept a US-backed Korea on its border. After the UN forces liberated Seoul in September, Beijing countered by saying that ROK troops could cross into North Korea, but not American ones. MacArthur ignored this, believing that the South Korean army was too weak to attack on its own. After Pyongyang fell in October, the UN troops approached the strategically sensitive Yalu River area. China responded by sending waves of troops south, in what became known as the People&#x27;s Volunteers in order to disassociate them from the PLA. The Chinese army was poorly equipped but contained many veterans of the civil war and the conflict with Japan. In addition, it possessed huge reserves of manpower.
The United States was on its way to the height of military power, and historians contend that Mao&#x27;s participation in the war asserted China as a new power to not be taken lightly. Known as the &quot;Resist America, Aid Korea&quot; Campaign in China, the first major offensive of the Chinese forces was pushed back in October, but by Christmas 1950, the &quot;People&#x27;s Volunteer Army&quot; under the command of Gen. Peng Dehuai had forced the United Nations to retreat back to the 38th Parallel. However, the war was very costly to the Chinese side, as more than just &quot;volunteers&quot; were mobilised, and because of the lack of experience in modern warfare and the lack of modern military technology, China&#x27;s casualties vastly outnumbered that of the United Nations. On 11 April 1951, a U.S. Seventh Fleet destroyer approached close to the port of Swatow (Shantou), on the southeast coast of China, provoking China to send an armada of more than forty armed powered junks to confront and surround the destroyer for nearly five hours before the destroyer departed the area without either side widening the conflict by initiating hostile fire. Declining a UN armistice, the two sides fought intermittently on both sides of the 38th Parallel until the armistice was signed on July 27, 1953. The Korean War ended any possibility of normalised relations with the United States for years. Meanwhile, Chinese forces invaded and annexed Tibet in October 1950. Tibet had been nominally subject to the Chinese emperors in past centuries, but declared its independence in 1912.

Under Mao&#x27;s direction, China built its first atomic bomb in its nuclear program, Project 596, testing it on October 16, 1964, at Lop Nor; it was the fifth country to conduct a successful nuclear test.

==1953–1957==

The Korean War had been enormously costly to China, especially coming on the heels of the civil war, and it delayed postwar reconstruction. In 1949, Mao Zedong declared that the nation would &quot;lean to one side&quot;, meaning that the Soviet Union and the communist bloc would be its principal allies. Three months after the PRC was established in October 1949, Mao and his delegation traveled to Moscow. They were not received warmly by Stalin, who doubted if they really were Marxist-Leninists and not simply a group of Chinese nationalists. He had also recognized Chiang Kai-Shek&#x27;s government, and furthermore distrusted any communist movement that was not under his direct control. After a meeting with Mao, the Soviet leader remarked &quot;What sort of a man is Mao? He seems to have some idea of revolution involving the peasants, but not the workers.&quot; Eventually, a frustrated Mao was ready to go home, but Zhou Enlai refused to leave without a formal agreement. Thus, the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Mutual Friendship was signed and the Chinese at last departed in February 1950.

According to Hua-yu Li, writing in &quot;Mao and the Economic Stalinization of China, 1948–1953&quot; in 1953, Mao, misled by glowing reports in &quot;History of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (Bolshevik): Short Course&quot;, authorized by Stalin of social and economic progress in the Soviet Union, abandoned the liberal economic programs of &quot;New Democracy&quot; and instituted the &quot;general line for socialist transition&quot;, a program to build socialism based on Soviet models. He was reportedly moved in part by personal and national rivalry with Stalin and the Soviet Union.

The Soviet Union provided considerable economic aid and training during the 1950s. Many Chinese students were sent to study in Moscow. Factories and other infrastructure projects were all based on Soviet designs, for China was an agrarian country with little established industry. In 1953, Mao Zedong told the Indonesian ambassador that they had little to export except agricultural products. Several jointly owned Sino-Soviet corporations were established, but Mao considered these to impinge on Chinese sovereignty and in 1954 they were quietly dissolved.

By 1956, Mao was becoming bored with the day-to-day running of the state and also worried about growing red tape and bureaucracy. The 8th Party Congress that year declared that socialism had more-or-less been established and so the next few years would be devoted to rest and consolidation.

In February 1957, Mao gave one of his most famous addresses in which he said, &quot;Let a hundred flowers bloom, let a hundred schools of thought contend.&quot; The Hundred Flowers Campaign was promoted by the CCP as a way of furthering socialist ideology through open debate, but many took it as an invitation to express open disdain for the Communist Party. Many began to voice their opposition to the Party-State&#x27;s rule. Thoroughly shocked, Mao put an end to this and then launched the Anti-Rightist Campaign. Scores of intellectuals and common workers were purged, jailed, or disappeared. Many were not &quot;rehabilitated&quot; until the 1970s.

==Great Leap Forward==

Mao&#x27;s social and cultural programs, including collectivization, were most popular in the early 1950s. However, China&#x27;s strained relations with new Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev and newfound contradictions between the Chinese and Soviet schools of communism seeded a novel and radical drive to reform China&#x27;s economic system in its entirety. This split developed after Stalin&#x27;s death in 1953 when new Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev denounced him. The &quot;secret speech&quot; in 1956 stunned the communist world. China rejected de-Stalinization and in fact displayed large Stalin portraits at the May Day celebrations that year. Mao declared that despite some faults, Stalin had basically been a good, well-meaning Marxist. He felt that the Soviets were not treating China as an equal partner. Cultural differences also contributed to friction between the two communist giants. Khrushchev&#x27;s idea of peaceful competition with the United States rather than overt hostility did not resonate well with Beijing. Mao said that &quot;Do you think the capitalists will put down their butcher knife and become Buddhas?&quot;

Khrushchev&#x27;s 1958 suggestion of a joint Sino-Soviet fleet to counter the US 7th Fleet was angrily rejected by Mao Zedong, who told the Soviet ambassador &quot;If you want to talk about joint cooperation, fine. We can practice joint cooperation in government, military, cultural, and economic matters and you can leave us with a guerrilla force.&quot; When the Soviet premier himself visited China the following year, Mao again asked him to explain what a joint fleet was. He stated that the Soviets were not welcome to put any troops on Chinese soil in peacetime and added &quot;Listen carefully. We have worked long and hard to drive out the Americans, the British, the Japanese, and others. Never again will we allow foreigners to use our territory for their purposes.&quot; Khrushchev also thought that the Chinese were too soft on the Dalai Lama (Tibet&#x27;s spiritual leader) and failed to support them in a border dispute with India, saying that the territory in question was &quot;just a frozen waste where nobody lives.&quot;

Leading into the Great Leap Forward, China experienced a population boom that strained its food supply, despite rising agricultural yields. Increased yields could not keep pace a population that benefitted from a major decrease in mortality (due to successful public health campaigns and the end of war) and high fertility rate.The Chinese government recognized the country&#x27;s dilemma of feeding its rapidly growing population without the means to make significant capital improvements in agriculture. Viewing human labor as an underutilized factor of production, the government intensified the mobilization of masses of people to increase labor inputs in agriculture.

Under Mao&#x27;s leadership, China broke with the Soviet model and announced a new economic program, the &quot;Great Leap Forward&quot;, in 1958, aimed at rapidly raising industrial and agricultural production. Specific to industrial production, Mao announced the goal of surpassing the steel production output of Great Britain by 1968. Giant cooperatives, otherwise known as people&#x27;s communes, were formed. Within a year almost all Chinese villages had been reformed into working communes of several thousand people in size, where people would live and work together as envisioned by an ideal communist society. Rather than build steel mills, small &quot;backyard furnaces&quot; would be used.

The results, however, were disastrous. Normal market mechanisms were disrupted, agricultural production fell behind, and people exhausted themselves producing shoddy, unsellable goods. Because of the reliance on the government providing and distributing food and resources and their rapid depletion due to poor planning, starvation appeared even in fertile agricultural areas. From 1960 to 1961, the combination of poor planning during the Great Leap Forward, political movements incited by the government, as well as unusual weather patterns and natural disasters resulted in widespread famine and many deaths. A significant number of the deaths were not from famine but were killed or overworked by the authorities. According to various sources, the resulting death toll was likely between 20 and 40 million. The steel produced in backyard furnaces at low temperatures proved to be useless. Finally, the peasants hated the lack of privacy and the militarization of their lives.

One of the loudest opponents of the GLF was Defense Minister Peng Dehuai. Peng was a believer in orthodox Soviet-style economic planning and totally against experimentations. Several years earlier, he had been instrumental in trying to develop the PLA into a well-equipped, professional fighting force, as opposed to Mao&#x27;s belief that soldiers who were revolutionary enough could overcome any obstacle. The army had had no ranks during the civil war and Korea. This system worked rather poorly in those conflicts, and so a rank system (modeled after the Soviet one) was implemented in 1954.

While taking a trip through the countryside, Peng was horrified at the wreckage of the Great Leap Forward. Everywhere fields were dotted with abandoned communes, ruined crops, and lumps of useless pig iron. Afterwards, he accused Mao of being responsible for this disaster and was in turn denounced as a rightist and removed from office. Peng then lived retired in disgrace for the next several years until he was arrested and beaten by Red Guards during the Cultural Revolution. He survived the torture, but sustained permanent injuries and died in 1974. After Mao&#x27;s death, Peng was posthumously rehabilitated with full honors.

The already strained Sino-Soviet relationship deteriorated sharply in 1959, when the Soviets started to restrict the flow of scientific and technological information to China. The dispute escalated, and the Soviets withdrew all of their personnel from China by August 1960, leaving many construction projects dormant. In the same year, the Soviets and the Chinese began to have disputes openly in international forums. The relationship between the two powers reached a low point in 1969 with the Sino-Soviet border conflict, when Soviet and Chinese troops met in combat on the Manchurian border.

== Third Front ==

After the failure of the Great Leap Forward, China&#x27;s leadership slowed the pace of industrialization. It invested more on in China&#x27;s coastal regions and focused on the production of consumer goods. After an April 1964 General Staff report concluded that the concentration of China&#x27;s industry in its major coastal cities made it vulnerable to attack by foreign powers, Mao argued for the development of basic industry and national defense industry in protected locations in China&#x27;s interior. This resulted in the building of the Third Front, which involved massive projects including railroad infrastructure, aerospace industry including satellite launch facilities, and steel production industry including Panzhihua Iron and Steel.

Development of the Third Front slowed in 1966 during the Cultural Revolution, but accelerated again after the Sino-Soviet border conflict at Zhenbao Island, which increased the perceived risk of Soviet Invasion. Third Front construction again decreased after United States President Richard Nixon&#x27;s 1972 visit to China and the resulting rapprochement between the United States and China. When Reform and Opening up began after Mao&#x27;s death, China began to gradually wind down Third Front projects. The Third Front distributed physical and human capital around the country, ultimately decreased regional disparities and created favorable conditions for later market development.

==Cultural Revolution==
==Urban–rural divide==
The urban–rural divide was the most important division in Maoist China when it came to the distribution of food, clothing, housing and health care. Rural status carried no entitlement to a state ration card, wages or social security. As a result, Maoist China is sometimes described as a dual society. The model of development in Mao&#x27;s China was to develop heavy industry through the exploitation of the rural population. In order to minimize the cost of staple foods for the urban population, farmers were compelled to sell any agricultural surplus above a specified level to the state at artificially low prices. In some regions the state also ate into the rural grain supply, causing shortages for the locals. The rural population endured the worst of the Great Leap Famine in part because the state could seize as much grain as it needed, even under starvation conditions. The appropriated grain was largely used to feed the urban population, although some of it was exported.

The difference in treatment of urban and rural areas was a major push factor for internal migration, which lead to increased restrictions on mobility. The ways to acquire an urban hukou were limited, including serving in the People&#x27;s Liberation Army, passing the national university entrance examination or being recruited by an urban work unit as a permanent worker. Because of these restrictions, the rural proportion of the population was higher in 1978 than it had been in 1958.

==Mao Zedong&#x27;s legacy==
The history of the People&#x27;s Republic from 1949 to 1976 is accorded the name &quot;Mao era&quot;-China. A proper evaluation of the period is, in essence, an evaluation of Mao&#x27;s legacy. Since Mao&#x27;s death there has been generated a great deal of controversy about him amongst both historians and political analysts.

Mao&#x27;s poor management of the food supply and overemphasis on village industry is often blamed for the millions of deaths by famine during the &quot;Mao era&quot;. However, there were also positive changes as a result from his management. Before 1949, for instance, the illiteracy rate in Mainland China was 80%, and life expectancy was a meager 35 years. At his death, illiteracy had declined to less than 7%, and average life expectancy had increased by 30 years. In addition, China&#x27;s population which had remained constant at 400,000,000 from the Opium War to the end of the Civil War, mushroomed more than 700,000,000 as of Mao&#x27;s death. Under Mao&#x27;s regime, some argue that China ended its &quot;Century of Humiliation&quot; and resumed its status as a major power on the international stage. Mao also industrialized China to a considerable extent and ensured China&#x27;s sovereignty during his rule. In addition, Mao tried to abolish Confucianist and feudal norms.

China&#x27;s economy in 1976 was three times its 1949 size (but the size of the Chinese economy in 1949 was one-tenth of the size of the economy in 1936), and whilst Mao-era China acquired some of the attributes of a superpower such as: nuclear weapons and a space programme; the nation was still quite poor and backwards compared to the Soviet Union, the United States, Japan, or Western Europe. Fairly significant economic growth in 1962–1966 was wiped out by the Cultural Revolution. Other critics of Mao fault him for not encouraging birth control and for creating an unnecessary demographic bump by encouraging the masses, &quot;The more people, the more power&quot;, which later Chinese leaders forcibly responded to with the controversial one-child policy. 
The ideology surrounding Mao&#x27;s interpretation of Marxism–Leninism, also known as Maoism, was codified into China&#x27;s Constitution as a guiding ideology. Internationally, it has influenced many communists around the world, including third world revolutionary movements such as Cambodia&#x27;s Khmer Rouge, Peru&#x27;s Shining Path and the revolutionary movement in Nepal. In practice, &quot;Mao Zedong Thought&quot; is defunct inside China aside from anecdotes about the CCP&#x27;s legitimacy and China&#x27;s revolutionary origins. Of those that remain, some regard the Deng Xiaoping reforms to be a betrayal of Mao&#x27;s legacy.

<text>Corrugated fiberboard, corrugated cardboard, or corrugated is a type of packaging material consisting of a fluted sheet and one or two flat linerboards. It is made on &quot;flute lamination machines&quot; or &quot;corrugators&quot; and is used for making corrugated boxes. 
The corrugated medium sheet and the linerboard(s) are made of kraft containerboard, a paperboard material usually over thick.

==History==
Corrugated (also called pleated) paper was patented in England in 1856, and used as a liner for tall hats, but corrugated boxboard was not patented and used as a shipping material until 20 December 1871. The patent was issued to Albert Jones of New York City for single-sided (single-face) corrugated board. Jones used the corrugated board for wrapping bottles and glass lantern chimneys. The first machine for producing large quantities of corrugated board was built in 1874 by G. Smyth, and in the same year Oliver Long improved upon Jones&#x27; design by inventing corrugated board with liner sheets on both sides, thereby inventing corrugated board as it came to be known in modern times.

Scottish-born Robert Gair invented the pre-cut paperboard box in 1890 – flat pieces manufactured in bulk that folded into boxes. Gair&#x27;s invention resulted from an accident. He was a Brooklyn printer and paper-bag maker during the 1870s. While he was printing seed bags, a metal ruler used to crease bags shifted in position and cut them. Gair discovered that by cutting and creasing in one operation he could make prefabricated paperboard boxes. Applying this idea to corrugated boxboard was a straightforward development when the material became available in the early 20th century.

The corrugated box was first used for packaging glass and pottery containers. In the mid-1950s, the corrugated fiberboard case enabled fruit and produce to be shipped from farm to retailer without bruising, improving the return to producers and opening export markets.

==Properties==
Several properties and characteristics can be measured for corrugated board. Some of these include:
* Moisture content ranges from 6.5 to 9.5%. If moisture is below a certain limit it will cause cracking in corrugated board and if it is above then it will reduce the compression strength of board.
* Edge crush test measures force per unit width and predicts Box compression strength. It is reported in KN/m or lb/inch.
* Burst strength is the pressure required to rupture corrugated sheet. It is reported in KPa or lb/inch2. 
* Box Compression strength is the direct measurement of performance of corrugated boxes. It is reported in kgf or N.
* Flat crush test measures flutes rigidity and reported in KPa.
* Bending resistance
* Impact resistance
* Cushioning, shock absorption
* Tear resistance
* Grammage is the weight per meter square of any material. It is reported in g/m2

Corrugated fiberboard is anisotropic; many of its properties are highly directional. For example, edge crush, bending stiffness, tensile, and surface characteristics are different, depending on the orientation to the flutes and the machine direction of manufacture.

==Manufacturing==

Corrugated board is manufactured on large high-precision machinery lines called corrugators, usually running at about or more. These machines, over time, have become very complex with the objective of avoiding some common problems in corrugated board production, such as warp and washboarding.

The key raw material in corrugating is paper, different grades for each layer making up the corrugated box. Due to supply chain and scale considerations, paper is produced in separate plants called paper mills. Most corrugating plants keep an inventory of paper reels.

In the classical corrugator, the paper is softened with high-pressure steam. After the board is formed it is dried in the so-called dry-end. Here the newly formed corrugated board is heated from the bottom by hot plates. On the top, various pressures are applied by a load system on the belt.

The corrugated medium is often basis weight in the US; in the UK, a fluting paper is common. At the single-facer, it is heated, moistened, and formed into a fluted pattern on geared wheels. This is joined to a flat linerboard with a starch based adhesive to form single face board. At the double-backer, a second flat linerboard is adhered to the other side of the fluted medium to form single wall corrugated board. Linerboards are test liners (recycled paper) or kraft paperboard (of various grades). The liner may be bleached white, mottled white, colored, or preprinted.

Common flute sizes are &quot;A&quot;, &quot;B&quot;, &quot;C&quot;, &quot;E&quot; and &quot;F&quot; or microflute. The letter designation relates to the order that the flutes were invented, not the relative sizes. Flute size refers to the number of flutes per linear foot, although the actual flute dimensions for different corrugator manufacturers may vary slightly. Measuring the number of flutes per linear foot is a more reliable method of identifying flute size than measuring board thickness, which can vary due to manufacturing conditions. The most common flute size in corrugated boxes is &quot;C&quot; flute.

Corrugated fiberboard can be specified by the construction (single face, singlewall, doublewall, etc.), flute size, burst strength, edge crush strength, flat crush, basis weights of components (pounds per thousand square feet, grams per square meter, etc.), surface treatments and coatings, etc. TAPPI and ASTM test methods for these are standardized.

The choice of corrugated medium, flute size, combining adhesive, and linerboards can be varied to engineer a corrugated board with specific properties to match a wide variety of potential uses. Double and triple-wall corrugated board is also produced for high stacking strength and puncture resistance.

Most corrugators are &quot;two knife&quot; corrugators, which means that they can produce two different sheet lengths side-by-side. This leads to an optimisation problem, known as the cutting stock problem.

==Box manufacture process==
===Box design===

Packaging engineers design corrugated boxes to meet the particular needs of the product being shipped, the hazards of the shipping environment (shock, vibration, compression, moisture, etc.), and the marketing needs of retailers and consumers.

The most common box style is the Regular Slotted Container (RSC). All flaps are the same length from the score to the edge. Typically, the longer major flaps meet in the middle and the minor flaps do not. However, with the rise of E-commerce and a more competitive retail environment, box designs are becoming more dynamic and functional, straying away from typical shipping box designs.

The manufacturer&#x27;s joint is most often joined with adhesive but may also be taped or stitched. The box is shipped flat (knocked down) to the packager who sets up the box, fills it, and closes it for shipment. Box closure may be by tape, adhesive, staples, strapping, etc.

The size of a box can be measured for either internal (for product fit) or external (for handling machinery or palletizing) dimensions. Boxes are usually specified and ordered by the internal dimensions.

===Box maker&#x27;s certificate===

A box maker&#x27;s certificate (also known as &quot;box certificate&quot;, or &quot;box certificate of maker&quot;) is a seal printed on an outside surface, typically the bottom of the box, that includes some information about how strong the box is. The certificate is not required, but if used, it implies compliance with regulations relating to the certificate. Significant information includes:

*Bursting Test or Edge Crush Test
*Size Limit (the maximum outside dimensions of a finished box when the length, width and depth of the box are added together)
*Gross Weight Limit

===Manufacturing===
Boxes can be formed in the same plant as the corrugator. Such plants are known as &quot;integrated plants&quot;. Part of the scoring and cutting takes place in-line on the corrugator. Alternatively, sheets of corrugated board may be sent to a different manufacturing facility for box fabrication; these are sometimes called &quot;sheet plants&quot; or &quot;converters&quot;.

The corrugated board is creased or scored to provide controlled bending of the board. Most often, slots are cut to provide flaps on the box. Scoring and slotting can also be accomplished by die-cutting. Along with the print being produced on the box in these plants. These conversions are produced on different machines, depending on the conversion being made: &quot;Flexo Folder Gluers (FFG)&quot;, &quot;Rotary Die Cutters (RDC), &quot;Printer Slotters&quot; or &quot; Printing Presses&quot;.

===Single-face laminate===
A limitation of common corrugated material has been the difficulty in applying fine graphic print for informative and marketing purposes. The reasons for this stem from the fact that prefabricated corrugated sheets are relatively thick and spongy, compared to the thin and incompressible nature of solid fibre paper such as paperboard. Due to these characteristics of corrugated, it has been mainly printed using a flexographic process, which is by nature a coarse application with loose registration properties.

A more recent development popular in usage is a hybrid product featuring the structural benefits of corrugated combined with the high-graphics print of lithography previously restricted to paperboard folding cartons. This application, generally referred to as &quot;Single-Face Laminate&quot; (SFL), begins its process as a traditional fluted medium adhered to a single linerboard (single-face), but in place of a second long-fibered liner, a pre-printed sheet of paperboard such as SBS (solid bleached sulfate) is laminated to the outer facing. The sheet can then be converted with the same processes used for other corrugated manufacturing into any desired form.

Specialized equipment is necessary for the material construction of SFL, so users may expect to pay a premium for these products. However, this cost is often offset by the savings over a separate paperboard sleeve and the labor necessary to assemble the completed package.

==Recycling==
Old corrugated containers (OCC) are an excellent source of fiber for recycling. They can be compressed and baled for cost effective transport. The baled boxes are put in a hydropulper, which is a large vat of warm water for cleaning and processing. The pulp slurry is then used to make new paper and fiber products.

Mill and corrugator scrap, or &quot;broke&quot;, is the cleanest source for recycling. The high rates of post-consumer recycling reflect the efficiency of recycling mills to clean and process the incoming materials. Several technologies are available to sort, screen, filter, and chemically treat the recycled paper.

Many extraneous materials are readily removed. Twine, strapping, etc. are removed from the hydropulper by a &quot;ragger&quot;. Metal straps and staples can be screened out or removed by a magnet. Film-backed pressure-sensitive tape stays intact: the PSA adhesive and the backing are both removed together.

Materials which are more difficult to remove include wax coatings on corrugated boxes and &quot;stickies&quot;, soft rubbery particles which can clog the paper maker and contaminate the recycled paper. Stickies can originate from book bindings, hot melt adhesives, pressure-sensitive adhesives from paper labels, laminating adhesives of reinforced gummed tapes, etc.

Corrugated fiberboard shredders are now available which convert post-consumer corrugated board into packing/cushioning materials by means of a specialized shredding process.

<text>Gottfried Wilhelm Bitzer (April 21, 1872 – April 29, 1944) was an American cinematographer, notable for his close association and pioneering work with D. W. Griffith.

==Biography==
Prior to his career as a cameraman, working as a motion picture projectionist, Bitzer developed early cinematic technologies for the American Mutoscope Company, eventually to become the Biograph Company. He admired and learned the art of motion picture photography from Kinetoscope inventor W. K. L. Dickson, who directed the early Biograph shorts on which Bitzer cut his teeth. Bitzer achieved success in 1896 when his film of William McKinley being notified of the presidential nomination of his party was exhibited on the Biograph Company&#x27;s first program. Until 1903, Bitzer was employed by Biograph primarily as a documentary photographer, and from 1903 onward primarily as the photographer of narrative films, as these gained popularity.

In 1908 Bitzer entered into his first collaboration with Griffith. The two would work together for the rest of Bitzer&#x27;s career, leaving Biograph in 1913 for the Mutual Film Corporation where Bitzer continued to innovate, perfecting existing technologies and inventing new ones. During this time he pioneered the field of matte photography and made use of innovative lighting techniques, closeups, and iris shots.

Bitzer provided assistance during Griffith&#x27;s directorial debut, 1908&#x27;s &quot;The Adventures of Dollie&quot;, which was shot by Arthur Marvin. He eventually succeeded Marvin as Griffith&#x27;s regular cinematographer, working with him on some of his most important films and contributing significantly to cinematic innovations attributed to Griffith. In 1910, he photographed Griffith&#x27;s silent short &quot;In Old California&quot; in the Los Angeles village of &quot;Hollywoodland&quot;, qualifying Bitzer as, arguably, Hollywood&#x27;s first Director of Photography. The apex of Bitzer and Griffith&#x27;s collaboration came with &quot;The Birth of a Nation&quot; (1915), a film funded in part by Bitzer&#x27;s life savings, and the epic &quot;Intolerance&quot; (1916).

His film &quot;The Jeffries-Sharkey Fight of 1899&quot; is the first known use of artificial light. &quot;Rip Van Winkle&quot; (1903) features the first known close-up. Advances in lenses and filters developed by Bitzer made soft focus possible. He was the first to use split-screen photography and backlighting, contributing to the development of three-point lighting. He improved in-camera fade and dissolve effects and invented what came to be known as transition tools. Even after the Bell &amp; Howell Model 2709 production camera became the industry standard, he continued to use a Pathe.

For all his innovation, Bitzer&#x27;s career did not survive the industry&#x27;s transition to sound. In 1944, he suffered a heart attack and died in Hollywood.

His autobiography, &quot;Billy Bitzer: His Story&quot;, was published posthumously in 1973.

In 2003, a survey conducted by the International Cinematographers Guild named him one of the ten most influential cinematographers in history. Bitzer, it is said, &quot;developed camera techniques that set the standard for all future motion pictures&quot;.

<doc id="76811" wikidata="Q152245" url="?curid=76811" title="Prince Albert of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha">
<text>Prince Albert of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha (Franz August Karl Albert Emanuel; 26 August 1819 – 14 December 1861) was the husband of Queen Victoria. As such, he was consort of the British monarch from their marriage on 10 February 1840 until his death in 1861. Victoria granted him the title Prince Consort in 1857.

Albert was born in the Saxon duchy of Saxe-Coburg-Saalfeld to a family connected to many of Europe&#x27;s ruling monarchs. At the age of 20, he married Victoria, his first cousin, with whom he had nine children. Initially, he felt constrained by his role as consort, which did not afford him power or responsibilities. He gradually developed a reputation for supporting public causes, such as educational reform and the abolition of slavery worldwide, and he was entrusted with running the Queen&#x27;s household, office and estates. He was heavily involved with the organisation of the Great Exhibition of 1851, which was a resounding success.

Victoria came to depend more and more on Albert&#x27;s support and guidance. He aided the development of Britain&#x27;s constitutional monarchy by persuading his wife to be less partisan in her dealings with the British parliament, but he actively disagreed with the interventionist foreign policy pursued during Lord Palmerston&#x27;s tenure as Foreign Secretary. Albert died in 1861 at the age of 42, devastating Victoria so much that she entered into a deep state of mourning and wore black for the rest of her life. On the day of her death in 1901, their eldest son succeeded as Edward VII, the first British monarch of the House of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha, named after the ducal house to which Albert belonged.

== Early life ==

Prince Albert was born on 26 August 1819 at Schloss Rosenau, near Coburg, Germany, the second son of Ernest III, Duke of Saxe-Coburg-Saalfeld, and his first wife, Louise of Saxe-Gotha-Altenburg. His first cousin and future wife, Victoria, had been born earlier in the same year with the assistance of the same midwife, Charlotte von Siebold. He was baptised into the Lutheran Evangelical Church on 19 September 1819 in the Marble Hall at Schloss Rosenau, with water taken from the local river, the Itz. His godparents were his paternal grandmother, the Dowager Duchess of Saxe-Coburg-Saalfeld; his maternal grandfather, the Duke of Saxe-Gotha-Altenburg; the Emperor of Austria; the Duke of Teschen; and Emanuel, Count of Mensdorff-Pouilly. In 1825, Albert&#x27;s great-uncle, Frederick IV, Duke of Saxe-Gotha-Altenburg, died, which led to a realignment of the Saxon duchies the following year; and Albert&#x27;s father became the first reigning duke of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha.

Albert and his elder brother, Ernest, spent their youth in close companionship, which was marred by their parents&#x27; turbulent marriage and eventual separation and divorce. After their mother was exiled from court in 1824, she married her lover, Alexander von Hanstein, Count of Pölzig and Beiersdorf. She presumably never saw her children again, and died of cancer at the age of 30 in 1831. The following year, their father married his niece Princess Marie of Württemberg; their marriage was not close, however, and Marie had little—if any—impact on her stepsons&#x27; lives.

The brothers were educated privately at home by Christoph Florschütz and later studied in Brussels, where Adolphe Quetelet was one of their tutors. Like many other German princes, Albert attended the University of Bonn, where he studied law, political economy, philosophy and the history of art. He played music and he excelled at sport, especially fencing and riding. His tutors at Bonn included the philosopher Fichte and the poet Schlegel.

== Marriage ==
The idea of marriage between Albert and his first cousin Victoria was first documented in an 1821 letter from his paternal grandmother, the Dowager Duchess of Saxe-Coburg-Saalfeld, who said that he was &quot;the pendant to the pretty cousin&quot;. By 1836, this idea had also arisen in the mind of their ambitious uncle Leopold, who had been King of the Belgians since 1831. At this time, Victoria was the heir presumptive to the British throne. Her father, Prince Edward, Duke of Kent and Strathearn, the fourth son of King George III, had died when she was an infant, and her elderly uncle, King William IV, had no surviving legitimate children. Her mother, the Duchess of Kent, was the sister of both Albert&#x27;s father—the Duke of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha—and King Leopold. Leopold arranged for his sister, Victoria&#x27;s mother, to invite the Duke of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha and his two sons to visit her in May 1836, with the purpose of meeting Victoria. William IV, however, disapproved of any match with the Coburgs, and instead favoured the suit of Prince Alexander, second son of the Prince of Orange. Victoria was well aware of the various matrimonial plans and critically appraised a parade of eligible princes. She wrote, &quot;[Albert] is extremely handsome; his hair is about the same colour as mine; his eyes are large and blue, and he has a beautiful nose and a very sweet mouth with fine teeth; but the charm of his countenance is his expression, which is most delightful.&quot; Alexander, on the other hand, she described as &quot;very plain&quot;.

Victoria wrote to her uncle Leopold to thank him &quot;for the prospect of &quot;great&quot; happiness you have contributed to give me, in the person of dear Albert ... He possesses every quality that could be desired to render me perfectly happy.&quot; Although the parties did not undertake a formal engagement, both the family and their retainers widely assumed that the match would take place.

Victoria came to the throne on 20 June 1837, aged 18. Her letters of the time show interest in Albert&#x27;s education for the role he would have to play, although she resisted attempts to rush her into marriage. In the winter of 1838–1839, the prince visited Italy, accompanied by the Coburg family&#x27;s confidential adviser, Baron Stockmar.
Albert returned to the United Kingdom with Ernest in October 1839 to visit Victoria, with the objective of settling the marriage. Albert and Victoria felt mutual affection and the Queen proposed to him on 15 October 1839. Victoria&#x27;s intention to marry was declared formally to the Privy Council on 23 November, and the couple married on 10 February 1840 at the Chapel Royal, St James&#x27;s Palace. Just before the marriage, Albert was naturalised by an Act of Parliament, and granted the style of &quot;Royal Highness&quot; by an Order in Council.

Initially Albert was not popular with the British public; he was perceived to be from an impoverished and undistinguished minor state, barely larger than a small English county. The British prime minister, Lord Melbourne, advised the Queen against granting her husband the title of &quot;King Consort&quot;; Parliament also objected to Albert being created a peer—partly because of anti-German sentiment and a desire to exclude Albert from any political role. Albert&#x27;s religious views provided a small amount of controversy when the marriage was debated in Parliament: although as a member of the Lutheran Evangelical Church Albert was a Protestant, the non-Episcopal nature of his church was considered worrisome. Of greater concern, however, was that some of Albert&#x27;s family were Roman Catholic. Melbourne led a minority government and the opposition took advantage of the marriage to weaken his position further. They opposed a British peerage for Albert and granted him a smaller annuity than previous consorts, £30,000 instead of the usual £50,000. Albert claimed that he had no need of a British peerage, writing: &quot;It would almost be a step downwards, for as a Duke of Saxony, I feel myself much higher than a Duke of York or Kent.&quot; For the next seventeen years, Albert was formally titled &quot;HRH Prince Albert&quot; until, on 25 June 1857, Victoria formally granted him the title Prince Consort. Victoria explained, in a letter to Lord Palmerston on 15 March 1857, that she was: &quot;... inclined ... to content herself by simply giving her husband by Letters Patent the title of &#x27;Prince Consort&#x27; which can injure no one while it will give him an &quot;English title&quot; consistent with his position, &amp; avoid his being treated by Foreign Courts as a &quot;junior Member&quot; of the house &quot;of Saxe-Coburg&quot;&quot;.

== Consort of the Queen ==

The position in which Albert was placed by his marriage, while one of distinction, also offered considerable difficulties; in his own words, &quot;I am very happy and contented; but the difficulty in filling my place with the proper dignity is that I am only the husband, not the master in the house.&quot; The Queen&#x27;s household was run by her former governess, Baroness Lehzen. Albert referred to her as the &quot;House Dragon&quot;, and manoeuvred to dislodge the Baroness from her position.

Within two months of the marriage, Victoria was pregnant. Albert started to take on public roles; he became President of the Society for the Extinction of Slavery (slavery was still lawful in most parts of the world beyond the British Empire); and helped Victoria privately with her government paperwork.

In June 1840, while on a public carriage ride, Albert and the pregnant Victoria were shot at by Edward Oxford, who was later judged insane. Neither Albert nor Victoria was hurt, and Albert was praised in the newspapers for his courage and coolness during the attack. He was gaining public support as well as political influence, which showed itself practically when, in August, Parliament passed the Regency Act 1840 to designate him regent in the event of Victoria&#x27;s death before their child reached the age of majority. Their first child, Victoria, named after her mother, was born in November. Eight other children would follow over the next seventeen years. All nine children survived to adulthood, which was remarkable for the era; biographer Hermione Hobhouse credited the healthy running of the nursery on Albert&#x27;s &quot;enlightened influence&quot;. In early 1841, he successfully removed the nursery from Lehzen&#x27;s pervasive control, and in September 1842, Lehzen left Britain permanently—much to Albert&#x27;s relief.

After the 1841 general election, Melbourne was replaced as prime minister by Sir Robert Peel, who appointed Albert chairman of the royal commission in charge of redecorating the new Palace of Westminster. The Palace had burned down seven years before, and was being rebuilt. The commission was set up to promote the fine arts in Britain as a patron and purchaser of pictures and sculpture. The commission&#x27;s work was slow, and the palace&#x27;s architect, Charles Barry, took many decisions out of the commissioners&#x27; hands by decorating rooms with ornate furnishings that were treated as part of the architecture. Albert was more successful as a private patron and collector. Among his notable acquisitions were early German and Italian paintings—such as Lucas Cranach the Elder&#x27;s &quot;Apollo and Diana&quot; and Fra Angelico&#x27;s &quot;St Peter Martyr&quot;—and contemporary pieces from Franz Xaver Winterhalter and Edwin Landseer. Ludwig Gruner, of Dresden, assisted Albert in buying artworks of the highest quality.

Albert and Victoria were shot at again on both 29 and 30 May 1842, but were unhurt. The culprit, John Francis, was detained and condemned to death, although he was later reprieved. Some of the couple&#x27;s early unpopularity came about because of their stiffness and adherence to protocol in public, though in private the couple were more easy-going. In early 1844, Victoria and Albert were apart for the first time since their marriage when he returned to Coburg on the death of his father.
By 1844, Albert had managed to modernise the royal finances and, through various economies, had sufficient capital to purchase Osborne House on the Isle of Wight as a private residence for their growing family. Over the next few years a house modelled in the style of an Italianate villa was built to the designs of Albert and Thomas Cubitt. Albert laid out the grounds, and improved the estate and farm. Albert managed and improved the other royal estates; his model farm at Windsor (Shaw Farm) was admired by his biographers, and under his stewardship the revenues of the Duchy of Cornwall—the hereditary property of the Prince of Wales—steadily increased.

Unlike many landowners who approved of child labour and opposed Peel&#x27;s repeal of the Corn Laws, Albert supported moves to raise working ages and free up trade. In 1846, Albert was rebuked by Lord George Bentinck when he attended the debate on the Corn Laws in the House of Commons to give tacit support to Peel. During Peel&#x27;s premiership, Albert&#x27;s authority behind, or beside, the throne became more apparent. He had access to all the Queen&#x27;s papers, was drafting her correspondence and was present when she met her ministers; he would even see them alone in her absence. The clerk of the Privy Council, Charles Greville, wrote of him: &quot;He is King to all intents and purposes.&quot;

In 1847, Victoria and Albert spent a rainy holiday in the west of Scotland at Loch Laggan, but heard from their doctor, Sir James Clark, that Clark&#x27;s son had enjoyed dry, sunny days farther east at Balmoral Castle. The tenant of Balmoral, Sir Robert Gordon, died suddenly in early October, and Albert began negotiations to take over the lease from the owner, the Earl Fife. In May the following year, Albert leased Balmoral, which he had never visited. In September 1848 he, his wife and their older children went there for the first time. They came to relish the privacy it afforded.

== Reformer and innovator ==

According to historian G. M. Trevelyan, regarding the Prince and home affairs: 

In 1847, Albert was elected Chancellor of the University of Cambridge after a close contest with the Earl of Powis. Albert used his position as chancellor to campaign successfully for reformed and more modern university curricula by expanding the subjects taught beyond the traditional mathematics and classics to include modern history and the natural sciences.

Revolutions spread throughout Europe in 1848 as a result of a widespread economic crisis. Throughout the year, Victoria and Albert complained about Foreign Secretary Palmerston&#x27;s independent foreign policy, which they believed further destabilised Continental European powers. Albert was concerned for many of his royal relatives, a number of whom were deposed by revolutionaries. He and Victoria, who gave birth to their daughter Louise during that year, spent some time away from London in the relative safety of Osborne. Although there were sporadic demonstrations in England, no effective revolutionary action took place.

Albert gained public acclaim when he expressed paternalistic yet well-meaning and philanthropic views. In an 1848 speech to the Society for the Improvement of the Condition of the Labouring Classes, of which he was president, he expressed his &quot;sympathy and interest for that class of our community who have most of the toil and fewest of the enjoyments of this world&quot;. It was the &quot;duty of those who, under the blessings of Divine Providence, enjoy station, wealth, and education&quot; to assist those less fortunate than themselves.
His progressive and relatively liberal ideas were expressed by his support of emancipation, technological progress, science education, the ideas of Charles Darwin, and the welfare of the working classes. Albert led reforms in university education, welfare and the royal finances, and supported the campaign against slavery. He also had a special interest in applying science and art to manufacturing industry.

The Great Exhibition of 1851 arose from the annual exhibitions of the Society of Arts, of which Albert was president from 1843, and owed most of its success to his efforts to promote it. Albert served as president of the Royal Commission for the Exhibition of 1851, and had to fight for every stage of the project. In the House of Lords, Lord Brougham fulminated against the proposal to hold the exhibition in Hyde Park. Opponents of the exhibition prophesied that foreign rogues and revolutionists would overrun England, subvert the morals of the people, and destroy their faith. Albert thought such talk absurd and quietly persevered, trusting always that British manufacturing would benefit from exposure to the best products of foreign countries.

Victoria opened the exhibition on 1 May 1851 in a specially designed and built glass building known as the Crystal Palace. It proved a colossal success. A surplus of £180,000 was used to purchase land in South Kensington on which to establish educational and cultural institutions, including the Natural History Museum, Science Museum, Imperial College London and what would later be named the Royal Albert Hall and the Victoria and Albert Museum. The area was referred to as &quot;Albertopolis&quot; by sceptics.

== Family and public life (1852–1859)==

In 1852, John Camden Neild, an eccentric miser, left Victoria an unexpected legacy, which Albert used to obtain the freehold of Balmoral. As usual, he embarked on an extensive programme of improvements. The same year, he was appointed to several of the offices left vacant by the death of the Duke of Wellington, including the mastership of Trinity House and the colonelcy of the Grenadier Guards. With Wellington&#x27;s death, Albert was able to propose and campaign for modernisation of the army, which was long overdue. Thinking that the military was unready for war and that Christian rule was preferable to Islamic rule, Albert counselled a diplomatic solution to conflict between the Russian and Ottoman empires. Palmerston was more bellicose, and favoured a policy that would prevent further Russian expansion. Palmerston was manoeuvred out of the cabinet in December 1853, but at about the same time a Russian fleet attacked the Ottoman fleet at anchor at Sinop. The London press depicted the attack as a criminal massacre, and Palmerston&#x27;s popularity surged as Albert&#x27;s fell. Within two weeks, Palmerston was re-appointed a minister. As public outrage at the Russian action continued, false rumours circulated that Albert had been arrested for treason and was being held prisoner in the Tower of London.

By March 1854, Britain and Russia were embroiled in the Crimean War. Albert devised a master plan for winning the war by laying siege to Sevastopol while starving Russia economically, which became the Allied strategy after the Tsar decided to fight a purely defensive war. Early British optimism soon faded as the press reported that British troops were ill-equipped and mismanaged by aged generals using out-of-date tactics and strategy. The conflict dragged on as the Russians were as poorly prepared as their opponents. The Prime Minister, Lord Aberdeen, resigned, and Palmerston succeeded him. A negotiated settlement eventually put an end to the war by the March 1856 Treaty of Paris. During the war, Albert arranged the marriage of his fourteen-year-old daughter, Victoria, to Prince Frederick William of Prussia, but Albert delayed the marriage until Victoria was seventeen. Albert hoped that his daughter and son-in-law would be a liberalising influence in the enlarging but very conservative Prussian state.

Albert promoted many public educational institutions. Chiefly at meetings in connection with them, he spoke of the need for better schooling. A collection of his speeches was published in 1857. Recognised as a supporter of education and technological progress, he was invited to speak at scientific meetings, such as the memorable address he delivered as president of the British Association for the Advancement of Science when it met at Aberdeen in 1859. His espousal of science met with clerical opposition; he and Palmerston unsuccessfully recommended a knighthood for Charles Darwin, after the publication of &quot;On the Origin of Species&quot;, which was opposed by the Bishop of Oxford.

Albert continued to devote himself to the education of his family and the management of the royal household. His children&#x27;s governess, Lady Lyttelton, thought him unusually kind and patient, and described him joining in family games with enthusiasm. He felt keenly the departure of his eldest daughter for Prussia when she married her fiancé at the beginning of 1858, and was disappointed that his eldest son, the Prince of Wales, did not respond well to the intense educational programme that Albert had designed for him. At the age of seven, the Prince of Wales was expected to take six hours of instruction, including an hour of German and an hour of French every day. When the Prince of Wales failed at his lessons, Albert caned him. Corporal punishment was common at the time, and was not thought unduly harsh. Albert&#x27;s biographer Roger Fulford wrote that the relationships between the family members were &quot;friendly, affectionate and normal ... there is no evidence either in the Royal Archives or in the printed authorities to justify the belief that the relations between the Prince and his eldest son were other than deeply affectionate&quot;. Philip Magnus wrote in his biography of Albert&#x27;s eldest son that Albert &quot;tried to treat his children as equals; and they were able to penetrate his stiffness and reserve because they realised instinctively not only that he loved them but that he enjoyed and needed their company&quot;.

Albert was a talented amateur musician and composer. For his wedding, he composed a duet, &quot;Die Liebe hat uns nun vereint&quot; (&quot;Love has now united us&quot;). Felix Mendelssohn described Albert playing the Buckingham Palace organ &quot;so charmingly and clearly and correctly that it would have done credit to any professional&quot;. After tuition from George Elvey, the organist at St George&#x27;s Chapel, Windsor, Albert composed several choral pieces for Anglican worship, including settings of the &quot;Te Deum&quot; and &quot;Jubilate&quot;, and an anthem, &quot;Out of the Deep&quot;. His secular compositions included a cantata, &quot;L&#x27;Invocazione all&#x27;armonia&quot;, and &quot;Melody for the Violin&quot;, which Yehudi Menuhin later described as &quot;pleasant music without presumption&quot;.

== Illness and death ==

In August 1859, Albert fell seriously ill with stomach cramps. His steadily worsening medical condition led to a sense of despair; the biographer Robert Rhodes James describes Albert as having lost &quot;the will to live&quot;. Albert later had an accidental brush with death during a trip to Coburg in October 1860, when he was driving alone in a carriage drawn by four horses that suddenly bolted. As the horses continued to gallop toward a wagon waiting at a railway crossing, Albert jumped for his life from the carriage. One of the horses was killed in the collision, and Albert was badly shaken though his only physical injuries were cuts and bruises. He confided in his brother and eldest daughter that he sensed that his time had come.

Victoria&#x27;s mother and Albert&#x27;s aunt, the Duchess of Kent, died in March 1861, and Victoria was grief-stricken. Albert took on most of the Queen&#x27;s duties despite his continuing chronic stomach trouble. The last public event over which he presided was the opening of the Royal Horticultural Gardens on 5 June 1861. In August, Victoria and Albert visited the Curragh Camp, Ireland, where the Prince of Wales was attending army manoeuvres. At the Curragh, the Prince of Wales was introduced by his fellow officers to Nellie Clifden, an Irish actress.

By November, Victoria and Albert had returned to Windsor, and the Prince of Wales had returned to Cambridge, where he was a student. Two of Albert&#x27;s young cousins, King Pedro V of Portugal and his brother Ferdinand, died of typhoid fever within five days of each other in early November. On top of that news, Albert was informed that gossip was spreading in gentlemen&#x27;s clubs and the foreign press that the Prince of Wales was involved with Nellie Clifden. Albert and Victoria were horrified by their son&#x27;s indiscretion and feared blackmail, scandal or pregnancy. Although Albert was ill and at a low ebb, he travelled to Cambridge to see the Prince of Wales on 25 November and discuss the indiscreet affair. In his final weeks, Albert suffered from pains in his back and legs.

Also in November 1861, the &quot;Trent&quot; Affair—the forcible removal of Confederate envoys from a British ship, the RMS &quot;Trent&quot;, by Union forces during the American Civil War—threatened war between the United States and Britain. The British government prepared an ultimatum and readied a military response. Albert was gravely ill but intervened to defuse the crisis. In a few hours, he revised the British demands in a manner that allowed the Lincoln administration to surrender the Confederate commissioners who had been seized from the &quot;Trent&quot; and to issue a public apology to London without losing face. The key idea, based on a suggestion from &quot;The Times&quot;, was to give Washington the opportunity to deny that it had officially authorised the seizure and thereby to apologise for the captain&#x27;s mistake.

On 9 December, one of Albert&#x27;s doctors, William Jenner, diagnosed him with typhoid fever. Albert died at 10:50 p.m. on 14 December 1861 in the Blue Room at Windsor Castle, in the presence of the Queen and five of their nine children. He was 42 years old. The contemporary diagnosis was typhoid fever, but modern writers have pointed out that Albert&#x27;s ongoing stomach pain, which left him ill for at least two years before his death, may indicate that a chronic disease such as Crohn&#x27;s disease, kidney failure or abdominal cancer was the cause of death.

The Queen&#x27;s grief was overwhelming, and the tepid feelings that the public had for Albert were replaced by sympathy. The widowed Victoria never recovered from Albert&#x27;s death; she entered into a deep state of mourning and wore black for the rest of her life. Albert&#x27;s rooms in all his houses were kept as they had been even with hot water brought in the morning and linen and towels changed daily. Such practices were common in the houses of the very rich.

=== Funeral ===
Albert&#x27;s funeral was held on 23 December 1861 at St George&#x27;s Chapel, Windsor Castle. His body was temporarily entombed in the chapel&#x27;s Royal Vault. A year after his death, his remains were deposited at the Royal Mausoleum, Frogmore, which remained incomplete until 1871. The sarcophagus, in which both he and Victoria were eventually laid, was carved from the largest block of granite that had ever been quarried in Britain. Despite Albert&#x27;s request for no effigies of him to be raised, many public monuments were erected all over the country and across the British Empire. The most notable are the Royal Albert Hall and the Albert Memorial in London. The plethora of memorials erected to Albert became so great that Charles Dickens told a friend that he sought an &quot;inaccessible cave&quot; to escape from them.

== Legacy ==
After Albert&#x27;s death, Victoria withdrew from public life and her seclusion eroded some of Albert&#x27;s work in attempting to remodel the monarchy as a national institution by setting a moral, if not political, example. Albert is credited with introducing the principle that the British royal family should remain above politics. Before his marriage to Victoria, she supported the Whigs. For example, early in her reign, Victoria had managed to thwart the formation of a Tory government by Sir Robert Peel by refusing to accept substitutions that Peel wanted to make among her ladies-in-waiting.

Albert showed a keen interest in the improvement of army training, and was involved in the establishment and development of Aldershot in Hampshire as a garrison town and training base in the 1850s. A wooden Royal Pavilion was built there in which he and Victoria would often stay when they attended military reviews. Albert established and endowed the Prince Consort&#x27;s Library at Aldershot, which still exists.

Biographies published after his death were typically heavy on eulogy. Theodore Martin&#x27;s five-volume &quot;magnum opus&quot; was authorised and supervised by Queen Victoria, and her influence shows in its pages. Nevertheless, it is an accurate and exhaustive account. Lytton Strachey&#x27;s &quot;Queen Victoria&quot; (1921) was more critical, but it was discredited in part by mid-20th-century biographers such as Hector Bolitho and Roger Fulford, who, unlike Strachey, had access to Victoria&#x27;s journal and letters.

Popular myths about Prince Albert, such as the claim that he introduced Christmas trees to Britain, are dismissed by scholars. Recent biographers such as Stanley Weintraub portray Albert as a figure in a tragic romance who died too soon and was mourned by his lover for a lifetime. In the 2009 film &quot;The Young Victoria&quot;, Albert, played by Rupert Friend, is made into a heroic character. In the fictionalised depiction of the 1840 shooting, he is struck by a bullet, which did not happen in real life.

=== Foreign honours ===
=== Arms ===
Upon his marriage to Queen Victoria in 1840, Prince Albert received a personal grant of arms, being the royal coat of arms of the United Kingdom differenced by a white three-point label with a red cross in the centre, quartered with his ancestral arms of Saxony. They are blazoned: &quot;Quarterly, 1st and 4th, the Royal Arms, with overall a label of three points Argent charged on the centre with cross Gules; 2nd and 3rd, Barry of ten Or and Sable, a crown of rue in bend Vert&quot;. The arms are unusual, being described by S. T. Aveling as a &quot;singular example of quartering differenced arms, [which] is not in accordance with the rules of Heraldry, and is in itself an heraldic contradiction.&quot; Prior to his marriage Albert used the arms of his father undifferenced, in accordance with German custom.

Albert&#x27;s Garter stall plate displays his arms surmounted by a royal crown with six crests for the House of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha; these are from left to right: 1. &quot;A bull&#x27;s head caboshed Gules armed and ringed Argent, crowned Or, the rim chequy Gules and Argent&quot; for Mark. 2. &quot;Out of a coronet Or, two buffalo horns Argent, attached to the outer edge of five branches fesswise each with three linden leaves Vert&quot; for Thuringia. 3. &quot;Out of a coronet Or, a pyramidal chapeau charged with the arms of Saxony ensigned by a plume of peacock feathers Proper out of a coronet also Or&quot; for Saxony. 4. &quot;A bearded man in profile couped below the shoulders clothed paly Argent and Gules, the pointed coronet similarly paly terminating in a plume of three peacock feathers&quot; for Meissen. 5. &quot;A demi griffin displayed Or, winged Sable, collared and langued Gules&quot; for Jülich. 6. &quot;Out of a coronet Or, a panache of peacock feathers Proper&quot; for Berg.
The supporters were the crowned lion of England and the unicorn of Scotland (as in the Royal Arms) charged on the shoulder with a label as in the arms. Albert&#x27;s personal motto is the German (Loyal and Sure). This motto was also used by Prince Albert&#x27;s Own or the 11th Hussars.
== Issue ==

Prince Albert&#x27;s 42 grandchildren included four reigning monarchs: King George V of the United Kingdom; Wilhelm II, German Emperor; Ernest Louis, Grand Duke of Hesse; and Charles Edward, Duke of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha, and five consorts of monarchs: Empress Alexandra of Russia and Queens Maud of Norway, Sophia of Greece, Victoria Eugenie of Spain, and Marie of Romania. Albert&#x27;s many descendants include royalty and nobility throughout Europe.

<text>Dippers are members of the genus Cinclus in the bird family Cinclidae, so-called because of their bobbing or dipping movements. They are unique among passerines for their ability to dive and swim underwater.

==Taxonomy==
The genus &quot;Cinclus&quot; was introduced by the German naturalist Moritz Balthasar Borkhausen in 1797 with the white-throated dipper (&quot;Cinclus cinclus&quot;) as the type species. The name &quot;cinclus&quot; is from the Ancient Greek word &quot;kinklos&quot; that was used to describe small tail-wagging birds that resided near water.

&quot;Cinclus&quot; is the only genus in the family Cinclidae. The white-throated dipper and American dipper are also known in Britain and America, respectively, as the &quot;water ouzel&quot; (sometimes spelt &quot;ousel&quot;) – ouzel originally meant the only distantly related but superficially similar Eurasian blackbird (Old English &quot;osle&quot;). Ouzel also survives as the name of a relative of the blackbird, the ring ouzel.

The genus contains five species:
*White-throated dipper or European dipper, &quot;Cinclus cinclus&quot;
*Brown dipper &quot;Cinclus pallasii&quot;
*American dipper &quot;Cinclus mexicanus&quot;
*White-capped dipper &quot;Cinclus leucocephalus&quot;
*Rufous-throated dipper &quot;Cinclus schulzii&quot;

A 2002 molecular phylogenetic study of the dippers looked at the DNA sequences of two mitochondrial genes. It found that the Eurasian white-throated dipper and brown dipper are sister species as are the South American white-capped dipper and rufous-throated dipper. The study also showed that the dipper family, Cinclidae, is most closely related to the thrush family, Turdidae.

==Description==

Dippers are small, chunky, stout, short-tailed, short-winged, strong-legged birds. The different species are generally dark brown (sometimes nearly black), or brown and white in colour, apart from the rufous-throated dipper, which is brown with a reddish-brown throat patch. Sizes range from in length and in weight, with males larger than females. Their short wings give them a distinctive whirring flight. They have a characteristic bobbing motion when perched beside the water, giving them their name. While under water, they are covered by a thin, silvery film of air, due to small bubbles being trapped on the surface of the plumage.

==Distribution and habitat==
Dippers are found in suitable freshwater habitats in the highlands of the Americas, Europe and Asia. In Africa they are only found in the Atlas Mountains of Morocco. They inhabit the banks of fast-moving upland rivers with cold, clear waters, though, outside the breeding season, they may visit lake shores and sea coasts.

==Adaptations==
Unlike many water birds, dippers are generally similar in form to many terrestrial birds (for example, they do not have webbed feet), but they do have some morphological and physiological adaptations to their aquatic habits. They have evolved solid bones to reduce their buoyancy, and their wings are relatively short but strongly muscled, enabling them to be used as flippers underwater. The plumage is dense, with a large preen gland for waterproofing their feathers. Relatively long legs and sharp claws enable them to hold on to rocks in swift water. Their eyes have well-developed focus muscles that can change the curvature of the lens to enhance underwater vision. They have nasal flaps to prevent water entering their nostrils.

The high haemoglobin concentration in their blood gives them a capacity to store oxygen greater than that of other birds, allowing them to remain underwater for 30 seconds or more, whilst their basal metabolic rate is approximately one-third slower than typical terrestrial passerines of similar mass. One small population wintering at a hot spring in Suntar-Khayata Mountains of Siberia feeds underwater when air temperatures drop below .&lt;ref name=&quot;sh/&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

==Behaviour==

===Food===
Dippers forage for small animal prey in and along the margins of fast-flowing freshwater streams and rivers. They perch on rocks and feed at the edge of the water, but they often also grip the rocks firmly and walk down them beneath the water until partly or wholly submerged. They then search underwater for prey between and beneath stones and debris; they can also swim with their wings. The two South American species swim and dive less often than the three northern ones. Their prey consists primarily of invertebrates such as the nymphs or larvae of mayflies, blackflies, stoneflies and caddisflies, as well as small fish and fish eggs. Molluscs and crustaceans are also consumed, especially in winter when insect larvae are less available.

===Breeding===
Linear breeding territories are established by pairs of dippers along suitable rivers, and maintained against incursion by other dippers. Within their territory the pair must have a good nest site and roost sites, but the main factor affecting the length of the territory is the availability of sufficient food to feed themselves and their broods. Consequently, the length of a territory may vary from about to over .

Dipper nests are usually large, round, domed structures made of moss, with an internal cup of grass and rootlets, and a side entrance hole. They are often built in confined spaces over, or close to, running water. The site may be on a ledge or bank, in a crevice or drainpipe, or beneath a bridge. Tree sites are rare.

The usual clutch-size of the three northern dipper species is four or five; those of the South American species is not well known, though some evidence suggests that of the rufous-throated dipper is two. The incubation period of 16 or 17 days is followed by the hatching of altricial young which are brooded by the female alone for the next 12 to 13 days. The nestlings are fed by both parents and the whole fledging period is about 20–24 days. Young dippers usually become independent of their parents within a couple of weeks of leaving the nest. Dippers may raise second broods if conditions allow. The maximum recorded age from ring-recovery data of a white-throated dipper is 10 years and 7 months for a bird ringed in Finland. The maximum age for an American dipper is 8 years and 1 month for a bird ringed and recovered in South Dakota.

===Communication===
Dippers&#x27; calls are loud and high-pitched, being similar to calls made by other birds on fast rivers; the call frequencies lying within a narrow range of 4.0–6.5 kHz, well above the torrent noise frequency of maximum 2 kHz. Dippers also communicate visually by their characteristic dipping or bobbing movements, as well as by blinking rapidly to expose the white feathers on their upper eyelids as a series of white flashes in courtship and threat displays.

==Conservation==

Dippers are completely dependent on fast-flowing rivers with clear water, accessible food and secure nest-sites. They may be threatened by anything that affects these needs such as water pollution, acidification and turbidity caused by erosion. River regulation through the creation of dams and reservoirs, as well as channelization, can degrade and destroy dipper habitat.

Dippers are also sometimes hunted or otherwise persecuted by humans for various reasons. The Cyprus race of the white-throated dipper is extinct. In the Atlas Mountains dippers are claimed to have aphrodisiacal properties. In parts of Scotland and Germany, until the beginning of the 20th century, bounties were paid for killing dippers because of a misguided perception that they were detrimental to fish stocks through predation on the eggs and fry of salmonids.

Despite threats to local populations, the conservation status of most dipper species is considered to be of least concern. The one exception, the rufous-throated dipper, is classified as vulnerable because of its small, fragmented and declining population which is threatened, especially in Argentina, by changes in river management.

<text>The white-throated dipper (Cinclus cinclus), also known as the European dipper or just dipper, is an aquatic passerine bird found in Europe, Middle East, Central Asia and the Indian Subcontinent. The species is divided into several subspecies, based primarily on colour differences, particularly of the pectoral band.

==Taxonomy and systematics==
The white-throated dipper was described in 1758 by the Swedish naturalist Carl Linnaeus in the tenth edition of his &quot;Systema Naturae&quot; under the binomial name &quot;Sturnus cinclus&quot;. 
The current genus &quot;Cinclus&quot; was introduced by the German naturalist Moritz Balthasar Borkhausen in 1797. The name &quot;cinclus&quot; is from the Ancient Greek word that was used to describe small tail-wagging birds that resided near water. Of the five species now placed in the genus, a molecular genetic study has shown that the white-throated dipper is most closely related to the other Eurasian species, the brown dipper (&quot;Cinclus pallasii&quot;).

There are 14 subspecies of which one is now extinct (with †):
* &quot;C. c. hibernicus&quot; Hartert, 1910 – &quot;Irish dipper&quot; – Ireland and west Scotland
* &quot;C. c. gularis&quot; (Latham, 1801) – &quot;British dipper&quot; – Scotland (except west), north, central and west England and Wales
* &quot;C. c. cinclus&quot; (Linnaeus, 1758) – &quot;Northern white-throated dipper&quot; – north Europe, west and central France and north Spain and Portugal, Corsica and Sardinia
* &quot;C. c. aquaticus&quot; (Bechstein, 1797) – &quot;Central European dipper&quot; – central and south Europe
*† &quot;C. c. olympicus&quot; Madarász, 1903 – Cyprus
* &quot;C. c. minor&quot; Tristram, 1870 – northwest Africa
* &quot;C. c. rufiventris&quot; Tristram, 1885 – west Syria and Lebanon
* &quot;C. c. uralensis&quot; Serebrovski, 1927 – Ural Mountains
* &quot;C. c. caucasicus&quot; Madarász, 1903 – Turkey to the Caucasus, north Iran and north Iraq
* &quot;C. c. persicus&quot; Witherby, 1906 – southwest Iran
* &quot;C. c. leucogaster&quot; Bonaparte, 1850 – south-central Russia, northwest China south to Afghanistan and north Pakistan
* &quot;C. c. baicalensis&quot; Dresser, 1892 – south-central and southeast Siberia
* &quot;C. c. cashmeriensis&quot; Gould, 1860 – west and central Himalayas
* &quot;C. c. przewalskii&quot; Bianchi, 1905 – east Himalayas, south Tibet and west China

==Description==
The white-throated dipper is about long, rotund and short tailed. The head of the adult (&quot;gularis&quot; and &quot;aquaticus&quot;) is brown, the back slate-grey mottled with black, looking black from a distance, and the wings and tail are brown. The throat and upper breast are white, followed by a band of warm chestnut which merges into black on the belly and flanks. The bill is almost black, the legs and irides brown. &quot;C. c. cinclus&quot; has a black belly band. The young are greyish brown and have no chestnut band.

===Voice===
The male has a sweet wren-like song. During courtship the male sings whilst he runs and postures, exhibiting his snowy breast, and when displaying he will take long and high flights, like those of the common kingfisher, accompanied by sharp metallic calls &quot;clink, clink&quot;, different from the normal &quot;zil&quot;.

==Behaviour and ecology==

The white-throated dipper is closely associated with swiftly running rivers and streams or the lakes into which they fall. It often perches bobbing spasmodically with its short tail uplifted on the rocks round which the water swirls and tumbles.

It acquired its name from these sudden dips, not from its diving habit, though it dives as well as walks into the water.

It flies rapidly and straight, its short wings whirring swiftly and without pauses or glides, calling a shrill &quot;zil, zil, zil&quot;. It will then either drop on the water and dive or plunge in with a small splash.

From a perch it will walk into the water and deliberately submerge, but there is no truth in the assertion that it can defy the laws of specific gravity and walk along the bottom. Undoubtedly when entering the water it grips with its strong feet, but the method of progression beneath the surface is by swimming, using the wings effectively for flying under water. It holds itself down by muscular exertion, with its head well down and its body oblique, its course beneath the surface often revealed by a line of rising bubbles.

In this way it secures its food, usually aquatic invertebrates including caddis worms and other aquatic insect larvae, beetles, &quot;Limnaea&quot;, &quot;Ancylus&quot; and other freshwater molluscs, and also fish and small amphibians. A favourite food is the small crustacean &quot;Gammarus&quot;, an amphipod shrimp. It also walks and runs on the banks and rocks seeking terrestrial invertebrates. Dippers may be preyed on by predatory fish such as brown trout although only one case has been recorded for this species unlike in American dipper.

The winter habits of the dipper vary considerably and apparently individually. When the swift hill streams are frozen, it is forced to descend to the lowlands and even visit the coasts, but some will remain if there is any open water.

===Breeding===
The white-throated dippers first breed when they are one year old. They are monogamous and defend a territory. The nest is almost invariably built either very near or above water. It is often placed on a rocky ledge or in a cavity. Human-made structures such as bridges are also used. The nest consists of a dome-shaped structure made of moss, grass stems and leaves with a side entrance within which is an inner cup made of stems, rootlets and hair. Both sexes build the main larger structure, but the female builds the inner cup. The eggs are laid daily. The clutch can contain from 1-8 eggs but usually 4–5. The eggs are smooth and glossy white and are with a calculated weight of . They are incubated by the female beginning after the last or sometimes the penultimate egg has been laid. The male will bring food to the incubating female. The eggs hatch after around 16 days and then both parents feed the altricial and nidicolous nestlings. For the first 12–13 days they are brooded by the female. Both parents remove the faecal sacs for the first 9 days. The chicks fledge at around 22 days of age, but the parents continue to feed their young for another week but feeding can continue for 18 days. If the female has started a second clutch, then only the male parent feeds the fledglings. One or two broods are reared, usually in the same nest. When disturbed, the young that hardly feathered will at once drop into the water and dive.

The maximum recorded age of a white-throated dipper from ring-recovery data is 10 years and 7 months for a bird ringed in Finland. Within the United Kingdom and Ireland the maximum age is 8 years and 9 months for a bird ringed and recovered in County Laois, Ireland.

==Dippers and humans==
The first detailed description of the white-throated dipper, dating from c.1183, is that of Gerald of Wales (&quot;Giraldus Cambrensis)&quot;, the twelfth-century cleric, historian and traveller, in his book &quot;Topographia Hibernica&quot;, an account of his travels through Ireland in 1183–86. Gerald, a keen observer of wildlife, describes the dipper accurately, but with his notorious tendency to believe anything he was told, which so often detracts from the value of his work, states that it was an aberrant variety of the common kingfisher. The true kingfisher, according to Gerald, did not occur in Ireland in the 1180s, although it was widespread there by the eighteenth century. The white-throated dipper is Norway&#x27;s national bird.

<text>The white-capped dipper (Cinclus leucocephalus) is an aquatic passerine found in South America. It is a small black bird with white spots. It is found in the Andes from northern Bolivia, through Peru, Ecuador, Colombia to northwest Venezuela.

==Taxonomy==
The white-capped dipper was described by the Swiss naturalist Johann Jakob von Tschudi in 1844 and given the binomial name &quot;Cinclus leucocephalus&quot;. The type locality is the Junín Province in Peru. The specific epithet &quot;leucocephalus&quot; combines the Ancient Greek &quot;leukos&quot; &quot;white&quot; and &quot;-kephalos&quot; &quot;-headed&quot;. Of the five species now placed in the genus, a molecular genetic study has shown that the white-capped dipper is most closely related to the other South American species, the rufous-throated dipper (&quot;Cinclus schulzii&quot;).

There are three subspecies:
* &quot;C. l. rivularis&quot; Bangs, 1899 – north Colombia
* &quot;C. l. leuconotus&quot; Sclater, PL, 1858 – west Venezuela to Ecuador
* &quot;C. l. leucocephalus&quot; Tschudi, 1844 – Peru and Bolivia

==Description==
The white-capped dipper is in length and weighs . The sexes are similar in appearance, but the male is slightly larger than the female. The nominate subspecies has a white nape and crown with fine dark brown streaks. The remaining upperparts are dark brown. The throat is white; the remaining underparts are dark brown. The bill is black and the legs are dark grey. Subspecies &quot;rivularis&quot; is paler than the nominate and has fine grey spots on the throat. Subspecies &quot;leuconotus&quot; has a white belly and a large white patch on the upper back.

<text>The brown dipper (Cinclus pallasii), also known as Pallas&#x27;s dipper, Asian dipper or the Asiatic dipper, is an aquatic songbird found in the mountains of the east Palearctic. It is a thrush-like bird with a cocked tail. Its plumage is chocolate-brown with a slightly lighter coloured back and breast. At and , it is the largest of the dippers. This species, which is not often seen, is found at medium to low elevations where mountain streams flow.

==Taxonomy==
The brown dipper was described by the Dutch zoologist Coenraad Jacob Temminck in 1820 and given the binomial name &quot;Cinclus pallasii&quot;. The type locality is Eastern Siberia. The specific epithet &quot;pallasii&quot; was chosen in honour of the Prussian naturalist Peter Simon Pallas (1741–1811). Of the five species now placed in the genus, a molecular genetic study has shown that the brown dipper is most closely related to the other Eurasian species, the white-throated dipper (&quot;Cinclus cinclus&quot;).

There are three subspecies:
* &quot;C. p. tenuirostris&quot; Bonaparte, 1850 – north Afghanistan and the mountains of central Asia to central Himalayas
* &quot;C. p. dorjei&quot; Kinnear, 1937 – east Himalayas to Myanmar and northwest Thailand
* &quot;C. p. pallasii&quot; Temminck, 1820 – east Siberia to central China east to island of Sakhalin, Kuril Islands, Japan and Taiwan, south to south China, north Indochina

==Diet and feeding biology==
The brown dipper can either feed by diving into streams to eat larger benthic organisms, or wade in shallower parts of streams and pick smaller organisms of the bottom. The adults will dive for food from December through April, which is when there are more large benthic organisms. Since this period is also the breeding season of the brown dipper, more food is required, so diving for large food is necessary. However, the adults will forage by wading and picking at the stream bottom for the rest of the year. Brown dipper chicks and fledglings will also forage by diving. One small population wintering at a hot spring in Suntar-Khayata Mountains of Siberia feeds underwater when air temperatures drop below -55 C. Following typhoons, brown dippers in upland Taiwanese streams are displaced by flooding into relatively poorer quality streams that likely act as an important refuge.

<text>The rufous-throated dipper or Argentine dipper (Cinclus schulzii) is an aquatic songbird found in South America, and is part of the dipper family.

It lives along rapid rocky streams of the Southern Andean Yungas, in far southern Bolivia and northwestern Argentina at 800 metres to 2500 metres in elevation. The bird breeds in the alder zone at 1500 metres to 2500 metres in elevation.

BirdLife International have classified this species as &quot;Vulnerable&quot;. Threats included reservoir construction, hydroelectric dams, and irrigation schemes. The current population is estimated at 3,000 to 4,000.

==Taxonomy==
The rufous-throated dipper was described by the German ornithologist Jean Cabanis in 1882 and given the binomial name &quot;Cinclus schulzii&quot;. The type locality is the mountain of Cerro Bayo in northern Argentina. The specific epithet &quot;schulzii&quot; was chosen to honour the German zoologist Friedrich W. Schulz (1866-1933) who had collected the specimen. The species is monotypic. Of the five species now placed in the genus, a molecular genetic study has shown that the rufous-throated dipper is most closely related to the other South American species, the white-capped dipper (&quot;Cinclus leucocephalus&quot;).

<doc id="76835" wikidata="Q190353" url="?curid=76835" title="Sovereign Military Order of Malta">
<text>The Sovereign Military Order of Malta (SMOM), officially the Sovereign Military Hospitaller Order of Saint John of Jerusalem, of Rhodes and of Malta, and commonly known as the Order of Malta or the Knights of Malta, is a Catholic lay religious order, traditionally of a military, chivalric, and noble nature. Though it possesses no territory, the order is often considered a sovereign entity under international law.

The order claims continuity with the Knights Hospitaller, a chivalric order that was founded about 1099 by the Blessed Gerard in the Kingdom of Jerusalem. The order is led by an elected prince and grand master. Its motto is (&quot;Defence of the faith and assistance to the poor&quot;).

The government of the Sovereign Order of Malta has a similar structure to state governments. However, it also includes specific features associated with its nature as a lay religious order, as well as particular terminology evolved from nine centuries of history.

The Order&#x27;s membership includes about 13,500 Knights, Dames and Chaplains. Thirty-three of these are professed religious Knights of Justice. Until the 1990s, the highest classes of membership, including officers, required proof of noble lineage. More recently, a path was created for Knights and Dames of the lowest class (of whom proof of aristocratic lineage is not required) to be specially elevated to the highest class, making them eligible for office in the order.

The Order&#x27;s modern-day role is largely focused on providing humanitarian assistance and assisting with international humanitarian relations, for which purpose it has had permanent observer status at the United Nations General Assembly since 1994. The Order employs about 52,000 doctors, nurses, auxiliaries and paramedics assisted by 100,000 volunteers in more than 120 countries, assisting children, homeless, disabled, elderly, and terminally ill people, refugees, and lepers around the world without distinction of ethnicity or religion. Through its worldwide relief corps, Malteser International, the order aids victims of natural disasters, epidemics and war.

The Order maintains diplomatic relations with 114 states, enters into treaties, and issues its own passports, coins and postage stamps. Its two headquarters buildings in Rome enjoy extraterritoriality, and it maintains embassies in other countries. The three principal officers are counted as citizens. Although the Order has been a United Nations General Assembly observer since 1994, this was granted in view of its &quot;long-standing dedication [...] in providing humanitarian assistance and its special role in international humanitarian relations&quot;; the same category is held by other non-state entities such as the International Olympic Committee and International Committee of the Red Cross.

== Name and insignia ==

The Order of Malta comprises a large number of Priories, Sub-priories, and National Associations around the world, but there also exist various organizations with similar-sounding names that are unrelated to the Order. These include a number of mimic orders, such as masonic and non-Catholic organizations.

The Order has two flags: the State Flag is rectangular with a red background upon which there is a white Latin cross. The Flag of the Order&#x27;s works is rectangular with a red background upon which there is a white eight-pointed Maltese cross.

The Grand Master displays a rectangular flag with a red background upon which there is a white eight-pointed Maltese cross, encircled by the Collar of the Order and surmounted by a crown.

The coat of arms of the Order, gules a cross argent (a white/silver cross on a red field), is most often depicted on an oval shield surrounded by a rosary, all superimposed on a white eight-pointed cross over a princely mantle surmounted by a crown.

In ecclesiastical heraldry of the Catholic Church, the Order of Malta is one of only two orders (along with the Order of the Holy Sepulchre) whose insignia may be displayed in a clerical coat of arms (laypersons having no such restriction). The shield is surrounded with a silver rosary for Professed Knights, or for others the ribbon of their rank. Some members may also display the Maltese cross behind their shield instead of the ribbon.

To protect its heritage against fraud, the Order has legally registered sixteen versions of its names and emblems in some one hundred countries. 

The Sovereign Order of St. John of Jerusalem Knights Hospitaller is unrelated. The Sovereign Order of St. John of Jerusalem Knights Hospitaller descends from the ecumenical Order that was established by Russian Tsar Paul I. Just prior to the Russian Revolution, this order moved to the United States. Its Commanderies of Glasgow and London were formed in 2013.

== History of the Order of Saint John ==

=== Founding ===

The birth of the Knights Hospitaller dates back to around 1048. Merchants from the ancient Marine Republic of Amalfi obtained from the Caliph of Egypt the authorisation to build a church, convent, and hospital in Jerusalem, to care for pilgrims of any religious faith or race. The Order of St. John of Jerusalem – the monastic community that ran the hospital for the pilgrims in the Holy Land – became independent under the guidance of its founder, the religious brother Gerard.

With the Papal bull &quot;Pie postulatio voluntatis&quot; dated 15 February 1113, Pope Paschal II approved the foundation of the Hospital and placed it under the aegis of the Holy See, granting it the right to freely elect its superiors without interference from other secular or religious authorities. By virtue of the Papal Bull, the hospital became an order exempt from the control of the local church. All the Knights were religious, bound by the three monastic vows of poverty, chastity and obedience.

The constitution of the Christian Kingdom of Jerusalem during the Crusades obliged the order to take on the military defence of the sick, the pilgrims, and the captured territories. The order thus added the task of defending the faith to that of its hospitaller mission.

As time went on, the order adopted the white, eight-pointed Cross that is still its symbol today. The eight points represent the eight beatitudes that Jesus pronounced in his Sermon on the Mount.

=== Cyprus ===
When the last Christian stronghold in the Holy Land fell after the Siege of Acre in 1291, the order settled first in Cyprus.

===Rhodes===

In 1310, led by Grand Master Fra&#x27; Foulques de Villaret, the knights regrouped on the island of Rhodes. From there, the defense of the Christian world required the organization of a naval force, so the Order built a powerful fleet and sailed the eastern Mediterranean, fighting battles for the sake of Christendom, including Crusades in Syria and Egypt.

In the early 14th century, the institutions of the Order and the knights who came to Rhodes from every corner of Europe were grouped according to the languages they spoke. The first seven such groups, or &quot;Langues&quot; (Tongues) – from Provence, Auvergne, France, Italy, Aragon (Navarre), England (with Scotland and Ireland), and Germany – became eight in 1492, when Castile and Portugal were separated from the &quot;Langue&quot; of Aragon. Each &quot;Langue&quot; included Priories or Grand Priories, Bailiwicks, and Commanderies.

The Order was governed by its Grand Master, the Prince of Rhodes, and its Council. From its beginning, independence from other nations granted by pontifical charter and the universally recognized right to maintain and deploy armed forces constituted grounds for the international sovereignty of the Order, which minted its own coins and maintained diplomatic relations with other states. The senior positions of the Order were given to representatives of different &quot;Langues&quot;.

In 1523, after six months of siege and fierce combat against the fleet and army of Sultan Suleiman the Magnificent, the walls collapsed from undermining explosives, and by a negotiated surrender the Knights left Rhodes carrying their arms.

=== Malta ===


The Order remained without a territory of its own until 1530, when Grand Master Fra&#x27; Philippe de Villiers de l&#x27;Isle Adam took possession of the island of Malta, granted to the order by Emperor Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor and his mother Queen Joanna of Castile as monarchs of Sicily, with the approval of Pope Clement VII, for which the order had to honour the conditions of the Tribute of the Maltese Falcon.

In 1565, the Knights, led by Grand Master Fra&#x27; Jean de Valette (after whom the capital of Malta, Valletta, was named), defended the island for more than three months during the Great Siege by the Ottomans.

The fleet of the Order contributed to the ultimate destruction of the Ottoman naval power in the Battle of Lepanto in 1571, led by John of Austria, half brother of King Philip II of Spain.

The Reformation, which split Western Europe into Protestant and Catholic states, affected the knights as well. In several countries, including England, Scotland, and Sweden, the order dissolved. In others, including the Netherlands and Germany, entire bailiwicks or commanderies (administrative divisions of the order) experienced Protestant conversions; these &quot;Johanniter orders&quot; survive in Germany, the Netherlands, and Sweden and many other countries, including the United States and South Africa. It was established that the order should remain neutral in any war between Christian nations.

From 1651 to 1665, the Order ruled four islands in the Caribbean. On 21 May 1651 it acquired the islands of Saint Barthélemy, Saint Christopher, Saint Croix and Saint Martin. These were purchased from the French Compagnie des Îles de l&#x27;Amérique which had just been dissolved. In 1665, the four islands were sold to the French West India Company.

In 1798, Napoleon led the French occupation of Malta. Napoleon demanded from Grand Master Ferdinand von Hompesch zu Bolheim that his ships be allowed to enter the port and to take on water and supplies. The Grand Master replied that only two foreign ships could be allowed to enter the port at a time. Bonaparte, aware that such a procedure would take a long time and leave his forces vulnerable to British Admiral Horatio Nelson, immediately ordered a cannon fusillade against Malta. The French soldiers disembarked in Malta at seven points on the morning of 11 June and attacked. After several hours of fierce fighting, the Maltese in the west were forced to surrender.

Napoleon opened negotiations with the fortress capital of Valletta. Faced with vastly superior French forces and the loss of western Malta, the Grand Master negotiated a surrender to the invasion. Hompesch left Malta for Trieste on 18 June. He resigned as Grand Master on 6 July 1799.

The knights were dispersed, though the Order continued to exist in a diminished form and negotiated with European governments for a return to power as part of the agreement between France and Holy Roman Empire during the German mediatisation. The Russian Emperor, Paul I, gave the largest number of knights shelter in Saint Petersburg, an action that gave rise to the Russian tradition of the Knights Hospitaller and the Order&#x27;s recognition among the Russian Imperial Orders. The refugee knights in Saint Petersburg proceeded to elect Tsar Paul as their Grand Master – a rival to Grand Master von Hompesch until the latter&#x27;s abdication left Paul as the sole Grand Master. Grand Master Paul I created, in addition to the Catholic Grand Priory, a &quot;Russian Grand Priory&quot; of no fewer than 118 Commanderies, dwarfing the rest of the Order and open to all Christians. Paul&#x27;s election as Grand Master was, however, never ratified under Catholic canon law, and he was the &quot;de facto&quot; rather than &quot;de jure&quot; Grand Master of the Order.

By the early 19th century, the Order was severely weakened by the loss of its priories throughout Europe. Only 10% of the order&#x27;s income came from traditional sources in Europe, with the remaining 90% being generated by the Russian Grand Priory until 1810. This was partly reflected in the government of the Order being under Lieutenants, rather than Grand Masters, in the period 1805 to 1879, when Pope Leo XIII restored a Grand Master to the order. This signaled the renewal of the Order&#x27;s fortunes as a humanitarian and religious organization.

On 19 September 1806, the Swedish government offered the sovereignty of the island of Gotland to the Order. The offer was rejected since it would have meant the Order renouncing their claim to Malta.

===Exile===
The French forces occupying Malta expelled the Knights Hospitaller from the country.

During the seventeen years that separated the seizure of Malta and the General Peace, &quot;the formality of electing a brother Chief to discharge the office of Grand Master, and thus to preserve the vitality of the Sovereign Institute, was duty attended to&quot;. The office of Lieutenant of the Magistery and &quot;ad interim&quot; of Grand Master was held by the Grand Baillies Field Marshal Counto Soltikoff, Giovanni Tommasi, De Gaevera, Giovanni y Centelles, De Candida and the Count Colloredo. Their mandates complexively covered the period until the death of the Emperor Paul in 1801.

The Treaty of Amiens (1802) obliged the United Kingdom to evacuate Malta, which was to be restored to a recreated Order of St. John, whose sovereignty was to be guaranteed by all of the major European powers, to be determined at the final peace. However, this did not happen because of objections to the treaty that quickly grew in the United Kingdom.

Bonaparte&#x27;s rejection of a British offer involving a ten-year lease of Malta prompted the reactivation of the British blockade of the French coast; Britain declared war on France on 18 May.

The 1802 treaty was never implemented. The United Kingdom resumed hostilities citing France&#x27;s imperialist policies in the West Indies, Italy, and Switzerland.

===Sovereign Military Order of Malta===
The Congress of Vienna of 1815 confirmed the loss of Malta. After having temporarily resided in Messina, Catania and Ferrara, the seat of the order was moved to Ferrara in 1826 and to Rome in 1834. The Magistral Palace in Via Condotti 68 and the Magistral Villa on the Aventine Hill enjoy extraterritorial status. The grand priories of Lombardy-Venetia and of Sicily were restored from 1839 to 1841. The office of Grand Master was restored by Pope Leo XIII in 1879, after a vacancy of 75 years, confirming Giovanni Battista Ceschi a Santa Croce as the first Grand Master of the restored Order of Malta. However, the loss of possession of Malta during this period did not affect the right of active and passive legation for the Order, which is legally important for the absolute continuity of international status, regardless of the former territorial possession.

The original hospitaller mission became the main activity of the order, growing ever stronger during the 20th century, most especially because of the contribution of the activities carried out by the Grand Priories and National Associations in many countries around the world. Large-scale hospitaller and charitable activities were carried out during World Wars I and II under Grand Master Fra&#x27; Ludovico Chigi Albani della Rovere (1931–1951). Under the Grand Masters Fra&#x27; Angelo de Mojana di Cologna (1962–88) and Fra&#x27; Andrew Bertie (1988–2008), the projects expanded.

In February 2013, the Order celebrated the 900th anniversary of its papal recognition with a general audience with Pope Benedict XVI and a Mass celebrated by Cardinal Tarcisio Bertone in Saint Peter&#x27;s Basilica.
The order has 95,000 volunteers.

=== Constitutional reform ===
The Order experienced a leadership crisis beginning in December 2016, when Albrecht Freiherr von Boeselager protested his removal as Grand Chancellor by Grand Master Fra&#x27; Matthew Festing. Von Boeselager was removed after condoms were found to have been distributed by other aid groups in Myanmar as part of a joint charitable project with the order’s Malteser International to help sex slaves protect themselves from AIDS. In January 2017, Pope Francis ordered von Boeselager reinstated and required Festing&#x27;s resignation. Francis also named Archbishop (later Cardinal) Giovanni Becciu as his personal representative to the Order – sidelining the Order&#x27;s Cardinal Patron Raymond Burke – until the election of a new Grand Master. The pope effectively taking control over the Order was seen by some as a break with tradition and the Order&#x27;s independence.

In May 2017, the Order named Mauro Bertero Gutiérrez, a Bolivian member of the Government Council, to lead its constitutional reform process. In June 2017, in a departure from tradition, the leadership of the Order wore informal attire rather than formal wear full dress uniforms to their annual papal audience. In May 2018 when a new Grand Master was elected, Francis extended Becciu&#x27;s mandate indefinitely. When the Order&#x27;s Chapter General met in May 2019 three of the 62 participants were women for the first time.

On 1 November 2020, Pope Francis named Archbishop (later Cardinal) Silvano Tomasi to replace Becciu as his Special Delegate to the Order, reiterating the responsibilities of that office as his sole representative.

On 3 September 2022, Pope Francis promulgated the new constitution of the Order and made provisional appointments to the Sovereign Council; he scheduled a convocation of the Extraordinary General Chapter for 25 January 2023, when regular appointments can be made in place of his provisional ones. On 26 January, the General Chapter elected to six-year terms on the Sovereign Council the same four members Francis had appointed the previous September and six of the nine Councillors he had named.

On 19 June 2023, Pope Francis named Cardinal Gianfranco Ghirlanda to succeed Burke as patron.

==Organisation==
===Governance===

The proceedings of the Order are governed by its Constitutional Charter and Code.

The Prince and Grand Master is the head of the order and governs both as sovereign and as religious superior. He is &quot;entitled to sovereign prerogatives and honors as well as the title of &quot;Most Eminent Highness&quot;. He is elected to a term of ten years and may be elected to a second term, but may not serve beyond the completion of his 85th year. The Prince and Grand Master is Fra&#x27; John T. Dunlap who was elected on 3 May 2023. &quot;In the event of permanent impediment, resignation or death of the Grand Master, the Order is governed by a Lieutenant &quot;ad interim&quot; in the person of the Grand Commander, who can only perform acts of ordinary administration without making any innovations.&quot; If it is not possible to elect a Grand Master, a Lieutenant of the Grand Master is elected, who has the same powers as the Grand Master with the exception of the prerogatives of honour pertaining to a sovereign. Both the Lieutenant &quot;ad interim&quot; and the Lieutenant of the Grand Master are styled &quot;Eccellenza&quot; (Excellency).

The Sovereign Council is the primary governing body of the Order that handles regular business. The members are the Grand Master (or Lieutenant), the holders of the four High Officers (the Grand Commander, the Grand Chancellor, the Grand Hospitaller and the Receiver of the Common Treasure), the five Councilors of the Council of the Professed Knights, and four Councilors.

The Council of the Professed Knights &quot;assists the Grand Master in the spiritual care of the Order and in the governance of the First and Second Class&quot;. It includes the Grand Master (or Lieutenant), the Grand Commander, and five Councilors elected by the Chapter of the Professed.

The Chapter General is the legislative body of the Order, which meets every six years. It elects the members of the Sovereign Council.

The Council Complete of State elects the Grand Master or the Lieutenant of the Grand Master.

The Board of Auditors audits the Order&#x27;s finances. It includes a President elected among the seven Councillors, all elected by the Chapter General.

The Government Council is the advisory board to the Sovereign Council in charge of studying political, religious, humanitarian assistance and international issues.

The Order&#x27;s judicial powers are exercised by a group of Magistral Courts, whose judges are appointed by the Grand Master and the Sovereign Council.

===Regional divisions===

The order is divided regionally into six Grand Priories, six Sub-Priories and 48 associations.

The six Grand Priories are:
* Grand Priory of Rome (founded 1214; expropriated 1808; restored 1816)
* Grand Priory of Lombardy and Venice (founded as two priories about 1180; expropriated 1796–1806; restored as a single priory 1839)
* Grand Priory of Naples and Sicily (founded as the Priory of Messina, the Priory of Barletta, and the Priory of Capua in the 12th and 13th centuries; suppressed 1806–1826; restored as a single priory 1839)
* Grand Priory of Bohemia (founded 1182)
* Grand Priory of Austria (separated from the Grand Priory of Bohemia 1938)
* Grand Priory of England (re-established 1993)

The six Sub-Priories are:
* Sub-Priory of St. Michael (Cologne, Germany)
* Sub-Priory of St. George and St. James (Madrid, Spain)
* Sub-Priory of Our Lady of Philermo (San Francisco, United States)
* Sub-Priory of Our Lady of Lourdes (New York, United States)
* Sub-Priory of The Immaculate Conception (Melbourne, Australia)
* Sub-Priory of St. Oliver Plunkett (Ireland)

=== National Associations of countries not mentioned above ===
Most of the 48 associations are national, but several countries (Brazil, Germany, the United States) have more than one association.

Until the beginning of the nineteenth century the Order was divided regionally into Langues.
=== Membership ===
Membership in the Order is divided into three classes each of which is subdivided into several categories:

* First Class, who make religious vows of poverty, chastity, and obedience:
** Knights of Justice or Professed Knights
** Professed Conventual Chaplains
: There are currently (2023) 33 Knights of Justice and six Professed Conventual Chaplains.

* Second Class: Knights and Dames in Obedience make a Promise of Obedience:
** Knights and Dames of Honour and Devotion in Obedience
** Knights and Dames of Grace and Devotion in Obedience
** Knights and Dames of Magistral Grace in Obedience
: There are currently (2023) 541 Knights in Obedience and 137 Dames in Obedience.

* Third Class, who make no vows or promises, but live according to the principles of the Church and the Order:
** Knights and Dames of Honour and Devotion
** Conventual Chaplains ad honorem
** Knights and Dames of Grace and Devotion
** Magistral Chaplains
** Knights and Dames of Magistral Grace
** Donats (male and female) of Devotion

: There are currently (2023) 12,395 members of the Third Class.

Within each class and category of knights there are ranks of Knight, Knight Grand Cross, and Bailiff Knight Grand Cross.

Bishops and priests are generally admitted as chaplains of the Order of Malta. There are some priests who are knights of the order, usually because they were admitted to the order prior to ordination. The priests of the Order of Malta are ranked as Honorary Canons, as in the Order of the Holy Sepulchre; and they are entitled to wear the black mozetta with purple piping and purple fascia.

Prior to the 1990s, all officers of the order had to be of noble birth (defined differently in different countries), as they were all Knights of Justice or Knights in Obedience. However, Knights of Magistral Grace (i.e. those who do not have proof of noble birth) now may make the Promise of Obedience and, at the discretion of the Grand Master and Sovereign Council, may enter the novitiate to become professed Knights of Justice.

===Religious officers===
==== Cardinal Patron ====
The &quot;Cardinalis Patronus&quot; (Cardinal Patron), who is either a cardinal when appointed by the pope or soon raised to that rank, promotes the spiritual interests of the order and its members, and its relations with the Holy See.

* Paolo Giobbe (8 August 1961 – 3 July 1969)
* Giacomo Violardo (3 July 1969 – 17 March 1978)
* Paul-Pierre Philippe, O.P. (10 November 1978 – 9 April 1984)
* Sebastiano Baggio (26 May 1984 – 21 March 1993)
* Pio Laghi (8 May 1993 – 11 January 2009)
* Paolo Sardi (6 June 2009 – 8 November 2014)
* Raymond Burke (8 November 2014–19 June 2023)
* Gianfranco Ghirlanda (19 June 2023-present)

====Special delegate====
Since 2017, Pope Francis has appointed special delegates to fulfill the role that was previously assigned to the patron.

On 2 February 2017 Pope Francis appointed Archbishop Giovanni Angelo Becciu as his special delegate to the order.

After Becciu resigned from the rights and privileges of a cardinal after being implicated in a financial corruption scandal, in October 2020, Pope Francis appointed Archbishop Silvano Tomasi as his special delegate to the order on 1 November 2020.

====Prelate====
The Prelate of the order is responsible for the clergy of the order and assists the Grand Master, the Grand Commander and the Coordinator of the Second Class in the care of the spiritual life and in the religious observance of all members of the order. He is appointed by the pope on the advice of the cardinal patron.

On 4 July 2015 Pope Francis named Bishop Jean Laffitte prelate. Laffitte succeeded Archbishop Angelo Acerbi, who had held the office since 2001. Since 21 December 2023 the prelate has been Msgr. Luis Manuel Cuña Ramos, a native of Spain who has spent the most of his life in Rome as a consultant and professor of church history as the Pontifical Urban University and the Pontifical Gregorian University.

=== Relationship with other mutually-recognised Orders of Saint John ===
The Sovereign Military Order of Malta has collaborated with other mutually-recognized Orders of Saint John; for example, the SMOM is a major donor of the St John Eye Hospital in Jerusalem, which is primarily operated by the Most Venerable Order of Saint John.

==Nuns of the Order==
There are three enclosed monasteries of nuns of the Order, two in Spain that date from the 11/12th centuries and one in Malta. The existence of the nuns is not mentioned in the Constitutional Charter or the Code of the Order.

== International status ==
 


The Order &quot;as a subject of international law, exercises sovereign functions with regard to [its] purposes&quot;, namely &quot;promoting the glory of God and the sanctification of its members&quot; and performing works of mercy &quot;towards the sick, the needy, and people without a country without distinction of religion, race, sex, origin and age&quot;.

The Order has formal diplomatic relations with 114 states (including the Holy See) and has official relations with another five states and with the European Union. The Order maintains diplomatic missions around the world and many of the states reciprocate by accrediting ambassadors to the Order (usually their ambassador to the Holy See). During the reign of Fra&#x27; Andrew Bertie as Prince and Grand Master (1988–2008), the number of nations extending diplomatic relations to the Order more than doubled from 49 to 100.

The Order has permanent observer status at the General Assembly of the United Nations and some of the specialized agencies of the United Nations. One such example is the UN Central Emergency Response Fund, to which it contributed USD $36,000 from 2006–2022. The Order is not classified as a &quot;non-member state&quot; nor as an &quot;intergovernmental organization&quot;, but rather as one of the &quot;other entities having received a standing invitation to participate as observers.&quot;

The Order has relations with the European Union, the International Committee of the Red Cross, and a number of international organizations. While the International Telecommunication Union has granted radio identification prefixes to the United Nations and the Palestinian Authority, the Order has never received one. For awards purposes, amateur radio operators consider the Order a separate &quot;entity&quot;—but stations transmitting from there use an unofficial callsign, starting with the prefix &quot;1A&quot;. The Order has neither sought nor been granted a top-level domain for the Internet or an international dialing code for telephone purposes.

The Order&#x27;s international nature is useful in enabling it to pursue its humanitarian activities without being seen as an operative of any particular nation. Its sovereignty is also expressed in the issuance of passports, licence plates, stamps, and coins.

===Scholarly debate===

With its unique history and unusual present circumstances, the exact status of the Order in international law has been the subject of debate. Some scholars have questioned the Order&#x27;s sovereignty based on the fact that the Order has very limited geographical territories and on account of the Order&#x27;s relationship with the Holy See. The connection between the Holy See and the Order of Malta was seen as so close as to call into question the actual sovereignty of the order as a separate entity. This has prompted constitutional changes on the part of the Order, which were implemented in 1997. Since then, the Order has been widely recognized as a sovereign subject of international law in its own right.

Some legal experts claim that the Order&#x27;s claim to sovereignty cannot be maintained. Even taking into account the Order&#x27;s ambassadorial diplomatic status among many nations, some scholars reject the country&#x27;s sovereign status. Wilhelm Wengler rejects the notion that recognition of the Order by some states (for example, the Republic of San Marino&#x27;s 1935 recognition of SMOM as a sovereign state in its own right) makes it a subject of international law. Ian Brownlie writes that, &quot;Even in the sphere of recognition and bilateral relations, the legal capacities of institutions like the Sovereign Order of Jerusalem and Malta must be limited simply because they lack the territorial and demographic characteristics of states.&quot; Helmut Steinberger states that, &quot;With the historical exception of the Holy See, which maintains diplomatic relations with more than 100 States, in contemporary international law only States as distinguished from international organizations or other subjects of international law are accorded sovereignty.&quot;

Other legal experts argue in favour of the Order&#x27;s claim to sovereignty. Georg Dahm affirms that the Order is a &quot;subject of international law without territory&quot;. Berthold Waldstein-Wartenberg writes that the sovereignty of the Order and its personality in international law is &quot;generally recognized by international law doctrine&quot;. Gerhard von Glahn affirms that &quot;the Order can be classified as a nonstate subject of international law, although of a somewhat peculiar nature.&quot; Rebecca Wallace explains that a sovereign entity does not have to be a country, and that the Order is an example of this.

===Relations with the Holy See===

On 24 January 1953, the Tribunal of Cardinals appointed by Pope Pius XII stated that, &quot;The quality of the sovereign Order of the institution is functional, that is, aimed at ensuring the achievement of the purposes of the Order itself and its development in the world.&quot; The Tribunal of Cardinals further stated that, &quot;The status of sovereign Order...consists in the enjoyment of certain prerogatives inherent to the Order itself as a Subject of international law. These prerogatives, which are proper to sovereigntyin accordance with the principles of international lawand which, following the example of the Holy See, have also been recognized by some States, do not however constitute in the Order that complex of powers and prerogatives, which it belongs to sovereign bodies in the full sense of the word.&quot;

On 24 June 1961, Pope John XXIII approved the Constitutional Charter of the Order, which stated that &quot;the Order is a legal entity formally approved by the Holy See. It has the quality of a subject of international law&quot; (Article 1) and that &quot;the intimate connection existing between the two qualities of a religious order and a sovereign order do not oppose the autonomy of the order in the exercise of its sovereignty and prerogatives inherent to it as a subject of international law in relation to States.&quot; (Article 3)

===Relations with Italy===

The Order has signed treaties with Italy dated 20 February 1884, 23 December 1915, 4 January 1938, and 1956.

The Supreme Court of Cassation decreed on 6 June 1974 that, &quot;the Sovereign Military Hospitaller Order of Malta constitutes a sovereign international subject, in all terms equal, even if without territory, to a foreign state with which Italy has normal diplomatic relations, so there is no doubt, as already this Supreme Court has warned, that it has the legal treatment of foreign states&quot;.

The two most important properties of the Order in Rome – the Palazzo Malta in Via dei Condotti 68, where the Grand Master resides and Government Bodies meet, and the Villa del Priorato di Malta on the Aventine Hill, which hosts the Grand Priory of Rome – as well as the Embassy of the Order to Holy See and the Embassy of the Order to Italy are all recognised as extraterritorial by Italy. As Italy recognizes, in addition to extraterritoriality, the exercise by SMOM of all the prerogatives of sovereignty in its headquarters, Italian sovereignty and SMOM sovereignty uniquely coexist without overlapping.

By a decree of King Victor Emmanuel III of Italy of 28 November 1929, &quot;The Grand Master of the Sovereign Military Order of Malta enjoys in Italy the honors due to the Cardinals, and takes place after them.&quot; Further, &quot;The representation of the Grand Magistry of the Sovereign Military Order of Malta . . . immediately follows the representations of the Foreign Diplomatic Corps.&quot; Finally, the decree affirms that the Bailiffs Knights Grand Cross of Justice in Italy shall be styled &quot;Excellency&quot; ().

The Order is one of the largest landowners in Italy; its properties are exempted from certain Italian fiscal jurisdiction.

Diplomatic vehicles of the Order in Italy receive diplomatic license plates with the code &quot;XA&quot;. Other vehicles of the Order receive Italian license plates with the prefix SMOM.

=== Relations with the Republic of Malta ===
Two bilateral treaties have been concluded between the Order and the Republic of Malta. The first treaty, dated 21 June 1991, is now no longer in force. The second treaty was signed on 5 December 1998 and ratified on 1 November 2001.

This agreement grants the Order the use with limited extraterritoriality of the upper portion of Fort St. Angelo in the city of Birgu. Its stated purpose is &quot;to give the Order the opportunity to be better enabled to carry out its humanitarian activities as Knights Hospitallers from Saint Angelo, as well as to better define the legal status of Saint Angelo subject to the sovereignty of Malta over it&quot;.

The agreement has a duration of 99 years, but the document allows the Government of Malta to terminate it at any time after 50 years. Under the terms of the agreement, the flag of Malta is to be flown together with the flag of the Order in a prominent position over Fort St. Angelo. No asylum may be granted by the Order and generally the Maltese courts have full jurisdiction and Maltese law shall apply. The second bilateral treaty mentions a number of immunities and privileges, none of which appeared in the earlier treaty.

===Currency and postage stamps===
The Order&#x27;s coins are appreciated more as collector&#x27;s items than for use as currency.

Some 58 countries recognize the Order&#x27;s postage stamps for franking purposes, including several such as Canada and Mongolia that lack full diplomatic relations with the Order. In 2005, Poste italiane, the Italian postal service, agreed with the Order to deliver internationally most classes of mail other than registered, insured, and special-delivery mail. The Order began issuing euro-denominated postage stamps in 2005, although the scudo remains the official currency of the Order.

==Military Corps==

The Order states that it was the hospitaller role that enabled the Order to survive the end of the crusading era; nonetheless, it retains its military title and traditions.

On 26 March 1876, the Association of the Italian Knights of the Sovereign Military Order of Malta (, ACISMOM) reformed the Order&#x27;s military to a modern military unit of the era. This unit provided medical support to the Italian Army and on 9 April 1909 the military corps officially became a special auxiliary volunteer corps of the Italian Army under the name (Army Military Corps of the ACISMOM), wearing Italian uniforms. Since then the Military Corps have operated with the Italian Army both in wartime and peacetime in medical or paramedical military functions, and in ceremonial functions for the Order, such as standing guard around the coffins of high officers of the Order before and during funeral rites.

===Air force===
In 1947, after the post-World War II peace treaty forbade Italy to own or operate bomber aircraft and only operate a limited number of transport aircraft, the Italian Air Force opted to transfer some of its Savoia-Marchetti SM.82 aircraft to the Sovereign Military Order of Malta, pending the definition of their exact status (the SM.82 were properly long range transport aircraft that could be adapted for bombing missions). These aircraft were operated by Italian Air Force personnel temporarily flying for the Order, carried the Order&#x27;s roundels on the fuselage and Italian ones on the wings, and were used mainly for standard Italian Air Force training and transport missions but also for some humanitarian tasks proper of the Order of Malta (like the transport of sick pilgrims to the Lourdes sanctuary). In the early 1950s, when the strictures of the peace treaty had been much relaxed by the Allied authorities, the aircraft returned under full control of the Italian Air Force. One of the aircraft transferred to the Order of Malta, still with the Order&#x27;s fuselage roundels, is preserved in the Italian Air Force Museum.

===Logistics===
The Military Corps has become known in mainland Europe for its operation of hospital trains, a service carried out intensively during both World Wars. The Military Corps still operates a modern 28-car hospital train with 192 hospital beds, serviced by a medical staff of 38 medics and paramedics provided by the Order and a technical staff provided by the Italian Army&#x27;s Ferrovieri Engineer Regiment.

== Current activity ==
The Sovereign Military Order of Malta has major cooperation with Alliance of the Orders of Saint John of Jerusalem. They monitor breaches having set up a &quot;Unrecognised Orders Monitoring Group&quot;.
In Germany, in daughter societies of both organisations there was alleged, that there was not much concern about racism by staff in the early 2020s.
&quot;Malteser Auslandsdienst&quot; (&quot;Malteser Foreign Service&quot;) is an organisation from Germany active in several European countries as well as South Africa, Chile and Russia.
 Malteser Aid Service was founded by the order and the German Caritas Association in Germany in 1953.
 Malteser International has more than 140 projects in 35 countries in Africa, Asia and the Americas. Malteser International is a division of Malteser Hilfsdienst e.V. and based in Cologne, Germany. 
 Malteser International Americas is based in New York, USA.
It provides emergency aid. It is active in Venezuela, Colombia, Haiti, but also Ukraine, Iraq, Lebanon, Syria, Kenya, South Sudan, the Democratic Republic of Congo and Myanmar, inter alia. 

In 2023, more than half its income was from the Government of Germany. The current membership of Malteser International consists of 27 National Associations and Priories of the Order of Malta. 
Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry (South Sudan), 
Ministry of Animal Resources and Fisheries, (South Sudan), 
Ministry of Education and Instruction, (South Sudan), 
Ministry of Health (Nigeria), 
Ministry of Health (Uganda), 
Ministry of Water Resources and Irrigation (South Sudan) and 
Ministry of Women Affairs (Nigeria) are among the partners of Malteser International. 
The German Federal Foreign Office has started a campaign on forgotten crises, with other organisation including Save the Children, CARE and SOS Children&#x27;s Villages.
In 1961, the Order of Saint John played a major role in Britain and the Commonwealth.

<text>The Academy Award for Best Film Editing is one of the annual awards of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences (AMPAS). Nominations for this award are closely correlated with the Academy Award for Best Picture. For 33 consecutive years, 1981 to 2013, every Best Picture winner had also been nominated for the Film Editing Oscar, and about two thirds of the Best Picture winners have also won for Film Editing. Only the principal, &quot;above the line&quot; editor(s) as listed in the film&#x27;s credits are named on the award; additional editors, supervising editors, etc. are not currently eligible.

The nominations for this Academy Award are determined by a ballot of the voting members of the Editing Branch of the academy; there were 220 members of the Editing Branch in 2012. The members may vote for up to five of the eligible films in the order of their preference; the five films with the largest vote totals are selected as nominees. The Academy Award itself is selected from the nominated films by a subsequent ballot of all active and life members of the academy. This process is essentially the reverse of that of the British Academy of Film and Television Arts (BAFTA); nominations for the BAFTA Award for Best Editing are done by a general ballot of academy voters, and the winner is selected by members of the editing chapter.

==History==
This award was first given for films released in 1934. The name of this award is occasionally changed; in 2008, it was listed as the Academy Award for Achievement in Film Editing.

Four film editors have won this award three times in their career:

* Ralph Dawson won for &quot;A Midsummer Night&#x27;s Dream&quot; (1935), &quot;Anthony Adverse&quot; (1936), and &quot;The Adventures of Robin Hood&quot; (1938)
* Daniel Mandell won for &quot;The Pride of the Yankees&quot; (1942), &quot;The Best Years of Our Lives&quot; (1946), and &quot;The Apartment&quot; (1960).
* Michael Kahn won for &quot;Raiders of the Lost Ark&quot; (1981), &quot;Schindler&#x27;s List&quot; (1993), and &quot;Saving Private Ryan&quot; (1998).
* Thelma Schoonmaker won for &quot;Raging Bull&quot; (1980), &quot;The Aviator&quot; (2004), and &quot;The Departed&quot; (2006).

To date, two film directors have won this award: James Cameron and Alfonso Cuarón, for the films &quot;Titanic&quot; and &quot;Gravity&quot;, respectively. Directors David Lean, Steve James, Joel Coen and Ethan Coen (under the alias &quot;Roderick Jaynes&quot;), Michel Hazanavicius, Jean-Marc Vallée (under the alias &quot;John Mac McMurphy&quot;), Chloé Zhao and Sean Baker have been nominated for editing their own films as well, with Cameron, Cuarón, and the Coens each being nominated for the award twice. Also, Best Film Editing winner, Walter Murch, although known for film editing and sound, directed the Oscar nominated &quot;Return to Oz&quot;, and is, to date, the only person with Oscars for both sound engineering and film editing—winning them in the same year for his work on &quot;The English Patient&quot;.

Additionally, former film editors Robert Wise (nominee for &quot;Citizen Kane&quot;), Hal Ashby (winner for &quot;In the Heat of the Night&quot;), and Francis D. Lyon (co-winner for &quot;Body and Soul&quot;) became directors whose films were subsequently nominated for Best Film Editing themselves. These films include &quot;Somebody Up There Likes Me&quot;, &quot;I Want to Live!&quot;, &quot;West Side Story&quot;, &quot;The Sound of Music&quot;, &quot;The Sand Pebbles&quot;, and &quot;The Andromeda Strain&quot; for Wise; &quot;Bound for Glory&quot; and &quot;Coming Home&quot; for Ashby; and &quot;Crazylegs&quot; for Lyon.

<doc id="76848" wikidata="Q184743" url="?curid=76848" title="Periodic function">
<text>A periodic function, also called a periodic waveform (or simply periodic wave), is a function that repeats its values at regular intervals or periods. The repeatable part of the function or waveform is called a cycle. For example, the trigonometric functions, which repeat at intervals of formula_1 radians, are periodic functions. Periodic functions are used throughout science to describe oscillations, waves, and other phenomena that exhibit periodicity. Any function that is not periodic is called aperiodic.

==Definition==
A function is said to be periodic if, for some nonzero constant , it is the case that

:formula_2

for all values of in the domain. A nonzero constant for which this is the case is called a period of the function. If there exists a least positive constant with this property, it is called the fundamental period (also primitive period, basic period, or prime period.) Often, &quot;the&quot; period of a function is used to mean its fundamental period. A function with period will repeat on intervals of length , and these intervals are sometimes also referred to as periods of the function.

Geometrically, a periodic function can be defined as a function whose graph exhibits translational symmetry, i.e. a function is periodic with period if the graph of is invariant under translation in the -direction by a distance of . This definition of periodicity can be extended to other geometric shapes and patterns, as well as be generalized to higher dimensions, such as periodic tessellations of the plane. A sequence can also be viewed as a function defined on the natural numbers, and for a periodic sequence these notions are defined accordingly.

==Examples==
===Real number examples===
The sine function is periodic with period formula_1, since

:formula_4

for all values of formula_5. This function repeats on intervals of length formula_1 (see the graph to the right).

Everyday examples are seen when the variable is &quot;time&quot;; for instance the hands of a clock or the phases of the moon show periodic behaviour. Periodic motion is motion in which the position(s) of the system are expressible as periodic functions, all with the &quot;same&quot; period.

For a function on the real numbers or on the integers, that means that the entire graph can be formed from copies of one particular portion, repeated at regular intervals.

A simple example of a periodic function is the function formula_7 that gives the &quot;fractional part&quot; of its argument. Its period is 1. In particular,

: formula_8

The graph of the function formula_7 is the sawtooth wave.
The trigonometric functions sine and cosine are common periodic functions, with period formula_1 (see the figure on the right). The subject of Fourier series investigates the idea that an &#x27;arbitrary&#x27; periodic function is a sum of trigonometric functions with matching periods.

According to the definition above, some exotic functions, for example the Dirichlet function, are also periodic; in the case of Dirichlet function, any nonzero rational number is a period.

===Complex number examples===
Using complex variables we have the common period function:

:formula_11

Since the cosine and sine functions are both periodic with period formula_1, the complex exponential is made up of cosine and sine waves. This means that Euler&#x27;s formula (above) has the property such that if formula_13 is the period of the function, then

:formula_14

====Double-periodic functions====
A function whose domain is the complex numbers can have two incommensurate periods without being constant. The elliptic functions are such functions. (&quot;Incommensurate&quot; in this context means not real multiples of each other.)

==Properties==

Periodic functions can take on values many times. More specifically, if a function formula_7 is periodic with period formula_16, then for all formula_5 in the domain of formula_7 and all positive integers formula_19,

: formula_20

If formula_21 is a function with period formula_16, then formula_23, where formula_24 is a non-zero real number such that formula_25 is within the domain of formula_7, is periodic with period formula_27. For example, formula_28 has period formula_29 and, therefore, formula_30 will have period formula_31.

Some periodic functions can be described by Fourier series. For instance, for &quot;L&quot;2 functions, Carleson&#x27;s theorem states that they have a pointwise (Lebesgue) almost everywhere convergent Fourier series. Fourier series can only be used for periodic functions, or for functions on a bounded (compact) interval. If formula_7 is a periodic function with period formula_16 that can be described by a Fourier series, the coefficients of the series can be described by an integral over an interval of length formula_16.

Any function that consists only of periodic functions with the same period is also periodic (with period equal or smaller), including:
* addition, subtraction, multiplication and division of periodic functions, and
* taking a power or a root of a periodic function (provided it is defined for all formula_5).

==Generalizations==

===Antiperiodic functions===
One subset of periodic functions is that of antiperiodic functions. This is a function formula_7 such that formula_37 for all formula_38. For example, the sine and cosine functions are formula_39-antiperiodic and formula_1-periodic. While a formula_41-antiperiodic function is a formula_42-periodic function, the converse is not necessarily true.

===Bloch-periodic functions===
A further generalization appears in the context of Bloch&#x27;s theorems and Floquet theory, which govern the solution of various periodic differential equations. In this context, the solution (in one dimension) is typically a function of the form
:formula_43
where formula_44 is a real or complex number (the &quot;Bloch wavevector&quot; or &quot;Floquet exponent&quot;). Functions of this form are sometimes called Bloch-periodic in this context. A periodic function is the special case formula_45, and an antiperiodic function is the special case formula_46. Whenever formula_47 is rational, the function is also periodic.

===Quotient spaces as domain===
In signal processing you encounter the problem, that Fourier series represent periodic functions and that Fourier series satisfy convolution theorems (i.e. convolution of Fourier series corresponds to multiplication of represented periodic function and vice versa), but periodic functions cannot be convolved with the usual definition, since the involved integrals diverge. A possible way out is to define a periodic function on a bounded but periodic domain. To this end you can use the notion of a quotient space:

:formula_48.

That is, each element in formula_49 is an equivalence class of real numbers that share the same fractional part. Thus a function like formula_50 is a representation of a 1-periodic function.

==Calculating period==
Consider a real waveform consisting of superimposed frequencies, expressed in a set as ratios to a fundamental frequency, f: F = [f f f ... f] where all non-zero elements ≥1 and at least one of the elements of the set is 1. To find the period, T, first find the least common denominator of all the elements in the set. Period can be found as T = . Consider that for a simple sinusoid, T = . Therefore, the LCD can be seen as a periodicity multiplier.

* For set representing all notes of Western major scale: [1 ] the LCD is 24 therefore T = .
* For set representing all notes of a major triad: [1 ] the LCD is 4 therefore T = .
* For set representing all notes of a minor triad: [1 ] the LCD is 10 therefore T = .

If no least common denominator exists, for instance if one of the above elements were irrational, then the wave would not be periodic.

<text>Julius Peter Christian Petersen (16 June 1839, Sorø, West Zealand – 5 August 1910, Copenhagen) was a Danish mathematician. His contributions to the field of mathematics led to the birth of graph theory.

==Biography==
Petersen&#x27;s interests in mathematics were manifold, including: geometry, complex analysis, number theory, mathematical physics, mathematical economics, cryptography and graph theory.
His famous paper &quot;Die Theorie der regulären graphs&quot; was a fundamental contribution to modern graph theory as we know it today. In 1898, he presented a counterexample to Tait&#x27;s claimed theorem about 1-factorability of 3-regular graphs, which is nowadays known as the &quot;Petersen graph&quot;. In cryptography and mathematical economics he made contributions which today are seen as pioneering.

He published a systematic treatment of geometrical constructions (with straightedge and compass) in 1880. A French translation was reprinted in 1990.

A special issue of Discrete Mathematics has been dedicated to the 150th birthday of Petersen.

Petersen, as he claimed, had a very independent way of thinking. In order to preserve this independence he made a habit to read as little as possible of other people&#x27;s mathematics, pushing it to extremes. The consequences for his lack of knowledge of the literature of the time were severe. He spent a significant part of his time rediscovering already known results, in other cases already existing results had to be removed from a submitted paper and in other more serious cases a paper did not get published at all.

He started from very modest beginnings, and by hard work, some luck and some good connections, moved steadily upward to a station of considerable importance. In 1891 his work received royal recognition through the award of the Order of the Dannebrog. Among mathematicians he enjoyed an international reputation. At his death –which was front-page news in Copenhagen– the socialist newspaper Social-Demokraten correctly sensed the popular appeal of his story: here was a kind of Hans Christian Andersen of science, a child of the people who had made good in the intellectual world.

==Early life and education==
Peter Christian Julius Petersen was born on the 16th of June 1839 in Sorø on Zealand. His parents were Jens Petersen (1803–1873), a dyer by profession, and Anna Cathrine Petersen (1813–1896), born Wiuff. He had two younger brothers, Hans Christian Rudolf Petersen (1844–1868) and Carl Sophus Valdemar Petersen (1846–1935), and two sisters, Nielsine Cathrine Marie Petersen (1837–?) and Sophie Caroline Petersen (1842–?). After preparation in a private school, he was admitted in 1849 into second grade at the Sorø Academy, a prestigious boarding school. He was taken out of school after his confirmation in 1854, because his parents could not afford to keep him there, and he worked as an apprentice for almost a year in an uncle&#x27;s grocery in Kolding, Jutland. The uncle died, however, and left Petersen a sum of money that enabled him to return to Sorø, pass the real-examination in 1856 with distinction, and begin his studies at the Polytechnical College in Copenhagen. In 1860 Petersen passed the first part of the civil engineering examination. By that same year he had decided to study mathematics at the university, rather than to continue with the more practical second part of the engineering education. However, his inheritance was used up and he now had to teach to make a living. From 1859 to 1871 he taught at one of Copenhagen&#x27;s most prestigious private high-schools, the , with occasional part-time teaching jobs at other private schools. In 1862 he passed the student-examination, and could now enter the university. In 1866 Julius Petersen obtained the degree of magister in mathematics at the University, and by 1871 he obtained the Dr. Phil. Degree at Copenhagen University. In his &quot;doctorvita&quot; written for the university, Petersen wrote: &quot;&quot;Mathematics had, from the time I started to learn it, taken my complete interest, and most of my work consisted in solving problems of my own and my friends, and in seeking the trisection of the angle, a problem that has had a great influence on my whole development&quot;.&quot;

In the summer of 1871, he married Laura Kirstine Bertelsen (1837–1901) and seven months later the couple had their first son Aage Wiuff-Petersen (1863–1927). Later the family increased with another son, Thor Ejnar Petersen (1867–1946), and a daughter, Agnete Helga Kathrine Petersen (1872–1941).

==Work==
Many of Petersen&#x27;s early contributions to mathematics were mainly focused on geometry. During the 1860s he wrote five textbooks along with some papers, all on geometry. One of his most remarkable works was a book, &quot;‘Methods and Theories’&quot;. The first edition of this book appeared only in Danish, but the 1879 edition was translated into eight different languages including English, French, and Spanish, earning him an international reputation more than any of his other works.

In graph theory, two of Petersen&#x27;s most famous contributions are: the Petersen graph, exhibited in 1898, served as a counterexample to Tait&#x27;s ‘theorem’ on the 4-colour problem: a bridgeless 3-regular graph is factorable into three 1-factors and the theorem: &quot;‘a connected 3-regular graph with at most two leaves contains a 1-factor’&quot;.

In 1891 Petersen published a paper in the Acta Mathematica (volume 15, pages 193–220) entitled &quot;‘Die Theorie der regularen graphs’&quot;. It was the first paper containing (correct) results explicitly in graph theory. The paper consisted of four major parts:
:(i) The transformation of the original algebraic problem into a graph theoretical one
:(ii) The problem of factorizing regular graphs of even degree. Here Petersen proves his first major result, viz. that any such graph has a 2-factorization (2-factor theorem).
:(iii) Criteria for the existence of edge-separating factorizations of 4-regular graphs.
:(iv) The factorization of regular graphs of odd degree, in particular, the theorem that any bridgeless 3-regular graph can be decomposed into a l-factor and a 2-factor (Petersen&#x27;s theorem).

Between 1887 and 1895 Petersen also contributed to mathematics with different models and instruments. one of these models was a ‘eine Serie von kinematischen Modellen’ which in 1888 was asked by ‘Verlagsbuchhandler L. Brill’ for permission to produce and sell. In 1887 Petersen had constructed another model; a planimeter which was presented to the Royal Danish Academy of Science and Letters. It consisted of an arm, of, whose one end o is fixed to the paper by a lead cylinder with a pin p, and whose other end f is connected to a second arm dc (or df) of length L. When the stylus d is moved around the domain once, the area is measured as L∫dh, where dh is the differential displacement of the arm dc orthogonal to itself.

==Last years==
In the spring of 1908 Petersen suffered a stroke. Even in this condition his optimism and desire to work did not stop. In a letter to Mittag-Leffler in Stockholm he wrote: &quot;“I feel in all respects rather well, it is only that I cannot walk and have difficulties in talking. However, I hope to get so far this summer that I can resume my lectures in the autumn”.&quot; His last two years became a period of physical and mental debility, where, towards the end, he hardly had any memory left of his wide interests and the rich work which had filled his life. In 1909 he retired from his professorship. He died on 5 August 1910, having spent for five months in hospital. He was buried at Vestre Kirkegaard, where Copenhagen University cared for his grave until 1947.

<text>Oregon City is the county seat of Clackamas County, Oregon, United States, located on the Willamette River near the southern limits of the Portland metropolitan area. As of the 2020 census, the city population was 37,572. Established in 1829 by the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company, in 1844 it became the first U.S. city west of the Rocky Mountains to be incorporated.

== History ==

Known in recent decades as the site of several large paper mills on the Willamette River, the city played a significant role in the early history of the Oregon Country. It was established by Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company&#x27;s Dr. John McLoughlin in 1829 near the confluence of the Clackamas River with the Willamette to take advantage of the power of Willamette Falls to run a lumber mill. During the 1840s and 1850s it was the destination for those wanting to file land claims after traveling the Oregon Trail as the last stop on the trail.

It was the capital of the Oregon Territory from its establishment in 1848 until 1851, and rivaled Portland for early supremacy in the area. In 1846, the city&#x27;s newspaper, the &quot;Oregon Spectator&quot;, was the first American newspaper to be published west of the Rocky Mountains. Oregon City College was established in 1849 as a Baptist school, but was defunct by the 1870s. Oregon City was the site of the Beaver Coins Mint, producing the short-lived independent Oregon Territory currency in 1849.

The center of the city retains part of its historic character through the preservation of houses and other buildings from the era of the city&#x27;s founding.

=== Former Latin archdiocese ===
The town became the see city of the first Roman Catholic archdiocese in the western United States, when the diocese of Oregon City, established in 1846, was raised to metropolitan rank, with Archbishop François Norbert Blanchet as its ordinary. Its territory included all of the western United States. The population in the area of Oregon City declined due to the California Gold Rush. The population of nearby Portland grew, and the headquarters of the archdiocese was moved there in 1926. In 1928 the name Archdiocese of Portland in Oregon replaced the former name. No longer a residential bishopric, Oregon City is now a titular see.

== Geography ==
The town is divided into upper and lower areas. The lower area is on a bench next to the Willamette River. The upper area is atop a bluff composed of Canemah basalt, which flowed about 2.5 million years ago from a vent to the southeast in the Boring Lava Field. For many years, Indian trails connected the two levels, but stairs were built in the 19th century. In 1915 the town built the water-powered Oregon City Municipal Elevator to connect the two parts, which was converted to electricity in the 1920s. In 1952, a new electric elevator was constructed with the specification that it was to be &quot;as plain as possible and without ornament.&quot;

According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which is land and is water. The major waterways of Oregon City include the Willamette River, which flows along the northwest side of the city, and the Clackamas River, which merges with the larger Willamette to the north of the city. The Willamette forms the boundary between Oregon City and West Linn; the Clackamas serves as the boundary between Oregon City and Gladstone.

=== Willamette Falls ===

The Willamette Falls Locks in West Linn were the first multi-lift navigational locks in the United States and are now a National Historical Site, no longer in use. The first long-distance electrical service in the United States originated in Oregon City in 1889, transmitting electricity to Portland.

=== Climate ===

Oregon City has a Mediterranean climate (Köppen &quot;Csb&quot;). The Mediterranean climate regime resembles the climate of the lands in the Mediterranean Basin, parts of western North America, parts of Western and South Australia, in southwestern South Africa and in parts of central Chile. The climate is characterized by hot, dry summers and cool, wet winters.

The average temperature throughout the year is , with the highest average temperature in July and August being , and December being the coldest month with an average temperature of . The annual precipitation is . It is mainly concentrated in winter (November to March), and the precipitation in July and August is obviously much less than in other months. In terms of temperature, there are 122 days with temperatures exceeding per year, 18 days with temperatures exceeding , and one high-temperature day exceeding . However, there is no more than one ice day with the maximum temperature below per year. Extreme temperatures range from on January 31, 1950, to on June 28, 2021.
== Economy ==

For much of its existence, Oregon City&#x27;s economy has been dominated by the forestry industry, until the decline of the Pacific Northwest lumber industry started in the 1980s. At its height, several mills operated in the city and surrounding communities. The last paper mill in the immediate vicinity closed in 2017 but reopened in 2019 under new ownership.

With the growth of the Portland Metro region, Oregon City has become largely a suburb of Portland. Tourism is a growing sector with the emphasis on the city&#x27;s history and the major renovation of the Willamette Falls area into a public-access, mixed-use space through the Willamette Falls Legacy Project.

== Government ==
Oregon City is governed by a Mayor and a City Commission composed of the Mayor and four Commissioners elected from the City at large for terms of four years each.

Oregon City was the capital of the Oregon Territory until 1851; the following governors served during that time:
*George Abernethy, provisional governor of the Oregon Country 1845–48
*Joseph Lane, first governor of the Oregon Territory, 1848–50
*Kintzing Prichette, 2nd Territorial Governor of Oregon, 1850
*John P. Gaines, 3rd Territorial Governor of Oregon, 1850–53. During his term (and against his wishes), the territorial capital of Oregon moved to Salem.

== Education ==
The city, and several surrounding communities, is served by the Oregon City School District, a public school district consisting of 7 elementary schools, two middle schools, a traditional four-year high school (Oregon City High School), and an alternative secondary school. Several schools in the district offer bilingual English/Spanish programs. Oregon City High School is the third most populated high school in Oregon, and is a state and national power in girls&#x27; basketball, winning three consecutive &quot;USA Today&quot; girls&#x27; national championships in the 1990s.

The city also is the home of Clackamas Community College, numerous private and parochial schools, and a public library that is part of the Library Information Network of Clackamas County.

== Points of interest ==

===Museums and historic buildings===

Museums include the Museum of the Oregon Territory and the End of the Oregon Trail Interpretive Center, with costumed &quot;living history&quot; guides. The Clackamas County Historical Society archives, housed in the Museum of the Oregon Territory, also include the incorporation plat for the city of San Francisco. Clackamas Heritage Partners owns and operates these museums, along with the Stevens Crawford Museum. In 2009, Clackamas Heritage Partners announced that it could no longer afford to keep the museums open. The End of the Oregon Trail Interpretive Center was closed to the public indefinitely in September 2009; the Stevens Crawford Museum and Museum of the Oregon Territory, staffed largely by volunteers, continued to operate on a limited schedule.
The End of the Oregon Trail Interpretive Center eventually reopened during the summer of 2013 with the support of grants and donations from numerous sources.

The Stevens-Crawford Heritage House Museum is a 1908 structure with 11 furnished rooms; exhibiting furniture from the collection of the Clackamas County Historical Society to replicate an Edwardian era home and Progressive Era narrative. Other historical buildings in Oregon City include the McLoughlin House, the Ermatinger House (oldest in Clackamas County), the Bank of Commerce Building, the Ainsworth House, the Harvey Cross House, the Oregon City Masonic Lodge, and the First Congregational Church.

The Oregon City Bridge over the Willamette River, built in 1922, is listed on the National Register of Historic Places, as is the Oregon City Municipal Elevator.

===Parks===
Oregon City has over 22 city parks. One of the city&#x27;s larger parks is Clackamette Park, at the confluence of the Clackamas and Willamette Rivers. The park&#x27;s features include RV camping, a boat launch and dock, a skateboard park, and other recreational facilities. Several community festivals are held there throughout the year. Other major parks include Chapin, Hillendale, Jon Storm Park, Rivercrest, and Wesley Lynn.

==Transportation==

===Road===
Interstate 205 passes through the city&#x27;s northern edge, and is the only freeway to serve the city. In addition, three state highways (Oregon Route 43, Oregon Route 99E, and Oregon Route 213) pass through or terminate in Oregon City. The former two serve the city&#x27;s downtown core, the latter provides service to the southern parts of Oregon City.

===Rail===
The Union Pacific Railroad mainline passes through the city. The city also has an Amtrak station, which is served twice daily in each direction by Amtrak &quot;Cascades&quot; trains running between Portland and Eugene, Oregon. The &quot;Coast Starlight&quot; (Seattle–Los Angeles) passes through but does not stop.

===Air===
There are no public airports within the city. A small private airfield is along Beavercreek Road, south of Oregon City. Oregon City is served by Portland International Airport, to the north, and by Portland-Mulino Airport, a general-aviation facility in the town of Mulino, approximately to the south.

===Water===
The Willamette River in Oregon City is navigable to small craft, and Oregon City has a thriving fishing and recreational boating industry. The Willamette Falls Locks once allowed boats to navigate around the falls. The Clackamas River is not navigable, except for the lowermost portions.

===Mass transit===
As part of the greater Portland metropolitan area, Oregon City is served by TriMet, the regional transit authority, with several bus lines which converge at the Oregon City Transit Center. Until 1958, an interurban trolley line operated by the now-defunct Portland Traction Company connected Oregon City with Portland; remnants of this line are still visible (such as an abandoned bridge across the Clackamas River, just east of the OR 99E bridge). In more recent years, the city operated a &quot;historic trolley&quot; service during the summer months, primarily to serve the needs of tourism, but the vehicles used were trolley-replica buses, rather than actual trolley cars, and in 2013 it was decided to discontinue that service and sell the vehicles.

Two other public agencies provide transit service in Oregon City, supplementing that of TriMet. The South Clackamas Transportation District (SCTD) operates a route between Clackamas Community College on the south east end of Oregon City to Molalla, about south on Oregon Route 213. Canby Area Transit (CAT) operates regular service on Oregon Route 99E between the Oregon City Transit Center and Canby. SMART, South Metro Area Regional Transit, serving Wilsonville, connects to CAT in Canby. CAT also has service to Woodburn.

Dial-a-Ride service is operated by TriMet, but CAT also operates within the Oregon City city limits for trips originating or terminating in the CAT service area. If transfers between TriMet and CAT are necessary, they are accomplished at the Oregon City Transit Center (OCTC) at 11th &amp; Main, which is at the northeast end of the downtown area.

== Neighborhoods ==

Oregon City has 12 officially recognized neighborhood associations:

* The Park Place neighborhood is in the Northeast on a bluff overlooking Abernethy Green. Formerly an independent community, Park Place was platted in 1889, and a post office was established the following year. For a while the name was changed to &quot;Parkplace.&quot;
* The Two Rivers neighborhood is the lowest-elevation area of town and is primarily commercial, including downtown Oregon City, the End of the Oregon Trail Visitor&#x27;s Center at Abernethy Green, and Clackamette Park.

* The McLoughlin neighborhood is on a bluff overlooking downtown and includes many of the older homes in the City including designated sites like the John McLoughlin House. The McLoughlin Neighborhood also includes the public library, pool, and hospital.
* The Elyville neighborhood surrounds the Northern section of Molalla Avenue, the former route of Oregon Route 213 before it was moved to the Oregon City Bypass to the east. Elyville includes the historic Mountain View Cemetery where many of the oldest pioneer settlers are buried.
* The Canemah neighborhood lies along Oregon Route 99E, and is a narrow strip of land sandwiched between the Willamette River and a bluff. Canemah was founded in 1845 as an independent city before being annexed into Oregon City. It was the portage site around Willamette Falls for many years. It was supposedly named after an Indian chief.
* The Rivercrest neighborhood overlooks the Willamette River to the West.
* The South End neighborhood is in the Southwest.
* The Hazel Grove/Westling Farm neighborhood is on the Southern side of the city.
* The Tower Vista neighborhood is also in the South, East of Hazel Grove/Whistling Farm.
* The Hillendale neighborhood lies in the central part of the city and contains the Clackamas County government campus.
* The Gaffney Lane neighborhood lies south of Hillendale, centered around the elementary school of the same name.
* The Caufield neighborhood is the farthest southeast and includes Clackamas Community College and Oregon City High School.

<text>Christian Jürgensen Thomsen (29 December 1788 – 21 May 1865) was a Danish antiquarian who developed early archaeological techniques and methods.

In 1816 he was appointed head of &#x27;antiquarian&#x27; collections which later developed into the National Museum of Denmark in Copenhagen. While organizing and classifying the antiquities for exhibition, he decided to present them chronologically according to the three-age system. Other scholars had previously proposed that prehistory had advanced from an age of stone tools, to ages of tools made from bronze and iron, but these proposals were presented as systems of evolution, which did not allow dating of artifacts. Thomsen refined the three-age system as a chronological system by seeing which artifacts occurred with which other artifacts in closed finds. In this way, he was the first to establish an evidence-based division of prehistory into discrete periods. This achievement led to his being credited as the originator of the three-age system of European antiquity. 

Thomsen also wrote one of the first systematic treatises on gold bracteates of the Migration period. Thomsen&#x27;s study of artifacts within the Copenhagen museum were based on associations between stylistic change, decoration and context; he recognised the importance of examining objects from &quot;closed finds&quot;, allowing him to determine the associations of common artifacts for various periods (stone - bronze - iron). His results were published in the &quot;Ledetraad til Nordisk Oldkyndighed&quot; (Guideline to Nordic Antiquity) in 1836. An English translation was produced in 1848.

==Early life==
Christian Jurgensen Thomsen was born in Copenhagen in 1788 into a wealthy merchant family. As a young man he visited Paris and once he had returned to Denmark, became interested in coin collecting. This may have helped him develop his awareness of stylistic change through time.

==Contributions to archaeology==
In 1816 Thomsen was selected to curate Danish Royal Commission for the Collection and Preservation of Antiquities&#x27; first exhibition. As the post was unsalaried, Thomsen&#x27;s independent means and his experience as a collector of coins were his primary qualifications.

He probably knew of the three-age model of prehistory through the works of Lucretius, Vedel Simonsen, Montfaucon and Mahudel, and decided to sort the material in the collection chronologically. Before Thomsen, this might have been done by mechanically sorting the materials according to their materials or the level of craftsmanship they displayed, but as the provenance of many of the materials were known, he could see that crude artifacts were sometimes found with fine ones and metal artifacts with artifacts of stone. Rather than take a simple technological or evolutionary approach, he realized that the task was to determine in which periods the artifacts had been made.

Thomsen decided to map out which kinds of phenomena co-occurred in deposits and which did not, as this would allow him to discern any trends that were exclusive to certain periods. In this way he discovered that stone tools were found in connection with amber, pottery, glass beads, whereas bronze was found with both iron and gold, but silver was only found in connection with iron. He also found that bronze weapons did not occur with iron artifacts - so that each period could be defined by its preferred cutting material. He also found that the types of grave goods varied between burial types: stone tools were found with uncremated corpses and stone-chamber tombs, bronze weapons and lurs in relation to stone-schist graves, and iron with chamber tombs in barrows. Thomsen was the first to use the terms Stone Age, Bronze Age and the Iron Age. When detractors asked rhetorically why there was no &quot;glass age&quot;, Thomsen responded that glass beads were found in all three periods, but bowls of glass only in the Iron Age. 

To Thomsen the find circumstances were the key to dating. As early as 1821, he wrote in a letter to fellow antiquarian Schröder that, &quot;[n]othing is more important than to point out that hitherto we have not paid enough attention to what was found together,&quot; and, the next year, that &quot;[we] still do not know enough about most of the antiquities either … only future archaeologists may be able to decide, but they will never be able to do so if they do not observe what things are found together and our collections are not brought to a greater degree of perfection.&quot;

This analysis emphasizing co-occurrence and systematic attention to archaeological context allowed Thomsen to build a chronological framework of the materials in the collection and to classify new finds in relation to the established chronology, even without much knowledge of its provenience. In this way, Thomsen&#x27;s system was a true chronological system rather than an evolutionary or technological system. His chronology was established by 1825, and visitors to the museum were instructed in his methods. Thomsen also published journal articles and pamphlets in which he emphasized the importance of the find circumstances for later interpretation and dating. Finally, in 1836, he published the illustrated monograph &quot;Guide to Northern Antiquity&quot;, in which he described his chronology together with comments about which things occurred together in finds. 

Like previous antiquarians, such as Winckelmann, Thomsen paid attention to stylistic analysis as well, but he used his chronological framework as evidence that stylistic developments had taken place, not the other way round. Thomsen may have been able to make his early advances in the development of archaeology because he had such a wide variety of material to review, consisting of collective finds from a large relatively homogeneous culture area. He was the first to develop it into a chronological system rather than a speculative evolutionary model.

Thomsen was an important influence on subsequent generations of prehistorians in Scandinavia, and he taught his methods to archaeologists such as J. J. A. Worsaae and Bror Emil Hildebrand and later Oscar Montelius. He also importantly influenced and was influenced by contemporary Swedish prehistorians such as Sven Nilsson. 

Thomsen&#x27;s &quot;Ledetraad til Nordisk Oldkyndighed&quot; (Guideline to Nordic Antiquity; 1836) was published in English in 1848. Worsaae&#x27;s &quot;The Primeval Antiquities of Denmark&quot; was published in English in 1849; the two works were highly influential on the development of archaeology theory and practice in Great Britain and the United States.

In 1862, he was elected as a member of the American Philosophical Society.

==Influence on art==
Together with Niels Laurits Høyen, Thomsen had great influence on the arts in Copenhagen. He was active as a board in the influential &quot;Kunstforeningen&quot; (Art Society) in the 1830s when its member numbers and position peaked. In 1839 he was appointed as inspector at the Royal Painting Collection alongside Niels Laurits Høyen. Many private collectors also consulted Thomsen.

<text>Guide dogs (colloquially known in the US as seeing-eye dogs) are assistance dogs trained to lead blind or visually impaired people around obstacles. Although dogs can be trained to navigate various obstacles, they are red–green colour blind and incapable of interpreting street signs. The human does the directing, based on skills acquired through previous mobility training. The handler might be likened to an aircraft&#x27;s navigator, who must know how to get from one place to another, and the dog is the pilot, who gets them there safely. In several countries guide dogs, along with most other service and hearing dogs, are exempt from regulations against the presence of animals in places such as restaurants and public transportation.

==History==
References to service animals date at least as far back as the mid-16th century. The second line of the popular verse alphabet &quot;A was an Archer&quot; is most commonly &quot;B was a Blind-man/Led by a dog&quot;. In Elizabeth Barrett Browning&#x27;s 19th-century verse novel &quot;Aurora Leigh&quot;, the title character remarks, &quot;The blind man walks wherever the dog pulls / And so I answered.&quot; Guide dogs are also mentioned in Charles Dickens&#x27; &quot;A Christmas Carol&quot;: &quot;Even the blind men&#x27;s dogs appeared to know him; and when they saw him coming on, would tug their owners into doorways and up courts; and then would wag their tails as though they said, &#x27;No eye at all is better than an evil eye, dark master!

Evidence suggests that dogs may have been used as guides for the visually impaired based on depictions of a blind-man being guided by his dog on the wall of a house in Herculaneum, buried when Vesuvius erupted in 79 CE. This and other visual depictions indicate that dogs have been common companions for the blind for thousands of years. Additional material evidence would be required to positively assess their use specifically as guides.

The first service dog training schools were established in Germany during World War I, to enhance the mobility of returning veterans who were blinded in combat. Interest in service animals outside of Germany did not become widespread until Dorothy Harrison Eustis, an American dog breeder living in Switzerland, wrote a first-hand account about a service animal training school in Potsdam, Germany, that was published in &quot;The Saturday Evening Post&quot; in 1927. That same year, United States Senator Thomas D. Schall of Minnesota was paired with a service animal imported from Germany, who was trained by the owner of LaSalle Kennels, Jack Sinykin of Minnesota.

The service animal movement did not take hold in America until Nashville resident Morris Frank returned from Switzerland after being trained with one of Eustis&#x27;s dogs, a female German shepherd named Buddy. Frank and Buddy embarked on a publicity tour to convince Americans of the abilities of service animals and the need to allow people with service animals access to public transportation, hotels, and other areas open to the public. In 1929, Eustis and Frank co-founded The Seeing Eye school in Nashville, Tennessee (relocated in 1931 to New Jersey).

The first service animals in Great Britain were German Shepherds. Four of these first were Flash, Judy, Meta, and Folly, who were handed over to their new owners, veterans blinded in World War I, on 6 October 1931 in Wallasey, Merseyside. Judy&#x27;s new owner was Musgrave Frankland. In 1934, The Guide Dogs for the Blind Association in Great Britain began operation, although their first permanent trainer was a Russian military officer, Captain Nikolai Liakhoff, who moved to the UK in 1933.

Elliott S. Humphrey was an animal breeder who trained the first guide dogs for the blind used in the United States. Humphrey was hired to breed German shepherds at a centre in Switzerland that had been set up by Dorothy Harrison Eustis of Philadelphia and began the work that led to the Seeing-Eye Dog program.

The first dogs produced at the centre, known as Fortunate Fields, were used for military and police work and for tracking missing persons. Then Humphrey trained German shepherds to guide the blind.

The Germans had developed a guide dog program during World War I, but Mr. Humphrey devised different procedures and it is his that are followed in the United States.

==Research==
Important studies on the behaviour and training methods of service animals were done in the 1920s and 1930s by Jakob von Uexküll and Emanuel Georg Sarris. They studied the value of service animals and introduced advanced methods of training. There have also been important studies into the discrimination experienced by people that use service and assistance animals.

==Breeds==
Guide dog breeds are chosen for temperament and trainability. At the moment Golden Retrievers, Labradors, Standard Poodles, German Shepherds, and Golden Retriever/Labrador crosses are most likely to be chosen by service animal facilities.

The most popular breed used globally today is the Labrador Retriever. This breed has a good range of size, is easily kept due to its short coat, is generally healthy and has a gentle but willing temperament. Crosses such as the Goldador (Golden Retriever/Labrador), combine the sensitivity of the Golden Retriever and the tolerance of the Labrador Retriever. Also common are Labradoodles, i.e., Labrador/Poodles, are bred to help reduce allergens as all breeds shed but levels vary.

Some schools, such as the Guide Dog Foundation, have added Standard Poodles to their breed registry. Although German Shepherds were once a common breed used for guide work, many schools have discontinued using these dogs due to the skills and unwavering leadership role required by the handler to keep the breed active and non-destructive.

==Accessibility==

Despite regulations or rules that deny access to animals in restaurants and other public places, in many countries, service animals are protected by law and therefore may accompany their handlers most places that are open to the public. Laws and regulations vary worldwide:
*In the United States, the Americans with Disabilities Act prohibits any business, government agency, or other organization that provides access to the general public from barring service animals, except where their presence would cause a health or safety risk. However, religious organizations are not required to provide such access. Whether service animals in training have the same rights or not usually falls on each individual state government. Surprisingly, the ADA stipulates the Veterans Hospitals system does not have to follow these laws and can refuse admittance to military vets with service animals. In addition, the Fair Housing Act requires that landlords allow tenants to have service animals, as well as other types of assistance animals, in residences that normally have a &quot;No Pets&quot; policy and that no extra fees may be charged for such tenants. The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development&#x27;s Office of Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity investigates complaints from the public alleging denials of reasonable accommodation requests involving assistance animals.
*In the United Kingdom the Equality Act 2010 (England, Scotland, Wales) and Disability Discrimination Act 1995 (Northern Ireland) provides for people with disabilities to have the same right to services supplied by shops, banks, hotels, libraries, pubs, taxis, and restaurants as everyone else. Service providers have to make &quot;reasonable adjustments&quot; to accommodate assistance dog owners. Under Part 12 of the EA and part 5 of the DDA, it is illegal for assistance dog owners to be refused access to a taxi or minicab with their assistance dog, but medical exemptions are available if drivers have a certificate from their GPs.
*In most South American countries and Mexico, service animal access depends solely upon the goodwill of the owner or manager. In more tourist-heavy areas, service animals are generally welcomed without problems. In Brazil, however, a 2006 federal decree requires allowance of service animals in all public and open-to-public places. The Federal District Metro has developed a program that trains service animals to ride it.
*In Malta, the Equal Opportunities Act 2000 (Cap. 413) states that it is illegal to discriminate against a disabled person who needs an assistant, in this case, a service animal. The few exceptions are restaurant kitchens, hospital special wards, toilets and premises where other animals are kept.
*In Australia, the Disability Discrimination Act 1992 protects service animals handlers. Each state and territory has its own laws, which may differ slightly.
*In Canada, service animals are allowed anywhere that the general public is allowed. Service Animal laws by province:
**Alberta: Blind Persons&#x27; Rights Act, Service Dogs Act
**British Columbia: Guide Animal Act
**Manitoba: The Human Rights Code, The Service Animals Protection Act
**New Brunswick: Human Rights Act
**Newfoundland &amp; Labrador: Blind Persons&#x27; Rights Act, Human Rights Act
**Northwest Territories: Human Rights Act
**Nova Scotia: Blind Persons&#x27; Rights Act, Human Rights Act
**Nunavut: Human Rights Act
**Ontario: Blind Persons&#x27; Rights Act, Accessibility for Ontarians with Disabilities Act, Human Rights Code
**Prince Edward Island: Human Rights Act
**Quebec: Individuals with Disabilities Act, Charter of Human Rights and Freedoms
**Saskatchewan: Human Rights Code
**Yukon: Human Rights Act
*In South Korea, it is illegal to deny access to service animals in any areas that are open to the public. Violators are fined no more than 2 million Korean Won.
*In Portugal, service animals are allowed anywhere that the general public is allowed. The Law - Decreto-Lei n.74/2007 - Establish their rights.
* In Switzerland, service animals are allowed anywhere that the general public is allowed.
*In Russia, service animals are allowed anywhere that the general public is allowed. Guide dogs are exempt from the fare charges in public transportation.

==Discrimination==
Since some schools of thought in Islam consider dogs in general to be unclean, Muslim taxi drivers and store owners have sometimes refused to accommodate customers who have service animals, which has led to discrimination charges against them. However, in 2003 the Islamic Sharia Council, a British organization that provides non-binding guidance on interpreting Islamic religious law, ruled that the ban on dogs does not apply to those used for guide work.

==Benefits of owning a guide dog==

Studies show owning a pet or therapy animal offers beneficial effects psychologically, socially, and physiologically, and guide dogs are no exception. Some blind people report experiencing increased levels of confidence, a greater sense of security, and a cherished friendship from owning guide dogs. Some also state that owning a guide dog has encouraged them to exercise more, especially by walking. This is attributed to a willingness to venture outdoors facilitated by a sense of independence. Some blind people claim meeting others and socializing is easier with a guide dog, and people are more likely to offer assistance when there is a service animal present. The animals may also lead to increased interactions with other people, providing an easy topic of conversation. Guide dogs may be more deliberate than the use of a long cane when leading their handlers in an unfamiliar place. The animal directs the right path, eliminating the trial and error users may experience with a cane. Some report that guide dogs make the experience of the unknown more relaxing. Many blind people using a guide dog report travel is much faster and safer.

Owners of guide dogs share a special bond with their animal. Many report that the animal is a member of the family and, often, the handler goes to their animal for comfort and support. The animal is not seen as a working animal, but more as a loyal friend. However, it is important to remember that guide dogs are working animals and should not be distracted or treated as a pet while they are on duty.

People often have misconceptions about guide dogs, including believing they work all the time. In reality, the dogs usually work only when their handler leaves their residence. The handler tells the dog where they want to go, and the dogs are taught intelligent disobedience—blocking the handler from proceeding when there is an unsafe situation.

<text>Underground hard-rock mining refers to various underground mining techniques used to excavate &quot;hard&quot; minerals, usually those containing metals, such as ore containing gold, silver, iron, copper, zinc, nickel, tin, and lead. It also involves the same techniques used to excavate ores of gems, such as diamonds and rubies. Soft-rock mining refers to the excavation of softer minerals, such as salt, coal, and oil sands.

==Mine access==

===Underground access===
Accessing underground ore can be achieved via a decline (ramp), inclined vertical shaft or adit.

*Declines can be a spiral tunnel which circles either the flank of the deposit or circles around the deposit. The decline begins with a box cut, which is the portal to the surface. Depending on the amount of overburden and quality of bedrock, a galvanized steel culvert may be required for safety purposes. They may also be started into the wall of an open cut mine.
*Shafts are vertical excavations sunk adjacent to an ore body. Shafts are sunk for ore bodies where haulage to surface via truck is not economical. Shaft haulage is more economical than truck haulage at depth, and a mine may have both a decline and a ramp.
*Adits are horizontal excavations into the side of a hill or mountain. Adits are used for horizontal or near-horizontal ore bodies where there is no need for a ramp or shaft.

Declines are often started from the side of the high wall of an open cut mine when the ore body is of a payable grade sufficient to support an underground mining operation, but the strip ratio has become too great to support open cast extraction methods. They are also often built and maintained as an emergency safety access from the underground workings and a means of moving large equipment to the workings.

===Ore access===
Levels are excavated horizontally off the decline or shaft to access the ore body. Stopes are then excavated perpendicular (or near perpendicular) to the level into the ore.

==Development mining vs. production mining==
There are two principal phases of underground mining: development mining and production mining.

Development mining is composed of excavation almost entirely in (non-valuable) waste rock in order to gain access to the orebody. There are six steps in development mining: remove previously blasted material (muck out round), scaling (removing any unstable slabs of rock hanging from the roof and sidewalls to protect workers and equipment from damage), installing support or/and reinforcement using shotcrete or other supports, drill face rock, load explosives, and blast explosives. To start the mining, the first step is to make the path to go down. The path is defined as &#x27;Decline&#x27; as describe above. Before the start of a decline, all pre-planning of the power facility, drilling arrangement, de-watering, ventilation and, muck withdrawal facilities are required.

Production mining is further broken down into two methods, long hole and short hole. Short hole mining is similar to development mining, except that it occurs in ore. There are several different methods of long hole mining. Typically, long hole mining requires two excavations within the ore at different elevations below surface, (15 m – 30 m apart). Holes are drilled between the two excavations and loaded with explosives. The holes are blasted and the ore is removed from the bottom excavation.

==Ventilation==
One of the most important aspects of underground hard rock mining is ventilation. Ventilation is the primary method of clearing hazardous gases and/or dust which are created from drilling and blasting activity (e.g., silica dust, NOx), diesel equipment (e.g., diesel particulate, carbon monoxide), or to protect against gases that are naturally emanating from the rock (e.g., radon gas). Ventilation is also used to manage underground temperatures for the workers. In deep, hot mines ventilation is used to cool the workplace; however, in very cold locations the air is heated to just above freezing before it enters the mine. Ventilation raises are typically used to transfer ventilation from surface to the workplaces, and can be modified for use as emergency escape routes. The primary sources of heat in underground hard rock mines are virgin rock temperature, machinery, auto compression, and fissure water. Other small contributing factors are human body heat and blasting.

==Ground support==
Some means of support is required in order to maintain the stability of the openings that are excavated. This support comes in two forms; local support and area support.

===Area ground support===
Area ground support is used to prevent major ground failure. Holes are drilled into the back (ceiling) and walls and a long steel rod (or rock bolt) is installed to hold the ground together. There are three categories of rock bolt, differentiated by how they engage the host rock. They are:

====Mechanical bolts====
*Point anchor bolts (or expansion shell bolts) are a common style of area ground support. A point anchor bolt is a metal bar between 20 mm – 25 mm in diameter, and between 1 m – 4 m long (the size is determined by the mine&#x27;s engineering department). There is an expansion shell at the end of the bolt which is inserted into the hole. As the bolt is tightened by the installation drill the expansion shell expands and the bolt tightens holding the rock together. Mechanical bolts are considered temporary support as their lifespan is reduced by corrosion as they are not grouted.

====Grouted bolts====
*Resin grouted rebar is used in areas which require more support than a point anchor bolt can give. The rebar used is of similar size as a point anchor bolt but does not have an expansion shell. Once the hole for the rebar is drilled, cartridges of polyester resin are installed in the hole. The rebar bolt is installed after the resin and spun by the installation drill. This opens the resin cartridge and mixes it. Once the resin hardens, the drill spinning tightens the rebar bolt holding the rock together. Resin grouted rebar is considered a permanent ground support with a lifespan of 20–30 years.
*Cable bolts are used to bind large masses of rock in the hanging wall and around large excavations. Cable bolts are much larger than standard rock bolts and rebar, usually between 6 and 25 metres long. Cable bolts are grouted with a cement grout.

====Friction bolts====
*Friction stabilizer (frequently called by the genericized trademark &quot;Split Set&quot;) are much easier to install than mechanical bolts or grouted bolts. The bolt is hammered into the drill hole, which has a smaller diameter than the bolt. Pressure from the bolt on the wall holds the rock together. Friction stabilizers are particularly susceptible to corrosion and rust from water unless they are grouted. Once grouted the friction increases by a factor of 3–4.
*Swellex is similar to Friction stabilizers, except the bolt diameter is smaller than the hole diameter. High pressure water is injected into the bolt to expand the bolt diameter to hold the rock together. Like the friction stabilizer, swellex is poorly protected from corrosion and rust.

===Local ground support===
Local ground support is used to prevent smaller rocks from falling from the back and ribs. Not all excavations require local ground support.
*Welded Wire Mesh is a metal screen with 10 cm x 10 cm (4 inch) openings. The mesh is held to the backs and walls using friction stabiliser bolts, point anchor bolts, or resin grouted rebar.
*Shotcrete is fibre-reinforced spray-on concrete which coats the back and ribs preventing smaller rocks from falling. Shotcrete thickness can be between 50 mm – 100 mm.
*Latex Membranes can be sprayed on the backs and ribs similar to shotcrete, but in smaller amounts.

==Stope and retreat vs. stope and fill==

===Stope and retreat===

Using this method, mining is planned to extract rock from the stopes without filling the voids; this allows the wall rocks to cave in to the extracted stope after all the ore has been removed. The stope is then sealed to prevent access.

===Stope and fill===
Where large bulk ore bodies are to be mined at great depth, or where leaving pillars of ore is uneconomical, the open stope is filled with backfill, which can be a cement and rock mixture, a cement and sand mixture or a cement and tailings mixture. This method is popular as the refilled stopes provide support for the adjacent stopes, allowing total extraction of economic resources.

==Methods==

The mining method selected is determined by the size, shape, orientation and type of orebody to be mined. The orebody can be narrow vein such as a gold mine in the Witwatersrand, the orebody can be massive similar to the Olympic Dam mine, South Australia, or Cadia-Ridgeway Mine, New South Wales. The width or size of the orebody is determined by the grade as well as the distribution of the ore. The dip of the orebody also has an influence on the mining method for example a narrow horizontal vein orebody will be mined by room and pillar or a longwall method whereas a vertical narrow vein orebody will be mined by an open stoping or cut and fill method. Further consideration is needed for the strength of the ore as well as the surrounding rock. An orebody hosted in strong self-supporting rock may be mined by an open stoping method and an orebody hosted in poor rock may need to be mined by a cut and fill method where the void is continuously filled as the ore is removed.

===Selective mining methods===
*Cut and fill mining is a method of short-hole mining used in steeply dipping or irregular ore zones, in particular where the hanging wall limits the use of long-hole methods. The ore is mined in horizontal or slightly inclined slices, and then filled with waste rock, sand or tailings. Either fill option may be cemented with binders to add cohesion to the matrix or left uncemented. Cut and fill mining is an expensive but selective method, with the advantages of low ore loss and dilution.
*Drift and fill is similar to cut and fill, except that it is used in ore zones, which are wider than the method of drifting will allow to be mined. In this case, the first drift is developed in the ore, and is backfilled using consolidated fill. The second drift is driven adjacent to the first drift. This carries on until the ore zone is mined out to its full width, at which time the second cut is started atop of the first cut.
*Shrinkage stoping is a short-hole mining method which is suitable for steeply dipping orebodies. This method is similar to cut and fill mining with the exception that after being blasted, broken ore is left in the stope where it is used to support the surrounding rock and as a platform from which to work. Only enough ore is removed from the stope to allow for drilling and blasting the next slice. The stope is emptied when all of the ore has been blasted. Although it is very selective and allows for low dilution, since most of the ore stays in the stope until mining is completed, there is a delayed return on capital investments.
* VRM/ VCR: Vertical retreat mining (VRM) also known as Vertical crater retreat (VCR) is a method where mine is divided in vertical zones with depth of about 50 meters using open stoping, bottom-up mining. Long-hole large-diameter holes are drilled vertically into the ore body from the top using in-the-hole (ITH) drills, and then blasting horizontal slices of the ore body into an undercut. Ore blasted in retrieval taken in phase. This retrieval is done from bottom of the section developed. Last cleaning of ore is done through remote controlled LHD machines. A system of primary and secondary stopes is often used in VCR mining, where primary stopes are mined in the first stage and then backfilled with cemented fill to provide wall support for the blasting of successive stopes. Side chambers will be mined in pre-planned sequence after the fill has solidified.

=== Bulk mining methods ===
*Block caving is used to mine massive steeply dipping orebodies (typically low grade) with high friability. An undercut with haulage access is driven under the orebody, with &quot;drawbells&quot; excavated between the top of the haulage level and the bottom of the undercut. The drawbells serve as a place for caving rock to fall into. The orebody is drilled and blasted above the undercut, and the ore is removed via the haulage access. Due to the friability of the orebody the ore above the first blast caves and falls into the drawbells. As ore is removed from the drawbells the orebody caves in, providing a steady stream of ore. If caving stops and removal of ore from the drawbells continues, a large void may form, resulting in the potential for a sudden and massive collapse and potentially catastrophic windblast throughout the mine. Where caving does continue, the ground surface may collapse into a surface depression such as those at the Climax and Henderson molybdenum mines in Colorado. Such a configuration is one of several to which miners apply the term &quot;glory hole&quot;.

Orebodies that do not cave readily are sometimes preconditioned by hydraulic fracturing, blasting, or by a combination of both. Hydraulic fracturing has been applied to preconditioning strong roof rock over coal longwall panels, and to inducing caving in both coal and hard rock mines.
*Room and pillar : Room and pillar mining is commonly done in flat or gently dipping bedded ore bodies. Pillars are left in place in a regular pattern while the rooms are mined out. In many room and pillar mines, the pillars are taken out starting at the farthest point from the stope access, allowing the roof to collapse and fill in the stope. This allows for greater recovery as less ore is left behind in pillars.
*Sublevel caving
*Raise caving : This is a method designed for high-angle orebodies at depth where regional stresseses are high. In raise caving the rock masses are de-stressed by establishing slots parallel to the dip of the orebody. It is a new method under development by LKAB in northern Sweden.
==Ore removal==

In mines which use rubber-tired equipment for coarse ore removal, the ore (or &quot;muck&quot;) is removed (&quot;mucked out&quot; or &quot;bogged&quot;) from the stope using center articulated vehicles. These vehicles are referred to as &quot;boggers&quot; or LHD (Load, Haul, Dump machines). These pieces of equipment may operate using diesel engines or electric motors, and resemble a low-profile front end loader. Electrically powered LHD utilize trailing cables which are flexible and can be extended or retracted on a reel.
In shallower mines the ore is then dumped into a truck to be hauled to the surface. In deeper mines, the ore is dumped down an ore pass (a vertical or near vertical excavation) where it falls to a collection level. On the collection level, it may receive primary crushing by a jaw or cone crusher, or by a rockbreaker. The ore is then moved by conveyor belts, trucks or occasionally trains to the shaft to be hoisted to the surface in buckets or skips and emptied into bins beneath the surface headframe for transport to the mill.

In some cases the underground primary crusher feeds an inclined conveyor belt which delivers ore via an incline shaft direct to the surface. The ore is fed down ore passes, with mining equipment accessing the ore body via a decline from the surface.

<doc id="76893" wikidata="Q2072665" url="?curid=76893" title="Sholto Douglas, 1st Baron Douglas of Kirtleside">
<text>Marshal of the Royal Air Force William Sholto Douglas, 1st Baron Douglas of Kirtleside, (23 December 1893 – 29 October 1969) was a senior commander in the Royal Air Force. After serving as a pilot, then a flight commander and finally as a squadron commander during the First World War, he served as a flying instructor during the inter-war years before becoming Director of Staff Duties and then Assistant Chief of the Air Staff at the Air Ministry.

During the Second World War Douglas clashed with other senior commanders over strategy in the Battle of Britain. Douglas argued for a more aggressive engagement with a &quot;Big Wing&quot; strategy, i.e. using massed fighters to defend the United Kingdom against enemy bombers. He then became Air Officer Commanding-in-Chief of Fighter Command in which role he was responsible for rebuilding the command&#x27;s strength after the attrition of the Battle of Britain, but also for bringing it on the offensive to wrest the initiative in the air from the German Luftwaffe.

Douglas went on to be Air Officer Commanding in Chief of RAF Middle East Command in which role he was an advocate of Operation Accolade, a planned British amphibious assault on Rhodes and the Dodecanese Islands in the Aegean Sea, and was disappointed when it was abandoned. He became commander of the British Zone of Occupation in Germany after the war.

From 1949 to 1964 he served as chairman of British European Airways.

==Early life==
Born the son of Robert Langton Douglas and his wife Margaret Jane Douglas (née Cannon), Douglas was educated at Emanuel School, Tonbridge School and Lincoln College, Oxford.

==Early military career==
Douglas was commissioned as a second lieutenant in the Royal Field Artillery on 15 August 1914. In January 1915, following a disagreement with his commanding officer, he transferred to the Royal Flying Corps joining No. 2 Squadron as an observer. He soon trained as a pilot and earned Royal Aero Club certificate No 1301. Promoted to lieutenant on 9 June 1915, he became a pilot with No. 14 Squadron at Shoreham in July 1915 and then transferred to No. 8 Squadron, flying B.E.2c aircraft on the Western Front, in August 1915. Appointed a flight commander with the rank of temporary captain in December 1915, he joined No. 18 Squadron at Montrose in January 1916. He was awarded the Military Cross on 14 January 1916.

Douglas went on to be officer commanding No. 43 Squadron, flying Sopwith 1½ Strutters on the Western Front, in April 1916 and, having been promoted to temporary major on 1 July 1916, he became then officer commanding No. 84 Squadron, flying S.E.5s on the Western Front, in August 1917. He was awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross on 8 February 1919.

After the war Douglas worked briefly for Handley Page and as a commercial pilot before rejoining the Royal Air Force in 1920 after a chance meeting with Hugh Trenchard. After being granted a permanent commission as a squadron leader on 25 March 1920, Douglas attended the RAF Staff College and then served as a flight instructor four years. Promoted to wing commander on 1 January 1925, he continued his work as an instructor before attending the Imperial Defence College in 1927. He became station commander at RAF North Weald in January 1928 and then joined the Air Staff at Headquarters Middle East Command in Khartoum in August 1929. Promoted to group captain on 1 January 1932, he became an instructor at the Imperial Defence College in June 1932 and then, having been promoted to air commodore on 1 January 1935, he became Director of Staff Duties at the Air Ministry on 1 January 1936. Promoted to air vice marshal on 1 January 1938, he went on to be Assistant Chief of the Air Staff on 17 February 1938.

==Second World War==
On 22 April 1940, with the Second World War well under way, he was made Deputy Chief of the Air Staff. He was appointed a Companion of the Order of the Bath on 11 July 1940. During 1940, Douglas and Trafford Leigh-Mallory clashed with the head of No. 11 Group, Keith Park, and the head of Fighter Command, Hugh Dowding, over strategy in the Battle of Britain. Douglas argued for a more aggressive engagement with a &#x27;Big Wing&#x27; strategy i.e. using massed fighters to defend the United Kingdom against enemy bombers. When Charles Portal was made Chief of the Air Staff in October 1940 he supported Douglas, moving Park and Dowding and appointing Douglas to replace Dowding as Air Officer Commanding-in-Chief of Fighter Command, with the temporary rank of air marshal on 25 November 1940. He was advanced to Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath on 1 July 1941 and promoted to the substantive rank of air marshal on 14 April 1942.

At around this time Prime Minister Winston Churchill recommended Douglas to command the China Burma India Theater but General George C. Marshall, the U.S. Army Chief of Staff, refused to accept the appointment due to Douglas&#x27;s well known dislike of Americans.

As commander-in-chief of Fighter Command, Douglas was responsible for rebuilding the command&#x27;s strength after the attrition of the Battle of Britain, but also for bringing it on the offensive to wrest the initiative in the air from the German &quot;Luftwaffe&quot;. He was therefore one of the main orchestrators of the only partially successful Circus offensive whereby large wings of fighters accompanied by bombers would take advantage of good weather to sweep over Northern France.

Douglas was promoted to temporary air chief marshal on 1 July 1942. On 28 November 1942 Douglas was replaced at Fighter Command by Trafford Leigh-Mallory and was transferred to Egypt, becoming Air Officer Commanding in Chief of RAF Middle East Command in January 1943. In that capacity Douglas was an advocate of Operation Accolade, a planned British amphibious assault on Rhodes and the Dodecanese Islands in the Aegean Sea, and was disappointed when it was abandoned.
Douglas returned to England in January 1944 to head Coastal Command during the invasion of Normandy and then, having been confirmed in the rank of air chief marshal on 6 June 1945, he became Commander in Chief, British Air Forces of Occupation in July 1945. He was advanced to Knight Grand Cross of the Order of the Bath on 1 January 1946.

Promoted to Marshal of the Royal Air Force on 1 January 1946, Douglas became the second commander of the British Zone of Occupation in Germany in May 1946. He was raised to the peerage as Baron Douglas of Kirtleside, of Dornock in the County of Dumfries on 17 February 1948, sitting as a member of the Labour Party. Douglas retired in 1947 and became chairman of BEA in 1949, a post he retained until 1964. He published two volumes of autobiography, &quot;Years of Combat&quot;, covering the First World War, and &quot;Years of Command&quot; covering the Second World War.

Douglas died in hospital in Northampton on 29 October 1969 and was buried at St Clement Danes in The Strand in London. He was an atheist.

==Family==
Lord Douglas of Kirtleside was married three times. First he married Beatrice May Hudd on 1 August 1919 at The Registry Office in Croydon, Surrey; they were childless and divorced in 1932. Secondly he married Joan Leslie (née Denny) in 1933; this marriage was also childless and ended in divorce in 1952. Thirdly he married Hazel Walker in 1955; they had one daughter.

<text>The emu (; Dromaius novaehollandiae) is a species of flightless bird endemic to Australia, where it is the tallest native bird. It is the only extant member of the genus &quot;Dromaius&quot; and the third-tallest living bird after its African ratite relatives, the common ostrich and Somali ostrich. The emu&#x27;s native ranges cover most of the Australian mainland. The Tasmanian, Kangaroo Island and King Island subspecies became extinct after the European settlement of Australia in 1788.

The emu has soft, brown feathers, a long neck, and long legs. It can grow up to in height. It is a robust bipedal runner that can travel great distances, and when necessary can sprint at . It is omnivorous and forages on a variety of plants and insects, and can go for weeks without eating. It drinks infrequently, but takes in copious amounts of fresh water when the opportunity arises.

Breeding takes place in May and June, and fighting among females for a mate is common. Females can mate several times and lay several clutches of eggs in one season. The male does the incubation; during this process he hardly eats or drinks and loses a significant amount of weight. The eggs hatch after around eight weeks, and the young are nurtured by their fathers. They reach full size after around six months, but can remain as a family unit until the next breeding season.

The emu is sufficiently common to be rated as a least-concern species by the International Union for Conservation of Nature. Despite this, some local populations are listed as endangered, with all the insular subspecies going extinct by the 1800s. Threats to their survival include egg predation by other animals (especially invasive species), roadkills and habitat fragmentation.

The emu is an important cultural icon of Australia, appearing on the coat of arms and various coinages. The bird features prominently in Indigenous Australian mythologies.

== Etymology ==
The etymology of the common name &quot;emu&quot; is uncertain, but is thought to have come from an Arabic word for large bird that was later used by Portuguese explorers to describe the related cassowary in Australia and New Guinea. Another theory is that it comes from the word &quot;ema&quot;, which is used in Portuguese to denote a large bird akin to an ostrich or crane. In Victoria, some terms for the emu were &quot;Barrimal&quot; in the Dja Dja Wurrung language, &quot;myoure&quot; in Gunai, and &quot;courn&quot; in Jardwadjali. The birds were known as &quot;murawung&quot; or &quot;birabayin&quot; to the local Eora and Darug inhabitants of the Sydney basin.

==Taxonomy==

===History===
Emus were first reported as having been seen by Europeans when explorers visited the western coast of Australia in 1696. This was during an expedition led by Dutch captain Willem de Vlamingh who was searching for survivors of a ship that had gone missing two years earlier. The birds were known on the eastern coast before 1788, when the first Europeans settled there. The birds were first mentioned under the name of the &quot;New Holland cassowary&quot; in Arthur Phillip&#x27;s &quot;Voyage to Botany Bay&quot;, published in 1789 with the following description:

The species was named by ornithologist John Latham in 1790 based on a specimen from the Sydney area of Australia, a country which was known as New Holland at the time. He collaborated on Phillip&#x27;s book and provided the first descriptions of, and names for, many Australian bird species; &quot;Dromaius&quot; comes from a Greek word meaning &quot;racer&quot; and &quot;novaehollandiae&quot; is the Latin term for New Holland, so the name can be rendered as &quot;fast-footed New Hollander&quot;. In his original 1816 description of the emu, the French ornithologist Louis Pierre Vieillot used two generic names, first &quot;Dromiceius&quot; and later &quot;Dromaius&quot;. It has been a point of contention ever since as to which name should be used; the latter is more correctly formed, but the convention in taxonomy is that the first name given to an organism stands, unless it is clearly a typographical error. Most modern publications, including those of the Australian government, use &quot;Dromaius&quot;, with &quot;Dromiceius&quot; mentioned as an alternative spelling.

===Systematics===
The emu was long classified, with its closest relatives the cassowaries, in the family Casuariidae, part of the ratite order Struthioniformes. An alternate classification was proposed in 2014 by Mitchell et al., based on analysis of mitochondrial DNA. This splits off the Casuariidae into their own order, the Casuariformes, and includes only the cassowaries in the family Casuariidae, placing the emus in their own family, Dromaiidae. The cladogram shown below is from their study.
Two different &quot;Dromaius&quot; species were present in Australia at the time of European settlement, and one additional species is known from fossil remains. The insular dwarf emus, &quot;D. n. baudinianus&quot; and &quot;D. n. minor&quot;, originally present on Kangaroo Island and King Island respectively, both became extinct shortly after the arrival of Europeans. &quot;D. n. diemenensis&quot;, another insular dwarf emu from Tasmania, became extinct around 1865. The mainland subspecies, &quot;D. n. novaehollandiae&quot;, remains common. The population of these birds varies from decade to decade, largely being dependent on rainfall; in 2009, it was estimated that there were between 630,000 and 725,000 birds. Emus were introduced to Maria Island off Tasmania, and Kangaroo Island off the coast of South Australia, during the 20th century. The Maria Island population died out in the mid-1990s. The Kangaroo Island birds have successfully established a breeding population.

In 1912, the Australian ornithologist Gregory M. Mathews recognised three living subspecies of emu, &quot;D. n. novaehollandiae&quot; (Latham, 1790), &quot;D. n. woodwardi&quot; Mathews, 1912 and &quot;D. n. rothschildi&quot; Mathews, 1912. The Handbook of the Birds of the World, however, argues that the last two of these subspecies are invalid; natural variations in plumage colour and the nomadic nature of the species make it likely that there is a single race in mainland Australia. Examination of the DNA of the King Island emu shows this bird to be closely related to the mainland emu and hence best treated as a subspecies.

== Description ==
The emu is the second tallest bird in the world, only being exceeded in height by the ostrich; the largest individuals can reach up to in height. Measured from the bill to the tail, emus range in length from , with males averaging and females averaging . Emus are the fourth or fifth heaviest living bird after the two species of ostrich and two larger species of cassowary, weighing slightly more on average than an emperor penguin. Adult emus weigh between , with an average of in males and females, respectively. Females are usually slightly larger than males and are substantially wider across the rump.

Although flightless, emus have vestigial wings, the wing chord measuring around , and each wing having a small claw at the tip. Emus flap their wings when running, perhaps as a means of stabilising themselves when moving fast. They have long necks and legs, and can run at speeds of due to their highly specialised pelvic limb musculature. Their feet have only three toes and a similarly reduced number of bones and associated foot muscles; emus are unique among birds in that their gastrocnemius muscles in the back of the lower legs have four bellies instead of the usual three. The pelvic limb muscles of emus contribute a similar proportion of the total body mass as do the flight muscles of flying birds. When walking, the emu takes strides of about , but at full gallop, a stride can be as long as . Its legs are devoid of feathers and underneath its feet are thick, cushioned pads. Like the cassowary, the emu has sharp claws on its toes which are its major defensive attribute, and are used in combat to inflict wounds on opponents by kicking. The toe and claw total in length. The bill is quite small, measuring , and is soft, being adapted for grazing. Emus have good eyesight and hearing, which allows them to detect threats at some distance.

The neck of the emu is pale blue and shows through its sparse feathers. They have grey-brown plumage of shaggy appearance; the shafts and the tips of the feathers are black. Solar radiation is absorbed by the tips, and the inner plumage insulates the skin. This prevents the birds from overheating, allowing them to be active during the heat of the day. A unique feature of the emu feather is the double rachis emerging from a single shaft. Both of the rachis have the same length, and the texture is variable; the area near the skin is rather furry, but the more distant ends resemble grass. The sexes are similar in appearance, although the male&#x27;s penis can become visible when he urinates and defecates. The plumage varies in colour due to environmental factors, giving the bird a natural camouflage. Feathers of emus in more arid areas with red soils have a rufous tint while birds residing in damp conditions are generally darker in hue. The juvenile plumage develops at about three months and is blackish finely barred with brown, with the head and neck being especially dark. The facial feathers gradually thin to expose the bluish skin. The adult plumage has developed by about fifteen months.

The eyes of an emu are protected by nictitating membranes. These are translucent, secondary eyelids that move horizontally from the inside edge of the eye to the outside edge. They function as visors to protect the eyes from the dust that is prevalent in windy arid regions. Emus have a tracheal pouch, which becomes more prominent during the mating season. At more than in length, it is quite spacious; it has a thin wall, and an opening long.

==Distribution and habitat==
Once common on the east coast of Australia, emus are now uncommon there; by contrast, the development of agriculture and the provision of water for stock in the interior of the continent have increased the range of the emu in arid regions. Emus live in various habitats across Australia both inland and near the coast. They are most common in areas of savannah woodland and sclerophyll forest, and least common in heavily populated districts and arid areas with annual precipitation of less than . Emus predominantly travel in pairs, and while they can form large flocks, this is an atypical social behaviour that arises from the common need to move towards a new food source. Emus have been shown to travel long distances to reach abundant feeding areas. In Western Australia, emu movements follow a distinct seasonal pattern – north in summer and south in winter. On the east coast their wanderings seem to be more random and do not appear to follow a set pattern.

== Behaviour and ecology ==
Emus are diurnal birds and spend their day foraging, preening their plumage with their beak, dust bathing and resting. They are generally gregarious birds apart from the breeding season, and while some forage, others remain vigilant to their mutual benefit. They are able to swim when necessary, although they rarely do so unless the area is flooded or they need to cross a river.

Emus begin to settle down at sunset and sleep during the night. They do not sleep continuously but rouse themselves several times during the night. When falling asleep, emus first squat on their tarsi and enter a drowsy state during which they are alert enough to react to stimuli and quickly return to a fully awakened state if disturbed. As they fall into deeper sleep, their neck droops closer to the body and the eyelids begin to close. If there are no disturbances, they fall into a deeper sleep after about twenty minutes. During this phase, the body is gradually lowered until it is touching the ground with the legs folded underneath. The beak is turned down so that the whole neck becomes S-shaped and folded onto itself. The feathers direct any rain downwards onto the ground. It has been suggested that the sleeping position is a type of camouflage, mimicking a small mound. Emus typically awake from deep sleep once every ninety minutes or so and stand upright to feed briefly or defecate. This period of wakefulness lasts for ten to twenty minutes, after which they return to slumber. Overall, an emu sleeps for around seven hours in each twenty-four-hour period. Young emus usually sleep with their neck flat and stretched forward along the ground surface.


The vocalisations of emus mostly consist of various booming and grunting sounds. The booming is created by the inflatable throat pouch; the pitch can be regulated by the bird and depends on the size of the aperture. Most of the booming is done by females; it is part of the courtship ritual, is used to announce the holding of territory and is issued as a threat to rivals. A high-intensity boom is audible away, while a low, more resonant call, produced during the breeding season, may at first attract mates and peaks while the male is incubating the eggs. Most of the grunting is done by males. It is used principally during the breeding season in territorial defence, as a threat to other males, during courtship and while the female is laying. Both sexes sometimes boom or grunt during threat displays or on encountering strange objects.

On very hot days, emus pant to maintain their body temperature. Their lungs work as evaporative coolers and, unlike some other species, the resulting low levels of carbon dioxide in the blood do not appear to cause alkalosis. For normal breathing in cooler weather, they have large, multifolded nasal passages. Cool air warms as it passes through into the lungs, extracting heat from the nasal region. On exhalation, the emu&#x27;s cold nasal turbinates condense moisture back out of the air and absorb it for reuse. As with other ratites, the emu has great homeothermic ability, and can maintain this status from . The thermoneutral zone of emus lies between .

As with other ratites, emus have a relatively low basal metabolic rate compared to other types of birds. At , the metabolic rate of an emu sitting down is about 60% of that when standing, partly because the lack of feathers under the stomach leads to a higher rate of heat loss when standing from the exposed underbelly.

=== Diet ===
Emus forage in a diurnal pattern and eat a variety of native and introduced plant species. The diet depends on seasonal availability with such plants as &quot;Acacia&quot;, &quot;Casuarina&quot; and grasses being favoured. They also eat insects and other arthropods, including grasshoppers and crickets, beetles, cockroaches, ladybirds, bogong and cotton-boll moth larvae, ants, spiders and millipedes. This provides a large part of their protein requirements. In Western Australia, food preferences have been observed in travelling emus; they eat seeds from &quot;Acacia aneura&quot; until the rains arrive, after which they move on to fresh grass shoots and caterpillars; in winter they feed on the leaves and pods of &quot;Cassia&quot; and in spring, they consume grasshoppers and the fruit of &quot;Santalum acuminatum&quot;, a sort of quandong. They are also known to feed on wheat, and any fruit or other crops that they can access, easily climbing over high fences if necessary. Emus serve as an important agent for the dispersal of large viable seeds, which contributes to floral biodiversity. One undesirable effect of this occurred in Queensland in the early twentieth century when emus fed on the fruit of prickly pears in the outback. They defecated the seeds in various places as they moved around, and this led to a series of campaigns to hunt emus and prevent the seeds of the invasive cactus being spread. The cacti were eventually controlled by an introduced moth (&quot;Cactoblastis cactorum&quot;) whose larvae fed on the plant, one of the earliest examples of biological control. The δC of the emu&#x27;s diet is reflected in the δC of the calcite of its egg shell.

Small stones are swallowed to assist in the grinding up and digestion of the plant material. Individual stones may weigh and the birds may have as much as in their gizzards at one time. They also eat charcoal, although the reason for this is unclear. Captive emus have been known to eat shards of glass, marbles, car keys, jewellery and nuts and bolts.

Emus drink infrequently but ingest large amounts when the opportunity arises. They typically drink once a day, first inspecting the water body and surrounding area in groups before kneeling down at the edge to drink. They prefer being on firm ground while drinking, rather than on rocks or mud, but if they sense danger, they often stand rather than kneel. If not disturbed, they may drink continuously for ten minutes. Due to the scarcity of water sources, emus are sometimes forced to go without water for several days. In the wild, they often share water holes with other animals such as kangaroos; they are wary and tend to wait for the other animals to leave before drinking.

=== Breeding ===
Emus form breeding pairs during the summer months of December and January and may remain together for about five months. During this time, they stay in an area a few kilometres in diameter and it is believed they find and defend territory within this area. Both males and females put on weight during the breeding season, with the female becoming slightly heavier at between . Mating usually takes place between April and June; the exact timing is determined by the climate as the birds nest during the coolest part of the year. During the breeding season, males experience hormonal changes, including an increase in luteinising hormone and testosterone levels, and their testicles double in size.

Males construct a rough nest in a semi-sheltered hollow on the ground, using bark, grass, sticks and leaves to line it. The nest is almost always a flat surface rather than a segment of a sphere, although in cold conditions the nest is taller, up to tall, and more spherical to provide some extra heat retention. When other material is lacking, the bird sometimes uses a spinifex tussock a metre or so across, despite the prickly nature of the foliage. The nest can be placed on open ground or near a shrub or rock. The nest is usually placed in an area where the emu has a clear view of its surroundings and can detect approaching predators. The nest can contain eggs from multiple emus the number is usually between 15 and 25 eggs.

Female emus court the males; the female&#x27;s plumage darkens slightly and the small patches of bare, featherless skin just below the eyes and near the beak turn turquoise-blue. The colour of the male&#x27;s plumage remains unchanged, although the bare patches of skin also turn light blue. When courting, females stride around, pulling their neck back while puffing out their feathers and emitting low, monosyllabic calls that have been compared to drum beats. This calling can occur when males are out of sight or more than away. Once the male&#x27;s attention has been gained, the female circles her prospective mate at a distance of . As she does this, she looks at him by turning her neck, while at the same time keeping her rump facing towards him. If the male shows interest in the parading female, he will move closer; the female continues the courtship by shuffling further away but continuing to circle him.

If a male is interested, he will stretch his neck and erect his feathers, then bend over and peck at the ground. He will circle around and sidle up to the female, swaying his body and neck from side to side, and rubbing his breast against his partner&#x27;s rump. Often the female will reject his advances with aggression, but if amenable, she signals acceptance by squatting down and raising her rump.

Females are more aggressive than males during the courtship period, often fighting for access to mates, with fights among females accounting for more than half the aggressive interactions during this period. If females court a male that already has a partner, the incumbent female will try to repel the competitor, usually by chasing and kicking. These interactions can be prolonged, lasting up to five hours, especially when the male being fought over is single and neither female has the advantage of incumbency. In these cases, the females typically intensify their calls and displays.

The sperm from a mating is stored by the female and can suffice to fertilise about six eggs. The pair mate every day or two, and every second or third day the female lays one of a clutch of five to fifteen very large, thick-shelled, green eggs. The shell is around thick, but rather thinner in northern regions according to indigenous Australians. The shell is substantially composed of calcite, and its δC is a function of the emu&#x27;s diet. The eggs are on average and weigh between . The maternal investment in the egg is considerable, and the proportion of yolk to albumen, at about 50%, is greater than would be predicted for a precocial egg of this size. This probably relates to the long incubation period which means the developing chick must consume greater resources before hatching. The first verified occurrence of genetically identical avian twins was demonstrated in the emu. The egg surface is granulated and pale green. During the incubation period, the egg turns dark green, although if the egg never hatches, it will turn white from the bleaching effect of the sun.

The male becomes broody after his mate starts laying, and may begin to incubate the eggs before the clutch is complete. From this time on, he does not eat, drink, or defecate, and stands only to turn the eggs, which he does about ten times a day. He develops a brood patch, a bare area of wrinkled skin which is in intimate contact with the eggs. Over the course of the eight-week incubation period, he will lose a third of his weight and will survive on stored body fat and on any morning dew that he can reach from the nest. As with many other Australian birds, such as the superb fairywren, infidelity is the norm for emus, despite the initial pair bond: once the male starts brooding, the female usually wanders off, and may mate with other males and lay in multiple nests; thus, as many as half the chicks in a brood may not be fathered by the incubating male, or even by either parent, as emus also exhibit brood parasitism.

Some females stay and defend the nest until the chicks start hatching, but most leave the nesting area completely to nest again; in a good season, a female emu may nest three times. If the parents stay together during the incubation period, they will take turns standing guard over the eggs while the other drinks and feeds within earshot. If it perceives a threat during this period, it will lie down on top of the nest and try to blend in with the similar-looking surrounds, and suddenly stand up to confront and scare the other party if it comes close.

Incubation takes 56 days, and the male stops incubating the eggs shortly before they hatch. The temperature of the nest rises slightly during the eight-week period. Although the eggs are laid sequentially, they tend to hatch within two days of one another, as the eggs that were laid later experienced higher temperatures and developed more rapidly. During the process, the precocial emu chicks need to develop a capacity for thermoregulation. During incubation, the embryos are kept at a constant temperature but the chicks will need to be able to cope with varying external temperatures by the time they hatch.

Newly hatched chicks are active and can leave the nest within a few days of hatching. They stand about tall at first, weigh , and have distinctive brown and cream stripes for camouflage, which fade after three months or so. The male guards the growing chicks for up to seven months, teaching them how to find food. Chicks grow very quickly and are fully grown in five to six months; they may remain with their family group for another six months or so before they split up to breed in their second season. During their early life, the young emus are defended by their father, who adopts a belligerent stance towards other emus, including the mother. He does this by ruffling his feathers, emitting sharp grunts, and kicking his legs to drive off other animals. He can also bend his knees to crouch over smaller chicks to protect them. At night, he envelops his young with his feathers. As the young emus cannot travel far, the parents must choose an area with plentiful food in which to breed. In the wild, emus can live for upwards of 10 years but in captivity, they can live up to 20 years.

=== Predation ===
There are few native natural predators of adult emus still extant. Early in its species history it may have faced numerous terrestrial predators now extinct, including the giant lizard &quot;Megalania&quot;, the thylacine, and possibly other carnivorous marsupials, which may explain their seemingly well-developed ability to defend themselves from terrestrial predators. The main predator of emus today is the dingo, which was originally introduced by Aboriginals thousands of years ago from a stock of semi-domesticated wolves. Dingoes try to kill the emu by attacking the head. The emu typically tries to repel the dingo by jumping into the air and kicking or stamping the dingo on its way down. The emu jumps as the dingo barely has the capacity to jump high enough to threaten its neck, so a correctly timed leap to coincide with the dingo&#x27;s lunge can keep its head and neck out of danger. Despite the potential prey-predator relationship, the presence of predaceous dingoes does not appear to heavily influence emu numbers, with other natural conditions just as likely to cause mortality. Wedge-tailed eagles are the only avian predator capable of attacking fully-grown emus, though are perhaps most likely to take small or young specimens. The eagles attack emus by swooping downwards rapidly and at high speed and aiming for the head and neck. In this case, the emu&#x27;s jumping technique as employed against the dingo is not useful. The birds try to target the emu in the open ground so that it cannot hide behind obstacles. Under such circumstances, the emu runs in a chaotic manner and changes directions frequently to try to evade its attacker. While full-grown adults are rarely preyed upon, dingos, raptors, monitor lizards, introduced red foxes, feral and domestic dogs, and feral pigs occasionally feed on emu eggs or kill small chicks. Adult males fiercely defend their chicks from predators, especially dingos and foxes.

===Parasites===
Emus can suffer from both external and internal parasites, but under farmed conditions are more parasite-free than ostriches or rheas. External parasites include the louse &quot;Dahlemhornia asymmetrica&quot; and various other lice, ticks, mites and flies. Chicks sometimes suffer from intestinal tract infections caused by coccidian protozoa, and the nematode &quot;Trichostrongylus tenuis&quot; infects the emu as well as a wide range of other birds, causing haemorrhagic diarrhoea. Other nematodes are found in the trachea and bronchi; &quot;Syngamus trachea&quot; causing haemorrhagic tracheitis and &quot;Cyathostoma variegatum&quot; causing serious respiratory problems in juveniles.

== Relationship with humans ==

Emus were used as a source of food by indigenous Australians and early European settlers. Emus are inquisitive birds and have been known to approach humans if they see unexpected movement of a limb or piece of clothing. In the wild, they may follow and observe people. Aboriginal Australians used a variety of techniques to catch the birds, including spearing them while they drank at waterholes, catching them in nets, and attracting them by imitating their calls or by arousing their curiosity with a ball of feathers and rags dangled from a tree. The pitchuri thornapple (&quot;Duboisia hopwoodii&quot;), or some similar poisonous plant, could be used to contaminate a waterhole, after which the disoriented emus were easy to catch. Another stratagem was for the hunter to use a skin as a disguise, and the birds could be lured into a camouflaged pit trap using rags or imitation calls. Aboriginal Australians only killed emus out of necessity, and frowned on anyone who hunted them for any other reason. Every part of the carcass had some use; the fat was harvested for its valuable, multiple-use oil, the bones were shaped into knives and tools, the feathers were used for body adornment and the tendons substituted for string.

The early European settlers killed emus to provide food and used their fat for fuelling lamps. They also tried to prevent them from interfering with farming or invading settlements in search of water during drought. An extreme example of this was the Emu War in Western Australia in 1932. Emus flocked to the Chandler and Walgoolan area during a dry spell, damaging rabbit fencing and devastating crops. An attempt to drive them off was mounted, with the army called in to dispatch them with machine guns; the emus largely avoided the hunters. Emus are large, powerful birds, and their legs are among the strongest of any animal and powerful enough to tear down metal fencing. The birds are very defensive of their young, and there have been two documented cases of humans being attacked by emus.

=== Economic value ===
In the areas in which it was endemic, the emu was an important source of meat to Aboriginal Australians. They used the fat as bush medicine and rubbed it into their skin. It served as a valuable lubricant, was used to oil wooden tools and utensils such as the coolamon, and was mixed with ochre to make the traditional paint for ceremonial body adornment. Their eggs were also foraged for food.

An example of how the emu was cooked comes from the Arrernte of Central Australia who called it &quot;Kere ankerre&quot;:

The birds were a food and fuel source for early European settlers, and are now farmed, in Australia and elsewhere, for their meat, oil and leather. Commercial emu farming started in Western Australia around 1970. The commercial industry in the country is based on stock bred in captivity, and all states except Tasmania have licensing requirements to protect wild emus. Outside Australia, emus are farmed on a large scale in North America, with about 1 million birds in the US, Peru, and China, and to a lesser extent in some other countries. Emus breed well in captivity, and are kept in large open pens to avoid the leg and digestive problems that arise from inactivity. They are typically fed on grain supplemented by grazing, and are slaughtered at 15 to 18 months.

The Salem district administration in India advised farmers in 2012 not to invest in the emu business which was being heavily promoted at the time; further investigation was needed to assess the profitability of farming the birds in India. In the United States, it was reported in 2013 that many ranchers had left the emu business; it was estimated that the number of growers had dropped from over five thousand in 1998 to one or two thousand in 2013. The remaining growers increasingly rely on sales of oil for their profit, although, leather, eggs, and meat are also sold.

Emus are farmed primarily for their meat, leather, feathers and oil, and 95% of the carcass can be used. Emu meat is a low-fat product (less than 1.5% fat), and is comparable to other lean meats. Most of the usable portions (the best cuts come from the thigh and the larger muscles of the drum or lower leg) are, like other poultry, dark meat; emu meat is considered for cooking purposes by the US Food and Drug Administration to be a red meat because its red colour and pH value approximate that of beef, but for inspection purposes it is considered to be poultry.
Emu fat is rendered to produce oil for cosmetics, dietary supplements, and therapeutic products. The oil is obtained from the subcutaneous and retroperitoneal fat; the macerated adipose tissue is heated and the liquefied fat is filtered to get a clear oil. This consists mainly of fatty acids of which oleic acid (42%), linoleic and palmitic acids (21% each) are the most prominent components. It also contains various anti-oxidants, notably carotenoids and flavones.

There is some evidence that the oil has anti-inflammatory properties; however, there have not yet been extensive tests, and the USDA regards pure emu oil as an unapproved drug and highlighted it in a 2009 article entitled &quot;How to Spot Health Fraud&quot;. Nevertheless, the oil has been linked to the easing of gastrointestinal inflammation, and tests on rats have shown that it has a significant effect in treating arthritis and joint pain, more so than olive or fish oils. It has been scientifically shown to improve the rate of wound healing, but the mechanism responsible for this effect is not understood. A 2008 study has claimed that emu oil has a better anti-oxidative and anti-inflammatory potential than ostrich oil, and linked this to emu oil&#x27;s higher proportion of unsaturated to saturated fatty acids. While there are no scientific studies showing that emu oil is effective in humans, it is marketed and promoted as a dietary supplement with a wide variety of claimed health benefits. Commercially marketed emu oil supplements are poorly standardised.

Emu leather has a distinctive patterned surface, due to a raised area around the feather follicles in the skin; the leather is used in such items as wallets, handbags, shoes and clothes, often in combination with other leathers. The feathers and eggs are used in decorative arts and crafts. In particular, emptied emu eggs have been engraved with portraits, similar to cameos, and scenes of Australian native animals. Mounted Emu eggs and emu-egg containers in the form of hundreds of goblets, inkstands and vases were produced in the second half of the nineteenth century, all richly embellished with images of Australian flora, fauna and indigenous people by travelling silversmiths, founders of a &#x27;new Australian grammar of ornament&#x27;. They continued longstanding traditions that can be traced back to the European mounted ostrich eggs of the thirteenth century and Christian symbolism and notions of virginity, fertility, faith and strength. For a society of proud settlers who sought to bring culture and civilisation to their new world, the traditional ostrich-egg goblet, freed from its roots in a society dominated by court culture, was creatively made novel in the Australian colonies as forms and functions were invented to make the objects attractive to a new, broader audience. Significant designers Adolphus Blau, Julius Hogarth, Ernest Leviny, Julius Schomburgk, Johann Heinrich Steiner, Christian Quist, Joachim Matthias Wendt, William Edwards and others had the technical training on which to build flourishing businesses in a country rich in raw materials and a clientele hungry for old-world paraphernalia.

In addition to their use in farming, emus are sometimes kept as pets, though they require adequate space and food in order to live healthily. Emus were formerly subject to regulation in the United Kingdom under the Dangerous Wild Animals Act; however, a review of the act in 2007 led to changes that allow emus (alongside a number of other animals that were also regulated under the act) to be kept without a license, as they were no longer considered to be dangerous.

=== Cultural references ===
The emu has a prominent place in Australian Aboriginal mythology, including a creation myth of the Yuwaalaraay and other groups in New South Wales who say that the sun was made by throwing an emu&#x27;s egg into the sky; the bird features in numerous aetiological stories told across a number of Aboriginal groups. One story from Western Australia holds that a man once annoyed a small bird, who responded by throwing a boomerang, severing the arms of the man and transforming him into a flightless emu. The Kurdaitcha man of Central Australia is said to wear sandals made of emu feathers to mask his footprints. Many Aboriginal language groups throughout Australia have a tradition that the dark dust lanes in the Milky Way represent a giant emu in the sky. Several of the Sydney rock engravings depict emus, and the birds are mimicked in Indigenous dances. Hunting emus, known as &quot;kari&quot; in the Kaurna language, features in the major Dreaming story of the Kaurna people of the Adelaide region about the ancestor hero Tjilbruke.

The emu is popularly but Unofficially considered as a faunal emblem – the national bird of Australia. It appears as a shield bearer on the Coat of arms of Australia with the red kangaroo, and as a part of the Arms also appears on the Australian 50-cent coin. It has featured on numerous Australian postage stamps, including a pre-federation New South Wales 100th Anniversary issue from 1888, which featured a 2 pence blue emu stamp, a 36-cent stamp released in 1986, and a $1.35 stamp released in 1994. The hats of the Australian Light Horse are decorated with emu feather plumes.

Trademarks of early Australian companies using the emu included Webbenderfer Bros frame mouldings (1891), Mac Robertson Chocolate and Cocoa (1893), Dyason and Son Emu Brand Cordial Sauce (1894), James Allard Pottery Wares (1906), and rope manufacturers G. Kinnear and Sons Pty. Ltd. still use it on some of their products.

There are around six hundred gazetted places in Australia with &quot;emu&quot; in their title, including mountains, lakes, hills, plains, creeks and waterholes. During the 19th and 20th centuries, many Australian companies and household products were named after the bird. In Western Australia, Emu beer has been produced since the early 20th century and the Swan Brewery continues to produce a range of beers branded as &quot;Emu&quot;. The quarterly peer-reviewed journal of the Royal Australasian Ornithologists Union, also known as Birds Australia, is entitled &quot;Emu: Austral Ornithology&quot;.

The comedian Rod Hull featured a wayward emu puppet in his act for many years and the bird returned to the small screen in the hands of his son Toby after the puppeteer&#x27;s death in 1999. In 2019, American insurance company Liberty Mutual launched an advertising campaign that features LiMu Emu, a CGI-rendered emu.

Another popular Emu on social media is Emmanuel, a resident of Knuckle Bump Farms in south Florida. Taylor Blake, the farm&#x27;s owner, since 2013 has recorded video shorts explaining aspects of the farm and is often interrupted as Emmanuel the Emu photobombs her videos earning constant rebukes; the term &quot;Emmanuel don&#x27;t do it!&quot; has become popular on social media.

== Status and conservation ==
In John Gould&#x27;s &quot;Handbook to the Birds of Australia&quot;, first published in 1865, he lamented the loss of the emu from Tasmania, where it had become rare and has since become extinct; he noted that emus were no longer common in the vicinity of Sydney and proposed that the species be given protected status. In the 1930s, emu killings in Western Australia peaked at 57,000, and culls were also mounted in Queensland during this period due to rampant crop damage. In the 1960s, bounties were still being paid in Western Australia for killing emus, but since then, wild emus have been granted formal protection under the &quot;Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999&quot;. Their occurrence range is between , and a 1992 census suggested that their total population was between 630,000 and 725,000. Their population trend is thought to be stable and the International Union for Conservation of Nature assesses their conservation status as being of least concern. The isolated emu population of the New South Wales North Coast Bioregion and Port Stephens is listed as endangered by the New South Wales Government.

Although the population of emus on mainland Australia is thought to be higher now than it was before European settlement, some local populations are at risk of extinction. The threats faced by emus include the clearance and fragmentation of areas of suitable habitat, deliberate slaughter, collisions with vehicles and predation of the eggs and young.

<doc id="76896" wikidata="Q223663" url="?curid=76896" title="Bornholm disease">
<text>Bornholm disease, also known as epidemic pleurodynia, is a condition characterized by myositis of the abdomen or chest caused by the Coxsackie B virus or other viruses. The myositis manifests as an intermittent stabbing pain in the musculature that is seen primarily in children and young adults.

It is named after the Danish island of Bornholm in the Baltic Sea where an outbreak was one of the first to be described.

==Signs and symptoms==
The expected symptoms of Bornholm disease include fever, pleuritic chest pain, or epigastric abdominal pain that is frequently spasmodic. Bornholm associated chest pain is distinguished by attacks of severe pain in the lower chest, often on the right side. In a prior study, the episodes were shown to last five to ten minutes and then subside for thirty minutes. The pain is exacerbated by movement and makes walking and breathing more difficult. Patients have found relief from the pain by lying still for a brief period of time. The slightest movement of the rib cage causes a sharp increase in pain, which makes it difficult to breathe, although it generally passes off before any actual harm occurs. The attacks are unpredictable and strike &quot;out of the blue&quot; with a feeling like an iron grip around the rib cage. The colloquial names for the disease, such as &quot;the devil&#x27;s grip&quot;, (see &quot;other names&quot; below) reflect this symptom. Bornholm disease is a clinical diagnosis that uses the spasmodic pain, fever, and relapses to distinguish the illness from other potential causes of pain such as appendicitis or myocardial infarction. Tachycardia and arrhythmias have been found with Bornholm disease by using an electrocardiogram (ECG). Murmurs, rubs, and pericardial effusions have been detected on physical examination. Maculopapular rashes can also be present with Bornholm disease 

==Etiology==
Inoculation of throat washings taken from people with this disease into the brains of newborn mice revealed that enteroviruses in the Coxsackie B virus group were likely to be the cause of pleurodynia, and those findings were supported by subsequent studies of IgM antibody responses measured in serum from people with pleurodynia. Other viruses in the enterovirus family, including echovirus and Coxsackie A virus, are less frequently associated with pleurodynia. Echovirus types 1,6,8,9, and 19 and Coxsackie A virus types 4,6,9, and 10 are associated with Bornholm disease. The most common strains causing Bornholm disease are Coxsackie B3 and A9. Viral proliferation in the muscles of the chest wall, diaphragm, and abdomen are thought to contribute to the typical presentation that characterizes the illness.

==Epidemiology==
The most common cause of Bornholm disease, Coxsackie B virus, is shed in large amounts in the feces of infected persons and is spread primarily through the fecal-oral route. Respiratory secretions and oral-oral methods have also shown to be modes of transmission. In previous cases the disease has been spread by sharing drink containers, and has been contracted by laboratory personnel working with the virus.
The pharynx is typically the initial site for entering the body, however the virus will proliferate in lymphatic tissues and use the blood stream to reach the muscles and produce symptoms. Preventative measures to decrease transmission of the virus causing Bornholm disease emphasize hand hygiene. In previous studies of Bornholm disease the majority of the patients affected were children.

==Physical exam findings==
In a studied case of Bornholm disease the chest pain was unable to be reproduced on palpation and failed to improve with changes in position. The pain was made worse during deep inhalation. A pleural rub was present, however lung auscultation was clear and rashes were absent.

==Laboratory findings and imaging==
In a prior case of Bornholm disease the laboratory results showed the white blood cell count, hemoglobin, hematocrit, creatinine, liver function test (LFT), troponin, and creatine kinase (CK) were all within normal limits. The chest x-ray showed bilateral pleural effusions which resolved after infection. The erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and C-reactive protein (CRP) levels were found to be elevated. The electrocardiogram (EKG) did not show any abnormalities related to ischemia.

==Treatment and prognosis==
Treatment is symptomatic and includes the administration of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents or the application of heat to the affected muscles. Intercostal 2% xylocaine injections with normal saline have been used to relieve symptoms in certain cases. Relapses during the weeks following the initial episode are a characteristic feature of this disease. Bornholm disease typically lasts between one day and one week with an average illness duration of four days. In 20% of cases studied, the illness lasted between one and two weeks. The illness in children was found to be shorter than the illness in adults. Patients typically make a complete recovery with supportive care. Although recovering from Bornholm disease is expected, some rare complications include myocarditis, respiratory failure, hepatic necrosis with coagulopathy, and disseminated intravascular coagulopathy (DIC). Aseptic meningitis, pericarditis and pleurisy are also known potential complications of Bornholm disease. Another uncommon complication is orchitis that manifests as unilateral testicular pain and swelling in the days or weeks following the expected symptoms of Bornholm disease.

==Differential diagnoses==
Acute appendicitis, cholecystitis, pancreatitis, pulmonary embolism, acute coronary syndrome, costochondritis, amongst others

==History==
In 1872, Anders Daae and Christian Horrebow Homann reported an epidemic of pleurodynia occurring in the community of Bamble, Norway, giving rise to the name &quot;Bamble disease&quot;. Subsequent reports, published only in Norwegian, referred to the disease by this name. Niels Ryberg Finsen also described the disease in Iceland in 1874. In 1933, Ejnar Sylvest gave a doctoral thesis describing a Danish outbreak of this disease on Bornholm Island entitled &quot;Bornholm disease-myalgia epidemica&quot;, and this name has persisted. In 1949 the Coxsackie B virus was isolated and established as an etiology of Bornholm disease.

==Other names==
Bornholm disease is also known as Bamble disease, the devil&#x27;s grip, devil&#x27;s grippe, epidemic myalgia, epidemic pleurodynia.

==Etymology==
The genus &quot;Nicotiana&quot; (from which the word &quot;nicotine&quot; is derived) was named in honor of Jean Nicot, French ambassador to Portugal, who in 1559 sent samples as a medicine to the court of Catherine de&#x27; Medici.

==Ecology==


Despite containing enough nicotine and/or other compounds such as germacrene and anabasine and other piperidine alkaloids (varying between species) to deter most herbivores, a number of such animals have evolved the ability to feed on &quot;Nicotiana&quot; species without being harmed. Nonetheless, tobacco is unpalatable to many species and therefore some tobacco plants (mainly tree tobacco (&quot;N. glauca&quot;)) have become established as invasive species in some places.

In the 19th century, young tobacco plantings came under increasing attack from flea beetles (particularly the potato flea beetle (&quot;Epitrix cucumeris&quot;) and/or &quot;Epitrix pubescens&quot;), causing the destruction of half the United States tobacco crop in 1876. In the years afterward, many experiments were attempted and discussed to control the potato flea beetle. By 1880, it was discovered that covering young plants with a frame covered with thin fabric (instead of with branches, as had previously been used for frost control) would effectively protect the plants from the beetle. This practice spread until it became ubiquitous in the 1890s.

Tobacco, alongside its related products, can be infested by parasites such as the tobacco beetle (&quot;Lasioderma serricorne&quot;) and the tobacco moth (&quot;Ephestia elutella&quot;), which are the most widespread and damaging pests in the tobacco industry. Infestation can range from the tobacco cultivated in the fields to the leaves used for manufacturing cigars, cigarillos, cigarettes, chewing tobacco, dipping tobacco, snuff, snus, etc. Both the grubs of &quot;Lasioderma serricorne&quot; and the caterpillars of &quot;Ephestia elutella&quot; are considered major pests.

Other moths whose caterpillars feed on &quot;Nicotiana&quot; include:
* Black cutworm, greasy cutworm, or floodplain cutworm (as a caterpillar), dark sword-grass or ipsilon dart (as a moth) (&quot;Agrotis ipsilon&quot;)
* Turnip moth (&quot;Agrotis segetum&quot;)
* Mouse moth (&quot;Amphipyra tragopoginis&quot;)
* Clover cutworm (as a caterpillar), nutmeg (as a moth) (&quot;Hadula trifolii&quot; or &quot;Anarta trifolii&quot;)
* &quot;Endoclita excrescens&quot;
* Hawaiian tobacco hornworm or Hawaiian tomato hornworm (as a caterpillar), Blackburn&#x27;s sphinx moth (as a moth) (&quot;Manduca blackburni&quot;)

==Cultivation==
Several species of &quot;Nicotiana&quot;, such as &quot;N. sylvestris&quot;, &quot;N. alata&quot; &#x27;Lime Green&#x27; and &quot;N. langsdorffii&quot; are grown as ornamental plants, often under the name of flowering tobacco. They are popular vespertines (evening bloomers); their sweet-smelling flowers opening in the evening to be visited by hawkmoths and other pollinators. In temperate climates, they behave as annuals (hardiness 9a–11).
The hybrid cultivar &#x27;Lime Green&#x27; has gained the Royal Horticultural Society&#x27;s Award of Garden Merit.

Garden varieties are derived from &quot;N. alata&quot; (e.g., the &#x27;Niki&#x27; and &#x27;Saratoga&#x27; series) and more recently from &quot;Nicotiana&quot; × &quot;sanderae&quot; (e.g., the &#x27;Perfume&#x27; and &#x27;Domino&#x27; series).

The tobacco budworm (&quot;Chloridea virescens&quot;) has proved to be a massive &quot;pest&quot; of many species in the genus, and has resisted many attempts at management.
