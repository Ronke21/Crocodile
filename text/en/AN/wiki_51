<doc id="79829" wikidata="Q367377" url="?curid=79829" title="Hipponax">
<text>Hipponax (; &quot;gen&quot;. Ἱππώνακτος; ), of Ephesus and later Clazomenae, was an Ancient Greek iambic poet who composed verses depicting the vulgar side of life in Ionian society. He was celebrated by ancient authors for his malicious wit, especially for his attacks on some contemporary sculptors, Bupalus and Athenis. Hipponax was reputed to be physically deformed, which might have been inspired by the nature of his poetry.

==Life==
Ancient authorities record the barest details about his life (sometimes contradicting each other) and his extant poetry is too fragmentary to support autobiographical interpretation (a hazardous exercise even at the best of times).

The Marmor Parium, only partially preserved in the relevant place, dates him to 541/40 BC, a date supported by Pliny the Elder in this comment on the theme of sculpture:

Archeological corroboration for these dates is found on the pedestal of a statue in Delos, inscribed with the names Micciades and Achermus and dated to 550–30 BC. The poet therefore can be safely dated to the second half of the sixth century BC. According to Athenaeus, he was small, thin and surprisingly strong The Byzantine encyclopaedia &quot;Suda&quot;, recorded that he was expelled from Ephesus by the tyrants Athenagoras and Comas, then settled in Clazomenae, and that he wrote verses satirising Bupalus and Athenis because they made insulting likenesses of him. A scholiast commenting on Horace&#x27;s &quot;Epodes&quot; recorded two differing accounts of the dispute with Bupalus, characterized however as &quot;a painter in Clazomenae&quot;: Hipponax sought to marry Bupalus&#x27;s daughter but was rejected &quot;because&quot; of his physical ugliness, and Bupalus portrayed him as ugly &quot;in order&quot; to provoke laughter. According to the same scholiast, Hipponax retaliated in verse so savagely that Bupalus hanged himself.
Hipponax in that case closely resembles Archilochus of Paros, an earlier iambic poet, who reportedly drove a certain Lycambes and his daughters to hang themselves after he too was rejected in marriage. Such a coincidence invites scepticism. The comic poet Diphilus took the similarity between the two iambic poets even further, representing them as rival lovers of the poet Sappho.

The life of Hipponax, as revealed in the poems, resembles a low-life saga centred on his private enmities, his amorous escapades and his poverty but it is probable he was another Petronius, depicting low-life characters while actually moving in higher social circles. In one fragment, Hipponax decries &quot;Bupalus, the mother-fucker () with Arete&quot;, the latter evidently being the mother of Bupalus, yet Arete is presented as performing fellatio on Hipponax in another fragment and, elsewhere, Hipponax complains &quot;Why did you go to bed with that rogue Bupalus?&quot;, again apparently referring to Arete (whose name ironically is Greek for &#x27;virtue&#x27;). The poet is a man of action but, unlike Archilochus, who served as a warrior on Thasos, his battlefields are close to home:

Hipponax&#x27;s quarrelsome disposition is also illustrated in verses quoted by Tzetzes, where the bard abuses a painter called Mimnes, and advises him thus:
==Work==
Hipponax composed within the iambus tradition which, in the work of Archilochus, a hundred years earlier, appears to have functioned as ritualized abuse and obscenity associated with the religious cults of Demeter and Dionysus but which, in Hipponax&#x27;s day, seems rather to have had the purpose of entertainment. In both cases, the genre featured scornful abuse, a bitter tone and sexual permissiveness.

Unlike Archilochus, however, he frequently refers to himself by name, emerging as a highly self-conscious figure, and his poetry is more narrow and insistently vulgar in scope: &quot;with Hipponax, we are in an unheroic, in fact, a very sordid world&quot;, amounting to &quot;a new conception of the poet&#x27;s function.&quot;

He was considered the inventor of a peculiar metre, the scazon (&quot;halting iambic&quot; as Murray calls it) or choliamb, which substitutes a spondee or trochee for the final iambus of an iambic senarius, and is an appropriate form for the burlesque character of his poems. As an ancient scholar once put it:

Little of his work survives despite its interest to Alexandrian scholars, who collected it in two or three books. Most of the surviving fragments are in choliambs but others feature trochaic tetrameter and even dactyls, the latter sometimes in combination with iambs and even on their own in dactylic hexameter, imitating epic poetry. Ancient scholars in fact credited him with inventing parody and Athenaeus quoted this diatribe against a glutton &#x27;Euromedontiades&#x27;, composed in dactylic hexameter in mock-heroic imitation of Homer&#x27;s Odyssey:
:&quot;Muse, sing of Eurymedontiades, sea-swilling Charybdis,&quot;
:&quot;his belly a sharp-slicing knife, his table manners atrocious;&quot;
:&quot;sing how, condemned by public decree, he will perish obscenely&quot;
:&quot;under a rain of stones, on the beach of the barren salt ocean&quot;&quot;—fragment 128
Most archaic poets (including the iambic poets Archilochus and Semonides) were influenced by the Ionian epic tradition, as represented in the work of Homer. Except for parody, Hipponax composed as if Homer never existed, avoiding not only heroic sentiment but even epic phrasing and vocabulary. He employed a form of Ionic Greek that included an unusually high proportion of Anatolian and particularly Lydian loanwords, as for example here where he addresses Zeus with the outlandish Lydian word for &#x27;king&#x27; (nominative ):
:
:&quot;Zeus, father Zeus, sultan of the Olympian gods,&quot;
:&quot;why have you not given me gold...?&quot;—fragment 38

Eating, defecating and fornicating are frequent themes and often they are employed together, as in fragment 92, a tattered papyrus which narrates a sexual encounter in a malodorous privy, where a Lydian-speaking woman performs some esoteric and obscene rites on the narrator, including beating his genitals with a fig branch and inserting something up his anus, provoking incontinence and finally an attack by dung beetles—a wild scene that possibly inspired the &#x27;Oenothea&#x27; episode in Petronius&#x27;s &quot;Satyricon&quot;.

The extant work also includes fragments of epodes (fr. 115–118) but the authorship is disputed by many modern scholars, who attribute them to Archilochus on various grounds, including for example the earlier poet&#x27;s superior skill in invective and the fragments&#x27; resemblance to the tenth epode of Horace (an avowed imitator of Archilochus). Archilochus might also have been the source for an unusually beautiful line attributed to Hipponax (a line that has also been described &quot;as clear, melodious and spare as a line of Sappho&quot;):
:—fr. 119
:&quot;If only I might have a maiden who is both beautiful and tender.&quot;

===Influence===
Hipponax influenced Alexandrian poets searching for alternative styles and uses of language, such as Callimachus and Herodas, and his colourful reputation as an acerbic, social critic also made him a popular subject for verse, as in this epigram by Theocritus rendered here in prose:
:&quot;Here lies the poet Hipponax. If you are a scoundrel, do not approach the tomb; but if you are honest and from worthy stock, sit down in confidence and, if you like, fall asleep,&quot;
or in this 19th century rhyming translation by C.S.Calverley:

:Tuneful Hipponax rests him here.
:Let no base rascal venture near.
:Ye who rank high in birth and mind
:Sit down—and sleep, if so inclined.

Ancient literary critics credited him with inventing literary parody and &quot;lame&quot; poetic meters suitable for vigorous abuse, as well as with influencing comic dramatists such as Aristophanes. His witty, abusive style appears for example in this passage by Herodian, who was mainly interested in its linguistic aspects (many of the extant verses were preserved for us by lexicographers and grammarians interested in rare words):
:

:&quot;What navel-snipper wiped and washed you as you squirmed about, you crack-brained creature?&quot;
where &#x27;navel-snipper&#x27; signifies a midwife.

===Transmission and reception===
Few fragments of his work survived through the Byzantine period despite his earlier popularity with Alexandrian poets and scholars. The Christian fathers disapproved of his abusive and obscene verses and he was also singled out as unedifying by Julian the Apostate, the pagan emperor, who instructed his priests to &quot;abstain not only from impure and lascivious acts but also from speech and reading of the same character...No initiate shall read Archilochus or Hipponax or any of the authors who write the same kind of thing.&quot; Moreover, Hipponax&#x27;s Ionic dialect and his extensive use of foreign words made his work unsuited to an ancient education system that promoted Attic, the dialect of classical Athens. Today the longest fragment of complete, consecutive verses comprises only six lines. Archeologists working at Oxyrhynchus have added to the meagre collection with tattered scraps of papyrus, of which the longest, published in 1941, has &quot;parts&quot; of over fifty choliambics.

Old Comedy, as a medium for invective and abuse, was a natural successor to iambus from the viewpoint of Aristotle and Aristophanes, the master of Old Comedy, certainly borrowed inspiration from Hipponax: &quot;Someone ought to give them a Bupalus or two on the jaw—that might shut them up for a bit&quot; the men&#x27;s chorus says about the women&#x27;s chorus in Lysistrata, and &quot;Wonderful poet, Hipponax!&quot; Dionysus exclaims in Frogs, while trying to disguise the pain inflicted on himself during a flogging. A quote attributed to Hipponax by Stobaeus actually appears to have been composed by a New Comedy poet.

===Some Hipponactean sayings===
*&quot;There are two days when a woman is a pleasure: the day one marries her and the day one carries out her dead body.&quot; ()
*&quot;drank like a lizard in a privy.&quot;
*&quot;croaking like a raven in a privy.&quot;
*&quot;sister of cow manure&quot;
*&quot;opening of filth...self-exposer&quot; ()
*&quot;Mimnes, you who gape open all the way to the shoulders.&quot; ():
*&quot;interprandial pooper&quot; ()

<text>Bupalus () and Athenis (), were sons of Archermus, and members of the celebrated school of sculpture in marble which flourished in Chios in the 6th century BC. They were contemporaries of the poet Hipponax, whom they were said to have caricatured. Their works consisted almost entirely of draped female figures, Artemis, Fortune, The Graces, when the Chian school has been well called a school of Madonnas. Augustus brought many of the works of Bupalus and Athenis to Rome, and placed them on the gable of the temple of Apollo Palatinus. Bupalus supposedly committed suicide out of shame after Hipponax wrote caustic satirical poetry about him to revenge himself on Bupalus for his refusal to let Hipponax marry his daughter and for his caricature of Hipponax.

Aristophanes refers to Bupalus in the &quot;Lysistrata&quot;. When the Chorus of Men encounter the Chorus of Women near the north-western edge of the Acropolis they ridicule the women, &quot;I warrant, now, if twice or thrice we slap their faces neatly, That they will learn, like Bupalus, to hold their tongues discreetly.&quot; (Benjamin Bickley Rogers translation)

It is now suggested that the north (and perhaps also the east) frieze of the Siphnian Treasury in Delphi was the work of Bupalus, based on a partially erased inscription around the circumference of one of the giant&#x27;s shields, reconstructed as:

Ḅ[όπαλ]ο[ς Ἀρχέρμο̄? τά]δε καὶ τὄπισθεν ἐποίε

&quot;Boupalos son of Archermos made these (sculptures) and those behind.&quot;

<text>Sir Charles Wheatstone (; 6 February 1802 – 19 October 1875) was an English physicist and inventor best known for his contributions to the development of the Wheatstone bridge, originally invented by Samuel Hunter Christie, which is used to measure an unknown electrical resistance, and as a major figure in the development of telegraphy. His other contributions include the English concertina, the stereoscope (a device for displaying three-dimensional images) and the Playfair cipher (an encryption technique).

== Life ==

Charles Wheatstone was born in Barnwood, Gloucestershire. His father, W. Wheatstone, was a music-seller in the town, who moved to 128 Pall Mall, London, four years later, becoming a teacher of the flute. Charles, the second son, went to a village school, near Gloucester, and afterwards to several institutions in London. One of them was in Kennington, and kept by a Mrs. Castlemaine, who was astonished at his rapid progress. From another he ran away, but was captured at Windsor, not far from the theatre of his practical telegraph. As a boy he was very shy and sensitive, liking to retreat into an attic, without any other company than his own thoughts.

When he was about fourteen years old he was apprenticed to his uncle and namesake, a maker and seller of musical instruments at 436 Strand, London; but he showed little taste for handicraft or business, and loved better to study books. His father encouraged him in this, and finally took him out of the uncle&#x27;s charge.

At the age of fifteen, Wheatstone translated French poetry, and wrote two songs, one of which was given to his uncle, who published it without knowing it as his nephew&#x27;s composition. Some lines of his on the lyre became the motto of an engraving by Bartolozzi. He often visited an old book-stall in the vicinity of Pall Mall, which was then a dilapidated and unpaved thoroughfare. Most of his pocket-money was spent in purchasing the books which had taken his fancy, whether fairy tales, history, or science.

One day, to the surprise of the bookseller, he coveted a volume on the discoveries of Volta in electricity, but not having the price, he saved his pennies and secured the volume. It was written in French, and so he was obliged to save again, until he could buy a dictionary. Then he began to read the volume, and, with the help of his elder brother, William, to repeat the experiments described in it, with a home-made battery, in the scullery behind his father&#x27;s house. In constructing the battery, the boy philosophers ran short of money to procure the requisite copper-plates. They had only a few copper coins left. A happy thought occurred to Charles, who was the leading spirit in these researches, &#x27;We must use the pennies themselves,&#x27; said he, and the battery was soon complete.

At Christchurch, Marylebone, on 12 February 1847, Wheatstone was married to Emma West. She was the daughter of a Taunton tradesman, and of handsome appearance. She died in 1866, leaving a family of five young children to his care. His domestic life was quiet and uneventful.

Though silent and reserved in public, Wheatstone was a clear and voluble talker in private, if taken on his favourite studies, and his small but active person, his plain but intelligent countenance, was full of animation. Sir Henry Taylor tells us that he once observed Wheatstone at an evening party in Oxford earnestly holding forth to Lord Palmerston on the capabilities of his telegraph. &#x27;You don&#x27;t say so!&#x27; exclaimed the statesman. &#x27;I must get you to tell that to the Lord Chancellor.&#x27; And so saying, he fastened the electrician on Lord Westbury, and effected his escape. A reminiscence of this interview may have prompted Palmerston to remark that a time was coming when a minister might be asked in Parliament if war had broken out in India, and would reply, &#x27;Wait a minute; I&#x27;ll just telegraph to the Governor-General, and let you know.&#x27;
Wheatstone was knighted in 1868, after his completion of the automatic telegraph. He had previously been made a Chevalier of the Legion of Honour. Some thirty-four distinctions and diplomas of home or foreign societies bore witness to his scientific reputation. Since 1836 he had been a Fellow of the Royal Society, and in 1859 he was elected a foreign member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences, and in 1873 a Foreign Associate of the French Academy of Sciences. The same year he was awarded the Ampere Medal by the French Society for the Encouragement of National Industry. In 1875 he was created an honorary member of the Institution of Civil Engineers. He was a D.C.L. of Oxford and an LL.D. of Cambridge.

While on a visit to Paris during the autumn of 1875, and engaged in perfecting his receiving instrument for submarine cables, he caught a cold, which produced inflammation of the lungs, an illness from which he died in Paris, on 19 October 1875 aged 73. A memorial service was held in the Anglican Chapel, Paris, and attended by a deputation of the academy. His remains were taken to his home in Park Crescent, London, (marked by a blue plaque today) and buried in Kensal Green Cemetery.

== Music instruments and acoustics ==
In September 1821, Wheatstone brought himself into public notice by exhibiting the &#x27;Enchanted Lyre,&#x27; or &#x27;Acoucryptophone,&#x27; at a music shop at Pall Mall and in the Adelaide Gallery. It consisted of a mimic lyre hung from the ceiling by a cord, and emitting the strains of several instruments – the piano, harp, and dulcimer. In reality it was a mere sounding box, and the cord was a steel rod that conveyed the vibrations of the music from the several instruments which were played out of sight and ear-shot. At this period Wheatstone made numerous experiments on sound and its transmission. Some of his results are preserved in Thomson&#x27;s &quot;Annals of Philosophy&quot; for 1823.

He recognised that sound is propagated by waves or oscillations of the atmosphere, as light was then believed to be by undulations of the luminiferous ether. Water, and solid bodies, such as glass, or metal, or sonorous wood, convey the modulations with high velocity, and he conceived the plan of transmitting sound-signals, music, or speech to long distances by this means. He estimated that sound would travel through solid rods, and proposed to telegraph from London to Edinburgh in this way. He even called his arrangement a &#x27;telephone.&#x27; (Robert Hooke, in his &quot;Micrographia&quot;, published in 1667, writes: &#x27;I can assure the reader that I have, by the help of a distended wire, propagated the sound to a very considerable distance in an instant, or with as seemingly quick a motion as that of light.&#x27; Nor was it essential the wire should be straight; it might be bent into angles. This property is the basis of the mechanical or lover&#x27;s telephone, said to have been known to the Chinese many centuries ago. Hooke also considered the possibility of finding a way to quicken our powers of hearing.)

A writer in the &quot;Repository of Arts&quot; for 1 September 1821, in referring to the &#x27;Enchanted Lyre,&#x27; beholds the prospect of an opera being performed at the King&#x27;s Theatre, and enjoyed at the Hanover Square Rooms, or even at the Horns Tavern, Kennington. The vibrations are to travel through underground conductors, like to gas in pipes.

: &quot;And if music be capable of being thus conducted,&#x27; he observes, &#x27;perhaps the words of speech may be susceptible of the same means of propagation. The eloquence of counsel, the debates of Parliament, instead of being read the next day only, – But we shall lose ourselves in the pursuit of this curious subject.&quot;

Besides transmitting sounds to a distance, Wheatstone devised a simple instrument for augmenting feeble sounds, to which he gave the name of &#x27;Microphone.&#x27; It consisted of two slender rods, which conveyed the mechanical vibrations to both ears, and is quite different from the electrical microphone of Professor Hughes.

In 1823, his uncle, the musical instrument maker, died, and Wheatstone, with his elder brother, William, took over the business. Charles had no great liking for the commercial part, but his ingenuity found a vent in making improvements on the existing instruments, and in devising philosophical toys. He also invented instruments of his own. One of the most famous was the Wheatstone concertina. It was a six sided instrument with 64 keys, logically arranged for simple chromatic fingerings. The English concertina became increasingly famous throughout his lifetime, however it didn&#x27;t reach its peak of popularity until the early 20th century.

In 1827, Wheatstone introduced his &#x27;kaleidophone&#x27;, a device for rendering the vibrations of a sounding body apparent to the eye. It consists of a metal rod, carrying at its end a silvered bead, which reflects a &#x27;spot&#x27; of light. As the rod vibrates the spot is seen to describe complicated figures in the air, like a spark whirled about in the darkness. His photometer was probably suggested by this appliance. It enables two lights to be compared by the relative brightness of their reflections in a silvered bead, which describes a narrow ellipse, so as to draw the spots into parallel lines.


In 1828, Wheatstone improved the German wind instrument, called the &quot;Mundharmonika&quot;, creating the &quot;symphonium&quot; (or &quot;symphonion&quot;), a mouth-blown free-reed instrument with a logical layout of button keys, patented on 19 December 1829, prefiguring the bellows-blown English concertina. The portable harmonium is another of his inventions, which gained a prize medal at the Great Exhibition of 1851. He also improved the speaking machine of De Kempelen, and endorsed the opinion of Sir David Brewster, that before the end of this century a singing and talking apparatus would be among the conquests of science.

In 1834, Wheatstone, who had won a name for himself, was appointed to the Chair of Experimental Physics in King&#x27;s College London. His first course of lectures on sound were a complete failure, due to his abhorrence of public speaking. In the rostrum he was tongue-tied and incapable, sometimes turning his back on the audience and mumbling to the diagrams on the wall. In the laboratory he felt himself at home, and ever after confined his duties mostly to demonstration.

== Velocity of electricity ==
He achieved renown by a great experiment made in 1834 – the measurement of the velocity of electricity in a wire. He cut the wire at the middle, to form a gap which a spark might leap across, and connected its ends to the poles of a Leyden jar filled with electricity. Three sparks were thus produced, one at each end of the wire, and another at the middle. He mounted a tiny mirror on the works of a watch, so that it revolved at a high velocity, and observed the reflections of his three sparks in it. The points of the wire were so arranged that if the sparks were instantaneous, their reflections would appear in one straight line; but the middle one was seen to lag behind the others, because it was an instant later. The electricity had taken a certain time to travel from the ends of the wire to the middle. This time was found by measuring the amount of lag, and comparing it with the known velocity of the mirror. Having got the time, he had only to compare that with the length of half the wire, and he could find the velocity of electricity. His results gave a calculated velocity of 288,000 miles per second, i.e. faster than what we now know to be the speed of light (), but were nonetheless an interesting approximation.

It was already appreciated by some scientists that the &quot;velocity&quot; of electricity was dependent on the properties of the conductor and its surroundings. Francis Ronalds had observed signal retardation in his buried electric telegraph cable (but not his airborne line) in 1816 and outlined its cause to be induction. Wheatstone witnessed these experiments as a youth, which were apparently a stimulus for his own research in telegraphy. Decades later, after the telegraph had been commercialised, Michael Faraday described how the velocity of an electric field in a submarine wire, coated with insulator and surrounded with water, is only , or still less.

Wheatstone&#x27;s device of the revolving mirror was afterwards employed by Léon Foucault and Hippolyte Fizeau to measure the relative speeds of light in air versus water, and later to measure the speed of light.

== Spectroscopy ==
Wheatstone and others also contributed to early spectroscopy through the discovery and exploitation of spectral emission lines.

As John Munro wrote in 1891, &quot;In 1835, at the Dublin meeting of the British Association, Wheatstone showed that when metals were volatilised in the electric spark, their light, examined through a prism, revealed certain rays which were characteristic of them. Thus the kind of metals which formed the sparking points could be determined by analysing the light of the spark. This suggestion has been of great service in spectrum analysis, and as applied by Robert Bunsen, Gustav Robert Kirchhoff, and others, has led to the discovery of several new elements, such as rubidium and thallium, as well as increasing our knowledge of the heavenly bodies.&quot;

== Telegraph ==
Wheatstone abandoned his idea of transmitting intelligence by the mechanical vibration of rods, and took up the electric telegraph. In 1835 he lectured on the system of Baron Schilling, and declared that the means were already known by which an electric telegraph could be made of great service to the world. He made experiments with a plan of his own, and not only proposed to lay an experimental line across the Thames, but to establish it on the London and Birmingham Railway. Before these plans were carried out, however, he received a visit from William 
Cooke at his house in Conduit Street on 27 February 1837, which had an important influence on his future.

=== Cooperation with Cooke ===

Cooke was an officer in the Madras Army, who, being home on leave, was attending some lectures on anatomy at the University of Heidelberg, where, on 6 March 1836, he witnessed a demonstration with the telegraph of professor Georg Munke, and was so impressed with its importance, that he forsook his medical studies and devoted all his efforts to the work of introducing the telegraph. He returned to London soon after, and was able to exhibit a telegraph with three needles in January 1837. Feeling his want of scientific knowledge, he consulted Michael Faraday and Peter Roget (then secretary of the Royal Society): Roget sent him to Wheatstone.

At a second interview, Cooke told Wheatstone of his intention to bring out a working telegraph, and explained his method. Wheatstone, according to his own statement, remarked to Cooke that the method would not act, and produced his own experimental telegraph. Finally, Cooke proposed that they should enter into a partnership, but Wheatstone was at first reluctant to comply. He was a well-known man of science, and had meant to publish his results without seeking to make capital of them. Cooke, on the other hand, declared that his sole object was to make a fortune from the scheme. In May they agreed to join their forces, Wheatstone contributing the scientific, and Cooke the administrative talent. The deed of partnership was dated 19 November 1837. A joint patent was taken out for their inventions, including the five-needle telegraph of Wheatstone, and an alarm worked by a relay, in which the current, by dipping a needle into mercury, completed a local circuit, and released the detent of a clockwork.

The five-needle telegraph, which was mainly, if not entirely, due to Wheatstone, was similar to that of Schilling, and based on the principle enunciated by Ampère – that is to say, the current was sent into the line by completing the circuit of the battery with a make and break key, and at the other end it passed through a coil of wire surrounding a magnetic needle free to turn round its centre. According as one pole of the battery or the other was applied to the line by means of the key, the current deflected the needle to one side or the other. There were five separate circuits actuating five different needles. The latter were pivoted in rows across the middle of a dial shaped like a diamond, and having the letters of the alphabet arranged upon it in such a way that a letter was literally pointed out by the current deflecting two of the needles towards it.

=== Early installations ===

An experimental line, with a sixth return wire, was run between the Euston terminus and Camden Town station of the London and North Western Railway on 25 July 1837. The actual distance was only one and a half-miles (2.4 km), but spare wire had been inserted in the circuit to increase its length. It was late in the evening before the trial took place. Cooke was in charge at Camden Town, while Robert Stephenson and other gentlemen looked on; and Wheatstone sat at his instrument in a dingy little room, lit by a tallow candle, near the booking-office at Euston. Wheatstone sent the first message, to which Cooke replied: and &quot;never&quot; said Wheatstone, &quot;did I feel such a tumultuous sensation before, as when, all alone in the still room, I heard the needles click, and as I spelled the words, I felt all the magnitude of the invention pronounced to be practicable beyond cavil or dispute.&quot;

In spite of this trial, however, the directors of the railway treated the &#x27;new-fangled&#x27; invention with indifference, and requested its removal. In July 1839, however, it was favoured by the Great Western Railway, and a line erected from the Paddington station terminus to West Drayton railway station, a distance of . Part of the wire was laid underground at first, but subsequently all of it was raised on posts along the line. Their circuit was eventually extended to in 1841, and was publicly exhibited at Paddington as a marvel of science, which could transmit fifty signals a distance of 280,000 miles per minute (7,500 km/s). The price of admission was a shilling (£0.05), and in 1844 one fascinated observer recorded the following:
It is perfect from the terminus of the Great Western as far as&quot; &quot;Slough – that is, eighteen miles; the wires being in some places&quot; &quot;underground in tubes, and in others high up in the air, which last,&quot; &quot;he says, is by far the best plan. We asked if the weather did not&quot; &quot;affect the wires, but he said not; a violent thunderstorm might&quot; &quot;ring a bell, but no more. We were taken into a small room (we&quot; &quot;being Mrs Drummond, Miss Philips, Harry Codrington and&quot; &quot;myself – and afterwards the Milmans and Mr Rich) where were&quot; &quot;several wooden cases containing different sorts of telegraphs. In one sort every word was spelt, and as each letter was placed in turn&quot; &quot;in a particular position, the machinery caused the electric fluid to run&quot; &quot;down the line, where it made the letter show itself at Slough, by what&quot; &quot;machinery he could not undertake to explain. After each word came a sign from Slough, signifying &quot;I understand&quot;, coming certainly in less than one second from the end of the word...Another prints the messages it brings, so that if no-one attended to the bell...the message would not be lost. This is effected by the electrical fluid causing a little hammer to strike the letter which presents itself, the letter which is raised hits some manifold writing paper (a new invention, black paper which, if pressed, leaves an indelible black mark), by which means the impression is left on white paper&quot; &quot;beneath. This was the most ingenious of all, and apparently Mr. Wheatstone&#x27;s&quot; &quot;favourite; he was very good-natured in explaining but&quot; &quot;understands it so well himself that he cannot feel how little we&quot; &quot;know about it, and goes too fast for such ignorant folk to follow&quot; &quot;him in everything. Mrs Drummond told me he is wonderful for&quot; &quot;the rapidity with which he thinks and his power of invention; he&quot; &quot;invents so many things that he cannot put half his ideas into&quot; &quot;execution, but leaves them to be picked up and used by others,&quot; &quot;who get the credit of them.
=== Public attention and success ===
The public took to the new invention after the capture of the murderer John Tawell, who in 1845, had become the first person to be arrested as the result of telecommunications technology. In the same year, Wheatstone introduced two improved forms of the apparatus, namely, the &#x27;single&#x27; and the &#x27;double&#x27; needle instruments, in which the signals were made by the successive deflections of the needles. Of these, the single-needle instrument, requiring only one wire, is still in use.

The development of the telegraph may be gathered from two facts. In 1855, the death of the Emperor Nicholas at St. Petersburg, about one o&#x27;clock in the afternoon, was announced in the House of Lords a few hours later. The result of The Oaks of 1890 was received in New York fifteen seconds after the horses passed the winning-post.

=== Differences with Cooke ===
In 1841 a difference arose between Cooke and Wheatstone as to the share of each in the honour of inventing the telegraph. The question was submitted to the arbitration of the famous engineer, Marc Isambard Brunel, on behalf of Cooke, and Professor Daniell, of King&#x27;s College, the inventor of the Daniell cell, on the part of Wheatstone. They awarded to Cooke the credit of having introduced the telegraph as a useful undertaking which promised to be of national importance, and to Wheatstone that of having by his researches prepared the public to receive it. They concluded with the words: &#x27;It is to the united labours of two gentlemen so well qualified for mutual assistance that we must attribute the rapid progress which this important invention has made during five years since they have been associated.&#x27; The decision, however vague, pronounces the needle telegraph a joint production. If it had mainly been invented by Wheatstone, it was chiefly introduced by Cooke. Their respective shares in the undertaking might be compared to that of an author and his publisher, but for the fact that Cooke himself had a share in the actual work of invention.

=== Further work on telegraphs ===
From 1836 to 1837 Wheatstone had thought a good deal about submarine telegraphs, and in 1840 he gave evidence before the Railway Committee of the House of Commons on the feasibility of the proposed line from Dover to Calais. He had even designed the machinery for making and laying the cable. In the autumn of 1844, with the assistance of J. D. Llewellyn, he submerged a length of insulated wire in Swansea Bay, and signalled through it from a boat to the Mumbles Lighthouse. Next year he suggested the use of gutta-percha for the coating of the intended wire across the English Channel.

In 1840 Wheatstone had patented an alphabetical telegraph, or, &#x27;Wheatstone A B C instrument,&#x27; which moved with a step-by-step motion, and showed the letters of the message upon a dial. The same principle was used in his type-printing telegraph, patented in 1841. This was the first apparatus which printed a telegram in type. It was worked by two circuits, and as the type revolved a hammer, actuated by the current, pressed the required letter on the paper.

The introduction of the telegraph had so far advanced that, on 2 September 1845, the Electric Telegraph Company was registered, and Wheatstone, by his deed of partnership with Cooke, received a sum of £33,000 for the use of their joint inventions.

In 1859 Wheatstone was appointed by the Board of Trade to report on the subject of the Atlantic cables, and in 1864 he was one of the experts who advised the Atlantic Telegraph Company on the construction of the successful lines of 1865 and 1866.

In 1870 the electric telegraph lines of the United Kingdom, worked by different companies, were transferred to the Post Office, and placed under Government control.

Wheatstone further invented the automatic transmitter, in which the signals of the message are first punched out on a strip of paper (punched tape), which is then passed through the sending-key, and controls the signal currents. By substituting a mechanism for the hand in sending the message, he was able to telegraph about 100 words a minute, or five times the ordinary rate. In the Postal Telegraph service this apparatus is employed for sending Press telegrams, and it has recently been so much improved, that messages are now sent from London to Bristol at a speed of 600 words a minute, and even of 400 words a minute between London and Aberdeen. On the night of 8 April 1886, when Gladstone introduced his Bill for Home Rule in Ireland, no fewer than 1,500,000 words were dispatched from the central station at St. Martin&#x27;s-le-Grand by 100 Wheatstone transmitters. The plan of sending messages by a running strip of paper which actuates the key was originally patented by Alexander Bain in 1846; but Wheatstone, aided by Augustus Stroh, an accomplished mechanician, and an able experimenter, was the first to bring the idea into successful operation. This system is often referred to as the Wheatstone Perforator and is the forerunner of the stock market ticker tape.

== Optics ==

Stereopsis was first described by Wheatstone in 1838. In 1840 he was awarded the Royal Medal of the Royal Society for his explanation of binocular vision, a research which led him to make stereoscopic drawings and construct the stereoscope. He showed that our impression of solidity is gained by the combination in the mind of two separate pictures of an object taken by both of our eyes from different points of view. Thus, in the stereoscope, an arrangement of lenses or mirrors, two photographs of the same object taken from different points are so combined as to make the object stand out with a solid aspect. Sir David Brewster improved the stereoscope by dispensing with the mirrors, and bringing it into its existing form with lenses.

The &#x27;pseudoscope&#x27; (Wheatstone coined the term from the Greek ψευδίς σκοπειν) was introduced in 1852, and is in some sort the reverse of the stereoscope, since it causes a solid object to seem hollow, and a nearer one to be farther off; thus, a bust appears to be a mask, and a tree growing outside of a window looks as if it were growing inside the room. Its purpose was to test his theory of stereo vision and for investigations into what would now be called experimental psychology.

== Measuring time ==
In 1840, Wheatstone introduced his chronoscope, for measuring minute intervals of time, which was used in determining the speed of a bullet or the passage of a star. In this apparatus an electric current actuated an electro-magnet, which noted the instant of an occurrence by means of a pencil on a moving paper. It is said to have been capable of distinguishing 1/7300 part of a second (137 microsecond), and the time a body took to fall from a height of one inch (25 mm).

On 26 November 1840, he exhibited his electro-magnetic clock in the library of the Royal Society, and propounded a plan for distributing the correct time from a standard clock to a number of local timepieces. The circuits of these were to be electrified by a key or contact-maker actuated by the arbour of the standard, and their hands corrected by electro-magnetism. The following January Alexander Bain took out a patent for an electro-magnetic clock, and he subsequently charged Wheatstone with appropriating his ideas. It appears that Bain worked as a mechanist to Wheatstone from August to December 1840, and he asserted that he had communicated the idea of an electric clock to Wheatstone during that period; but Wheatstone maintained that he had experimented in that direction during May. Bain further accused Wheatstone of stealing his idea of the electro-magnetic printing telegraph; but Wheatstone showed that the instrument was only a modification of his own electro-magnetic telegraph.

In 1840, Alexander Bain mentioned to the Mechanics Magazine editor his financial problems. The editor introduced him to Sir Charles Wheatstone. Bain demonstrated his models to Wheatstone, who, when asked for his opinion, said &quot;Oh, I shouldn&#x27;t bother to develop these things any further! There&#x27;s no future in them.&quot; Three months later Wheatstone demonstrated an electric clock to the Royal Society, claiming it was his own invention. However, Bain had already applied for a patent for it. Wheatstone tried to block Bain&#x27;s patents, but failed. When Wheatstone organised an Act of Parliament to set up the Electric Telegraph Company, the House of Lords summoned Bain to give evidence, and eventually compelled the company to pay Bain £10,000 and give him a job as manager, causing Wheatstone to resign.

=== Polar clock ===
One of Wheatstone&#x27;s most ingenious devices was the &#x27;Polar clock,&#x27; exhibited at the meeting of the British Association in 1848. It is based on the fact discovered by Sir David Brewster, that the light of the sky is polarised in a plane at an angle of ninety degrees from the position of the sun. It follows that by discovering that plane of polarisation, and measuring its azimuth with respect to the north, the position of the sun, although beneath the horizon, could be determined, and the apparent solar time obtained.

The clock consisted of a spyglass, having a Nicol (double-image) prism for an eyepiece, and a thin plate of selenite for an object-glass. When the tube was directed to the North Pole—that is, parallel to the Earth&#x27;s axis—and the prism of the eyepiece turned until no colour was seen, the angle of turning, as shown by an index moving with the prism over a graduated limb, gave the hour of day. The device is of little service in a country where watches are reliable; but it formed part of the equipment of the 1875–1876 North Polar expedition commanded by Captain Nares.

== Wheatstone bridge ==
In 1843 Wheatstone communicated an important paper to the Royal Society, entitled &#x27;An Account of Several New Processes for Determining the Constants of a Voltaic Circuit.&#x27; It contained an exposition of the well known balance for measuring the electrical resistance of a conductor, which still goes by the name of Wheatstone&#x27;s Bridge or balance, although it was first devised by Samuel Hunter Christie, of the Royal Military Academy, Woolwich, who published it in the &quot;Philosophical Transactions&quot; for 1833. The method was neglected until Wheatstone brought it into notice.

His paper abounds with simple and practical formulae for the calculation of currents and resistances by the law of Ohm. He introduced a unit of resistance, namely, a foot of copper wire weighing one hundred grains (6.5 g), and showed how it might be applied to measure the length of wire by its resistance. He was awarded a medal for his paper by the Society. The same year he invented an apparatus which enabled the reading of a thermometer or a barometer to be registered at a distance by means of an electric contact made by the mercury. A sound telegraph, in which the signals were given by the strokes of a bell, was also patented by Cooke and Wheatstone in May of that year.

== Cryptography ==
Wheatstone&#x27;s remarkable ingenuity was also displayed in the invention of ciphers. He was responsible for the then unusual Playfair cipher, named after his friend Lord Playfair. It was used by the militaries of several nations through at least World War I, and is known to have been used during World War II by British intelligence services.

It was initially resistant to cryptanalysis, but methods were eventually developed to break it. He also became involved in the interpretation of cipher manuscripts in the British Museum. He devised a cryptograph or machine for turning a message into cipher which could only be interpreted by putting the cipher into a corresponding machine adjusted to decrypt it.

As an amateur mathematician, Wheatstone published a mathematical proof in 1854 (see Cube (algebra)).

== Electrical generators ==
In 1840, Wheatstone brought out his magneto-electric machine for generating continuous currents.

On 4 February 1867, he published the principle of reaction in the dynamo-electric machine by a paper to the Royal Society; but Mr. C. W. Siemens had communicated the identical discovery ten days earlier, and both papers were read on the same day.

It afterwards appeared that Werner von Siemens, Samuel Alfred Varley, and Wheatstone had independently arrived at the principle within a few months of each other. Varley patented it on 24 December 1866; Siemens called attention to it on 17 January 1867; and Wheatstone exhibited it in action at the Royal Society on the above date.

== Disputes over invention ==
Wheatstone was involved in various disputes with other scientists throughout his life regarding his role in different technologies and appeared at times to take more credit than he was due. As well as William Fothergill Cooke, Alexander Bain and David Brewster, mentioned above, these also included Francis Ronalds at the Kew Observatory. Wheatstone was erroneously believed by many to have created the atmospheric electricity observing apparatus that Ronalds invented and developed at the observatory in the 1840s and also to have installed the first automatic recording meteorological instruments there (see for example, Howarth, p158).

==Personal life==

Wheatstone married Emma West, spinster, a daughter of John Hooke West, deceased, at Christ Church, Marylebone, on 12 February 1847. The marriage was by licence.

<doc id="79843" wikidata="Q303587" url="?curid=79843" title="Death of the Endless">
<text>Death of the Endless is a fictional personification of death who appears in American comic books published by DC Comics. She first appeared in &quot;The Sandman&quot; vol. 2, #8 (August 1989) and was created by Neil Gaiman and Mike Dringenberg.

In the DC Universe continuity, Death is both the end of life and a psychopomp. Like most personifications of death, Death meets with the recently deceased and guides them into their new existence. Unlike most personifications of death, she also visits people as they are born, according to Destruction in the &quot;Sandman Special: The Song of Orpheus&quot;. Evidently, only she seems to remember these encounters. In the special issue, it is also revealed that Death was known in ancient Greece as Teleute.

Physically, Death is also opposite to the traditional western culture personification of death, the Grim Reaper. In &quot;The Sandman&quot;, Death instead appears as an attractive, pale goth girl dressed in casual clothes — often a black top and jeans. She also wears a silver ankh on a chain around her neck, and has a marking similar to the eye of Horus around her right eye. She is pleasant, kind, down-to-earth, perky, and has been a nurturing figure for both incarnations of Dream. This irony has helped make Death one of the most popular characters from &quot;Sandman&quot;. Death was named the fifteenth greatest comic book character by &quot;Empire&quot;.

Kat Dennings voices the character in Audible&#x27;s &quot;The Sandman&quot; (2019), while Kirby portrays the character in the Netflix series &quot;The Sandman&quot; (2022–present) and &quot;Dead Boy Detectives&quot; (2024–present).

==Publication history==

Other personifications of Death have appeared in the DC Universe. In &quot;Captain Atom&quot; #42 Death appears alongside Black Racer of the New Gods and Nekron (a being embodying the will of &quot;The Black&quot;, the solitude and peace death represents from &quot;Green Lantern&quot;). The story stated that all three were equal, representing different aspects of death. Gaiman has denied this, however, and his stories make it clear that Death of the Endless is the ultimate personification of Death. It might be assumed, however, Nekron, the Racer, and the Black Flash are connected to her in some way. Alternatively, there may be multiple avatars or gods of Death in the DC universe, besides those claiming to be Death. Blackest Night has resolved this apparent contradiction or ambiguity, with Nekron no longer being referred to as an aspect of death but instead as a construct formed of darkness in response to the emerging light of the emotional spectrum.

A more traditional version of Death, a skeleton in a bluish or purplish cloak, appeared as a host in such DC titles as &quot;Weird Mystery Tales&quot;, &quot;House of Secrets&quot;, &quot;Ghosts&quot;, &quot;Weird War Tales&quot; (including being in the story in issue #94), &quot;DC Comics Presents&quot; #29, etc. &quot;Weird War Tales&quot; typically featured Death as a skeleton in some sort of military uniform relevant to the era and locality of the war depicted. This character appeared as recently as &quot;Elvira&#x27;s House of Mystery&quot; #2 (February 1986). How this pre-Crisis Death relates to Gaiman&#x27;s Death, if at all, is unclear, although her older brother Destiny appeared with the character, and both Deaths have appeared with incarnations of Superman. Superman referred to the earlier Death with the term &quot;Grim Reaper&quot;, so perhaps that could be regarded as a distinct character. However, in the pages of &quot;Weird War Tales&quot;, he called himself &quot;Death&quot;. He also appeared when &quot;Weird War Tales&quot; was published under the Vertigo imprint and in the 2010 &quot;Weird War Tales&quot; one-shot.

Death first appeared as a woman in &quot;The Witching Hour&quot; #56 (July 1975) in a tale told by Mordred (written by Carl Wessler and illustrated by Ruben Yandoc). She was depicted with short, curly, red-blonde hair, and was a rival for two men&#x27;s affections. Both men die in successive car accidents.
In &quot;Swamp Thing&quot; vol. 2, #6, The Phantom Stranger met Death in the form of a middle-aged gentleman, possibly inspired by &quot;Death Takes a Holiday&quot;. In the story, a young woman, Margaret &quot;Maggie&quot; Brennan, had what should have been a minor head injury and at one glimpse of Death chose to become Death&#x27;s bride. As someone newly dead herself, she taught Death that he needs to show compassion for the newly dead to allay their fears. He takes her advice and they both serve as aspects of Death. This version of Death was created by Mike W. Barr and Dan Spiegle. Maggie is blonde and bears only minor physical resemblance to Gaiman and Dringenberg&#x27;s version, though her compassionate nature is a similarity. In &quot;The Spectre&quot; (vol. 2), The Phantom Stranger himself appeared to be the only psychopomp in the DC Universe.

The current incarnation of Death first appeared in the final chapter of &quot;Sandman&quot; first story arc &quot;Preludes and Nocturnes&quot;, &quot;The Sound of Her Wings&quot;, (issue #8) where she gave Dream direction and a degree of understanding. Death instantly became very popular with readers, and she appears at least briefly in each of the nine subsequent story arcs. However, Gaiman attempted to entice and tease readers by rationing out the number of appearances from Dream&#x27;s family, so Death did not appear as frequently as one might expect for such a popular character. At the end of the ninth Sandman story arc &quot;The Kindly Ones&quot;, there is a lengthy and noteworthy appearance from Death, in which she finally brings her brother peace.

===Character design===
According to Gaiman, the initial visual design of Death was based on a friend of Dringenberg&#x27;s named Cinamon Hadley. From &quot;The Sandman Companion&quot;:

Hadley died from colon cancer at the age of 48 on January 6, 2018.

McKean also used a series of professional English models for representations of Death on covers of &quot;Sandman.&quot;

Despite some rumors, Death is not based on Gaiman&#x27;s friend Tori Amos.

==Fictional character biography==
===New Earth===
Death is the second eldest of the Endless, a family of beings that personify natural forces. Death is an incomprehensibly powerful entity having been shown (in a flashback in &quot;Brief Lives&quot;) to be virtually omniscient and able to intimidate the Furies, who show no fear of the other Endless, simply by raising her voice in &quot;The Kindly Ones&quot;. The witch Thessaly mentions that Death is the only one of the Endless who is bound by no rules, supported in Dream&#x27;s portion of &quot;Endless Nights&quot; in which she briefly makes an appearance at a conference designed to set functions for entities and leaves before it begins. In addition, it is mentioned in &quot;Brief Lives&quot; that she is the only one of the Endless who may survive the end of this incarnation of the universe. Death&#x27;s realm - called &quot;The Sunless Lands&quot; - is not portrayed in detail in the series, except for a brief scene in her &quot;house&quot; in the &quot;Sandman Special&quot;, &quot;Song of Orpheus&quot;, and later in &quot;The Books of Magic&quot; series. This is where she keeps her floppy hat collection, her goldfish Slim and Wandsworth and possibly her gallery. A brief glimpse of her realm can also be seen in &quot;The Little Endless Storybook&quot;, when Barnabas visits her, although this time in her &quot;apartment suite&quot;.

One day every century, Death is forced to live out the last day of a random person, to understand the value of the life she takes. At the end of &quot;&quot; her Endless self briefly converses with her mortal self.

===DC Rebirth===
==Powers and abilities==
Death is an immortal being of virtual omnipotence, omniscience and omnipresence. She is not a god of death or agent of it, but Death itself: the end of life. As for the end of her role, Death has said: &quot;When the last living thing dies, my job will be finished. I&#x27;ll put the chairs on the tables, turn out the lights, and lock the universe behind me when I leave&quot;.

Death is also capable of preventing aging and death if she chooses. In the middle ages, Death overheard a man claim he would not accept dying; she gave him that wish, while asking Dream to meet him once every century to see if he was ready to die.

==Appearances==
Death appeared in &quot;Captain Atom&quot; #42-43 (June–July 1990), alongside the Black Racer as one of several aspects of Death in the DC Universe. Gaiman reportedly took issue with this depiction, feeling that portraying her as merely an aspect of death diminished her importance. Other DC Universe comics that feature Death include the satirical &quot;Ambush Bug Nothing Special&quot; one-shot (Sep. 1992), and a cameo in the equally satirical Lobo comic book &quot;Lobo&#x27;s Back&quot; #3 (Oct. 1992), in which she slaps Lobo for getting fresh with her. She observes the destruction of the Earth in &quot;Legion of Super-Heroes&quot; vol. 4 #38 (Dec. 1992).

Death&#x27;s popularity saw her spun off into two solo miniseries, &quot;&quot; (1993), and &quot;&quot; (1996). Both were written by Gaiman and illustrated by Chris Bachalo, and dealt with Death&#x27;s encounters with various mortals. &quot;Death: The High Cost of Living&quot; became the first comic released under the newly instigated Vertigo branding in 1993, at which point &quot;The Sandman&quot; also moved from the DC to Vertigo imprint. A third miniseries, &quot;The Girl who Would Be Death&quot; by Caitlín R. Kiernan, was about a girl who purchased an ankh stolen from Death and tried to become her. Death is never actually seen in the series, but she speaks and acts in the third and fourth issues of the four-issue series.

In 2003, the manga-style graphic novel &quot;&quot; portrayed Death&#x27;s activities during the fourth Sandman story arc &quot;Season of Mists&quot;. It was written and illustrated by Jill Thompson, and the format proved popular enough for Thompson to produce the similarly manga-influenced follow-up &quot;Dead Boy Detectives&quot;, featuring minor &quot;Sandman&quot; characters, and &quot;featuring a cameo by Death&quot;.

A one-shot issue titled &quot;Death Gallery&quot; (1994) was released as one of several art showcase comics from DC Comics spotlighting various Sandman characters released between 1994 and 1995. The &quot;Death Gallery&quot; featured representations of Death by more than thirty comics artists, including a rough sketch by Gaiman himself. In &quot;Endless Nights&quot; (2003) Gaiman shows Death several billion years ago, with a markedly different personality — forbidding and joyless.

She also appears in &quot;The Books of Magic&quot; (first volume, 1991, also written by Gaiman) at the very end of time, where her function is to set things in order and close the universe down. She meets Timothy Hunter and Mister E there after Mister E has taken Timothy all the way to the end of time, because only there can he kill Timothy without fear of interference. Death stops the murder on the grounds that &quot;I took both of you billions of years ago&quot;. She sends Timothy back home, but forces Mister E to return the hard way. John Ney Rieber included her in &quot;The Books of Magic&quot; (vol. 2 #3-4), in which she lets Timothy Hunter hang out at her house and hold her teddy bear, Cavendish, while he is recovering from the venom of the Manticore. Hunter later encounters Death walking in the rain in &quot;The Books of Magic&quot; #25, and there was later an arc about her in &quot;&quot;. In &quot;Hellblazer&quot; #120, Death appears briefly in a pub filled with ghosts.

She also appeared in Mike Carey&#x27;s &quot;Lucifer&quot; series when the eponymous main character was wounded and nearly died. Initially it appears that Death has actually arrived for Lucifer, but in fact she is there for Elaine Belloc who dies (temporarily) saving Lucifer&#x27;s life. Death admits she has arrived a little early and takes the opportunity to talk to Lucifer who is currently trapped between life and death.

In &quot;Madame Xanadu&quot;, the title character calls out to her while chained up and denied access to her youth potions during the French Revolution. As she is a survivor from the days of King Arthur, she grows very old very quickly without them. She summons Death and reads her own cards, interpreting her Death card as predictive of her future destiny on earth. Death is so amused by this interpretation that she grants Madame Xanadu immortality, revocable any time Xanadu wishes. Death appeared in &quot;Action Comics&quot; #894, which was written by Paul Cornell. Gaiman helped write Death&#x27;s dialogue to ensure that her characterization remained consistent with &quot;The Sandman&quot;. In the story, while searching for a black power ring, Lex Luthor encounters her. She appears again in issue #900 and in &quot;The Flash&quot; (vol. 3) #6, part of the &quot;Brightest Day&quot; crossover.

===Quasi-canonical appearances===
In the AIDS-awareness eight-page comic &quot;Death Talks About Life&quot; by Gaiman and McKean (which was first included in various Vertigo titles, and later released as a stand-alone giveaway pamphlet), Death demonstrates safe sex by placing a condom on a banana held by John Constantine. Lightening the impact of the underlying message, she informs the reader that when one is through with the demonstration, &quot;you can eat the banana&quot;. This was used in high school health classes and is also reprinted as an addendum to the &quot;Death: The High Cost of Living&quot; trade paperback.

This version of Death also made a cameo appearance in the crossover special &quot;Avengers/JLA&quot; #2. She is represented in the Grandmaster&#x27;s home base, alongside Deadman, Hela and the purple-robed version of Death native to the Marvel Universe, which, as the plots of other crossover comics have hinged upon, exists in the same continuum of fictional universes as DC&#x27;s. Marvel&#x27;s version of Death appears alternatively as a coldly beautiful woman in a purple robe or a walking skeleton (sometimes male and sometimes female in form, depending upon the context).

She made an appearances in the Marvel Universe, at the wedding of Rick Jones and Marlo Chandler in &quot;The Incredible Hulk&quot; #418 trying successfully to evade Thanos and handing Marlo a hair brush, a visual pun referring to Marlo&#x27;s recent &#x27;brush with death&#x27;, this appearance subsequently forming the basis of numerous major storylines involving Marlo becoming Death/Death taking Marlo&#x27;s form, in particular &quot;Chaos War&quot; and &quot;Ben Reilly: The Scarlet Spider&quot;.

* &quot;Death of the Endless&quot; is referenced in the 2009 young adult novel, &quot;The Suicide Club&quot;, by Rhys Thomas. In it, the lead character describes death returning with the sound of beating wings.
* Death is referenced in original &quot;The Sandman&quot; penciller Sam Kieth&#x27;s &quot;The Maxx&quot;: &quot;They&#x27;re all necro-nerds and Sand freaks. They think death is romantic. Death is hard and cold and ugly, not some cute chick&quot; as quoted by the character Sara, as the comic panels focus in on a colored poster of Death herself.
* In the television series &quot;Roseanne&quot;, posters of Death are seen on Darlene&#x27;s bedroom walls, and a small postcard of Death hung for a time on the family refrigerator.
* Death made a brief cameo in &quot;Nodwick&quot; #33, greeting the warrior Yaeger during a near-death experience.
* Death is also mentioned in Jorge Jaramillo&#x27;s novel &quot;Vallecuervo&quot; (México, 2010). Úrsula, the main character, is looking for her brother. In an old attic she discovered he was living in, she finds an assortment of comic books: &quot;While I was looking at that Love and Rockets TPB I sensed I was being watched. To my surprise it was Her. Yes, Her. Death. Of the Endless. The cute chick in black dress from Neil Gaiman&#x27;s comics. She was there, standing still, looking right into my eyes. I moved forward, I touched Her face. Dust. I folded Her and took Her with me (along with those Rockets and some Rick Veitch&#x27;s books)&quot;.
* Death has a brief animated cameo in the 2017 fan-film, &quot;Sandman: 24 Hour Diner&quot;, based on #6 of Sandman. In an original sequence to the story, she collects the nightmares of the deceased patrons of the diner and rescues her brother Dream.
* The Virgin Books&#x27; New Adventures &quot;Doctor Who&quot; novel series introduced a manipulative and generally morally ambivalent female incarnation of Death (or rather, as later revealed, one of several Eternals masquerading as cosmic principles). In &quot;Happy Endings&quot;, she quotes from the original &quot;The Books of Magic&quot; mini-series. Although the bulk of the novel was written by Paul Cornell, the section featuring Death was written by author Neil Penswick, as part of a chapter written in tandem by the authors of the previous 49 novels.
* Death is described and discussed by American filmmaker Kevin Smith during his interview with Joe Rogan on The Joe Rogan Experience podcast #1123, in the context of how he dealt with his heart surgery. While on the operating table he thought about the Death character, and how in an issue of The Sandman, she was asked by an older man: &quot;&quot;That&#x27;s it? I did all these things. I worked my fingers to the bone. What did I get?&quot;, to which Death replied &quot;You got what everybody gets. You got a lifetime&quot;&quot;.
* The lead character of the music video for Pearl Jam&#x27;s &quot;Do the Evolution&quot; is said to have been inspired by Death herself.

<doc id="79845" wikidata="Q5736" url="?curid=79845" title="Amarna">
<text>Amarna (; ) is an extensive ancient Egyptian archaeological site containing the remains of what was the capital city during the late Eighteenth Dynasty. The city of &quot;Akhetaten&quot; was established in 1346 BC, built at the direction of the Pharaoh Akhenaten, and abandoned shortly after his death in 1332 BC. The name that the ancient Egyptians used for the city is transliterated as Akhetaten or Akhetaton, meaning &quot;the horizon of the Aten&quot;.

The site is on the east bank of the Nile River, in what today is the Egyptian province of Minya. It is about south of the city of al-Minya, south of the Egyptian capital, Cairo, and north of Luxor (site of the previous capital, Thebes). The city of Deir Mawas lies directly to its west. On the east side of Amarna there are several modern villages, the chief of which are l-Till in the north and el-Hagg Qandil in the south.

Activity in the region flourished from the Amarna Period until the later Roman era.

==Name==
The name &quot;Amarna&quot; comes from the Beni Amran tribe that lived in the region and founded a few settlements. The ancient Egyptian name was Akhetaten.

(This site should be distinguished from Tell Amarna in Syria, a Halaf period archaeological tell.)

English Egyptologist Sir John Gardner Wilkinson visited Amarna twice in the 1820s and identified it as Alabastron, following the sometimes contradictory descriptions of Roman-era authors Pliny (&quot;On Stones&quot;) and Ptolemy (&quot;Geography&quot;), although he was not sure about the identification and suggested Kom el-Ahmar as an alternative location.

==City of Akhetaten==
The area of the city was effectively a virgin site, and it was this city that Akhetaten described as the Aten&#x27;s &quot;seat of the First Occasion, which he had made for himself that he might rest in it&quot;.

It may be that the Royal Wadi&#x27;s resemblance to the hieroglyph for &quot;horizon&quot; showed that this was the place to found the city.

The city was built as the new capital of the Pharaoh Akhenaten, dedicated to his new religion of worship to the Aten. Construction started in or around Year 5 of his reign (1346 BC) and was probably completed by Year 9 (1341 BC), although it became the capital city two years earlier. To speed up construction of the city most of the buildings were constructed out of mudbrick, and white washed. The most important buildings were faced with local stone.

It is the only ancient Egyptian city which preserves great details of its internal plan in large part because it was abandoned almost completely shortly after the royal government of Tutankhamun quit the city in favor of Thebes (modern Luxor). The city seems to have remained active for a decade or so after his death, and a shrine to Horemheb indicates that it was at least partially occupied at the beginning of his reign, if only as a source for building material elsewhere. Once it was abandoned, it remained uninhabited until Roman settlement began along the edge of the Nile. However, due to the unique circumstances of its creation and abandonment, it is questionable how representative of ancient Egyptian cities it actually is. Amarna was hastily constructed and covered an area of approximately of territory on the east bank of the Nile River; on the west bank, land was set aside to provide crops for the city&#x27;s population. The entire city is encircled with a total of 14 boundary stelae (labeled A thru V with discontinuities left for those thought to be missing, Stele B was defaced by locals in 1885) detailing Akhenaten&#x27;s conditions for the establishment of this new capital city of Egypt.

The earliest dated stele from Akhenaten&#x27;s new city is known to be &quot;Boundary stele K&quot; which is dated to Year 5, IV Peret (or month 8), day 13 of Akhenaten&#x27;s reign. (Most of the original 14 boundary stelae have been badly eroded.) It preserves an account of Akhenaten&#x27;s foundation of this city. The document records the pharaoh&#x27;s wish to have several temples of the Aten to be erected here, for several royal tombs to be created in the eastern hills of Amarna for himself, his chief wife Nefertiti, and his eldest daughter Meritaten as well as his explicit command that when he was dead, he would be brought back to Amarna for burial. Boundary stela K introduces a description of the events that were being celebrated at Amarna:


This text then goes on to state that Akhenaten made a great oblation to the god Aten &quot;and this is the theme [of the occasion] which is illustrated in the lunettes of the stelae where he stands with his queen and eldest daughter before an altar heaped with offerings under the Aten, while it shines upon him rejuvenating his body with its rays.&quot;

===Site and plan===
Located on the east bank of the Nile, the ruins of the city are laid out roughly north to south along a &quot;Royal Road&quot;, now referred to as &quot;Sikhet es-Sultan&quot;. The Royal residences are generally to the north, in what is known as the North City, with a central administration and religious area and the south of the city is made up of residential suburbs.

====North City====
If one approached the city of Amarna from the north by river the first buildings past the northern boundary stele would be the North Riverside Palace. This building ran all the way up to the waterfront and was likely the main residence of the royal family. Located within the North City area is the Northern Palace, the main residence of the royal family. Between this and the central city, the Northern Suburb was initially a prosperous area with large houses, but the house size decreased and became poorer the further from the road they were.

====Central City====
Most of the important ceremonial and administrative buildings were located in the central city. Here the Great Temple of the Aten and the Small Aten Temple were used for religious functions and between these the Great Royal Palace and Royal Residence were the ceremonial residence of the king and royal family, and were linked by a bridge or ramp. Located behind the Royal Residence was the Bureau of Correspondence of Pharaoh, where the Amarna Letters were found.

This area was probably the first area to be completed, and had at least two phases of construction.

====Southern suburbs====
To the south of the city was the area now referred to as the &quot;Southern Suburbs&quot;. It contained the estates of many of the city&#x27;s powerful nobles, including Nakhtpaaten (Chief Minister), Ranefer, Panehesy (High Priest of the Aten), and Ramose (Master of Horses). This area also held the studio of the sculptor Thutmose, where the famous bust of Nefertiti was found in 1912.

Further to the south of the city was Kom el-Nana, an enclosure, usually referred to as a &quot;sun-shade&quot;, and was probably built as a sun-temple., and then the Maru-Aten, which was a palace or sun-temple originally thought to have been constructed for Akhenaten&#x27;s queen Kiya, but on her death her name and images were altered to those of Meritaten, his daughter.

====City outskirts====

Surrounding the city and marking its extent, the Boundary Stelae (each a rectangle of carved rock on the cliffs on both sides of the Nile) describing the founding of the city are a primary source of information about it.
Away from the city Akhenaten&#x27;s Royal necropolis was started in a narrow valley to the east of the city, hidden in the cliffs. Only one tomb was completed, and was used by an unnamed Royal Wife, and Akhenaten&#x27;s tomb was hastily used to hold him and likely Meketaten, his second daughter.

In the cliffs to the north and south of the Royal Wadi, the nobles of the city constructed their Tombs.

==Life in ancient Amarna/Akhetaten==
Much of what is known about Amarna&#x27;s founding is due to the preservation of a series of official boundary stelae (13 are known) ringing the perimeter of the city. These are cut into the cliffs on both sides of the Nile (10 on the east, 3 on the west) and record the events of Akhetaten (Amarna) from founding to just before its fall.
To make the move from Thebes to Amarna, Akhenaten needed the support of the military. Ay, one of Akhenaten&#x27;s principal advisors, exercised great influence in this area because his father Yuya had been an important military leader. Additionally, everyone in the military had grown up together, they had been a part of the richest and most successful period in Egypt&#x27;s history under Akhenaten&#x27;s father, so loyalty among the ranks was strong and unwavering. Perhaps most importantly, &quot;it was a military whose massed ranks the king took every opportunity to celebrate in temple reliefs, first at Thebes and later at Amarna.&quot;

===Religious life===
While the reforms of Akhenaten are generally believed to have been oriented towards a sort of monotheism, or perhaps more accurately, monolatrism, archaeological evidence shows other deities were also revered, even at the centre of the Aten cult – if not officially, then at least by the people who lived and worked there.
... at Akhetaten itself, recent excavation by Kemp (2008: 41–46) has shown the presence of objects that depict gods, goddesses and symbols that belong to the traditional field of personal belief. So many examples of Bes, the grotesque dwarf figure who warded off evil spirits, have been found, as well as of the goddess-monster, Taweret, part crocodile, part hippopotamus, who was associated with childbirth. Also in the royal workmen&#x27;s village at Akhetaten, stelae dedicated to Isis and Shed have been discovered (Watterson 1984: 158 &amp; 208).


==Amarna art-style==


The Amarna art-style broke with long-established Egyptian conventions. Unlike the strict idealistic formalism of previous Egyptian art, it depicted its subjects more realistically. These included informal scenes, such as intimate portrayals of affection within the royal family or playing with their children, and no longer portrayed women as lighter coloured than men. The art also had a realism that sometimes borders on caricature.

While the worship of Aten was later referred to as the Amarna heresy and suppressed, this art had a more lasting legacy.

==Rediscovery and excavation==

===18th and 19th century excavations===
The first western mention of the city was made in 1714 by Claude Sicard, a French Jesuit priest who was travelling through the Nile Valley, and described the boundary stela from Amarna. As with much of Egypt, it was visited by Napoleon&#x27;s &quot;corps de savants&quot; in 1798–1799, who prepared the first detailed map of Amarna, which was subsequently published in &quot;Description de l&#x27;Égypte&quot; between 1821 and 1830.

After this European exploration continued in 1824 when Sir John Gardiner Wilkinson explored and mapped the city remains. The copyist Robert Hay and his surveyor G. Laver visited the locality and uncovered several of the Southern Tombs from sand drifts, recording the reliefs in 1833. The copies made by Hay and Laver languish largely unpublished in the British Library, where an ongoing project to identify their locations is underway.

The Prussian expedition led by Richard Lepsius visited the site in 1843 and 1845, and recorded the visible monuments and topography of Amarna in two separate visits over a total of twelve days, using drawings and paper squeezes. The results were ultimately published in &quot;Denkmäler aus Ägypten und Äthiopien&quot; between 1849 and 1913, including an improved map of the city. Despite being somewhat limited in accuracy, the engraved &quot;Denkmäler&quot; plates formed the basis for scholastic knowledge and interpretation of many of the scenes and inscriptions in the private tombs and some of the Boundary Stelae for the rest of the century. The records made by these early explorers teams are of immense importance since many of these remains were later destroyed or otherwise lost.

===The Amarna letters===
In 1887, a local woman digging for &quot;sebakh&quot; uncovered a cache of over 300 cuneiform tablets (now commonly known as the Amarna Letters). These tablets recorded select diplomatic correspondence of the Pharaoh and were predominantly written in Akkadian, the &quot;lingua franca&quot; commonly used during the Late Bronze Age of the Ancient Near East for such communication. This discovery led to the recognition of the importance of the site, and led to a further increase in exploration.

===Excavation of the king&#x27;s tomb===
Between 1891 and 1892 Alessandro Barsanti discovered and cleared the king&#x27;s tomb (although it was probably known to the local population from about 1880). In 1891 and 1892 Sir Flinders Petrie worked for one season at Amarna, working independently of the Egypt Exploration Fund. He excavated primarily in the Central City, investigating the Great Temple of the Aten, the Great Official Palace, the King&#x27;s House, the Bureau of Correspondence of Pharaoh, and several private houses. Although frequently amounting to little more than a sondage, Petrie&#x27;s excavations revealed additional cuneiform tablets, the remains of several glass factories, and a great quantity of discarded faience, glass, and ceramic in sifting the palace rubbish heaps (including Mycenaean sherds). By publishing his results and reconstructions rapidly, Petrie was able to stimulate further interest in the site&#x27;s potential.

===20th century excavations===
The copyist and artist Norman de Garis Davies published drawn and photographic descriptions of private tombs and boundary stelae from Amarna from 1903 to 1908. These books were republished by the EES in 2006.

In the early years of the 20th century (1907 to 1914) the Deutsche Orientgesellschaft expedition, led by Ludwig Borchardt, excavated extensively throughout the North and South suburbs of the city. The famous bust of Nefertiti, now in Berlin&#x27;s Ägyptisches Museum, was discovered amongst other sculptural artefacts in the workshop of the sculptor Thutmose. The outbreak of the First World War in August 1914 terminated the German excavations.

From 1921 to 1936 an Egypt Exploration Society expedition returned to excavation at Amarna under the direction of T.E. Peet, Sir Leonard Woolley, Henri Frankfort, Stephen Glanville, and John Pendlebury. Mary Chubb served as the digs administrator. The renewed investigations were focused on religious and royal structures.

During the 1960s the Egyptian Antiquities Organization (now the Egyptian Supreme Council of Antiquities) undertook a number of excavations at Amarna.

===21st century excavations===
Exploration of the city continues to the present, currently under the direction of Barry Kemp (Emeritus Professor in Egyptology, University of Cambridge, England) (until 2006, under the auspices of the Egypt Exploration Society and now with the ). In 1980 a separate expedition led by Geoffrey Martin described and copied the reliefs from the Royal Tomb, later publishing its findings together with objects thought to have come from the tomb. This work was published in 2 volumes by the EES.

From 2005 to 2013, the Amarna Project excavated at a cemetery of private individuals, close to the southern tombs of the Nobles.

== In media ==

=== Fictional ===

&quot;The Painted Queen&quot; written by the famous Elizabeth Peters a.k.a. Barbara Mertz is the most recent installment to the Amelia Peabody novels after the author&#x27;s passing in 2013. Elizabeth Peters was a school trained archaeologist, but was persuaded by her male colleagues that a woman was not to be an archaeologist, so &quot;she created characters based on those misogynistic Egyptologists...&quot; as stated by Sarah Parcak, a female archaeologist that specializes in remote sensing. The adventure stars a female archaeologist Amelia Peabody and the mystery of the missing Bust of Nefertiti. The Painted Queen takes place in the 1912, several years after the actual excavations at Amarna, when excavations in Egypt are solely European, local hires, or looters. Like all good mystery novels, there is humor, twists, and turns, and a predictable ending of a solved case.

&quot;Nefertiti&quot; by Michelle Moran is a historical fiction work that guides the reader from the perspective of Queen Nefertiti and her younger sister Mutnodjmet. The story follows the timeline from her time in Thebes to Amarna and after Akhenaten&#x27;s death. Nefertiti was the Chief wife in Akhenaten&#x27;s court or haram. Though she is well known by name, as many historical female role models, her story is often overlooked for masculine rulers. Michelle Moran webs her story of the queen and her sister with political secrets, loss of innocence, and female strength in a patriarchal society.

=== Non-fictional ===

&quot;The City of Akhenaten and Nefertiti: Amarna and its People&quot; by Barry Kemp, discusses everything from the conception of Amarna to the abandonment of the city. Within the book are images that display art, architecture, and the city as it was (reconstructed) and now. It also has a short chapter written by Kemp in the book &quot;Cities That Shaped the Ancient World&quot;.

=== Magazines ===

In the past years &quot;National Geographic&quot; and archaeological articles have published articles on Amarna, Akhenaten, Tutankhamun, or Nefertiti. Most of the article can be found in both the paperback or on the National Geographic website (currently the most recent article was published January 2021).

=== Opera ===

&quot;Akhnaten&quot;, act II, scene 3 (&quot;The City&quot;) by Philip Glass describes the mandate from Akhenaten to build Akhetaten. In the English lines, it is consistently referred to as the &quot;City of the Horizon&quot;.

<text>Dream of the Endless is a fictional anthropomorphic personification who first appeared in the first issue of &quot;The Sandman&quot;, written by Neil Gaiman and published by DC Comics. One of the seven Endless, who are inconceivably powerful beings older and greater than gods, Dream is both lord and personification of all dreams and stories, and all that is not in reality (which, in turn, Dream may define by his existence). He has taken many names, including &quot;Morpheus&quot;, &quot;Oneiros&quot;, &quot;Kai&#x27;ckul&quot;, and the &quot;Sandman&quot;, and his appearance can change depending on the person who is seeing him. Dream was named the sixth-greatest comic book character by &quot;Empire&quot;. He was also named fifteenth in IGN&#x27;s 100 Top Comic Book Heroes list.

After the events of &quot;The Sandman: The Kindly Ones&quot; that led to Dream&#x27;s death at the hands of the Furies, Daniel Hall becomes the new Dream.

Tom Sturridge is the principal actor portraying Dream in the television series &quot;The Sandman&quot; on Netflix; Ernest Kingsley Jr. portrays him in the form of Kai&#x27;ckul, as perceived by his one-time lover Nada.

==Publication history==
Dream is the protagonist and title character of the comic book &quot;The Sandman&quot;. The comic book grew out of a proposal by Neil Gaiman to revive DC&#x27;s 1974–1976 series &quot;The Sandman&quot;, written by Joe Simon and Michael Fleisher and illustrated by Jack Kirby and Ernie Chua. Gaiman soon began constructing a treatment for a new series. Gaiman mentioned his treatment in passing to DC editor Karen Berger. When months later Berger offered Gaiman a comic title to work on, he was unsure his &quot;Sandman&quot; pitch would be accepted. Weeks later, Berger asked Gaiman if he was interested in doing a &quot;Sandman&quot; series. Gaiman recalled: &quot;I said, &#x27;Um ... yes. Yes, definitely. What&#x27;s the catch?&#x27; Berger said: &#x27;There&#x27;s only one. We&#x27;d like a new Sandman. Keep the name. But the rest is up to you.

Gaiman crafted the new character from an initial image of &quot;a man, young, pale and naked, imprisoned in a tiny cell, waiting until his captors passed away ... deathly thin, with long dark hair, and strange eyes&quot;. Gaiman patterned the character&#x27;s black attire on a print of a Japanese kimono as well as his own wardrobe.

==Fictional character biography==

Dream is the ruler of the Dreaming where people go when they dream.

===Daniel Hall===
Daniel&#x27;s father Hector Hall was a ghost revived by the two nightmares Brute and Glob, in Morpheus&#x27;s absence. Whereafter Hippolyta &quot;Lyta&quot; Hall and Hector&#x27;s ghost lived in the dreams of a child named Jed Walker for two years. Upon Dream&#x27;s return to the Dreaming, he destroyed the barrier that the two had created around the child&#x27;s mind from the real Dreaming; imprisoned the two nightmares; released Hector&#x27;s ghost; and restored Lyta to the waking world. Upon leaving Lyta, Dream revealed that he would someday claim their unborn son because her unborn son had spent much of his gestation in the Dreaming. Before Dream faced Lucifer, he paid another visit to the two and named the child Daniel. In one of the issues in &quot;Fables and Reflections&quot;, Daniel was regaled with stories by Cain, Abel, and Eve while Matthew the Raven watched.

In &quot;the Kindly Ones&quot; saga, Lyta incorrectly believed that Daniel had been &#x27;abducted&#x27; by Dream, and took her grievances to the Furies, with whom she destroyed much of the Dreaming. Unknown to her, Daniel was abducted by Loki and Robin Goodfellow, and retrieved by the Corinthian and Matthew. At Morpheus&#x27; citadel, Morpheus transfers his role to Daniel and allows Death to take him. Daniel as the new Dream is an amalgam of a child and the Endless whom he represents. His speech is largely unchanged, but it is drawn with black font on a white background (as opposed to the direct contrasting style of the former self). He is still identified by the honorific &quot;Dream of the Endless&quot;, but refuses the name of &#x27;Morpheus&#x27;. He is inexperienced in government of the Dreaming and relies on Matthew for advice. As Dream, Daniel is a gentler and more merciful lord than Morpheus.

Daniel was named in accordance with Neil Gaiman&#x27;s decision to give the Endless names or titles beginning with the letter &#x27;D&#x27;, and after the Biblical prophet who interpreted dreams. Whereas Morpheus almost always wears black, Daniel robes himself in white. Morpheus&#x27; garments also tended to be styled with a flame motif, while Daniel&#x27;s are often adorned with floral patterns. Daniel is unable to convince Fiddler&#x27;s Green to return to the Dreaming but otherwise recreates the entire land, including its populace, as it was before.

Daniel has appeared from time to time in other Vertigo series. He was often identified, and infrequently appeared, in &quot;The Dreaming&quot; by Caitlin Kiernan. He appeared in &quot;Lucifer&quot;: in Nirvana, helping Lucifer track an enemy, and in &quot;The Sandman Presents: The Furies&quot;, in which he met his mortal mother for the first time since &quot;The Wake&quot;.

Within the main DC Universe, Daniel has made guest appearances in &quot;JLA&quot; #22–23, in which he helped save the Earth from Starro and in which he repaid the &#x27;debt&#x27; his predecessor had owed the Justice League. He also assured Kyle Rayner that he had surpassed Hal Jordan and will continue to do so. Daniel next appeared in a handful of issues of &quot;JSA&quot; in which he, among other things, transferred the prophetic dreams from Wesley Dodds to Sandy Hawkins. In another appearance, he prevents the time-traveling villain Per Degaton from tormenting his parents. Still later in the series, Daniel, in the form of a magic mirror, tells Hector Hall (reincarnated as Doctor Fate) and Lyta about Sand, who is trapped in a dream world created, again, by Brute and Glob. Daniel brought the spirits of his mortal parents to live in the Dreaming after their deaths.

Dream Girl tells Doctor Destiny that she foresaw his death, being tortured in his sleep by &quot;the owner of the dreamstone&quot;.

Daniel appears in &quot;Dark Nights: Metal&quot; a crossover written by Scott Snyder, with Neil Gaiman&#x27;s blessing.

==Characteristics==
===Appearance===
Dream of the Endless usually appears as a tall, thin man with bone-white skin, black hair, and two stars in place of eyes. Most often they are silver, blue, or white, but when he becomes angered, they have been shown to turn red. Dream&#x27;s appearance ranges widely: people generally perceive him in a style of dress appropriate to their region and era. In the Dreaming, he is often seen wearing a grey T-shirt and dark pants. He appears to be light-skinned when interacting with similar characters, but the people of &quot;Tales in the Sand&quot;&#x27;s primordial African city see him as dark. He appears as a huge black cat when speaking to the lonely Siamese cat-pilgrim of &quot;Dream of a Thousand Cats&quot; and as a cat-headed god when addressing the Egyptian feline goddess Bast. Martian Manhunter sees Dream in the shape of a flaming Martian skull and identifies him as Lord L&#x27;Zoril; but Mister Miracle, looking at him simultaneously, sees him as a man. In &quot;Season of Mists&quot;, he appears in the same form to all the Gods (Bast comments: &quot;I much prefer you in cat form, Dream old friend&quot;). In &quot;The Dream Hunters&quot;, set in ancient Japan, Dream appears as a Japanese man to a Buddhist monk and as a fox to a fox spirit. He customarily wears a billowing black cape, sometimes with a flame motif. In battle he wears a helmet made from the skull and backbone of a defeated enemy. This &quot;helm&quot;, which resembles a World War II-era gas mask, is also his sigil in the galleries of the other Endless, as well as appearing in the dreams (and at least once on the staircase wall) of Wesley Dodds. His face and physique are based on an amalgamation of Neil Gaiman in his twenties, The Cure&#x27;s frontman Robert Smith, and ballet dancer Farukh Ruzimatov. Dream&#x27;s face and appearance are also based on Bauhaus frontman Peter Murphy. In fact, Gaiman explained that Murphy was the original model for Dream. Gaiman also stated that Sandman artist Dave McKean based Dream&#x27;s face in the cover of Sandman #1 on Peter Murphy.

===Speech===
Dream&#x27;s speech is usually portrayed as white text in black, wavy-edged speech bubbles bordered in white. The text is capitalized normally (sentence case), in stark contrast to other characters&#x27; speech, generally in block caps text.

===Aliases===
Throughout the series, Dream is referred to by various aliases, including Morpheus, Oneiros, the Shaper, the Shaper of Form, Lord of the Dreaming, the Dream King, Dream-Sneak, the Cat of Dreams, Murphy, Kai&#x27;ckul and Lord L&#x27;Zoril, who is the anthropomorphic personification of dreams.

===Personality===
Although he is ultimately a heroic character, Dream is sometimes slow to understand humor, occasionally insensitive, often self-obsessed, and very slow to forgive a slight. He has a long history of failed amours, and is both shown and implied to have reacted harshly to the women therein. Both his mother, Night, and his siblings have commented that Dream has always wanted and always failed at finding a partner. As Mervyn Pumpkinhead remarks: &quot;He&#x27;s gotta be the tragic figure standing out in the rain, mournin&#x27; the loss of his beloved. So down comes the rain, right on cue. In the meantime everybody gets dreams full of existential angst and wakes up feeling like hell. And we all get wet&quot;. Near the end of the &quot;Brief Lives&quot; story arc, Desire says of Dream: &quot;He&#x27;s stuffy, stupid, and thinks he knows everything, and there&#x27;s just something about him that gets on my nerves&quot;. There is a long-standing enmity between Dream and Desire, stemming from Desire&#x27;s possible involvement in the failure of one of Dream&#x27;s amours (seen in &quot;Endless Nights&quot;). It is implied that before his imprisonment he was crueler and more blind to his flaws, and much of &quot;The Sandman&quot; is focused on his desire to atone for his past behavior (e.g., helping past lovers Calliope and Nada). Dream reacts strongly to perceived insult; he banishes Nada to Hell for rejecting him and expresses outrage when Hob Gadling suggests that he seeks companionship.

Dream is constantly aware of his responsibilities, both to other people and to his territory, and is detailed and exacting in their fulfillment (as noted in &quot;Season of Mists&quot;, where he is described thus: &quot;Of all the Endless, save perhaps Destiny, he is most conscious of his responsibilities, the most meticulous in their execution&quot;). Conversely, he also uses his responsibilities as an excuse to avoid change and other things he does not want to do. He shares a close, reciprocal bond of dependence and trust with his elder sister, Death. He consistently strives for understanding of himself and of the other Endless, but is ultimately defeated by his inability to accept change: in &quot;The Wake&quot;, when asked (by Matthew, the raven), &quot;Why did it happen? Why did he let it happen?&quot;, Lucien remarks: &quot;Charitably... I think... sometimes, perhaps, one must change or die. And in the end, there were, perhaps, limits to how much he could let himself change&quot;. However, Death suspects Dream allowed himself to become vulnerable to the Kindly Ones (by leaving his realm, when summoned by a fairy). This would imply Dream accepted change enough to knowingly and willingly allow himself to be killed and reborn as another aspect of himself - a different one. One might argue, however, that this whole &quot;die and be replaced by the Daniel version of himself&quot; plot was just Dream playing his own role, as he already knew some of it would happen, when he met the Daniel Dream and retrieved the Saeculum (both events happening in The Sandman Overture). Thus, the change was maybe never an option, but an imperative.

Dream is noted in &quot;Season of Mists&quot; as &quot;accumulating names to himself as others make friends, but he permits himself few friends&quot;. He is given more names in &quot;The Sandman&quot; than any of the other Endless, beyond the many translations of &quot;Dream&quot;.

Despite his narcissism and pride, Dream has a strong sense of honor. He repeatedly risks his life to make amends for a past wrong, despite not needing to do so (though, this was only after Death pointed out how horribly he had behaved) and continues on his search with Delirium despite his aversion to doing so, feeling it was unjust their human guide died without knowing anything of their quest.

==The Dreaming==
Dream lives in a castle at the heart of his realm called &quot;The Dreaming&quot;. Both the castle and the rest of his realm are mutable and change often, often at his will, although his resistance to change (and difficulty changing) is a theme throughout the series. Dream maintains both the castle and the realm, as with all aspects of his appearance, in a half-accommodating, half-terrifying state, simultaneously acknowledging both the courtesy due to others and the attention due him as the realm&#x27;s master, and indeed the pleasantness and terror of dreams themselves. On top of his castle are the Gate Keepers consisting of a wyvern, a griffin, and a hippogriff who intercept any dreamers that want to enter Dream&#x27;s castle.

Dream is the only one of the Endless known to populate his realm with speaking characters: a multitude of dreams and nightmares he has created, as well as entities from other realms. These include the narrators from older DC horror comics, including Cain and Abel, and Fiddler&#x27;s Green, who emulates G. K. Chesterton in human form. Dream recruits or creates (or re-creates) servants to perform roles he could easily carry out himself, including the reorganization of the castle and the guarding of its entrance. Although this is not stated in the series, Gaiman has said that he &quot;always assumed&quot; Dream had once been alone in the Dreaming and that he populated it for want of company.

Other than Dream himself, the most important inhabitant of the Dreaming is Lucien, the first of Dream&#x27;s ravens and now the Librarian of the Dreaming. Dream gives Lucien authority over the Dreaming on several occasions. The character originally appeared in the 1970s DC comic &quot;Tales of Ghost Castle&quot;, which lasted for only three issues (and was apparently killed off in &quot;Secrets of Haunted House&quot; #44). Lucien and Cain have a similar appearance as both were originally created by the same artist.

Other notable inhabitants include:
* A pumpkin-headed scarecrow named Mervyn who assists with the physical maintenance of the Dreaming.
* A Faery named Nuala who has unrequited affections for Dream and who plays an unwitting part in his downfall.
* A raven named Matthew who travels through the waking world on errands for Dream, usually as a scout or spy. Matthew was formerly a mortal man (Matthew Cable) and a character in DC Comics&#x27; &quot;Swamp Thing&quot;, who died in the Dreaming. Gaiman used Matthew as a way to explain some background information to the readers.

The Dreaming is at any moment also full of all creatures dreaming at that moment, although these seldom appear in the comics panel. Several comics in DC&#x27;s &quot;Vertigo&quot; line have been set in the Dreaming, most notably a series of the same name (chief author Alisa Kwitney).

==In other media==
* Dream appears in &quot;The Sandman&quot; (2020), voiced by James McAvoy.
* Dream appears in &quot;The Sandman&quot; (2022), portrayed by Tom Sturridge. Additionally, Ernest Kingsley Jr. portrays him in his Kai&#x27;ckul form.

<text>Bachelor Mother (1939) is an American romantic comedy film directed by Garson Kanin, and starring Ginger Rogers, David Niven, and Charles Coburn. The screenplay was written by Norman Krasna from an Academy Award-nominated story by Felix Jackson (a.k.a. Felix Joachimson) written for the 1935 Austrian-Hungarian film &quot;Little Mother&quot;. With a plot full of mistaken identities, &quot;Bachelor Mother&quot; is a light-hearted treatment of the otherwise serious issues of child abandonment.

It was remade in 1956 as &quot;Bundle of Joy&quot;, starring Debbie Reynolds and Eddie Fisher, and inspired the Bollywood film &quot;Kunwara Baap&quot;.

== Plot ==
Polly Parrish moved to New York City to seek more opportunities and works as seasonal temporary help in a large department store, Merlin&#x27;s. She receives notice that her position will be terminated after the Christmas season and she will not be kept on. Walking home, she sees a stranger leaving a baby on the steps of an orphanage. To protect the baby from the cold, Polly takes it inside. The orphanage staff offer Polly assistance and aid so she can keep the baby, because the immediate mutual fondness between Polly and the baby convinces the orphanage staff that Polly is the mother, despite her many protests. Polly leaves the baby in their care, but not before she gave them her name and informed them she was being laid off from Merlin&#x27;s department store.

Supposing Polly was driven to abandon her child after losing her job, the orphanage director searches out David, the playboy son of the store&#x27;s owner, J.B. Merlin, and requests that he re-hire Polly. David arranges for Polly to have a permanent position, a raise, and offers the company&#x27;s full support. Polly&#x27;s delight at keeping her job turns to baffled confusion when the orphanage attendants deliver the baby to her as part of her position.

Frustrated that no one is listening when she explains the baby is not hers, Polly takes the baby to David&#x27;s home and leaves the child with his butler to sort out. Polly departs for a dance competition she entered with Freddie, a flirtatious stockboy at the store. An enraged David storms after her, baby in tow, only to be mistaken for a jealous husband and thrown out of the competition. In the height of fury over what he believes is a mother abandoning her baby to have fun in night clubs, David threatens Polly that she must take care of the child properly, or find herself fired, denied a recommendation, and blacklisted by every employer in the city.

Unable to convince anyone that she is not the mother, and threatened by David with persecution if she does not assume that role, Polly gives up, invents an abusive past lover, names the baby &quot;John&quot;, and starts raising him.

Mrs. Weiss, Polly&#x27;s landlady, provides baby equipment and offers to take care of the boy when Polly is working, and Polly quickly comes to love the child.

David increasingly finds himself reaching out to interact with Polly, bringing her and John gifts, stopping for visits, and talking together, growing genuinely fond of Polly&#x27;s company and their compatible wit and enjoying sharing in John&#x27;s care.

Freddie, who witnessed David&#x27;s behavior at the dance competition, mistakenly believes Polly is David&#x27;s mistress and John their child. This misconception of the situation between David and Polly is worsened when Freddie&#x27;s own seniority warrants his promotion, which he mistakenly credits to Polly putting in a good word for him with David. Freddie later loses this promotion when he mistakes David for a shoplifter and attacks David in an overeager show of authority.

New Year&#x27;s Eve arrives, and David has no date for a high society party. To save face, David turns to Polly. He orders luxurious clothes and mink furs to be sent from the store and takes Polly to the party, playing a prank on the other guests that she cannot speak English and David must act as her interpreter. The pair leave and have a romantic evening, dampened only by the recollection of John, whose existence makes David hesitate. David does not feel ready to commit to a woman with a baby, though he wants to keep seeing them.

Embittered by his lost promotion, Freddie attempts to blackmail David by sending an anonymous note to J.B., saying that David has a secret child. J.B. is delighted with this news. He had despaired of playboy David ever settling down and providing him with grandchildren. J.B. stalks David and sees him meet up with Polly and John in a park.

David ends up in the same position Polly was: J.B. thinks that John is David&#x27;s baby and will not believe any protests to the contrary. J.B. demands that David marry Polly. If David refuses, J.B. threatens to seize John&#x27;s custody through legal means. David rushes to warn Polly about the threat and insist that she produce John&#x27;s real father (of whom he is jealous) so J.B. can understand what is going on. David ends up hurting and insulting Polly when he derides J.B.&#x27;s demand that he marry her as ridiculous. He regrets his words, but Polly makes him leave.

Polly is anxious over J.B.&#x27;s threat to bring in lawyers and investigate, since she has grown to love John and this will expose that she is not the mother. She decides to flee, but the landlady proposes an alternative solution. Polly visits J.B. with Mrs. Weiss&#x27;s adult son posing as her husband. Crushed, J.B. is about to accept that he misunderstood the situation, when David appears, dragging Freddie. David has bribed Freddie into playing the role of John&#x27;s father.

David attacks Mrs. Weiss&#x27;s son in jealousy, Freddie breaks and declares David the father, and J.B. is now more convinced than ever that David is the father. In the chaos, Polly disappears and tries to flee with John. David becomes terrified that he lost Polly and John forever. When he finds her, David confesses his love and declares to J.B. that he is John&#x27;s father, and that he intends to marry Polly.

== Cast ==

== Production ==
The film was a remake of the 1935 Hungarian film &quot;Little Mother&quot; from Joe Pasternak and Henry Koster which was never screened in the US.

In November 1938 RKO announced &quot;Little Mother&quot; would star Ginger Rogers. It would be the first film produced at the studio by Buddy de Sylva. The film replaced &quot;Perfect Honeymoon&quot; and &quot;She Married for Money&quot; in Rogers&#x27; schedule at RKO.

Louis Hayward was originally announced as the male lead. Then RKO announced Cary Grant would play the role. A few days later RKO announced Grant was replaced by James Ellison. In January 1939 RKO announced Garson Kanin, who had impressed with &quot;A Man to Remember&quot;, would direct and Norman Krasna was writing the script. A few days later the studio said the male lead was played by Douglas Fairbanks Jr. In March RKO said Fairbanks Jr would make &quot;The Sun Never Sets&quot; at Universal instead and his role would be played by David Niven who had been borrowed from Sam Goldwyn.

The film had a number of titles. RKO disliked &quot;Little Mother&quot; and the Hays Office had objections to alternatives they proposed, &quot;Bachelor Mother&quot; and &quot;Baby Trouble&quot;. Garson Kanin wanted to call it &quot;Baby Makes Three&quot; but producer Buddy De Sylva overruled him.

== Reception ==
=== Box office ===
The film was a big hit and earned RKO a profit of $827,000.

== Adaptations to other media ==
&quot;Bachelor Mother&quot; was adapted as a radio play on several occasions, including five broadcasts of &quot;The Screen Guild Theater&quot;: the first starred Laraine Day, Henry Fonda and Charles Coburn (February 1, 1942); the second starred Ann Sothern and Fred MacMurray (November 23, 1942); the third starred Ginger Rogers, Francis X. Bushman and David Niven (May 6, 1946); the fourth starred Lucille Ball, Joseph Cotten and Charles Coburn (April 28, 1949); the fifth starred Ann Sothern and Robert Stack (April 20, 1952). It was also adapted as an hour-long play on &quot;Lux Radio Theater&quot; with Ginger Rogers and Fredric March (January 22, 1940) and on &quot;Screen Director&#x27;s Playhouse&quot; with Lucille Ball and Robert Cummings (March 8, 1951).

<doc id="79849" wikidata="Q605051" url="?curid=79849" title="Touraine">
<text>Touraine (; ) is one of the traditional provinces of France. Its capital was Tours. During the political reorganization of French territory in 1790, Touraine was divided between the departments of Indre-et-Loire, :Loir-et-Cher, Indre and Vienne.

==Geography==
Traversed by the river Loire and its tributaries the Cher, the Indre and the Vienne, Touraine makes up a part of the western Paris Basin. It is well known for its viticulture. The TGV high-speed train system, which connects Tours with Paris (200 kilometers away) in just over an hour, has made Touraine a place of residence for people who work in the French capital but seek a different quality of life.

==History==
Touraine takes its name from a Celtic tribe called the Turones, who inhabited the region about two thousand years ago. 
In 1044, the control of Touraine was given to the Angevins, who (as the House of Plantagenet) became kings of England in 1154, the castle of Chinon being their greatest stronghold. In 1205, Philip II Augustus of France regained Touraine. At this time, Touraine was made into a royal duchy. In 1429, Saint Joan of Arc had a historic meeting with the future King of France Charles VII at Chinon. Throughout the late 15th and 16th centuries, Touraine was a favorite residence of French kings, and the dark and gloomy castles were converted to Renaissance châteaux; for this reason the region was titled &quot;The Garden of France&quot;. These same châteaux became popular tourist attractions in modern times. The royal duchy became a province in 1584, and was divided into departments in 1790.

==Notable people==
* Peter des Roches (died 1238), Bishop of Winchester.
* François Rabelais (ca.1483-1553), a Renaissance writer and humanist, physician, monk and Greek scholar. 
* René Descartes (1596–1650), a French philosopher, scientist and mathematician.
* Jean Thurel (1698–1807), a fusilier of the French Army and centenarian
* Alfred de Vigny (1797–1863), a French poet and early French Romanticist.
* Honoré de Balzac (1799–1850), a French novelist and playwright.
* René Boylesve (1867–1926), a French writer and literary critic.

<doc id="79851" wikidata="Q2140856" url="?curid=79851" title="Safe, sane and consensual">
<text>The fundamental principles for the exercise of BDSM require that it be performed with the informed consent of all parties. Since the 1980s, many practitioners and organizations have adopted the motto safe, sane and consensual, commonly abbreviated &quot;SSC&quot;, which means that everything is based on safe activities, that all participants are of sufficiently sound mind in their conduct, and that all participants do consent. It is mutual consent that makes a clear legal and ethical distinction between BDSM and such crimes as sexual assault and domestic violence.

Some BDSM practitioners prefer a code of behavior that differs from SSC. Described as &quot;risk-aware consensual kink&quot; (RACK), this code shows a preference for a style in which the &quot;individual&quot; responsibility of the involved parties is emphasized more strongly, with each participant being responsible for their own well-being. Advocates of RACK argue that SSC can hamper discussion of risk because no activity is truly &quot;safe&quot;, and that discussion of even low-risk possibilities is necessary for truly informed consent.

Still other BDSM practitioners prefer a code of behavior described as &quot;Personal Responsibility, Informed, Consensual Kink&quot; (PRICK).

<doc id="79860" wikidata="Q4941347" url="?curid=79860" title="Bondage pornography">
<text>Bondage pornography, also referred to as bondage erotica is the depiction of sexual bondage or other BDSM activities using photographs, stories, films or drawings. Though often described as pornography, the genre involves the presentation of bondage fetishism or BDSM scenarios and does not necessarily involve the commonly understood pornographic styles. In fact, the genre is primarily interested with the presentation of a bondage scene and less with depictions of sexuality, such as nudity or sex scenes, which may be viewed as a distraction from the aesthetics and eroticism of the sex scenario itself.

Historically, most subjects of bondage imagery have been women, and the genre has been criticized for promoting misogynistic attitudes and violence against women.

==Magazines and comics ==
===Variety===
In the early 20th century, bondage imagery was available through &quot;detective magazines&quot;, and comic books often featured characters being tied up or tying others up, particularly in &quot;damsel in distress&quot; plots.

There were also a number of dedicated fetish magazines which featured images of fetishism and bondage. The first of such magazines in the United States was &quot;Bizarre&quot;, first published in 1946 by fetish photographer John Willie (the phallic pseudonym of John Coutts), who developed the concept in the 1920s. Willie was able to avoid controversy in censorship through careful attention to guidelines and the use of humor. Publication of &quot;Bizarre&quot; was suspended completely from 1947 to 1951 because of post-War paper shortages. By 1956 Willie was ready to give up the magazine, and in that year he sold it to someone described only as R.E.B., who published six more issues before &quot;Bizarre&quot; finally folded in 1959.

Willie is better remembered for his &quot;Sweet Gwendoline&quot; comic strips, in which Gwendoline is drawn as a rather naïve blonde &quot;damsel in distress&quot;, with ample curves, who is unfortunate enough to find herself tied up in scene after scene by the raven-haired dominatrix and the mustachioed villain &quot;Sir Dystic D&#x27;Arcy&quot;. She is rescued and also repeatedly tied up (though for benevolent reasons) by secret agent U-69 (censored to U89 in some editions). The comic strips were published largely in the 1950s and 60s. The story was published as a piecemeal serial, appearing usually two pages at a time in several different magazines over the years.

Though &quot;Bizarre&quot; was a small format magazine, it had a huge impact on later kink publications, such as ENEG&#x27;s fetish magazine, &quot;Exotique&quot;, published 1956–1959. &quot;Exotique&quot; was entirely devoted to fetish fashions and female-dominant bondage fantasies. The 36 issues featured photos and illustrations of dominatrix-inspired vamps (including Burtman&#x27;s wife Tana Louise and iconic model Bettie Page) wearing exotic leather and rubber ensembles, corsets, stockings/garters, boots, and high heels. Gene Bilbrew contributed illustrations to the magazine. The articles, many written by Leonard Burtman, using an alias, covered various aspects of sadomasochism and transvestism, with men depicted as slaves to imperious, all-powerful women. &quot;Exotique&quot; had no nudity, pornographic content, or even sexually suggestive situations. Nevertheless, much like fellow publisher Irving Klaw, in 1957, Burtman would be targeted as a pornographer. He was relentlessly pursued by the U.S. Postal Inspection Service (acting as a censorship agency under the Comstock laws) and local law enforcement (which functioned in coordination with Postal Inspectors and the Catholic Church). Eventually, he was arrested, his magazines and materials confiscated, and brought to trial. This led to the demise of the magazine in 1959. However, starting in 1960, Burtman (under a different imprint) would go on to publish many more fetish magazines that were nearly identical to &quot;Exotique&quot; such as &quot;New Exotique&quot;, &quot;Masque&quot;, &quot;Connoisseur&quot;, &quot;Bizarre Life&quot;, &quot;High Heels&quot;, &quot;Unique World&quot;, &quot;Corporal&quot; (a pioneering spanking-fetish magazine) and others well into the 1970s.

New York photographer Irving Klaw also published illustrated adventure/bondage serials by fetish artists Eric Stanton, Gene Bilbrew, Adolfo Ruiz and others. Klaw is best known for operating an international mail-order business selling photographs and film of attractive women (sometimes in bondage) from the 1940s to the 1960s. His most famous bondage model was Bettie Page, who became the first celebrity of bondage film and photography.

These publications disappeared for a time with a crackdown on pornography in the late 1950s.

===Resurgence of bondage magazines===
Dedicated bondage magazines again became popular in America in the 1970s. From the mid-1970s through the late 1990s, they were produced by publishers such as Harmony Concepts, California Star, and House of Milan. House of Milan, owned and run by Barbara Behr, was one of the most influential publishers and distributors of BDSM erotica in this period. The company was based in southern California, one of a number of pornographic magazine and film companies working in the Los Angeles area. In the mid-1980s, House of Milan was sold by Behr who went on to work for California Star. House of Milan was subsequently owned by Lyndon Distributors.

House of Milan was a mail-order business that distributed up to 30 similarly themed titles, producing three or four magazines a month. Most of the images in the magazines depicted women, either alone or together. They focussed on straight male bondage fantasies and also had a lesbian audience. Some of the best-known titles were &quot;Bound to Please&quot;, &quot;Knotty&quot;, and &quot;Hogtie&quot;. House of Milan eventually expanded from books and magazines into home videos. The products were not generally available through mainstream distributors, though they were sold in sex shops in addition to being available through mail order. They contained little advertising content, and funding was entirely dependent on sales.

Typically, each magazine consisted of several multi-page pictorials of tied-up women, often with a fictional narrative attached, and one fictional story of three or four pages in length. Sometimes pictorials were replaced by artwork by a fetish artist or included an interview with one of the performers in the industry. In the case of House of Milan and Lyndon Distributors, the magazines were simply illustrated text versions of videos published by the same title. Such practice cut costs and allowed a streamlined output of material.

Another type of magazine was the &quot;compendium magazine&quot;, usually consisting of a large number of individual photographs drawn from previous magazines, without any linking story.

Because of their relatively small circulation, compared with mainstream pornography, most bondage magazines were printed in black and white, except for the cover and centerfold. In the 1980s and 1990s, experiments were made with adding more color content, but most magazine content remained black and white.

The attitude of some of the early magazines could be regarded as misogynistic by feminists, in spite of editorial disclaimers that the magazines represented only fantasies, as the storylines deviated from the old-fashioned &quot;damsel in distress&quot; motif towards more restrictive and explicit BDSM practices. However, in reality the opposite effect often happened: as a bondage performer was cast in more material and engaged in more acts, she would often develop a stronger fan base and became a recognized star in her own right. Nikki Dial and Ashley Renee are two examples of performers who won awards for their work as subs in bondage videos, and typically endured the most onscreen punishment.

In the 1990s, as homosexuality and bi-sexuality began to be more socially accepted, magazine publishers started to produce femdom material depicting men in bondage, as well as portraying female models as participants in mutually satisfying bondage games, usually with at least one actress performing as a dom and at least one as a sub. Sometimes, the roles of dom and sub would be reversed. Be Be LeBadd and Alexis Payne are two professional dominatrices who also sometimes found themselves on the receiving end of a whip.

==Websites and imagery in mainstream pornography==

From the late 1990s onwards, specialist BDSM pornographic websites such as Insex and the various websites of Kink.com appeared. As Internet pornography became more widely available, the bondage magazine market began to decrease. As of 2003, specialist bondage magazines were mostly displaced by bondage material on the Internet, and bondage imagery is to be found in mainstream pornographic magazines, such as &quot;Nugget&quot; and &quot;Hustler&quot;&#x27;s &quot;Taboo&quot; magazine.

However, the tradition of bondage magazines continues in the form of &quot;art books&quot; of bondage photographs, published by mainstream publishers such as Taschen.

Certain websites have begun providing bondage videos and photographs featuring the kidnapping roleplay, which has been largely the hallmark of &quot;detective&quot; style bondage magazines. These styles are much closer to the style of bondage scenes in mainstream television.

==Criticism==
As the availability of free pornography on the Internet has increased, its possible effects on microaggression towards women have been discussed. The concern has been raised that since bondage pornography mostly depicts women (who are portrayed primarily in situations of female submission), such pornography may promote an attitude legitimising violence against women.

The book series and film &quot;50 Shades of Grey&quot; has been said to perpetuate misogyny and portray BDSM/bondage subcultures in a patriarchal and misogynistic light. In this view, to properly reflect the BDSM/bondage subculture it is necessary for pornography to &quot;focus on mutual consent, mutual power, and communication,&quot; as in the film &quot;50 Shades of Dylan Ryan&quot;.

<doc id="79861" wikidata="Q858237" url="?curid=79861" title="Constant term">
<text>In mathematics, a constant term (sometimes referred to as a free term) is a term in an algebraic expression that does not contain any variables and therefore is constant. For example, in the quadratic polynomial,
:formula_1
The number 3 is a constant term.

After like terms are combined, an algebraic expression will have at most one constant term. Thus, it is common to speak of the quadratic polynomial
:formula_2
where formula_3 is the variable, as having a constant term of formula_4 If the constant term is 0, then it will conventionally be omitted when the quadratic is written out.

Any polynomial written in standard form has a unique constant term, which can be considered a coefficient of formula_5 In particular, the constant term will always be the lowest degree term of the polynomial. This also applies to multivariate polynomials. For example, the polynomial
:formula_6
has a constant term of −4, which can be considered to be the coefficient of formula_7 where the variables are eliminated by being exponentiated to 0 (any non-zero number exponentiated to 0 becomes 1). For any polynomial, the constant term can be obtained by substituting in 0 instead of each variable; thus, eliminating each variable. The concept of exponentiation to 0 can be applied to power series and other types of series, for example in this power series:
:formula_8
formula_9 is the constant term.

==Constant of integration==
The derivative of a constant term is 0, so when a term containing a constant term is differentiated, the constant term vanishes, regardless of its value. Therefore the antiderivative is only determined up to an unknown constant term, which is called &quot;the constant of integration&quot; and added in symbolic form (usually denoted as formula_10).

For example, the antiderivative of formula_11 is formula_12, since the derivative of formula_12 is equal to formula_11 based on the properties of trigonometric derivatives. 

However, the &quot;integral&quot; of formula_11 is equal to formula_12 (the antiderivative), plus an arbitrary constant:

formula_17

because for any constant formula_10, the derivative of the right-hand side of the equation is equal to the left-hand side of the equation.

<doc id="79863" wikidata="Q1291435" url="?curid=79863" title="John Willie">
<text>John Alexander Scott Coutts (9 December 1902 – 5 August 1962), better known by the pseudonym John Willie, was an artist, fetish photographer, cartoonist, and the publisher and editor of the first 23 issues of the fetish magazine &quot;Bizarre&quot; between 1946 and 1956, featuring his characters Sweet Gwendoline and Sir Dystic d&#x27;Arcy. Though distributed underground, &quot;Bizarre&quot; magazine had a far-reaching impact on later fetish-themed publications and experienced a resurgence in popularity, along with fetish model Bettie Page, beginning in the 1970s.

== Early life ==
John Alexander Scott Coutts was born on 9 December 1902 in what was then British Singapore to a British family, who returned to the United Kingdom in 1903. Coutts grew up in a middle class family and attended Royal Military College, Sandhurst. Commissioned as a Second Lieutenant into the Royal Scots, Coutts was forced to resign in 1925 when he married a night-club hostess, Eveline Fisher, without the permission of his commanding officer. He migrated with his wife to Brisbane, Australia in 1926; their marriage, however, ended in divorce in 1930.

Coutts joined a local High Heel Club, where he was probably introduced to the print media of a community of &quot;shoe lovers&quot; and other fetishists. He met his future second wife, Holly Anna Faram, in 1936 and the couple married in 1942. She became his muse and often modelled for him.

==Early career==
Coutts&#x27; access to the High Heel Club&#x27;s mailing list allowed him to begin producing and selling his own illustrations and photographs. He worked at a variety of jobs as well as pursuing his hobby, and eventually established a company to produce exotic footwear called &quot;Achilles&quot;. In 1945, he moved to North America while Holly chose to remain in Australia, where she died in 1983 at the age of 70. He wished to settle in New York but was forced to remain in Montreal, Canada for a year or so because of immigration issues.

==Magazine publishing &quot;Bizarre&quot;==

&quot;Bizarre&quot; magazine began in late 1945, while Coutts was living in Canada. He published the magazine under the pseudonym of &quot;John Willie&quot;, a name he kept for the duration of his career. Willie was introduced to the American fetish underground by Charles Guyette and later worked with Irving Klaw, the infamous BDSM merchandiser later charged with obscenity, but he is best known for his fetish cartoon character Sweet Gwendoline, which he drew in a style that influenced later artists such as Gene Bilbrew and Eric Stanton. Other characters include U69 (censored to U89 in some editions), the raven-haired dominatrix who ties up Gwendoline and Sir Dystic d&#x27;Arcy, the only prominent male character and probably a parody of Willie himself. &quot;Sweet Gwendoline&quot; was published as a serial in Robert Harrison&#x27;s mainstream girlie magazine &quot;Wink&quot; from June 1947 to February 1950 and later in several other magazines over the years.

&quot;Bizarre&quot; was published, at irregular intervals, from 1946 to 1959. Despite the nature of the magazine, Coutts was able to circumvent censorship and orders to cease publication because he was careful to avoid &quot;nudity, homosexuality, overt violence, or obvious depictions of things that might be read as perverse or immoral and that might rankle those parties who were capable of banning, censoring or blocking the magazine&#x27;s circulation.&quot; The magazine included many photographs, often of Willie&#x27;s wife, and drawings of costume designs, some based on ideas from readers. There were also many letters from readers: he was accused of inventing these but insisted that they were genuine. These letters covered topics such as high heels, bondage, amputee fetishism, sadomasochism, transvestism, corsets, and body modification. The magazine was suspended completely from 1947 to 1951. By 1956, Coutts was ready to give up the magazine and that year he sold it to someone described only as R.E.B., who published six more issues before &quot;Bizarre&quot; finally folded in 1959. There was no mention within the magazine that it had changed hands, but in issue no. 23 Mahlon Blaine was introduced by the editor as the artist who was to replace Willie as the primary illustrator.
After publishing the first 23 issues of &quot;Bizarre&quot;, Coutts moved to Hollywood, California, where in 1961 he developed a brain tumour and was forced to end his mail-order business. Destroying his archives and returning home to the British Isles, Coutts went to live with his sister who resided on the island of Guernsey. Whilst living with his sister, Coutts died in his sleep on the 5th August 1962.

== Publication elsewhere ==
Willie&#x27;s work was featured in the Japanese magazine &quot;Kitan Club&quot;, one of the few Western artists to do so.

==Legacy==
Willie was portrayed by Jared Harris in the movie &quot;The Notorious Bettie Page&quot; (2006), which featured a fictional meeting between Willie and Page.

In 2009, Willie was inducted into the Leather Hall of Fame.

==Quotations==
&quot;Unless a model is a good actress, and has &#x27;that type&#x27; of face, it&#x27;s difficult for her to look sad and miserable when working for me. My studio is a pretty cheerful place, and quite unlike the atmosphere that surrounds Gwendoline when the Countess gets hold of her.&quot;

&quot;Bizarre. The magazine for pleasant optimists who frown on convention. The magazine of fashions and fantasies fantastic! Innumerable journals deal with ideas for the majority. Must all sheeplike follow in their wake? Bizarre is for those who have the courage of their own convictions. Conservative? — Old fashioned? — Not by any means! Where does a complete circle begin or end? And doesn&#x27;t fashion move in a circle? Futuristic? Not even that—there is nothing new in fashion, it is only for the application of new materials—new ornaments—a new process of making—coupled with the taste and ability to create the unusual and unorthodox to the trend of the moment.&quot;

&quot;As for sex, ignorance is abysmal, because for centuries those who could not satisfy themselves, except by denying pleasure to others, have taught generation after generation that &quot;sex is taboo.&quot; Thou shalt not think about it or discuss it. In fact, it&#x27;s a dreadful thing, but it&#x27;s all right as long as you don&#x27;t enjoy it. If you have any other ideas on the subject, you are a pervert. The basis of a decent society is a happy home. Marriages break up almost invariably because of sex. What you do, or do not do, is your own business, all that matters is that the enjoyment be mutual, — and the time to discuss these things is before you get hitched up. There is a partner to suit everyone somewhere, but the search will be difficult until we can discuss our likes and dislikes, openly, in good taste, without threat from our own brand of standardized Police State.&quot;

<text>The Dutch government-in-exile (), also known as the London Cabinet (), was the government in exile of the Netherlands, supervised by Queen Wilhelmina, that fled to London after the German invasion of the country during World War II on 10 May 1940. The government had control over the Free Dutch Forces.

==Background and exile==

Until 1940, the Netherlands was a neutral country that was generally on good terms with Germany. On 10 May 1940, Germany invaded the Netherlands. Queen Wilhelmina fled the country aboard the British destroyer HMS &quot;Hereward&quot;, arriving in London on 13 May. The Dutch armed forces surrendered two days later as they had been unable to withstand the speed of Germany&#x27;s Blitzkrieg style attack. In London, the queen took charge of the Dutch government-in-exile, which was established at Stratton House in the Piccadilly area of London, opposite Green Park. Initially, their hope was that France would regroup and liberate the country. Although there was such an attempt, it soon failed, and the Allied forces were surrounded and forced to evacuate at Dunkirk. The Dutch armed forces in the Netherlands except for those occupying Zeeland surrendered on 15 May 1940. 

To safeguard the succession, the heir to the throne, Princess Juliana, along with her family, was sent farther away to Canada, where they spent the war.

The government-in-exile was soon faced with a dilemma. After France had been defeated, the Vichy French government came to power and proposed to Adolf Hitler a policy of collaboration. That led to a conflict between Prime Minister Dirk Jan de Geer and the Queen. De Geer wanted to return to the Netherlands and collaborate as well. The government-in-exile was still in control of the Dutch East Indies with all its resources and was the third-largest oil producer in the world, after the United States and the Soviet Union. Wilhelmina realized that if the Dutch collaborated with Germany, the Dutch East Indies would be surrendered to Japan, as French Indochina was surrendered later by orders of the Vichy government.

==Exile in London==

As the hope for liberation was now the entry of the Americans or the Soviet Union into the war, the Queen dismissed De Geer as prime minister. She replaced him with Pieter Sjoerds Gerbrandy, who worked with Churchill and Roosevelt on ways to smooth the path for an American entry. Aruba and Curaçao, with world-class exporting oil refineries, were important suppliers of refined products to the Allies. Aruba became a British protectorate from 1940 to 1942 and a US protectorate from 1942 to 1945. On 23 November 1941, under an agreement with the Dutch government-in-exile, the United States occupied Dutch Guiana to protect the bauxite mines. An oil boycott was imposed on Japan, which helped to spark the Pearl Harbor attack.

In September 1944, the Dutch, Belgian and the Luxembourgish governments in exile began formulating an agreement over the creation of a Benelux Customs Union. The agreement was signed in the London Customs Convention on 5 September 1944.

The Queen&#x27;s unusual action was later ratified by the States General of the Netherlands in 1946. Churchill called her &quot;the only man in the Dutch government&quot;. After World War II ended, Wilhelmina and her government returned from exile to re-establish a regime more democratic than ever before.

== &quot;Militair Gezag&quot; ==
In 1943, Dutch military officer Hendrik Johan Kruls was tasked with preparing a Dutch-led military administration in the Netherlands in the event that the allies would enter the country, known as the &quot;Militair Gezag&quot; (Military Authority). In June 1944, the allies landed in Normandy and re-opened the western front, and in the ensuing months gradually advanced to the Siegfried Line. On 12 September 1944, the allies crossed the Belgium–Netherlands border and Mesch became the first Dutch village to be liberated. Soon after on the 14th, the allies , marking the first Dutch urban city to fall in the hands of the allies. That same day the &quot;Militair Gezag&quot; was established in the Netherlands, with Maastricht as its capital and Kruls at its head, marking the return of the Dutch government to its own country, albeit under a military administration rather than an elected one. After the end of the war, the &quot;Militair Gezag&quot; was dissolved on 4 March 1946.

<doc id="79874" wikidata="Q191003" url="?curid=79874" title="Carloman I">
<text>Carloman I (28 June 751 – 4 December 771), German Karlmann, Karlomann, was king of the Franks from 768 until his death in 771. He was the second surviving son of Pepin the Short and Bertrada of Laon and was a younger brother of Charlemagne. His death allowed Charlemagne to take all of Francia.

==Split of the Frankish kingdom==

At the age of 3 he was, together with his father Pepin the Short and his elder brother Charlemagne, anointed King of the Franks and titled &quot;Patrician of the Romans&quot; by Pope Stephen II, who had left Rome to beg the Frankish King for assistance against the Lombards. Carloman and Charlemagne each inherited half of the Kingdom of the Franks upon Pepin&#x27;s death. His share was based in the centre of the Frankish Kingdom, with his capital at Soissons, and consisted of the Parisian basin, the Massif Central, the Languedoc, Provence, Burgundy, southern Austrasia, Alsace, and Alemannia; the regions were poorly integrated and surrounded by those bequeathed to Charlemagne, and, although Carloman&#x27;s territories were easier to defend than those of Charlemagne, they were also poorer in income.

It is commonly agreed that Carloman and Charlemagne disliked each other. However, the reasons behind this are unclear: some historians suggest that each brother considered himself rightfully to be the sole heir of their father – Charlemagne as the elder child, Carloman as the legitimate child (Charlemagne is sometimes claimed to have been born a bastard in 742, a claim not always accepted). Be that as it may, Pepin the Short&#x27;s disposal of his kingdom appears to have exacerbated the bad relations between the pair since it required cooperation between the pair and left both feeling cheated. 
==Competition with Charlemagne==
Carloman&#x27;s reign proved short and troublesome. The brothers shared possession of Aquitaine, which broke into rebellion upon the death of Pepin the Short; when Charlemagne campaigned to put down the revolt, Carloman led his own army to assist. The two quarreled at Moncontour, near Poitiers, and Carloman withdrew. This, it had been suggested, was an attempt to undermine Charlemagne&#x27;s power since the rebellion threatened Charlemagne&#x27;s rule. Charlemagne crushed the rebels, while Carloman&#x27;s behaviour damaged his standing amongst the Franks. Relations between the two then degenerated further, requiring the mediation of their mother, Bertrada, who appears to have favoured Charlemagne, with whom she would live out her widowhood.

Rosamond McKitterick has argued, however, that our assumption about the relationship between the two brothers can&#x27;t be based solely on a few examples and that there is no evidence to suggest that there was lasting animosity between the two. She also points out that Charlemagne showed great political pragmatism and astuteness throughout his reign and that it would have been in the brothers&#x27; common interest to work together to secure their dynasty&#x27;s control over the Franks, having only recently gained royal power. She also argues that it cannot be assumed that Bertrada favoured one son over the other, pointing out the meeting between Bertrada and Carloman in 770 at Seltz.

In 770, his mother Bertrada began a series of diplomatic offensives to encircle Carloman. Charlemagne had married Desiderata, the daughter of the Lombard king Desiderius in Italy, which created an alliance between Charlemagne and the Lombards; Bertrada had also secured for Charlemagne the friendship of his cousin Tassilo III of Bavaria; she had even attempted to secure Papal support for the marriage by arranging for Desiderius to cede certain territories to Rome, to which the Papacy laid claim. Although Pope Stephen III remained hostile to an alliance between the Franks and the Lombards in theory, in reality, he was deeply conflicted between the threat the Lombards posed to him and the chance to dispose of the anti-Lombard Christopher the &quot;Primicerius&quot;, the dominant figure at the Papal court.

These maneuvers had generally favoured the Franks but posed serious threats to Carloman&#x27;s position. He had been left without allies: he attempted to use his brother&#x27;s alliance with the Lombards to his advantage in Rome, offering his support against the Lombards to Stephen III and entering into secret negotiations with the &quot;Primicerius&quot;, Christopher, who had been isolated by the Franco-Lombard &quot;rapprochement&quot;; but after the murder of Christopher by Desiderius, Stephen III gave his support to the Lombards and Charlemagne. However, Carloman&#x27;s position was rescued by Charlemagne&#x27;s sudden repudiation of his Lombard wife, Desiderius&#x27; daughter. Desiderius, outraged and humiliated, appears to have allied with Carloman in opposition to Charlemagne and the Papacy, which took the opportunity to declare itself against the Lombards.

==Death and legacy==
Carloman died on 4 December 771 at the Villa of Samoussy; the death, sudden and convenient though it was, was set down to natural causes (a severe nosebleed is sometimes claimed as being at fault). At the time of his death, he and his brother Charlemagne were close to outright war, which Charlemagne&#x27;s biographer Einhard attributes to the miscounsel of Carloman&#x27;s advisors. Carloman was buried in Reims, but he was reburied in the Basilique Saint-Denis in the 13th century.

Carloman married a Frankish woman, Gerberga, who, according to Pope Stephen III, was chosen for him, together with Charlemagne&#x27;s concubine, Himiltrude, by Pepin the Short. With Gerberga, he had two sons, the older of whom was named Pepin after his grandfather, marking him according to Carolingian tradition as the heir of Carloman, and of Pepin the Short. After Carloman&#x27;s death, Gerberga expected her elder son to become king and for herself to rule as his regent; however, Carloman&#x27;s former supporters – his cousin Adalhard, Abbot Fulrad of Saint Denis and Count Warin – turned against her, and invited Charlemagne to annex Carloman&#x27;s territory, which he duly did. Gerberga then fled (according to Einhard, &quot;for no reason at all&quot;) with her sons and Count Autchar, one of Carloman&#x27;s faithful nobles, to the court of Desiderius, who demanded of the new Pope Hadrian I that he anoint Carloman&#x27;s sons as kings of the Franks. Gerberga&#x27;s flight ultimately precipitated Charlemagne&#x27;s destruction of the Kingdom of the Lombards; he responded to Desiderius&#x27; support of Carloman&#x27;s children, which threatened Charlemagne&#x27;s position, by sweeping into Italy and subjugating it. Desiderius and his family were captured, tonsured, and sent to Frankish religious houses; the fate of Gerberga and her children by Carloman is unknown, although it is possible that they, too, were sent by Charlemagne to monasteries and convents.

Despite their complex relationship and the events following Carloman&#x27;s death, Charlemagne would later name his second legitimate son &quot;Carloman&quot; after his deceased brother. This had, perhaps, been a public gesture to honour the boy&#x27;s uncle&#x27;s memory and quell any rumours about Charlemagne&#x27;s treatment of his nephews. If so, it was swept away in 781, when Charlemagne had his son renamed as Pepin.

== Family ==

He had several children with Gerberga.

<text>The Spitfire Boys were the first Liverpool punk band to release a single (&quot;British Refugee&quot; c/w &quot;Mein Kampf&quot;). The Spitfire Boys were mainly notable for including in their line-up Peter Clarke, who went on to drum for the Slits and later Siouxsie and the Banshees and the Creatures (as well as marrying Siouxsie) as Budgie, and Paul Rutherford, later better known for being a member of 1980s pop band Frankie Goes to Hollywood. Jones (a.k.a. guitarist David Littler) went on to join the Photons, which also included Steve Strange (Visage) and Vince Ely (the Psychedelic Furs).

== History ==
=== Liverpool era ===
In early 1977, David Littler saw the Heartbreakers live at Eric&#x27;s Club, in Liverpool, and asked them about a band he had, but really didn&#x27;t exist, and the group gave him a place to support them alongside Slaughter and the Dogs and Buzzcocks at Warrington Parr Hall, Warrington, Cheshire, in May. The band was formed shortly afterwards by Littler as guitarist, alongside his friends, bassist Peter Griffiths and lead vocalist Michael Rigby, and Steve Platt a drummer. A short time later, while preparing for the gig, the band changed their name to the Spitfire Boys as a suggestion of Wayne County. For their first gig at Warrington Parr Hall, they played covers of the Ramones.

After their debut gig, the band had their first drummer, Peter Clarke, then an art student and member of Albert Dock, later Yachts. With that new line-up, the band played their second gig at Eric&#x27;s Club. After that, the group sacked off Michael Rigby, who was replaced, as suggestion of Clarke, by Paul Rutherford.

They released their first single, &quot;British Refugee&quot; 7&quot;, on 7 October 1977, on RKO Records.

During the brief era of that line-up, they toured UK. They also supported the Prefects and the Slits (later Clarke&#x27;s band), and also played a gig with Holly Johnson.

In December, Pete Wylie (formerly of Crucial Three and The Mystery Girls) joined the band, but only for a few rehearsals. On 22 December 1977, the band split up, Clarke, Griffiths and Wylie formed the Nova Mob (along Julian Cope), and Paul Rutherford formed the Opium Eaters, while Littler moved to London in January 1978, where he joined the Photons, alongside Steve Strange (later Visage). Griffiths joined turned his back on the entire music scene, citing the growing trend in drug abuse, and general disillusionment as his reasons.

In July 2006, the band had &quot;British Refugee&quot; re-released on a Korova Records compilation album, entitled &quot;North by Northwest&quot;, which was compiled by Paul Morley.

=== Wales era ===
After Littler disbanded the short-lived Photons, he moved to Cardiff, Wales, in October 1978, where he formed a band, the White Boys, but changed their name to the Spitfire Boys, as pressure by a financer of the band, who thought the name would sell better. That time, the line-up was formed by Littler (as David Francis) on vocals and guitar, and former Nylonz members Peter Millman on guitar, Kurt Prasser on bass and Chris Brazier on drums. That alineation recorded and released the 7&quot; single, &quot;Funtime&quot; in 1979. In October 1979, the band moved to London, where they recorded some demos with RKO Records. By 1980, despite the interest of Major Label, they disbanded, and Littler joined White Brothers.

<doc id="79881" wikidata="Q283865" url="?curid=79881" title="Fsck">
<text>The system utility codice_1 (&quot;file system check&quot;) is a tool for checking the consistency of a file system in Unix and Unix-like operating systems, such as Linux, macOS, and FreeBSD. The equivalent programs on MS-DOS and Microsoft Windows are CHKDSK, SFC, and SCANDISK.

==Use==
Generally, fsck is run either automatically at boot time, or manually by the system administrator. The command works directly on data structures stored on disk, which are internal and specific to the particular file system in use - so an fsck command tailored to the file system is generally required. The exact behaviors of various fsck implementations vary, but they typically follow a common order of internal operations and provide a common command-line interface to the user. On modern systems, fsck simply detects the type of filesystem and calls the specialized (Linux) or (BSD, macOS) program for each type.

Most fsck utilities provide options for either interactively repairing damaged file systems (the user must decide how to fix specific problems), automatically deciding how to fix specific problems (so the user does not have to answer any questions), or reviewing the problems that need to be resolved on a file system without actually fixing them. Partially recovered files where the original file name cannot be reconstructed are typically recovered to a &quot;lost+found&quot; directory that is stored at the root of the file system.

A system administrator can also run fsck manually if they believe there is a problem with the file system. The file system is normally checked while unmounted, mounted read-only, or with the system in a special maintenance mode. 

=== Boot time ===
As boot time fsck is expected to run without user intervention, it generally defaults to not perform any destructive operations. This may be in the form of a read-only check (failing whenever issues are found), or more commonly, a &quot;preen&quot; mode that only fixes innocuous issues commonly found after an unclean shutdown (i.e. crash, power fail). 

ext2/3/4 offers an option to force a boot-time check after a specified number of mounts, so that periodic checking can be done.

Some modern file systems do not require fsck to be at boot after an unclean shutdown. Some examples are:
* XFS, a journaling file system. It has a dummy fsck which does nothing and an actual codice_2 tool to be run when problems are suspected.
* UFS2 file system in FreeBSD, which can delay the check to background if soft updates are enabled. As a result, it is usually not necessary to wait for fsck to finish before accessing the disk. This design is reflected by the flag used at boot.
* ZFS and Btrfs, two full copy-on-write file systems. They avoid in-place changes to assure levels of consistency similar to a journal. They also provide a dummy fsck. codice_3 is still available to check for suspected problems in filesystem structure (e.g. when a software bug or hardware issue is suspected).

Independent of checking the file system structure, modern file systems may offer a data scrubbing tool to check for silent corruption in stored data against a mirror or a checksum. Scrubs tend to be slow as they cover all data on a disk, but periodic runs can defend against data rot and help identify failing drives.

== History ==
fsck first appeared in the Bell Labs &quot;V7 addendum tape&quot; of 1980. It turned into its modern wrapper form in NetBSD 1.3 (1998). fsck is not defined by any extant standard, but the primitive non-wrapper form is present in the 1995 draft &quot;Systems Management: File System and Scheduling Utilities (FSSU)&quot; from X/Open.

==As an expletive==
The severity of file system corruption led to the terms &quot;fsck&quot; and &quot;fscked&quot; becoming used among Unix system administrators as a minced oath for &quot;fuck&quot; and &quot;fucked&quot;. It is unclear whether this usage was cause or effect, as a report from a question and answer session at USENIX 1998 claims that &quot;fsck&quot; originally had a different name:

:Dennis Ritchie: &quot;So fsck was originally called something else&quot;
:Question: &quot;What was it called?&quot;
:Dennis Ritchie: &quot;Well, the second letter was different&quot;

That story has been confirmed by Rob Pike on the Mastodon social network on December 17, 2023:
&quot;Go fsck yourself&quot;, is occasionally used online as an injunction to a person to go and correct their issue (attitude, ignorance of the subject matter, etc.) - in the same way that running fsck involves fixing fundamental errors.

==Examples==
The following example checks the file system configured to be mounted on /usr partition; the file system needs to be unmounted first:

fsck /usr

The following example checks the Linux JFS file system on a mdadm software RAID device:

fsck -t jfs /dev/md0

<text>Lucas Cranach the Younger ( ; October 4, 1515 – January 25, 1586) was a German Renaissance painter and portraitist, the son of Lucas Cranach the Elder and brother of Hans Cranach.

==Life and career==
Lucas Cranach the Younger was born in Wittenberg, Germany on October 4, 1515, the second son of Lucas Cranach the Elder and Barbara Brengebier. He began his career as a painter as an apprentice in his father&#x27;s workshop, training alongside his older brother, Hans. Following the sudden death of Hans in 1537, Cranach the Younger would assume greater responsibilities in his father&#x27;s workshop. 
The Protestant Reformation began in Wittenberg in 1517. Cranach the Elder was friends with Martin Luther and became known as a leading producer of Protestant artistic propaganda. In 1550, Cranach the Elder left Wittenberg to join his patron, John Frederick I, Elector of Saxony, in exile. Following his father&#x27;s departure, Cranach the Younger assumed full responsibility over the flourishing family workshop. In this position, he successfully maintained the workshop&#x27;s high output of quality work, including images of Reformers such as Luther himself. Although Cranach the Younger was never a court painter, he worked for members of the social elite, including princes and nobles. Upon his death in 1586, theologian Georg Mylius (1613–1640) stated that Cranach the Younger&#x27;s work could be seen in &quot;churches and schools, in castles and houses.&quot;

The Cranach family enjoyed a high status in Wittenberg. In addition to the painting workshop, Cranach the Younger was a successful businessman and politician. He occupied several political offices in Nuremberg commencing in 1549, when he served on the city council. He also served as Chamberlain, beginning in 1555 and Burgomaster from 1565.

On February 20, 1541, he married Barbara Brück (daughter of Gregor Brück, who was Luther&#x27;s legal advisor and Cranach&#x27;s neighbour in Wittenberg), with whom he had three sons and a daughter. He was also connected to the Brück family by his sister, Barbara Cranach, who married Christian Brück (brother of his wife). Barbara Cranach died of plague on February 10, 1550. Soon after, Cranach married Magdalena Schurff on May 24, 1551. This union produced five children, including painter Augustin Cranach. His daughter Elisabeth married Polykarp Leyser the Elder.

Cranach the Younger died in Wittenberg on January 25, 1586, at the age of 70. He is buried adjacent to one of his finest altarpieces in the church of St Mary, also known as Stadtkirche Wittenberg.

<text>Lucas Cranach the Elder ( ;  – 16 October 1553) was a German Renaissance painter and printmaker in woodcut and engraving. He was court painter to the Electors of Saxony for most of his career, and is known for his portraits, both of German princes and those of the leaders of the Protestant Reformation, whose cause he embraced with enthusiasm. He was a close friend of Martin Luther, and eleven portraits of that reformer by him survive. Cranach also painted religious subjects, first in the Catholic tradition, and later trying to find new ways of conveying Lutheran religious concerns in art. He continued throughout his career to paint nude subjects drawn from mythology and religion.

Cranach had a large workshop and many of his works exist in different versions; his son Lucas Cranach the Younger and others continued to create versions of his father&#x27;s works for decades after his death. He has been considered the most successful German artist of his time.

==Early and personal life==

He was born at Kronach in upper Franconia (now central Germany), probably in 1472. His exact date of birth is unknown. He learned the art of drawing from his father Hans Maler (his surname meaning &quot;painter&quot; and denoting his profession, not his ancestry, after the manner of the time and class). His mother, with surname Hübner, died in 1491. Later, the name of his birthplace was used for his surname, another custom of the times. How Cranach was trained is not known, but it was probably with local south German masters, as with his contemporary Matthias Grünewald, who worked at Bamberg and Aschaffenburg (Bamberg is the capital of the diocese in which Kronach lies). There are also suggestions that Cranach spent some time in Vienna around 1500.

From 1504 to 1520 he lived in a house on the south west corner of the marketplace in Wittenberg.

According to Gunderam (the tutor of Cranach&#x27;s children), Cranach demonstrated his talents as a painter before the close of the 15th century. His work then drew the attention of Duke Frederick III, Elector of Saxony, known as Frederick the Wise, who attached Cranach to his court in 1504. The records of Wittenberg confirm Gunderam&#x27;s statement to this extent: that Cranach&#x27;s name appears for the first time in the public accounts on the 24 June 1504, when he drew 50 gulden for the salary of half a year, as (&quot;the duke&#x27;s painter&quot;). Cranach was to remain in the service of the Elector and his successors for the rest of his life, although he was able to undertake other work.

Cranach married Barbara Brengbier, the daughter of a burgher of Gotha and also born there; she died at Wittenberg on 26 December 1540. Cranach later owned a house at Gotha, but most likely he got to know Barbara near Wittenberg, where her family also owned a house, which later also belonged to Cranach. Cranach had two sons, both artists: Hans Cranach, whose life is obscure and who died in Bologna in 1537; and Lucas Cranach the Younger, born in 1515, who died in 1586. He also had three daughters. One of them was Barbara Cranach, who died in 1569, married Christian Brück (Pontanus), and was an ancestor of Johann Wolfgang von Goethe. His granddaughter married Polykarp Leyser the Elder, thus making him an ancestor of the Polykarp Leyser family of theologians.

==Career==

The first evidence of Cranach&#x27;s skill as an artist comes in a picture dated 1504. Early in his career he was active in several branches of his profession: sometimes a decorative painter, more frequently producing portraits and altarpieces, woodcuts, engravings, and designing the coins for the electorate.

Early in the days of his official employment he startled his master&#x27;s courtiers by the realism with which he painted still life, game and antlers on the walls of the country palaces at Coburg and Locha; his pictures of deer and wild boar were considered striking, and the duke fostered his passion for this form of art by taking him out to the hunting field, where he sketched &quot;his grace&quot; running the stag, or Duke John sticking a boar.

Before 1508 he had painted several altar-pieces for the Castle Church at Wittenberg in competition with Albrecht Dürer, Hans Burgkmair and others; the duke and his brother John were portrayed in various attitudes and a number of his best woodcuts and copper-plates were published.

In 1509 Cranach went to the Netherlands, and painted the Emperor Maximilian and the boy who afterwards became Emperor Charles V. Until 1508 Cranach signed his works with his initials. In that year the elector gave him the winged snake as an emblem, or Kleinod, which superseded the initials on his pictures after that date.

Cranach was the court painter from 1505 to 1550 to the electors of Saxony in Wittenberg, an area in the heart of the emerging Protestant faith. His patrons were powerful supporters of Martin Luther, and Cranach used his art as a symbol of the new faith. Cranach made numerous portraits of Luther, and provided woodcut illustrations for Luther&#x27;s German translation of the Bible. 
Somewhat later the duke conferred on him the monopoly of the sale of medicines at Wittenberg, and a printer&#x27;s patent with exclusive privileges as to copyright in Bibles. Cranach&#x27;s presses were used by Martin Luther. His apothecary shop was open for centuries, and was only lost by fire in 1871.

Cranach, like his patron, was friendly with the Protestant Reformers at a very early stage; yet it is difficult to fix the time of his first meeting with Martin Luther. The oldest reference to Cranach in Luther&#x27;s correspondence dates from 1520. In a letter written from Worms in 1521, Luther calls him his &quot;gossip&quot;, warmly alluding to his &quot;Gevatterin&quot;, the artist&#x27;s wife. Cranach first made an engraving of Luther in 1520, when Luther was an Augustinian friar; five years later, Luther renounced his religious vows, and Cranach was present as a witness at the betrothal festival of Luther and Katharina von Bora. He was also godfather to their first child, Johannes &quot;Hans&quot; Luther, born 1526. In 1530 Luther lived at the citadel of Veste Coburg under the protection of the Duke of Saxe-Coburg and his room is preserved there along with a painting of him. The Dukes became noted collectors of Cranach&#x27;s work, some of which remains in the family collection at Callenberg Castle.The death in 1525 of the Elector Frederick the Wise and Elector John&#x27;s in 1532 brought no change in Cranach&#x27;s position; he remained a favourite with John Frederick I, under whom he twice (1531 and 1540) filled the office of burgomaster of Wittenberg.
In 1547, John Frederick was taken prisoner at the Battle of Mühlberg, and Wittenberg was besieged. As Cranach wrote from his house to the grand-master Albert, Duke of Prussia at Königsberg to tell him of John Frederick&#x27;s capture, he showed his attachment by saying, I cannot conceal from your Grace that we have been robbed of our dear prince, who from his youth upwards has been a true prince to us, but God will help him out of prison, for the Kaiser is bold enough to revive the Papacy, which God will certainly not allow.
During the siege Charles V, the Holy Roman Emperor, remembered Cranach from his childhood and summoned him to his camp at Pistritz. Cranach came, and begged on his knees for kind treatment for Elector John Frederick.

Three years afterward, when all the dignitaries of the Empire met at Augsburg to receive commands from the emperor, and Titian came at Charles&#x27;s bidding to paint King Philip II of Spain, John Frederick asked Cranach to visit the city; and here for a few months he stayed in the household of the captive elector, whom he afterward accompanied home in 1552.

==Death and veneration==
He died at age 81 on October 16, 1553, at Weimar, where the house in which he lived still stands in the marketplace. He was buried in the Jacobsfriedhof in Weimar.

The Lutheran Church remembers Cranach as a great Christian on April 6 along with Dürer, and possibly Grünewald or Burgkmair.

==Works and art==
The oldest extant picture by Cranach is the &quot;Rest of the Virgin during the Flight into Egypt&quot;, of 1504. The painting already shows remarkable skill and grace, and the pine forest in the background shows a painter familiar with the mountain scenery of Thuringia. There is more forest gloom in landscapes of a later time.

Following the huge international success of Dürer&#x27;s prints, other German artists, much more than Italian ones, devoted their talents to woodcuts and engravings. This accounts for the comparative unproductiveness as painters of Albrecht Dürer and Hans Holbein the Younger, and also may explain why Cranach was not especially skilled at handling colour, light, and shade. Constant attention to contour and to black and white, as an engraver, seems to have affected his sight; and he often outlined shapes in black rather than employing modelling and chiaroscuro.

The largest proportion of Cranach&#x27;s output is of portraits, and it is chiefly thanks to him that we know what the German Reformers and their princely adherents looked like. He painted not only Martin Luther himself but also Luther&#x27;s wife, mother and father. He also depicted leading Catholics like Albert of Brandenburg, archbishop elector of Mainz, Anthony Granvelle and the Duke of Alva.

A dozen likenesses of Frederick III and his brother John are dated 1532. It is characteristic of Cranach&#x27;s prolific output, and a proof that he used a large workshop, that he received payment at Wittenberg in 1533 for &quot;sixty pairs of portraits of the elector and his brother&quot; on one day. Inevitably the quality of such works is variable.

===Religious subjects===

Cranach&#x27;s religious subjects reflect the development of the Protestant Reformation, and its attitudes to religious images. In his early career, he painted several Madonnas; his first woodcut (1505) represents the Virgin and three saints in prayer before a crucifix. Later on he painted the marriage of St. Catherine, a series of martyrdoms, and scenes from the Passion.

After 1517 he occasionally illustrated the old subjects, but he also gave expression to some of the thoughts of the Reformers, although his portraits of reformers were more common than paintings of religious scenes. In a picture of 1518, where a dying man offers &quot;his soul to God, his body to earth, and his worldly goods to his relations&quot;, the soul rises to meet the Trinity in heaven, and salvation is clearly shown to depend on faith and not on good works.

Other works of this period deal with sin and divine grace. One shows Adam sitting between John the Baptist and a prophet at the foot of a tree. To the left God produces the tables of the law, Adam and Eve taste the forbidden fruit, the serpent raises its head, and punishment manifests in the shape of death and the realm of Satan. To the right, the Conception, Crucifixion and Resurrection symbolize redemption, and this is duly impressed on Adam by John the Baptist. There are two examples of this composition in the galleries of Gotha and Prague, both of them dated 1529. His workshop made an altarpiece with a Crucifixion scene in the centre which is now in the Kreuzkirche, Hanover.

Towards the end of his life, after Luther&#x27;s initial hostility to large public religious images had softened, Cranach painted a number of &quot;Lutheran altarpieces&quot; of the Last Supper and other subjects, in which Christ was shown in a traditional manner, including a halo, but the apostles, without halos, were portraits of leading reformers. He also produced a number of violent anti-Catholic and anti-Papacy propaganda prints in a cruder style. His best known work in this vein was a series of prints for the pamphlet &quot;Passional Christi und Antichristi&quot;, where scenes from the &quot;Passion of Christ&quot; were matched by a print mocking practices of the Catholic clergy, so that Christ driving the money-changers from the Temple was matched by the Pope, or Antichrist, signing indulgences over a table spread with cash (see gallery below). Some of the prints were echoed by paintings, such as his &quot;Adoration of the Shepherds&quot; (c. 1517).

One of his last works is the altarpiece, completed after his death by Lucas Cranach the Younger in 1555, for the Stadtkirche (city church) at Weimar. The iconography is original and unusual: Christ is shown twice, to the left trampling on Death and Satan, to the right crucified, with blood flowing from the lance wound. John the Baptist points to the suffering Christ, whilst the blood-stream falls on the head of a portrait of Cranach, and Luther reads from his book the words, &quot;The blood of Christ cleanseth from all sin.&quot;


===Mythological scenes===

Cranach was equally successful in a series of paintings of mythological scenes which nearly always feature at least one slim female figure, naked but for a transparent drape or a large hat.

These are mostly in narrow upright formats; examples are several of Venus, alone or with Cupid, who has sometimes stolen a honeycomb, and complains to Venus that he has been stung by a bee (Weimar, 1530; Berlin, 1534). Other such subjects are the Three Graces, Diana with Apollo, shooting a bow, and Hercules sitting at the spinning-wheel mocked by Omphale and her maids. A similar approach was taken with the biblical subjects of Salome and Adam and Eve. He and his workshop also painted more than sixty versions of Lucretia, the self-stabbing pagan heroine whose death sparked the Roman Republic.

These subjects were produced early in his career, when they show Italian influences including that of Jacopo de&#x27; Barberi, who was at the court of Saxony for a period up to 1505. They then become rare until after the death of Frederick the Wise. The later nudes are in a distinctive style which abandons Italian influence for a revival of Late Gothic style, with small heads, narrow shoulders, high breasts and waists. The poses become more frankly seductive and even exhibitionist.

Humour and pathos are combined at times in pictures such as &quot;Jealousy&quot; (Augsburg, 1527; Vienna, 1530), where women and children are huddled into groups as they watch the strife of men wildly fighting around them. A lost canvas of 1545 is said to show hares catching and roasting hunters. In 1546, possibly under Italian influence, Cranach composed the &quot;Fons Juventutis&quot; (&quot;The Fountain of Youth&quot;), executed by his son, a picture in which older women are seen entering a Renaissance fountain, and exiting it transformed into youthful beauties.

==Looted Cranachs==
The Nazis had a particular affection for Cranach&#x27;s work and looted many paintings during the Third Reich. This has led to claims for restitution, notably from Jewish collectors who were persecuted or looted by the Nazis. The Nazis looted Cranach&#x27;s Portrait of John Frederick I, Elector of Saxony (around 1530s) from Jewish art collector Fritz Gutmann before murdering him but the painting was recovered by Gutmann&#x27;s grandson Simon Goodman eighty years later after decades of searching.

Cranach&#x27;s &quot;Cupid Complaining to Venus&quot; passed through in Hitler&#x27;s personal collection, causing the National Gallery to research its history, suspecting that it may have been looted. The diptych &quot;Adam and Eve&quot; by Lucas Cranach the Elder has been the focus of a legal dispute between the heirs of the former owner, Dutch art collector Jacques Goudstikker, and the Norton Simon museum in California. In 1999, the Commission for Art Recovery of the World Jewish Congress notified the North Carolina Museum of Art that its prized Cranach Madonna and Child had been looted by Nazis from the Jewish Viennese art collector Philipp von Gomperz.

On 20 October 2000 a Budapest court ruled that a Cranach and other paintings claimed by the granddaughter of famous Hungarian Jewish art collector Baron Herzog that were looted by Nazis with the Hungarian financial police should be returned to her. In 2012 the heirs of Rosa and Jakob Oppenheimer submitted a claim to the National Gallery of Ireland for a Cranach painting of Saint Christopher. The museum hired a private provenance researcher, Laurie Stein, to investigate the circumstance of the sale in 1934, and she concluded that the Cranach had not been sold under duress by the Jewish owners.

In April 2021 Cranach&#x27;s &quot;The Resurrection&quot; was sold at auction following a settlement between the heirs of Holocaust victim Margarete Eisenmann and the art dealer Eugene Thaw. After being looted, the Cranach had been consigned to Sothebys by Hans Lange and passed through Hugo Perls and Knoedler Galleries before being acquired by Eugene Thaw. Most of the lawsuits last many years and go through several appeals in different courts. A painting by a follower of Lucas Cranach the Elder titled &quot;Lamentation&quot; and completed in the 1530s, which had been looted from Poland in 1946, was returned to the National Museum, Wrocław in 2022.

<doc id="79887" wikidata="Q780746" url="?curid=79887" title="Rodan">
<text>is a fictional monster, or &quot;kaiju&quot;, which first appeared as the title character in Ishirō Honda&#x27;s 1956 film &quot;Rodan&quot;, produced and distributed by Toho. Following its debut standalone appearance, Rodan went on to be featured in numerous entries in the &quot;Godzilla&quot; franchise, including &quot;Ghidorah, the Three-Headed Monster&quot; (1964), &quot;Invasion of Astro-Monster&quot; (1965), &quot;Destroy All Monsters&quot; (1968), &quot;Godzilla vs. Mechagodzilla II&quot; (1993), and &quot;&quot; (2004), as well as in the Legendary Pictures-produced film &quot;&quot; (2019).

Rodan is depicted as a colossal, prehistoric, irradiated species of &quot;Pteranodon&quot;. In 2014, &quot;IGN&quot; ranked Rodan as #6 on its &quot;Top 10 Japanese Movie Monsters&quot; list, while &quot;Complex&quot; listed the character as #15 on its &quot;The 15 Most Badass Kaiju Monsters of All Time&quot; list.

==Overview==

===Name===
The Japanese name &quot;Radon&quot; is a contraction of &quot;Pteranodon&quot;. The spelling of Radon in Japanese also corresponds to the name of Ladon, the dragon guarding the Hesperides in Greek mythology - since there is no distinction between &quot;l&quot; and &quot;r&quot; in Japanese.

It was changed to &quot;Rodan&quot; for English-speaking markets in order to avoid confusion with the element radon. However, in &quot;Godzilla vs. Mechagodzilla II&quot;, the English version of the film used the original name &quot;Radon&quot;.

===Development===
As with Godzilla, writer Ken Kuronuma turned to prehistoric animals for inspiration in developing the character, though unlike the former, whose species is largely left ambiguous, Rodan is explicitly stated to be a kind of &quot;Pteranodon&quot;. Just as Godzilla was conceived as a symbol of an American nuclear threat, Rodan was seen as an embodiment of the same danger originating from the Soviet Union.

Rodan&#x27;s debut appearance was the first and only time the character was given a chestnut color. It originally had a menacing face with a jagged, toothed beak, which would disappear in later incarnations as the character became more heroic. Rodan was portrayed via a combination of suitmation and wire-operated puppets for flight sequences. During suitmation sequences, Rodan was portrayed by Haruo Nakajima, who almost drowned when the wires holding the 150 lb. suits above a water tank snapped. In &quot;Ghidorah, the Three-Headed Monster&quot;, the Rodan suit was of visibly lesser quality than the previous one, having a more comical face, a thick neck which barely concealed the shape of the performer&#x27;s head within, and triangular wings. The modification of the character&#x27;s face was deliberate, as Rodan was meant to be a slapstick character rather than the tragic villain seen in its film debut. A new suit was constructed for &quot;Invasion of Astro-Monster&quot; which more closely resembled the first, having more rounded wings and a sleeker face. The sleek face was retained in &quot;Destroy All Monsters&quot;, though the wings and chest area were crudely designed.

Rodan was revived in 1993&#x27;s &quot;Godzilla vs. Mechagodzilla II&quot;, this time portrayed entirely via a wire-manipulated marionette and hand puppets. Having received criticism for his emphasis on battle sequences relying heavily on beam weapons, special effects artist Koichi Kawakita sought to make the confrontation between Godzilla and Rodan as physical as possible.

===MonsterVerse (2019)===
In 2014, Legendary Pictures announced that they had acquired the rights to Rodan, Mothra and King Ghidorah from Toho to use in their MonsterVerse.

Rodan appears in a post-credits scene of &quot;&quot;. It is in the depicting cave paintings showing him, Mothra, King Ghidorah, and Godzilla in the footage that is shown to James Conrad and Mason Weaver.

A casting call confirmed that Rodan, Mothra, and King Ghidorah would be featured in &quot;&quot;. Viral marketing describes him as a titanic kaiju with the skeletal structure of a &quot;Pteranodon&quot; and magma-like skin serving as plate armor. The film&#x27;s promotional website, Monarch Sciences, identifies the fictional island of Isla de Mara off the eastern coast of Mexico as Rodan&#x27;s location and describes him as being tall with a weight of 39,043 tons and a wingspan of , making it the shortest version of the character, yet also the heaviest and the one with the greatest wingspan, though part of the short height is this version of Rodan being a quadruped like a real pterosaur as opposed to an upright biped like the Toho versions. He is also stated to be powerful enough to level cities with thunderclaps generated by his wings.

In &quot;&quot;, Colonel Alan Jonah uses Dr. Emma Russell to have the ORCA device awaken Rodan from Monarch&#x27;s Mexican outpost 56. With Rodan awoken, Monarch&#x27;s jets lead him into fighting King Ghidorah where he is defeated. After Godzilla is (seemingly) killed by the Oxygen Destroyer, Rodan sides with Ghidorah before being defeated by Mothra in Boston and then switching loyalties to Godzilla after Ghidorah is destroyed, leading the other Titans into bowing to him. According to a news clipping shown in the end credits, Rodan returned to hibernation in a mountain north of Fiji.

===Reiwa (2017–2021)===
The skeletal remains of an individual Rodan appears in the prologue of &quot;&quot;, having been killed in China. This is expanded upon in the prequel novel &quot;Godzilla: Monster Apocalypse&quot;, in which it is revealed the Rodan emerged from Paektu Mountain in November 2005, attacked China, and battled Anguirus before they were both killed by a bio-weapon created by the Chinese military called Hedorah. In 2036, a flock of Rodans took over Siberia, competing against a swarm of Megaguiruses to prey on European refugees on the Trans-Siberian Railway. In &quot;&quot;″s prequel novel &quot;Godzilla: Project Mechagodzilla&quot;, a second Rodan was said to have attacked Kyushu in 2029 while another flock of Rodans attacked Rome to prey on humans and eventually took over the Italian Peninsula in the mid-2030s. While enacting &quot;Operation: Long March&quot; and &quot;Operation: Great Wall&quot; in 2044 and 2045 respectively, United Earth forces faced attacks from an individual Rodan, among other monsters, in North Africa as well as a third flock of Rodans feeding on Meganulon in China.

In Godzilla Singular Point, the show features various Rodans which are based on the Quetzalcoatlus. Most times, Rodan is smaller than its older counterparts, however, a larger, dark Rodan appears in the show, which is shortly killed by Godzilla.

===Roar===
The character&#x27;s shriek was created by sound technician Ichiro Minawa, who sought to replicate the &quot;contrabass technique&quot; composer Akira Ifukube used for Godzilla. He layered it with a sped up human voice. The sound would be remixed and reused for several other Toho monsters, including the Heisei incarnation of King Ghidorah and Battra.

<doc id="79888" wikidata="Q14705766" url="?curid=79888" title="Fruit tree pruning">
<text>Fruit tree pruning is the cutting and removing of selected parts of a fruit tree. It spans a number of horticultural techniques. Pruning often means cutting branches back, sometimes removing smaller limbs entirely. It may also mean removal of young shoots, buds, and leaves.

Established orchard practice of both organic and nonorganic types typically includes pruning. Pruning can control growth, remove dead or diseased wood, and stimulate the formation of flowers and fruit buds. It is widely stated that careful attention to pruning and training young trees improves their later productivity and longevity, and that good pruning and training can also prevent later injury from weak crotches or forks (where a tree trunk splits into two or more branches) that break from the weight of fruit, snow, or ice on the branches.

Some sustainable agriculture or permaculture personalities, such as Sepp Holzer and Masanobu Fukuoka, advocate and practice no-pruning methods, which runs counter to the widespread confidence in the idea that pruning produces superior results compared with not pruning. Many books about fruit-growing assert advantages and disadvantages of pruning or not pruning, although without randomized controlled trials, it is hard to separate theorizing and traditional knowledge from evidence-based recommendations.

==Overview==
Plants form new tissue in an area called the meristem, located near the tips of roots and shoots, where active cell division takes place. Meristem growth is aimed at ensuring that leaves are quickly elevated into sunlight, and that roots are able to penetrate deeply into the soil. Once adequate height and length is achieved by the stems and roots, they begin to thicken to support the plant. On the shoots, these growing tips of the plant are called &quot;apical&quot; buds. The &quot;apical meristem&quot; (or tip) produces the growth hormone auxin, which not only promotes cell division, but also diffuses downwards and inhibits the development of lateral bud growth that otherwise competes with the apical tip for light and nutrients. Removing the apical tip and its suppressive hormone lets lower, dormant lateral buds develop, and the buds between the leaf stalk and stem produce new shoots that compete to become lead growth.

Manipulating this natural response to damage (known as the principle of apical dominance) by processes such as pruning (as well as coppicing and pollarding) allows the arborist to determine the shape, size, and productivity of many fruiting trees and bushes. The main aim when pruning fruit trees is usually to maximize fruit yield. Unpruned trees tend to produce large numbers of small fruits that may be difficult to reach when harvesting by hand. Branches can become broken by the weight of the crop, and the cropping may become biennial (that is, bearing fruit only every other year). Overpruned trees on the other hand tend to produce light crops of large, flavourless fruit that does not store well. Careful pruning balances shoot growth and fruit production.

One of the simplest instructions given in nearly every article or book chapter on the subject is that no branches should cross each other, that is, rub against each other, and that one of them should be selected and removed.

==Formative pruning of bush trees==
In the early years of the tree&#x27;s life, it is important to develop a framework sufficiently strong to bear the weight of crops. This requires formative pruning to reinforce the tree. Formative pruning of apple (&quot;Malus pumila&quot;) and pear (&quot;Pyrus communis&quot;) trees should be carried out in the dormant winter months. For the Northern hemisphere, this should occur between November and March; For the Southern hemisphere, June and September. Stone fruits—such as cherries, plums, and gages—have different requirements, and should not be pruned in dormant months.

===Maiden tree===
A maiden whip (a one-year-old tree with no side shoots) should be pruned to a bud with two buds below it at about from the ground immediately after planting to produce primary branches during the first growing season. A feathered maiden (that is, a one-year-old tree with several side branches) should have its main stem pruned back to three or four strong shoots at from the ground. Side shoots should be shortened by two thirds of their length to an upward or outward facing bud. Lower shoots should be removed flush with the stem.

===Two year===
Remove lower shoots and prune between three and five of the best-placed shoots by half to an upwards or outwards facing bud to form what becomes the tree&#x27;s main structural branches. Remove any inward-facing shoots.

===Three year===
Prune leading shoots of branches selected to extend the framework by half, to a bud facing in the desired direction. Select four good laterals to fill the framework and shorten these by a half. Prune any remaining laterals to four buds to form fruiting spurs.

===Four year===
The tree has begun to fruit and requires only limited formative pruning. Shorten leaders by one third and prune laterals not required to extend the framework to four buds.

===Five year and onwards===
The tree is established, and should be pruned annually as described in the following section.

==Pruning the cropping tree==

Before pruning, distinguish between spur-bearing varieties, tip-bearing varieties, and an intermediate between the two that bears both on spurs and at the tips. Spur-bearing trees occur more frequently than tip-bearing trees, and they bear most of their fruit yearly at the end of short lateral pieces of wood (spurs) up to about long.

Spur-bearing types include apples of the varieties &#x27;Cox&#x27;s Orange Pippin&#x27;, &#x27;James Grieve&#x27; and &#x27;Sunset&#x27;, and pears such as &#x27;Conference&#x27;, &#x27;Doyenne du Commice&#x27;, and &#x27;Williams Bon Chretien&#x27;. Tip-bearers on the other hand produce most of their fruit buds at the tips of slender shoots grown the previous summer, and include the apples &#x27;Worcester Pearmain&#x27; and &#x27;Irish Peach&#x27;, and the pears such as &#x27;Jargonelle&#x27; and &#x27;Josephine de Malines&#x27;. There are basically three types of pruning that are applied once the main shape of the tree has been established. These are:
*Spur pruning: Spur bearing varieties form spurs naturally, but spur growth can also be induced.
*Renewal pruning: This also depends on the tendency of many apple and pear trees to form flower buds on unpruned two-year-old laterals. It is a technique best used for the strong laterals on the outer part of the tree where there is room for such growth. Pruning long-neglected fruit trees is a task that should be undertaken over a lengthy period, with not more than one third of the branches that require removal being taken each year.
*Regulatory pruning: This is carried out on the tree as a whole, and is aimed at keeping the tree and its environment healthy, e.g., by keeping the centre open so that air can circulate; removing dead or diseased wood; preventing branches from becoming overcrowded (branches should be roughly apart and spurs not less than apart along the branch framework); and preventing any branches from crossing.

==Pruning of tip bearers==
Tip-bearers should be pruned lightly in winter using the regulatory system (see above). Any maiden shoots less than in length should be left untouched as they have fruit buds at their tips. Longer shoots are spur pruned to prevent overcrowding and to stimulate the production of more short-tip-bearing shoots the following year. Branch leaders are &#x27;tipped&#x27;, removing the top three or four buds to a bud facing in the desired direction to make them branch out and so produce more tip-bearing shoots.

<text>In Spanish football, the Pichichi Trophy () is awarded by the sports newspaper &quot;Marca&quot; to the top goalscorer of each La Liga season. Named after the Athletic Bilbao striker Rafael &quot;Pichichi&quot; Moreno, the trophy has been awarded annually since the 1952–53 season. All top scorers who preceded the award&#x27;s creation were retroactively named Pichichi winners by &quot;Marca&quot;. Since the 2014–15 season, the top scorer of the women&#x27;s Liga F is also awarded the Pichichi Trophy.

The Pichichi is not officially recognised by the league&#x27;s governing body, the Liga Nacional de Fútbol Profesional. As the award is based on &quot;Marca&quot;″s subjective criteria, its data may differ from the official match delegate reports. For the top scorers in the Spanish football league according to La Liga data, see &quot;List of La Liga top scorers&quot;. The player with the record number of wins is Lionel Messi with eight, all with Barcelona.

<doc id="79898" wikidata="Q336496" url="?curid=79898" title="Mímir">
<text>Mímir or Mim is a figure in Norse mythology, renowned for his knowledge and wisdom, who is beheaded during the Æsir–Vanir War. Afterward, the god Odin carries around Mímir&#x27;s head and it recites secret knowledge and counsel to him.

Mímir is attested in the &quot;Poetic Edda&quot;, compiled in the 13th century from earlier traditional sources, the &quot;Prose Edda&quot;, written in the 13th century by Snorri Sturluson of Iceland, and in euhemerized form as one of the Æsir in &quot;Heimskringla&quot;, also written by Snorri Sturluson in the 13th century. Mímir&#x27;s name appears in the names of the well Mímisbrunnr, and the names Mímameiðr and Hoddmímis holt, which scholars generally consider to be names for Yggdrasil. Scholars have proposed that Bestla may be Mímir&#x27;s sister, and therefore Mímir would be Odin&#x27;s maternal uncle.

==Etymology==
The proper names &quot;Mímir&quot; and &quot;Mim&quot; present difficulties for historical linguists. However, the most generally accepted etymology among philologists is that &quot;Mímir&quot; stems from a reduplication of the Proto-Indo-European verb *&quot;(s)mer-&quot;, meaning &#x27;to think, recall, reflect, worry over&#x27; (compare Sanskrit &quot;smárati&quot;, Avestan &quot;hi-šmaraiti&quot;, Ancient Greek &quot;mermaírō&quot;, Gothic &quot;maúrnan&quot;).

In turn, scholars note that the names &quot;Mímir&quot; and &quot;Mim&quot; are therefore likely ultimately to be related to the modern English word &#x27;memory&#x27; and its associated concepts. For example, scholar Rudolf Simek renders the name as meaning &#x27;the rememberer, the wise one&#x27;.

==Attestations==
===&quot;Poetic Edda&quot;===
Mímir is mentioned in the &quot;Poetic Edda&quot; poems &quot;Völuspá&quot; and &quot;Sigrdrífumál&quot;. In &quot;Völuspá&quot;, Mímir is mentioned in two stanzas. Stanza 28 references Odin&#x27;s sacrifice of his eye to Mímir&#x27;s Well, and states that Mímir drinks mead every morning &quot;from the Father of the Slain&#x27;s [Odin] wager.&quot; Stanza 46 describes that, in reference to Ragnarök, the &quot;sons&quot; of Mím are at play while &quot;fate burns&quot; (though no further information about these &quot;sons&quot; has survived), that the god Heimdallr blows the Gjallarhorn, and that Mímir&#x27;s severed head gives counsel to Odin. The single mention in stanza 14 of &quot;Sigrdrífumál&quot; is also a reference to Mímir&#x27;s speaking, decollated head. Stanzas 20 and 24 of the poem &quot;Fjölsvinnsmál&quot; refer to Yggdrasil as &quot;Mímameiðr&quot;.

===&quot;Prose Edda&quot;===
In chapter 15 of the &quot;Prose Edda&quot; book &quot;Gylfaginning&quot;, as owner of his namesake well, Mímir himself drinks from it and gains great knowledge. To drink from the well, he uses the Gjallarhorn, a drinking horn which shares its name with the sounding horn used by Heimdallr intended to announce the onset of Ragnarök. The section further relates that the well is located beneath one of the three roots of Yggdrasil, in the realm of the frost jötnar.

Chapter 51 relates that, with the onset of Ragnarök, &quot;Heimdall stands up and blows the Gjallarhorn with all his strength. He wakens all the gods who then hold an assembly. Odin now rides to Mimir&#x27;s Well, seeking council for both himself and his followers. The ash Yggdrasil shakes, and nothing, whether in heaven or on earth, is without fear.&quot;

In the &quot;Prose Edda&quot; book &quot;Skáldskaparmál&quot;, Mímir&#x27;s name appears in various kennings. These kennings include &quot;Mím&#x27;s friend&quot; (for &quot;Odin&quot;) in three places, &quot;mischief-Mímir&quot; (a kenning for &quot;jötunn&quot;), and among a list of names for jötunn.

===&quot;Heimskringla&quot;===
Mímir is mentioned in chapters 4 and 7 of the saga &quot;Ynglinga Saga&quot;, as collected in &quot;Heimskringla&quot;. In chapter 4, Snorri presents a euhemerized account of the Æsir-Vanir War. Snorri states that the two sides eventually tired of the war and both agree to meet to establish a truce. The two sides meet and exchanged hostages. Vanaheimr are described as having sent to Asgard their best men: Njörðr—described as wealthy—and his son Freyr in exchange for Asaland&#x27;s Hœnir—described here as large, handsome, and thought of by the people of Vanaheimr well suited to be a chieftain. Additionally, the Æsir send Mímir—described as a man of great understanding—in exchange for Kvasir, who Snorri describes as the wisest man of Vanaheimr.

Snorri continues that, upon arrival in Vanaheimr, Hœnir was immediately made chief and Mímir often gave him good counsel. However, when Hœnir was at meetings and at the Thing without Mímir by his side, he would always answer the same way: &quot;Let others decide.&quot; Subsequently, the Vanir suspected they had been cheated in the exchange by the Æsir, so they seized Mimir and beheaded him and sent the head to Asgard. Odin took the head of Mímir, embalmed it with herbs so that it would not rot, and spoke charms over it, which gave it the power to speak to him and reveal to him secrets. The head of Mímir is again mentioned in chapter 7 in connection with Odin, where Odin is described as keeping Mímir&#x27;s head with him and that it divulged information from other worlds.

==Theories==
On the basis of &quot;Hávamál&quot; 140 – where Odin learns nine magic songs from the unnamed brother of his mother Bestla – some scholars have theorized that Bestla&#x27;s brother may in fact be Mímir, who would then be Odin&#x27;s maternal uncle. This also means that Mimir&#x27;s father would be Bölþorn.

In the theories of Viktor Rydberg, Mímir&#x27;s wife is Sinmara, named in the poem &quot;Fjölsvinnsmal&quot;. According to Rydberg, the byname &quot;Sinmara&quot; (&quot;sinew-maimir&quot;) refers to &quot;Mímir-Niðhad&quot;&#x27;s &quot;queen ordering Völund&#x27;s hamstrings to be cut&quot;.

==In popular culture==
Mímir features in Santa Monica Studio&#x27;s 2018 action-adventure video game &quot;God of War&quot; and its 2022 sequel &quot;God of War Ragnarök&quot;. He is voiced by Scottish actor Alastair Duncan in both entries.

<text>The name Cydippe (Ancient Greek: Κυδίππη &quot;Kudíppē&quot;) is attributed to four individuals in Greek mythology.

*Cydippe, one of the 50 Nereids, sea-nymph daughters of the &#x27;Old Man of the Sea&#x27; Nereus and the Oceanid Doris. She was in the train of Cyrene along with her sisters.
*Cydippe, also called Crybia or Lysippe, the daughter of the nymph Hegetoria and Ochimus, king of Rhodes. She married her paternal uncle, Cercaphus, who inherited the island. According to an alternate version, Ochimus engaged Cydippe to Ocridion but Cercaphus loved her and kidnapped her. He did not return until Ochimus was old. Cydippe was by Cercaphus the mother of Cameirus, Ialysus, and Lindes. Each of them founded a town in Rhodes and named it after himself.
*Cydippe, mother of Cleobis and Biton.
*Cydippe, an Athenian girl who was obliged to marry Acontius.

<text>Ford Prefect (also called Ix) is a character in &quot;The Hitchhiker&#x27;s Guide to the Galaxy&quot; by the British author Douglas Adams. His role as Arthur Dent&#x27;s friend – and rescuer, when Earth is unexpectedly demolished to make way for a hyperspace bypass at the start of the story – is often expository, as Ford is an experienced galactic hitchhiker and explains that he is actually a journalist, a field researcher for the titular &quot;Guide&quot; itself, and not an out-of-work actor from Guildford as he had claimed.

==Name==
Although Ford had taken great care to blend into Earth society, he had &quot;skimped a bit on his preparatory research,&quot; and thought that the name &quot;Ford Prefect&quot; would be &quot;nicely inconspicuous.&quot; The Ford Prefect was a popular British car manufactured from 1938 to 1961, and Adams later clarified in an interview that Ford &quot;had simply mistaken the dominant life form&quot; of Earth. This was expanded on somewhat in the film version, where Ford is almost run over while attempting to greet a blue Ford Prefect. He is saved by Arthur and, in the film version of events, this is how the pair meet (this meeting also prompting Ford to rescue Arthur in particular when the Vogons come to destroy Earth). The graphics in the TV series provide a similar explanation by listing a sequence of names including &#x27;Ford&#x27;, beginning with director John Ford, Arthur Ford, news reader Anna Ford, carmaker Henry Ford, the Ford Anglia, the Ford Consul with the final name Ford Prefect being selected.

Adams later observed that this joke was lost on United States audiences who assumed it was a typing error for &quot;perfect.&quot; In some versions, such as the French (&quot;Le Guide Galactique&quot;) and the Greek (&quot;Γυρίστε τον Γαλαξία με Ωτοστόπ&quot;), Ford&#x27;s name was changed to &quot;Ford Escort&quot;. In the Dutch translation, the car reference was dropped entirely instead opting for &quot;Amro Bank&quot;, the name of the biggest commercial bank in the Netherlands at the time. Nowadays, the joke is largely lost on younger audiences in Britain as well, since the Ford Prefect is now a rare sight on British roads. In the film adaptation, his last name was never actually stated on-screen, but it is given in the film&#x27;s credits as &quot;Prefect.&quot;

===First birth name===
A footnote in the novel explains that Ford&#x27;s birth name is &quot;only pronounceable in an obscure Betelgeusian dialect&quot; which was almost wiped out by the &quot;Great Collapsing Hrung Disaster of Gal./Sid./Year 03758,&quot; a mysterious catastrophe which took place on the planet of Betelgeuse Seven and which Ford&#x27;s father was the only man to survive. Ford never learned to pronounce his birth name, which was a matter that caused his father to die of shame (which is still a terminal disease in some parts of the Universe). At school, he was nicknamed &quot;Ix,&quot; which translates as &quot;boy who is not able to satisfactorily explain what a Hrung is, nor why it should choose to collapse on Betelgeuse Seven&quot;.

Despite all this, his cousin (in the film, TV series, and radio show they are said to share three of the same mothers) Zaphod Beeblebrox calls him &quot;Ford&quot; the first time they are reunited in all versions of the story except for the film, where Zaphod addresses him as &quot;Praxibetel Ix,&quot; then introduces him by saying &quot;This is my semi-half brother, Ix... I&#x27;m sorry, sorry, Ford.&quot; While not explained in the book, a footnote of the original radio scripts explains that &quot;just before arriving (on Earth) he registered his new name officially at the Galactic Nomenclaturoid Office, where they had the technology to unpick his old name from the fabric of space/time and thread the new one in its place, so that for all intents and purposes his name had always been and would always be Ford Prefect.&quot;

==Character and role==
Ford takes an existential view on the universe, sometimes bordering on joyful nihilism. He is eccentric and endlessly broad-minded – no doubt due to his vast experience of roughing it around the galaxy – and possesses of an off-key and often very dark sense of humour. He is described as being able to smile in a way that would &quot;send hitherto sane men scampering into the trees&quot;. In his role as guide to the universe for the often bewildered everyman Arthur Dent, he serves to link the disparate elements of the story together. As well as rescuing Arthur, he introduces him to the other major characters – such as Zaphod, Trillian and Marvin the Paranoid Android – and to numerous mind-boggling concepts, from &quot;teasers&quot; (an explanation of UFO sightings on Earth) to the extraordinary usefulness of towels. Ford&#x27;s other chief characteristic is his constant pursuit of an alcohol-fueled good time (in contrast to Arthur&#x27;s quest for a cup of tea). Although his heart is in the right place and he is shown to be highly intelligent, resourceful and even brave, Ford is essentially a dilettante when it comes to causes such as the search for the question to the ultimate answer of &quot;life, the universe and everything&quot;.

Ford carries the essential items of his profession in a leather satchel, hiding them under copies of play scripts in keeping with his public persona as an actor in search of work. Among the contents are his copy of the &quot;Guide&quot;; an Electronic Thumb, which he uses to signal passing spaceships in an attempt to hitch a ride; a Sub-Etha Sens-O-Matic, which monitors interstellar activity and alerts him to ships&#x27; proximity and origin; and a bath towel from Marks and Spencer.

Ford is approximately 200 years old, as supported by the books. When, in the first novel, Zaphod steals the spaceship &quot;Heart of Gold&quot;, it is on Zaphod&#x27;s two-hundredth birthday. It is later mentioned that Ford and Zaphod attended school together, even having some of the same classes, which would indicate that they are roughly the same age. He had originally planned to spend a week on Earth doing research for the &quot;Guide&quot;, but wound up being stranded there for 15 years prior to helping Arthur escape the planet when the Vogons demolish it.

At the end of the final novel in the series, &quot;Mostly Harmless&quot;, Ford is apparently vaporised along with all the other main characters when the Vogons once again destroy the Earth. It is hinted, however, that he and the others may have survived. In the final episodes of the radio series, Ford, along with all the other main characters, is teleported to safety by the Babel Fish in his ear. The episode ends with a selection of possible outcomes for this last-second-teleportation, as the &quot;unstable&quot; nature of the section of galaxy Earth is in means that there are a variety of realities that the characters could find themselves in. The outcomes focus mostly on Arthur, but Ford features in the final possibility, where they all end up at Milliways (The Restaurant at the End of the Universe), drinking and chatting - and in Ford&#x27;s case, flirting.

==Portrayals==
In the original and following radio series and subsequent LP adaptation, Ford was played by Geoffrey McGivern. On television, he was played by David Dixon, and in the film he was played by Mos Def. In &quot;The Illustrated Hitchhiker&#x27;s Guide to the Galaxy&quot; he is portrayed by Tom Finnis. Richard Hope played Ford in the first stage production of &quot;The Hitchhiker&#x27;s Guide to the Galaxy&quot; with Ken Campbell’s The Science Fiction Theatre of Liverpool in May 1979 at the Institute of Contemporary Arts (ICA) in London.

<doc id="79906" wikidata="Q3153130" url="?curid=79906" title="Disfranchisement">
<text>Disfranchisement, also disenfranchisement (which has become more common since 1982) or voter disqualification, is the restriction of suffrage (the right to vote) of a person or group of people, or a practice that has the effect of preventing someone from exercising the right to vote. Disfranchisement can also refer to the revocation of power or control of a particular individual, community, or being to the natural amenity they have; that is to deprive of a franchise, of a legal right, of some privilege or inherent immunity. Disfranchisement may be accomplished explicitly by law or implicitly through requirements applied in a discriminatory fashion, through intimidation, or by placing unreasonable requirements on voters for registration or voting.
High barriers to entry to the political competition can disenfranchise political movements.

== Based on gender ==

Women used to be disfranchised. Feminism has successfully managed to claim voting rights in most countries, though material or social disfranchement continues widely.

== Based on age ==

Most countries or regions set a minimum voting age, and only enfranchise citizens older than this age. The most common voting age is 18, though some countries have minimum voting ages set as young as 16 or as old as 21.

== Based on residence or ethnicity ==

===Australia===
Voting in Australia is compulsory for resident citizens. Australian citizens who have been outside Australia for more than one but fewer than six years may excuse themselves from the requirement to vote in Australian elections while they remain outside Australia.

===Canada===
Residency requirements for Canadian citizens were ruled unconstitutional by the Supreme Court of Canada in 2019. All Canadian citizens can vote in Canadian elections.

===Chile===
Chileans living abroad may vote in presidential elections and presidential primaries, but not in elections to the national legislature or for regional government officials. The right to vote was extended to Chileans abroad in 2014 by Law No. 20.748; the bill was sponsored by Senators Isabel Allende Bussi, Soledad Alvear, Hernán Larraían Fernández and Patricio Walker Prieto. The law also allowed Chileans residing abroad to vote in the 2020 national plebiscite. Of nearly 60,000 registered overseas voters, 30,912 Chileans from 65 countries participated in the referendum.

===Denmark===
Citizens of Denmark are in general not allowed to vote in Danish elections if they reside outside the country for more than two years. Danish citizens that reside permanently outside Denmark lose their right to vote.

===India===
Non-resident Indian citizens may vote from abroad by applying to be registered as non-resident electors as long as they have not obtained citizenship in another country. They must be &quot;absent from the country owing to employment, education etc, [have] not acquired citizenship of any other country and are otherwise eligible to be registered as a voter in the address mentioned in your passport.&quot;

===Norway===
The Norwegian constitution of 1814, paragraph 53, stated that anyone being in service of another power, buying or selling votes, or being convicted to forced labor would be disfranchised. Paragraph 53 was repealed by the parliament (Storting) in June 2022. Citizens residing outside Norway for more than 10 years may not vote unless they make an application.

====Svalbard====
The 2023 election for the Longyearbyen Community Council was held under new rules imposed by the Norwegian government, wherein voters had to have Norwegian citizenship or have lived in mainland Norway for 3 years. These rules disenfranchised an estimated one-third of the voter roll compared to the previous election in 2019, including almost the entire community of non-Norwegians living in the town. The previous rules allowed anyone who had resided on Svalbard itself for 3 years to vote.

===United Kingdom===
British citizens are allowed to vote at home with no time limit. Until 2024, they were not allowed to vote in UK General Elections or referendums if they reside outside the country for more than 15 years.

In February 2018, the Overseas Electors Bill was presented to Parliament, with a view to abolishing the 15-year limit and the requirement to have registered to vote before leaving the UK. The Bill, which ran out of time due to the 2019 general election, would have granted all British expatriates the unlimited right to vote, as long as they have lived in the UK at some point in their lives. The issue became a hotly debated topic among British expatriates who have lived in other EU Member States for more than 15 years and were thus barred from voting in the referendum on European Union membership, despite arguably being more affected by the result than British people living in the UK.

The Conservative Party pledged to abolish what the called the &quot;arbitrary 15-year limit&quot; in their manifesto for the 2019 general election, in which they were subsequently elected. The change was implemented in 2024.

===United States===
Efforts made by Southern United States to prevent black citizens voting began after the end of the Reconstruction Era in 1877. They were enacted by Southern states at the turn of the 20th century. Their actions were designed to thwart the objective of the Fifteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution, enacted in 1870 to protect the suffrage of freedmen.

Democrats were alarmed by a late 19th-century alliance between Republicans and Populists that cost them some elections in North Carolina. Democrats added to previous efforts and achieved widespread disfranchisement by law: from 1890 to 1908, Southern state legislatures passed new constitutions, constitutional amendments, and laws that made voter registration and voting more difficult, especially when administered by white staff in a discriminatory way. They succeeded in disenfranchising most of the black citizens, as well as many poor whites in the South, and voter rolls dropped dramatically in each state. The Republican Party was nearly eliminated in the region for decades, and the Democrats established one-party control throughout the southern states.

In 1912, the Republican Party was split when Theodore Roosevelt ran against the party nominee, Taft. In the South by this time, the Republican Party had been hollowed out by the disfranchisement of African Americans, who were largely excluded from voting. Democrat Woodrow Wilson was elected as the first southern president since 1856. He was re-elected in 1916, in a much closer presidential contest. During his first term, Wilson satisfied the request of Southerners in his cabinet and instituted overt racial segregation throughout federal government workplaces, as well as racial discrimination in hiring. During World War I, American military forces were segregated, with black soldiers poorly trained and equipped.

Disfranchisement had far-reaching effects in Congress, where the Democratic Solid South enjoyed &quot;about 25 extra seats in Congress for each decade between 1903 and 1953&quot;. Also, the Democratic dominance in the South meant that southern Senators and Representatives became entrenched in Congress. They favored seniority privileges in Congress, which became the standard by 1920, and Southerners controlled chairmanships of important committees, as well as leadership of the national Democratic Party. During the Great Depression, legislation establishing numerous national social programs were passed without the representation of African Americans, leading to gaps in program coverage and discrimination against them in operations. In addition, because black Southerners were not listed on local voter rolls, they were automatically excluded from serving in local courts. Juries were all white across the South.

Political enfranchisement expanded with passage of the Voting Rights Act of 1965, which authorized the federal government to monitor voter registration practices and elections where populations were historically underrepresented, and to enforce constitutional voting rights. The challenge to voting rights has continued into the 21st century, as shown by numerous court cases in 2016 alone, though attempts to restrict voting rights for political advantage have not been confined to the Southern states. Another method of seeking political advantage through the voting system is the gerrymandering of electoral boundaries, as was the case of North Carolina, which in January 2018 was declared by a federal court to be unconstitutional. Such cases are expected to reach the Supreme Court.

====Recent====

State governments have had the right to establish requirements for voters, voter registration, and conduct of elections. Since the founding of the nation, legislatures have gradually expanded the franchise (sometimes following federal constitutional amendments), from certain propertied white men to almost universal adult suffrage of age 18 and over, with the notable exclusion of people convicted of some crimes. Expansion of suffrage was made on the basis of lowering property requirements, granting suffrage to freedmen and restoring suffrage in some states to free people of color following the American Civil War, to women (except Native American women) in 1920, all Native Americans in 1924, and people over the age of 18 in the 1970s. Public interest groups focus on fighting disfranchisement in the United States amid rising concerns that new restrictions on voting are become more common.

====Washington, D.C.====

When the District of Columbia was established as the national capital, with lands contributed by Maryland and Virginia, its residents were not allowed to vote for local or federal representatives, in an effort to prevent the district from endangering the national government. Congress had a committee, appointed from among representatives elected to the House, that administered the city and district in lieu of local or state government. Residents did not vote for federal representatives who were appointed to oversee them.

In 1804, US Congress cancelled holding US presidential elections in Washington, D.C. or allowing residents to vote in them. Amendment 23 was passed by Congress and ratified in 1964 to restore the ability of District residents to vote in presidential elections.

In 1846, the portion of Washington, D.C. contributed from Virginia was &quot;retrocessioned&quot; (returned) to Virginia to protect slavery. People residing there (in what is now Alexandria), vote in local, Virginia and US elections.

Congress uses the same portion of the US Constitution to exclusively manage local and State level law for the citizens of Washington, D.C. and US military bases in the US. Until 1986, military personnel living on bases were considered to have special status as national representatives and prohibited from voting in elections where their bases were located. In 1986, Congress passed a law to enable US military personnel living on bases in the US to vote in local and state elections.

The position of non-voting delegate to Congress from the District was reestablished in 1971. The delegate cannot vote for bills before the House, nor floor votes, but may vote for some procedural and committee matters. In 1973, the District of Columbia Home Rule Act reestablished local government after a hundred-year gap, with regular local elections for mayor and other posts. They do not elect a US senator. People seeking standard representation for the 600,000 District of Columbia residents describe their status as being disfranchised in relation to the federal government. They do vote in presidential elections.

Until 2009, no other NATO (US military allies) or OECD country (US industrialized allies) had disfranchised citizens of their respective national capitals for national legislature elections. No US state prohibits residents of capitals from voting in state elections either, and their cities are contained within regular representative state and congressional districts.

====Puerto Rico====

U.S. federal law applies to Puerto Rico, although Puerto Rico is not a state. Due to the Federal Relations Act of 1950, all federal laws that are &quot;not locally inapplicable&quot; are automatically the law of the land in Puerto Rico (39 Stat. 954, 48 USCA 734). According to ex-Chief of the Puerto Rico Supreme Court Jose Trias Monge, &quot;no federal law has ever been found to be locally inapplicable to Puerto Rico. Puerto Ricans were conscripted into the U.S. armed forces; they have fought in every war since they became U.S. citizens in 1917. Puerto Rico residents are subject to most U.S. taxes.

Contrary to common misconception, residents of Puerto Rico pay some U.S. federal taxes and contribute to Social Security, Medicare and other programs through payroll taxes. But, these American citizens have no Congressional representation nor do they vote in U.S. presidential elections.

Juan Torruella and other scholars argue that the U.S. national-electoral process is not a democracy due to issues related to lack of voting rights in Puerto Rico and representation. Both the Puerto Rican Independence Party and the New Progressive Party reject Commonwealth status. The remaining political organization, the Popular Democratic Party has officially stated that it favors fixing the remaining &quot;deficits of democracy&quot; that the Clinton and Bush administrations publicly recognized through Presidential Task Force Reports.

== Due to disability==

Failure to make adequate provision for disabled electors can result in the selective disfranchisement of disabled people. Accessibility issues need to be considered in electoral law, voter registration, provisions for postal voting, the selection of polling stations, the physical equipment of those polling stations and the training of polling station staff. This disfranchisement may be a deliberate facet of electoral law, a consequence of a failure to consider the needs of anyone other than non-disabled electors, or an ongoing failure to respond to identified shortcomings in provision.

Note that in the case of disabled voters the issue may be actual loss of the franchise of someone previously able to vote, rather that &quot;ab initio&quot; disfranchisement. This may result from the transition from non-disabled to disabled, from changes in the effects of a disability, or changes in the accessibility of the electoral process.

===Access issues===
Access presents special difficulties for disabled voters.
*Eligibility—Some nations restrict the franchise based on measured intellectual capacity. Potential voters with learning impairments, mental health issues, or neurological impairments may also find themselves barred from voting by law.
*Registration—Registration difficulties may disfranchise disabled people through inadequate access provisions. For instance the United Kingdom (UK) Electoral Register is updated annually by a largely paper-based process; this provides poor accessibility to people with visual or learning impairments.
*Postal Voting—Postal voting for disabled voters requires ballots that are appropriate for visually impaired voters. The lack of a private, accessible voting booth makes postal voting inappropriate for others with specific physical and other disabilities.
*Polling Stations—Polling stations must offer the same physical accessibility that apply to other public facilities (parking, ramps, etc.) There must be sufficient polling stations to minimize queueing, which discriminates against those with mobility, pain or fatigue-based impairments. In 2005, 68% of polling stations in the UK were potentially inaccessible to disabled voters.

*Equipment—Polling stations must be clearly signposted. Low-to-the-ground polling booths and voting equipment must be available. Equipment must enable independent voting by visually and/or physically impaired voters. In 2005, 30% of UK polling stations were not in compliance with the law that requires a large print ballot and a physical template.
*Staff—Staff must understand the necessity of taking steps to ensure access and be able to show voters how to use equipment such as physical templates, as well as in &quot;disability etiquette&quot; to avoid patronizing these voters.

=== Campaigns for improvement ===
The disability rights movement in the UK has increased attention on electoral accessibility. Campaigns such as Scope&#x27;s &#x27;Polls Apart&#x27; have exposed violations at polling stations.

== Based on criminal conviction ==

The exclusion from voting of people otherwise eligible to vote due to conviction of a criminal offense is usually restricted to the more serious class of crimes. In some common law jurisdictions, those are felonies, hence the popular term felony disenfranchisement. In the US, those are generally crimes of incarceration for a duration of more than a year and/or a fine exceeding $1000. Jurisdictions vary as to whether they make such disfranchisement permanent, or restore suffrage after a person has served a sentence, or completed parole or probation. Felony disenfranchisement is one among the collateral consequences of criminal conviction and the loss of rights due to conviction for criminal offense.

Proponents of disenfranchising those convicted of crimes have argued that persons who commit felonies have &#x27;broken&#x27; the social contract, and have thereby given up their right to participate in a civil society. Some argue that felons have shown poor judgment, and that they should therefore not have a voice in the political decision-making process. Opponents have argued that such disfranchisement restricts and conflicts with principles of universal suffrage. Voter restrictions affect civic and communal participation in general. Opponents argue that felony disenfranchisement can create political incentives to skew criminal law in favor of disproportionately targeting groups who are political opponents of those who hold power.

In Western countries, felony disenfranchisement can be traced back to ancient Greek and Roman traditions: removal of the franchise was commonly imposed as part of the punishment on those convicted of &quot;infamous&quot; crimes, as part of their &quot;civil death,&quot; whereby these persons would lose all rights and claim to property. Most medieval common law jurisdictions developed punishments that provided for some form of exclusion from the community for felons, ranging from execution on sight to exclusion from community processes.

===Asia and Oceania===
==== Australia ====
At Federation in Australia the &quot;Commonwealth Franchise Act 1902&quot; denied the franchise to vote to anyone &#x27;attainted of treason, or who had been convicted and is under sentence or subject to be sentenced for any offence ... punishable by imprisonment for one year or longer&#x27;.

In 1983 this disqualification was relaxed and prisoners serving a sentence for a crime punishable under the law for less than a maximum five years were allowed to vote. A further softening occurred in 1995 when the loss of voting rights was limited to those serving a sentence of five years or longer, although earlier that year the Keating government had been planning legislation to extend voting rights to all prisoners. Disenfranchisement does not continue after release from jail/prison.

The Howard government legislated in 2006 to ban all prisoners from voting. In 2007, the High Court of Australia in &quot;Roach v Electoral Commissioner&quot; found that the Australian constitution enshrined a limited right to vote, which meant that citizens serving relatively short prison sentences (generally less than three years) cannot be barred from voting. The threshold of three years or more sentence will only result in removal of a prisoner&#x27;s right to vote in federal elections. Depending on the threshold of exclusion which is distinct in each state, a prisoner may be able to vote in either state elections or federal elections. For example, prisoners in New South Wales serving a sentence of longer than one year are not entitled to vote in state elections.

==== New Zealand ====
In New Zealand, people who are in prison are not entitled to enroll while they are in prison. Persons who are convicted of electoral offenses in the past three years cannot vote or stand for office. In November 2018, the New Zealand Supreme Court ruled that such restrictions are inconsistent with the nation&#x27;s Bill of Rights.

==== India ====
Pursuant to Section 62 Subsection 5 of the Representation of the People Act, 1951, all convicted prisoners, detained prisoners and persons who are in police custody in India are disqualified from voting. This law has been challenged in court, most notably in the Praveen Kumar Chaudhary vs Election Commission of India case, but the plaintiffs were unsuccessful.

In addition pursuant to Section 62 Subsection 2 of the Representation of the People Act, 1951 a person is ineligible to vote if he or she is subjected to the disqualifications “referred to in section 16 of the Representation of the People Act, 1950 (43 of 1950)”. Section 16 of the Representation of the People Act, 1950 refers to persons disqualified from registering in an electoral roll due to “corrupt practices and other offenses in connection with elections” (Please see Section 16 of the Representation of the People Act, 1950 and Section 62 Subsection 2 of the Representation of the People Act, 1951).

No person is ineligible to vote in India solely by reason of being on parole. For example, Shamsher Singh, who was convicted of the assassination of former Punjab Chief Minister Beant Singh, voted for the first time after he was released on parole while serving a sentence of life imprisonment (Please see news article dated February 20, 2022, from the Tribune News Service entitled, “Out on parole, Beant Singh murder convict Shamsher Singh votes for first time in Patiala”).

==== Taiwan ====
In Taiwan the abrogation of political rights is a form of punishment used in sentencing, available only for some crimes or along with a sentence of death or imprisonment for life. Rights that are suspended in such a sentence is the right to qualifications for being a public official or becoming a candidate for public office (including those by elections, national exams, or direct appointment), But still have the right to vote.

==== China ====
In China, there is a similar punishment of Deprivation of Political Rights.

===== Hong Kong =====
On 8 December 2008, Leung Kwok Hung (Long Hair), member of Hong Kong&#x27;s popularly elected Legislative Council (LegCo), and two prison inmates, successfully challenged disenfranchisement provisions in the LegCo electoral laws. The court found blanket disfranchisement of prisoners to be in violation of Article 26 of the Basic Law and Article 21 of the Bill of Rights and the denial to persons in custody of access to polling stations as against the law. The government introduced a bill to repeal the provisions of the law disenfranchising persons convicted of crimes (even those against the electoral system) as well as similar ones found in other electoral laws, and it made arrangements for polling stations to be set up at detention centers and prisons. LegCo passed the bill, and it took effect from 31 October 2009, even though no major elections were held until the middle of 2011.

=== Europe ===
In general, during the recent centuries, the European countries have increasingly made suffrage more accessible. This has included retaining disenfranchisement in fewer and fewer cases, including for criminal offenses. Moreover, most European states, including most of those outside the European Union, have ratified the European Convention on Human Rights, and thereby agreed to respect the decisions of the European Court of Human Rights. In the case &quot;Hirst v United Kingdom (No 2)&quot; the Court in 2005 found general rules for automatic disfranchisements resulting from convictions to be contrary to the European Convention on Human Rights. This ruling applied equally for prisoners and for ex-convicts. It did not exclude the possibility of disfranchisement as a consequence of deliberation in individual cases (such as that of Mohammed Bouyeri ). The United Kingdom has not respected this Court opinion, although it is a signatory to the convention (see below).

==== Germany ====
In Germany, all convicts are allowed to vote while in prison unless the loss of the right to vote is part of the sentence; courts can only apply this sentence for specific &quot;political&quot; crimes (treason, high treason, electoral fraud, intimidation of voters, etc.) and for a duration of two to five years. All convicts sentenced to at least one year in prison automatically lose the right to be elected in public elections for a duration of five years, and lose all positions they held as a result of such an election.

In Germany the law calls on prisons to encourage prisoners to vote. Only those convicted of electoral fraud and crimes undermining the &quot;democratic order&quot;, such as treason, are barred from voting while in prison. In Germany the disenfranchisement by special court order lasts 2–5 years after which the right to vote is reinstated. The described special court orders rarely ever occur, so that about 1-2 persons a year in all of Germany lose their right to vote this way.

====Ireland====
For elections in the Republic of Ireland, there is no disenfranchisement based on criminal conviction, and prisoners remain on the electoral register at their pre-imprisonment address. Prior to 2006, the grounds for postal voting did not include imprisonment, and hence those in prison on election day were in practice unable to vote, although those on temporary release could do so. In 2000 the High Court ruled that this breached the Constitution, and the government drafted a bill extending postal voting to prisoners on remand or serving sentences of less than six months. In 2001, the Supreme Court overturned the High Court ruling and the bill was withdrawn. Following the 2005 ECHR ruling in the &quot;Hirst&quot; case, the Electoral (Amendment) Act 2006 was passed to allow postal voting by all prisoners.

====Italy====
In Italy, the most serious offenses involve the loss of voting rights, while for less serious offenses disqualification the judge can choose if there will be some disenfranchisement. Recently, the &quot;decree Severino&quot; added a loss of only the right to stand for an election, against some offenders above a certain threshold of imprisonment: it operates administratively, with fixed duration and without intervention of the court. Many court actions have been presented, but the electoral disputes follows antiquated rules and the danger of causes seamless in terms of eligibility and incompatibility is very high, also at local level.

==== United Kingdom ====
The United Kingdom suspends suffrage of some but not all prisoners. For example, civil prisoners sentenced for nonpayment of fines can vote. Prior to the judgment in &quot;Hirst v United Kingdom (No 2)&quot;, convicted prisoners had the right to vote in law but without assistance by prison authorities, voting was unavailable to them. In Hirst, the European Court of Human Rights ruled that First Protocol Article 3 requires Member States to proactively support voting by authorized inmates. In the UK, as of 2009 this policy is under review as in other European countries like Italy.

Lord Falconer of Thoroton, former Secretary of State for Constitutional Affairs, stated that the ruling may result in some, but not all, prisoners being able to vote. The consultation is to be the subject of Judicial Review proceedings in the High Court. Separate challenges by the General Secretary of the Association of Prisoners, Ben Gunn, by way of petition to the European Union Parliament, and John Hirst to the Committee of Ministers are underway.

In the United Kingdom, prohibitions from voting are codified in section 3 and 3A of the Representation of the People Act 1983. Excluded are incarcerated criminals (including those sentenced by courts-martial, those unlawfully at large from such sentences, and those committed to psychiatric institutions as a result of a criminal court sentencing process). Civil prisoners sentenced (for non-payment of fines, or contempt of court, for example), and those on remand unsentenced retain the right to vote.

The UK was previously subject to Europe-wide rules due to various treaties and agreements associated with its membership of the European Union. The Act does not apply to elections to the European Parliament. Following &quot;Hirst v United Kingdom (No 2)&quot; (2005), in which the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) ruled such a ban to be disproportionate, the policy was reviewed by the UK government. In 2005 the Secretary of State for Constitutional Affairs, Lord Falconer of Thoroton, stated that the review may result in the UK allowing some prisoners to vote. In 2010 the UK was still reviewing the policy, following an &quot;unprecedented warning&quot; from the Council of Europe. The UK government position was then that:

Parliament voted in favor of maintaining disenfranchisement of prisoners in 2011 in response to Government plans to introduce legislation. Since then the Government has repeatedly stated that prisoners will not be given the right to vote in spite of the ECHR ruling.

In response to the ECHR ruling, Lord Chancellor and Secretary of State for Justice Chris Grayling produced a draft Voting Eligibility (Prisoners) Bill for discussion by a Joint Committee, incorporating two clear options for reform and one which would retain the blanket ban.

In an attempt to put an end to the embittered standoff between the Human Rights Court and national courts, in 2017 the Government promised to marginally extend the franchise.

====Other European countries====

Several other European countries permit disenfranchisement by special court order, including France and the Netherlands.

In several other European countries, no disenfranchisements due to criminal convictions exist. European countries that allow inmates to vote (as of 2012) include Albania, Croatia, the Czech Republic, Denmark, Finland, Ireland, Latvia, Lithuania, Montenegro, North Macedonia, Norway, Serbia, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, and Ukraine.

Moreover, many European countries encourage people to vote, such as by making pre-voting in other places than the respective election locales easily accessible. This often includes possibilities for prisoners to pre-vote from the prison itself. This is the case for example in Finland.

===Middle East===
==== Israel ====
Inmates are allowed to vote in Israel and ballot boxes are present in prisons on election day. They do not suffer disfranchisement following release from prison after serving their sentence, parole, or probation. Neither courts nor prison authorities have the power to disqualify any person from exercising the right to vote in national elections, whatever the cause of imprisonment.

=== North America ===
==== Canada ====

Canada allows inmates to vote. Section 3 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms grants &quot;every citizen of Canada&quot; the right to vote, without further qualification, a constitutional right upheld as to inmates in &quot;Sauvé v Canada (Chief Electoral Officer)&quot; [2002].

==== United States ====
Many states intentionally retract the franchise from convicted felons, but differ as to when or if the franchise can be restored. In those states, felons are also prohibited from voting in federal elections, even if their convictions were for state crimes.

Maine and Vermont allow prison inmates as well as probationers and parolees to vote.

Twenty states (Alaska, Arkansas, Georgia, Idaho, Iowa, Kansas, Louisiana, Maryland, Minnesota, Missouri, Nebraska, Nevada, New Mexico, North Carolina, Oklahoma, South Carolina, Texas, Washington, West Virginia, and Wisconsin) do not allow persons convicted of a felony to vote while serving a sentence, but automatically restore the franchise to the person upon completion of a sentence. In Iowa, in July 2005, Governor Tom Vilsack issued an executive order restoring the right to vote for all persons who have completed supervision, which the Iowa Supreme Court upheld on October 31, 2005.

Fifteen states (Hawaii, Illinois, Indiana, Massachusetts, Michigan, Montana, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, North Dakota, Ohio, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, and Utah) plus the District of Columbia allow probationers and parolees to vote, but not inmates.

Four states (California, Colorado, Connecticut, and South Dakota) allow probationers to vote, but not inmates or parolees.

Eight states (Alabama, Arizona, Delaware, Florida, Kentucky, Mississippi, Tennessee, and Wyoming) allow some, but not all, persons with felony convictions to vote after having completed their sentences. Some have qualifications of this: for example, Delaware does not restore the franchise until five years after release of a person. Similarly, Kentucky requires that the person take action to gain restoration of the franchise.

One state (Virginia) permanently disfranchises persons with felony convictions. In Virginia, former Governor Terry McAuliffe used his executive power in 2017 to restore voting rights to about 140,000 people with criminal backgrounds in the state.

Disfranchisement due to criminal conviction, particularly after a sentence is served, has been opposed by the Sentencing Project, an organization in the United States working to reduce arbitrary prison sentences for minor crimes and to ameliorate the negative effects of incarceration to enable persons to rejoin society after completing sentences. Its website provides a wealth of statistical data that reflects opposing views on the issue, and data from the United States government and various state governments about the practice of felony disfranchisement.

===Other countries===
In some countries, such as China and Portugal, disfranchisement due to criminal conviction is an exception, meted out separately in a particular sentence. Losing voting rights is usually imposed on a person convicted of a crime against the state (see civil death) or one related to election or public office.

Peru allows inmates to vote.

In South Africa the constitution protects the right of prisoners to vote. The Constitutional Court has struck down two attempts by the government to deny the vote to convicted criminals in prison.

<doc id="79907" wikidata="Q875382" url="?curid=79907" title="The Meaning of Liff">
<text>The Meaning of Liff is a humorous dictionary of toponymy and etymology, written by Douglas Adams and John Lloyd, published in the United Kingdom in 1983 () and the United States in 1984 ().

==Content==
The book is a &quot;dictionary of things that there aren&#x27;t any words for yet&quot;. Rather than inventing new words, Adams and Lloyd picked a number of existing place-names and assigned interesting meanings to them, meanings that can be regarded as on the verge of social existence and ready to become recognisable entities.

All the words listed are toponyms and describe common feelings and objects for which there is no current English word. Examples are &quot;Shoeburyness&quot; (&quot;The vague uncomfortable feeling you get when sitting on a seat that is still warm from somebody else&#x27;s bottom&quot;) and &quot;Plymouth&quot; (&quot;To relate an amusing story to someone without remembering that it was they who told it to you in the first place&quot;).

The book cover usually bears the tagline &quot;This book will change your life&quot;, either as part of its cover or as an adhesive label. &quot;Liff&quot; (a village near Dundee in Scotland) is then defined in the book as &quot;A book, the contents of which are totally belied by its cover. For instance, any book the dust jacket of which bears the words, &#x27;This book will change your life&#x27;.&quot;

==Origin and publication==
According to Adams&#x27;s account, the idea behind &quot;The Meaning of Liff&quot; grew out of an old school game and started when he and Lloyd were on holiday together in Corfu in 1978 during the writing of the first Hitchhiker&#x27;s novel. This idea was used as part of the &quot;Not the Nine O&#x27;Clock News&quot; spin-off book &quot;Not 1982&quot; (), where they were headed &quot;Today&#x27;s new word from the Oxtail English Dictionary&quot;. The suggestion of turning this into a complete book in itself came from Faber MD Matthew Evans. The bulk of the text was written by Adams and Lloyd in Summer 1982 in Malibu, California.

Essentially the same idea was used by the English humourist Paul Jennings in an article &quot;Ware, Wye, Watford&quot;, published in the late 1950s. Adams speculated that the teacher who originated the school game may have done so after reading the article. He sent a note of apology to Jennings. Fellow humourist Miles Kington defended Adams and Lloyd in his column in &quot;The Times&quot;, noting a difference in style.

The book was released in the UK in November 1983 in time for the Christmas market. It was a commercial success for Pan Books.

The title of the book was chosen to be very similar to Monty Python&#x27;s film &quot;The Meaning of Life&quot; that was being produced at the same time, after Douglas Adams called Terry Jones to ask if it would be OK. Adams&#x27;s idea was that the potential confusion with the film&#x27;s script would help to sell more copies of the book. In fact, in the beginning of the Monty Python film, the gravestone with the title &quot;The Meaning of Liff&quot; appears before a lightning bolt strikes the last F and converts it to an E.

==Versions==
A revised and expanded edition of The Meaning of Liff, with about twice as many definitions, was published in 1990 as The Deeper Meaning of Liff (UK Edition: , US Edition: ), though the original remains in print. Some of the new words in &quot;Deeper&quot; had previously appeared in a Liff piece by Adams, Lloyd and Stephen Fry in &quot;The Utterly Utterly Merry Comic Relief Christmas Book&quot; (1986). The main differences between the two editions (for either version of the book) are those of American English v. British English spellings, though &quot;The Deeper Meaning of Liff&quot; contains different definitions for both the word &quot;Glossop&quot; and the titular word &quot;Liff&quot;. In &quot;The Deeper Meaning of Liff&quot;, Liff is defined as a phenomenon for which there is no word.

Another edition in the series, &quot;Afterliff&quot;, has been released, with more entries contributed by Lloyd, Jon Canter and Douglas Adams&#x27;s daughter Polly.

On 15 August 2013, a 30th anniversary deluxe edition was published.

A German adaptation was made by Sven Böttcher under the title &quot;Der tiefere Sinn des Labenz&quot;, published in 1992 (). The meanings are translated from the original but are matched to place names that convey the humorous effect in German. The most recent edition includes both the German adaptation and the English original ().
In 1989, a Dutch version was published under the title &quot;Kunt U Breukelen?&quot; by Justus van Oel (Nijgh &amp; van Ditmar, ), utilising the same book size format as the standard UK version, 9.1 x 16.8 cm (3½&quot; x 6½&quot;). The book used place names mainly from the Netherlands, as well as a handful from neighbouring Belgium and Luxembourg. There was no hardback edition, and neither was &quot;The Deeper Meaning of Liff&quot; adapted for the Dutch market. It was reissued in 2000 with a different cover.

The Finnish adaptations &quot;Elimäen tarkoitus&quot; and &quot;Elimäen perimmäinen tarkoitus&quot; were published in 1996 and 1997 ( and ).

Comedian Anders Lund Madsen wrote a Danish version with the title &quot;Madsens ÆØÅ - Dictionary of things for which there are as yet, funnily enough, no words&quot;, published 1997. It is not a translation; instead it is stated as an &quot;Idea stolen from Douglas Adams &amp; John Lloyd&quot; and &quot;The Meaning of Liff&quot; is mentioned in the publisher&#x27;s copyright text.

==Reception==
Dave Langford reviewed &quot;The Meaning of Liff&quot; for &quot;White Dwarf&quot; #49, and stated that &quot;it&#x27;s very funny. &quot;Liff&quot; evolved from a parlour game in which you decide what a placename &quot;should&quot; mean, as in Paul Jennings&#x27;s 1964 essay which explained that Bodmin was a unit of work equal to one-sixtieth of a man-hour.&quot;

<text>In Greek mythology, Coeus (; , &quot;query, questioning&quot; or &quot;intelligence&quot;), also called Polus, was one of the Titans, one of the three groups of children born to Uranus (Sky) and Gaia (Earth).

== Mythology ==
Coeus was an obscure figure, and like most of the Titans he played no active part in Greek mythology—he appears only in lists of Titans—but was primarily important for his descendants. With his sister, &quot;shining&quot; Phoebe, Coeus fathered two daughters, Leto and Asteria. Leto copulated with Zeus (the son of fellow Titans Cronus and Rhea) and bore Artemis and Apollo. Asteria became the mother of Hecate by Perses (son of fellow Titan Crius and half-sister Eurybia).

Along with the other Titans, Coeus was overthrown by Zeus and the other Olympians in the Titanomachy. Afterwards, he and all his brothers (sans Oceanus) were imprisoned in Tartarus by Zeus. Coeus, later overcome with madness, broke free from his bonds and attempted to escape his imprisonment, but was repelled by Cerberus.

Tacitus wrote that Coeus was the first inhabitant of the island of Kos, which claimed to be the birthplace of his daughter Leto. Coeus&#x27;s name was modified from (&quot;Koîos&quot;) to (&quot;Kōios&quot;), leading to his association with the island.

Eventually Zeus freed the Titans, presumably including Coeus.

<text>Rafael Moreno Aranzadi (23 May 1892 – 1 March 1922), known as Pichichi, was a Spanish footballer who played as a forward. He is known for the Pichichi Trophy named in his honour.

He played for Athletic Bilbao during the 1910s and 1920s. He received his nickname because of his frail build.

==Club career==
Born in Bilbao, Biscay, Pichichi played in his first Copa del Rey final in March 1913 as Athletic Bilbao, his sole club, lost 1–0 against Racing Club de Irún. Later the same year, on 21 August, the same opponents, now renamed Real Unión, were invited to play the inaugural game at San Mamés Stadium, and he scored the very first goal at the ground; two months later, he also scored the first goal at Real Sociedad&#x27;s new Atotxa Stadium in the opening fixture for that venue.

Easily identifiable on the pitch due to a white cloth he tied to his head, Pichichi subsequently played in five other domestic cup finals, winning four and netting a hat-trick in the 1915 final as Athletic beat RCD Español 5–0. After returning from the 1920 Olympics, some supporters felt that his performances were no longer measuring up to his &#x27;star&#x27; status, and this criticism caused him to abruptly quit playing altogether in order to become a referee.

Pichichi died on 2 March 1922 at age 29 from a sudden attack of typhus, with the grief among the fans at the shock news heightened with regret for the acrimonious manner in which their hero had departed the club. He scored a total of 83 goals in 89 games for his only team.

==International career==
In 1920, Pichichi was a member of the very first Spain national team that played at the Summer Olympic Games in Belgium. He earned five senior caps in one month, his debut coming on 28 August in a 1–0 win against Denmark.

==Personal life==
Pichichi&#x27;s father was mayor of Bilbao, and he was Miguel de Unamuno&#x27;s nephew. Both he and his future wife were immortalised in a painting by Aurelio Arteta (although it is said that the image originally depicted teammate José María Belauste, and came to be known as a representation of Pichichi and his fiancée following his death).

In 1926, a bust was erected in Pichichi&#x27;s honour at the San Mamés Stadium. It was tradition for teams visiting the ground for the first time pay homage by leaving a bouquet of flowers at its base. Despite concerns that it might not be accommodated at Athletic&#x27;s new ground, a suitable spot was identified at the entrance to the players&#x27; tunnel, allowing the tradition to continue at the new location from 2013 onwards.

In 1953, Spanish sports newspaper &quot;Diario Marca&quot; introduced the Pichichi Trophy in his honour. It was awarded each year to the top scorers in La Liga and Segunda División.

==Honours==

<text>The Amiga 2000 (A2000) is a personal computer released by Commodore in March 1987. It was introduced as a &quot;big box&quot; expandable variant of the Amiga 1000 but quickly redesigned to share most of its electronic components with the contemporary Amiga 500 for cost reduction. Expansion capabilities include two 3.5&quot; drive bays (one of which is used by the included floppy drive) and one 5.25&quot; bay that could be used by a 5.25&quot; floppy drive (for IBM PC compatibility), a hard drive, or CD-ROM once they became available.

The Amiga 2000 is the first Amiga model that allows expansion cards to be added internally. SCSI host adapters, memory cards, CPU cards, network cards, graphics cards, serial port cards, and PC compatibility cards were available, and multiple expansions can be used simultaneously without requiring an expansion cage like the Amiga 1000 does. Not only does the Amiga 2000 include five Zorro II card slots, the motherboard also has four PC ISA slots, two of which are inline with Zorro II slots for use with the A2088 bridgeboard, which adds IBM PC XT compatibility to the A2000.

The Amiga 2000 was the most versatile and expandable Amiga computer until the Amiga 3000 was introduced three years later.

The machine is reported to have sold 124,500 units in Germany.

==Features==

Aimed at the high-end market, the original Europe-only model adds a Zorro II backplane, implemented in programmable logic, to the custom Amiga chipset used in the Amiga 1000. Later improved models have redesigned hardware using the more highly integrated Amiga 500 chipset, with the addition of a gate-array called &quot;Buster&quot;, which integrates the Zorro subsystem. This also enables hand-off of the system control to a coprocessor slot device, and implements the full video slot for add-on video devices.

Like the earlier Amiga 1000 and most IBM PC compatibles of the era (but unlike the Amiga 500), the A2000 comes in a desktop case with a separate keyboard. The case is taller than the A1000 to accommodate expansion cards, two 3.5&quot; and one 5.25&quot; drive bays. The A2000&#x27;s case lacks the &quot;keyboard garage&quot; of the Amiga 1000 but has space for five Zorro II expansion slots, two 16-bit and two 8-bit ISA slots, a CPU upgrade slot and a video slot. Unlike the A1000, the A2000&#x27;s motherboard includes a battery-backed real-time clock.

The Amiga 2000 offers graphics capabilities exceeded among its contemporaries only by the Macintosh II, which sold for about twice the price of a comparably-outfitted Amiga 2000 additionally equipped with the IBM PC Compatible bridgeboard and 5.25&quot; floppy disk drive (which was important for real-world interoperability at this time). Also like the A1000, the A2000 was sold only by specialty computer dealers. It was originally announced at a price of .

==Variants==
The Amiga 2000 was designed with an open architecture. Commodore&#x27;s engineers believed that the company would probably be unsuccessful in matching the rate of system obsolesce and replacement then common in the PC industry, with new models every year or so. Commodore&#x27;s approach was to build a single system architecture that could span different models. Commodore was so successful at this that Info magazine judged that the A2000 would not become obsolete &quot;until well after the turn of the century&quot; at the earliest.

The final design was the result of an internal battle within Commodore, which pitted the USA division, who wanted to build a system more like the Amiga 3000 (and 1000), against the German division, which was fresh from the successful introduction of the first Commodore PC-compatible systems and planned to include this capability in the Amiga 2000 from the start. The bottom-line practicality of the German design won out, and the final A2000 shipped with not only Zorro II slots, but a complement of PC standard (for the day) ISA slots.

This architecture was subject to major revisions. The original motherboard was based on the previous Amiga 1000 with the addition of expansion slots, and so suffered all the same limitations. This was soon replaced by the &quot;B2000-CR&quot; version designed by Dave Haynie and Terry Fisher (whose names are printed on the board), which was instead based on the Amiga 500&#x27;s improved design. The practical differences are that the early 2000 motherboard only has 512 kilobytes of ram installed, cannot be upgraded with newer versions of the chipset, requires the original processor to be removed when installing a processor card, and cannot use a video slot mounted flickerfixer.

The original Amiga 2000 shipped with just a single floppy drive for storage. This was followed up fairly early by the Amiga 2000/HD, which bundled an Amiga 2090 hard drive controller and a SCSI-based hard drive. In 1988, Commodore shipped the Amiga 2500/20, which added the Amiga 2620 CPU card to the CPU slot, a 14.3 MHz 68020, a 68881 FPU, and a 68851 MMU to the A2000, along with 2 MB of 32-bit-wide memory. The A2000&#x27;s original 68000 CPU remained installed on the motherboard of these machines and could be switched to by holding down the right mouse button when powering on the computer for better compatibility. In 1989 this model was replaced by the Amiga 2500/30, which added an Amiga 2630 CPU card: 25 MHz 68030 and the 68882 FPU with up to 4 MB of 32-bit memory. The A2630 card can also take a memory expansion daughter card, capable of supporting up to 64 MB of additional memory. Commodore built an in-house prototype of this, but never released one.

===Amiga 1500 ===
In 1990, Commodore UK sold a variant of the A2000, the A1500, for £999. The model designation was not officially sanctioned by Commodore International. The A1500 shipped with dual floppy drives, and 1 MB of ChipRAM as standard. Initial units came with Kickstart 1.3 (and thus AmigaOS 1.3), though the Original Chipset onboard includes a later Agnus revision allowing the 1MB of ChipRAM. Early machines were bundled with a Commodore 1084SD1 monitor. Later machines came with the ECS chipset and AmigaOS 2.04. The second floppy drive replaces the hard disk drive. The A1500 has no hard disk drive as standard and as the only significant difference the A1500s could be upgraded into A2000/HDs by addition of a hard disk controller (and associated drive).

There was also a replacement case kit for the Amiga 500 made by Checkmate Digital and also called A1500.

===Amiga 2500 ===
The Amiga 2500, also known as the A2500, similar to the A1500 is not a distinct model, but simply a marketing name for an Amiga 2000 with a different base configuration. The configuration of an A2500 included a 14.3 MHz Motorola 68020 or 25 MHz 68030-based accelerator card. 68020 versions were referred to as A2500/20, and 68030 versions as A2500/30.&lt;ref name=&quot;Amiga2500/30&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The accelerator cards used by the A2500 (the A2620 and A2630) were also available separately as upgrades for the A2000. The A2620 included a Motorola 68881 FPU and Motorola 68851 MMU, whereas the A2630 included a Motorola 68882 FPU (and MMU built into the 68030).

Because the A2500 has a Motorola 68000 on the motherboard that goes unused, the design is not very cost-effective. A project to replace it with a 68020 on-board began, intending to be a Zorro-II-based 68020 machine, but the project eventually became the Amiga 3000 when Dave Haynie sought to include his new Zorro-III bus.

The A2500 remained in production after the release of the A3000, primarily because the original Video Toaster will not fit in an unmodified A3000 case. Until the release of the Video Toaster 4000, the A2500 was the fastest computer available for use with the Toaster.

A further variant called the A2500UX was also available which was supplied with Amiga Unix and a tape drive.

==Technical information==
The majority of A2000 systems shipped with Commodore&#x27;s Original Chip Set and 1 MB of RAM (512 KB of &quot;chip&quot; RAM and 512 KB additional RAM) and either AmigaOS 1.2 or 1.3. Later revisions shipped with the improved Enhanced Chip Set, 1 MB &quot;chip&quot; RAM and AmigaOS 2.0.

The A2000 shipped with a Motorola 68000 CPU, running at 7.16 MHz (NTSC) or 7.09 MHz (PAL). The CPU can be upgraded to a 68010 by direct replacement. Official and third-party expansion boards, which fit in the CPU expansion slot, feature 68020, 68030, 68040 or 68060 microprocessors. Such upgrades may also accommodate additional RAM, FPUs, MMUs and even SCSI controllers.

Memory capacity varies according to the hardware revision. Certain revisions of the A2000 can be upgraded to accommodate 1 MB of chip RAM by installing an 8372A Agnus chip. Likewise, 2 MB can be accommodated by fitting an 8372B Agnus chip and adding extra memory. There is a practical limit of 8 MB of additional RAM without the use of a CPU expansion card, due to the 68000&#x27;s 24-bit address bus.

The A2000 brought a new capability to the Amiga line, the Zorro II bus. This expansion bus allows installation of compatible hardware through the AutoConfig standard, such as, graphic, sound, and network cards and Parallel ATA, SCSI and USB controllers.

The ISA slots can be activated by use of a bridgeboard, which connects the Zorro II and ISA buses. Such bridgeboards typically feature on-board IBM PC Compatible hardware, including Intel 80286, 80386 or 80486 microprocessors allowing emulation of an entire IBM-PC system in hardware. The remaining ISA slots can then be used with industry standard hardware of the era, such as, network cards, graphics cards and hard drive controllers. In some A2000 models, the two 8-bit ISA slots can also be upgraded to 16-bit by fitting extension edge connectors.

The video slot presents clocks, all 12-bits of digital video, Genlock signals, and some control lines for use to add-on cards. This allows use of dedicated genlocks, display deinterlacers, and video-switching and effects systems such as NewTek&#x27;s Video Toaster.

<doc id="79912" wikidata="Q282019" url="?curid=79912" title="Baronet">
<text>A baronet ( or ; abbreviated Bart or Bt) or the female equivalent, a baronetess (, , or ; abbreviation Btss), is the holder of a baronetcy, a hereditary title awarded by the British Crown. The title of baronet is mentioned as early as the 14th century; however, in its current usage it was created by James I of England in 1611 as a means of raising funds for the crown.

Baronets rank below barons, but seemingly above all knights grand cross, knights commander and knights bachelor of the British chivalric orders, that are in turn below in chivalric precedence than the most senior British chivalric orders of the Garter and the Thistle.

Like all British knights, baronets are addressed as &quot;Sir&quot; and baronetesses as &quot;Dame&quot;. They are conventionally seen to belong to the lesser nobility, although William Thoms in 1844 wrote that:

The precise quality of this dignity is not yet fully determined, some holding it to be the head of the , while others, again, rank Baronets as the lowest of the , because their honour, like that of the higher nobility, is both hereditary and created by patent.
Comparisons with continental titles and ranks are tenuous due to the British system of primogeniture and because claims to baronetcies must be proven; currently the Official Roll of the Baronetage is overseen by the Ministry of Justice. In practice this means that the UK Peerage and Baronetage consists of about 1,200 families (some peers are also baronets), which is roughly less than 0.01% of UK families.

==History of the term==
The term &quot;baronet&quot; has medieval origins. Sir Thomas de La More (1322), describing the Battle of Boroughbridge, mentioned that baronets took part, along with barons and knights. Edward III created eight baronets in 1328.

The title of baronet was initially conferred upon noblemen who lost the right of individual summons to Parliament, and was used in this sense in a statute of Richard II. A similar title of lower rank was banneret.

Present-day baronets date from 1611 when James I granted letters patent to 200 gentlemen of good birth with an income of at least £1,000 a year (equivalent to £ in ). In return for the honour, each was required to pay one pound a day for the upkeep of thirty soldiers for three years (1,095 days), thus amounting to £1,095 (equivalent to £ in ), in those days a very large sum. The money was to help fund the Plantation of Ulster. In 1619, James I established the Baronetage of Ireland; Charles I in 1625 created the Baronetages of Scotland and Nova Scotia. The new baronets were each required to pay 2,000 marks (equivalent to £ in ), or to support six colonial settlers for two years. Over a hundred of these baronetcies, now familiarly known as Scottish baronetcies, survive to this day.

As a result of the Union of England and Scotland in 1707, all future creations were styled baronets of Great Britain. Following the Union of Great Britain and Ireland in 1801, new creations were styled as baronets of the United Kingdom.

Under royal warrants of 1612 and 1613, certain privileges were accorded to baronets. Firstly, no person or persons should have place between baronets and the younger sons of peers. Secondly, the right of knighthood was established for the eldest sons of baronets (this was later revoked by George IV in 1827), and thirdly, baronets were allowed to augment their armorial bearings with the Arms of Ulster on an inescutcheon: &quot;in a field Argent, a Hand Geules (or a bloudy hand)&quot;. These privileges were extended to baronets of Ireland, and for baronets of Scotland the privilege of depicting the Arms of Nova Scotia as an augmentation of honour. The former applies to this day for all baronets of Great Britain and of the United Kingdom created subsequently.

==Conventions==
Like knights, baronets are accorded the style &quot;Sir&quot; before their first name. Baronetesses in their own right use &quot;Dame&quot;, also before their first name, while wives of baronets use &quot;Lady&quot; followed by the husband&#x27;s (marital) surname only, this by longstanding courtesy. Wives of baronets are not baronetesses; only women holding baronetcies in their own right are so styled.

Unlike knighthoods – which apply to the recipient only – a baronetcy is hereditarily entailed. The eldest son of a baronet who is born in wedlock succeeds to a baronetcy upon his father&#x27;s death, but will not be officially recognised until his name is recognised by being placed on the Official Roll. With some exceptions granted with special remainder by letters patent, baronetcies descend through the male line.

A full list of extant baronets appears in &quot;Burke&#x27;s Peerage and Baronetage&quot;, which also published a record of extinct baronetcies.

A baronetcy is not a peerage; so baronets, like knights and junior members of peerage families, are commoners and not peers of the realm. Originally, all first baronets were knighted. Baronets also had other rights, including the right to have the eldest son knighted on his 21st birthday. However, at the beginning of George IV&#x27;s reign, these rights were eroded by orders-in-council on the ground that sovereigns should not necessarily be bound by acts of their predecessors. Although never having been automatically entitled to heraldic supporters, baronets who were also a Knight Grand Cross of a Crown order were allowed them in heredity in the first half of the 19th century.

Baronets of Scotland or Nova Scotia were allowed to augment their armorial bearings with the Arms of Nova Scotia and the privilege of wearing a neck badge signifying &quot;of Nova Scotia&quot;, suspended by an orange-tawny ribbon. This consists of an escutcheon argent with a saltire azure, an inescutcheon of the Royal Arms of Scotland, with an Imperial Crown above the escutcheon, and encircled with the motto &quot;Fax Mentis Honestae Gloria&quot;. This badge may be shown suspended by the ribbon below the escutcheon.

Baronets of England and Ireland applied to King Charles I for permission to wear a badge. Although a badge was worn in the 17th century, it was not until 1929 that King George V granted permission for all baronets (other than those of Scotland) to wear badges.

===Addressing a baronet and the wife of a baronet===
A baronet is referred to and addressed as, for example, &quot;Sir Joseph&quot; (using his forename). The correct style on an envelope for a baronet who has no other titles is &quot;Sir Joseph Bloggs, Bt.&quot; or &quot;Sir Joseph Bloggs, Bart.&quot; A formal letter would commence with the salutation &quot;Dear Sir Joseph&quot;.

The wife of a baronet is addressed and referred to by her married surname, as &quot;Lady Bloggs&quot;; the salutation would be &quot;Dear Lady Bloggs&quot;. Her given name is used only when necessary to distinguish between two holders of the same title. For example, if a baronet has died and the title has passed to his son, the widow (the new baronet&#x27;s mother) will remain &quot;Lady Bloggs&quot; while he (the son) is not married, but if he is or becomes married, his wife becomes &quot;Lady Bloggs&quot; while his mother will be known by the style &quot;Alice, Lady Bloggs&quot;. Alternatively, the mother may prefer to be known as &quot;The Dowager Lady Bloggs&quot;. A previous wife will also become &quot;Alice, Lady Bloggs&quot; to distinguish her from the current wife of the incumbent baronet. She would not be &quot;Lady Alice Bloggs&quot;, a style reserved for the daughters of dukes, marquesses and earls (and now Ladies Companion of the Garter and Ladies of the Thistle without higher styles).

The children of a baronet are not entitled to the use of any courtesy titles.

===Baronetess===
In history, there have been only four baronetesses:

* Dame Mary Bolles, 1st Btss (née Witham) (1579–1662); the only woman apparently to be &quot;created&quot; a baronetess (of Nova Scotia)
* Dame Eleanor Dalyell, 10th Btss (1895–1972), cr. 1685, whose title and estate of The Binns passed to her son, the former Labour politician Tam Dalyell (who chose not to use the title)
* Dame Daisy Dunbar, 8th Btss of Hempriggs (1906–1997), cr. 1706
* Dame Anne Christian Maxwell Macdonald, 11th Btss (née Stirling-Maxwel; 1906–2011) was recognised by the Lyon Court in 2005 as 11th holder of the baronetcy (formerly Stirling-Maxwel/Stirling-Maxwell) under the 1707 remainder and succeeded her father in 1956

In 1976, Lord Lyon King of Arms stated that, without examining the patent of every Scottish baronetcy, he was not in a position to confirm that only these four title creations could pass through female lines.

, there are no living baronetesses.

For a baronetess one should write, for example, &quot;Dame Daisy Smith, Btss&quot; on the envelope. At the head of the letter, one would write &quot;Dear Dame Daisy&quot;, and to refer to her, one would say &quot;Dame Daisy&quot; or &quot;Dame Daisy Smith&quot; (never &quot;Dame Smith&quot;).

===Territorial designations===
All baronetcies are created with a territorial sub-designation; however, only more recent creations duplicating the original creation require territorial designations. So, for example, there have been baronetcies Moore of Colchester, Moore of Hancox, Moore of Kyleburn, and Moore of Moore Lodge.

===Baronetcies with special remainders===
Baronetcies usually descend through heirs male of the body of the grantee, and can rarely be inherited by females or collateral kin, unless created with special remainder, for example:
* with remainder to heirs male forever (Broun baronetcy, &quot;of Colstoun&quot; (1686), Hay baronetcy of Alderston (1703), &quot;etc.&quot;)
* with remainder to the sons of the grantee&#x27;s daughters, and the heirs male of their bodies (Hicking (&quot;later&quot; North) baronetcy, &quot;of Southwell&quot; (1920), &quot;etc.&quot;)
* with remainder to the grantee&#x27;s daughter&#x27;s son (Amcotts baronetcy, &quot;of Kettlethorp&quot; (1796), &quot;etc.&quot;)
* with remainder to the grantee&#x27;s son-in-law (Middleton (&quot;later&quot; Noel) baronetcy, &quot;of The Navy&quot; (1781), Rich baronetcy, &quot;of London&quot; (1676), &quot;etc.&quot;)
* with remainder to the grantee&#x27;s brother(s) (Chapman baronetcy, &quot;of Killua Castle&quot; (1782), Pigot baronetcy, &quot;of Patshull&quot; (1764), White baronetcy of Tuxford and Wallingwells (1802) &quot;etc.&quot;)
* with remainder, in default of male issue of the grantee, to the grantee&#x27;s brothers and to the grantee&#x27;s father&#x27;s second cousin, and the heirs male of their bodies (Robinson baronetcy, &quot;of Rokeby Park&quot; (1730))
* with remainder to tailzie succeeding the grantee in the estate (Dalyell baronetcy of The Binns (1685))
* with remainder specifically excluding the grantee&#x27;s eldest son (Stonhouse baronetcy, &quot;of Radley&quot; (1628))

==Heraldic badges==
===Red Hand of Ulster===

Marking the baronetage&#x27;s origins in the Plantation of Ulster, baronets of England, Ireland, Great Britain or the United Kingdom (i.e., all except baronets of Nova Scotia) can display the Red Hand of Ulster (sinister (left) hand version) as a heraldic badge, being the arms of the ancient kings of Ulster. This badge (or augmentation of honour) is blazoned as follows: &quot;Argent a Hand sinister couped at the wrist extended in pale Gules&quot;. King James I of England established the hereditary Order of Baronets in England on 22 May 1611, in the words of &quot;Collins&#x27; Peerage&quot; (1741): &quot;for the plantation and protection of the whole Kingdom of Ireland, but more especially for the defence and security of the Province of Ulster, and therefore for their distinction those of this order and their descendants may bear the badge (Red Hand of Ulster) in their coats of arms either in canton or an escutcheon at their election&quot;. Since 1929, such baronets may also display the Red Hand of Ulster on its own as a badge, suspended by a ribbon below the shield of arms.

===Arms of Nova Scotia===
Baronets of Nova Scotia, unlike other baronets, do not use the Baronet&#x27;s Badge (of Ulster), but have their own badge showing the escutcheon of the arms of Nova Scotia: &quot;Argent, a Saltire Azure with an inescutcheon of the Royal Arms of Scotland&quot;. From before 1929 to the present, it has been customary practice for such baronets to display this badge on its own suspended by the order&#x27;s ribbon below the shield of arms.
==Number of baronetcies==
The first publication listing all baronetcies ever created was C. J. Parry&#x27;s &quot;Index of Baronetcy Creations&quot; (1967). This listed them in alphabetical order, other than the last five creations (Dodds of West Chiltington, Redmayne of Rushcliffe, Pearson of Gressingham, Finlay of Epping and Thatcher of Scotney). It showed the total number created from 1611 to 1964 to have been 3,482. They include five of Oliver Cromwell, several of which were recreated by Charles II. Twenty-five were created between 1688 and 1784 by James II in exile after his dethronement, by his son James Stuart (&quot;The Old Pretender&quot;) and his grandson Charles Edward Stuart (&quot;Bonnie Prince Charlie&quot;). These &quot;Jacobite baronetcies&quot; were never accepted by the English Crown, have all disappeared and should properly be excluded from the 3,482, making the effective number of creations 3,457. A close examination of Parry&#x27;s publication shows he missed one or two, so there might well have been some more.

As of 2000, including baronetcies where succession was dormant or unproven, there was a total of 1,314 baronetcies divided into five classes of creation included on &quot;The Official Roll of the Baronetage&quot; – 146 of England, 63 of Ireland, 119 of Scotland, 133 of Great Britain and 853 of the United Kingdom.

The total number of baronetcies today is approximately 1,204, although only some 1,020 are on &quot;The Official Roll of the Baronetage&quot;. It is unknown whether some baronetcies remain extant and it may be that nobody can prove himself to be the actual heir. Over 200 baronetcies are now held by peers; and others, such as the Knox line, have been made tenuous by internal family disputes. According to the Ministry of Justice, it is not necessary to prove succession to a baronetcy in order to use the title, but a person cannot be referred to as a baronet in any official capacity unless their name is on the &quot;Official Roll&quot;.

===Baronetage decline since 1965===
There were 1,490 baronetcies extant on 1 January 1965. Since then the number has reduced by 286 through extinction or dormancy: a gross decline of 19.2% (up to 2017). Extant baronetcies numbered about 1,236 in 2015, and 1,204 as of 2017.

Since 1965 only one new baronetcy has been created, for Sir Denis Thatcher on 7 December 1990, husband of a former British prime minister, Margaret Thatcher (later Baroness Thatcher); their only son, Sir Mark Thatcher, succeeded as 2nd Baronet upon his father&#x27;s death in 2003.

Seven baronetcies dormant in 1965 have since been revived: Innes baronetcy, &quot;of Coxton&quot; (1686), Nicolson baronetcy of that Ilk and of Lasswade (1629), Hope baronetcy, &quot;of Kirkliston&quot; (1698), St John (&quot;later&quot; St John-Mildmay) baronetcy, &quot;of Farley&quot; (1772), Maxwell-Macdonald baronetcy of Pollok (1682), Inglis baronetcy, &quot;of Cramond, Edinburgh&quot; (1687) and Von Friesendorff baronetcy, &quot;of Hirdech, Sweden&quot; (1661).

==Premier Baronet==

===England===

The Premier Baronet (of England) is the unofficial title afforded to the current holder of the oldest extant baronetcy in the realm. The Premier Baronet is regarded as the senior member of the Baronetage, and ranks above other baronets (unless they hold a peerage title) in the United Kingdom Order of Precedence. Sir Nicholas Bacon, 14th Baronet, is the current Premier Baronet; his family&#x27;s senior title was created by King James I in 1611.

===Scotland===
The Premier Baronets of Nova Scotia (Scotland) were the Gordon baronets of Gordonstoun and Letterfourie until the title&#x27;s extinction in 1908. Subsequently, the Premier Scottish Baronets are the Innes baronets of that Ilk (cr. 28 May 1625), the present Premier Baronet being Charles Innes-Ker, 11th Duke of Roxburghe.

===Ireland===
The Premier Baronetcy of Ireland was created for Sir Dominic Sarsfield in 1619, and was held by his successors until the attainder of the 4th Viscount Sarsfield in 1691. Since then the descendants of Sir Francis Annesley Bt., the Annesley baronets, have been the Premier Baronets of Ireland; presently Francis William Dighton Annesley, 16th Viscount Valentia.

<text>A viscount ( , for male) or viscountess (, for female) is a title used in certain European countries for a noble of varying status. The status and any domain held by a viscount is a viscountcy. 

In the case of French viscounts, the title is sometimes left untranslated as vicomte .

==Etymology==
The word &quot;viscount&quot; comes from Old French (Modern French: ), itself from Medieval Latin , accusative of , from Late Latin &quot;deputy&quot; + Latin (originally &quot;companion&quot;; later Roman imperial courtier or trusted appointee, ultimately count).

==History==
During the Carolingian Empire, the kings appointed counts to administer provinces and other smaller regions, as governors and military commanders. Viscounts were appointed to assist the counts in their running of the province, and often took on judicial responsibility. The kings strictly prevented the offices of their counts and viscounts from becoming hereditary, in order to consolidate their position and limit chance of rebellion.

The title was in use in Normandy by at least the early 11th century. Similar to the Carolingian use of the title, the Norman viscounts were local administrators, working on behalf of the Duke. Their role was to administer justice and to collect taxes and revenues, often being castellan of the local castle. Under the Normans, the position developed into a hereditary one, an example of such being the viscounts in Bessin. The viscount was eventually replaced by bailiffs, and provosts.

As a rank of the British peerage, it was first recorded in 1440, when John Beaumont was created Viscount Beaumont by King Henry VI. The word &quot;viscount&quot; corresponds in the UK to the Anglo-Saxon &quot;shire reeve&quot; (root of the non-nobiliary, royal-appointed office of sheriff). Thus, early viscounts originally received their titles from the monarch, and not hereditarily; they eventually tended to establish hereditary principalities in the wider sense. The rank is a relatively late introduction to the British system, and on the evening of her coronation in 1838, Queen Victoria recorded in her diary an explanation for this by then-Prime Minister Lord Melbourne (himself a viscount):

I spoke to Ld M. about the numbers of Peers present at the Coronation, &amp; he said it was quite unprecedented. I observed that there were very few Viscounts, to which he replied &quot;There are very few Viscounts,&quot; that they were an old sort of title &amp; not really English; that they came from Vice-Comites; that Dukes &amp; Barons were the only real English titles;—that Marquises were likewise not English, &amp; that people were mere made Marquises, when it was not wished that they should be made Dukes.

==Early modern and contemporary usage==
=== Belgium ===
In Belgium a few families are recognised as Viscounts:
* Viscount of Audenaerde
* Viscount of Hombeke
* Viscount de Spoelberch
* Viscount Eyskens
* Viscount Savoir
* Viscount Poullet
* Viscount Frimout
* Viscount De Winne

===United Kingdom===

Viscounts are the fourth rank in the British peerage, standing directly below an earl and above a baron (Lord of Parliament in Scotland). There are approximately 270 viscountcies extant in the peerages of the British Isles, though most are secondary titles.

In British practice, the title of a viscount may be a place name, a surname, or a combination: examples include Viscount Falmouth, Viscount Hardinge and Viscount Colville of Culross. Some viscounts in the peerage of Scotland were traditionally styled &quot;The Viscount &quot;of&quot; [X]&quot;, such as the Viscount of Arbuthnott. In practice, however, very few maintain this style, instead using the more common version &quot;Viscount [X]&quot; in general parlance, for example Viscount of Falkland who is referred to as Viscount Falkland.

A British viscount is addressed in speech as &quot;Lord [X]&quot;, while his wife is &quot;Lady [X]&quot;, and he is formally styled &quot;The Right Honourable The Viscount [X]&quot;. The children of a viscount are known as &quot;The Honourable [Forename] [Surname]&quot;, with the exception of a Scottish viscount, whose eldest child may be styled as &quot;The Honourable Master of [X]&quot;.

====Ireland====
The title of viscount () was introduced to the Peerage of Ireland in 1478 with the creation of the title of Viscount Gormanston, the premier viscountcy of Britain and Ireland, held today by Nicholas Preston, 17th Viscount Gormanston. Other early Irish viscountcies were Viscount Baltinglass (1541), Viscount Clontarf (1541), Viscount Mountgarret (1550) and Viscount Decies (1569).

====Use as a courtesy title====
A specifically British custom is the use of viscount as a courtesy title for the heir of an earl or marquess. The peer&#x27;s heir apparent will sometimes be referred to as a viscount, if the second most senior title held by the head of the family is a viscountcy. For example, the eldest son of the Earl Howe is Viscount Curzon, because this is the second most senior title held by the Earl.

However, the son of a marquess or an earl can be referred to as a viscount when the title of viscount is not the second most senior if those above it share their name with the substantive title. For example, the second most senior title of the Marquess of Salisbury is the Earl of Salisbury, so his heir uses the lower title of Viscount Cranborne.

Sometimes, the son of a peer is referred to as a viscount even when he could use a more senior courtesy title which differs in name from the substantive title. Family tradition plays a role in this. For example, the eldest son of the Marquess of Londonderry is Viscount Castlereagh, even though the Marquess is also the Earl Vane.

On occasion, the title of viscount may be the courtesy title used for the grandson of a duke, provided that he is the eldest son of the duke&#x27;s eldest son. This is because the eldest son of the duke will be given the second-highest title of his father (marquess or earl), and so the third-highest is left for his eldest son. It is possible for the great-grandson of a duke to hold the courtesy title of viscount if the duke&#x27;s eldest son has the courtesy title marquess and his eldest son, in turn, uses the title of earl.

====Coronet====
A viscount&#x27;s coronet of rank bears 16 silver balls around the rim. Like all heraldic coronets, it is mostly worn at the Coronation of the British monarch, but a viscount has the right to bear his coronet of rank on his coat of arms, above the shield. In this guise, the coronet is shown face-on, featuring 9 silver balls.

===Jersey===
The island of Jersey (a British Crown Dependency) still retains an officer whose function is purely to administer orders of the island&#x27;s judiciary, and whose position remains non-hereditary. The role of the Viscount of Jersey (French: &quot;Vicomte de Jersey&quot;) involves managing fines, bail monies, seizures, confiscations, evictions, service of process, arrests for non-appearance in court and other enforcement procedures, as well acting as coroner for sudden or unexpected deaths and managing jury selection.

===France===
In France until the end of the Second French Empire, the title of &quot;vicomte&quot; was below &quot;comte&quot; and above &quot;baron&quot; in precedence.

===Portugal===
In the former kingdom of Portugal a &quot;visconde&quot; ranks above a &quot;barão&quot; (baron) and below a &quot;conde&quot; (count). The first Portuguese viscountcy, that of D. Leonel de Lima, visconde de Vila Nova de Cerveira, dates from the reign of Afonso V. A flood of viscountcies, some 86 new titles, were awarded in Portugal between 1848 and 1880.

===Spain===

The Spanish title of &quot;vizconde&quot; is ranked between the title &quot;conde&quot; (count/earl) and the relatively rare title of &quot;barón&quot;.

In Spain, nobles are classified as either Grandee of Spain (Grandes de España), as titled nobles, or as untitled nobles. A grandee of any rank outranks a non-grandee, even if that non-grandee&#x27;s title is of a higher degree, thus, a viscount-grandee enjoys higher precedence than a marquis who is not a grandee.

In the kingdom of Spain the title was awarded from the reign of Felipe IV (1621–65; Habsburg dynasty) until 1846.

==Equivalent titles==

===Western counterparts===
There are non-etymological equivalents to the title of viscount (&quot;i.e.&quot;, &#x27;vice-count&#x27;) in several languages, including German.

However, in such case titles of the etymological Burgrave family (not in countries with a viscount-form, such as Italian alongside ) bearers of the title could establish themselves at the same gap, thus at generally the same level. Consequently, a (or Baron) ranks not immediately below a , but below a .

Thus in Dutch, is the rank above Baron, below (&quot;i.e.&quot;, Count) in the kingdoms of the Netherlands and of Belgium (by Belgian law, its equivalents in the other official languages are in German and in French).

===Non-Western counterparts===
Like other major Western noble titles, viscount is sometimes used to render certain titles in non-western languages with their own traditions. Even though they are considered &#x27;equivalent&#x27; in relative rank, they are as a rule historically unrelated and thus hard to compare.

The Japanese cognate () () was the fourth of the five peerage ranks established in the Meiji period (1868–1911). The Japanese system of nobility, , which existed between 1884 and 1947, was based heavily on the British peerage. At the creation of the system, viscounts were the most numerous of all the ranks, with 324 being created compared to 11 non-imperial princes or dukes, 24 marquesses, 76 counts and 74 barons, for a total of 509 peers.

Other equivalent titles existed, such as:
* the Chinese () or () (), hereditary title of nobility first established in the Zhou dynasty
* the Korean cognate or 
* the Vietnamese cognate 
* the Manchu 

==In fiction==

Viscounts and viscountesses appear in fiction, notably in Julia Quinn&#x27;s &quot;Bridgerton&quot; series where Anthony, Viscount Bridgerton is the eldest son and head of the eponymous family. He is also the focus of the second novel of the series, the #1 &quot;The New York Times&quot; Bestseller &quot;The Viscount Who Loved Me&quot;, published in 2000&quot;.&quot; The viscount is portrayed by Jonathan Bailey in the Netflix television adaptation &quot;Bridgerton&quot; released in 2020.

Another prominent fictional viscount is Raoul, Vicomte de Chagny, one of the love interests in Gaston Leroux&#x27;s classic novel &quot;Le Fantôme de l&#x27;Opéra&quot;. He is a notable viscount in France and a patron of the Opera Populaire, the fictional opera house based on the real Palais Garnier. When Raoul marries Christine Daaé she becomes the Vicomtesse de Chagny.

<doc id="79915" wikidata="Q165503" url="?curid=79915" title="Baron">
<text>Baron is a rank of nobility or title of honour, often hereditary, in various European countries, either current or historical. The female equivalent is baroness. Typically, the title denotes an aristocrat who ranks higher than a lord or knight, but lower than a viscount or count. Often, barons hold their fief – their lands and income – directly from the monarch. Barons are less often the vassals of other nobles. In many kingdoms, they were entitled to wear a smaller form of a crown called a &quot;coronet&quot;.

The term originates from the Latin term , via Old French. The use of the title &quot;baron&quot; came to England via the Norman Conquest of 1066, then the Normans brought the title to Scotland and Southern Italy. It later spread to Scandinavian and Slavic lands.

==Etymology==
The word &quot;baron&quot; comes from the Old French , from a Late Latin &quot;man; servant, soldier, mercenary&quot; (so used in Salic law; Alemannic law has in the same sense). The scholar Isidore of Seville in the 7th century thought the word was from Greek &quot;heavy&quot; (because of the &quot;heavy work&quot; done by mercenaries), but the word is presumably of Old Frankish origin, cognate with Old English meaning &quot;warrior, nobleman&quot;. Cornutus in the first century already reports a word which he took to be of Gaulish origin. He glosses it as meaning and explains it as meaning &quot;stupid&quot;, by reference to classical Latin &quot;simpleton, dunce&quot;; because of this early reference, the word has also been suggested to derive from an otherwise unknown Celtic , but the &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot; takes this to be &quot;a figment&quot;.

== Britain and Ireland ==
In the Peerage of England, the Peerage of Great Britain, the Peerage of Ireland and the Peerage of the United Kingdom (but not in the Peerage of Scotland), barons form the lowest rank, placed immediately below viscounts. A woman of baronial rank has the title baroness. In the Kingdom of England, the medieval Latin word &quot;&quot; (genitive singular &quot;barōnis&quot;) was used originally to denote a tenant-in-chief of the early Norman kings who held his lands by the feudal tenure of &quot;barony&quot; (in Latin &quot;per barōniam&quot;), and who was entitled to attend the Great Council (Magnum Concilium) which by the 13th century had developed into the Parliament of England.
Feudal baronies (or &quot;baronies by tenure&quot;) are now obsolete in England and without any legal force, but any such historical titles are held &quot;in gross&quot;, that is to say are deemed to be enveloped within a more modern extant peerage title also held by the holder, sometimes along with vestigial manorial rights and tenures by grand serjeanty.

After the Norman Conquest in 1066, the Norman dynasty introduced an adaptation of the French feudal system to the Kingdom of England. Initially, the term &quot;baron&quot; on its own was not a title or rank, but the &quot;barons of the King&quot; were the men of the king. Previously, in the Anglo-Saxon kingdom of England, the king&#x27;s companions held the title of earl and in Scotland, the title of thane. All who held their feudal barony &quot;in-chief of the king&quot;, that is with the king as his immediate overlord, became alike &quot;barones regis&quot; (&quot;barons of the king&quot;), bound to perform a stipulated annual military service and obliged to attend his council. The greatest of the nobles, especially those in the Marches, such as the Earls of Chester and the Bishops of Durham, whose territories were often deemed palatine, that is to say &quot;worthy of a prince&quot;, might refer to their own tenants as &quot;barons&quot;, where lesser magnates spoke simply of their &quot;men&quot; (&quot;homines&quot;) and lords of the manor might reference &quot;bondmen&quot;.

Initially those who held land directly from the king by military service, from earls downwards, all bore alike the title of baron, which was thus the factor uniting all members of the ancient baronage as peers one of another. Under King Henry II, the already distinguished between greater barons, who held &quot;per baroniam&quot; by knight&#x27;s service, and lesser barons, who held manors. Thus in this historical sense, lords of manors are barons, or freemen; however they are not entitled to be styled as such. John Selden writes in &quot;Titles of Honour&quot;, &quot;The word &quot;Baro&quot; (Latin for &#x27;baron&#x27;) hath been also so much communicated, that not only all Lords of Mannors have been from ancient time, and are at this day called sometimes Barons (as in the stile of their Court Barons, which is &quot;Curia Baronis, &amp;c&quot;. And I have read &quot;hors de son Barony&quot; in a barr to an Avowry for &quot;hors de son fee&quot;) But also the Judges of the Exchequer have it from antient time fixed on them.&quot; Within a century of the Norman Conquest of 1066, as in the case of Thomas Becket in 1164, there arose the practice of sending to each greater baron a personal summons demanding his attendance at the King&#x27;s Council, which evolved into the Parliament and later into the House of Lords, while as was stipulated in Magna Carta of 1215, the lesser barons of each county would receive a single summons as a group through the sheriff, and representatives only from their number would be elected to attend on behalf of the group. These representatives developed into the knights of the shire, elected by the county court presided over by the sheriff, who themselves formed the precursor of the House of Commons. Thus appeared a definite distinction, which eventually had the effect of restricting to the greater barons alone the privileges and duties of peerage.

Later, the king started to create new baronies in one of two ways: by a writ of summons directing a chosen man to attend Parliament, and in an even later development by letters patent. Writs of summons became the normal method in medieval times, displacing the method of feudal barony, but creation of baronies by letters patent is the sole method adopted in modern times.

Since the adoption of summons by writ, baronies thus no longer relate directly to land-holding, and thus no more feudal baronies needed to be created from then on. Following the &quot;Modus Tenendi Parliamenta&quot; of 1419, the Tenures Abolition Act 1660, the Feudal Tenure Act 1662, and the Fines and Recoveries Act 1834, titles of feudal barony became obsolete and without legal force. The Tenures Abolition Act 1660 specifically states: baronies by tenure were converted into baronies by writ. The rest ceased to exist as feudal baronies by tenure, becoming baronies in free socage, that is to say under a &quot;free&quot; (hereditable) contract requiring payment of monetary rents.

In the 20th century, Britain introduced the concept of non-hereditary life peers. All appointees to this distinction have (thus far) been at the rank of baron. In accordance with the tradition applied to hereditary peers, they too are formally addressed in parliament by their peers as &quot;The Noble Lord&quot;.

In addition, baronies are often used by their holders as subsidiary titles, for example as courtesy titles for the son and heir of an Earl or higher-ranked peer. The Scottish baronial title tends to be used when a landed family is not in possession of any United Kingdom peerage title of higher rank, subsequently granted, or has been created a knight of the realm.

Several members of the royal family with the style of &quot;Royal Highness&quot; are also titled Barons. For example, William, Prince of Wales is also The Baron of Renfrew and The Baron Carrickfergus.
Some non-royal Barons are related to the royal family; for example, Maurice Roche, 6th Baron Fermoy is William&#x27;s first cousin once removed, through William&#x27;s late mother, Diana, Princess of Wales, who was the 4th Baron Fermoy&#x27;s granddaughter.

=== Irish barons ===

The title of baron () was created in the Peerage of Ireland shortly after the Norman invasion of Ireland (1169). Ireland&#x27;s first baronies included Baron Athenry (1172), Baron Offaly (c. 1193), Baron Kerry (1223), Baron Dunboyne (1324), Baron Gormanston (1365–70), Baron Slane (1370), Baron of Dunsany (1439), Baron Louth (c. 1458) and Baron Trimlestown (1461).

=== Coronet ===

A person holding a peerage in the rank of baron is entitled to a coronet bearing six pearls around the rim, equally spaced and all of equal size and height. The rim itself is neither jeweled nor &quot;chased&quot; (which is the case for the coronets of peers of higher degree).

The actual coronet is worn only for the coronation of a new monarch, but a baron can bear his coronet of rank on his coat of arms above the shield. In heraldry, the baron&#x27;s coronet is shown with four of the balls visible.

=== Style of address ===

Formally, barons are styled &quot;The Right Honourable The Lord [Barony]&quot; and barons’ wives are styled &quot;The Right Honourable The Lady [Barony]&quot;. Baronesses in their own right, whether hereditary or for life, are either styled &quot;The Right Honourable The Baroness [Barony]&quot; or &quot;The Right Honourable The Lady [Barony]&quot;, mainly based on personal preference (e.g. Lady Thatcher and Baroness Warsi, both life baronesses in their own right). Less formally, one refers to or addresses a baron as &quot;Lord [Barony]&quot; and his wife as &quot;Lady [Barony]&quot;, and baronesses in their own right as &quot;Baroness [X]&quot; or &quot;Lady [X]&quot;. In direct address, barons and baronesses can also be referred to as &quot;My Lord&quot;, &quot;Your Lordship&quot;, or &quot;Your Ladyship or My Lady&quot;. The husband of a baroness in her own right gains no title or style from his wife.

&quot;The&quot; &quot;Right Honourable&quot; is frequently abbreviated to &quot;The Rt Hon.&quot; or &quot;Rt Hon.&quot; When referred to by the Sovereign in public instruments, &quot;The Right Honourable&quot; is changed to &quot;Our right trusty and well-beloved&quot;, with &quot;Counsellor&quot; attached if they are a Privy Counsellor.

Children of barons and baronesses in their own right, whether hereditary or for life, have the style &quot;The Honourable [Forename] [Surname]&quot;. After the death of the father or mother, the child may continue to use this style.

Courtesy barons are styled &quot;Lord [Barony]&quot;, and their wives &quot;Lady [Barony]&quot;; the article &quot;The&quot; is always absent. If the courtesy baron is not a Privy Counsellor, the style &quot;The Right Honourable&quot; will also be absent.

It is very common for the surnames of barons and baronesses to be identical to or included in the formal title of their barony. However, when addressed as a peer, the title of &quot;Lord&quot;, &quot;Lady&quot;, or &quot;Baroness&quot; is followed by the name of his or her barony, not his personal name. This is relevant when a baron or baroness&#x27;s title is completely different from his or her personal surname (e.g. William Thomson, Lord Kelvin) or includes a territorial designation in addition to his surname (e.g. Martin Rees, Lord Rees of Ludlow). This also means that including a baron or baroness&#x27;s forename before his or her title is incorrect and potentially misleading. For example, &quot;Lady Margaret Thatcher&quot; (as opposed to &quot;Lady Thatcher&quot;) would imply that she was the daughter of an earl, marquess, or duke, or Lady of the Garter or Thistle not holding a peerage rather than a baroness. Likewise, in the case of men, &quot;Lord Digby Jones&quot; (as opposed to &quot;Lord Jones of Birmingham&quot;) would imply that he was the younger son of a marquess or duke rather than a baron.

The United Kingdom has a policy of including titles of nobility on passports: the title is entered into the surname field and a standard observation is recorded giving the holder&#x27;s full name and title. A Baron would therefore record his surname as &quot;Lord [Barony]&quot;, and the observation would note that &quot;The holder is The Right Honourable [given names] [surname] Lord [Barony]&quot;. However, if the title of an applicant&#x27;s peerage is different from his surname, he can choose whether to use his surname or title in the surname field. A baroness in her own right would substitute &quot;Baroness&quot; for &quot;Lord&quot;, and the wife of a Baron would similarly substitute &quot;Lady&quot;. Titles of nobility are checked against Debrett&#x27;s Peerage, Who&#x27;s Who, or the London Gazette by the passport office on application.

=== Scottish barons ===

In Scotland, the rank of baron is a rank of the ancient nobility of the Baronage of Scotland and refers to the holder of a barony, formerly a feudal superiority or prescriptive barony attached to land erected into a free barony by Crown Charter.The Court of the Lord Lyon will officially recognise those possessing the dignity of baron (and other titles that are but nobler titles of baron within the Baronage of Scotland lord/earl/marquis/duke see lordships in the Baronage of Scotland) on petition who meet certain criteria, and will grant them baronial arms with a helmet befitting their degree. Scottish barons rank below Lords of Parliament and while noble have the status of minor baron, being a non-Peerage rank; as such it can be transferred by either inheritance or assignation.

In showing that Scottish barons are titles of nobility, reference may be made, amongst others, to the Lyon Court in the Petition of Maclean of Ardgour for a Birthbrieve by Interlocutor dated 26 February 1943 which &quot;&quot;Finds and Declares that the Minor Barons of Scotland are, and have both in this Nobiliary Court, and in the Court of Session, been recognised as &#x27;titled&#x27; nobility, and that the estait of the Baronage (The Barones Minores) is of the ancient Feudal Nobility of Scotland&quot;.&quot;

Sir Thomas Innes of Learney, in his &quot;Scots Heraldry&quot; (2nd Ed., p. 88, note 1), states that &quot;The Act 1672, cap 47, specially qualifies the degrees thus: Nobles (i.e. peers, the term being here used in a restricted seventeenth-century English sense), Barons (i.e. Lairds of baronial fiefs and their &#x27;heirs&#x27;, who, even if fiefless, are equivalent to heads of Continental baronial houses) and Gentlemen (apparently all other armigers).&quot; Baronets and knights are evidently classed as &#x27;Gentlemen&#x27; here and are of a lower degree than Barons.

The Scottish equivalent of an English baron is a Lord of Parliament.

==== Chapeau and helm ====

Scottish barons were entitled to a red cap of maintenance (chapeau) turned up ermine if petitioning for a grant or matriculation of a coat of arms between the 1930s and 2004. This chapeau is identical to the red cap worn by an English baron, but without the silver balls or gilt. This is sometimes depicted in armorial paintings between the shield and the helmet. Additionally, if the baron is the head of a family, he may include a chiefly coronet which is similar to a ducal coronet, but with four strawberry leaves. Because the chapeau was a relatively recent innovation, a number of ancient arms of Scottish feudal barons do not display the chapeau. Now, Scottish barons are principally recognised by the baron&#x27;s helm, which in Scotland is a steel helmet with grille of three grilles, garnished in gold. Occasionally, the great tilting-helm garnished with gold is shown, or a helmet befitting a higher rank, if held.

==== Style of address ====

Scottish barons style their surnames similarly to Clan Chiefs if they own the caput, with the name of their barony following their name, as in &quot;John Smith of Edinburgh, Baron of Edinburgh&quot; otherwise &quot;John Smith, Baron of Edinburgh&quot;. Most formally, and in writing, they are styled as &quot;The Much Honoured Baron of Edinburgh&quot;. Their wives are styled &quot;Lady Edinburgh&quot;, or &quot;The Baroness of Edinburgh&quot;. The phrase &quot;Lady of Edinburgh&quot; is wrong if the lady in question does not hold a Scottish barony in her own right. Orally, Scottish barons may be addressed with the name of their barony, as in &quot;Edinburgh&quot; or else as &quot;Baron&quot; without anything else following, which if present would suggest a peerage barony. Informally, when referring to a Scots baron in the third person, the name &quot;Baron of [X]&quot; is used or simply &quot;[X]&quot;.

Scottish Barons may record &quot;[surname] of [territorial designation]&quot; in the surname field of their passport, and an official observation would then note that &quot;The holder is [given names] [surname] Baron of [territorial designation]&quot;; applicants must provide evidence that the Lord Lyon has recognised their feudal barony, or else be included in Burke&#x27;s Peerage.

==Continental Europe==

===France===
During the , French baronies were very much like Scottish ones. Feudal landholders who possessed a barony were entitled to style themselves as a baron () if they were nobles; a (commoner) could only be a (lord of the barony). French baronies could be sold freely until 1789, when the Constituent Assembly abolished feudal law. The title of baron was assumed as a by many nobles, whether members of the Nobles of the Robe or cadets of Nobles of the Sword who held no title in their own right.

Emperor () created a new imperial nobility in which &quot;baron&quot; appeared from 1808 as the second-lowest title. The titles were inherited through a male-only line of descent and could not be purchased.

In 1815, King Louis XVIII created a new peerage system and a Chamber of Peers, based on the British model. Baron-peer was the lowest title, but the heirs to pre-1789 barons could remain barons, as could the elder sons of viscount-peers and the younger sons of count-peers. This peerage system was abolished in 1848.

===Germany===

In pre-republican Germany all the knightly families of the Holy Roman Empire (sometimes distinguished by the prefix or ) eventually were recognised as of baronial rank, although is the literal translation for &quot;knight&quot;, and persons who held that title enjoyed a distinct, but lower, rank in Germany&#x27;s nobility than barons (). The wife of a (Baron) is called a or sometimes , his daughter or sometimes .

Families which had always held this status were called (&#x27;primordial/ancient/original nobility&#x27;), and were heraldically entitled to a three-pointed coronet. Families which had been ennobled at a definite point in time ( or &quot;nobility by patent&quot;) had seven points on their coronet. These families held their fief in vassalage from a suzerain. The holder of an allodial (i.e. suzerain-free) barony was thus called a Free Lord, or . Subsequently, sovereigns in Germany conferred the title of as a rank in the nobility, without implication of allodial or feudal status.

Since 1919, hereditary titles have had no legal status in Germany. In modern, republican Germany, and remain heritable only as part of the legal surname (and may thereby be transmitted to husbands, wives and children, without implication of nobility).

In Austria, hereditary titles have been completely banned. Thus, a member of the formerly reigning House of Habsburg or members of the former nobility would in most cases simply be addressed as in an official/public context, for instance in the media. Still, in both countries, honorary styles like &quot;His/Her (Imperial/Royal) Highness&quot;, &quot;Serenity&quot;, etc. persist in social use as a form of courtesy.

In Luxembourg and Liechtenstein (where German is the official language), barons remain members of the recognized nobility, and the sovereigns retain authority to confer the title (morganatic cadets of the princely dynasty received the title &quot;Baron of Lanskron&quot;, using &quot;both&quot; and for different members of this branch.)

Generally, all legitimate males of a German baronial family inherit the title or from birth, as all legitimate daughters inherit the title of or . As a result, German barons have been more numerous than those of such countries where primogeniture with respect to title inheritance prevails (or prevailed), such as France and the United Kingdom.

===Italy===
In Italy, was the lowest rank of feudal nobility except for that of or (lord of the manor). The title of baron was most generally introduced into southern Italy (including Sicily) by the Normans during the 11th century. Whereas originally a barony might consist of two or more manors, by 1700 we see what were formerly single manors erected into baronies, counties or even marquisates. Since the early 1800s, when feudalism was abolished in the various Italian states, it has often been granted as a simple hereditary title without any territorial designation or . The untitled younger son of a baron is a and in informal usage might be called a baron, while certain baronies devolve to heirs male general. Since 1948 titles of nobility have not been recognised by the Italian state. In the absence of a nobiliary or heraldic authority in Italy there are, in fact, numerous persons who claim to be barons or counts without any basis for such claims. Baron and noble () are hereditary titles and, as such, could only be created or recognised by the kings of Italy or (before 1860) the pre-unitary Italian states such as the Two Sicilies, Tuscany, Parma or Modena, or by the Holy See (Vatican) or the Republic of San Marino. Beginning around 1800, a number of (lords of the manor) began to style themselves but in many cases this was not sanctioned legally by decree, while there was even less justification in the holder of any large (non-feudal) landed estate calling himself a baron. Nevertheless, both were common practices. In most of peninsular Italy the widespread medieval introduction of the title was Longobardic, while in Sicily and Sardinia it was coeval with Norman rule some centuries later, and one referred to the &quot;baronage&quot; when speaking of landed nobles generally. The heraldic coronet of an Italian baron is a jewelled rim of gold surmounted by seven visible pearls, set upon the rim directly or upon stems; alternately, the French style coronet (entwined in a string of small pearls, with or without four bigger visible pearls set upon the rim) is used.

===Low Countries===
In the medieval era, some allodial and enfeoffed lands held by nobles were created or recognized as baronies by the Holy Roman Emperors, within whose realm most of the Low Countries lay. Subsequently, the Habsburgs continued to confer the baronial title in the Southern Netherlands, first as kings of Spain and then, again, as emperors until abolition of the Holy Roman Empire, but these had become titular elevations rather than grants of new territory.

In the Netherlands after 1815, titles of baron authorized by previous monarchs (except those of the Napoleonic Kingdom of Holland) were usually recognized by the Dutch kings. But such recognition was not automatic, having to be authenticated by the Supreme Council of Nobility and then approved by the sovereign. This ceased to be possible after the Dutch constitution was revised in 1983. More than one hundred Dutch baronial families have been recognized. The title is usually inherited by all males descended patrilineally from the original recipient of the title, although in a few noble families is the title of cadet family members, while in a few others it is heritable according to primogeniture.

After its secession in 1830, Belgium incorporated into its nobility all titles of baron borne by Belgian citizens which had been recognized by the Netherlands since 1815. In addition, its monarchs have since created or recognized other titles of baron, and the sovereign continues to exercise the prerogative to confer baronial and other titles of nobility. &quot;Baron&quot; is the third lowest title within the nobility system above knight (, ) and below &quot;viscount&quot;. There are still a number of families in Belgium that bear the title of baron.

Luxembourg&#x27;s monarch retains the right to confer the baronial title. Two of the grand duchy&#x27;s prime ministers inherited baronial titles that were used during their tenures in office, Victor de Tornaco and Félix de Blochausen.

===Nordic countries===
In Norway, king Magnus VI of Norway (1238–1280) replaced the title Lendmann with Baron, but in 1308 Haakon V abolished the title.

The present corresponding title is in the Danish nobility and the Norwegian nobility, in the Swedish nobility ( is used orally, while it is written as ), and in the nobility of Finland.

In the beginning, Finnish nobles were all without honorific titulature, and known simply as lords. Since the Middle Ages, each head of a noble family had been entitled to a vote in any of Finland&#x27;s provincial diets whenever held, as in the realm&#x27;s House of Nobility of the Riksdag of the Estates. In 1561, Sweden&#x27;s King Eric XIV granted the hereditary titles of count and to some of these, but not all. Although their cadet family members were not entitled to vote or sit in the , they were legally entitled to the same title as the head of the family, but in customary address they became or . Theoretically, in the 16th and 17th centuries, families elevated to status were granted a barony in fief, enjoying some rights of taxation and judicial authority. Subsequently, the &quot;barony&quot; was titular, usually attached to a family property, which was sometimes entailed. Their exemptions from taxes on landed properties continued into the 20th century, although in the 19th century tax reforms narrowed this privilege. Nobility creations continued until 1917, the end of Finland&#x27;s grand ducal monarchy.

===Russia===
Muscovite Russia had no traditional baronial titles of its own; they were introduced in early Imperial Russia by Peter the Great. In the hierarchy of nobility introduced by Peter the Great, barons () ranked above untitled nobility and below counts (, ). The styles &quot;Your Well-born&quot; (, ) and &quot;Master Baron&quot; (, ) were used to address a Russian baron.

There were two main groups of nobility which held the baronial title. One was the Baltic German nobility, for which Russia merely recognized their pre-existing titles; the other was new barons created by the Emperors of Russia after 1721. Like in many other countries, new baronial titles were often created by ennoblement of rich bourgeoisie. The title of baron, along with the rest of the noble hierarchy, was abolished in December 1917 after the Bolshevik Revolution; however, certain leaders of the White movement like Baron Pyotr Wrangel and Roman von Ungern-Sternberg continued to use the title until the end of the Russian Civil War.

===Spain===

In Spain, the title follows in the noble hierarchy, and ranks above . is the feminine form, for the wife of a baron or for a woman who has been granted the title in her own right. In general, titles of created before the 19th century originate from the Crown of Aragon. lost territorial jurisdiction around the middle of the 19th century, and from then on the title became purely honorific. Although most have not held the rank of as well, the title has been conferred in conjunction with the . The sovereign continues to grant baronial titles.

==Other==
Like other major Western noble titles, &quot;baron&quot; is sometimes used to render certain titles in non-Western languages with their own traditions, even though they are necessarily historically unrelated and thus hard to compare, which are considered &#x27;equivalent&#x27; in relative rank. This is the case with China&#x27;s &quot;nanjue&quot; (&quot;nan-chueh&quot;) (), hereditary title of nobility of the fifth rank, as well as its derivatives and adaptations.

In some &quot;republics&quot; of continental Europe, the unofficial title of &quot;Baron&quot; retains a purely social prestige, with no particular political privileges.

In Armenian, the word &quot;Baron&quot; should not be confused with the similar word &quot;Paron&quot; (Armenian: Պարոն), which is a title given to ordinary men, equivalent to &#x27;Sir&#x27; or &#x27;Mr&#x27;.

In the Polynesian island monarchy of Tonga, as opposed to the situation in Europe, barons are granted this imported title (in English), alongside traditional chiefly styles, and continue to hold and exercise some political power.

==In fiction==
Barons and baronesses have appeared in various works of fiction. For examples of fictional barons and baronesses, see List of fictional nobility#Barons and baronesses.

<text>A gallus (pl. galli / gallae) was a eunuch priest/priestess of the Phrygian goddess Cybele (Magna Mater in Rome) and her consort Attis, whose worship was incorporated into the state religious practices of ancient Rome.

==Origins==
Cybele&#x27;s cult may have originated in Mesopotamia, arriving in Greece around 300 BCE. It originally kept its sacred symbol, a black meteorite, in a temple called the Megalesion in Pessinus in modern Turkey.

The earliest surviving references to the galli come from the &quot;Greek Anthology&quot;, a 10th-century compilation of earlier material, where several epigrams mention or clearly allude to their castrated state. 

Stephanus Byzantinus (6th century CE) said the name came from King Gallus, while Ovid (43 BC – 17 CE) said it derived from the Gallus river in Phrygia. The same word (&quot;gallus&quot; singular, &quot;galli&quot; plural) was used by the Romans to refer to Celts and to roosters, and the latter especially was a source of puns. Considering the Mesopotamian connection, and the similarities between Cybele and Inanna, a common etymology between the Galli and the much earlier Sumerian priests of Inanna, known as the Gala, is plausible, but this is not as yet conclusive. 

== Arrival in Rome ==
The cult of Magna Mater arrived in Rome sometime in the 3rd century BCE, towards the end of the Second Punic War against Carthage. There are no contemporary accounts of its arrival, but later literary sources describe its import as an official response to meteor showers, crop failures and famine in 205 BCE. The Senate and the Syblline books identified these events as prodigies, signs of divine anger against Rome and warnings of Rome&#x27;s imminent destruction, which should be expiated by Rome&#x27;s official import of the Magna Mater and her cult; with the goddess as an ally, Rome might see an end to the famine and victory over Carthage. In 204 BCE, the Roman Senate officially adopted Cybele as a state goddess. Her cult image was brought from her sanctuary in Asia Minor, and eventually into the city, with much ceremony. According to Livy, it was brought to the Temple of Victory on the Palatine Hill on the day before the Ides of April, and, from then on, the anniversary was celebrated as the Megalesia on April 4–10 with public games, animal sacrifices, and music performed by the galli. Over a hundred years later (according to Plutarch), when the Roman general Marius planned to fight the Germanic tribes, a priest of the galli named Bataces prophesied Roman victory and consequently the Senate voted to build a victory temple to the goddess.

=== Reception ===
Dionysius of Halicarnassus claimed that Roman citizens did not participate in the rituals of the cult of Magna Mater. Literary sources call the galli &quot;half-men,&quot; leading scholars to conclude that Roman men looked down upon the galli. But Roman disapproval of the foreign cult may be more the invention of modern scholars than a social reality in Rome, as archaeologists have found votive statues of Attis on the Palatine hill, meaning Roman citizens participated on some level in the reverence of Magna Mater and her consort.

The archigallus was a Roman citizen who was also employed by the Roman State and therefore walked a narrow line: preserving cult traditions while not violating Roman religious prohibitions. Some argue that the archigallus was never a eunuch, as all citizens of Rome were forbidden from &quot;eviratio&quot; (castration). (This prohibition suggests that the original galli were either Asian or slaves.) Claudius, however, lifted the ban on castration; Domitian subsequently reaffirmed it. Whether or not Roman citizens could participate in the cult of Magna Mater, or whether its members were exclusively foreign-born, is therefore the subject of scholarly debate.

=== In the provinces ===
The remains of a Roman gallus from the 4th century CE were found in 2002 in what is now Catterick, England, dressed in women&#x27;s clothes, in jewelry of jet, shale, and bronze, with two stones in his mouth. Pete Wilson, the senior archaeologist at English Heritage, said, &quot;The find demonstrates how cosmopolitan the north of England was.&quot; The archaeological site at Corbridge, a significant Romano-British settlement on Hadrian&#x27;s Wall, has an altar to the goddess Cybele. 

A fourth-century cemetery was excavated at Hungate in York, where one of the burials has been identified as potentially that of a member of the Galli. This is based on the evidence that although the bones were identified as male, the person was buried with jet bracelets, a material that is strongly associated with women. These aspects are also similar to that of the Gallus burial from Catterick.

== Religious practices ==

The galli castrated themselves during an ecstatic celebration called the Dies sanguinis, or &quot;Day of Blood&quot;, which took place on March 24. On this day of mourning for Attis, they ran around wildly and disheveled. They performed dances to the music of pipes and tambourines, and, in an ecstasy, flogged themselves until they bled. This was followed by a day of feasting and rest.

A sacred feast was part of the initiation ritual. Firmicus Maternus, a Christian who objected to other religions, revealed a possible password of the galli: &quot;I have eaten from the timbrel; I have drunk from the cymbal; I am become an initiate of Attis.&quot; That password is cited in the book &quot;De errore profanarum religionum&quot;. However, the password is written in Greek with a translation into Latin, which does not contain any reference to Attis. Some editions of the text also omit &quot;Attis&quot; in the Greek password. The Eleusinian Mysteries, reported by Clement of Alexandria, include a similar formula: &quot;I fasted; I drank the &quot;kykeon&quot; [water with meal]; I took from the sacred chest; I wrought therewith and put it in the basket, and from the basket into the chest.&quot; Clement also reported (as paraphrased by a 20th-century historian) &quot;carrying a vessel called a &quot;kernos&quot;&quot; and entering &quot;the &quot;pastos&quot; or marriage-chamber&quot;.

The signs of their office have been described as a type of crown, possibly a laurel wreath, as well as a golden bracelet known as the occabus. They generally wore women&#x27;s clothing (often yellow), and a turban, pendants, and earrings. They bleached their hair and wore it long, and they wore heavy makeup. They wandered around with followers, begging for charity, in return for which they were prepared to tell fortunes.

In Rome, the head of the galli was known as the &quot;archigallus&quot;, at least from the period of Claudius on. A number of archaeological finds depict the archigallus wearing luxurious and extravagant costumes. The archigallus was always a Roman citizen chosen by the quindecimviri sacris faciundis, whose term of service lasted for life. Along with the institution of the archigallus came the Phrygianum sanctuary as well as the rite of the taurobolium as it pertains to the Magna Mater, two aspects of the Magna Mater&#x27;s cultus that the archigallus held dominion over.

== Interpretations ==
Shelley Hales wrote: &quot;Greek and Roman literature consistently reinforces the sexual and racial difference of eunuchs by stressing how different they look. They were presented as wearing bright clothes, heavy jewellery, make-up and sporting bleached and crimped hair.&quot; Because the galli castrated themselves and wore women&#x27;s clothing, accessories and makeup, some modern scholars have interpreted them as transgender. Firmicus Maternus said &quot;they say they are not men... they want to pass as women.&quot; He elaborated, &quot;Animated by some sort of reverential feeling, they actually have made this element [air] into a woman Caelestis, the goddess]. For, because air is an intermediary between sea and sky, they honor it through priests who have womanish voices.&quot;

The galli may also have occupied a &quot;third gender&quot; in Roman society. Jacob Latham has connected the foreign nature of Magna Mater and her priests&#x27; nonconforming gender presentation. They may have existed outside Roman constructions of masculinity and femininity altogether, which can explain the adverse reactions of Roman male citizens against the galli&#x27;s transgression of gender norms.

Some scholars have linked the episode of the self-castration of Attis to the ritual castration of the galli. At Pessinus, the centre of the Cybele cult, there were two high priests during the Hellenistic period, one with the title of &quot;Attis&quot; and the other with the name of &quot;Battakes&quot;. Both were eunuchs. The high priests had considerable political influence during this period, and letters exist from a high priest of Attis to the kings of Pergamon, Eumenes II and Attalus II, inscribed on stone. Later, during the Flavian period, there was a college of ten priests, not castrated, and now Roman citizens, but still using the title &quot;Attis&quot;.

<doc id="79922" wikidata="Q2261709" url="?curid=79922" title="Corycian Cave">
<text>The Corycian Cave (; ) is located in central Greece on the southern slopes of Mount Parnassus, in Parnassus National Park, which is situated north of Delphi. The Corycian Cave has been a sacred space since the Neolithic era, and its name comes from the mythological nature spirits the Corycian nymphs, which were depicted as looking like beautiful maidens and were said to inhabit the cave. More specifically it is named after the nymph Corycia; however, its name etymologically derives from &quot;korykos&quot;, &quot;knapsack&quot;. A modern name for the cave in some references is &quot;Sarantavli&quot;, meaning &quot;forty rooms&quot; because the cave has many caverns that go deep into Mt. Parnassus. The Corycian Cave was used primarily as a place of worship for Pan, the god of the wild, as well as the Corycian nymphs, Zeus, and is also thought to be the ritual home of Dionysus. Also in mythology, Zeus was imprisoned in the Corycian Cave by the monster Typhon.

Today, the Corycian Cave is a notable tourist attraction for those who travel to Delphi. Tourists often hike past the Corycian Cave as they travel on ancient trails up Mt. Parnassus to have a much broader view of the landscape of the Livadi Valley below.

In modern times, the cave has been a place of refuge for the surrounding population during foreign invasions e.g. from the Persians (Herodotus, 8.36) in the 5th century BC, the Turks during the Greek War of Independence, and from the Germans in 1943.

== Location and geography ==
=== Exterior geography ===
According to author Jeremy McInerney, &quot;Delphi and Mt.Parnassus became, through myth and ritual, landscape in which tensions between wilderness and civilizations... could be narrated, enacted, and organized&quot;. This could be seen in the ritual and in topography where Mt.Parnassus is split into the zones of harsh wilderness at its peaks in contrast to the plateau below that was used for cultivation, and in the center of this, as McInerney says, &quot;... the deeper movement from chaos to order...&quot; was the Corycian Cave. Due to its topographical location, to ancient Greeks the Corycian Cave was the divider between wilderness and culture. It represents a place outside of the sanctuary of Delphi below but not at the dangerous mountain peaks, a place where for mythological purposes, &quot;... where nymphs are possessed and tamed by the gods...&quot;

The Corycian Cave sits at an altitude of 1,250m above sea level. The ascent to the Corycian Cave from the plateau below was a steep and rocky one, climbing an elevation of 1,000m in under a half kilometer.

=== Interior geography ===
Corycian Cave is the largest cave in the Delphi region. Some ancient texts describe Corycian Cave as being located in, &quot;…a large oval depression with high rocky walls, where the best saffron grew; it was filled with an agreeable, shady woodland…and at the bottom there opened an underground cavern.&quot; It is thought that the cave was formed after the collapse of an older cave system, possibly due to an earthquake. The composition of Corycian Cave itself mostly consists of limestone and schist plaques—as is common of the many caves throughout the Delphi region. The structure of Corycian Cave is made up of two central caverns and then gets narrower as it extends deeper. The length and width of the first chamber is roughly 90x60 meters and the height is roughly 50 meters. The chamber is also filled with stalactites and stalagmites formed out of limestone. One prominent stalagmite in particular known as Table has a relatively large, flat top that was used a depository for votives by worshipers.

== Cave exploration and archaeology ==

=== Artifacts found ===

The Corycian Cave was excavated in 1969 by French hellenist Pierre Amandry and his team from the French School of Athens. During the excavation they found many artifacts and vessels left by ancient worshippers. The majority of objects found were made out of livestock bone. This included 22,000 astragals, which were primarily from sheep and goats, that were made out of talus, a large bone that protrudes from the ankle. The astragals were believed to be primarily used in games of chance, similar to the modern day dice. Of the 22,000 found, 2,500 were found to have been purposefully smoothed down and pierced so that a leather thread could go through them to form a necklace (36 were set in lead and 2 in gold). Also in the Corycian Cave, archeologists found a variety of rings, bronze figurines, ceramics, metal objects, as well as several wind instruments such as the auloi.

Although there were some instances in the cave where gold was found, the most common vessels found were that of bone of deer, sheep, and goat. Artifacts found at the Corycian Cave point to the majority of worshippers being shepherds, goatherds, and hunters due to the lack of more expensive gifts left at the cave.

== As a sanctuary space ==

=== History of use ===
The earliest evidence of human inhabitance in Corycian Cave dates back to the Neolithic period—around 4000 years BCE. Corycian Cave was used off and on over the course of history rather than continuously. Some of the earliest evidence of worship at Corycian Cave is from hunters and shepherds during the later Neolithic period. During the Greek-Persian Wars (499–448 BCE), the inhabitants of ancient Delphi used Corycian Cave as a place to hide from Persian invaders.
=== Worshiper demographics ===
Archeological evidence from Corycian Cave suggests that the majority of worshipers were humble, ordinary people rather than wealthy or powerful people. Many of the worshipers at Corycian Cave are thought to have been shepherds or hunters who lived and worked around Mount Parnassus. There is also evidence of women and children worshipping at Corycian Cave. Corycian Cave was also popular among worshipers belonging to the cult of Pan due to the cave&#x27;s mythological associations with the god. Most votives left inside Corycian Cave by worshipers were made of clay or bone. The major city of ancient Delphi was in relatively close proximity to Corycian Cave. As a result, those who traveled from other places to see the monuments of Delphi would occasionally stop by Corycian Cave and leave small votives.

=== Worshiper experience ===
The ancient geographer Pomponius Mela referenced his experience at Corycian Cave in his writing. An article by George C. Boon referencing Mela&#x27;s work reads,&quot; &#x27;It terrifies those entering by the sound of cymbals clashing by divine agency and with a great din…Within is a space greater than anyone has ventured to cross, so dreadful it is, and on that account is unknown.&#x27; &quot; Mela&#x27;s work, as referenced by Boon, suggests that worshipers visiting Corycian Cave may feel fear due to the loud noises, darkness, and vastness of the space. Worshipers also would have seen water dripping from the ceiling and oozing out of the ground, which gave Corycian Cave a sparkling appearance in areas where light was present. Ancient worshipers also believed that an inner cavern of Corycian Cave was the home of the mythological monster Typhon. A shrine to Poseidon was located near the entrance to Typhon&#x27;s lair, and worshipers felt that this would prevent the monster from escaping and wreaking havoc. Aside from feelings of fear, Mela also described Corycian Cave as feeling very impressive and awe inspiring. There were also reports of smoke being seen coming out of Corycian Cave, which led worshipers to believe that the cave indeed housed some deities.

==In ancient Greek sources==
In ancient times, Corycian Cave was used as a sanctuary since at least 4000 B.C.E. The Corycian Cave also showed up in several other ancient Greek sources:
Strabo, in his &quot;Geography&quot;, writes:
Pausanias in his &quot;Guide to Greece&quot; writes:
In Pseudo-Apollodorus’ &quot;Bibliotheca&quot;, the cave is mentioned when Zeus fights the monster Typhon. In this account, After Typhon steals Zeus’ sinews, he places Zeus in the Corycian cave: 
== In mythology ==

=== Corycian nymphs ===

The Corycian nymphs are a mythological group of three sisters who live on Mount Parnassus, and they are the daughters of Pleistus—a river god. The Corycian nymphs are Corycia, Melaina, and Kleodora. Corycia is known for being the namesake of Corycian Cave, and she is also said to have a child, named Lycorus, with the god Apollo. Melaina is also believed by some to have bore one of Apollo&#x27;s children named Delphos—after whom the city of Delphi was said to be named. Kleodora is known for bearing her son, Parnassus, with the god Poseidon. Parnassus is said to be the namesake of Mount Parnassus. In ancient times there was a tradition of worshiping nymphs in caves that housed natural springs, and the Corycian nymphs were also worshiped as part of this tradition. Additionally, the Corycian nymphs are often associated with Apollo. When Apollo killed Delphyne (a monster) near Mount Parnassus, it was said that the Corycian nymphs shouted to support the god and give him strength. Aided by the intercession of the Corycian Nymphs during his battle with Delphyne, Apollo was able to achieve the power of divination.

=== Pan ===
After the Battle of Marathon (490) Pan replaced Hermes as the god most associated with nymphs—including the Corycian Nymphs in Corycian Cave. Due to this association, Pan became regularly worshiped at Corycian Cave. Those who lived near Mount Parnassus regarded Pan as the guardian of Corycian Cave. Many of those who lived and worked around Mount Parnassus were hunters or shepherds, and Pan is associated with these professions. Many of the votives and artifacts found in Corycian Cave can be tied to the cult of Pan. There is also epigraphic evidence of worship to Pan, as he is mentioned in inscriptions carved into one of the Walls in Corycian Cave. Pan is also involved in an ancient ritual in which a shepherd will dress up as Pan and hunt for fish, and the fish will later be sacrificed to Pan after they are caught. This ritual is associated with Pan&#x27;s involvement in the mythic battle between Zeus and Typhon—which culminated in Typhon being banished to Corycian Cave.

=== Zeus ===

The Corycian Cave plays a key role in the mythological battle between Zeus and Typhon. Typhon was a mythological beast, born of Earth and Tartarus and he battled the gods, most notably Zeus. During their battle, Zeus and Typhon fought back and forth, Zeus throwing his lightning bolts, eventually injuring Typhon. However, Typhon also injured Zeus and was able to bring him, and imprison him in the Corycian Cave. Typhon had the cave guarded by the she-dragon Delphyne. Still however, Hermes and Aegipan were able to free Zeus and he went on to defeat Typhon. The Corycian Cave played a key role in the Greek mythological battles with the gods, and because Zeus was said to have been imprisoned in the cave, he was also worshipped there. 

===Dionysus===
While the connection to the Corycian nymphs and Pan are well established as they are mentioned in the nine inscriptions found at the cave as well in Pausanias, the connection to Dionysus is not as clear-cut. One of the inscriptions, which has been severely eroded by weathering, seems to say that Thyiades participated in ceremonies at the Corycian Cave. Also, when looking at Aeschylus’ work, the Eumenides, there seems to be a clear connection set up between Dionysus and the Corycian Cave. Additionally, in Pausanias’ Guide to Greece, when referring to the location of the Corycian Cave, Pausanias goes on to then describe the heights of Mount Parnassus and reveals to the reader that Thyiades raved there. Despite the wild raves taking place on top of the mountain as opposed to the cave, a clear connection between the surrounding area of the Corycian Cave and the Cult of Dionysus can still be seen. Further evidence for the connection between Dionysus and the Corycian Cave stems from Pan being often depicted in scenes with Dionysus, hinting at a connection between the two gods.

Finally, it is thought that the Corycian Cave is the place of residence of Dionysus, just as Apollo’s residence is Delphi. In the wintertime, when Apollo leaves Delphi, Dionysus comes down from the cave and occupies Apollo’s place in Delphi. This transition process involved the maidens of Delphi (assumed to be Thyiades) being sent to the cave and then help escort the god into the sanctuary and honor Dionysus in Apollo’s Temple.

<text>In Greek mythology, Oenone (; Ancient Greek: Οἰνώνη &quot;Oinōnē&quot;; &quot;wine woman&quot;) was the first wife of Paris of Troy, whom he abandoned for Helen. Oenone was also the ancient name of an island, which was later named after Aegina, daughter of the river god Asopus.

== Biography ==
Oenone was a mountain nymph on Mount Ida in Phrygia, a mountain associated with the Mother Goddess Cybele and the Titaness Rhea. Her gift of prophecy was learned from Rhea. Her father was either the river-gods, Cebren or Oeneus. Her name links her to the gift of wine.

== Mythology ==

Paris, son of the king Priam and the queen Hecuba, fell in love with Oenone when he was a shepherd on the slopes of Mount Ida, having been exposed in infancy (owing to a prophecy that he would be the means of the destruction of the city of Troy) and rescued by the herdsman Agelaus. The couple married, and Oenone gave birth to a son, Corythus. When Paris swore he would never desert her, Oenone (through her gift of prophecy) informed him that - whilst his love for her was true now - he would later sail across the sea to find another lover and bring ruin to his family. Paris, perhaps disturbed or afraid, always attempted to dismiss her warnings.

Her prediction came true when Paris abandoned her, returning to his birth parents in Troy and sailing across the Aegean for Helen, the queen of Sparta. Out of revenge for Paris&#x27;s betrayal, she sent Corythus to guide the Greeks to Troy. Another version has it that she used her son to drive a rift between Paris and Helen, but Paris, not recognizing his own son, killed him.

One of the only extensive surviving narrations of Oenone and Paris is Quintus Smyrnaeus, &quot;Posthomerica&quot;, Book X, ll. 259–489, which tells the return of the dying Paris to Oenone. Mortally wounded by Philoctetes&#x27;s arrow, he begged Oenone to heal him with her herbal arts, but she refused and cast him out with scorn, to return to Helen&#x27;s bed, and Paris died on the lower slopes of Ida. Then, overcome with remorse, Oenone, the one whole-hearted mourner of Paris, threw herself onto his burning funeral pyre, which the shepherds had raised.

A fragment of Bacchylides suggests that she threw herself off a cliff, in the &quot;Bibliotheke&quot; it is noted &quot;when she found him dead she hanged herself&quot;, and Lycophron imagines her hurtling head first from the towering walls of Troy. Her tragic story makes one of the &quot;Love Romances&quot; of Parthenius of Nicaea, where she jests to the messenger that Paris should have asked Helen to heal him but sets out to save her former husband all the same. Still, she arrives too late, and ends her life out of grief.

Ovid includes an imagined reproachful letter from Oenone to Paris in his &quot;Heroides&quot;, a text that has been extended by a number of spurious post-Ovidian interpolations, which include an elsewhere unattested rape of Oenone by Apollo.

== In literature ==
Thomas Heywood wrote the epyllion &quot;Oenone and Paris&quot; (1594) in rhyme royal.

William Morris included &quot;The Death of Paris&quot; in &quot;The Earthly Paradise.&quot;

Lawrence Binyon published &quot;Paris and Oenone&quot;, a one-act closet tragedy in blank verse, in 1906.

Tennyson adapted the source material of Smyrnaeus for &quot;The Death of Oenone&quot; (1892), distilling its tragic essence. This was Tennyson&#x27;s second poem on the subject; his previous attempt, &quot;Oenone&quot;, was critically panned when first published in 1833. The poem was practically rewritten between then and 1842 and the revised version has been described as exquisitely beautiful.

In Racine&#x27;s &quot;Phèdre&quot;, the name Oenone is given to Phaedra&#x27;s nurse, a character who also commits suicide.

<text>Corythus is the name of six mortal men in Greek mythology.

*Corythus, son of Marmarus, and one of the court of Cepheus. He wounded Pelates during the battle at the wedding feast of Perseus and Andromeda.
*Corythus, an Italian king and father, in some sources, of Iasion and Dardanus by Electra.
*Corythus, one of the Lapiths. Only a youth, he was killed nonetheless by Rhoetus, one of the Centaurs.
*Corythus, an Iberian, beloved of Heracles. Was said to have been the first to devise a helmet (Greek &quot;korys&quot;, gen. &quot;korythos&quot;), which took its name from him.
*Corythus, one of the Doliones. He was killed by Tydeus.
*Corythus, a king who raised Telephus, son of Heracles and Auge, as his own son.
*Corythus, son of Paris and the nymph Oenone. After Paris abandoned Oenone, she sent the boy - now grown - to Troy, to incite jealousy in his father and to plot &quot;something bad&quot; against Paris&#x27; second wife. He fell in love with her, and she &quot;received him warmly&quot;. Upon discovering this, Paris killed him – unable to recognise his own son. Other versions state Oenone sent Corythus to guide the Achaean armies to Troy. Corythus was alternatively said to be the son of Helen and Paris, who died along with his two brothers when a roof collapsed in Troy.

<text>In Greek mythology, Kratos, also known as Cratus or Cratos, is the divine personification of strength. He is the son of Pallas and Styx. Kratos and his siblings Nike (&#x27;Victory&#x27;), Bia (&#x27;Force&#x27;), and Zelus (&#x27;Glory&#x27;) are all the personification of a specific trait. Kratos is first mentioned alongside his siblings in Hesiod&#x27;s &quot;Theogony&quot;. According to Hesiod, Kratos and his siblings dwell with Zeus because their mother Styx came to him first to request a position in his regime, so he honored her and her children with exalted positions. Kratos and his sister Bia are best known for their appearance in the opening scene of Aeschylus&#x27; &quot;Prometheus Bound&quot;. Acting as agents of Zeus, they lead the captive Titan Prometheus on stage. Kratos compels the mild-mannered blacksmith god Hephaestus to chain Prometheus to a rock as punishment for his theft of fire.

Kratos is characterized as brutal and merciless, repeatedly mocking both Hephaestus and Prometheus and advocating for the use of unnecessary violence. He defends Zeus&#x27; oppressive rule and predicts that Prometheus will never escape his bonds. In Aeschylus&#x27; &quot;Libation Bearers&quot;, Electra calls upon Kratos, Dike (&quot;Justice&quot;), and Zeus to aid her brother Orestes in avenging the murder of their father Agamemnon. Kratos and Bia appear in a late fifth-century BC red-figure Attic &quot;skyphos&quot; of the punishment of Ixion, possibly based on a scene from a lost tragedy by Euripides. They also appear in late eighteenth and nineteenth-century Romantic depictions and adaptations of the binding of Prometheus.

== Ancient Greek literature and art ==
=== &quot;Theogony&quot; ===
Kratos and his siblings are first mentioned in the &quot;Theogony&quot;, which was composed by the Boeotian poet Hesiod in the late eighth or early seventh century BC. Hesiod states: &quot;And Styx the daughter of Ocean was joined to Pallas and bore Zelus (Emulation) and trim-ankled Nike (Victory) in the house. Also she brought forth Cratos (Strength) and Bia (Force), wonderful children. These have no house apart from Zeus, nor any dwelling nor path except that wherein God leads them, but they dwell always with Zeus the loud-thunderer.&quot; Here Kratos is merely listed as a deified abstraction with little development or explanation. Hesiod goes on to explain that the reason why the children of Styx were allowed to dwell with Zeus was because Zeus had decreed after the Titanomachy that all those who had not held offices under Kronos would be given positions in his regime. Because Styx came to Zeus first, along with her children, Zeus honored them as among the highest members of his new regime. According to Diana Burton, Styx, Zelos, Nike, Kratos, and Bia&#x27;s voluntary change in allegiance represents the certainty of Zeus&#x27; victory over the Titans. While the goddesses Dike (&quot;Justice&quot;), Eunomia (&quot;Good Law&quot;), and Eirene (&quot;Peace&quot;) represent the benefits of Zeus&#x27; reign, Kratos and his siblings represent the work needed to build that regime.

=== &quot;Prometheus Bound&quot; ===
In the opening scene of the tragedy &quot;Prometheus Bound&quot;, which is traditionally attributed to Aeschylus, Kratos and his sister Bia are taking Prometheus to a remote location in the Scythian wilderness, where he will be chained to a rocky outcropping. The order to do this was given by Zeus himself and Kratos and Bia are portrayed as the embodiment of Zeus&#x27; new regime. The presence of Kratos and Bia but absence of Nike and Zelos indicates the play&#x27;s tyrannical portrayal of Zeus, since Kratos and Bia represent the more tyrannical aspects of authority. Kratos in particular represents what Ian Ruffell calls &quot;the kind of uncomplicated thug for whom despotic regimes offer countless job opportunities.&quot; He enforces the power of Zeus through physical brutality and pitilessness. Bia, though present in the scene, does not have any lines; only Kratos speaks.

Kratos coerces the mild-mannered blacksmith god Hephaestus into chaining Prometheus to the rocky crag, despite Hephaestus&#x27; objections to this. Hephaestus laments over Prometheus&#x27; future suffering, leading Kratos to ridicule him. Kratos equates the rule of law with rule by fear and condemns pity as a pointless waste of time. Hephaestus and Kratos agree that Zeus is &quot;oppressive&quot; (&quot;barys&quot;; literally &quot;heavy&quot;). Kratos regards justice (δίκη; &quot;dikê&quot;) as a system of cosmic hierarchy in which the monarch, Zeus, decides who receives which privileges and who does not. Anyone who breaches this social divide is a transgressor who must be punished. Kratos states that, under the rule of a monarch such as Zeus, no one but Zeus himself is truly free. Hephaestus agrees with this assessment.

Kratos repeatedly orders Hephaestus to use more violence than necessary to inflict as much pain as possible against Prometheus. First he orders Hephaestus to nail Prometheus&#x27; hands to the rock. Then he orders him to drive a steel wedge through his chest. Finally, he orders him to tie Prometheus&#x27; legs to immobilize him. Hephaestus criticizes Kratos, telling him that his speech is as ugly as his physical appearance. Kratos responds by telling him, &quot;Be soft. Do not throw in my face my &#x27;willfulness&#x27; and &#x27;roughness of temper&#x27;.&quot; Once Prometheus has been bound, Hephaestus, Bia, and Kratos exit offstage, with Kratos being the last one to leave. Just before his exeunt, Kratos mocks Prometheus, saying that he will never escape from his shackles (which he later does, aided by Heracles) and that he does not deserve his name. (&quot;Prometheus&quot; means &quot;forethought&quot; in Greek.) According to Robert Holmes Beck, Aeschylus&#x27; depiction of the harsh punishment of Prometheus was intended as an example of how wrongdoers must be punished to deter others from transgressing. In this interpretation, Kratos&#x27; cruelty is not intended to be viewed as excessive, but rather as the proper enforcement of justice.

In Aeschylus&#x27; &quot;Libation Bearers&quot;, Electra invokes Kratos, Dike, and Zeus to support her and her brother Orestes&#x27; quest to avenge the murder of their father Agamemnon by their mother Clytemnestra. Plato&#x27;s dialogue &quot;Protagoras&quot;, written in the fourth century BC, includes an account of the legend of Prometheus in which Prometheus stole fire from the temple of Athena and Hephaestus rather than the citadel of Zeus because the &quot;guards of Zeus&quot; (Διὸς φυλακαί; &quot;Dios phylakai&quot;) were too frightening. The identity of these &quot;guards&quot; is unknown and disputed.

Depictions of Kratos and Bia in ancient Greek art are extremely rare. The only known surviving depiction of Kratos and Bia in ancient Greek pottery is on a fragmentary red-figure &quot;skyphos&quot; by the Meidias Painter, or a member of his circle, that is dated to the end of the fifth century BC and depicts the punishment of Ixion. The vase is in the private collection of Herbert Cahn in Basel, Switzerland, and only a bit of hair belonging to Kratos is still visible on the remaining fragments. One of Bia&#x27;s hands is visible on the wheel that Ixion is bound to, steadying it. H. A. Shapiro conjectures that this is probably a representation of a scene from the lost tragedy &quot;Ixion&quot; by Euripides, who likely borrowed the figures of Kratos and Bia from &quot;Prometheus Bound&quot;. Kratos is listed as one of the sons of Pallas and Styx in the &quot;Library&quot; of Pseudo-Apollodorus.

In the preface to his &quot;Fabulae&quot;, the Roman author Gaius Julius Hyginus describes Potestas (Power) as being among the offspring of Pallas and Styx.

== In modern culture ==

In 1772, Thomas Morell published his English translation of &quot;Prometheus Bound&quot; as &quot;Prometheus in Chains&quot;, making the work widely available to the British public for the first time. Four years afterwards, the abolitionist Richard Potter published a complete English translation of all Aeschylus&#x27; tragedies. The scene from &quot;Prometheus Bound&quot; in which Hephaestus chains Prometheus to a mountainside with the aid of Kratos and Bia captured the imagination of the eighteenth and nineteenth-century Romantics and became a lens through which they analyzed questions of the relationships between revolution and tyranny, slavery and freedom, and war and peace.

Richard Porson&#x27;s 1795 translation of &quot;Prometheus Bound&quot; was illustrated with drawings by John Flaxman showing the famous binding scene. Between 1798 and 1799, George Romney produced a series of chalk drawings of scenes from &quot;Prometheus Bound&quot;, including the binding scene with Kratos and Bia. In both Flaxman and Romney&#x27;s illustrations, Kratos and Bia are shown together in symmetry. In 1819, Percy Bysshe Shelley adapted the myth of Prometheus for his own play &quot;Prometheus Unbound&quot;.

In Gabriel Fauré&#x27;s three-act opera &quot;Prométhée&quot;, first performed in 1900 with a French libretto written by the poets Jean Lorrain and André-Ferdinand Hérold, the scene from the beginning of &quot;Prometheus Bound&quot; in which Kratos coerces Hephaestus into binding Prometheus is closely paraphrased. Hephaestus&#x27; dialogue with Kratos is set to music containing &quot;impressionist allusions to the whole-tone scale&quot;. Fauré was known for his soft, genteel chamber music and the &quot;hateful fury&quot; of the music behind Kratos and Bia&#x27;s dialogue stunned audiences.

A character named Kratos appears in the &quot;God of War&quot; video game franchise, the first seven games of which are based on Greek mythology. The character is portrayed as what classical scholar Sylwia Chmielewski calls &quot;a deeply tragic, Herculean anti-hero who, after murdering his family, has to wash away the miasma to regain his peace of mind.&quot; The video game character Kratos was given his name at a late stage in the development of the original 2005 game, after the character had already been fleshed out. Unaware of the actual mythological god named Kratos appearing in &quot;Prometheus Bound&quot;, the creators coincidentally chose the name Kratos, the same Greek word meaning &quot;Strength&quot;, of which the mythological figure Kratos is the personification. Stig Asmussen, the director of 2010&#x27;s &quot;God of War III&quot;, called the naming coincidence a &quot;happy mistake&quot;, noting that the Kratos in the game and the one in &quot;Prometheus Bound&quot; are both &quot;pawns&quot;. Zoran Iovanovici of California State University, Long Beach observed with irony that, while the mythological Kratos is best known for chaining Prometheus, in 2007&#x27;s &quot;God of War II&quot;, the video game character releases him. Chmielewski states that the video game character Kratos draws extensively on other figures from Greek mythology, including the heroes Perseus, Theseus, and Achilles, but his strongest influence is the hero Heracles. The Greek-based games portray Kratos as brutal and violent towards innocents. In &quot;God of War III&quot;, he kills the vast majority of the Greek gods, who are portrayed as &quot;corrupted and vengeful&quot;, and restores the original state of primordial chaos to Greece.

<doc id="79936" wikidata="Q189208" url="?curid=79936" title="Zelus">
<text>In Greek mythology, Zelus or Zelos (; ) was the daimon that personifies dedication, emulation, eager rivalry, envy, jealousy, and zeal. The English word &quot;zeal&quot; is derived from his name.

== Family ==
Zelus was the son of Pallas (the Titan) and Styx (an Oceanid). His siblings were Nike (Victory), Kratos (Strength), and Bia (Force).

== Mythology ==

=== Titanomachy ===
Zelus together with his siblings were winged enforcers who stood in attendance at Zeus&#x27; throne and formed part of his retinue.

==== Theogony ====
: And Styx the daughter of Okeanos (Oceanus) was joined to Pallas and bare Zelos (Zelus, Emulation) and trim-ankled Nike (Victory) in the house. Also she brought forth Kratos (Cratus, Strength) and Bia (Force), wonderful children. These have no house apart from Zeus, nor any dwelling nor path except that wherein God leads them, but they dwell always with Zeus the loud-thunderer. For so did Styx the deathless daughter of Okeanos plan on that day when the Olympian Lightener called all the deathless gods to great Olympos (Olympus), and said that whosoever of the gods would fight with him against the Titanes, he would not cast him out from his rights, but each should have the office which he had before amongst the deathless gods. And he declared that he who was without office and rights as is just. So deathless Styx came first to Olympos with her children through the wit of her dear father. And Zeus honoured her, and gave her very great gifts, for her he appointed to be the great oath of the gods, and her children to live with him always. And as he promised, so he performed fully unto them all.

==== Bibliotheca ====
: Nike, Kratos (Cratus), Zelos (Zelus), and Bia were born to Pallas and Styx. Zeus instituted and oath to be sworn by the waters of Styx that flowed from a rock in Haides&#x27; realm, an honor granted in return for the help she and her children gave him against the Titanes (Titans).

=== Other appearances ===
Zelus’ Roman name was Invidia, which, in Latin, meant &quot;to look against in a hostile manner&quot;. Because of its relation to Zelus, his Roman form was sometimes associated with the seven deadly sins.

==== Works and Days ====
: Among the men of the fifth age . . . There will be no favour for the man who keeps his oath or for the just (dikaios) or for the good (agathos); but rather men will praise the evil-doer (kakos) and his violent dealing (hybris). Strength will be right (dike) and reverence (aidos) will cease to be; and the wicked will hurt the worthy man, speaking false words against him, and will swear an oath upon them. Envy (zelos), foul-mouthed, delighting in evil, with scowling face, will go along with wretched men one and all. And then Aidos (Aedos, Shame) and Nemesis (Indignation), with their sweet forms wrapped in white robes, will go from the wide-pathed earth and forsake mankind to join the company of the deathless gods: and bitter sorrows (lugra algea) will be left for mortal men, and there will be no help against evil.

==== Cynegetica ====
: O father Zeus, how fierce a heart hath Zelos (Zelus, Rivalry)! Him hast thou made, O lord, mightier than nature to behold and has given him the bitter force of fire, and in his right hand hast vouchsafed to him to wear a sword of adamant. He preserves not, when he comes, dear children to their loving parents, he knows nor comrade nor kin nor cousin, when he intervenes grievous and unspeakable. He also in former times arrayed against their own children heroes themselves and hobble heroines.

Zelos may have also been identified with Agon, the personification of competition, and was closely connected with Eris. He was sometimes associated with Phthonus, the daimon of romantic jealousy.

==== Christianity ====
It is considered that later the Catholic Church adapted him to its doctrine (considering only its aspect related to religious fervor), providing Zelo with wings and replacing the lamp and the whip with a gospel and a flaming sword.

According to the &quot;interpretatio graeca&quot;, he is also associated with the rider of the white horse, which represents conquest or glory.

<doc id="79938" wikidata="Q631865" url="?curid=79938" title="Crinisus">
<text>Crimisus (or Crinisus in Virgil&#x27;s &quot;Aeneid&quot; and subsequent Roman texts) was the god of the Sicilian river Crinisus in Greek and Roman mythology. According to most versions of the myth, Crinisus fathered Acestes with a Trojan woman while in the form of a dog. Acestes then went on to found Segesta, which he named after his mother. Segestan coins from 475–390 BCE often depict a dog on one side, and a woman&#x27;s head on the other, which have traditionally been associated with Crinisus and the eponymous Segesta.

==Myth==
Lycophron&#x27;s &quot;Alexandra&quot; contains the first known version of this myth. When Troy was under attack from a sea monster, king Laomedon instructed mariners to take the three daughters of Phoenodamas to die of exposure and be devoured by wild beasts. They were taken to Sicily, but survived there, and built a great shrine to Aphrodite in thanks. The River Crimissus, in the likeness of a dog, took one of them (not named by Lycophron) as his bride, and had a son with her. Their son (also not named here) became the &quot;settler and founder of three places&quot; (generally considered to be Segesta, Eryx, and Entella), and guided Elymus from Dardanus to western Sicily. He concludes by saying that the people of Aegesta (Segesta) continue to mourn the loss of Troy long after its destruction (&quot;Alexandra&quot;, 951–977).

Virgil&#x27;s &quot;Aeneid&quot; briefly describes Acestes as being &quot;born of a Trojan mother to the river god Crinisus&quot; (&quot;Aeneid&quot;, 5.38), and Gaius Julius Hyginus also calls Acestes &quot;son of the river Crinisus&quot; (&quot;Fabulae&quot;, 273).

Servius the Grammarian&#x27;s commentary on the &quot;Aeneid&quot; gives the most complete version of the myth. After Neptune and Apollo built the walls of Troy, and were refused their promised reward by king Laomedon, Neptune sent sea monsters to the city, and Apollo decreed that the daughters of the nobility should be attacked by them. Fearing for his daughter Egesta, Hippotes (or Isostratus) sent her away from Troy in a ship, which was carried to Sicily on winds sent by the River Crimissus. Crimissus turned into a bear or a dog and mated with her, producing Egestus, who founded the Trojan city of Egesta there, named after his mother, which later became known as Segesta. Servius also notes that Virgil used poetic license to change the river god&#x27;s name from Crimissus to Crinisus, and his son&#x27;s name from Egestus to Acestes (&quot;Commentary on the Aeneid&quot;, 1.550).

In contrast to this, Claudius Aelianus&#x27; &quot;Varia Historia&quot; stated that the people of Segesta &quot;honour the Porpax, Crimisus, and Telmessus in the form of men&quot; (&quot;Varia Historia&quot;, 2.33).

Dionysius of Halicarnassus&#x27; &quot;Roman Antiquities&quot; has a different version of the story, with Acestes&#x27; father as &quot;a youth of distinguished family&quot;, who was in love with Acestes&#x27; mother, accompanied her from Troy, and married her when they arrived in Sicily (&quot;Roman Antiquities&quot;, 1.52.1–4).

==Coins==
Ancient coins from Segesta often have a dog on one side, and the head of a woman on the other. The similarity between these images and the Crinisus myth has led to academic debate about whether or not they depict Crinisus and the eponymous Segesta.

Coins of this type originated from Segesta after the defeat of the Carthiginians at the Battle of Himera in 480 BCE. The first of these coins are didrachmas produced from 475 BCE, which show a dog sniffing the ground; from 460 BCE they also produced coins with a dog looking back, from 455 BCE looking forward, and from 430 BCE following a scent. Around 415–400 BCE, new designs started to appear, such as litra with a standing dog with a shell and a gorgoneion or solar head on one side, and a three-quarter woman&#x27;s head surrounded by a laurel wreath on the other. From 412/410–400 BCE, hunting scenes appear, such as a dog carrying the head of a deer on didrachmas, hunting a hare on smaller denominations, and a hunter (sometimes identified as Crinisus) accompanied by a dog. This may reflect increasingly aggressive attitudes between the settlements of western Sicily around this time, including territorial disputes between Segesta and Selinunte. Coins with these dog motifs continued to be produced until around 390 BCE.

These Segestan designs spread to Eryx by 460 BCE, and Panormus and Motya from 430 BCE. Around 415 BCE, a coin from Alikai depicts a nymph sacrificing a dog or wolf on an altar, and litrae from Eryx at the same time show a dog standing proudly on one side, and on the other a full-length Aphrodite seated on a chair, and either holding a dove or stretching her hand out to Eros, who crowns her.

Numismatists traditionally considered the woman to depict a local nymph, the eponymous Segesta, though Karl Galinsky argues that it may be the goddess Artemis, who Cicero reported had a famous statue at Segesta. Aphrodite Urania has also been suggested.

<text>In Greek mythology, Cebren (Ancient Greek: Κεβρην) was a Greek river-god, whose river was located near Troy. He was the son of Oceanus and Tethys and he was the father of Asterope and Hesperia, who are sometimes considered to be the same person, and Oenone. The city Cebrene (also spelled Kebrene or Kevrin) was named for Cebren.

<doc id="79940" wikidata="Q192136" url="?curid=79940" title="Crius">
<text>In Greek mythology, Crius (; or Κριός, &quot;Kreios&quot;/&quot;Krios&quot;) was one of the Titans, children of Uranus and Gaia.

== Etymology ==
Although &quot;krios&quot; was also the ancient Greek word for &quot;ram&quot;, the Titan&#x27;s chthonic position in the underworld means no classical association with Aries, the ram of the zodiac, is ordinarily made. At the time of Ancient Greece, Aries was the first visible constellation in the sky at the spring season, marking the start of the new year in the ancient Greek calendar.

== Family ==
According to Hesiod, with Eurybia, daughter of Gaia (&quot;Earth&quot;) and Pontus (&quot;Sea&quot;), he fathered Astraios, Pallas, and Perses. The joining of Astraios with Eos, the Dawn, brought forth Eosphoros, Hesperus, Astraea, the other stars, and the winds.

== Mythology ==
Joined to fill out lists of Titans to form a total matching the Twelve Olympians, Crius was inexorably involved in the ten-year-long war between the Olympian gods and Titans, the Titanomachy, though without any specific part to play. When the war was lost, Crius was banished along with the others to the lower level of Hades called Tartarus.

As the least individualized among the Titans, he was overthrown in the Titanomachy. M. L. West has suggested how Hesiod filled out the complement of Titans from the core group—adding three figures from the archaic tradition of Delphi, Coeus, and Phoebe, whose name Apollo assumed with the oracle, and Themis. Among possible further interpolations among the Titans was Crius, whose interest for Hesiod was as the father of Perses and grandfather of Hecate, for whom Hesiod was, according to West, an &quot;enthusiastic evangelist&quot;.

<doc id="79941" wikidata="Q2494846" url="?curid=79941" title="Duke of Cornwall">
<text>Duke of Cornwall () is a title in the Peerage of England, traditionally held by the eldest son of the reigning British monarch, previously the English monarch. The Duchy of Cornwall was the first duchy created in England and was established in a royal charter in 1337 by King Edward III. In 2022, Prince William became Duke of Cornwall with the accession to the throne of his father, King Charles III; William&#x27;s wife, Catherine, became Duchess of Cornwall.

==Legend==
Some folk histories of the British Isles, such as Geoffrey of Monmouth&#x27;s &quot;History of the Kings of Britain&quot; (1136), claim that the first leader of Cornwall was Corineus, a Trojan warrior and ally of Brutus of Troy, portrayed as the original settler of the British Isles. From then through the Arthurian period, such legendary dukes of Cornwall stood apart from the high king of Britain, while serving as his closest ally and, at times, as his protector (all per Monmouth&#x27;s collected yarns). Notably in this tale, Gorlois, duke of Cornwall under King Uther Pendragon, rebelled when the king became obsessed with Gorlois&#x27; wife Igraine. Uther killed Gorlois and took Igraine: the son was King Arthur.

==History==
The historical record suggests that, following the Anglo-Saxon settlement of Britain, Cornwall formed part of a separate Kingdom of Dumnonia, which included Devon, although there is evidence that it may have had its own rulers at times. The Celtic southwest of Britain was gradually conquered by the emerging Germanic Kingdom of England, and after the Norman Conquest in 1066, the new rulers of England appointed their own men as earl of Cornwall, the first of whom was in fact a Breton of Cornouaille in Brittany.

Edward of Woodstock (widely known as &#x27;The Black Prince&#x27;), the eldest son of Edward III, was made the first duke of Cornwall in 1337, after Edward III claimed the title of King of France. Cornwall was the first dukedom conferred within the Kingdom of England.

==Succession==
The charter that established the estate on 17 March 1337 set out the rule that the duke and possessor of the estate would be the eldest son and heir apparent of the monarch. There were some deviations from this rule until a legal case (the Prince&#x27;s Case) in 1606, which held that the rule should be adhered to.

When the estate is without a duke, the possessor is the monarch, even if the former duke left surviving descendants. The monarch&#x27;s grandson, even if he is the heir apparent, does not succeed to the dukedom. Similarly, no female may ever be duke of Cornwall, even if she is heir presumptive or heir apparent (this being a distinct and even likely possibility in the future after the passage of the Succession to the Crown Act 2013), although a queen regnant without a son would be the de facto duke. However, if a duke of Cornwall should die without descendants (and also no sister between the two brothers if the younger one was born after 28 October 2011), his next brother obtains the duchy, this brother being both the oldest living son and heir apparent.

It is possible for an individual to be prince of Wales and heir apparent without being duke of Cornwall. The title &#x27;Prince of Wales&#x27; is the traditional title of the heir apparent to the throne, granted at the discretion of the sovereign (not automatically) and is not restricted to the eldest son.

For example, after the death of Frederick, Prince of Wales, George II&#x27;s heir apparent was his grandson George (Frederick&#x27;s eldest son and the future George III). The young Prince George was created Prince of Wales but did not become Duke of Cornwall because he was the king&#x27;s grandson, rather than his son. When the sovereign has no legitimate son, or when the heir apparent is not the sovereign&#x27;s son, the estates of the duchy revert to the Crown until a legitimate son is born or until the accession of a new monarch who has a son.

James Francis Edward Stuart, son of James II, was born Duke of Cornwall in 1688. Although his father lost the throne, James Francis Edward was not deprived of his own titles and honours as a result of his father&#x27;s deposition. Instead, from the (prevailing) Hanoverian perspective, it was as a result of his claiming his father&#x27;s lost thrones that James was attainted for treason on 2 March 1702, and his titles were thus forfeited under English law. However, from the (minority) Jacobite perspective, on his father&#x27;s death in 1701 the duchy was merged with the Crown.

==Rights of the duke==
The duchy includes over 220 square miles (570 square kilometres) of land, more than half of which lies in Devon. The duke has the right to the estates of all those who die without named heirs (&quot;bona vacantia&quot;) in Cornwall, and also appoints the High Sheriff of Cornwall; in most of England and Wales the Crown has these rights, the other exception being the Duchy of Lancaster, a private estate held in trust for the sovereign. The duke having these rights has contributed to the debate over the constitutional status of Cornwall.

In 2013, the duchy had a revenue surplus of £19 million, a sum that was exempt from income tax, though Prince Charles, the duke, chose to pay the tax voluntarily. Until 2011, if there was no duke of Cornwall the income of the duchy went to the Crown. Under the Sovereign Grant Act 2011, revenues of the duchy now pass to the heir to the throne regardless of whether or not they are duke of Cornwall. When the heir is a minor, 10% of revenues pass to them, with the balance passing to the Crown; the Sovereign Grant is reduced by the same amount.

==Arms==
The coat of arms of the duke of Cornwall is blazoned as &quot;sable, fifteen bezants&quot;, that is, a black field bearing fifteen golden discs. The arms are now used as a badge by the prince of Wales, and they appear below the shield in his coat of arms, along with his other badges.

The arms were adopted late in the 15th century, based on the arms of Richard, Earl of Cornwall. The bezants in Richard&#x27;s arms were intended to represent peas, known in French as &quot;pois&quot;, as a punning reference to the French region of Poitou, of which he was count.

On 21 June 1968 a royal warrant augmented the aforementioned arms with the heir apparent&#x27;s coronet, which consists of four crosses patée and four fleurs-de-lises with one arch (used only by the prince of Wales). The supporters are two Cornish choughs, each supporting an ostrich feather. The motto used with the arms is , meaning &quot;high-spirited&quot; in Middle Low German, the personal motto of the Black Prince.

==Dukes of Cornwall, 1337 creation==
All dukes of Cornwall who have been the eldest living son of the sovereign are generally considered to have held the same &quot;creation&quot; of the dukedom. The following is a table of these dukes of Cornwall, with the processes by which they became duke and by which they ceased to hold the title:

==Dukes of Cornwall, 1376 creation==
When his heir apparent, Edward the Black Prince, predeceased him, Edward III granted a new creation of the title &#x27;duke of Cornwall&#x27; to his grandson, Richard. When he acceded to the throne as Richard II in 1377, this creation merged with the Crown.
*Richard of Bordeaux (1367–1400)
:&quot;also Prince of Wales and Earl of Chester (1376)&quot;

==Dukes of Cornwall, 1460 creation==
When Richard Plantagenet, Duke of York, pressed his claim to the throne, he was made heir apparent to Henry VI by the Act of Accord. On 31 October 1460, he was made prince of Wales and earl of Chester, duke of Cornwall and Lord Protector of England. Since he was not the eldest living son of the monarch, this creation was outside the terms of the 1337 warrant; York died in battle two months later, on 30 December 1460.
*Richard Plantagenet (1411–1460)
:&quot;also Lord Protector of England, Prince of Wales and Earl of Chester (1460, see Act of Accord); Duke of York (1385), Earl of Ulster (1264), Earl of March (1328), Earl of Cambridge (1414, restored 1426), feudal Lord of Clare (bt. 1066–1075), Baron Mortimer of Wigmore (1331)&quot;

==Jacobite duke==
Charles Edward Stuart (&#x27;The Young Pretender&#x27;), eldest son and heir apparent of James Francis Edward Stuart (&#x27;The Old Pretender&#x27;), was born in Rome on 31 December 1720, and shortly after his birth, he was declared prince of Wales, duke of Cornwall and earl of Chester in the Jacobite succession. With the death of the Old Pretender on 1 January 1766, he acceded to his father&#x27;s claim to be King of England, Scotland, France, and Ireland. He died on 31 January 1788.

<text>The crime of apartheid is defined by the 2002 Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court as inhumane acts of a character similar to other crimes against humanity &quot;committed in the context of an institutionalized regime of systematic oppression and domination by one racial group over any other racial group or groups and committed with the intention of maintaining that regime&quot;.

On 30 November 1973, the United Nations General Assembly opened for signature and ratification The International Convention on the Suppression and Punishment of the Crime of Apartheid. It defined the crime of apartheid as &quot;inhuman acts committed for the purpose of establishing and maintaining domination by one racial group of persons over any other racial group of persons and systematically oppressing them&quot;.

According to Human Rights Watch and legal scholar Miles Jackson, apartheid is also prohibited in customary international law although there is still debate as to whether it is criminalized as well. Legal scholars Gerhard Kemp and Windell Nortje noted that in 2021, two individuals (former members of apartheid South Africa&#x27;s security police) became the first persons ever to be prosecuted for the crime of apartheid under customary international law. 

==History==

The term &quot;&quot;, from Afrikaans for &#x27;apartness&#x27;, was the official name of the South African system of racial segregation which existed after 1948. Complaints about the system were brought to the United Nations as early as 12 July 1948 when Padmanabha Pillai, the representative of India to the United Nations, circulated a letter to the secretary-general expressing his concerns over treatment of ethnic Indians within the Union of South Africa. As it became more widely known, South African apartheid was condemned internationally as unjust and racist and many decided that a formal legal framework was needed in order to apply international pressure on the South African government.

In 1971, the Soviet Union and Guinea together submitted early drafts of a convention to deal with the suppression and punishment of apartheid. In 1973, the General Assembly of the United Nations agreed on the text of the International Convention on the Suppression and Punishment of the Crime of Apartheid (ICSPCA). The convention has 31 signatories and 107 parties.
The convention came into force in 1976 after 20 countries had ratified it. They were: Benin, Bulgaria, Chad, Czechoslovakia, Ecuador, the German Democratic Republic (East Germany), Guinea, Hungary, Iraq, Mongolia, Poland, Qatar, Somalia, Syria, the USSR, the United Arab Emirates, Tanzania, and Yugoslavia.

&quot;As such, apartheid was declared to be a crime against humanity, with a scope that went far beyond South Africa. While the crime of apartheid is most often associated with the racist policies of South Africa after 1948, the term more generally refers to racially based policies in any state.&quot;

Seventy-six other countries subsequently signed on, but a number of nations, including Western democracies, have neither signed nor ratified the ICSPCA, including Canada, France, Germany, Israel, Italy, the Netherlands, the United Kingdom, Australia, New Zealand and the United States. In explanation of the US vote against the convention, Ambassador Clarence Clyde Ferguson Jr. said: &quot;[W]e cannot... accept that apartheid can in this manner be made a crime against humanity. Crimes against humanity are so grave in nature that they must be meticulously elaborated and strictly construed under existing international law...&quot;

In 1977, Addition Protocol 1 to the Geneva Conventions designated apartheid as a grave breach of the protocol and a war crime. There are 169 parties to the protocol.

The International Criminal Court provides for individual criminal responsibility for crimes against humanity, including the crime of apartheid.

The ICC came into being on 1 July 2002, and can only prosecute crimes committed on or after that date. The court can generally only exercise jurisdiction in cases where the accused is a national of a state party, the alleged crime took place on the territory of a state party, or a situation is referred to the court by the United Nations Security Council. The ICC exercises complimentary jurisdiction. Many of the member states have provided their own national courts with universal jurisdiction over the same offenses and do not recognize any statute of limitations for crimes against humanity. As of July 2008, 106 countries are states parties (with Suriname and Cook Islands set to join in October 2008), and a further 40 countries have signed but not yet ratified the treaty. However, many of the world&#x27;s most populous nations, including China, India, the United States, Indonesia, and Pakistan are not parties to the court and therefore are not subject to its jurisdiction, except by security council referral.

==ICSPCA definition of the crime of apartheid==

Article II of the ICSPCA defines the crime of apartheid as:
===UN definition of racial discrimination===

According to the United Nations Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination (ICERD),
This definition does not make any difference between discrimination based on ethnicity and race, in part because the distinction between the two remains debatable among anthropologists. Similarly, in British law the phrase &quot;racial group&quot; means &quot;any group of people who are defined by reference to their race, colour, nationality (including citizenship) or ethnic or national origin&quot;.

==ICC definition of the crime of apartheid==

Article 7 of the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court defines the crime of apartheid as:
The &#x27;crime of apartheid&#x27; means inhumane acts of a character similar to those referred to in paragraph 1, committed in the context of an institutionalised regime of systematic oppression and domination by one racial group over any other racial group or groups and committed with the intention of maintaining that regime.

== Court Cases ==

The International Court of Justice in its 2024 case on Israel&#x27;s occupation of the Palestinian territories, gave an advisory opinion which found that Israel was in breach of Article 3 of International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination, including &quot;racial segregation and apartheid&quot;. HRW declared that &quot;World Court Finds Israel Responsible for Apartheid&quot;.

<text>Real Sporting de Gijón, S.A.D. (), commonly known as Real Sporting, Sporting Gijón, or simply Sporting is a Spanish professional football club from Gijón, Principality of Asturias. Founded on 1 July 1905, it plays in the Segunda Division. Known as &quot;Los Rojiblancos&quot; because of their red and white striped jerseys, their home ground is El Molinón stadium, the oldest professional football ground in Spain, in use since at least 1908. Traditionally their red and white shirts are accompanied by blue shorts with the socks also being blue. Its Asturian name is &quot;Real Sporting de Xixón&quot;.

The most important milestones of the club were in the 1970s and 1980s, when it finished as runner-up of the 1978–79 La Liga and played two finals of the Copa del Rey in 1981 and 1982.

Real Sporting is also one of only nine Spanish teams that have never played below the second division. Its local rivals are Real Oviedo from the neighbouring city slightly inland.

==History==

===1905–1940: First years===
The club was established in 1905 with the name Sporting Gijonés, Anselmo López being the first club president. The first game of the club is dated on 18 August 1907, against Sport Ovetense. The decline of other local clubs like Gijón Sport Club (founded in 1903) and Sportiva Gijonesa allowed Sporting Gijonés to become the main team in the city. In 1912, King Alfonso XIII accepted the Royal patronage of the club for the Spanish Crown, introducing the term &quot;Real&quot; (Spanish for &quot;Royal&quot;) to its name, becoming Real Sporting Club Gijonés.

In 1914, Sporting Gijón won its first Regional Championship of Asturias, success repeated two years later when the club started the first steps to buy El Molinón, where Sporting started to play its games in 1915. On 2 April 1916, a new change took place to adopt today&#x27;s denomination, Real Sporting de Gijón. Thanks to the win at the Regional Championship, on 24 April 1917 the club made its debut in the Copa del Rey, but was eliminated in the first round by Arenas Club de Getxo. Sporting lost both games by 0–1 in Gijón and 0–7 at the Basque Country.

On 9 October 1921, Manolo Meana became the first Sporting Gijón player to be called up with the Spanish national team, for a friendly game against Belgium. In 1929, Sporting Gijón joined Segunda División. In its first season, the club finished in the fourth position.

===1940–1970: Real Gijón era===
From 1940 until 1970, due to a temporary law forbidding the use of foreign words in football club names, the team&#x27;s official denomination was Real Gijón.

In 1944, the club was promoted to La Liga for the first time as champion of the 1943–44 Segunda División. The first game in the top tier was played on 24 September 1944, against Español at Sarriá. The game finished without goals. The first goal was scored in the next game against Deportivo de La Coruña, by Gundemaro, but the first win did not arrive until the week 6, when the team beat Atlético Aviación by 2–0. Sporting Still is in remaining in La Liga Right now.

Until the 1970s, Sporting alternated both divisions, spending all the decade of the 1960s in Segunda División. At the end of the 1960–61 Segunda División the club was relegated to Tercera División after losing the relegation playoffs against Burgos, but the resignation of Condal to continue playing in the second tier allows Sporting to play a repechage playoff against Sevilla Atlético and Castellón. In the first match, Sporting tied 3–3 against Castellón. The winner of the match would be decided by a coin toss. After winning the two previous coin tosses during the match, choosing tails in both, captain Pepe Ortiz decided to choose again tails, and Sporting became the winner of the game. In the final for remaining in the category, Sporting defeated Sevilla Atlético by 2–1.

===1970–1992: The golden years and &quot;EuroSporting&quot;===

In 1970, with the name of &quot;Sporting&quot; recovered, the club would start its consolidation in La Liga despite a relegation to Segunda División in 1975. This year would mean the start of the golden era of the club.

Just after promoting in 1976, Sporting Gijón started the 1977–78 season by accumulating eight matches without losses. Finally, the &quot;Rojiblancos&quot; finished in the fifth position qualifying for the first time to the UEFA Cup.

Players like Quini, Cundi, Enzo Ferrero or Antonio Maceda and others would make history in the 1978–79 club&#x27;s season, considered the best one in the history of the club. The season started with the first round of the UEFA Cup, where on 13 September 1978, Sporting beat Torino 3–0 at El Molinón. In the second round, Sporting was eliminated by Red Star Belgrade. The club finished the first half of La Liga leading the table, tied in points with Real Madrid, but a 0–1 loss to the &quot;Merengues&quot; completely ruined their title hopes.

In 1981, the club played for the first time the Cup Final. In the game played at Estadio Vicente Calderón on 18 June 1981, Sporting was defeated 1–3 by Barcelona. Former Sporting Gijón player Quini, considered as the most important player in the club&#x27;s history, scored two goals for the &quot;blaugranas&quot;. Sporting repeated success in 1982, but this time Real Madrid beat the &quot;rojiblancos&quot; 1–2. During the 1980s Sporting accumulated four more participations at UEFA Cup, but always was eliminated in the first round. On 16 September 1987, Sporting won the first leg game against Arrigo Sacchi&#x27;s AC Milan, but a 0–3 defeat in Italy cut off Sporting&#x27;s possibilities. In the previous 1986–87 season, Sporting beat Barcelona at Camp Nou by 0–4, the biggest win away in the club&#x27;s history in La Liga. One year before, Manuel Vega-Arango, president since 1977, left office.

The last UEFA Cup participation was during the 1991–92 season. Sporting Gijón eliminated Partizan after a penalty shootout, but failed to defeat Steaua București in the second round.

On 6 October 1992, Sporting Gijón played its 1,000th game in La Liga.

===1992–2008: Decline of the club===
In 1992, following the law, Real Sporting de Gijón became a Sociedad Anónima Deportiva. Its official name since that moment is &quot;Real Sporting de Gijón, S.A.D.&quot; The internal financial crisis and the departure of important players triggers the decline of the club, pushing it to the lower positions in La Liga. In the 1994–95 season, Sporting remained in La Liga thanks to winning the relegation playoffs against Lleida, but three years later, following a disastrous 1997–98 campaign where Sporting only earned 13 points (two wins and seven draws in 38 games), the club was relegated to Second Division, finishing its 21-year continuous stretch in La Liga.

Due to the financial crisis during the 2000s, the club was menaced by its possible dissolution and was forced to sell the Escuela de Fútbol de Mareo to the Municipal Town Hall for €12m in August 2001. The 2003–04 season started with several doubts after the transfer of David Villa to Zaragoza and the election of Marcelino García Toral as head coach, who previously relegated the reserve team to Tercera División. However, the club was close to promotion to La Liga, but failed to accomplish the goal, finishing in the fifth position. After accumulating €51m of debts in its worst years, Real Sporting was close to being administratively relegated at the end of the 2004–05 season.

===2008–2012: Return to La Liga with Manuel Preciado===

With Manuel Preciado at the helm of the team since 2006, the 2007–08 season started with the club unbeaten during the first nine games. Finally, on 15 June 2008, the club secured promotion back to La Liga after beating 2–0 Eibar in the last round.

In its first season after the return, the 2008–09, Sporting conceded 20 goals in its first five games, but achieved important wins like the one at Mestalla against Valencia by 3–2 or the 1–0 win against Sevilla. In a season where the team broke La Liga record of 29 consecutive games without any draw (a 1–1 finish with Athletic Bilbao on 3 May 2009), Sporting avoided relegation in the last round after a win by 2–1 against last qualified Recreativo de Huelva.

On 2 April 2011, they beat Real Madrid 1–0 at Santiago Bernabéu Stadium to end Real manager José Mourinho&#x27;s nine-year home league unbeaten run. This was the best season of the club since the last promotion, as it finished in the 10th position.

The 2011–12 season started without wins in the first eight games and the team remained in the relegation positions almost all the season. On 31 January 2012, after a 5–1 loss against Real Sociedad, Manolo Preciado was sacked. The Cantabrian coach ended his era after nearly six years in the club and being very appreciated by all the club supporters. Javier Clemente was hired for avoiding the relegation, but despite keeping the possibilities until the last round, failed and the club was condemned to a new relegation, that carried a new financial crisis in the club.

===2014–2022: &quot;Los guajes&quot; and a new decline===

On 4 May 2014, Abelardo Fernández was appointed as head coach after José Ramón Sandoval was sacked. In his first season, he could not win Gijón promotion to La Liga after being eliminated in the semi-finals of the play-offs by Las Palmas.

However, the manager extended his contract for two years. Sporting was not allowed to sign any player out from the reserve team during 2014–15 season due to the non-payments, but despite this disadvantage, Sporting once again returned to La Liga with a squad where 17 players played before in the reserve team or any of the youth teams of the club. After only two losses in all the season, Sporting promoted in the last round by beating 3–0 Real Betis at Benito Villamarín stadium and a late equaliser conceded by rival Girona in their separate match against CD Lugo, when Sporting&#x27;s game just finished.

During its comeback season, Sporting had the same sanction due to a delay in payments to the players during the previous season. The club was only allowed to sign, by loan, three new under-23 players without experience in La Liga (Antonio Sanabria from Roma, Alen Halilović from Barcelona and Omar Mascarell from Real Madrid).

The season started with a 0–0 draw against Real Madrid, managed by Rafa Benítez, at El Molinón. Despite an irregular path, Sporting obtained very important wins like a 1–0 at Mestalla, a 2–1 against Atlético Madrid or a 5–1 against Real Sociedad. After earning a 1–1 draw at Getafe, the club finally avoided relegation in the last round after beating Villarreal by 2–0 and taking advantage of the win of Real Betis against Getafe. The era of Abelardo ended in January 2017, when he left the club after earning only five points in 15 matches and, despite changing the manager, the club was finally relegated again to Segunda División.

In the successive years, Sporting remained in Segunda División, only playing the promotion play-offs in 2018. The club continued a decline until 2022, where it narrowly avoided relegation to the third division. Abelardo came back to ensure the place in Segunda in the latest four rounds.

===2022–present: Grupo Orlegi as new owners===
On 28 June 2022, majority shareholder Javier Fernández sold the club to Mexican group Orlegi Sports by €43m, thus becoming the second highest sale of a club in Spain. Alejandro Irarragorri became the first foreign President of the club.

After two first seasons narrowly avoiding relegation to the third division, in 2024 Sporting Gijón qualified again to the promotion play-offs to La Liga. However, it was eliminated in the first round against Espanyol.

==Club colours and crest==
Real Sporting de Gijón have worn red and white striped jerseys since their inception, being the first Spanish team to wear red and white, as both Athletic Bilbao and Atlético Madrid wore blue and white until 1909. The colors are those of the official flag of Gijón, which itself is based on the flag of the maritime province of Gijón, established in 1845. The color of the shorts alternated between blue and white, as in the first years there was not any officiality for its colors. In the 1910s, finally, the color blue was established as the color of the shorts of the first kit.

Currently, Sporting wears both blue shorts and socks but until the 1980s they were black. In the 1990s, Sporting wore white shorts and socks, until the supporters voted to come back to the traditional blue.

Like most old football clubs, Real Sporting de Gijón did not initially have any badge displayed on their shirts. Their first official badge was introduced in the 1920s. It consisted of a traditionally shaped shield split into three sections, representing the club and the city.

From 1931 to 1936, during the Spanish Second Republic, the badge consisted of a circular shield and had the royal crown in the top replaced by a mural crown.

The club&#x27;s badge is a triangle with red and white vertical stripes with &#x27;S&#x27; (for Sporting) and &#x27;G&#x27; (for Gijón) intertwined, in gold, across them. A crown in the top symbolizes the royal patronage.

===Flag===
The club&#x27;s official flag consists of nine equal horizontal stripes of red (top and bottom) alternating with white in a rectangular field in a 2:3 ratio. The club logo is displayed in the centre.

==Stadium==

El Molinón, with a capacity for 29,371 spectators, holds the games of Sporting de Gijón.

Despite existing since at least 1908, Sporting did not start to use it until 1915. Before this year, the club played its games in different zones of the city. Firstly at San Lorenzo beach and later in the pitches of Prau Redondu (near El Humedal), La Matona in Somió, that was rented by the club for three months by paying 100 pesetas, and La Flor de Valencia in La Guía.

In 2018, the stadium was renamed as &quot;El Molinón-Enrique Castro &quot;Quini&quot;&quot; after the death of the club&#x27;s all-time top scorer Quini.

==Academy==

The Escuela de Fútbol de Mareo is the training ground and academy base of Sporting de Gijón. It was opened on 28 March 1978 and it also has the club headquarters in it.

Located just 7 km away from the city center and covering 112,000 m2, it is used for training and youth teams matches. At present, facilities include inter alia, eight pitches, one service building (including team catering areas), a gymnasium, and a medical centre. The main pitch, where Sporting de Gijón B plays its games, is called &quot;Campo Pepe Ortiz&quot; and has a capacity for 3,000 people.

Mareo is a very prolific &quot;cantera&quot;, where several international football players grown being widely famous like Eloy, Ablanedo, Luis Enrique, Abelardo, Manjarín, Juanele or David Villa, World Champion in 2010 with the Spain national team.

In addition to Mareo, Sporting Gijón has a second academy located in Logroño, also called &quot;Mareo&quot;.

==Supporters==

Sporting de Gijón supporters commonly call themselves &quot;Sportinguistas&quot; in order to show their dedication to the club. &quot;Sportinguistas&quot; are widely regarded as one of the most loyal, best travelling, and most cheerful supporter groups in La Liga, providing one of the best atmospheres in the competition. When following their team in large groups through the country, they are referred to as &quot;La Mareona&quot;, Spanish for &quot;The Big Tide&quot;, composed mainly by 240 groups of supporters or &quot;peñas&quot;.

About 300,000 fans showed up when Sporting&#x27;s promotion was celebrated in June 2008.

Sporting finished the 2015–16 season with 23,400 season tickets; this record would be beaten in August 2016, when the club reached the 24,078 tickets sold, and again in the 2017–18 season, with 24,402 season tickets despite suffering a relegation in the previous season.

<text>Albacete Balompié is a Spanish football team based in Albacete, in the autonomous community of Castile–La Mancha. Founded on 5 July 1939, it currently plays in Segunda División, the second tier of Spanish football, holding home matches at &quot;Estadio Carlos Belmonte&quot;, with a capacity of 17,524.

==History==

This team is from Albacete a city in Castilla-La Mancha. After years of amateur and regional development of football, it would not appear formally until the end of the Spanish Civil War. The club was founded in 1939 under the name Albacete Foot-ball Association, being later changed in an attempt to make it sound &quot;more Spanish&quot;. At the second division in 1985–86, repeating the feat five seasons later.

In 1989, Benito Floro consecutively promoted the club from the third division to La Liga, overachieving for a seventh place in the first season in the top level. Floro would later coach Real Madrid, returning to &quot;Alba&quot; two seasons later as the club was relegated in 1995–96.

After years in the second division facing serious economic and sporting difficulties, Albacete returned to the top flight in the 2002–03 campaign, led by César Ferrando (later of Atlético Madrid). However, Albacete dropped in 2004–05 after posting just 6 wins from 38 matches, going on to stabilize in the subsequent seasons in the second level.

The 2010–11 season brought two coaching changes, with both Antonio Calderón and David Vidal (who returned to the club only a few months after leaving) being fired, as Albacete returned to the third division after 21 years. That season the club finished last in Segunda División with only 32 points in 42 matches. On 6 December 2011, Andrés Iniesta – who played for the club in his youth before joining Barcelona – became the club&#x27;s major shareholder, donating €420,000 to the cash-strapped club. The club managed to reach the round of 16 of the 2011–12 Copa del Rey, notably beating Atlético Madrid 3–1 on aggregate.

In March 2013, Agustín Lázaro, chief executive officer (CEO) of Andrés Iniesta&#x27;s winery enterprise, was appointed as Albacete&#x27;s chairman. In June, Iniesta loaned the club a further €240,000 to cover unpaid wages, thus preventing its administrative relegation to the fourth tier.

In 2014, Albacete returned to the Segunda División, but was relegated two seasons later after finishing the season in the 21st position. The club again returned to the Segunda División in the 2016–17 season after winning against Valencia Mestalla in the last round of the promotion play-offs. Albacete finished the 2018–19 season in 4th position of the Segunda División, but then lost to RCD Mallorca in the La Liga play-offs and remained in Segunda División for the 2019–20 season. On next season, Albacete finished last in second division and were relegated to the third division. Thus ending their four-years stay in the second division.

Albacete were promoted to Segunda in the 2021–22 Primera RFEF season playoffs, after defeating Deportivo de La Coruña at the Estadio Riazor. The team came back from a 1–0 deficit, winning 2-1 with a goal in extra time.

<text>The Kronia () was an Athenian festival held in honor of Kronos (Cronus) on the 12th day of Hekatombaion, the first month of the Attic calendar, and roughly equivalent to the latter part of July and first part of August.

The festival was also celebrated in parts of Ionia, and in these places the month was called &quot;Kronion&quot;, named after the festival. Scholars usually interpret it as a celebration of the mid-summer (first) harvest. Its Roman equivalent is Saturnalia.

== Details from ancient sources==
The Roman playwright Accius says that to celebrate the &quot;Kronia&quot;, &quot;In nearly all fields and towns they happily feast upon banquets, and everyone waits upon his own servants.&quot; Slaves and the free, rich and poor, all dined together and played games.

The freedom from work and social egalitarianism enjoyed on the day represented the conditions of the mythical Golden Age, when Kronos (Cronus) still ruled the world. In the Golden Age, the earth had spontaneously supported human life, and since labor was unneeded, slavery had not existed. William Hansen describes the Golden Age of Kronos as &quot;a period of thorough harmony in which hierarchical, exploitative, and predatory relationships were nonexistent.&quot;

The &quot;Kronia&quot; was a time for social restraints to be temporarily forgotten. Slaves were released from their duties, and participated in the festivities alongside the slave-owners. Slaves were &quot;&quot;permitted to run riot through the city, shouting and making a noise&quot;.&quot; Other than the &quot;Kronia&quot;, there is only limited evidence of religious devotion to Kronos (Cronus).

<text>Giovanni Gabrieli (/1557 – 12 August 1612) was an Italian composer and organist. He was one of the most influential musicians of his time, and represents the culmination of the style of the Venetian School, at the time of the shift from Renaissance to Baroque idioms.

==Biography==
Gabrieli was born in Venice. He was one of five children, and his father came from the region of Carnia and went to Venice shortly before Giovanni&#x27;s birth. While not much is known about Giovanni&#x27;s early life, he probably studied with his uncle, the composer Andrea Gabrieli, who was employed at St Mark&#x27;s Basilica from the 1560s until his death in 1585. Giovanni may indeed have been brought up by his uncle, as is implied by the dedication to his 1587 book of concerti, in which he described himself as &quot;little less than a son&quot; to his uncle.

Giovanni also went to Munich to study with the renowned Orlando de Lassus at the court of Duke Albert V; most likely he stayed there until about 1579. Lassus was to be one of the principal influences on the development of his musical style.

By 1584 he had returned to Venice, where he became principal organist at St Mark&#x27;s Basilica in 1585, after Claudio Merulo left the post; following his uncle&#x27;s death the following year he took the post of principal composer as well. Also after his uncle&#x27;s death, he began editing much of the older man&#x27;s music, which would otherwise have been lost; Andrea evidently had had little inclination to publish his own music, but Giovanni&#x27;s opinion of it was sufficiently high that he devoted much of his own time to compiling and editing it for publication.

Gabrieli&#x27;s career rose further when he took the additional post of organist at the Scuola Grande di San Rocco, another post he retained for his entire life. San Rocco was the most prestigious and wealthy of all the Venetian confraternities, and second only to San Marco itself in the splendour of its musical establishment. Some of the most renowned singers and instrumentalists in Italy performed there and a vivid description of its musical activity survives in the travel memoirs of the English writer Thomas Coryat. Much of his music was written specifically for that location, although he probably composed even more for San Marco.

San Marco had a long tradition of musical excellence and Gabrieli&#x27;s work there made him one of the most noted composers in Europe. The vogue that began with his influential volume &quot;Sacrae symphoniae&quot; (1597) was such that composers from all over Europe, especially from Germany, came to Venice to study. Evidently, he also instructed his new pupils to study the madrigals being written in Italy, so not only did they carry back the grand Venetian polychoral style to their home countries, but also the more intimate style of madrigals; Heinrich Schütz and others helped transport the transitional early Baroque music north to Germany, a trend that decisively affected subsequent music history. The productions of the German Baroque, culminating in the music of J.S. Bach, were founded on this strong tradition, which had its roots in Venice.

Gabrieli was increasingly ill after about 1606, at which time church authorities began to appoint deputies to take over duties he could no longer perform. He died in 1612 in Venice, of complications from a kidney stone.

==Music and style==

Though Gabrieli composed in many of the forms current at the time, he preferred sacred vocal and instrumental music. All of his secular vocal music was relatively early in his career; he never wrote lighter forms, such as dances; and later he concentrated on sacred vocal and instrumental music that exploited sonority for maximum effect. Among the innovations credited to him – and while he was not always the first to use them, he was the most famous of his period to do so – were dynamics; specifically notated instrumentation (as in the famous &quot;Sonata pian&#x27; e forte&quot;); and massive forces arrayed in multiple, spatially separated groups, an idea which was to be the genesis of the Baroque concertato style, and which spread quickly to northern Europe, both by the report of visitors to Venice and by Gabrieli&#x27;s students, who included Hans Leo Hassler and Heinrich Schütz.

Like composers before and after him, he would use the unusual layout of the San Marco church, with its two choir lofts facing each other, to create striking spatial effects. Most of his pieces are written so that a choir or instrumental group will first be heard on one side, followed by a response from the musicians on the other side; often there was a third group situated on a stage near the main altar in the centre of the church. While this polychoral style had been extant for decades (Adrian Willaert may have made use of it first, at least in Venice), Gabrieli pioneered the use of carefully specified groups of instruments and singers, with precise directions for instrumentation, and in more than two groups. The acoustics were and are such in the church that instruments, correctly positioned, could be heard with perfect clarity at distant points. Thus instrumentation which looks strange on paper, for instance, a single string player set against a large group of brass instruments, can be made to sound, in San Marco, in perfect balance. A fine example of these techniques can be seen in the scoring of In Ecclesiis.

Gabrieli&#x27;s first motets were published alongside his uncle Andrea&#x27;s compositions in his 1587 volume of &quot;Concerti&quot;. These pieces show much influence of his uncle&#x27;s style in the use of dialogue and echo effects. There are low and high choirs and the difference between their pitches is marked by the use of instrumental accompaniment. The motets published in Giovanni&#x27;s 1597 &quot;Sacrae Symphoniae&quot; seem to move away from this technique of close antiphony towards a model in which musical material is not simply echoed, but developed by successive choral entries. Some motets, such as &quot;Omnes Gentes&quot; developed the model almost to its limits. In these motets, instruments are an integral part of the performance, and only the choirs marked &quot;Capella&quot; are to be performed by singers for each part.

There seems to be a distinct change in Gabrieli&#x27;s style after 1605, the year of publication of Monteverdi&#x27;s &quot;Quinto libro di madrigali&quot;, and Gabrieli&#x27;s compositions are in a much more homophonic style as a result. There are sections purely for instruments – called &quot;Sinfonia&quot; – and small sections for soloists singing florid lines, accompanied simply by a basso continuo. &quot;Alleluia&quot; refrains provide refrains within the structure, forming rondo patterns in the motets, with close dialogue between choirs and soloists. In particular, one of his best-known pieces, &quot;In Ecclesiis&quot;, is a showcase of such polychoral techniques, making use of four separate groups of instrumental and singing performers, underpinned by the omnipresent organ and continuo.

<text>Jeffrey Kent Eugenides (born March 8, 1960) is an American author. He has written numerous short stories and essays, as well as three novels: &quot;The Virgin Suicides&quot; (1993), &quot;Middlesex&quot; (2002), and &quot;The Marriage Plot&quot; (2011). &quot;The Virgin Suicides&quot; served as the basis of the 1999 film of the same name, while &quot;Middlesex&quot; received the 2003 Pulitzer Prize for Fiction in addition to being a finalist for the National Book Critics Circle Award, the International Dublin Literary Award, and France&#x27;s Prix Médicis.

==Biography==
Jeffrey Kent Eugenides was born in Detroit on March 8, 1960. He is of Greek descent through his father and English and Irish descent through his mother. He has two older brothers. He attended Grosse Pointe&#x27;s private University Liggett School and then Brown University (where he became friends with contemporary Rick Moody). He graduated from Brown in 1982 after taking a year off to travel across Europe, during which time he also volunteered with Mother Teresa in Calcutta. Of his decision to study at Brown, he said, &quot;I chose Brown largely in order to study with John Hawkes, whose work I admired. I entered the honors program in English, which forced me to study the entire English tradition, beginning with &quot;Beowulf&quot;. I felt that since I was going to try to add to the tradition, I had better know something about it.&quot; In 1986, he earned an M.A. in English and Creative Writing from Stanford University. Eugenides knew he wanted to be a writer from a relatively early age, stating, &quot;I decided very early; during my junior year of high school. We read &quot;A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man&quot; that year, and it had a big effect on me, for reasons that seem quite amusing to me now. I&#x27;m half Irish and half Greek—my mother&#x27;s family were Kentuckians, Southern hillbillies, and my paternal grandparents immigrants from Asia Minor—and, for that reason, I identified with Stephen Dedalus. Like me, he was bookish, good at academics, and possessed an &#x27;absurd name, an ancient Greek&#x27;. [...] I do remember thinking [...] that to be a writer was the best thing a person could be. It seemed to promise maximum alertness to life. It seemed holy to me, and almost religious.&quot; Of his earliest literary influences, he cited &quot;the great modernists. Joyce, Proust, Faulkner. From these I went on to discover Musil, Woolf, and others, and soon my friends and I were reading Pynchon and John Barth. My generation grew up backward. We were weaned on experimental writing before ever reading much of the nineteenth-century literature the modernists and postmodernists were reacting against.&quot;

Eugenides was raised in Detroit and cites the influence of the city and his high school experiences on his writings. He has said that he has &quot;a perverse love&quot; of his birthplace: &quot;I think most of the major elements of American history are exemplified in Detroit, from the triumph of the automobile and the assembly line to the blight of racism, not to mention the music, Motown, the MC5, house, techno.&quot; He also says he has been &quot;haunted&quot; by the decline of Detroit. In 1983, after graduating from Brown, he moved to San Francisco with the intention of becoming a writer and lived on Haight Street.

In 1986, he received the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences Nicholl Fellowship for his story &quot;Here Comes Winston, Full of the Holy Spirit.&quot; After living a few years in San Francisco, he moved to Brooklyn, New York and worked as secretary for the Academy of American Poets. While in New York he made friends with numerous similarly struggling writers, including Jonathan Franzen.

From 1999 to 2004, Eugenides lived in Berlin, where he moved after being awarded a grant from the German Academic Exchange Service to write in Berlin for a year. Since 2007, he has lived in Princeton, New Jersey, where he moved after he joined the faculty of Princeton University&#x27;s Program in Creative Writing.

Of teaching creative writing, Eugenides remarked in an interview with &quot;The Paris Review&quot;, &quot;I tell my students that when you write, you should pretend you&#x27;re writing the best letter you ever wrote to the smartest friend you have. That way, you&#x27;ll never dumb things down. You won&#x27;t have to explain things that don&#x27;t need explaining. You&#x27;ll assume an intimacy and a natural shorthand, which is good because readers are smart and don&#x27;t wish to be condescended to. I think about the reader. I care about the reader. Not &#x27;audience.&#x27; Not &#x27;readership.&#x27; Just the reader.&quot;

In 2018, Eugenides joined New York University&#x27;s Creative Writing Program as a tenured full professor and the Lewis and Loretta Glucksman Professor in American Letters.

Eugenides met his former wife, photographer and sculptor Karen Yamauchi, at the MacDowell artist&#x27;s program. They got married in 1995 and later had a daughter named Georgia Eugenides.

After being raised in a nominally Greek Orthodox household, in 2022 Eugenides was received into the Catholic Church with his wife Marlene Morgan at the Church of St. Joseph in Greenwich Village, which they attend with his second daughter Helen. 

==Career==

===&quot;The Virgin Suicides&quot;===

Eugenides&#x27; 1993 novel, &quot;The Virgin Suicides&quot;, has been translated into 34 languages. In 1999, the novel was adapted into a critically acclaimed film directed by Sofia Coppola. Set in Grosse Pointe, Michigan, the novel follows the lives and deaths by suicide of five sisters over the course of an increasingly isolated year, as told from the point of view of the neighborhood boys who obsessively watch them.

===1996–2001===
Eugenides published short stories in the nine years between &quot;The Virgin Suicides&quot; and &quot;Middlesex&quot;, primarily in &quot;The New Yorker&quot;. His 1996 story &quot;Baster&quot; became the basis for the 2010 romantic comedy &quot;The Switch. Eugenides&quot; temporarily put &quot;Middlesex&quot; aside in the late &#x27;90s to begin work on a novel that would eventually serve as the basis for his third. Two excerpts of what became Eugenides&#x27;s work-in-progress third novel after &quot;Middlesex&quot; also appeared in &quot;The New Yorker&quot; in 2011, &quot;Asleep in the Lord&quot; and &quot;Extreme Solitude.&quot; Eugenides also served as the editor of the collection of short stories titled &quot;My Mistress&#x27;s Sparrow Is Dead&quot;. The proceeds of the collection go to the writing center 826 Chicago, established to encourage young people&#x27;s writing.

===&quot;Middlesex&quot;===

His 2002 novel, &quot;Middlesex&quot;, won the 2003 Pulitzer Prize for Fiction in addition to being a finalist for the National Book Critics Circle Award, the International Dublin Literary Award, and France&#x27;s Prix Médicis. Following the life and self-discovery of Calliope Stephanides, or later, Cal, an intersex person raised a girl, but genetically male, &quot;Middlesex&quot; also broadly deals with the Greek American immigrant experience in the United States, the rise and fall of Detroit, and explores the experience of an intersex person in the United States.

===&quot;The Marriage Plot&quot;===

After a nine-year hiatus, Eugenides published his third novel, &quot;The Marriage Plot&quot;, in October 2011. The novel follows three young adults enmeshed in a love triangle, as they graduate from Brown University and establish themselves in the world. Eugenides is currently at work developing a television screenplay of the novel, which was a finalist of the National Book Critics Circle Award for fiction in 2011; a &quot;New York Times&quot; notable book for 2011; and one of the top books of the year according to lists made by &quot;Publishers Weekly&quot;, &quot;Kirkus Reviews&quot;, and &quot;The Telegraph&quot;.

===&quot;Fresh Complaint&quot; and fourth novel===

In 2017, Eugenides published &quot;Fresh Complaint&quot;, a collection of short stories written between 1988 and 2017. He described the work as &quot;a very mixed bag of stories, quite different, not all arranged around a certain theme&quot;.

He has suggested that a fourth novel will be published at an unspecified future date: &quot;I have an idea; I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s going to work. But it&#x27;s going to be a larger canvas, many more characters than in [&quot;The Marriage Plot&quot;]. Again, I&#x27;m going to respond to a very small directive. It&#x27;s going to be written, well, I&#x27;m not going to say — but I know how it&#x27;s going to be written and what the structure&#x27;s going to be, and it&#x27;s going to be quite different than &quot;The Marriage Plot.&quot;&quot;

<doc id="79956" wikidata="Q14280" url="?curid=79956" title="Giuseppe Piazzi">
<text>Giuseppe Piazzi ( , ; 16 July 1746 – 22 July 1826) was an Italian Catholic priest of the Theatine order, mathematician, and astronomer. He established an observatory at Palermo, now the &quot;Osservatorio Astronomico di Palermo – Giuseppe S. Vaiana&quot;. He is perhaps most famous for his discovery of the first dwarf planet, Ceres.

== Early life ==

No documented account of Piazzi&#x27;s scientific education exists in any of the astronomer’s biographies, even the earliest ones. However, it is certain that Piazzi pursued studies in Turin, likely attending lessons by Giovan Battista Beccaria. Between 1768 and 1770, he resided at the Theatines&#x27; Home in Sant&#x27;Andrea della Valle, Rome, where he studied mathematics under François Jacquier.

In July 1770, Piazzi was appointed to the chair of Mathematics at the University of Malta. In December 1773, he moved to Ravenna, where he served as &quot;prefetto degli studenti&quot; and as a lecturer in Philosophy and Mathematics at the Collegio dei Nobili, a position he held until early 1779. After brief periods in Cremona and Rome, Piazzi relocated to Palermo in March 1781, taking up a role as lecturer in Mathematics at the University of Palermo (then known as the &quot;Accademia de&#x27; Regj Studi&quot;)

He kept this position until 19 January 1787, when he became Professor of Astronomy. Almost at the same time, he was granted permission to spend two years in Paris and London, to undergo some practical training in astronomy and also to get some instruments to be specially built for the Palermo Observatory, whose foundation he was in charge of.

In the period spent abroad, from 13 March 1787 until the end of 1789, Piazzi became acquainted with the major French and English astronomers of his time and was able to have the famous altazimuthal circle made by Jesse Ramsden, one of the most skilled instrument-makers of the 18th century. 
The circle was the most important instrument of the Palermo Observatory, whose official foundation took place on 1 July 1790.

In 1817, King Ferdinand put Piazzi in charge of the completion of the Capodimonte (Naples) Observatory, naming him General Director of the Naples and Sicily Observatories.

==Astronomy career==

===Star cataloguing===

He supervised the compilation of the Palermo Catalogue of stars, containing 7,646 star entries with unprecedented precision, including the star names &quot;Garnet Star&quot; from Herschel, and the original Rotanev and Sualocin. The work to observe the sky methodically. The catalogue wasn&#x27;t finished for first edition publication until 1803, with a second edition in 1814.

Spurred by the success discovering Ceres (see below), and in the line of his catalogue program, Piazzi studied the proper motions of stars to find parallax measurement candidates. One of them, 61 Cygni, was specially appointed as a good candidate for measuring a parallax, which was later performed by Friedrich Wilhelm Bessel. The star system 61 Cygni is sometimes still called variously &quot;Piazzi&#x27;s Flying Star&quot; and &quot;Bessel&#x27;s Star&quot;.

===The dwarf planet Ceres===

Piazzi discovered Ceres. On 1 January 1801 Piazzi discovered a &quot;stellar object&quot; that moved against the background of stars. At first he thought it was a fixed star, but once he noticed that it moved, he became convinced it was a planet, or as he called it, &quot;a new star&quot;.

In his journal, he wrote: 

In spite of his assumption that it was a planet, he took the conservative route and announced it as a comet. In a letter to astronomer Barnaba Oriani of Milan he made his suspicions known in writing:

He was not able to observe it long enough as it was soon lost in the glare of the Sun. Unable to compute its orbit with existing methods, the mathematician Carl Friedrich Gauss developed a new method of orbit calculation that allowed astronomers to locate it again. After its orbit was better determined, it was clear that Piazzi&#x27;s assumption was correct and this object was not a comet but more like a small planet. Coincidentally, it was also almost exactly where the Titius–Bode law predicted a planet would be.

Piazzi named it &quot;Ceres Ferdinandea,&quot; after the Roman and Sicilian goddess of grain and King Ferdinand IV of Naples and Sicily. The Ferdinandea part was later dropped for political reasons. Ceres turned out to be the first, and largest, of the asteroids existing within the asteroid belt. Ceres is today called a dwarf planet.

==Posthumous honours==

Born in Italy and named in his honour was the astronomer Charles Piazzi Smyth, son of the astronomer William Henry Smyth. In 1871, a memorial statue of Piazzi sculpted by Costantino Corti was dedicated in the main plaza of his birthplace, Ponte. In 1923, the 1000th asteroid to be numbered was named 1000 Piazzia in his honour. The lunar crater &quot;Piazzi&quot; was named after him in 1935. More recently, a large albedo feature, probably a crater, imaged by the Hubble Space Telescope on Ceres, has been informally named &quot;Piazzi&quot;.

Faure was the author of many poems, novels and essays. An Italophile, he wrote many books about Italy, including Venice, Ventimiglia and Rome. In 1929, he edited a book about Italy entitled &quot;Le Visage de l&#x27;Italie&quot; prefaced by Benito Mussolini. The book received a good review in &quot;The Journal of Roman Studies&quot;. Additionally, Faure was the founder of the Comité France-Italie.

Moreover, Faure wrote several books about French authors François-René de Chateaubriand, Jean-Jacques Rousseau, Stendhal, Paul Valéry and Louis Le Cardonnel. He co-authored a book about Napoleon with Marcel Deléon.

Faure won five prizes from the Académie française: the Prix Montyon for &quot;Heures d&#x27;Ombrie&quot; in 1908; the Prix Jules Davaine for &quot;Sur la vie Emilia&quot; in 1911; the Prix Marcelin Guérin for &quot;Paysages littéraires&quot; in 1918; the Prix Alfred Née in 1930; and the Grand Prix de Littérature for the entirety of his work in 1941.

He wrote in Italy some wrote, in particular he stayed several times in Breganze (Vicenza - Italy) guested to Marie Jsoard Savardo in &#x27;Villa Savardo&#x27;. There are some post cards he sent in 1924 and 1928 from Breganze to France.

==Death and legacy==
Faure died on 5 August 1962. The &quot;Lycée Gabriel Faure&quot; in Tournon was named in his honor.

<text>Route 59 is the shortest state highway in New Jersey, United States, at long. The route consists entirely of a short block of Lincoln Avenue from Union County Route 610 (known locally as South Avenue) in Cranford to New Jersey Route 28 (known locally as North Avenue) along the Cranford–Garwood border. The route functions as an underpass under the Raritan Valley Line of NJ Transit, under which it crosses about halfway down the block, along the municipal border. Route 59 was originally a proposed alignment of Route 22, which was supposed to head from an intersection with current day New Jersey Route 159 in Morris County at the Pine Brook Bridge before heading through several counties, terminating at an intersection with New Jersey Route 27 in Rahway. Most of the route was not constructed, and a portion in Garwood and Cranford was re-designated Route 59 in the 1953 New Jersey state highway renumbering on January 1, 1953.

==Route description==

Route 59 begins at a four-way intersection with Union County Route 610 (CR 610; South Avenue) in the community of Cranford. Route 59 heads northwestward, passing a couple of businesses in both directions. The route crosses under the NJ Transit-owned Raritan Valley Line at which point the border of Cranford and Garwood runs along the center of the road. The route continues to the northwest, passing businesses before ending at a signalized T-intersection with Route 28 (North Avenue). The pavement ends at the intersection through a state-constructed bridge carrying the intersection over a small creek is angled such that a road could continue northwest. Throughout the entire length of the route, it is four lanes wide (two in each direction).

==History==
The alignment of Route 59 was designated as part of the proposed State Highway Route 22 in the 1927 renumbering, which was proposed to run from the Pine Brook Bridge over the Passaic River at State Highway Route 6 in Fairfield Township. (This intersection is where New Jersey Route 159 currently crosses the bridge.) The route was to continue through parts of Morris, Essex and Union counties, including intersections with State Highway Route 10 at Livingston, U.S. Route 22 (also State Highway Route 29) at Mountainside, State Highway Route 28 at Garwood (where Routes 28 and 59 currently meet), and terminate in the community of Rahway at State Highway Route 27. Most of this route was not constructed, except a portion from State Highway Route 28 (North Avenue) in Cranford to South Avenue in Garwood. This portion was renumbered as Route 59 in the 1953 New Jersey state highway renumbering on January 1, 1953 so as not to duplicate U.S. Route 22.

<doc id="79969" wikidata="Q692045" url="?curid=79969" title="Enlightenment (window manager)">
<text>Enlightenment, also known simply as E, is a compositing window manager for the X Window System. Since version 0.20, Enlightenment also supports Wayland. It is shipped with some Linux distributions such as Bodhi Linux and Pentoo. 

Enlightenment is only a window manager at its core; however, with many modules included, it can be extended to resemble a full desktop environment. Since version 0.17 (E17), Enlightenment has been written with the Enlightenment Foundation Libraries (EFL), and the Enlightenment project also writes a set of applications with the EFL.

== History ==

=== E16 and before ===
The first version of Enlightenment was released by Carsten Haitzler in 1997. Originally, it was just a window manager before the addition of the EFL in E17.

With the release of E17 written with the EFL in 2012, Enlightenment went through a major rewrite, splitting the codebase into 0.16 (E16) and the versions after (E17). Some of the community decided to stay with the E16 codebase and continue development of this version, releasing under an independent versioning scheme from E17. It reached the 1.0 milestone and is still actively developed as of 2024.

=== E17 and later ===
In 2000, the development of the Enlightenment Foundation Libraries started to create a toolkit for writing applications that interoperate with Enlightenment, as well as other X window managers, too. As the EFL was built up, Enlightenment was rewritten to utilize the EFL, and in 2012 version 0.17.0 was released. As this version was completely rewritten to use the EFL, it is incompatible with E16.

The current version as of January 2025 is E27.

== Usage ==
Bodhi Linux was built around the Enlightenment 17 desktop, but forked it to create the Moksha desktop.

Elive Linux also used a fork of E17 as its main desktop environment until 2019, when the 3.7 series was released. It also features E16 and has future plans to integrate the new E26 version.

== Reception ==
A 2011 review of E16 found it was highly customisable, featuring per-window configurability, support for virtual desktops with much larger screenspace than monitor size, and that &quot;nearly everything can be done with the keyboard.&quot; While the appearance was praised, the desktop environment was criticised as being somewhat unstable due to bugs at the time. While E16 could be used as a window manager for GNOME or KDE, the review found they had poor compatibility.

A 2014 review of E17 found the design to be fast, touchscreen friendly and have a nice appearance, but was annoyed by the small selection area to resize windows. The appearance of the default terminal with the desktop environment, called &quot;Terminology,&quot; was also praised and the author personally liked the desktop left and right click menus.

A 2017 review found E18 to have lightweight performance, remarking a similar appearance to Mac OS, but also mentioning a steep learning curve due to the desktop left and right click menus.

A 2020 review praised Enlightenment for its high number of keyboard shortcuts, and that it was lightweight enough to run well on older hardware, with low idle CPU and RAM usage. However, it criticised the desktop left and right click menus for having too much complexity.

<text>IceWM is a stacking window manager for the X Window System, originally written by Marko Maček. It was written from scratch in C++ and is released under the terms of the GNU Lesser General Public License. It is customizable, relatively lightweight in terms of memory and CPU usage, and comes with themes that allow it to imitate the GUI of Windows 95, Windows XP, Windows 7, OS/2, Motif, and other graphical user interfaces.

IceWM can be configured from plain text files stored in a user&#x27;s home directory, making it easy to customize and copy settings. IceWM has an optional, built-in taskbar with a dynamic start menu, tasks display, system tray, network and CPU meters, mail check and configurable clock. It features a task list window and an Alt+Tab task switcher. Official support for GNOME and KDE menus used to be available as a separate package. In recent IceWM versions, support for them is built-in as well. External graphical programs for editing the configuration and the menu are also available.

==Usage==

IceWM is installed as the default window manager for Absolute Linux, AntiX and Legacy OS.

The Easy mode default desktop of the Asus Eee PC uses IceWM. 

openSUSE for Raspberry Pi uses IceWM by default as a lightweight GUI. The Raspberry Pi 3 only version of SUSE Linux Enterprise Server also uses IceWM.

<text>Pelvic lipomatosis is a rare disease that is most often seen in older obese black men with hypertension. In pelvic lipomatosis, abnormally dense deposits of otherwise apparently normal fat may be observed in the spaces of the pelvic area. It is associated with cystitis glandularis, a precursor to adenocarcinoma of the urinary bladder. It is associated with deposition of mature unencapsulated fat in the retroperitoneal pelvic space producing the typical &quot;pear-shaped&quot; appearance of the bladder on CT scan. This condition also causes a straightening and tubular appearance of the rectum.

<doc id="79982" wikidata="Q12382" url="?curid=79982" title="Shigeru Miyamoto">
<text>is a Japanese video game designer, producer and game director at Nintendo, where he has served as one of its representative directors as an executive since 2002. Widely regarded as one of the most accomplished and influential designers in video games, he is the creator of some of the most acclaimed and best-selling game franchises of all time, including &quot;Mario,&quot; &quot;The Legend of Zelda&quot;, &quot;Donkey Kong&quot;, &quot;Star Fox&quot; and &quot;Pikmin&quot;. More than 1 billion copies of games featuring franchises created by Miyamoto have been sold.

Born in Sonobe, Kyoto, Miyamoto graduated from Kanazawa Municipal College of Industrial Arts. He originally sought a career as a manga artist, until developing an interest in video games. With the help of his father, he joined Nintendo in 1977 after impressing the president, Hiroshi Yamauchi, with his toys. He helped create art for the arcade game &quot;Sheriff&quot;, and was later tasked with designing a new arcade game, leading to the 1981 game &quot;Donkey Kong&quot;.

Miyamoto&#x27;s games &quot;Super Mario Bros.&quot; (1985) and &quot;The Legend of Zelda&quot; (1986) helped the Nintendo Entertainment System dominate the console game market. His games have been flagships of every Nintendo video game console, from the arcade machines of the late 1970s to the present day. He managed Nintendo&#x27;s Entertainment Analysis &amp; Development software division, which developed many Nintendo games, and he played an important role in the creation of other influential games such as &quot;Pokémon Red&quot; and &quot;Blue&quot; (1996) and &quot;Metroid Prime&quot; (2002). Following the death of Nintendo president Satoru Iwata in July 2015, Miyamoto became acting president alongside Genyo Takeda until he was formally appointed &quot;Creative Fellow&quot; a few months later.

==Early life==

Miyamoto was born on November 16, 1952, in the Japanese town of Sonobe, Kyoto Prefecture. His parents were of &quot;modest means&quot;, and his father taught English.

From an early age, Miyamoto explored the natural areas around his home. He discovered a cave, and, after days of hesitation, went inside. His expeditions into the Kyoto countryside inspired his later work, particularly &quot;The Legend of Zelda&quot;, a seminal video game.

In the early 1970s, Miyamoto graduated from Kanazawa Municipal College of Industrial Arts with a degree in industrial design. He had a love for manga and initially hoped to become a professional manga artist before considering a career in video games. He was influenced by manga&#x27;s classic &quot;kishōtenketsu&quot; narrative structure, as well as Western genre television shows. He was inspired to enter the video game industry by the 1978 arcade hit &quot;Space Invaders&quot;.

==Career==
===1977–1984: Arcade beginnings and &quot;Donkey Kong&quot;===

In the 1970s, Nintendo was a relatively small Japanese company that sold playing cards and other novelties, although it had started to branch out into toys and games in the 1960s. Through a mutual friend, Miyamoto&#x27;s father arranged an interview with Nintendo president Hiroshi Yamauchi. After showing some of his toy creations, he was hired in 1977 as an apprentice in the planning department.

Miyamoto helped create the art for the coin-operated arcade game, &quot;Sheriff&quot;. He first helped the company develop a game after the 1980 release &quot;Radar Scope&quot;. The game achieved moderate success in Japan, but by 1981, Nintendo&#x27;s efforts to break it into the North American video game market had failed, leaving them with a large number of unsold units and on the verge of financial collapse. Nintendo president Hiroshi Yamauchi decided to convert unsold &quot;Radar Scope&quot; units into a new arcade game. He tasked Miyamoto with the conversion, about which Miyamoto has said self-deprecatingly that &quot;no one else was available&quot; to do the work. Nintendo&#x27;s head engineer, Gunpei Yokoi, supervised the project.

Miyamoto imagined many characters and plot concepts, but eventually settled on a love triangle between a gorilla, a carpenter, and a woman. He meant to mirror the rivalry between comic characters Bluto and Popeye for the woman Olive Oyl, although Nintendo&#x27;s original intentions to gain rights to &quot;Popeye&quot; failed. Bluto evolved into an ape, a form Miyamoto claimed was &quot;nothing too evil or repulsive&quot;. This ape would be the pet of the main character, &quot;a funny, hang-loose kind of guy&quot;. Miyamoto also named &quot;Beauty and the Beast&quot; and the 1933 film &quot;King Kong&quot; as influences. Miyamoto had high hopes for his new project, but lacked the technical skills to program it himself; instead, he conceived the game&#x27;s concepts, then consulted technicians on whether they were possible. He wanted to make the characters different sizes, move in different manners, and react in various ways. However, Yokoi viewed Miyamoto&#x27;s original design as too complex. Yokoi suggested using see-saws to catapult the hero across the screen but this proved too difficult to program. Miyamoto next thought of using sloped platforms and ladders for travel, with barrels for obstacles. When he asked that the game have multiple stages, the four-man programming team complained that he was essentially asking them to make the game repeat, but the team eventually successfully programmed the game. When the game was sent to Nintendo of America for testing, the sales manager disapproved of its vast differentiation from the maze and shooter games common at the time. When American staffers began naming the characters, they settled on &quot;Pauline&quot; for the woman, after Polly James, wife of Nintendo&#x27;s Redmond, Washington, warehouse manager, Don James. The playable character, initially &quot;Jumpman&quot;, was eventually named for Mario Segale, the warehouse landlord. These character names were printed on the American cabinet art and used in promotional materials. The staff also pushed for an English name, and thus it received the title &quot;Donkey Kong&quot;.

&quot;Donkey Kong&quot; was a success, leading Miyamoto to work on sequels such as &quot;Donkey Kong Jr.&quot; in 1982, and &quot;Donkey Kong 3&quot; in 1983. In January 1983, the 1982 Arcade Awards gave Donkey Kong the Best Single-player video game award and the Certificate of Merit as runner-up for Coin-Op Game of the Year. In his next game, he gave Mario a brother: Luigi. He named the new game &quot;Mario Bros.&quot; Yokoi convinced Miyamoto to give Mario some superhuman abilities, namely the ability to fall from any height unharmed. Mario&#x27;s appearance in &quot;Donkey Kong&quot;—overalls, a hat, and a thick mustache—led Miyamoto to change aspects of the game to make Mario look like a plumber rather than a carpenter. Miyamoto felt that New York City provided the best setting for the game, with its &quot;labyrinthine subterranean network of sewage pipes&quot;. To date, games in the &quot;Mario Bros.&quot; franchise have been released for more than a dozen platforms. Shortly after, Miyamoto also worked the character sprites and game design for the &quot;Baseball&quot;, &quot;Tennis&quot;, and &quot;Golf&quot; games on the NES.

===1985–1989: NES/Famicom, &quot;Super Mario Bros.&quot;, and &quot;The Legend of Zelda&quot;===
As Nintendo released its first home video game console, the Family Computer (rereleased in North America as the Nintendo Entertainment System), Miyamoto made two of the most popular titles for the console and in the history of video games as a whole: &quot;Super Mario Bros.&quot; (a sequel to &quot;Mario Bros.&quot;) and &quot;The Legend of Zelda&quot; (an entirely original title).

In both games, Miyamoto decided to focus more on gameplay than on high scores, unlike many games of the time. &quot;Super Mario Bros.&quot; largely took a linear approach, with the player traversing the stage by running, jumping, and dodging or defeating enemies. It was a culmination of Miyamoto&#x27;s gameplay concepts and technical knowledge drawn from his experiences of designing &quot;Donkey Kong&quot;, &quot;Mario Bros&quot;, &quot;Devil World&quot; (1984), the side-scrolling racing game &quot;Excitebike&quot; (1984), and the 1985 NES port of side-scrolling beat &#x27;em up &quot;Kung-Fu Master&quot; (1984). This culminated in his concept of a platformer set in an expansive world that would have the player &quot;strategize while scrolling sideways&quot; over long distances, have aboveground and underground levels, and have colorful backgrounds rather than black backgrounds.

By contrast, Miyamoto employed nonlinear gameplay in &quot;The Legend of Zelda&quot;, forcing the player to think their way through riddles and puzzles. The world was expansive and seemingly endless, offering &quot;an array of choice and depth never seen before in a video game.&quot; With &quot;The Legend of Zelda&quot;, Miyamoto sought to make an in-game world that players would identify with, a &quot;miniature garden that they can put inside their drawer.&quot; He drew his inspiration from his experiences as a boy around Kyoto, where he explored nearby fields, woods, and caves; each &quot;Zelda&quot; game embodies this sense of exploration. &quot;When I was a child,&quot; Miyamoto said, &quot;I went hiking and found a lake. It was quite a surprise for me to stumble upon it. When I traveled around the country without a map, trying to find my way, stumbling on amazing things as I went, I realized how it felt to go on an adventure like this.&quot; He recreated his memories of becoming lost amid the maze of sliding doors in his family home in &quot;Zelda&quot;″s labyrinthine dungeons. In February 1986, Nintendo released it as the launch game for the Nintendo Entertainment System&#x27;s new Disk System peripheral.

Miyamoto worked on various other different games for the Nintendo Entertainment System, including &quot;Ice Climber&quot; and &quot;Kid Icarus&quot;. He also worked on sequels to both &quot;Super Mario Bros&quot; and &quot;The Legend of Zelda&quot;. &quot;Super Mario Bros. 2&quot;, released only in Japan at the time, reuses gameplay elements from &quot;Super Mario Bros.&quot;, though the game is much more difficult than its predecessor. Nintendo of America disliked &quot;Super Mario Bros. 2&quot;, which they found to be frustratingly difficult and otherwise little more than a modification of &quot;Super Mario Bros.&quot; Rather than risk the franchise&#x27;s popularity, they canceled its stateside release and looked for an alternative. They realized they already had one option in &quot;Yume Kojo: Doki Doki Panic&quot; (Dream Factory: Heart-Pounding Panic), also designed by Miyamoto. This game was reworked and released as &quot;Super Mario Bros. 2&quot; (not to be confused with the Japanese game of the same name) in North America and Europe. The Japanese version of &quot;Super Mario Bros. 2&quot; was eventually released in North America as &quot;Super Mario Bros.: The Lost Levels&quot;.

The successor to &quot;The Legend of Zelda&quot;, &quot;Zelda II: The Adventure of Link&quot;, bears little resemblance to the first game in the series. &quot;The Adventure of Link&quot; features side-scrolling areas within a larger world map rather than the bird&#x27;s eye view of the previous title. The game incorporates a strategic combat system and more RPG elements, including an experience points (EXP) system, magic spells, and more interaction with non-player characters (NPCs). Link has extra lives; no other game in the series includes this feature. &quot;The Adventure of Link&quot; plays out in a two-mode dynamic. The overworld, the area where the majority of the action occurs in other &quot;The Legend of Zelda&quot; games, is still from a top-down perspective, but it now serves as a hub to the other areas. Whenever Link enters a new area such as a town, the game switches to a side-scrolling view. These separate methods of traveling and entering combat are one of many aspects adapted from the role-playing genre. The game was highly successful at the time, and introduced elements such as Link&#x27;s &quot;magic meter&quot; and the Dark Link character that would become commonplace in future Zelda games, although the role-playing elements such as experience points and the platform-style side-scrolling and multiple lives were never used again in the official series. The game is also looked upon as one of the most difficult games in the &quot;Zelda&quot; series and 8-bit gaming as a whole. Additionally, &quot;The Adventure of Link&quot; was one of the first games to combine role-playing video game and platforming elements to a considerable degree.

Soon after, &quot;Super Mario Bros. 3&quot; was developed by Nintendo Entertainment Analysis &amp; Development; the game took more than two years to complete. The game offers numerous modifications on the original &quot;Super Mario Bros.&quot;, ranging from costumes with different abilities to new enemies. Bowser&#x27;s children were designed to be unique in appearance and personality; Miyamoto based the characters on seven of his programmers as a tribute to their work on the game. The Koopalings&#x27; names were later altered to mimic names of well-known, Western musicians in the English localization. In a first for the &quot;Mario&quot; series, the player navigates via two game screens: an overworld map and a level playfield. The overworld map displays an overhead representation of the current world and has several paths leading from the world&#x27;s entrance to a castle. Moving the on-screen character to a certain tile will allow access to that level&#x27;s playfield, a linear stage populated with obstacles and enemies. The majority of the game takes place in these levels.

===1990–2000: SNES, Nintendo 64, &quot;Super Mario 64&quot;, and &quot;Ocarina of Time&quot;===

A merger between Nintendo&#x27;s various internal research and development teams led to the creation of Nintendo Entertainment Analysis &amp; Development (Nintendo EAD), which Miyamoto eventually headed. Nintendo EAD had approximately fifteen months to develop &quot;F-Zero&quot;, a launch game for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System. Miyamoto worked through various games on the Super Nintendo Entertainment System, one of them &quot;Star Fox&quot;. For the game, programmer Jez San convinced Nintendo to develop an upgrade for the Super Nintendo, allowing it to handle three-dimensional graphics better: the Super FX chip. Using this new hardware, Miyamoto and Katsuya Eguchi designed the &quot;Star Fox&quot; game with an early implementation of three-dimensional graphics.

Miyamoto produced two major &quot;Mario&quot; games for the system. The first, &quot;Super Mario World&quot;, was a launch game. It features an overworld as in &quot;Super Mario Bros. 3&quot; and introduces a new character, Yoshi, who appears in many other Nintendo games. The second &quot;Mario&quot; game for the system, &quot;Super Mario RPG&quot;, went in a somewhat different direction. Miyamoto led a team consisting of a partnership between Nintendo and Square; it took nearly a year to develop the graphics. The story takes place in a newly rendered Mushroom Kingdom based on the &quot;Super Mario Bros.&quot; series.

Miyamoto also created &quot;The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past&quot; for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System, the third entry in the series. Dropping the side-scrolling elements of its predecessor, &quot;A Link to the Past&quot; introduced to the series elements that are still commonplace today, such as the concept of an alternate or parallel world, the Master Sword, and other new weapons and items.

Shigeru Miyamoto mentored Satoshi Tajiri, guiding him during the creation process of &quot;Pocket Monsters: Red and Green&quot; (released in English as &quot;Pokémon Red&quot; and &quot;Blue&quot;), the initial video games in the Pokémon series. He also acted as the producer for these games and worked on social gameplay concepts such as trading. Pokémon would go on to be one of the most popular entertainment franchises in the world, spanning video games, anime, and various other merchandise.

Miyamoto made several games for the Nintendo 64, mostly from his previous franchises. His first game on the new system, and one of its launch games, is &quot;Super Mario 64&quot;, for which he was the principal director. In developing the game, he began with character design and the camera system. Miyamoto and the other designers were initially unsure of which direction the game should take, and spent months to select an appropriate camera view and layout. The original concept involved a fixed path much like an isometric-type game, before the choice was made to settle on a free-roaming 3D design. He guided the design of the Nintendo 64 controller in tandem with that of &quot;Super Mario 64&quot;.

Using what he had learned about the Nintendo 64 from developing &quot;Super Mario 64&quot; and &quot;Star Fox 64&quot;, Miyamoto produced his next game, &quot;The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time&quot;, leading a team of several directors. Its engine was based on that of &quot;Super Mario 64&quot; but was so heavily modified as to be a somewhat different engine. Individual parts of &quot;Ocarina of Time&quot; were handled by multiple directors—a new strategy for Nintendo EAD. However, when things progressed slower than expected, Miyamoto returned to the development team with a more central role assisted in public by interpreter Bill Trinen. The team was new to 3D games, but assistant director Makoto Miyanaga recalls a sense of &quot;passion for creating something new and unprecedented&quot;. Miyamoto went on to produce a sequel to &quot;Ocarina of Time&quot;, known as &quot;The Legend of Zelda: Majora&#x27;s Mask&quot;. By reusing the game engine and graphics from &quot;Ocarina of Time&quot;, a smaller team required only 18 months to finish &quot;Majora&#x27;s Mask&quot;.

Miyamoto worked on a variety of &quot;Mario&quot; series spin-offs for the Nintendo 64, including &quot;Mario Kart 64&quot; and &quot;Mario Party&quot;.

===2000–2011: GameCube, Wii, and DS===

Miyamoto produced various games for the GameCube, including the launch game &quot;Luigi&#x27;s Mansion&quot;. The game was first revealed at Nintendo Space World 2000 as a technical demo designed to show off the graphical capabilities of the GameCube. Miyamoto made an original short demo of the game concepts, and Nintendo decided to turn it into a full game. &quot;Luigi&#x27;s Mansion&quot; was later shown at E3 2001 with the GameCube console. Miyamoto continued to make additional &quot;Mario&quot; spinoffs in these years. He also produced the 3D game series &quot;Metroid Prime&quot;, after the original designer Yokoi, a friend and mentor of Miyamoto&#x27;s, died. In this time he developed &quot;Pikmin&quot; and its sequel &quot;Pikmin 2&quot;, based on his experiences gardening. He also worked on new games for the &quot;Star Fox&quot;, &quot;Donkey Kong&quot;, &quot;F-Zero&quot;, and &quot;The Legend of Zelda&quot; series on both the GameCube and the Game Boy Advance systems. With the help of Hideo Kojima, he guided the developers of &quot;Metal Gear Solid: The Twin Snakes&quot;. He helped with many games on the Nintendo DS, including the remake of &quot;Super Mario 64&quot;, titled &quot;Super Mario 64 DS&quot;, and the new game &quot;Nintendogs&quot;, a new franchise based on his own experiences with dogs. At E3 2005, Miyamoto showed off &quot;Nintendogs&quot; with Tina Wood, where he promised to show her &quot;a few more tricks&quot; backstage.

Miyamoto played a major role in the development of the Wii, a console that popularized motion control gaming, and its launch game &quot;Wii Sports&quot;, which helped show the capability of the new control scheme. Miyamoto went on to produce other titles in the &quot;Wii&quot; series, including &quot;Wii Fit&quot;. His inspiration for &quot;Wii Fit&quot; was to encourage conversation and family bonding.

At E3 2004, Miyamoto unveiled &quot;The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess&quot;, appearing dressed as the protagonist Link with a sword and shield. Also released for the GameCube, the game was among the Wii&#x27;s launch games and the first in the &quot;Zelda&quot; series to implement motion controls. He also helped with &quot;The Legend of Zelda: Skyward Sword&quot;, which featured more accurate motion controls. He also produced two &quot;Zelda&quot; titles for the Nintendo DS, &quot;The Legend of Zelda: Phantom Hourglass&quot; and &quot;The Legend of Zelda: Spirit Tracks&quot;. These were the first titles in the series to implement touch screen controls.

Miyamoto produced three major &quot;Mario&quot; titles for Wii from 2007 to 2010: &quot;Super Mario Galaxy&quot;, &quot;New Super Mario Bros. Wii&quot;, and &quot;Super Mario Galaxy 2&quot;.

===2011–present: Wii U, 3DS, Switch and other projects===
Unlike in the 2000s, during which he was involved in many projects as producer, Miyamoto&#x27;s activities in development were less pronounced in that decade with Miyamoto only producing &quot;Luigi&#x27;s Mansion: Dark Moon&quot; and &quot;Star Fox Zero&quot;. Otherwise, Miyamoto was credited as General Producer, Executive Producer and Supervisor for most projects, which are positions with much less involvement in comparison to a producer.

Following the death of Nintendo president Satoru Iwata in July 2015, Miyamoto was appointed as an acting Representative Director, alongside Genyo Takeda. He was relieved of this position in September 2015 when Tatsumi Kimishima assumed the role of the company&#x27;s president. He was also appointed the position of &quot;Creative Fellow&quot; at the same time, providing expert advice to Kimishima as a &quot;support network&quot; alongside Takeda. In his capacity as Creative Fellow, he provides feedback and guidance to game directors during development.

In 2018, it was announced that Miyamoto would be working as a producer on &quot;The Super Mario Bros. Movie&quot; based on the &quot;Mario&quot; franchise by Illumination.

Miyamoto was heavily involved with the design and construction of Super Nintendo World, a themed area featured at Universal Studios Japan and Universal Studios Hollywood and under construction at Universal Studios Singapore and Universal Epic Universe. Miyamoto oversaw the design and construction of the land and its attractions and acted as Nintendo&#x27;s public representative on the land, hosting several promotional materials including a December 2020 Nintendo Direct in which he gave a tour of parts of the land.

==Development philosophy==

Miyamoto, and Nintendo as a whole, do not use focus groups. Instead, Miyamoto figures out if a game is fun for himself. He says that if he enjoys it, others will too. He elaborates, citing the conception of the &quot;Pokémon&quot; series as an example, &quot;And that&#x27;s the point – Not to make something sell, something very popular, but to love something, and make something that we creators can love. It&#x27;s the very core feeling we should have in making games.&quot; Miyamoto wants players to experience &quot;kyokan&quot;; he wants &quot;the players to feel about the game what the developers felt themselves.&quot;

He then tests it with friends and family. He encourages younger developers to consider people who are new to gaming, for example by having them switch their dominant hand with their other hand to feel the experience of an unfamiliar game.

Miyamoto&#x27;s philosophy does not focus on hyper-realistic graphics, although he realizes they have their place. He is more focused on the game mechanics, such as the choices and challenges in the game. Similar to how manga artists subverted their genre, Miyamoto hopes to subvert some of the basic principles he had popularized in his early games, retaining some elements but eliminating others.

His game design philosophy typically prioritizes gameplay over storytelling. In a 1992 interview, he said &quot;the important thing is that it feels good when you&#x27;re playing it&quot; and &quot;that quality is not determined by the story, but by the controls, the sound, and the rhythm and pacing&quot;. However, he requires a &quot;compatibility [between] the story and gameplay [because] a good story can smooth over that discrepancy and make it all feel natural&quot;.

His use of real-time rendered cinematics (not prerendered video) serves both his own rapidly interactive development process with no rendering delays, and the player&#x27;s interaction with the game&#x27;s continuity. He prefers to change his games right until they are finalized, and to make &quot;something unique and unprecedented&quot;. He prefers the game to be interactively fun rather than have elaborate film sequences, stating in 1999, &quot;I will never make movie-like games&quot;; therefore, the more than 90 total minutes of short cutscenes interspersed throughout &quot;Ocarina of Time&quot; deliver more interactive cinematic qualities. His vision mandates a rapid and malleable development process with small teams, as when he directed substantial changes to the overall game scenario in the final months of the development of &quot;Ocarina of Time&quot;. He said, &quot;The reason behind using such a simple process, as I am sure you have all experienced in the workshop, is that there is a total limit on team energy. There is a limit to the work a team can do, and there is a limit to my own energy. We opted not to use that limited time and energy on pre-rendered images for use in cinema scenes, but rather on tests on other inter-active elements and polishing up the game&quot;.

For these reasons, he opposes prerendered cutscenes. Of &quot;Ocarina of Time&quot;, he says &quot;we were able to make use of truly cinematic methods with our camera work without relying on [prerendered video].&quot;

Miyamoto has occasionally been critical of the role-playing game (RPG) genre. In a 1992 interview, when asked whether &quot;Zelda&quot; is an RPG series, he declined but classified it as &quot;a real-time adventure&quot;; he said he was &quot;not interested in [games] decided by stats and numbers [but in preserving] as much of that &#x27;live&#x27; feeling as possible&quot;, which he said &quot;action games are better suited in conveying&quot;. In 2003, he described his &quot;fundamental dislike&quot; of the RPG genre: &quot;I think that with an RPG you are completely bound hand and foot, and can&#x27;t move. But gradually you become able to move your hands and legs... you become slightly untied. And in the end, you feel powerful. So what you get out of an RPG is a feeling of happiness. But I don&#x27;t think they&#x27;re something that&#x27;s fundamentally fun to play. With a game like that, anyone can become really good at it. With &quot;Mario&quot; though, if you&#x27;re not good at it, you may never get good.&quot; While critical of the RPG gameplay system, he has occasionally praised certain aspects of RPGs, such as Yuji Horii&#x27;s writing in the &quot;Dragon Quest&quot; series, the &quot;interactive cinematic approach&quot; of the &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; series, and Shigesato Itoi&#x27;s dialogue in the &quot;Mother&quot; series.

==Impact==

&quot;Time&quot; called Miyamoto &quot;the Spielberg of video games&quot; and &quot;the father of modern video games,&quot; while &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; says he is &quot;regarded by many as possibly the most important game designer of all time.&quot; &quot;GameTrailers&quot; called him &quot;the most influential game creator in history.&quot; Miyamoto has significantly influenced various aspects of the medium. &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; credited him with creating &quot;some of the most innovative, ground breaking and successful work in his field.&quot; Many of Miyamoto&#x27;s works have pioneered new video game concepts or refined existing ones. Miyamoto&#x27;s games have received outstanding critical praise, some being considered the greatest games of all time.

Miyamoto&#x27;s games have also sold very well, becoming some of the bestselling games on Nintendo consoles and of all time. As of 1999, his games had sold 250 million units and grossed billions of dollars.

Calling him one of the few &quot;video-game auteurs,&quot; &quot;The New Yorker&quot; credited Miyamoto&#x27;s role in creating the franchises that drove console sales, as well as designing the consoles themselves. They described Miyamoto as Nintendo&#x27;s &quot;guiding spirit, its meal ticket, and its playful public face,&quot; noting that Nintendo might not exist without him. &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; similarly attributed Nintendo&#x27;s success to Miyamoto more than any other person. &quot;Next Generation&quot; listed him in their &quot;75 Most Important People in the Games Industry of 1995&quot;, elaborating that, &quot;He&#x27;s the most successful game developer in history. He has a unique and brilliant mind as well as an unparalleled grasp of what gamers want to play.&quot;

Miyamoto&#x27;s first major arcade hit &quot;Donkey Kong&quot; was highly influential. It spawned a number of other games with a mix of running, jumping, and vertical traversal. Particularly novel, the vertical genre was initially referred to as &quot;&quot;Donkey Kong&quot;-type&quot; or &quot;&quot;Kong&quot;-style&quot;, before finalizing as &quot;platform&quot;. Earlier games either use storytelling or cutscenes, but &quot;Donkey Kong&quot; combines both to introduce the use of cutscenes to visually advance a complete story. It has multiple, distinct levels that progress the storyline. &quot;Computer and Video Games&quot; called &quot;Donkey Kong&quot; &quot;the most momentous&quot; release of 1981.
Miyamoto&#x27;s best known and most influential game, &quot;Super Mario Bros.&quot;, &quot;depending on your point of view, created an industry or resuscitated a comatose one&quot;. &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; said it &quot;set the standard for all future videogames&quot;. G4 noted its revolutionary gameplay and its role in &quot;almost single-handedly&quot; rescuing the video game industry after the North American video game crash of 1983. The game also popularized the side-scrolling video game genre. &quot;The New Yorker&quot; described Mario as the first folk hero of video games, with as much influence as Mickey Mouse.

&quot;GameSpot&quot; featured &quot;The Legend of Zelda&quot; as one of the 15 most influential games of all time, for being an early example of open world, nonlinear gameplay, and for its introduction of battery backup saving, laying the foundations for later action-adventure games like &quot;Metroid&quot; and role-playing video games like &quot;Final Fantasy&quot;, while influencing most modern games in general. In 2009, &quot;Game Informer&quot; called &quot;The Legend of Zelda&quot; &quot;no less than the greatest game of all time&quot; on their list of &quot;The Top 200 Games of All Time&quot;, saying that it was &quot;ahead of its time by years if not decades&quot;.
At the time of the release of &quot;Star Fox&quot;, the use of filled, three-dimensional polygons in a console game was very unusual, apart from a handful of earlier titles. Due to its success, &quot;Star Fox&quot; has become a Nintendo franchise, with five more games and numerous appearances by its characters in other Nintendo games such as the &quot;Super Smash Bros.&quot; series.
His game &quot;Super Mario 64&quot; defined the field of 3D game design, particularly with its use of a dynamic camera system and the implementation of its analog control. &quot;The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time&quot;″s gameplay system introduced features such as a target lock system and context-sensitive buttons that have since become common elements in 3D adventure games.
The Wii, which Miyamoto played a major role in designing, is the first wireless motion-controlled video game console.

===Critical reception===
Miyamoto&#x27;s games have received outstanding critical praise, and are widely considered among the greatest of all time.

Games in Miyamoto&#x27;s &quot;The Legend of Zelda&quot; series have received outstanding critical acclaim. &quot;A Link to the Past&quot; is a landmark game for Nintendo and is widely considered today to be one of the greatest video games of all time. &quot;Ocarina of Time&quot; is widely considered by critics and gamers alike to be one of the greatest video games ever made. &quot;Ocarina of Time&quot; was listed by Guinness World Records as the highest-rated video game in history, citing its Metacritic score of 99 out of 100. &quot;Twilight Princess&quot; was released to universal critical acclaim, and is the third highest-rated game for the Wii. It received perfect scores from major publications such as CVG, &quot;Electronic Gaming Monthly&quot;, &quot;Game Informer&quot;, GamesRadar, and GameSpy.

Critical analysis of &quot;Super Mario Bros.&quot; has been extremely positive, with many touting it as one of the best video games of all time. In 2009, &quot;Game Informer&quot; put &quot;Super Mario Bros.&quot; in second place on its list of &quot;The Top 200 Games of All Time&quot;, behind &quot;The Legend of Zelda&quot;, saying that it &quot;remains a monument to brilliant design and fun gameplay&quot;.

&quot;Super Mario 64&quot; is acclaimed by many critics and fans as one of the greatest and most revolutionary video games of all time.

According to Metacritic, &quot;Super Mario Galaxy&quot; and &quot;Super Mario Galaxy 2&quot; are the highest- and second-highest-rated games, respectively, for the Wii.

A 1995 article in &quot;Maximum&quot; stated that &quot;in gaming circles Miyamoto&#x27;s name carries far more weight than Steven Spielberg&#x27;s could ever sustain.&quot;

===Commercial reception===
More than 1 billion copies of games featuring franchises created by Miyamoto have been sold.
Miyamoto&#x27;s &quot;Mario&quot; series is, by far, the best-selling video game franchise of all time, selling over 500 million units. &quot;Super Mario Bros.&quot; is the sixth best-selling video game of all time. The game was the all-time bestselling video game for over 20 years until its lifetime sales were surpassed by &quot;Wii Sports&quot;. &quot;Super Mario Bros.&quot;, &quot;Super Mario Bros. 3&quot;, and &quot;Super Mario Bros. 2&quot; were, respectively, the three bestselling games for the Nintendo Entertainment System. Levi Buchanan of IGN considered &quot;Super Mario Bros. 3&quot;″s appearance in the film &quot;The Wizard&quot; as a show-stealing element, and referred to the movie as a &quot;90-minute commercial&quot; for the game. &quot;Super Mario World&quot; was the bestselling game for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System. &quot;Super Mario 64&quot; was the bestselling Nintendo 64 game, and as of May 21, 2003, the game had sold eleven million copies. At the end of 2007, &quot;Guinness World Records&quot; reported sales of 11.8 million copies. As of September 25, 2007, it was the seventh best-selling video game in the United States with six million copies sold. By June 2007, &quot;Super Mario 64&quot; had become the second most popular game on Wii&#x27;s Virtual Console, behind &quot;Super Mario Bros.&quot; &quot;Super Mario Sunshine&quot; is the third best-selling GameCube game.
The original game in &quot;The Legend of Zelda&quot; series is the fifth-bestselling game for the Nintendo Entertainment System. &quot;The Wind Waker&quot; is the fourth bestselling GameCube game. &quot;Twilight Princess&quot; was commercially successful. In the PAL region, which covers most of Asia, Africa, South America, Australia, New Zealand, and most of Western Europe, &quot;Twilight Princess&quot; is the bestselling &quot;Zelda&quot; game ever. During its first week, the game was sold with three out of every four Wii purchases. The game had sold 4.52 million copies on the Wii as of March 1, 2008, and 1.32 million on the GameCube as of March 31, 2007.
The &quot;Mario Kart&quot; series is currently the most successful racing game franchise of all time. &quot;Mario Kart&quot; titles tend to be among the bestselling games for their respective consoles; &quot;Super Mario Kart&quot; is the third bestselling video game for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System, &quot;Mario Kart 64&quot; is the second bestselling Nintendo 64 game, &quot;Mario Kart: Double Dash&quot; is the second bestselling game for the GameCube, and &quot;Mario Kart Wii&quot; is the second bestselling game for the Wii.
Miyamoto produced &quot;Wii Sports&quot;, another of the bestselling games of all time and part of the Wii series. &quot;Wii Fit&quot; designed by Miyamoto, was the third best selling console game not packaged with a console, with 22.67 million copies sold.
Outside of video games, Miyamoto produced &quot;The Super Mario Bros. Movie&quot;, which ended up becoming the third-highest-grossing animated movie of all time, grossing $1.347 billion worldwide during its theatrical run as of July 14, 2023. It is also the highest-grossing film based on a video game (or video game series) by a huge margin, making it a huge statistical outlier; for context, the second-highest-grossing film based on a video game is &quot;Warcraft&quot; (2016), which grossed $900 million less, for a total of about $439 million.

===Awards and recognition===
The name of the main character of the PC game &quot;Daikatana&quot;, Hiro Miyamoto, is a homage to Miyamoto. The character Gary Oak from the &quot;Pokémon&quot; anime series is named Shigeru in Japan and is the rival of Ash Ketchum (called Satoshi in Japan). &quot;Pokémon&quot; creator Satoshi Tajiri was mentored by Miyamoto.

In 1998, Miyamoto was honored as the first person inducted into the Academy of Interactive Arts and Sciences&#x27; Hall of Fame. In 2006, Miyamoto was made a &quot;Chevalier&quot; (knight) of the French Ordre des Arts et des Lettres by the French Minister of Culture Renaud Donnedieu de Vabres.

On November 28, 2006, Miyamoto was featured in &quot;TIME Asia&quot;&#x27;s &quot;60 Years of Asian Heroes&quot;. He was later chosen as one of Time Magazine&#x27;s 100 Most Influential People of the Year in both 2007 and also in 2008, in which he topped the list with a total vote of 1,766,424. At the Game Developers Choice Awards, on March 7, 2007, Miyamoto received the Lifetime Achievement Award &quot;for a career that spans the creation of Super Mario Bros. and The Legend of Zelda, and Donkey Kong to the company&#x27;s recent revolutionary systems, Nintendo DS and Wii.&quot; GameTrailers and IGN placed Miyamoto first on their lists for the &quot;Top Ten Game Creators&quot; and the &quot;Top 100 Game Creators of All Time&quot; respectively.

In a survey of game developers by industry publication &quot;Develop&quot;, 30% of the developers, by far the largest portion, chose Miyamoto as their &quot;Ultimate Development Hero&quot;. Miyamoto has been interviewed by companies and organizations such as CNN&#x27;s Talk Asia. He was made a Fellow of BAFTA at the British Academy Video Games Awards on March 19, 2010. In 2012, Miyamoto was also the first interactive creator to be awarded the highest recognition in Spain, the Prince of Asturias Award, in the category of Communications and Humanities.

Miyamoto was awarded Japan&#x27;s Person of Cultural Merit in 2019 in recognition for his contributions towards Japan&#x27;s video game industry. He was the first person in the video game industry to receive the honor.

==Personal life==
Miyamoto is married to Yasuko, and they have two children. In 2010, his son was 25 and working at an advertising agency, while his daughter was 23 and studying zoology at the time. His children played video games in their youth, but he also made them go outside. Although he can speak some English, he is not fluent and prefers to speak in Japanese for interviews.

Miyamoto does not generally sign autographs, out of concern that he would be inundated. He also does not appear on Japanese television, so as to minimize his chance of being recognized. More foreign tourists than Japanese people approach him.

Miyamoto is ambidextrous but usually favors his left hand, which is why his characters Mario and Link were designed to be left-handed.

Miyamoto spends little time playing video games in his personal time, preferring to play the guitar, mandolin, and banjo. He avidly enjoys bluegrass music. Miyamoto said in a 2016 interview that when he had his own family he took up gardening with his wife, which influenced other games that he was making at the time. He has a Shetland Sheepdog named Pikku that provided the inspiration for &quot;Nintendogs&quot;. He is also a semi-professional dog breeder. 

He has been quoted as stating, &quot;Video games are bad for you? That&#x27;s what they said about rock and roll.&quot; He is alleged to have said that &quot;a delayed game is eventually good, but a rushed game is forever bad.&quot; In 2023, fans deduced that it was taken from a quote by Siobhan Beeman, who worked on the &quot;Wing Commander&quot; franchise at Origin Systems. She first uttered the phrase at GDC in 1996, or something close to it, &quot;a game’s only late until it ships, but it sucks forever.&quot; It somehow was misconstrued as a Miyamoto quote, circulating on the Internet for many years.

Miyamoto enjoys rearranging furniture in his house, even late at night. He also stated that he has a hobby of guessing the dimensions of objects, then checking to see if he was correct, and reportedly carries a measuring tape with him everywhere. In December 2016, Miyamoto showcased his hobby on &quot;The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon&quot;, while also performing the &quot;Super Mario Bros.&quot; theme on guitar with The Roots during the same show.

<text>A courtesy title is a form of address and/or reference in the British system of nobility used for children, former wives and other close relatives of a peer, as well as certain officials such as some judges and members of the Scottish gentry. These styles are used &quot;by courtesy&quot; in the sense that persons referred to by these titles do not in law hold the substantive title. There are several different kinds of courtesy titles in the British peerage system.

==Children of peers==

=== Courtesy titles ===

If a peer of one of the top three ranks of the peerage (a duke, a marquess or an earl) has more than one title, his eldest son – himself not a peer – may use one of his father&#x27;s lesser titles &quot;by courtesy&quot;. However, the father continues to be the substantive holder of the peerage title, and the son is using the title by courtesy only, unless issued a writ of acceleration. The eldest son of the eldest son of a duke or marquess may use a still lower title, if one exists. In legal documents, the courtesy title is implied, but not used directly – that is, the name of the person is given, followed by &quot;commonly called [&quot;title&quot;]&quot;.

For example, the Duke of Norfolk is also Earl of Arundel and Baron Maltravers. His eldest son is, therefore, styled &quot;Earl of Arundel&quot; (&quot;the&quot; does not precede it, as this would indicate a substantive title). Lord Arundel&#x27;s eldest son (should he have one during his father&#x27;s lifetime) would be styled &quot;Lord Maltravers&quot;. However, only the Duke of Norfolk is actually a peer; his son Lord Arundel and his hypothetical grandson Lord Maltravers are not.

Courtesy titles are used by the peer&#x27;s eldest living son, and the eldest son&#x27;s eldest living son, and so forth, only; other descendants are not permitted to use the peer&#x27;s subsidiary titles. Only the heir apparent (and heir apparent to the heir apparent, and so on) may use them. An heir presumptive (for instance, a brother, nephew, or cousin) does not use a courtesy title. However, Scottish practice allows the style &quot;Master/Mistress of X&quot; to an heir presumptive as well as to an heir apparent; for example, the brother of the present Marquess of Tweeddale, Lord Alistair Hay, has the title &quot;Master of Tweeddale&quot;.

Holders of courtesy titles do not, at the Court of St James&#x27;s, have their title preceded by &quot;the&quot;: &quot;Earl of Arundel&quot; rather than &quot;the Earl of Arundel&quot;, for instance.

Wives are entitled to use the feminine forms of their husbands&#x27; courtesy titles. Thus, the wife of an Earl of Arundel would be styled &quot;Countess of Arundel&quot; (again, without the definite article in front).

The children (either male or female) of holders of courtesy titles bear the styles as would be theirs if their fathers actually held the peerages by which they were known; for example, Serena Stanhope, daughter of Viscount Petersham (heir to the Earl of Harrington), had the style of the Honourable, which is reserved for daughters of viscounts and barons, a title which her father held by courtesy only.

===Choosing a courtesy peer&#x27;s title===
The actual courtesy title which is used is a matter of family tradition. For instance, the eldest son of the Duke of Buccleuch and Queensberry is styled &quot;Earl of Dalkeith&quot;, even though the duke is also Marquess of Dumfriesshire, a title that outranks the earldom. Similarly, the eldest son of the Marquess of Londonderry is styled &quot;Viscount Castlereagh&quot;, even though the marquess is also Earl Vane.

In a few houses, successive heirs alternate between two courtesy titles. Heirs to the Marquess of Lansdowne are alternately &quot;Earl of Kerry&quot; and &quot;Earl of Shelburne&quot;, whereas heirs to the Earl of Jersey are alternately &quot;Viscount Grandison&quot; and &quot;Viscount Villiers&quot;.

Titles with the same name as a peer&#x27;s main title are not used as courtesy titles. For instance, the Duke of Westminster is also Marquess of Westminster and Earl Grosvenor (among other titles). The duke&#x27;s heir apparent (when there is one) is not styled &quot;Marquess of Westminster&quot;, as this would cause confusion between son and father, and so the former is styled &quot;Earl Grosvenor&quot; instead.

The title used does not have to be exactly equivalent to the actual peerage. For example, the eldest son of the Duke of Wellington is usually styled &quot;Marquess of Douro&quot;, although the actual peerage possessed by his father is Marquess Douro (no &quot;of&quot; between the rank and place).

If a peer of the rank of earl or above does not have any subsidiary titles of a name different from his main title, his eldest son usually uses an invented courtesy title of &quot;Lord [&quot;surname&quot;]&quot;. For instance, the eldest son of the Earl of Devon is styled &quot;Lord Courtenay&quot;, even though the earl has no barony of that name; similarly, the eldest son of the Earl of Guilford is styled &quot;Lord North&quot;. The eldest son of the Earl of Huntingdon, who has no subsidiary titles, is styled &quot;Viscount Hastings&quot; to avoid confusion with Lord Hastings, a substantive peer. The heir of Earl Castle Stewart uses the style &quot;Viscount Stewart&quot; to avoid confusion with Lord Stewart, the eldest son of Viscount Castlereagh (the eldest son of the Marquess of Londonderry).

=== Courtesy style of &quot;Lord&quot; ===
The courtesy style of &quot;Lord&quot; before the given name is accorded to younger sons of dukes and marquesses. It is always added before the person&#x27;s given name and surname, as in the example of Lord Randolph Churchill, although conversational usage drops the surname on secondary reference. It is never used before the person&#x27;s surname alone, and is not considered a &quot;title&quot; under peerage law.

The title persists after the death of the holder&#x27;s father, but is not inherited by any of his children. The wife of the holder is entitled to the feminine form of her husband&#x27;s style, which takes the form of &quot;Lady&quot; followed by her husband&#x27;s given name and surname, as in the example of Lady Randolph Churchill. The holder is addressed as &quot;Lord Randolph&quot; and his wife as &quot;Lady Randolph&quot;.

=== Courtesy style of &quot;Lady&quot; ===
The courtesy style of &quot;Lady&quot; is used for the daughters of dukes, marquesses, and earls. It is added before the person&#x27;s given name, as in the examples Lady Diana Spencer and Lady Henrietta Waldegrave. Because it is merely a courtesy with no legal implications, the honorific persists after the death of the holder&#x27;s father, but it is not inherited by her children. The style is never used immediately before the surname alone.

&quot;Lady&quot; is also used before the first name of Ladies Companion of the Order of the Garter and Ladies of the Order of the Thistle who do not hold another, higher title or style. 

The spouse of a woman with a courtesy style does not hold any courtesy style in right of their spouse; neither does the husband of a person with &quot;any&quot; style or title (including the husband of a peer).

=== Courtesy style of &quot;The Honourable&quot; ===
Younger sons of earls, along with all sons and daughters of viscounts, barons and lords of parliament, are accorded the courtesy style of &quot;the Honourable&quot; before their name; one example is Vita Sackville-West. This is usually abbreviated to &quot;the Hon.&quot;. The style persists after the death of the holder&#x27;s father, but it may not be inherited by the holder&#x27;s children. It is used only in third person reference, not in speaking to the person.

===Married daughters===
A daughter of a duke, marquess or earl who marries an untitled man becomes &quot;Lady [&quot;given name&quot;] [&quot;husband&#x27;s surname&quot;]&quot;; an example from fiction is Lady Catherine de Bourgh in &quot;Pride and Prejudice&quot;, who married the untitled knight (or baronet) Sir Louis de Bourgh and, therefore, retains her courtesy style. The daughter of a viscount or baron who marries a commoner is styled &quot;the Honourable [&quot;given name&quot;] [&quot;husband&#x27;s surname&quot;]&quot;.

Any woman who marries a peer uses the feminine version of his peerage title, even if her own precedence is higher than his, as in the case of a duke&#x27;s daughter marrying a baron, because a peerage is a substantive title, the usage of which is preferred to any courtesy style – unless she marries into the British royal family. If a woman marries a younger son of a duke or marquess, she becomes &quot;Lady [&quot;husband&#x27;s full name&quot;]&quot;. If she marries a younger son of an earl, or any son of a viscount or a baron, she becomes &quot;the Hon. Mrs [&quot;husband&#x27;s full name&quot;]&quot;.

In cases of divorce, a woman may keep the same style as during marriage or she may choose to assume the style &quot;Mrs [&quot;given name&quot;] [&quot;husband&#x27;s surname&quot;]&quot;. Regardless of what she chooses, she loses all precedence acquired from marriage and, because of the former option, there can be multiple &quot;Ladies John Smith&quot; at any one time.

===Adoption===
Until 2004, children who had been adopted by peers had no right to any courtesy titles. Pursuant to a Royal Warrant dated 30 April 2004, these children are now automatically entitled to the same styles and courtesy titles as their siblings. However, unlike biological children, they cannot inherit peerages from their parent (and thus, since they cannot be heirs, if a peer adopts a son and he is the oldest son, he would use the styles of younger sons). For example, actress Nimmy March, the daughter of the Duke and Duchess of Richmond, was immediately elevated to Lady Naomi Gordon-Lennox on 30 April 2004.

Scottish peerages&#x27; rules for courtesy titles and styles differ.

===Summary===
==Indirect inheritance==
Occasionally, a peer succeeds to a peerage upon the death of a relative who is not one of his or her parents. When this happens, the relatives of the new peer may be allowed to use the courtesy titles or styles which would have been accorded them if the new peer had succeeded a parent or grandparent in the title.

For instance, Rupert Ponsonby, 7th Baron de Mauley succeeded his childless uncle in 2002. His brother George had no title, as their father was only a younger son of a peer and never inherited (as heir presumptive) the Baron de Mauley title. However, in 2003, George was granted, by warrant of precedence from Queen Elizabeth II, the style and precedence that would have been his, had his father survived to inherit the barony, becoming &quot;the Honourable George Ponsonby&quot;. Precedence in such circumstances is usually granted, but is not automatic.

== Spouses of peers ==
The wife of a substantive peer is legally entitled to the privileges of peerage: she is said to have a &quot;life estate&quot; in her husband&#x27;s dignity. Thus, a duke&#x27;s wife is titled &quot;the duchess&quot;, a marquess&#x27;s wife &quot;the marchioness&quot;, an earl&#x27;s wife &quot;the countess&quot;, a viscount&#x27;s wife, &quot;the viscountess&quot; and a baron&#x27;s wife &quot;the baroness&quot;. Despite being referred to as a &quot;peeress&quot;, she is a peer by virtue of her marriage; however, this is considered a legal title, as it grants her a legal (marriage) estate, unlike the social titles of a peer&#x27;s children.

The wives of eldest sons of peers hold their titles on the same basis as their husbands – that is, by courtesy. Thus, the wife of the person known as Marquess of Douro is known as &quot;Marchioness of Douro&quot;.

=== Husbands ===
In the case of a woman who is a substantive peer in her own right, by succession or by first creation (that is, ennoblement, most commonly in recent times under the Life Peerages Act 1958), her husband acquires no distinction in right of his wife. Thus, the husband of Baroness Bottomley of Nettlestone has no courtesy title; he was simply called &quot;Mr Peter Bottomley&quot; until he was knighted and became &quot;Sir Peter Bottomley&quot;.

In 2012, Conservative MP Oliver Colvile put forward a Ten Minute Rule bill to allow the spouse of a woman who holds an honour, if he or she enters civil partnership or marriage, to assume the style &quot;the Honourable&quot;. This bill stalled, and was not passed by the end of the Parliament. In 2013, there was a private member&#x27;s bill in the House of Lords introduced by Conservative excepted hereditary peer Lord Lucas to the same effect, which was similarly not passed.

=== Widows ===
If a prince or peer dies, his wife&#x27;s style does not change unless the new peer is a married man (or a woman, if the succession permits). Traditionally, the widowed peeress puts &quot;Dowager&quot; in her style – for example, &quot;The Most Hon. the Marchioness of London&quot; becomes &quot;The Most Hon. the Dowager Marchioness of London&quot;.

If a widowed peeress&#x27;s son predeceases her, her daughter-in-law does not use the title of Dowager, but is styled, for instance, &quot;The Most Hon. Mary, Marchioness of London&quot; until her mother-in-law dies, at which point she may use the title of &quot;Dowager Marchioness&quot;. In more recent times, some widows have chosen to be styled with their first names, instead of as Dowager – for example, &quot;Octavia, Lady Baden-Powell&quot; (&quot;Lady Octavia Baden-Powell&quot; would incorrectly imply that she was a daughter of a duke, a marquess or an earl, or a Lady Companion of the Order of the Garter or a Lady of the Order of the Thistle without a higher style).

=== Divorced wives and widows who remarry ===
It used to be customary for women with higher titles from one marriage to retain them even on subsequent remarriage. As Lord Macnaughten put it, in the case of &quot;Earl Cowley v Countess Cowley&quot; [1901] AC 450: &quot;...everybody knows that it is a very common practice for peeresses (not being peeresses in their own right) after marrying commoners to retain the title lost by such marriage. It is not a matter of right. It is merely a matter of courtesy, and allowed by the usages of society.&quot; The divorce court, in the above case, granted the earl an injunction preventing his former wife from using his title; however, this was overturned by the Court of Appeal, and this was confirmed by the House of Lords, on the grounds that ordinary courts of law lacked any jurisdiction in matters of honour.

The same practice was followed by widows who remarried. A prominent example was Catherine Parr, the last wife of Henry VIII, who continued to be known as Queen Catherine even after her marriage to Thomas, Baron Seymour of Sudeley (and, indeed, she disputed precedence with Anne Seymour, Duchess of Somerset on this basis). This usage died out later in the twentieth century, and women who remarry now ordinarily take a new married name and do not retain their former title.

The College of Arms, acting on an opinion of the Lord Chancellor, holds that divorced peeresses &quot;cannot claim the privileges or status of Peeresses which they derived from their husbands&quot;. While a divorced former wife of a peer is no longer a peeress, she may still use the title, styled with her forename prefixed to the title (without the definite article). Her forename is used primarily to differentiate her from any new wife of her former husband; however, should the former husband remain unmarried, then the former wife may continue to use the title without her forename attached. Should a former wife of a peer remarry, then she would lose the style of a divorced peeress and take on a style relating to her new husband.

On 21 August 1996, letters patent changed titles of divorced wives of British princes, depriving their former wives of the style of Royal Highness. For this reason &quot;Her Royal Highness the Princess of Wales&quot; after divorce became Diana, Princess of Wales. The same happened to &quot;Her Royal Highness the Duchess of York&quot;, who became Sarah, Duchess of York.

=== Civil partners ===
Civil partners of someone using a courtesy title are not entitled to use their partner&#x27;s title.

==Scottish courtesy titles==
Laird is a courtesy title for the owners of some long-established Scottish estates; the title is attached to the estate, not to the family of the owner. Traditionally, a laird is formally styled in the manner evident on the 1730 tombstone in a Scottish &quot;kirkyard&quot; (churchyard). It reads: &quot;The Much Honoured John Grant Laird of Glenmoriston&quot;. The section titled &quot;Scottish Feudal Baronies&quot; in Debrett&#x27;s states that the use of the prefix &quot;The Much Hon.&quot; is correct, but that &quot;most lairds prefer the unadorned name and territorial designation&quot;. The wife of a laird is traditionally accorded the courtesy title of Lady.
===Courtesy suffix of &quot;Younger&quot;===
A form of courtesy title granted is the suffix of &quot;the Younger&quot; (also written as Yr or yr) at the end of the name. This title is granted to the heir apparent of a Scottish baron and is placed at the end of his or her name (for example, John Smith of Edinburgh, Younger, or John Smith, Younger of Edinburgh). The wife of a Younger may herself place the title at the end of her name. The holder is addressed as the younger (for example, The Younger of Edinburgh).

===Courtesy prefix of &quot;Maid&quot;===
The courtesy prefix of &quot;Maid&quot; is granted to the eldest daughter of a Scottish baron. If the eldest daughter is also the heir presumptive she may either hold the title &quot;Younger&quot; or the title &quot;Maid&quot;. The title is customary and not automatically given. The title is placed at the end of the name (for example, Miss Alice Joy, Maid of Newcastle). The holder is addressed as &quot;The Maid of [&quot;Barony&quot;]&quot;.

==Precedence status of courtesy titles==
The courtesy titles and styles of children of peers are social, not legal. For this reason, in official documents, Lord John Smith is often referred to as &quot;John Smith, Esq., commonly called Lord John Smith&quot;; the Hon. Mrs Smith would be called &quot;Mary Jane, Mrs Smith, commonly called the Hon. Mary Jane Smith&quot;. Only peers in attendance at Parliament enjoy statutory precedence. There is, however, official precedence accorded at the Court of St James&#x27;s that results from being the wife or child of a peer, and to which social styles are attached. The wives of peers, however, are peeresses and legally enjoy their titles in exactly the same manner as peeresses in their own right.

Children of peers can outrank certain actual peers. For instance, the daughter of a duke outranks a countess. However, if the daughter of a duke marries an earl, she drops to the rank of countess, because her courtesy title is subsumed in his substantive title; however, if that same daughter marries a commoner, she retains her rank. If that daughter marries the eldest son of an earl, though he may be a courtesy peer, she may keep her rank until the son inherits the earldom, when she must drop to the rank of countess.

==Judicial courtesy titles==
=== College of Justice in Scotland ===
In Scotland, Senators of the College of Justice (the judges of the Court of Session and the High Court of Justiciary as well as the Chairman of the Scottish Land Court) traditionally use the title &quot;Lord&quot; or &quot;Lady&quot; along with a surname or a territorial name. All Senators of the College have the honorific &quot;the Honourable&quot; before their titles, while those who are also Privy Counsellors or peers have the honorific &quot;the Right Honourable&quot;. Senators are made Privy Counsellors upon promotion to the Inner House. 

For example, Alexander Wylie is known as &quot;the Honourable Lord Kinclaven&quot;, while Ronald Mackay is known as &quot;the Right Honourable Lord Eassie&quot;. Some Senators also hold peerage titles, such as the Right Honourable the Lady Clark of Calton, and these would be used in place of judicial titles.

===Supreme Court of the United Kingdom===

On creation of the Supreme Court of the United Kingdom on 1 October 2009, the first Justices already held life peerages as Lords of Appeal in Ordinary, and continued to hold them. The government announced that future appointees would not be created peers. The first non-peer appointed to the Supreme Court was Sir John Dyson, who took office on 19 April 2010. 

By royal warrant dated 10 December 2010, all Justices of the Supreme Court who are not already peers are granted the style &quot;Lord&quot; or &quot;Lady&quot; followed by a surname, territorial designation or a combination of both, for life. This decision avoided any distinction from the Scottish Senators of the College of Justice (see section above). Accordingly, Sir John Dyson is styled &quot;Lord Dyson&quot;. Wives of male Supreme Court justices are styled as if they were wives of peers.

Nicholas Wilson, Lord Wilson of Culworth, appointed to the Supreme Court on 26 May 2011, was the first person to use a territorial name with his judicial courtesy title, adopting reference to Culworth in Northamptonshire.

==Professional courtesy titles==
The title of &quot;Doctor&quot; (or the abbreviation &quot;Dr&quot;) is used as a courtesy title in a number of fields by professionals who do not hold doctoral degrees. It is commonly used in this manner by physicians and dentists, although not surgeons. The Royal College of Veterinary Surgeons also allows the use of &quot;Doctor&quot; as a courtesy title by its members, though they must make clear in writing that they are vets and not physicians of human medicine or holders of academic doctorates to ensure the public are not misled.

The title of &quot;Captain&quot; is used as a courtesy title by shipmasters in the merchant navy who do not hold the military rank of captain. It is also used in oral address for naval officers below the rank of captain who are in command of a ship.

<text>Northern Canada (), colloquially the North or the Territories, is the vast northernmost region of Canada, variously defined by geography and politics. Politically, the term refers to the three territories of Canada: Yukon, Northwest Territories and Nunavut. This area covers about 48 per cent of Canada&#x27;s total land area, but has less than 0.5 per cent of Canada&#x27;s population.

The terms &quot;northern Canada&quot; or &quot;the North&quot; may be used in contrast with &quot;the far north&quot;, which may refer to the Canadian Arctic, the portion of Canada that lies north of the Arctic Circle, east of Alaska and west of Greenland. However, in many other uses the two areas are treated as a single unit.
==Capitals==
The capital cities of the three northern territories, from west to east, are:
* Yukon - Whitehorse
* Northwest Territories - Yellowknife
* Nunavut - Iqaluit

==Definitions==
=== Subdivisions ===
As a social rather than political region, the Canadian North is often subdivided into two distinct regions based on climate, the &quot;near north&quot; and the &quot;far north&quot;. The different climates of these two regions result in vastly different vegetation, and therefore very different economies, settlement patterns and histories.

====Near north====

The &quot;near north&quot; or sub-Arctic is mostly synonymous with the Canadian boreal forest, a large area of evergreen-dominated forests with a subarctic climate. This area has traditionally been home to the Indigenous peoples of the Subarctic, that is the First Nations, who were hunters of moose, freshwater fishers and trappers. This region was heavily involved in the North American fur trade during its peak importance, and is home to many Métis people who originated in that trade. The area was mostly part of Rupert&#x27;s Land under the nominal control of the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company (HBC) from 1670 to 1869, who regarded Rupert&#x27;s Land as their proprietary colony.

In 1670, King Charles II of England in his grant creating the proprietary colony Rupert&#x27;s Land defined its frontiers as all the lands adjudging Hudson Strait, Hudson Bay or rivers flowing into Hudson Bay, in theory giving control of much of what is now Canada to the HBC. Under the royal charter of 2 May 1670, the HBC received the theoretical control of making up 40% of what is now Canada. Despite its claim that Rupert&#x27;s Land was a proprietary colony, the HBC controlled only the areas around its forts (trading posts) on the shores of James Bay and Hudson Bay, and never sought to impose political control on the First Nations peoples, whose co-operation was needed for the fur trade. For its first century, the HBC never ventured inland, being content to have the First Nations peoples come to its forts to trade fur for European goods. The HBC started to move inland only in the late 18th century to assert its claim to Rupert&#x27;s Land in response to rival fur traders coming out of Montreal who were hurting profits by going directly to the First Nations.

The HBC&#x27;s claim to Rupert&#x27;s Land, which, as the company was the de facto administrator, included the North-Western Territory, was purchased by the Canadian government in 1869. After buying Rupert&#x27;s Land, Canada renamed the area it had purchased the Northwest Territories. Shortly thereafter the government made a series of treaties with the local First Nations regarding land title. This opened the region to non-Native settlement, as well as to forestry, mining, and oil and gas drilling. In 1896, gold was discovered in the Yukon, leading to the Klondike Gold Rush in 1896-1899, and the first substantial white settlements were made in the near north. To deal with the increased settlement in the Klondike, the Yukon Territory was created in 1898.

Today several million people live in the near north, around 15% of the Canadian total. Large parts of the near north are not part of Canada&#x27;s territories, but rather are the northern parts of the provinces of Quebec, Ontario, Manitoba, Saskatchewan, and Alberta, meaning they have very different political histories as minority regions within larger units. In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, Canada reduced the size of the Northwest Territory by carving new provinces out of it such as Alberta, Saskatchewan, and Manitoba, together with the new territory of the Yukon, while transferring other parts of the Northwest Territory to Ontario and Quebec.

====Far north====

The &quot;far north&quot; is synonymous with the areas north of the tree line: the Barren Grounds and tundra. This area is home to the various sub-groups of the Inuit, a people unrelated to other Indigenous peoples in Canada. These are people who have traditionally relied mostly on hunting marine mammals and caribou, mainly barren-ground caribou, as well as fish and migratory birds. The Inuit lived in groups that pursued a hunter-gatherer lifestyle, with a basic governmental system in which power was exercised by the local headman, a person acknowledged to be the best hunter, and the angakkuq, sometimes called shamans. This area was somewhat involved in the fur trade, but was more influenced by the whaling industry. Britain maintained a claim to the far north as part of the British Arctic Territories, and in 1880 transferred its claim to Canada, who incorporated the far north into the Northwest Territories.

The Inuit were not aware of the existence of the British Arctic territory claim nor were they aware for some time afterwards that under international law their territories had just been included in Canada. It was not until 1920, when detachments of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) started being sent into the far north to enforce Canadian law, that Canadian sovereignty over the region became effective. This area was not part of the early 20th century treaty process, and aboriginal title to the land has been acknowledged by the Canadian government with the creation of autonomous territories instead of the Indian reserves of further south.

In 1982 a referendum was held to decide on splitting the Northwest Territories. This was followed by the 1992 Nunavut creation referendum, with the majority of the people in the far north voting to leave the Northwest Territories, leading to creation of the new territory of Nunavut in 1999. Very few non-Indigenous people have settled in these areas, and the residents of the far north represent less than 1% of Canada&#x27;s total population.

The far north is also often broken into western and eastern parts and sometimes a central part. The eastern Arctic includes the self-governing territory of Nunavut (much of which is in the true Arctic, being north of the Arctic Circle), sometimes excluding Cambridge Bay and Kugluktuk; Nunavik, an autonomous part of the province of Quebec; Nunatsiavut, an autonomous part of the province of Newfoundland and Labrador; and perhaps a few parts of the Hudson Bay coast of Ontario and Manitoba. The western Arctic is the northernmost portion of the Northwest Territories (roughly Inuvik Region) and a small part of Yukon, together called the Inuvialuit Settlement Region, and sometimes includes Cambridge Bay and Kugluktuk. The central Arctic covers the pre-division Kitikmeot Region, Northwest Territories.
===Territoriality===
Since 1925, Canada has claimed the portion of the Arctic between 60°W and 141°W longitude, extending all the way north to the North Pole: All islands in the Arctic Archipelago and Herschel, off the Yukon coast, form part of the region and are Canadian territory, and the territorial waters claimed by Canada surround these islands. Views of territorial claims in this region are complicated by disagreements on legal principles. Canada and the Soviet Union/Russia have long claimed that their territory extends according to the sector principle to the North Pole. The United States does not accept the sector principle and does not make a sector claim based on its Alaskan Arctic coast. Claims that undersea geographic features are extensions of a country&#x27;s continental shelf are also used to support claims; for example the Denmark/Greenland claim on territory to the North Pole, some of which is disputed by Canada.

Foreign ships, both civilian and military, are allowed the right of innocent passage through the territorial waters of a littoral state subject to conditions in the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea. The right of innocent passage is not allowed, however, in internal waters, which are enclosed bodies of water or waters landward of a chain of islands. Disagreements about the sector principle or extension of territory to the North Pole and about the definition of internal waters in the Arctic lie behind differences in territorial claims in the Arctic. This claim is recognized by most countries with some exceptions, including the United States; Denmark, Russia, and Norway have made claims similar to those of Canada in the Arctic and are opposed by the European Union and the United States. This is especially important with the Northwest Passage, which Canada asserts control of as part of Canadian Internal Waters because it is within of Canadian islands; however, the United States claims that it is in international waters. As of 2023, ice and freezing temperatures have always made this a minor issue, but climate change may make the passage more accessible to shipping. Furthermore, the thawing of the polar ice cap increases the mutual proximity of Canada and Russia as a result of the historically unusable Arctic Ocean becoming increasingly navigable.

==Demographics==

Using the political definition of the three northern territories, the north, with an area of , makes up 39.3% of Canada.

Although vast, the entire region is very sparsely populated. As of 2021, only about 118,160 people lived there, compared with 36,991,981 in the rest of Canada.

The population density for Northern Canada is ( for Yukon, for the NWT and for Nunavut), compared with for Canada.

The region is heavily endowed with natural resources, but in most cases they are very expensive to extract and situated in fragile environmental areas. Though GDP per person is higher than elsewhere in Canada, the region remains relatively poor, mostly because of the extremely high cost of most consumer goods, and the region is heavily subsidised by the government of Canada.

As of 2016, 53.3% of the population of the three territories (23.3% in Yukon, 50.7% in the NWT and 85.9% in Nunavut) is Indigenous, Inuit, First Nations or Métis. The Inuit are the largest group of Indigenous peoples in Northern Canada, and 53.0% of all Canada&#x27;s Inuit live in Northern Canada, with Nunavut accounting for 46.4%. The region also contains several groups of First Nations, who are mainly Dene, with the Chipewyan making up the largest sub-group. The three territories each have a greater proportion of Aboriginal inhabitants than any of Canada&#x27;s provinces. There are also many more recent immigrants from around the world; of the territories, Yukon has the largest percentage of non-Aboriginal inhabitants, while Nunavut the smallest.

, the largest settlement in Northern Canada is Whitehorse, the capital of Yukon, with 28,201 inhabitants. Second is Yellowknife, the capital of the Northwest Territories, which contains 20,340 inhabitants. Third is Iqaluit, the capital of Nunavut, with 7,429.

===Recent===
Although it has not been on the same scale, some towns and cities have experienced population increases not seen for several decades before. Yellowknife has become the centre of diamond production for Canada (which has become one of the top three countries for diamonds).

In the 2006 Canadian Census, the three territories posted a combined population of over 100,000 for the first time in Canadian history.

==Topography (geography)==
While the largest part of the Arctic is composed of permanent ice and the Canadian Arctic tundra north of the tree line, it encompasses geological regions of varying types: The Innuitian Mountains, associated with the Arctic Cordillera mountain system, are geologically distinct from the Arctic Region (which consists largely of lowlands). The Arctic and Hudson Bay Lowlands comprise a substantial part of the geographic region often considered part of the Canadian Shield (in contrast to the sole geological area). The ground in the Arctic is mostly composed of permafrost, making construction difficult and often hazardous, and agriculture virtually impossible.

The Arctic watershed (or drainage basin) drains northern parts of Manitoba, Alberta and British Columbia, most of the Northwest Territories and Nunavut, and parts of Yukon into the Arctic Ocean, including the Beaufort Sea and Baffin Bay. With the exception of the Mackenzie River, Canada&#x27;s longest river, this watershed has been little used for hydroelectricity. The Peace and Athabasca rivers, along with Great Bear and Great Slave Lake (respectively the largest and second largest lakes wholly enclosed within Canada), are significant elements of the Arctic watershed. Each of these elements eventually merges with the Mackenzie so that it thereby drains the vast majority of the Arctic watershed.

===Climate===

====Overview====
Under the Köppen climate classification, much of mainland Northern Canada has a subarctic climate, with a tundra climate in most of the Arctic Archipelago and on the northern coasts, and an ice cap climate in some parts of the Arctic Cordillera. For more than half of the year, much of Northern Canada is snow- and ice-covered, with some limited moderation by the relatively warmer waters in coastal areas, with temperatures generally remaining below the freezing mark from October to May. During the coldest three months, mean monthly temperatures range from in the southern sections to in the northern sections, although temperatures can go down to . Owing to the dry cold air prevalent throughout most of the region, snowfall is often light. During the short summers, much of Northern Canada is snow free, except for the Arctic Cordillera, which remains covered with snow and ice throughout the year. In the summer months, temperatures average below but may occasionally exceed . Most of the rainfall accumulated occurs in the summer months, ranging from in the northernmost islands to at the southern end of Baffin Island.

Northern Canada&#x27;s coastline has faced significant changes due to climate change. The annual precipitation as well as the ratio of snow to rain have increased since 1950. Sea ice has decreased in the region, leading to higher summer surface air temperatures. In the Canadian Arctic Archipelago sea ice cover decreased by 2.9% per decade from 1968 to 2008, while in Hudson Bay this decreased by 11.3% per decade. Storms in the Arctic have increased and become more intense.

== Politics ==

=== Federal politics ===
The northern territories are represented in the Parliament of Canada by 3 Members of Parliament (MPs) in the House of Commons (1 from each territory) and 3 senators (1 from each territory). Currently, of the 3 northern MPs in the Commons, 2 are Liberals and the New Democrats hold 1.

<text>Knidos or Cnidus (; , , , Knídos) was a Greek city in ancient Caria and part of the Dorian Hexapolis, in south-western Asia Minor, modern-day Turkey. It was situated on the Datça peninsula, which forms the southern side of the Sinus Ceramicus, now known as Gulf of Gökova. By the 4th century BC, Knidos was located at the site of modern Tekir, opposite Triopion Island. But earlier, it was probably at the site of modern Datça (at the half-way point of the peninsula).

It was built partly on the mainland and partly on the Island of Triopion or Cape Krio. The debate about it being an island or cape is caused by the fact that in ancient times it was connected to the mainland by a causeway and bridge. Today the connection is formed by a narrow sandy isthmus. By means of the causeway the channel between island and mainland was formed into two harbours, of which the larger, or southern, was further enclosed by two strongly built moles that are still in good part entire.

The extreme length of the city was little less than a mile, and the whole intramural area is still thickly strewn with architectural remains. The walls, both of the island and on the mainland, can be traced throughout their whole circuit; and in many places, especially round the acropolis, at the northeast corner of the city, they are remarkably perfect.

==History==
===Antiquity===
Knidos was a Hellenic city of high antiquity. According to Herodotus&#x27; &quot;Histories&quot; (I.174), the Cnidians were Lacedaemonian colonists; however, the presence of demiurges there argues for foundation or later influence by other Doric Greeks, possibly Argives. Diodorus Siculus (Bibliotheca Historica 5.53) claimed that Cnidus was founded by both Lacedaemonians and Argives. Along with Halicarnassus (present day Bodrum, Turkey) and Kos, and the Rhodian cities of Lindos, Kamiros and Ialyssos it formed the Dorian Hexapolis, which held its confederate assemblies on the Triopian headland, and there celebrated games in honour of Apollo, Poseidon and the nymphs. This was also the site of the Temple of Aphrodite, Knidos.

The city was at first governed by an oligarchic senate, composed of sixty members, and presided over by a magistrate; but, though it is proved by inscriptions that the old names continued to a very late period, the constitution underwent a popular transformation. The situation of the city was favourable for commerce, and the Knidians acquired considerable wealth, and were able to colonize the island of Lipara, and founded a city on Corcyra Nigra in the Adriatic. They ultimately submitted to Cyrus, and from the battle of Eurymedon to the latter part of the Peloponnesian War they were subject to Athens. During the Hellenistic age, Knidos boasted a medical school; however, the theory that this school already existed at the beginning of the classical age is an unwarranted extrapolation.

In their expansion into the region, the Romans easily obtained the allegiance of Knidians, and rewarded them for help given against Antiochus III the Great by leaving them the freedom of their city.

Eudoxus, the astronomer, Ctesias, the writer on Persian history, and Sostratus, the builder of the celebrated Pharos at Alexandria, are the most remarkable of the Knidians mentioned in history. Artemidorus, a minor character in the Shakespeare play &quot;Julius Caesar&quot;, was also from Knidos.

===Byzantine era===
During the Byzantine period there must still have been a considerable population: for the ruins contain a large number of buildings belonging to the Byzantine style, and Christian sepulchres are common in the neighbourhood.

Bishop Ioannes of Cnidus took part in the Council of Chalcedon in 451 CE and was one of the signatories of the letter that in 458 the bishops of the Roman province of Caria, to which Cnidus belonged, wrote to Byzantine Emperor Leo I the Thracian after the murder of Proterius of Alexandria. Bishop Evander was at the Second Council of Constantinople in 553 and Bishop Stauratius at the Second Council of Nicaea in 787. No longer a residential bishopric, Cnidus is today listed by the Catholic Church as a titular see.

==Excavation history==

The first Western knowledge of the modern site was due to the mission of the Dilettante Society in 1812, and the excavations executed by C. T. Newton in 1857–1858.

The agora, the theatre, an odeum, a temple of Dionysus, a temple of the Muses, a temple of Aphrodite and a great number of minor buildings have been identified, and the general plan of the city has been very clearly made out. The most famous statue by Praxiteles, the Aphrodite of Knidos, was made for Cnidus. It has perished, but late copies exist, of which the most faithful is in the Vatican Museums.

In a temple enclosure Newton discovered the fine seated statue of Demeter of Knidos, which he sent back to the British Museum, and about three miles south-east of the city he came upon the ruins of a splendid tomb, and a colossal figure of a lion carved out of one block of Pentelic marble, ten feet in length and six in height, which has been supposed to commemorate the great naval victory, the Battle of Cnidus in which Conon defeated the Lacedaemonians in 394 BC. The Knidos Lion is now displayed under the roof of the Great Court in the British Museum.

In 2022, the low tide revealed ruins of an ancient port near the site which is believed to have been the port of Knidos.

<text>Wyvill Richard Nicolls Raynsford (born 28 January 1945), known as Nick Raynsford, is a British politician who served as a government minister from 1997 to 2005. A member of the Labour Party, he was Member of Parliament (MP) for Greenwich and Woolwich, formerly Greenwich, from 1992 to 2015, having previously been MP for Fulham from 1986 to 1987.

Raised in Northamptonshire, Raynsford was educated at Repton School. He studied History at Sidney Sussex College, Cambridge, where he was involved in opposing the Vietnam War. After serving as a councillor in Hammersmith and Fulham and director of the Shelter Housing Aid Centre, he was elected at a 1986 by-election and served as an MP for a year until losing his seat at the subsequent general election. 

Raynsford returned to Parliament at the 1992 general election and joined the government under the premiership of Tony Blair; his roles included Minister of State for Housing and Planning, Minister for London and Minister of State for Local and Regional Government. He stood down from the House of Commons prior to the 2015 general election, after which he went into the public sector advising on planning and construction.

==Early life and education==
The son of Wyvill Raynsford and Patricia Raynsford (née Dunn), Raynsford was brought up at Milton Manor in Milton Malsor, Northamptonshire. He was privately educated at Repton School and Sidney Sussex College, Cambridge, where he graduated with a BA degree in History in 1966. At Cambridge, he was rusticated for a year after a night climbing incident in which he had displayed a banner against the Vietnam War between the pinnacles of King&#x27;s College Chapel. He also has a Diploma in Art and Design from the Chelsea School of Art.

== Political career ==

=== Councillor: 1971–1975 ===
Raynsford was a councillor for the London Borough of Hammersmith and Fulham from 1971 to 1975. Before he was elected to Parliament, he was director of the Shelter Housing Aid Centre. He says a major reason he chose to seek parliamentary office was his involvement in campaigning for better provision for the homeless, achieved through the 1977 Homeless Persons Act. The 1977 Act extended local council responsibility &quot;to provide accommodation for homeless people in their area,&quot; and instituted the right of homeless families to a permanent local council tenancy.

=== Early parliamentary career: 1986–1997 ===
Raynsford was first elected a member of parliament (MP) for the Labour Party in a 1986 by-election for Fulham, but at the 1987 general election, lost to Conservative candidate Matthew Carrington. He then became MP for Greenwich at the 1992 general election, and at the 1997 general election, he won the re-drawn seat of Greenwich and Woolwich. He retained the seat at the 2001, 2005 and 2010 general elections, with majorities of 13,433, 10,146 and 10,153 respectively.

In opposition, Raynsford was Shadow Minister for Housing and Construction from 1994, and frontbench spokesperson for London from 1993. From 1992 to 1993, he was a member of the Environment Select Committee.

=== Ministerial career: 1997–2005 ===
Raynsford joined the government in 1997 and held responsibility for construction, housing, planning and the regions. During this time, he was responsible for the implementation of the Decent Homes Standard. In 1997, there were 2.1m houses owned by local authorities and housing associations that did not meet the Decent Homes Standard. By the end of 2010, 92% of social housing met the standard of being warm and weatherproof with reasonably modern facilities.

As the government minister responsible for construction, Raynsford was credited with introducing building regulations which significantly improved standards, including making mandatory disabled access in new builds, increasing energy efficiency standards and fire safety. His position also included responsibility for the Fire Service and the creation of the London Resilience Forum to oversee London&#x27;s preparedness for dealing with emergencies (see Operation Sassoon). As a local government minister, he led the Local Government Act 2000 through Parliament, which repealed the controversial Section 28.

As Minister for London from 2001 to 2003, Raynsford was responsible for restoring democratic citywide government to London, and the creation of the Greater London Authority and the commission of its home at City Hall.

=== Later parliamentary career: 2005–2015 ===
After the 2005 general election, Raynsford returned to the backbenches. In June 2009, he publicly called for Gordon Brown to resign as Prime Minister, stating at the time, &quot;I personally have considerable respect for Gordon Brown but his leadership is now so seriously damaged that I can&#x27;t see the likelihood of him leading Labour successfully into the next general election. It&#x27;s now appropriate for the party to look for a new leader&quot;.

On 28 March 2010, &quot;The Sunday Times&quot; reported that Raynsford earned £9,000 per month from jobs in industries connected to his ministerial career. They focused around three areas of activity – housing, construction and local government – with which Raynsford has been involved throughout his working life.

In opposition again in the 2010–15 Parliament, Raynsford was a consistent critic of the bedroom tax, and in July 2014 co-sponsored the Affordable Homes Bill, which sought to limit the impact of the bedroom tax on tenants in the social rented sector. He also co-chaired a parliamentary inquiry into youth unemployment which encouraged the promotion of apprenticeships in the construction industry.

As a constituency MP, Raynsford promoted regeneration in the Greenwich Borough, including campaigns for the North Greenwich Station on the Jubilee Line, the extension of the DLR to Greenwich and Woolwich, and the campaign to secure a Crossrail Station in Woolwich, and support for bringing the Olympics to his constituency. He also advocated improved river crossings in East and South East London. In May 2014, he expressed his opposition to a memorial to murdered soldier Lee Rigby, suggesting it &quot;would not in my view be helpful&quot; because it &quot;might attract undesirable interest from extremists&quot;. Greenwich Council noted they had been &quot;overwhelmed by interest in a local memorial&quot;, but also opposed the tribute.

In March 2013, Raynsford announced his intention to stand down as MP for Greenwich and Woolwich at the next general election and cited his age as the reason behind his decision.

== Later career ==
Raynsford remains involved with UK construction. He is chair of CICAIR Ltd, a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Construction Industry Council. He is a board member of the Construction Industry Council and he chaired the group from 2006 to 2008. The group maintains and operates the Approved Inspectors Register regulating approved inspectors qualified to undertake building control work. From January 2019 until his resignation in September 2020, he was deputy chairman of Crossrail Limited. He has remained involved with Crossrail, acting as a strategic advisor since 2020.

==Personal life==
Raynsford married Anne Jelley in 1968, and they had three daughters. They were divorced in 2011, and he is now the husband of Alison Seabeck, the former Labour MP for Plymouth Moor View. Raynsford&#x27;s ancestry can be seen in Burke&#x27;s Landed Gentry.
