<text>U.S. Route 1 or U.S. Highway 1 (US 1) is a major north–south United States Numbered Highway that serves the East Coast of the United States. It runs from Key West, Florida, north to Fort Kent, Maine, at the Canadian border, making it the longest north–south road in the United States. US 1 is generally paralleled by Interstate 95 (I-95), though US 1 is significantly farther west and inland between Jacksonville, Florida, and Petersburg, Virginia, while I-95 is closer to the coastline. In contrast, US 1 in Maine is much closer to the coast than I-95, which runs farther inland than US 1. The route connects most of the major cities of the East Coast from the Southeastern United States to New England, including Miami, Jacksonville, Augusta, Columbia, Raleigh, Richmond, Washington, D.C., Baltimore, Philadelphia, Newark, New York City, New Haven, Providence, Boston, and Portland.

While US 1 is generally the easternmost of the main north–south U.S. Routes, parts of several others occupy corridors closer to the ocean. When the road system was laid out in the 1920s, US 1 was mostly assigned to the existing Atlantic Highway, which followed the Atlantic Seaboard Fall Line between the Piedmont and the Atlantic Plain north of Augusta, Georgia. At the time, the highways farther east were of lower quality and did not serve the major population centers. From Henderson, North Carolina, to Petersburg, Virginia, it is paralleled by I-85. Construction of the Interstate Highway System gradually changed the use and character of US 1, and I-95 became the major north–south East Coast highway by the late 1960s.

===Florida===

US 1 travels along the east coast of Florida, beginning at 490 Whitehead Street in Key West and passing through Miami, Hollywood, Fort Lauderdale, Boca Raton, West Palm Beach, Jupiter, Fort Pierce, Melbourne, Cocoa, Titusville, Daytona Beach, Palm Coast, St. Augustine, and Jacksonville. The southernmost piece through the chain islands of the Florida Keys, about long, is the two-lane Overseas Highway, originally built in the late 1930s after railroad tycoon Henry Flagler&#x27;s Florida East Coast Railway&#x27;s Overseas Railroad, which was built between 1905 and 1912 on stone pillars, was ruined by the 1935 Labor Day hurricane. The rest of US 1 in Florida is generally a four-lane divided highway, despite the existence of the newer I-95 not far away. Famous vacation scenic route State Road A1A is a continuous oceanfront alternate to US 1 that runs along the beaches of the Atlantic Ocean, cut only by assorted unbridged inlets and the Kennedy Space Center at Cape Canaveral. North of Jacksonville, US 1 turns northwest toward Augusta, Georgia; US 17 becomes the coastal route into Virginia, where US 13 takes over. In Florida until the 1990s, US 1 used high-contrast markers (white text on a red background).

===Georgia===

The part of US 1 in Georgia, as it shifts from the coastal alignment in Florida to the Atlantic Seaboard Fall Line alignment in South Carolina, is generally very rural, passing through marshes and former plantations between the towns and cities of Folkston, Waycross, Alma, Baxley, Lyons, Swainsboro, and Augusta. The Georgia Department of Transportation has an ongoing plan to widen all of US 1 to four lanes with bypasses, which is more than 50 percent complete.

===The Carolinas===

In South Carolina, US 1 generally serves mostly rural areas as it falls west of I-95 while the coastal areas are served by routes east of it. Starting in South Carolina, US 1 is paralleled by I-20 along the Atlantic Seaboard Fall Line through Aiken, Lexington, and Columbia to Camden and Lugoff. US 1 functions as a local two-lane road with occasional boulevard stretches. After Camden, US 1 continues northeast away from any Interstate toward Bethune, Patrick, McBee, and Cheraw with no bypasses or four-lane sections except around Cheraw through the US 52 and South Carolina Highway 9 (SC 9) concurrencies. After SC 9, it continues northward into North Carolina as a two -lane highway. The South Carolina Department of Transportation (SCDOT) has no plans to widen or bypass any US 1 alignments northeast of Camden to the North Carolina line.

Between the South Carolina line and the US 74 bypass, US 1 is a two-lane road but sees a considerable amount of truck and tourist traffic of people cutting through from the US 74/US 220 and I-73/I-74 corridor attempting to reach points south and east. US 1 goes through downtown Rockingham, with a bypass in the future plans. North of the North Carolina Highway 177 (NC 177) junction, it becomes four lanes or greater, becoming a superstreet with limited access and then becoming a limited access freeway. US 1 becomes a major artery for the state as it moves north of Rockingham. After Richmond County, it goes into Moore County with two expressway bypasses in Southern Pines, Vass, and Cameron. US 1 continues with the Jefferson Davis Highway label through Lee County and Sanford, and on to Cary and Raleigh. US 1 runs concurrently with US 64 through most of Cary, where the freeway recently underwent a major renovation and improvements that added lanes in both directions. North of Raleigh, US 1 (known as Capital Boulevard in northern Wake County) crosses I-540 and then again becomes a four-lane divided arterial to I-85 near Henderson. The North Carolina Department of Transportation (NCDOT) has begun a corridor study for this section of US 1. Moreover, NCDOT is planning to finish four-laning US 1 in Richmond County past NC 177 with a Rockingham bypass to the east. There are no plans from SCDOT to widen US 1 from the state line. From Henderson into Virginia, US 1 runs parallel with I-85 as a two-lane local road until the state line, where Virginia hosts a continuous third center lane for alternate passing toward US 58 before South Hill.

===Mid-Atlantic===
In the Mid-Atlantic, US 1 generally serves some of the most populated areas of the east coast. Through Virginia, US 1 is paralleled by Interstates: the remainder of I-85 to Petersburg, I-95 through Richmond and Fredericksburg to Alexandria, and I-395 into Arlington. In much of Virginia, US 1 was called the Jefferson Davis Highway by state law, although there are exceptions. South of Petersburg, it is known as Boydton Plank Road. Through some of Fairfax County and Alexandria, it is called the Richmond Highway. In February 2021, Virginia renamed all remaining portions of the Jefferson Davis Highway in the state to Emancipation Highway beginning on January 1, 2022.

US 1 crosses the Potomac River with I-395 on the 14th Street bridges and splits to follow mainly 14th Street and Rhode Island Avenue through the District of Columbia. US 1 is at the minimum of three lanes (with alternate passing) from the North Carolina state line to Petersburg with occasional four-lane divided sections. North of Petersburg is a four-lane undivided roadway at the minimum to the DC line. The route of US 1 from Petersburg to the state line is parallel with the Atlantic Seaboard Fall Line. From Petersburg onward, it is parallel with I-95. After exiting DC into Maryland, US 1 follows the Baltimore–Washington Boulevard, the first of several modern highways built along the Washington–Baltimore combined statistical area corridor; I-95 is the newest, after the Baltimore–Washington Parkway. US 1 runs through the University of Maryland, College Park, campus in College Park, Maryland. The route bypasses Downtown Baltimore on North Avenue and exits the city to the northeast on Belair Road, gradually leaving the I-95 corridor, which passes through Wilmington, Delaware, for a straighter path toward Philadelphia. Around and beyond Bel Air, US 1 is a two-lane road, crossing the Susquehanna River over the top of the Conowingo Dam before entering Pennsylvania. (Routed further north, US 1 bypasses the state of Delaware, unlike I-95.)

The two-lane US 1 becomes a four-lane expressway, officially known as the John H. Ware III Memorial Highway, after the Pennsylvania representative, just after crossing into Pennsylvania. This bypass extends around Oxford and Kennett Square, merging into the four-lane divided Baltimore Pike just beyond the latter. At Media, US 1 again becomes a freeway—the Media Bypass—ending just beyond I-476. After several name changes, the road becomes City Avenue, the western city limits of Philadelphia, at the end of which a short overlap with I-76 leads to the Roosevelt Expressway and then the 12-lane Roosevelt Boulevard partly overlapping US 13. US 1 again becomes a freeway after leaving the city, bypassing Penndel and Morrisville and crossing the Delaware River into New Jersey on the Trenton–Morrisville Toll Bridge.

After crossing into New Jersey in Mercer County, US 1 continues on the Trenton Freeway through the state capital of Trenton and Lawrence Township as a four-lane freeway. As the freeway ends, the four-lane divided highway upgrades to six lanes north of I-295 passing through the Penns Neck section of West Windsor. Through Penns Neck is a series of traffic signals. The New Jersey Department of Transportation (NJDOT) is looking to revamp the highway through this area by replacing traffic signals with grade separations. The highway enters Middlesex County through Plainsboro Township and South Brunswick, where the highest point resides. By Forrestal Village, the highway downgrades from six to four lanes until after Finnegans Lane in North Brunswick. Northward, it continues through New Brunswick as a short limited-access highway until the County Route 529 (CR 529)/Plainfield Avenue traffic signal in Edison. Through Edison and Woodbridge Township, US 1 has a mix of boulevard and limited-access segments and continues to do so after the US 9 juncture in the Avenel section of Woodbridge. The US 1/9 concurrency continues through the rest of the state. The six-lane divided highway remains through Rahway in Union County and Elizabeth, until it reaches Newark Liberty International Airport, where it becomes a dual carriageway freeway around downtown Newark in Essex County with a 2–2–2–2 configuration. The historic Pulaski Skyway takes US 1/9 into Jersey City, and the route exits the freeway at the Tonnele Circle to head north into Bergen County. US 1/9 turns onto US 46 as a limited-access highway, and the three routes run northeast to the George Washington Bridge Plaza, where they merge into I-95. US 46 ends in the middle of the bridge, which crosses the Hudson River into New York, and US 9 exits just beyond onto Broadway in Manhattan, but US 1 stays with I-95 onto the Cross Bronx Expressway, exiting in the Bronx onto Webster Avenue. Two turns take US 1 via Fordham Road to Boston Road, which it follows northeast out of the city, becoming Boston Post Road in Westchester County, never straying far from I-95. From the Bronx to the state line, it is a local road with two lanes in each direction, except in Rye where it has a single lane in each direction. As it enters Greenwich, Connecticut, it continues as a two-lane local road.

===New England===
In New England, US 1 generally serves large cities in a side street capacity. In Connecticut, US 1 serves the shore of Long Island Sound parallel to I-95. Beyond New Haven, the highway travels east–west, and some signs in the state indicate this rather than the standard north–south. While I-95 in Rhode Island takes a diagonal path to Providence, US 1 continues east along the coast through Westerly to Wakefield-Peacedale, where it turns north and follows Narragansett Bay. Most of this part is a four-lane limited-access highway, providing access to Route 138 toward Newport. After Route 4 splits as a mostly-freeway connection to I-95, US 1 becomes a lower-speed surface road, passing through Warwick, Providence, and Pawtucket. The route parallels I-95 again through Providence and Pawtucket and into Massachusetts, traveling toward Boston as a four-lane road. When it reaches Dedham, US 1 turns east and becomes a freeway through metropolitan Boston, concurrent with I-95 and I-93 east to Braintree and north through Downtown Boston. The Tobin Bridge and Northeast Expressway take US 1 out of Boston, after which it again parallels I-95 as a high-speed surface road through Newburyport to the New Hampshire state line.

The short portion of US 1 in New Hampshire follows the historic Lafayette Road, staying close to I-95, passing through Portsmouth before crossing the Piscataqua River on Memorial Bridge, which was demolished and replaced during 2012–2013, leaving a temporary gap in US 1. During construction, drivers had to detour to one of two other nearby bridges carrying US 1 Bypass or I-95. Within Maine, US 1 begins as a parallel route to I-95 near the Atlantic Ocean. At Portland, I-95 splits off to the north, and I-295 heads northeast paralleling US 1 to Brunswick. There US 1 turns east as a mostly two-lane road along the coast to Calais; much of this portion is advertised as the &quot;Coastal Route&quot; on signs. North from Calais, US 1 follows the Canadian border, crossing I-95 in Houlton and eventually turning west and southwest to its &quot;north&quot; end at the Clair–Fort Kent Bridge in Fort Kent. The short Route 161 extends north on the New Brunswick (Canada) side of the bridge to Route 120, a secondary east–west route from Edmundston, New Brunswick, west to Quebec Route 289 toward Saint-Alexandre-de-Kamouraska, Quebec.

==History==

The direct predecessor to US 1 was the Atlantic Highway, an auto trail established in 1911 as the Quebec–Miami International Highway. In 1915, it was renamed the Atlantic Highway, and the northern terminus was changed to Calais, Maine. Due to the overlapping of auto trail designations, portions of the route had other names that remain in common use, such as the Boston Post Road between Boston and New York City, the Lincoln Highway between New York and Philadelphia, the Baltimore Pike between Philadelphia and Baltimore, and the Dixie Highway in and south of eastern Georgia. North of Augusta, Georgia, the highway generally followed the Atlantic Seaboard Fall Line, rather than a more easterly route through the swamps of the Atlantic Plain. Brickell Avenue is the name given to the stretch of US 1 in Miami, Florida, just south of the Miami River until the Rickenbacker Causeway.

When the New England road marking system was established in 1922, the Atlantic Highway within New England was signed as Route 1, with a Route 24 continuing north to Madawaska; New York extended the number to New York City in 1924 with its own Route 1. Other states adopted their own systems of numbering; by 1926 all states but Maryland had signed the Atlantic Highway as various routes, usually changing numbers at the state line. In 1925, the Joint Board on Interstate Highways created a preliminary list of interstate routes to be marked by the states, including US 1 along the Atlantic. This highway began at Fort Kent, Maine, and followed the existing Route 24 to Houlton, as well as Route 15 to Bangor, beyond which it generally followed the Atlantic Highway to Miami. In all states but Georgia that had numbered their state highways, Route 1 followed only one or two numbers across the state. The only significant deviation from the Atlantic Highway was between Augusta, Georgia, and Jacksonville, Florida, where Route 1 was assigned to a more inland route, rather than following the Atlantic Highway via Savannah.

One of the many changes made to the system before the final numbering was adopted in 1926 involved US 1 in Maine. The 1925 plan had assigned US 1 to the shorter inland route (Route 15) between Houlton and Bangor, while US 2 followed the longer coastal route via Calais. In the system as adopted in 1926, US 2 instead took the inland route, while US 1 followed the coast, absorbing all of the former Route 24 and Route 1 in New England. Many local and regional relocations, often onto parallel superhighways, were made in the early days of US 1; this included the four-lane divided Route 25 in New Jersey, completed in 1932 with the opening of the Pulaski Skyway, and a bypass of Bangor involving the Waldo–Hancock Bridge, opened in 1931. The Overseas Highway from Miami to Key West was completed in 1938 and soon became a southern extension of US 1.

With the construction of the Interstate Highway System in and after the 1950s, much of US 1 from Houlton to Miami was bypassed by I-95. Between Houlton and Brunswick, Maine, I-95 took a shorter inland route, much of it paralleling US 2 on the alignment proposed for US 1 in 1925. Between Philadelphia and Baltimore, I-95 leaves US 1 to pass through Wilmington. Most notably, I-95 and US 1 follow different corridors between Petersburg, Virginia, and Jacksonville, Florida; while US 1 followed the Atlantic Seaboard Fall Line west of the coastal plain, I-95 takes a more direct route through the plain and its swamps. Although some of this part of US 1 was followed by other Interstates—I-85 between Petersburg and Henderson, North Carolina, and I-20 between Camden, South Carolina, and Augusta, Georgia—the rest remains an independent route with four lanes in many places. By the late 1970s, most of I-95 had been completed, replacing US 1 as the main corridor of the east coast and relegating most of it to local road status.

==Auxiliary routes==

US 1 has six three-digit auxiliary routes. In numerical order, these are:

*US 201, from Brunswick, Maine, to the Armstrong–Jackman Border Crossing running south to north in east-central Maine.
*US 301, from Sarasota, Florida, to Biddles Corner, Delaware, along the East Coast. Most of the route closely parallels I-95 and it has numerous intersections with its parent.
*US 401 from Sumter, South Carolina, to Wise, North Carolina, near the Virginia border. For most of the route, it parallels US 1 about to the east, though the two share pavement in Raleigh, North Carolina.
*US 501 from Myrtle Beach, South Carolina, to Buena Vista, Virginia. The highway runs southeast–northwest, meeting its parent in Aberdeen and Sanford.
*US 601 from Tarboro, South Carolina, to Mount Airy, North Carolina. It runs mostly due south–north to the west of US 501, meeting the parent route in Camden, South Carolina.
*US 701 from Georgetown, South Carolina, to Four Oaks, North Carolina. Furthest east of the US 1 auxiliary routes, it never meets its parent route, but does intersect US 501 in Conway, South Carolina, and terminates at US 301 at its northern end.

US 101, despite its number, is not an auxiliary route, but rather considered a primary U.S. Route in its own right as major highway west of the former US 99 on the west coast of the U.S. (In the numbering scheme, its first &quot;digit&quot; is &quot;10&quot;.)

==In popular culture==
* The route in Richard Bachman&#x27;s horror novel, &quot;The Long Walk&quot; (1979), begins each year at the Maine–New Brunswick border at 9:00 on the morning of May 1 and travels down the East Coast of the United States, along US 1, until the winner is determined.
*The Atlantic Highway features prominently as both a location, and a character in Seanan McGuire&#x27;s Ghost Roads series.

<text>State Route 1 (SR 1) is a major north–south state highway that runs along most of the Pacific coastline of the U.S. state of California. At , it is the longest state route in California, and the second-longest in the US after Montana Highway 200. SR 1 has several portions designated as either Pacific Coast Highway (PCH), Cabrillo Highway, Shoreline Highway, or Coast Highway. Its southern terminus is at Interstate 5 (I-5) near Dana Point in Orange County and its northern terminus is at U.S. Route 101 (US 101) near Leggett in Mendocino County. SR 1 also at times runs concurrently with US 101, most notably through a stretch in Ventura and Santa Barbara counties, and across the Golden Gate Bridge.

The highway is designated as an All-American Road. In addition to providing a scenic route to numerous attractions along the coast, the route also serves as a major thoroughfare in the Greater Los Angeles Area, the San Francisco Bay Area, and several other coastal urban areas.

SR 1 was built piecemeal in various stages, with the first section opening in the Big Sur region in the 1930s. However, portions of the route had several names and numbers over the years as more segments opened. It was not until the 1964 state highway renumbering that the entire route was officially designated as SR 1. Although SR 1 is a popular route for its scenery, frequent landslides and erosion along the coast have caused several segments to be either closed for lengthy periods for repairs, or re-routed inland.

==Route description== 
Due to its fragmented nature and piecemeal relinquishments, the California Streets and Highways Code defines Route 1 across several subdivisions of section 301 as follows:
Route 1 is from:

(a) Route 5 south of San Juan Capistrano to Route 101 near El Rio except for the portions of Route 1 relinquished:
(1) Within the city limits of the City of Dana Point between the western edge of the San Juan Creek Bridge and Eastline Road at the city limits of the City of Laguna Beach.(2) Within the city limits of the City of Newport Beach between Jamboree Road and Newport Coast Drive.(3) Within the city limits of the City of Santa Monica between the southern city limits and Route 10.(4) Within the city limits of the City of Oxnard between Pleasant Valley Road and Route 101.
(b) Route 101 at Emma Wood State Beach, 1.3 miles north of Route 33, to Route 101, 2.8 miles south of the Ventura-Santa Barbara county line at Mobil Pier Undercrossing.(c) Route 101 near Las Cruces to Route 101 in Pismo Beach via the vicinity of Lompoc, Vandenberg Air Force Base, and Guadalupe.(d) Route 101 in San Luis Obispo to Route 280 south of San Francisco along the coast via Cambria, San Simeon, and Santa Cruz.(e) Route 280 near the south boundary of the City and County of San Francisco to Route 101 near the approach to the Golden Gate Bridge in San Francisco.(f) Route 101 near the southerly end of Marin Peninsula to Route 101 near Leggett via the coast route through Jenner and Westport.

In addition to the relinquished portions listed under subdivision (a), sections 301 subdivision (h), 301.1, 301.3 and 301.5 of the code permit the state to relinquish select or all portions of Route 1 in the cities of Los Angeles, Torrance, Newport Beach and Pismo Beach respectively. AB 2817, approved in September 2024 and effective in 2025, amends the code to add section 301.4, allowing the state to relinquish a segment in Laguna Beach.

SR 1 is part of the California Freeway and Expressway System, and through the Los Angeles metro area, Monterey, Santa Cruz, and San Francisco metro area is part of the National Highway System, a network of highways that are considered essential to the country&#x27;s economy, defense, and mobility by the Federal Highway Administration. The California State Legislature has also relinquished state control of segments within Dana Point, Newport Beach, Santa Monica, and Oxnard; those segments are now maintained by those respective municipalities.

The Big Sur section from San Luis Obispo to Carmel is an official National Scenic Byway. SR 1 is eligible to be included in the State Scenic Highway System; however, only a few stretches between Los Angeles and San Francisco have officially been designated as a scenic highway, meaning that there are substantial sections of highway passing through a &quot;memorable landscape&quot; with no &quot;visual intrusions&quot;, where the potential designation has gained popular favor with the community.

The entire route is designated as a Blue Star Memorial Highway to recognize those in the United States armed forces; this designation is sponsored by the California Garden Clubs, but the organization has not erected such markers along SR 1 yet. In 1959, the legislature officially designated the segment in Southern California between Interstate 5 (I-5) in Dana Point and US 101 near Oxnard as the Pacific Coast Highway (commonly referred to as &quot;PCH&quot;, without the definite article &quot;the&quot;, unlike other freeway numbers in the Los Angeles area). Between US 101 at the Las Cruces junction ( south of Buellton) and US 101 in Pismo Beach, and between US 101 in San Luis Obispo and Interstate 280 in San Francisco, the legislature also designated SR 1 as the Cabrillo Highway in 1959, after the explorer Juan Rodríguez Cabrillo who sailed along the coast line. The legislature also designated the route as the Shoreline Highway in 1957 between the Manzanita Junction near Marin City and Leggett. Smaller segments of the highway have been assigned several other names by the state and municipal governments.

For the most part, SR 1 runs parallel to the coastline, or close to it, but does turn several miles inland at various locations to avoid several federally controlled or protected areas such as Vandenberg Space Force Base, Diablo Canyon Power Plant and Point Reyes National Seashore. In addition to connecting the coastal cities and communities along its path, the route provides access to beaches, parks, and other attractions along the coast, making it a popular route for tourists. The route annually helps bring several billion dollars to the state&#x27;s tourism industry. Segments of SR 1 range from urban freeway to simple rural two-lane road. Under the California Coastal Act, those segments of the highway that run through the rural areas of the protected California Coastal Zone may not be widened beyond a scenic two-lane road.

===Orange County===

At its southernmost end in Orange County, SR 1 terminates at I-5 in Capistrano Beach in Dana Point. It then travels west into the city center. After leaving Dana Point, Pacific Coast Highway (PCH) becomes simply &quot;Coast Highway&quot; while at the same time continuing northwest along the coast through Laguna Beach (where it meets the southern terminus of SR 133) and Crystal Cove State Park.

SR 1 then enters Newport Beach and passes through several affluent neighborhoods, including Newport Coast and Corona Del Mar, spans the entrance to the Upper Newport Bay, which marks the boundary between East Coast Highway and West Coast Highway, and crosses California State Route 55 near its southern terminus. Upon crossing the Santa Ana River mouth and entering Huntington Beach, SR 1 regains the Pacific Coast Highway designation. It passes Huntington State Beach and the southern terminus of California State Route 39 before reaching Bolsa Chica State Beach and the Bolsa Chica Ecological Reserve. PCH then continues along the coast into Seal Beach, the final city on its journey in Orange County.

===Los Angeles and Ventura counties===

PCH enters Los Angeles County and the city of Long Beach after crossing the San Gabriel River. SR 1 then continues northwest through the city to its junction with Lakewood Boulevard (State Route 19) and Los Coyotes Diagonal at the Los Alamitos Circle, more than from the coast. From the traffic circle, it continues inland west through Long Beach, including approximately one mile adjacent to the southern boundary of Signal Hill. PCH is marked as such in Long Beach, but originally bore the name of Hathaway Avenue east of the traffic circle and State Street west of there. PCH then passes through the Los Angeles districts of Wilmington and Harbor City. While bypassing the immediate coastline of Palos Verdes, SR 1 continues to head west into the cities of Lomita and Torrance along the route of the former Redondo-Wilmington Boulevard.

PCH then turns north through Redondo Beach and Hermosa Beach. Upon entering Manhattan Beach, it becomes Sepulveda Boulevard and turns back into PCH designation through El Segundo. At Imperial Highway, it regains the name Sepulveda Boulevard as it descends and passes under two runways of Los Angeles International Airport (LAX) via the Sepulveda Boulevard Tunnel.
After leaving LAX, SR 1 splits from Sepulveda and turns northwest, becoming Lincoln Boulevard and passing through the Los Angeles neighborhoods of Westchester, Playa Vista, and Venice, as well as the unincorporated community of Marina Del Rey. This portion of SR 1 suffers heavy congestion at most times due to the shortage of alternate north-south arterial roads west of Interstate 405. It then enters the city of Santa Monica, where SR 1 turns southwest, merging onto the westernmost segment of the Santa Monica Freeway. Passing through the McClure Tunnel (which also serves as the national western terminus of Interstate 10), SR 1 emerges along the beachfront in Santa Monica as PCH again and continues along the coast, separated from Downtown Santa Monica by the palisades north of Santa Monica Pier; this portion is also known locally as Palisades Beach Road and formerly as Roosevelt Highway. Upon leaving Santa Monica, PCH continues to follow the coast, curving west through the Pacific Palisades neighborhood of Los Angeles before becoming the main thoroughfare of the city of Malibu while traversing the entire of that city.
SR 1 crosses the county line and continues through the Ventura County portion of the Malibu coast through Leo Carrillo State Park and Point Mugu State Park. After passing through a notch in the promontory that marks Point Mugu, the western end of the Santa Monica Mountains, and the beginning of the Oxnard Plain. The road cut left a very large rock formation at the tip of the point that is called the Mugu Rock. At that point, PCH leaves the coast and heads north, and then northwest as a freeway along the northeastern boundary of Naval Base Ventura County Point Mugu for several miles to an interchange at Rice Avenue, Pleasant Valley Road, and Oxnard Boulevard in Oxnard. The reconstructed interchange at Rice Avenue and Pleasant Valley Road channels traffic north on the surface street, Rice Avenue, towards the interchange with US 101. The historic route along Oxnard Boulevard was relinquished in 2014. Truck traffic to and from the Port of Hueneme also uses this designated route at the Rice Avenue/Hueneme Road connector to connect with Route 101 at the Rice Avenue Interchange.

After traveling through Ventura, SR 1 separates from US 101 to travel the historic beach route along the Rincon coast that was originally opened up by the construction of the Railroad Coastal Route from Emma Wood State Beach to the Mobil Pier Undercrossing near Sea Cliff, where it rejoins US 101 about south of the Santa Barbara County line near La Conchita.

===Central Coast===
The US 101/SR 1 concurrency (although actual signage mentioning SR 1 through this segment is nonexistent) from the Mobil Pier Undercrossing runs for , passing through the City of Santa Barbara and its neighboring communities along the coast of Santa Barbara County. The route then turns away from the Gaviota Coast at Gaviota State Beach, avoiding Point Conception, and heads due north through Gaviota State Park and the Gaviota Tunnel. In Las Cruces, SR 1, now named Cabrillo Highway, splits again from US 101 and heads northwest to the city of Lompoc. It is briefly joined with SR 246 along Lompoc&#x27;s east-west Ocean Avenue, before turning north as H Street to Harris Grade Road, where it then regains the Cabrillo Highway name.

After reaching the main entrance to Vandenberg Space Force Base, SR 1 turns northeast, away from the immediate coastline of the base, to join SR 135. Route 135 then splits from Route 1 south of Orcutt, and the Cabrillo Highway turns northwest back towards the coast to Guadalupe. It enters San Luis Obispo County, avoiding the immediate coastline of the protected Guadalupe-Nipomo Dunes, before passing through Grover Beach and subsequently joining US 101 for the third time at Pismo Beach. The US 101/SR 1 concurrency then avoids the immediate coastline of Avila Beach and Diablo Canyon Power Plant, and instead heads straight inland to San Luis Obispo.

SR 1 splits from US 101 at Santa Rosa Street in San Luis Obispo and then resumes as a four lane road as the Cabrillo Highway. It rejoins the coast in Morro Bay, running through that city as a freeway, where it crosses Morro Creek at the site of a prehistoric Chumash settlement dating to the Millingstone Horizon. From there, SR 1 proceeds north to Cayucos until it again becomes a winding, two lane road with occasional passing lanes. It then continues along the coast through Cambria and San Simeon, and past the elephant seal colony at Piedras Blancas Light Station. SR 1 provides access to Hearst Castle in San Simeon in Northern San Luis Obispo County.

===Big Sur===

SR 1 then enters the Big Sur region, crossing San Carpóforo Creek just south of the Monterey County line. For about from San Carpóforo Creek to Malpaso Creek, the road winds and hugs the cliffs of Big Sur, passing various coastal parks in the area, with no connection to the other side of the Santa Lucia Mountains except for Nacimiento-Fergusson Road. The road briefly leaves the coast for a few miles, passing through a redwood forest in the Big Sur River valley. The Big Sur segment of the highway, built between 1919 and 1937, also crosses a number of historic bridges, including the scenic Bixby Bridge, a reinforced concrete arch with a span that passes over the Bixby Creek gorge, the Rocky Creek Bridge, and the Big Creek Bridge.

===Monterey Bay Area===
After crossing the Carmel River, SR 1 turns inland and runs along the eastern boundary of Carmel and the western boundary of Carmel Valley before becoming a freeway in Monterey. After bypassing the immediate coastline of Pebble Beach and the rest of the Monterey Peninsula, the freeway heads north along the coast of Monterey Bay through Sand City, Seaside, and Marina. At the interchange with SR 156 near Castroville, SR 1 continues north as a two-lane rural road to Moss Landing.

SR 1 becomes a freeway once again just before entering into Santa Cruz County. This four-lane freeway continues up the Monterey Bay coast through Watsonville to its interchange with SR 17 in Santa Cruz. (This trumpet interchange is locally known as The Fishhook due to its tight loop ramps that resemble a fishhook when viewed from above). After a short expressway section, it skirts downtown Santa Cruz as four-lane Mission Street, regaining the Cabrillo Highway designation (local/historic name is &quot;Coast Road&quot;) after it leaves the city and continues north-west as a two-lane road (with occasional four-lane sections) up the coast through Davenport.

===San Francisco Bay Area===

Entering San Mateo County, SR 1 follows the west coast of the San Francisco Peninsula, passing by the marine mammal colonies at Año Nuevo State Park, and the historic Pigeon Point Lighthouse, before reaching Half Moon Bay. Between Half Moon Bay and Pacifica, the highway bypasses a treacherous stretch known as Devil&#x27;s Slide via the Tom Lantos Tunnels.

SR 1 then becomes a freeway once again at Sharp Park in Pacifica before turning inland to join Interstate 280 in Daly City. Just short of reaching the City and County of San Francisco, SR 1 splits from Interstate 280, where the road becomes Junipero Serra Boulevard. Shortly thereafter, the highway makes a slight left, becoming the six-lane wide 19th Avenue; the San Francisco Municipal Railway&#x27;s M Ocean View streetcar line runs in the median from this point until a junction to a rail only right-of-way near Rossmoor Drive. SR 1 then turns into Park Presidio Boulevard after it passes through the city&#x27;s Golden Gate Park. Then after entering the Presidio of San Francisco, it goes through the MacArthur Tunnel before joining US 101 for a fourth time on the approach to the Golden Gate Bridge known as Doyle Drive.

After crossing the bridge and entering Marin County, SR 1 then splits from US 101 again near Marin City, where it leaves the city and, as the Shoreline Highway, returns to a winding, two lane road as it passes over the Marin Hills to rejoin the coast at Muir Beach. After passing Stinson Beach and the Bolinas Lagoon, SR 1 avoids the immediate coastline of Point Reyes National Seashore and the rest of the Point Reyes Peninsula, and instead heads towards, and then along, the eastern shore of Tomales Bay.

Leaving Tomales Bay, SR 1 heads further inland to intersect with Valley Ford Road just north of the Sonoma County border. It then rejoins the coast in Bodega Bay, where its name changes to Coast Highway past the Sonoma Coast State Beaches. After bridging the Russian River at Jenner, SR 1 continues to wind along the rugged coast to Fort Ross, Salt Point State Parks, and the planned community of Sea Ranch.

===Mendocino County===

SR 1 then crosses the Gualala River and enters Mendocino County. The highway enters the city of Point Arena, in which it becomes Main Street, before following School Street to the northwest and then becoming Shoreline Highway once again. It bridges the Garcia River and then, near Elk, the Navarro River, where it meets SR 128.

At the town of Albion, the Albion River is spanned by the Albion River Bridge, the only remaining wooden trestle bridge on the highway. SR 1 then passes through Little River and Van Damme State Park, crosses Big River and passes through Mendocino Headlands State Park and the Victorian community of Mendocino. Continuing north, SR 1 crosses Russian Gulch State Park on the Frederick W. Panhorst Bridge, and passes through the town of Caspar. It passes through a roundabout just south of the intersection with the western terminus of SR 20, where it widens to two lanes, then bridges the Noyo River at Noyo, becomes Main Street of Fort Bragg, and crosses the California Western Railroad.

North of Fort Bragg as a two-lane highway again, SR 1 passes MacKerricher State Park and the towns of Cleone and Inglenook before crossing Ten Mile River. After passing Westport-Union Landing State Beach, the road goes through a series of redwood-forested switchbacks before reaching Rockport. North of Rockport, the highway turns away from the Lost Coast to avoid steep and unstable highlands created by Mendocino triple junction uplift. The highway follows Cottaneva Creek inland through redwood-forested mountainous terrain before terminating at US 101 just outside Leggett.

==History==
SR 1 has become famous worldwide, but the highway was signed as several other routes prior to 1964. When the road was first envisioned in the World War I era, California highways were referred to by either a highway name or a route number. The route numbers were used by state highway planners and the Legislature from 1915 until 1964, but were never posted on highways, referred to by the auto clubs or public, nor used on maps. The SR 1 designation was first assigned in 1939. Various portions of SR 1 have been posted and referred to by various names and numbers over the years. State construction of what became SR 1 started after the state&#x27;s third highway bond issue passed before 1910.

===Segments initially constructed===

Eager for a direct coastal route between Ventura and Santa Barbara, civic boosters used locally raised funds to begin building the Rincon Sea Level Road in 1911. The route between the Ventura River and Carpinteria had been an unimproved route along small alluvial fan beaches that skirted coastal bluff rock outcroppings at low tide. Construction of the Southern Pacific Coast Line railroad had created a road flanked by riprap along this area. In order to make this part of the first coastal route for motorists driving from San Francisco to Los Angeles, they paved the road and built wooden causeways where the route flooded from the ocean waves. Local funding ran out, but the newly formed State Highway Commission took over and completed the road in 1913.

One of the most difficult routes to build was along the Big Sur coast. The state first approved building Route 56, or the Carmel-San Simeon Highway, to connect Big Sur to the rest of California in 1919. Federal funds were appropriated and in 1921 voters approved additional state funds. San Quentin State Prison set up three temporary prison camps to provide unskilled convict labor to help with road construction. One was set up by Little Sur River, one at Kirk Creek and a third was later established in the south at Anderson Creek. Inmates were paid 35 cents per day and had their prison sentences reduced in return. The route necessitated construction of 33 bridges, the largest of which was the Bixby Bridge. Six more concrete arch bridges were built between Point Sur and Carmel.

After 18 years of construction, aided by New Deal funds during the Great Depression, the paved two-lane road was completed and opened on June 17, 1937. The road was initially called the Carmel-San Simeon Highway (Route 56), but was better known as the Roosevelt Highway, honoring the current President Franklin D. Roosevelt. A 1921 law extended Route 56 south over the county road to Cambria.

Route 60, from Oxnard via the coast to San Juan Capistrano, was extended from Oxnard to El Rio (midway to Ventura, now the site of the Oxnard Boulevard interchange with US 101), in 1925. At Point Mugu, a path for the highway was cut through the mountains using surplus World War I explosives, thus creating Mugu Rock. The 1921 legislation, in theory, made Route 60 a continuous coastal loop, with both ends at what became US 101 in Oxnard and at Capistrano Beach (since 1964 the southern terminus of SR 1 at Interstate 5 in Orange County). Route 56 was extended further south from Cambria to connect to present-day US 101 in San Luis Obispo in 1931.

The route from San Simeon to Carmel (connecting with existing county highways at each end) was one of two sections designated as SR 1. It and Route 60 were intended as links in a continuous coastal roadway from Oregon to Mexico,

A large expansion of the state highway system in 1933 resulted in Route 56 being extended in both directions. To the south, a second section was added, beginning at Pismo Beach on US 101 (Route 2) and heading south through Guadalupe and Lompoc to rejoin US 101 at a junction called Los Cruces (sic), just north of Gaviota Pass. (A short piece near Orcutt and Los Alamos had been part of Route 2, which originally followed present SR 135 from Los Alamos to Santa Maria.) To the north, Route 56 was continued along the coast from Carmel through Santa Cruz to San Francisco. Several discontinuous pieces were added north of San Francisco, one from Route 1 (US 101) north of the Golden Gate to the county line near Valley Ford, another from the Russian River near Jenner (where the new Route 104 ended) to Westport, and a third from Ferndale to Route 1 near Fernbridge. Except for the gaps in Route 56 north of San Francisco, these additions completed the coastal highway, with other sections formed by Routes 1, 2, and 71.

The section of SR 1 from Santa Monica to Oxnard, via Malibu, went out to contract in 1925 as &quot;Coast Boulevard&quot;, but was designated &quot;Theodore Roosevelt Highway&quot; when it was dedicated in 1929. Before the completion of its present alignment in 1937, a narrow, winding, steep road known as Pedro Mountain Road connected Montara with Pacifica. That highway was completed in 1914 and provided competition to the Ocean Shore Railroad, which operated between San Francisco and Tunitas Creek from 1907 to 1920. SR 1 also used to run along the coast between Pacifica and Daly City, but this segment was damaged and rendered unusable after a 5.3 magnitude earthquake on March 22, 1957. A small stub remains near Thornton Beach.

Route 56 along Big Sur was incorporated into the state highway system and re-designated as SR 1 in 1939. The section of road along the Big Sur Coast was declared the first State Scenic Highway in 1965, and in 1966 the first lady, Lady Bird Johnson, led the official designation ceremony at Bixby Bridge. The route was designated as an All American Road by the US Government.

===Signs first posted===


SR 1 signs first went up after California decided to number its highways, in 1934. The section for Humboldt, Mendocino, Sonoma, Marin, San Francisco, San Mateo, Santa Cruz, Monterey, San Luis Obispo and Santa Barbara counties was posted as SR 1, that section of the road known Route 56 (Las Cruces to Fernbridge). For Ventura, Los Angeles and Orange counties, Route 60 (San Juan Capistrano to the Oxnard area) became SR 3, and a few SR 3 signs were actually posted. The SR 3 signs were replaced by US 101 Alt. shields by 1936, as the road was built out; this change also allowed the extension of US 66 to end at another U.S. Route, in Santa Monica.

The gaps of non-state highway along the northern coast were finally filled in by the Legislature in 1951, though the State Department of Public Works was not required to maintain the newly added portions immediately. A connection from near Rockport to Legislative Route 1 (signed US 101) at Leggett was also added to the Legislative Route 56 definition, as the existing county road north from Rockport to Ferndale had not yet been paved.

A portion of the road heading to the Golden Gate Bridge was widened to four lanes as part of a project competed in 1954.&lt;ref name=&quot;nps.gov/28371/D&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

The state Legislature in 1963 tossed out the old conflicting Legislative Route Numbers (1964 renumbering), got rid of some famous old U.S. routes, and renumbered many state highways. It abolished US 101A in Los Angeles, Orange and Ventura counties and renumbered it as SR 1. The Rockport to Leggett connection then became State Route 208. The cover of &quot;California Highways&quot; magazine in fall 1964 shows state engineers posting the new shield at Point Mugu. The same year, the Legislature by state law named SR 1 &quot;Pacific Coast Highway&quot; in Orange, Los Angeles and Ventura counties, &quot;Cabrillo Highway&quot; from Santa Barbara north to San Francisco, and &quot;Shoreline Highway&quot; from Marin County to its northern terminus. Many cities, however, did not change the name of city streets that are part of SR 1, such as Lincoln and Sepulveda boulevards in Los Angeles, Santa Monica and El Segundo; and Junipero Serra and Park Presidio boulevards in San Francisco. Several other cities and communities like Newport Beach and Bodega Bay merely named their respective city streets as &quot;Coast Highway&quot;.

===Modern alignments===

The freeway portion of SR 1 from Highway 68 in Monterey to Munras Avenue opened in 1956–1960. The segment from Munras Avenue to the northern border of Sand City and Seaside opened in 1968, and bypasses the original highway alignment of Munras Avenue and Fremont Street in Monterey, and Fremont Boulevard through Seaside. North of Seaside, the freeway was built over the original SR 1 alignment through Fort Ord in 1973. North of Fort Ord, SR 1 now veers to the left of the original alignment and bypasses Marina to the west. This segment including the interchange with SR 156 and the short, 2-lane Castroville Bypass opened in 1976. Originally SR 1 followed the SR 156 alignment to the SR 183 intersection in Castroville, then turned northwest, following the present-day SR 183 through Castroville before rejoining its existing alignment at the northern terminus of the Castroville Bypass.

Plans to upgrade SR 1 to a freeway from its southern terminus all the way to Oxnard, including building an offshore causeway from the Santa Monica Pier to Topanga Canyon Boulevard south of Malibu, were ultimately killed by 1971 due to local opposition. In 1980, another section was added northwest of Ventura near Emma Wood State Beach, when several miles of the old two-lane alignment of U.S. Route 101 were posted as SR 1 where the freeway had bypassed it in about 1960. Then in 1988, the segment from Purisima Road in Lompoc to SR 135 was re-routed from Harris Grade Road to the former County Route S20 so it could directly serve Vandenberg Air Force Base.

Construction to bridge the gap in the Lost Coast region between Rockport and Ferndale was eventually abandoned. The steepness and related geotechnical challenges of the coastal mountains made this stretch of coastline too costly for highway builders to establish routes through the area. In 1984, SR 1 was then re-routed to replace State Highway 208, connecting Rockport and Leggett, while the segment between Ferndale and Fernbridge was renumbered as State Highway 211. Most of the coastline in the area is now part of Sinkyone Wilderness State Park and the King Range National Conservation Area.

The roadway along Devil&#x27;s Slide, south of Pacifica, became the site of frequent deadly crashes and roadway-closing landslides. Beginning in 1958, Caltrans supported a plan to construct an inland bypass over Montara Mountain as an alternate route, but was eventually opposed by community and environmental groups who supported a tunnel instead. After decades of legal disputes, the Federal Highway Administration ordered Caltrans in 1995 to re-evaluate the proposed tunnel. Then on November 5, 1996, San Mateo County voters approved Measure T to change the county&#x27;s official preference from the bypass to the tunnel. Ground eventually broke in 2005, and the Tom Lantos Tunnels opened in April 2013.

In 2014, two-way traffic was restored along the original PCH segment from Copper Lantern to Blue Lantern streets in the Dana Point city center after 25 years of one-way operation. During that period, only northbound traffic had flowed along this section of PCH while southbound traffic had been diverted onto the parallel Del Prado Avenue.

SR 1 has never been planned to extend south into San Diego, or north into Crescent City, where I-5 (which replaced the US 101 designation and signage between Los Angeles and San Diego) and US 101 serve as the coastal highways in those areas, respectively.

===As a cycling venue===

For the 1932 Summer Olympics, the segment of the SR 1 between Oxnard and Santa Monica (then known as the Theodore Roosevelt Highway) hosted part of the road cycling events. Portions of SR 1 have also hosted stages of the Tour of California.

==Maintenance==
===Landslides===
Frequent landslides and erosion along the coast have caused portions of SR 1 to either be closed for long periods of time, or be re-routed entirely. Some of these include:

* A segment along the coast between Pacifica and Daly City in what is now Thornton Beach was damaged and rendered unusable after a 5.3 magnitude earthquake on March 22, 1957. SR 1 was then eventually re-routed to turn inland to join Interstate 280.
* The Piedras Blancas Realignment Project plans to re-route the road up to further inland to avoid the expected coastal erosion from the Piedras Blancas Light Station to the Arroyo de la Cruz Bridge in San Luis Obispo County.
*Big Rock Mesa landslide in September 1983 in Malibu was one of the worst in state history. A total of 250 homes collapsed, cracked or slid off their foundation with 30 homes being condemned. The state agreed to pay forty million dollars as cutting through the hillside to build Pacific Coast Highway was a contributing cause.
* The Devil&#x27;s Slide area has been prone to major landslides. One slide in 1995 caused the road to be closed for five months, while another in 2006 led to a four-month closure. The Tom Lantos Tunnels, named after former U.S. Congressman Tom Lantos, opened in 2013 to bypass the area.
* In 2011, major reconstruction was completed between Muir Beach and Stinson Beach, including the addition of a , , but mostly buried, retaining wall. This followed a four-month, $25 million reconstruction that repaired damage from a 2007 landslide.
* A March 2011 landslide in the Big Sur region forced Caltrans to close the highway for several months. A section south of Lucia that is also prone to frequent landslides, known as Pitkins Curve and Rain Rocks, was replaced with a bridge and a covered rock shed.
* During the winter of 2016–2017, the Big Sur region received more than of rain. The road was closed or partially closed due to mudslides and landslides in at least six locations. On February 20, Caltrans declared that the Pfeiffer Canyon Bridge just south of Pfeiffer Big Sur State Park was damaged beyond repair, closing that segment of SR 1 for eight months, and effectively splitting Big Sur in half. Some businesses, cut off from customers and without access to supplies, were forced to close. For some residents, the only means of getting out was via helicopter. In March, Caltrans demolished the bridge and began construction of the replacement. The rebuilt bridge opened on October 13, 2017, at a cost of $24 million.
* Another major slide at Mud Creek closed a stretch of the highway in May 2017. The huge slide at Mud Creek covered about of road with of dirt and rock. The slide was on a section of the road that was already closed due to smaller slides. The scale of the slide was compared to a very large slide during the winter of 1983–1984 that closed SR 1 for more than a year. A replacement roadway was built over the landslide and opened in July 2018, at a cost of $40 million.
* After heavy rainfall, a section of the highway at mile marker 30, near Rat Creek in Monterey County, collapsed into the ocean in January 2021. It reopened in April 2021.
* Multiple landslides during successive storm systems in January 2023 forced the closure of nearly of the highway. , over of the highway remain closed.
* Landslides in March 2024 forced the closure of a stretch north of the Rocky Creek Bridge in the Big Sur region.

===Future projects===
In 2014, Caltrans relinquished the portion of SR 1 in Oxnard along Oxnard Boulevard. The plan is then for PCH between Pleasant Valley Road and US 101 to be re-routed from Oxnard Boulevard onto Rice Avenue. That segment of Rice Avenue includes a railroad grade crossing at 5th Avenue that was the site of the February 2015 Oxnard train derailment, which eventually led to one death and 29 injuries. This was the twelfth accident at the crossing in ten years. An overpass has been planned at that site for almost two decades, but funding has not been available in Ventura County for the estimated $35 million grade separation project. On July 12, 2023, the Ventura County Transportation Commission and the City of Oxnard received $15 million in state funding to build an overpass. The project is estimated to be completed by the fall of 2027.

In 2015, a $20 million project was proposed to add over 150 safety improvements to the stretch of the highway in Malibu. This follows a string of fatal accidents in the area, including one involving Caitlyn Jenner that claimed another person&#x27;s life.
The Calera Parkway project proposes to widen the non-freeway segment in Pacifica between the Rockaway Beach and Vallemar districts, but is facing opposition by local residents and environmentalists.

==In popular culture==
Tim Buckley&#x27;s 1969 album Happy Sad includes a song with the title &quot;Love from Room 109 at the Islander (On Pacific Coast Highway)&quot;.

In 2002, the Decemberists released a song titled &quot;California One/Youth and Beauty Brigade&quot; on their album Castaways and Cutouts.

In 2008, Old 97&#x27;s released a song titled &quot;The One&quot; on their album Blame It on Gravity. The song reminisces about their early days as a band being flown from Texas out to Los Angeles to be courted by various big record company labels. In this delightful reimagining, the band ultimately decides it would be easier and more fun to become bank robbers instead, and they make their escape along this famous route (&quot;Let&#x27;s take The One!&quot;).

In 2012, the Beach Boys released a song titled &quot;Pacific Coast Highway&quot;. Described by critics as &quot;introspective&quot;, &quot;autumnal&quot;, and &quot;hymnlike&quot;, the song takes the perspective of an aged person driving down the highway during sunset as he reflects on his advancing years in life, deciding that he is more comfortable living alone.

<text>A metropolitan area or metro is a region consisting of a densely populated urban agglomeration and its surrounding territories which share industries, commercial areas, transport network, infrastructures and housing. A metropolitan area usually comprises multiple principal cities, jurisdictions and municipalities: neighborhoods, townships, boroughs, cities, towns, exurbs, suburbs, counties, districts and even states and nations in areas like the eurodistricts. As social, economic and political institutions have changed, metropolitan areas have become key economic and political regions.

Metropolitan areas in the United States are delineated around the core of a core based statistical area which is defined as an urban area, (this is different than the urban core) and consists of central and outlying counties, as the terms central city and suburb are no longer used by the census bureau due to suburbanization of employment. In other countries metropolitan areas are sometimes anchored by one central city such as the Paris metropolitan area (Paris). In other cases, metropolitan areas contain multiple centers of equal or close to equal importance, especially in the United States; for example, the Dallas–Fort Worth metropolitan area has eight principal cities. The Islamabad–Rawalpindi metropolitan area in Pakistan, the Rhine-Ruhr in Germany, and the Randstad in The Netherlands are other examples.

In the United States, the concept of metropolitan statistical areas has gained prominence. The area of the Greater Washington metropolitan area is an example of statistically grouping independent cities and county areas from various states to form a larger city because of proximity, history and recent urban convergence. Metropolitan areas may themselves be part of a greater megalopolis. For urban centres located outside metropolitan areas that generate a similar attraction at a smaller scale for a region, the concept of a regiopolis and a respective regiopolitan area, or regio, was introduced by German professors in 2006. In the United States, the term micropolitan statistical area is used.

==Definition==
A metropolitan area combines an urban agglomeration with the contiguous built-up areas, which are not necessarily urban in character but are closely bound to the center by employment or other commerce. These outlying zones are sometimes known as a commuter belt and may extend well beyond the urban zone to other political entities. For example, East Hampton, New York, on Long Island is considered part of the New York metropolitan area.

In 2020, the European Commission, the Food and Agriculture Organization, the United Nations Human Settlements Programme, the International Labour Organization, the OECD, and the World Bank have agreed on a common methodological framework for delimitation of urban and rural areas, which contains a definition of metropolitan areas called the Functional urban area. It is defined as a city and its commuting zone, which is a contiguous area of spatial units that have at least 15% of their employed residents working in the city.

In practice, the parameters of metropolitan areas, in both official and unofficial usage, are not consistent. Sometimes they are little different from an urban area, and in other cases, they cover broad regions that have little relation to a single urban settlement; comparative statistics for metropolitan areas should take this into account. The term metropolitan can also refer to a county-level municipal government structure, with some shared services between a central city and its suburbs, which may or may not include the entirety of a metropolitan area. Population figures given for one metro area can vary by millions.

There has been no significant change in the basic concept of metropolitan areas since its adoption in 1950, although significant changes in geographic distributions have occurred since then, and more are expected. Because of the fluidity of the term &quot;metropolitan statistical area&quot;, the term used colloquially is more often &quot;metro service area&quot;, &quot;metro area&quot;, or &quot;MSA&quot;, taken to include not only a city but also the surrounding suburban, exurban and sometimes rural areas, all of which the city is presumed to influence. A polycentric metropolitan area contains multiple urban agglomerations not connected by continuous development. In defining a metropolitan area, it is sufficient that a city or cities form a nucleus with which other areas have a high degree of integration.

A metropolitan area is commonly known and characterized by a high concentration in service sector labor and enterprises. Macroeconomics views metropolitan areas as trade regions of economic significance.

Since, presently, urban data are based on arbitrary definitions that vary from country to country and from year or census to the next, making them difficult to compare, an Urban Metric System (UMS) has been conceived that could correct the problem, since it allows computing the urban area limits and central points, and it can be applied in the same way to all past, present and future population and job distributions. 
It is based on vector field calculations obtained by assuming that, in a given space, all inhabitants and jobs exert the same attractive force &quot;A&quot; and repulsive force &quot;R&quot;. The net force (&quot;A&quot; - &quot;R&quot;) exerted by each inhabitant or job is given by [1/(1 + &quot;d&quot;)] - [1/( &quot;β&quot; + &quot;d&quot;/2)], where &quot;d&quot; = distance and &quot;β&quot; is the only parameter. 
UMS distinguishes the following types of urban areas, each type corresponding to a given value of &quot;β&quot;:
UMS has been applied to some Canadian cases since 2018, but the data presented in this article are still based on the various existing national definitions, which are disparate.

==Africa==
===South Africa===
The Greater Johannesburg metropolitan area is the fourth largest metropolitan area in South Africa. Its population was over 9.6 million as of the 2011 South Africa Census, in contrast to its urban area, which consisted of approximately 7.9 million inhabitants as of 2011. Conversely, metropolitan municipalities in South Africa are defined as commonly governed areas of a metropolitan area. The largest such metropolitan municipal government entity in South Africa is the City of Johannesburg Metropolitan Municipality, which presided over nearly 5 million people as of 2016. However, the Greater Johannesburg metropolitan area houses roughly ten times the population of its core municipal city of Johannesburg, which contained 957,441 people as of the 2011 census.

==Americas==
===Brazil===
The IBGE defines also &quot;Immediate Geographic Areas&quot; (formerly termed microregions) which capture the region &quot;surrounding urban centers for the supply of immediate needs of the population&quot;. Intended for policy planning purposes, as of March 2021 census data is not tabulated on the level of these Areas, but instead at the municipality or state level.

=== Canada ===

In Canada, a &quot;census metropolitan area&quot; (CMA) or &quot;census agglomeration&quot; (CA) consists of one or more neighboring municipalities centered around a core population. A CMA requires a total population of at least 100,000, with 50,000 or more residing in the core, while a CA requires a core population of at least 10,000. Both are determined using data from Canada&#x27;s Census of Population Program, and surrounding municipalities must demonstrate strong economic integration with the core, measured by commuting patterns.

===Chile===
There are three metropolitan areas in Chile, the biggest and most important one is the Gran Santiago in the Santiago Metropolitan Region, with over 7 million inhabitants, making it the largest and most populated urban area in Chile. The other two metro areas are Gran Valparaiso in the Valparaiso Region with almost a million inhabitants, and Gran Concepción in the Bio Bio Region, with a population of about a million people living in it.
Smaller &quot;metropolitan&quot; areas are known as conurbations. Conurbaciones tend to have a bit over 200.000 inhabitants to be considered as such. An example is the Conurbacion de Rancagua, which considers the area shared by the city of Rancagua, and the adjacent smaller towns of Machalí, Gultro and Graneros. 

===Mexico===

Metropolitan areas are known as &quot;zonas metropolitanas&quot; in Mexico. The National Population Council (CONAPO) defines them as:
* a set of two or more municipalities where a city with a population of at least 100,000 is located, and whose urban area, functions and activities exceed the limits of the municipality.
* municipalities with a city of more than 500,000 inhabitants, or a city of more than 200,000 inhabitants located in the northern and southern border areas and in the coastal zone. 
* municipalities where state capitals are located, if they are not already included in a metropolitan zone.
As of 2018, there are 74 &quot;zonas metropolitanas&quot; in Mexico. 75.1 million people, 62.8% of the country population, live within a metropolitan area.

===United States===
As of February 28, 2013, the United States Office of Management and Budget (OMB) defined 1,098 statistical areas for the metropolitan areas of the United States and Puerto Rico. These 1,098 statistical areas comprise 929 Core-Based Statistical Areas (CBSAs) and 169 Combined Statistical Areas (CSAs). The 929 Core-Based Statistical Areas are divided into 388 Metropolitan Statistical Areas (MSAs – 381 for the U.S. and seven for Puerto Rico) and 541 Micropolitan Statistical Areas (μSAs – 536 for the U.S. and five for Puerto Rico). The 169 Combined Statistical Areas (166 for the U.S. and three for Puerto Rico) each comprise two or more adjacent Core Based Statistical Areas.

The Office of Management and Budget defines a Metropolitan Statistical Area as one or more adjacent counties or county equivalents that have at least one urban area of at least 50,000 population, plus adjacent territory that has a high degree of economic and social integration with the core as measured by commuting ties. The OMB then defines a Combined Statistical Area as consisting of various combinations of adjacent metropolitan and micropolitan statistical areas with economic ties measured by commuting patterns. The Office of Management and Budget further defines a core-based statistical area (CBSA) to be a geographical area that consists of one or more counties (or equivalents) anchored by an urban center of at least 10,000 people plus adjacent counties that are socioeconomically tied to the urban center by commuting.

==Asia and the Pacific==
=== Australia ===

The Australian Bureau of Statistics uses &quot;Greater Capital City Statistical Areas&quot; (GCCSAs), which are geographical areas designed to represent the functional extent of each of the eight state and territory capital cities. They were designed to reflect labor markets, using the 2011 Census &quot;travel to work&quot; data. Labor markets are sometimes used as proxy measures of the functional extent of a city as it contains the majority of the commuting population. GCCSAs replaced &quot;Statistical Divisions&quot; used until 2011.

Other metropolitan areas in Australia include cross border cities or continuous built-up areas between two or more cities that are connected by an extensive public transport network that allows for commuting for work or services.

===Bangladesh===
In Bangladesh, the large population centres which have significant financial, political and administrative importance are considered to be as Metropolitan cities, which are governed by City Corporations. In total, there are 12 city corporations in Bangladesh. 4 of them (Dhaka North City Corporation, Dhaka South City Corporation, Narayanganj City Corporation, Gazipur City Corporation) are part of Dhaka Metropolitan Area.

===China===
In China, there used to be no clear distinction between megalopolis (, lit. city cluster) and metropolitan area () until National Development and Reform Commission issued &quot;Guidelines on the Cultivation and Development of Modern Metropolitan Areas&quot; () on Feb 19, 2019, in which a metropolitan area was defined as &quot;an urbanized spatial form in a megalopolis dominated by (a) supercity(-ies) or megacity(-ies), or a large metropolis playing a leading part, and within the basic range of 1-hour commute area.&quot;

===India===
In India, a metropolitan city is defined as one with a population more than one million. In policing jurisdiction, state governments can declare any city or town with a population exceeding one million as a metropolitan area as per the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973.

===Indonesia===

In Indonesia, the government of Indonesia defines a &quot;metropolitan area&quot; as an urban agglomeration where its spatial planning is prioritised due to its highly important influence on the country. Jakarta, Surabaya, Bandung, Semarang, Medan, Makassar, Palembang are important metropolitan area in the country. Currently, there are 10 metropolitan cities in Indonesia that have been recognized by the government.

=== Malaysia ===

===Pakistan===

Pakistan has nine metropolitan areas with populations greater than a million. Five of these are entirely in Punjab including Lahore, Faisalabad, Gujranwala, Multan; one (Islamabad-Rawalpindi is split between Punjab and the Islamabad Capital Territory; two are located in Sindh, including Karachi, the largest metropolitan area in the country, and Hyderabad; one in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa: Peshawar; and the final in Balochistan: Quetta.

===Philippines===

The Philippines currently has three metropolitan areas defined by the National Economic and Development Authority (NEDA). These metropolitan areas are separated into three main geographical areas; Metro Manila (which is located in Luzon), Metro Cebu (which is located in Visayas), Metro Davao (which is located in Mindanao), and Greater Manila Area (which is the largest metropolitan area of Manila). The official definition of each area does not necessarily follow the actual extent of continuous urbanization. For example, the built-up area of Metro Manila has long spilled out of its officially defined borders into the adjacent provinces of Bulacan, Rizal, Laguna, and Cavite known as Greater Manila Area. The number of metropolitan areas in the Philippines was reduced from 13 in 2007 to the current three based from the 2017–2022 Philippine Development Plan by NEDA. The other 10 metropolitan areas were Metro Angeles, Metro Bacolod, Metro Baguio, Metro Batangas, Metro Cagayan de Oro, Metro Dagupan, Metro Iloilo–Guimaras, Metro Butuan, Metro Naga, and Metro Olongapo.

===United Arab Emirates===

Dubai-Sharjah-Ajman (DSA) is a metropolitan area in the United Arab Emirates. It consists of the combined, greater urban areas of Dubai, Ajman, and Sharjah. The urban areas at the northeast end of Dubai flow into those of Sharjah, which in turn are contiguous with those of Ajman. The total population is about 5.9 million people as of 2023
== Europe ==
The European Union&#x27;s statistical agency Eurostat, in partnership with OECD, has created a concept named functional urban area (FUA). The FUA represents an attempt at a harmonised definition of the metropolitan area, and the goal was to have an area from which a significant share of the residents commute into the city. The FUA consists of a city and its commuting zone, which is a contiguous area of spatial units that have at least 15% of their employed residents working in the city.

=== France ===

France&#x27;s national statistics office, INSEE, names an urban core and its surrounding area of commuter influence an (or AAV, literally meaning &quot;catchment area of a city&quot;), plural: &quot;aires d&#x27;attraction des villes&quot;. The official translation of this statistical area in English (as used by INSEE) is &quot;functional area&quot;. The AAV follows the same definition as the Functional Urban Area (FUA) used by Eurostat and the OECD, and the AAVs are thus strictly comparable to the FUAs.

The AAV replaced in 2020 the metropolitan statistical area called &quot;aire urbaine&quot; (AU). The AU, which was defined differently than the AAV, has now been discarded by INSEE and replaced with the AAV in order to facilitate international comparisons.

=== Germany ===
Metropolitan regions in Germany by definition, are the eleven urban areas that are the most densely populated areas in the Federal Republic of Germany. They comprise the major German cities and their surrounding catchment areas and form the political, commercial and cultural centers of the country.

For urban centers outside metropolitan areas, that generate a similar attraction at smaller scale for their region, the concept of the Regiopolis and respectively regiopolitan area or region was introduced by German professors in 2006.

=== Italy ===
In 2001 Italy transformed 14 provinces of some of the country&#x27;s largest cities into &quot;Metropolitan Cities&quot;. Therefore, the territory of the &quot;Metropolitan City&quot; corresponds to that of a normal Italian province.

=== Sweden ===
The list of metropolitan areas in Sweden is collated based on statistics of commuting between central municipalities and surrounding municipalities and taking into account existing planning cooperation in the country&#x27;s three geographic regions. They were defined around 1965. In 2005, a number of further municipalities were added to the defined areas.

=== Turkey ===
The word metropolitan describes the central municipality governing local services in a province with more than 750.000 residents in Turkey, like Istanbul and its metropolitan municipality, the Istanbul Metropolitan Municipality. There are 30 officially defined &quot;metropolitan municipalities&quot; in Turkey. This classification, however, is only used for administrative purposes, and sometimes contradicts the colloquial use of the term &quot;metro area&quot;. As an example, Gebze, a district in Kocaeli province and thus in the jurisdiction of the Kocaeli Metropolitan Municipality, is arguably within the metro area of Istanbul with many of its residents commuting to Istanbul for work and the Marmaray, a commuter rail line, extending into the district. The district however, as previously mentioned, is not a part of Istanbul&#x27;s provincial limits, and thus not subject to the jurisdiction of its metropolitan municipality. The word metropolitan (municipality) is generally only used as an administrative distinction in Turkey.

=== United Kingdom ===
The United Kingdom&#x27;s Office for National Statistics defines &quot;travel to work areas&quot; as areas where &quot;at least 75% of an area&#x27;s resident workforce work in the area and at least 75% of the people who work in the area also live in the area&quot;.

The European Union&#x27;s ESPON group has compiled a separate list of metropolitan areas which covers the UK.

<text>The Naked Spur is a 1953 American Western film directed by Anthony Mann and starring James Stewart, Janet Leigh, Robert Ryan, Ralph Meeker, and Millard Mitchell. Written by Sam Rolfe and Harold Jack Bloom, the film is about a bounty hunter who tries to bring a murderer to justice, and is forced to accept the help of two strangers who are less than trustworthy.

The original music score was composed by Bronisław Kaper and the cinematography was by William C. Mellor. &quot;The Naked Spur&quot; was filmed on location in Durango and the San Juan Mountains in Colorado and in Lone Pine, California.

The film was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay—a rare honor for a Western. This was the third Western film collaboration between Anthony Mann and James Stewart. In 1997, &quot;The Naked Spur&quot; was added to the United States National Film Registry, being deemed &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant&quot;. In 2021, &quot;The Naked Spur&quot; was released on Blu-ray in the North American region by Warner Bros. in their Archive Collection. The disc is supplemented by an audio commentary by Peter Bogdanovich, intercut with selections from an audio interview with Mann.

==Plot==
In 1868, in the Rocky Mountains in Colorado, Howard Kemp offers grizzled prospector Jesse Tate $20 for help tracking Ben Vandergroat, wanted for killing a marshal in Abilene, Kansas. Kemp shows him a torn WANTED poster. Tate assumes that Kemp is a sheriff.

An avalanche of rocks blocks their path. Kemp fires, provoking another rock slide. Roy Anderson, recently discharged from the 6th Cavalry, is attracted by the shots. Kemp asks to see his discharge: Anderson is &quot;morally unstable&quot;.

Anderson scales a cliff face and catches Vandergroat. The outlaw&#x27;s companion, Lina Patch, jumps in. Kemp and Tate stop the fight. Lina&#x27;s father, killed robbing a bank in Abilene, was Vandergroat&#x27;s friend.
Vandergroat reveals that Kemp is no lawman and that the bottom of the WANTED poster offers $5,000 to whoever brings him in. Tate and Anderson want their shares. Lina believes that Vandergroat is innocent. On the trail, Vandergroat wages a constant psychological campaign to turn his captors against each other by various means, starting with the observation that the reward will be larger divided by two.

Scouting a mountain pass, Kemp and Tate spot a dozen Blackfoot far from their normal territory. Anderson confesses that they are after him for raping the chief&#x27;s daughter. Kemp tells Anderson to ride away, fast, so the rest of them will be safe. The Blackfoot catch up to Kemp&#x27;s group, and when they all stop, Anderson shoots the chief from a hidden position.
During the ensuing battle, Kemp saves Vandergroat but is shot in the leg. Lina helps him to recover. They all ride on. When Kemp passes out, they make camp. Delirious, he thinks that he is leaving to fight in the Civil War and Lina is Mary, his fiancée. Strains of &quot;Beautiful Dreamer&quot; play.

Vandergroat explains that Mary sold Kemp&#x27;s ranch and ran away. He adds that Kemp&#x27;s one-third share of the reward is not enough to buy his ranch: They should worry. Lina tells Kemp that she is not “with” Vandergroat romantically. She has only seen him fighting fair and believes his promise of a ranch in California. Later, Vandergroat loosens Kemp&#x27;s saddle cinch and pushes him over the edge of a steep mountain trail. A tree breaks his fall, and he crawls back up. That night, Vandergroat grins to see Kemp gently pull Lina&#x27;s blanket over her.

They take refuge from a storm in a cave. Vandergroat tells Lina to distract Kemp so that he can escape through the back of the cave. The alternative: He will kill Kemp. The &quot;Beautiful Dreamer&quot; theme plays as Lina describes her dream of California and Kemp reminisces about his ranch. They kiss. Vandergroat takes his chance. Kemp hauls him back. Anderson wants to kill Vandergroat: The reward is &quot;dead or alive&quot;. Tate stops Anderson but, infuriated, Kemp challenges Vandergroat to a quick draw, which he refuses.

At the river, now running so high they must detour downstream, Anderson lassoes Vandergroat&#x27;s neck, intending to drag the “sack of money” across. Kemp and Anderson fight. While Kemp and Anderson recover and Lina searches for firewood, Vandergroat offers Tate an irresistible temptation: a gold mine.

Tate helps Vandergroat and Lina escape. Vandergroat and Lina ride double; Tate follows, holding a rifle. Vandergroat yells &quot;Snake!&quot; and in the confusion, grabs the rifle. Vandergroat kills Tate where the body will be seen by the others. Lina finally accepts the truth about him.

Vandergroat fires on Kemp and Anderson from the cliff above, but Lina grabs the rifle barrel. While Anderson exchanges gunfire with Vandergroat, Kemp uses one of his spurs as a piton to climb the cliff and outflank Vandergroat.

Suspicious, Vandergroat rises to fire at Kemp. Kemp throws the spur into his cheek, and Anderson shoots Vandergroat. The body falls into the river and is entangled in the roots of dead trees lodged on the opposite bank. Anderson lassos a snag and crosses. He wraps the rope around Vandergroat&#x27;s body but is killed by a giant floating log that drowns Anderson and takes his body down the river.

Kemp drags Vandergroat&#x27;s body across the river and hoists it onto his horse, in a rage, vowing that he will take him back. Lina says she will go with him, no matter his choice, marry him, and live with him. Weeping, he declares one last time that he is taking him back. The &quot;Beautiful Dreamer&quot; theme soars. Calming, Kemp asks her if she still wants to try California. He begins to dig the grave, and she makes coffee.

==Historical inaccuracies==
The 6th Cavalry Regiment was stationed in Texas in 1868. Fort Ellis was actually under the command of the 2nd Cavalry Regiment. The actors carry Colt Model of 1873 Peacemaker revolvers, which did not exist in 1868. The rifles are also anachronistic, with the Winchester having an iron/steel receiver, which was not available until 1873 (earlier models were brass), and the Marlin having side ejection, which was not available until 1889. Both the Bozeman Trail and Fort Ellis are referenced, both of which are in Montana, not Colorado. The Blackfoot tribe lived in Montana and Canada, not Colorado.

==Production==

&quot;The Naked Spur&quot; was the third of five Western collaborations between James Stewart and Anthony Mann and the third of eight overall collaborations. The two previous Westerns were &quot;Winchester &#x27;73&quot; (1950) and &quot;Bend of the River&quot; (1952). Stewart was given the lead role of Howard Kemp, an embittered rancher turned bounty hunter. The film is notable for having only five speaking parts. There were a number of parts of a band of Native Americans that were ambushed by Anderson.

Robert Ryan, known for his roles as ruthless villains and hard-boiled cops, was cast as Ben Vandergroat, a wild killer with a $5,000 &quot;dead or alive&quot; bounty on his head for the murder of a Kansas marshal. Ryan would work with Mann again in &quot;Men in War&quot; (1957) and &quot;God&#x27;s Little Acre&quot; (1958). Janet Leigh was cast as Lina Patch, Vandergroat&#x27;s companion who eventually falls in love with Kemp. Leigh starred alongside Ryan in the film noir &quot;Act of Violence&quot; (1948), which was directed by Fred Zinnemann. Ralph Meeker was cast as Roy Anderson, a disgraced Army officer.

Millard Mitchell, who played Jesse Tate, a grizzled old prospector, died at fifty years of age from lung cancer shortly after this picture. This was his next-to-last movie, followed by &quot;Here Come the Girls&quot; (released October 1953), starring Bob Hope.

The film was filmed in Lone Pine, California, and on location in the San Juan Mountains and Durango in Colorado. In an interview conducted in 1967, Mann described it as &quot;magnificent countryside and everything lent itself to improvisation. I never understood why almost all westerns are shot in desert landscapes! John Ford, for example, adores Monument Valley, but I know Monument Valley very well and it’s not the whole West. In fact, the desert represents only one part of the American West. I wanted to show the mountains, the waterfalls, the forested areas, the snowy summits – in short to rediscover the whole Daniel Boone atmosphere: the characters emerge more fully from such an environment. In that sense the shooting of &quot;The Naked Spur&quot; gave me some genuine satisfaction.&quot;

According to writer and historian Frederic B. Wildfang, during filming Stewart dedicated a monument in town, marking the area as the &quot;Hollywood of the Rockies&quot;. Production started in late May and ended in June 1952.

==Reception==

The film premiered in the first day of February 1953. That same year, two other films directed by Mann and starring Stewart were also released. These were &quot;Thunder Bay&quot; and &quot;The Glenn Miller Story&quot;.

Jonathan Rosenbaum would later hail &quot;The Naked Spur&quot; as a masterpiece as well as &quot;Mann’s best and most elemental western,&quot; writing that it had &quot;some of the most intense psychological warfare to be found in Mann’s angular and anguished oeuvre.&quot; &quot;Empire&quot; also hailed the movie as &quot;a masterpiece that’s too easy to take for granted&quot; and &quot;the best of an outstanding run of Westerns.&quot;

The movie holds a perfect 100% rating on Rotten Tomatoes.

According to MGM records the film earned $2,423,000 in the US and Canada and $1,427,000 overseas, resulting in a profit to the studio of $1,081,000.

This success ensured three more Stewart-Mann collaborations, including two more Westerns. Screenwriters Sam Rolfe and Harold Jack Bloom were nominated for the 1953 Best Screenplay Academy Award. In the years since its release, the film has achieved continued success, gaining more critical acclaim now than upon first release. Leonard Maltin has lauded &quot;The Naked Spur&quot; as &quot;one of the best westerns ever made&quot;.

Although much is made of the collaboration between James Stewart and Anthony Mann, Robert Ryan also teamed with Mann in &quot;The Naked Spur&quot;, &quot;Men in War&quot;, and &quot;God&#x27;s Little Acre&quot;.

<text>Nashville is a 1975 American musical comedy drama film directed and produced by Robert Altman. The film follows various people involved in the country and gospel music industry in Nashville, Tennessee, over the five-day period leading up to a gala concert for a populist outsider running for president on the Replacement Party ticket.

&quot;Nashville&quot; is often noted for its scope; the film contains 24 main characters, an hour&#x27;s worth of musical numbers, and multiple storylines. Its large ensemble cast includes David Arkin, Barbara Baxley, Ned Beatty, Karen Black, Ronee Blakley, Timothy Brown, Keith Carradine, Geraldine Chaplin, Robert DoQui, Shelley Duvall, Allen Garfield, Henry Gibson, Scott Glenn, Jeff Goldblum, Barbara Harris, David Hayward, Michael Murphy, Allan F. Nicholls, Dave Peel, Cristina Raines, Bert Remsen, Lily Tomlin, Gwen Welles, Keenan Wynn and Thomas Hal Phillips.

The screenplay for &quot;Nashville&quot; was written by Altman&#x27;s frequent collaborator Joan Tewkesbury, based partly on her experiences as an outsider visiting the city and observing its local music industry. Several incidents she experienced appear in the finished film, though Altman improvised numerous additional scenes and plot strands during filming. The film was shot on location in Nashville in 1974.

&quot;Nashville&quot; was released by Paramount Pictures in the summer of 1975, and opened with widespread critical acclaim, praising the ensemble cast (mainly Blakley and Tomlin), mise-en-scène and soundtrack. It garnered numerous accolades, including five Academy Award nominations, including Best Picture, Best Director, Best Supporting Actress (for both Ronee Blakley and Lily Tomlin), and winning for Best Original Song for Carradine&#x27;s track &quot;I&#x27;m Easy&quot;. The film was nominated for a total of 11 Golden Globe Awards, to date the highest number of nominations received by one film. Since then, it has been considered Altman&#x27;s &quot;magnum opus&quot;, and one of the greatest films of all time. In 1992, the film was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant&quot;.

==Plot==
Hal Philip Walker, Replacement Party candidate in the 1976 United States presidential election, arrives in Nashville for a fundraising gala. Meanwhile, two recording sessions are taking place in a nearby studio: in one room, country superstar Haven Hamilton records a patriotic song commemorating the Bicentennial, while next door, Linnea Reese, a white gospel singer, records a song with the Jubilee Singers of historically black Fisk University. Opal, an Englishwoman who claims to be working on a documentary for the BBC (though she refers to the British Broadcasting Company), attempts to listen in on the sessions.

Later that day, country singer Barbara Jean returns to Nashville following what the crowd believes was a burn accident (which may actually have been a nervous breakdown and stay at a mental hospital). She is greeted at Berry Field by local industry elites, including Haven and his companion, Lady Pearl, a nightclub owner. Also present are Pfc. Glenn Kelly, who is obsessed with Barbara Jean, and a popular folk trio consisting of married couple Bill and Mary, and guitarist Tom, who are in town to record an album. Meanwhile, Martha, a teen groupie going by the name &quot;L.A. Joan&quot;, is picked up by her uncle, Mr. Green, at the airport; she has arrived to visit her dying aunt Esther, but covertly plans to pursue musicians. In the airport cafe, African-American cook Wade Cooley and his co-worker, a waitress named Sueleen, discuss her aspirations to become a singer.

On the tarmac, Barbara Jean collapses from heat exhaustion, and those in attendance depart the airport only to become stranded after a vehicle pile-up occurs. During the commotion, Winifred, an aspiring country singer, runs away from her husband Star; Star then gives a ride to Kenny Frasier, who has just arrived in town carrying a violin case. Opal takes advantage of the traffic jam to interview Linnea, as well as Tommy Brown, an African-American country singer. That night, Sueleen performs at an open mic at Lady Pearl&#x27;s club, demonstrating no singing ability. Meanwhile, Linnea&#x27;s husband Del has John Triplette, Walker&#x27;s political organizer, over for dinner. Throughout the meal, Linnea mainly focuses on communicating with her two deaf children. Tom, who crossed paths with Linnea a few weeks earlier, phones the house to ask Linnea on a date, but she dissuades him. Glamorous singer Connie White performs that night, in lieu of Barbara Jean at the Grand Ole Opry. Mary misses Connie&#x27;s performance to Bill&#x27;s dismay, instead having sex with Tom at the hotel. At the hospital, Barbara Jean argues with her manager husband Barnett over Connie replacing her, and he accuses her of having another nervous breakdown.

On Sunday morning, Lady Pearl, Wade, and Sueleen attend a Catholic mass, while Linnea sings in the choir of a black Baptist church. In the hospital chapel, Barbara Jean sings &quot;In the Garden&quot; from her wheelchair while Mr. Green, Pfc. Kelly, and others watch. Opal wanders through a massive auto scrapyard, recording observations on a tape recorder. Haven, Tommy, and their families attend the stock car races, where Winifred unsuccessfully attempts to sing on a small stage. Bill and Mary argue in their hotel room and are interrupted by Triplette, who recruits them to perform at the gala, while Tom tries to get chauffeur Norman to score him drugs.

After Barbara Jean is discharged, she gives a performance at Opryland USA that ends in her being pulled off stage as she rambles between songs. To remediate her poor performance, Barnett pledges her to perform at Walker&#x27;s gala. Martha meanwhile agitates Kenny, who is renting a room in her uncle&#x27;s house, when she attempts to open his violin case. At Lady Pearl&#x27;s club that night, Linnea, Martha, Bill, Mary, Opal, Norman and Wade are among those attending an open mic. Tom sings &quot;I&#x27;m Easy&quot; and Linnea, moved, goes back to his room, where they have sex. Tom is accustomed to women becoming clingy and emotional after trysts but Linnea is polite but detached afterwards. She leaves Tom&#x27;s room oblivious to his blatant attempts to rattle her and make her jealous, frustrating him. Meanwhile, at an all-male Walker fundraiser, Sueleen is booed off stage for singing poorly; Del and Triplette convince her to perform a striptease in exchange for a slot at the gala. A drunken Del later comes onto Sueleen, but Wade rescues her. He tells her that she cannot sing and attempts to persuade her to come to Detroit with him; she refuses, determined to &quot;sing with Barbara Jean&quot;.

The next morning, the performers and audience converge at the Parthenon for Walker&#x27;s gala concert. The lineup consists of Haven, Barbara Jean, Linnea and her choir, Mary and Tom, and Sueleen; Winifred arrives, hoping to sing. Meanwhile, Mr. Green and Kenny arrive at the gala searching for Martha, who has failed to attend her aunt Esther&#x27;s funeral, and find her accompanying Bill. During Barbara Jean&#x27;s set on stage, Kenny produces a gun from his violin case, and begins shooting at the stage. Barbara Jean is shot; a bullet grazes Haven&#x27;s arm. Chaos breaks out. Kelly disarms Kenny. Barbara Jean is carried off the stage, bleeding and unconscious (or dead). Haven tries to calm the crowd by exhorting them to sing, asserting that &quot;This isn&#x27;t Dallas.” Being wounded, he gives over the mike to Winifred, who haltingly begins singing &quot;It Don&#x27;t Worry Me&quot;, eventually joined by Linnea&#x27;s gospel choir also on stage.

==Cast==
Major characters

Minor characters
* Richard Baskin, the film&#x27;s musical supervisor, wrote several of the songs performed in the film. He has a cameo as Frog, a session musician, appearing in several scenes.
* Merle Kilgore as Trout, the owner of a club that has an open-mic talent night that gives Sueleen Gay what she believes is her big break as a singer.
There are cameo appearances by Elliott Gould, Julie Christie, Sue Barton, Vassar Clements, and Howard K. Smith, all playing themselves. Gould and Christie were passing through Nashville when Altman added them. Altman plays Bob, an unseen producer who in the beginning of the film is producing Haven Hamilton&#x27;s song &quot;200 Years&quot;. He can be heard on a speaker when Hamilton gets agitated by Frog&#x27;s inept piano playing.

==Analysis and themes==
In a 1995 academic article published in &quot;American Quarterly&quot;, Paul Lauter, a professor of American Studies at Trinity College, compared the film to &quot;a poststructuralist theoretical text&quot;, adding that &quot;it invites, indeed valorizes, contradiction and seems designed to resist closure.&quot; As a result, he explained, &quot;interpretations of the film have been wildly divergent and evaluations contradictory.&quot;

===Political content===
Film scholars Yoram Allon, Del Cullen, and Hannah Patterson describe &quot;Nashville&quot; as an &quot;epic study of ambition, greed, talent, and politics in American culture, with the country and western music businesses serving as a microcosm of American society.&quot; Ray Sawhill of &quot;Salon&quot; views the film as reflective of the 1970s&#x27; political climate, writing that the film &quot;comes across as a piece of New Journalism; it&#x27;s like Norman Mailer&#x27;s reports from conventions and rallies. Altman is using Nashville metaphorically—he&#x27;s really talking about politics. I wish he didn&#x27;t make that quite so explicit. There&#x27;s a reference to Dallas and a few to the Kennedys, as well as some red-white-and-blue visual cues, that the film could have done without. Still, the result is an X-ray of the era&#x27;s uneasy political soul. What it reveals is a country trying to pull itself together from a nervous breakdown.&quot;

===Celebrity===
Sawhill suggests that the film is preoccupied with &quot;a populist culture driving itself mad with celebrity&quot; and presents Nashville as a &quot;provincial New York or Hollywood, as one of the places where the culture manufactures its image of itself.&quot; He cites the various recording and communication devices present as evidence of this: &quot;wires, phones, intercoms, cameras, mikes, speakers—seem to be everywhere; so does the machinery of publicity and fame. We watch the city recording itself, playing itself back to itself and marketing that image to itself. We eavesdrop on the culture&#x27;s conversation with itself. We&#x27;re watching people decide how they want to see themselves and how they want to sell themselves.&quot;

==Production==
===Screenplay===

In the 1970s, United Artists attempted to hire Robert Altman to direct a screenplay about country-western music titled &quot;The Great Southern Amusement Company&quot;. Altman declined but became interested in directing a film on the subject after reading William Price Fox&#x27;s novel &quot;Ruby Red&quot;, and agreed to make an original film for UA. The original screenplay for &quot;Nashville&quot; was written by Joan Tewkesbury, who had collaborated with Altman on several of his films, including &quot;McCabe &amp; Mrs. Miller&quot; (1971) and &quot;Thieves Like Us&quot; (1974). She had proposed a Nashville-set film to Altman prior to his filming of &quot;McCabe &amp; Mrs. Miller&quot;; he became interested in the setting and sent Tewkesbury to Nashville in the fall of 1973 to observe the area and its citizenry. Tewkesbury&#x27;s diary of her trip provided the basis for the screenplay, with many observations making it into the finished film, such as the highway pileup. However, as with most Altman projects, much of the dialogue was improvised with the script acting as a &quot;blueprint&quot; dictating the actions of the characters and the plot.

Tewkesbury, who was working as an instructor at the University of Southern California, rewrote her screenplay several times. In the original draft, the film opened with a scene featuring Tom on the street in New York City prior to his arrival in Nashville. Tewkesbury had been partly inspired to write the film based on her observations of the music industry being geographically &quot;pulled apart. The country-western thing had suddenly exploded in Nashville, but [musicians] still had to come to New York for getting paid, and business deals.&quot; None of Tewkesbury&#x27;s incarnations of the screenplay featured any death scenes, but Altman, who had a &quot;penchant for the tragic denouement&quot;, proposed the idea that Barbara Jean would be assassinated in the finale. Altman also conceived the political subplot about the presidential candidate Hal Philip Walker. The political speeches and dialogue for this subplot were written by Altman&#x27;s colleague Thomas Hal Phillips, whose brother Rubel Phillips had run as the Republican Party candidate in the 1963 and 1967 Mississippi gubernatorial elections.

Numerous characters in &quot;Nashville&quot; are based on real country music figures: Henry Gibson&#x27;s Haven Hamilton is a composite of Roy Acuff, Hank Snow, and Porter Wagoner; Ronee Blakley&#x27;s Barbara Jean is based on Loretta Lynn; the black country singer Tommy Brown (played by Timothy Brown) is based on Charley Pride; and the feuding folk trio is based on Peter, Paul and Mary; within the trio, the married couple of Bill and Mary were inspired by Bill Danoff and Taffy Nivert, who later became Starland Vocal Band. Keith Carradine&#x27;s character is believed to be inspired by Kris Kristofferson, and Karen Black&#x27;s Connie White was conceived as a composite of Lynn Anderson (who spoke unfavorably of the film after its release), Tammy Wynette, and Dolly Parton. Other characters were based on or inspired by real persons: Linnea was inspired by Louise Fletcher, who had appeared in Altman&#x27;s &quot;Thieves Like Us&quot; (1973), and who had two deaf parents. The black choir singing with Linnea early in the film is based on the Fisk Jubilee Singers, though it&#x27;s disputed whether the performers in the film were actually Fisk University students or members of the B. C. &amp; M. (Baptist, Catholic, and Methodist) Choir, a black interdenominational gospel choir based in Nashville. Altman also hired television reporter Howard K. Smith to deliver a commentary on Hal Philip Walker, for which he instructed him to say anything he wanted either for or against his fictional candidacy.

Although UA had originally agreed to produce the script, the studio reneged because it was unsatisfied with the financial performance of Altman&#x27;s previous films &quot;The Long Goodbye&quot; (1973) and &quot;Thieves Like Us&quot; (1974). After unsuccessfully pitching the film to other studios, producer Jerry Weintraub secured a $2.7 million budget from ABC Records, which wanted to promote a record company it had interest in.

===Casting===
As with most of Altman&#x27;s feature films, he cast the roles using unorthodox methods, forgoing standard auditions and instead basing his decisions off meetings with individual actors. Geraldine Chaplin, daughter of Charlie Chaplin and Oona O&#x27;Neill, was the first to be cast, appearing in the role of Opal, the chatty journalist who has arrived from out of town to cover the gala. Screenwriter Tewkesbury, who had based the character of Opal on herself, selected Chaplin for the role long before the production had even secured funding. Altman flew Chaplin from her residence in Switzerland to Nashville, and she toured the city with Tewkesbury in preparation for the role.

Several Altman regulars were cast in the film, among them Keith Carradine as Tom, the dashing folk singer who woos several of the female characters, and Shelley Duvall as Martha, the young groupie. Both Carradine and Duvall had had minor roles in &quot;McCabe &amp; Mrs. Miller&quot;, and had co-starred in &quot;Thieves Like Us&quot;. Through Carradine, Altman met Allan Nicholls, Carradine&#x27;s co-star from a Broadway production of &quot;Hair&quot;. After a meeting, Altman offered Nicholls the role of Bill. Cristina Raines, Carradine&#x27;s real-life girlfriend at the time, was given the role of Mary, the female counterpart in Bill and Tom&#x27;s folk trio. Gwen Welles, who had a major part in Altman&#x27;s previous film, &quot;California Split&quot;, was cast as Sueleen, a waitress who longs to be a singer.

Karen Black was cast in the role of glamorous singer Connie White after having approached Altman to appear in a prior film, the psychological thriller &quot;Images&quot; (1972). Black, who had been writing and singing songs in the interim, was cast in &quot;Nashville&quot; after performing several original songs for Altman. The role of Barbara Jean had not been filled when filming was about to commence. Ronee Blakley, a singer-songwriter from Idaho with no acting experience, was in Nashville at the time and took on the role at the last minute, having been hired to write several songs for the film. Barbara Harris, primarily a stage actress, was given the role of fledgling singer Winifred.

In the role of Linnea Reese, the gospel singer and dedicated mother, Altman cast Lily Tomlin, who at the time had no prior film experience, having worked exclusively in television. Altman had originally cast Louise Fletcher in the role, but Tomlin was hired after Fletcher replaced her as Nurse Ratched in &quot;One Flew Over the Cuckoo&#x27;s Nest&quot; (1975). &quot;When I got the script, I didn&#x27;t even know what part I was being considered for,&quot; Tomlin recalled. &quot;But I thought, I could play any one of these parts. Even the boys.&quot; Ned Beatty was cast as Del, Linnea&#x27;s lawyer husband. Robert Duvall was initially sought for the role of Haven Hamilton, the country superstar, but he declined the role based on Altman&#x27;s low salary offer. Instead, Altman cast Henry Gibson in the part. Altman struggled finding an actor to portray Bud Hamilton, the Harvard-graduate son of country superstar Haven. While preparing for his role as Haven, Gibson began taking guitar lessons in Santa Monica, and met David Peel, a guitar instructor, who bore a significant resemblance to him. After meeting with Peel, Altman cast him as Bud.

===Filming===
The film was shot on location in Nashville in the summer of 1974 on a budget of $2.2 million. In late June, the cast began arriving in Nashville; Carradine and Raines traveled together from Los Angeles, while Beatty arrived and hitched a camper where he resided along with his wife through the duration of the shoot. Beatty recalled an early meeting in which Altman had the cast convene prior to filming: &quot;Bob gets us together in this room. We&#x27;re all ready to start the movie. And he said, &#x27;Look, I want you to have fun with this. There is only one thing we have to remember. Every character in this movie loves one character. Every one of these characters loves Barbara Jean.&#x27; Well, within a short time Ronee Blakley was the only actor in the film who was universally disliked.&quot; Throughout the shoot, Altman and Blakley had several disputes regarding her character, and Blakley sometimes rewrote her scenes to Altman&#x27;s dismay.
Locations featured in the film include the Nashville International Airport, and the Exit/In, a Nashville club which screenwriter Tewkesbury had frequented during her trips there. The scene in which Carradine&#x27;s character performs &quot;I&#x27;m Easy&quot; was shot at this club. Altman&#x27;s log cabin-style house on the outskirts of Nashville was used as the home of Haven and Lady Pearl. The film&#x27;s climactic assassination sequence, which takes places at the Parthenon, was originally intended to take place at the Ryman Auditorium. However, Altman was forced to change the locale when he was unable to secure access to the then-recently shuttered Ryman Auditorium. Walker, the climactic assassination, the political theme and various associated characters (such as Haven Hamilton) do not appear in the earliest versions of the script, and were integrated into the screenplay throughout filming.

All of the musical scenes featured in the film are actual live concert footage.

The hospital scenes centered on Barbara Jean were filmed in a local hospital that had been closed; one floor of it was refurbished for use in filming.

Nearly all of the extras in the film were Nashville locals. Many of them were not actively participating in the film but simply happened to be at the location where the cast and crew were filming at the time. Recording session legend Lloyd Green (&quot;Mr. Nashville Sound&quot;) can be seen playing pedal steel guitar in the opening studio scene. Jeff Newman, known for the pedal steel, is sitting next to him playing a banjo.

===Post-production===
&quot;Nashville&quot;&#x27;s opening title sequence was designed by the film title designer Dan Perri, who had recently enjoyed his big break with his work on &quot;The Exorcist&quot; (1973). Under Altman&#x27;s direction, Perri based the film&#x27;s unusual, kitschy title sequence on low-budget K-Tel Records television commercials, and brought in Johnny Grant to provide the loud, brash voiceover. Perri later went on to design titles for a number of other major Hollywood pictures, including &quot;Taxi Driver&quot; (1976), &quot;Star Wars&quot; (1977), and &quot;Raging Bull&quot; (1980).

Altman had enough footage to produce a four-hour film, and assistant director Alan Rudolph suggested he create an expanded version of &quot;Nashville&quot; to be shown in two parts, &quot;Nashville Red&quot; and &quot;Nashville Blue&quot;, but the film ultimately remained intact. After a rush of critical acclaim, ABC expressed interest in a proposal for a 10-hour miniseries of &quot;Nashville&quot;, based on the footage not used in the final cut, but plans for the project were scrapped. The additional footage has not been made available on DVD releases.

However, in a 2000 interview with &quot;The A.V. Club&quot;, Altman disputed the claim that he had several hours worth of deleted scenes to cut another feature-length film (or two) out of. Altman claimed that there &quot;were no deleted scenes&quot; and that &quot;almost everything we shot is in that film&quot;. Altman further stated the unseen, extra footage that wasn&#x27;t used in the final cut of the film was mainly music and not much else.

===Music===

Many of the actors and actresses in the film composed the songs they performed in the film. Blakley wrote several tracks, including &quot;Bluebird&quot;, performed by Timothy Brown, and &quot;Tapedeck in His Tractor&quot; and &quot;My Idaho Home&quot;, performed by Blakley. Karen Black wrote &quot;Memphis&quot; and &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, the two songs she performed in the character of Connie White. Carradine wrote and performed &quot;I&#x27;m Easy&quot;, which won an Academy Award for Best Original Song and a Golden Globe for Best Original Song - Motion Picture. Additionally, Carradine wrote &quot;It Don&#x27;t Worry Me&quot;, which is heard on the soundtrack throughout the film, and is the closing number performed by Barbara Harris onstage at the Parthenon.

Composer Richard Baskin composed songs for Henry Gibson to sing in character as Haven Hamilton. Several Nashville session musicians took part in the music recording and in the film, including violinist Vassar Clements and guitarist Harold Bradley. &quot;Keep a Goin&quot; was based on a poem Gibson recited on The Dick Van Dyke Show &quot;Talk to the Snail&quot; Season 5 Episode 24.

While the music featured in the film was viewed in the Nashville music industry as mean-spirited satire, the songs have achieved a cult-status among alternative country musicians. In 2002, the album, &quot;A Tribute to Robert Altman&#x27;s Nashville&quot; was released, featuring interpretations of the film&#x27;s songs by Canadian alt-country figures, including Carolyn Mark, Kelly Hogan and Neko Case.

ABC Records issued a motion picture soundtrack to the film in 1975, featuring the various original musical numbers. It was reissued by MCA Nashville in 2015.

==Release==
===Box office===
The film was a box-office success, with theatrical rentals of $6.8 million in North America by 1976. According to a piece in &quot;Film Comment,&quot; &quot;it is still amazing to me that the impression was so prevalent in the cultural reaches of Manhattan that &quot;Nashville&quot; was one of the year&#x27;s commercial blockbusters rather than, as it was, the twenty-seventh highest-grossing film of the year.&quot; The film grossed approximately $10 million in the United States.

===Critical response===
&quot;Nashville&quot; received significant attention from critics, with Patrick McGilligan of &quot;The Boston Globe&quot; writing that it was &quot;perhaps the most talked about American movie since Orson Welles&#x27; &quot;Citizen Kane&quot;. Pauline Kael, film critic for The New Yorker, described it as &quot;the funniest epic vision of America ever to reach the screen&quot;. Gene Siskel, Roger Ebert, and Leonard Maltin gave the film four-star reviews and called it the best film of 1975. In his original review, Ebert wrote &quot;after I saw it I felt more alive, I felt I understood more about people, I felt somehow wiser. It&#x27;s that good a movie.&quot; On August 6, 2000, Ebert included it in his The Great Movies compilation.

Vincent Canby of &quot;The New York Times&quot; praised the film&#x27;s music as &quot;funny, moving and almost nonstop&quot; as well as its &quot;well‐defined structure, [in which] individual sequences often burst with the kind of life that seems impossible to plan.&quot; Writing for the &quot;New York Daily News&quot;, Harry Haun praised the film&#x27;s attention to detail and characterization, noting: &quot;I have seen &quot;Nashville&quot; 4½ times, and I&#x27;m still discovering dimensions that had eluded me.&quot; Charles Champlin of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; praised the humor, which he noted as ranging &quot;from slapstick to satire&quot;, and commended the film as &quot;the most original and provocative American movie in a very long time.&quot;

According to film critic Ruth McCormick, however, after an initial wave of praise, a critical backlash ensued. &quot;Robert Mazzocco in &quot;The New York Review of Books&quot;, Greil Marcus in &quot;The Village Voice&quot; and John Malone in &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote articles that ranged from debunking the hype and calling &quot;Nashville&quot; superficial and overrated, to absolutely hating the film for its aesthetic shortcomings or its purported pessimism, cynicism and sexism.&quot;

===Controversy===
The film was widely despised by the mainstream country-music community at the time of its release; many artists believed it ridiculed their talent and sincerity. Altman felt they were mad because he chose not to use their music in favor of letting the actors compose their own material. However, he stated the movie has since become popular in the city among more recent generations.

The film garnered further attention in 1980 due to its climactic shooting scene of Barbara Jean, as it predated, but eerily mirrored, what would be the murder of John Lennon. In an interview on 2000 DVD release, Altman remarks that after Lennon&#x27;s death, reporters questioned the director about &quot;Nashville&quot; and its harbinger of the assassination of a music star.

:Robert Altman: &quot;When John Lennon was assassinated, I got a call immediately from the &quot;Washington Post&quot; and they said, &#x27;Do you feel responsible for this?&#x27; and I said &#x27;What do you mean, responsible?&#x27; &#x27;Well, I mean you&#x27;re the one that predicted there would be a political assassination of a star.&#x27; And I said &#x27;Well, I don&#x27;t feel responsible,&#x27; but I said, &#x27;but don&#x27;t you feel responsible for not heeding my warning?&#x27; The statement here is, these people are not assassinated because of their ideas or what they do. They&#x27;re assassinated to draw attention to the assassin. And in political assassinations, in their sort of warped minds, they know that they are going to have a certain amount of people who said &#x27;that son of a bitch [the politician] should have been shot,&#x27; because there&#x27;s such heat about it. But actually what they are doing is killing somebody who&#x27;s in the public eye and is some sort of an icon. Because this feeling that by doing that, committing that assassination they draw the attention to themselves, and they make themselves consequently important. Ah, and it&#x27;s no surprise to me, the Lennon assassination, because this is what all that is, and I don&#x27;t think we have seen the end of it either.&quot;

===Home media===
Paramount Home Video released &quot;Nashville&quot; on VHS and DVD in 2000. In 2016, The Criterion Collection released a Blu-ray edition of the film featuring a new scan and supplemental features, including an archival commentary with Altman as well as archival interviews, and a new documentary piece.

==Accolades==
&quot;Nashville&quot; received numerous awards and nominations from various critical organizations, including a total of 11 Golden Globe nominations, which, as of 2024, are the most ever received by one film. It received four nominations in a single acting category; this was and remains unprecedented for major film award shows.

It won a BAFTA Film Award for Best Sound Track. Altman won for best director from: Cartagena Film Festival; Kansas City Film Critics Circle Awards; National Board of Review; National Society of Film Critics Awards; and the New York Film Critics Circle Awards. Lily Tomlin was awarded the New York Film Critics Circle for Best Supporting Actress. It became the first, and one of the eight (as of 2024) films to win Best Picture from three out of four major U.S. film critics&#x27; groups (LA, NBR, NY, NSFC) along with &quot;All the President&#x27;s Men&quot;, &quot;Terms of Endearment&quot;, &quot;Goodfellas,&quot; &quot;Pulp Fiction&quot;, &quot;The Hurt Locker,&quot; &quot;Drive My Car&quot;, and &quot;TÁR&quot;.

==Legacy==
Plans were discussed for a sequel set 12 years later and titled &quot;Nashville 12&quot;, and most of the original players agreed to appear. In the script for the sequel, Lily Tomlin&#x27;s character, Linnea, is running for political office; and Barnett now managing Connie White and obsessed with a Barbara Jean impersonator.

Contemporarily, &quot;Nashville&quot; is regarded in critical circles as Altman&#x27;s magnum opus, as well as one of the greatest films of all time. In 1992, &quot;Nashville&quot; was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant&quot;. In 2007, the movie was ranked No. 59 on AFI&#x27;s 100 Years... 100 Movies - 10th Anniversary Edition list; it did not appear on the original 1998 list. The song &quot;I&#x27;m Easy&quot; was named the 81st Best Song of All Time by the American Film Institute (AFI). In 2013, &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; ranked it the ninth-greatest film in history. &quot;Nashville&quot; ranked 14th in BBC&#x27;s 2015 list of the 100 greatest American films.

<text>Theodoric is a Germanic given name. First attested as a Gothic name in the 5th century, it became widespread in the Germanic-speaking world, not least due to its most famous bearer, Theodoric the Great, king of the Ostrogoths.

==Overview==
The name was Latinized as &quot;Theodoricus&quot; or &quot;Theodericus&quot;, originally from a Common Germanic form &quot;*&quot; (&quot;people-ruler&quot;) from *&quot;&quot; (&quot;people&quot;) and *&quot;&quot;, which would have resulted in a Gothic *𐌸𐌹𐌿𐌳𐌰𐍂𐌴𐌹𐌺𐍃 (*þiudareiks). Anglicized spellings of the name during Late Antiquity and the Early Middle Ages include &quot;Theodoric&quot;, &quot;Theoderic&quot;, &quot;Theudoric&quot;, &quot;Theuderic&quot;.
Gregory of Tours Latinized the name as &quot;Theodorus&quot;, in origin the unrelated Greek name Theodore (Θεόδωρος, meaning &quot;God&#x27;s gift&quot;).

As the name survived throughout the Middle Ages, it transformed into a multitude of forms in the languages of Western Europe.
These include the High German form &quot;Dietrich&quot;, abbreviated &quot;Dieter&quot;, the Low German and Dutch form &quot;Diederik&quot;, or &quot;Dierik&quot;, abbreviated &quot;Dirck&quot;, &quot;Dirk&quot;, &quot;Dik&quot; or &quot;Diede&quot;, the Norwegian &quot;Tjodrik&quot;, &quot;Diderik&quot; and &quot;Didrik&quot;. Of the Romance languages, French has &quot;Thierry&quot; and Italian, Portuguese and Spanish has &quot;Teodorico&quot;.

The English forms &quot;Derek&quot;, &quot;Derrick&quot; and &quot;Terry&quot; have been re-introduced from the continent, from Low German, Dutch and French sources. The derived Welsh form is &quot;Tewdrig&quot;; however, there also exists the related Welsh name &quot;Tudur&quot; (from Proto-Celtic &quot;*Toutorīxs&quot;, exactly cognate with Proto-Germanic &quot;*Þeudarīks&quot;) which is the origin of the name of the English Tudor dynasty.

==Late antiquity to early Middle Ages==

The earliest record of the name is in a Roman-era (3rd century) inscription, discovered in 1784 in Wiesbaden (at the time known as &quot;Aquae Mattiacorum&quot; in Germania Superior), edited in &quot;Codex inscriptionum romanarum Danubii et Rheni&quot; as no. 684: , interpreted as &quot;In honorem domus divinae, Apolloni toutiorigi&quot;.
This has given rise to a supposed &quot;Apollo Teutorix&quot; in 19th-century literature.
John Rhŷs (1892) opined that &quot;the interest attached to the word &quot;Toutiorix&quot; is out of all proportion to its single occurrence&quot;.
The existence of a genuinely Celtic name &quot;Teutorix&quot; or &quot;Tout(i)orix&quot; is uncertain, though Welsh &quot;Tudur&quot;, Old Welsh &quot;Tutir&quot; presupposes a precise cognate of &quot;Toutorix&quot; at least in ancient British Celtic.
Rhŷs surmises that the &quot;historical Teuton&quot; (viz. Theoderic the Great) bore a name of the Gaulish Apollo as adopted into early Germanic religion.

The first known bearer of the name was Theodoric I, son of Alaric I, king of the Visigoths (d. 451). The Gothic form of the name would have been &quot;Þiudareiks&quot;, which was Latinized as &quot;Theodericus&quot;. The notability of the name is due to Theoderic the Great, son of Theodemir, king of the Ostrogoths (454–526), who became a legendary figure of the Germanic Heroic Age as Dietrich von Bern.

After the end of late antiquity, during the 6th to 8th centuries there were also several kings of the Franks called Theodoric (or Theuderic).
Finally, there was an early Anglo-Saxon king of Bernicia called Theodric (also spelled &quot;Deoric&quot;, Old English &quot;&quot;).

*Theodoric I (died 451), king of the Visigoths
*Theodoric II (died 466), king of the Visigoths
*Theoderic the Great (454–526), ruler of the Ostrogoths, Italy, and the Visigoths
*Theodoric Strabo (died 481)
*Theuderic I (died 534), Frankish king
*Theuderic II (587–613), Frankish king
*Theuderic III (died 691), king of the Franks
*Theuderic IV (died 737), king of the Franks
*Theodric of Bernicia, 6th-century Anglo-Saxon king
*Theodoric of Mont d&#x27;Hor died 533), disciple of Saint Remigius who became abbot of Saint-Thierry Abbey near Reims, France
*Saint Tewdrig (alternatively Tewdric or Theodoric) (c. 580 – c. 630), Welsh king of Gwent and Glywysing, who was martyred fighting the Saxons
*Theodoric, Bishop of Minden (died 880)
*Theodoric I, Bishop of Paderborn (died 916)
*Dirk I, Count of Holland (c. 870 – 928/944), in Latin Theodoric
*Dirk II, Count of Holland (920/930–988)

==High and late Middle Ages==
While the Anglo-Saxon name &quot;Theodric&quot; (&quot;Deoric&quot;, old form: th = d) became extinct in the Middle English period, it was adopted in Welsh as &quot;Tewdrig&quot;.
The name remains popular in medieval German as &quot;Dietrich&quot;, and is adopted into French as &quot;Thierry&quot;. It is rendered in Medieval Latin as &quot;Theodoricus&quot; or as &quot;Theodericus&quot;.
The Middle High German legend of &quot;Dietrich von Bern&quot; is based on the historical Theodoric, king of the Ostrogoths. The German &quot;Dietrich von Bern&quot; is reflected as &quot;Þiðrekr af Bern&quot; in the Old Norse &quot;Þiðreks saga&quot;. The medieval German legend gives rise to the &quot;Dietrich&quot; of the Renaissance era &quot;Heldenbücher&quot;.
The Old Norse form of the name was Þjóðríkr (spelled þiaurikʀ on the 9th-century Rök runestone). This became &quot;Tjodrik&quot; in Middle Norwegian.

The Dutch form &quot;Derek&quot; was used in England from the 15th century. Similarly, the Scandinavian &quot;Tjodrik&quot; is attested for the 12th century, but it is replaced by the Low German forms &quot;Ditrik, Dirk&quot; in the late medieval period. The spread of the Low German form to Middle Norwegian, Middle Danish and late Middle English or Early Modern English are part of a larger linguistic trend due to the influence of the Hanseatic League during this period.

*Antipope Theodoric (died 1102)
*Thierry of Chartres (died before 1155), philosopher also known as Theodoric the Breton
*Theodoric the Monk, 12th-century Norwegian Benedictine monk
*Theoderic ( c. 1172), author of the &quot;Libellus de locis sanctis&quot;, a travelogue and pilgrim&#x27;s guide book of Palestine
*Theoderich von Treyden (died 1219), missionary and first bishop of Livonia
*Master Theodoric (before 1328? – 1381), court painter to Charles IV
*Theodoric of Freiberg (c.  1250 – c.  1311), German theologian and scientist
*Dirk III, Count of Holland (c. 982 – 1039), in Latin Theodoric
*Dirk IV, Count of Holland (c. 1020/1030 – 1049)
*Dirk V, Count of Holland (1052–1091)
*Dirk VI, Count of Holland (c. 1114–1157)
*Dirk VII, Count of Holland (died 1203)

==Modern era==
The German form &quot;Dietrich&quot; was abbreviated to &quot;Dieter&quot;. The Low German and Dutch languages abbreviated &quot;Diederik&quot; as &quot;Dirk&quot; or &quot;Diede&quot;. 
French retains &quot;Thierry&quot;.
The Scandinavian languages have borrowed &quot;Dirk&quot; and Diderik, replacing the native &quot;Tjodrik&quot;, while English borrowed &quot;Derek&quot; from Dutch and &quot;Terry&quot; from French.

==Fictional==
*Prince Theodoric, an exiled Balkan royal in London in the sequence of novels &quot;A Dance to the Music of Time&quot; by Anthony Powell—a character based to some extent on Prince Paul of Yugoslavia

<text>National Lampoon&#x27;s Animal House is a 1978 American comedy film directed by John Landis and written by Harold Ramis, Douglas Kenney and Chris Miller. It stars John Belushi, Tim Matheson, John Vernon, Verna Bloom, Thomas Hulce, and Donald Sutherland. The film is about a trouble-making fraternity whose members challenge the authority of the dean of the fictional Faber College.

Produced by Matty Simmons of &quot;National Lampoon&quot; and Ivan Reitman for Universal Pictures, it was inspired by stories written by Miller and published in &quot;National Lampoon&quot;, which were based on Ramis&#x27; experience in the Zeta Beta Tau fraternity at Washington University in St. Louis, Miller&#x27;s Alpha Delta Phi experiences at Dartmouth College in New Hampshire, and producer Reitman&#x27;s at McMaster University in Hamilton, Ontario.

Of the younger lead actors, only the 28-year-old Belushi was an established star, but even he had not yet appeared in a film, having gained fame as an original cast member of &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;, which was in its third season in the autumn of 1977. Several of the actors who were cast as college students, including Thomas Hulce, Karen Allen, and Kevin Bacon, were just beginning their film careers. Matheson, also cast as a student, was already a seasoned actor, having appeared in movies and television since the age of 13.

Filming took place at the University of Oregon from October to December 1977. Following its initial release on July 28, 1978, &quot;Animal House&quot; received generally mixed reviews from critics, but &quot;Time&quot; and Roger Ebert proclaimed it one of the year&#x27;s best. Filmed for only $3 million (equivalent to $ in today&#x27;s money) it garnered an estimated gross of more than $141 million ($ in today&#x27;s money) in the form of theatrical rentals and home video, not including merchandising, making it the highest grossing comedy film of its time.

The film, along with 1977&#x27;s &quot;The Kentucky Fried Movie&quot;, also directed by Landis, was largely responsible for defining and launching the gross-out film genre, which became one of Hollywood&#x27;s staples. &quot;Animal House&quot; is now regarded as one of the best comedy films of all time.

In 2001, the United States Library of Congress deemed &quot;National Lampoon&#x27;s Animal House&quot; &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant&quot; and selected it for preservation in the National Film Registry. It was No. 1 on Bravo&#x27;s &quot;100 Funniest Movies&quot;. It was No. 36 on AFI&#x27;s &quot;100 Years... 100 Laughs&quot; list of the 100 best American comedies. In 2008, &quot;Empire&quot; magazine selected it as No. 279 of &quot;The 500 Greatest Movies of All Time&quot;.

==Plot==
In the fall of 1962, Faber College freshmen Larry Kroger and Kent Dorfman are seeking to join a fraternity. Finding themselves ostracized at the exclusive Omega Theta Pi house party, the two visit the ramshackle Delta Tau Chi house next door. Kent believes that Delta will have to accept him as a &quot;legacy&quot; since his older brother was a member. They meet John Blutarsky (&quot;Bluto&quot;), chapter president Robert Hoover (&quot;Hoov&quot;), smooth-talking ladies&#x27; man Eric Stratton (&quot;Otter&quot;), motorcyclist Daniel Simpson Day (&quot;D-Day&quot;), Donald Schoenstein (&quot;Boon&quot;), and Boon&#x27;s frustrated girlfriend Katy. Larry and Kent are accepted as Delta pledges and given the fraternity names &quot;Pinto&quot; and &quot;Flounder,&quot; respectively. Meanwhile, pledge Chip Diller is accepted into Omega house and given a paddling as part of his initiation.

The Delta house is on probation due to numerous conduct violations and overall poor academic standing. Wishing to remove the troublemaking fraternity from Faber&#x27;s campus, Dean Vernon Wormer elevates the Deltas to &quot;double secret probation&quot; and directs Greg Marmalard, the Omega&#x27;s president, to get fellow Omega and ROTC Cadet Commander Douglas C. Neidermeyer to find a reason to revoke Delta&#x27;s charter. Various incidents increase the already deep animosity between Delta, Omega, and Wormer, including the accidental death of Neidermeyer&#x27;s horse during a retaliatory prank following the bullying of ROTC member Flounder by Niedermeyer. Unbeknownst to Marmalard, Otter has had sex with Mandy Pepperidge, Marmalard&#x27;s girlfriend.

Later, Bluto and D-Day are directed to steal the answer key to an upcoming midterm exam from the trash, unaware that the Omegas have switched it for a fake. All of the Deltas fail the exam, and their grade-point averages drop so low that Wormer tells them he needs only one more incident to revoke their charter and have them permanently expelled from campus.

Unfazed, the Deltas organize a toga party and recruit Pinto and Flounder to shoplift from a supermarket as a fraternity prank. At the market, Pinto meets a pretty young cashier named Clorette and invites her to the party, while Otter flirts with an older woman, who turns out to be Dean Wormer&#x27;s alcoholic wife, Marion. During the toga party, at which Otis Day and the Knights perform, Otter seduces Marion, while Pinto and Clorette make out until she passes out, drunk. Pinto resists the temptation to have his way with her while she is unconscious and instead delivers her home in a shopping cart. He later discovers that she is the 13-year-old daughter of Carmine DePasto, the corrupt mayor of the city of Faber.

Wormer organizes a kangaroo court led by the Omegas, which revokes the Deltas&#x27; charter and confiscates the contents of their house. Otter, Boon, Pinto, and Flounder take a road trip in a car Flounder has borrowed from his brother. After reading about the recent death of a student at a nearby all-female college, Otter poses as her fiancé in order to find dates for himself and the others. The ruse works and the Deltas, along with their dates, stop at a club where Otis Day and the Knights are performing, unaware that the clientele is exclusively African-American. Some of the patrons deliberately intimidate the Deltas into abandoning their dates and fleeing the club, damaging both their car and several others in the parking lot.

The next morning, Boon discovers Katy has spent the night with English professor Dave Jennings. Babs Jansen, herself in love with Marmalard, informs him that Mandy and Otter have been having an affair; Marmalard has Babs lure Otter to a motel where the Omegas beat him up. Due to the Deltas&#x27; dismal midterm grades, Wormer expels them all from Faber and gleefully tells them he has notified their local draft boards that they are now all eligible for military service. The Deltas initially concede defeat until Bluto rallies the fraternity to seek revenge during the annual Homecoming parade. D-Day converts the heavily damaged car into an armored vehicle, which the Deltas conceal inside a cake-shaped breakaway parade float. The Deltas wreak havoc during the parade and crash into the reviewing stand, knocking it down, after which the fates of the characters are revealed. Marmalard and Neidermeyer suffer unfortunate events later in life, while most of the Deltas become successful professionals, with Bluto eventually being elected a United States Senator.

==Production==

===Development===
&quot;Animal House&quot; was the first film produced by &quot;National Lampoon&quot;, the most popular humor magazine on college campuses in the mid-1970s. The periodical specialized in satirizing politics and popular culture. Many of the magazine&#x27;s writers were recent college graduates, hence its appeal to students all over the country. Doug Kenney was a &quot;Lampoon&quot; writer and the magazine&#x27;s first editor-in-chief. He graduated from Harvard University in 1969 and had a college experience closer to the Omegas in the film (he had been president of the university&#x27;s elite Spee Club). Kenney was responsible for the first appearances of three characters that appeared in the film: Larry Kroger, Mandy Pepperidge, and Vernon Wormer. They made their debut in 1973&#x27;s &quot;National Lampoon&#x27;s High School Yearbook&quot;, a satire of a Middle America 1964 high school yearbook. Kroger&#x27;s and Pepperidge&#x27;s characters in the yearbook were effectively the same as their characters in the movie, whereas Vernon Wormer was a P.E. and civics teacher as well as an athletic coach in the yearbook.

However, Kenney felt that fellow &quot;Lampoon&quot; writer Chris Miller was the magazine&#x27;s expert on the college experience. Faced with an impending deadline, Miller submitted a chapter from his then-abandoned memoirs entitled &quot;The Night of the Seven Fires&quot; about pledging experiences from his fraternity days in Alpha Delta (associated with the national Alpha Delta Phi during Miller&#x27;s undergraduate years; the fraternity subsequently disassociated itself from the national organization and is now called Alpha Delta) at Dartmouth College, in Hanover, New Hampshire. The antics of his fellow fraternities, coupled with experiences like that of a road trip to the University of Wisconsin–Madison and its Delta Chi fraternity, became the inspiration for the Delta Tau Chis of &quot;Animal House&quot;, and many characters in the film (and their nicknames) were based on Miller&#x27;s fraternity brothers. Filmmaker Ivan Reitman had just finished producing David Cronenberg&#x27;s first film, &quot;Shivers&quot;, and called the magazine&#x27;s publisher Matty Simmons about making movies under the &quot;Lampoon&quot; banner. Reitman had put together &quot;The National Lampoon Show&quot; in New York City featuring several future &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; cast members, including John Belushi. When most of the &quot;Lampoon&quot; group moved on to &quot;SNL&quot; except for Harold Ramis, Reitman approached him with an idea to make a film together using some skits from the &quot;Lampoon Show&quot;.
===Screenplay===
Kenney met &quot;Lampoon&quot; writer Ramis at the suggestion of Simmons. Ramis drew from his own fraternity experiences as a member of Zeta Beta Tau fraternity at Washington University in St. Louis and was working on a film treatment about college called &quot;First Year&quot;, but the magazine&#x27;s editors were not happy with it. The famous scene of Bruce McGill as D-Day riding a motorcycle up the stairs of the fraternity house was inspired by Belushi&#x27;s antics while a student at the University of Wisconsin–Whitewater. Kenney and Ramis started working on a new film treatment together, positing Charles Manson in a high school, calling it &quot;Laser Orgy Girls&quot;. Simmons was cool to this idea so they changed the setting to a &quot;northeastern college ... Ivy League kind of school&quot;. Kenney was a fan of Miller&#x27;s fraternity stories and suggested using them as a basis for a movie. Kenney, Miller, and Ramis began brainstorming ideas. They saw the film&#x27;s 1962 setting as &quot;the last innocent year ... of America&quot;, and the homecoming parade that ends the film as occurring on November 21, 1963, the day before President Kennedy&#x27;s assassination; 1962 was also notable for being the year 1973 film &quot;American Graffiti&quot; was set in. They agreed that Belushi should star in it and Ramis wrote the part of Bluto specifically for the comedian, having been friends with him while at Chicago&#x27;s The Second City.

Ramis, Miller, and Kenney were all new to screenwriting, so their film treatment ran to 110 pages, where most treatments average 15 pages. Reitman and Simmons pitched it to every Hollywood studio. Simmons met with Ned Tanen, an executive at Universal Pictures. He was encouraged by younger executives Sean Daniel and Thom Mount who were more receptive to the Lampoon type of humor; Mount had discovered the &quot;Seven Fires&quot; film treatment as Tanen&#x27;s assistant while investigating projects left by a fired studio executive. Tanen hated the idea. Ramis remembers, &quot;We went further than I think Universal expected or wanted. I think they were shocked and appalled. Chris&#x27; fraternity had virtually been a vomiting cult. And we had a lot of scenes that were almost orgies of vomit ... We didn&#x27;t back off anything&quot;. The writers eventually created nine drafts of the screenplay, and the studio gradually became more receptive to the project, especially Mount, who championed it. The studio green-lighted the film and set the budget at a modest $3 million. Simmons remembers, &quot;They just figured, &#x27;Screw it, it&#x27;s a silly little movie, and we&#x27;ll make a couple of bucks if we&#x27;re lucky—let them do whatever they want.&#x27;

===Casting===
Initially, Reitman had wanted to direct but had made only one film, &quot;Cannibal Girls&quot;, for $5,000. The film&#x27;s producers approached Richard Lester and Bob Rafelson before hiring John Landis, who got the director job based on his work on &quot;Kentucky Fried Movie&quot;. That film&#x27;s script and continuity supervisor was the girlfriend of Sean Daniel, an assistant to Mount. Daniel saw Landis&#x27;s movie and recommended him. Landis then met with Mount, Reitman, and Simmons and got the job. Landis remembered, &quot;When I was given the script, it was the funniest thing I had ever read up to that time. But it was really offensive. There was a great deal of projectile vomiting and rape and all these things&quot;. Landis claims his big contribution to the film was that there &quot;had to be good guys and bad guys. There can&#x27;t just be bad guys, so there became a good fraternity and bad fraternity&quot;. There was also early friction between Landis and the writers because the director was a high-school dropout from Hollywood and they were all college graduates from the East Coast. Ramis recalled, &quot;He sort of referred immediately to &quot;Animal House&quot; as &#x27;my movie.&#x27; We&#x27;d been living with it for two years and we hated that&quot;. According to Landis, he drew inspiration from classic Hollywood comedies featuring the likes of Buster Keaton, Harold Lloyd, and the Marx Brothers.

The initial cast was to feature Chevy Chase as Otter, Bill Murray as Boon, Brian Doyle-Murray as Hoover, Dan Aykroyd as D-Day, and John Belushi as Bluto, but only Belushi was interested. Chase turned the film down in favor of &quot;Foul Play&quot;; Landis, who wanted to cast unknown dramatic actors such as Bacon and Allen (the first film for both) instead of famous comedians, takes credit for subtly discouraging Chase by describing the cast as an &quot;ensemble&quot;. Landis has also stated that he was not interested in directing a &quot;&quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; movie&quot; and that unknowns would be the better choice. The character of D-Day was based on Aykroyd, a motorcycle aficionado. Aykroyd was offered the part, but he was already committed to &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;; according to Landis, the show&#x27;s producer Lorne Michaels threatened to fire Aykroyd from the show&#x27;s cast if he took the role of D-Day, which ultimately went to Bruce McGill and provided him with his breakthrough role. In August 2018, Aykroyd explained that although Michaels permitted him to do &quot;Animal House&quot;, he ultimately chose to stay behind on &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; so as not to leave Michaels understaffed. Belushi, who had worked on &quot;The National Lampoon Radio Hour&quot; before &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;, was also busy with SNL, but spent Monday through Wednesday making the film and then flew back to New York to do the show on Thursday through Saturday. Ramis originally wrote the role of Boon for himself, but Landis felt that he looked too old for the part and Peter Riegert was cast instead. Landis offered Ramis a smaller part, but he declined. Landis met with Jack Webb to play Dean Wormer and Kim Novak to play his wife; at the time, Webb reportedly turned down the role because of concerns over his clean-cut &quot;Dragnet&quot; image, but later said he did not find the script funny. Ultimately, John Vernon was cast as Wormer after Landis saw him in &quot;The Outlaw Josey Wales&quot;.

Belushi initially received only $35,000 for &quot;Animal House&quot;, but was paid a bonus after the film became a hit. Landis also met with Meat Loaf in case Belushi turned down the role of Bluto. Landis worked with Belushi on his character, who &quot;hardly had any dialogue&quot;; they decided that Bluto was a cross between Harpo Marx and the Cookie Monster. Belushi said he developed his ability to communicate without talking because his Albanian grandmother spoke little English.

Belushi was considered a supporting actor and Universal wanted another star. Landis had been a crew member on &quot;Kelly&#x27;s Heroes&quot; and had become friends with actor Donald Sutherland, sometimes babysitting his son Kiefer. He had also just worked with him on &quot;Kentucky Fried Movie&quot;. Landis asked Sutherland, one of the most popular film stars of the early 1970s, to be in the movie. For two days of work, Sutherland declined the initial offer of $20,000 plus &quot;points&quot; (a percentage of the gross or net income). Universal then offered him his day rate of $25,000 or 2% of the film&#x27;s gross. Sutherland took the guaranteed fee, assuming that the film would not be very successful; although this made him the highest-paid member of the cast (Belushi and Neidermeyer&#x27;s horse, Junior, each received $40,000), the decision cost Sutherland what he estimates at around $14 million. The star&#x27;s participation, however, was crucial; Landis later said &quot;It was Donald Sutherland who essentially got the film made.&quot;

&quot;Pinto&quot; was screenwriter Chris Miller&#x27;s nickname at his Dartmouth fraternity. DeWayne Jessie adopted the &quot;Otis Day&quot; name in his private life and continued touring with the band.

===Locations===
The filmmakers&#x27; next problem was finding a college that would let them shoot the film on their campus. Because it was set in the past, they needed a location with a classic look, so submitted the script to several colleges and universities but &quot;nobody wanted this movie&quot; due to the script. According to Landis, &quot;I couldn&#x27;t find &#x27;the look&#x27;. Every place that had &#x27;the look&#x27; said, &#x27;no thank you.&#x27;&quot; The University of Missouri (Columbia, Missouri) gave consent to shoot the movie at the college, but President Herbert W. Schooling withdrew permission to film there after reading the script.

The president of the University of Oregon in Eugene, William Beaty Boyd, had been a senior administrator at the University of California in Berkeley in 1966 when his campus was considered for a location of the film &quot;The Graduate&quot;. After he consulted with other senior administrative colleagues who advised him to turn it down due to the lack of artistic merit, the college campus scenes set at Berkeley were shot at USC in Los Angeles. The film went on to become a classic, and Boyd was determined not to make the same mistake twice when the producers inquired about filming in Oregon. After consulting with student government leaders and officers of the Pan Hellenic Council, the Director of University Relations advised the president that the script, although raunchy and often tasteless, was a very funny spoof of college life. Boyd even allowed the filmmakers to use his office as Dean Wormer&#x27;s. Because of the film&#x27;s content, however, he insisted that &quot;Oregon&quot; not be mentioned in the film. The filmmakers paid $20,000 to use the campus.

The actual house depicted as the Delta House was originally a residence near the campus in Eugene, the Dr. A.W. Patterson House. Around 1959, it was acquired by the Psi Deuteron chapter of Phi Sigma Kappa fraternity and was their chapter house until 1967, when the chapter was closed due to low membership. The house was sold, remained vacant, and slid into disrepair, with the spacious porch removed and the lawn graveled over. At the time of the shooting, the Phi Kappa Psi and Sigma Nu fraternity houses sat next to the old Phi Sigma Kappa house, on the 700 block of East 11th Avenue. The interior of the Phi Kappa Psi house and the Sigma Nu house were used for most of the interior scenes, but the scenes in Otter and Hoover&#x27;s bedrooms were filmed on a soundstage. The Patterson house remained vacant after filming ended in 1977 and was demolished in 1986, and the site () is now occupied by Bushnell University&#x27;s School of Education and Counseling. A large boulder placed to the west of the parking entrance displays a bronze plaque commemorating the Delta House location. The concluding parade scene was filmed on Main Street in downtown Cottage Grove, about south of Eugene via Interstate 5.

===Principal photography===
Filming began on October 24, 1977, and concluded in the middle of December 1977. and Landis brought the actors who played the Deltas up five days early to bond. Staying at the Rodeway Inn motel in adjacent Springfield, they moved an old piano from the lobby into McGill&#x27;s room, which became known as &quot;party central.&quot; James Widdoes (&quot;Hoover&quot;) remembers, &quot;It was like freshman orientation. There was a lot of getting to know each other and calling each other by our character names.&quot; This tactic encouraged the actors playing the Deltas to separate themselves from the actors playing the Omegas, helping generate authentic animosity between them on camera. Belushi and his wife Judy rented a house in south Eugene to keep him away from alcohol and drugs; she remained in Oregon while he commuted to New York City for &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;.

University of Oregon students got haircuts to appear as extras. Not knowing the story, they were bemused to see a horse being led into Johnson Hall. Although the cast members were admonished against mixing with the college students, one night, some girls invited several of the cast to a fraternity party; assuming the invitation had been made with the knowledge of the fraternity, the actors arrived and were initially greeted coldly which soon turned to open hostility. It was obvious the group was not welcome, and as they were leaving, Widdoes threw a cup of beer at a group of drunk Oregon Ducks football players and a melee &quot;like a scene from the movie&quot; broke out. Tim Matheson, Bruce McGill, Peter Riegert, and Widdoes narrowly escaped, with McGill suffering a black eye and Widdoes getting several teeth broken or knocked out.

Other than Belushi&#x27;s opening yell, the food fight was filmed in one shot, with the actors encouraged to fight for real. Flounder&#x27;s dexterous catching of flying groceries in the supermarket was another single shot; Furst deftly caught most of the grocery items Matheson and Landis rapidly threw at him from off camera, to the director&#x27;s amazement. By filming the long courtroom scene in one day, Landis won a bet with Reitman.

The film&#x27;s budget was so small that during the 32 days of shooting in Eugene, mostly in November, Landis had no trailer or office and could not watch dailies for three weeks. His wife Deborah Nadoolman purchased most of the costumes at local thrift stores, and she and Judy Belushi made the party togas. Landis and Bruce McGill staged a scene for reporters visiting the set where the director pretended to be angry at the actor for being difficult on the set. Landis grabbed a breakaway pitcher and smashed it over McGill&#x27;s head. He fell to the ground and pretended to be unconscious. The reporters were completely fooled, and when Landis asked McGill to get up, he refused to move.
Black extras had to be bused in from Portland for the segment at the Dexter Lake Club () due to their scarcity around Eugene. More seriously, the segment alarmed Tanen and other studio executives, who perceived it as racist and warned that &quot;&#x27;black people in America are going to rip the seats out of theaters if you leave that scene in the movie.&#x27;&quot; Richard Pryor&#x27;s approval helped retain the segment in the film. The studio became more enthusiastic about the film when Reitman showed executives and sales managers of various regions in the country a 10-minute production reel that was put together in two days. The reaction was positive and the studio sent 20 copies out to exhibitors. The first preview screening for &quot;Animal House&quot; was held in Denver four months before it opened nationwide. The crowd loved it and the filmmakers realized they had a potential hit on their hands.

The original cut of the movie was a lengthy 175 minutes and more than an hour was dropped; the deleted scenes included:
* a John Landis cameo as a cafeteria dishwasher who tries to stop Bluto from eating all the food. Landis is dragged across a table and thrown to the floor by Bluto who then says &quot;You don&#x27;t fuck with the eagles unless you know how to fly.&quot;
* a scene where Boon and Hoover tell Pinto the tales of legendary Delta House frat brothers from years before who had names like Tarantula, Bulldozer, Giraffe, and his girlfriend, Gross Kay.
* two different deleted scenes with Otter and a couple of his girlfriends (one played by Sunny Johnson—listed in the credits as &quot;Otter&#x27;s Co-Ed&quot; although her scene was deleted—and the other played by location scout Katherine Wilson, whose deleted scene can be seen in the theatrical trailer).
* an extended version of the scene where Bluto pours mustard on himself and starts singing &quot;I am the Mustard Man.&quot;

==Soundtrack and score==

The soundtrack is a mix of rock and roll and rhythm and blues with the original score created by film composer Elmer Bernstein, who had been a Landis family friend since John Landis was a child. Bernstein was easily persuaded to score the film, but he was not sure what to make of it. Similar to his preferring dramatic actors for the comedy, Landis asked Bernstein to score it as though it were serious. He adapted the &quot;Faber College Theme&quot; from the &quot;Academic Festival Overture&quot; by Brahms, and he said that the film opened yet another door in his diverse career: scoring comedies.

The soundtrack was released as an LP in 1978 and on compact disc in 1998. In the late 2000s, the very first song on the soundtrack, the &quot;Faber College Theme&quot;, came to prominence due to its purported resemblance to the Bosnian national anthem.

==Reception==
===Critical reception===
At the time of its release, &quot;Animal House&quot; received mixed reviews but several prominent critics immediately acknowledged its appeal, and it has since been recognized as one of the best films of 1978. The film holds a 91% positive rating on the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes from 53 critics. Its consensus states, &quot;The talents of director John Landis and &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;″s irrepressible John Belushi conspired to create a rambunctious, subversive college comedy that continues to resonate.&quot; On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 79 out of 100 based on 13 reviews, indicating &quot;generally favorable reviews&quot;.

Roger Ebert gave the film four stars out of four and wrote, &quot;It&#x27;s anarchic, messy, and filled with energy. It assaults us. Part of the movie&#x27;s impact comes from its sheer level of manic energy. ... But the movie&#x27;s better made (and better acted) than we might at first realize. It takes skill to create this sort of comic pitch, and the movie&#x27;s filled with characters that are sketched a little more absorbingly than they had to be, and acted with perception&quot;. Ebert later placed the film on his 10 best list of 1978, the only &quot;National Lampoon&quot; film to have received this honor. In his review for &quot;Time&quot;, Frank Rich wrote, &quot;At its best it perfectly expresses the fears and loathings of kids who came of age in the late &#x27;60s; at its worst &quot;Animal House&quot; revels in abject silliness. The hilarious highs easily compensate for the puerile lows&quot;. Gary Arnold wrote in his review for &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, &quot;Belushi also controls a wicked array of conspiratorial expressions with the audience... He can seem irresistibly funny in repose or invest minor slapstick opportunities with a streak of genius&quot;. David Ansen wrote in &quot;Newsweek&quot;, &quot;But if &quot;Animal House&quot; lacks the inspired tastelessness of the Lampoon&#x27;s &quot;High School Yearbook Parody&quot;, this is still low humor of a high order&quot;. Robert Martin wrote in &quot;The Globe and Mail&quot;, &quot;It is so gross and tasteless you feel you should be disgusted but it&#x27;s hard to be offended by something that is so sidesplittingly funny&quot;. &quot;Time&quot; magazine proclaimed &quot;Animal House&quot; one of the year&#x27;s best.

When the film was released, Landis, Widdoes, and Allen went on a national promotional tour. Universal Pictures spent about $4.5 million ($ in today&#x27;s money) promoting the film at selected college campuses and helped students organize their own toga parties. One such party at the University of Maryland attracted some 2,000 people, while students at the University of Wisconsin–Madison tried for a crowd of 10,000 people and a place in the &quot;Guinness Book of World Records&quot;. Thanks to the film, toga parties became one of the favorite college campus happenings during 1978 and 1979.

In 2000, the American Film Institute placed the film on its 100 Years...100 Laughs list, where it was ranked No. 36. In 2005, AFI ranked John &quot;Bluto&quot; Blutarsky&#x27;s quote &quot;Toga! Toga!&quot; at No. 82 on its list of 100 Years...100 Movie Quotes. &quot;The New York Times&quot; placed the film on its &quot;Best 1000 Movies Ever&quot; list. In 2001, the Library of Congress deemed the film to be &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant&quot; and selected it as one of 25 films preserved in the National Film Registry that year.

===Box office===
In its opening weekend, &quot;Animal House&quot; grossed $276,538 in twelve theaters in New York before expanding to 500 theaters. It grossed $120.1 million ($ in today&#x27;s money) in the United States and Canada in its initial release and went on to achieve a lifetime gross of $141.6 million, generating theatrical rentals of $70.8 million. It was the highest grossing comedy film until the release of &quot;Ghostbusters&quot; (which was also written by Ramis and produced by Reitman) and the seventh highest-grossing film of the 1970s. Adjusted for inflation, it is the 68th highest-grossing film in North America. Internationally, it did not do as well, earning rentals of only $9 million, for a worldwide total of $80 million.

==Spin-offs==

The film inspired a short-lived half-hour ABC television sitcom, &quot;Delta House&quot;, in which Vernon reprised his role as the long-suffering, malevolent Dean Wormer. The series also included Furst as Flounder, McGill as D-Day, and Widdoes as Hoover. The pilot episode was written by the film&#x27;s screenwriters, Kenney, Miller, and Ramis. Michelle Pfeiffer made her acting debut in the series (playing a new character, &quot;Bombshell&quot;), and Peter Fox was cast as Otter. Belushi&#x27;s character from the film, John &quot;Bluto&quot; Blutarsky, is in the Army, but his brother, Blotto, played by Josh Mostel, transfers to Faber to carry on Bluto&#x27;s tradition.

&quot;Animal House&quot; inspired &quot;Co-Ed Fever&quot;, another sitcom but without the involvement of the film&#x27;s producers or cast. Set in a dorm of the formerly all-female Baxter College, the pilot of &quot;Co-Ed Fever&quot; was aired by CBS on February 4, 1979, but the network canceled the series before airing any more episodes. NBC also had its &quot;Animal House&quot;-inspired sitcom, &quot;Brothers and Sisters&quot;, in which three members of Crandall College&#x27;s Pi Nu fraternity interact with members of the Gamma Iota sorority. Like ABC&#x27;s &quot;Delta House&quot;, &quot;Brothers and Sisters&quot; lasted only three months.

The film&#x27;s writers planned a film sequel set in 1967 (the so-called &quot;Summer of Love&quot;), in which the Deltas have a reunion for Pinto&#x27;s marriage in Haight-Ashbury, San Francisco. The only Delta to have become a hippie is Flounder, who is now called Pisces. Later, Chris Miller and John Weidman, another Lampoon writer, created a treatment for this screenplay, but Universal rejected it because the sequel to &quot;American Graffiti&quot;, which contained some hippie-1967 sequences, had not done well. When John Belushi died, the idea was indefinitely shelved.

A second attempt at a sequel was made in 1982 with producer Matty Simmons co-authoring a script that saw some of the Deltas returning to Faber College five years after the events of the film. The project got no further than a first draft script.

== Home media ==
&quot;Animal House&quot; was released on videodisc in 1979. It was released on VHS in 1980, 1983, 1988, and 1990. In 1992, it was released in a 2-pack VHS set that included &quot;The Blues Brothers&quot;. It was first released on DVD in February 1998 in a &quot;bare bones&quot; Full Screen presentation. A 20th Anniversary Widescreen Collector&#x27;s Edition DVD and a coinciding THX special edition VHS and a widescreen Signature Collection Laserdisc was released later that year, with a 45-minute documentary titled &quot;The Yearbook — An &quot;Animal House&quot; Reunion&quot; by producer J.M. Kenny, with production notes, theatrical trailer, and new interviews with director Landis, writers Harold Ramis and Chris Miller, composer Elmer Bernstein, and stars Tim Matheson, Karen Allen, Stephen Furst, John Vernon, Verna Bloom, Bruce McGill, James Widdoes, Peter Riegert, Mark Metcalf and Kevin Bacon. In 2000, the collector&#x27;s edition DVD was packaged along with &quot;The Blues Brothers&quot; and &quot;1941&quot; in a John Belushi 3-pack box set. The &quot;Double Secret Probation Edition&quot; DVD released in 2003 features cast members reprising their respective roles in a &quot;Where Are They Now?&quot; mockumentary, which posited the original film as a documentary. One major change shown in this mockumentary from the epilogue of the original film is that Bluto went on from his career in the U.S. Senate to become the President of the United States, with a voiceover on a shot of the north portico of the White House, since by then Belushi had died. This DVD also includes &quot;Did You Know That? Universal Animated Anecdotes&quot;, a subtitle trivia track, the making of a documentary from the Collector&#x27;s Edition, MxPx &quot;Shout&quot; music video, a theatrical trailer, production notes, and cast and filmmakers biographies. The DVD was also available in both Widescreen and Full-Screen formats. In August 2006, the film was released on an HD DVD/DVD combo disc, which featured the film in a 1080p high-definition format on one side, and a standard-definition format on the opposite side. Along with the film &quot;Unleashed&quot;, &quot;Animal House&quot; was one of Universal&#x27;s first two HD/DVD combo releases, but was later discontinued in 2008 after Universal decided to switch to the Blu-ray optical disc format following the conclusion of the high-definition optical disc format war.

It became available on Blu-ray optical disc on July 26, 2011.

The film was released on 4K on May 18, 2021.

==Precursors and legacy==
&quot;Animal House&quot; was a great box office success despite its limited production costs and started an industry trend, inspiring other comedies such as &quot;Porky&#x27;s&quot;, the &quot;Police Academy&quot; films, the &quot;American Pie&quot; films, &quot;Up the Academy&quot; (made by rival humor magazine &quot;MAD&quot;), and &quot;Old School&quot; among others. Belushi became the most successful male comedy star in the world until his 1982 death; Bacon also became a star, and he, Matheson, and Allen are among those who have had lengthy acting careers. Reitman, Landis, and Ramis became successful filmmakers; Landis&#x27; use of dramatic actors and soundtrack to make the comedy believable became the traditional approach for film comedies.

The film has caused many parents to worry about their children joining fraternities and sororities. One writer suggested, half-seriously, that the film&#x27;s impact was such that future college students seeking to emulate Delta House&#x27;s antics in real life led to &quot;a drop of American college students&#x27; GPA&#x27;s an average of .18 grade points, per semester&quot;.

On the left-wing and counterculture side, the film included references to topical political matters like President Harry S. Truman&#x27;s decision to drop atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki, Richard Nixon, the Vietnam War, and the civil rights movement. Precursors of this counterculture subversive humor in the film were two non-&quot;college movies&quot;, &quot;M*A*S*H&quot;, a 1970 satirical dark comedy, and &quot;The Kentucky Fried Movie&quot;, a 1977 formless comedy consisting of a series of sketches (which was also directed by Landis).

At the start of &quot;Twilight Zone: The Movie&quot; (1983), also directed by John Landis, a scene set in Vietnam includes a soldier saying &quot;I told you guys, we shouldn&#x27;t have shot Lieutenant Neidermeyer.&quot;

In the second season of the Canadian television series &quot;Relic Hunter&quot; (2000–2001), Sydney&#x27;s boss at Trinity College is named Dean Wormer.

In 2001, the United States Library of Congress deemed the film &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant&quot; and selected it for preservation in the National Film Registry. &quot;Animal House&quot; is first on Bravo&#x27;s 100 Funniest Movies. In 2000, the American Film Institute ranked the film No. 36 on &quot;100 Years... 100 Laughs&quot;, a list of the 100 best American comedies. In 2006, Miller wrote a more comprehensive memoir of his experiences in Dartmouth&#x27;s AD house in a book entitled, &quot;The Real Animal House: The Awesomely Depraved Saga of the Fraternity That Inspired the Movie&quot;, in which Miller recounts hijinks that were considered too risqué for the movie. In 2008, &quot;Empire&quot; magazine selected &quot;Animal House&quot; as one of &quot;The 500 Greatest Movies of All Time&quot;. The film was also selected by &quot;The New York Times&quot; as one of &quot;The 1000 Best Movies Ever Made&quot;.

In 2012, Universal Pictures Stage Productions announced it was developing a stage musical version of the movie. Barenaked Ladies were originally announced to write the score, but they were replaced by composer David Yazbek. Casey Nicholaw was billed to direct; author Michael Mitnick was reported to be involved.

The University of Oregon celebrates its participation in the film. It offers visitors a guide to filming locations, and the Knight Library has a collection of material on the film&#x27;s production. Between the third and fourth quarter of every football game at Autzen Stadium, &quot;Shout&quot; from the toga party scene is played, to which the entire stadium sings along.

<text>A Night at the Opera is a 1935 American comedy film starring the Marx Brothers (Groucho, Harpo and Chico), and featuring Kitty Carlisle, Allan Jones, Margaret Dumont, Sig Ruman, and Walter Woolf King. It was the first of five films the Marx Brothers made under contract for Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer after their departure from Paramount Pictures, and the first after Zeppo left the act. The film was written by George S. Kaufman and Morrie Ryskind from a story by James Kevin McGuinness, with additional uncredited dialogue by Al Boasberg. The film was directed by Sam Wood.

One of MGM&#x27;s biggest hits at the 1935 box office, &quot;A Night at the Opera&quot; was selected in 1993 for preservation in the National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant&quot;. It is also included in the 2007 update of AFI&#x27;s 100 Years... 100 Movies, at number 85; and previously in AFI&#x27;s 100 Years...100 Laughs 2000 showing, at number 12.
==Plot==
At a restaurant in Milan, Italy, wealthy widow Mrs. Claypool has apparently been stood up for dinner by her business manager, Otis B. Driftwood. After she discovers him dining with another woman and seated directly behind her, Driftwood joins Mrs. Claypool and soon introduces her to Herman Gottlieb, director of the New York Opera Company, also dining at the restaurant. Driftwood has arranged for Mrs. Claypool to invest $200,000 in the opera company, allowing Gottlieb enough money to engage Italian tenor Rodolfo Lassparri, the &quot;greatest tenor since Caruso&quot;.

Backstage at the opera house, chorister Ricardo Baroni hires his best friend Fiorello to be his manager. Ricardo is in love with the soprano, Rosa Castaldi, who is also being courted by Lassparri. Driftwood arrives backstage and finds Lassparri attacking Tomasso, his dresser; Tomasso knocks Lassparri unconscious by hitting him over the head with a mallet. Fiorello appears and introduces himself to Driftwood as the manager of the &quot;greatest tenor in the world&quot;. Driftwood believes Fiorello is referring to Lassparri (who is still lying unconscious at their feet) and unwittingly signs Ricardo to a contract.

Soon, Driftwood, Mrs. Claypool, Rosa, Lassparri and Gottlieb all set sail from Italy to New York aboard an ocean liner. After bidding farewell to Rosa at the pier, Ricardo, Fiorello, and Tomasso stow away inside Driftwood&#x27;s steamer trunk. After being discovered, Driftwood attempts to get the three of them to leave before Mrs. Claypool arrives in his stateroom for a rendezvous. Fiorello refuses to leave until the trio have eaten, and eventually Driftwood&#x27;s very small stateroom is crowded with an assortment of people. (See &quot;Stateroom scene&quot; below.)

Later, Lassparri spots the three stowaways among the Italian immigrants on the ship, and they are caught and thrown into the brig. They escape with Driftwood&#x27;s help and are able to sneak into the country by posing as three famous bearded aviators, who are traveling aboard the ship. During a hero&#x27;s welcome in New York, the stowaways are exposed as frauds and they flee, hiding out in Driftwood&#x27;s hotel room while pursued by police sergeant Henderson.

Meanwhile, Rosa and Ricardo are reunited when he climbs through the window of her hotel room. Lassparri appears, and after a physical altercation with Ricardo, both Rosa and Driftwood are fired from the opera company by Gottlieb. Driftwood, Fiorello, and Tomasso decide to seek revenge by sabotaging the opera company&#x27;s opening night performance of &quot;Il trovatore&quot; with various antics, climaxing with the abduction of Lassparri from the stage, forcing Gottlieb to substitute Ricardo in his place. Ricardo accepts on the condition Rosa substitutes for the female lead as well. Mrs. Claypool and the audience clearly prefer Ricardo over Lassparri, and the latter is booed and hit with an apple after he is untied and attempts to return to the stage. The film ends with Driftwood and Fiorello negotiating another contract as Rosa and Ricardo sing an encore.

==Selected sequences==
===Stateroom===
This scene was written primarily by legendary gag man Al Boasberg. Famously eccentric, Boasberg typed up the finished scene, then shredded the pages into thin pieces and tacked them to his ceiling. It took Irving Thalberg and the brothers hours to cut and paste the scene back together.

Driftwood plans a rendezvous with Mrs. Claypool in his stateroom. Then he finds out how small it is (a third class cabin, about the size of a janitor&#x27;s closet), and that he, his steamer trunk, and the bed barely fit in it. Driftwood discovers that Fiorello, Tomasso, and Ricardo have stowed away in his steamer trunk and discarded his clothes. Fiorello insists on eating (&quot;We getta food or we don&#x27;t go&quot;). Driftwood calls a steward (&quot;I say, Stew&quot;) and orders dinner.

This continues until Fiorello and Tomasso each have ordered about a dozen hard-boiled eggs and Driftwood has ordered about everything else – including coffee to sober up some stewed prunes. This is just a set-up for the famous &quot;Stateroom Scene&quot;, in which a total of 15 people crowd into Driftwood&#x27;s tiny cabin.

The three stowaways have to hide out in the room while a parade of people walk in, asking to either use the cabin, or to perform their regular duties. Crammed into this little space at the end of the scene are Driftwood, Fiorello, Tomasso, Ricardo, two cleaning ladies who make up the bed, a manicurist (Manicurist: &quot;Do you want your nails long or short?&quot; Driftwood: &quot;You better make them short, it&#x27;s getting kind of crowded in here!&quot;), a ship&#x27;s engineer and his fat assistant, a young woman passenger using the phone to call her Aunt Minnie, a maid (Maid: &quot;I come to mop up.&quot; Driftwood: &quot;You&#x27;ll have to start on the ceiling.&quot;) and four waiters with trays of hard-boiled eggs. 
(Driftwood: &quot;Tell Aunt Minnie to send up a bigger room.&quot;) All of the foregoing tumble out into the hallway when Mrs. Claypool opens the door.

===Contract===
The contract scene between Driftwood and Fiorello (&quot;the party of the first part ...&quot;):

===Opera===
True to its title, the film includes adaptations of some real opera scenes from &quot;I Pagliacci&quot; and &quot;Il Trovatore&quot;, featuring the &quot;Miserere&quot; duet sung by Kitty Carlisle and Allan Jones. The opera setting also allowed MGM to add big production song numbers (which were one of this studio&#x27;s specialties), such as the song &quot;Alone&quot;, with the departure of the steamship, and the song &quot;Cosi Cosa&quot; with the Italian buffet and dancing.

Carlisle and Jones were both trained in operatic singing and provided their own singing voices in the film. Walter Woolf King was a trained baritone, but he portrayed a tenor in the film. His singing was dubbed by Metropolitan Opera tenor Tandy MacKenzie.

===Hidden material===
In the scene where the three stowaways are impersonating &quot;the three greatest aviators in the world&quot;, Driftwood seems to talk gibberish with the dignitaries. Actually it is English; if played backwards, it can be heard what they are saying (&quot;This man is accusing you of being impostors&quot;, etc.). It was recorded normally, then reversed and dubbed over the scene in post-production.

==Production==
In an interview with Richard J. Anobile in &quot;The Marx Brothers Scrapbook&quot;, Groucho said he was so appalled by an early draft of the script—which was apparently written by Bert Kalmar and Harry Ruby—that he shouted, &quot;Why fuck around with second-rate talent, get Kaufman and Ryskind [to write the screenplay]!&quot; 

At the suggestion of producer Irving Thalberg, the film marked a change of direction in the brothers&#x27; career. In their Paramount films, the brothers&#x27; characters were much more anarchic: they attacked almost anybody who was so unfortunate as to cross their paths whether they deserved it or not, albeit comically. Thalberg, however, felt that this made the brothers unsympathetic, particularly to female filmgoers. So in the MGM films, the brothers were recast as more helpful characters, saving most of their comic attacks for the villains.

Though some Marx Brothers fans disliked these changes, Thalberg was vindicated when the film became a solid hit. It helped that the film contained some of what fans consider to be among the brothers&#x27; funniest and most memorable routines. These routines were carefully honed in a series of live stage performances, as the brothers took to the road and performed the new material around the country before filming began.

However, according to Oscar Levant, the first preview of the finished film in Long Beach was a &quot;disaster&quot;, with &quot;hardly a laugh&quot; as was the second. Thalberg and George S. Kaufman spent days in the editing room, adjusting the timing to match the rhythm of a stage performance. About nine minutes was cut from the running time, and the result was a hit.

===Subsequent re-editing===
The film originally was to have begun with each of the Marx Brothers taking turns roaring instead of Leo the Lion (MGM&#x27;s iconic mascot); Harpo was to have honked his horn. This unique opening was created, but not used in the released film because MGM studio head Louis B. Mayer felt the parody would cheapen the respected trademark. It turned up years later, however, in a re-release trailer for the film.

According to MGM&#x27;s dialogue cutting continuity and Leonard Maltin&#x27;s audio commentary on the DVD release, the film originally began (after the opening credits) with the image of a &quot;boat on canal&quot;. A superimposed title read, &quot;ITALY – WHERE THEY SING ALL DAY AND GO TO THE OPERA AT NIGHT&quot;, and was followed by a musical number featuring bits and pieces from Leoncavallo&#x27;s &quot;Pagliacci&quot; performed by &quot;everyday&quot; Italians: a street sweeper sings part of the prologue (&quot;Un nido di memorie...&quot;) as he greets a man who then hands out opera tickets to a group of children emerging from a store; the children respond with &quot;la-la-la-la-la, verso un paese strano&quot; (from &quot;Stridono lassù&quot;); a &quot;captain&quot; comes down a set of steps, salutes a sentry, then bursts into &quot;Vesti la giubba&quot;; then, a lap dissolve into a hotel lobby, where a &quot;baggage man&quot; is rolling a trunk and crooning about &quot;nettare divino&quot; (&quot;divine nectar&quot;); a waiter joins the baggage man in song, enters the dining room, and sings as he serves a man who for a few notes also sings; the waiter then crosses the dining room to speak to Mrs. Claypool (Margaret Dumont), marking the beginning of the film in existing copies.

In his commentary, Maltin repeats an assertion originally made by Glenn Mitchell in &quot;The Marx Brothers Encyclopedia&quot; that the scene was cut during World War II to remove references to Italy. However, according to MPAA records, the film was re-edited by MGM in 1938, prior to the war, because of complaints from the Italian government that it &quot;made fun of Italian people&quot;. Unfortunately, the edits were made to MGM&#x27;s master negative, and no prints of the original uncut version are known to survive.
This notable cut, with several other small ones made at about the same time, is why the stated running time of the film (95 minutes) was three minutes longer than that of existing prints.

A persistent rumor concerning &quot;A Night at the Opera&quot; involves the presence of the Marx Brothers&#x27; father Sam Marx (also known as &quot;Frenchy&quot;) on the ship and on the dock, waving goodbye. Both Groucho and Harpo stated this as fact in their memoirs, and film critic Leonard Maltin repeats it in the DVD commentary. But this could not have occurred, because Sam Marx had died in 1933, during pre-production of &quot;Duck Soup&quot;, two years before &quot;A Night at the Opera&quot; was released. The rumor arose because Frenchy had had such a cameo appearance in the Marx Brothers&#x27; earlier film &quot;Monkey Business&quot;. There is, however, a reference to the Marx Brothers&#x27; mother, Minnie Marx, during the stateroom scene, in which a woman asks, &quot;Is my Aunt Minnie in here?&quot;

Part of the concept of casting the Marx Brothers as stowaways on a ship was recycled from &quot;Monkey Business&quot;. As Groucho&#x27;s and Margaret Dumont&#x27;s characters are boarding the ocean liner, Dumont asks Groucho, &quot;Are you sure you have everything, Otis?&quot;; Groucho replies, &quot;I&#x27;ve never had any complaints yet.&quot; In two different interviews with Dick Cavett on &quot;The Dick Cavett Show – Comic Legends&quot; DVD, Groucho claimed that that exchange of dialogue was banned in a majority of states when the film was released because it was too suggestive, although the number of states varied with different versions of the story.

===Hungarian rediscovery===
In 2008, a film student reported that the Hungarian National Film Archive possesses a longer print of the film. While the print does not contain the opening musical number, it does contain several excised lines referencing Italy that had been cut sometime after the film&#x27;s original release. With the opening number still missing, it may be that this scene was cut before the subsequent edits were made. However, the discovery of the Hungarian print has not yet been independently verified, and Turner Entertainment, who owns the rights to the film, has not indicated that any restoration is forthcoming.

==Style change==
&quot;A Night at the Opera&quot; began a new era for the Marx Brothers&#x27; style of comedy. Whereas their previous comedies at Paramount Pictures consisted of a constant barrage of jokes within a loosely plotted storyline, &quot;A Night at the Opera&quot; was calculated comedy. Producer Irving Thalberg insisted on a strong story structure, making the Brothers more sympathetic characters, interweaving their comedy with romantic plots and non-comic spectacular musical numbers. The targets of their mischief were largely confined to clear villains. Thalberg&#x27;s logic was that the Marxes could get &quot;twice the box office with half the laughs&quot;, believing their films would attract a wider audience. Groucho himself agreed with Thalberg&#x27;s rationale. In his autobiography, &quot;Groucho and Me&quot;, he wrote of the Marx Brothers&#x27; 13 films, &quot;Two were far above average. Some of the others were pretty good. Some were deplorable. The best two were made by Thalberg&quot;—a reference not only to &quot;A Night at the Opera&quot; but &quot;A Day at the Races&quot;.

Another idea to which Thalberg consented, was that before filming would commence on an upcoming film, the Marx Brothers would try out the new material on the vaudeville stage, working on comic timing and learning which jokes and gags earned a laugh and which did not. Jokes were planted accordingly, so the laughs could be timed correctly. What was to become the famous &quot;stateroom&quot; scene was nearly eliminated because it was not getting any laughs. One evening the Marx Brothers threw away the script and ad-libbed the whole scene. As a result, a weak scene was transformed into one of their all-time classics.

In &quot;A Night at the Opera&quot;, each of the brothers&#x27; characters was refined: Groucho was somewhat less nonsensical, and less trouble; Chico became less of a scammer and gained &quot;some&quot; intelligence; Harpo became less mischievous and more sympathetic. The film dives straight into a plot and accompanying comedy, with every scene having a clear beginning, middle, and end. The end consisted of a grand finale in the traditional MGM musical fashion, something lacking from the brothers&#x27; Paramount efforts.

&quot;A Night at the Opera&quot; established a basic formula that was utilized in every subsequent film the Marx Brothers made at MGM:
* a friendship existing between the romantic couple and Chico
* establishing sympathy for Harpo
* Chico and Groucho going through an extensive verbal routine
* Harpo joining as Chico&#x27;s partner (or brother)
* lush surroundings as a backdrop to the brothers&#x27; lunacy
* a key scene with all three Marxes
* a fall from grace
* a rebound on a grand scale in which everything is righted

==Release==
===Box office===
The film grossed a total (domestic and foreign) of $1,815,000: $1,164,000 from the US and Canada and $651,000 elsewhere. It made a profit of $90,000.

===Critical reception===
====Contemporary reviews====
&quot;A Night at the Opera&quot; was banned in Budapest.

Contemporary reviews were positive. Andre Sennwald of &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote, &quot;If &#x27;A Night at the Opera&#x27; is a trifle below their best, it is also considerably above the standard of laughter that has been our portion since they quit the screen. George S. Kaufman and Morrie Ryskind have given them a resounding slapstick to play with and they wield it with maniacal delight.&quot; &quot;The comedy material is always good and sometimes brilliant&quot;, reported &quot;Variety&quot;. &quot;This should be a laugh fest with all types of audiences&quot;, wrote &quot;Film Daily&quot;. &quot;This is a good Marx Brothers film, good as any they have done&quot;, wrote John Mosher in &quot;The New Yorker&quot;. &quot;It may not be new or surprising, but it&#x27;s quick and funny.&quot;

====Retrospective reviews====
The film holds a 97% &quot;fresh&quot; score at Rotten Tomatoes based on 69 reviews, with an average rating of 8.7/10. The site&#x27;s critical consensus reads, &quot;Watermelons may go out of season, but in &quot;A Night at the Opera&quot;, the Marx Brothers&#x27; daffy laughs are never anything less than uproariously fresh.&quot; Ken Hanke calls it &quot;hysterical, but not up to the boys&#x27; Paramount films.&quot; Mark Bourne concurs: &quot;[The Marx Brothers] still let the air out of stuffed shirts and barbecue a few sacred cows, but something got lost in all that MGMness when the screen&#x27;s ultimate anti-authoritarian team starting working the Andy Hardy side of the street.&quot;

Roger Ebert admitted that, while &quot;A Night at the Opera&quot; &quot;contains some of their best work&quot;, he &quot;fast-forward[ed] over the sappy interludes involving Kitty Carlisle and Allan Jones.&quot; Danel Griffin says: &quot;&quot;A Night at the Opera&quot; is funny, but this is NOT the Marx Brothers, and their earlier style is so sorely missed that the film falls flat. The main problem with &quot;A Night at the Opera&quot; is the obvious lack of the Marx Brothers&#x27; trademark anarchy. What distinguished them in their Paramount films from all other comedians was their thumb-biting indictment of society.&quot;

The film is recognized by American Film Institute in these lists:

==In popular culture==

Stateroom scene
* The Belgian singer Jacques Brel was inspired by the famous stateroom gag in the film when he wrote his song &quot;Le Gaz&quot; (1967) which depicts several men all crowding together in one room to meet a courtesan &quot;for the gas.&quot;
* The 1st season, 23rd episode of &quot;The Bob Newhart Show&quot; titled &quot;Bum Voyage&quot; features an homage to the stateroom scene where Bob and a dozen cast members are crammed into Bob and Emily&#x27;s stateroom with Howard Borden announcing that &quot;The first one that makes a Marx Brothers joke gets it!&quot;
* Cyndi Lauper featured a similar overcrowded stateroom gag in her music video for the song &quot;Girls Just Want to Have Fun&quot;.
* Sting also recreated the overcrowded stateroom gag in his music video for the 1991 song &quot;All This Time&quot;.
*The Warner Bros. animated show &quot;Animaniacs&quot; also paid homage to the stateroom gag in the short &quot;Hercule Yakko&quot;.
*In the Disney Channel series &quot;The Suite Life of Zack &amp; Cody&quot;, a scene almost identical to the stateroom scene occurs in the Martins&#x27; closet.
*An 8th-season episode of &quot;Seinfeld&quot; titled &quot;The Pothole&quot; features a homage to the stateroom scene in which the four main characters all cram into a small janitor&#x27;s closet that Elaine Benes is using to get Chinese food delivered; they all end up spilling out after Cosmo Kramer spills ammonia.
*Mystery writer Jeffrey Cohen paid tribute to the stateroom scene in his novel &quot;A Night at the Operation&quot; (2009). The book&#x27;s title also parodies the name of the movie.

Sanity clause
*The British punk band The Damned used Chico&#x27;s quote (&quot;There ain&#x27;t no sanity clause&quot;) as a title for a 1980 single.
*&quot;Detective Comics #826&quot; pays homage to the film. In it the Joker captures Tim Drake, the third Robin, and takes him on a mad spree in a car, running over anyone they encounter over the Christmas season. When the Joker plans to kill a street Santa Claus, Robin distracts him by saying &quot;You can&#x27;t fool me. There ain&#x27;t no Sanity Claus.&quot; The Joker laughs and they get in an argument over which Marx Brothers film is the source of the gag. Robin claims it is from &quot;The Big Store&quot;. The Joker is distracted long enough for Robin to attack him and escape. The Joker himself uses the line in &quot;&quot;.

General
*The British rock group Queen paid homage to this film by naming their 1975 studio album after it. Their follow-up album, &quot;A Day at the Races&quot;, was also named after a Marx Brothers film.
*The film&#x27;s script is credited as the basis for the 1992 film &quot;Brain Donors&quot;, executive produced by David Zucker and Jerry Zucker of &quot;Airplane!&quot; and &quot;The Naked Gun&quot; fame.
*In the 1990 film &quot;The Freshman&quot;, &quot;Rodolfo Lassparri&quot; is the alias used on Matthew Broderick&#x27;s passport.
*In the 1993 film &quot;Six Degrees of Separation&quot; (also released by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer), Kitty Carlisle appears in the small role of Mrs. Bannister; during production of the film, the idea of naming her character either Rosa Castaldi or Rosa Baroni was discussed as a tribute to her role in &quot;A Night at the Opera&quot; nearly 60 years earlier, but the idea never came to fruition.
*The German power metal band Blind Guardian paid homage to this film by naming one of their albums after it.
*The demented main character played by veteran horror actor Bill Moseley in Rob Zombie&#x27;s films &quot;House of 1000 Corpses&quot;, &quot;The Devil&#x27;s Rejects&quot;, and &quot;3 From Hell&quot; is named Otis B. Driftwood. He is the older brother of Baby Firefly, and stepson to Cutter &quot;Captain Spaulding&quot; Firefly. He takes over leadership of the family of killers following Captain Spaulding&#x27;s prison execution in &quot;3 From Hell&quot;.

<text>The Night of the Hunter is a 1955 American thriller film directed by Charles Laughton and starring Robert Mitchum, Shelley Winters and Lillian Gish. The screenplay by James Agee was based on the 1953 novel of the same name by Davis Grubb. The plot is about Preacher Harry Powell (Mitchum), a serial killer who poses as a preacher and pursues two children in an attempt to get his hands on $10,000 of stolen cash hidden by their late father.

The novel and film draw on the true story of Harry Powers, who was hanged in 1932 for the murder of two widows and three children in Clarksburg, West Virginia. The film&#x27;s lyrical and expressionistic style, borrowing techniques from silent film, sets it apart from other Hollywood films of the 1940s and 1950s, and it has influenced such later directors as Rainer Werner Fassbinder, Robert Altman, Spike Lee, Martin Scorsese, the Coen brothers and Guillermo del Toro.

&quot;The Night of the Hunter&quot; premiered on July 26, 1955, in Des Moines, Iowa, to negative reviews. It became the only directorial feature of Laughton. Over the years, the film has been positively reevaluated and is considered one of the best films ever made. It was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry in 1992. French film magazine &quot;Cahiers du Cinéma&quot; selected &quot;The Night of the Hunter&quot; in 2008 as the second-best film of all time, behind &quot;Citizen Kane&quot;.

==Plot==
Preacher Harry Powell is a serial killer and self-proclaimed preacher traveling along the Ohio River in West Virginia during the Great Depression. He is arrested for driving a stolen car and serves 30 days at Moundsville Penitentiary. There he shares a cell with Ben Harper, who killed two men in a bank robbery for $10,000. Harper made his children, John and Pearl, promise to never reveal where he hid the money. Despite Powell&#x27;s attempts to worm it out of him, Harper takes the secret to his grave when he is hanged for the murders.

Upon his release from prison, Powell visits Harper&#x27;s tiny hometown, where he charms the townsfolk and woos Harper&#x27;s widow, Willa, a waitress for Walter Spoon and his wife Icey. Overnight Powell manages to win the town&#x27;s trust and weds Willa, but John remains instinctively distrustful of him. Powell suspects that John knows where the money is hidden and threatens him to reveal its location. John accidentally reveals that he and Pearl do know where the money is. After Powell refuses to consummate their marriage, Willa deludes herself that he married her to redeem her soul and begins preaching alongside him in tent revivals. She later loses her faith in him when she overhears Powell threatening Pearl to make her reveal where the money is hidden.

Powell murders Willa and ties her body to a Model T that he sinks in the river, then claims that she left her family for a life of sin when Walter and Icey question her abrupt disappearance. Uncle Birdie, an elderly friend of the family, discovers Willa&#x27;s body while fishing, but refrains from telling the police for fear that he will be accused of Willa&#x27;s murder.

Powell threatens the children and learns the money is hidden inside Pearl&#x27;s doll. The children escape an enraged Powell and attempt to seek refuge with Birdie, whom they find in a drunken stupor. They use their father&#x27;s small johnboat to flee down the river and find sanctuary with Rachel Cooper, a tough woman who looks after stray children.

Powell kills a farmer for his horse and eventually tracks them down, but Rachel sees through his deceptions and runs him off her property with a shotgun. Powell returns after dark. During an all-night standoff, Rachel gives Powell a face full of birdshot. She summons the state police, who arrive and arrest Powell for Willa&#x27;s murder. John breaks down during Powell&#x27;s handcuffing, having a flashback of his father&#x27;s fate. He beats the doll against Powell&#x27;s struggling body in anguish, spilling the cash.

During Powell&#x27;s trial John cannot bring himself to testify against him. After Powell&#x27;s sentencing, Rachel takes John and the other children away as Icey leads a lynch mob toward the police station. Powell is escorted out the back to safety just in time, but the prison hangman vows to see him again soon. John and Pearl spend their first Christmas together with Rachel and her brood of stray children.

==Cast==
==Production==

This was the only film solely directed by and credited to the actor Charles Laughton. Laughton, in addition to Irving Allen and Burgess Meredith, directed the film &quot;The Man on the Eiffel Tower&quot;; Meredith was the only director credited for the film. Laughton had directed plays on Broadway, most produced by his friend Paul Gregory.

===Development===
Harold Matson, a literary agent, sent a copy of the 1953 novel &quot;The Night of the Hunter&quot; by Davis Grubb to Paul Gregory. He sent the book to Laughton, who loved it and described it as a &quot;nightmarish Mother Goose story&quot;. Laughton contacted Grubb, and the two of them instantly got along very well. He traveled to Philadelphia, where Grubb lived, and they spent five days discussing ideas for the film. Grubb had studied art in college, so he offered to draw sketches as a form of inspiration. Laughton loved the drawings, and many of them were used in the film&#x27;s storyboard.

At first Grubb was being considered to write the screenplay himself, but the studio wanted to hire someone with experience writing for films. James Agee was hired as the screenwriter because he was from the South and had experience writing about the Depression. Agee began writing in April 1954, and finished in June, but his script was 293 pages: much too long for a feature film. Laughton made significant rewrites to the script, and his was the version used for shooting, even though he insisted that Agee be credited as the only writer. Agee&#x27;s original script ended with a shot of children&#x27;s faces floating among the stars, an idea that was eventually moved to the opening of the film. Throughout 1954, Gregory worked with the Production Code Administration to change the script to meet the guidelines of the Production Code. There was much concern about depicting a preacher on screen as an evil person, and Gregory made an effort to make the character of the Preacher not appear to be a real, ordained minister. Eventually the script was approved, but Protestant groups who had read the script continued to object to the film&#x27;s production.

While preparing for the filming, Laughton studied silent films by viewing their original nitrate prints, including &quot;The Birth of a Nation&quot;, &quot;Intolerance&quot;, and &quot;The Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse&quot;. He wanted to &quot;restore the power of silent films to talkies.&quot;

The budget of the film was a little under $600,000, of which about $75,000 was for the rights to adapt the novel.

===Casting===

Laughton&#x27;s initial thought after reading the novel was to cast himself in the role of the preacher, but Gregory convinced him that no studio would finance a film unless they cast someone else. For the most part, he did not hold traditional auditions for the actors; he simply met with them to get a sense of their personalities and whether they were right for the role.

Laughton considered casting Gary Cooper as Harry Powell, but Cooper declined the role as he thought it might be detrimental to his career. John Carradine expressed interest in the role of the Preacher, as did Laurence Olivier, but his schedule was not free for two years. Robert Mitchum was eager for the part of the preacher. When he auditioned, a moment that particularly impressed Charles Laughton was when Laughton described the character as &quot;a diabolical shit&quot;, and Mitchum promptly answered &quot;Present!&quot; Laughton liked Mitchum for the role partly due to his sexual persona, but Grubb was concerned about the character of the preacher being considered sexual. Laughton told him, &quot;If you want to sell God, you have to be sexy.&quot;

Agnes Moorehead, Grace Kelly, and Betty Grable were all considered for the role of Willa Harper. In the end Laughton chose Shelley Winters because he felt she had a vulnerable quality and was more of a serious actor than a movie star; she committed to the role only two weeks before filming began. In her 1989 memoir, Winters described this as &quot;probably the most thoughtful and reserved performance I ever gave&quot;.

Laughton&#x27;s first pick for the role of Rachel Cooper was his wife Elsa Lanchester. Jane Darwell and Louise Fazenda also were considered. Lanchester, for reasons unknown to Laughton, turned down the role, suggesting silent movie star Lillian Gish for the role. A doubtful Laughton went to New York for the purpose of watching films in which Gish starred. These included the shorts and feature films she made with pioneer D.W. Griffith. Gish had gotten word of his watching these old movies, and when she asked him why, he replied, &quot;When I first went to the movies, they sat in their seats straight and leaned forward. Now they slump down, with their heads back, and eat candy and popcorn. I want them to sit up straight again.&quot;

===Filming===

Principal photography of &quot;The Night of the Hunter&quot; began on August 15 and ended on October 7, 1954, a total of 36 days of shooting. Laughton kept the editor and musical composer on set during filming, which was very uncommon at the time. Mitchum originally suggested that Laughton shoot the film in authentic Appalachian locations, but the director could not afford the budget to do on-location shooting. Besides, he wanted to create the film&#x27;s unique look on Hollywood sound stages and found what he was looking for at Pathé, Republic Studios, and the Rowland V. Lee ranch in the San Fernando Valley. Certain cutaway shots and compositing shots were shot in West Virginia. Laughton hired Terry Sanders as second unit director in order to scout and shoot the river scenes because he had recently directed an Academy Award-winning short film &quot;A Time Out of War&quot;, which mostly took place on a river.

Rather than shooting with traditional takes, Laughton had the crew only slate at the beginning of each reel of film and let the camera roll continuously until the reel ran out. This was so that he could direct the actors without waiting to reset the camera and sound equipment, not unlike the way silent films used to be directed. Shelley Winters told Laughton she had this image of Willa as being &quot;a fly fascinated by a spider, and she very willingly walks into this web&quot;. He liked this image and told her to channel that into the performance. Indeed, a stylized spider and web are seen as the children make their way along the riverbank at night fleeing Mitchum. Mitchum&#x27;s performance in the film has been described as Brechtian acting, which Laughton had extensive experience with. According to Lillian Gish, Laughton was very unsure of himself on set as this was his first time directing a film, and when someone would give him a suggestion he would start talking about fears that his whole vision was wrong. Laughton&#x27;s directing style was supportive and respectful of the actors&#x27; input and several of the actors have said it was among their favorite professional experiences.

The director of photography was Stanley Cortez, who also shot Orson Welles&#x27; 1942 film &quot;The Magnificent Ambersons&quot;. Because Laughton had very little experience working with film, Cortez would visit his house to explain various concepts of camera lenses, camera heights, and what effect each of them gave. Laughton told Cortez that the nitrate prints of the silent movies that he had been watching for research impressed him with how sharp they looked, so he asked Cortez to create that same sharpness for &quot;The Night of the Hunter&quot;. The studio brought most of the crew from a recent film &quot;Black Tuesday&quot; because they had worked so well together, and Cortez had experimented with a new black-and-white film Kodak Tri-X on that production, with great results. He chose to shoot certain scenes of this film on Tri-X because it had a sharp contrast that would help fulfill Laughton&#x27;s vision. The studio however, tried to convince them to shoot on color film instead because they thought it would sell more tickets. Gregory fought to keep it black-and-white: &quot;I could not see this film being in color.&quot; The style of the cinematography was split up between the two units: the first unit of the crew shot the scenes in and around the Harpers&#x27; home, which were very dark, whereas the second unit shot the scenes traveling along the river, which were designed to look more like images from the children&#x27;s perspective. One scene in particular that Cortez has spoken about is in the bedroom after Willa has overheard Powell threatening the children. He lit this scene with a halo of light surrounding Willa&#x27;s head on the pillow, foreshadowing that her death is imminent. Cortez also brought back the Iris shot in one scene, as an homage to silent films.

Laughton drew on the harsh, angular look of German expressionist films of the 1920s, which is especially noticeable in the art direction by Hilyard Brown. He had the idea that children notice only certain details of their surroundings that they are focused on, which is why some set pieces are somewhat abstract and minimal: neon lights that are not attached to a particular store, white picket fences that are not surrounding any house, the barn along the river that looks like a painting, and the &quot;chapel-like&quot; parents&#x27; bedroom. The river scenes with the children were all shot on a sound stage. The shot of John looking out of the barn window and seeing Powell&#x27;s silhouette on the horizon was created using a little person and a miniature horse. The underwater scene showing Willa&#x27;s dead body was shot in a studio using a mannequin with a custom mask to make it look like Winters.

===Score===
The film&#x27;s score, composed and arranged by Walter Schumann in close association with Laughton, features a combination of nostalgic and expressionistic orchestral passages. The film has two original songs by Schumann, &quot;Lullaby&quot; (sung by Kitty White, whom Schumann discovered in a nightclub) and &quot;Pretty Fly&quot; (originally sung by Sally Jane Bruce as Pearl, but later dubbed by an actress named Betty Benson). A recurring musical device involves the preacher making his presence known by singing the traditional hymn &quot;Leaning on the Everlasting Arms&quot;. RCA Victor was impressed by the score, so in 1955 they released a soundtrack with Schumann&#x27;s score and Laughton narrating an abridged version of the story, also written by Grubb.

===Post production===
The film&#x27;s editor, Robert Golden, has said that after he screened the complete film to one of the United Artists studio executives for the first time, the executive told Golden, &quot;It&#x27;s too arty.&quot;

==Release==

&quot;The Night of the Hunter&quot; premiered on July 26, 1955, in Des Moines, Iowa, a special event to raise money for the YMCA in Gregory&#x27;s hometown, which included a parade and a broadcast on &quot;The Tonight Show&quot;. It later had its premiere in Los Angeles on August 26, 1955, and in New York on September 29, 1955.

To promote the film, the &quot;Los Angeles Herald-Express&quot; serialized the film&#x27;s script throughout April 1955. The film also received an extensive promotional campaign from United Artists, but they weren&#x27;t sure about the best way to promote it because it didn&#x27;t fall into any typical film genres, and the promotional material didn&#x27;t give a good sense of what the film was about. However, one of the film&#x27;s advertisements won an award for being in the top 50 best advertisements of 1954 from the American Institute of Graphic Arts. According to Paul Gregory, &quot;absolutely no money was spent on promotion...United Artists didn&#x27;t have the muscle, desire, or intelligence to handle the picture.&quot; He originally had the idea to tour the film &quot;road show style&quot;, stopping at certain cities that were familiar with Laughton&#x27;s plays, but he could not convince the studio.

The Roman Catholic Diocese of Cheyenne denied the film&#x27;s release, and Gregory wanted to put together a lawsuit against them, but the studio would not allow him to.

==Reception==
===Contemporaneous===
&quot;The Night of the Hunter&quot; was a failure with both audiences and critics at its initial release. Laughton took the failure of his first film personally, and never attempted to make another film.

Bosley Crowther of &quot;The New York Times&quot; called the film &quot;a weird and intriguing endeavor&quot;, adding: &quot;unfortunately the story and the thesis presented by Mr. Grubb had to be carried through by Mr. Laughton to a finish—and it is here that he goes wrong. For the evolution of the melodrama, after the threatened, frightened children flee home, angles off into that allegorical contrast of the forces of Evil and Good.&quot; Gene Arneel of &quot;Variety&quot; summarized: &quot;The relentless terror of Davis Grubb&#x27;s novel got away from Paul Gregory and Charles Laughton in their translation of &quot;Night of the Hunter&quot;. This start for Gregory as producer and Laughton as director is rich in promise but the completed product, bewitching at times, loses sustained drive via too many offbeat touches that have a misty effect.&quot; &quot;Harrison&#x27;s Reports&quot; wrote, &quot;The picture might have some appeal for those who patronize art houses in search of the unusual in movie fare, but the great majority of those who see it will look upon it as a choppily-edited, foggy melodrama peopled with foggy characters.&quot; &quot;Life&quot; summed up the film, &quot;If sometimes it strains too hard at being simple and winds up being pretentious, it still is one of the year&#x27;s most interesting and provocative films.&quot;

The Legion of Decency gave the film a B because it degraded marriage, and the Protestant Motion Picture Council rated it &quot;objectionable&quot;, saying that any religious person would be offended by it. The film was also banned in Memphis, Tennessee, by the city&#x27;s head of censorship, Lloyd Binford. Great Britain rated the film &quot;adults only.&quot;

===Retrospective===
Over time, &quot;The Night of the Hunter&quot; has been reassessed and recognized as a classic. It began as a cult film, with a small group of fans, and regularly played at museums and in revival houses. Its popularity grew as a new generation of children were exposed to the film when it played on television. In the 1970s, as the field of film criticism began to expand, many articles were written about the film.

Roger Ebert wrote, &quot;what a compelling, frightening and beautiful film it is! And how well it has survived its period. Many films of the mid-1950s, even the good ones, seem somewhat dated now, but by setting his story in an invented movie world outside conventional realism, Laughton gave it a timelessness... It is one of the most frightening of movies, with one of the most unforgettable of villains, and on both of those scores, it holds up... well after four decades.&quot; Dave Kehr wrote that &quot;Charles Laughton&#x27;s first and only film as a director is an enduring masterpiece—dark, deep, beautiful, aglow... The source of its style and power is mysterious—it is a film without precedent and without any real equals.&quot;

On Rotten Tomatoes, 93% of gave the film a positive review, with a weighted average rating of 9.10/10. The site&#x27;s critical consensus reads, &quot;Featuring Robert Mitchum&#x27;s formidable performance as a child-hunting preacher, &quot;The Night of the Hunter&quot; is a disturbing look at good and evil.&quot; 

===Legacy===
In 1992, the United States Library of Congress deemed &quot;The Night of the Hunter&quot; to be &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant&quot;, and selected the film for preservation in its National Film Registry. The film was rated No. 90 on Bravo&#x27;s 100 Scariest Movie Moments. In a 2007 listing of the 100 Most Beautiful Films, &quot;Cahiers du cinéma&quot; ranked &quot;The Night of the Hunter&quot; No. 2. It is among the top ten in the BFI list of the 50 films you should see by the age of 14. In 2008, it was ranked as the 71st greatest movie of all time by &quot;Empire&quot; magazine in its issue of &quot;The 500 Greatest Movies of All Time&quot;. In 2012, &quot;Sight and Sound&quot; magazine&#x27;s decennial &quot;Greatest Films of All Time&quot; poll ranked it as the 63rd greatest film ever made; in 2022, the same poll put it at No. 25.

American Film Institute recognition
* AFI&#x27;s 100 Years...100 Thrills – No. 34
* AFI&#x27;s 100 Years...100 Heroes &amp; Villains – Preacher Harry Powell - Villain No. 29

Powell&#x27;s speech about love and hate has become a memorable moment in film history. In the 1989 Spike Lee film &quot;Do the Right Thing&quot;, the character Radio Raheem wears brass knuckles saying &quot;love&quot; and &quot;hate&quot; on each hand and gives a speech that is an almost verbatim copy of Powell&#x27;s.

The Coen brothers have referenced &quot;The Night of the Hunter&quot; in several of their own films, including &quot;The Big Lebowski&quot; (&quot;the Dude abides&quot;, an echo of Rachel&#x27;s closing line &quot;They abide, and they endure&quot;) and &quot;True Grit&quot; (the visual style of Rooster&#x27;s night ride with Mattie is similar to that of John and Pearl&#x27;s river journey, and the score uses the music from &quot;Leaning on the Everlasting Arms&quot;).

==Home media==
&quot;The Night of the Hunter&quot; was released on DVD by MGM Home Entertainment in 2000. On November 16, 2010, the film was released on Blu-ray and DVD by The Criterion Collection in association with the University of California, Los Angeles film archive. Among other supplemental material the Criterion edition includes are various interviews with the cast and crew along with an appearance of the cast on &quot;The Ed Sullivan Show&quot; performing a deleted scene from the film and the two-and-a-half hour documentary &quot;Charles Laughton Directs &quot;The Night of the Hunter&quot;&quot;. Kino Lorber released a 4K UHD Blu-ray edition of the film on May 30, 2023.

In 1974, film archivists Robert Gitt and Anthony Slide retrieved several boxes of photographs, sketches, memos, and letters relating to the film from Laughton&#x27;s widow Elsa Lanchester for the American Film Institute. Lanchester also gave the Institute over 80,000 feet of rushes and outtakes from the filming. In 1981, this material was sent to the UCLA Film and Television Archive where, for the next 20 years, they were edited into a two-and-half hour documentary that premiered in 2002, at UCLA&#x27;s Festival of Preservation.

The film was remade in 1991 as a TV movie starring Richard Chamberlain.

The band Cardiacs have referenced the movie on numerous occasions. On their 1999 album Guns, the songs &#x27;Clean That Evil Mud Out Your Soul&#x27; and &#x27;Wind and Rains Is Cold&#x27; both feature lyrics derived from dialogue from the movie. The cover art of their 1996 album Sing to God is also a homage to the opening shot of the film.

In 2020, it was reported that Universal Pictures is working on a remake of the film set in the present day, and being written by Matt Orton.

In 2023, The Libertines released a single titled &quot;Night of the Hunter&quot;, which takes its title from the film and contains several lyrical allusions to its characters and plot. Peter Doherty, who co-wrote the song, said to the NME:

“We got the title from Charles Laughton’s directorial debut &quot;Night Of The Hunter&quot; starring Robert Mitchum as a preacher with ‘LOVE’ and ‘HATE’ tattooed on his knuckles”.

<text>Nothing but a Man is a 1964 American independent drama film starring Ivan Dixon and Abbey Lincoln, and directed by Michael Roemer, who also co-wrote the film with Robert M. Young. The film tells the story of Duff Anderson, an African-American railroad worker in the early 1960s who tries to maintain his dignity in a small racist town near Birmingham, Alabama, after he marries the local preacher&#x27;s daughter. In addition to dealing with oppression and discrimination, Anderson must also come to terms with his troubled relationship with his own father, a drunk who abandoned and rejected him.

Although it was not widely seen upon release due to difficulties in finding distribution, the film is now generally considered to be an important example of neorealistic American cinema. In 1993, it was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant&quot;.

==Plot==
Duff Anderson works on a railroad section gang near Birmingham, Alabama, earning a good wage and living an itinerant life with his black co-workers. On their night off, while the other men drink and visit a pool hall, Duff decides to walk into the nearby small town, and ends up at a church meeting featuring good food and lively gospel music. There, Duff meets the pretty and genteel schoolteacher Josie, the daughter of Preacher Dawson. They begin to date against the wishes of Josie&#x27;s father and stepmother, who think the relatively uneducated, non-religious, and (to them) arrogant Duff is not good enough for Josie. Despite her parents&#x27; objections, Josie continues to see Duff, partly because Duff shows himself willing to resist and challenge the social conventions that oppress black people, rather than just accepting the status quo in order to get along with white people, as Josie&#x27;s father has done.

Initially, Duff is just looking for a sexual relationship and tells Josie he doesn&#x27;t want to get married. But after Duff visits his four-year-old illegitimate son in the care of an unloving, indifferent stepmother, and his emotionally abusive, hardly functioning drunken father (Harris) living off his girlfriend (Lee), Duff realizes that he prefers the stability of a family to the life of a drifter. Duff and Josie marry with bright hopes for the future but then begin to face a series of challenges as a married couple.

Duff quits the section gang and takes a lower paying job at the local sawmill in order to have a stable home life. Being on the move had given Duff the illusion of freedom, but living in the town makes Duff subject to the town&#x27;s social rules, and he immediately starts to have problems. Unlike his peers, Duff refuses to pretend to be friendly to white people who treat him obnoxiously or patronize him. Duff tries to encourage his black co-workers at the mill to stick together and stand up for their rights, but one of them informs on him to the white mill bosses, who suspect him of being a union organizer and troublemaker. After Duff refuses to follow his white boss&#x27;s order to retract his statements to the other men, Duff is fired, and subsequently finds himself blacklisted at other area mills. Despite diligently searching for work, he is unable to find another job that is not humiliating and that also pays enough to support his family, now including a baby on the way.

Duff hates his preacher father-in-law, whom he sees as having sold out to the white people in return for social status and economic gain, and he hurtfully says to his wife, &quot;You&#x27;ve never really been a nigger, living with them, in that house.&quot; Nevertheless, out of concern for Josie, Preacher Dawson uses his connections in the town to get Duff a job at a white-owned gas station. Soon, white customers who find Duff too proud for a black &quot;boy&quot; threaten to cause trouble if the boss keeps him on, and he loses that job as well. Although Josie is understanding, Duff, under emotional pressure and in a rage, shoves his pregnant wife to the floor when she tries to comfort him. Duff packs his bag and leaves their house, telling Josie that he will write her when he is on his feet again.

Duff storms off to his father, and finds him so inebriated that he dies as Duff and Lee are driving him to the hospital. Neither Duff nor Lee know where Duff&#x27;s father was born or how old he was, and the only possessions he has handed down to Duff are the contents of his pockets. Duff decides to return home with his young son, whom Josie had been wanting to adopt. Duff and Josie tearfully embrace as he reassures her that it &quot;ain&#x27;t gonna be easy, baby, but it&#x27;s going to be alright. Baby, I feel so free inside”.

==Production==
The screenplay was written by Robert M. Young and Michael Roemer, who drew on his own background as a Jew persecuted by Nazis. Roemer had fled Nazi Germany as an 11-year-old child on the Kindertransports. Before starting to write, Roemer and Young went on a quest to understand and get to know the African-American culture of the South. They “left on an Underground Railway in reverse”. As liberal Jews in the South, they were treated by whites as pariahs and warned that their food might be poisoned, causing them to relate strongly to the black families whom they met. They allowed themselves to be passed on from one family and community to the next so they could learn as much as possible about the relationships and experiences. One morning in Mississippi, the plot of a young couple&#x27;s struggles and the man&#x27;s relationship with his father came to Roemer, and the script was written in six weeks as soon as they were back in New York City.

Although the script was written quickly, casting took several months. Charles Gordone was responsible for introducing the writers to some of the main talent, including Broadway actor Ivan Dixon, who went on to play the role of Staff Sergeant James Kinchloe on the CBS-TV sitcom &quot;Hogan&#x27;s Heroes&quot;, and jazz great Abbey Lincoln. Julius Harris made his acting debut in the film playing Duff&#x27;s father. Harris was a nurse before he was cast, but had always wanted to act. Yaphet Kotto also had his first credited movie role in the film, playing a railroad worker. Both Harris and Kotto went on to appear in many more films and television programs over the next four decades.

At the last minute, the film&#x27;s title was almost changed to &quot;Duff Anderson&quot;.

==Reception==

&quot;Nothing but a Man&quot; premiered at Philharmonic Hall and had a limited run in a few cities, receiving rave reviews at the New York Film Festival and winning a coveted prize at the Venice Film Festival. However, according to Roger Ebert, the film&#x27;s release was &quot;spotty&quot; and little money was available for its promotion. The film was mostly shown at theaters specializing in independent and foreign films. Ebert has suggested that it failed to find a wider audience because it did not &quot;[employ] the easy liberal pieties of its period in an attempt to reassure white audiences that all stories have happy endings.&quot;

As a result, the film became, in Ebert&#x27;s words, &quot;more famous than familiar&quot; and as of the early 1990s, few people had seen it. In 1993, a restored print of the film was nationally re-released, bringing it to the attention of a wider audience. It was later released on DVD in 2004.

The film has received many excellent reviews and as of 2022, had a 98% fresh rating on the review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes from 44 critics. A &quot;Washington Post&quot; review at the time of the film&#x27;s 1993 re-release called it &quot;one of the most sensitive films about black life ever made in this country&quot;. Ivan Dixon&#x27;s performance in the film has been called the best of his career.

==Honors and awards==
In 1964, &quot;Nothing but a Man&quot; won the San Giorgio Prize at the Venice Film Festival, awarded to films considered especially important for the progress of civilization. The film was added to the National Film Registry of the Library of Congress in 1993.

==Soundtrack==
The soundtrack to the film was put together by Wilbur Kirk. It uses many early 1960s hit songs released by Motown Records; it was the label&#x27;s first original soundtrack recording. Motown released an original soundtrack album for the film on CD in 1996.

<text>Out of the Past (billed in the United Kingdom as Build My Gallows High) is a 1947 American film noir directed by Jacques Tourneur and starring Robert Mitchum, Jane Greer, and Kirk Douglas. The film was adapted by Daniel Mainwaring (using the pseudonym Geoffrey Homes) from his 1946 novel &quot;Build My Gallows High&quot; (also written as Homes), with uncredited revisions by Frank Fenton and James M. Cain.

Its complex, fatalistic storyline, dark cinematography, and classic &quot;femme fatale&quot; garnered the film critical acclaim and cult status. In 1991, the National Film Preservation Board at the Library of Congress added &quot;Out of the Past&quot; to the United States National Film Registry of “culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant” films.

==Plot==
Joe Stefanos arrives in Bridgeport, California, a rural mountain town, seeking Jeff Bailey, who owns a local gas station. Joe meets The Kid, Jeff&#x27;s deaf-mute employee and friend, and asks him about Jeff&#x27;s whereabouts. Meanwhile, Jeff is fishing with Ann Miller. They are in love, though her lifelong friend Jim is jealous. The Kid shows up at the fishing spot and interrupts them, signing to Jeff that someone is asking about him. Jeff returns to the gas station and Stefanos tells Jeff that he must go to Lake Tahoe to meet &quot;Whit&quot; and that it has been a long time since they met.

Jeff invites Ann to ride with him to Whit&#x27;s place. He tells her about his past in a flashback that took place three years ago. Jeff Bailey&#x27;s real name is Jeff Markham. He and Jack Fisher were partners and private investigators in New York. Whit Sterling, a gambling kingpin, hires Markham—solo—to find Whit&#x27;s girlfriend, Kathie Moffat, who shot Whit and stole $40,000 from him. Whit promises Jeff she will not be harmed if he finds her and has her returned to him.

Jeff eventually corners Kathie in Acapulco. He is immediately taken by her beauty. She admits she shot Whit and that she hates him, but denies taking his money. Eventually, Jeff falls in love with her and proposes that they run away together. Suddenly, Whit and Stefanos show up at Jeff&#x27;s place in Acapulco. They ask Jeff if he managed to find Kathie but he lies to them and says that Kathie is on a south-bound steamer. Whit instructs Jeff to keep looking for her.

Jeff and Kathie then secretly run to San Francisco. At first they avoid appearing in public spaces, but then feel more comfortable to go out as time moves on. However, Jack Fisher, who is now working for Whit, spots Jeff at the track. Jeff arranges to meet Kathie to split and then meet at a mountain cabin to lose Fisher from trailing him, but Fisher chooses to follow Kathie instead and catches them at the cabin. Fisher tries to blackmail them and the two men brawl. Kathie deliberately kills Fisher and drives away, leaving behind a bank book showing a balance of $40,000. She had in fact taken Whit&#x27;s money.

The flashback ends. Jeff wants to clean things up and return to Ann. Ann drops him off at Whit&#x27;s estate. A cheerful Whit tells Jeff he has a job for him. To his surprise, Jeff finds out that Kathie went back to Whit and she appears as the two men have breakfast. She later comes to speak privately with Jeff and she tells him that she had no choice but to come back. She told Whit about their relationship but not about what happened to Fisher. He tells her to get out.

Leonard Eels, a crooked San Francisco lawyer, helped Whit dodge $1 million in taxes and is now blackmailing him. Whit wants Jeff to recover the incriminating records and tells him to meet with Eels&#x27;s secretary. The secretary, Meta Carson, explains the plan to Jeff, who suspects he is being framed. That night, at Eels&#x27;s apartment, Jeff alerts Eels, obliquely, promising to return. After Jeff and Meta leave Eels&#x27;s apartment, Jeff trails Meta, then returns and finds Eels dead. He decides to hide the body in the closet.

Jeff then sneaks into Meta&#x27;s apartment, and overhears Kathie arranging for the discovery of Eels&#x27;s body. When the hidden body is not found, she believes Eels has escaped. Jeff confronts her, and Kathie reveals that she gave Whit a signed affidavit swearing that Jeff killed Fisher. She says they can start all over again. They kiss, he leaves. Stefanos arrives and confirms to Kathie that he killed Eels.

Jeff consigns the tax papers to a delivery service. Whit&#x27;s thugs capture him. He offers the incriminating records in exchange for the affidavit, without implicating Kathie. When Kathie and Meta arrive at Eels&#x27;s apartment to retrieve the affidavit, the police are already there. The women instead phone Whit.

Jeff becomes wanted for the murders of Fisher and Eels, and police expect him to return to Bridgeport. Stefanos, directed by Kathie, trails the Kid to the gorge where Jeff is hiding out. The Kid spots Stefanos poised to shoot Jeff and hooks his coat with a fishing line, pulling him off-balance so that he falls to his death. Jeff returns to Whit&#x27;s mansion to inform them of Stefanos&#x27; death and to tell Whit about Kathie&#x27;s double-cross. He suggests making Stefanos&#x27; death look like a guilt-ridden suicide after his murder of Eels. He will return the records if Whit destroys Kathie&#x27;s affidavit and hands her over to the police for Fisher&#x27;s death. Whit accepts, promising Kathie he will kill her if she does not cooperate.

Jeff meets Ann in the woods. She believes in him, but tells him to be absolutely sure of what he wants. She promises to wait for him.

Jeff discovers that Kathie has killed Whit. She gives Jeff a choice: run away with her or take the blame for all three murders. He dials the phone while she is upstairs packing. They leave in a car with Jeff driving. Seeing a police roadblock ahead, Kathie shoots him. She fires at the police. A machine gun riddles the car with bullets, killing her.

In Bridgeport, Ann asks the Kid if Jeff was going away with Kathie. Lying, the Kid nods his head. Ann gets into Jim&#x27;s car, and the Kid smiles, saluting Jeff&#x27;s name on the gas station&#x27;s sign.

==Background and production==
&quot;Out of the Past&quot; was produced by RKO Pictures, and the key personnel—director Jacques Tourneur, cinematographer Nicholas Musuraca, actors Mitchum and Greer, along with Albert S. D&#x27;Agostino&#x27;s design group—were long-time RKO collaborators. Although the studio focused on making B-films during the early 1940s, the post–World War II &quot;Out of the Past&quot; was given a comparatively lavish budget.

John Garfield and Dick Powell turned down the lead. Kirk Douglas, in only his third credited screen performance, plays a supporting role but a central part in the story as Mitchum&#x27;s antagonist. The next time Mitchum and Douglas played major roles in the same picture was in the 1967 Western &quot;The Way West&quot;, alongside Richard Widmark.

Musuraca also shot Tourneur&#x27;s 1942 RKO horror film &quot;Cat People&quot;.

==Reception==
The film made a profit of $90,000.

&quot;Out of the Past&quot; is considered one of the greatest of all films noir. Robert Ottoson hailed the film as &quot;the &quot;ne plus ultra&quot; of forties film noir&quot;. Bosley Crowther, the film critic for &quot;The New York Times&quot; in 1947, complimented the crime drama&#x27;s direction and performances, although he did find the latter portion of the screenplay hard to follow:

Shortly after the film&#x27;s release, the staff of the widely read trade publication &quot;Variety&quot; also gave it a positive review:
&quot;James Agee&quot; writing in 1948: &quot;&quot;Out of the Past&quot; is a medium-grade thriller...Fairly well played, and very well photographed...the action develops a routine kind of pseudo-tension...Robert Mitchum is so very sleepily self-confident with the women that when he slopes into clinches you expect him to snore in their faces.&quot; 

Decades later, in his 2004 assessment of the film for the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot;, critic Roger Ebert noted:

With regard to the production&#x27;s stylish and moody cinematography, Ebert also dubbed the film &quot;The greatest cigarette-smoking movie of all time&quot;:
&quot;Pauline Kael&quot;: &quot;A thin but well-shot suspense melodrama...It&#x27;s empty trash, but you do keep watching it.&quot; 

The film holds a score of 93% on review aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes, with an average rating of 9/10, based on 40 reviews.

==Adaptations==
&quot;Out of the Past&quot; was remade as &quot;Against All Odds&quot; (1984) with Rachel Ward in the Greer role, Jeff Bridges filling in for Mitchum, and James Woods as a variation of Kirk Douglas&#x27; villain, with Jane Greer as the mother of her original character in &quot;Out of the Past&quot; and Richard Widmark in a supporting role.

On November 14, 1987, Mitchum guest hosted &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;. Greer made a surprise appearance in a gag sequel called &quot;Out of Gas,&quot; in which their characters met again 40 years later at a filling station.

Has been shown on the Turner Classic Movies show &quot;Noir Alley&quot; with Eddie Muller.

<doc id="75267" wikidata="Q1303662" url="?curid=75267" title="Letchworth State Park">
<text>Letchworth State Park is a New York State Park located in Livingston County and Wyoming County in the western part of the State of New York. The park is roughly long, following the course of the Genesee River as it flows north through a deep gorge and over several large waterfalls. It is located southwest of Rochester and southeast of Buffalo, and spans portions of the Livingston County towns of Leicester, Mount Morris and Portage, as well as the Wyoming County towns of Castile and Genesee Falls.

In 1859, Buffalo industrialist William Pryor Letchworth (1823–1910) began purchasing land near the Middle Falls, and started construction of his Glen Iris Estate. In 1906 he bequeathed the estate to New York, which soon after became the core of the newly created Letchworth State Park. The park prominently features three large waterfallsthe Upper, Middle, and Lower Fallson the Genesee River, which flows within a deep gorge that winds through the park. The rock walls of the gorge, which rise up to in places, prompted the area&#x27;s reputation as the &quot;Grand Canyon of the East&quot;.

==Features and activities==
Park entrances are located near Mount Morris, Perry, Castile and Portageville. A paved two or three-lane road follows the west side of the gorge, allowing many scenic viewpoints for the geologic features.

The park includes pavilions, picnic tables, playgrounds, of hiking trails, two large swimming pools, cabins, campsites for tents, trailer sites with dumping stations, and horse-riding trails. Activities within the park include hiking, biking, fishing, whitewater rafting and kayaking, geocaching, and hunting (wild turkey and deer when in season). During the winter, the park facilitates snowmobiling, cross-country skiing, snow tubing, and horse-drawn sleighs. Hot air ballooning is available at the park, weather permitting.

In 2015, Letchworth State Park won &quot;USA Today&quot;&#x27;s Reader&#x27;s Choice competition as the best state park in the United States. In 2020 the park topped a similar list.

===Waterfalls and geology===

Within the park, there are three large waterfalls on the Genesee River and as many as 50 waterfalls found on tributaries that flow into it; the deep gorge formed by the river, with rock walls rising up to in places and which narrow to across above the middle of the three falls, prompted the area&#x27;s reputation as the &quot;Grand Canyon of the East&quot;. The three major waterfalls — called the Upper, Middle, and Lower Falls — are located in Portage Canyon, the southern section of the park. The only trail bridging the Genesee River in the park crosses a stone bridge just below the Lower Falls. The Middle Falls is the highest, and the Upper Falls has a recently-built (2017) active Norfolk Southern Railway arch bridge crossing immediately above it, replacing a historic 1875 Erie Railroad bridge.

The park also contains Inspiration Falls, a ribbon waterfall that is located on a tributary creek a short distance east of the Inspiration Point Overlook, west of the park visitor center. It has a total drop of . While impressive in its height, it is seasonal and often appears as only a water stain on the cliff. The falls faces to the south-southwest and has a crest that is wide.
The bedrock exposed in the gorge is Devonian in age, mostly shales, with some layers of limestone and sandstone. The rock was laid down in an ancient inland sea, and it holds many marine fossils. The landform of the section of the Genesee River valley represented by the park is geologically very young, caused by a diversion of the river from the old valley by the last continental glacier, which forced the river to cut a new section of valley.

===Historic sites and museums===
The historic, restored Glen Iris Inn, William Pryor Letchworth&#x27;s former residence adapted for use as a hotel, is located on the top of a cliff overlooking Middle Falls and offers in-season meals and overnight accommodations. It is open to the public for breakfast, lunch and dinner.

The park is the present-day site of the grave of Mary Jemison, a Scots-Irish immigrant pioneer who was captured at the age of 12 from central Pennsylvania by a French and Shawnee raiding party during the French and Indian War. She was soon adopted by a family of Seneca people, and eventually lived in western New York on the Genesee River. She became thoroughly assimilated and chose to live with the Seneca for the rest of her long life, having a total of seven children by two successive husbands. Her remains were exhumed from the Buffalo Creek Reservation and reinterred on the grounds of a Seneca Council House, relocated to the site by Letchworth and rededicated in 1872.

The park also features the William Pryor Letchworth Museum, which was founded with the collections of the park&#x27;s founder. The exhibits focus on the natural and cultural history of the Genesee Valley, and include archaeological artifacts of the Seneca nation, and displays on Mary Jemison, early pioneers, the Genesee Valley Canal and William Pryor Letchworth.

The Humphrey Nature Center opened in 2016. Operated year-round by New York State, the sustainable building features classrooms and meeting rooms, a research lab, a butterfly garden, and connections to various trails.

===Mount Morris Dam===
Construction of the Mount Morris Dam, at the north end of the park, was begun in 1948 by the United States Army Corps of Engineers under the Flood Control Act of 1944, and completed in 1954. The Genesee River became wider and deeper immediately upstream as a result, but areas downstream were spared yearly flooding which destroyed valuable farmland.

The Mount Morris Dam is the largest flood control device of its kind (concrete gravity) east of the Mississippi River. It is in length and rises from the riverbed. The dam proved its worth during the Flood of 1972, saving thousands of acres of farmland and the city of Rochester from flooding.

===Portage Viaduct===

The Portage Viaduct (1875) was an iron Erie Railroad bridge located upstream and within view of the park&#x27;s Upper Falls. The bridge was long and high. Although walking on the structure was considered trespassing, visitors to the park commonly disregarded warning signs in order to view the gorge from the bridge, despite the safety concerns associated with walking on an active railroad bridge.

On November 29, 2011, Norfolk Southern Railway announced plans to demolish the Portage Viaduct and build a new bridge approximately to the south of the 1875 structure. Norfolk Southern had offered the old bridge to the State of New York, but the offer was declined due to a lack of available funds to convert the bridge into an observation platform. A steel arch design was approved for the bridge&#x27;s replacement in late 2014, at an estimated cost of $71 million. The project was completed in late 2017. New train-activated gates at both ends of the new bridge now keep trespassing tourists off it when no approaching freight train is present.

==Park history==

The territory of the park was long part of the homeland of the Seneca people, who were largely forced out after the American Revolutionary War, as they had been allies of the defeated British. The Seneca called the land around this canyon &quot;Sehgahunda&quot;, the &quot;Vale of the three falls&quot;; the Middle Falls (&quot;Ska-ga-dee&quot;) was believed to be so wondrous it made the sun stop at midday.

Having first viewed the gorge that was to become the park from a train on the nearby railroad trestle in 1858, William Pryor Letchworth purchased an initial of land near the Portage Falls in 1859 and subsequently began work on his Glen Iris Estate. By purchasing the land, Letchworth successfully halted plans to install a hydroelectric dam in the gorge that would have altered the flow of the river and diminished flows over the large waterfalls. He enlisted the services of the famous landscape artist William Webster to design winding paths and roadways, rustic bridges, glistening &quot;lakes&quot; and a sparkling fountain.
Letchworth spent the following years expanding his landholdings in the area. In 1906, Letchworth granted the Glen Iris and the surrounding to the State of New York as a public park, intending to deter commercial businesses from damaging the fragile nature of the gorge and surrounding woodlands. He further required that the land be managed by the American Scenic and Historic Preservation Society. A plaque near the gorge contains a dedication written by Letchworth&#x27;s niece in 1910, and reads:

George F. Kunz, president of the American Scenic and Historic Preservation Society of New York, was an enthusiastic supporter of the park. Dr. Kunz helped with the organization and preservation of the library of William Pryor Letchworth when the society took over the management of his estate in New York. In 1907, it was stated: &quot;The library embraces one of the finest, if not the finest, private collection of books on charities in the country. It contains also a good collection of local histories, books about Indians, and a miscellaneous assortment of standard literature. His mementos - personal gifts and testimonials - are extremely interesting. It is most desirable that these should be kept together and adequately-preserved in a new library building, as part of the monument to the generous donor of Letchworth Park.&quot;

Further, Dr. Kunz helped with the 1910 memorial to Mary Jemison, &quot;The White Indian of the Genesee&quot;, who is buried at &quot;the ancient Indian Council House of the Senecas&quot; located on the grounds of the Letchworth park.

Letchworth, having earned &quot;life-residence&quot; at the Glen Iris, died there on December 1, 1910. He was buried in Buffalo at Forest Lawn Cemetery.

The park was the beneficiary of numerous enhancements enacted by workers from the Civilian Conservation Corps, who inhabited a large camp at the park during the 1930s. Improvements enacted by the CCC included the construction of cabins, overlooks, bridges and trails.

===Old Portageville Bridge Fire===
The Erie Railroad Company built a wooden trestle bridge over the Genesee River just above the Upper Falls. Construction started on July 1, 1851, and the bridge opened on August 16, 1852. At the time, it was the longest and tallest wooden bridge in the world.

In the early morning hours of Thursday, May 6, 1875, the great wooden railroad bridge was destroyed in a tremendous fire. The bridge was a total loss, leaving only the concrete bridge abutments.

Immediately after the Portage Bridge fire, officials of the Erie Railroad Company moved quickly to replace the wooden bridge with an iron design. Construction began on June 8, 1875, and the Portage Viaduct opened for traffic on July 31, 1875: an incredible construction feat for that or any other time.

===Flood of 1972===
One of the greatest natural disasters in Genesee Valley history took place in June 1972. Hurricane Agnes came ashore on the Florida Panhandle on June 19, 1972, and moved north through Georgia and South Carolina. The hurricane then went out to sea via North Carolina, recharged its energy and hit the Southern Tier of New York State on June 22, 1972.

Although Agnes was only a Category 1 hurricane, it soon stalled over North Central Pennsylvania. Caught up in a slow moving low pressure system, the storm drifted slowly northeastward into New York State. The area, having already been soaked by showers the week before, could not absorb the rainfall that fell over Pennsylvania and New York. Known locally as the Flood of &#x27;72, the event had a tremendous impact on Western New York and Letchworth Park.

Although the Genesee River and Letchworth Park was not hit as hard as the Susquehanna Valley and other areas, the impact of the flood was felt in the park for many years. The Lower Falls Bridge and trail to Sugar Loaf did not officially reopen for several years. Visitors can still see some of the natural scars left by the flood waters more than 50 years ago.

Video footage of the devastation can be viewed upon request at the William Pryor Letchworth Museum, located near the Glen Iris Inn.

<doc id="75268" wikidata="Q1426269" url="?curid=75268" title="The Ox-Bow Incident">
<text>The Ox-Bow Incident is a 1943 American Western film directed by William A. Wellman, starring Henry Fonda, Dana Andrews and Mary Beth Hughes, with Anthony Quinn, William Eythe, Harry Morgan and Jane Darwell. Two cowboys arrive in a Western town, when news arrives that a local rancher has been murdered and his cattle stolen. The townspeople, joined by the two cowboys and cowboys from other ranches, form a posse to catch the perpetrators. They find three men in possession of the cattle, and are determined to see justice done on the spot.

The film premiered in May 1943 to positive reviews from critics. It is one of a select group of films to secure just one Oscar nomination, albeit in the Best Picture category. As of 2024, it is the last film to be nominated solely in that category. &quot;The Ox-Bow Incident&quot; and &quot;The Outlaw&quot; (also produced in 1943) are the earliest films in the AllMovie list of psychological Westerns.

In 1998, the film was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant&quot;. The film was adapted from the 1940 novel of the same name, written by Nevadan Walter Van Tilburg Clark.

==Plot==
In Bridger&#x27;s Wells, Nevada in 1885, two cowboys, Art Croft and Gil Carter, hitch up their horses and enter Darby&#x27;s Saloon. There, it is learned that a rancher, Larry Kinkaid, has been murdered. The townspeople immediately form a large posse to pursue the murderers. Art and Gil join. Davies, fearing a lynching, also joins, hoping he can prevent such an occurrence. Major Tetley, dressed in an old Civil War uniform, assumes leadership. His son, Gerald, comes with him. Soon, news arrives that three men with cattle bearing Kinkaid&#x27;s brand have just entered Bridger&#x27;s Pass.

Later that night in Ox-Bow Canyon, the posse find three men sleeping, with what are presumed to be stolen cattle nearby. The posse interrogate them: a young, well-spoken man, Donald Martin; a Mexican, Juan Martínez; and an old man, Alva Hardwicke, who is clearly a senile elderly man. Martin claims that he purchased the cattle from Kinkaid but received no bill of sale. No one believes Martin, and the posse decide to hang the three men at sunrise. As a final request, Martin writes a letter to his wife and asks Davies to deliver it. When dissent develops among some members of the group, a vote is taken on whether to hang the trio or take them to town to stand trial. Only seven vote for the latter. The rest support a hanging.

After the lynching, the posse returns to Bridger&#x27;s Wells. On the way, they encounter the town&#x27;s sheriff, Risley, who reveals Kinkaid is not dead and that the men who shot him have been arrested. Risley then asks Davies who is responsible for the lynching. “All but seven,” Davies replies, and the sheriff angrily declares, “God better have mercy on you. You won&#x27;t get any from me.” Later, the posse gather in Darby&#x27;s Saloon. In silence, they listen as Gil quietly reads Martin&#x27;s letter aloud to Art. Meanwhile, Major Tetley returns to his house, locks his son out, and commits suicide. In the end, Gil and Art head out of town to deliver the letter and $500 raised by those in the posse for Martin&#x27;s wife.

==Cast==
==Production==
Director William A. Wellman loved the novel and wanted to adapt it into a film and then interested Darryl F. Zanuck in producing it. Zanuck agreed in producing the story, on the condition that Wellman would also direct two other films for the studio, &quot;Thunder Birds&quot; (1942) and &quot;Buffalo Bill&quot; (1944).

There are several differences between the film and the novel, notably the fate of the Tetleys and the fate of the lynch mob. In the book, young Gerald commits suicide by hanging himself in the barn. This leads his father to fall on his cavalry sword. The sheriff stares down each member of the mob, but then he says he will forget everything.

The role of Gil Carter, played by Henry Fonda, was originally offered to Gary Cooper, who turned it down. Fonda was generally unhappy with the quality of the films he was cast in while under contract with 20th Century Fox. This was one of only two films from that period that he was enthusiastic about acting in (the other was &quot;The Grapes of Wrath&quot;, made in 1940). Fonda regarded this film as one of his favorites.

Filming was done from late June to early August 1942, mostly in studio back-lots and sound stages; a limited amount of location shooting was done at a ranch in Chatsworth and in Lone Pine, both in California. Additional sequences and retakes were done mid-August to late August. 
The production on the film would be shut down for a week or ten days &quot;due to the $5,000-per-film limit on new construction materials&quot; imposed by the War Production Board. During the shutdown, already used sets were torn down so their materials could be used to build the mountain pass set. Studio publicity noted that the Ox-Bow Valley setting was &quot;the largest set ever constructed&quot; by Fox, covering .

The western street set seen in this film was subsequently used in another western, &quot;The Gunfighter&quot; (1950), which starred Gregory Peck.

After the film was completed, it was kept on the shelf for months because Fox executives were uncertain how to market a film with such a sobering theme.

==Reception==
The film received mostly positive reviews. Bosley Crowther of &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote that it &quot;is not a picture which will brighten or cheer your day. But it is one which, for sheer, stark drama, is currently hard to beat.&quot; &quot;Variety&quot; called it a &quot;powerful preachment against mob lynching ... Director William Wellman has skillfully guided the characters and driven home the point that hanging is unwarranted. Fonda measures up to star rating ... He helps hold together the loose ends of the rather patent plot.&quot; David Lardner of &quot;The New Yorker&quot; called it a &quot;rather good piece of work&quot;. &quot;Harrison&#x27;s Reports&quot; printed a negative review, calling it a &quot;depressing, unpleasant, at times horrible, melodrama ... Whoever is responsible for selecting such sordid material for the screen should be awarded a &#x27;booby&#x27; prize.&quot;
More recently, &quot;La Furia Umana&quot;″s Toshi Fujiwara said the film is &quot;one of the most important westerns in the history of American cinema&quot;.
Clint Eastwood has stated this is his favorite film.
However, Darryl F. Zanuck, head of Twentieth Century-Fox 1935–1956, recalled the film as &quot;a flop. In spite of its significance and its dramatic value, our records showed that it had failed to pay its way. In fact, its pulling power was less than that of a Laurel and Hardy comedy we made about the same time.&quot;

It earned $750,000 in the United States.

==Awards and honors==

The film was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Picture at the 16th Academy Awards, losing to &quot;Casablanca&quot;. As of 2024, it is the last film to have been nominated for Best Picture and nothing else.

An outdoor mural at Twentieth Century Fox Studios, Century City, depicts the filming of &quot;The Ox-Bow Incident&quot;.

<text>The Outlaw Josey Wales is a 1976 American revisionist Western film set during and after the American Civil War. It was directed by and starred Clint Eastwood (as Josey Wales), with Chief Dan George, Sondra Locke, Bill McKinney, and John Vernon. During the Civil War, Josey Wales is a Missouri farmer turned soldier, who seeks to avenge the death of his family and gains a reputation as a feared gunfighter. At the end of the war, his group surrenders, but is massacred, and Wales becomes an outlaw, pursued by bounty hunters and soldiers.

The film was adapted by Sonia Chernus and Philip Kaufman from author Asa Earl &quot;Forrest&quot; Carter&#x27;s 1972 novel &quot;The Rebel Outlaw: Josey Wales&quot; (republished, as shown in the movie&#x27;s opening credits, as &quot;Gone to Texas&quot;). The film was a commercial success, earning $31.8 million against a $3.7 million budget. In 1996, the film was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant&quot;.

Josey Wales was portrayed by Michael Parks in the film&#x27;s 1986 sequel, &quot;The Return of Josey Wales&quot;. His wife Laura Lee was played by Mary Ann Averett in the sequel.

==Plot==

During the American Civil War, the wife and son of Missouri farmer Josey Wales are murdered by pro-Union paramilitaries led by the brutal Captain Terrill. After burying their corpses, Wales seeks vengeance for his family by joining a group of Confederate bushwhackers under the command of William T. Anderson, attacking the Union Army and pro-Union sympathizers. After the war ends in 1865, Wales&#x27; superior, Captain Fletcher, persuades his men to surrender, having been promised amnesty by Union General Jim Lane. However, Terrill&#x27;s men massacre the bushwhackers after they surrender, with Wales, Fletcher, and fellow bushwhacker Jamie being the only survivors. Wales and Jamie flee, and Lane forces Fletcher to assist Terrill in hunting them down. A mortally wounded Jamie helps Wales kill two bounty hunters before dying.

With a $5,000 bounty on his head, Wales flees to Texas. He meets elderly Cherokee man Lone Watie on the way, who informs Wales that Confederate General Joseph O. Shelby is fleeing to Mexico and suggests they do likewise. Wales subsequently rescues young Navajo woman Little Moonlight and kills another bounty hunter. Alongside Little Moonlight, Wales also rescues an elderly Kansan woman Sarah Turner and her granddaughter Laura Lee from marauding Comancheros. At the town of Santo Rio, two employees of Turner&#x27;s dead son Tom, Travis and Chato, also join the group. Wales and his companions find Tom&#x27;s abandoned ranch and settle down there. Discovering that Travis and Chato have been kidnapped by Comanche chief Ten Bears, Wales rides into his camp and negotiates the return of the two men; an impressed Ten Bears becomes blood brothers with Wales.

A bounty hunter whose partner was killed by Wales at Santo Rio guides Terrill and his men to the town. On the following morning, Terrill&#x27;s men launch a surprise attack on the ranch, but Wales&#x27; companions manage to gun them all down. A wounded and ammunitionless Wales follows the fleeing Terrill back to Santo Rio, where he corners him. A wounded Terrill attempts to draw his sabre, but Wales grabs his hand and forces the blade through Terrill&#x27;s chest, killing him. Returning to the town saloon, Wales discovers its patrons telling Fletcher, accompanied by two Texas Rangers, that an outlaw named Josey Wales was recently killed in Monterrey by five gunmen. The Rangers accept the story and leave, while Fletcher pretends not to recognize Wales, and tells him he will go to Mexico himself to look for Wales and tell him the war is over. Wales responds by stating, &quot;I reckon so. I guess we all died a little in that damned war&quot; before riding off into the sunset.

==Production==

&quot;The Outlaw Josey Wales&quot; was inspired by a 1972 novel by supposedly Cherokee writer Forrest Carter, alias of former KKK leader and segregationist speech writer of George Wallace, Asa Earl Carter, an identity that was exposed in part due to the success of the film, and was originally titled &quot;The Rebel Outlaw: Josey Wales&quot; and later retitled &quot;Gone to Texas&quot;. The script was worked on by Sonia Chernus and producer Robert Daley at Malpaso, and Eastwood himself paid some of the money to obtain the screen rights. Michael Cimino and Philip Kaufman later oversaw the writing of the script, aiding Chernus. Kaufman wanted the film to stay as close to the novel as possible in style and retained many of the mannerisms in Wales&#x27;s character that Eastwood would display on screen, such as his distinctive diction with words like &quot;reckon&quot;, &quot;hoss&quot; (instead of &quot;horse&quot;), and &quot;ye&quot; (instead of &quot;you&quot;), and spitting tobacco juice on animals and victims. The characters of Wales, the Cherokee chief, Navajo woman, and the old settler woman and her daughter all appeared in the novel. On the other hand, Kaufman was less happy with the novel&#x27;s political stance; he felt that it had been &quot;written by a crude fascist&quot; and that &quot;the man&#x27;s hatred of government was insane&quot;. He also felt that element of the script needed to be severely toned down, but he later said, &quot;Clint didn&#x27;t, and it was his film&quot;. Kaufman was later fired by Eastwood, who took over the film&#x27;s direction himself.

Cinematographer Bruce Surtees, James Fargo, and Fritz Manes scouted for locations and eventually found sites in Page, Arizona, Tucson, Arizona, Kanab, Utah, and Oroville, California even before they saw the final script. The movie was shot in DeLuxe Color and Panavision. Kaufman cast Chief Dan George, who had been nominated for an Academy Award for Supporting Actor in &quot;Little Big Man&quot;, as the old Cherokee Lone Watie. Sondra Locke, also a previous Academy Award nominee, was cast by Eastwood against Kaufman&#x27;s wishes as Laura Lee, the granddaughter of the old settler woman; at 32, she was a decade older than the character. This marked the beginning of a professional and domestic relationship between Eastwood and Locke that would span six films and last into the late 1980s. Ferris Webster was hired as the film&#x27;s editor and Jerry Fielding as composer.

In June 1975, Eastwood was announced as starring in the film, with a scheduled Bicentennial Celebration release. Principal photography began on October 6, 1975. A rift between Eastwood and Kaufman developed during the filming. Kaufman insisted on filming with a meticulous attention to detail, which caused disagreements with Eastwood, not to mention the attraction the two shared towards Locke and apparent jealousy on Kaufman&#x27;s part in regard to their emerging relationship. One evening, Kaufman insisted on finding a beer can as a prop to be used in a scene, but while he was absent, Eastwood ordered Surtees to quickly shoot the scene, as light was fading, and then drove away, leaving before Kaufman had returned. On October 24, 1975, Kaufman was fired at Eastwood&#x27;s command by producer Bob Daley. The sacking caused an outrage among the Directors Guild of America and other important Hollywood executives, since the director had already worked hard on the film, including completing all of the pre-production. Pressure mounted on Warner Bros. and Eastwood to back down, and their refusal to do so resulted in a fine, reported to be around $60,000, for the violation. This resulted in the Director&#x27;s Guild passing a new rule, known as &quot;the Eastwood Rule&quot;, which prohibits an actor or producer from firing the director and then personally taking on the director&#x27;s role. From then on, the film was directed by Eastwood himself with Daley as the second-in-command. With Kaufman&#x27;s planning already in place, the team was able to finish making the film efficiently. Filming ended on December 6, 1975.

==Reception==
===Critical response===
Upon release in August 1976, &quot;The Outlaw Josey Wales&quot; was widely acclaimed by critics, many of whom saw Eastwood&#x27;s role as an iconic one, relating it with much of America&#x27;s ancestral past and the destiny of the nation after the American Civil War. The film was pre-screened at the Sun Valley Center for the Arts and Humanities in Idaho in a six-day conference entitled &quot;Western Movies: Myths and Images&quot;. Academics such as Bruce Jackson, critics such as Jay Cocks and Arthur Knight and directors such as King Vidor, Henry King, William Wyler and Howard Hawks were invited to the screening. &quot;Time&quot; magazine named the film one of the year&#x27;s top 10. Roger Ebert compared the nature and vulnerability of Eastwood&#x27;s portrayal of Josey Wales with his &quot;Man with No Name&quot; character in the Dollars Trilogy and praised the atmosphere of the film. On &quot;The Merv Griffin Show&quot;, Orson Welles lauded the film, calling Eastwood &quot;one of America&#x27;s finest directors&quot;.

Review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes retrospectively gave the film a 91% approval rating based on 44 reviews, with an average score of 8/10. The site&#x27;s critical consensus reads, &quot;Recreating the essence of his iconic Man With No Name in a post-Civil War Western, director Clint Eastwood delivered the first of his great revisionist works of the genre.&quot; The film received a Metacritic rating of 69 based on 9 reviews.

===Awards===
&quot;The Outlaw Josey Wales&quot; was nominated for the Academy Award for Original Music Score. In 1996, it was deemed &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant&quot; by the United States Library of Congress and selected for preservation in the National Film Registry. It was also one of the few Western films to receive critical and commercial success in the 1970s at a time when the Western was thought to be dying as a major genre in Hollywood.

Clint Eastwood says on the 1999 DVD release that the movie is &quot;certainly one of the high points of my career... in the Western genre of filmmaking&quot;.

==Meaning==
In 2011, Eastwood called &quot;The Outlaw Josey Wales&quot; an anti-war film.
As for Josey Wales, I saw the parallels to the modern day at that time. Everybody gets tired of it, but it never ends. A war is a horrible thing, but it&#x27;s also a unifier of countries... Man becomes his most creative during war. Look at the amount of weaponry that was made in four short years of World War II—the amount of ships and guns and tanks and inventions and planes and P-38s and P-51s, and just the urgency and the camaraderie, and the unifying. But that&#x27;s kind of a sad statement on mankind, if that&#x27;s what it takes.

<text>Pass the Gravy is a 1928 short comedy silent film directed by Fred Guiol and supervised by Leo McCarey. It stars Max Davidson, Gene Morgan, Spec O&#x27;Donnell, Martha Sleeper, and Bert Sprotte. The movie was produced by Hal Roach and distributed by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Distributing Corporation. In 1998, the film was deemed &quot;culturally significant&quot; by the Library of Congress and selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry.

==Plot==
Schultz is proud of his prize-winning rooster, Brigham. Davidson, who lives next door, raises flowers and has a son named Ignatz. Schultz&#x27;s son has just become engaged to Davidson&#x27;s daughter. Although the two fathers don&#x27;t get along, their children&#x27;s engagement seems like a good time to bury the hatchet. A celebration dinner is planned and Ignatz is given two dollars to go purchase a chicken. But Ignatz, wanting to keep the money for himself, takes Brigham instead. When the families gather together to eat the chicken, Ignatz realizes that he left Brigham&#x27;s 1st Prize tag on the now cooked leg. Gradually, they all realize the chicken is Brigham, everyone, except the two fathers, Schultz and Davidson. Ignatz runs away from home, but not before having an ambulance &quot;stand by&quot; for emergencies. The engaged couple pantomime the truth to Davidson who after a scuffle runs away too.

The engaged couple&#x27;s pantomine efforts become increasingly frantic, and include the woman &quot;laying an egg&quot; and the man mussing his hair and impersonating a rooster. When Davidson catches on, a game of &quot;keepaway&#x27; develops with the incriminating drumstick; including forward passes and flying tackles.

<text>Interstate 95 (I-95) is the main north–south Interstate Highway on the East Coast of the United States, running from U.S. Route 1 (US 1) in Miami, Florida, north to the Houlton–Woodstock Border Crossing between Maine and the Canadian province of New Brunswick. The highway largely parallels the Atlantic coast and US 1, except for the portion between Savannah, Georgia, and Washington, D.C., and the portion between Portland and Houlton in Maine, both of which follow a more direct inland route.

I-95 serves as the principal road link between the major cities of the Eastern Seaboard. Major metropolitan areas along its route include Miami, Jacksonville, and Savannah in the Southeast; Richmond, Washington, Baltimore, Wilmington–Philadelphia, Newark, and New York City in the Mid-Atlantic; and New Haven, Providence, Boston, and Portland in New England. The Charleston, Wilmington, and Norfolk–Virginia Beach metropolitan areas, the three major coastal metros bypassed by the highway&#x27;s inland portion, are connected to I-95 by I-26, I-40, and I-64, respectively.

I-95 is one of the oldest routes of the Interstate Highway System. Many sections of I-95 incorporated preexisting sections of toll roads where they served the same right-of-way. Until 2018, there was a gap in I-95&#x27;s original routing in Central New Jersey caused by the cancelation of the Somerset Freeway. An interchange between the Pennsylvania Turnpike and I-95 was completed September 22, 2018; this allowed I-95 to be rerouted along the Pearl Harbor Memorial Turnpike Extension of the New Jersey Turnpike into Pennsylvania, creating a continuous Interstate route from Maine to Florida for the first time.

With a length of , I-95 is the longest north–south Interstate and the sixth-longest Interstate Highway overall. I-95 passes through 15 states (as well as a brief stretch in the District of Columbia while crossing the Potomac River), more than any other Interstate. According to the US Census Bureau, only five of the 96 counties or county equivalents along its route are completely rural, while statistics provided by the I-95 Corridor Coalition suggest that the region served is &quot;over three times more densely populated than the U.S. average and as densely settled as much of Western Europe&quot;. According to the Corridor Coalition, I-95 serves 110 million people and facilitates 40 percent of the country&#x27;s gross domestic product.

===South===
====Florida====
I-95 begins at US 1 just south of downtown Miami and travels along the state&#x27;s east coast, passing through Fort Lauderdale, West Palm Beach, the Gold Coast, the Treasure Coast, the Space Coast, Daytona Beach, Port Orange, St. Augustine, and Jacksonville before entering the US state of Georgia near the city of Kingsland. In Miami and Fort Lauderdale, SunPass express lanes pass over the highway.

Before 1987, a notable gap in the highway existed between West Palm Beach and Fort Pierce; I-95 traffic between those cities was diverted to Florida&#x27;s Turnpike. Today, I-95 runs along a routing parallel to the turnpike.

In 2010, more fatalities occurred along the Florida section of I-95 than on any other Interstate Highway in the country.

====Georgia====
In Georgia, I-95 closely parallels the coastline, traveling primarily through marshlands a few miles from the shore. The route bypasses the cores of major coastal cities Brunswick and Savannah, routing traffic through the western sides of both cities&#x27; metro areas; it connects to the latter city by an intersection with I-16 before crossing into South Carolina. The exit numbers were converted from a sequential system to a mileage-based system around 2000. I-95 in Georgia has the unsigned designation of State Route 405 (SR 405).

==== South Carolina ====
Entering South Carolina, I-95 diverts from its coastal route to a more inland route to the west. I-95 does not go near any major cities in South Carolina, with the largest city along its route being Florence, the tenth largest in the state. The rest of South Carolina can be accessed via other Interstates that intersect I-95. It intersects I-26 near Harleyville, which provides access to Charleston, Columbia, and Upstate South Carolina. It also intersects I-20 at Florence, which also connects to Columbia and then on to Atlanta, Georgia. At the North Carolina border, I-95 passes the South of the Border roadside attraction.

==== North Carolina ====
In North Carolina, I-95 informally serves as the separation between the state&#x27;s central Piedmont and eastern Atlantic Plain regions. Much like its route in South Carolina, I-95 runs through mostly rural areas, avoiding major cities like Raleigh and Durham. The route intersects I-74 near Lumberton, I-40 near Benson, and Future I-87/US 64 near Rocky Mount. Several medium-sized cities lie along I-95 in North Carolina, including (from south to north) Fayetteville, Wilson, and Rocky Mount. At Gaston, I-95 crosses into Virginia.

===Mid-Atlantic region===

Much of I-95 in the Mid-Atlantic region is tolled, following the course of several turnpikes that predate the Interstate Highway System, as well as several other toll roads and toll bridges.

==== Virginia ====
I-95 enters the Mid-Atlantic region in Virginia and travels through the center of the densest and most populous urban region in the US. I-95 travels north–south through Virginia, passing through Petersburg, and follows the Richmond–Petersburg Turnpike into downtown Richmond (where it is concurrent briefly with I-64), and, from there, it turns northeast as it enters Northern Virginia. In the Washington metropolitan area, it is concurrent with the Capital Beltway from the Springfield Interchange along with I-495, before passing through the southernmost corner of the District of Columbia for about along the Woodrow Wilson Bridge before entering Maryland near National Harbor, Maryland.

==== Maryland ====

In Maryland, I-95 goes northeast toward Baltimore, paralleling the older Baltimore–Washington Parkway. I-95 uses the Fort McHenry Tunnel to travel under Baltimore&#x27;s Inner Harbor and travels through northeast Maryland along the John F. Kennedy Memorial Highway, crossing into Delaware near Elkton.

==== Delaware ====
Entering Delaware at Newark, I-95 follows the Delaware Turnpike east across Delaware until the large and complex I-495/I-295/US 202/Delaware Route 141 interchange near Newport and turns northeast through Wilmington, skirting the west side of the downtown area before leaving Delaware in Claymont at the state&#x27;s extreme northeastern corner. I-95 is the only two-digit interstate highway in Delaware, and it only passes through the Twelve-Mile Circle, the northernmost part of the state.

==== Pennsylvania ====
Entering southeastern Pennsylvania near Marcus Hook, I-95 crosses Delaware County and the city of Chester, closely following the Delaware River. Entering Philadelphia near Philadelphia International Airport, the freeway has an interchange with I-76 before it follows a large viaduct along the extreme eastern edge of Center City Philadelphia. Northeast of Philadelphia in Bucks County, I-95 joins the Pennsylvania Turnpike near Bristol before entering New Jersey on the Delaware River–Turnpike Toll Bridge.

==== New Jersey ====

I-95 follows a course in New Jersey, starting in the south at the Pearl Harbor Memorial Turnpike Extension of the New Jersey Turnpike, crossing the Delaware River on the Delaware River–Turnpike Toll Bridge, joining the mainline turnpike at exit 6. I-95 has interchanges with I-78 in Newark and I-80 in southern Teaneck. At the northern end of the turnpike in Fort Lee, I-95 turns southeast and crosses over the Hudson River into New York City via the George Washington Bridge.

==== New York ====
I-95 in New York City comprises all or part of several named expressways, including the Trans-Manhattan, Cross Bronx, and Bruckner expressways, as it crosses east-northeast across the boroughs of Manhattan and the Bronx. Within this stretch, I-95 intersects I-87 in the South Bronx, which connects to Albany and Upstate New York, as well as several auxiliary Interstates that provide access to other New York City boroughs and to Long Island. Entering Westchester County in Pelham, I-95 then follows the New England Thruway northeast to the Connecticut border at Port Chester, where it continues as the Connecticut Turnpike.

===New England===
====Connecticut====

I-95 enters New England in the state of Connecticut, where it closely follows the state&#x27;s southern coast. The highway&#x27;s direction through Connecticut is primarily east–west, and it passes through the most densely populated part of the state, including the cities of Stamford, Bridgeport (the state&#x27;s most populous city), and New Haven. In New Haven, it intersects with I-91 as it passes into the more rural areas of the Lower Connecticut River Valley. I-95 leaves the Connecticut Turnpike at I-395 at the East Lyme–Waterford town line. I-95 next passes New London and Groton, before the route curves northeast and leaving its close connection to the coast. It leaves Connecticut in the town of North Stonington.

==== Rhode Island ====
I-95 enters Rhode Island in the town of Hopkinton and connects the rural areas of the southwestern corner of the state with the more metropolitan region around the state capital, Providence, in the state&#x27;s northeastern corner. It leaves Rhode Island in the city of Pawtucket.

==== Massachusetts ====
Entering Massachusetts in Attleboro, I-95 heads northeast toward Boston. In Canton, roughly south of Boston&#x27;s city limits, it turns to the west and begins a concurrency with Route 128, a beltway that traverses Boston&#x27;s inner suburbs. At this point, I-93 has its southern terminus and provides access to the city of Boston itself. I-95 intersects the Massachusetts Turnpike/I-90 at the Weston–Newton line and I-93 a second time at the tripoint of Woburn, Reading, and Stoneham. North of Boston, I-95 leaves the beltway and heads northward in Peabody, while Route 128 continues east to Cape Ann. I-95 leaves Massachusetts in Salisbury.

==== New Hampshire ====
I-95 enters New Hampshire in the town of Seabrook, following the pre-Interstate New Hampshire Turnpike and traversing the Seacoast Region and the historic city of Portsmouth where it leaves the state. I-95 in New Hampshire is the shortest section of the highway (excluding D.C.).

==== Maine ====
In Maine, I-95 follows the Maine Turnpike, closely following the coast in a northeasterly direction until reaching Portland, the state&#x27;s largest city. From there, it turns northward to Augusta, where the Maine Turnpike ends while I-95 continues north to Palmyra, where it turns east to Bangor. From Bangor, it turns north again to Smyrna and makes a final turn to the east, reaching the Houlton–Woodstock Border Crossing in Houlton. The road continues into the Canadian province of New Brunswick as Route 95.

==History==
Many parts of I-95 were made up of toll roads that had already been constructed or planned, particularly in the northeast. Many of these routes still exist today, but some have removed their tolls. All current I-95 toll facilities are compatible with the E-ZPass electronic payment system; in Florida, while I-95 can be driven toll-free, use of the &quot;95 Express Managed Toll Lanes&quot; requires a SunPass transponder (E-ZPass is now compatible with SunPass).

The toll roads utilized as part of I-95 formerly included Florida&#x27;s Turnpike, the Richmond–Petersburg Turnpike (tolled until 1992), and the Connecticut Turnpike (tolled until 1985). Additionally, the Fuller Warren Bridge, spanning the St. Johns River in Jacksonville, was tolled until the 1980s. Today, tolls remain on Maryland&#x27;s Fort McHenry Tunnel and John F. Kennedy Memorial Highway, the Delaware Turnpike, the Pennsylvania Turnpike, the New Jersey Turnpike, New York&#x27;s George Washington Bridge and New England Thruway, the New Hampshire Turnpike, and the Maine Turnpike.

By 1968, three states had completed their sections of I-95: Connecticut, using its existing turnpikes; New York; and Delaware.

===21st century===

Until 2018, a gap existed on I-95 within New Jersey. From Pennsylvania, I-95 entered the state on the Scudder Falls Bridge and continued east to US 1 in Lawrence Township. Here, I-95 abruptly ended and transitioned into I-295. From New York, I-95 entered the state on the George Washington Bridge and followed the New Jersey Turnpike south to exit 6, ran along an extension of the turnpike, and ended on the Delaware River–Turnpike Toll Bridge at the Pennsylvania state line, where the route transitioned into I-276. This discontinuity was caused by the 1983 cancelation of the Somerset Freeway, a planned alignment of I-95 further inland from the turnpike. In order to close the gap, an interchange was constructed where I-95 crosses the Pennsylvania Turnpike in Bristol Township, Pennsylvania. After the first components of the interchange opened on September 22, 2018, I-95 was rerouted onto the Pennsylvania Turnpike, meeting up with where I-95 previously ended at the state line. This project closed the last remaining gap in the route. The former section of I-95 between the Pennsylvania Turnpike and US 1 in Lawrence became an extension of I-295. The interchange with the Pennsylvania Turnpike will be expanded in the future, connecting northbound I-95 with the westbound turnpike and the eastbound turnpike with southbound I-95.

In the 21st century, several large projects between Richmond, Virginia, and New Jersey have aimed to decrease congestion along the corridor. The reconstruction of the Springfield Interchange in Northern Virginia, just outside Washington, D.C. helped to ease traffic at the intersection of I-95, I-495, and I-395, and surrounding interchanges. The Springfield Interchange is one of the busiest highway junctions on the East Coast, serving between 400,000 and 500,000 vehicles per day. With the exception of high-occupancy toll (HOT) lanes on the Capital Beltway (I-495/I-95), this project was completed in July 2007. A few miles to the east was another major project: the Woodrow Wilson Bridge replacement. The bridge carries I-95/I-495 over the Potomac River. The former Woodrow Wilson Bridge, which has since been demolished, was a six-lane bridge that was severely overcapacity. The new bridge is actually two bridges with a total of 12 lanes; five in each direction, with an additional lane in each direction for future use (rapid-bus or train). This project was completed with the 10 lanes opened on December 13, 2008, greatly reducing the traffic delays on the beltway. The lanes are divided into two through lanes and three local lanes in each direction. About north of the Wilson Bridge, and about south of Baltimore near Laurel, Maryland, construction on a large new interchange began in 2008, was scheduled for completion in late 2011, and opened to traffic on November 9, 2014, which connects I-95 to Maryland Route 200 (MD 200).

In 2006, the Virginia General Assembly passed SJ184, a resolution calling for an interstate compact to build a toll highway between Dover, Delaware, and Charleston, South Carolina, as an alternative to I-95 that would allow long-distance traffic to avoid the Washington metropolitan area.

Federal legislation has identified I-95 through Connecticut as High Priority Corridor 65. A long-term multibillion-dollar program to upgrade the entire length of I-95 through Connecticut has been underway since the mid-1990s and is expected to continue through at least 2020. Several miles of the Connecticut Turnpike through Bridgeport were widened and brought up to Interstate standards. Work has shifted to reconstructing and widening of I-95 through New Haven, which includes replacing the Pearl Harbor Memorial Bridge. Environmental studies for reconstructing and widening of I-95 from New Haven to the Rhode Island state line are also progressing.

There are plans to expand the I-95 corridor from Petersburg, Virginia, to Florida through a US multistate agreement to study how to improve the corridor through widening and reconstruction, with the goal of reducing congestion and improving overall safety for years to come.

I-95 from the South Carolina–Georgia line to the freeway&#x27;s southern terminus in South Florida has been widened to a minimum of six lanes. The section from Jacksonville to the I-4 junction in Daytona Beach was expanded to six lanes in 2005. Projects begun in 2009, widening the roadbed in Brevard County from the State Route 528 junction in Cocoa to Palm Bay, as well as in northern Palm Beach County. The last segments of I-95 in Florida to remain at only four lanes have now been upgraded, providing motorists with about of continuous six-lane roadbed.

In 2009, state legislators representing Maine&#x27;s Aroostook County proposed using federal economic stimulus funds to extend I-95 north to Maine&#x27;s northernmost border community of Fort Kent via Caribou and Presque Isle. The proposed route would parallel New Brunswick&#x27;s four-lane, limited-access Trans-Canada Highway on the US side of the Canadian border. Legislators argued that extension of the Interstate would promote economic growth in the region.

On June 11, 2023, a portion of the northbound section of I-95 collapsed in Philadelphia. This was due to a gasoline tanker catching fire after a crash. A temporary roadway opened at the site of the collapsed bridge ten days later, on June 23, 2023.

<doc id="75282" wikidata="Q1496479" url="?curid=75282" title="Thelypteridaceae">
<text>Thelypteridaceae is a family of about 900 species of ferns in the order Polypodiales. In the Pteridophyte Phylogeny Group classification of 2016 (PPG I), it is placed in the suborder Aspleniineae. Alternatively, the family may be submerged in a very broadly defined family Aspleniaceae as the subfamily Thelypteridoideae.

The ferns are terrestrial, with the exception of a few which are lithophytes (grow on rocks). The bulk of the species are tropical, although there are a number of temperate species.

These ferns typically have creeping rhizomes. The fronds are simply pinnate to pinnate-pinnatifid. There is either no frond dimorphism or only mild dimorphism, either open venation or very simple anastomosing. The sori are mostly reniform in shape and have indusia, except for the &quot;Phegopteris&quot; group.

== Classification ==
During the early and mid 1900&#x27;s all thelypterioid ferns were included in the genus &quot;Dryopteris&quot; because of the sorus shape. However, there are a great many differences between the groups, and these plants are now segregated in their own family. Genetic evidence shows that the family is clearly monophyletic.

===Phylogenetic relationships===
The following cladogram for the suborder Aspleniineae (as eupolypods II), based on Lehtonen (2011), and Rothfels &amp; al. (2012), shows a likely phylogenetic relationship between the Thelypteridaceae and the other families of the clade.
===Genera===
The family can be divided into two major clades, which the Pteridophyte Phylogeny Group classification of 2016 (PPG I) recognizes as two subfamilies, Phegopteridoideae and Thelypteroideae. Their division into genera has been described as &quot;highly controversial and fluctuating&quot;. The family includes several complexes of species that are difficult to distinguish, and seem to represent a remarkable evolutionary radiation. Some researchers include the entire family Thelypteridaceae in the genus &quot;Thelypteris&quot;; others divide the family into as many as 30 genera. An intermediate position is to place the bulk in &quot;Thelypteris&quot; (which can then be divided into subgenera and sections corresponding to the genera of other authors) but to separate out &quot;Phegopteris&quot; and &quot;Macrothelypteris&quot;. Another choice is to divide the family into a half a dozen or so genera.

The Pteridophyte Phylogeny Group classification of 2016 (PPG I) accepts 30 genera:
*Subfamily Phegopteridoideae 
**&quot;Macrothelypteris&quot; 
**&quot;Phegopteris&quot; 
**&quot;Pseudophegopteris&quot; 
*Subfamily Thelypteridoideae 
**&quot;Steiropteris&quot; 
**Tribe Thelypterideae 
***&quot;Thelypteris&quot; 
**Tribe Amauropelteae 
***&quot;Amauropelta&quot; 
***&quot;Coryphopteris&quot; 
***&quot;Metathelypteris&quot; 
**Tribe Oreopterideae 
***&quot;Oreopteris&quot; 
**Tribe Leptogrammeae 
***&quot;Cyclogramma&quot; 
***&quot;Leptogramma&quot; 
***&quot;Stegnogramma&quot; 
**Tribe Meniscieae 
***Subtribe Goniopteridinae 
****&quot;Goniopteris&quot; 
***Subtribe Menisciinae 
****&quot;Ampelopteris&quot; 
****&quot;Cyclosorus&quot; 
****&quot;Meniscium&quot; 
****&quot;Mesophlebion&quot; 
***Subtribe Pseudocyclosorinae 
****&quot;Abacopteris&quot; 
****&quot;Amblovenatum&quot; 
****&quot;Chingia&quot; 
****&quot;Christella&quot; 
****&quot;Glaphyropteridopsis&quot; 
****&quot;Grypothrix&quot; 
****&quot;Menisciopsis&quot; 
****&quot;Menisorus&quot; 
****&quot;Mesopteris&quot; 
****&quot;Pakau&quot; 
****&quot;Parathelypteris&quot; 
****&quot;Pelazoneuron&quot; 
****&quot;Plesioneuron&quot; 
****&quot;Pneumatopteris&quot; 
****&quot;Pronephrium&quot; [&quot;Nannothelypteris&quot; ]
****&quot;Pseudocyclosorus&quot; 
****&quot;Reholttumia&quot; 
****&quot;Sphaerostephanos&quot; 
****&quot;Strophocaulon&quot; 
****&quot;Trigonospora&quot; 
Some species of &quot;Pronephrium&quot; were split off into other genera in 2021 as a result of a phylogenetic study of the family Thelypteridaceae:
*&quot;Abacopteris&quot; 
*&quot;Grypothrix&quot; 
*&quot;Menisciopsis&quot; 

The extinct genus &quot;Holttumopteris&quot; from the Cenomanian aged Burmese amber has been suggested to have affinities with the family, but several important diagnostic characters are not preserved.

<text>A [[landscape architect]] is someone who practices landscape architecture. Regulations of the profession vary by country and state. The terminology has evolved to include those once known as landscape gardeners, landscape or garden designers, architects, surveyors, or civil engineers. In particular, this includes people from the 19th century who practiced before the term &quot;landscape architect&quot; was coined.

Landscape architecture was also differentiated as a profession in the United States earlier than other parts of the world, but this ambiguity has persisted to the present day. In much of Europe, for example, landscape architecture is not a distinct profession; but there are many significant historical and contemporary examples of &quot;landscape architectural design&quot; projects.

Though their influence on landscape architecture may be great, this list precludes gardeners, botanists, writers, theoreticians, ecologists, artists, and others who did not practice landscape design at a site scale and were not trained as a historical &quot;landscape gardener&quot; or contemporary &quot;landscape architect.&quot;

<doc id="75285" wikidata="Q437714" url="?curid=75285" title="Beatrix Farrand">
<text>Beatrix Cadwalader Farrand (née Jones; June 19, 1872 – February 28, 1959) was an American landscape gardener and landscape architect. Her career included commissions to design about 110 gardens for private residences, estates and country homes, public parks, botanic gardens, college campuses, and the White House. Only a few of her major works survive: Dumbarton Oaks in Washington, D.C., the Abby Aldrich Rockefeller Garden on Mount Desert, Maine, the restored Farm House Garden in Bar Harbor, the Peggy Rockefeller Rose Garden at the New York Botanical Garden (constructed after Farrand&#x27;s death, using her original plans, and opened in 1988), and elements of the campuses of Princeton, Yale, and Occidental.

Farrand was one of the founding eleven members, and the only woman, of the American Society of Landscape Architects. Beatrix Farrand is one of the most accomplished persons, and women, recognized in both the first decades of the landscape architecture profession and the centuries of landscape garden design arts and accomplishments.

==Early years==
Beatrix Cadwalader Jones was born in New York City on June 19, 1872, into a family among whom she liked to claim were &quot;five generations of gardeners.&quot; Her mother was Mary Cadwalader Rawle (1850–1923), whose father was lawyer William Henry Rawle (1823–1889). Her father was Frederic Rhinelander Jones (1846–1918), brother of novelist Edith Wharton.

She enjoyed long seasons at the family&#x27;s summer home Reef Point Estate in Mount Desert Island, Maine. She was the niece of Edith Wharton and lifelong friend of Henry James, who called her &#x27;Trix&#x27;. At age twenty, she was introduced to one of her primary mentors, the botanist Charles Sprague Sargent, who at Harvard University was both a professor of horticulture at the Bussey Institute and the founding director of the Arnold Arboretum in Boston, Massachusetts. Sargent named a species, &quot;Crataegus jonesae&quot;, in her honor, as it was she who first noticed it and brought it to his attention.

Farrand lived at Sargent&#x27;s home, Holm Lea in Brookline, Massachusetts, in 1893 and studied landscape gardening, for which there was no specialized school at the time, botany, and land planning. She wanted to learn drafting to scale, elevation rendering, surveying, and engineering, and so studied at the Columbia School of Mines under the direction of Prof. William Ware. She was influenced in using native plant species from: her many successful Reef Point experiences; studying the contemporary books from the U.S. and abroad advocating the advantages of native palettes; and from visiting the influential British garden authors William Robinson at Gravetye Manor in Sussex, and Gertrude Jekyll at Munstead Wood in Surrey. Jekyll&#x27;s series of thematic gardening books emphasized the importance and value of natural plantings and were influential in the U.S.

On December 17, 1913, Beatrix married Max Farrand, the accomplished historian at Stanford and Yale universities, and the first director of the Huntington Library.

==Landscape design career==

She began practicing landscape architecture in 1895, working from the upper floor of her mother&#x27;s brownstone house on East Eleventh Street in New York. Since women were excluded from public projects, her first designs were residential gardens, beginning with some for neighbouring Bar Harbor residents. With the help of her mother and with her aunt Edith Wharton&#x27;s social connections, she was introduced to prominent people, which led to working on a variety of significant projects. Within three years, she was so prominent in her field that she was chosen the only woman among the founders of the American Society of Landscape Architects, although she preferred the British term &quot;landscape gardener&quot;.

Farrand did the initial site and planting planning for the National Cathedral in Washington, D.C., in 1899. In 1912, she designed the walled residential garden, Bellefield, for Mr. and Mrs. Thomas Newbold in Hyde Park, New York (now a part of the Franklin D. Roosevelt National Historic Site). In addition to being the earliest extant example of her residential designs, this exquisite walled garden, now restored, is one of the only known pairings of works by two prominent designers of that era—Farrand and the architects McKim, Mead &amp; White — who remodeled the Newbolds&#x27; eighteenth-century house. She collaborated with the firm of McKim, Mead &amp; White in the construction of service buildings at Dumbarton Oaks.

For the White House, the first Mrs. Woodrow Wilson, Ellen Loise Axson Wilson, had commissioned Beatrix Farrand to design the East Colonial Garden (now redesigned as the Jacqueline Kennedy Garden) and the West Garden (now the redesigned White House Rose Garden) in 1913. After Mrs. Wilson&#x27;s August 1914 death, the project languished until the second Mrs. Wilson, Edith Bolling Galt Wilson, had its installation restarted and completed in 1916. She received the commission from J. Pierpont Morgan to design the grounds of Morgan&#x27;s residence in New York City (later the site of the Morgan Library &amp; Museum), and continued as a consultant for thirty years (1913–43).
Her most notable work was at the Dumbarton Oaks estate in the Georgetown district of Washington, D.C., for Mildred and Robert Woods Bliss (1922–1940). Her design was inspired by her European ventures, especially from the Italian Renaissance gardens, and consisted of establishing a sophisticated relationship between the architectural and natural environments, with formal terraced gardens stepping down a steep slope and transitioning to a more naturalistic aesthetic approaching the creek.

In 1928, her husband accepted the position as the first Director of The Huntington Library (1927–41) in San Marino, California. They moved to California, but Farrand had trouble building a clientele in that state. William Hertrich had long-standing dominion of the Botanical Gardens at the Huntington. The landscape designers Florence Yoch and Louise Council, and Lockwood DeForest Jr., among others, were already well-established there. Her few projects came via friends, such as the Bliss winter and retirement estate, &quot;Casa Dorinda&quot;, in Montecito, California, and the patronage of Mildred Bliss&#x27;s mother, Anna Blakely Bliss, for the nearby Santa Barbara Botanic Garden project. In the Los Angeles area, she had several commissions each with astronomer George Ellery Hale and architect Myron Hunt. With the latter she worked on projects at Occidental College and the California Institute of Technology (Caltech).

Farrand commuted cross-country by train for her eastern projects, such as the design and supervision of the Chinese inspired garden at &#x27;The Eyrie&#x27; for Abby Aldrich Rockefeller in Seal Harbor, Maine (1926–35). This was the era of the automobile, and in her designs Farrand applied principles learned earlier from Frederick Law Olmsted&#x27;s drives at the Arnold Arboretum and the Biltmore Estate of George Washington Vanderbilt II. John D. Rockefeller Jr. sought out and funded Farrand to design planting plans for subtle carriage roads at Acadia National Park on Mount Desert Island, Maine, near her Reef Point home (c.1930). Their use continues at the Park.

Extant Farrand private gardens in the eastern U.S. are: the Bliss family&#x27;s Dumbarton Oaks in Georgetown, Washington, D.C.; the Harkness summer home &#x27;Eolia&#x27; in Waterford, Connecticut (1918–1924), now preserved as the Harkness Memorial State Park; and the Rockefellers&#x27; estate &#x27;The Eyrie&#x27; in Seal Harbor, Maine. She also collaborated with Edith Wharton on landscape and garden design for The Mount, Wharton&#x27;s home in Lenox, Massachusetts, which is open to visitors from May–October. Henry James introduced her to Theodate Pope Riddle, &quot;one of her most fascinating clients&quot;, who owned the estate &#x27;Hill-Stead&#x27; (1913), now preserved as the Hill-Stead Museum in Farmington, Connecticut. In 1942, with Walter Macomber, she designed the gardens at Green Spring, near Alexandria, Virginia.

The Santa Barbara Botanic Garden, for California native plants, represents her talent in Santa Barbara, California. In England, her evolving major project, &#x27;Dartington Hall&#x27;, was for heiress Dorothy Payne Elmhirst in Devon (1932–37). The Reef Point Collection of her library, drawings and herbarium specimens are archived in the Environmental Design Archives at the College of Environmental Design at the University of California, Berkeley campus, except for the Dumbarton Oaks documents located at the library there, and the Arnold Arboretum drawings in their archives, both under the stewardship of Harvard.

In 2014, Farrand was recognized for her work designing the Peggy Rockefeller Rose Garden at New York Botanical Garden, a winning site of Built by Women New York City, a competition launched by the Beverly Willis Architecture Foundation during the fall of 2014 to identify outstanding and diverse sites and spaces designed, engineered and built by women.

==College campuses==
Farrand&#x27;s campus designs were based on three concepts: plants that bloomed throughout the academic year, emphasizing architecture as well as hiding flaws, and using upright and climbing plants so that the small spaces between buildings would not seem reduced in scale. Her designs are noted for their practicality, simplicity and ease of maintenance. She was the first consulting landscape architect for Princeton University in Princeton, New Jersey (1912–43).

As new buildings are constructed at Princeton now, architects are often referred to Farrand&#x27;s papers at U.C. Berkeley. She was the consulting landscape architect at Yale University in New Haven, Connecticut, for twenty-three years (1923–45), with projects including the Marsh Botanical Garden. She later went on to improve a dozen other campuses including the University of Chicago (1929–43), along with Southern California&#x27;s Occidental College and the California Institute of Technology. Beatrix Farrand completed design work for the Pennsylvania School of Horticulture for Women (1931–32). Later, she was also the landscape consultant to the Arnold Arboretum of Harvard University (1946–50).

==Later years and death==
During the last part of her life, Farrand devoted herself to creating a landscape study center at Reef Point, Maine. Here she continued developing the extensive garden and preparing the property for a transition to a public study center. She published the &quot;Reef Point Gardens Bulletin&quot; (1946–55), in which she reported on the progress of the gardens and center.

After a wildfire on the island and facing a lack of funding to complete and ensure the continued operation of a center she made a remarkable decision in 1955 to discontinue the preparations, dismantle the garden, sell the property, and use the proceeds for her last years. John D. Rockefeller Jr. purchased all Reef Point&#x27;s larger plants for his Asticou Azalea Garden in Northeast Harbor, Maine, which continue to flower. Approximately 2,000 herbarium specimens were given to the University and Jepson Herbaria at the University of California, Berkeley, where they serve as a permanent record of her choice of plants and localities.

Farrand lived at and spent the last three years of her life at Garland Farm, the home of her friends Lewis and Amy Magdalene Garland, on Mount Desert Island, Maine. It was here that she created her final garden, an intimate space in keeping with the size of the property. At age 86, Farrand died at the Mount Desert Island Hospital on February 28, 1959.

The Garland Farm was purchased by the Beatrix Farrand Society on January 9, 2004. The society&#x27;s mission is &quot;to foster the art and science of horticulture and landscape design, with emphasis on the life and work of Beatrix Farrand&quot;. It plans to continue Reef Point&#x27;s original educational mission as well as to preserve Garland Farm and Beatrix Farrand&#x27;s final garden.

<text>Landscape architecture is the design of outdoor areas, landmarks, and structures to achieve environmental, social-behavioural, or aesthetic outcomes. It involves the systematic design and general engineering of various structures for construction and human use, investigation of existing social, ecological, and soil conditions and processes in the landscape, and the design of other interventions that will produce desired outcomes.

The scope of the profession is broad and can be subdivided into several sub-categories including professional or licensed landscape architects who are regulated by governmental agencies and possess the expertise to design a wide range of structures and landforms for human use; landscape design which is not a licensed profession; site planning; stormwater management; erosion control; environmental restoration; public realm, parks, recreation and urban planning; visual resource management; green infrastructure planning and provision; and private estate and residence landscape master planning and design; all at varying scales of design, planning and management. A practitioner in the profession of landscape architecture may be called a landscape architect; however, in jurisdictions where professional licenses are required it is often only those who possess a landscape architect license who can be called a landscape architect.

==Definition of landscape architecture==

Modern landscape architecture is a multi-disciplinary field, incorporating aspects of urban design, architecture, geography, ecology, civil engineering, structural engineering, horticulture, environmental psychology, industrial design, soil sciences, botany, and fine arts. The activities of a landscape architect can range from the creation of public parks and parkways to site planning for campuses and corporate office parks; from the design of residential estates to the design of civil infrastructure; and from the management of large wilderness areas to reclamation of degraded landscapes such as mines or landfills. Landscape architects work on structures and external spaces in the landscape aspect of the design – large or small, urban, suburban and rural, and with &quot;hard&quot; (built) and &quot;soft&quot; (planted) materials, while integrating ecological sustainability.

The most valuable contribution can be made at the first stage of a project to generate ideas with technical understanding and creative flair for the design, organization, and use of spaces. The landscape architect can conceive the overall concept and prepare the master plan, from which detailed design drawings and technical specifications are prepared. They can also review proposals to authorize and supervise contracts for the construction work. Other skills include preparing design impact assessments, conducting environmental assessments and audits, and serving as an expert witness at inquiries on land use issues. The majority of their time will most likely be spent inside an office building designing and preparing models for clients.

== History ==
For the period before 1800, the history of landscape gardening (later called landscape architecture) is largely that of master planning and garden design for manor houses, palaces and royal properties. An example is the extensive work by André Le Nôtre for King Louis XIV of France on the Gardens of Versailles. The first person to write of &quot;making&quot; a landscape was Joseph Addison in 1712. The term landscape architecture was invented by Gilbert Laing Meason in 1828, and John Claudius Loudon (1783–1843) was instrumental in the adoption of the term landscape architecture by the modern profession. He took up the term from Meason and gave it publicity in his Encyclopedias and in his 1840 book on the &quot;Landscape Gardening and Landscape Architecture of the Late Humphry Repton&quot;.

John Claudius Loudon was an established and influential horticultural journalist and Scottish landscape architect whose writings were instrumental in shaping Victorian taste in gardens, public parks, and architecture. In the &quot;Landscape Gardening and Landscape Architecture of the Late Humphry Repton,&quot; Loudon describes two distinct styles of landscape gardening existing at the beginning of the 19th century: geometric and natural. Loudon wrote that each style reflected a different stage of society. The geometric style was “most striking and pleasing,” displaying wealth and taste in an “early state of society” and in “countries where the general scenery was wild, irregular, and natural, and man, comparatively, uncultivated and unrefined.” The natural style was used in “modern times” and in countries where “society is in a higher state of cultivation,&quot; displaying wealth and taste through the sacrifice of profitable lands to make room for such designs. 

The prominent English landscape designer Humphry Repton (1752-1818) echoed similar ideas in his work and design ideas. In his writings on the use of delineated spaces (e.g. courtyards, terrace walls, fences), Repton states that while the motive for defense no longer exists, the features are still useful in separating &quot;the gardens, which belong to man, and the forest, or desert, which belongs to the wild denizens.&quot; Repton refers to Indigenous peoples as &quot;uncivilized human beings, against whom some decided line of defense was absolutely necessary.”

The practice of landscape architecture spread from the Old to the New World. The term &quot;landscape architect&quot; was used as a professional title by Frederick Law Olmsted in the United States in 1863 and Andrew Jackson Downing, another early American landscape designer, was editor of &quot;The Horticulturist&quot; magazine (1846–52). In 1841 his first book, &quot;A Treatise on the Theory and Practice of Landscape Gardening, Adapted to North America&quot;, was published to a great success; it was the first book of its kind published in the United States. During the latter 19th century, the term landscape architect began to be used by professional landscapes designers, and was firmly established after Frederick Law Olmsted Jr. and Beatrix Jones (later Farrand) with others founded the American Society of Landscape Architects (ASLA) in 1899. IFLA was founded at Cambridge, England, in 1948 with Sir Geoffrey Jellicoe as its first president, representing 15 countries from Europe and North America. Later, in 1978, IFLA&#x27;s Headquarters were established in Versailles.

==Fields of activity==

The variety of the professional tasks that landscape architects collaborate on is very broad, but some examples of project types include:
* Parks of general design and public infrastructure
* Sustainable development
* Stormwater management including rain gardens, green roofs, groundwater recharge, green infrastructure, and constructed wetlands.
* Landscape design for educational function and site design for public institutions and government facilities
* Parks, botanical gardens, arboretums, greenways, and nature preserves
* Recreation facilities, such as playgrounds, golf courses, theme parks and sports facilities
* Housing areas, industrial parks and commercial developments
* Estate and residence landscape planning and design
* Landscaping and accents on highways, transportation structures, bridges, and transit corridors
* Contributions to urban design, town and city squares, waterfronts, pedestrian schemes
* Natural park, tourist destination, and recreating historical landscapes, and historic garden appraisal and conservation studies
* Reservoirs, dams, power stations, reclamation of extractive industry applications or major industrial projects and mitigation
* Environmental assessment and landscape assessment, planning advice and land management proposals.
* Coastal and offshore developments and mitigation
* Ecological design (any aspect of design that minimizes environmentally destructive impacts by integrating itself with natural processes and sustainability)

Landscape managers use their knowledge of landscape processes to advise on the long-term care and development of the landscape. They often work in forestry, nature conservation and agriculture.

Landscape scientists have specialist skills such as soil science, hydrology, geomorphology or botany that they relate to the practical problems of landscape work. Their projects can range from site surveys to the ecological assessment of broad areas for planning or management purposes. They may also report on the impact of development or the importance of particular species in a given area.

Landscape planners are concerned with landscape planning for the location, scenic, ecological and recreational aspects of urban, rural, and coastal land use. Their work is embodied in written statements of policy and strategy, and their remit includes master planning for new developments, landscape evaluations and assessments, and preparing countryside management or policy plans. Some may also apply an additional specialism such as landscape archaeology or law to the process of landscape planning.

Green roof (or more specifically, vegetative roof) designers design extensive and intensive roof gardens for stormwater management, evapo-transpirative cooling, sustainable architecture, aesthetics, and habitat creation.

==Relation to urban planning==

Through the 19th century, urban planning became a focal point and central issue in cities. The combination of the tradition of landscape gardening and the emerging field of urban planning offered landscape architecture an opportunity to serve these needs. In the second half of the century, Frederick Law Olmsted completed a series of parks that continue to have a significant influence on the practices of landscape architecture today. Among these were Central Park in New York City, Prospect Park in Brooklyn, New York and Boston&#x27;s Emerald Necklace park system. Jens Jensen designed sophisticated and naturalistic urban and regional parks for Chicago, Illinois, and private estates for the Ford family including Fair Lane and Gaukler Point. One of the original eleven founding members of the American Society of Landscape Architects (ASLA), and the only woman, was Beatrix Farrand. She was design consultant for over a dozen universities including: Princeton in Princeton, New Jersey; Yale in New Haven, Connecticut; and the Arnold Arboretum for Harvard in Boston, Massachusetts. Her numerous private estate projects include the landmark Dumbarton Oaks in the Georgetown neighborhood of Washington, D.C. Since that time, other architects – most notably Ruth Havey and Alden Hopkins – changed certain elements of the Farrand design.

Since this period urban planning has developed into a separate independent profession that has incorporated important contributions from other fields such as civil engineering, architecture and public administration. Urban Planners are qualified to perform tasks independent of landscape architects, and in general, the curriculum of landscape architecture programs do not prepare students to become urban planners.

Landscape architecture continues to develop as a design discipline and to respond to the various movements in architecture and design throughout the 20th and 21st centuries. Thomas Church was a mid-century landscape architect significant in the profession. Roberto Burle Marx in Brazil combined the International style and native Brazilian plants and culture for a new aesthetic. Innovation continues today solving challenging problems with contemporary design solutions for master planning, landscapes, and gardens.

Ian McHarg was known for introducing environmental concerns in landscape architecture. He popularized a system of analyzing the layers of a site in order to compile a complete understanding of the qualitative attributes of a place. This system became the foundation of today&#x27;s Geographic Information Systems (GIS). McHarg would give every qualitative aspect of the site a layer, such as the history, hydrology, topography, vegetation, etc. GIS software is ubiquitously used in the landscape architecture profession today to analyze materials in and on the Earth&#x27;s surface and is similarly used by urban planners, geographers, forestry and natural resources professionals, etc.

European nations enabled the widespread circulation of urban planning strategies by transferring landscaping ideas and practices to overseas colonies. The green belt was a popular landscape practice exported by Britain onto colonial territories such as Haifa (1918-1948). Spatial mechanisms like the green belt, implemented through the Haifa Bay Plan and the British &quot;Grand Model,&quot; were used to enforce political control and civic order and extend western ideas of progress and development. The Greater London Regional Planning Committee accepted the green belt concept which formed the basis of the 1938 Green Belt Act. The planning prototype demarcated open spaces, distinguished between city and countryside, limited urban growth, and created zoning divisions. It was used extensively in the British colonies to facilitate British rule through the organized division of landscape and populations. 

== Relation to Indigenous Practices ==
Indigenous land management practices create constantly changing landscapes through the use of vegetation and natural systems, contrasting with western epistemologies of the discipline that separate ornament from function. The discipline of landscape architecture favors western designs made from structured materials and geometric forms. Landscape architecture history books tend to include projects that contain constructed architectural elements that persist over time, excluding many Indigenous landscape-based designs.

Landscape architecture textbooks often place Indigenous peoples as a prefix to the official start of the discipline. The widely read landscape history text &quot;The Landscape of Man&quot; (1964) offers a global history of the designed landscape from past to present, featuring African and other Indigenous peoples in its discussions of paleolithic man between 500,000 and 8,000 BCE in relation to human migration. Indigenous land-management practices are described as archaeological rather than a part of contemporary practice. &quot;Gardens in Time&quot; (1980) also places Indigenous practice as prehistory at the beginning of the landscape architecture timeline. Authors John and Ray Oldham describe Aborigines of Australia as “survivors of an ancient way of life” who provide an opportunity to examine western Australia as a “meeting place of a prehistoric man.”

In the late 18th century, the landscapes created by aboriginal land and fire management practices appealed to English settlers in Australia. Journals from the period of early white settlement note the landscape resembling parks and popular designs in English landscape gardens of the same period. In England, these designs were considered sophisticated and celebrated for the intentional sacrifice of usable land. In Australia, the park-like condition was used to justify British control, citing its emptiness and lack of productive use as a basis for the dispossession of Aboriginal people. 

== Education ==
Landscape Architects are generally required to have university or graduate education from an accredited landscape architecture degree program, which can vary in length and degree title. They learn how to create projects from scratch, such as residential or commercial planting and designing outdoor living spaces they are willing to work with others to get a better outcome for the customers when doing a project; they will have to learn the basics of how to create a project on a manner of time and will require to get your license in a certain state to be allowed to work; students of Landscape Architects will learn how to interact with clients and will learn how to explain a design from scratch when giving the final project.

Landscape architecture has been taught in the University of Manchester since the 1950s. The course in the Manchester School of Architecture enables students to gain various bachelor&#x27;s and master&#x27;s degrees, including MLPM(Hons) which is accredited by the Landscape Institute and by the Royal Town Planning Institute.

==Profession==

In many countries, a professional institute, comprising members of the professional community, exists in order to protect the standing of the profession and promote its interests, and sometimes also regulate the practice of landscape architecture. The standard and strength of legal regulations governing landscape architecture practice varies from nation to nation, with some requiring licensure in order to practice; and some having little or no regulation. In Europe, North America, parts of South America, Australia, India, and New Zealand, landscape architecture is a regulated profession.

===Argentina===
Since 1889, with the arrival of the French architect and urbanist landscaper Carlos Thays, recommended to recreate the National Capital&#x27;s parks and public gardens, it was consolidated an apprentice and training program in landscaping that eventually became a regulated profession, currently the leading academic institution is the UBA University of Buenos Aires&quot;UBA Facultad de Arquitectura, Diseño y Urbanismo&quot; (Faculty of Architecture, Design and Urbanism) offering a Bacherlor&#x27;s degree in Urban Landscaping Design and Planning, the profession itself is regulated by the National Ministry of Urban Planning of Argentina and the Institute of the Buenos Aires Botanical Garden.

===Australia===
The Australian Institute of Landscape Architects (AILA) provides accreditation of university degrees and non-statutory professional registration for landscape architects. Once recognized by AILA, landscape architects use the title &#x27;Registered Landscape Architect&#x27; across the six states and territories within Australia.

AILA&#x27;s system of professional recognition is a national system overseen by the AILA National Office in Canberra. To apply for AILA Registration, an applicant usually needs to satisfy a number of pre-requisites, including university qualification, a minimum number years of practice and a record of professional experience.

Landscape Architecture within Australia covers a broad spectrum of planning, design, management, and research. From specialist design services for government and private sector developments through to specialist professional advice as an expert witness.

===Canada===
In Canada, landscape architecture, like law and medicine, is a self-regulating profession pursuant to provincial statute. For example, Ontario&#x27;s profession is governed by the Ontario Association of Landscape Architects pursuant to the &quot;Ontario Association of Landscape Architects Act&quot;. Landscape architects in Ontario, British Columbia, and Alberta must complete the specified components of L.A.R.E (Landscape Architecture Registration Examination) as a prerequisite to full professional standing.

Provincial regulatory bodies are members of a national organization, the Canadian Society of Landscape Architects / L&#x27;Association des Architectes Paysagistes du Canada (CSLA-AAPC), and individual membership in the CSLA-AAPC is obtained through joining one of the provincial or territorial components.

===Indonesia===
ISLA (Indonesia Society of Landscape Architects) is the Indonesian society for professional landscape architects formed on 4 February 1978 and is a member of IFLA APR and IFLA World. The main aim is to increase the dignity of the professional members of landscape architects by increasing their activity role in community service, national and international development. The management of IALI consists of National Administrators who are supported by 20 Regional Administrators (Provincial level) and 3 Branch Managers at city level throughout Indonesia.

Landscape architecture education in Indonesia was held in 18 universities, which graduated D3, Bachelor and Magister graduates. The landscape architecture education incorporate in Association of Indonesian Landscape Architecture Education.

===Italy===

AIAPP (Associazione Italiana Architettura del Paesaggio) is the Italian association of professional landscape architects formed in 1950 and is a member of IFLA and IFLA Europe (formerly known as EFLA). AIAPP is in the process of contesting this new law which has given the Architects&#x27; Association the new title of Architects, Landscape Architects, Planners and Conservationists whether or not they have had any training or experience in any of these fields other than Architecture.
In Italy, there are several different professions involved in landscape architecture:
*Architects
*Landscape designers
*Doctor landscape agronomists and Doctor landscape foresters, often called Landscape agronomists.
*Agrarian Experts and Graduated Agrarian experts.

===New Zealand===
The New Zealand Institute of Landscape Architects (NZILA) is the professional body for Landscape Architects in NZ.

In April 2013, NZILA jointly with AILA, hosted the 50th International Federation of Landscape Architects (IFLA) World Congress in Auckland, New Zealand. The World Congress is an international conference where Landscape Architects from all around the globe meet to share ideas around a particular topic.

Within NZ, Members of NZILA when they achieve their professional standing, can use the title Registered Landscape Architect NZILA.

NZILA provides an education policy and an accreditation process to review education programme providers; currently there are three accredited undergraduate Landscape Architecture programmes in New Zealand. Lincoln University also has an accredited masters programme in landscape architecture.

=== Norway ===
Landscape architecture in Norway was established in 1919 at the Norwegian University of Life Sciences (NMBU) at Ås. The Norwegian School of Landscape Architecture at the Faculty of Landscape and Society is responsible for Europe&#x27;s oldest landscape architecture education on an academic level. The departments areas include design and design of cities and places, garden art history, landscape engineering, greenery, zone planning, site development, place making and place keeping.

=== South Africa ===
In May 1962, Joane Pim, Ann Sutton, Peter Leutscher and Roelf Botha (considered the forefathers of the profession in South Africa) established the Institute for Landscape Architects, now known as the Institute for Landscape Architecture in South Africa (ILASA). ILASA is a voluntary organisation registered with the South African Council for the Landscape Architectural Profession (SACLAP). It consists of three regional bodies, namely, Gauteng, KwaZula-Natal and the Western Cape. ILASA&#x27;s mission is to advance the profession of landscape architecture and uphold high standards of professional service to its members, and to represent the profession of landscape architecture in any matter which may affect the interests of the members of the institute. ILASA holds the country&#x27;s membership with The International Federation of Landscape Architects (IFLA).

In South Africa, the profession is regulated by SACLAP, established as a statutory council in terms of Section 2 of the South African Council for the Landscape Architectural Profession Act – Act 45 of 2000. The Council evolved out of the Board of Control for Landscape Architects (BOCLASA), which functioned under the Council of Architects in terms of The Architectural Act, Act 73 of 1970. SACLAP&#x27;s mission is to establish, direct, sustain and ensure a high level of professional responsibilities and ethical conduct within the art and science of landscape architecture with honesty, dignity and integrity in the broad interest of public health, safety and welfare of the community.

After completion of an accredited under-graduate and/or post-graduate qualification in landscape architecture at either the University of Cape Town or the University of Pretoria, or landscape technology at the Cape Peninsula University of Technology, professional registration is attained via a mandatory mentored candidacy period (minimum of two years) and sitting of the professional registration exam. After successfully completing the exam, the individual is entitled to the status of Professional Landscape Architect or Professional Landscape Technologist.

=== Sweden ===
Architects Sweden, Sveriges Arkitekter, is the collective trade union and professional organisation for all architects, including landscape architects, in Sweden. The professional body is a member of IFLA (International Federation of Landscape Architects) as well as IFLA Europe.

As a landscape architect, anyone can become a member of Architects Sweden if they have a national or international university degree that is approved by the association. If the degree is from within the European Union, Architects Sweden approves Landscape architect educations listed by IFLA Europe. For educations outside the EU, the association makes an assessment on a statement from the Swedish Council for Higher Education (UHR).

===United Kingdom===
The UK&#x27;s professional body is the Landscape Institute (LI). It is a chartered body that accredits landscape professionals and university courses. At present there are fifteen accredited programmes in the UK. Membership of the LI is available to students, academics and professionals, and there are over 3,000 professionally qualified members.

The Institute provides services to assist members including support and promotion of the work of landscape architects; information and guidance to the public and industry about the specific expertise offered by those in the profession; and training and educational advice to students and professionals looking to build upon their experience.

In 2008, the LI launched a major recruitment drive entitled &quot;I want to be a Landscape Architect&quot; to encourage the study of Landscape Architecture. The campaign aimed to raise the profile of landscape architecture and highlight its valuable role in building sustainable communities and fighting climate change.

As of July 2018, the &quot;I want to be a Landscape Architect&quot; initiative was replaced by a brand new careers campaign entitled &quot;#ChooseLandscape&quot;, which aims to raise awareness of landscape as a profession; improve and increase access to landscape education; and inspire young people to choose landscape as a career. This new campaign includes other landscape-related professions such as landscape management, landscape planning, landscape science and urban design.

===United States===

In the United States, landscape architecture is regulated by individual state governments. For a landscape architect, obtaining licensure requires advanced education and work experience, plus passage of the national examination called the Landscape Architect Registration Examination (L.A.R.E.). Licensing is overseen at the national level by the Council of Landscape Architectural Registration Boards (CLARB). Several states require passage of a state exam as well.

Landscape architecture has been identified as an above-average growth profession by the US Bureau of Labor Statistics and was listed in &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot;&#x27;s list of Best Jobs to Have in 2006, 2007, 2008, 2009 and 2010. The national trade association for United States landscape architects is the American Society of Landscape Architects. Frederick Law Olmsted, who designed Central Park in New York City, is known as the &quot;father of American landscape architecture&quot;.

<text>The United States Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS or FWS) is a U.S. federal government agency within the United States Department of the Interior which oversees the management of fish, wildlife, and natural habitats in the United States. The mission of the agency is &quot;working with others to conserve, protect, and enhance fish, wildlife, plants and their habitats for the continuing benefit of the American people.&quot;

Among the responsibilities of the USFWS are enforcing federal wildlife laws; protecting endangered species; managing migratory birds; restoring nationally significant fisheries; conserving and restoring wildlife habitats, such as wetlands; helping foreign governments in international conservation efforts; and distributing money to fish and wildlife agencies of U.S. states through the Wildlife Sport Fish and Restoration Program. The vast majority of fish and wildlife habitats are on state or private land not controlled by the United States government. Therefore, the USFWS works closely with private groups such as Partners in Flight and the Sport Fishing and Boating Partnership Council to promote voluntary habitat conservation and restoration.

The Fish and Wildlife Service was created in 1940 through the combination of two previous bureaus within the Department of the Interior.

USFWS employs approximately 8,000 people and is organized into a central administrative office in Falls Church, Virginia, eight regional offices, and nearly 700 field offices distributed throughout the United States.

==History==
===Ancestor organizations===
====Fish Commission and Bureau of Fisheries====
The original ancestor of USFWS was the United States Commission on Fish and Fisheries, more commonly referred to as the United States Fish Commission, created in 1871 by the United States Congress with the purpose of studying and recommending solutions to a noted decline in the stocks of food fish. Spencer Fullerton Baird was appointed to lead it as the first United States Commissioner of Fisheries. In 1903, the Fish Commission was reorganized as the United States Bureau of Fisheries and made part of the United States Department of Commerce and Labor. When the Department of Commerce and Labor was split into the United States Department of Commerce and the United States Department of Labor in 1913, the Bureau of Fisheries was made part of the Department of Commerce. Originally focused on fisheries science and fish culture, the Bureau of Fisheries also assumed other duties; in 1906, the U.S. Congress assigned it the responsibility for the enforcement of fishery and fur seal-hunting regulations in the Territory of Alaska, and in 1910 for the management and harvest of northern fur seals, foxes, and other fur-bearing animals in the Pribilof Islands, as well as for the care, education, and welfare of the Aleut communities in the islands. In 1939, the Bureau of Fisheries moved from the Department of Commerce to the Department of the Interior.

====Bureau of Biological Survey====
The other ancestor of the USFWS began as the Section of Economic Ornithology, which was established within the United States Department of Agriculture in 1885 and became the Division of Economic Ornithology and Mammalogy in 1886. In 1896 it became the Division of Biological Survey. Clinton Hart Merriam headed the Division for 25 years and became a national figure for improving the scientific understanding of birds and mammals in the United States.

In 1934, the Division of Biological Survey was reorganized as the Bureau of Biological Survey and Jay Norwood Darling was appointed its chief;. The same year, Congress passed the Fish and Wildlife Coordination Act (FWCA), one of the oldest federal environmental review statutes. Under Darling&#x27;s guidance, the Bureau began an ongoing legacy of protecting vital natural habitat throughout the United States. In 1939, the Bureau of Biological Survey moved from the Department of Agriculture to the Department of the Interior.

===Fish and Wildlife Service===
On June 30, 1940, the Bureau of Fisheries and the Bureau of Biological Survey were combined to form the Department of the Interior&#x27;s Fish and Wildlife Service. In 1956, the Fish and Wildlife Service was reorganized as the United States Fish and Wildlife Service — which remained part of the Department of the Interior — and divided its operations into two bureaus, the Bureau of Sport Fisheries and Wildlife and the Bureau of Commercial Fisheries, with the latter inheriting the history and heritage of the old U.S. Fish Commission and U.S. Bureau of Fisheries.

Upon the formation of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) within the Department of Commerce on October 3, 1970, the Bureau of Commercial Fisheries merged with the salt-water laboratories of the Bureau of Sport Fisheries and Wildlife to form today&#x27;s National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS), an element of NOAA. The remainder of the USFWS remained in place in the Department of the Interior in 1970 as the foundation of the USFWS as it is known today, although in 1985 the Animal Damage Control Agency, responsible for predator control, was transferred from the USFWS to the Department of Agriculture and renamed the Division of Wildlife Services.

==Activities==
===National Wildlife Refuge System===
USFWS manages the National Wildlife Refuge System, which consists of 570 National Wildlife Refuges, encompassing a full range of habitat types, including wetlands, prairies, coastal and marine areas, and temperate, tundra, and boreal forests spread across all 50 U.S. states. It also manages thousands of small wetlands and other special management areas covering over .

===National Monuments===
The USFWS governs six National Monuments:
* The Hanford Reach National Monument in Washington state;
* The Papahānaumokuākea Marine National Monument, a huge maritime area in the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands, managed jointly with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) and the State of Hawaii;
* The Aleutian Islands World War II National Monument in the Aleutian Islands in Alaska;
* The Pacific Islands Heritage Marine National Monument, the largest marine protected area in the world, managed in consultation with NOAA;
* The Rose Atoll Marine National Monument in American Samoa, managed jointly with NOAA and the Government of American Samoa; and
* The Marianas Trench Marine National Monument, which includes undersea mud volcanoes, vents, chemosynthetic organisms, and many of the deepest points on Earth, managed in coordination with NOAA

===Endangered species===
The USFWS shares the responsibility for administering the Endangered Species Act of 1973 with the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS), an element of NOAA, with the NMFS responsible for marine species, the FWS responsible for freshwater fish and all other species, and the two organizations jointly managing species that occur in both marine and non-marine environments. The USFWS publishes the quarterly &quot;Endangered Species Bulletin&quot;.

===National Fish Hatchery System===
The USFWS&#x27;s Fisheries Program oversees the National Fish Hatchery System (NFHS), which includes 70 National Fish Hatcheries and 65 Fish and Wildlife Conservation Offices. Originally created to reverse declines in lake and coastal fish stocks in the United States, the NFHS subsequently expanded its mission to include the preservation of the genes of wild and hatchery-raised fish; the restoration of native aquatic populations of fish, freshwater mussels, and amphibians including populations of species listed under the Endangered Species Act; mitigating the loss of fisheries resulting from U.S. Government water projects; and providing fish to benefit Native Americans and National Wildlife Refuges. The NFHS also engages in outreach, education, and research activities.

===National Fish Passage Program===
The National Fish Passage Program provides financial and technical resources to projects that promote the free movement of fish and aquatic life. Common projects include dam removal and fishway construction. Between 1999 and 2023, the program has worked with over 2,000 local partners to open of upstream habitat by removing or bypassing 3,400 aquatic barriers.

===Migratory Bird Program===
The Division of Migratory Bird Management runs the Migratory Bird Program, which works with partners of the USFWS to protect, restore, and conserve bird populations and their habitats by ensuring the long-term ecological sustainability of all migratory bird populations, increasing the socioeconomic benefit of birds, improving the experience of hunting, bird watching, and other outdoor activities related to birds, and increasing the awareness of the aesthetic, ecological, recreational and economic significance of migratory birds and their habitats. It conducts surveys; coordinates USFWS activities with those of public-private bird conservation partnerships; provides matching grants for conservation efforts involving USFWS partners; develops policies and regulations and administers conservation laws related to migratory birds; issues permits to allow individuals and organizations to participate in migratory bird conservation efforts; helps educate and engage children in wildlife conservation topics; and provides resources for parents and educators to assist them in helping children explore nature and birds.

===Landscape Conservation Cooperatives===
The USFWS partners with the Landscape Conservation Cooperatives, a network of 22 autonomous cooperatives sponsored by the Department of the Interior which function as regional conservation bodies covering the entire United States and adjacent areas.

===Law enforcement===
====Office of Law Enforcement====
The Office of Law Enforcement enforces wildlife laws, investigates wildlife crimes, regulates wildlife trade, helps people in the United States understand and obey wildlife protection laws, and works in partnership with international, state, and tribal counterparts to conserve wildlife resources. It also trains other U.S. Government, U.S. state, tribal, and foreign law enforcement officers.

====Clark R. Bavin National Fish and Wildlife Forensic Laboratory====
The USFWS operates the Clark R. Bavin National Fish and Wildlife Forensic Laboratory, the only forensics laboratory in the world devoted to wildlife law enforcement. By treaty, it also is the official crime laboratory for the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) and the Wildlife Group of Interpol. The laboratory identifies the species or subspecies of pieces, parts, or products of an animal to determine its cause of death, help wildlife officers determine if a violation of law occurred in its death, and to identify and compare physical evidence to link suspects to the crime scene and the animal&#x27;s death.

====Division of Refuge Law Enforcement====
United States Fish and Wildlife Service Refuge Law Enforcement consists of professional law enforcement officers entrusted with protecting natural resources and public safety.
Federal Wildlife Officers promote the survival of species and health of the environment by ensuring that wildlife laws are followed. They also welcome visitors and are often the first U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service employees encountered by the public on refuges. Federal Wildlife Officers (FWO) are entrusted with protecting natural resources, visitors and employees on National Wildlife Refuge System lands.

===Federal Duck Stamp===

The USFWS issues an annual Federal Duck Stamp, a collectable adhesive stamp required to hunt for migratory waterfowl. It also allows access to National Wildlife Refuges without paying an admission fee.

===International Affairs Program===
The USFWS International Affairs Program coordinates domestic and international efforts to protect, restore, and enhance wildlife and its habitats, focusing on species of international concern, fulfilling the USFWS&#x27;s international responsibilities under about 40 treaties, as well as U.S. laws and regulations. It oversees programs which work with private citizens, local communities, other U.S. Government and U.S. state agencies, foreign governments, non-governmental organizations, scientific and conservation organizations, industry groups. and other interested parties on issues related to the implementation of treaties and laws and the conservation of species around the world.

===National Conservation Training Center===
The USFWS&#x27;s National Conservation Training Center trains USFWS employees and those of USFWS partners in the accomplishment of the USFWS&#x27;s mission.

===Predator control===
At its founding in 1896, the work of the Division of Biological Survey focused on the effect of birds in controlling agricultural pests and mapping the geographical distribution of plants and animals in the United States. By 1905 with funding scarce, the Survey included in its mission the eradication of wolves, coyotes and other large predators. This garnered them the support of ranchers and western legislators resulting, by 1914, in a $125,000 congressionally approved budget for use &quot;on the National Forests and the public domain in destroying wolves, coyotes and other animals injurious to agriculture and animal husbandry&quot;. Meanwhile, scientists like Joseph Grinnell and Charles C. Adams, a founder of the Ecological Society of America, were promoting a &quot;balance of nature&quot; theory – the idea that predators were an important part of the larger ecosystem and should not be eradicated. In 1924, at a conference organized by the American Society of Mammologists (ASM), the debate generated a public split between those in the Survey, promoting eradication, and those from the ASM who promoted some sort of accommodation. Edward A. Goldman, from the Survey, made perfectly clear their position in a paper that with the arrival of Europeans in North America, the balance of nature had been &quot;violently overturned, never to be reestablished&quot;. He concludes with the idea that &quot;Large predatory mammals, destructive to livestock and to game, no longer have a place in our advancing civilization.&quot; The Survey subsequently placed over 2 million poisoned bait stations across the west and by 1930 had &quot;extirpated wolves from the Lower 48 and advised and assisted in erasing grey wolves from&quot; Yellowstone and Glacier National Parks. The Survey then turned to the eradication of coyote, coordinated through the 1931 Animal Damage Control Act.

With various agency reorganizations, the practice continued more or less apace through the early 1970s but though hundreds of thousands of coyotes were killed, their extreme adaptability and resilience led to little overall population reduction and, instead, their migration into an expanded habitat, including urban areas. Increasing environmental awareness in the late 1960s and early 1970s resulted in Nixon banning post-World War II-era poisons in 1972 and the passage of the Endangered Species Act in 1973. Also in 1972, the Nixon administration rewrote the Animal Damage Control Act, effectively repealing it in favor of turning the mission of predator control over to the states. The loss of federally fund to protect their livestock was too much for ranching and agricultural communities and by 1980 Reagan had reversed the poison killing ban and transferred the responsibility for predator control to the Wildlife Services program under the US Department of Agriculture&#x27;s Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service. The Program&#x27;s mission has evolved to protect &quot;agriculture, wildlife and other natural resources, property, and human health and safety&quot;.

===Tribal relations===
Pursuant to the eagle feather law, Title 50, Part 22 of the Code of Federal Regulations (50 CFR 22), and the &quot;Bald and Golden Eagle Protection Act&quot;, the USFWS administers the National Eagle Repository and the permit system for Native American religious use of eagle feathers. These exceptions often only apply to Native Americans that are registered with the federal government and are enrolled with a federally recognized tribe.

In the late 1990s and early 2000s, the USFWS began to incorporate the research of tribal scientists into conservation decisions. This came on the heels of Native American traditional ecological knowledge (TEK) gaining acceptance in the scientific community as a reasonable and respectable way to gain knowledge of managing the natural world. Additionally, other natural resource agencies within the United States government, such as the United States Department of Agriculture, have taken steps to be more inclusive of tribes, native people, and tribal rights. This has marked a transition to a relationship of more co-operation rather than the tension between tribes and government agencies seen historically. Today, these agencies work closely with tribal governments to ensure the best conservation decisions are made and that tribes retain their sovereignty.

===Former fleet===
From 1940 to 1970, the FWS (from 1956 the USFWS) operated a fleet of seagoing vessels. The fleet included fisheries science research ships, fishery patrol vessels, and cargo liners.

The Fish Commission operated a small fleet of research ships and fish-culture vessels. The Bureau of Fisheries inherited these in 1903, and then greatly expanded its fleet of seagoing vessels, including both patrol vessels for fishery enforcement in the Territory of Alaska and a cargo liner — known as the &quot;Pribilof tender&quot; — to provide transportation for passengers and haul cargo to, from, and between the Pribilof Islands. In the 1930s, the Bureau of Biological Survey operated a vessel of its own, &quot;Brown Bear&quot;. Upon its creation in 1940, the FWS inherited the BOF&#x27;s fleet and &quot;Brown Bear&quot;.

By 1940, no fisheries research vessels remained in commission, the BOF having decommissioned the last one, , in 1932; only in the late 1940s did the FWS begin to commission new research ships. Although between 1871 and 1940 the Fish Commission and BOF had never had more than three fisheries research ships in commission at the same time — and had three in commission simultaneously only in two years out of their entire combined history — by March 1950, the FWS fleet included 11 seagoing fisheries research and exploratory fishing vessels either in service or under construction, and its fishery enforcement force in the Territory of Alaska included 29 patrol vessels and about 100 speedboats, as well as 20 airplanes. In the 1956 reorganization that created the USFWS, the Bureau of Commercial Fisheries (BCF) assumed the responsibility within the USFWS for the operation of the seagoing vessels of the fleet.

The USFWS continued fishery enforcement in Alaska until after Alaska became a state in January 1959, but by 1960 had turned over enforcement responsibilities and some of the associated vessels to the Government of Alaska as the latter assumed the responsibility for fishery enforcement in its waters. The USFWS continued to operate fisheries research ships and the Pribilof tender until the BCF&#x27;s seagoing fleet was transferred to the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS), an element of NOAA, upon the creation of NOAA on October 3, 1970. Although the NMFS continued to operate the Pribilof tender until 1975, the rest of the ships were transferred from the NMFS to a unified NOAA fleet during 1972 and 1973. The modern NOAA fleet therefore traces its ancestry in part to the USFWS fleet operated by the BCF.

Both before and after the FWS became the USFWS in 1956, ships of its fleet used the prefix while in commission. The BOF usually named its ships after aquatic birds, and ships the FWS inherited from the BOF in 1940 retained those names in FWS service. However, the FWS/USFWS thereafter usually named vessels it acquired after people who were notable in the history of fisheries and fisheries science. A partial list of ships of the FWS and USFWS fleet:
* (research vessel, 1948–1959)
* (research vessel, USFWS 1963–1970, then NOAA 1970–2008)

<text>Snow Crash is a science fiction novel by the American writer Neal Stephenson, published in 1992. Like many of Stephenson&#x27;s novels, its themes include history, linguistics, anthropology, archaeology, religion, computer science, politics, cryptography, memetics, and philosophy.

In his 1999 essay &quot;In the Beginning... Was the Command Line&quot;, Stephenson explained the title of the novel as his term for a particular software failure mode on the early Macintosh computer. Stephenson wrote, &quot;When the computer crashed and wrote gibberish into the bitmap, the result was something that looked vaguely like static on a broken television set—a &#x27;snow crash. Stephenson has also mentioned that Julian Jaynes&#x27; book &quot;The Origin of Consciousness in the Breakdown of the Bicameral Mind&quot; was one of the main influences on &quot;Snow Crash&quot;.

&quot;Snow Crash&quot; was nominated for both the British Science Fiction Award in 1993 and the Arthur C. Clarke Award in 1994.

==Plot==
===Plot background===
In the 21st century, an unspecified number of years after a worldwide economic collapse, Los Angeles is no longer part of the United States since the federal government has ceded most of its power and territory to private organizations and entrepreneurs. Franchising, individual sovereignty, and private vehicles reign supreme. Mercenary armies compete for national defense contracts, while private security guards preserve the peace in sovereign gated housing developments. Highway companies compete to attract drivers to their roads, and all mail delivery is by hired courier. The remnants of government maintain authority only in isolated compounds, where they do tedious make-work that is, by and large, irrelevant to the society around them. Much of the world&#x27;s territory has been carved up into sovereign enclaves known as Franchise-Organized Quasi-National Entities (FOQNEs), each run by its own big business franchise (such as &quot;Mr. Lee&#x27;s Greater Hong Kong&quot;, or the corporatized American Mafia), or various residential &quot;burbclaves&quot; (quasi-sovereign gated communities). In this future, American institutions are far different from those in the actual United States at the time the book was published; for example, a for-profit organization, the CIC, has evolved from the CIA&#x27;s merger with the Library of Congress.

===Summary===
Hiro Protagonist is a freelance hacker, and pizza delivery driver for the Mafia. He meets Y.T. (short for Yours Truly), a young skateboard Kourier (courier), who refers to herself in the third person, during a failed attempt to make a delivery on time. Y.T. completes the delivery on his behalf, and they strike up a partnership, gathering intel and selling it to the CIC.

Within the &quot;Metaverse&quot;, Hiro is offered a datafile named Snow Crash by a man named Raven, who hints that it is a form of narcotic. Hiro&#x27;s friend and fellow hacker Da5id views a bitmap image contained in the file, which causes his computer to crash and Da5id to suffer brain damage in the real world. Hiro meets his ex-girlfriend Juanita Marquez, who gives him a database containing a large amount of research compiled by her associate, Lagos. This research posits connections between the virus, ancient Sumerian culture, and the legend of the Tower of Babel. Juanita advises him to be careful and disappears.

The Mafia boss Uncle Enzo begins to take a paternal interest in Y.T. Impressed by her attitude and initiative, he arranges to meet her and offers her freelance jobs. Hiro&#x27;s investigations and Y.T.&#x27;s intelligence gathering begin to coincide, with links between the neuro-linguistic viruses, a religious organization known as Reverend Wayne&#x27;s Pearly Gates and a media magnate named L. Bob Rife beginning to emerge. Lagos&#x27;s research showed that the ancient Sumerian ur-language allowed brain function to be &quot;programmed&quot; using audio stimuli in conjunction with a DNA-altering virus. Sumerian culture was organized around these programs (known as &quot;me&quot;), which priests administered to the populace. Enki, a figure of legend, developed a counter-virus (known as &quot;the nam-shub of Enki&quot;), which, when delivered, stopped the Sumerian language from being processed by the brain and led to the development of other, less literal languages, giving birth to the Babel myth. L. Bob Rife had been collecting Sumerian artifacts and developed the drug Snow Crash to make the public vulnerable to new forms of &quot;me&quot;, which he would control. The physical form of the virus is distributed in the form of an addictive drug and within Reverend Wayne&#x27;s church via infected blood. There is also a digital version, to which hackers are especially vulnerable, as they are accustomed to processing information in binary form.

Hiro heads north to the Oregon Coast, where the Raft, a huge collection of boats containing Eurasian refugees, is approaching the West Coast of the United States. The center of the Raft is L. Bob Rife&#x27;s yacht, formerly the USS &quot;Enterprise&quot; nuclear-powered aircraft carrier. Rife has been using the Raft as a mechanism to indoctrinate and infect thousands with the virus and to import it to America. Y.T. is captured and brought to Rife on the Raft, who intends to use her as a hostage, knowing her connection to Uncle Enzo. With help from the Mafia, Hiro fights his way onto the Raft and recovers the &quot;nam-shub&quot; of Enki, which Rife had been concealing. With help from Juanita, who had previously infiltrated the Raft, the &quot;nam-shub&quot; is read out, and Rife&#x27;s control over the Raft is broken. Rife flees the Raft, taking Y.T., and his mercenary, Raven, attempts to activate the digital form of Snow Crash at a virtual concert within the Metaverse. Hiro is able to neutralize the virus, and Y.T. escapes. At Los Angeles International Airport, Raven ambushes the Mafia and fights Uncle Enzo to a stalemate (though both men are severely injured in the process), while Rife is killed as he attempts to flee the airport on his private jet. Y.T. is reunited with her mother, and Hiro and Juanita reconcile and agree to rekindle their relationship.

==Background==
Stephenson originally planned &quot;Snow Crash&quot; as a computer-generated graphic novel in collaboration with artist Tony Sheeder. In the author&#x27;s acknowledgments Stephenson recalls:

===Ideas and ideologies===
The books themes include history, linguistics, anthropology, archaeology, religion, computer science, politics, cryptography, memetics, and philosophy.

&quot;Snow Crash&quot; takes place under anarcho-capitalism, a theme Stephenson carries over to his next novel &quot;The Diamond Age&quot;. As described in both novels and the short story &quot;The Great Simoleon Caper&quot; (1995), hyperinflation has sapped the value of the US dollar to the extent that trillion-dollar bills are nearly disregarded, and the quadrillion-dollar note is the standard &quot;small&quot; bill. This hyperinflation was created by the government overprinting money due to loss of tax revenue, as people increasingly began to use electronic currency, which they exchanged in untaxable encrypted online transactions. For physical transactions, most people resort to alternative currencies such as the yen or &quot;Kongbucks&quot; (the official currency of Mr. Lee&#x27;s Greater Hong Kong). Hyperinflation has also negatively affected much of the world, resulting in waves of desperate refugees from Asia who cross the Pacific in rickety ships hoping to arrive in North America.

The &quot;Metaverse&quot;, a phrase coined by Stephenson as a successor to the Internet, constitutes Stephenson&#x27;s early 1990s vision of how a virtual reality–based Internet might evolve shortly. Resembling a massively multiplayer online game (MMO). The Metaverse is populated by user-controlled avatars, as well as system daemons. Although there are public-access Metaverse terminals in &quot;Reality&quot;, using them carries a social stigma among Metaverse denizens, in part because of the poor visual representations of themselves as low-quality avatars. Status in the Metaverse is a function of two things: access to restricted areas such as the Black Sun, an exclusive Metaverse club, and the sophistication of one&#x27;s avatar.

==Characteristic technologies==

Various fictional technologies are employed in this world and help define it, including skateboards and motorcycles with adaptive &quot;Smartwheels&quot;, cybernetic guard dogs known as &quot;Rat Things&quot;, and a prototype portable railgun weapon named &quot;Reason&quot;.

===Metaverse===

Stephenson&#x27;s &quot;Metaverse&quot; appears to its users as an urban environment, developed along a single hundred-meter-wide road, the Street, that runs around the entire 65,536 km (216 km) circumference of a featureless, black, perfectly spherical planet. The virtual real estate is owned by the Global Multimedia Protocol Group, a fictional part of the real life Association for Computing Machinery, and is available to be bought and buildings developed thereupon. Access to the metaverse is through L. Bob Rife&#x27;s global fiber-optic network, which grew from a collection of small cable television franchises into a global telecommunications monopoly and superseded the traditional telephone system.

Users of the Metaverse gain access to it through personal terminals that project a high-quality virtual reality display onto goggles worn by the user, or from low-quality public terminals in booths (with the penalty of presenting a grainy black-and-white appearance). Stephenson also describes a subculture of people choosing to remain continuously connected to the Metaverse by wearing portable terminals, goggles and other equipment; they are nicknamed &quot;gargoyles&quot; due to their grotesque appearance. The users of the Metaverse experience it from a first-person perspective.

Within the Metaverse, individual users appear as avatars of any form, with the sole restriction of height, &quot;to prevent people from walking around a mile high&quot;. Transport within the Metaverse is limited to analogs of reality by foot or vehicle, such as the monorail that runs the entire length of the Street, stopping at 256 &quot;Express Ports&quot;, located evenly at 256 km intervals, and &quot;Local Ports&quot;, one kilometer apart.

===Distributed republics===
Distributed republics are loosely connected state-like entities dispersed across the world. The concept was reused by Stephenson in &quot;The Diamond Age&quot;.

==Literary significance and criticism==
&quot;Snow Crash&quot; established Stephenson as a major science fiction writer of the 1990s. The book appeared on &quot;Time&quot; magazine&#x27;s list of 100 all-time best English-language novels written since 1923. Some critics have considered it a parody of cyberpunk and mentioned its satiric or absurdist humor.

In his book &quot;The Shape of the Signifier: 1967 to the End of History&quot;, Walter Benn Michaels targets Stephenson&#x27;s view that &quot;languages are codes&quot; rather than a grouping of letters and sounds to be interpreted. Michaels contends that this basic idea of language as code is central to the construct of &quot;Snow Crash&quot; (&quot;... a good deal of &quot;Snow Crash&quot;&#x27;s plot depends upon eliding the distinction between hackers and their computers, as if—indeed, in the novel, just because—looking at code will do to the hacker what receiving it will do to the computer&quot;), but at the same time, trivializes the role of meaning in linguistic works.The body that is infected by a virus does not become infected because it understands the virus any more than the body that does not become infected misunderstands the virus. So a world in which everything—from bitmaps to blood—can be understood as a &quot;form of speech&quot; is also a world in which nothing actually is &quot;understood&quot;, a world in which what a speech act does is disconnected from what it means.

Rorty&#x27;s &quot;Achieving Our Country&quot; summarizes the content of &quot;Snow Crash&quot;, using it as an example of modern culture that &quot;express the loss of what he [Rorty] calls &#x27;national hope&#x27;... the problem with &quot;Snow Crash&quot; is not that it isn&#x27;t true—after all, it&#x27;s a story—but that it isn&#x27;t inspirational&quot;. This lack of inspiration is offset by something else &quot;Snow Crash&quot; and other works like it offer:These books produce in their readers the &#x27;state of soul&#x27; that Rorty calls &#x27;knowingness&#x27;, which he glosses as a &#x27;preference for knowledge over hope&#x27; (37)&quot;; this preference for knowledge &quot;contribute[s] to a more fundamental failure to appreciate the value of inspiration—and hence of literature—itself&quot;.

===Influence on the World Wide Web and computing===
&quot;Habitat&quot;, the 1986 virtual environment, applied the Sanskrit term &quot;avatar&quot; to online virtual bodies before Stephenson. However, the success of &quot;Snow Crash&quot; popularized the term to the extent that &quot;avatar&quot; is now the accepted term for this concept in computer games and on the World Wide Web.

The novel&#x27;s Central Intelligence Corporation—the result of a merger between the Library of Congress and Central Intelligence Agency—operates a wiki-like private knowledge base known as the Library. However, unlike Wikimedia, contributors to the Library (stringers) are paid if their contributions are used, making the Library more of an information marketplace than a public knowledge repository.

Many virtual globe programs, including NASA World Wind and Google Earth, bear a resemblance to the &quot;Earth&quot; software developed by the CIC in &quot;Snow Crash&quot;. One Google Earth co-founder claimed that Google Earth was modeled after &quot;Snow Crash&quot;, while another co-founder said that it was inspired by &quot;Powers of Ten&quot;. Stephenson later referenced this in another of his novels, &quot;Reamde&quot;.

Stephenson&#x27;s concept of the Metaverse has enjoyed continued popularity and influence in high-tech circles (especially Silicon Valley) ever since the publication of &quot;Snow Crash&quot;. As a result, Stephenson has become &quot;a sought-after futurist&quot; and has worked as a futurist for Blue Origin and Magic Leap.

Software developer Michael Abrash was inspired by &quot;Snow Crash&quot;″s Metaverse and its networked 3D world. He left Microsoft for Id Software to write something in that direction, the result being &quot;Quake&quot;. The story for the 3DO game &quot;Immercenary&quot; was also heavily influenced by &quot;Snow Crash&quot;. A direct video-game adaptation of &quot;Snow Crash&quot; was in development in 1996, but it was never released.

The online virtual worlds &quot;Active Worlds&quot; and &quot;Second Life&quot; were both directly inspired by the Metaverse in &quot;Snow Crash&quot;.

Former Microsoft Chief Technology Officer J Allard and former Xbox Live Development Manager Boyd Multerer claimed to have been heavily inspired by &quot;Snow Crash&quot; in the development of Xbox Live, and that it was a mandatory read for the Xbox development team.

===Possible film or television adaptation===
The novel was optioned shortly after its publication and subsequent success, although to date, it has never progressed past pre-production. Canadian science fiction director Vincenzo Natali in particular has argued against a two-hour feature film adaptation because of a perceived lack of fit with the form; since the novel is &quot;tonally all over the place&quot;, he feels that a mini-series would be a more suitable format for the material.

In late 1996, it was announced that writer-director Jeffrey Nachmanoff would adapt the novel for The Kennedy/Marshall Company and Touchstone Pictures. Marco Brambilla was attached to direct the film. In June 2012, it was announced that English director Joe Cornish, following his 2011 debut film &quot;Attack the Block&quot;, had been signed as director of a future film adaptation for Paramount Pictures. In 2013, Stephenson described Cornish&#x27;s script as &quot;amazing&quot;, but also warned that there was no guarantee that a film would be made. In July 2016, producer Frank Marshall said that filming could start in 2017.

In August 2017, Amazon Studios announced that it was co-producing an hour-long science fiction drama television show based on &quot;Snow Crash&quot; with Paramount. The announcement stated that the television show would be executive produced by Cornish and the Kennedy/Marshall Company&#x27;s Frank Marshall. In December 2019, it was announced that HBO Max had acquired the series with Paramount continuing to produce and Cornish remaining executive producer. HBO Max passed on the project in June 2021, and it reverted to Paramount and Kennedy/Marshall.

==Influence==
Google co-founder Sergey Brin called &quot;Snow Crash&quot; one of his favorite novels. One of the developers of Google Earth noted The Metaverse as an influence. The concept of the Metaverse also inspired the rebrand of Facebook to Meta Platforms Inc. in 2021, and spurred author Neal Stephenson himself to found a company in 2022 called Lamina1 to support the creation of virtual worlds using blockchain technology.

<doc id="75311" wikidata="Q333595" url="?curid=75311" title="Ricardo Montalbán">
<text>Ricardo Gonzalo Pedro Montalbán y Merino, ( ; ; November 25, 1920 – January 14, 2009) was a Mexican and American film and television actor. Montalbán&#x27;s career spanned seven decades, during which he became widely known for performances in genres from crime and drama to musicals and comedy. 

Later in his career, Montalbán portrayed Armando in the &quot;Planet of the Apes&quot; film series from the early 1970s, starring in both &quot;Escape from the Planet of the Apes&quot; (1971) and &quot;Conquest of the Planet of the Apes&quot; (1972). As the villain Khan Noonien Singh, a genetically enhanced human, he guest-starred in the original &quot;Star Trek&quot; television series (1967) and starred in the film &quot;Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan&quot; (1982). 

During the 1970s and 1980s, Montalbán was a spokesman for Chrysler for thirteen years, featured in their automotive commercials and advertisements, notably those in which he extolled the &quot;rich Corinthian leather&quot; used in the Cordoba&#x27;s interior.

Montalbán played Mr. Roarke on the television series &quot;Fantasy Island&quot; (1977–1984). He won an Emmy Award for his role in the miniseries &quot;How the West Was Won&quot; (1978), and a Lifetime Achievement Award from the Screen Actors Guild in 1993. Montalbán was professionally active into his eighties, providing voices for animated films and commercials, and appearing as Grandfather Valentin in the &quot;Spy Kids&quot; franchise.

==Early life==
Montalbán was born on November 25, 1920, in Mexico City, and grew up in Torreón, the son of Spanish immigrants Ricarda Merino Jiménez and Genaro Balbino Montalbán Busano, a store manager, who raised him as a Catholic. He was born with an arteriovenous malformation (AVM) in his spine. Montalbán had a sister, Carmen, and two brothers, Pedro and Carlos. As a teenager, he moved to Los Angeles to live with Carlos. They moved to New York City in 1940, and Montalbán earned a minor role in the play &quot;Her Cardboard Lover&quot;.

==Career==
===Short films===
In 1941, Montalbán appeared in three-minute musicals produced for the Soundies film jukeboxes. He appeared in many of the New York–produced Soundies as an extra or as a member of a singing chorus (usually billed as Men and Maids of Melody), although he had the lead role in &quot;He&#x27;s a Latin from Staten Island&quot; (1941), in which he (billed simply as &quot;Ricardo&quot;) played the title role of a guitar-strumming gigolo, accompanied by an offscreen vocal by Gus Van.

===Mexican films===
Later in 1941, Montalbán returned to Mexico after learning that his mother was dying. There, he acted in a dozen Spanish-language films and became a star in his homeland.

He had an uncredited appearance in a version of &quot;The Three Musketeers&quot; (1942) starring Cantinflas. He can be glimpsed in &quot;El verdugo de Sevilla&quot; (1942), &quot;The Saint That Forged a Country&quot; (1942) starring Ramon Navarro, and &quot;La razón de la culpa&quot; (1943).

===Stardom in Mexico===
Montalbán became a star in Mexico in &quot;Santa&quot; (1943), which was directed by a Hollywood expat, Norman Foster. He followed it with a support role in &quot;Cinco fueron escogidos&quot; (1943).

Some American filmmakers shot a movie in Mexico about Yugoslavia in World War II, &quot;Five Were Chosen&quot; (1944). Montalbán had a support role.

Foster gave him a second lead role in &quot;The Escape&quot; (1944) aka &quot;La Fuga&quot;. Montalban had the star role in &quot;Cadetes de la naval&quot;, &quot;Nosotros&quot;, and &quot;The Hour of Truth&quot; (all 1945), the latter a bullfighting drama also directed by Foster.

Montalban was in &quot;The House of the Fox&quot; (1945), &quot;Pepita Jimenez&quot; (1946), and &quot;Fantasía ranchera&quot; (1947).

===Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer===
Montalbán&#x27;s films had been seen by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer who were looking for someone to play a bullfighter opposite Esther Williams in &quot;Fiesta&quot; (1947), shot in Mexico. Montalbán was cast and the movie was very popular; Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer signed him to a long-term contract.

The studio re-teamed him with Williams in &quot;On an Island with You&quot; (1948). He had a dance number in the Frank Sinatra musical &quot;The Kissing Bandit&quot; (1948), then did a third film with Williams, &quot;Neptune&#x27;s Daughter&quot; (1949), in which they dueted on &quot;Baby It&#x27;s Cold Outside&quot;.

Montalbán&#x27;s first leading role was in the film noir &quot;Border Incident&quot; (1949) with actor George Murphy, directed by Anthony Mann. It was one of a number of lower budgeted films made at the studio under Dore Schary and earned a small loss. Montalbán was the first Hispanic actor to appear on the front cover of &quot;Life&quot; magazine on November 21, 1949. &quot;I was king for a week,&quot; he said later. &quot;I thought the offers would flood in, but after a week—nothing.&quot;

Montalban was one of several soldiers in the William Wellman war film &quot;Battleground&quot; (1949), a huge success at the box office. He was given another star role in &quot;Mystery Street&quot; (1950), playing a detective in a film noir directed by John Sturges. It was a box office disappointment.

Sturges also directed &quot;Right Cross&quot; (1950) with Montalbán, Dick Powell and June Allyson. Montalbán and Jane Powell made the musical &quot;Two Weeks with Love&quot; (1950), which was a minor hit.

Universal borrowed Montalbán and Cyd Charisse for a swashbuckler, &quot;The Mark of the Renegade&quot; (1951). Back at Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, he was second billed to Clark Gable in &quot;Across the Wide Missouri&quot; (1951), directed by Wellman. The film was a big hit, although Montalbán was injured during shooting.

The studio teamed him and Shelley Winters in &quot;My Man and I&quot; (1952) where he played a laborer under the direction of Wellman; it didn&#x27;t sell well at the box office.

Montalbán was one of several names in &quot;Sombrero&quot; (1953), shot in Mexico. Montalbán was Lana Turner&#x27;s leading man in &quot;Latin Lovers&quot; (1953). Both films lost money and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer let him go.

He later said, &quot;I played caricatures of what a Latin is supposed to be like. In reality, we are family men. I should have had the courage of Dolores Del Rio who returned to Mexico and made her best movies there.&quot;

===B movies, television, and Broadway===
Montalbán did a swashbuckler for Sam Katzman, &quot;The Saracen Blade&quot; (1954), then returned to Mexico to star in &quot;Untouched&quot; (1954).

He travelled to Italy to make &quot;The Queen of Babylon&quot; (1954) with Rhonda Fleming, then returned to Mexico to make the US-financed &quot;A Life in the Balance&quot; (1955) with Anne Bancroft. He bought a story for himself, &quot;Green Shadows&quot;, but it appears to have not been made.

Montalbán began working in television, guest-starring on shows such as &quot;General Electric Theater&quot;, &quot;The Ford Television Theatre&quot;, &quot;Celebrity Playhouse&quot;, &quot;Climax!&quot;, &quot;The 20th Century-Fox Hour&quot; (versions of &quot;Broken Arrow&quot; and &quot;Five Fingers&quot;), &quot;Chevron Hall of Stars&quot;, &quot;Wagon Train&quot;, and &quot;Schlitz Playhouse&quot;.

In 1955, he appeared on Broadway in &quot;Seventh Heaven&quot; with Gloria DeHaven but it ran for only forty-four performances. In Hollywood, he appeared in the thriller for Allied Artists, &quot;Three for Jamie Dawn&quot; (1956).

Montalbán returned to Italy for &quot;Desert Warrior&quot; (1957), then had his first role in an &quot;A&quot; Hollywood film for a number of years in &quot;Sayonara&quot; (1957), in which he played a Japanese dancer. He later said, &quot;I was and still am very pleased with my performance and very much saddened by this picture. I was hoping for an Academy Award nomination, but unfortunately, most of my scenes ended up on the cutting-room floor.&quot;

From 1957 to 1959, Montalbán starred in the Broadway musical &quot;Jamaica&quot;, singing several light-hearted calypso numbers opposite Lena Horne, which ran for 555 performances. His performance earned him a Tony Award nomination.

Montalbán continued to guest-star on shows such as &quot;Colgate Theatre&quot; and &quot;Playhouse 90&quot;. When &quot;Jamaica&quot; ended, he guest-starred in &quot;Riverboat&quot;, &quot;Adventures in Paradise&quot;, &quot;Startime&quot;, &quot;Death Valley Days&quot;, &quot;Bonanza&quot;, &quot;Alfred Hitchcock Presents&quot;, &quot;The Christophers&quot;, &quot;The Dinah Shore Chevy Show&quot;, &quot;The Loretta Young Show&quot; (several times), &quot;Zorro&quot;, &quot;The Untouchables&quot;, &quot;Checkmate&quot;, &quot;Cain&#x27;s Hundred&quot;, and &quot;The Lloyd Bridges Show&quot;.

Montalbán could also be seen in &quot;Let No Man Write My Epitaph&quot; (1960); the TV remake of &quot;Rashomon&quot; (1960) directed by Sidney Lumet; &quot;Rage of the Buccaneers&quot; (1961), an Italian swashbuckler in which Montalbán had a lead role alongside Vincent Price; &quot;Hemingway&#x27;s Adventures of a Young Man&quot; (1962); &quot;The Reluctant Saint&quot; (1963) with Maximillian Schell; and &quot;Love is a Ball&quot; (1963) with Glenn Ford, playing a French duke. He was the Native American leader Little Wolf in &quot;Cheyenne Autumn&quot; (1964) directed by John Ford, did the TV version of &quot;The Fantasticks&quot; (1964), and returned to Mexico to make &quot;¡Buenas noches, año nuevo!&quot; (1964).

He was mostly seen, though, on television in &quot;Alcoa Premiere&quot;, &quot;The Dick Powell Theatre&quot;, &quot;Ben Casey&quot;, &quot;The Greatest Show on Earth&quot;, &quot;The Lieutenant&quot;, &quot;The Great Adventure&quot;, &quot;Slattery&#x27;s People&quot;, &quot;The Defenders&quot;, &quot;The Rogues&quot;, &quot;Burke&#x27;s Law&quot;, &quot;Dr. Kildare&quot;, and &quot;The Man from U.N.C.L.E.&quot;

Montalbán had supporting roles in &quot;The Money Trap&quot; (1965) with Ford, directed by Burt Kennedy, &quot;Madame X&quot; (1966) with Turner for producer Ross Hunter, and &quot;The Singing Nun&quot; (1966) with Debbie Reynolds at MGM.

He guest-starred in &quot;The Long, Hot Summer&quot;, &quot;Daniel Boone&quot;, &quot;The Wild Wild West&quot;, &quot;Insight&quot;, &quot;Combat!&quot;, &quot;&quot;, &quot;I Spy&quot;, &quot;Hawaii Five-O&quot; (playing a Japanese-American crime boss ), and &quot;Bob Hope Presents the Chrysler Theatre&quot;.

In 1965, he toured in &quot;The King and I&quot;. I think every actor loves the stage,&#x27; he said in 1991. &#x27;The pros are that it is the actor&#x27;s medium; there&#x27;s no way your scene is going to end up on the cutting-room floor, and it&#x27;s up to you to get and keep the attention of the audience by the truth of your performance.

He appeared in the TV movies &quot;Alice Through the Looking Glass&quot; (1966) (for which his fee was $10,000, equivalent to $ today.) and &quot;Code Name: Heraclitus&quot; (1967), and the features &quot;The Longest Hundred Miles&quot; (1967), &quot;Sol Madrid&quot; (1968), and &quot;Blue&quot; (1968). He also guest-starred on &quot;Space Seed&quot;, an episode of &quot;Star Trek&quot;. &quot;I&#x27;m like a doctor on 24-hour call,&quot; he said in a 1967 interview. &quot;I don&#x27;t turn anything down.&quot;

Montalbán also starred in radio, such as on the internationally syndicated program &quot;Lobo del Mar&quot; (&quot;Seawolf&quot;), in which he was cast as the captain of a vessel that became part of some adventure at each port it visited. This 30-minute weekly show aired in many Spanish-speaking countries until the early 1970s.
===Television movies===
Montalbán guest-starred in &quot;The Felony Squad&quot;, &quot;Ironside&quot;, &quot;It Takes a Thief&quot;, and &quot;The High Chaparral&quot;. He did the TV movies &quot;The Pigeon&quot; (1969), &quot;The Desperate Mission&quot; (1969) (playing Joaquin Murrieta), and &quot;Black Water Gold&quot; (1970), and had a supporting role in the big screen film version of &quot;Sweet Charity&quot; (1969).

Montalbán was in &quot;The Name of the Game&quot;; &quot;Gunsmoke&quot;; &quot;Dan August&quot;; &quot;Bracken&#x27;s World&quot;; &quot;Marcus Welby, M.D.&quot;; &quot;The Virginian&quot;; &quot;The Doris Day Show&quot;; &quot;Sarge&quot;; and &quot;Nichols&quot;. He did the TV movies &quot;The Aquarians&quot; (1970), &quot;The Face of Fear&quot; (1971), and &quot;Fireball Forward&quot; (1972) and the features &quot;The Deserter&quot; (1970), &quot;Escape from the Planet of the Apes&quot; (1971), &quot;Conquest of the Planet of the Apes&quot;, and &quot;The Train Robbers&quot; (1973) (directed by Kennedy).

Montalbán continued to guest-star on shows like &quot;O&#x27;Hara, U.S. Treasury&quot;; &quot;Here&#x27;s Lucy&quot;; and &quot;Griff&quot;.

In 1972, Montalbán co-founded the Screen Actors Guild Ethnic Minority Committee with actors Carmen Zapata, Henry Darrow and Edith Diaz. In 1973, he returned to Broadway for a revival of &quot;Don Juan in Hell&quot;. He did the TV movies &quot;Wonder Woman&quot; (1974), &quot;The Mark of Zorro&quot; (1974), &quot;McNaughton&#x27;s Daughter&quot; (1976), and guest-starred on &quot;Switch&quot; and &quot;Columbo&quot;.
In 1975, he was chosen as the television spokesman for the new Chrysler Cordoba. The car became a successful model, and over the following several years, was heavily advertised; his mellifluous delivery of a line praising the &quot;soft&quot;, &quot;fine&quot; or &quot;rich Corinthian leather&quot; upholstery of the car&#x27;s interior became famous and was much parodied, and Montalbán subsequently became a favorite subject of impersonators. For example, Eugene Levy frequently impersonated him on &quot;SCTV&quot;, as did Dan Aykroyd on &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;. In 1986, he was featured in a magazine advertisement for the new Chrysler New Yorker.

Montalbán is in &quot;Won Ton Ton: The Dog Who Saved Hollywood&quot; (1976), and &quot;Joe Panther&quot; (1976) and had a regular role in a short lived series &quot;Executive Suite&quot; (1976). He guest-starred on &quot;Police Story&quot; and did the TV movies &quot;Mission to Glory: A True Story&quot; (1977), &quot;Captains Courageous&quot; (1977), as well as the miniseries &quot;How the West Was Won&quot; (1978).

===&quot;Fantasy Island&quot; and &quot;Star Trek II&quot;===

Montalbán&#x27;s best-known television role was that of Mr. Roarke on the television series &quot;Fantasy Island&quot;, which he played from 1977 until 1984. For a while, the series was one of the most popular on television, and his character as well as that of his sidekick, Tattoo (played by Hervé Villechaize), became popular icons.

Another of his well-known roles was that of Khan Noonien Singh in &quot;Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan&quot; (1982), in which he reprised a role that he had originated in the episode of &quot;Star Trek&quot; titled &quot;Space Seed&quot; (1967). Early rumors suggested Montalbán wore prosthetic muscles on his chest during filming of &quot;Star Trek II&quot; to appear more muscular. Director Nicholas Meyer replied that even in his sixties, Montalbán, who had a vigorous training regimen, was &quot;one strong cookie&quot;, and that his real chest was seen on film. Khan&#x27;s costume was specifically designed to display Montalbán&#x27;s physique. 

His performance as Khan was widely praised. Critic Christopher Null called Khan the &quot;greatest role of Montalbán&#x27;s career&quot;. &quot;New Yorker&quot; critic Pauline Kael said Montalbán&#x27;s performance as Khan &quot;was the only validation he has ever had of his power to command the big screen&quot;. Roger Ebert of &quot;The Chicago Sun-Times&quot; wrote how this type of film was &quot;only as good as its villain&quot; and Montalbán&#x27;s decision to avoid overacting and instead play the character as motivated by &quot;deeply wounded pride&quot; inspired a measure of sympathy in the audience. 

Montalbán agreed to take the role for a significant pay cut, since by his own admission, he relished reprising the role, and his only regret was that he and William Shatner never interacted – the characters never meet face to face, except through video communication – for their scenes were filmed several months apart in order to accommodate Montalbán&#x27;s schedule for &quot;Fantasy Island&quot;. When, much later, Montalbán guest-starred in the &quot;Family Guy&quot; episode &quot;McStroke&quot; as a genetically engineered cow, his character made several references to his role as Khan, and similar references were made in his role as Guitierrez on the animated series &quot;Freakazoid!&quot;. After a cameo in &quot;Cannonball Run II&quot; (1984), Montalbán had a guest role in &quot;Dynasty&quot; which led to a regular role in its spin-off &quot;The Colbys&quot;.

Montalbán played the villain in &quot;The Naked Gun: From the Files of Police Squad!&quot; (1988) and guest-starred in &quot;B.L. Stryker&quot;; &quot;Murder, She Wrote&quot;; &quot;Hearts Are Wild&quot;; and &quot;The Golden Palace&quot;.

===Injury and later career===
During the filming of &quot;Across the Wide Missouri&quot; (1951), Montalbán was thrown from his horse, knocked unconscious, and trampled by another horse, which aggravated his arteriovenous malformation and resulted in a traumatic back injury that never healed. The pain increased as he aged, and in 1993, he underwent over nine hours of spinal surgery that left his body below the waist impaired and requiring the use of mobility aids.

Despite constant pain, he continued to perform, providing voices for animated films and supporting his Nosotros Foundation. Filmmaker Robert Rodriguez created a role in his &quot;Spy Kids&quot; film series specifically for Montalbán.

He had another regular series with &quot;Heaven Help Us&quot; (1994), but it only lasted 14 episodes.

In 1997, Montalbán sued the producers of &quot;Fantasy Island&quot; claiming he was entitled to five percent of the profits. The producers claimed the show had lost $11 million. The matter settled out of court.

Montalbán also narrated several historical documentaries including the Spanish version of the National Park Service&#x27;s history of Pecos Pueblo for Pecos National Historical Park.

At one point during the development of the Disney animated film &quot;Lilo &amp; Stitch&quot; (2002), Montalbán recorded voice lines for an alien member of a gang led by Stitch, then made to be an adult, naturally-born alien gang leader, using his performance as Khan in &quot;Star Trek II&quot; as basis. After a story meeting in which the film&#x27;s gang elements were entirely cut due to being perceived as superfluous to the plot, Montalbán&#x27;s character and all his already-recorded voice lines were removed.

Montalbán had a supporting role in &quot;Spy Kids 2: The Island of Lost Dreams&quot; (2002) and &quot;Spy Kids 3-D: Game Over&quot; (2003).

Prior to his death in January 2009, Montalbán recorded the voice for a guest character in an episode of the animated series &quot;American Dad!&quot;, in which main character Roger becomes the dictator of a South American country. According to executive producer Mike Barker, it was his last role after &quot;The Ant Bully&quot;.

==Nosotros Foundation and Montalbán Theatre==
The way he was asked to portray Mexicans disturbed him, so Montalbán, along with Richard Hernandez, Val de Vargas, Rodolfo Hoyos Jr., Carlos Rivas, Tony de Marco, and Henry Darrow, established the Nosotros (&quot;We&quot;) Foundation in 1970 to advocate for Latinos in the movie and television industries. He served as its first president, and was quoted as saying: &quot;I received tremendous support, but there also were some negative repercussions. I was accused of being a militant, and as a result I lost jobs.&quot; Ironically, the Nosotros Foundation and he were instrumental in taking roles away from Nico Minardos, a Greek-American actor who in the 1970s often played Latino roles because of his appearance and accent. Minardos similarly became outspoken, and according to his agent and others, it cost him a recurring role as a Mexican mayor in an episode of &quot;Alias Smith and Jones&quot;.

The foundation created the Golden Eagle Awards, an annual awards show highlighting Latino actors. The awards are presented in conjunction with the Nosotros American Latino Film Festival, held at the Ricardo Montalbán Theatre in Hollywood.
The Nosotros Foundation and the Ricardo Montalbán Foundation agreed to purchase the Doolittle Theatre in 1999 from UCLA. The theater had been owned by Howard Hughes in the early 1930s, then later was renamed the Huntington Hartford Theater when purchased in 1954 by philanthropist Huntington Hartford, then later the Doolittle Theater. The process from agreement to opening took over four years. The facility in Hollywood was officially renamed the Ricardo Montalbán Theatre in a May 11, 2004, ceremony. The event was attended by numerous celebrities, including Ed Begley Jr. representing the Screen Actors Guild, Valerie Harper, Loni Anderson, Hector Elizondo, and Robert Goulet.

When Montalbán rolled onto the stage in his wheelchair, he repeated &quot;the five stages of the actor&quot; (originally coined by Jack Elam to describe the course of his own career). Montalbán had become famous for using the self-deprecating joke in interviews and in public speeches:
* Who is Ricardo Montalbán?
* Get me Ricardo Montalbán.
* Get me a Ricardo Montalbán type.
* Get me a young Ricardo Montalbán.
* Who is Ricardo Montalbán?

He then jokingly added two more stages: 
* &quot;Wait a minute—isn&#x27;t that What&#x27;s-his-name?&quot;, referring to his role in the &quot;Spy Kids&quot; movies
* &quot;Who the hell is that?&quot;, believing that to be the reaction of people seeing his name on the theater marquee.

Montalbán spoke about the goal of the Nosotros organization:

==Personal life==

After seeing Georgiana Young in &quot;The Story of Alexander Graham Bell&quot; (1939), then-18-year-old Montalbán became enamored of the 15-year-old Younghalf-sister of actresses Sally Blane, Polly Ann Young, and Loretta Young. Montalbán had started his own stage and film career by the time the two met on a blind date; Montalbán proposed that evening, later stating &quot;It took a week to persuade her.&quot; They married in 1944, and had four children together: Laura, Mark, Anita and Victor. After 63 years of marriage, Young died in 2007, at age 83.
Montalbán was a practicing Catholic, once claiming that his religion was the most important thing in his life. He was a member of the Good Shepherd Parish and the Catholic Motion Picture Guild in Beverly Hills, California. In 1998, Pope John Paul II made him a Knight of the Order of St. Gregory the Great (KSG), the highest honor a Roman Catholic lay person can receive from the Church. In 1986, in honor of the 100th anniversary of the Statue of Liberty, he recorded a public service announcement celebrating the United States&#x27; generosity and hospitality to him as a foreign-born actor.

His autobiography &quot;Reflections: A Life in Two Worlds&quot; was published in January 1980 by Doubleday.

For many years, he followed a strict diet and physical training regimen, giving him an enviable physique. After the release of &quot;The Wrath of Khan&quot;, director Nicholas Meyer was quick to quell any rumors of Montalbán&#x27;s using prosthetics during filming.

In 2005, Montalbán was due to receive an honorary doctorate from the University of New Mexico, but due to circumstances was unable to attend the ceremony. On May 13, 2023, Montalbán was posthumously awarded an honorary Doctorate of Humane Letters from UNM, which was received by his granddaughter Lydia Martinez. 

===Death===
On January 14, 2009, Montalbán died at his home in Los Angeles at the age of 88. According to his son-in-law, Gilbert Smith, he died of &quot;complications from advancing age&quot;. The precise cause of death was revealed to be congestive heart failure. He is buried in the Holy Cross Cemetery in Culver City, California.

In the film &quot;My Dinner with Hervé&quot; (2018), Montalbán was played by Andy García.

<doc id="75319" wikidata="Q59736" url="?curid=75319" title="Ignaz Semmelweis">
<text>Ignaz Philipp Semmelweis (; ; 1 July 1818 – 13 August 1865) was a Hungarian physician and scientist of German descent who was an early pioneer of antiseptic procedures and was described as the &quot;saviour of mothers&quot;. Postpartum infection, also known as puerperal fever or childbed fever, consists of any bacterial infection of the reproductive tract following birth and in the 19th century was common and often fatal. Semmelweis discovered that the incidence of infection could be drastically reduced by requiring healthcare workers in obstetrical clinics to disinfect their hands. In 1847, he proposed hand washing with chlorinated lime solutions at Vienna General Hospital&#x27;s First Obstetrical Clinic, where doctors&#x27; wards had three times the mortality of midwives&#x27; wards. The maternal mortality rate dropped from 18% to less than 2%, and he published a book of his findings, &quot;Etiology, Concept and Prophylaxis of Childbed Fever&quot;, in 1861.

Despite his research, Semmelweis&#x27;s observations conflicted with the established scientific and medical opinions of the time and his ideas were rejected by the medical community. He could offer no theoretical explanation for his findings of reduced mortality due to hand-washing, and some doctors were offended at the suggestion that they should wash their hands and mocked him for it. In 1865, the increasingly outspoken Semmelweis allegedly suffered a nervous breakdown and was committed to an asylum by his colleagues. In the asylum, he was beaten by the guards. He died 14 days later from a gangrenous wound on his right hand that may have been caused by the beating.

His findings earned widespread acceptance only years after his death, when Louis Pasteur confirmed the germ theory, giving Semmelweis&#x27; observations a theoretical explanation, and Joseph Lister, acting on Pasteur&#x27;s research, practised and operated using hygienic methods with great success.

==Family and early life==

Ignaz Semmelweis was born on 1 July 1818 in the Tabán neighbourhood of Buda, Kingdom of Hungary, Austrian Empire. He was the fifth child out of 10 of the prosperous grocer family of József Semmelweis and Teréz Müller.

Of German ancestry, his father was an ethnic German born in Kismarton, in the Kingdom of Hungary (now Eisenstadt, Austria), and his mother an ethnic German from Buda. József Semmelweis was granted citizenship in Buda in 1806 and, in the same year, he opened a wholesale business for spices and general consumer goods. The company was named &quot;Zum weißen Elefanten&quot; (At the White Elephant) in the Meindl House (today&#x27;s Semmelweis Museum of Medical History, located at 1–3 Apród Street, Budapest). By 1810, he was a wealthy man and married Teréz Müller, daughter of the coachbuilder Fülöp Müller.

Ignaz began studying law at the University of Vienna in the autumn of 1837, but switched to medicine. He was awarded his doctor of medicine degree in 1844. After failing to obtain an appointment in a clinic for internal medicine, Semmelweis specialized in obstetrics. His teachers included Carl von Rokitansky, Joseph Škoda, and Ferdinand von Hebra.

Semmelweis was appointed assistant to Professor Johann Klein in the First Obstetrical Clinic of the Vienna General Hospital on 1 July 1846.

Two maternity clinics were at the Viennese hospital. The First Clinic had an average maternal mortality rate of about 10% due to puerperal fever. The Second Clinic&#x27;s rate averaged less than 4%. Women begged to be admitted to the Second Clinic, due to the reputation of the First Clinic. Semmelweis described desperate women begging on their knees not to be admitted to the First Clinic.

Women began purposefully giving birth in the streets, pretending to have given birth &quot;en route&quot; to the hospital so they could avoid being admitted to the clinic where the risk of infection, birth complications and death were substantially higher. 

Semmelweis was puzzled that puerperal fever was rare among women giving street births, prompting his curiosity as to what protected those who delivered outside the clinic.

=== Analysis of child bed fever mortality ===

Troubled by the mortality discrepancy between the two clinics, Semmelweis searched for differences. He excluded overcrowding as a cause since the Second Clinic was always more crowded. He eliminated climate because the two clinics were in close geographical proximity to each other. He altered the position in which mothers gave birth and proposed that priests giving last rites in the clinic was terrifying women after birth causing them to develop the fever.


===Theory of cadaverous poisoning===

Semmelweis&#x27; breakthrough occurred in 1847, following the death of his good friend Jakob Kolletschka, who had been accidentally poked with a student&#x27;s scalpel while performing a &quot;post mortem&quot; examination. Kolletschka&#x27;s autopsy showed a pathology similar to that of the women who were dying from puerperal fever. Semmelweis immediately proposed a connection between cadaveric contamination and puerperal fever.

He proposed that he and the medical students carried &quot;cadaverous particles&quot; on their hands from the autopsy room to the patients they examined in the First Obstetrical Clinic. This explained why the student midwives in the Second Clinic, who were not engaged in autopsies and had no contact with corpses, saw a much lower mortality rate.

The germ theory of disease had not yet been accepted in Vienna. Thus, Semmelweis concluded some unknown &quot;cadaverous material&quot; caused childbed fever. He instituted a policy of using a solution of chlorinated lime (calcium hypochlorite) for washing hands between autopsy work and the examination of patients. He did this because he found that this chlorinated solution worked best to remove the putrid smell of infected autopsy tissue, and thus perhaps destroyed the causal &quot;poisonous&quot; or contaminating &quot;cadaveric&quot; agent hypothetically being transmitted by this material. The result was the mortality rate in the First Clinic declined 90% and was then comparable to that in the Second Clinic. The mortality rate in April 1847, before the new hand washing procedures were instituted, was 18.3%. The new procedures started in mid-May leading to lower rates: June 2.2%, July 1.2%, and August 1.9%. In two months in the year following this discovery, for the first time since the introduction of anatomical orientation, the death rate was zero.

==Efforts to reduce childbed fever==
Semmelweis&#x27;s hypothesis, that there was only one cause, that all that mattered was cleanliness, was extreme at the time and was largely ignored, rejected, or ridiculed. He was dismissed from the hospital for political reasons and harassed by the medical community in Vienna, being eventually forced to move to Budapest.

Semmelweis was outraged by the indifference of the medical profession and began writing open and increasingly angry letters to prominent European obstetricians, at times denouncing them as irresponsible murderers. His contemporaries, including his wife, believed he was losing his mind, and in 1865, nearly 20 years after his breakthrough, he was committed to the &quot;Landesirrenanstalt Döbling&quot; (provincial lunatic asylum). He died there of septic shock only 14 days later, possibly as the result of being severely beaten by guards. Semmelweis&#x27;s practice earned widespread acceptance only years after his death when Louis Pasteur further developed the germ theory of disease, offering a theoretical explanation for Semmelweis&#x27;s findings. He is considered a pioneer of antiseptic procedures.

===Conflict with established medical opinion===

Semmelweis&#x27;s observations conflicted with the established scientific and medical opinions of the time. The theory of diseases was highly influenced by ideas of an imbalance of the basic &quot;four humours&quot; in the body, a theory known as dyscrasia, for which the main treatment was bloodlettings. Medical texts at the time emphasized that each case of disease was unique, the result of a personal imbalance, and the main difficulty of the medical profession was to establish precisely each patient&#x27;s unique situation, case by case.

The findings from autopsies of deceased women also showed a confusing multitude of physical signs, which emphasized the belief that puerperal fever was not one, but many different, yet unidentified, diseases.

The rejection of Semmelweis&#x27;s empirical observations is often traced to belief perseverance, the psychological tendency of clinging to discredited beliefs. Also, some historians of science argue that resistance to path-breaking contributions of obscure scientists is common and &quot;constitutes the single most formidable block to scientific advances.&quot;

As a result, his ideas were rejected by the medical community. Other, more subtle, factors may also have played a role. Some doctors, for instance, were offended at the suggestion that they should wash their hands, feeling that their social status as gentlemen was inconsistent with the idea that their hands could be unclean.

Semmelweis&#x27;s results lacked scientific explanation at the time. That became possible only in the 1860s and 1870s, when Louis Pasteur, Joseph Lister, and others further developed the germ theory of disease.

During 1848, Semmelweis widened the scope of his washing protocol, to include all instruments coming in contact with patients in labour, and used mortality rates time series to document his success in virtually eliminating puerperal fever from the hospital ward.

===Hesitant publication of results and first signs of trouble===

Toward the end of 1847, accounts of the work of Semmelweis (as well as the similar conclusions of Oliver Wendell Holmes Sr., working in the United States of America) began to spread around Europe. Semmelweis and his students wrote letters to the directors of several prominent maternity clinics describing their recent observations. Ferdinand von Hebra, the editor of a leading Austrian medical journal, announced Semmelweis&#x27;s discovery in the December 1847 and April 1848 issues of the medical journal. Hebra claimed that Semmelweis&#x27;s work had a practical significance comparable to that of Edward Jenner&#x27;s introduction of cowpox inoculations to prevent smallpox.

In late 1848, one of Semmelweis&#x27;s former students wrote a lecture explaining Semmelweis&#x27;s work. The lecture was presented before the Royal Medical and Surgical Society in London and a review published in &quot;The Lancet&quot;, a prominent medical journal. A few months later, another of Semmelweis&#x27;s former students published a similar essay in a French periodical.

As accounts of the dramatic reduction in mortality rates in Vienna were being circulated throughout Europe, Semmelweis had reason to expect that the chlorine washings would be widely adopted, saving tens of thousands of lives. Early responses to his work also gave clear signs of coming trouble, however. Some physicians had clearly misinterpreted his claims. Additionally, initial responses to Semmelweis&#x27;s findings tended to downplay their significance by arguing that &quot;he had said nothing new&quot;. James Young Simpson, for instance, saw no difference between Semmelweis&#x27;s groundbreaking findings and the idea presented in an 1843 paper by Oliver Wendell Holmes Sr. that childbed fever was contagious (&quot;i.e&quot;. that infected persons could pass the infection to others).

In fact, Semmelweis was warning against all decaying organic matter, not just against a specific contagion that originated from victims of childbed fever themselves. This misunderstanding, and others like it, occurred partly because Semmelweis&#x27;s work was known only through secondhand reports written by his colleagues and students. At this crucial stage, Semmelweis himself had published nothing. These and similar misinterpretations continued to cloud discussions of his work throughout the century.

Some accounts emphasize that Semmelweis refused to communicate his method officially to the learned circles of Vienna, nor was he eager to explain it on paper.

===Political turmoil and dismissal from the Vienna hospital===
In 1848, a series of tumultuous revolutions swept across Europe. The resulting political turmoil would affect Semmelweis&#x27;s career. In Vienna on 13 March 1848, students demonstrated in favor of increased civil rights, including trial by jury and freedom of expression. The demonstrations were led by medical students and young faculty members and were joined by workers from the suburbs. Two days later in Hungary, demonstrations and uprisings led to the Hungarian Revolution of 1848 and a full-scale war against the ruling Habsburgs of the Austrian Empire. In Vienna, the March demonstration was followed by months of general unrest.

No evidence indicates Semmelweis was personally involved in the events of 1848. Some of his brothers were punished for active participation in the Hungarian independence movement, and the Hungarian-born Semmelweis likely was sympathetic to the cause. Semmelweis&#x27;s superior, professor Johann Klein, was a conservative Austrian, likely uneasy with the independence movements and alarmed by the other revolutions of 1848 in the Habsburg areas. Klein probably mistrusted Semmelweis.

When Semmelweis&#x27;s term was about to expire, Carl Braun also applied for the position of &quot;assistant&quot; in the First Clinic, possibly at Klein&#x27;s own invitation. Semmelweis and Braun were the only two applicants for the post. Semmelweis&#x27;s predecessor, Franz Breit, had been granted a two-year extension. Semmelweis&#x27;s application for an extension was supported by Joseph Škoda and Carl von Rokitansky and by most of the medical faculty, but Klein chose Braun for the position. Semmelweis was obliged to leave the obstetrical clinic when his term expired on 20 March 1849.

The day his term expired, Semmelweis petitioned the Viennese authorities to be made docent of obstetrics. A docent was a private lecturer who taught students and who had access to some university facilities. At first, because of Klein&#x27;s opposition, Semmelweis&#x27;s petition was denied. He reapplied, but had to wait until 10 October 1850 (more than 18 months), before finally being appointed docent of &#x27;theoretical&#x27; obstetrics. The terms refused him access to cadavers and limited him to teaching students by using leather-fabricated mannequins only. A few days after being notified of his appointment, Semmelweis left Vienna abruptly and returned to Pest. He apparently left without so much as saying goodbye to his former friends and colleagues, a move that might have offended them. According to his own account, he left Vienna because he was &quot;unable to endure further frustrations in dealing with the Viennese medical establishment&quot;.

===Life in Budapest===

During 1848–1849, some troops from the Habsburg-ruled Austrian Empire thwarted the Hungarian independence movement, executed or imprisoned its leaders and in the process destroyed parts of Pest. Semmelweis, upon arriving from the Habsburg Vienna in 1850, likely was not warmly welcomed in Pest.

On 20 May 1851, Semmelweis took the relatively insignificant, unpaid, honorary head-physician position of the obstetric ward of Pest&#x27;s small Szent Rókus Hospital. He held that position for six years, until June 1857. Childbed fever was rampant at the clinic; at a visit in 1850, just after returning to Pest, Semmelweis found one fresh corpse, another patient in severe agony, and four others seriously ill with the disease. After taking over in 1851, Semmelweis virtually eliminated the disease. During 1851–1855, only eight patients died from childbed fever out of 933 births (0.85%).

Despite the impressive results, Semmelweis&#x27;s ideas were not accepted by the other obstetricians in Budapest. The professor of obstetrics at the University of Pest, Ede Flórián Birly, never adopted Semmelweis&#x27;s methods. He continued to believe that puerperal fever was due to uncleanliness of the bowel. Therefore, extensive purging was the preferred treatment.

After Birly died in 1854, Semmelweis applied for the position. So did Carl Braun—Semmelweis&#x27;s nemesis and successor as Johann Klein&#x27;s assistant in Vienna—and Braun received more votes from his Hungarian colleagues than Semmelweis did. Semmelweis was eventually appointed in 1855, but only because the Viennese authorities overruled the wishes of the Hungarians, as Braun did not speak Hungarian. As professor of obstetrics, Semmelweis instituted chlorine washings at the University of Pest maternity clinic. Once again, the results were impressive.

Semmelweis declined an offer in 1857 to become professor of obstetrics at the University of Zurich. The same year, Semmelweis married Mária Weidenhofer (1837–1910), 19 years his junior and the daughter of a successful merchant in Pest. They had five children.

===Response by the medical community===

Semmelweis&#x27;s views were much more favorably received in the United Kingdom than on the continent, but he was more often cited than understood. The British consistently regarded Semmelweis as having supported their theory of contagion. A typical example was W. Tyler Smith, who claimed that Semmelweis &quot;made out very conclusively&quot; that &quot;miasms derived from the dissecting room will excite puerperal disease.&quot; One of the first to respond to Semmelweis&#x27;s 1848 communications was James Young Simpson, who wrote a stinging letter. Simpson surmised that the British obstetrical literature must be totally unknown in Vienna, or Semmelweis would have known that the British had long regarded childbed fever as contagious and would have employed chlorine washing to protect against it.

In 1856, Semmelweis&#x27;s assistant Josef Fleischer reported the successful results of hand washing activities at St. Rochus and Pest maternity institutions in the&quot; Viennese Medical Weekly &quot;(&quot;Wiener Medizinische Wochenschrift&quot;). The editor remarked sarcastically that it was time people stopped being misled about the theory of chlorine washings. Two years later, Semmelweis published his own account of his work in an essay entitled &quot;The Etiology of Childbed Fever&quot;. Two years after that, he published a second essay, &quot;The Difference in Opinion between Myself and the English Physicians regarding Childbed Fever&quot;. In 1861, Semmelweis published his main work &quot;Die Ätiologie, der Begriff und die Prophylaxis des Kindbettfiebers&quot; (German for &quot;The Etiology, Concept and Prophylaxis of Childbed Fever&quot;). In his 1861 book, Semmelweis lamented the slow adoption of his ideas: &quot;Most medical lecture halls continue to resound with lectures on epidemic childbed fever and with discourses against my theories. [...] In published medical works my teachings are either ignored or attacked. The medical faculty at Würzburg awarded a prize to a monograph written in 1859 in which my teachings were rejected&quot;.

In a textbook, Carl Braun, Semmelweis&#x27;s successor as assistant in the first clinic, identified 30 causes of childbed fever; only the 28th of these was cadaverous infection. Other supposed causes included conception and pregnancy, uremia, pressure exerted on adjacent organs by the shrinking uterus, emotional traumata, mistakes in diet, chilling, and atmospheric epidemic influences.

Despite this opposition, Braun, who was Assistant in the First Division in the period April 1849 to summer 1853, maintained a relatively low mortality rate in the First Division, roughly consistent with the rate Semmelweis himself achieved, as mortality rates in the period April 1849 to end 1853 show. These results suggest that Braun continued, assiduously, to require the chlorine washings.

At a conference of German physicians and natural scientists, most of the speakers rejected his doctrine, including the celebrated Rudolf Virchow, who was a scientist of the highest authority of his time. Virchow&#x27;s great authority in medical circles contributed potently to Semmelweis&#x27; lack of recognition. Ede Flórián Birly, Semmelweis&#x27;s predecessor as Professor of Obstetrics at the University of Pest, never accepted Semmelweis&#x27;s teachings; he continued to believe that puerperal fever was due to uncleanliness of the bowel. August Breisky, an obstetrician in Prague, rejected Semmelweis&#x27;s book as &quot;naïve&quot; and he referred to it as &quot;the Koran of puerperal theology&quot;. Breisky objected that Semmelweis had not proved that puerperal fever and pyemia are identical, and he insisted that other factors beyond decaying organic matter certainly had to be included in the etiology of the disease. Carl Edvard Marius Levy, head of the Copenhagen maternity hospital and an outspoken critic of Semmelweis&#x27;s ideas, had reservations concerning the unspecific nature of cadaverous particles and that the supposed quantities were unreasonably small. In fact, Robert Koch later used precisely this fact to prove that various infecting materials contained living organisms which could reproduce in the human body; that is, since the poison could be neither chemical nor physical in operation, it must be biological.

It has been contended that Semmelweis could have had an even greater impact if he had managed to communicate his findings more effectively and avoid antagonising the medical establishment, even given the opposition from entrenched viewpoints.

==Breakdown and death==
After a number of unfavorable foreign reviews of his 1861 book, Semmelweis lashed out against his critics in a series of open letters. They were addressed to various prominent European obstetricians, including Späth, Scanzoni, Siebold, and to &quot;all obstetricians&quot;. They were &quot;highly polemical and superlatively offensive&quot;, at times denouncing his critics as irresponsible murderers or ignoramuses. He also called upon Siebold to arrange a meeting of German obstetricians somewhere in Germany to provide a forum for discussions on puerperal fever, where he would stay &quot;until all have been converted to his theory.&quot;

In mid-1865, his public behaviour became exasperating and embarrassing to his associates. He also began to drink immoderately; he spent progressively more time away from his family, sometimes in the company of a prostitute; and his wife noticed changes in his sexual behavior. On 13 July 1865, the Semmelweis family visited friends, and during the visit, Semmelweis&#x27;s behavior seemed particularly inappropriate.

Semmelweis&#x27;s alleged affliction has been a subject of some debate. According to K. Codell Carter, in his biography of Semmelweis, its exact nature cannot be determined:It is impossible to appraise the nature of Semmelweis&#x27;s disorder. ... It might have been Alzheimer&#x27;s disease, a type of dementia, which is associated with rapid cognitive decline and mood changes. It might have been third-stage syphilis, a then-common disease of obstetricians who examined thousands of women at gratis institutions, or it might have been emotional exhaustion from overwork and stress.In 1865, János Balassa wrote a document referring Semmelweis to a mental institution. On 30 July, Ferdinand Ritter von Hebra lured him, under the pretense of visiting one of Hebra&#x27;s &quot;new Institutes&quot;, to a Viennese insane asylum located in Lazarettgasse (&quot;Landes-Irren-Anstalt in der Lazarettgasse&quot;). Semmelweis surmised what was happening and tried to leave. He was severely beaten by several guards, secured in a straitjacket, and confined to a darkened cell. Apart from the straitjacket, treatments at the mental institution included dousing with cold water and administering castor oil, a laxative. He died after two weeks, on 13 August 1865, aged 47, from a gangrenous wound, due to an infection on his right hand which might have been caused by the struggle. The autopsy gave the cause of death as pyemia—blood poisoning.

Semmelweis was buried in Vienna on 15 August 1865. Only a few people attended the service. Brief announcements of his death appeared in a few medical periodicals in Vienna and Budapest. Although the rules of the Hungarian Association of Physicians and Natural Scientists specified that a commemorative address be delivered in honor of a member who had died in the preceding year, there was no address for Semmelweis; his death was never even mentioned.

János Diescher was appointed Semmelweis&#x27;s successor at the Pest University maternity clinic. Immediately, mortality rates increased sixfold to 6%, but the physicians of Budapest said nothing; there were no inquiries and no protests. Almost no one—either in Vienna or in Budapest—seems to have been willing to acknowledge Semmelweis&#x27;s life and work.

His remains were transferred to Budapest in 1891. On 11 October 1964, they were transferred once more to the house in which he was born. The house at 1-3 Apród utca is now a museum of medical history, honoring Ignaz Semmelweis.

==Legacy==

Semmelweis&#x27; advice on chlorine washings was probably more influential than he realized. Many doctors, particularly in Germany, appeared quite willing to experiment with the practical hand washing measures that he proposed—although virtually everyone rejected his basic and ground-breaking innovation: that the disease had only one cause, lack of cleanliness. Gustav Adolf Michaelis, a professor at a maternity institution in Kiel, replied positively to Semmelweis&#x27; suggestions, but eventually committed suicide, feeling responsible for the death of his own cousin, whom he had examined after she gave birth.

Only belatedly did his observational evidence gain wide acceptance. More than twenty years later, Louis Pasteur&#x27;s work on the germ theory of disease offered a &quot;theoretical&quot; explanation for Semmelweis&#x27; observations. Consequently, the Semmelweis story is often used in university courses with epistemology content, e.g. philosophy of science courses—demonstrating the virtues of empiricism or positivism and providing a historical account of which types of knowledge count as scientific (and thus accepted) knowledge, and which do not. C. Hempel, just to mention one, dedicated the first pages of his &quot;Philosophy of Natural Science&quot; to Semmelweis, arguing that the latter&#x27;s method is typical of contemporary scientific research, in that the doctor framed a series of hypotheses, verifying them through falsifying experiments in accordance with Hempel&#x27;s deductive-nomological model. It has been seen as an irony that Semmelweis&#x27; critics considered themselves positivists, but even positivism suffers problems in the face of theories which seem magical or superstitious, such as the idea that &quot;corpse particles&quot; might turn a person into a corpse, with no causal mechanism being stipulated, after a simple contact. To his contemporaries, Semmelweis seemed to be reverting to the speculative theories of earlier decades that were so repugnant to his positivist contemporaries.

Because his ideas were ridiculed and rejected by his contemporaries, the trait of human behaviour characterized by an automatic rejection of new knowledge because it contradicts entrenched norms, beliefs or paradigms, has been called the Semmelweis reflex.

<text>Mindelo is a port city in the northern part of the island of São Vicente in Cape Verde. Mindelo is also the seat of the parish of Nossa Senhora da Luz, and the municipality of São Vicente. The city is home to 93% of the entire island&#x27;s population. Mindelo is known for its colourful and animated carnival celebrations, with roots in Portuguese traditions later influenced by the Brazilian culture.

==History==

A settlement at Mindelo was founded in 1793 by the Portuguese. It was initially named &quot;Nossa Senhora da Luz&quot;, renamed &quot;Leopoldina&quot; around 1820 after the Queen consort. In 1838 it was renamed &quot;Mindelo&quot; after the 1832 Landing at Mindelo, north of Porto. It became a coal deposit for ships of the British East India Company in 1838, followed by the Royal Mail Steam Packet Company in 1850. The settlement became a town (&quot;vila&quot;) in 1858, and had 1,400 inhabitants then. It became a city (&quot;cidade&quot;) in 1879, and had 3,717 inhabitants then. In 1884 a submarine communications cable was laid between Europe, Africa, India and North America, making Mindelo an important communications centre for the British Empire.

From the beginning of the 20th century the port of Mindelo lost its importance for transatlantic navigation. Causes for this were the shift from coal to oil as fuel for ships, the rise of competing ports like Dakar and the Canary Islands and the lack of investment in port infrastructure. Between 1910 and 1940 there were several strikes in Mindelo, and on 7 June 1934 there were riots in the streets of Mindelo, caused by unemployment and poverty. One man was killed; several were injured.

Between 1940 and 1958 three prolonged periods of severe drought, combined with soil erosion and overgrazing, brought famine in Cape Verde.
