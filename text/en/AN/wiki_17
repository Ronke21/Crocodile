<text>American march music is march music written and/or performed in the United States. Its origins are those of European composers borrowing from the military music of the Ottoman Empire in place there from the 16th century. The American genre developed after the British model during the colonial and Revolutionary periods, then later as military ceremonials and for civilian entertainment events.

One of the earliest exponents of march music in America and its preeminent champion was John Philip Sousa, &quot;The March King&quot;; who revolutionized and standardized American march music during the 19th and early 20th centuries. Some of his most famous marches—&quot;Semper Fidelis&quot;, &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, &quot;The Liberty Bell March&quot;, and &quot;The Stars and Stripes Forever&quot;—are among the best known of historical American music and are especially revered by many Americans for their rousing strains and patriotic themes. His &quot;Stars and Stripes Forever&quot; features what is arguably the most famous piccolo obligato in all of music.

Other notable American composers of march music include Henry Fillmore – &quot;The Circus Bee&quot;;
Charles A. Zimmerman – &quot;Anchors Aweigh&quot;; W. Paris Chambers – &quot;Sweeney&#x27;s Cavalcade&quot;; Edwin E. Bagley – &quot;National Emblem March&quot;; Meredith Willson – &quot;Seventy-six Trombones&quot;; and George Gershwin – &quot;Strike Up the Band&quot;. Composers (from Europe or elsewhere) of march music popular in the US include: Johann Strauss Sr – &quot;Radetzky March&quot;; Kenneth J. Alford – &quot;Colonel Bogey March&quot;; Julius Fucik – &quot;Entry of the Gladiators&quot;; Edward Elgar – &quot;Pomp and Circumstance (No. 1)&quot;.

The forms of American march music typically are of three categories: the military march form, the regimental march form, and a general group containing recapitulation marches, &quot;four-step&quot; marches, and other diverse forms. All marches have at least three common elements, including: different (i.e., contrasting) sections called strains; several different melodies; and a &quot;trio&quot; section of strains/&quot;repeats&quot; that offers pronounced contrasts in phrasing. Most American marches use (seemingly) simple chord progressions, but—using chromatic harmonies, sevenths extensions, and secondary dominants—composers often complicated their marches with interesting chords and rapid chord changes.

==History==
The true &quot;march music era&quot; succeeded in the United States from the 1850s to the 1920s, and persisted through the 1940s as it slowly became shadowed by the coming of jazz in the U.S. Earlier marches by Handel, Mozart, and Beethoven tended to be parts of symphonies or movements in suites. Despite its age and history and its popular performance in the U.S., European march music generally is not thought of as typically American music.

===Marches and the military band===

The origins of European and American march music can be traced to the military music of the Ottoman Empire. The martial purposes of the music was to regulate army movements in the field by signalling orders, and to keep time during marching and maneuvers. The extensive use of percussion, especially cymbals, was also for psychological effect as, early on, their use was unknown in Western Europe and had the capacity to frighten opponents. (Indeed, the subsequent adoption of such percussive instruments in European &#x27;classical&#x27; music was by direct import from the Ottomans.) Europeans were first exposed to march music in the early 18th century, and interest continued to build into the 1800s when a vogue for Turkish marching bands swept through Europe. Pieces displaying the Turkish influence can be found in the works of Mozart, Haydn, and Beethoven, with a notable example being &quot;Turkish March&quot; by Beethoven (part of Op. 113: Overture and incidental music for &quot;Die Ruinen von Athen&quot;).

It was apparently during the latter gunpowder age that military march music was developed for armies to support troop morale by marching with music playing, whether from the melody of a fife or the beat of a drum, or both. American march music developed during the American Revolution and earlier colonial conflicts, in which a fife and snare drum would play while troops marched to battle. Thus it is said that march music is a military music.

The tradition of formed lines of soldiers marching into battle with music playing ended soon after the American Civil War in the mid 19th century; military bands continued to perform marches during ceremonial events, which spawned a new tradition of playing marches as a source of entertainment.

===Marches and the concert band===
During the late 19th and early 20th centuries, many U.S. towns, organizations, theaters, and even companies aspired to have their own band. These so-called community/concert bands performed at scheduled parades and concerts and played at impromptu events such as the popular gazebo concerts. Published marches were plentiful due to prolific American composers like John Philip Sousa, Karl L. King, and Henry Fillmore. Marches became a staple in the repertoire of these concert bands, explaining in part how the popularity of march music spread so rapidly across the country.

===Marches and the circus===
Marches were also popularized during this period by circus bands. The Ringling Brothers and Barnum &amp; Bailey circuses presented their bands performing live march music. Typically, they played a special variety of marches known descriptively as screamers, two-steps, and cakewalks. These tunes served to energize the crowd and focus attention on the circus acts being performed.
===Marches and the marching band===

The march music era in the U.S. saw the development of college and high school marching bands, which typically were organized to perform march music during half-time shows and pep-rallies. Composers often dedicated marches to a favored university band.

==John Philip Sousa==


American composer John Philip Sousa revolutionized American march music. His prolific production of quality marches greatly advanced the genre&#x27;s popularity. According to researcher Paul Bierley, Sousa&#x27;s marches were known for their simplicity and understatement with rousing counterpoint and overall energy.

Sousa standardized the military march form in America, see below. His marches are typically marked by a &quot;subdued&quot; trio—as in &quot;The Stars and Stripes Forever&quot;, where most of the performing band becomes subordinated to arguably the most famous piccolo obligato in all of music. Sousa&#x27;s magnum opus, &quot;The Stars and Stripes Forever&quot; was adopted in 1987 as the national march of the United States.

Sousa was prolific as both composer and orchestrator, writing 137 marches and more than 80 significant pieces, including operettas, overtures, suites, dances, and fantasies, and publishing some 322 arrangements of nineteenth-century western European symphonic works. He directed the design and production of his namesake instrument, the sousaphone, for its specialized adaption for use in a marching band. For its ease of carry and its forward-directed sound, the sousaphone is widely employed in marching bands and other musical venues.

==Musicality and the march music form==

This section discusses the format and other musical aspects of march music.

===Meter===
The majority of marches are written in duple meter, meaning they have two beats per measure (or two beats &quot;to the bar&quot;). Only a few marches are written otherwise (usually in 4/4 time), while still using the same two beats per measure tempo (see below).

Several meters are used in marches, as follows:

* time is called &quot;cut-time&quot;, indicated by the symbol . (This means common time cut-in-half, hence the name &quot;cut-time&quot;). Marches written in cut-time have a clear upbeat/downbeat feel, which in layman&#x27;s terms, means a strong &quot;oom-pah&quot; sound is heard. Many cut-time marches use heavy syncopation to create rhythmic interest. Because passing tones in most cases are shorter than marches in a different meter, cut-time marches tend to sound faster. An example of a cut-time march is &quot;Stars and Stripes Forever&quot; by Sousa.
* time marches are played &quot;in two&quot;, meaning the dotted quarter-note gets the beat and there are two of them in a measure. time is used when the composer wants a &quot;triplet&quot; feel in the beat; that is, marches produce a more dance-like, swing beat that is more prominent and exaggerated than its cut-time cousin. A march can be recognized immediately by its common &quot;da-bah-da-bah&quot; or &quot;DA-da-DA-da&quot; sound. An example of a march is &quot;The Washington Post March&quot;, also by Sousa.
* time is much like cut-time, except fewer notes appear in a measure, as here the quarter-note gets the beat instead of the half-note; but there are still only two beats per measure. Marches in time typically are written for the performer as it is easier to read at faster tempos. Many European marches are written in , and almost all American galops as well. Galops are played at a very fast tempo, sounding as if there was one beat to the bar.
* time marches are rare. However, some slow marches such as dirges use it. Robert Jager uses in his quick march &quot;Stars and Bars&quot;.

===Tempo===
The tempo of marches varies significantly. While most bands perform marches in their own tempo, most marches are quick (faster than a waltz, as fast as or slower than a polka). As alluded to before, most march composers did not designate a specific tempo on their manuscripts. However, that is not to say the march music composer is random with his/her tempo while conducting the march. For example, John Philip Sousa conducted his marches using around 120 beats per minute. Most European march composers, however, conducted their marches in a slower style, using around 100 beats per minute. There are, however, many and notable exceptions: see concert march and screamer.

===Key===
For the sake of band performers, especially altos, marches are typically written in flat keys. The keys of Concert F, B♭, E♭, and A♭ are the most frequently used. (NOTE: These refer to the key the march in, not the modulated key in the trio (see below)).

===March music forms===
Most marches follow a fairly strict structure known as the march music form, the origins of which appear to be derived from the sonata form, as these two forms share similar ideas of contrasting sections.
The period of early development of the true march music form denotes the start of the march music era in the US by the 1850s; eventually the form was standardized by John Philip Sousa.
While the form varies among different styles of march music, all marches have these common elements:
*Different sections, called strains.
*Several separate melodies.
*A middle section, dubbed the Trio, that features contrasting melodic material and is usually lighter in texture and more lyrical in style. After the Trio the main section is recapitulated. 

Following are descriptions of various march forms that have been popular and are/were frequently used by march music composers.

====Military march form====

The military march form is largely credited to John Philip Sousa, who came to be known as &quot;The March King&quot;. He standardized the &quot;military&quot; form (as compared to the &quot;regimental&quot; form), using it in over half of his marches.

The military march form is: I-AA-BB-C(C)-Br-C-Br-C(Grandioso); or, in more generic code: I-AA-BB-CCDCDC.
The first section of a military march is called the &quot;introduction&quot; (I) or fanfare; it is typically 4, 8, or 16 bars long and played in marcato style, using forte (loud) dynamics and chromatic alterations to catch the attention of the listener. The introduction is usually the shortest section of a march and is almost never omitted. Still, examples of marches written without an intro include &quot;Bugles and Drums&quot; and &quot;The Footlifter&quot;. 

Introductions to marches vary but some standard practices include: (a) &quot;tutti&quot; unison (&quot;The Washington Post&quot;), (b) &quot;tutti&quot; rhythmic unison with contrary motion (&quot;The Thunderer&quot;), (c) &quot;tutti&quot; rhythm unison in four-part harmony (&quot;Semper Fi&quot;), and (d) four-part independent (&quot;The Klaxon&quot;). The introduction is commonly based on the dominant key to create clarity of key as centered in the first strain, (see harmonic progressions below). Generally, the intro is not repeated, but it is in some marches: &quot;Bravura&quot;, &quot;The Rifle Regiment&quot;, and &quot;Washington Grays&quot;. The introduction generally starts in major because marches typically are in major keys, but there are marches with introductions in minor keys, including &quot;Gladiator&quot;, &quot;The Picadore&quot;, &quot;Nobles of the Mystic Shrine&quot;, and &quot;Rolling Thunder&quot;.
The next section is commonly called the &quot;first strain&quot;, as it is the first prominent melody of the march. The first strain is typically 8 or 16 bars long with 4-measure phrases. The first strain can be in either major or minor mode and can use any variety of dynamics, instrumentation and modulations. Typically this strain utilizes similar motifs (as opposed to contrasting motifs—see trio, below) in its phrasing, and it sounds more rhythmically straightforward than the following section.

After the first playing of the strain, it is repeated once, sometimes with added parts such as counter-melodies. The first strain may be repeated yet again after the second strains, particularly if it (first strain) is in minor. Karl L. King frequently arranged this style, as did Henry Fillmore with his trombone smears. Examples include &quot;Peacemaker March&quot;, &quot;New York Hippodrome&quot;, &quot;Caravan Club March&quot;, &quot;Trombone King&quot;, &quot;Lassus Trombone&quot;, &quot;Royal Decree&quot;, and Price&#x27;s &quot;March of Youth&quot;.
The &quot;second strain&quot; is usually 16 bars long and is the second primary melody of the march. However, in marches like &quot;Solid Men to the Front&quot;, and Sousa&#x27;s Untitled March, the second strain is 32 bars in length. Some marches commonly play the first run of the second strain quietly and the second run loudly; these include: &quot;The Stars and Stripes Forever&quot;, &quot;His Honor&quot;, &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, &quot;Hands Across the Sea&quot;, &quot;On the Mall&quot;, and others, particularly by Sousa.

The second strain may use somewhat different instrumentation or may alter the relative dynamics of the different parts. The melody is normally played with the basses, i.e., the low brass and low woodwinds). This strain typically uses 4-measure phrases, but with greatly varied motifs, which causes the melodies to sound more &quot;stretched out&quot;. For example, many marches use more whole notes in the second strain than the first—as can be heard in &quot;The Stars and Stripes Forever&quot;. Like the first, the second strain is usually repeated once, sometimes twice; but some marches, including &quot;Emblem of Freedom&quot;, &quot;Cyrus the Great&quot; and the &quot;Melody Shop&quot;, omit this repeat.

=====The trio and repeats=====
In some marches, a short &quot;introduction to the trio&quot; is heard, often a repeat of the opening introduction, or it may be a different melody played by the whole band, a fanfare by the brasses—or a &quot;percussion soli&quot; (drum roll-off) as heard in &quot;Semper Fidelis&quot; by Sousa. Another example of a trio introduction is found in &quot;Twin Eagle Strut&quot; by Zane Van Auken.

The third (or technically fourth or fifth) primary melody in a march is called the &quot;trio&quot;, which usually is the &quot;main melody&quot; of the march. It typically is played legato style in a softer dynamic and features woodwinds more than brass. Sousa often used clarinets and euphoniums in lower tenor register in his trios. This trio strain is the most contrasting of the sections, often containing variations of motifs heard in the previous two strains.

The trio melody may be repeated once at a softer dynamic, or may not be repeated at all. Typically, it is played quietly for the first or second playthrough, then features piccolos (or flutes, or other woodwinds) playing over the trio melody. In almost all cases the trio now modulates to the subdominant key of the march, meaning one flat is added to the key signature. The key is now flatter and this repeat will, with softer instrumentation, offer a relaxing feel from the previous volume. The contrast makes the trio more memorable as the new key is maintained to the end of the strain. (For marches starting in minor keys, the trio usually modulates to the relative major.)

Next comes the breakstrain or &quot;breakup strain&quot; (sometimes called the &quot;dogfight&quot; or &quot;interlude&quot;), making it the fourth melody heard. This strain is loud, intense, and marcato. Its purpose can be found in its title, as it literally breaks a gap between the trio sections, providing contrast to the usually softer trio melodies and generating excitement for the listener. Most breakstrains resemble a conversation between the upper woodwinds and the low brass. The final measures typically contain tension-building chords or chromatic motifs.

The breakstrain is usually 16 bars long, as in the case of &quot;Hands Across the Sea&quot;, but marches vary: &quot;The Washington Post&quot; and &quot;The Interlochen Bowl&quot; have eight-bar breakstrains, where &quot;On the Mall&quot; and &quot;The Purple Pageant&quot; have 12-bar, and &quot;The Thunderer&quot; has a 15-bar breakstrain. &quot;The Stars and Stripes Forever&quot; has a 24-bar breakstrain.

After the breakstrain, the trio is repeated again. The trio after the breakstrain is usually played in the same style as the first, but sometimes counter-melodies or obbligatos are added to these latter runs of the trio. Now the breakstrain is played again and the march moves to the final trio.

The final trio is known as the grandioso, &quot;trio grandioso&quot; or &quot;trio&quot;, which typically, as the grand finale, is played through much more loudly than previous runs of the trio. It sometimes adds yet another counter-melody or obligato (such as the one in &quot;The Stars and Stripes Forever&quot;) and uses all instrumental sections of the band, bringing everything to a close. The grandioso is the most exciting section of the march; its role is to make the trio melody memorable to the listener.

=====The stinger=====

The last measure of the march sometimes contains a &quot;stinger&quot;, a I chord played in unison on the downbeat after a quarter rest. Most, but not all, marches carry a stinger. &quot;Semper Fidelis&quot; is a famous march that does not have an ending stinger when not recapitulated back to the beginning of the march (see below). Most marches end at forte volume (loud); one that does not is Sousa&#x27;s &quot;Manhattan Beach&quot;, which ends fading away.

In some military marches, such as &quot;U.S. Field Artillery March&quot; (the &quot;Caissons Song&quot;) by John Philip Sousa, there is only one &quot;playing&quot; (or run) of the breakstrain, resulting in only two playings of the trio. Apart from &quot;On the Mall&quot;, &quot;the Chimes of Liberty&quot;, and a couple of others, Goldman&#x27;s marches in the military form had only two playings (two runs) of the trio.

Examples of military marches include &quot;The Stars and Stripes Forever&quot; by John Philip Sousa, &quot;Barnum and Bailey&#x27;s Favorite&quot; by Karl L. King, and &quot;On the Mall&quot; by Edwin F. Goldman

====Regimental march form====
The regimental march form as developed in the US is perhaps older than the military form; it is also called the &quot;review march&quot;. There are some key differences between the two styles.

The regimental march form is: I-AA-BB-CC-DD

The introduction, first strain, and second strain are typically that of a military march, but some use a longer (or much longer) introduction.

After the trio the regimental march follows with a strain (D) instead of a breakstrain. This new strain also uses a modulated key and typically relates to the second strain; it is almost always repeated once.

The regimental march is considerably shorter than a military march for lack of a third repeat of the trio and breakstrain; thus, it is preferred for performances by marching bands in parades—hence the name &quot;review march&quot;.

Examples of regimental marches include Sousa&#x27;s &quot;Semper Fidelis&quot; (when not recapitulated back to the beginning of the march – see below), &quot;Men of Ohio&quot; by Henry Fillmore, &quot;Bugles and Drums&quot; by Goldman, and &quot;Robinson&#x27;s Grand Entry&quot; by Karl L. King.

====Other forms and styles====
Some earlier marches presented a simple, &quot;four-part&quot;, form: I-AA-BB-CC.

Typically those marches, having neither a breakstrain nor &#x27;D&#x27; section, were written for marching bands or youth bands. The piece was ended by simply playing one repeat of the trio, usually in the grandioso style. Examples include &quot;Our Director&quot; by F.E. Bigelow and &quot;Gallant Marines&quot; by Karl L. King. Henry Fillmore and Karl King often used the four-part style in their marches. Sousa rarely used this style.

Sousa&#x27;s marches of the early 1890s (including &quot;High School Cadets&quot; and &quot;Manhattan Beach&quot;), used an introduction unique to his career.

Many earlier American and European marches, using either the four-part or the regimental form, recapitulate back to the beginning of the march. Typically, after completing the final trio (or &#x27;D&#x27; section), the march is re-started; repeats are ignored, and the piece is ended after the second strain. Codas are rare, but sometimes used; examples: &quot;Riders for the Flag&quot; by Sousa and &quot;Children of the Shrine&quot; by James Swearingen.

The tradition of writing recapitulating marches ended near the start of the American march music era. John Philip Sousa abandoned this technique except with his march &quot;On Parade&quot;—one of his few circus marches. Victor Herbert was one of the last American composers to write recapitulating marches. Examples include &quot;Under the Double Eagle&quot; by Wagner and &quot;The Serenade&quot; by Victor Herbert.

===Phrasing===
The basic (and vague) definition of a march describes a piece of music based upon a regular, repeated drum or rhythmic pattern—which means a march is most recognizable by its phrasing. Almost all quickstep marches consist of four-measure, or four-bar, phrases typically ending with a whole note (that either creates or resolves melodic tension, see chord progression), followed by a pickup note. Thus it is said that this &quot;basic&quot; framework is what makes marches melodically &quot;pleasing&quot;. 

Some marches have more noticeable phrases than others. Marches by Karl King have very clear-cut phrases with distinctive whole notes and pickups. In contrast, John Philip Sousa used practically seamless phrasing.

===Chords and harmonic progression===

The harmonic progressions of American march music are well-grounded in the archetypal harmonic techniques of the times in which they were written. In summary, most American marches use seemingly simple chord progressions for the sake of creating a melodically pleasing sound, however composers often complemented their marches with interesting chords and rapid chord changes—using chromatic harmonies, sevenths extensions, and secondary dominants.

A detailed discussion of chord progressions follows. (Recommended reading in conjunction with these details: Chord progression and Scale degree.)

Here is code for the chord progressions of the first strain of &quot;Semper Fidelis&quot; by John Philip Sousa. Note, each bar pair (e.g., |G7|), represents one of a total of 16 measures.
*|G7| |G7| |C| |C| |G7| |G7| |C| |C| |G7| |G7||C| |C|G7/B| |G| |G| |D7||G7|

The first strain begins with a very simple V-I progression (see chord progression basics), creating a wave-like sense of tension and relief within the chord. The use of dominant seven chords makes the V chord stronger and is used in many marches. In the middle of the measure, before the trumpet &quot;fanfare&quot;, the chord alters to C♯dim7 instead of remaining on C. This leads to a G7 chord (rather than to a D minor chord), and is an example of a common-tone diminished seventh chord. This chord &quot;leads into&quot; the V chord (G), then to a D7 chord. Here a D chord in the key of C would be the ii chord (as all ii chords must be minor). But the D chord here is &quot;not&quot; minor. Rather, it is known as a &quot;secondary dominant&quot;, i.e., a dominant chord borrowed from different key. (A secondary dominant naturally leads into a chord other than the first (or I chord); here it leads into the V (G7)).

Here is code for chord progressions of the second strain. 
*|C| |F|G7| |C| |C| |G7| |G7| |C| |C|G7| |C| |F|E7| |Am| |A♭7| |C| |C| |G| |C|

As with most second strains of march music, &quot;rapidly changing&quot; chords are featured: a legacy of Sousa. The IV chord is used here in marches to create an &quot;uplifting&quot; and lyrical sound which tends either to resolve back to the I chord—or to proceed into the V chord, as it does here. At the tenth measure, (|F|E7|), which restates the main theme, Sousa uses a &quot;deceptive&quot; chord change. Instead of using F to G7 to C (as in measures two and three), the chord goes from the IV (F) &quot;to&quot; V7/VI (i.e., E7), &quot;to&quot; the VI (Am). The main melodic theme uses the same notes, but revolves around a different harmonic progression. Sousa then uses his trademark chromatic-accented chord A♭7, (a half-step below the previous chord) to create a &quot;wall of tension&quot; that quickly resolves into the I chord.

Another chromatic-accented chord change often used by march music composers is inverting a I chord with a lowered third and raised fifth. For example, an E major chord (the I in the key of E) would be followed by a B major chord, (which is an E chord with a lowered third and raised fifth). Unlike secondary or &quot;borrowed&quot; dominants, this chord does not have logical harmonic functions other than to add texture and interest.

==Difficulty of performance==
The actual difficulty of performance varies considerably among marches. When first being written for grade school bands then being organized throughout the country, most marches were fairly modest in difficulty. Soon however, there were composers writing scores for (their own) bands that required professional to almost virtuosic skill to perform—some composers noting that any given march might be difficult to play &quot;perfectly&quot;, that is, with all the correct expressions and articulations and with steady tempo.
A grading system of difficulty of performance as adapted from Norman Smith&#x27;s &quot;March Music Notes&quot; follows.

*Grade 1: Minimum difficulty. Suited for beginner bands first approaching music; may be a simple etude or ditty from an instructional book.
*Grade 2: Also for beginner bands, but more developed, using different notes and rhythms. Instrumental ranges are comfortable, most requiring minimal endurance. Some scores follow the standard march form, but most are abbreviated, or of a simpler concert march form.
*Grade 3: At standard march difficulty. Usually in full march form, and requiring moderate technique and endurance skills. Instrumental ranges are usually intermediate, and likely containing chromatic notes, obbligatos, and counter-melodies. Many parade marches contain Grade 3 scoring, examples being &quot;The Thunderer&quot; and &quot;The National Emblem&quot;.
*Grade 4: Moderately difficult, containing many technically challenging parts and some syncopation. This grade requires a considerable amount of practice/rehearsal of most high school bands; and typically requires a disciplined, complete ensemble for proper performance, as it contains intricate harmonies and counter-melodies. Example scores of this difficulty are &quot;The Stars and Stripes Forever&quot; and &quot;Barnum and Bailey&#x27;s Favorite&quot;.
*Grade 5: Considerably difficult; usually originally written for professional or virtuoso players such as those in a circus band, as screamers are typical of this grade. Grade 5s contain woodwind obbligatos or chromatic runs and will test the range of any player; they have very quick tempos, as well as complicated rhythms and syncopation. Example marches are &quot;Entry of the Gladiators&quot;, &quot;Washington Grays&quot;, and &quot;Battle of Shiloh&quot;.
*Grade 6: A rare difficulty. Usually found in greater works such as a symphonies, which typically contain mixed meters and intricate rhythms and harmonies.

==Instrumentation==

A &#x27;correct&#x27; general description of the original instrumentation of (American) march bands is unlikely, as these bands were extremely varied through the 19th and early 20th centuries and most march music was written by composers for their own bands. Thus, almost all bands accumulated marches in repertoire that were written for their specific instrumentation. 

On the other hand, marches were also written for specific instrumentation to be determined &quot;locally&quot;. That is, composers simply wrote a piano version of a march which was given to the publisher to arrange the different parts for concert or marching band, or orchestra, etc.

Still, modern repertoire and arrangements are typically scored for:

*C piccolo
*C flute
*oboe
*bassoon
*B clarinet
*E alto clarinet
*B bass clarinet
*E alto saxophone
*B tenor saxophone
*E baritone saxophone
*Trumpet in B
*Cornet
*Euphonium
*French horn (in F)
*Trombone
*Tuba
*Timpani
*Keyboard instrument (usually glockenspiel)
*Snare drum
*Bass drum
*Clash cymbals

===Assignments and roles of instrument sections===
Generally, the several instrument sections of an American march band serve the various roles of performing a typical march as follows: 
*Trumpets and cornets almost always carry the melody. They also may be scored various &quot;flourishes&quot; and &quot;calls&quot; for effect.
*Clarinets, flutes, and piccolos also carry the melody, and are assigned obbligatos and other integral lines.
*The tubas and other basses usually carry the bassline, providing the &quot;oom&quot; of the &quot;oom-pah&quot; sound of cut time marches (see French horns, below); they also provide the tonal foundation of the march, and assist to control volume and tempo.
*French horns almost always carry the rhythmic backup of a march. For example, in cut time marches, they are typically assigned upbeats to provide the &quot;pah&quot; for the stylistic &quot;oom-pah&quot; sound. In 6/8 marches, French horns play on: beat 1, the &quot;li&quot; of 1, beat 2, and the &quot;li&quot; of 2, (or, 1–la–li–2–la–li, see solmization); thus, the measure is one eighth note, then an eighth rest, then two eighth notes, an eighth rest, then a final eighth note.
*The euphonium often carries the melody, as in the trio of &quot;The Stars and Stripes Forever&quot;, and may be assigned other roles.

<doc id="76025" wikidata="Q184542" url="?curid=76025" title="Powers of Ten (film)">
<text>The Powers of Ten films are two short American documentary films written and directed by Charles and Ray Eames. Both works depict the relative scale of the Universe according to an order of magnitude (or logarithmic scale) based on a factor of ten, first expanding out from the Earth until the entire universe is surveyed, then reducing inward until a single atom and its quarks are observed.

==History and background==
The first film, A Rough Sketch for a Proposed Film Dealing with the Powers of Ten and the Relative Size of Things in the Universe, was a prototype and was completed in 1968; the second film, Powers of Ten: A Film Dealing with the Relative Size of Things in the Universe and the Effect of Adding Another Zero, was completed in 1977.

The &quot;Powers of Ten&quot; films were adaptations of the book &quot;Cosmic View&quot; (1957) by Dutch educator Kees Boeke. Both films, and a book based on the second film, follow the form of the Boeke original, adding color and photography to the black and white drawings employed by Boeke in his seminal work.

The 1977 film has a number of changes from the prototype, including being entirely in color, moving the starting location from Miami to Chicago, removing the relativistic (time) dimension, introducing an additional two powers of ten at each extreme, a change in narrator from Judith Bronowski to Philip Morrison, and much-improved graphics.

== Synopsis ==

=== 1968 version ===
This version of the film has two clocks in the corner showing the comparison between the viewer&#x27;s time and that of Earth time. As the viewer&#x27;s speed increases, Earth time, relative to the viewer, also increases.
It was installed in the Smithsonian Institution&#x27;s National Air and Space Museum&#x27;s Life in the Universe gallery at the time of the museum&#x27;s opening in 1976, until the gallery&#x27;s closure in 1978.

There is also a 1968 National Film Board of Canada film entitled &quot;Cosmic Zoom&quot; which covers the same subject using animation. It is wordless, using sped-up music during the return trips to normal size.

=== 1977 version ===
The film begins with an overhead view of a man and woman picnicking in a park at the Chicago lakefront — a overhead image of the figures on a blanket surrounded by food and books they brought with them, one of them being &quot;The Voices of Time&quot; by J. T. Fraser. The man (played by Swiss designer Paul Bruhwiler) then sleeps, while the woman (played by Eames staffer Etsu Garfias) starts to read one of the books. The viewpoint, accompanied by expository voiceover by Philip Morrison, then slowly zooms out to a view across (or in scientific notation). The zoom-out continues (at a rate of one power of ten per 10 seconds), to a view of (where they are shown to be in Burnham Park, near Soldier Field, then (where we see the entirety of Chicago), and so on, increasing the perspective and continuing to zoom out to a field of view of , or a field of view 100 million light years across. The camera then zooms back in at a rate of a power of ten per 2 seconds to the picnic, and then slows back down to its original rate into the man&#x27;s hand, to views of negative powers of ten: 10 centimeters (), and so forth, revealing a white blood cell and zooming in on it—until the camera comes to quarks in a proton of a carbon atom at .

== Reception and legacy ==
Physicist Robbert Dijkgraaf noted: &quot;It is a brilliant short documentary [...]. If I wanted to show an alien how we view the world, I would show this movie&quot;.

In 1998, &quot;Powers of Ten&quot;, the 1977 version, was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant&quot;.

<text>President McKinley Inauguration Footage is the name given to two different short documentary films which were combined as one. The two titles are &quot;President McKinley Taking the Oath&quot; and &quot;President McKinley and Escort Going to the Capitol&quot;. The two show President William McKinley arriving at the United States Capitol in order to take the oath of office of the president of the United States as part of his second inauguration on March 4, 1901.

Both were produced by the Edison Manufacturing Company, and in 2000 the United States Library of Congress deemed the two &quot;culturally significant&quot; and selected them for preservation in the National Film Registry.

== Production ==

Edison&#x27;s crew shot the films on location on March 4, 1901, and released their footage less than two weeks later. The notes stated they had a camera and were &quot;within twenty feet of the President&#x27;s carriage when it passed,&quot; giving the general public an unprecedentedly intimate view of a United States President. The crew captured their images on several campers placed on rudimentary tripods that made it difficult to pan or tilt while filming.

The cinematography is believed to have been the responsibility of Edwin S. Porter and James H. White.

== Release ==
Press accounts described the film receiving &quot;great applause&quot; and causing &quot;pandemonium&quot; during its screenings.

<doc id="76028" wikidata="Q1193766" url="?curid=76028" title="The Prisoner of Zenda">
<text>The Prisoner of Zenda is an 1894 adventure novel by Anthony Hope, in which the King of Ruritania is drugged on the eve of his coronation and thus is unable to attend the ceremony. Political forces within the realm are such that, in order for the king to retain the crown, his coronation must proceed. Fortuitously, an English gentleman on holiday in Ruritania who resembles the monarch is persuaded to act as his political decoy in an effort to save the unstable political situation of the interregnum.

A sequel, &quot;Rupert of Hentzau&quot;, was published in 1898 and is included in some editions of &quot;The Prisoner of Zenda&quot;. The popularity of the novels inspired the Ruritanian romance genre of literature, film, and theatre that features stories set in a fictional country, usually in Central or Eastern Europe, for example Graustark from the novels of George Barr McCutcheon, and the neighbouring countries of Syldavia and Borduria in the Tintin comics.

==Synopsis==
On the eve of the coronation of Rudolf V of Ruritania, he encounters his distant relative, English nobleman Rudolf Rassendyll, come to witness the festivities. The two men look very much alike. The future king and his loyal attendants, Colonel Sapt and Fritz von Tarlenheim, wine and dine their new acquaintance at a hunting lodge. However, Rudolf V&#x27;s younger half-brother Michael, Duke of Strelsau, sees to it he is presented a bottle of drugged wine. His friends cannot rouse him the next morning.

Not showing up for the coronation would prove disastrous, but Sapt believes that fate has sent Rassendyll to Ruritania. He persuades the Englishman to impersonate the King. They hide the King in the cellar of the lodge and proceed to the capital. The ceremony goes off without a hitch. However, when they go to retrieve the real King Rudolf, they find that he has been abducted.

Rassendyll must continue his deception, but at least Duke Michael cannot unmask him without incriminating himself. While Sapt searches for the King, Rassendyll becomes acquainted with the beautiful Princess Flavia, who is beloved by the people. He learns that everyone expects them to wed. Despite himself, he falls in love with her, and she with him.

Help comes from an unexpected source. Antoinette de Mauban, Michael&#x27;s mistress, does not want to lose him to Flavia. She confirms that the King is being held in the castle at Zenda. Rassendyll, Sapt, von Tarlenheim and ten picked men go &quot;hunting&quot; nearby. An attempt is made on Rassendyll&#x27;s life by three of the Six, Duke Michael&#x27;s most trusted henchmen. When that fails, Rupert Hentzau, one of the Six, visits Rassendyll to present Michael&#x27;s offer of a million crowns to leave the country. When Rassendyll turns him down, Rupert flees after trying to kill him with a dagger. Rassendyll is only wounded in the shoulder.

They take captive Johann, a servant working at the castle, and bribe him into telling all he knows. At the first sign of an assault, King Rudolf is to be killed, and his corpse dropped secretly into the water. Michael would be no worse off than before, as Rassendyll could hardly accuse him of regicide.

A few days pass. Rassendyll swims the moat at night to reconnoiter. He kills a sentry in a boat. He hears King Rudolf talking to one of his captors, then returns to his friends. However, they are discovered by three of the Six. Two of the Six are killed, at the cost of three of Sapt&#x27;s men, but Rupert reaches the safety of the castle.

Later, they encounter Rupert again, this time accompanying the body of his friend, one of the Six killed earlier. Rupert privately makes another proposal: Have Sapt and von Tarlenheim lead an assault on the castle. With them and Duke Michael all dead (with Rupert&#x27;s assistance), the two of them would have all the spoils to themselves. Rupert reveals a contributing motive; he is attracted to Antoinette de Mauban. Rassendyll turns him down.

More information is extracted from Johann, including the alarming news that King Rudolf is very ill: Ill enough for Duke Michael to send for a doctor. Rassendyll offers Johann another large bribe to open the front door at two in the morning. Rassendyll enters the castle by stealth before then, then watches as Rupert, caught trying to force himself on Antoinette, stabs the outraged Michael. Then, outnumbered by Michael&#x27;s men, he dives into the moat. Rassendyll kills one of the Six and takes the key to the cell holding King Rudolf. The King is guarded by Detchard and Bersonin. Rassendyll slays Bersonin, but Detchard hurries to murder the King. The doctor sacrifices himself, grappling with Detchard before being murdered, giving Rassendyll time to catch up to and kill Detchard, with the King&#x27;s assistance.

Rupert appears at the drawbridge, defying Michael&#x27;s men, and challenges Michael to fight him for Antoinette. However Antoinette cries out that Duke Michael is dead. Rassendyll has obtained a pistol, but cannot bring himself to shoot Rupert. Antoinette has no such qualms, but she misses, and her target leaps into the moat. Then Rassendyll hears Sapt&#x27;s voice he realizes that reinforcements have arrived. With King Rudolf no longer needing his protection, Rassendyll pursues Rupert. Rupert allows him to catch up. Before their duel can reach a conclusion, however, von Tarlenheim arrives, and Rupert races away on horseback.

When Princess Flavia learns, by accident, about Rudolf Rassendyll, she faints. King Rudolf is restored to his throne, but the lovers are trapped by duty and honour, and must part.

==Adaptations==
The novel has been adapted many times, mainly for film but also stage, musical, operetta, radio, and television. Probably the best-known version is the 1937 Hollywood film. The charismatic but Machiavellian Rupert of Hentzau has been interpreted by Ramon Novarro (1922), Douglas Fairbanks Jr. (1937), and James Mason (1952).

===Stage===
* &quot;The Prisoner of Zenda&quot; (1895–96) was the first adaptation, a stage play by Edward Rose. It opened in New York in 1895 starring E.H. Sothern and the next year in the West End in London starring George Alexander and Evelyn Millard.
* &quot;Princess Flavia&quot; (1925), an operetta with the score by Sigmund Romberg.
* &quot;Zenda&quot; (1963), a musical that closed on the road prior to a scheduled opening on Broadway. Adapted from the 1925 &quot;Princess Flavia&quot;.

=== Film ===
* &quot;The Prisoner of Zenda&quot; (1913): Starring James K. Hackett, Beatrice Beckley, David Torrence, Fraser Coalter, William R. Randall and Walter Hale. Adapted by Hugh Ford and directed by Ford and Edwin S. Porter, it was produced by Adolph Zukor and was the first production of the Famous Players Film Company.
* &quot;The Prisoner of Zenda&quot; (1915): Starring Henry Ainley, Gerald Ames, George Bellamy, Marie Anita Bozzi, Jane Gail, Arthur Holmes-Gore, Charles Rock and Norman Yates. It was adapted by W. Courtney Rowden and directed by George Loane Tucker.
* &quot;The Prisoner of Zenda&quot; (1922): Starring Ramón Novarro, Lewis Stone, Alice Terry, Robert Edeson, Stuart Holmes, Malcolm McGregor and Barbara La Marr. It was adapted by Mary O&#x27;Hara and directed by Rex Ingram.
* &quot;The Prisoner of Zenda&quot; (1937): Starring Ronald Colman as Rassendyll and Rudolph, Madeleine Carroll as Princess Flavia, Raymond Massey as Michael, Douglas Fairbanks Jr. as Rupert of Hentzau, C. Aubrey Smith as Colonel Zapt and David Niven as Captain Fritz von Tarlenheim. David O. Selznick decided to produce the film, partly as a comment on the Edward VIII abdication crisis, and it was directed by John Cromwell. Of the many film adaptations, this is considered by many to be the definitive version. Leslie Halliwell puts it at No. 590 of all the films ever made, saying that the &quot;splendid schoolboy adventure story&quot; of the late Victorian novel is &quot;perfectly transferred to the screen&quot;, and quotes a 1971 comment by John Cutts that the film becomes more &quot;fascinating and beguiling&quot; as time goes by. &quot;Halliwell&#x27;s Film Guide 2008&quot; calls it &quot;one of the most entertaining films to come out of Hollywood&quot;.
* &quot;The Prisoner of Zenda&quot; (1952): Starring Stewart Granger, Deborah Kerr, Louis Calhern, Jane Greer, Lewis Stone, Robert Douglas, James Mason and Robert Coote. Stone, who played the lead in the 1922 version, had a minor role in this remake. It was adapted by Edward Rose, (dramatisation) Wells Root, John L. Balderston, Noel Langley and Donald Ogden Stewart (additional dialogue, originally uncredited). It was directed by Richard Thorpe. It is a shot-for-shot copy of the 1937 film, the only difference being that it was made in Technicolor. Halliwell judges it &quot;no match for the happy inspiration of the original&quot;.
* &quot;The Great Race&quot; (1965): A comic interlude in the film sees the characters, after driving across Asia, enter the tiny kingdom of Carpania, whose alcoholic and foppish Crown Prince Friedrich Hapnick is the spitting image of Professor Fate. Plotters under the leadership of Baron Rolfe von Stuppe and General Kuhster kidnap the Prince, Fate, Max, and Maggie. Max escapes and joins Leslie to rescue the others. Fate is forced to masquerade as the Prince during the coronation so that the rebels can gain control of the kingdom. Leslie and Max overcome Von Stuppe&#x27;s henchmen and confront Von Stuppe. Following a climactic sword fight with Leslie, Von Stuppe attempts escape by leaping to a waiting boat, but bursts the hull and sinks it. Leslie and Max return the real Prince to the capital in time to defeat Kuhster&#x27;s plan for a military coup. Fate, still masquerading as Prince Hapnick, takes refuge in a bakery but falls into a huge cake. A pie fight ensues involving the racers, the Prince&#x27;s men and the conspirators. The five racers, covered in pie filling, depart Carpania with King Friedrich&#x27;s best wishes.
* &quot;The Prisoner of Zenda&quot; (1979): A comic version, starring Peter Sellers, Lynne Frederick, Lionel Jeffries, Elke Sommer, Gregory Sierra, Jeremy Kemp, Catherine Schell, Simon Williams and Stuart Wilson. It was adapted by Dick Clement and Ian La Frenais and directed by Richard Quine. In this version, Sellers plays the King, his father, and the other main character Syd Frewin, a London Hansom Cab driver, who finds himself employed as a double to the King and eventually changes places with him permanently.
*&quot;The Prisoner of Zenda&quot; (1988), an Australian animated version for children, starring Robert Coleby, Claire Crowther, David Whitney, Franc Violi, and Walter Sullivan, with a screenplay by Leonard Lee, produced by Burbank Animation Studios.

==== International ====
* &quot;Jhinder Bandi&quot; (ঝিন্দের বন্দী-&#x27;The Prisoner of Jhind&#x27;) is a Bengali adaptation (in Indian/Bengali context) by Sharadindu Bandyopadhyay. The author wrote &#x27;I admit the source by its name&#x27; (নাম দিয়াই বংশপরিচয় স্বীকার করিলাম) meaning, he named the fictional province, &quot;Jhind&quot; in tribute to &quot;Zenda&quot; in the original novel.
* &quot;Jhinder Bandi&quot; (1961): a Bengali film directed by Tapan Sinha, starring Uttam Kumar as the protagonist &quot;Gourishankar Roy&quot; (a youth from Kolkata&quot;)&quot; and the king &quot;Shankar Singh&quot; of the fictional &quot;Jhind&quot; state&quot;,&quot; Soumitra Chatterjee as the antagonist &quot;Moyur-Bahon&quot; with Tarun Kumar as Gourishankar&#x27;s brother &quot;Udit,&quot; based on the novel by Saradindu Bandyopadhyay of the same title.
* &quot;Prem Ratan Dhan Payo&quot; (2015) is a Bollywood film starring Salman Khan and Sonam Kapoor that follows a similar plot. However, in this adaption, Rassendyll is married to Princess Flavia in the end. 
* &quot;Gwange Wangyidoen namja&quot;, also known as &quot;Masquerade&quot;, is a 2012 Korean movie taking place during the Joseon dynasty that largely parallels the story in &quot;Prisoner of Zenda&quot;, but may be based on conjecture about a historical person, king Gwanghaegun of Joseon, and a 15-day period where records are missing from the annals of the Joseon Dynasty.

* A Mickey Mouse story &quot;The Monarch of Medioka&quot; (1937) is loosely based on the novel. 
*Adapted by Mike Sekowsky. &quot;Classics Illustrated&quot; issue 76 (original edition October 1950) is &quot;The Prisoner of Zenda&quot;. (Art by H. C. Kiefer, script by Ken Fitch.)

==Homages==
Many subsequent fictional works can be linked to &quot;The Prisoner of Zenda&quot;; indeed, this novel spawned the genre known as Ruritanian romance. What follows is a short list of those homages with a clear debt to Anthony Hope&#x27;s book.

* The 1902 short story &quot;Rupert the Resembler&quot; is one of the so-called New Burlesques, a comedy parody by Bret Harte.
* The 30 May 1948 episode of the CBS radio series of &quot;The Adventures of Sam Spade&quot; starring Howard Duff is titled &quot;The Prisoner of Zenda Caper&quot; and involves a former actress who had starred in a film version of &quot;The Prisoner of Zenda&quot; before her marriage and who had lived in a castle-like mansion built in the style of the Zenda castle.
* Dornford Yates acknowledged Hope&#x27;s influence in his two novels &quot;Blood Royal&quot; (1929) and &quot;Fire Below&quot;, a.k.a. &quot;By Royal Command&quot; (1930), which were set in the Ruritania-like Principality of Riechtenburg.
* John Buchan&#x27;s &quot;The House of the Four Winds&quot; (1935) is an homage to &quot;The Prisoner of Zenda&quot;.
* Robert A. Heinlein adapted the &quot;Zenda&quot; plotline to his science fiction novel &quot;Double Star&quot; (1956).
* John Osborne&#x27;s play &quot;The Blood of the Bambergs&quot; (1962) turns the plot into a satire on royal weddings.
* The 1965 comedy film &quot;The Great Race&quot; included an extended subplot that parodies &quot;Zenda&quot;, including a climactic fencing scene between The Great Leslie (Tony Curtis) and Baron Rolfe von Stuppe (Ross Martin). While Curtis&#x27;s character performs the heroics, it is Jack Lemmon who plays the dual role of the drunken crown prince and Professor Fate, Leslie&#x27;s rival/nemesis and reluctant impersonator of the prince.
* Two episodes of the spoof spy television series &quot;Get Smart&quot;, &quot;The King Lives?&quot; and &quot;To Sire with Love, Parts 1 and 2&quot;, parodied the 1937 movie version, with Don Adams affecting Ronald Colman&#x27;s accent.
* The 1970 novel &quot;Royal Flash&quot; by George MacDonald Fraser purports to explain the real story behind &quot;The Prisoner of Zenda&quot;, and indeed, in an extended literary conceit, claims to be the inspiration for Hope&#x27;s novel—the narrator of the memoirs, in the framing story, tells his adventures to his lawyer, Hawkins, who can be assumed to be Anthony Hope. Otto von Bismarck and other real people such as Lola Montez are involved in the plot. It was adapted as the film &quot;Royal Flash&quot; in 1975, directed by Richard Lester, starring Malcolm McDowell as Flashman and Oliver Reed as Bismarck.
* * The 1978 &quot;Doctor Who&quot; television story &quot;The Androids of Tara&quot; was loosely based on &quot;The Prisoner of Zenda,&quot; having been commissioned under the working title &quot;The Androids of Zenda.&quot; While overt references to the novel were dropped from the story during production, the basic plot remained. It featured Tom Baker as the Doctor and Mary Tamm in four roles: Romana and Princess Strella, and android doubles of each. The 1980 novelisation was written by Terrance Dicks, who was script-editor on the 1984 BBC serialisation of &quot;Zenda&quot;.
* &quot;The Zenda Vendetta&quot; (TimeWars Book 4) by Simon Hawke (1985) is a science-fiction version, part of a series which pits 27th-century terrorists the Timekeepers against the Time Commandos of the US Army Temporal Corps. The Timekeepers kill Rassendyll so that the Time Commando Finn Delaney is sent back to impersonate the impersonator, both to ensure that history follows its true path and to defeat the terrorists. In the finale, the Time Commandos assault Zenda Castle with lasers and atomic grenades, both to rescue the king and to destroy the Timekeepers base.
* The 1992 &quot;Adventures in Odyssey&quot; episode &quot;An Act of Nobility&quot; is a whole plot reference to &quot;The Prisoner of Zenda&quot;.
* John Spurling&#x27;s novel &quot;After Zenda&quot; (1995) is a tongue-in-cheek modern adventure in which Karl, the secret great-grandson of Rudolf Rassendyll and Queen Flavia, goes to post-Communist Ruritania, where he gets mixed up with various rebels and religious sects before ending up as constitutional monarch.
* &quot;The Prisoner of Zenda, Inc.&quot;, a 1996 television version, is set in the contemporary United States and revolves around a high school boy who is the heir to a large corporation. The writer, Rodman Gregg, was inspired by the 1937 film version.
* &quot;De speelgoedzaaier&quot;, a Spike and Suzy comic by Willy Vandersteen, is loosely based on &quot;The Prisoner of Zenda&quot;.
* In &quot;The Prisoner of Benda&quot;, an episode of the animated TV series &quot;Futurama&quot;, Bender impersonates (or rather, switches bodies with) the Emperor of Robo-Hungary as part of a scheme to steal the crown jewels.
* The 1994 role-playing game &quot;Castle Falkenstein&quot; lists &quot;The Prisoner of Zenda&quot; as inspiration and even includes a character named Tarlenheim.
* &quot;The Prisoner of Windsor&quot;, an audio-book by Mark Steyn, is both a sequel and an inversion of the story. Set in modern England, a Ruritanian from the House of Elphberg is called upon to stand in for an Englishman in London.

==Legacy==
In a popular but very questionable account, a German circus acrobat named Otto Witte claimed he had been briefly mistaken for the new King of Albania at the time of that country&#x27;s separation from the Ottoman Empire, and that he was crowned and reigned a few days. However, the date of this claim (1913), and the lack of any evidence to back it up, suggest that Witte made up his story after seeing the first film version of the novel. The novel &quot;Every Inch a King&quot; (2005) by Harry Turtledove takes Witte&#x27;s story and places it in a high fantasy setting.

Author Salman Rushdie cited &quot;The Prisoner of Zenda&quot; in the epigraph to &quot;Haroun and the Sea of Stories&quot;, the novel he wrote while living in hiding in the late 1980s. The novel has been part of the syllabus of higher secondary schools in Pakistan for over three decades.

<text>The Donald Duck universe is a fictional shared universe which is the setting of stories involving Disney cartoon character Donald Duck, as well as Daisy Duck, Huey, Dewey, and Louie, Scrooge McDuck, and many other characters. Life in the Donald Duck universe centers on the city of Duckburg and is a part of the larger Mickey Mouse universe. In addition to the original comic book stories by Carl Barks, the Duckburg cast was featured in Little Golden Books, television series such as &quot;DuckTales&quot; (1987–1991), &quot;Darkwing Duck&quot; (1991–1992), and the &quot;DuckTales&quot; reboot (2017–2021), and video games such as &quot;DuckTales&quot; (1989), &quot;QuackShot&quot; (1991), &quot;Goin&#x27; Quackers&quot; (2000), and &quot;&quot; (2013).

&quot;Donald Duck universe&quot;, sometimes called Duckverse or Scrooge McDuck universe, are unofficial terms used by Disney, but are sometimes used by fans. Disney comics artist/writer Don Rosa has also used the terms [[Carl Barks|Barks]] Universe and Italian Duck Universe to describe different versions of history. According to Carl Barks, the comic book creator of Scrooge McDuck, Duckburg, and its original cast of characters and themes (who also developed Donald Duck and created Daisy Duck and Huey, Dewey and Louie for the early &quot;Donald Duck&quot; cartoons) — &quot;Now we&#x27;re beginning to read about Batman&#x27;s universe, the Spiderman universe. All of those guys had their own universe, and so the ducks have their own universe.&quot; Barks adds, &quot;Whenever I wrote the script and it was drawn by some other artist ... it came out looking so different, it didn&#x27;t look like it belonged in the duck universe .. .Didn&#x27;t look as real, or I use the word, &#x27;sincere&#x27;. You couldn&#x27;t tell whether the guy who drew it was really interested in turning out a nice product or not.&quot;

The core Duckverse family dates back to the golden age of American animation, generally introduced in Disney shorts, weekly newspaper comics, or comic books of the period as supporting characters for Donald Duck, who premiered in 1934 in &quot;The Wise Little Hen&quot; (but was mentioned as a friend of Mickey&#x27;s as early as 1931). Donald&#x27;s nephews, Huey, Dewey, and Louie, debuted in 1937 in a comic strip adaptation of an in-production film, Donald&#x27;s Nephews. Daisy Duck, Donald&#x27;s on-again-off-again girlfriend premiered in 1940, in &quot;Mr. Duck Steps Out&quot;. Grandma Duck also appeared in 1940, as a character in the comic strip. Scrooge McDuck, the family&#x27;s elderly uncle and &quot;richest duck in the world&quot;, was created in 1947 by Carl Barks for the comic book story, &quot;Christmas on Bear Mountain&quot;.

== Comic books ==
== Other media ==
Scrooge McDuck appeared in the 1960 Disneyland Records LP, &quot;Donald Duck and His Friends&quot;, in a plot that involved Donald and the Beagle Boys. With the exception of Scrooge&#x27;s brief cameo in &quot;The Mickey Mouse Club&quot; opening theme, this marked the first appearance of a Barks-created character in a medium other than the comics and story books. Later, in 1963, the Beagle Boys played a role in &quot;Chipmunk Fun,&quot; an LP that also mentioned Scrooge.

Most of the characters have appeared in the 1980s Disney cartoon series &quot;DuckTales&quot;. Disney&#x27;s &quot;Darkwing Duck&quot; series is nominally set in the separate &quot;DuckTales&quot; universe, in a metropolis called St. Canard, although aside from sharing the denizen Launchpad McQuack, and a few crossover episodes involving Gizmoduck, there is no interaction. Much of the &quot;DuckTales&quot; and all of the &quot;Darkwing Duck&quot; material do not appear in Barks&#x27; comics, as the two TV series were created decades after Barks&#x27;s active years as a comic artist. Later, a few characters would be the main characters in the show &quot;Quack Pack&quot;.

However, in the magazine &quot;Disney Adventures&quot;, there was a five-part crossover/storyline titled &quot;Legend of the Chaos God&quot; which began with &quot;TaleSpin&quot;, and continued with &quot;Chip &#x27;n Dale Rescue Rangers&quot;, &quot;Goof Troop&quot;, and &quot;DuckTales&quot;, then concluded with &quot;Darkwing Duck&quot;.

Duckburg was the setting of the 1987 animated series &quot;DuckTales&quot;. The cartoon&#x27;s version of Duckburg was based loosely on the comics&#x27; version. Duckburg appeared in the 1990s animated series &quot;Quack Pack&quot;. In Quack Pack, Duckburg was populated almost entirely by human beings, with Donald, Daisy, and Donald&#x27;s nephews as the only anthropomorphized animals that usually appeared. Moreover, the Money Bin is nowhere to be seen. Duckburg was the setting for one of the three initial levels of the video game &quot;Quackshot&quot; and also for the second level of the video game &quot;Donald Duck: Goin&#x27; Quackers&quot;.

Duckburg was also used for the setting of Mickey&#x27;s Birthday land (later Mickey&#x27;s Starland) at Walt Disney World&#x27;s Magic Kingdom from 1988 to 1996. It even included Grandma Duck&#x27;s Farm and a statue of Cornelius Coot, though it was more of a rural town than a burgeoning metropolis. The connection to Duckburg was removed as the land was renovated in 1996 to become Mickey&#x27;s Toontown Fair. However, the Cornelius Coot statue remains.

In the 2017 version of &quot;DuckTales&quot; many elements of the Duck universe from the comics of Don Rosa and Carl Barks were used, alongside elements of others Disney stories (including the original 1987 &quot;DuckTales&quot; TV series, &quot;Darkwing Duck&quot;, &quot;TaleSpin&quot;, &quot;Chip &#x27;n Dale Rescue Rangers&quot;, &quot;Quack Pack&quot;, &quot;Goof Troop&quot; and others). They were brought together into one common global storyline in the manner of the Marvel Cinematic Universe.

==Characters==
Donald Duck and his maternal uncle Scrooge McDuck received nearly equal exposure in comics. (The reduced emphasis on Donald in the 1980s version of &quot;DuckTales&quot; was largely due to a Disney mandate that forbade its nascent television division from using major characters from the Golden Age of Animation, including Donald and Daisy.) Other primary characters include Donald&#x27;s three young nephews Huey, Dewey, and Louie, and girlfriend Daisy Duck.

Several secondary characters have also achieved star status in certain publications, such as Grandma Duck, Donald Duck&#x27;s grandmother; Gladstone Gander, Donald Duck&#x27;s incredibly lucky cousin; Gyro Gearloose, an inventor who is often patronized by Scrooge; and Ludwig Von Drake, a knowledgeable professor. Scrooge also has several enemies, such as the Beagle Boys, a gang of robbers and escaped prisoners; Magica De Spell, an Italian sorceress; and South African Flintheart Glomgold and English-American John D. Rockerduck, both rival business men of Scrooge.

Some characters have appeared alongside Donald primarily in animation, such as chipmunks Chip &#x27;n&#x27; Dale (&quot;Chip an&#x27; Dale&quot;, &quot;Toy Tinkers&quot;) and Humphrey the Bear (&quot;Rugged Bear&quot;, &quot;Grin and Bear It&quot;), as well as Mickey Mouse (&quot;The Dognapper&quot;, &quot;Magician Mickey&quot;), Goofy (&quot;Polar Trappers&quot;, &quot;Frank Duck Brings &#x27;Em Back Alive&quot;), and Pluto (&quot;Donald and Pluto&quot;, &quot;Window Cleaners&quot;), who are more often associated with the Mickey Mouse universe.

== Fictional locations ==

===Duckburg===
Duckburg is the fictional city, located in the fictional U.S. state of Calisota, that serves as the home of Donald Duck, Scrooge McDuck, Huey, Dewey, and Louie, Daisy Duck and most of their supporting cast. Duckburg was first mentioned in &quot;Walt Disney&#x27;s Comics and Stories&quot; #49 in 1944, and was created by Carl Barks.

The city is populated by various anthropomorphized animals, with dogs, different birds (including ducks, geese and chickens) and pigs as the most dominant ones. The mayor of the city is often depicted as a pig, whose name most of the time goes unmentioned and is referred instead by readers as the Pig Mayor. However, in some stories the office of mayor is held by various dog characters.

The size and structure of Duckburg varied in the works by Barks: it was adjusted to better fit the story he wanted to tell; it could vary from a small town to a medium-sized city, to a bustling metropolis. Later writers and artists adhere to this tradition recurrently. In one specific story by Barks, &quot;Monsterville&quot; (1961), Duckburg was even transformed into a futuristic city by Gyro Gearloose, however it proved that the citizens were not ready for the high level of technology that the new city provided. Thus the city was turned back to its old city structure.

In comic writer Don Rosa&#x27;s stories, Duckburg and the state of Calisota is located on the West Coast of the United States, though Carl Barks himself and other writers often leave the city&#x27;s location more vaguely defined. However, in Don Rosa&#x27;s &quot;The Life and Times of Scrooge McDuck&quot;, the author alludes to where exactly he has situated Duckburg: &quot;I won&#x27;t bother to say precisely where I situated Duckburg and Calisota on America&#x27;s west coast… but if you get out a good map and compare the coastline, you&#x27;ll see that I stuck the old gold-prospector&#x27;s adopted hometown directly across the bay from a very appropriately named actual city.&quot; Knowing how Don Rosa used gags, it is likely that this city would be Eureka, California (&quot;Eureka&quot; meaning &#x27;I found it&#x27;!). This fits with the river and a large forest south of Eureka. In the DuckTales episode &quot;Double O&#x27; Duck&quot;, a map is shown which shows Duckburg as being located somewhere in Virginia or North Carolina.

There are no references to the governor, legislature, Capitol, etc., of Calisota in any of the many stories about Duckburg. However, Duckburg seems to have its own governor, if it is not a sort of city-state. In more than one story a &quot;Duckburg embassy&quot; has been shown, which would place it outside the US at a diplomatic level. In the story &quot;Treasure of Marco Polo&quot; (Uncle Scrooge #64, 1966) by Carl Barks, the Duckburg embassy displays a flag of Duckburg, which consists of a white duck over a green field. However, in the Don Rosa story &quot;His Majesty, McDuck&quot; (Uncle Scrooge Adventures #14, Gladstone Aug. 1989) Scrooge gains a short-lived independence from the United States for Killmotor Hill, thus placing Duckburg within the United States.

The most prominent landmark in Duckburg is Scrooge McDuck&#x27;s Money Bin, a giant building sitting on Killmotor Hill (formerly known as Killmule Hill) in the center of town. The money bin contains both office space, Scrooge&#x27;s private living quarters and, most famously, three cubic acres of money, the results of Scrooge&#x27;s lifetime of business and treasure-seeking adventures. Another major landmark in some stories is a large statue of Duckburg&#x27;s founder, Cornelius Coot.

Duckburg is a major center for Space exploration, mainly operated and overseen by Gyro Gearloose, and has had expeditions to the Moon, Mars, Venus, the Asteroids, and more remote parts of the Galaxy. The city also features a sea port and is in proximity of a large forest called the Black Forest and to several mountains, the most notable being &quot;Old Demon Tooth&quot;, usually depicted as a towering pointed peak leaning slightly to the side. The main river of the city is the Tulebug River, first mentioned in &quot;The Money Well&quot; (1958) by Carl Barks, and it is located near Killmotor Hill.

Duckburg is home to Yarvard University (a play on the universities of Harvard and Yale), an institution more notable for its athletic teams than for its academic achievements. It also has had international students, like the bey of El Dagga from Egypt, who is mentioned in Yarvard&#x27;s first appearance; &quot;Donald Duck and the Mummy&#x27;s Ring&quot; by Carl Barks from 1943. One of the things the bey learned at the university was that mummies do not eat. Duckburg is also the home of the Billionaires Club of some of which Scrooge McDuck, John D. Rockerduck and, according to some stories, Flintheart Glomgold are influential members. Duckburg also has a Ritz Hotel, first mentioned in Carl Barks&#x27; story &quot;Turkey with All the Schemings&quot; (Walt Disney&#x27;s Comics and Stories #148, 1953) at which Scrooge McDuck had a business meeting with Donald Duck; who was disguised as the Duke of Baloni, the World&#x27;s Second-Richest Duck at that time. In the same story Scrooge later buys the Ritz Hotel and he still owns it in Don Rosa&#x27;s story &quot;Attaaaaaack!&quot; (2000).

Located near Duckburg is a farm owned and run by Grandma Duck, a direct descendant of Cornelius Coot and Donald&#x27;s paternal grandmother. Donald&#x27;s cousin Gus Goose also lives on Grandma&#x27;s farm as a farmhand. The farm is often a gathering site for various Duck family holiday celebrations.

In other languages, Duckburg (for example &quot;Duckstad&quot; in Dutch, &quot;Entenhausen&quot; in German, &quot;Ankeborg&quot; in Swedish, &quot;Rațburg&quot; in Romanian, &quot;Andeby&quot; in Danish, or &quot;Patópolis&quot; in both European and Brazilian Portuguese) is not only home of &quot;the Ducks&quot;, but Mickey Mouse and friends live there too. This has occasionally been implied also in English-language publications, as when Super Goof is referred to as &quot;Duckburg&#x27;s greatest hero&quot; in a poster seen in the initial panel of the 1973 story &quot;Galactic Gourmet&quot; (&quot;Super Goof&quot; #27, Gold Key Comics). The story moreover pits Super Goof against the Beagle Boys, normally portrayed as living and operating in Duckburg.

====History====
In the comics by Don Rosa, Duckburg was a fort built on Killmule Hill on June 17, 1579, by British explorer Sir Francis Drake in the area he named &quot;Nova Albion&quot;, in what would later become the state of Calisota. It was originally known as &quot;Fort Drakeborough&quot;. In the year 1818, during the Spanish colonization of California (1697–1821), the fort had been handed over by its departing British occupants to the visiting hunter and fur trader Cornelius Coot, who Americanized the British name of the fort to &quot;Fort Duckburg&quot;. &quot;Drake&quot; means a male duck, while &quot;borough&quot; and &quot;burg&quot; are synonyms. Cornelius Coot turned the old fort into a trading post for fellow traders and hunters, and their families. Eventually a small town grew around the fort on top of Killmule Hill. In Carl Barks&#x27; story &quot;The Day Duckburg Got Dyed&quot; (1957), it is revealed that Cornelius Coot at some point in Duckburg&#x27;s history managed to pipe mountain water into the town. During the American Civil War, a decisive battle was fought on top of an unnamed hill in Duckburg, led by the Duckburgian General Stonewall Duck. It is not known on which side the city fought, but with General Stonewall Duck being based on the real-life Stonewall Jackson, it can be assumed they fought for the Confederacy. However, the real-life state of California, in which the fictional state of Calisota is located according to Don Rosa, was a Unionist state, making Duckburg a more likely member of the Union.

Duckburg remained a quiet, small town until the arrival of wealthy businessman Scrooge McDuck. He had bought the old fort and the hill from fellow prospector Casey Coot, a descendant of Cornelius Coot, during the Klondike Gold Rush in 1899. Scrooge proceeded to construct his famous Money Bin on the location, which would eventually cause McDuck an incredible variety of problems and dilemmas. The first one was caused by the Junior Woodchucks, who were squatting in the site and using the old fort as their headquarters, even though they did not have legal title to it. The dispute led to a small war in 1902, involving the United States marines and navy, led by then President Theodore Roosevelt. Eventually however, the construction of the Money Bin, and Scrooge&#x27;s establishment of various businesses in and around Duckburg, caused Duckburg&#x27;s population to swell, and turned the small town into a bustling city and a global financial centre within a few decades.

===Calisota===
Calisota is a fictional U.S. state, created by Carl Barks in his story &quot;The Gilded Man&quot; (&quot;Four Color&quot; #422). Duckburg is among the cities located there, as well as Goosetown, a traditional rival of Duckburg, and Mouseton.
Although it has many fictional elements and a variable climate, Calisota is probably synonymous with Jefferson, being roughly equivalent to Northern California. Duckburg is located north of San Francisco, with a map in Don Rosa&#x27;s &quot;The Life and Times of Scrooge McDuck&quot; showing Calisota corresponding to the part of California north of the 39th parallel.

The name is a blend of &quot;California&quot; and &quot;Minnesota&quot;, supposedly to allow all kinds of weather or climate in the stories, although Calisota has very little in common with the latter (a state in the Upper Midwest, far from the ocean) and Northern California&#x27;s regional weather is variable enough by itself.

===Brutopia===
Brutopia (a portmanteau word from &quot;brute&quot; and &quot;Utopia&quot;) is a fictional country appearing in several Donald Duck stories. It was created by Carl Barks in the story &quot;A Cold Bargain&quot; from 1957. Brutopia is a hostile country, aiming for world domination. It hence is clearly a caricature of the Soviet Union. In the Duck universe, Brutopia occasionally attempts to steal Scrooge&#x27;s money so as to devastate the American economy, and to fund the creation of doomsday weaponry. Its national coat of arms has been shown either as a dagger or the hammer and shackles.

Whether Brutopia is a stand-in for all of the USSR, or just for part of it, varies with the story. Sometimes parallels to Russia are drawn directly. Don Rosa has suggested that Brutopia might instead represent the eastern part of Siberia.

The language of Brutopia often looks somewhat Slavic. On some occasions it is written in Cyrillic script. On the other hand, Brutopians seem to speak perfect, non-accented English; and other stories show English language texts being used by Brutopians.

In 1957, Brutopia&#x27;s military spending budget amounted to one trillion dollars plus all the kitchen sinks of its happy people (a number that on closer inspection turned out to be five). Scrooge McDuck outbid the Brutopian government by paying one trillion dollars and six kitchen sinks for a sample of the recently discovered substance of bombastium.

===Money Bin===
The Money Bin is the building where Scrooge McDuck stores the portions of his money he earned by himself. Carl Barks invented the &quot;money swim&quot; in his story &quot;A Financial Fable&quot; (1950), followed by the &quot;Money Bin&quot; in the story &quot;Terror of the Beagle Boys&quot; (1951). In Barks&#x27; earlier stories, interchangeably with the name Money Bin, the building&#x27;s official name was the McDuck Building, which was only used on facade signs. Eventually however, the name was discontinued in the later stories by Barks and subsequent writers and artists.

While the first stories showing the Bin treated it as if it had just been built, later continuity established that Scrooge had built the Money Bin in 1902 after having traveled around the world to make his fortune, mostly through prospecting and the establishment of various businesses. Scrooge&#x27;s favorite pastime is to dive off a springboard into his money and swim through it. In most comic books stories, Scrooge lives at the Money Bin in his private quarters on the top floor, with the rooms often filled with large amounts of money. Because of Scrooge&#x27;s frugality he has at times even made his own furniture and architecture out of his money; like using moneybags as chairs or using stacked paper bills as stairs to reach high places. The Money Bin also has a worry room in which Scrooge paces around in circles, which has caused a circular depression in the floor, to worry and ponder about hardships that has befallen him. The worry room was first mentioned in Carl Barks&#x27; story &quot;The Secret of Atlantis&quot; (&quot;Uncle Scrooge&quot; #5, 1954).

The traditional location of the Money Bin is on top of Killmotor Hill which in turn lies atop a fault line which would prove catastrophic in the event of an earthquake, and this earthquake occurred in the story &quot;Land Beneath the Ground!&quot; (1956) by Carl Barks.

The Money Bin is the victim of repeated assaults by Scrooge&#x27;s enemies who try to steal his money, such as the Beagle Boys, who are after the bulk of Scrooge&#x27;s money, and Magica DeSpell, who is after Scrooge&#x27;s &quot;Number One Dime&quot;, the first dime Scrooge ever earned. To protect against these attempted break-ins, Scrooge has installed the greatest security system in the world, which includes Gizmoduck in the &quot;DuckTales&quot; TV-Series, to thwart any thought of even trying to intrude onto the premises.

Barks defined the volume of money contained inside as &quot;three cubic acres&quot;, but the exact meaning of a &quot;cubic acre&quot; left to the reader to interpret, since an acre is a measure of area, not length. Taken literally, a cubic acre would be a 6-dimensional space of 82,653,950,016,000 ft6, i.e. feet to the sixth power. Taken as an acre that is raised to a cube with each side an acre, it would be around 9 091 379 ft3. A series of blueprints created for the Scrooge McDuck story &quot;The Beagle Boys vs. the Money Bin&quot; by Don Rosa state that the Money Bin is approximately tall, and wide. In the story, said blueprints are accredited to an architect named Frank Lloyd Drake, who is based on the real-life architect Frank Lloyd Wright.

The Money Bin also contains various valuable artifacts like the Golden Fleece, the Crown of Genghis Khan, the Crown of the Mayas, the Candy-Striped Ruby and the Goose Egg Nugget. According to Carl Barks&#x27; story &quot;The Fabulous Philosopher&#x27;s Stone&quot; (Uncle Scrooge #10, 1955) Scrooge also owned the Philosopher&#x27;s Stone at one point, but it was later confiscated by the International Money Council as it could devastate the economy because of its capability to turn base metals into gold.

The Danish and Norwegian names for &quot;the Money Bin&quot; are &quot;Pengetanken&quot; and &quot;Pengebingen&quot;, respectively, and these have become a regular word in these languages for a large amount of money or cash.

Russell W. Belk mentions the Money Bin in &quot;Material Values in the Comics: A Content Analysis of Comic Books Featuring Themes of Wealth&quot;, where he remarks that Scrooge&#x27;s &quot;childish fascination with money&quot;, where he takes pleasure in diving and swimming in the Money Bin, might account for Scrooge not being portrayed as a villain. Penelope Fritzer in the article &quot;Scrooge McDuck: Postmodern Robber Baron&quot; considers it possible for the Money Bin to symbolize the entire Disney empire.

The Money Bin in the &quot;DuckTales&quot; 2017 reboot is given a total redesign. Here it is depicted as a large tower situated on an island in the waters near Duckburg, connected to the city via a bridge, and visible directly from Scrooge&#x27;s bedroom window. It is perceived as a costly architectural fancy by Scrooge&#x27;s board of directors, though Scrooge candidly claimed its deranged staff being let go would cause a larger danger. Aside from storing his money, this incarnation of the Money Bin (somewhat emptier due to Scrooge&#x27;s costly search for the lost Della Duck) also serves as the corporate headquarters of McDuck Industries and the location of Gyro Gearloose&#x27;s lab.

===Glomgold&#x27;s bin===
Flintheart Glomgold also owns a money bin, located near Limpopo Valley in South Africa. Glomgold&#x27;s bin substitutes the dollar sign ($) that appears on Scrooge&#x27;s with a pound sign (£), as the South African pound was the currency of South Africa until 1961. The preference for the pound sign can also be explained by Glomgold&#x27;s heritage, which puts him as a citizen of South Africa with British blood, whereas Scrooge embraced America despite his pure Scottish blood.

===Millionaires&#x27; club===
The Millionaires&#x27; club (sometimes called the Billionaires&#x27; club) is a prominent gentlemen&#x27;s club in Duckburg, with its premises located in a stately mansion. The club first appeared in the 1959 story &quot;The Christmas Cha Cha&quot;, written by Bob Gregory and drawn by Carl Barks. Membership of the club is exclusive, with the minimum requirement being owning at least a million dollars.

Scrooge McDuck, Flintheart Glomgold and John Rockerduck are all members of the club, along with several other millionaires. Although Scrooge is clearly the wealthiest man in Duckburg, he is not the speaker of the club nor holds any special position above the other members. A repeating scene is Scrooge arriving at the club to catch up on the daily newspapers, as he is too stingy to buy copies himself. His favourite refreshment at the club is plain tap water as it is the cheapest the club has to offer. Whenever Scrooge meets his rival Rockerduck at the club, the two end up in an argument.

The speaker of the club often holds contests requiring spending excessive amounts of money and displaying a flamboyant millionaire lifestyle. Although Scrooge hates these contents because of the excessive spending, he is always forced to take part, in order to maintain his membership and status in the club.

== Recurring elements ==

===Number One Dime===
The Number One Dime (sometimes also called Lucky Dime in some games) is the first coin that Scrooge McDuck ever earned (or, according to some stories, produced). The Number One Dime first appeared in the story &quot;The Round Money Bin&quot;, created by Carl Barks and first published in &quot;Uncle Scrooge&quot; #3 (September, 1953). In this story, the dime is so old that it has become thin as a razor blade and allows Scrooge to cut binding ropes and escape from the Beagle Boys. In later stories, it is insinuated that the dime brings good luck to Scrooge and has helped him become a rich man. In some stories, he instantly starts losing money whenever the dime is no longer in his possession. In fact, in some series, Scrooge is so attached to the dime that he becomes hysterical, to the point of losing his mind, whenever he loses possession of the dime.

It is never made clear whether the dime actually brings good luck, or if Scrooge merely believes in it so much that he is distressed and makes bad decisions whenever he no longer has his dime. Since Barks never actually said that it was because of the coin that Scrooge was the richest duck in the world, Don Rosa, after various informational exchanges with Barks, for a faithful production of &quot;The Life and Times Of Scrooge McDuck&quot;, clarified that the Number One Dime is not actually an amulet, and that this vision was just a myth. The Number One Dime is just a sentimental object that happens to be the first coin Scrooge received for his work. Rosa made clear, also, that Scrooge made his fortune working hard and being honest. This point is heavily reinforced in the &quot;DuckTales&quot; TV series where Scrooge tells his nephews about the value of hard earned cash.

The dime is a key plot point in practically every story featuring Magica De Spell, a character invented by Carl Barks, as the main villain. Magica believes that by stealing the first coin earned by the richest person in the world and melting it down to a magical amulet, she can gain the power of the ancient King Midas, so that everything she touches becomes gold and she can be rich beyond her wildest dreams. The fact that this will only work if the coin indeed belongs to the richest person in the world at the time, and is the first coin that person earned, is crucial, and is made into a plot point in some stories. However, the dime only has magical value because of these circumstances and not on its own. Magica once successfully stole the Dime while helping the Beagle Boys rob McDuck, stopping when she realized this would mean McDuck would no longer be the world&#x27;s richest person, rendering the Dime worthless.

According to a comic story by Don Rosa, it is an 1875 Seated Liberty dime, but in a comic story written by Pat and Carol McGreal and drawn by Maximino Tortajada Aguilar, the last two digits have been swapped, making it an 1857 Seated Liberty dime.

Scrooge earned the dime in 1877 in his hometown of Glasgow, when he started working as a shoeshine boy on his tenth birthday. Before that it belonged to Howard Rockerduck (the father of John D. Rockerduck). The customer who paid it to him, a ditch-digger called Burt, seemingly &quot;cheated&quot; Scrooge. In reality, Scrooge&#x27;s father, Fergus McDuck, gave Burt the dime specifically for paying Scrooge for his services. Scrooge McDuck never learned that fact, although Fergus did reveal it to Scrooge&#x27;s sisters Matilda and Hortense. Burt and Magica De Spell, who learned about this when she traveled in time to the day Scrooge earned the Dime, are the only other ones who know. McDuck kept it as a reminder not to be fooled again in the future. When he emigrated to the US three years later, he carried it with him. Scrooge still has the dime and keeps it on a pillow under glass because of its sentimental value. Donald Duck, Huey, Dewey, and Louie, and Gladstone Gander among many others think it is really a lucky charm, but Scrooge himself rejects any claims beyond sentimentality.

===The Junior Woodchucks===
The Junior Woodchucks are the Scouting organization to which Huey, Dewey, and Louie belong. They have a uniform with a coonskin cap. The Junior Woodchucks were created by Carl Barks in 1951, in the story &quot;Operation St. Bernhard&quot; (&quot;Walt Disney&#x27;s Comics and Stories&quot; #125). Later stories introduced a similar organization for girls, Junior Chickadees, to which Daisy Duck&#x27;s nieces, April, May and June belong. The hallmark of the Junior Woodchucks is their spirited dedication to environmental protection and animal welfare, as well as the preservation of knowledge and the furtherance of science. They are also known for their exalted titles and ranks (Huey, Dewey, and Louie being promoted to become &quot;Ten-Star Generals&quot; in the 1952 story of the same name) and the awarding of buckets of badges, along with severe ideals as to decorum. In this way Barks poked gentle but pointed satire at aspects of the Boy Scouts.

===Bombastium===
Bombastium is a fictional chemical element. Its atomic number and atomic symbol are unknown. Bombastium is stated to be the rarest element in the world. Even though it is very coveted, its usage potential is not entirely known. One characteristic is that it tastes different every time you try it, and scientists eventually discovered that one atom of bombastium dropped into a barrel of water becomes one barrel of ice cream – a different flavor of ice cream each time. The element is orange-brown in color and is about the size of a soccer ball. To avoid evaporation, bombastium must be kept frozen.

The only piece of bombastium known to exist was found in the Belgian Congo, and it was soon after its discovery acquired by Scrooge McDuck in the 1957 story &quot;A Cold Bargain&quot; by Carl Barks, but at that time it was also heavily sought after by the hostile nation of Brutopia. Brutopia&#x27;s military spending budget that year amounted to one trillion dollars plus all the kitchen sinks of its happy people. Scrooge McDuck therefore had to pay one trillion dollars plus six kitchen sinks to win the auction.

The element was also used for the 5-part &quot;DuckTales&quot; episode &quot;Time is Money&quot;, which introduced Bubba the Caveduck. In this cartoon episode, bombastium is the fuel for one of Gyro Gearloose&#x27;s inventions, a time traveling helicopter named the Millennium Shortcut. The bombastium itself must be kept frozen in order for it to be usable as fuel (a small freezer is equipped on board the Shortcut for this purpose). Otherwise, the Shortcut could not travel through time.

One of the treasures that can be obtained in the computer game &quot;&quot; is bombastium. Unlike the other treasures, bombastium is worth more than just money, as Gyro Gearloose can use it to build a matter transporter which takes away the risk of flying from place to place while having the possible downside of sending the player to a location they had not intended to go.

===Squiggs===
Squiggs are fairly small fish that are typically eaten &quot;oolated&quot;. Squiggs were first mentioned in the Carl Barks ten-pager &quot;Turkey Trouble&quot; where, in one panel, a can of &quot;oolated squiggs&quot; can be seen as a background detail. Don Rosa later used the fish as a key plot element in the story &quot;Oolated Luck&quot;.

Conserved oolated squiggs are fairly cheap and wholesome food but taste particularly bad, and smell worse. Donald Duck and Gladstone Gander once took part in a competition organized by a company producing oolated squiggs, where the grand prize was an ocean liner cruise. Donald won the grand prize and Gladstone won a year&#x27;s supply of oolated squiggs.

<text>The Producers is a 1967 American satirical black comedy film. It was written and directed by Mel Brooks, and stars Zero Mostel, Gene Wilder, Dick Shawn, and Kenneth Mars. The film is about a mild-mannered accountant and a con artist theater producer who scheme to get rich by fraudulently overselling interests in a stage musical designed to fail. To this end, they find a playscript celebrating Adolf Hitler and the Nazis and bring it to the stage. Because of this theme, &quot;The Producers&quot; was controversial from the start and received mixed reviews. It became a cult film, and found a more positive critical reception later.

&quot;The Producers&quot; was Brooks&#x27; directorial debut. For the film, he won an Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay. In 1996, the film was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant&quot; and placed eleventh on the AFI&#x27;s 100 Years...100 Laughs list. It was later adapted by Brooks and Thomas Meehan as a stage musical, which itself was adapted into a film.

==Plot==
Max Bialystock is an aging Broadway producer whose career has veered from great success to the depths of near failure. He now ekes out a hand-to-mouth existence while romancing lascivious, wealthy elderly women in exchange for money for a &quot;next play&quot; that may never be produced. Leopold &quot;Leo&quot; Bloom, a nervous young accountant prone to hysterics, arrives at Max&#x27;s office to audit his accounts and discovers a $2,000 discrepancy in the accounts of Max&#x27;s last play. Max persuades Leo to hide the fraud, and Leo realizes that, since a flop is expected to lose money, the IRS will not investigate its finances, so a producer could earn more from a flop than from a hit by overselling interests and embezzling the funds. Wishing to put this scheme into action and flee to Rio de Janeiro with the profits, Max convinces Leo to join him, treating him to lunch and a day out and saying that his drab life is little different to prison anyway.

The partners find the ideal play for their scheme: &quot;Springtime for Hitler: A Gay Romp with Adolf and Eva at Berchtesgaden&quot;: a &quot;love letter to Hitler&quot; written by deranged ex-Nazi soldier Franz Liebkind. Leo and Max bond with Franz over Schnapps and tell him they want to show the world a positive representation of Hitler. Now with the stage rights, Max sells 25,000% of the play to investors, using some of the money to redecorate the office and hire a new receptionist, Ulla. To guarantee the show&#x27;s failure, they hire Roger De Bris, a flamboyantly gay transvestite director, whose productions seldom make it past initial rehearsals. The part of Hitler goes to a hippie named Lorenzo Saint DuBois, also known, in a reference to the counterculture drug, as L. S. D., who wanders into the theater during the casting call. At the theater on opening night, Max tries to ensure a harshly negative review by attempting to bribe &quot;The New York Times&quot; theatre critic.

The play opens with a lavish production of the title song, &quot;Springtime for Hitler&quot;, which celebrates Nazi Germany&#x27;s conquering Europe (&quot;Springtime for Hitler and Germany/Winter for Poland and France&quot;). L. S. D. then comes on stage as Hitler, and his beatnik-like portrayal makes the audience think the show is a satire. To Leo and Max&#x27;s horror, &quot;Springtime for Hitler&quot; is a hit, so their investors will be expecting a larger financial return than can be paid out.

Back at their office, as Leo and Max are fighting after the former attempts to turn himself in to get a plea bargain, a gun-wielding Franz confronts them. He tries first to shoot them, and then himself, but runs out of bullets. The three then decide to blow up the theater to end the production, but they are caught in the explosion and arrested. At the trial, where they are found &quot;incredibly guilty&quot; by the jury, Leo makes an impassioned statement praising Max for being his friend and changing his life.

Leo, Max, and Franz are sent to the state penitentiary and produce a new musical called &quot;Prisoners of Love&quot;. While Max and Franz supervise rehearsals, Leo oversells shares of the play to their fellow prisoners and the warden.

== Production ==
===Early publicity===
A substantive early &quot;New York Times&quot; account of the property&#x27;s genesis dates to December 1961: &quot;Edward Padula has acquired a new comedy by Mel Brooks tentatively called &#x27;Springtime for Hitler&#x27;. The producer said yesterday that actually &#x27;Hitler is not in the comedy.&#x27; &#x27;It&#x27;s a sort of play-within-a-play. The setting is contemporary England.&#x27; Kenneth Williams, rated by Mr. Padula as &#x27;England&#x27;s new comic discovery&#x27; is under consideration for the leading role...Work on the new Brooks comedy will start immediately after the local presentation of &#x27;All American&#x27;.&quot;

=== Writing and development ===
The title &quot;Springtime for Hitler&quot; was first coined by Brooks as a joke during the press conference for &quot;All American&quot; in 1962. Shortly afterwards, he also decided to relate this title to a character named Leo Bloom, an homage to Leopold Bloom, protagonist of James Joyce&#x27;s &quot;Ulysses.&quot; It was reused by him years later once he had an idea about &quot;two schnooks on Broadway who set out to produce a flop and swindle the backers&quot;. The inspiration was some people Brooks met during his early show business days: Benjamin Kutcher, a New York producer who financed his plays by sleeping with elderly women, became the basis for Max Bialystock, and the scheme had origins in two theater producers who had a lavish lifestyle while making various unsuccessful plays. In her 1943 novel &quot;The Fountainhead&quot;, Ayn Rand in fact anticipates Mel Brooks&#x27;s premise by having a consortium of unscrupulous businessmen sell 200 percent of a planned vacation resort which they intend to be a disaster, to that end hiring the controversial modernist architect Howard Roark, but his buildings are a great success, and the backers are prosecuted. When imagining what play &quot;would have people packing up and leaving the theatre even before the first act is over&quot;, Brooks decided to combine Adolf Hitler and a musical. Brooks, in a 2001 episode of &quot;60 Minutes&quot;, stated that, while serving in the army, he was called &quot;Jew boy&quot;, and he lightheartedly admitted that he made &quot;The Producers&quot; to &quot;get even&quot; with antisemites, particularly Hitler. In another interview, he further explained his reasoning, stating,

Brooks first envisioned his story as a novel, and changed it to a play when publishers told him it had &quot;too much dialogue. Not enough narrative&quot;. He wrote the script in nine months, with the help of secretary Alfa-Betty Olsen. During the process, he mentioned in an October 1966 interview with &quot;Playboy&quot; that he was working on &quot;Springtime for Hitler,&quot; &quot;a play within a play, or a play within a film – I haven&#x27;t decided yet&quot;. Then, it evolved into a screenplay to take advantage of various settings, as &quot;it could go places, it wouldn&#x27;t have to stay in the office&quot;.

As Brooks sought backers for his 30-page film treatment, both major film studios and independent filmmakers rejected &quot;Springtime for Hitler,&quot; finding the idea of using Hitler for comedy outrageous and tasteless (with some even stating that they would consider the script if Brooks changed it to &quot;Springtime for Mussolini&quot;). This changed as Brooks&#x27;s agent arranged for him to have a meeting with a friend of his, New York producer Sidney Glazier. Glazier laughed so much at Brooks&#x27; performance of the script, he accepted the project by saying, &quot;We&#x27;re gonna make it! I don&#x27;t know how, but we&#x27;re gonna make this movie!&quot;

Glazier budgeted the film at $1 million, and sought financiers. Half the money came from philanthropist Louis Wolfson, who liked the idea of laughing at a dictator, and the remainder, along with the distribution, was arranged by Joseph E. Levine of Embassy Pictures. Levine&#x27;s only condition was to change the title, as he felt many distributors would not carry a picture named &quot;Springtime for Hitler.&quot; Brooks renamed it &quot;The Producers,&quot; considering it ironic as &quot;these guys are anything but producers&quot;. As Brooks &quot;couldn&#x27;t think of anybody to direct it&quot;, eventually he decided to take the task for himself, even though he himself had only directed one play before. While Levine was insecure in having an inexperienced director, Brooks convinced him by saying it would be cost-effective, and he knew how to do physical comedy after being a stage manager in &quot;Your Show of Shows.&quot;

=== Casting ===
Brooks wanted Zero Mostel as Max Bialystock, feeling he was an energetic actor who could convey such an egotistical character. Glazier sent the script to Mostel&#x27;s lawyer, but the attorney hated it and never showed it to the actor. Eventually, Brooks had to send the script through Mostel&#x27;s wife Kathryn Harkin. While Mostel did not like the prospect of playing &quot;a Jewish producer going to bed with old women on the brink of the grave&quot;, his wife liked the script so much, she eventually convinced him to accept the role.

Gene Wilder met Brooks in 1963, as Wilder performed with Brooks&#x27; then-girlfriend Anne Bancroft in a stage adaptation of &quot;Mother Courage.&quot; Wilder complained that the audience was laughing at his serious performance, and Brooks replied that Wilder was &quot;a natural comic, you look like Harpo Marx&quot;, and said he would cast him as Leo Bloom once he finished the then-titled &quot;Springtime for Hitler.&quot; When production arrived, Peter Sellers accepted an invitation to play Leo Bloom, but he never contacted again, so Brooks remembered Wilder, who was about to make his film debut in &quot;Bonnie and Clyde.&quot; Wilder received the script to &quot;The Producers&quot; as Brooks visited him backstage during a performance of &quot;Luv&quot;, and his co-star Renée Taylor was brought for a brief appearance as the actress playing Eva Braun.

Dustin Hoffman was originally cast as Liebkind. According to Brooks, late on the night before shooting began, Hoffman begged Brooks to let him out of his commitment to do the role so he could audition for the starring role in &quot;The Graduate.&quot; Brooks was aware of the film, which co-starred his now-wife Bancroft, and, skeptical that Hoffman would get the role, agreed to let him audition. When Hoffman did win the role of Ben Braddock, Brooks called in Kenneth Mars as Liebkind. Mars was originally invited because Brooks envisioned him as Roger De Bris, given he played a gay psychiatrist on Broadway. Instead, Mars was interested in the Liebkind role, which became his film debut. He remained in character while not filming as a strategy of method acting. De Bris was instead portrayed by Christopher Hewett, the first actor who read for the role.

Recent American Academy of Dramatic Arts graduate Lee Meredith was invited to audition as Ulla on condition of being able to do a Swedish accent. She borrowed a book from the AADA library to learn the accent, and won the role with a screen test of the scene in which Ulla dances. Bancroft suggested her friend Andréas Voutsinas for the role of Carmen Ghia, feeling his thick Greek accent would fit. Brooks thought of Dick Shawn to play Lorenzo &quot;L.S.D.&quot; Saint DuBois, and the actor accepted because he liked the part and currently had no work. Brooks is heard briefly in the film, his voice dubbed over a dancer singing, &quot;Don&#x27;t be stupid, be a smarty / Come and join the Nazi Party&quot;, in the song &quot;Springtime for Hitler&quot;. His version of the line is also dubbed into each performance of the musical, as well as the 2005 movie version.

=== Filming ===
Principal photography for &quot;The Producers&quot; began on May 22, 1967. Filming had to be done in 40 days on a $941,000 budget, and Brooks managed to fit both requests. The primary location was the Chelsea Studios in New York City, where the musical version (2005) was also shot. The now-demolished Playhouse Theatre hosted the &quot;Springtime for Hitler&quot; play, and various actors who heard the film was seeking an actor for Hitler were cast in the musical number. The crew tried to film on location whenever possible, filming at such midtown Manhattan locales as Central Park, the Empire State Building, and Lincoln Center.

Brooks&#x27;s lack of knowledge of filmmaking had him committing many mistakes during production, requiring the help of assistant director Michael Hertzberg. Being both inexperienced and insecure, Brooks started to have tantrums and behave angrily. He got impatient with the slow development compared to how quick television production was, temporarily banned Glazier from the set, berated a visiting reporter from &quot;The New York Times&quot;, and had clashes with cinematographer Joseph Coffey and main actor Zero Mostel. Mostel also had a troublesome behavior caused by a leg injury received in a 1960 bus accident, which made his contract feature a clause dismissing Mostel from any work after 5:30 pm. Given the fact that the leg injury got worse in humid weather, the last scene, filmed at the Revson Fountain in Lincoln Center, had Mostel throwing a fit and giving up on production. Glazier had to leave a dentist&#x27;s appointment and rush to the set where Mostel and Brooks were arguing, and once the producer managed to calm them down, the resulting scene had to be shot all night long.

Despite being described as a lavish production number, &quot;Springtime for Hitler&quot; was not ready until the first rehearsals. Brooks sat with Olsen and first-time composer John Morris at the piano, and improvised some lyrics. Morris then developed the stage performance with choreographer Alan Johnson, instructed to do the number &quot;big, wonderful, flashy, but terrible&quot;. As Brooks kept suggesting bizarre costume ideas to enhance the burlesque nature of &quot;Springtime for Hitler&quot;, such as women with clothes inspired by beer mugs and pretzels, Johnson decided to showcase them all in a parade.

Few scenes had to be altered from the original script. Leo and Max were to visit the Parachute Jump in Coney Island, but the attraction was closed by the time filming began. Brooks filmed Liebkind making Max and Leo swear the Siegfried Oath, where they promised fealty to &quot;Siegfried&quot;, accompanied by &quot;The Ride of the Valkyries&quot; and wearing horned helmets. But feeling that it &quot;went overboard&quot;, Brooks cut the scene, which was restored in the stage adaptation.

The art direction and costumes emphasized the color yellow, which Brooks considered a funny color. For the posters in Bialystock&#x27;s office, production designer Charles Rosen found a collector in the Theater District and doctored a few posters to include the character&#x27;s name. Rosen also incorporated an anecdote of his life, as he had to share a small elevator with a flamboyant Broadway director, to design the lift at Roger De Bris&#x27;s house. Principal photography ended on July 15, 1967. Post-production extended for months, as Brooks had gotten final cut privilege, but still had complaints with Ralph Rosenblum regarding his editing.

== Release ==
According to Brooks, after the film was completed, Embassy executives refused to release it as being in &quot;bad taste&quot;. The film&#x27;s premiere in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, on November 22, 1967, was a disaster and the studio considered shelving it. However, relief came when &quot;Pink Panther&quot; star Peter Sellers saw the film privately and placed an advertisement in &quot;Variety&quot; in support of the film&#x27;s wide release. Sellers was familiar with the film because, according to Brooks, Sellers &quot;had accepted the role of Bloom and then was never heard from again&quot;. The film allegedly was &quot;banned in Germany&quot;. The film was screened in New York City in March 1968. The film&#x27;s wide release took place on March 18, 1968.

The title of the film for the Swedish release uses the translation of the name of the play within the story, &quot;Springtime for Hitler&quot;. As a result of its success, most of Mel Brooks&#x27; subsequent films in Swedish were given similar titles, despite being otherwise unrelated: &quot;Springtime for Mother-In-Law&quot;, 
&quot;Springtime for the Sheriff&quot;, &quot;Springtime for Frankenstein&quot;, &quot;Springtime for the Silent Movies&quot;, &quot;Springtime for the Lunatics&quot;, &quot;Springtime for World History&quot;, &quot;Springtime for Space&quot;, and &quot;Springtime for the Slum&quot;. The practice ended by the time &quot;Robin Hood: Men in Tights&quot; was released, at Brooks&#x27; request.

== Reception ==
When it was first released, the film received a mixed response and garnered some exceptionally harsh reviews, while others considered it a great success. One of the mixed reviews came from Renata Adler, who, writing for &quot;The New York Times,&quot; stated: &quot;&quot;The Producers&quot;, which opened yesterday at the Fine Arts Theater, is a violently mixed bag. Some of it is shoddy and gross and cruel; the rest is funny in an entirely unexpected way.&quot; About the acting, she writes that Mostel is &quot;overacting grotesquely under the direction of Mel Brooks&quot; and that, in the role of Max Bialystock, he is &quot;as gross and unfunny as only an enormous comedian bearing down too hard on some frail, tasteless routines can be&quot;. Co-star Wilder fares better and is called &quot;wonderful&quot;, thanks to doing &quot;fine&quot;, despite being &quot;forced to be as loud and as fast as Mostel&quot; and &quot;[g]oing through long, infinitely variegated riffs and arpeggios of neuroticism&quot;, and playing his part &quot;as though he were Dustin Hoffman being played by Danny Kaye&quot;. She also puts the movie into the bigger context of &quot;contemporary&quot; comedy and that it has the same &quot;episodic, revue quality&quot; in the way it is &quot;not building laughter, but stringing it together skit after skit, some vile, some boffo&quot;. Her early conclusion, at the end of the first paragraph, is also a comparison to other comedic movies of the time, it reads: &quot;[&quot;The Producers&quot;] is less delicate than Lenny Bruce, less funny than &quot;Dr. Strangelove,&quot; but much funnier than &quot;The Loved One&quot; or &quot;What&#x27;s New Pussycat?&quot;&quot;

The more critical and negative reviews partly targeted the directorial style and broad ethnic humor, but also commonly noted the bad taste and insensitivity of devising a broad comedy about two Jews conspiring to cheat theatrical investors by devising a designed-to-fail tasteless Broadway musical about Hitler only 23 years after the end of World War II. Among the harshest critics were Stanley Kauffmann in &quot;The New Republic,&quot; who wrote that &quot;the film bloats into sogginess&quot; and &quot;Springtime for Hitler ... doesn&#x27;t even rise to the level of tastelessness&quot;, John Simon wrote &quot;The Producers&quot; &quot;is a model of how not to make a comedy&quot;, and Pauline Kael who called it &quot;amateurishly crude&quot; in &quot;The New Yorker:&quot;

On the other hand, others considered the film to be a great success. &quot;Time&quot; magazine&#x27;s reviewers wrote that the film was &quot;hilariously funny&quot; but pointed out that &quot;the film is burdened with the kind of plot that demands resolution&quot; but unfortunately &quot;ends in a whimper of sentimentality&quot;. Although they labelled it &quot;disjointed and inconsistent&quot;, they also praised it as &quot;a wildly funny joy ride&quot;, and concluded by saying that &quot;despite its bad moments, [it] is some of the funniest American cinema comedy in years&quot;. The film industry trade paper &quot;Variety&quot; wrote, &quot;The film is unmatched in the scenes featuring Mostel and Wilder alone together, and several episodes with other actors are truly rare.&quot;

Over the years, the film has gained in stature. On Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 91% based on 74 reviews with an average rating of 8.2/10. The website&#x27;s critical consensus reads, &quot;A hilarious satire of the business side of Hollywood, &quot;The Producers&quot; is one of Mel Brooks&#x27; finest, as well as funniest films, featuring standout performances by Gene Wilder and Zero Mostel.&quot; On Metacritic, the film received a score of 96 based on 6 reviews, indicating &quot;universal acclaim&quot;. In his review decades later, Roger Ebert claimed, &quot;this is one of the funniest movies ever made&quot;. Ebert wrote, &quot;I remember finding myself in an elevator with Brooks and his wife, actress Anne Bancroft, in New York City a few months after &quot;The Producers&quot; was released. A woman got onto the elevator, recognized him and said, &#x27;I have to tell you, Mr. Brooks, that your movie is vulgar.&#x27; Brooks smiled benevolently. &#x27;Lady,&#x27; he said, &#x27;it rose below vulgarity.

The film was a sleeper hit at the U.S. box office; But Embassy Pictures deemed its initial theatrical run a flop -- considering the additional costs to market and distribute, it barely broke even at the box-office.

===Accolades===
In 1996, the film was deemed &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant&quot; by the United States Library of Congress and selected for preservation in the National Film Registry.

The film is recognized by American Film Institute in these lists:
* 2000: AFI&#x27;s 100 Years...100 Laughs – #11
* 2004: AFI&#x27;s 100 Years...100 Songs:
** &quot;Springtime for Hitler&quot; – #80

== Re-releases and adaptations ==
In 2002, &quot;The Producers&quot; was re-released in three theaters by Rialto Pictures and earned $111,866 at the box office. As of 2007, the film continues to be distributed to art-film and repertory cinemas by Rialto.

Mel Brooks has adapted the story twice more, as a Broadway musical (&quot;The Producers,&quot; 2001) and a film based on the musical (&quot;The Producers,&quot; 2005). He did not direct the latter, but served as a producer. Unlike the original film, it was not commercially successful.

This film has spawned several home media releases on VHS, Laserdisc, CED, and VCD from companies such as Magnetic Video, Embassy Home Entertainment, PolyGram Video, Speedy, and Lumiere Video. A 1997 letterbox edition Laserdisc was released by PolyGram Video, which served as the basis for the extremely rare 1998 PolyGram DVD release.

Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, which owns video rights to select Embassy Pictures titles that ended up with Nelson Entertainment and Polygram, released &quot;The Producers&quot; on Region 1 DVD in 2002 and reissued in 2005 to coincide with the remake released that year. In 2013, MGM licensed the title to Shout! Factory to release a DVD and Blu-ray combo pack with a new HD transfer and newly produced bonus materials. StudioCanal, worldwide rights holder to all of the Embassy Pictures library, has also released several R2 DVD editions using a transfer slightly different from the North American DVD and Blu-Ray releases. In 2018, StudioCanal gave the film its European Blu-Ray debut in the UK, Germany, and Australia. The StudioCanal releases included most extras from the Shout! Factory release as well as a new 4K restoration for a 50th anniversary Blu-ray edition.

<text>The Great Gatsby is a 1925 novel by American writer F. Scott Fitzgerald. Set in the Jazz Age on Long Island, near New York City, the novel depicts first-person narrator Nick Carraway&#x27;s interactions with Jay Gatsby, the mysterious millionaire with an obsession to reunite with his former lover, Daisy Buchanan.

The novel was inspired by a youthful romance Fitzgerald had with socialite Ginevra King, and the riotous parties he attended on Long Island&#x27;s North Shore in 1922. Following a move to the French Riviera, Fitzgerald completed a rough draft of the novel in 1924. He submitted it to editor Maxwell Perkins, who persuaded Fitzgerald to revise the work over the following winter. After making revisions, Fitzgerald was satisfied with the text, but remained ambivalent about the book&#x27;s title and considered several alternatives. Painter Francis Cugat&#x27;s dust jacket art, named &quot;Celestial Eyes&quot;, greatly impressed Fitzgerald, and he incorporated its imagery into the novel.

After its publication by Scribner&#x27;s in April 1925, &quot;The Great Gatsby&quot; received generally favorable reviews, though some literary critics believed it did not equal Fitzgerald&#x27;s previous efforts. Compared to his earlier novels, &quot;This Side of Paradise&quot; (1920) and &quot;The Beautiful and Damned&quot; (1922), the novel was a commercial disappointment. It sold fewer than 20,000 copies by October, and Fitzgerald&#x27;s hopes of a monetary windfall from the novel were unrealized. When the author died in 1940, he believed himself to be a failure and his work forgotten.

During World War II, the novel experienced an abrupt surge in popularity when the Council on Books in Wartime distributed free copies to American soldiers serving overseas. This new-found popularity launched a critical and scholarly re-examination, and the work soon became a core part of most American high school curricula and a part of American popular culture. Numerous stage and film adaptations followed in the subsequent decades.

&quot;Gatsby&quot; continues to attract popular and scholarly attention. Scholars emphasize the novel&#x27;s treatment of social class, inherited versus self-made wealth, gender, race, and environmentalism, and its cynical attitude towards the American Dream. &quot;The Great Gatsby&quot; is widely considered to be a literary masterpiece and a contender for the title of the Great American Novel.

== Historical and biographical context ==

Set on the prosperous Long Island of 1922, &quot;The Great Gatsby&quot; provides a critical social history of Prohibition-era America during the Jazz Age. F. Scott Fitzgerald&#x27;s fictional narrative fully renders that period—known for its jazz music, economic prosperity, flapper culture, libertine mores, rebellious youth, and ubiquitous speakeasies. Fitzgerald uses many of these 1920s societal developments to tell his story, from simple details like petting in automobiles to broader themes such as bootlegging as the illicit source of Gatsby&#x27;s fortune.

Fitzgerald conveys the hedonism of Jazz Age society by following a down-to-earth narrator as a spectator of the most raucous and flashiest era in American history. In Fitzgerald&#x27;s eyes, the era represented a morally permissive time when Americans of all ages became disillusioned with prevailing social norms and obsessed with pleasure-seeking. Fitzgerald himself had a certain ambivalence towards the Jazz Age, an era whose themes he would later regard as reflective of events in his own life.

&quot;The Great Gatsby&quot; reflects various events in Fitzgerald&#x27;s youth. He was a young Midwesterner from Minnesota. Like the novel&#x27;s narrator who went to Yale, he was educated at an Ivy League school, Princeton. There the 18-year-old Fitzgerald met Ginevra King, a 16-year-old socialite with whom he fell deeply in love. Although Ginevra was madly in love with him, her upper-class family openly discouraged his courtship of their daughter because of his lower-class status, and her father purportedly told him that &quot;poor boys shouldn&#x27;t think of marrying rich girls&quot;.

Rejected by Ginevra&#x27;s family as a suitor because of his lack of financial prospects, a suicidal Fitzgerald enlisted in the United States Army amid World War I and was commissioned as a second lieutenant. While awaiting deployment to the Western front where he hoped to die in combat, he was stationed at Camp Sheridan in Montgomery, Alabama, where he met Zelda Sayre, a vivacious 17-year-old Southern belle. After learning that Ginevra had married wealthy Chicago businessman William &quot;Bill&quot; Mitchell, Fitzgerald asked Zelda to marry him. Zelda agreed but postponed their marriage until he became financially successful. Fitzgerald is thus similar to Jay Gatsby in that he became engaged while a military officer stationed far from home and then sought immense wealth in order to provide for the lifestyle to which his fiancée had become accustomed.

After his success as a short-story writer and as a novelist, Fitzgerald married Zelda in New York City, and the newly-wed couple soon relocated to Long Island. Despite enjoying the exclusive Long Island milieu, Fitzgerald quietly disapproved of the extravagant parties, and the wealthy persons he encountered often disappointed him. While striving to emulate the rich, he found their privileged lifestyle to be morally disquieting. Although Fitzgerald—like Gatsby—had always admired the rich, he nonetheless possessed a smoldering resentment towards them.

== Plot summary ==

In spring 1922, Nick Carraway—a Yale alumnus from the Midwest and a World War I veteran—journeys to New York City to obtain employment as a bond salesman. He rents a bungalow in the Long Island village of West Egg, next to a luxurious estate inhabited by Jay Gatsby, an enigmatic multi-millionaire who hosts dazzling soirées yet does not partake in them.

One evening, Nick dines with a distant cousin, Daisy Buchanan, in the old money town of East Egg. Daisy is married to Tom Buchanan, formerly a Yale football star whom Nick knew during his college days. The couple has recently relocated from Chicago to a mansion directly across the bay from Gatsby&#x27;s estate. There, Nick encounters Jordan Baker, an insolent flapper and golf champion who is a childhood friend of Daisy&#x27;s. Jordan confides to Nick that Tom keeps a mistress, Myrtle Wilson, who brazenly telephones him at his home and who lives in the &quot;valley of ashes&quot;, a sprawling refuse dump. That evening, Nick sees Gatsby standing alone on his lawn, staring at a green light across the bay.

Days later, Nick reluctantly accompanies a drunken and agitated Tom to New York City by train. En route, they stop at a garage inhabited by mechanic George Wilson and his wife Myrtle. Myrtle joins them, and the trio proceed to a small New York apartment that Tom has rented for trysts with her. Guests arrive and a party ensues, which ends with Tom slapping Myrtle and breaking her nose after she mentions Daisy.

One morning, Nick receives a formal invitation to a party at Gatsby&#x27;s mansion. Once there, Nick is embarrassed that he recognizes no one and begins drinking heavily until he encounters Jordan. While chatting with her, he is approached by a man who introduces himself as Jay Gatsby and insists that both he and Nick served in the 3rd Infantry Division during the war. Gatsby attempts to ingratiate himself with Nick and when Nick leaves the party, he notices Gatsby watching him.

In late July, Nick and Gatsby have lunch at a speakeasy. Gatsby tries impressing Nick with tales of his war heroism and his Oxford days. Afterward, Nick meets Jordan again at the Plaza Hotel. Jordan reveals that Gatsby and Daisy met around 1917 when Gatsby was an officer in the American Expeditionary Forces. They fell in love, but when Gatsby was deployed overseas, Daisy reluctantly married Tom. Gatsby hopes that his newfound wealth and dazzling parties will make Daisy reconsider. Gatsby uses Nick to stage a reunion with Daisy, and the two embark upon an affair.

In September, Tom discovers the affair when Daisy carelessly addresses Gatsby with unabashed intimacy in front of him. Later, at a Plaza Hotel suite, Gatsby and Tom argue about the affair. Gatsby insists Daisy declare that she never loved Tom. Daisy claims she loves Tom and Gatsby, upsetting both. Tom reveals Gatsby is a swindler whose money comes from bootlegging alcohol. Upon hearing this, Daisy chooses to stay with Tom. Tom scornfully tells Gatsby to drive her home, knowing that Daisy will never leave him.

While returning to East Egg, Gatsby and Daisy drive by Wilson&#x27;s garage and their car strikes Myrtle, killing her instantly. Later Gatsby reveals to Nick that Daisy was driving the car, but that he intends to take the blame for the accident to protect her. Nick urges Gatsby to flee to avoid prosecution, but he refuses. After Tom tells George that Gatsby owns the car that struck Myrtle, a distraught George assumes the owner of the vehicle must be Myrtle&#x27;s lover. George fatally shoots Gatsby in his mansion&#x27;s swimming pool, then kills himself.

Several days after Gatsby&#x27;s murder, his father Henry Gatz arrives for the sparsely attended funeral. After Gatsby&#x27;s death, Nick comes to hate New York and decides that Gatsby, Daisy, Tom, and he were all Midwesterners unsuited to Eastern life. Nick encounters Tom and initially refuses to shake his hand. Tom admits he was the one who told George that Gatsby owned the vehicle that killed Myrtle. Before returning to the Midwest, Nick returns to Gatsby&#x27;s mansion and stares across the bay at the green light emanating from the end of Daisy&#x27;s dock.
== Major characters ==

* Nick Carrawaya Yale University alumnus from the Midwest, a World veteran, and a newly arrived resident of West Egg, age 29 (later 30) who serves as the first-person narrator. He is Gatsby&#x27;s neighbor and a bond salesman. Nick is easy-going and optimistic, although this latter quality fades as the novel progresses. He ultimately returns to the Midwest after despairing of the decadence and indifference of the eastern United States.
* Jay Gatsby (originally James &quot;Jimmy&quot; Gatz)a young, mysterious millionaire with shady business connections (later revealed to be a bootlegger), originally from North Dakota. During World , when he was a young military officer stationed at the United States Army&#x27;s Camp Taylor in Louisville, Kentucky, Gatsby encountered the love of his life, the debutante Daisy Buchanan. Later, after the war, he studied briefly at Trinity College, Oxford, in England. According to Fitzgerald&#x27;s wife Zelda, he partly based Gatsby on their enigmatic Long Island neighbor, Max Gerlach. A military veteran, Gerlach became a self-made millionaire due to his bootlegging endeavors and was fond of using the phrase &quot;old sport&quot; in his letters to Fitzgerald.
* Daisy Buchanana shallow, self-absorbed, and young debutante and socialite from Louisville, Kentucky, identified as a flapper. She is Nick&#x27;s second cousin, once removed, and the wife of Tom Buchanan. Before marrying Tom, Daisy had a romantic relationship with Gatsby. Her choice between Gatsby and Tom is one of the novel&#x27;s central conflicts. Fitzgerald&#x27;s romance and life-long obsession with Ginevra King inspired the character of Daisy.
* Thomas &quot;Tom&quot; BuchananDaisy&#x27;s husband, a millionaire who lives in East Egg. Tom is an imposing man of muscular build with a gruff voice and contemptuous demeanor. He was a football star at Yale and is a white supremacist. Among other literary models, Tom has certain parallels with William &quot;Bill&quot; Mitchell, the Chicago businessman who married Ginevra King. Tom and Mitchell were both Chicagoans with an interest in polo. Also, like Ginevra&#x27;s father Charles King, whom Fitzgerald resented, Tom is an imperious Yale man and polo player from Lake Forest, Illinois.
* Jordan Bakeran amateur golfer with a sarcastic streak and an aloof attitude, and Daisy&#x27;s long-time friend. She is Nick Carraway&#x27;s girlfriend for most of the novel, though they grow apart towards the end. She has a shady reputation because of rumors that she had cheated in a tournament, which harmed her reputation both socially and as a golfer. Fitzgerald based Jordan on Ginevra&#x27;s friend Edith Cummings, a premier amateur golfer known in the press as &quot;The Fairway Flapper&quot;. Unlike Jordan Baker, Cummings was never suspected of cheating. The character&#x27;s name is a play on two popular automobile brands, the Jordan Motor Car Company and the Baker Motor Vehicle, both of Cleveland, Ohio, alluding to Jordan&#x27;s &quot;fast&quot; reputation and the new freedom presented to American women, especially flappers, in the 1920s.
* George B. Wilsona mechanic and owner of a garage. He is disliked by both his wife, Myrtle Wilson, and Tom Buchanan, who describes him as &quot;so dumb he doesn&#x27;t know he&#x27;s alive&quot;. At the end of the novel, George shoots Gatsby dead, wrongly believing he had been driving the car that killed Myrtle, and then kills himself.
* Myrtle WilsonGeorge&#x27;s wife and Tom Buchanan&#x27;s mistress. Myrtle, who possesses a fierce vitality, is desperate to find refuge from her disappointing marriage. She is accidentally killed by Gatsby&#x27;s car, as she mistakenly thinks Tom is still driving it and runs after it.
== Writing and production ==

Fitzgerald began outlining his third novel in June 1922. He longed to produce an exquisite work that was beautiful and intricately patterned, but the troubled production of his stage play &quot;The Vegetable&quot; repeatedly interrupted his progress. The play flopped, and Fitzgerald wrote magazine stories that winter to pay debts incurred by its production. He viewed these stories as all worthless, although included among them was &quot;Winter Dreams&quot;, which Fitzgerald described as his first attempt at the Gatsby idea. &quot;The whole idea of Gatsby&quot;, he later explained to a friend, &quot;is the unfairness of a poor young man not being able to marry a girl with money. This theme comes up again and again because I lived it&quot;.

In October 1922, after the birth of their only child, Frances Scott &quot;Scottie&quot; Fitzgerald, the Fitzgeralds moved to Great Neck, New York, on Long Island. Their neighbors in Great Neck included such newly wealthy personages as writer Ring Lardner, actor Lew Fields and comedian Ed Wynn. These figures were all considered to be &quot;nouveau riche&quot;, unlike those who came from Manhasset Neck, which sat across the bay from Great Neck—places that were home to many of New York&#x27;s wealthiest established families. This real-life juxtaposition gave Fitzgerald his idea for &quot;West Egg&quot; and &quot;East Egg&quot;. In the novel, Great Neck (Kings Point) became the &quot;new money&quot; peninsula of West Egg and Port Washington (Sands Point) became the &quot;old money&quot; East Egg. Several Gold Coast mansions in the area served as inspiration for Gatsby&#x27;s estate including Land&#x27;s End, Oheka Castle, and the since-demolished Beacon Towers.

While living on Long Island, the Fitzgeralds&#x27; enigmatic neighbor was Max Gerlach. Purportedly born in America to a German immigrant family, Gerlach had been a major in the American Expeditionary Forces during World War I, and he later became a gentleman bootlegger who lived like a millionaire in New York. Flaunting his new wealth, Gerlach threw lavish parties, never wore the same shirt twice, used the phrase &quot;old sport&quot;, and fostered myths about himself including that he was a relation of the German Kaiser. These details about Gerlach inspired Fitzgerald in his creation of Jay Gatsby.

During this same time period, the daily newspapers sensationalized the Hall–Mills murder case over many months, and the highly publicized case likely influenced the plot of Fitzgerald&#x27;s novel. The case involved the double-murder of a man and his lover on September 14, 1922, mere weeks before Fitzgerald arrived in Great Neck. Scholars have speculated that Fitzgerald based certain aspects of the ending of &quot;The Great Gatsby&quot; and various characterizations on this factual incident.

Inspired by the Halls–Mills case, the mysterious persona of Gerlach and the riotous parties he attended on Long Island, Fitzgerald had written 18,000 words for his novel by mid-1923 but discarded most of his new story as a false start. Some of this early draft resurfaced in the 1924 short story &quot;Absolution&quot;. In earlier drafts, Daisy was originally named Ada and Nick was Dud, and the two characters had shared a previous romance prior to their reunion on Long Island. These earlier drafts were written from the viewpoint of an omniscient narrator as opposed to Nick&#x27;s perspective. A key difference in earlier drafts is a less complete failure of Gatsby&#x27;s dream. Another difference is that the argument between Tom Buchanan and Gatsby is more balanced, although Daisy still returns to Tom.

Work on &quot;The Great Gatsby&quot; resumed in earnest in April 1924. Fitzgerald decided to depart from the writing process of his previous novels and told Perkins that he was intent on creating an artistic achievement. He wished to eschew the realism of his previous two novels and to compose a creative work of sustained imagination. To this end, he consciously imitated the literary styles of Joseph Conrad and Willa Cather. He was particularly influenced by Cather&#x27;s 1923 work, &quot;A Lost Lady,&quot; which features a wealthy married socialite pursued by a variety of romantic suitors and who symbolically embodies the American dream. He later wrote a letter to Cather apologizing for any unintentional plagiarism. During this period of revisions, Scott saw and was influenced by early sketches for the book&#x27;s dust jacket art. Soon after this burst of effort, work slowed while the Fitzgeralds moved to the Villa Marie in Saint-Raphaël on the French Riviera, where a marital crisis soon developed.

Despite his ongoing marital tension, Fitzgerald continued to write steadily and submitted a near-final version of the manuscript to his editor, Maxwell Perkins, on October 27. Perkins informed him in a November letter that Gatsby was too vague as a character and that his wealth and business, respectively, needed a convincing explanation. Fitzgerald thanked Perkins for his detailed criticisms and claimed that such feedback would enable him to perfect the manuscript. Having relocated with his wife to Rome, Fitzgerald made revisions to the manuscript throughout the winter.

Content after a few rounds of revision, Fitzgerald submitted the final version in February 1925. Fitzgerald&#x27;s alterations included extensive revisions of the sixth and eighth chapters. He declined an offer of $10,000 for the serial rights to the book so that it could be published sooner. He received a $3,939 advance in 1923 and would receive $1,981.25 upon publication.

=== Alternative titles ===
Fitzgerald had difficulty choosing a title for his novel and entertained many choices before reluctantly deciding on &quot;The Great Gatsby&quot;, a title inspired by Alain-Fournier&#x27;s &quot;Le Grand Meaulnes&quot;. Previously he had shifted between &quot;Among Ash Heaps and Millionaires&quot;, &quot;Trimalchio&quot;, &quot;Trimalchio in West Egg&quot;, &quot;On the Road to West Egg&quot;, &quot;Under the Red, White, and Blue&quot;, &quot;The Gold-Hatted Gatsby&quot;, and &quot;The High-Bouncing Lover&quot;. The titles &quot;The Gold-Hatted Gatsby&quot; and &quot;The High-Bouncing Lover&quot; came from Fitzgerald&#x27;s epigraph for the novel, one which he wrote himself under the pen name of Thomas Parke D&#x27;Invilliers.

Fitzgerald initially preferred titles referencing Trimalchio, the crude upstart in Petronius&#x27;s &quot;Satyricon&quot;, and even refers to Gatsby as Trimalchio once in the novel.
Unlike Gatsby&#x27;s spectacular parties, Trimalchio participated in the orgies he hosted but, according to literary critic Tony Tanner, there are subtle similarities between the two characters. By November 1924, Fitzgerald wrote to Perkins that he had settled upon the title of &quot;Trimalchio in West Egg&quot;.

Disliking Fitzgerald&#x27;s chosen title of &quot;Trimalchio in West Egg&quot;, editor Max Perkins persuaded him that the reference was too obscure and that people would be unable to pronounce it. Zelda and Perkins both expressed their preference for &quot;The Great Gatsby&quot;, and the next month Fitzgerald agreed. A month before publication, after a final review of the proofs, he asked if it would be possible to re-title it &quot;Trimalchio&quot; or &quot;Gold-Hatted Gatsby&quot;, but Perkins advised against it. On March 19, 1925, Fitzgerald expressed enthusiasm for the title &quot;Under the Red, White, and Blue&quot;, but it was too late to change it at that stage. The novel was published as &quot;The Great Gatsby&quot; on April 10, 1925. Fitzgerald believed the book&#x27;s final title to be merely acceptable and often expressed his ambivalence with the name.

=== Dust jacket art ===

The artwork for the first edition of &quot;The Great Gatsby,&quot; known as &quot;Celestial Eyes,&quot; is among the most celebrated in American literature and represents a unique instance in literary history in which a novel&#x27;s commissioned artwork directly influenced the composition of the text. Rendered in an Art Deco visual style, the artwork depicts the disembodied face of a Jazz Age flapper with celestial eyes and rouged mouth over a dark blue skyline. A little-known Barcelonan painter named Francis Cugat—born Francisco Coradal-Cougat—was commissioned by an unknown individual in Scribner&#x27;s art department to illustrate the cover while Fitzgerald was composing the novel.

In a preliminary sketch, Cugat drew a concept of a dismal gray landscape inspired by Fitzgerald&#x27;s original title for the novel, &quot;Among Ash Heaps and Millionaires&quot;. Discarding this gloomy concept, Cugat next drew a divergent study which became the prefiguration to the final cover: A pencil and crayon drawing of a flapper&#x27;s half-hidden visage over Long Island Sound with scarlet lips, one celestial eye, and a single diagonal tear. Expanding upon this study, his subsequent drawing featured two bright eyes looming over a shadowy New York cityscape. In later iterations, Cugat replaced the shadowy cityscape with dazzling carnival lights evoking a Ferris wheel and likely referencing the glittering amusement park at New York&#x27;s Coney Island. Cugat affixed reclining nudes within the flapper&#x27;s irises and added a green tint to the streaming tear. Cugat&#x27;s final cover, which Max Perkins hailed as a masterpiece, was the only work he completed for Scribner&#x27;s and the only book cover he ever designed.

Although Fitzgerald likely never saw the final gouache painting prior to the novel&#x27;s publication, Cugat&#x27;s preparatory drafts influenced his writing. Upon viewing Cugat&#x27;s drafts before sailing for France in April–May 1924, Fitzgerald was so enamored that he later told editor Max Perkins that he had incorporated Cugat&#x27;s imagery into the novel. This statement has led many to analyze interrelations between Cugat&#x27;s art and Fitzgerald&#x27;s text. One popular interpretation is that the celestial eyes are reminiscent of those of optometrist T. J. Eckleburg depicted on a faded commercial billboard near George Wilson&#x27;s auto repair shop. Author Ernest Hemingway supported this latter interpretation and claimed that Fitzgerald had told him the cover referred to a billboard in the valley of the ashes. Although this passage has some resemblance to the imagery, a closer explanation can be found in Fitzgerald&#x27;s explicit description of Daisy Buchanan as the &quot;girl whose disembodied face floated along the dark cornices and blinding signs&quot;.

== Critical reception ==
=== Initial reviews ===
Charles Scribner&#x27;s Sons published &quot;The Great Gatsby&quot; on April 10, 1925. Fitzgerald cabled Perkins the day after publication to monitor reviews: &quot;Any news?&quot; &quot;Sales situation doubtful [but] excellent reviews&quot;, read a telegram from Perkins on April 20. Fitzgerald responded on April 24, saying the cable dispirited him, closing the letter with &quot;Yours in great depression&quot;. Fitzgerald soon received letters from contemporaries Willa Cather, Edith Wharton, and poet T. S. Eliot praising the novel. Although gratified by such correspondence, Fitzgerald sought public acclaim from professional critics.

&quot;The Great Gatsby&quot; received generally favorable reviews from literary critics of the day. Edwin Clark of &quot;The New York Times&quot; felt the novel was a mystical and glamorous tale of the Jazz Age. Similarly, Lillian C. Ford of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; hailed the novel as a revelatory work of art that &quot;leaves the reader in a mood of chastened wonder&quot;. The &quot;New York Post&quot; described Fitzgerald&#x27;s prose style as scintillating and genuinely brilliant. The &quot;New York Herald Tribune&quot; was less impressed, referring to &quot;The Great Gatsby&quot; as &quot;a literary lemon meringue&quot; that nonetheless &quot;contains some of the nicest little touches of contemporary observation you could imagine—so light, so delicate, so sharp&quot;. In &quot;The Chicago Daily Tribune&quot;, H. L. Mencken judged the work&#x27;s plot to be highly improbable, although he praised the writing as elegant and the &quot;careful and brilliant finish&quot;.

Several reviewers felt the novel left much to be desired following Fitzgerald&#x27;s previous works and criticized him accordingly. Harvey Eagleton of &quot;The Dallas Morning News&quot; predicted that the novel signaled the end of Fitzgerald&#x27;s artistic success. Ralph Coghlan of the &quot;St. Louis Post-Dispatch&quot; dismissed the work as an inconsequential performance by a once-promising author who had grown bored and cynical. Ruth Snyder of &quot;New York Evening World&quot; lambasted the book&#x27;s style as painfully forced and declared the editors of her newspaper were &quot;quite convinced after reading &quot;The Great Gatsby&quot; that Mr. Fitzgerald is not one of the great American writers of today&quot;. John McClure of &quot;The Times-Picayune&quot; insisted the plot was implausible and the book itself seemed raw in its construction.

After reading these reviews, Fitzgerald believed that many critics misunderstood the novel. He despaired that &quot;of all the reviews, even the most enthusiastic, not one had the slightest idea what the book was about&quot;. In particular, Fitzgerald resented criticisms of the novel&#x27;s plot as implausible since he had never intended for the story to be realistic. Instead, he crafted the work to be a romanticized depiction that was largely scenic and symbolic. According to his friend John Peale Bishop, Fitzgerald further resented the fact that critics failed to perceive the many parallels between the author&#x27;s life and the character of Jay Gatsby; in particular, that both created a mythical version of themselves and attempted to live up to this legend. Dispirited by critics failing to understand the novel, Fitzgerald remained hopeful that the novel would at least be a commercial success, perhaps selling as many as 75,000 copies.

To Fitzgerald&#x27;s great disappointment, &quot;Gatsby&quot; was a commercial failure in comparison with his previous efforts, &quot;This Side of Paradise&quot; (1920) and &quot;The Beautiful and Damned&quot; (1922). By October, the book had sold fewer than 20,000 copies.
Although the novel went through two initial printings, many copies remained unsold years later. Fitzgerald attributed the poor sales to the fact that women tended to be the primary audience for novels during this time, and &quot;Gatsby&quot; did not contain an admirable female character. According to his ledger, he earned only $2,000 from the book. Although Owen Davis&#x27; 1926 stage adaptation and the Paramount-issued silent film version brought in money for the author, Fitzgerald lamented that the novel fell far short of the success he had hoped for and would not bring him recognition as a serious novelist in the public eye. With the onset of the Great Depression, &quot;The Great Gatsby&quot; was regarded as little more than a nostalgic period piece. By the time Fitzgerald died in 1940, the novel had fallen into near obscurity.

=== Revival and reassessment ===
In 1940, Fitzgerald suffered a third and fatal heart attack and died believing his work forgotten. His obituary in &quot;The New York Times&quot; hailed him as a brilliant novelist and cited &quot;Gatsby&quot; as his greatest work. In the wake of Fitzgerald&#x27;s death, a strong appreciation for the book gradually developed in writers&#x27; circles. Future authors Budd Schulberg and Edward Newhouse were deeply affected by it, and John O&#x27;Hara acknowledged its influence on his work. By the time that &quot;Gatsby&quot; was republished in Edmund Wilson&#x27;s edition of &quot;The Last Tycoon&quot; in 1941, the prevailing opinion in writers&#x27; circles deemed the novel to be an enduring work of fiction.

In the spring of 1942, mere months after the United States&#x27; entrance into World War II, an association of publishing executives created the Council on Books in Wartime with the stated purpose of distributing paperback Armed Services Editions books to combat troops. &quot;The Great Gatsby&quot; was one of them. Within the next several years, 155,000 copies of &quot;Gatsby&quot; were distributed to U.S. soldiers overseas, and the book proved popular among beleaguered troops, according to the &quot;Saturday Evening Post&quot;″s 1945 report.

By 1944, a full-scale Fitzgerald revival had occurred. Full-length scholarly articles on Fitzgerald&#x27;s works were being published in periodicals and, by the following year, the earlier consensus among professional critics that &quot;The Great Gatsby&quot; was merely a sensational story or a nostalgic period piece had effectively vanished. The tireless promotional efforts of literary critic Edmund Wilson, who was Fitzgerald&#x27;s Princeton classmate and his close friend, led this Fitzgerald revival. In 1951, three years after Zelda&#x27;s death in a hospital fire, Professor Arthur Mizener of Cornell University published &quot;The Far Side of Paradise&quot;, the first biography of Fitzgerald. Mizener&#x27;s bestselling biography emphasized &quot;The Great Gatsby&quot;″s positive reception by literary critics, which may have further influenced public opinion and renewed interest in it.

By 1960—thirty-five years after the novel&#x27;s original publication—the book was steadily selling 100,000 copies per year. Renewed interest in it led &quot;The New York Times&quot; editorialist Mizener to proclaim the novel was a masterwork of 20th-century American literature. By 1974, &quot;The Great Gatsby&quot; had attained its status as a literary masterwork and was deemed a contender for the title of the &quot;Great American Novel&quot;. Hunter S. Thompson retyped pages of &quot;The Great Gatsby&quot; &quot;just to get a feeling of what it was like to write that way.&quot; According to Thompson&#x27;s friend William Nack, Thompson once retyped the entirety of the novel. Roger Ebert wrote that &quot;perhaps Fitzgerald&#x27;s words &#x27;compelled into an aesthetic contemplation he neither understood nor desired&quot;&quot;&#x27; is the best possible description of Thompson&#x27;s life&#x27;s work.&quot; 

By the mid-2000s, many literary critics considered &quot;The Great Gatsby&quot; to be one of the greatest novels ever written, and the work was part of the assigned curricula in the near majority of U.S. high schools. As of early 2020, &quot;The Great Gatsby&quot; had sold almost 30 million copies worldwide and continues to sell an additional 500,000 copies annually. Numerous foreign editions of the novel have been published, and the text has been translated into 42 different languages. The work is Scribner&#x27;s most popular title; in 2013, the e-book alone sold 185,000 copies. The novel&#x27;s U.S. copyright expired on January 1, 2021, when all works published in 1925 entered the public domain. Since then, numerous altered and incomplete reprints have flooded the market.

== Critical analysis ==
=== Major themes ===
==== The American Dream ====
Following the novel&#x27;s revival, later critical writings on &quot;The Great Gatsby&quot; focused on Fitzgerald&#x27;s disillusionment with the American Dream in the hedonistic Jazz Age, a name for the era which Fitzgerald claimed to have coined. In 1970, scholar Roger L. Pearson asserted that Fitzgerald&#x27;s work—more so than other twentieth century novels—is especially linked with this conceptualization of the American dream. Pearson traced the literary origins of this dream to Colonial America. The dream is the belief that every individual, regardless of their origins, may seek and achieve their desired goals, &quot;be they political, monetary, or social. It is the literary expression of the concept of America: The land of opportunity&quot;.

However, Pearson noted that Fitzgerald&#x27;s particular treatment of this theme is devoid of the discernible optimism in the writings of earlier American authors. He suggests Gatsby serves as a false prophet of the American dream, and pursuing the dream only results in dissatisfaction for those who chase it, owing to its unattainability. In this analytical context, the green light on the Buchanans&#x27; dock (visible across Long Island Sound from Gatsby&#x27;s house) is frequently interpreted as a symbol of Gatsby&#x27;s unrealizable goal to win Daisy and, consequently, to achieve the American Dream. Also, scholar Sarah Churchwell points out that adultery in the novel is linked to the loss of faith and broken promises, which symbolizes the corruption of the American Dream.

==== Class permanence ====
Scholars and writers commonly ascribe Gatsby&#x27;s inability to achieve the American Dream to entrenched class disparities in American society. The novel underscores the limits of the American lower class to transcend their station of birth. Scholar Sarah Churchwell contends that Fitzgerald&#x27;s novel is a tale of class warfare in a status-obsessed country that refuses to acknowledge publicly it even has a class system.

Although scholars posit different explanations for the continuation of class differences in the United States, there is a consensus regarding the novel&#x27;s message in conveying its underlying permanence. Although &quot;Gatsby&quot;″s fundamental conflict occurs between entrenched sources of socio-economic power and upstarts like Gatsby who threaten their interests, Fitzgerald&#x27;s novel shows that a class permanence persists despite the country&#x27;s capitalist economy that prizes innovation and adaptability. Dianne Bechtel argues Fitzgerald plotted the novel to illustrate that class transcends wealth in America. Even if the poorer Americans become rich, they remain inferior to those Americans with &quot;old money&quot;. Consequently, Gatsby and other characters in the novel are trapped in a rigid American class system.

==== Gender relations ====

Besides exploring the difficulties of achieving the American dream, &quot;The Great Gatsby&quot; explores societal gender expectations during the Jazz Age. The character of Daisy Buchanan has been identified specifically as personifying the emerging cultural archetype of the flapper. Flappers were typically young, modern women who bobbed their hair and wore short skirts. They also drank alcohol and had premarital sex.

Despite the newfound societal freedoms attained by flappers in the 1920s, Fitzgerald&#x27;s work critically examines the continued limitations upon women&#x27;s agency during this period. In this context, although early critics viewed the character of Daisy to be a &quot;monster of bitchery&quot;, later scholars such as Leland S. Person Jr. asserted that Daisy&#x27;s character exemplifies the marginalization of women in the elite social environment that Fitzgerald depicts.

Writing in 1978, Person noted Daisy is more of a hapless victim than a manipulative victimizer. She is the target first of Tom&#x27;s callous domination and next of Gatsby&#x27;s dehumanizing adoration. She involuntarily becomes the holy grail at the center of Gatsby&#x27;s unrealistic quest to be steadfast to a youthful concept of himself. The ensuing contest of wills between Tom and Gatsby reduces Daisy to a trophy wife whose sole existence is to augment her possessor&#x27;s socio-economic success.

As an upper-class white woman living in East Egg during this time period, Daisy must adhere to societal expectations and gender norms such as actively fulfilling the roles of dutiful wife, nurturing mother, and charming socialite. Many of Daisy&#x27;s choices—ultimately culminating in the fatal car crash and misery for all those involved—can be partly attributed to her prescribed role as a &quot;beautiful little fool&quot; who is reliant on her husband for financial and societal security. Her decision to remain with her husband, despite her feelings for Gatsby, is because of the security that her marriage to Tom Buchanan provides.

==== Race and displacement ====
Many scholars have analyzed the novel&#x27;s treatment of race and displacement; in particular, a perceived threat posed by newer immigrants to older Americans, triggering concerns over a loss of socio-economic status. In one instance, Tom Buchanan—the novel&#x27;s antagonist—claims that he, Nick, and Jordan are racially superior Nordics. Tom decries immigration and advocates white supremacy. A fictional book alluded to by Tom is Goddard&#x27;s &quot;The Rise of the Colored Empires&quot;, which is a parody by Fitzgerald of Lothrop Stoddard&#x27;s &quot;The Rising Tide of Color,&quot; a 1920s bestseller. Stoddard warned that immigration would alter America&#x27;s racial composition and destroy the country.

Analyzing these elements, literary theorist Walter Benn Michaels contends that Fitzgerald&#x27;s novel reflects a historical period in American literature characterized by fears over the influx of Southern and Eastern European immigrants whose &quot;otherness&quot; challenged Americans&#x27; sense of national identity. Such anxieties were more salient in national discourse than the societal consequences of World War I, and the defining question of the period was who constituted &quot;a real American&quot;.

In this context of immigration and displacement, Tom&#x27;s hostility towards Gatsby, who is the embodiment of &quot;latest America&quot;, has been interpreted as partly embodying status anxieties of the time involving anti-immigrant sentiment. Gatsby—whom Tom belittles as &quot;Mr. Nobody from Nowhere&quot;—functions as a cipher because of his obscure origins, his unclear ethno-religious identity and his indeterminate class status. Although his ethnicity is vague, his last name Gatz and his father&#x27;s adherence to the Lutheran religion indicate his family are recent German immigrants. This would preclude them from the coveted status of Old Stock Americans. Consequently, Gatsby&#x27;s socio-economic ascent is deemed a threat not only due to his status as &quot;nouveau riche&quot;, but because he is perceived as an outsider.

Because of such themes, &quot;The Great Gatsby&quot; captures the perennial American experience as it is a story about change and those who resist it—whether such change comes in the form of a new wave of immigrants, the &quot;nouveau riche&quot;, or successful minorities. Since Americans living in the 1920s to the present are largely defined by their fluctuating socio-economic circumstances and must navigate a society with entrenched racial and ethnic prejudices, Fitzgerald&#x27;s depiction of resultant status anxieties and social conflict has been highlighted by scholars as still enduringly relevant nearly a hundred years after the novel&#x27;s publication.

==== Sexuality and identity ====
Questions regarding the sexuality of characters have been raised for decades and—augmented by biographical details about the author—have given rise to queer readings. During his lifetime, Fitzgerald&#x27;s sexuality became a subject of debate among his friends and acquaintances. As a youth, Fitzgerald had a close relationship with Father Sigourney Fay, a possibly gay Catholic priest, and Fitzgerald later used his last name for the idealized romantic character of Daisy Fay. After college, Fitzgerald cross-dressed during outings in Minnesota. Years later, while drafting &quot;The Great Gatsby&quot;, rumors dogged Fitzgerald among the American expat community in Paris that he was gay. Soon after, Fitzgerald&#x27;s wife Zelda Fitzgerald likewise doubted his heterosexuality and asserted that he was a closeted homosexual. She publicly belittled him with homophobic slurs, and she alleged that Fitzgerald and fellow writer Ernest Hemingway engaged in homosexual relations. These incidents strained the Fitzgeralds&#x27; marriage at the time of the novel&#x27;s publication.

Although Fitzgerald&#x27;s sexuality is a subject of scholarly debate, such biographical details lent credence to critical interpretations that his fictional characters are either gay or bisexual surrogates. As early as 1945, critics such as Lionel Trilling noted that characters in &quot;The Great Gatsby&quot;, such as Jordan Baker, were implied to be &quot;vaguely homosexual&quot;, and, in 1960, writer Otto Friedrich commented upon the ease of examining the thwarted relations depicted in Fitzgerald&#x27;s fiction through a queer lens. In recent decades, scholarship has focused sharply on the sexuality of Nick Carraway. In one instance in the novel, Carraway departs a drunken orgy with a &quot;pale, feminine&quot; man named Mr. McKee and—following suggestive ellipses—Nick next finds himself standing beside a bed while McKee sits between the sheets clad only in his underwear. Such scenes have led scholars to describe Nick as possessing an overt queerness and prompted analyses about his emotional attachment to Jay Gatsby. For these reasons, the novel has been described as an exploration of sexual identity during a historical era typified by the societal transition towards modernity.

==== Technology and environment ====
Technological and environmental criticisms of &quot;Gatsby&quot; seek to place the novel and its characters in a broader historical context. In 1964, Leo Marx argued in &quot;The Machine in the Garden&quot; that Fitzgerald&#x27;s work evinces a tension between a complex pastoral ideal of a bygone America and the societal transformations caused by industrialization and machine technology. Specifically, the valley of the ashes, in between East and West Egg, represents a man-made wasteland which is a byproduct of the industrialization that has made Gatsby&#x27;s booming lifestyle, including his automobile, possible. Marx argues that Fitzgerald, via Nick, expresses a pastoral longing typical of other 1920s American writers like William Faulkner and Ernest Hemingway. Although such writers cherish the pastoral ideal, they accept that technological progress has deprived this ideal of nearly all meaning. In this context, Nick&#x27;s repudiation of the eastern United States represents a futile attempt to withdraw into nature. Yet, as Fitzgerald&#x27;s work shows, any technological demarcation between the eastern and western United States has vanished, and one cannot escape into a pastoral past.

In 2018, scholar Kyle Keeler argued that the voracious pursuit of wealth as criticized in Fitzgerald&#x27;s novel offers a warning about the perils of environmental destruction in pursuit of self-interest. According to Kyle Keeler, Gatsby&#x27;s quest for greater status manifests as self-centered, anthropocentric resource acquisition. Inspired by the predatory mining practices of his fictional mentor Dan Cody, Gatsby participates in extensive deforestation amid World War I and then undertakes bootlegging activities reliant upon exploiting South American agriculture. Gatsby conveniently ignores the wasteful devastation of the valley of ashes to pursue a consumerist lifestyle and exacerbates the wealth gap that became increasingly salient in 1920s America. For these reasons, Keeler argues that—while Gatsby&#x27;s socioeconomic ascent and self-transformation depend upon these very factors—each one is nonetheless partially responsible for the ongoing ecological crisis.

=== Antisemitism ===

&quot;The Great Gatsby&quot; has been accused of antisemitism because of its use of Jewish stereotypes. One of the novel&#x27;s supporting characters is Meyer Wolfsheim, a Jewish friend and mentor of Gatsby. A corrupt profiteer who assists Gatsby&#x27;s bootlegging operations and who fixed the 1919 World Series, he appears only twice in the novel, the second time refusing to attend Gatsby&#x27;s funeral. Fitzgerald describes Wolfsheim as &quot;a small, flat-nosed Jew&quot;, with &quot;tiny eyes&quot; and &quot;two fine growths of hair&quot; in his nostrils. Evoking ethnic stereotypes regarding the Jewish nose, he describes Wolfsheim&#x27;s nose as &quot;expressive&quot;, &quot;tragic&quot;, and able to &quot;flash... indignantly&quot;. The fictional character of Wolfsheim is an allusion to real-life Jewish gambler Arnold Rothstein, a notorious New York crime kingpin whom Fitzgerald met once in undetermined circumstances. Rothstein was blamed for match fixing in the Black Sox Scandal that tainted the 1919 World Series.

Wolfsheim has been interpreted as representing the Jewish miser stereotype. Richard Levy, author of &quot;Antisemitism: A Historical Encyclopedia of Prejudice and Persecution&quot;, claims that Wolfsheim serves to link Jewishness with corruption. In a 1947 article for &quot;Commentary&quot;, Milton Hindus, an assistant professor of humanities at the University of Chicago, stated that while he believed the book was a superb literary achievement, Wolfsheim was its most abrasive character, and the work contains an antisemitic undertone. However, Hindus argued the Jewish stereotypes displayed by Wolfsheim were typical of the time when the novel was written and set and that its antisemitism was of the &quot;habitual, customary, &#x27;harmless,&#x27; unpolitical variety&quot;. A 2015 article by essayist Arthur Krystal agreed with Hindus&#x27; assessment that Fitzgerald&#x27;s use of Jewish caricatures was not driven by malice and merely reflected commonly held beliefs of his time. He notes the accounts of Frances Kroll, a Jewish woman and secretary to Fitzgerald, who claimed that Fitzgerald was hurt by accusations of antisemitism and responded to critiques of Wolfsheim by claiming he merely &quot;fulfilled a function in the story and had nothing to do with race or religion&quot;.

== Adaptations ==
=== Stage ===

The first stage adaptation was produced by William Brady, a veteran theatrical producer and promoter of prize fights, who acquired the rights only a few days after first reading the novel in the spring of 1925. The script was written by the American dramatist Owen Davis, who had won a Pulitzer Prize in 1923 for his play, &quot;Icebound&quot;. Davis dramatically altered the structure of the novel, rearranging the action in chronological order, eliminating prominent elements such as the valley of ashes and the scene in the Plaza Hotel, and inventing many minor characters.

The play, directed by George Cukor and starring James Rennie as Gatsby and Florence Eldridge as Daisy, opened on Broadway on February 2, 1926. It was well received by critics and the public, and the run was extended past the originally scheduled closing date, finally ending on May 22, after 112 performances. The production, with some changes in the cast, then moved to Chicago, where it opened on August 1. Its popularity again led to an extension of the run, which came to an end in late September. A brief one-week return engagement at New York&#x27;s Shubert Theater began on October 4, after which a road production traveled to several other cities, including Baltimore, Philadelphia, Detroit, St. Louis, Denver, and Minneapolis.

In July 2006, a stage adaptation by written by Simon Levy and directed by David Esbjornson premiered at the Guthrie Theater in Minneapolis to celebrate the opening of its new building. In 2010, critic Ben Brantley of &quot;The New York Times&quot; highly praised the debut of &quot;Gatz&quot;, an Off-Broadway staging of the novel&#x27;s full text by Elevator Repair Service.

The New York Metropolitan Opera commissioned John Harbison to compose an operatic treatment of the novel to commemorate the 25th anniversary of James Levine&#x27;s debut. The work, called &quot;The Great Gatsby&quot;, premiered on December 20, 1999.

The novel has also been adapted for ballet performances. In 2009, BalletMet premiered a version at the Capitol Theatre in Columbus, Ohio. In 2010, The Washington Ballet premiered a version at the Kennedy Center. The show received an encore run the following year. The Comedy Theatre of Budapest created a musical.

Also, in 2023, the second musical adaptation, with music and lyrics by Jason Howland and Nathan Tysen and a book by Kait Kerrigan announced a one-month limited engagement at the Paper Mill Playhouse. The Broadway tryout began its previews on October 12, 2023, followed by an official opening night scheduled for ten days later. The production concluded on November 12 of the same year. Jeremy Jordan and Eva Noblezada starred as the leading roles of Jay Gatsby and Daisy Buchanan, with Samantha Pauly and Noah J. Ricketts as Jordan Baker and Nick Carraway. The production transferred to Broadway for previews on March 29, 2024, and opened officially on April 25th, 2024.

In Spring 2024, &quot;&quot;, a third musical adaptation with music and lyrics by Florence Welch and Thomas Bartlett and a book by Martyna Majok premiered at the American Repertory Theater. On May 25, 2024, the show began previews and opened officially on June 5 of the same year. It plans to run until closing night set for August 3rd, 2024.

===Film===

The first film version of the novel appeared in 1926. A version of Owen Davis&#x27;s Broadway play of the same year, it was directed by Herbert Brenon and starred Warner Baxter, Lois Wilson and William Powell. It is a famous example of a lost film. Reviews suggest it may have been the most faithful adaptation of the novel, but a trailer of the film at the National Archives is all that is known to exist. Reportedly, Fitzgerald and his wife Zelda loathed the silent version. Zelda wrote to an acquaintance that the film was &quot;rotten&quot;. She and Scott left the cinema midway through the film.

Following the 1926 film was 1949&#x27;s &quot;The Great Gatsby&quot;, directed by Elliott Nugent and starring Alan Ladd, Betty Field and Macdonald Carey. Twenty-five years later in 1974, &quot;The Great Gatsby&quot; appeared onscreen again. It was directed by Jack Clayton and starred Robert Redford as Gatsby, Mia Farrow as Daisy, and Sam Waterston as Nick Carraway. Most recently, &quot;The Great Gatsby&quot; was directed by Baz Luhrmann in 2013 and starred Leonardo DiCaprio as Gatsby, Carey Mulligan as Daisy, and Tobey Maguire as Nick.

In 2021, visual effects company DNEG Animation announced they would be producing an animated film adaptation of the novel directed by William Joyce and written by Brian Selznick.

=== Television ===
&quot;Gatsby&quot; has been retold as a short-form television movie multiple times. The first was in 1955 as an NBC episode for &quot;Robert Montgomery Presents&quot; starring Robert Montgomery, Phyllis Kirk, and Lee Bowman. The episode was directed by Alvin Sapinsley. In 1958, CBS filmed another adaptation as an episode of &quot;Playhouse 90&quot;, also titled &quot;The Great Gatsby,&quot; which was directed by Franklin J. Schaffner and starred Robert Ryan, Jeanne Crain and Rod Taylor. Most recently, the novel was adapted as an A&amp;E movie in 2000. &quot;The Great Gatsby&quot; was directed by Robert Markowitz and starred Toby Stephens as Gatsby, Mira Sorvino as Daisy, and Paul Rudd as Nick.

===Literature===
Since entering the public domain in 2021, retellings and expansions of &quot;The Great Gatsby&quot; have become legal to publish. &quot;Nick&quot; by Michael Farris Smith (2021) imagines the backstory of Nick Carraway. That same year saw the publication of &quot;The Chosen and the Beautiful&quot; by Nghi Vo, a retelling with elements of the fantasy genre while tackling issues of race and sexuality, and &quot;The Pursued and the Pursuing&quot; by AJ Odasso, a queer partial retelling and sequel in which Jay Gatsby survives. Anna-Marie McLemore&#x27;s own queer retelling, &quot;Self-Made Boys: A Great Gatsby Remix&quot;, was released in 2022 and was longlisted for the National Book Award for Young People&#x27;s Literature.

=== Graphic novels ===
&quot;The Great Gatsby&quot; has been adapted into three graphic novels. The first was in 2007 by Nicki Greenberg, who published &quot;The Great Gatsby: A Graphic Adaptation&quot; in Australia. Because the original novel was still protected by United States copyright laws, this version was never published in the U.S. The second version, &quot;The Great Gatsby: The Graphic Novel&quot;, was adapted by Fred Fordham and illustrated by Aya Morton in 2020. In 2021, K. Woodman-Maynard adapted and illustrated &quot;The Great Gatsby: A Graphic Novel Adaptation&quot;, which was published by Candlewick Press. This was the first graphic novel adaptation of the original novel to be published after it entered the public domain in 2021. In June 2021, Clover Press debuted the first of seven periodical comic books, faithfully adapting &quot;The Great Gatsby&quot;.

In 2024, IDW Publishing announced &quot;Godzilla&#x27;s Monsterpiece Theater&quot;, a three-part miniseries where Gatsby will team up with Sherlock Holmes, Dracula and the Time Traveller from H.G. Wells&#x27; &quot;The Time Machine&quot; to battle the King of the Monsters, with Gatsby funding a version of the anti-kaiju defense team G-Force.

=== Radio ===
The novel has been adapted into a series of radio episodes. The first radio episode was a 1950 half-hour-long adaptation for CBS&#x27; &quot;Family Hour of Stars&quot; starring Kirk Douglas as Gatsby. The novel was read aloud by the BBC World Service in ten parts in 2008. In a 2012 BBC Radio 4 broadcast, &quot;The Great Gatsby&quot; took the form of a Classic Serial dramatization. It was created by dramatist Robert Forrest.

=== Video games ===
In 2010, Oberon Media released a casual hidden object game called &quot;Classic Adventures: The Great Gatsby&quot;. In 2011, developer Charlie Hoey and editor Pete Smith created an 8-bit-style online game of &quot;The Great Gatsby&quot; called &quot;The Great Gatsby for NES&quot;; in 2022, after the Adobe Flash end of life they adapted this game to an actual NES ROM file, which can also be played on their website. In 2013, &quot;Slate&quot; released a short symbolic adaptation called &quot;The Great Gatsby: The Video Game&quot;.

<text>The Public Enemy (Enemies of the Public in the UK) is a 1931 American pre-Code gangster film produced and distributed by Warner Bros. The film was directed by William A. Wellman, and starring James Cagney, Jean Harlow, Edward Woods, Donald Cook and Joan Blondell. The film relates the story of a young man&#x27;s rise in the criminal underworld in Prohibition-era urban America. The supporting players include Beryl Mercer, Murray Kinnell, and Mae Clarke. The screenplay is based on an unpublished novel—&quot;Beer and Blood&quot; by two former newspapermen, John Bright and Kubec Glasmon—who had witnessed some of Al Capone&#x27;s murderous gang rivalries in Chicago.

In 1998, &quot;The Public Enemy&quot; was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant&quot;.

==Plot==

As youngsters in 1900s Chicago, Irish-Americans Tom Powers and his lifelong friend Matt Doyle engage in petty theft, selling stolen items to &quot;Putty Nose&quot;. Putty Nose persuades them to join his gang on a fur warehouse robbery, assuring them he will take care of them if anything goes wrong. When Tom is startled by a stuffed bear, he shoots it, alerting the police, who kill gang member Larry Dalton. When they go to Putty Nose for help, they find he has fled.

Tom&#x27;s straitlaced older brother Mike Powers tries and fails to talk Tom into giving up crime. Tom keeps his activities secret from his doting mother. When the United States enters World War I in 1917, Mike enlists in the Marines.

In 1920, with Prohibition about to go into effect, Paddy Ryan recruits Tom and Matt as beer &quot;salesmen&quot; (enforcers) in his bootlegging business. He allies himself with noted gangster Samuel &quot;Nails&quot; Nathan. As the bootlegging business becomes ever more lucrative, Tom and Matt flaunt their wealth.

Mike finds out that his brother&#x27;s money comes not from politics, as Tom claims, but from bootlegging, and declares that Tom&#x27;s success is based on nothing more than &quot;beer and blood&quot;. Tom retorts in disgust: &quot;Your hands ain&#x27;t so clean. You killed and liked it. You didn&#x27;t get them medals for holding hands with them Germans.&quot;

Tom and Matt acquire girlfriends, Kitty and Mamie, respectively. Tom eventually tires of Kitty; when she complains once too often, he angrily pushes half a grapefruit into her face. He then drops her for Gwen Allen. At a restaurant on the night of Matt&#x27;s wedding reception to Mamie, Tom and Matt recognize Putty Nose and follow him home. Begging for his life, Putty plays a song on the piano that he had entertained Tom and Matt with when they were children. Tom shoots him in the back, while a dazed Matt watches.

Tom gives his mother a large wad of money, but Mike rejects the gift. Tom tears up the banknotes and throws them in his brother&#x27;s face. &quot;Nails&quot; Nathan dies in a horse-riding accident, prompting Tom to buy the horse and shoot it. A rival gang headed by &quot;Schemer&quot; Burns takes advantage of the disarray resulting from Nathan&#x27;s death, precipitating a gang war.

Later, Matt is gunned down in public, with Tom narrowly escaping the same fate. Furious, Tom takes it upon himself to single-handedly settle scores with Burns and some of his men. Tom is seriously wounded in the shootout and ends up in the hospital. When his mother, brother, and Matt&#x27;s sister Molly come to see him, he reconciles with Mike and agrees to reform. However, Paddy warns Mike that Tom has been kidnapped by the Burns mob from the hospital. A member of the Paddy gang telephones Mike to say Tom is returning from the hospital; their mother is overjoyed and begins preparing Tom&#x27;s bedroom. When Mike answers a knock on the door, Tom&#x27;s tied-up body is propped against it, and he falls dead onto the floor. The film closes with Mike walking slowly towards the camera.

==Production==
===Development===
The screenplay, which was written by Harvey F. Thew, was based on an unpublished novel, &quot;Beer and Blood&quot;, by John Bright and Kubec Glasmon. Bright and Glasmon based their novel on actual people, having witnessed some of Al Capone&#x27;s murderous gang rivalries in Chicago. Warner Bros. studio head Jack L. Warner bought the rights to the novel and assigned director William A. Wellman to direct the film. Wellman, who had served in World War I, like the brother of the main character, told Warner: &quot;I&#x27;ll bring you the toughest, most violent picture you ever did see&quot;.

===Casting===
Edward Woods was originally cast in the lead role of Tom Powers and James Cagney was cast as Tom&#x27;s best friend Matt Doyle, until director Wellman decided Cagney would be more effective in the part and switched the two actors but never reshot the sequences with the characters as children, which is why the child playing Cagney&#x27;s role looks like Woods while the one playing Woods&#x27; role looks like Cagney. Another reason for the switch is that the sound technology used in &quot;The Public Enemy&quot; was superior to that used in earlier films, making it no longer imperative to have an actor in the lead role who had impeccable enunciation.

Louise Brooks was the original choice for Gwen Allen, a woman with self-confessed weakness for bad men. She refused the role, which went to a younger actress, Jean Harlow. Brooks&#x27; name was in studio records/casting call lists playing &quot;Bess&quot; in this movie, but she and her character did not appear. Brooks later explained herself to Wellman (who had directed her in &quot;Beggars of Life&quot; (1928)) by saying that she hated making pictures because she simply &quot;hated Hollywood&quot;. In the opinion of Brooks&#x27;s biographer Barry Paris, &quot;turning down &quot;Public Enemy&quot; marked the real end of Louise Brooks&#x27;s film career&quot;.

Tom&#x27;s first girlfriend Kitty was played by Mae Clarke, who was uncredited. Kitty is eventually dumped by Tom for Gwen after he pushes half a grapefruit into her face, the most famous scene in the movie. Joan Blondell played Mamie, Matt&#x27;s girlfriend. She had already worked with Cagney in &quot;Sinners&#x27; Holiday&quot; (1930) and would work with him on two films which also came out this year: &quot;Other Men&#x27;s Women&quot; and &quot;Blonde Crazy&quot;. Other films that they worked together on were &quot;The Crowd Roars&quot; (1932), &quot;Footlight Parade&quot; (1933) and &quot;He Was Her Man&quot; (1934). Cagney once said that Blondell was the only woman he loved besides his wife. Donald Cook played Tom&#x27;s brother, Mike.

===Filming===
Filming took place in January and February 1931, with a small budget of $151,000. During filming, Cagney also made &quot;Smart Money&quot;, co-starring Edward G. Robinson, who had finished his breakthrough film &quot;Little Caesar&quot;.

In the scene where Mike Powers punches his brother Tom, Wellman privately took Donald Cook aside and, explaining his desire for authenticity in Tom&#x27;s reaction, asked the actor to really hit Cagney. Cook played his part a bit too well, and he struck Cagney in the mouth with such force, he actually broke one of Cagney&#x27;s teeth. Yet in spite of his genuine shock and pain, Cagney stayed in character and played out the rest of the scene. In another incident, live ammunition was used in a scene where Tom Powers ducks around the corner of a building to take cover from machine gun fire; the use of live ammunition was common practice at the time. The bullets struck the wall of the building at the position where Cagney&#x27;s head had been just a moment before.

===Grapefruit scene===

In a 1973 interview featured in the Turner Classic Movies documentary &quot;The Men Who Made The Movies: William Wellman&quot;, Wellman said he added the grapefruit &quot;hitting&quot; to the scene, because when he and his wife at the time would get into fights, she would never talk or give any expression. Since she always had a grapefruit for breakfast, he always wanted to put the grapefruit into her face just to get a reaction out of her, so she would show some emotion; he felt that this scene gave him the opportunity to rid himself of that temptation.

Some, such as film critic Ben Mankiewicz, have asserted that Mae Clarke&#x27;s surprised and seemingly somewhat angry reaction to the grapefruit was genuine, as she had not been told to expect the unscripted action. However, in her autobiography, Clarke stated that Cagney had told her prior to that take what he planned to do. She said that her only genuine surprise came later, when she saw the grapefruit scene appear in the final film, as it had been her understanding that they were shooting it only as a joke to amuse the crew.

According to Cagney, Clarke&#x27;s ex-husband had the grapefruit scene timed, and would buy a ticket just before that scene went onscreen, go enjoy the scene, leave, then come back during the next show just in time to see only that scene again. The scene was parodied years later in the 1961 Cagney movie &quot;One, Two, Three&quot; when Cagney threatens Otto (Horst Buchholz) with a half grapefruit but then decides against doing so.

===Prologue and epilogue===
The film featured a prologue &quot;apprising the audience that the hoodlums and terrorists of the underworld must be exposed and the glamour ripped from them&quot; and an epilogue &quot;pointing the moral that civilization is on her knees and inquiring loudly as to what is to be done.&quot; At the film&#x27;s premiere in New York City, the film&#x27;s prologue was preceded by a &quot;brief stage tableau, with sinuous green lighting, which shows a puppet gangster shooting another puppet gangster in the back.&quot;

==Music==
The soundtrack included the following songs:
* &quot;I&#x27;m Forever Blowing Bubbles&quot;
* &quot;Hesitation Blues&quot;
* &quot;Toot, Toot, Tootsie (Goo&#x27; Bye!)&quot;
* &quot;Maple Leaf Rag&quot;
* &quot;Brighten the Corner Where You Are&quot;
* &quot;Smiles&quot;
* &quot;I Surrender Dear&quot;
The music was performed by the Vitaphone Orchestra, led by conductor David Mendoza.

==Reception==
===Box office===
According to Warner Bros records the film earned $464,000 domestically and $93,000 internationally.

===Critical response===
Andre Sennwald, who reviewed the film for &quot;The New York Times&quot; on its April 1931 release, called it &quot;just another gangster film at the Strand, weaker than most in its story, stronger than most in its acting, and, like most, maintaining a certain level of interest through the last burst of machine-gun fire&quot;; Woods and Cagney give &quot;remarkably lifelike portraits of young hoodlums&quot; and &quot;Beryl Mercer as Tom&#x27;s mother, Robert Emmett O&#x27;Connor as a gang chief, and Donald Cook as Tom&#x27;s brother, do splendidly.&quot;

&quot;Time&quot; magazine called &quot;The Public Enemy&quot; &quot;well-told&quot; and noted, &quot;Unlike &quot;City Streets&quot;, this is not a Hugoesque fable of gangsters fighting among themselves, but a documentary drama of the bandit standing against society. It carries to its ultimate absurdity the fashion for romanticizing gangsters, for even in defeat the public enemy is endowed with grandeur.&quot; &quot;Variety&quot; called it &quot;low-brow material given such workmanship as to make it high-brow&quot; which attempts to &quot;square everything [with] a foreword and postscript moralizing on the gangster as a menace to the public welfare.&quot;

A theatre in Times Square ran &quot;The Public Enemy&quot; 24 hours a day during its initial release. At the 4th Academy Awards, the film was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Story, losing to &quot;The Dawn Patrol&quot;.

==Subsequent recognition==
In 1989, an animatronics version of a scene from &quot;The Public Enemy&quot; was incorporated into The Great Movie Ride at the Disney-MGM Studios theme park in Orlando, Florida.

In 1998, &quot;The Public Enemy&quot; was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant&quot;.

In 2001, the &quot;Sopranos&quot; episode &quot;Proshai, Livushka&quot; featured title character Tony Soprano watching scenes from the film, becoming overwhelmed with emotion.

In 2003 the character of Tom Powers was among the AFI&#x27;s 100 Years...100 Heroes and Villains, placing 42nd in the villain list. In 2008, the film appeared on one of the AFI&#x27;s 10 Top 10 lists—the best ten films in ten &quot;classic&quot; American film genres. &quot;The Public Enemy&quot; was listed as the eighth best in the gangster film genre.

==Re-releases==
The film was re-released in 1941 after the Production Code was put into effect. Three scenes from the film were cut because of the Code. One is of a markedly effeminate tailor measuring Tom for a suit, another where Mamie serves Matt breakfast in bed, and the third showing Tom being taken advantage of by Paddy Ryan&#x27;s girlfriend while hiding out in her apartment. These three scenes were later restored for all DVD and Blu-ray releases, and on Turner Classic Movies.

The film was also re-released in 1954, with a written prologue added before the opening credits, advising that gangsters such as Tom Powers and Caesar &quot;Rico&quot; Bandello, the title character in &quot;Little Caesar&quot; (played by Edward G. Robinson), are a menace that the public must confront.

==Preservation status==
As with many a Warner/First National pre-code talkie, a print has been in the Library of Congress since the 1970s. The film has been available to the public for several decades, due to several video and DVD releases.
===Legacy===
In the 90&#x27;s and early 2000&#x27;s wrestlers Rocco Rock and Johnny Grunge would used the title of the movie when they formed the tag team in places like WWE, WCW, and ECW and they would both be in the Hardcore Wrestling Hall of Fame.

<text>Pull My Daisy is a 1959 American short film directed by Robert Frank and Alfred Leslie, and adapted by Jack Kerouac from the third act of his play, &quot;Beat Generation&quot;.

Kerouac also provided improvised narration. It features poets Allen Ginsberg, Peter Orlovsky and Gregory Corso, artists Larry Rivers and Alice Neel, musician David Amram, art dealer Richard Bellamy, Delphine Seyrig, dancer Sally Gross, and Pablo Frank, Robert Frank&#x27;s son.

==Plot==
==Cast==
== Production ==
Based on an incident in the life of Beat icon Neal Cassady and his wife, the painter Carolyn, the film tells the story of a railway brakeman whose wife invites a respected bishop over for dinner. However, the brakeman&#x27;s bohemian friends crash the party, with comic results.

Originally intended to be called &quot;The Beat Generation&quot;, the title &quot;Pull My Daisy&quot; was taken from the poem of the same name written by Kerouac, Ginsberg, and Cassady in the late 1940s. Part of the original poem was used as a lyric in Amram&#x27;s jazz composition that opens the film.

The Beat philosophy emphasized spontaneity, and the film conveyed the quality of having been thrown together or even improvised. &quot;Pull My Daisy&quot; was accordingly praised for years as an improvisational masterpiece. It was filmed in Alfred Leslie&#x27;s loft at Fourth Ave. &amp; 12th St. in Manhattan.

Leslie and Frank discuss the film at length in Jack Sargeant&#x27;s book &quot;Naked Lens: Beat Cinema&quot;. An illustrated transcript of the film&#x27;s narration was also published in 1961 by Grove Press.

==Reception==
&quot;Pull My Daisy&quot; was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress in 1996, as being &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant&quot;.

<doc id="76037" wikidata="Q182021" url="?curid=76037" title="Marie de' Medici">
<text>Marie de&#x27; Medici (; ; 26 April 1575 – 3 July 1642) was Queen of France and Navarre as the second wife of King Henry IV. Marie served as regent of France between 1610 and 1617 during the minority of her son Louis XIII. Her mandate as regent legally expired in 1614, when her son reached the age of majority, but she refused to resign and continued as regent until she was removed by a coup in 1617.

Marie was a member of the powerful House of Medici in the branch of the grand dukes of Tuscany. Her family&#x27;s wealth inspired Henry IV to choose Marie as his second wife after his divorce from his previous wife, Margaret of Valois. The assassination of her husband in 1610, which occurred the day after her coronation, caused her to act as regent for her son, Louis XIII, until 1614, when he officially attained his legal majority, but as the head of the &quot;Conseil du Roi&quot;, she retained the power.

Noted for her ceaseless political intrigues at the French court, her extensive artistic patronage and her favourites (the most famous being Concino Concini and Leonora Dori), she ended up being banished from the country by her son and dying in the city of Cologne, in the Holy Roman Empire.

==Life==
===Early years===
Born at the Palazzo Pitti of Florence, Italy on 26 April 1575, Maria was the sixth daughter of Francesco I de&#x27; Medici, Grand Duke of Tuscany, and Archduchess Joanna of Austria. She was a descendant of Lorenzo the Elder –a branch of the Medici family sometimes referred to as the &#x27;cadet&#x27; branch– and was also a Habsburg through her mother, who was a direct descendant of Joanna of Castile and Philip I of Castile.

Of her five elder sisters, only the eldest, Eleonora (born 28 February 1567) and the third, Anna (born 31 December 1569) survived infancy. Their only brother Philip de&#x27; Medici, was born on 20 May 1577. One year later (10 April 1578) Grand Duchess Joanna –heavily pregnant with her eighth child– fell from the stairs in the Grand Ducal Palace in Florence, dying the next day after giving birth to a premature stillborn son. A few months later, Grand Duke Francesco I married his longtime mistress Bianca Cappello; the marriage was officially revealed one year later, on 12 June 1579. In a few years, Maria also lost two of her siblings, Philip (died 29 March 1582 aged 4) and Anna (died 19 February 1584 aged 14).

Maria and her only surviving sister, Eleonora (with whom she had a close relationship) spent their childhood at the Palazzo Pitti in Florence, placed under the care of a governess along with their paternal first-cousin Virginio Orsini (son of Isabella de&#x27; Medici, Duchess of Bracciano).

After her sister&#x27;s marriage in 1584 with Vincenzo Gonzaga, heir of the Duchy of Mantua, and her departure to her husband&#x27;s homeland, Maria&#x27;s only playmate was her first cousin Virginio Orsini, to whom she deferred all her affection. In addition, her stepmother brought a female companion to the Palazzo Pitti for Maria, a young girl named Dianora Dori, who would be renamed Leonora. This young girl, a few years older than Maria, soon gained great influence over the princess, to the point that Maria would not make decisions without talking to Leonora first.

On the 19th and 20 October, in 1587, at the Villa Medici in Poggio a Caiano, Grand Duke Francesco I and Bianca Cappello died. They may have been poisoned, but some historians believe they were killed by malarial fever. Now orphaned, Maria was considered the richest heiress in Europe.

Maria&#x27;s uncle Ferdinando I de&#x27; Medici became the new Grand Duke of Tuscany and married Christina of Lorraine (granddaughter of the famous Catherine de&#x27; Medici, Queen of France) in 1589. Notwithstanding his desire to give an heir to his dynasty, the new Grand Duke gave his orphaned nephew and niece a good education. Maria was interested in science; she enjoyed learning about mathematics, philosophy, astronomy, as well as the arts. She was also passionate about jewelry and precious stones. Very devout, she was known to keep an open mind, and to depend on those around her for support.

Close to the artists of her native Florence, Maria was trained in drawing by Jacopo Ligozzi, and she was reportedly very talented; she also played music (singing and practicing the guitar and the lute) and enjoyed theater, dance, and comedy.

The wealth of the Medici family attracted many suitors, in particular the younger brother of her aunt Grand Duchess Christina, François, Count of Vaudémont and heir of the Duchy of Lorraine. But soon, a more prestigious suitor presented himself: King Henry IV of France.

===Queen of France===

The marriage of Henry IV with Maria de&#x27; Medici represented above all, for France, a solution to dynastic and financial concerns: it was said that the French king &quot;owed the bride&#x27;s father, Francesco de&#x27; Medici, Grand Duke of Tuscany, who had helped support his war effort, a whopping 1,174,000 écus and this was the only means Henry could find to pay back the debt...&quot; In addition, the Medici familybanking creditors of the Kings of Francepromised a dowry of 600,000 &quot;écus d&#x27;or&quot; (2 million livres including 1 million paid in cash to cancel the debt contracted by France with the Medici bank), which earned the future Queen the nickname &quot;the big banker&quot; (&quot;la grosse banquière&quot;) from her jealous rival, Catherine Henriette de Balzac d&#x27;Entragues, Henry IV&#x27;s current &quot;maîtresse-en-titre&quot;. Moreover, Maria de&#x27; Medici was the granddaughter of Ferdinand I, Holy Roman Emperor (in office: 1556–1564), thereby ensuring and reinforcing a legitimate royal descent for prospective future members of the House of Bourbon (the Catholic League and Habsburg Spain had questioned Bourbon legitimacy during the previous French Succession War of 1589 - 1593).

After having obtained the annulment of his union to Margaret of Valois in December 1599, Henry IV officially started negotiations for his new marriage with Maria de&#x27; Medici. The marriage contract was signed in Paris in March 1600 and official ceremonies took place in Tuscany and France from October to December of the same year: the marriage by proxy took place at the Cathedral of Santa Maria del Fiore (now Florence Cathedral) on 5 October 1600 with Henry IV&#x27;s favorite the Duc de Bellegarde representing the French sovereign. The celebrations were attended by 4,000 guests with lavish entertainment, including examples of the newly invented musical genre of opera, such as Jacopo Peri&#x27;s &quot;Euridice&quot;.Maria (now known by the French usage of her name, &quot;Marie de Médicis&quot;) left Florence for Livorno on 23 October, accompanied by 2,000 people who made up her suite, and set off for Marseille, which she reached on 3 November. Antoinette de Pons, Marquise de Guercheville and &quot;Première dame d&#x27;honneur&quot; of the new Queen, was responsible for welcoming her to Marseille. After her disembarkation, Marie continued her trip, arriving at Lyon on 3 December. She and Henry IV finally met on 9 December and spent their wedding night together. On 17 December, the Papal legate finally arrived, and gave his blessing to the religious wedding ceremony at the Cathedral of Saint-Jean-Baptiste de Lyon.

Marie gave birth to her first child, a son, on 27 September 1601 at the Palace of Fontainebleau. The boy, named Louis, and automatically upon birth heir to the throne and Dauphin of France, was born to the great satisfaction of the King and France, which had been waiting for the birth of a Dauphin for more than forty years. Marie gave birth to five more children (three daughters and two more sons) between 1602 and 1609; however, during 1603–1606 she was effectively separated from her husband.

Although the marriage succeeded in producing children, it was not a happy one. Marie was of a very jealous temperament, and she refused to accept her husband&#x27;s numerous infidelities; indeed, he forced his wife to rub shoulders with his mistresses. She mostly quarreled with the &quot;maîtresse-en-titre&quot; Catherine de Balzac d&#x27;Entragues (whom Henry IV had allegedly promised he would marry following the death in 1599 of his former &quot;maîtresse-en-titre&quot;, Gabrielle d&#x27;Estrées) in a language that shocked French courtiers; also, it was said in court that Henry IV took Marie only for breeding purposes exactly as Henry II had treated Catherine de&#x27; Medici. Although the King could have easily banished his mistress, supporting his wife, he never did so. Marie, in turn, showed great sympathy and support to her husband&#x27;s banished ex-wife Marguerite de Valois, prompting Henry IV to allow her back to Paris.

Another bone of contention concerned the proper maintenance of Marie&#x27;s household as Queen of France: despite the enormous dowry she brought to the marriage, her husband often refused her the money necessary to pay all the expenses that she intended to carry out to show everyone her royal rank. Household scenes took place, followed by periods of relative peace. Marie was also very keen to be officially crowned Queen of France, but Henry IV postponed the ceremony for political reasons.

Marie had to wait until 13 May 1610 to be finally crowned Queen of France. At this time Henry IV was about to depart to fight in the War of Succession over the United Duchies of Jülich-Cleves-Berg; the coronation aimed to confer greater legitimacy on the Queen from the perspective of a possible regency which she would be called upon to provide in the absence of the King. The very next day (14 May), Henry IV was assassinated by François Ravaillac - which immediately raised suspicions of a conspiracy.

===Regency===

Within hours after Henry IV&#x27;s assassination, Marie was confirmed as Regent by the Parliament of Paris on behalf of her son and new King, eight-year-old Louis XIII. She immediately banished her late husband&#x27;s mistress, Catherine de Balzac d&#x27;Entragues, from the court. At first, she kept the closest advisers of Henry IV in the key court positions and took for herself (1611) the title of Governess of the Bastille, although she entrusted the physical custody of this important Parisian fortress to Joachim de Chateauvieux, her knight of honor, who took direct command as a lieutenant of the Queen-Regent.

From the beginning, Marie was under suspicion at court because she was perceived as a foreigner and never truly mastered French; moreover, she was heavily influenced by her Italian friends and confidants, including her foster sister Leonora &quot;Galigai&quot; Dori and Concino Concini, who was created Marquis d&#x27;Ancre and a Marshal of France, even though he had never fought a single battle. The Concinis had Henry IV&#x27;s able minister, the Duke of Sully, dismissed, and Italian representatives of the Roman Catholic Church hoped to force the suppression of Protestantism in France by means of their influence. However, Marie maintained her late husband&#x27;s policy of religious tolerance. As one of her first acts, Marie reconfirmed Henri IV&#x27;s Edict of Nantes, which ordered religious tolerance for Protestants in France while asserting the supremacy of the Roman Catholic Church.

To further consolidate her authority as Regent of the Kingdom of France, Marie decided to impose the strict protocol from the court of Spain. An avid ballet performer and art collector, she deployed artistic patronage that helped develop the arts in France. Daughter of a Habsburg archduchess, the Queen-Regent abandoned the traditional anti-Habsburg French foreign policy (one of her first acts was the overturn of the Treaty of Bruzolo, an alliance signed between Henry IV&#x27;s representatives and Charles Emmanuel I, Duke of Savoy), and formed an alliance with Habsburg Spain which culminated in 1615 with the double marriage of her daughter Elisabeth and her son Louis XIII with the two children of King Philip III of Spain, Philip, Prince of Asturias (future Philip IV) and Anne of Austria, respectively.

Nevertheless, the Queen-Regent&#x27;s policy caused discontent. On the one hand, Protestants were worried about the rapprochement of Marie with Spain; on the other hand, Marie&#x27;s attempts to strengthen her power by relying on the Concinis deeply displeased part of the French nobility. Stirring up xenophobic passion, the nobility designated the Italian immigrants favored by Marie as responsible for all the wrongs of the kingdom. They are getting richer, they said, at our expense. Taking advantage of the clear weakness of the Regency, the &quot;princes of the blood&quot; under the leadership of Henri II, Prince of Condé, rebelled against Marie.

In application of the Treaty of Sainte-Menehould (15 May 1614), the Queen-Regent convened the Estates General in Paris. The Prince of Condé failed to structure his opposition to royal power. However, Marie undertook to cement the alliance with Spain and to ensure respect for the theses of the Council of Trent. The reforms of the &quot;paulette&quot; and the &quot;taille&quot; remained a dead letter. The clergy played the role of arbiter between the Third Estate and the nobility who did not manage to get along: Civil lieutenant Henri de Mesmes declared that &quot;all the Estates were brothers and children of a common mother, France&quot;, while one of the representatives of the nobility replied that he refused to be the brother of a child of a shoemaker or cobbler. This antagonism benefited the court, which soon pronounced the closure of the Estates General. The Regency was officially ended following the &quot;Lit de justice&quot; of 2 October 1614, which declared that Louis XIII had attained his legal majority of age, but Marie then became head of the &quot;Conseil du Roi&quot; and retained all her control over the government.

One year after the end of the Estates General, a new rebellion of the Prince of Condé allowed his entry into the &quot;Conseil du Roi&quot; by the Treaty of Loudun (3 May 1616), which also granted him the sum of 1,500,000 livres and the government of Guyenne. During this time, the Protestants obtained a reprieve of six years to the return of their places of safety to the royal power.

In 1616, the requirements of the Prince of Condé became so important that Marie had him arrested on 1 September and imprisoned him in the Bastille. The Duke of Nevers then took the leadership of the nobility in revolt against the Queen. Nevertheless, Marie&#x27;s rule was strengthened by the appointment of Armand Jean du Plessis (later Cardinal Richelieu)—who had come to prominence at the meetings of the Estates General—as Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs on 5 November 1616.

Despite being legally an adult for more than two years, Louis XIII had little power in the government; finally, he asserted his authority the next year. Feeling humiliated by the conduct of his mother, who monopolized power, the King organized (with the help of his favorite the Duc de Luynes) a coup d&#x27;état (also named &quot;Coup de majesté&quot;) on 24 April 1617: Concino Concini was assassinated by the Marquis de Vitry, and Marie exiled to the Château de Blois.

===Revolt of 1619 and return from exile===
In the night of 21–22 February 1619, the 43-year-old Queen Mother escaped from her prison in Blois with a rope ladder and by scaling a wall of 40 m. Gentlemen took her across the Pont de Blois and riders sent by the Duc d&#x27;Épernon escorted Marie in his coach. She took refuge in the Château d&#x27;Angoulême and provoked an uprising against her son the King, the so-called &quot;war of mother and son&quot; (&quot;guerre de la mère et du fils&quot;).

A first treaty, the Treaty of Angoulême, negotiated by Richelieu, calmed the conflict. However, the Queen Mother was not satisfied and relaunched the war by rallying the great nobles of the Kingdom to her cause (&quot;second war of mother and son&quot;). The noble coalition was quickly defeated at the Battle of Ponts-de-Cé (7 August 1620) by Louis XIII, who forgave his mother and the princes.

Aware that he could not avoid the formation of plots as long as his mother remained in exile, the King accepted her return to court. She then returned to Paris, where she worked on the construction of her Luxembourg Palace. After the death of the Duc de Luynes in December 1621, she gradually made her political comeback. Richelieu played an important role in her reconciliation with the king and even managed to bring the queen mother back to the &quot;Conseil du Roi&quot;.

===Artistic patronage===


From the time of her marriage to Henri IV, the Queen practiced ambitious artistic patronage, and placed under her protection several painters, sculptors and scholars. For her apartments at the Palace of Fontainebleau, the Flemish-born painter Ambroise Dubois was recruited to decorate Marie&#x27;s &quot;cabinets&quot; with a series of paintings on the theme of the &quot;Ethiopics&quot; of Heliodorus, and painted for her gallery an important decoration on the theme of Diana and Apollo, mythological evocations of the royal couple. In the Louvre, the Queen had a luxurious apartment on the first floor fitted out, then moved in 1614 to a new apartment on the ground floor, which she had adorned with panels and paintings by Ambroise Dubois, Jacob Bunel, Guillaume Dumée, and Gabriel Honnet on the theme of &quot;Jerusalem Delivered&quot; of Torquato Tasso (whose translation by Antoine de Nervèze was Marie&#x27;s first reading in French). The Queen also patronized with portrait painters, such as Charles Martin and especially the Flemish Frans Pourbus the Younger.

During and after the regency, Marie de Médicis played a major role in the development of Parisian artistic life by focusing on the construction and furnishing of the Luxembourg Palace, which she referred to as her &quot;Palais Médicis&quot;. The site was purchased in 1612 and construction began in 1615, to designs of Salomon de Brosse. In particular, she tried to attract several large-scale artists to Paris: she brought in &quot;The Annunciation&quot; by Guido Reni, was offered a suite of &quot;Muses&quot; painted by Giovanni Baglione, invited the painter Orazio Gentileschi (who stayed in Paris during two years, during 1623–1625), and especially the Flemish painter Peter Paul Rubens, who was commissioned by her to create a 21-piece series glorifying her life and reign to be part of her art collection in the Luxembourg Palace. This series (composed between 1622 and 1625), along with three individual portraits made for Marie and her family, is now known as the &quot;Marie de&#x27; Medici cycle&quot; (currently displayed in the Louvre Museum); the cycle uses iconography throughout to depict Henry IV and Marie as Jupiter and Juno and the French state as a female warrior.

The Queen-Mother&#x27;s attempts to convince Pietro da Cortona and Guercino to travel to Paris ended in failure, but during the 1620s the Luxembourg Palace became one of the most active decorative projects in Europe: sculptors such as Guillaume Berthelot and Christophe Cochet, painters like Jean Monier or the young Philippe de Champaigne, and even Simon Vouet on his return to Paris, participated in the decoration of the apartments of the Queen-Mother.

A parchment Prayer Book belonging to Marie de&#x27; Medici has artwork that may date from the 15th century, but is also remarkable for its canivet cuttings. Pages are cut with intricate patterns that are made to look like lace of the period.

===Conflict with Richelieu, exile and death===
Marie continued to attend the &quot;Conseil du roi&quot; by following the advice of Cardinal Richelieu, who she introduced to the King as minister. Over the years, she did not notice the rising power of her protégé; when she realized it, she broke with the Cardinal and sought to oust him. Still not understanding the personality of her son and still believing that it would be easy for her to demand the disgrace of Richelieu from him, she tried to obtain the dismissal of the minister. After the &quot;Day of the Dupes&quot; (&quot;Journée des Dupes&quot;) of 10–11 November 1630, Richelieu remained the principal minister, and the Queen Mother was constrained to be reconciled with him.


Marie ultimately decided to withdraw from court. Louis XIII, judging his mother too involved in intrigue, encouraged her to retire to the Château de Compiègne. From there, she fled on 19 July 1631 towards the city of Étrœungt (in the County of Hainaut), where she slept before going to Brussels. She intended to plead her case there, but the escape was only a political trap set by her son, who had withdrawn the regiments guarding the Château de Compiègne. Now a refugee with the Spanish, enemies of France, Marie was thus deprived of her pensions.

Her chaplain Mathieu de Morgues, who remained faithful to Marie in his exile, wrote pamphlets against Richelieu that circulated in France clandestinely. During her last years, Marie travelled to various European courts, in the Spanish Netherlands (the ruler of which, Isabella Clara Eugenia, and the ambassador Balthazar Gerbier tried to reconcile her with Richelieu), in England at the court of her daughter Queen Henrietta Maria for three years (staying en route to London in Gidea Hall) and then in Germany; with her daughters and sons-in-law where she tried again to form a &quot;league of sons-in-law&quot; against France, without ever being able to return, and her supporters were imprisoned, banished or condemned to death.

Her visit to Amsterdam was considered a diplomatic triumph by the Dutch, as it lent official recognition to the newly-formed Dutch Republic; accordingly, she was given an elaborate ceremonial royal entry, of the sort the Republic avoided for its own rulers. Spectacular displays (by Claes Corneliszoon Moeyaert) and water pageants took place in the city&#x27;s harbour in celebration of her visit. There was a procession led by two mounted trumpeters, and a large temporary structure was erected on an artificial island in the Amstel River especially for the festival. The structure was designed to display a series of dramatic tableaux in tribute to her once she set foot on the floating island and entered its pavilion. Afterwards she was offered an Indonesian rice table by the burgomaster, Albert Burgh. He also sold her a famous rosary, captured in Brazil. The visit prompted Caspar Barlaeus to write his &quot;Medicea hospes&quot; (&quot;The Medicean Guest&quot;, 1638).

Marie subsequently traveled to Cologne, where she took refuge in a house loaned by her friend, the painter Rubens. She fell ill in June 1642 and died of a bout of pleurisy in destitution on 3 July 1642, five months before Richelieu. It was not until 8 March 1643 that her body was finally laid to rest in France, in the Basilica of St Denis, The burial was held without much ceremony, and her heart was sent to La Flèche, in accordance with the wish of Henry IV, who wanted their two hearts to be reunited. Her son Louis XIII died on 14 May, only two months after the funeral.

In 1793, during the French Revolution, Queen Marie was dug up by the French revolutionists who threw insults at the remains of the Queen whom they accused of having murdered her husband. Some among them tore out the remaining tufts of her hair still attached to the skull and passed them around. Some of her bones were found floating in muddy water and her remains were thrown into a mass grave along with other French deceased royals. In 1817, Louis XVIII ordered that those royals buried in the mass grave be reburied. Marie in 1817 was reburied in the crypt of Basilica of Saint Denis.

==Posthumous appraisal==
Honoré de Balzac, in his essay &quot;Sur Catherine de Médicis&quot;, encapsulated the Romantic generation&#x27;s negative view of Marie de&#x27; Medici. She was born and raised in Italy and the French never really accepted her; hence, the negative reviews. However, Henry IV of France was not a rich man and needed Marie&#x27;s money. The French were still not pleased with him choosing an Italian wife. 

Jules Michelet also contributed to the denigration of Marie de Médicis.

<text>Rebel Without a Cause is a 1955 American coming-of-age melodrama film, directed by Nicholas Ray. The film stars James Dean, Natalie Wood, Sal Mineo, Jim Backus, Ann Doran, Corey Allen and William Hopper. It is also the film debut of Dennis Hopper, albeit in a minor role. It was filmed in the then recently introduced CinemaScope format. Focusing on emotionally confused suburban, middle-class teenagers, the film offers both social commentary and an alternative to previous films depicting delinquents in urban slum environments.

The film was an attempt to portray the moral decay of American youth, critique parental styles, and explore the differences and conflicts between generations, namely the Interbellum Generation and the Silent Generation. The title was adopted from psychologist Robert M. Lindner&#x27;s 1944 book, &quot;Rebel Without a Cause: The Hypnoanalysis of a Criminal Psychopath&quot;, although the film itself does not make any other references to Lindner&#x27;s book. Warner Bros. released the film on October 27, 1955, nearly a month after Dean&#x27;s death in a car crash on September 30, 1955.

Over the years, the film has achieved landmark status for the performance of Dean, fresh from his Oscar-nominated role in &quot;East of Eden&quot;, in his most celebrated role. This was the only film of Dean&#x27;s in which he received top billing. In 1990, &quot;Rebel Without a Cause&quot; was added to the Library of Congress&#x27;s National Film Registry as being deemed &quot;culturally, historically, and aesthetically significant&quot;.

==Plot==
In Los Angeles during the mid-1950s, teenager Jim Stark is arrested and taken to the juvenile division of a police station for public intoxication. At the station he crosses paths with John &quot;Plato&quot; Crawford, who was brought in for killing a litter of puppies, and Judy, who was brought in for curfew violation. The three separately reveal their innermost frustrations to the officers; all three of them suffer from problems at home. Jim feels anguished by his constantly bickering parents, Frank and Carol, but even more so by his timid father&#x27;s failure to stand up to Carol; the issues are further complicated by Frank&#x27;s interfering mother. His frustrations are made manifest to officer Ray Fremick when Jim is released to their custody.

Judy is convinced that her father ignores her because she is no longer a little girl, so she dresses up in racy clothes to get attention, which only causes her father to call her a &quot;dirty tramp&quot;, while Plato&#x27;s father abandoned his family when he was a toddler, and his mother is often away from home, leaving Plato in the care of his housekeeper.

On the way to his first day at Dawson High, Jim again meets Judy and offers her a ride. Seemingly unimpressed by Jim, she declines and is instead picked up by her &quot;friends&quot;, a gang of delinquents led by Buzz Gunderson who Judy is also dating. Jim is shunned by the rest of the student body but is befriended by Plato, who comes to idolize Jim, and according to Pomerance and Krauss, &quot;Jim is an idealized father for Plato&quot;.

After a field trip to Griffith Observatory, Buzz provokes and challenges Jim to a knife fight; Jim bests Buzz by knocking his switchblade out of his hand, then throws his own blade away. To preserve his status as gang leader, Buzz suggests stealing some cars to have a &quot;Chickie Run&quot; at a seaside cliff. At home, Jim ambiguously asks his father about defending one&#x27;s honor in a dangerous situation, but Frank advises him against confrontation of any kind. That night, during the chickie run, Buzz plunges to his death when the strap on his jacket sleeve becomes entangled with his door-latch lever, preventing him from exiting the car. As police approach, the gang flees, leaving Judy behind, but Jim persuades her to leave with him and Plato.
Jim later confides to his parents his involvement in the crash and considers turning himself in. When Carol declares they are moving again, Jim pleads with Frank to stand up for him. When Frank refuses, Jim attacks him in frustration, then storms off to the police station to confess, only to be turned away by the desk sergeant. Jim drives back home, finding Judy waiting for him. She apologizes for her prior treatment of him due to peer pressure, and the two begin to fall in love. Agreeing to never return to their respective homes, Jim suggests they visit an old deserted mansion Plato told him about.

Meanwhile, Plato is intercepted by three members of Buzz&#x27;s gang, who are convinced that Jim betrayed them to the police. They steal Plato&#x27;s address book and pursue Jim; Plato retrieves his mother&#x27;s gun and leaves to warn Jim and Judy, finding them at the mansion. The three new friends act out a fantasy as a family. Plato then falls asleep, and Jim and Judy leave to explore the mansion, where they share their first kiss. Buzz&#x27;s gang find and wake up Plato, who, frightened and distraught, shoots and wounds one of the gang. When Jim returns, he attempts to restrain Plato, who flees, accusing Jim of abandoning him.

Plato runs to the observatory and barricades himself inside as more police converge including Fremick who, along with Frank and Carol, has been searching for Jim. Jim and Judy follow Plato into the observatory, where Jim persuades Plato to trade the gun for his red jacket; Jim quietly removes the ammunition before returning it, and then convinces Plato to come outside. When the police notice that Plato still has the gun, they shoot Plato dead as he charges them, unaware that Jim had removed the bullets. Frank comforts his grieving son, vowing to be a better father. Now reconciled with his parents, Jim introduces them to Judy.

==Cast==

==Production==
Warner Brothers had bought the rights to Lindner&#x27;s book, intending to use the title for a film. Attempts to create a film version in the late 1940s eventually ended without a film or even a full script being produced. When Marlon Brando did a five-minute screen test for the studio in 1947, he was given fragments of one of the partial scripts. However, Brando was not auditioning for &quot;Rebel Without a Cause&quot;, and there was no offer of any part made by the studio. The film, as it later appeared, was the result of a totally new script written in the 1950s that had nothing to do with the Brando test. The screen test is included on a 2006 special edition DVD of the 1951 film &quot;A Streetcar Named Desire&quot;.

According to a biography of Natalie Wood, she almost did not get the role of Judy because Nicholas Ray thought that she did not fit the role of the wild teen character. While on a night out with friends, she was in a car accident. Upon hearing this, Ray rushed to the hospital. While in delirium, Wood overheard the doctor murmuring and calling her a &quot;goddamn juvenile delinquent&quot;; she soon yelled to Ray, &quot;Did you hear what he called me, Nick?! He called me a goddamn juvenile delinquent! &quot;Now&quot; do I get the part?!&quot;

Dawson High School, the school in the film, was actually Santa Monica High School, located in Santa Monica, California.

Exterior scenes at the abandoned mansion to which the characters retreat were filmed at the William O. Jenkins House, previously used in the film &quot;Sunset Boulevard&quot; (1950). It was demolished just two years after filming.

Irving Shulman, who adapted Nicholas Ray&#x27;s initial film story into the screenplay, had considered changing the name of James Dean&#x27;s character to Herman Deville, according to Jurgen Muller&#x27;s &quot;Movies of the &#x27;50s&quot;. He originally had written a number of scenes that were shot and later cut from the final version of the film. According to an AFI interview with Stewart Stern, with whom Shulman worked on the screenplay, one of the scenes was thought to be too emotionally provocative to be included in the final print of the film. It portrayed the character of Jim Stark inebriated to the point of belligerence screaming at a car in the parking lot &quot;It&#x27;s a little jeep jeep! Little jeep, jeep!&quot; The scene was considered unproductive to the story&#x27;s progression by head editor William H. Ziegler and ultimately was cut. In 2006, members of the Film Society of Lincoln Center petitioned to have the scene printed and archived for historical preservation.

Sal Mineo would later note in a 1972 interview that the character of Plato Crawford was intended to have been gay. Speaking to Boze Hadleigh, he said, &quot;[It m]akes sense [that Plato was killed off]: he was, in a way, the first gay teenager in films. You watch it now, you &quot;know&quot; he had the hots for James Dean. You watch it now, and everyone knows about Jimmy[&#x27;s bisexuality], so it&#x27;s like he had the hots for Natalie [Wood] and me. Ergo, I had to be bumped off, out of the way.&quot;

The film was in production from March 28 to May 26, 1955. When production began, Warner Bros. considered it a B-movie project, and Ray used black-and-white film stock. When Jack L. Warner realized James Dean was a rising star and a hot property, filming was switched to color stock, and many scenes had to be reshot in color. It was shot in the widescreen CinemaScope format, which had been introduced two years previously. With its densely expressive images, the film has been called a &quot;landmark ... a quantum leap forward in the artistic and technical evolution of a format.&quot;

The 1949 Mercury two-door sedan James Dean drove in the movie is part of the permanent collection at the National Automobile Museum in Reno, Nevada.

==Reception==
&quot;Rebel Without a Cause&quot; holds a 93% fresh rating on Rotten Tomatoes based on 61 reviews, with an average rating of 8.30/10. The critical consensus reads, &quot;&quot;Rebel Without a Cause&quot; is a searing melodrama featuring keen insight into &#x27;50s juvenile attitude and James Dean&#x27;s cool, iconic performance.&quot; Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned the film a score of 89 out of 100, based on 19 critics, indicating &quot;universal acclaim&quot;.

Natalie Wood, Sal Mineo, and Nicholas Ray were nominated for Academy Awards for their roles in &quot;Rebel Without a Cause&quot;, which grossed $7,197,000 (equivalent to $ million in ) in domestic and overseas screenings, making it Warner Bros.&#x27; second-biggest box-office draw that year. The movie opened to mixed reviews when it was released on October 27, 1955, less than a month after James Dean, whose performance was praised all around by film critics, died on September 30. William Zinsser wrote a scathing review of &quot;Rebel&quot; in his &quot;New York Herald Tribune&quot; column, concluding his summary of the film&#x27;s plot with the words, &quot;All this takes two hours, but it seems more like two days. The movie is written and acted so ineptly, directed so sluggishly, that all names but one will be omitted here. The exception is Dean, the gifted young actor who was killed last month. His rare talent and appealing personality even shine through this turgid melodrama.&quot;

Bosley Crowther, writing in &quot;The New York Times&quot;, described &quot;Rebel Without a Cause&quot; as &quot;violent, brutal and disturbing&quot;, and as an excessively graphic depiction of teenagers and their &quot;weird ways&quot;. He referred to a &quot;horrifying duel with switchblades&quot;, a &quot;brutal scene&quot;, and a &quot;shocking presentation&quot; of a race in stolen automobiles. Although he admitted that there are moments of accuracy and truth in the film, he found these &quot;excruciating&quot;, and discerned a &quot;pictorial slickness&quot; in the production&#x27;s use of the CinemaScope process and its filming in the widescreen format, a slickness he declared was at odds with the realism of Ray&#x27;s directing. Crowther was not impressed by James Dean&#x27;s acting, and cited the various mannerisms he believed Dean copied from Marlon Brando, asserting that &quot;Never have we seen a performer so clearly follow another&#x27;s style&quot; and calling Dean&#x27;s interpretation of the Jim Stark role a &quot;clumsy display&quot;.

Reviewer Jack Moffitt of &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot;, who correctly thought the film would be a money maker, wrote a less critical, more laudatory review. He found the acting of James Dean, Natalie Wood, and Sal Mineo to be &quot;extraordinarily good&quot;, and the direction by Nicholas Ray to be &quot;outstanding&quot;. He praised the realistic manner in which Ray depicted the police station scenes and the engaging manner, according to Moffitt, in which he captured the nihilism of the teenage subculture for his audience. Moffitt took issue with the underlying ideology of the film, especially its implication, as he saw it, that professional bureaucrats could better guide youth than the American family unit itself. He criticized the film for overgeneralizing, calling this aspect a &quot;convenient cliche&quot;, and summed up his review by describing the film as &quot;a superficial treatment of a vital problem that has been staged brilliantly&quot;.

Robert J. Landry, managing editor of &quot;Variety&quot; magazine at the time, wrote a review published on October 26. He described &quot;Rebel&quot; as a &quot;fairly exciting, suspenseful and provocative, if also occasionally far-fetched, melodrama of unhappy youth on another delinquency kick.&quot; Unlike some movie critics, Landry thought that James Dean, under the influence of Nicholas Ray&#x27;s direction, had mostly freed his acting of the mannerisms characteristic of Marlon Brando&#x27;s style, and that his performance in the movie was &quot;very effective&quot;. He praised Dean&#x27;s interpretation of a maladjusted teenager, noting his ability &quot;to get inside the skin&quot; of his character as &quot;not often encountered&quot;.

Wanda Hale of the &quot;New York Daily News&quot; found fault with &quot;Rebel&quot;″s depiction, in her view, of its adults as cardboard figures and of its middle-class teenagers as hoodlums, arguing that it lacked credibility and that &quot;[a]s an honest purposeful drama of juvenile hardness and violence the film just doesn&#x27;t measure up.&quot; On the other hand, she praised James Dean&#x27;s acting, writing, &quot;[w]ith complete control of the character, he gives a fine, sensitive performance of an unhappy, lonely teenager, tormented by the knowledge of his emotional instability.&quot;

&quot;Rebel&quot; was censored in Britain by the British Board of Film Censors and released with scenes cut and an X-rating. Most of the knife fight was excised and not shown on British screens until 1967. The film was banned in New Zealand in 1955 by Chief Censor Gordon Mirams, out of fears that it would incite &quot;teenage delinquency&quot;, only to be released on appeal the following year with scenes cut and an R16 rating. &quot;Rebel&quot; was also banned in Spain, where it had to be smuggled into the country for private screenings, and was not officially released there until 1964.

== Costumes and props ==
The switchblade James Dean&#x27;s character used in the fight scene at Griffith Observatory was offered at auction on September 30, 2015, by Profiles in History with an estimated value of US$12,000 to $15,000; the winning bid was US$12,000. Also offered at the same auction were production photographs and a final shooting script dated August 17, 1955 for a behind-the-scenes television promotional film titled &quot;Behind the Cameras: Rebel Without a Cause&quot; hosted by Gig Young and that had scripted interviews and staged footage by the cast and crew (script winning bid US$225.)

==In popular culture==

===Music===
* The 1980 Bruce Springsteen song &quot;Cadillac Ranch&quot; contains the lyric, &quot;James Dean in that Mercury &#x27;49&quot; as one of the people meeting at the Cadillac Ranch.
* The music video for the 1991 Paula Abdul single, &quot;Rush, Rush&quot;, was inspired by the film. Several scenes were duplicated shot-for-shot for the video, which featured Abdul portraying Judy and Keanu Reeves portraying Jim.

===Film===
* Tommy Wiseau borrowed James Dean&#x27;s line &quot;You&#x27;re tearing me apart&quot; from &quot;Rebel Without a Cause&quot;, and used it in his 2003 cult film &quot;The Room&quot;, widely considered to be one of the worst films ever made. In the original script for Wiseau&#x27;s movie, it was written as &quot;You&#x27;re &quot;taking&quot; me apart, Lisa&quot;, a reference to Dean&#x27;s line.
* In the 2016 film &quot;La La Land&quot;, &quot;Rebel Without a Cause&quot; is referenced briefly. Ryan Gosling&#x27;s character Sebastian makes references to the film&#x27;s ending where James Dean yells, &quot;I got the bullets&quot; when Emma Stone&#x27;s character Mia discusses a callback for her audition. Later, the two of them are seen at the Rialto Theatre watching the opening of the film.

===Theater===
In 2005, an off-Broadway stage production opened at the American Theatre of Actors in New York, featuring Allie Mulholland and Aubrey Plaza in their stage debuts in the lead roles.
===Television===
* &quot;The Sopranos&quot; episode &quot;Big Girls Don&#x27;t Cry&quot; features Christopher Moltisanti performing the scene where Plato is killed during his &quot;Acting for Writers&quot; class.
* According to &quot;The O.C.&quot; executive producer Stephanie Savage, the film was a &quot;big reference&quot; for the second episode of the drama series (&quot;The Model Home&quot;), in which Seth and Marissa hide Ryan in a vacant mcmansion. Savage also noted that the dynamic of the three characters (Ryan, Marissa, and Seth) reminded her of the film&#x27;s three leads (Jim, Judy, and Plato).

<doc id="76046" wikidata="Q311524" url="?curid=76046" title="Spanish moss">
<text>Spanish moss (Tillandsia usneoides) is an epiphytic flowering plant that often grows upon large trees in tropical and subtropical climates. It is native to much of Mexico, Bermuda, the Bahamas, Central America, South America (as far south as northern Patagonia), the Southern United States, and West Indies. It has been naturalized in Queensland (Australia). It is known as &quot;grandpa&#x27;s beard&quot; in French Polynesia. It has the widest distribution of any bromeliad.

Most known in the United States, it commonly is found on the southern live oak (&quot;Quercus virginiana&quot;) and bald cypress (&quot;Taxodium distichum&quot;) in the lowlands, swamps, and marshes of the mid-Atlantic and Southeastern states, from the coast of southeastern Virginia to Florida and west to southern Arkansas and Texas. While it superficially resembles its namesake, the lichen &quot;Usnea&quot;, it is neither a lichen nor a moss (instead being a member of the bromeliad family, Bromeliaceae), and it is not native to Spain.

== Description ==

Spanish moss consists of one or more slender stems, bearing alternate thin, curved or curly, and heavily scaled leaves long and broad, that grow vegetatively in a chain-like fashion (pendant), forming hanging structures of up to . The gray-green garlands have occasionally been found hanging down as much as 26 feet (eight meters).

The plant has no roots. Its flowers are yellow-green and small, with spreading petals. The scape is partly hidden within the leaf sheath. Spanish moss propagates both by seed and vegetatively by fragments that are carried on the wind and stick to tree limbs or that are carried to other locations by birds as nesting material.

== Taxonomy ==

Spanish moss is in the family Bromeliaceae (the bromeliads). Formerly, it was placed in the genera &quot;Anoplophytum&quot;, &quot;Caraguata&quot;, and &quot;Renealmia&quot;. The specific name of the plant, &quot;usneoides&quot;, means &quot;resembling &quot;Usnea&quot;&quot;, a lichen.

== Habitat and distribution ==

Spanish moss&#x27; primary range is in the Southeastern United States (including Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands) to Argentina, where the climate is warm enough and a relatively high average humidity occurs. In North America, it occurs in a broad band following the Gulf of Mexico and the southern Atlantic coast. The northern limit of its natural range is Northampton County, Virginia, with colonial-era reports of it in southern Maryland, where no populations are now known to exist.

It has been introduced to locations around the world with similar conditions, including Hawaii, where it first established itself in the nineteenth century.

== Ecology ==

Spanish moss is not parasitic: it is an epiphyte that absorbs nutrients and water through its own leaves from the air and rain falling upon it. While its presence rarely kills the trees on which it grows, it occasionally becomes so thick that, by shading the leaves of the tree, it slows the growth rate of the tree. It can use the water-conserving strategy of crassulacean acid metabolism for photosynthesis.

In the southern U.S., the plant seems to show preferences for southern live oak (&quot;Quercus virginiana&quot;) and bald cypress (&quot;Taxodium distichum&quot;) because of their high rates of foliar mineral leaching (calcium, magnesium, potassium, and phosphorus) that provides an abundant supply of nutrients to the epiphytic plant. It can also colonize other tree species such as sweetgum (&quot;Liquidambar styraciflua&quot;), crepe-myrtles (&quot;Lagerstroemia&quot; spp.), other oaks, and even pines. It also grows more uncommonly on artificial structures such as fencing and telephone lines.

Spanish moss shelters a number of creatures, including rat snakes and three species of bats. One species of jumping spider, &quot;Pelegrina tillandsiae&quot;, has been found only on Spanish moss. Although widely presumed to infest Spanish moss, in one study of the ecology of the plant, chiggers were not present among thousands of other arthropods identified on the plant.

Spanish moss is sensitive to airborne contaminants. It does not grow in areas where smoke is common, such as near chimneys. It has receded from urban areas due to increasing air pollution.

== Culture and folklore ==

Spanish moss is often associated with Southern Gothic imagery and Deep South culture, due to its propensity for growing in subtropical humid southern locales such as Alabama, Southern Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi, North Carolina, South Carolina, east and south Texas, and extreme southern Virginia.

One anecdote about the origin of Spanish moss is called &quot;the Meanest Man Who Ever Lived&quot;, in which the man&#x27;s white hair grew very long and got caught on trees.

Spanish moss was introduced to Hawaii in the nineteenth century. It became a popular ornamental and lei plant. In Hawaii, it was named &quot;ʻumiʻumi-o-Dole&quot; after the beard of Sanford B. Dole, the first president of the Provisional Government of Hawaii. It is also known as hinahina, (&quot;silvery&quot;) borrowing the name of the native heliotrope used in lei until shoreline development made access difficult. It has become a substitute for the native hinahina in lei used for pageantry. In the early 21st century the plant was heavily marketed as &quot;Pele&#x27;s hair&quot;/&quot;lauoho-o-Pele&quot;, which actually refers to a type of filamentous volcanic glass.

== Human uses ==

Spanish moss has been used for various purposes, including building insulation, mulch, packing material, mattress stuffing, and fiber. In the early 1900s it was used commercially in the padding of car seats. More than 10,000 tons of processed Spanish moss was produced in 1939. Today, it is collected in smaller quantities for use in arts and crafts, as bedding for flower gardens, and as an ingredient in bousillage, a traditional wall covering material. In some parts of Latin America and Louisiana, it is used in nativity scenes.

In the desert regions of southwestern United States, dried Spanish moss is sometimes used in the manufacture of evaporative coolers, colloquially known as &quot;swamp coolers&quot; (and in some areas as &quot;desert coolers&quot;), which are used to cool homes and offices much less expensively than air conditioners. The cooling technology uses a pump that squirts water onto a pad made of Spanish moss plants; a fan then pulls air through the pad, and into the building. Evaporation of the water on the pads serves to reduce air temperature, cooling the building.

<text>Mary Anne Disraeli, 1st Viscountess Beaconsfield (; 11 November 1792 – 15 December 1872) was a British peeress and society figure who was the wife of the British statesman Benjamin Disraeli.

==Biography==
Born in Brampford Speke, near Exeter in Devon, the only daughter of Commander John Evans and Eleanor Viney (later Mrs Eleanor Yate). In 1815 at Clifton, Bristol, Mary married Wyndham Lewis, MP (1780–1838), a colleague of Benjamin Disraeli. In August 1839, the year following Lewis&#x27;s death, she married Disraeli at St George&#x27;s, Hanover Square, in London. Her fortune allowed him to purchase the estate of Hughenden in Buckinghamshire and to live in the style of an English gentleman.

In recognition of Disraeli&#x27;s services to the nation, Queen Victoria desired to ennoble him at the end of his first ministry. However, as he wished to remain in the House of Commons, his wife accepted the title in his place and was created Viscountess Beaconsfield, of Beaconsfield in the County of Buckingham, on 30 November 1868. (After Mary&#x27;s death, Disraeli accepted the title of Earl of Beaconsfield.)

Staid Victorians were often scandalised by Mary&#x27;s uninhibited conversation but soon learned not to insult her within Disraeli&#x27;s hearing. Even Queen Victoria herself was said to be amused when Mary Anne commented, in response to a remark about some lady&#x27;s pale complexion, &quot;I wish you could see my Dizzy in his bath!&quot; Once, at a house party where Lord Hardinge, a great soldier of the day, was in the room next to the Disraelis, Mary Anne announced at breakfast that she had slept the night before between the greatest soldier (Hardinge) and the greatest orator (Disraeli) of their times: Lady Hardinge was definitely not amused.
Disraeli had been unimpressed by Mary Lewis when he first met her, but he came to understand that she was shrewder than her outward manner had led him to believe. She was a great help to him in editing the books he wrote, and spent 30 years taking care of him. She once joked in public that although he had married her for her money he would do it again for love. In later life she became increasingly eccentric, both in conversation and appearance, but her husband&#x27;s devotion and loyalty to her never faltered. She was some twelve years older than her husband but their romance continued until the day she died.

In the spring of 1872, Mary became seriously ill, and by May it was clear that she was dying of stomach cancer. She rallied sufficiently to take a summer tour through the Home Counties with her husband. In November she felt well enough to hold a small dinner party for their close friends; but her condition deteriorated and she died on 15 December, at the age of eighty.

&quot;There was no care which she could not mitigate, and no difficulty which she could not face. She was the most cheerful and courageous woman I ever knew&quot; her husband wrote after her death. His great adversary William Gladstone, who had liked Mary, wrote him a letter of condolence. Disraeli, touched by this sympathy from a man who disliked him, replied that &quot;Marriage is the greatest earthly happiness when founded on mutual sympathy.&quot;

She is buried with Disraeli in a vault in the Church of St Michael and All Angels Church, Hughenden, in Hughenden, Buckinghamshire, close to the Disraeli family home, Hughenden Manor. The house is now in the care of the National Trust, and has been preserved in the state when it was occupied by the Disraelis. It is open to the public as a visitor attraction.

==Cultural depictions==
George Arliss became renowned for his portrayal of the man in the 1911 play, &quot;Disraeli&quot; (which Arliss commissioned), in its 1917 revival, and in the 1921 and 1929 film adaptations. In the latter three productions, Arliss&#x27; wife, Florence Arliss, appeared in the role of Mary.

In &quot;The Prime Minister,&quot; a 1941 British historical film starring John Gielgud as Disraeli, Mary was portrayed by Diana Wynyard.

In &quot;The Invincible Mr Disraeli,&quot; (1963) she was portrayed by Greer Garson. Trevor Howard acted the part of her husband.

In the four-part 1978 ATV miniseries &quot;&quot;, written by David Butler, she was portrayed by Mary Peach, opposite Ian McShane as Disraeli. The miniseries was presented in the U.S. on PBS&#x27;s Masterpiece Theatre in 1980 and was nominated for the Emmy Award for Outstanding Limited Series.

<text>Pierre-Joseph Redouté (, 10 July 1759 – 19 June 1840), was a painter and botanist from the Austrian Netherlands, known for his watercolours of roses, lilies and other flowers at the Château de Malmaison, many of which were published as large coloured stipple engravings. He was nicknamed &quot;the Raphael of flowers&quot; and has been called the greatest botanical illustrator of all time.

Redouté was an official court artist of Marie Antoinette, and continued painting through the French Revolution and Reign of Terror. He survived the turbulent political upheaval to gain international recognition for his precise renderings of plants, which remain as fresh in the early 21st century as when first painted. He combined great artistic skills with a pleasing and ingratiating personality which assisted him with his influential patrons. After Queen Marie-Antoinette, his patrons included both of Napoleon&#x27;s wives – Empress Joséphine and Marie Louise, Duchess of Parma – as well as Maria Amalia of Naples and Sicily, wife of Louis Philippe I, the last king of France.

Redouté collaborated with the greatest botanists of his day and participated in nearly fifty publications depicting both the familiar flowers of the French court and plants from places as distant as Japan, America, South Africa, and Australia. He worked from live plants rather than herbarium specimens, which contributed to his fresh subtle renderings. He was painting during a period in botanical illustration (1798 – 1837) that is noted for the publication of outstanding folio editions with coloured plates. Redouté produced over published plates depicting over different species, many never rendered before. Of the French botanical illustrators employed in the French capital, Redouté is the one who remains in the public consciousness today. He is seen as an important heir to the tradition of the Flemish and Dutch flower painters Brueghel, Ruysch, van Huysum and de Heem.

==Early life==

Redouté was born 10 July 1759, in Saint-Hubert, in the Belgian Luxembourg. Both his father and grandfather were painters, and his elder brother, Antoine Ferdinand, was an interior decorator and scenery designer. He never had much in the way of formal education, instead leaving home at the age of 13 to earn his living as an itinerant painter, doing interior decoration, portraits, and religious commissions. Eventually, in 1782, he made his way to Paris to join his brother in painting scenery for theatres.

==Painting career==
In Paris, Redouté met the botanists Charles Louis L&#x27;Héritier de Brutelle and René Desfontaines, who steered him towards botanical illustration, a rapidly growing discipline. L&#x27;Héritier became his instructor, teaching him to dissect flowers and portray their specific characteristics with precision. L&#x27;Heritier also introduced Redouté to members of the court at Versailles, following which Marie Antoinette became his patron. Redouté eventually received the title of Draughtsman and Painter to the Queen&#x27;s Cabinet.
Cheveau, a Parisian dealer, brought the young artist to the attention of the botanical artist Gerard van Spaendonck at the Jardin du Roi, which became the Jardin des plantes of the National Museum of Natural History, France in 1793, after the Revolution. Van Spaendonck became another of Redouté&#x27;s teachers, especially influencing his handling of watercolour.

In 1786, Redouté began to work at the National Museum of Natural History cataloguing the collections of flora and fauna and participating in botanical expeditions. In 1787, he left France to study plants at the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew near London, returning the following year. In 1792 he was employed by the French Academy of Sciences. In 1798, Empress Joséphine de Beauharnais, the first wife of Napoleon Bonaparte, became his patron and, some years later, he became her official artist. In 1809, Redouté taught painting to Princess Adélaïde of Orléans.

Redouté was engaged to paint selected plants from the garden at the Château de Malmaison, Paris. Whilst he was well known for the painting &quot;Les Roses&quot;, &quot;Jardin de la Malmaison&quot; has a distinctly Australian connection, as 46 of the 120 plates featured Australian plants, and the majority of these are endemic to Queensland. One of the first Australian plants Empress Joséphine chose for Redouté to illustrate was a common Queensland flowering vine, &quot;Hardenbergia violacea&quot; (false sarsaparilla), a vine seen in abundance in the Queensland bush. Other Queensland plants illustrated include the &quot;Pandorea pandorana&quot; (wonga wonga vine), &quot;Melaleuca styphelioides&quot; (prickly-leaved paperbark), and &quot;Hibiscus heterophyllus&quot; (native rosella).

== Later career and legacy ==
After Empress Joséphine&#x27;s death (1814), Redouté had some difficult years until he was appointed a master of draughtsmanship for the National Museum of Natural History in 1822. In 1824, he gave some drawing classes at the museum. Many of his pupils were aristocrats or royalty. He became a Chevalier of the Legion of Honour in 1825. Although particularly renowned for his botanical exploration of roses and lilies, he thereafter produced paintings purely for aesthetic value.

Redouté taught and painted up to the day he died of a stroke on 19 or 20 June 1840. He was survived by his wife, Marie-Marte Gobert, whom he married in 1786, and their two daughters. He was interred in Père Lachaise Cemetery. A Brussels school bears his name: the Institut Redouté-Peiffer in Anderlecht.

Most of the &quot;Les Liliacées&quot; watercolours went from the Empress Joséphine to her son from her first marriage Eugène de Beauharnais. Most of the watercolours of her &quot;Jardin de la Malmaison&quot; (gardens of Château de Malmaison) were acquired by the Fitzwilliam Museum in Cambridge.

Redouté&#x27;s paintings for &quot;Les Roses&quot; were bought by Charles X of France for his widowed daughter-in-law, Marie-Caroline of Bourbon-Two Sicilies, Duchess of Berry. Their whereabouts are virtually untraceable: in 1948 some were sold by Sotheby&#x27;s in London and a few were acquired by the Hunt Institute for Botanical Documentation; later, single sheets have appeared repeatedly in auction.

In 1985, 468 leaves were bought at a New York auction by an art dealer for approximately $5.5 million and then dispersed.

In the 20th and 21st century, numerous exhibitions in Europe, the Americas, and Australia have been devoted to the work of Redouté. The Biodiversity Heritage Library, the Library of Congress and other libraries have made many of his works accessible online and reproductions of his prints are available from virtually all print and poster shops.

<text>The Faerie Queene is an English epic poem by Edmund Spenser. Books IIII were first published in 1590, then republished in 1596 together with books IVVI. &quot;The Faerie Queene&quot; is notable for its form: at over 36,000 lines and over 4,000 stanzas, it is one of the longest poems in the English language; it is also the work in which Spenser invented the verse form known as the Spenserian stanza. On a literal level, the poem follows several knights as a means to examine different virtues. The poem is also an allegorical work. As such, it can be read on several levels, including as praise (or, later, criticism) of Queen Elizabeth I. In Spenser&#x27;s &quot;Letter of the Authors&quot;, he states that the entire epic poem is &quot;cloudily enwrapped in Allegorical devices&quot;, and that the aim of publishing &quot;The Faerie Queene&quot; was to &quot;fashion a gentleman or noble person in virtuous and gentle discipline&quot;.

Spenser presented the first three books of &quot;The Faerie Queene&quot; to Elizabeth I in 1589, probably sponsored by Walter Raleigh. The poem was a clear effort to gain court favour, and as a reward Elizabeth granted Spenser a pension for life amounting to £50 a year, though there is no further evidence that Elizabeth ever read any of the poem. This royal patronage elevated the poem to a level of success that made it Spenser&#x27;s defining work.

==Summary==

Book I is centred on the virtue of Holiness as embodied in the Redcrosse Knight. Largely self-contained, Book I can be understood to be its own miniature epic. At first, the Redcrosse Knight and his lady Una travel together when he defeats the monster Errour. Then they travel separately after the wizard Archimago, using a false dream, tricks the Redcrosse Knight into thinking that Una is unchaste. The Redcrosse Knight meets Duessa, who feigns distress in order to entrap him. Duessa leads the Redcrosse Knight to captivity by the giant Orgoglio. Meanwhile, Una seeks tirelessly to be reunited with the Redcrosse Knight. 
She overcomes many perils, meets Arthur, and finally rescues the Redcrosse Knight from his capture, from Duessa, and from Despair. Una and Arthur help the Redcrosse Knight recover in the House of Holiness, with the House&#x27;s ruler Caelia and her three daughters joining them. There, the Redcrosse Knight sees a vision of his future. He then returns Una to her parents&#x27; castle and rescues them from a dragon, and the two are betrothed after resisting Archimago one last time.

Book II is centred on the virtue of Temperance as embodied in Sir Guyon, who is tempted by the fleeing Archimago into nearly attacking the Redcrosse Knight. Guyon discovers a woman killing herself out of grief for having her lover tempted and bewitched by the witch Acrasia and killed. Guyon swears a vow to avenge them and protect their child. Guyon on his quest starts and stops fighting several evil, rash, or tricked knights and meets Arthur. Finally, they come to Acrasia&#x27;s Island and the Bower of Bliss, where Guyon resists temptations to violence, idleness, and lust. Guyon captures Acrasia in a net, destroys the Bower, and rescues those imprisoned there.

Book III is centred on the virtue of Chastity as embodied in Britomart, a lady knight. Resting after the events of Book II, Guyon and Arthur meet Britomart, who wins a joust with Guyon. They separate as Arthur and Guyon leave to rescue Florimell, while Britomart rescues the Redcrosse Knight. Britomart reveals to the Redcrosse Knight that she is pursuing Sir Artegall because she is destined to marry him. The Redcrosse Knight defends Artegall and they meet Merlin, who explains more carefully Britomart&#x27;s destiny to found the English monarchy. Britomart leaves and fights Sir Marinell. Arthur looks for Florimell, joined later by Sir Satyrane and Britomart, and they witness and resist sexual temptation. Britomart separates from them and meets Sir Scudamore, looking for his captured lady Amoret. Britomart alone is able to rescue Amoret from the wizard Busirane. Unfortunately, when they emerge from the castle Scudamore is gone. (The 1590 version with Books I–III depicts the lovers&#x27; happy reunion, but this was changed in the 1596 version which contained all six books.)

Book IV is called &quot;The Legend of Cambell and Telamond or Of Friendship.&quot; But despite its title, Cambell&#x27;s companion in Book IV is actually named Triamond, and the plot does not center on their friendship; the two men appear only briefly in the story. The book is largely a continuation of events begun in Book III. First, Scudamore is convinced by the hag Ate (discord) that Britomart has run off with Amoret and becomes jealous. A three-day tournament is then held by Satyrane, where Britomart beats Arthegal (both in disguise). Scudamore and Arthegal unite against Britomart, but when her helmet comes off in battle Arthegal falls in love with her. He surrenders, removes his helmet, and Britomart recognizes him as the man in the enchanted mirror. Arthegal pledges his love to her but must first leave and complete his quest. Scudamore, upon discovering Britomart&#x27;s sex, realizes his mistake and asks after his lady, but by this time Britomart has lost Amoret, and she and Scudamore embark together on a search for her. The reader discovers that Amoret was abducted by a savage man and is imprisoned in his cave. One day Amoret darts out past the savage and is rescued from him by the squire Timias and Belphoebe. Arthur then appears, offering his service as a knight to the lost woman. She accepts, and after a couple of trials on the way, Arthur and Amoret finally happen across Scudamore and Britomart. The two lovers are reunited. Wrapping up a different plotline from Book III, the recently recovered Marinell discovers Florimell suffering in Proteus&#x27; dungeon. He returns home and becomes sick with love and pity. Eventually he confesses his feelings to his mother, and she pleads with Neptune to have the girl released, which the god grants.

Book V is centred on the virtue of Justice as embodied in Sir Artegall, who defeats a demagogic giant and mediates several conflicts, including a joust held in honor of Florimell&#x27;s nuptials. The knight then attempts to free several men from their indenture to the Amazon Radigund. She defeats Artegall in battle by guile, and, according to the terms of their duel, he, a stickler for legal agreements, must become her slave as well. Britomart eventually rescues her betrothed and kills Radigund, thereby restoring a just relationship of the sexes. We are introduced to the court of Mercilla, where Duessa is put on trial and found guilty. Departing from Artegall, Spenser presents Prince Arthur&#x27;s quest to slay the beast Gerioneo in order to restore the lady Belge to her rights. In the final canto, Artegall aids Sir Burbon and slays the monstrous Grantorto.

Book VI is centred on the virtue of Courtesy as embodied in Sir Calidore who is on a mission from the Faerie Queene to slay the Blatant Beast. After helping reconcile two lovers and taking on the courteous young Tristram as his page, he falls prey to the pleasant distractions of pastoral life and eventually wins the affections of Pastorella away from the ultimately agreeable but somewhat cowardly Coridon. This book also features the knight Calepine and his quest for his lady Serena who is cared for by a strangely well-mannered Savage who, like the humble Pastorella, turns out to be a long-lost scion of nobility; Arthur later takes on Serena and leaves her to the care of his page Timias and a Hermit who has been a knight. Calidore rescues his love from the Blatant Beast, capturing and binding the monster, which nonetheless, we are told, eventually escapes to prowl about the world once more to seek the ruin of more reputations.

Published with &quot;The Faerie Queene&quot; in the Folio of 1609 and generally agreed to have been part of Spenser&#x27;s plan for Book VII are the Cantos of Mutability, in which Jove&#x27;s sway over the universe is challenged by Mutability, the Titan goddess of change, who takes her case to a court presided over by Nature, who, after spirited arguments on both sides, rules against the Titaness and in favor of Jove.

==Major characters==

* Acrasia, seductress of knights. Guyon destroys her Bower of Bliss at the end of Book 2. Similar characters in other epics: Circe (Homer&#x27;s &quot;Odyssey&quot;), Alcina (Ariosto), Armida (Tasso), or the fairy woman from Keats&#x27; poem &quot;La Belle Dame sans Merci&quot;.
* Amoret(ta), the betrothed of Scudamour, kidnapped by Busirane on her wedding night, saved by Britomart. She represents the virtue of married love, and her marriage to Scudamour serves as the example that Britomart and Artegall seek to copy. Amoret and Scudamor are separated for a time by circumstances, but remain loyal to each other until they (presumably) are reunited.
* Archimago, an evil sorcerer who is sent to stop the knights in the service of the Faerie Queene. Of the knights, Archimago hates Redcrosse most of all, hence he is symbolically the nemesis of England.
* Artegall (also spelled Artegal, Arthegal, or Arthegall), a knight who is the embodiment and champion of Justice. He meets Britomart after defeating her in a sword fight (she had been dressed as a knight) and removing her helmet, revealing her beauty. Artegall quickly falls in love with Britomart. Artegall has a companion in Talus, a metal man who wields a flail and never sleeps or tires but will mercilessly pursue and kill any number of villains. Talus obeys Artegall&#x27;s command, and serves to represent justice without mercy (hence, Artegall is the more human face of justice). Later, Talus does not rescue Artegall from enslavement by the wicked slave-mistress Radigund, because Artegall is bound by a legal contract to serve her. Only her death, at Britomart&#x27;s hands, liberates him. Chrysaor was the golden sword of Sir Artegall. This sword was also the favorite weapon of Demeter, the Greek goddess of the harvest. Because it was &quot;Tempred with Adamant&quot;, it could cleave through anything.
* Arthur of the Round Table, but playing a different role here. He is madly in love with the Faerie Queene and spends his time in pursuit of her when not helping the other knights out of their sundry predicaments. Prince Arthur is the Knight of Magnificence, the perfection of all virtues.
* Ate, a fiend from Hell disguised as a beautiful maiden. Ate opposes Book IV&#x27;s virtue of friendship through spreading discord. She is aided in her task by Duessa, the female deceiver of Book I, whom Ate summoned from Hell. Ate and Duessa have fooled the false knights Blandamour and Paridell into taking them as lovers. Her name is possibly inspired by the Greek goddess of misfortune Atë, said to have been thrown from Heaven by Zeus, similar to the fallen angels.
* Belphoebe, the beautiful sister of Amoret who spends her time in the woods hunting and avoiding the numerous amorous men who chase her. Timias, the squire of Arthur, eventually wins her love after she tends to the injuries he sustained in battle; however, Timias must endure much suffering to prove his love when Belphoebe sees him tending to a wounded woman and, misinterpreting his actions, flies off hastily. She is only drawn back to him after seeing how he has wasted away without her.

* Britomart, a female knight, the embodiment and champion of Chastity. She is young and beautiful, and falls in love with Artegall upon first seeing his face in her father&#x27;s magic mirror. Though there is no interaction between them, she travels to find him again, dressed as a knight and accompanied by her nurse, Glauce. Britomart carries an enchanted spear that allows her to defeat every knight she encounters, until she loses to a knight who turns out to be her beloved Artegall. (Parallel figure in Ariosto: Bradamante.) Britomart is one of the most important knights in the story. She searches the world, including a pilgrimage to the shrine of Isis, and a visit with Merlin the magician. She rescues Artegall, and several other knights, from the evil slave-mistress Radigund. Furthermore, Britomart accepts Amoret at a tournament, refusing the false Florimell.
* Busirane, the evil sorcerer who captures Amoret on her wedding night. When Britomart enters his castle to defeat him, she finds him holding Amoret captive. She is bound to a pillar and Busirane is torturing her. The clever Britomart handily defeats him and returns Amoret to her husband.
* Caelia, the ruler of the House of Holiness.
* Calidore, the Knight of Courtesy, hero of Book VI. He is on a quest from the Faerie Queene to slay the Blatant Beast.
* Cambell, one of the Knights of Friendship, hero of Book IV. Brother of Canacee and friend of Triamond.
* Cambina, daughter of Agape and sister to Priamond, Diamond, and Triamond. Cambina is depicted holding a caduceus and a cup of nepenthe, signifying her role as a figure of concord. She marries Cambell after bringing an end to his fight with Triamond.
* Colin Clout, a shepherd noted for his songs and bagpipe playing, briefly appearing in Book VI. He is the same Colin Clout as in Spenser&#x27;s pastoral poetry, which is fitting because Calidore is taking a sojourn into a world of pastoral delight, ignoring his duty to hunt the Blatant Beast, which is why he set out to Ireland to begin with. Colin Clout may also be said to be Spenser himself.
* Cymochles, a knight in Book II who is defined by indecision and fluctuations of the will. He and his fiery brother Pyrochles represent emotional maladies that threaten temperance. The two brothers are both slain by Prince Arthur in Canto VIII.
* Chrysogonee, mother of Belphoebe and her twin Amoretta. She hides in the forest and, becoming tired, falls asleep on a bank, where she is impregnated by sunbeams and gives birth to twins. The goddesses Venus and Diana find the newborn twins and take them: Venus takes Amoretta and raises her in the Garden of Adonis, and Diana takes Belphoebe.
* Despair, a distraught man in a cave, his name coming from his mood. Using just rhetoric, he nearly persuades Redcrosse Knight to commit suicide, before Una steps in. 
* Duessa, a lady who personifies Falsehood in Book I, known to Redcrosse as &quot;Fidessa&quot;. As the opposite of Una, she represents the &quot;false&quot; religion of the Roman Catholic Church. She is also initially an assistant, or at least a servant, to Archimago.

* Florimell, a lady in love with the knight Marinell, who initially rejects her. Hearing that he has been wounded, she sets out to find him and faces various perils, culminating in her capture by the sea god Proteus. She is reunited with Marinell at the end of Book IV, and is married to him in Book V.
* Guyon, the Knight of Temperance, the hero of Book II. He is the leader of the Knights of Maidenhead and carries the image of Gloriana on his shield. According to the &quot;Golden Legend&quot;, St. George&#x27;s name shares etymology with Guyon, which specifically means &quot;the holy wrestler&quot;.

* Marinell, &quot;the knight of the sea&quot;; son of a water nymph, he avoided all love because his mother had learnt that a maiden was destined to do him harm; this prophecy was fulfilled when he was stricken down in battle by Britomart, though he was not mortally wounded.
* Orgoglio, an evil giant. means &quot;pride&quot; in Italian.
* The Redcrosse Knight, hero of Book I. Introduced in the first canto of the poem, he bears the emblem of Saint George, patron saint of England; a red cross on a white background that is still the flag of England. The Redcrosse Knight is declared the real Saint George in Canto X. He also learns that he is of English ancestry, having been stolen by a Fay and raised in Faerieland. In the climactic battle of Book I, Redcrosse slays the dragon that has laid waste to Eden. He marries Una at the end of Book I, but brief appearances in Books II and III show him still questing through the world.
* Satyrane, a wild half-satyr man raised in the wild and the epitome of natural human potential. Tamed by Una, he protects her, but ends up locked in a battle against the chaotic Sansloy, which remains unconcluded. Satyrane finds Florimell&#x27;s girdle, which she drops while flying from a beast. He holds a three-day tournament for the right to possess the girdle. His Knights of Maidenhead win the day with Britomart&#x27;s help.
* Scudamour, the lover of Amoret. His name means &quot;shield of love&quot;. This character is based on Sir James Scudamore, a jousting champion and courtier to Queen Elizabeth I. Scudamour loses his love Amoret to the sorcerer Busirane. Though the 1590 edition of &quot;The Faerie Queene&quot; has Scudamour united with Amoret through Britomart&#x27;s assistance, the continuation in Book IV has them separated, never to be reunited.
* Talus, an &quot;iron man&quot; who helps Arthegall to dispense justice in Book V. The name is likely from Latin &quot;talus&quot; (ankle) with reference to that which justice &quot;stands on&quot;, and perhaps also to the ankle of Achilles, who was otherwise invincible, or the mythological bronze man Talos.
* Triamond, one of the Knights of Friendship, a hero of Book IV. Friend of Cambell. One of three brothers; when Priamond and Diamond died, their souls joined with his body. After battling Cambell, Triamond marries Cambell&#x27;s sister, Canacee.
* Una, the personification of the &quot;True Church&quot;. She travels with the Redcrosse Knight (who represents England), whom she has recruited to save her parents&#x27; castle from a dragon. She also defeats Duessa, who represents the &quot;false&quot; (Catholic) church and the person of Mary, Queen of Scots, in a trial reminiscent of that which ended in Mary&#x27;s beheading. Una is also representative of Truth.

==Themes==

===Allegory of virtue===

A letter written by Spenser to Sir Walter Raleigh in 1590 contains a preface for &quot;The Faerie Queene&quot;, in which Spenser describes the allegorical presentation of virtues through Arthurian knights in the mythical &quot;Faerieland&quot;. Presented as a preface to the epic in most published editions, this letter outlines plans for twenty-four books: twelve based each on a different knight who exemplified one of twelve &quot;private virtues&quot;, and a possible twelve more centred on King Arthur displaying twelve &quot;public virtues&quot;. Spenser names Aristotle as his source for these virtues, though the influences of Thomas Aquinas and the traditions of medieval allegory can be observed as well. It is impossible to predict how the work would have looked had Spenser lived to complete it, since the reliability of the predictions made in his letter to Raleigh is not absolute, as numerous divergences from that scheme emerged as early as 1590 in the first &quot;Faerie Queene&quot; publication.

In addition to the six virtues Holiness, Temperance, Chastity, Friendship, Justice, and Courtesy, the Letter to Raleigh suggests that Arthur represents the virtue of Magnificence, which (&quot;according to Aristotle and the rest&quot;) is &quot;the perfection of all the rest, and containeth in it them all&quot;; and that the Faerie Queene herself represents Glory (hence her name, Gloriana). The unfinished seventh book (the Cantos of Mutability) appears to have represented the virtue of &quot;constancy&quot;.

===Religion===

&quot;The Faerie Queene&quot; was written during the Reformation, a time of religious and political controversy. After taking the throne following the death of her half-sister Mary, Elizabeth changed the official religion of the nation to Protestantism. The plot of book one is similar to &quot;Foxe&#x27;s Book of Martyrs&quot;, which was about the persecution of the Protestants and how Catholic rule was unjust. Spenser includes the controversy of Elizabethan church reform within the epic. Gloriana has godly English knights destroy Catholic continental power in Books I and V. Spenser also endows many of his villains with &quot;the worst of what Protestants considered a superstitious Catholic reliance on deceptive images&quot;.

===Politics===
The poem celebrates, memorializes, and critiques the House of Tudor (of which Elizabeth was a part), much as Virgil&#x27;s &quot;Aeneid&quot; celebrates Augustus&#x27;s Rome. The &quot;Aeneid&quot; states that Augustus descended from the noble sons of Troy; similarly, &quot;The Faerie Queene&quot; suggests that the Tudor lineage can be connected to King Arthur. The poem is deeply allegorical and allusive; many prominent Elizabethans could have found themselves partially represented by one or more of Spenser&#x27;s figures. Elizabeth herself is the most prominent example. She appears in the guise of Gloriana, the Faerie Queen, but also in Books III and IV as the virgin Belphoebe, daughter of Chrysogonee and twin to Amoret, the embodiment of womanly married love. Perhaps also, more critically, Elizabeth is seen in Book I as Lucifera, the &quot;maiden queen&quot; whose brightly lit Court of Pride masks a dungeon full of prisoners.

The poem also displays Spenser&#x27;s thorough familiarity with literary history. The world of &quot;The Faerie Queene&quot; is based on English Arthurian legend, but much of the language, spirit, and style of the piece draw more on Italian epic, particularly Ludovico Ariosto&#x27;s &quot;Orlando Furioso&quot; and Torquato Tasso&#x27;s &quot;Jerusalem Delivered&quot;.
Book V of &quot;The Faerie Queene&quot;, the Book of Justice, is Spenser&#x27;s most direct discussion of political theory. In it, Spenser attempts to tackle the problem of policy toward Ireland and recreates the trial of Mary, Queen of Scots.

=== Archetypes ===
In &quot;The Faerie Queene&quot;, Edmund Spenser employs archetypal patterns to reinforce the actuality of his narrative. Spenser integrates these patterns to focus the meaning of the past on the present, emphasizing the significance of Elizabeth&#x27;s reign by converting myth into event rather than the other way around. This approach blurs the lines between archetypal and historical elements within the poem. For instance, the British Chronicle, which Arthur reads in the House of Alma, serves as a poetical equivalent for factual history despite its partially imaginary nature. This kind of poetical history is distinct from myth, as it consists of unique events recorded in chronological order. This distinction is evident in the political allegory of Books I and V, where the reality of interpreted events becomes more apparent when the events are closer to the time of the poem&#x27;s composition.

Throughout &quot;The Faerie Queene&quot;, Spenser&#x27;s use of archetypal patterns includes numerous mythological equivalents that enhance the narrative&#x27;s depth and complexity. For example, the characters Florimell and Marinell are related to the myths of Proserpine and Adonis, respectively. Florimell, much like Eurydice, represents the pursuit of the unattainable, highlighting themes of purity and chastity. Marinell&#x27;s link to Adonis underscores the fragility and vulnerability inherent in beauty and desire.

Similarly, the characters Una and Redcross can be seen as archetypal representations of divine grace and the Christian Church in England. Una, equated with Dante&#x27;s Beatrice, embodies the archetype of divine wisdom and truth, guiding Redcross on his spiritual journey. This alignment with Beatrice also emphasizes Una&#x27;s role as a symbol of divine grace leading to salvation. Redcross, representing the archetypal Christian Everyman, embarks on a quest that mirrors the soul&#x27;s journey toward holiness. His ultimate victory over the dragon symbolizes the archetypal triumph of good over evil and the attainment of spiritual purity.

===Symbolism and allusion===
Throughout &quot;The Faerie Queene&quot;, Spenser creates &quot;a network of allusions to events, issues, and particular persons in England and Ireland&quot; including Mary, Queen of Scots, the Spanish Armada, the English Reformation, and even the Queen herself. It is also known that James VI of Scotland read the poem, and was very insulted by Duessa – a very negative depiction of his mother, Mary, Queen of Scots. &quot;The Faerie Queene&quot; was then banned in Scotland. This led to a significant decrease in Elizabeth&#x27;s support for the poem. Within the text, both the Faerie Queene and Belphoebe serve as two of the many personifications of Queen Elizabeth, some of which are &quot;far from complimentary&quot;.

Though it praises her in some ways, &quot;The Faerie Queene&quot; questions Elizabeth&#x27;s ability to rule so effectively because of her gender, and also inscribes the &quot;shortcomings&quot; of her rule. There is a character named Britomart who represents married chastity. This character is told that her destiny is to be an &quot;immortal womb&quot; – to have children. Here, Spenser is referring to Elizabeth&#x27;s unmarried state and is touching on anxieties of the 1590s about what would happen after her death since the kingdom had no heir.

&quot;The Faerie Queene&#x27;s&quot; original audience would have been able to identify many of the poem&#x27;s characters by analyzing the symbols and attributes that spot Spenser&#x27;s text. For example, readers would immediately know that &quot;a woman who wears scarlet clothes and resides along the Tiber River represents the Roman Catholic Church&quot;. However, marginal notes jotted in early copies of &quot;The Faerie Queene&quot; suggest that Spenser&#x27;s contemporaries were unable to come to a consensus about the precise historical referents of the poem&#x27;s &quot;myriad figures&quot;. In fact, Sir Walter Raleigh&#x27;s wife identified many of the poem&#x27;s female characters as &quot;allegorical representations of herself&quot;.
Other symbols prevalent in &quot;The Faerie Queene&quot; are the numerous animal characters present in the poem. They take the role of &quot;visual figures in the allegory and in illustrative similes and metaphors&quot;. Specific examples include the swine present in Lucifera&#x27;s castle who embodied gluttony, and Duessa, the deceitful crocodile who may represent Mary, Queen of Scots, in a negative light.

The House of Busirane episode in Book III in &quot;The Faerie Queene&quot; is partially based on an early modern English folktale called &quot;Mr. Fox&#x27;s Mottos&quot;. In the tale, a young woman named Lady Mary has been enticed by Mr. Fox, who resembles Bluebeard in his manner of killing his wives. She defeats Mr. Fox and tells about his deeds. Notably, Spenser quotes the story as Britomart makes her way through the House, with warning mottos above each doorway &quot;Be bold, be bold, but not too bold&quot;.

==Composition==

===Spenser&#x27;s intentions===
While writing his poem, Spenser strove to avoid &quot;gealous opinions and misconstructions&quot; because he thought it would place his story in a &quot;better light&quot; for his readers. Spenser stated in his letter to Raleigh, published with the first three books, that &quot;the general end of the book is to fashion a gentleman or noble person in virtuous and gentle discipline&quot;. Spenser considered his work &quot;a historical fiction&quot; which men should read for &quot;delight&quot; rather than &quot;the profit of the ensample&quot;. &quot;The Faerie Queene&quot; was written for Elizabeth to read and was dedicated to her. However, there are dedicatory sonnets in the first edition to many powerful Elizabethan figures.

Spenser addresses &quot;lodwick&quot; in &quot;Amoretti&quot; 33, when talking about &quot;The Faerie Queene&quot; still being incomplete. This could be either his friend Lodowick Bryskett or his long deceased Italian model Ludovico Ariosto, whom he praises in &quot;Letter to Raleigh&quot;.

=== Dedication ===

The poem is dedicated to Elizabeth I who is represented in the poem as the Faerie Queene Gloriana, as well as the character Belphoebe. Spenser prefaces the poem with sonnets additionally dedicated to Sir Christopher Hatton, Lord Burleigh, the Earl of Oxford, the Earl of Northumberland, the Earl of Cumberland, the Earl of Essex, the Earl of Ormond and Ossory, High Admiral Charles Howard, Lord Hunsdon, Lord Grey of Wilton, Lord Buckhurst, Sir Francis Walsingham, Sir John Norris, Sir Walter Raleigh, the Countess of Pembroke (on the subject of her brother Sir Philip Sidney), and Lady Carew.

===Social commentary===
In October 1589, after nine years in Ireland, Spenser voyaged to England and saw the Queen. It is possible that he read to her from his manuscript at this time. On 25 February 1591, the Queen gave him a pension of fifty pounds per year. He was paid in four instalments on 25 March, 24 June, 29 September, and 25 December.
After the first three books of &quot;The Faerie Queene&quot; were published in 1590, Spenser found himself disappointed in the monarchy; among other things, &quot;his annual pension from the Queen was smaller than he would have liked&quot; and his humanist perception of Elizabeth&#x27;s court &quot;was shattered by what he saw there&quot;. Despite these frustrations, however, Spenser &quot;kept his aristocratic prejudices and predispositions&quot;. Book VI stresses that there is &quot;almost no correlation between noble deeds and low birth&quot; and reveals that to be a &quot;noble person&quot;, one must be a &quot;gentleman of choice stock&quot;.

Throughout &quot;The Faerie Queene&quot;, virtue is seen as &quot;a feature for the nobly born&quot; and within Book VI, readers encounter worthy deeds that indicate aristocratic lineage. An example of this is the hermit to whom Arthur brings Timias and Serena. Initially, the man is considered a &quot;goodly knight of a gentle race&quot; who &quot;withdrew from public service to religious life when he grew too old to fight&quot;. Here, we note the hermit&#x27;s noble blood seems to have influenced his gentle, selfless behaviour. Likewise, audiences acknowledge that young Tristram &quot;speaks so well and acts so heroically&quot; that Calidore &quot;frequently contributes him with noble birth&quot; even before learning his background; in fact, it is no surprise that Tristram turns out to be the son of a king, explaining his profound intellect. However, Spenser&#x27;s most peculiar example of noble birth is demonstrated through the characterization of the Salvage Man. Using the Salvage Man as an example, Spenser demonstrated that &quot;ungainly appearances do not disqualify one from noble birth&quot;. By giving the Salvage Man a &quot;frightening exterior&quot;, Spenser stresses that &quot;virtuous deeds are a more accurate indication of gentle blood than physical appearance.

On the opposite side of the spectrum, &quot;The Faerie Queene&quot; indicates qualities such as cowardice and discourtesy that signify low birth. During his initial encounter with Arthur, Turpine &quot;hides behind his retainers, chooses ambush from behind instead of direct combat, and cowers to his wife, who covers him with her voluminous skirt&quot;. These actions demonstrate that Turpine is &quot;morally emasculated by fear&quot; and furthermore, &quot;the usual social roles are reversed as the lady protects the knight from danger. Scholars believe that this characterization serves as &quot;a negative example of knighthood&quot; and strives to teach Elizabethan aristocrats how to &quot;identify a commoner with political ambitions inappropriate to his rank&quot;.

===Poetic structure===
&quot;The Faerie Queene&quot; was written in Spenserian stanza, which Spenser created specifically for &quot;The Faerie Queene&quot;. Spenser varied existing epic stanza forms, the rhyme royal used by Chaucer with the rhyme pattern ABABBCC, and the &quot;ottava rima&quot; with the rhyme pattern ABABABCC. Spenser&#x27;s stanza is the longest of the three, with nine iambic lines. The first eight lines are five-footed, that is, pentameters. The ninth line is six-footed, that is, a hexameter, or Alexandrine. Altogether these form two &quot;interlocking quatrains and a final couplet&quot;. The rhyme pattern is ABABBCBCC. Over two thousand stanzas were written for the 1590 &quot;Faerie Queene&quot;.

===Theological structure===
In Elizabethan England, no subject was more familiar to writers than theology. Elizabethans learned to embrace religious studies in petty school, where they &quot;read from selections from the Book of Common Prayer and memorized Catechisms from the Scriptures&quot;. This influence is evident in Spenser&#x27;s text, as demonstrated in the moral allegory of Book I. Here, allegory is organized in the traditional arrangement of Renaissance theological treatises and confessionals. While reading Book I, audiences first encounter original sin, justification and the nature of sin before analysing the church and the sacraments. Despite this pattern, Book I is not a theological treatise; within the text, &quot;moral and historical allegories intermingle&quot; and the reader encounters elements of romance. However, Spenser&#x27;s method is not &quot;a rigorous and unyielding allegory&quot;, but &quot;a compromise among conflicting elements&quot;. In Book I of &quot;The Faerie Queene&quot; the discussion of the path to salvation begins with original sin and justification, skipping past initial matters of God, the Creeds, and Adam&#x27;s fall from grace. This literary decision is pivotal because these doctrines &quot;center the fundamental theological controversies of the Reformation&quot;.

==Sources==

===Myth and history===
During &quot;The Faerie Queene&#x27;s&quot; inception, Spenser worked as a civil servant, in &quot;relative seclusion from the political and literary events of his day&quot;. As Spenser laboured in solitude, &quot;The Faerie Queene&quot; manifested within his mind, blending his experiences into the content of his craft. Within his poem, Spenser explores human consciousness and conflict, relating to a variety of genres including sixteenth century Arthurian literature. &quot;The Faerie Queene&quot; was influenced strongly by Italian works, as were many other works in England at that time. &quot;The Faerie Queene&quot; draws heavily on Ariosto and Tasso.

The first three books of &quot;The Faerie Queene&quot; operate as a unit, representing the entire cycle from the fall of Troy to the reign of Elizabeth. Using &quot;in medias res&quot;, Spenser introduces his historical narrative at three different intervals, using chronicle, civil conversation, and prophecy as its occasions.

Despite the historical elements of his text, Spenser is careful to label himself a historical poet as opposed to a historiographer. Spenser notes this differentiation in his letter to Raleigh, noting &quot;a Historiographer discourseth of affairs orderly as they were done ... but a Poet thrusteth into the midst ... and maketh a pleasing Analysis of all&quot;.

Spenser&#x27;s characters embody Elizabethan values, highlighting political and aesthetic associations of Tudor Arthurian tradition in order to bring his work to life. While Spenser respected British history and &quot;contemporary culture confirmed his attitude&quot;, his literary freedom demonstrates that he was &quot;working in the realm of mythopoeic imagination rather than that of historical fact&quot;. In fact, Spenser&#x27;s Arthurian material serves as a subject of debate, intermediate between &quot;legendary history and historical myth&quot; offering him a range of &quot;evocative tradition and freedom that historian&#x27;s responsibilities preclude&quot;. Concurrently, Spenser adopts the role of a sceptic, reflected in the way in which he handles the British history, which &quot;extends to the verge of self-satire&quot;.

===Medieval subject matter===
&quot;The Faerie Queene&quot; owes, in part, its central figure, Arthur, to a medieval writer, Geoffrey of Monmouth. In his &quot;Prophetiae Merlini&quot; (&quot;Prophecies of Merlin&quot;), Geoffrey&#x27;s Merlin proclaims that the Saxons will rule over the Britons until the &quot;Boar of Cornwall&quot; (Arthur) again restores them to their rightful place as rulers. The prophecy was adopted by the Welsh and eventually used by the Tudors. Through their ancestor, Owen Tudor, the Tudors had Welsh blood, through which they claimed to be descendants of Arthur and rightful rulers of Britain. The tradition begun by Geoffrey of Monmouth set the perfect atmosphere for Spenser&#x27;s choice of Arthur as the central figure and natural bridegroom of Gloriana.

==Language and Diction==

===Archaisms===

Spenser&#x27;s language in &quot;The Faerie Queene&quot;, as in the earlier &quot;The Shepheardes Calender&quot;, is in part deliberately archaic. Seventeenth-century philologist Sir William Davenant considered Spenser&#x27;s use of &quot;obsolete language&quot; as the &quot;most vulgar accusation that is laid to his charge&quot;. Samuel Johnson found Spencer&#x27;s writings &quot;a useful source for obsolete and archaic words&quot;, but also asserted that &quot;in affecting the ancients Spenser writ no language&quot;. Herbert Wilfred Sugden argues in &quot;The Grammar of Spenser&#x27;s Faerie Queene&quot; that the archaisms reside &quot;chiefly in vocabulary, to a high degree in spelling, to some extent in the inflexions, and only slightly in the syntax&quot;.

Examples of medieval archaisms (in morphology and diction) include:
* Infinitive in &quot;-en&quot;: &quot;vewen&quot; 1. 201, &#x27;to view&#x27;;
* Prefix &quot;y-&quot; retained in participle: &quot;yclad&quot;, 1. 58, 254, &#x27;clad, clothed&#x27;;
* Adjective: &quot;combrous&quot;, 1. 203, &#x27;harassing, troublesome&#x27;;
* Verb: &quot;keepe&quot;, 1. 360, &#x27;heed, give attention to&#x27;.

Allowing that Johnson&#x27;s remark may only apply to Spencer&#x27;s &quot;Calender&quot;, Bruce Robert McElderry Jr. states, after a detailed investigation of &quot;The Faerie Queene&quot;″s diction, that Jonson&#x27;s statement &quot;is a skillful epigram; but it seriously misrepresents the truth if taken at anything like its face value&quot;. The number of archaisms used in the poem is not overwhelming—one source reports thirty-four in Canto I of Book I, that is, thirty-four words out of a total forty-two hundred words, less than one percent. According to McElderry, language alone does not account for the poem&#x27;s archaic tone. &quot;The subject-matter of &quot;The Faerie Queene&quot; is itself the most powerful factor in creating the impression of archaism.&quot;

===Classical References===

&quot;The Faerie Queene&quot; relies on classical vocabulary and proper names, especially in the later books. Spenser coined names based on Greek, such as &quot;Poris&quot; and &quot;Phao lilly white&quot;. 

One scholar argued that both classical epic literature and Spencer&#x27;s work &quot;involve[] the principles of imitation and decorum,&quot; which explains and justifies the use of classical vocabulary and forms. 

===Overall Assessment===

Spenser is &quot;a conscious literary artist&quot;, and his language is &quot;the only fitting vehicle for his tone of thought and feelings.&quot; Spenser&#x27;s language may be contrasted with that of the &quot;free and unregulated&quot; grammar of Shakespeare. Overall, Spenser&#x27;s style is standardized, lyrically sophisticated, and occasionally archaic, all of which give the poem its character.

==Adaptation and derivative works==
Numerous adaptations in the form of children&#x27;s literature have been made – the work was a popular choice in the 19th and early 20th century with over 20 different versions written, with the earliest being E. W. Bradburn&#x27;s &quot;Legends from Spencer&#x27;s Fairy Queen, for Children&quot; (1829), written in the form of a dialogue between mother and children. 19th-century adaptations often concentrated on the moral aspect of the tale. Adaptions of the work were more popular in the United Kingdom than in the United States.

The Edwardian era was particularly rich in adaptation for children, and the works richly illustrated, with contributing artists including A. G. Walker, Gertrude Demain Hammond, T. H. Robinson, Frank C. Papé, Brinsley Le Fanu, and H. J. Ford. Additionally, Walter Crane illustrated a six-volume collection of the complete work, published 1897, considered a great example of the Arts and Crafts movement.

In &quot;The Mathematics of Magic&quot;, the second of Fletcher Pratt and L. Sprague de Camp&#x27;s Harold Shea stories, the modern American adventurers Harold Shea and Reed Chalmers visit the world of The Faerie Queene, where they discover that the greater difficulties faced by Spenser&#x27;s knights in the later portions of the poem are explained by the evil enchanters of the piece having organized a guild to more effectively oppose them. Shea and Chalmers reveal this conspiracy to the knights and assist in its overthrow. In the process, Belphebe and Florimel of Faerie become respectively the wives of Shea and Chalmers and accompany them on further adventures in other worlds of myth and fantasy.

A considerable part of Elizabeth Bear&#x27;s &quot;Promethean Age&quot; series takes place in a Kingdom of Faerie which is loosely based on the one described by Spenser. As depicted by Bear, Spenser was aware of this Kingdom&#x27;s existence and his work was actually a description of fact rather than invented fantasy; Queen Elizabeth I had a secret pact of mutual help with the Queen of Faerie; and such historical characters as Christopher Marlowe and William Shakespeare visited Faerie and had adventures there.

According to Richard Simon Keller, George Lucas&#x27;s &quot;Star Wars&quot; film also contains elements of a loose adaptation, as well as being influenced by other works, with parallels including the story of the Red Cross Knight championing Una against the evil Archimago in the original compared with Lucas&#x27;s Luke Skywalker, Princess Leia, and Darth Vader. Keller sees extensive parallels between the film and book one of Spenser&#x27;s work, stating &quot;[A]lmost everything of importance that we see in the &quot;Star Wars&quot; movie has its origin in &quot;The Faerie Queene&quot;, from small details of weaponry and dress to large issues of chivalry and spirituality&quot;.

==References in popular culture==
The Netflix series &quot;The Crown&quot; references &quot;The Faerie Queene&quot; and Gloriana in season 1 episode 10, entitled &quot;Gloriana&quot;. In the final scene, Queen Elizabeth II, portrayed by Claire Foy, is being photographed. Prompting Her Majesty&#x27;s poses, Cecil Beaton says:&quot;All hail sage Lady, whom a grateful Isle hath blessed.&quot; Not moving, not breathing. Our very own goddess. &quot;Glorious Gloriana&quot;. Forgetting Elizabeth Windsor now. Now only Elizabeth Regina. Yes.

Near the end of the 1995 adaptation of &quot;Sense and Sensibility&quot;, Colonel Brandon reads &quot;The Faerie Queene&quot; aloud to Marianne Dashwood.

Quotes from the poem are used as epigraphs in &quot;Troubled Blood&quot; by Robert Galbraith, a pen name of J. K. Rowling.

In the &quot;Thursday Next&quot; series by Jasper Fforde, Granny Next (who is an older version of Thursday Next herself) is condemned to reading the &quot;ten most boring classics&quot; before she can die. She finally passes away after reading &quot;The Faerie Queene&quot;.

An early, influential text-based computer game that was based on the &quot;Star Trek&quot; television show, originally entitled &quot;Star Trek&quot; and later &quot;Super Star Trek&quot;, was published in 1971 by Mike Mayfield. In one of the first instances of respawning in a computer game, the player could abandon ship if the USS &quot;Enterprise&quot; became too damaged to continue fighting, in which case the replacement ship was named the &quot;Faerie Queene&quot;.

<text>Thomas Fincke (6 January 1561 – 24 April 1656) was a Danish mathematician and physicist, and a professor at the University of Copenhagen for more than 60 years.

==Biography==
Thomas Jacobsen Fincke was born in Flensburg in Schleswig.
Fincke was the son of Councillor Jacob Fincke and Anna Thorsmede. He completed his primary schooling at Flensburg. From 1577, he studied mathematics, rhetoric and other philosophical studies for five years at the University of Strasbourg.

Fincke&#x27;s lasting achievement is found in his book &quot;Geometria rotundi&quot; (1583), in which he introduced the modern names of the trigonometric functions tangent and secant. In 1590, he became professor of mathematics at the University of Copenhagen. In 1603 he also obtained a professorship in medicine.

==Personal life==
He was married to Ivaria Jungesdatter Ivers (1574–1614).
His son Jacob Fincke (1592–1663) was a professor of physics.
His daughters married scientist Caspar Bartholin the Elder (1585–1629), botanist Jørgen Fuiren (1581–1628), historian Ole Worm (1588–1654) and theologian Hans Brochmand (1594–1630).
Fincke died at Copenhagen and was buried at Vor Frue Kirke.

<doc id="76078" wikidata="Q640949" url="?curid=76078" title="Steen Eiler Rasmussen">
<text>Steen Eiler Rasmussen, Hon. FAIA (9 January 1898 – 19 June 1990) was a Danish architect and urban planner who was a professor at the Royal Danish Academy of Fine Arts, and a prolific writer of books and poetry. He was made a Royal Designer for Industry by the British Royal Society of Arts in 1947.

==Early life and education==
Steen Eiler Rasmussen was born on 19 February 1898 in Copenhagen to Lieutenant colonel and later general Christian Rasmussen and Anna Dorthea (Dori) Jung. He first apprenticed as a mason and then studied architecture at the Royal Danish Academy of Fine Arts from 1916 to 1918. In 1919 he set up his own practice.

==Architecture and urban planning==
It was mainly as an urban planner that he made his name. He was part of the Danish Urban Planning Laboratory from 1924, as the Academy Council&#x27;s representative, and its leader from 1942 to 1948. From 1932 to 1938 he worked at Copenhagen Municipality&#x27;s Department for Urban Planning.

Through his involvement in the Urban Planning Laboratory, he was an important part of the process which led to the Finger Plan which has governed the overall development of suburban Copenhagen ever since. He also co-planned the area Tingbjerg town (yellow brickstone and greens) with C.Th. Sørensen in Copenhagen North West, as well as the town Hørsholm.

Among the buildings he has designed are Ringsted Town Hall, Mødrehjælpen (a social institution for women) in Copenhagen Ø and his own house in Rungsted Kyst Hørsholm, north of Copenhagen(1938).

==Academia==
Rasmussen was a lecturer at the Academy from 1924 and became a professor in 1936. Among his students were Jørn Utzon, designer of the Sydney Opera House, and Marian Pepler who designed rugs for Gordon Russell in the 1930s .

==Writings==
One of Rasmussen&#x27;s most influential books was &quot;Experiencing Architecture&quot;, first published in Danish in 1957 and in English in 1959. Underlining the importance of a first-person, embodied experience of architecture - including its shape, color, scale, proportion, rhythm, textural effects, daylight and sound - the book may be regarded as a classic in architectural phenomenology.

Another important book was &quot;London&quot;. It was first published in Danish in 1934, in English (as &quot;London, the Unique City&quot;) in 1937. When this edition was re-issued in 1948, Rasmussen had added two Postscripts: &quot;For English readers only&quot;, and &quot;For American readers only&quot;. A shorter version was published as a paperback in 1960.

Other influential books by Rasmussen include &quot;Towns and Buildings&quot; (1951) and &quot;København&quot; (1969).

Among his many friends was Edmund N. Bacon.

==Personal life==
On 15 June 1934 he married Karen Margrethe Schrøder (12 November 1904 - 31 March 1985), daughter of economist and later Danish National Bank manager Frederik Carl Gram Schrøder og Astrid Koefoed. He is the father of the linguist Una Canger. He was a close friend of the author Karen Blixen.

==Awards and distinctions==
* 1947 Honorary Royal Designer for Industry, London
* 1973 Heinrich Tessenow Medal
* 1977 C. F. Hansen Medal

==Written works==
* &quot;London, the Unique City&quot; (1937)
* &quot;Towns and Buildings&quot; (1951)
* &quot;Experiencing Architecture&quot; (1959).

<text>Captain John Hanning Speke (4 May 1827 – 15 September 1864) was an English explorer and army officer who made three exploratory expeditions to Africa. He is most associated with the search for the source of the Nile and was the first European to reach Lake Victoria (known to locals as &quot;Nam Lolwe&quot; in Dholuo and &quot;Nnalubaale&quot; or &quot;Ukerewe&quot; in Luganda). Speke is also known for propounding the Hamitic hypothesis in 1863, in which he supposed that the Tutsi ethnic group were descendants of the biblical figure Ham, and had lighter skin and more Hamitic features than the Bantu Hutu over whom they ruled.

==Life==

Speke was born on 4 May 1827 at Orleigh Court, Buckland Brewer, near Bideford, North Devon. In 1844 he was commissioned into the Bengal Army and posted to British India, where he served in the 46th Regiment of Bengal Native Infantry under Sir Hugh Gough during the Punjab campaign and under Sir Colin Campbell during the First Anglo-Sikh War. He was promoted lieutenant in 1850 and captain in 1852. He spent his leave exploring the Himalayan Mountains and Mount Everest and once crossed into Tibet.

In 1854 he made his first voyage to Africa, first arriving in Aden to ask permission of the Political Resident of this British Outpost to cross the Gulf of Aden and collect specimens in Somalia for his family&#x27;s natural history museum in Somerset. This was refused as Somalia was considered rather dangerous. Speke then asked to join an expedition about to leave for Somalia led by the already famous Richard Burton who had Lt William Stroyan and Lt. Herne recruited to come along, but a recent death left the expedition one person short. Speke was accepted because he had traveled in remote regions alone before, had experience collecting and preserving natural history specimens and had done astronomical surveying. Initially the party split with Burton going to Harrar, Abyssinia, and Speke going to Wadi Nogal in Somalia. 

During this trip Speke experienced trouble with the local guide, who cheated him; after they returned to Aden, Burton, who had also returned, saw that the guide was punished, jailed and killed. This incident probably led to larger troubles later on. Then all four men traveled to Berbera on the coast of Somalia, from where they wanted to trek inland towards the Ogaden. While camped outside Berbera, they were attacked at night by 200 spear-wielding Somalis. During this fracas Speke ducked under the flap of a tent to get a clearer view of the scene, and Burton thought he was retreating and called for Speke to stand firm. Speke did so and then charged forward with great courage, shooting several attackers. The misunderstanding laid the foundation of their later disputes and dislikes. Stroyan was killed by a spear, Burton was seriously wounded by a javelin impaling both cheeks and Speke was wounded and captured; Herne came away unwounded. Speke was tied up and stabbed several times with spears, one thrust cutting through his thigh along his femur and exiting. Showing tremendous determination, he used his bound fists to give his attacker a facial punch; this gave him an opportunity to escape, albeit he was followed by a group of Somalis and had to dodge spears as he ran for his life. Rejoining Burton and Herne, the trio eventually managed to escape with a boat passing along the coast. The expedition was a severe financial loss, and Speke&#x27;s natural history specimens from his earlier leg were used to make up for some of it. Speke handed Burton his diaries, which Burton used as an appendix in his own book on his travels to Harrar. It seemed unlikely that the two would join again and Burton believed that he would never lead an expedition to the interior of Africa, his fervent hope, after this failed journey. Once in Aden, Burton was not granted a medical certificate to travel and thus Speke left on HMS &quot;Furious&quot; and arrived in England on 8 May 1859. Burton was not far behind and he arrived on 21 May 1859.

===Search for the Nile source 1856–1859===
In 1856, Speke and Burton went to East Africa to find the Great Lakes, which were rumoured to exist in the centre of the continent. It was hoped that the expedition would locate the source of the Nile. The journey, which started from Zanzibar Island in June 1857, where they stayed at the residence of Atkins Hamerton, the British consul, was extremely strenuous and both men fell ill from a variety of tropical diseases once they went inland. Most of the day to day work of exploration was carried out by a large, diverse, and changing labour force of porters, soldiers, and guides, and cooks. 

By 7 November 1857, they had traveled over 600 miles on foot and donkey and reached Kazeh (Tabora), where they rested and recuperated among Arab slave traders who had a settlement there. In Kazeh Burton became gravely ill and Speke went temporarily blind as they travelled further west. After an arduous journey, the two arrived in Ujiji in February 1858 and became the first Europeans to reach Lake Tanganyika (although Speke was partially blind at this point and could not properly see the lake). They decided to explore the lake, but it was vast and they could get only small canoes from the locals. Burton was too ill to journey, and thus Speke crossed the lake with a small crew and some canoes to try to rent a larger vessel from an Arab who, they were told, had a large boat and lived on the west side of the lake. (Lake Tanganyika is over 400 miles long on the north–south axis but only about 30 miles wide.) During this trip Speke, marooned on an island, suffered severely when he became temporarily deaf after a beetle crawled into his ear and he tried to remove it with a knife. Unable to rent the larger vessel from the Arab, Speke returned. The pair were unable to explore Lake Tanganyika properly and they initially misunderstood that a river flowed out of it from the north side. A few weeks later the explorer and guide Sidi Mubarak Bombay confirmed via locals that the river flowed into the lake; however, since neither man actually saw this river, this remained a source of speculation.

===Speke&#x27;s travels to Lake Victoria===
They had also heard of a second lake to the north-east, and in May 1858, they decided to explore it on the way back to the coast. But Burton was too weak to make the trip and thus stayed in base camp when the main caravan halted again at Kazeh. Speke went on a 47-day side trip that was 452 miles up and down in which he took 34 men with Bombay and Mabruki as his captains and on 30 July 1858 became the first European to see Lake Victoria, known to locals as Nam Lolwe in the Dholuo language and Nnalubaale or Ukerewe in the Luganda language. Speke renamed the lake after the British monarch, Queen Victoria, and was one of the first persons to map it. It was this lake that eventually proved to be the source of the River Nile. However, much of the expedition&#x27;s survey equipment had been lost at this point and thus vital questions about the height and extent of the lake could not be answered easily. Speke&#x27;s eyes were still bothering him and he only saw a small part of the southern end of the lake and his view was blocked by islands in the lake so he could not judge the size of the lake well. However, Speke did estimate the elevation of Lake Victoria at 4000 feet by observing the temperature at which water boiled at that level. (This lake&#x27;s being substantially higher than Lake Tanganyika did make it a more likely candidate for the source of the Nile.)

From the beginning, the relationship of Speke and Burton was one of opposites; Burton considered Speke inferior linguistically and a less experienced traveller in remote regions (which was partially true), but Burton himself appears to have been jealous and far less able to relate to the safari caravan to keep the expedition motivated and moving (a vital factor as they were completely dependent on their safari crew). While Speke enjoyed hunting and thus provided the caravan with meat, Burton was not much interested in such pursuits. Burton was appointed the head of the expedition and considered Speke the second in command, although the pair seemed to have shared the hardships and labours of the journey pretty much evenly. Once it became clear that Speke might have found the source of the Nile the relationship deteriorated further. Why Burton did not journey back to Lake Victoria with Speke to make a better reconnaissance of the Lake after Speke returned to base camp in Kazeh is unclear. Burton was incapacitated and had to be carried by bearers but this had been true for a great deal of the trip.

While Speke and Burton were instrumental in bringing the source of the Nile to the wider world and were the first to record and map this section of Africa, the efforts and labours of Sidi Mubarak Bombay and Mabruki were instrumental in the discovery of the lake. Bombay was captured as a child near Lake Nyasa by slave traders and was sold to Indian merchants on the coast of Africa who took him to Sindh. Thus he spoke Hindustani, and after his master&#x27;s death he sailed back to Zanzibar, where Speke and Burton met and hired him. Both spoke Hindustani, which greatly facilitated the travel in the interior as Bombay spoke several native languages beside Swahili. Speke was much attached to Bombay and spoke highly of his honesty and conscientiousness. Bombay&#x27;s efforts in dealing with hostile tribes, interpreting and keeping the safari crew on track, was a great help to the expedition. Less is known of Mabruki, the other caravan leader, but he was later known as Mabruki Speke, and like Bombay became one of East Africa&#x27;s great caravan leaders and was also a member of the Yao tribe like Bombay. Because of Speke&#x27;s recommendations, both Bombay and Mabruki served on Henry Stanley&#x27;s 1871 expedition to find Livingstone.

===Return to England and debate over the source of the Nile===
On 26 September 1858 the return journey from Kazeh was started with 152 porters; both men had to return as their military leaves were coming to an end, although Jeal contends that they could have extended the trip by asking for an extension, as their clear mission statement of the Royal Geographical Society (RGS) was to find the source of the Nile. The expedition had lost a great many people through desertions, disease and hostilities, but in Kazeh, on the return journey, Mabruki had recruited local porters. Again Speke and Burton suffered from severe illnesses and had to be carried in a litter (machilla) by the porters some of the way. Once Speke and Burton were back on the coast they went by ship to Zanzibar and then travelled to Aden. When back at the coast Burton had written a letter to Norton Shaw of the Royal Geographical Society (which had partially sponsored the journey) in which Burton enclosed a map of Lake Victoria made by Speke and wrote &quot;there are grave reasons for believing it (the lake) to be the source of the principal feeder of the White Nile.&quot;

Now further disagreements developed; Burton maintained that they had promised each other in Aden not to make public announcements till they both were back in England and Burton accused Speke of a breach of promise for publicly claiming that the source of the Nile was found on their trip. Burton now turned against the theory that Lake Victoria was the source of the Nile (and now said the river flowing &quot;out&quot; of the north side of Lake Tanganyika was the source) and thus also reversed himself from the position he took in the letter to Norton Shaw. In that same letter to Shaw, Burton had also stated that Speke would present his findings to the RGS, as he was prevented from traveling because of poor health and would be in England a short time after Speke. Jeal concludes that Burton&#x27;s claim of a promise from Speke not to go to the RGS was improbable. The jealousies and accusations between the two men got ever greater, further inflamed by their respective circles of friends and people who stood to gain from the feud such as book publishers and newspapers. Burton was still extremely weak, and once he appeared in front of a committee of the RGS he was not able to make a convincing case for his leading a second expedition to settle the outstanding matters about the Nile. The rift widened, and perhaps became irreversible, when Speke was chosen to lead a subsequent expedition instead of Burton. The two presented joint papers concerning the expedition to the Royal Geographical Society on 13 June 1859.

===Second journey to the source of the Nile, 1860-1861===
Together with James Augustus Grant, Speke left Portsmouth on 27 April 1860 and departed from Zanzibar in October 1860. The expedition approached the lake from the south west but Grant was often sick and was not able to travel with Speke much of the time. As during the first trip, in this period of history, Arab slave traders had created an atmosphere of great distrust towards any foreigners entering central Africa, and most tribes either fled or fought when encountering them as they assumed all outsiders to be potential slavers. Lacking a great deal of guns and soldiers, the only thing the expedition could do was make peace offerings to locals, and both men were severely delayed and their supplies depleted by demands for gifts and passage fees by smaller local chieftains. After numerous months of delays Speke reached Lake Victoria on 28 July 1862, and then travelled on the west side around Lake Victoria but only seeing it from time to time; but on the north side of the lake, Speke found the Nile flowing out of it and discovered the Ripon Falls. 
Local Church Missionary Society records indicate that Speke fathered a daughter whilst staying at the court of Muteesa I the Kabaka (or King) of Buganda. Whilst staying at the court Speke was given two girls aged about 12 and 18 from the entourage of the Queen Mother. Speke appears to have had sexual relations with both of them, before handing over the youngest (whom he named &#x27;Kahala&#x27;) to another man. Speke fell in love with the elder girl, &#x27;Meri&#x27;, according to his diaries (which were redacted when they were published as books later). While Meri proved loyal to Speke and fulfilled her task at being a &quot;wife&quot; to him as commanded by the Queen Mother, Speke was distressed because he thought she had no love or deep attachment to him. He &quot;divorced her on the spot&quot; in April 1862 after she defied his orders regarding the sacrifice of a goat. Whilst Meri visited Speke several times after this incident, the couple did not reconcile. Speke claimed to have tried to arrange a better relationship for Meri with another man, without success it seems.

Finally, given permission by Muteesa in June 1862 to leave, Speke then travelled down the Nile now reunited with Grant. Because of travel restrictions placed by the local chieftains, slave raiding parties, tribal wars and the difficulty of the terrain, Speke was not able to map the entire flow of the Nile from Lake Victoria north. Why he did not make more efforts to do so is not clear, but the enormous hardships of the journey must have played a large role. By January 1863 Speke and Grant reached Gondokoro in Southern Sudan, where he met Samuel Baker and his &quot;wife&quot;. (Her name was Florence von Sass and she had been rescued by Baker from a slave market in Vidin during a hunting trip in Bulgaria.) Speke had expected to meet John Petherick and his wife Katherine at Gondokoro, as they had been sent by the RGS south along the Nile to meet Speke and Grant. However the Pethericks were not there but on a side expedition to trade ivory, as they had run out of funds for their expedition. This caused some hard feelings between Petherick and Speke, and Baker played into this so he could assume a greater role as an explorer and co-discoverer of the Nile. Speke, via Baker&#x27;s ship, then continued to Khartoum from which he sent a celebrated telegram to London: &quot;The Nile is settled.&quot;

Speke&#x27;s expedition did not resolve the issue, however. Burton claimed that because Speke had not followed the Nile from the place it flowed out of Lake Victoria to Gondokoro, he could not be sure they were the same river.

Baker and Florence, meanwhile, stayed in Gondokoro and tried to settle the flow of the river from there to Lake Victoria by traveling south. They eventually, after tremendous hardships, such as being wracked by fevers and held up by rulers for months on end, found Lake Albert and the Murchison Falls.

==Return to London and third expedition==
Speke and Grant now returned to England, where they arrived in June 1863 and were welcomed as genuine heroes. This did not last long in Speke&#x27;s case however; disputes with Burton, who was relentless in his criticisms and a very compelling public speaker and gifted writer, left Speke&#x27;s discoveries in less than an ideal light. Speke had also committed to write a book for John Blackwood which he found hard and time-consuming as he was not naturally a gifted writer. He failed to give a good and full report to the RGS for many months and thus in effect was not defending his positions of discovery. In addition Speke had a public dispute with the Pethericks who had by and large acted according to their RGS instructions but Speke had felt they had not. 

All this led Roderick Murchison, president of the Royal Geographical Society, to start disliking Speke and a third expedition, led by Speke, was becoming less likely as it would have to be funded by the people Speke was now not on good terms with. It appears that just as Burton had overplayed his hand after the first trip Speke now did the same. Now the RGS asked that a public debate should be held between Speke and Burton to try and settle the Nile&#x27;s source.

==Death==
A debate was planned between Speke and Burton before the geographical section of the British Association in Bath on 16 September 1864, but Speke had died the previous afternoon from a possibly self-inflicted gunshot wound while shooting at Neston Park in Wiltshire. A contemporary account of the events surrounding his death appeared in &quot;The Times&quot;:
An inquest concluded that the death was accidental, a conclusion supported by his only biographer Alexander Maitland, though the idea of suicide has appealed to some. Bearing in mind, however, that the fatal wound was just below Speke&#x27;s armpit, suicide seems most unlikely. Burton, however, could not set aside his own strong dislike of Speke and was vocal in spreading the idea of a suicide, claiming that Speke feared the debate. Speke was buried in St Andrew&#x27;s Church, Dowlish Wake in Somerset, five miles away from the ancestral home of the Speke family.

==Source of the Nile is settled, 1874–1877==
In 1874–1877, Henry Stanley mounted a new expedition and took a boat along the entire shore of Lake Victoria; he established that Lake Tanganyika and the Nile were not connected in any way, and he explored the headwaters of Lake Edward. It was now proven that Speke had been right all along, and that the Nile flowed from Lake Victoria via Ripon Falls and Murchison Falls to Lake Albert and from there to Gondokoro.

According to other theories, the source of the White Nile, even after centuries of exploration, remains in dispute. The most remote source that is indisputably a source for the White Nile is the Kagera River, which was explored by German explorer Oscar Baumann, and geographically determined in 1937 by Burkhart Waldecker; however, the Kagera has tributaries that are in contention for the farthest source of the White Nile.

===Scientific works===

Much of Speke&#x27;s &quot;Journal of the Discovery of the Source of the Nile&quot; is a description of the physical features of Africa&#x27;s races, in whose condition he found &quot;a strikingly existing proof of the Holy Scriptures.&quot; Living alongside the locals, Speke claimed to have found a &quot;superior race&quot; of &quot;men who were as unlike as they could be from the common order of the natives&quot; due to their &quot;fine oval faces, large eyes, and high noses, denoting the best blood of Abyssinia&quot; –; that is, Ethiopia. This &quot;race&quot; comprised many tribes, including the Watusi (Tutsi). Speke described their physical appearances as having retaineddespite the hair-curling and skin-darkening effects of intermarriage&quot;a high stamp of Asiatic feature, of which a marked characteristic is a bridged instead of bridgeless nose&quot;.

==Legacy==
===Eponyms===
Two species of African reptiles are named in his honour: Speke&#x27;s hinge-back tortoise, &quot;Kinixys spekii&quot;; and Speke&#x27;s sand lizard, &quot;Heliobolus spekii&quot;. Three species of African mammals are named in his honour: the sitatunga, &quot;Tragelaphus spekii&quot;; Speke&#x27;s gazelle, &quot;Gazella spekei&quot;; and Speke&#x27;s pectinator, &quot;Pectinator spekei&quot;. Some streets and avenues in South Africa and Zimbabwe were named after him. The bar at the five-star Sonesta hotel in Nasr City, Cairo, was named after him when it opened in 1982; the then-manager came from the same town as Speke.

===Film===
*The BBC miniseries &quot;The Search for the Nile&quot; (1971) tells the story of the Nile expeditions during the second half of the 19th century in a detailed way.
*The film &quot;Mountains of the Moon&quot; (1990), starring Scottish actor Iain Glen as Speke, related the story of the Burton-Speke controversy, portrayed as having been unjustifiably incited by Speke&#x27;s publisher to stimulate book sales.

===Fiction===
William Boyd presents a portrait of Speke in a fictional reimagining of the search for the source of the Nile in his 2022 novel, &quot;The Romantic&quot;.

<doc id="76084" wikidata="Q187868" url="?curid=76084" title="Potentiometer">
<text>A potentiometer is a three-terminal resistor with a sliding or rotating contact that forms an adjustable voltage divider. If only two terminals are used, one end and the wiper, it acts as a variable resistor or rheostat.

The measuring instrument called a potentiometer is essentially a voltage divider used for measuring electric potential (voltage); the component is an implementation of the same principle, hence its name.

Potentiometers are commonly used to control electrical devices such as volume controls on audio equipment. It is also used in speed control of fans. Potentiometers operated by a mechanism can be used as position transducers, for example, in a joystick. Potentiometers are rarely used to directly control significant power (more than a watt), since the power dissipated in the potentiometer would be comparable to the power in the controlled load.

==Nomenclature==
Some terms in the electronics industry used to describe certain types of potentiometers are:

* Pot: abbreviation for potentiometer.
* Slide pot or slider pot: a potentiometer that is adjusted by sliding the wiper left or right (or up and down, depending on the installation), usually with a finger or thumb
* thumb pot or thumbwheel pot: a small rotating potentiometer meant to be adjusted infrequently by means of a small thumbwheel
* trimpot or trimmer pot: a trimmer potentiometer typically meant to be adjusted once or infrequently for &quot;fine-tuning&quot; an electrical signal

== Construction ==

Potentiometers consist of a resistive element, a sliding contact (wiper) that moves along the element, making good electrical contact with one part of it, electrical terminals at each end of the element, a mechanism that moves the wiper from one end to the other, and a housing containing the element and wiper.

Many inexpensive potentiometers are constructed with a resistive element (B in cutaway drawing) formed into an arc of a circle usually a little less than a full turn and a wiper (C) sliding on this element when rotated, making electrical contact. The resistive element can be flat or angled. Each end of the resistive element is connected to a terminal (E, G) on the case. The wiper is connected to a third terminal (F), usually between the other two. On panel potentiometers, the wiper is usually the center terminal of three. For single-turn potentiometers, this wiper typically travels just under one revolution around the contact. The only point of ingress for contamination is the narrow space between the shaft and the housing it rotates in.

Another type is the linear slider potentiometer, which has a wiper which slides along a linear element instead of rotating. Contamination can potentially enter anywhere along the slot the slider moves in, making effective sealing more difficult and compromising long-term reliability. An advantage of the slider potentiometer is that the slider position gives a visual indication of its setting. While the setting of a rotary potentiometer can be seen by the position of a marking on the knob, an array of sliders can give a visual impression of settings as in a graphic equalizer or faders on a mixing console.

The resistive element of inexpensive potentiometers is often made of graphite. Other materials used include resistance wire, carbon particles in plastic, and a ceramic/metal mixture called cermet.

Conductive track potentiometers use conductive polymer resistor pastes that contain hard-wearing resins and polymers, solvents, and lubricant, in addition to the carbon that provides the conductive properties.

Multiturn potentiometers are also operated by rotating a shaft, but by several turns rather than less than a full turn. Some multiturn potentiometers have a linear resistive element with a sliding contact moved by a lead screw; others have a helical resistive element and a wiper that turns through 10, 20, or more complete revolutions, moving along the helix as it rotates. Multiturn potentiometers, both user-accessible and preset, allow finer adjustments; rotation through the same angle changes the setting by typically a tenth as much as for a simple rotary potentiometer.

A string potentiometer is a multi-turn potentiometer operated by an attached reel of wire turning against a spring, allowing it to convert linear position to a variable resistance.

User-accessible rotary potentiometers can be fitted with a switch which operates usually at the anti-clockwise extreme of rotation. Before digital electronics became the norm such a component was used to allow radio and television receivers and other equipment to be switched on at minimum volume with an audible click, then the volume increased by turning the same knob. Multiple resistance elements can be ganged together with their sliding contacts on the same shaft, for example in stereo audio amplifiers for volume control. In other applications, such as domestic light dimmers, the normal usage pattern is best satisfied if the potentiometer remains set at its current position, so the switch is operated by a push action, alternately on and off, by axial presses of the knob.

Other potentiometers are enclosed within the equipment and are intended to only be adjusted when calibrating the equipment during manufacture or repair, and not otherwise touched. They are usually physically much smaller than user-accessible potentiometers, and may need to be operated by a screwdriver rather than having a knob. They are usually called &quot;trimmer&quot;, &quot;trim[ming]&quot;, or &quot;preset&quot; potentiometers (or pots), or the genericized brand name &quot;trimpot&quot;.

=== Resistance–position relationship: &quot;taper&quot; ===
The relationship between slider position and resistance, known as the &quot;taper&quot; or &quot;law&quot;, can be controlled during manufacture by changing the composition or thickness of the resistance coating along the resistance element. Although in principle any taper is possible, two types are widely manufactured: linear and logarithmic (aka &quot;audio taper&quot;) potentiometers.

A letter code may be used to identify which taper is used, but the letter code definitions are not standardized. Potentiometers made in Asia and the US are usually marked with an &quot;A&quot; for logarithmic taper or a &quot;B&quot; for linear taper; &quot;C&quot; for the rarely seen reverse logarithmic taper. Others, particularly those from Europe, may be marked with an &quot;A&quot; for linear taper, a &quot;C&quot; or &quot;B&quot; for logarithmic taper, or an &quot;F&quot; for reverse logarithmic taper. The code used also varies between different manufacturers. When a percentage is referenced with a non-linear taper, it relates to the resistance value at the midpoint of the shaft rotation. A 10% log taper would therefore measure 10% of the total resistance at the midpoint of the rotation; i.e. 10% log taper on a 10 kOhm potentiometer would yield 1 kOhm at the midpoint. The higher the percentage, the steeper the log curve.

==== Linear taper potentiometer ====
A &quot;linear taper potentiometer&quot; (&quot;linear&quot; describes the electrical characteristic of the device, not the geometry of the resistive element) has a resistive element of constant cross-section, resulting in a device where the resistance between the contact (wiper) and one end terminal is proportional to the distance between them. Linear taper potentiometers are used when the division ratio of the potentiometer must be proportional to the angle of shaft rotation (or slider position), for example, controls used for adjusting the centering of the display on an analog cathode-ray oscilloscope. Precision potentiometers have an accurate relationship between resistance and slider position. 

==== Logarithmic potentiometer ====
A &quot;logarithmic taper potentiometer&quot; is a potentiometer that has a bias built into the resistive element. Basically this means the center position of the potentiometer is not one half of the total value of the potentiometer. The resistive element is designed to follow a logarithmic taper, aka a mathematical exponent or &quot;squared&quot; profile.
A logarithmic taper potentiometer is constructed with a resistive element that either &quot;tapers&quot; in from one end to the other, or is made from a material whose resistivity varies from one end to the other. This results in a device where output voltage is a logarithmic function of the slider position.

Most (cheaper) &quot;log&quot; potentiometers are not accurately logarithmic, but use two regions of different resistance (but constant resistivity) to approximate a logarithmic law. The two resistive tracks overlap at approximately 50% of the potentiometer rotation; this gives a stepwise logarithmic taper. A logarithmic potentiometer can also be simulated with a linear one and an external resistor. True logarithmic potentiometers are significantly more expensive.

Logarithmic taper potentiometers are often used for volume or signal level in audio systems, as human perception of audio volume is logarithmic, according to the Weber–Fechner law.

==== Contactless potentiometer ====
Unlike mechanical potentiometers, &quot;non-contact potentiometers&quot; use an optical disk to trigger an infrared sensor, or a magnet to trigger a magnetic sensor (as long as there are other types of sensors, such as capacitive, other types of non-contact potentiometers can probably be built), and then an electronic circuit does the signal processing to provide an output signal that can be analogue or digital.

An example of a non-contact potentiometer can be found with the AS5600 integrated circuit. However, absolute encoders must also use similar principles, although being for industrial use, certainly the cost must be unfeasible for use in domestic appliances.

== Rheostat ==

The most common way to vary the resistance in a circuit continuously is to use a rheostat. Because of the change in resistance, they can also be used to adjust magnitude of current in a circuit. The word &quot;rheostat&quot; was coined in 1843 by Sir Charles Wheatstone, from the Greek &quot;rheos&quot; meaning &quot;stream&quot;, and - -&quot;states&quot; (from &quot;histanai&quot;, &quot;to set, to cause to stand&quot;) meaning &quot;setter, regulating device&quot;, which is a two-terminal variable resistor. For low-power applications (less than about 1 watt) a three-terminal potentiometer is often used, with one terminal unconnected or connected to the wiper.

Where the rheostat must be rated for higher power (more than about 1 watt), it may be built with a resistance wire wound around a semi-circular insulator, with the wiper sliding from one turn of the wire to the next. Sometimes a rheostat is made from resistance wire wound on a heat-resisting cylinder, with the slider made from a number of metal fingers that grip lightly onto a small portion of the turns of resistance wire. The &quot;fingers&quot; can be moved along the coil of resistance wire by a sliding knob thus changing the &quot;tapping&quot; point. Wire-wound rheostats made with ratings up to several thousand watts are used in applications such as DC motor drives, electric welding controls, or in the controls for generators. The rating of the rheostat is given with the full resistance value and the allowable power dissipation is proportional to the fraction of the total device resistance in circuit. Carbon-pile rheostats are used as load banks for testing automobile batteries and power supplies.

== Digital potentiometer ==

A digital potentiometer (often called digipot) is an electronic component that mimics the functions of analog potentiometers. Through digital input signals, the resistance between two terminals can be adjusted, just as in an analog potentiometer. There are two main functional types: volatile, which lose their set position if power is removed, and are usually designed to initialise at the minimum position, and non-volatile, which retain their set position using a storage mechanism similar to flash memory or EEPROM.

Usage of a digipot is far more complex than that of a simple mechanical potentiometer, and there are many limitations to observe; nevertheless they are widely used, often for factory adjustment and calibration of equipment, especially where the limitations of mechanical potentiometers are problematic. A digipot is generally immune to the effects of moderate long-term mechanical vibration or environmental contamination, to the same extent as other semiconductor devices, and can be secured electronically against unauthorised tampering by protecting the access to its programming inputs by various means.

In equipment which has a microprocessor, FPGA or other functional logic which can store settings and reload them to the &quot;potentiometer&quot; every time the equipment is powered up, a multiplying DAC can be used in place of a digipot, and this can offer higher setting resolution, less drift with temperature, and more operational flexibility.

== Membrane potentiometers ==
A membrane potentiometer uses a conductive membrane that is deformed by a sliding element to contact a resistor voltage divider. Linearity can range from 0.50% to 5% depending on the material, design and manufacturing process. The repeat accuracy is typically between 0.1 mm and 1.0 mm with a theoretically infinite resolution. The service life of these types of potentiometers is typically 1 million to 20 million cycles depending on the materials used during manufacturing and the actuation method; contact and contactless (magnetic) methods are available (to sense position). Many different material variations are available such as PET, FR4, and Kapton. Membrane potentiometer manufacturers offer linear, rotary, and application-specific variations. The linear versions can range from 9 mm to 1000 mm in length and the rotary versions range from 20 to 450 mm in diameter, with each having a height of 0.5 mm. Membrane potentiometers can be used for position sensing.

For touch-screen devices using resistive technology, a two-dimensional membrane potentiometer provides x and y coordinates. The top layer is thin glass spaced close to a neighboring inner layer. The underside of the top layer has a transparent conductive coating; the surface of the layer beneath it has a transparent resistive coating. A finger or stylus deforms the glass to contact the underlying layer. Edges of the resistive layer have conductive contacts.
Locating the contact point is done by applying a voltage to opposite edges, leaving the other two edges temporarily unconnected. The voltage of the top layer provides one coordinate. Disconnecting those two edges, and applying voltage to the other two, formerly unconnected, provides the other coordinate. Alternating rapidly between pairs of edges provides frequent position updates. An analog-to-digital converter provides output data.

Advantages of such sensors are that only five connections to the sensor are needed, and the associated electronics is comparatively simple. Another is that any material that depresses the top layer over a small area works well. A disadvantage is that sufficient force must be applied to make contact. Another is that the sensor requires occasional calibration to match touch location to the underlying display. (Capacitive sensors require no calibration or contact force, only proximity of a finger or other conductive object. However, they are significantly more complex.)

== Applications ==
Potentiometers are rarely used to directly control significant amounts of power (more than a watt or so). Instead they are used to adjust the level of analog signals (for example volume controls audio equipment), and as control inputs for electronic circuits. For example, a light dimmer uses a potentiometer to control the switching of a TRIAC and so indirectly to control the brightness of lamps.

Preset potentiometers are widely used throughout electronics wherever adjustments must be made during manufacturing or servicing.

User-actuated potentiometers are widely used as user controls, and may control a very wide variety of equipment functions. The widespread use of potentiometers in consumer electronics declined in the 1990s, with rotary incremental encoders, up/down push-buttons, and other digital controls now more common. However they remain in many applications, such as volume controls and as position sensors.

=== Audio control ===
Low-power potentiometers, both slide and rotary, are used to control audio equipment, changing loudness, frequency attenuation, and other characteristics of audio signals.

The &#x27;log pot&#x27;, that is, a potentiometer has a resistance, taper, or, &quot;curve&quot; (or law) of a logarithmic (log) form, is used as the volume control in audio power amplifiers, where it is also called an &quot;audio taper pot&quot;, because the amplitude response of the human ear is approximately logarithmic. It ensures that on a volume control marked 0 to 10, for example, a setting of 5 sounds subjectively half as loud as a setting of 10. There is also an &quot;anti-log pot&quot; or &quot;reverse audio taper&quot; which is simply the reverse of a logarithmic potentiometer. It is almost always used in a ganged configuration with a logarithmic potentiometer, for instance, in an audio balance control.

Potentiometers used in combination with filter networks act as tone controls or equalizers.

In audio systems, the word linear, is sometimes applied in a confusing way to describe slide potentiometers because of the straight line nature of the physical sliding motion. The word linear when applied to a potentiometer regardless of being a slide or rotary type, describes a linear relationship of the pot&#x27;s position versus the measured value of the pot&#x27;s tap (wiper or electrical output) pin.

=== Television ===
Potentiometers were formerly used to control picture brightness, contrast, and color response. A potentiometer was often used to adjust &quot;vertical hold&quot;, which affected the synchronization between the receiver&#x27;s internal sweep circuit (sometimes a multivibrator) and the received picture signal, along with other things such as audio-video carrier offset, tuning frequency (for push-button sets) and so on. It also helps in frequency modulation of waves.

=== Motion control ===
Potentiometers can be used as position feedback devices in order to create closed-loop control, such as in a servomechanism. This method of motion control is the simplest method of measuring the angle or displacement.

=== Transducers ===
Potentiometers are also very widely used as a part of displacement transducers because of the simplicity of construction and because they can give a large output signal.

===Computation===
In analog computers, high precision potentiometers are used to scale intermediate results by desired constant factors, or to set initial conditions for a calculation. A motor-driven potentiometer may be used as a function generator, using a non-linear resistance card to supply approximations to trigonometric functions. For example, the shaft rotation might represent an angle, and the voltage division ratio can be made proportional to the cosine of the angle.

== Theory of operation ==
The potentiometer can be used as a voltage divider to obtain a manually adjustable output voltage at the slider (wiper) from a fixed input voltage applied across the two ends of the potentiometer. This is their most common use.

The voltage across can be calculated by:
formula_1

If is large compared to the other resistances (like the input to an operational amplifier), the output voltage can be approximated by the simpler equation:
formula_2
(dividing throughout by and cancelling terms with as denominator)

As an example, assume formula_3, formula_4, formula_5, and formula_6

Since the load resistance is large compared to the other resistances, the output voltage will be approximately:
formula_7

Because of the load resistance, however, it will actually be slightly lower: .

One of the advantages of the potential divider compared to a variable resistor in series with the source is that, while variable resistors have a maximum resistance where some current will always flow, dividers are able to vary the output voltage from maximum () to ground (zero volts) as the wiper moves from one end of the potentiometer to the other. There is, however, always a small amount of contact resistance.

In addition, the load resistance is often not known and therefore simply placing a variable resistor in series with the load could have a negligible effect or an excessive effect, depending on the load.

== Failure ==
Ageing may cause intermittent contact between the resistive track and the wiper as it is rotated. In volume control use this causes crackling.

<text>An electric motor is a machine that converts electrical energy into mechanical energy. Most electric motors operate through the interaction between the motor&#x27;s magnetic field and electric current in a wire winding to generate force in the form of torque applied on the motor&#x27;s shaft. An electric generator is mechanically identical to an electric motor, but operates in reverse, converting mechanical energy into electrical energy.

Electric motors can be powered by direct current (DC) sources, such as from batteries or rectifiers, or by alternating current (AC) sources, such as a power grid, inverters or electrical generators.

Electric motors may be classified by considerations such as power source type, construction, application and type of motion output. They can be brushed or brushless, single-phase, two-phase, or three-phase, axial or radial flux, and may be air-cooled or liquid-cooled.

Standardized motors provide power for industrial use. The largest are used for ship propulsion, pipeline compression and pumped-storage applications, with output exceeding 100 megawatts.

Applications include industrial fans, blowers and pumps, machine tools, household appliances, power tools, vehicles, and disk drives. Small motors may be found in electric watches. In certain applications, such as in regenerative braking with traction motors, electric motors can be used in reverse as generators to recover energy that might otherwise be lost as heat and friction.

Electric motors produce linear or rotary force (torque) intended to propel some external mechanism. This makes them a type of actuator. They are generally designed for continuous rotation, or for linear movement over a significant distance compared to its size. Solenoids also convert electrical power to mechanical motion, but over only a limited distance.

==Components==
An electric motor has two mechanical parts: the rotor, which moves, and the stator, which does not. Electrically, the motor consists of two parts, the field magnets and the armature, one of which is attached to the rotor and the other to the stator. Together they form a magnetic circuit. The magnets create a magnetic field that passes through the armature. These can be electromagnets or permanent magnets. The field magnet is usually on the stator and the armature on the rotor, but these may be reversed.

===Rotor===
The rotor is the moving part that delivers the mechanical power. The rotor typically holds conductors that carry currents, on which the magnetic field of the stator exerts force to turn the shaft.

===Stator===
The stator surrounds the rotor, and usually holds field magnets, which are either electromagnets (wire windings around a ferromagnetic iron core) or permanent magnets. These create a magnetic field that passes through the rotor armature, exerting force on the rotor windings. The stator core is made up of many thin metal sheets that are insulated from each other, called laminations. These laminations are made of electrical steel, which has a specified magnetic permeability, hysteresis, and saturation. Laminations reduce losses that would result from induced circulating eddy currents that would flow if a solid core were used. Mains powered AC motors typically immobilize the wires within the windings by impregnating them with varnish in a vacuum. This prevents the wires in the winding from vibrating against each other which would abrade the wire insulation and cause premature failures. Resin-packed motors, used in deep well submersible pumps, washing machines, and air conditioners, encapsulate the stator in plastic resin to prevent corrosion and/or reduce conducted noise.

=== Gap ===
An air gap between the stator and rotor allows it to turn. The width of the gap has a significant effect on the motor&#x27;s electrical characteristics. It is generally made as small as possible, as a large gap weakens performance. Conversely, gaps that are too small may create friction in addition to noise.

===Armature===

The armature consists of wire windings on a ferromagnetic core. Electric current passing through the wire causes the magnetic field to exert a force (Lorentz force) on it, turning the rotor. Windings are coiled wires, wrapped around a laminated, soft, iron, ferromagnetic core so as to form magnetic poles when energized with current.

Electric machines come in salient- and nonsalient-pole configurations. In a salient-pole motor the rotor and stator ferromagnetic cores have projections called poles that face each other. Wire is wound around each pole below the pole face, which become north or south poles when current flows through the wire. In a nonsalient-pole (distributed field or round-rotor) motor, the ferromagnetic core is a smooth cylinder, with the windings distributed evenly in slots around the circumference. Supplying alternating current in the windings creates poles in the core that rotate continuously. A shaded-pole motor has a winding around part of the pole that delays the phase of the magnetic field for that pole.

===Commutator===

A commutator is a rotary electrical switch that supplies current to the rotor. It periodically reverses the flow of current in the rotor windings as the shaft rotates. It consists of a cylinder composed of multiple metal contact segments on the armature. Two or more electrical contacts called &quot;brushes&quot; made of a soft conductive material like carbon press against the commutator. The brushes make sliding contact with successive commutator segments as the rotator turns, supplying current to the rotor. The windings on the rotor are connected to the commutator segments. The commutator reverses the current direction in the rotor windings with each half turn (180°), so the torque applied to the rotor is always in the same direction. Without this reversal, the direction of torque on each rotor winding would reverse with each half turn, stopping the rotor. Commutated motors have been mostly replaced by brushless motors, permanent magnet motors, and induction motors.

=== Shaft ===
The motor shaft extends outside of the motor, where it satisfies the load. Because the forces of the load are exerted beyond the outermost bearing, the load is said to be overhung.

===Bearings===
The rotor is supported by bearings, which allow the rotor to turn on its axis by transferring the force of axial and radial loads from the shaft to the motor housing.

==History==
===Early motors===
Before modern electromagnetic motors, experimental motors that worked by electrostatic force were investigated. The first electric motors were simple electrostatic devices described in experiments by Scottish monk Andrew Gordon and American experimenter Benjamin Franklin in the 1740s. The theoretical principle behind them, Coulomb&#x27;s law, was discovered but not published, by Henry Cavendish in 1771. This law was discovered independently by Charles-Augustin de Coulomb in 1785, who published it so that it is now known by his name. Due to the difficulty of generating the high voltages they required, electrostatic motors were never used for practical purposes.

The invention of the electrochemical battery by Alessandro Volta in 1799 made the production of persistent electric currents possible. Hans Christian Ørsted discovered in 1820 that an electric current creates a magnetic field, which can exert a force on a magnet. It only took a few weeks for André-Marie Ampère to develop the first formulation of the electromagnetic interaction and present the Ampère&#x27;s force law, that described the production of mechanical force by the interaction of an electric current and a magnetic field.

Michael Faraday gave the first demonstration of the effect with a rotary motion on 3 September 1821 in the basement of the Royal Institution. A free-hanging wire was dipped into a pool of mercury, on which a permanent magnet (PM) was placed. When a current was passed through the wire, the wire rotated around the magnet, showing that the current gave rise to a close circular magnetic field around the wire. Faraday published the results of his discovery in the &quot;Quarterly Journal of Science&quot;, and sent copies of his paper along with pocket-sized models of his device to colleagues around the world so they could also witness the phenomenon of electromagnetic rotations. This motor is often demonstrated in physics experiments, substituting brine for (toxic) mercury. Barlow&#x27;s wheel was an early refinement to this Faraday demonstration, although these and similar homopolar motors remained unsuited to practical application until late in the century.

In 1827, Hungarian physicist Ányos Jedlik started experimenting with electromagnetic coils. After Jedlik solved the technical problems of continuous rotation with the invention of the commutator, he called his early devices &quot;electromagnetic self-rotors&quot;. Although they were used only for teaching, in 1828 Jedlik demonstrated the first device to contain the three main components of practical DC motors: the stator, rotor and commutator. The device employed no permanent magnets, as the magnetic fields of both the stationary and revolving components were produced solely by the currents flowing through their windings.

===DC motors===

The first commutator capable of turning machinery was invented by English scientist William Sturgeon in 1832. Following Sturgeon&#x27;s work, a commutator-type direct-current electric motor was built by American inventors Thomas Davenport and Emily Davenport, which he patented in 1837. The motors ran at up to 600 revolutions per minute, and powered machine tools and a printing press. Due to the high cost of primary battery power, the motors were commercially unsuccessful and bankrupted the Davenports. Several inventors followed Sturgeon in the development of DC motors, but all encountered the same battery cost issues. As no electricity distribution system was available at the time, no practical commercial market emerged for these motors.

After many other more or less successful attempts with relatively weak rotating and reciprocating apparatus Prussian/Russian Moritz von Jacobi created the first real rotating electric motor in May 1834. It developed remarkable mechanical output power. His motor set a world record, which Jacobi improved four years later in September 1838. His second motor was powerful enough to drive a boat with 14 people across a wide river. It was also in 1839/40 that other developers managed to build motors with similar and then higher performance.

In 1827–1828, Jedlik built a device using similar principles to those used in his electromagnetic self-rotors that was capable of useful work. He built a model electric vehicle that same year.

A major turning point came in 1864, when Antonio Pacinotti first described the ring armature (although initially conceived in a DC generator, i.e. a dynamo). This featured symmetrically grouped coils closed upon themselves and connected to the bars of a commutator, the brushes of which delivered practically non-fluctuating current. The first commercially successful DC motors followed the developments by Zénobe Gramme who, in 1871, reinvented Pacinotti&#x27;s design and adopted some solutions by Werner Siemens.

A benefit to DC machines came from the discovery of the reversibility of the electric machine, which was announced by Siemens in 1867 and observed by Pacinotti in 1869. Gramme accidentally demonstrated it on the occasion of the 1873 Vienna World&#x27;s Fair, when he connected two such DC devices up to 2 km from each other, using one of them as a generator and the other as motor.

The drum rotor was introduced by Friedrich von Hefner-Alteneck of Siemens &amp; Halske to replace Pacinotti&#x27;s ring armature in 1872, thus improving the machine efficiency. The laminated rotor was introduced by Siemens &amp; Halske the following year, achieving reduced iron losses and increased induced voltages. In 1880, Jonas Wenström provided the rotor with slots for housing the winding, further increasing the efficiency.

In 1886, Frank Julian Sprague invented the first practical DC motor, a non-sparking device that maintained relatively constant speed under variable loads. Other Sprague electric inventions about this time greatly improved grid electric distribution (prior work done while employed by Thomas Edison), allowed power from electric motors to be returned to the electric grid, provided for electric distribution to trolleys via overhead wires and the trolley pole, and provided control systems for electric operations. This allowed Sprague to use electric motors to invent the first electric trolley system in 1887–88 in Richmond, Virginia, the electric elevator and control system in 1892, and the electric subway with independently powered centrally-controlled cars. The latter were first installed in 1892 in Chicago by the South Side Elevated Railroad, where it became popularly known as the &quot;L&quot;. Sprague&#x27;s motor and related inventions led to an explosion of interest and use in electric motors for industry. The development of electric motors of acceptable efficiency was delayed for several decades by failure to recognize the extreme importance of an air gap between the rotor and stator. Efficient designs have a comparatively small air gap. The St. Louis motor, long used in classrooms to illustrate motor principles, is inefficient for the same reason, as well as appearing nothing like a modern motor.

Electric motors revolutionized industry. Industrial processes were no longer limited by power transmission using line shafts, belts, compressed air or hydraulic pressure. Instead, every machine could be equipped with its own power source, providing easy control at the point of use, and improving power transmission efficiency. Electric motors applied in agriculture eliminated human and animal muscle power from such tasks as handling grain or pumping water. Household uses (sauch as washing machines, dishwashers, fans, air conditioners and refrigerators) of electric motors reduced heavy labor in the home and made higher standards of convenience, comfort and safety possible. Today, electric motors consume more than half of the electric energy produced in the US.

===AC motors===

In 1824, French physicist François Arago formulated the existence of rotating magnetic fields, termed Arago&#x27;s rotations, which, by manually turning switches on and off, Walter Baily demonstrated in 1879 as in effect the first primitive induction motor. In the 1880s many inventors were trying to develop workable AC motors because AC&#x27;s advantages in long-distance high-voltage transmission were offset by the inability to operate motors on AC.

The first alternating-current commutatorless induction motor was invented by Galileo Ferraris in 1885. Ferraris was able to improve his first design by producing more advanced setups in 1886. In 1888, the &quot;Royal Academy of Science of Turin&quot; published Ferraris&#x27;s research detailing the foundations of motor operation, while concluding at that time that &quot;the apparatus based on that principle could not be of any commercial importance as motor.&quot;

Possible industrial development was envisioned by Nikola Tesla, who invented independently his induction motor in 1887 and obtained a patent in May 1888. In the same year, Tesla presented his paper &quot;A New System of Alternate Current Motors and Transformers&quot; to the AIEE that described three patented two-phase four-stator-pole motor types: one with a four-pole rotor forming a non-self-starting reluctance motor, another with a wound rotor forming a self-starting induction motor, and the third a true synchronous motor with separately excited DC supply to rotor winding. One of the patents Tesla filed in 1887, however, also described a shorted-winding-rotor induction motor. George Westinghouse, who had already acquired rights from Ferraris (US$1,000), promptly bought Tesla&#x27;s patents (US$60,000 plus US$2.50 per sold hp, paid until 1897), employed Tesla to develop his motors, and assigned C.F. Scott to help Tesla; however, Tesla left for other pursuits in 1889. The constant speed AC induction motor was found not to be suitable for street cars, but Westinghouse engineers successfully adapted it to power a mining operation in Telluride, Colorado in 1891. Westinghouse achieved its first practical induction motor in 1892 and developed a line of polyphase 60 hertz induction motors in 1893, but these early Westinghouse motors were two-phase motors with wound rotors. B.G. Lamme later developed a rotating bar winding rotor.

Steadfast in his promotion of three-phase development, Mikhail Dolivo-Dobrovolsky invented the three-phase induction motor in 1889, of both types cage-rotor and wound rotor with a starting rheostat, and the three-limb transformer in 1890. After an agreement between AEG and Maschinenfabrik Oerlikon, Doliwo-Dobrowolski and Charles Eugene Lancelot Brown developed larger models, namely a 20-hp squirrel cage and a 100-hp wound rotor with a starting rheostat. These were the first three-phase asynchronous motors suitable for practical operation. Since 1889, similar developments of three-phase machinery were started Wenström. At the 1891 Frankfurt International Electrotechnical Exhibition, the first long distance three-phase system was successfully presented. It was rated 15 kV and extended over 175 km from the Lauffen waterfall on the Neckar river. The Lauffen power station included a 240 kW 86 V 40 Hz alternator and a step-up transformer while at the exhibition a step-down transformer fed a 100-hp three-phase induction motor that powered an artificial waterfall, representing the transfer of the original power source. The three-phase induction is now used for the vast majority of commercial applications. Mikhail Dolivo-Dobrovolsky claimed that Tesla&#x27;s motor was not practical because of two-phase pulsations, which prompted him to persist in his three-phase work.

The General Electric Company began developing three-phase induction motors in 1891. By 1896, General Electric and Westinghouse signed a cross-licensing agreement for the bar-winding-rotor design, later called the squirrel-cage rotor. Induction motor improvements flowing from these inventions and innovations were such that a 100-horsepower induction motor currently has the same mounting dimensions as a 7.5-horsepower motor in 1897.

=== Twenty-first century ===
In 2022, electric motor sales were estimated to be 800 million units, increasing by 10% annually. Electric motors consume ≈50% of the world&#x27;s electricity. Since the 1980s, the market share of DC motors has declined in favor of AC motors.

==Inputs==
===Power supply===
A DC motor is usually supplied through a split ring commutator as described above.

AC motors&#x27; commutation can be achieved using either a slip ring commutator or external commutation. It can be fixed-speed or variable-speed control type, and can be synchronous or asynchronous. Universal motors can run on either AC or DC.

===Control===
DC motors can be operated at variable speeds by adjusting the voltage applied to the terminals or by using pulse-width modulation (PWM).

AC motors operated at a fixed speed are generally powered directly from the grid or through motor soft starters.

AC motors operated at variable speeds are powered with various power inverter, variable-frequency drive or electronic commutator technologies.

The term electronic commutator is usually associated with self-commutated brushless DC motor and switched reluctance motor applications.

==Types==
Electric motors operate on one of three physical principles: magnetism, electrostatics and piezoelectricity.

In magnetic motors, magnetic fields are formed in both the rotor and the stator. The product between these two fields gives rise to a force and thus a torque on the motor shaft. One or both of these fields changes as the rotor turns. This is done by switching the poles on and off at the right time, or varying the strength of the pole.

Motors can be designed to operate on DC current, on AC current, or some types can work on either. 

AC motors can be either asynchronous or synchronous. Synchronous motors require the rotor to turn at the same speed as the stator&#x27;s rotating field. Asynchronous rotors relax this constraint.

A fractional-horsepower motor either has a rating below about 1 horsepower (0.746 kW), or is manufactured with a frame size smaller than a standard 1 HP motor. Many household and industrial motors are in the fractional-horsepower class.

Notes:

1. Rotation is independent of the frequency of the AC voltage.

2. Rotation is equal to synchronous speed (motor-stator-field speed).

3. In SCIM, fixed-speed operation rotation is equal to synchronous speed, less slip speed.

4. In non-slip energy-recovery systems, WRIM is usually used for motor-starting but can be used to vary load speed.

5. Variable-speed operation.

6. Whereas induction- and synchronous-motor drives are typically with either six-step or sinusoidal-waveform output, BLDC-motor drives are usually with trapezoidal-current waveform; the behavior of both sinusoidal and trapezoidal PM machines is, however, identical in terms of their fundamental aspects.

7. In variable-speed operation, WRIM is used in slip-energy recovery and double-fed induction-machine applications.

8. A cage winding is a short-circuited squirrel-cage rotor, a wound winding is connected externally through slip rings.

9. Mostly single-phase with some three-phase.

==Self-commutated motor==
===Brushed DC motor===

Most DC motors are small permanent magnet (PM) types. They contain a brushed internal mechanical commutation to reverse motor windings&#x27; current in synchronism with rotation.

====Electrically excited DC motor====
A commutated DC motor has a set of rotating windings wound on an armature mounted on a rotating shaft. The shaft also carries the commutator. Thus, every brushed DC motor has AC flowing through its windings. Current flows through one or more pairs of brushes that touch the commutator; the brushes connect an external source of electric power to the rotating armature.

The rotating armature consists of one or more wire coils wound around a laminated, magnetically &quot;soft&quot; ferromagnetic core. Current from the brushes flows through the commutator and one winding of the armature, making it a temporary magnet (an electromagnet). The magnetic field produced interacts with a stationary magnetic field produced by either PMs or another winding (a field coil), as part of the motor frame. The force between the two magnetic fields rotates the shaft. The commutator switches power to the coils as the rotor turns, keeping the poles from ever fully aligning with the magnetic poles of the stator field, so that the rotor keeps turning as long as power is applied.

Many of the limitations of the classic commutator DC motor are due to the need for brushes to maintain contact with the commutator, creating friction. The brushes create sparks while crossing the insulating gaps between commutator sections. Depending on the commutator design, the brushes may create short circuits between adjacent sections—and hence coil ends. Furthermore, the rotor coils&#x27; inductance causes the voltage across each to rise when its circuit opens, increasing the sparking. This sparking limits the maximum speed of the machine, as too-rapid sparking will overheat, erode, or even melt the commutator. The current density per unit area of the brushes, in combination with their resistivity, limits the motor&#x27;s output. Crossing the gaps also generates electrical noise; sparking generates RFI. Brushes eventually wear out and require replacement, and the commutator itself is subject to wear and maintenance or replacement. The commutator assembly on a large motor is a costly element, requiring precision assembly of many parts. On small motors, the commutator is usually permanently integrated into the rotor, so replacing it usually requires replacing the rotor.

While most commutators are cylindrical, some are flat, segmented discs mounted on an insulator.

Large brushes create a large contact area, which maximizes motor output, while small brushes have low mass to maximize the speed at which the motor can run without excessive sparking. (Small brushes are desirable for their lower cost.) Stiffer brush springs can be used to make brushes of a given mass work at a higher speed, despite greater friction losses (lower efficiency) and accelerated brush and commutator wear. Therefore, DC motor brush design entails a trade-off between output power, speed, and efficiency/wear.

DC machines are defined as follows:

* Armature circuit – A winding that carries the load, either stationary or rotating.
* Field circuit – A set of windings that produces a magnetic field.
* Commutation: A mechanical technique in which rectification can be achieved, or from which DC can be derived.
The five types of brushed DC motor are:

* Shunt-wound 
* Series-wound 
* Compound (two configurations):
** Cumulative compound
** Differentially compounded
* Permanent magnet (not shown)
* Separately excited (not shown).

==== Permanent magnet ====

A permanent magnet (PM) motor does not have a field winding on the stator frame, relying instead on PMs to provide the magnetic field. Compensating windings in series with the armature may be used on large motors to improve commutation under load. This field is fixed and cannot be adjusted for speed control. PM fields (stators) are convenient in miniature motors to eliminate the power consumption of the field winding. Most larger DC motors are of the &quot;dynamo&quot; type, which have stator windings. Historically, PMs could not be made to retain high flux if they were disassembled; field windings were more practical to obtain the needed flux. However, large PMs are costly, as well as dangerous and difficult to assemble; this favors wound fields for large machines.

To minimize overall weight and size, miniature PM motors may use high energy magnets made with neodymium; most are neodymium-iron-boron alloy. With their higher flux density, electric machines with high-energy PMs are at least competitive with all optimally designed singly-fed synchronous and induction electric machines. Miniature motors resemble the structure in the illustration, except that they have at least three rotor poles (to ensure starting, regardless of rotor position) and their outer housing is a steel tube that magnetically links the exteriors of the curved field magnets.

===Electronic commutator (EC)===
==== Brushless DC ====

Some of the problems of the brushed DC motor are eliminated in the BLDC design. In this motor, the mechanical &quot;rotating switch&quot; or commutator is replaced by an external electronic switch synchronised to the rotor&#x27;s position. BLDC motors are typically 85%+ efficient, reaching up to 96.5%, while brushed DC motors are typically 75–80% efficient.

The BLDC motor&#x27;s characteristic trapezoidal counter-electromotive force (CEMF) waveform is derived partly from the stator windings being evenly distributed, and partly from the placement of the rotor&#x27;s permanent magnets. Also known as electronically commutated DC or inside-out DC motors, the stator windings of trapezoidal BLDC motors can be single-phase, two-phase or three-phase and use Hall effect sensors mounted on their windings for rotor position sensing and low cost closed-loop commutator control.

BLDC motors are commonly used where precise speed control is necessary, as in computer disk drives or video cassette recorders. The spindles within CD, CD-ROM (etc.) drives, and mechanisms within office products, such as fans, laser printers and photocopiers. They have several advantages over conventional motors:

* They are more efficient than AC fans using shaded-pole motors, running much cooler than the AC equivalents. This cool operation leads to much-improved life of the fan&#x27;s bearings.
* Without a commutator, the life of a BLDC motor can be significantly longer compared to a brushed DC motor with a commutator. Commutation tends to cause electrical and RF noise; without a commutator or brushes, a BLDC motor may be used in electrically sensitive devices like audio equipment or computers.
* The same Hall effect sensors that provide the commutation can provide a convenient tachometer signal for closed-loop control (servo-controlled) applications. In fans, the tachometer signal can be used to derive a &quot;fan OK&quot; signal as well as provide running speed feedback.
* The motor can be synchronized to an internal or external clock, providing precise speed control.
* BLDC motors do not spark, making them better suited to environments with volatile chemicals and fuels. Sparking also generates ozone, which can accumulate in poorly ventilated buildings.
* BLDC motors are usually used in small equipment such as computers and are generally used in fans to remove heat.
* They make little noise, which is an advantage in equipment that is affected by vibrations.

Modern BLDC motors range in power from a fraction of a watt to many kilowatts. Larger BLDC motors rated up to about 100 kW are used in electric vehicles. They also find use in electric model aircraft.

====Switched reluctance motor====
The switched reluctance motor (SRM) has no brushes or permanent magnets, and the rotor has no electric currents. Torque comes from a slight misalignment of poles on the rotor with poles on the stator. The rotor aligns itself with the magnetic field of the stator, while the stator field windings are sequentially energized to rotate the stator field.

The magnetic flux created by the field windings follows the path of least magnetic sending the flux through rotor poles that are closest to the energized poles of the stator, thereby magnetizing those poles of the rotor and creating torque. As the rotor turns, different windings are energized, keeping the rotor turning.

SRMs are used in some appliances and vehicles.

===Universal AC/DC motor===
A commutated, electrically excited, series or parallel wound motor is referred to as a universal motor because it can be designed to operate on either AC or DC power. A universal motor can operate well on AC because the current in both the field and the armature coils (and hence the resultant magnetic fields) synchronously reverse polarity, and hence the resulting mechanical force occurs in a constant direction of rotation.

Operating at normal power line frequencies, universal motors are often used in sub-kilowatt applications. Universal motors formed the basis of the traditional railway traction motor in electric railways. In this application, using AC power on a motor designed to run on DC would experience efficiency losses due to eddy current heating of their magnetic components, particularly the motor field pole-pieces that, for DC, would have used solid (un-laminated) iron. They are now rarely used.

An advantage is that AC power may be used on motors that specifically have high starting torque and compact design if high running speeds are used. By contrast, maintenance is higher and lifetimes are shortened. Such motors are used in devices that are not heavily used, and have high starting-torque demands. Multiple taps on the field coil provide (imprecise) stepped speed control. Household blenders that advertise many speeds typically combine a field coil with several taps and a diode that can be inserted in series with the motor (causing the motor to run on half-wave rectified AC). Universal motors also lend themselves to electronic speed control and, as such, are a choice for devices such as domestic washing machines. The motor can agitate the drum (both forwards and in reverse) by switching the field winding with respect to the armature.

Whereas SCIMs cannot turn a shaft faster than allowed by the power line frequency, universal motors can run at much higher speeds. This makes them useful for appliances such as blenders, vacuum cleaners, and hair dryers where high speed and light weight are desirable. They are also commonly used in portable power tools, such as drills, sanders, circular and jig saws, where the motor&#x27;s characteristics work well. Many vacuum cleaner and weed trimmer motors exceed , while miniature grinders may exceed .

==Externally commutated AC machine==

AC induction and synchronous motors are optimized for operation on single-phase or polyphase sinusoidal or quasi-sinusoidal waveform power such as supplied for fixed-speed applications by the AC power grid or for variable-speed application from variable-frequency drive (VFD) controllers.

===Induction motor===
An induction motor is an asynchronous AC motor where power is transferred to the rotor by electromagnetic induction, much like transformer action. An induction motor resembles a rotating transformer, because the stator (stationary part) is essentially the primary side of the transformer and the rotor (rotating part) is the secondary side. Polyphase induction motors are widely used in industry.

==== Cage and wound rotor ====
Induction motors may be divided into Squirrel Cage Induction Motors (SCIM) and Wound Rotor Induction Motors (WRIM). SCIMs have a heavy winding made up of solid bars, usually aluminum or copper, electrically connected by rings at the ends of the rotor. The bars and rings as a whole are much like an animal&#x27;s rotating exercise cage.

Currents induced into this winding provide the rotor magnetic field. The shape of the rotor bars determines the speed-torque characteristics. At low speeds, the current induced in the squirrel cage is nearly at line frequency and tends to stay in the outer parts of the cage. As the motor accelerates, the slip frequency becomes lower, and more current reaches the interior. By shaping the bars to change the resistance of the winding portions in the interior and outer parts of the cage, a variable resistance is effectively inserted in the rotor circuit. However, most such motors employ uniform bars.

In a WRIM, the rotor winding is made of many turns of insulated wire and is connected to slip rings on the motor shaft. An external resistor or other control device can be connected in the rotor circuit. Resistors allow control of the motor speed, although dissipating significant power. A converter can be fed from the rotor circuit and return the slip-frequency power that would otherwise be wasted into the power system through an inverter or separate motor-generator.

WRIMs are used primarily to start a high inertia load or a load that requires high starting torque across the full speed range. By correctly selecting the resistors used in the secondary resistance or slip ring starter, the motor is able to produce maximum torque at a relatively low supply current from zero speed to full speed.

Motor speed can be changed because the motor&#x27;s torque curve is effectively modified by the amount of resistance connected to the rotor circuit. Increasing resistance lowers the speed of maximum torque. If the resistance is increased beyond the point where the maximum torque occurs at zero speed, the torque is further reduced.

When used with a load that has a torque curve that increases with speed, the motor operates at the speed where the torque developed by the motor is equal to the load torque. Reducing the load causes the motor to speed up, while increasing the load causes the motor to slow down until the load and motor torque are again equal. Operated in this manner, the slip losses are dissipated in the secondary resistors and can be significant. The speed regulation and net efficiency is poor.

====Torque motor====

A torque motor can operate indefinitely while stalled, that is, with the rotor blocked from turning, without incurring damage. In this mode of operation, the motor applies a steady torque to the load.

A common application is the supply- and take-up reel motors in a tape drive. In this application, driven by a low voltage, the characteristics of these motors apply a steady light tension to the tape whether or not the capstan is feeding tape past the tape heads. Driven from a higher voltage (delivering a higher torque), torque motors can achieve fast-forward and rewind operation without requiring additional mechanics such as gears or clutches. In the computer gaming world, torque motors are used in force feedback steering wheels.

Another common application is to control the throttle of an internal combustion engine with an electronic governor. The motor works against a return spring to move the throttle in accord with the governor output. The latter monitors engine speed by counting electrical pulses from the ignition system or from a magnetic pickup and depending on the speed, makes small adjustments to the amount of current. If the engine slows down relative to the desired speed, the current increases, producing more torque, pulling against the return spring and opening the throttle. Should the engine run too fast, the governor reduces the current, allowing the return spring to pull back and reduce the throttle.

===Synchronous motor===

A synchronous electric motor is an AC motor. It includes a rotor spinning with coils passing magnets at the same frequency as the AC and produces a magnetic field to drive it. It has zero slip under typical operating conditions. By contrast induction motors must slip to produce torque. One type of synchronous motor is like an induction motor except that the rotor is excited by a DC field. Slip rings and brushes conduct current to the rotor. The rotor poles connect to each other and move at the same speed. Another type, for low load torque, has flats ground onto a conventional squirrel-cage rotor to create discrete poles. Yet another, as made by Hammond for its pre-World War II clocks, and in older Hammond organs, has no rotor windings and discrete poles. It is not self-starting. The clock requires manual starting by a small knob on the back, while the older Hammond organs had an auxiliary starting motor connected by a spring-loaded manually operated switch.

Hysteresis synchronous motors typically are (essentially) two-phase motors with a phase-shifting capacitor for one phase. They start like induction motors, but when slip rate decreases sufficiently, the rotor (a smooth cylinder) becomes temporarily magnetized. Its distributed poles make it act like a permanent magnet synchronous motor. The rotor material, like that of a common nail, stays magnetized, but can be demagnetized with little difficulty. Once running, the rotor poles stay in place; they do not drift.

Low-power synchronous timing motors (such as those for traditional electric clocks) may have multi-pole permanent magnet external cup rotors, and use shading coils to provide starting torque. &quot;Telechron&quot; clock motors have shaded poles for starting torque, and a two-spoke ring rotor that performs like a discrete two-pole rotor.

===Doubly-fed electric machine===

Doubly fed electric motors have two independent multiphase winding sets, which contribute active (i.e., working) power to the energy conversion process, with at least one of the winding sets electronically controlled for variable speed operation. Two independent multiphase winding sets (i.e., dual armature) are the maximum provided in a single package without topology duplication. Doubly-fed electric motors have an effective constant torque speed range that is twice synchronous speed for a given frequency of excitation. This is twice the constant torque speed range as singly-fed electric machines, which have only one active winding set.

A doubly-fed motor allows for a smaller electronic converter but the cost of the rotor winding and slip rings may offset the saving in the power electronics components. Difficulties affect controlling speed near synchronous speed limit applications.

==Advanced types==
===Rotary===
====Ironless or coreless rotor motor====

The coreless or ironless DC motor is a specialized permanent magnet DC motor. Optimized for rapid acceleration, the rotor is constructed without an iron core. The rotor can take the form of a winding-filled cylinder, or a self-supporting structure comprising only wire and bonding material. The rotor can fit inside the stator magnets; a magnetically soft stationary cylinder inside the rotor provides a return path for the stator magnetic flux. A second arrangement has the rotor winding basket surrounding the stator magnets. In that design, the rotor fits inside a magnetically soft cylinder that can serve as the motor housing, and provides a return path for the flux.

Because the rotor is much lower mass than a conventional rotor, it can accelerate much more rapidly, often achieving a mechanical time constant under one millisecond. This is especially true if the windings use aluminum rather than (heavier) copper. The rotor has no metal mass to act as a heat sink; even small motors must be cooled. Overheating can be an issue for these designs.

The vibrating alert of cellular phones can be generated by cylindrical permanent-magnet motors, or disc-shaped types that have a thin multipolar disc field magnet, and an intentionally unbalanced molded-plastic rotor structure with two bonded coreless coils. Metal brushes and a flat commutator switch power to the rotor coils.

Related limited-travel actuators have no core and a bonded coil placed between the poles of high-flux thin permanent magnets. These are the fast head positioners for rigid-disk (&quot;hard disk&quot;) drives. Although the contemporary design differs considerably from that of loudspeakers, it is still loosely (and incorrectly) referred to as a &quot;voice coil&quot; structure, because some earlier rigid-disk-drive heads moved in straight lines, and had a drive structure much like that of a loudspeaker.

====Pancake or axial rotor motor====

The printed armature or pancake motor has windings shaped as a disc running between arrays of high-flux magnets. The magnets are arranged in a circle facing the rotor spaced to form an axial air gap. This design is commonly known as the pancake motor because of its flat profile.

The armature (originally formed on a printed circuit board) is made from punched copper sheets that are laminated together using advanced composites to form a thin, rigid disc. The armature does not have a separate ring commutator. The brushes move directly on the armature surface making the whole design compact.

An alternative design is to use wound copper wire laid flat with a central conventional commutator, in a flower and petal shape. The windings are typically stabilized with electrical epoxy potting systems. These are filled epoxies that have moderate, mixed viscosity and a long gel time. They are highlighted by low shrinkage and low exotherm, and are typically UL 1446 recognized as a potting compound insulated with , Class H rating.

The unique advantage of ironless DC motors is the absence of cogging (torque variations caused by changing attraction between the iron and the magnets). Parasitic eddy currents cannot form in the rotor as it is totally ironless, although iron rotors are laminated. This can greatly improve efficiency, but variable-speed controllers must use a higher switching rate (&gt;40 kHz) or DC because of decreased electromagnetic induction.

These motors were invented to drive the capstan(s) of magnetic tape drives, where minimal time to reach operating speed and minimal stopping distance were critical. Pancake motors are widely used in high-performance servo-controlled systems, robotic systems, industrial automation and medical devices. Due to the variety of constructions now available, the technology is used in applications from high temperature military to low cost pump and basic servos.

Another approach (Magnax) is to use a single stator sandwiched between two rotors. One such design has produced peak power of 15 kW/kg, sustained power around 7.5 kW/kg. This yokeless axial flux motor offers a shorter flux path, keeping the magnets further from the axis. The design allows zero winding overhang; 100 percent of the windings are active. This is enhanced with the use of rectangular-crosssection copper wire. The motors can be stacked to work in parallel. Instabilities are minimized by ensuring that the two rotor discs put equal and opposing forces onto the stator disc. The rotors are connected directly to one another via a shaft ring, cancelling out the magnetic forces.

==== Servomotor ====

A servomotor is a motor that is used within a position-control or speed-control feedback system. Servomotors are used in applications such as machine tools, pen plotters, and other process systems. Motors intended for use in a servomechanism must have predictable characteristics for speed, torque, and power. The speed/torque curve is important and is high ratio for a servomotor. Dynamic response characteristics such as winding inductance and rotor inertia are important; these factors limit performance. Large, powerful, but slow-responding servo loops may use conventional AC or DC motors and drive systems with position or speed feedback. As dynamic response requirements increase, more specialized motor designs such as coreless motors are used. AC motors&#x27; superior power density and acceleration characteristics tends to favor permanent magnet synchronous, BLDC, induction, and SRM drive approaches.

A servo system differs from some stepper motor applications in that position feedback is continuous while the motor is running. A stepper system inherently operates open-loop—relying on the motor not to &quot;miss steps&quot; for short term accuracy—with any feedback such as a &quot;home&quot; switch or position encoder external to the motor system.

====Stepper motor====
Stepper motors are typically used to provide precise rotations. An internal rotor containing permanent magnets or a magnetically soft rotor with salient poles is controlled by a set of electronically switched external magnets. A stepper motor may also be thought of as a cross between a DC electric motor and a rotary solenoid. As each coil is energized in turn, the rotor aligns itself with the magnetic field produced by the energized field winding. Unlike a synchronous motor, the stepper motor may not rotate continuously; instead, it moves in steps—starting and then stopping—advancing from one position to the next as field windings are energized and de-energized in sequence. Depending on the sequence, the rotor may turn forwards or backwards, and it may change direction, stop, speed up or slow down at any time.

Simple stepper motor drivers entirely energize or entirely de-energize the field windings, leading the rotor to &quot;cog&quot; to a limited number of positions. Microstepping drivers can proportionally control the power to the field windings, allowing the rotors to position between cog points and rotate smoothly. Computer-controlled stepper motors are one of the most versatile positioning systems, particularly as part of a digital servo-controlled system.

Stepper motors can be rotated to a specific angle in discrete steps with ease, and hence stepper motors are used for read/write head positioning in early disk drives, where the precision and speed they offered could correctly position the read/write head. As drive density increased, precision and speed limitations made them obsolete for hard drives—the precision limitation made them unusable, and the speed limitation made them uncompetitive—thus newer hard disk drives use voice coil-based head actuator systems. (The term &quot;voice coil&quot; in this connection is historic; it refers to the structure in a cone-type loudspeaker.)

Stepper motors are often used in computer printers, optical scanners, and digital photocopiers to move the active element, the print head carriage (inkjet printers), and the platen or feed rollers.

So-called quartz analog wristwatches contain the smallest commonplace stepping motors; they have one coil, draw little power, and have a permanent magnet rotor. The same kind of motor drives battery-powered quartz clocks. Some of these watches, such as chronographs, contain more than one stepper motor.

Closely related in design to three-phase AC synchronous motors, stepper motors and SRMs are classified as variable reluctance motor type.

===Linear===

A linear motor is essentially any electric motor that has been &quot;unrolled&quot; so that, instead of producing torque (rotation), it produces a straight-line force along its length.

Linear motors are most commonly induction motors or stepper motors. Linear motors are commonly found in roller-coasters where the rapid motion of the motorless railcar is controlled by the rail. They are also used in maglev trains, where the train &quot;flies&quot; over the ground. On a smaller scale, the 1978 era HP 7225A pen plotter used two linear stepper motors to move the pen along the X and Y axes.

=== Non-magnetic ===

==== Electrostatic ====

An electrostatic motor is based on the attraction and repulsion of electric charge. Usually, electrostatic motors are the dual of conventional coil-based motors. They typically require a high-voltage power supply, although small motors employ lower voltages. Conventional electric motors instead employ magnetic attraction and repulsion, and require high current at low voltages. In the 1750s, the first electrostatic motors were developed by Benjamin Franklin and Andrew Gordon. Electrostatic motors find frequent use in micro-electro-mechanical systems (MEMS) where their drive voltages are below 100 volts, and where moving, charged plates are far easier to fabricate than coils and iron cores. The molecular machinery that runs living cells is often based on linear and rotary electrostatic motors.

==== Piezoelectric ====

A piezoelectric motor or piezo motor is a type of electric motor based upon the change in shape of a piezoelectric material when an electric field is applied. Piezoelectric motors make use of the converse piezoelectric effect whereby the material produces acoustic or ultrasonic vibrations to produce linear or rotary motion. In one mechanism, the elongation in a single plane is used to make a series of stretches and position holds, similar to the way a caterpillar moves.

==== Electric propulsion ====

An electrically powered spacecraft propulsion system uses electric motor technology to propel spacecraft in outer space. Most systems are based on electrically accelerating propellant to high speed, while some systems are based on electrodynamic tethers principles of propulsion to the magnetosphere.

==Comparison by major categories==
==Operating principles==
===Force and torque===
An electric motor converts electrical energy to mechanical energy through the force between two opposed magnetic fields. At least one of the two magnetic fields must be created by an electromagnet through the magnetic field caused by an electrical current.

The force between a current formula_1 in a conductor of length formula_2 perpendicular to a magnetic field formula_3 may be calculated using the Lorentz force law:

: formula_4

Note: X denotes vector cross product.

The most general approaches to calculating the forces in motors use tensor notation.

===Power===
Electric motor output power is given as formula_5where:

* formula_6: shaft angular speed, [radians per second] 
* formula_7: torque, [Newton-meters]
* formula_8: force, [Newtons]
* formula_9: velocity, [meters per second].

In Imperial units a motor&#x27;s mechanical power output is given by,

: formula_10 (horsepower)
where:

* formula_11, shaft angular speed rpm]
* formula_7: torque, [foot-pounds].

In an asynchronous or induction motor, the relationship between motor speed and air gap power is given by the following:

: formula_13, where
:: Rr – rotor resistance
:: Ir2 – square of current induced in the rotor
:: s – motor slip; i.e., difference between synchronous speed and slip speed, which provides the relative movement needed for current induction in the rotor.

===Back EMF===

The movement of armature windings of a direct-current or universal motor through a magnetic field, induce a voltage in them. This voltage tends to oppose the motor supply voltage and so is called &quot;back electromotive force (EMF)&quot;. The voltage is proportional to the running speed of the motor. The back EMF of the motor, plus the voltage drop across the winding internal resistance and brushes, must equal the voltage at the brushes. This provides the fundamental mechanism of speed regulation in a DC motor. If the mechanical load increases, the motor slows down; a lower back EMF results, and more current is drawn from the supply. This increased current provides the additional torque to balance the load.

In AC machines, it is sometimes useful to consider a back EMF source within the machine; this is of particular concern for close speed regulation of induction motors on VFDs.

===Losses===
Motor losses are mainly due to resistive losses in windings, core losses and mechanical losses in bearings, and aerodynamic losses, particularly where cooling fans are present, also occur.

Losses also occur in commutation, mechanical commutators spark; electronic commutators and also dissipate heat.

===Efficiency===
To calculate a motor&#x27;s efficiency, the mechanical output power is divided by the electrical input power:

: formula_14,

where formula_15 is energy conversion efficiency, formula_16 is electrical input power, and formula_17 is mechanical output power:

: formula_18

: formula_19

where formula_20 is input voltage, formula_1 is input current, formula_7 is output torque, and formula_23 is output angular velocity. It is possible to derive analytically the point of maximum efficiency. It is typically at less than 1/2 the stall torque.

Various national regulatory authorities have enacted legislation to encourage the manufacture and use of higher-efficiency motors. Electric motors have efficiencies ranging from around 15%-20% for shaded pole motors, up to 98% for permanent magnet motors, with efficiency also dependent on load. Peak efficiency is usually at 75% of the rated load. So (as an example) a 10 HP motor is most efficient when driving a load that requires 7.5 HP. Efficiency also depends on motor size; larger motors tend to be more efficient. Some motors can not operate continually for more than a specified period of time (e.g. for more than an hour per run)

===Goodness factor===

Eric Laithwaite proposed a metric to determine the &#x27;goodness&#x27; of an electric motor:
:formula_24

Where:

: formula_25 is the goodness factor (factors above 1 are likely to be efficient)
: formula_26 are the cross sectional areas of the magnetic and electric circuit
: formula_27 are the lengths of the magnetic and electric circuits
: formula_28 is the permeability of the core
: formula_23 is the angular frequency the motor is driven at

From this, he showed that the most efficient motors are likely to have relatively large magnetic poles. However, the equation only directly relates to non PM motors.

==Performance parameters==
=== Torque ===
Electromagnetic motors derive torque from the vector product of the interacting fields. Calculating torque requires knowledge of the fields in the air gap. Once these have been established, the torque is the integral of all the force vectors multiplied by the vector&#x27;s radius. The current flowing in the winding produces the fields. For a motor using a magnetic material the field is not proportional to the current.

A figure relating the current to the torque can inform motor selection. The maximum torque for a motor depends on the maximum current, absent thermal considerations.

When optimally designed within a given core saturation constraint and for a given active current (i.e., torque current), voltage, pole-pair number, excitation frequency (i.e., synchronous speed), and air-gap flux density, all categories of electric motors/generators exhibit virtually the same maximum continuous shaft torque (i.e., operating torque) within a given air-gap area with winding slots and back-iron depth, which determines the physical size of electromagnetic core. Some applications require bursts of torque beyond the maximum, such as bursts to accelerate an electric vehicle from standstill. Always limited by magnetic core saturation or safe operating temperature rise and voltage, the capacity for torque bursts beyond the maximum differs significantly across motor/generator types.

Electric machines without a transformer circuit topology, such as that of WRSMs or PMSMs, cannot provide torque bursts without saturating the magnetic core. At that point, additional current cannot increase torque. Furthermore, the permanent magnet assembly of PMSMs can be irreparably damaged.

Electric machines with a transformer circuit topology, such as induction machines, induction doubly-fed electric machines, and induction or synchronous wound-rotor doubly-fed (WRDF) machines, permit torque bursts because the EMF-induced active current on either side of the transformer oppose each other and thus contribute nothing to the transformer coupled magnetic core flux density, avoiding core saturation.

Electric machines that rely on induction or asynchronous principles short-circuit one port of the transformer circuit and as a result, the reactive impedance of the transformer circuit becomes dominant as slip increases, which limits the magnitude of active (i.e., real) current. Torque bursts two to three times higher than the maximum design torque are realizable.

The brushless wound-rotor synchronous doubly-fed (BWRSDF) machine is the only electric machine with a truly dual ported transformer circuit topology (i.e., both ports independently excited with no short-circuited port). The dual ported transformer circuit topology is known to be unstable and requires a multiphase slip-ring-brush assembly to propagate limited power to the rotor winding set. If a precision means were available to instantaneously control torque angle and slip for synchronous operation during operation while simultaneously providing brushless power to the rotor winding set, the active current of the BWRSDF machine would be independent of the reactive impedance of the transformer circuit and bursts of torque significantly higher than the maximum operating torque and far beyond the practical capability of any other type of electric machine would be realizable. Torque bursts greater than eight times operating torque have been calculated.

===Continuous torque density===
The continuous torque density of conventional electric machines is determined by the size of the air-gap area and the back-iron depth, which are determined by the power rating of the armature winding set, the speed of the machine, and the achievable air-gap flux density before core saturation. Despite the high coercivity of neodymium or samarium-cobalt permanent magnets, continuous torque density is virtually the same amongst electric machines with optimally designed armature winding sets. Continuous torque density relates to method of cooling and permissible operation period before destruction by overheating of windings or permanent magnet damage.

Other sources state that various e-machine topologies have differing torque density. One source shows the following:

where—specific torque density is normalized to 1.0 for the surface permanent magnet (SPM)—brushless ac, 180° current conduction.

Torque density is approximately four times greater for liquid cooled motors, compared to those which are air cooled.

A source comparing direct current, induction motors (IM), PMSM and SRM showed:

Another source notes that PMSM up to 1 MW have considerably higher torque density than induction machines.

===Continuous power density===
The continuous power density is determined by the product of the continuous torque density and the constant torque speed range. Electric motors can achieve densities of up to 20 kW/kg, meaning 20 kilowatts of output power per kilogram.

==Acoustic noise and vibrations==
Acoustic noise and vibrations are usually classified in three sources:

* mechanical sources (e.g. due to bearings)
* aerodynamic sources (e.g. due to shaft-mounted fans)
* magnetic sources (e.g. due to magnetic forces such as Maxwell and magnetostriction forces acting on stator and rotor structures)

The latter source, which can be responsible for the &quot;whining noise&quot; of electric motors, is called electromagnetically induced acoustic noise.

<text>In the arts and literature, the term avant-garde ( meaning or ) identifies an experimental genre or work of art, and the artist who created it, which usually is aesthetically innovative, whilst initially being ideologically unacceptable to the artistic establishment of the time. The military metaphor of an &quot;advance guard&quot; identifies the artists and writers whose innovations in style, form, and subject-matter challenge the artistic and aesthetic validity of the established forms of art and the literary traditions of their time; thus, the artists who created the anti-novel and Surrealism were ahead of their times.

As a stratum of the intelligentsia of a society, avant-garde artists promote progressive and radical politics and advocate for societal reform with and through works of art. In the essay &quot;The Artist, the Scientist, and the Industrialist&quot; (1825), Benjamin Olinde Rodrigues&#x27;s political usage of &quot;vanguard&quot; identified the moral obligation of artists to &quot;serve as [the] avant-garde&quot; of the people, because &quot;the power of the arts is, indeed, the most immediate and fastest way&quot; to realise social, political, and economic reforms.

In the realm of culture, the artistic experiments of the avant-garde push the aesthetic boundaries of societal norms, such as the disruptions of modernism in poetry, fiction, and drama, painting, music, and architecture, that occurred in the late 19th and in the early 20th centuries. In art history the socio-cultural functions of avant-garde art trace from Dada (1915–1920s) through the Situationist International (1957–1972) to the postmodernism of the American Language poets (1960s–1970s).

== History ==

The French military term &quot;avant-garde&quot; (advanced guard) identified a reconnaissance unit who scouted the terrain ahead of the main force of the army. In 19th-century French politics, the term &quot;avant-garde&quot; (vanguard) identified Left-wing political reformists who agitated for radical political change in French society. In the mid-19th century, as a cultural term, &quot;avant-garde&quot; identified a genre of art that advocated art-as-politics, art as an aesthetic and political means for realising social change in a society. Since the 20th century, the art term &quot;avant-garde&quot; identifies a stratum of the Intelligentsia that comprises novelists and writers, artists and architects &quot;et al.&quot; whose creative perspectives, ideas, and experimental artworks challenge the cultural values of contemporary bourgeois society. 

In the U.S. of the 1960s, the post–WWII changes to American culture and society allowed avant-garde artists to produce works of art that addressed the matters of the day, usually in political and sociologic opposition to the cultural conformity inherent to popular culture and to consumerism as a way of life and as a worldview.

==Theories==
In &quot;The Theory of the Avant-Garde&quot; (&quot;Teoria dell&#x27;arte d&#x27;avanguardia&quot;, 1962), the academic Renato Poggioli provides an early analysis of the &quot;avant-garde&quot; as art and as artistic movement. Surveying the historical and social, psychological and philosophical aspects of artistic vanguardism, Poggioli&#x27;s examples of avant-garde art, poetry, and music, show that avant-garde artists share some values and ideals as contemporary bohemians.

In &quot;Theory of the Avant-Garde&quot; (&quot;Theorie der Avantgarde&quot;, 1974), the literary critic Peter Bürger looks at The Establishment&#x27;s embrace of socially critical works of art as capitalist co-optation of the artists and the genre of avant-garde art, because &quot;art as an institution neutralizes the political content of the individual work [of art]&quot;.
In &quot;Neo-avantgarde and Culture Industry: Essays on European and American Art from 1955 to 1975&quot; (2000), Benjamin H. D. Buchloh argues for a dialectical approach to such political stances by avant-garde artists and the avant-garde genre of art.

==Society and the avant-garde==

Sociologically, as a stratum of the intelligentsia of a society, &quot;avant-garde&quot; artists, writers, architects, &quot;et al.&quot; produce artefacts — works of art, books, buildings — that intellectually and ideologically oppose the conformist value system of mainstream society. In the essay &quot;Avant-Garde and Kitsch&quot; (1939), Clement Greenberg said that the artistic vanguard oppose high culture and reject the artifice of mass culture, because the avant-garde functionally oppose the dumbing down of society — be it with low culture or with high culture. That in a capitalist society each medium of mass communication is a factory producing artworks, and is not a legitimate artistic medium; therefore, the products of mass culture are &quot;kitsch&quot;, simulations and simulacra of Art.

Walter Benjamin in the essay &quot;The Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction&quot; (1939) and Theodor Adorno and Max Horkheimer in the &quot;Dialectic of Enlightenment&quot; (1947) said that the artifice of mass culture voids the artistic value (the &quot;aura&quot;) of a work of art. That the capitalist culture industry (publishing and music, radio and cinema, etc.) continually produces artificial culture for mass consumption, which is facilitated by mechanically produced art-products of mediocre quality displacing art of quality workmanship; thus, the profitability of art-as-commodity determines its artistic value.

In &quot;The Society of the Spectacle&quot; (1967), Guy Debord said that the financial, commercial, and economic co-optation of the avant-garde into a commodity produced by neoliberal capitalism makes doubtful that avant-garde artists will remain culturally and intellectually relevant to their societies for preferring profit to cultural change and political progress. In &quot;The Theory-Death of the Avant-Garde&quot; (1991), Paul Mann said that the avant-garde are economically integral to the contemporary institutions of the Establishment, specifically as part of the culture industry. Noting the conceptual shift, theoreticians, such as Matei Calinescu, in &quot;Five Faces of Modernity: Modernism, Avant-garde, Decadence, Kitsch, Postmodernism&quot; (1987), and Hans Bertens in &quot;The Idea of the Postmodern: A History&quot; (1995), said that Western culture entered a post-modern time when the modernist ways of thought and action and the production of art have become redundant in a capitalist economy.

Parting from the claims of Greenberg in the late 1930s and the insights of Poggioli in the early 1960s, in &quot;The De-Definition of Art: Action Art to Pop to Earthworks&quot; (1983), the critic Harold Rosenberg said that since the middle of the 1960s the politically progressive avant-garde ceased being adversaries to artistic commercialism and the mediocrity of mass culture, which political disconnection transformed being an artist into &quot;a profession, one of whose aspects is the pretense of overthrowing [the profession of being an artist].&quot;

Avant-garde is frequently defined in contrast to &quot;arrière-garde&quot;, which in its original military sense refers to a rearguard force that protects the advance-guard. The term was less frequently used than &quot;avant-garde&quot; in 20th-century art criticism. The art historians Natalie Adamson and Toby Norris argue that &quot;arrière-garde&quot; is not reducible to a kitsch style or reactionary orientation, but can instead be used to refer to artists who engage with the legacy of the avant-garde while maintaining an awareness that doing so is in some sense anachronistic. The critic Charles Altieri argues that avant-garde and arrière-garde are interdependent: &quot;where there is an avant-garde, there must be an &quot;arrière-garde&quot;.&quot;

==Examples==
===Music===

Avant-garde in music can refer to any form of music working within traditional structures while seeking to breach boundaries in some manner. The term is used loosely to describe the work of any musicians who radically depart from tradition altogether. By this definition, some avant-garde composers of the 20th century include Arnold Schoenberg, Richard Strauss (in his earliest work), Charles Ives, Igor Stravinsky, Anton Webern, Edgard Varèse, Alban Berg, George Antheil (in his earliest works only), Henry Cowell (in his earliest works), Harry Partch, John Cage, Iannis Xenakis, Morton Feldman, Karlheinz Stockhausen, Pauline Oliveros, Philip Glass, Meredith Monk, Laurie Anderson, and Diamanda Galás.

There is another definition of &quot;Avant-gardism&quot; that distinguishes it from &quot;modernism&quot;: Peter Bürger, for example, says avant-gardism rejects the &quot;institution of art&quot; and challenges social and artistic values, and so necessarily involves political, social, and cultural factors. According to the composer and musicologist Larry Sitsky, modernist composers from the early 20th century who do not qualify as avant-gardists include Arnold Schoenberg, Anton Webern, and Igor Stravinsky; later modernist composers who do not fall into the category of avant-gardists include Elliott Carter, Milton Babbitt, György Ligeti, Witold Lutosławski, and Luciano Berio, since &quot;their modernism was not conceived for the purpose of goading an audience.&quot;

The 1960s saw a wave of free and avant-garde music in jazz genre, embodied by artists such as Ornette Coleman, Sun Ra, Albert Ayler, Archie Shepp, John Coltrane and Miles Davis. In the rock music of the 1970s, the &quot;art&quot; descriptor was generally understood to mean &quot;aggressively avant-garde&quot; or &quot;pretentiously progressive&quot;. Post-punk artists from the late 1970s rejected traditional rock sensibilities in favor of an avant-garde aesthetic.

===Theatre===

Whereas the avant-garde has a significant history in 20th-century music, it is more pronounced in theatre and performance art, and often in conjunction with music and sound design innovations, as well as developments in visual media design. There are movements in theatre history that are characterized by their contributions to the avant-garde traditions in both the United States and Europe. Among these are Fluxus, Happenings, and Neo-Dada.

=== Architecture ===
Brutalist architecture was greatly influenced by an avant-garde movement.

<text>Honeysuckles are arching shrubs or twining vines in the genus Lonicera () of the family Caprifoliaceae. The genus includes 158 species native to northern latitudes in North America, Eurasia, and North Africa. Widely known species include &quot;Lonicera periclymenum&quot; (common honeysuckle or woodbine), &quot;Lonicera japonica&quot; (Japanese honeysuckle, white honeysuckle, or Chinese honeysuckle) and &quot;Lonicera sempervirens&quot; (coral honeysuckle, trumpet honeysuckle, or woodbine honeysuckle). &quot;L. japonica&quot; is a highly invasive species considered a significant pest in parts of North America, Europe, South America, New Zealand, Australia, and Africa.

Some species are highly fragrant and colorful, so are cultivated as ornamental garden plants. In North America, hummingbirds are attracted to the flowers, especially &quot;L. sempervirens&quot; and &quot;L. ciliosa&quot; (orange honeysuckle). Honeysuckle derives its name from the edible sweet nectar obtainable from its tubular flowers. The name &quot;Lonicera&quot; stems from Adam Lonicer, a Renaissance botanist.

==Description==
Most species of &quot;Lonicera&quot; are hardy twining climbers, with a minority of shrubby habit. Some species (including &quot;Lonicera hildebrandiana&quot; from the Himalayan foothills and &quot;L. etrusca&quot; from the Mediterranean) are tender and can be grown outside only in subtropical zones. The leaves are opposite, simple oval, long; most are deciduous but some are evergreen.

Many of the species have sweetly scented, bilaterally symmetrical flowers that produce a sweet, edible nectar, and most flowers are borne in clusters of two (leading to the common name of &quot;twinberry&quot; for certain North American species). Both shrubby and vining sorts have strongly fibrous stems which have been used for binding and textiles.

The fruit is a red, blue or black spherical or elongated berry containing several seeds; in most species the berries are mildly poisonous, but in a few (notably &quot;Lonicera caerulea&quot;) they are edible and grown for home use and commerce. Most honeysuckle berries are attractive to wildlife, which has led to species such as &quot;L. japonica&quot; and &quot;L. maackii&quot; spreading invasively outside of their home ranges. Many species of &quot;Lonicera&quot; are eaten by the larvae of some Lepidoptera species—see a list of Lepidoptera that feed on honeysuckles.

===Invasive species===
The spread of &quot;L. japonica&quot; in North America began in the United States in 1806, and it was widely cultivated by the 1860s. It was first discovered in Canada in Ontario forests in 1976, and became invasive by 2007. &quot;L. japonica&quot; was introduced in Australia between 1820 and 1840.

Several species of honeysuckle have become invasive when introduced outside their native range, particularly in North America, Europe, South America, Australia, and Africa. Invasive species include &quot;L. japonica&quot;, &quot;L. maackii&quot;, &quot;L. morrowii&quot;, &quot;L. tatarica&quot;, and the hybrid between the last two, &quot;L.&quot; × &quot;bella&quot;.

==Cultivation==
Honeysuckles are valued as garden plants, for their ability to cover unsightly walls and outbuildings, their profuse tubular flowers in early summer, and the intense fragrance of many varieties. The hardy climbing types need their roots in shade, and their flowering tops in sunlight or very light shade. Varieties need to be chosen with care, as they can become substantial. Cultivars of the dense, small-leaved &quot;L. nitida&quot; are used as low, narrow hedges.

The following hybrids have gained the Royal Horticultural Society&#x27;s Award of Garden Merit: 

*&quot;L.&quot; × &quot;heckrottii&quot; &#x27;Gold Flame&#x27; 
*&quot;L.&quot; &#x27;Mandarin&#x27; 
*&quot;L.&quot; × &quot;purpusii&quot; &#x27;Winter Beauty&#x27; 
*&quot;L.&quot; × &quot;tellmanniana&quot; 

Other cultivars are dealt with under their species names.

The honeysuckle species &quot;L. japonica&quot; is grown as a commercial crop for traditional Chinese medicine use.

Honeysuckle is also used to scent Chinese teas in a process similar to Jasmine tea. This was popularized in the Qing dynasty.

==Phytochemicals==
Component analyses of berries from 27 different cultivars and 3 genotypes of edible honeysuckle (&quot;Lonicera caerulea&quot; var. &quot;kamtschatica&quot;) showed the presence of iridoids, anthocyanins, flavonols, flavanonols, flavones, flavan-3-ols, and phenolic acids. While sugars determine the level of sweetness in the berries, organic acids and polyphenols are responsible for the sour taste and tartness. Some 51 of the same compounds in berries are found in flowers, although the proportions of these compounds varied among cultivars studied.

==Interaction with other species==
Many insects in the order Lepidoptera visit honeysuckles as a food source. An example of this is the moth &quot;Deilephila elpenor&quot;. This nocturnal species of moth is especially attracted to honeysuckles, and they visit the flowers at night to feed on their nectar.

<text>Syringa is a genus of 12 currently recognized species of flowering woody plants in the olive family or Oleaceae called lilacs. These lilacs are native to woodland and scrub from southeastern Europe to eastern Asia, and widely and commonly cultivated in temperate areas elsewhere.

The genus is most closely related to &quot;Ligustrum&quot; (privet), classified with it in Oleaceae tribus Oleeae subtribus Ligustrinae.

Lilacs are used as food plants by the larvae of some moth species, including lilac leaf mining moth, privet hawk moth, copper underwing, scalloped oak and Svensson&#x27;s copper underwing.

== Description ==

They are small trees, ranging in size from tall, with stems up to diameter. The leaves are opposite (occasionally in whorls of three) in arrangement, and their shape is simple and heart-shaped to broad lanceolate in most species, but pinnate in a few species (e.g. &quot;S. protolaciniata&quot;, &quot;S. pinnatifolia&quot;).

=== Flowers ===
The flowers are produced in spring, each flower being in diameter with a four-lobed corolla, the corolla tube narrow, long; they are monoecious, with fertile stamens and stigma in each flower. The usual flower colour is a shade of purple (often a light purple or &quot;lilac&quot;), but white, pale yellow and pink, and even a dark burgundy color are also found.

The flowers grow in large panicles, and in several species have a strong fragrance. Flowering varies between mid spring to early summer, depending on the species. One particular cultivar, trademark &quot;Bloomerang&quot;, first blooms in spring and then again late summer through fall.

=== Fruit ===
The fruit is a dry, brown capsule, splitting in two at maturity to release the two winged seeds.

== Etymology ==
The English common name &quot;lilac&quot; is from the French &quot;lilac&quot; via the from meaning the indigo plant or &quot;nilak&quot; meaning &quot;bluish&quot;; both &quot;lilanj&quot; and &quot;nilak&quot; come from Persian &quot;nīl&quot; &quot;indigo&quot; or &quot;nili&quot; &quot;dark blue&quot;.

=== Taxonomy ===
The genus &quot;Syringa&quot; was first formally described in 1753 by Carl Linnaeus and the description was published in &quot;Species Plantarum&quot;. The genus name &quot;Syringa&quot; is derived from Ancient Greek word &quot;syrinx&quot; meaning &quot;pipe&quot; or &quot;tube&quot; and refers to the hollow branches of &quot;S. vulgaris&quot;.

Homonym &quot;Syringa&quot; is a heterotypic synonym of Philadelphus.

==Cultivation and uses==

Lilacs are popular shrubs in parks and gardens throughout the temperate zone, and several hybrids and numerous cultivars have been developed. The term French lilac is often used to refer to modern double-flowered cultivars, thanks to the work of prolific breeder Victor Lemoine. Lilacs grow most successfully in well-drained soils, particularly those based on chalk. They flower on old wood, and produce more flowers if unpruned. If pruned, the plant responds by producing fast-growing young vegetative growth with no flowers, in an attempt to restore the removed branches. Lilac bushes can be prone to powdery mildew disease.

Lilac wood is not commonly used or commercially harvested due to the small size of the tree. It is a relatively hard wood, with an estimated Janka hardness of 2,350 lbf (10,440 N), and is reportedly good for woodturning 
The sapwood is typically cream-coloured and the heartwood can have various streaks of brown and purple.

Species have been historically used in various traditional medicines in Asia for treating ailments including cough, diarrhea, acute icteric hepatitis, vomiting, abdominal pain, and bronchitis. Compounds isolated from species of &quot;Syringa&quot; include phenylpropanoids such as syringin and iridoids such as oleuropein. Substituent compounds, such as iridoids, as well as crude extracts from &quot;Syringa&quot; plants have been shown to have to have effects including antitumor, antihypertensive, anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and antifungal activities in pharmacological studies.

== Symbolism ==

Lilacs are often considered to symbolize first love.

In Greece, Macedonia, Lebanon, and Cyprus, the lilac is strongly associated with Easter time because it flowers around that time; it is consequently called &quot;paschalia&quot;.

In the poem &quot;When Lilacs Last in the Dooryard Bloom&#x27;d&quot;, by Walt Whitman, lilacs are a reference to Abraham Lincoln.

The music-hall song by Ivor Novello, &quot;We&#x27;ll Gather Lilacs&quot;, first performed in 1945, speaks of the longing of two lovers to be reunited in a traditional English rural setting. It has since been recorded and performed by numerous artists.

&quot;Syringa vulgaris&quot; is the state flower of New Hampshire, because it &quot;is symbolic of that hardy character of the men and women of the Granite State.&quot;

==Festivals==
Several locations in North America hold annual Lilac Festivals, including:

* The Arnold Arboretum in Boston, Massachusetts, which celebrates &quot;Lilac Sunday&quot; every May. The Arboretum shows off its collection of over 422 lilac plants, of 194 different varieties. Lilac Sunday is the only day of the year when picnicking is allowed on the grounds of the Arboretum.
* Lombard, Illinois, called the &quot;Lilac Village&quot;, which has an annual lilac festival and parade in May. The village also contains Lilacia Park, a garden with over 200 varieties of lilacs, as well as over 50 kinds of tulips.
* Mackinac Island, in Michigan, which celebrates a weeklong lilac festival and lilac parade each June.
* Rochester, New York, which has held its Lilac Festival since 1898, hosts the longest-running festival in North America. Held in Highland Park, this celebration features 1,200 shrubs, representing over 500 varieties, many of which were developed in Rochester. It is the largest collection of varieties at any single place.
* The Royal Botanical Gardens near Hamilton, Ontario, which holds its Lilac Celebration each May.
* Spokane, Washington, known as the &quot;Lilac City&quot;, which holds an annual lilac festival and lilac parade.
* Franktown, Ontario, Canada, known as the Lilac Capital of Canada, holds an annual festival. With drystone masonry demonstrations and horse pulled wagon rides. 
* Calgary, Alberta, Canada holds an annual one-day Lilac Festival, which is primarily a street festival.

<doc id="76099" wikidata="Q212815" url="?curid=76099" title="Camellia">
<text>Camellia (pronounced or ) is a genus of flowering plants in the family Theaceae. They are found in tropical and subtropical areas in eastern and southern Asia, from the Himalayas east to Japan and Indonesia. There are more than 220 described species; almost all are found in southern China and Indochina. Camellias are popular ornamental, tea, and woody-oil plants cultivated worldwide for centuries. Over 26,000 cultivars, with more than 51,000 cultivar names, including synonyms, have been registered or published.

The leaves of &quot;C. sinensis&quot; are processed to create tea, and so are of particular economic importance in East Asia, Southeast Asia, and the Indian subcontinent, with the processed leaves widely sold and consumed globally. The ornamental &quot;C. japonica&quot;, &quot;C. sasanqua&quot; and their hybrids are the source of hundreds of garden cultivars. &quot;C. oleifera&quot; produces tea seed oil, used in cooking and cosmetics.

== Taxonomy ==
The genus was named by Linnaeus after the Jesuit botanist Georg Joseph Kamel, who worked in the Philippines and described one of its species (although Linnaeus did not refer to Kamel&#x27;s account when discussing the genus).

== Botany ==
Camellias are evergreen shrubs or small trees up to tall. Their leaves are alternately arranged, simple, thick, serrated, and usually glossy.

=== Flowers and fruit ===
Their flowers are usually large and conspicuous, one to 12 cm in diameter, with five to nine petals in naturally occurring species of camellias. The colors of the flowers vary from white through pink colors to red; truly yellow flowers are found only in South China and Vietnam. Tea varieties are always white-flowered. Camellia flowers throughout the genus are characterized by a dense bouquet of conspicuous yellow stamens, often contrasting with the petal colors. Some research has shown that the colour of petals in some species&#x27; flowers indicate their size and how they are pollinated; species with red or yellow flowers are pollinated by sunbirds whereas species with white flowers are smaller in diameter and are pollinated by bees.

The fruit of camellia plants is a dry capsule, sometimes subdivided into up to five compartments. Each compartment contains up to eight seeds.

== Growth ==
The various species of camellia plants are generally well-adapted to acid soils rich in humus, and most species do not grow well on chalky soil or other calcium-rich soils. Most species of camellias also require a large amount of water, either from natural rainfall or from irrigation, and the plants will not tolerate droughts. However, some of the more unusual camellias – typically species from karst soils in Vietnam – can grow without too much water.

Camellia plants usually have a rapid growth rate. Typically, they will grow about 30 cm per year until mature – however, this varies depending on their variety and geographical location.

== Ecology ==
Camellia plants are used as food plants by the larvae of some &quot;Lepidoptera&quot; species. Leaves of &quot;Camellia japonica&quot; are susceptible to the fungal parasite &quot;Mycelia sterile&quot; (see below for the significance), &quot;mycelia sterile PF1022&quot; produces a metabolite named PF1022A that is used to produce emodepside, an anthelmintic drug.

Due to habitat destruction, several camellias have become rare in their natural range. One of these is the aforementioned &quot;C. reticulata&quot;, grown commercially in thousands for horticulture and oil production but rare enough in its natural range to be considered a threatened species.

== Use by humans ==

&quot;Camellia sinensis&quot;, the tea plant, is of major commercial importance because tea is made from its leaves. The species &quot;C. sinensis&quot; is the product of many generations of selective breeding to bring out desirable qualities for tea. However, many other camellias can be used to produce a similar beverage. For example, tea made from &quot;C. sasanqua&quot; leaves is popular in some parts of Japan.

Seeds of &quot;C. oleifera&quot;, &quot;C. japonica&quot;, and, to a lesser extent, other species such as &quot;C. crapnelliana&quot;, &quot;C. reticulata&quot;, &quot;C. sasanqua&quot; and &quot;C. sinensis&quot; as well are pressed to make tea seed oil, a sweet seasoning and cooking oil special to East Asia. It is the most important cooking oil for hundreds of millions of people, particularly in southern China.

Camellia oil is commonly used to clean and protect the blades of cutting instruments.

Camellia oil pressed from seeds of &quot;C. japonica&quot;, also called tsubaki oil or tsubaki-abura (椿油) in Japanese, has been traditionally used in Japan for hair care. &quot;C. japonica&quot; plant is used to prepare traditional antiinflammatory medicines.

== History ==
=== Fossil record ===
The earliest fossil record of &quot;Camellia&quot; are the leaves of †&quot;C. abensis&quot; from the upper Eocene
of Japan, †&quot;C. abchasica&quot; from the lower Oligocene of Bulgaria and
†&quot;C. multiforma&quot; from the lower Oligocene of Washington, United States.

=== Garden history ===
Camellias were cultivated in the gardens of China for centuries before they were seen in Europe. The German botanist Engelbert Kaempfer reported that the &quot;Japan Rose&quot;, as he called it, grew wild in woodland and hedgerow, but that many superior varieties had been selected for gardens. Europeans&#x27; earliest views of camellias must have been their representations in Chinese painted wallpapers, where they were often represented growing in porcelain pots.

The first living camellias seen in England were a single red and a single white, grown and flowered in his garden at Thorndon Hall, Essex, by Robert James, Lord Petre, among the keenest gardeners of his generation, in 1739. His gardener James Gordon was the first to introduce camellias to commerce, from the nurseries he established after Lord Petre&#x27;s untimely death in 1743, at Mile End, Essex, near London.

With the expansion of the tea trade in the later 18th century, new varieties began to be seen in England, imported through the British East India Company. The Company&#x27;s John Slater was responsible for the first of the new camellias, double ones, in white and a striped red, imported in 1792. Further camellias imported in the East Indiamen were associated with the patrons whose gardeners grew them: a double red for Sir Robert Preston in 1794 and the pale pink named &quot;Lady Hume&#x27;s Blush&quot; for Amelia, the lady of Sir Abraham Hume of Wormleybury, Hertfordshire (1806). The camellia was imported from England to America in 1797 when Colonel John Stevens brought the flower as part of an effort to grow attractions within Elysian Fields in Hoboken, New Jersey. By 1819, twenty-five camellias had bloomed in England; that year the first monograph appeared, Samuel Curtis&#x27;s, &quot;A Monograph on the Genus Camellia&quot;, whose five handsome folio colored illustrations have usually been removed from the slender text and framed. Though they did not flower for over a decade, camellias that set seed rewarded their growers with a wealth of new varieties. By the 1840s, the camellia was at the height of its fashion as &quot;the&quot; luxury flower. The Parisian courtesan Marie Duplessis, who died young in 1847, inspired Dumas&#x27; &quot;La Dame aux camélias&quot; and Verdi&#x27;s &quot;La Traviata&quot;.

The fashionable imbricated formality of prized camellias was an element in their decline, replaced by the new hothouse orchid. Their revival after World War I as woodland shrubs for mild climates has been paralleled by the rise in popularity of &quot;Camellia sasanqua&quot;.

==Modern cultivars==
The tea camellia, &quot;C. sinensis&quot;, has been selected by many commercial cultivars for the taste of its leaves once processed into tea leaves.

Today, camellias are grown as ornamental plants for their flowers; about 3,000 cultivars and hybrids have been selected, many with double or semi-double flowers. &quot;C. japonica&quot; is the most prominent species in cultivation, with over 2,000 named cultivars. Next are &quot;C. reticulata&quot; with over 400 named cultivars, and &quot;C. sasanqua&quot; with over 300 named cultivars. Popular hybrids include &quot;C. × hiemalis&quot; (&quot;C. japonica&quot; × &quot;C. sasanqua&quot;) and &quot;C. × williamsii&quot; (&quot;C. japonica&quot; × &quot;C. saluenensis&quot;). Some varieties can grow considerably, up to , though more compact cultivars are available. They are frequently planted in woodland settings alongside other calcifuges, such as rhododendrons. They are particularly associated with areas of high soil acidity, such as Cornwall and Devon in the UK. They are highly valued for their very early flowering, often among the first flowers to appear in the late winter. Late frosts can damage the flower buds, resulting in misshapen flowers.

There is a great variety of flower forms:

* single (flat, bowl- or cup-shaped)
* semi-double (rows of large outer petals, with the centre comprising mixed petals and stamens)
* double:
** paeony form (convex mass of irregular petals and petaloids with hidden stamens)
** anemone form (one or more rows of outer petals, with mixed petaloids and stamens in the centre)
** rose form (overlapping petals showing stamens in a concave centre when open)
** formal double (rows of overlapping petals with hidden stamens)

===AGM cultivars===

<doc id="76101" wikidata="Q116209" url="?curid=76101" title="Silene">
<text>Silene is a genus of flowering plants in the family Caryophyllaceae. Containing nearly 900 species, it is the largest genus in the family. Common names include campion and catchfly. Many &quot;Silene&quot; species are widely distributed, particularly in the northern hemisphere.

==Scientific history==

Members of this genus have been the subject of research by preeminent plant ecologists, evolutionary biologists, and geneticists, including Charles Darwin, Gregor Mendel, Carl Correns, Herbert G. Baker, and Janis Antonovics. Many &quot;Silene&quot; species continue to be widely used to study systems, particularly in the fields of ecology and evolutionary biology. The genus has been used as a model for understanding the genetics of sex determination for over a century. &quot;Silene&quot; species commonly contain a mixture of hermaphroditic and female (or male-sterile) individuals (gynodioecy), and early studies by Correns showed that male sterility could be maternally inherited, an example of what is now known as cytoplasmic male sterility. Two independent groups of species in &quot;Silene&quot; have evolved separate male and female sexes (dioecy) with chromosomal sex determination that is analogous to the system found in humans and other mammals.

&quot;Silene&quot; flowers are frequently visited by flies, such as &quot;Rhingia campestris&quot;. &quot;Silene&quot; species have also been used to study speciation, host-pathogen interactions, biological species invasions, adaptation to heavy-metal-contaminated soils, metapopulation genetics, and organelle genome evolution. Notably, some members of the genus &quot;Silene&quot; hold the distinction of harboring the largest mitochondrial genomes ever identified.

==Taxonomy==
&quot;Silene&quot; was originally described by Linnaeus. Divisions of the genus into subgenera or sections before 2003 do not seem to be well-supported by molecular evidence.

The genus &quot;Lychnis&quot; is closely related to (and sometimes included in) &quot;Silene&quot;. When treated as a distinct genus, it can often be differentiated by the number of flower styles (five in &quot;Lychnis&#x27; and three in &quot;Silene&quot;), the number of teeth of the seed capsule (five in &quot;Lychnis&#x27; and six in &quot;Silene&quot;), and by the sticky stems of &quot;Lychnis&quot;.

=== Sexual systems ===
Sexual systems vary across species. Most &quot;Silene&quot; species are hermaphroditic representing 58.2% of &quot;Silene&quot; species, 14.3% are dioecious, 13.3% gynodioecious, and 12.2% are both gynodioecious and gynomonoecious. Trioecy, andromonoecy, and gynomonoecy have also been reported but are extremely rare.

=== Etymology ===
&quot;Silene&quot; is the feminine form of Silenus, an Ancient Greek woodland deity who was a companion and tutor to the wine god Dionysus.

== Species ==
==Ecology==
Lychnis is also the common name of &quot;Hadena bicruris&quot;, a species of noctuid moth. The larva of this moth feeds on &quot;Silene&quot; (formerly &quot;Lychnis&quot;) species, as do some other Lepidoptera including cabbage moths (recorded on &quot;Silene chalcedonica&quot;), grey chi and case-bearers of the genus &quot;Coleophora&quot; including &quot;C. albella&quot; (feeds exclusively on &quot;Silene flos-cuculi&quot;).

==Uses==
Many species of &quot;Silene&quot; are in cultivation for perennial gardens. Some have gained the Royal Horticultural Society&#x27;s Award of Garden Merit, including &quot;Silene flos-jovis&quot; and &quot;Silene schafta&quot;.

&quot;Silene undulata&quot; (syn. &quot;S. capensis&quot;) is known as &quot;iindlela zimhlophe&quot; (&quot;white paths&quot;) by the Xhosa of South Africa. A Xhosa diviner identifies and collects the plant from the wild. The roots are ground, mixed with water, and beaten to a froth, which is consumed by novice diviners during the full moon to influence their dreams. They also take it to prepare for various rituals. The root has such a strong, musky essence that the diviners who consume it exude the scent in their sweat.

&quot;Silene vulgaris&quot;, or bladder campion, is eaten in some Mediterranean countries. Young leaves may be eaten raw, and mature leaves are boiled, fried, stewed or mixed into dishes such as risotto.

==Fossil record==
Fossil †Silene microsperma seeds from the Chattian stage of the Oligocene have been found in the Oberleichtersbach Formation in the Rhön Mountains of central Germany.

<text>Aster is a genus of perennial flowering plants in the family Asteraceae. Its circumscription has been narrowed, and it now encompasses around 170 species, all but one of which are restricted to Eurasia; many species formerly in &quot;Aster&quot; are now in other genera of the tribe Astereae. &quot;Aster amellus&quot; is the type species of the genus and the family Asteraceae.

The name &quot;Aster&quot; comes from the Ancient Greek word (), meaning &#x27;star&#x27;, referring to the shape of the flower head. Many species and a variety of hybrids and varieties are popular as garden plants because of their attractive and colourful flowers. &#x27;Aster&#x27; species are used as food plants by the larvae of a number of Lepidoptera species—see list of Lepidoptera that feed on &quot;Aster&quot;. Asters can grow in all hardiness zones.

==Circumscription==
The genus &quot;Aster&quot; once contained nearly 600 species in Eurasia and North America, but after morphologic and molecular research on the genus during the 1990s, it was decided that the North American species are better treated in a series of other related genera. After this split there are roughly 180 species within the genus, all but one being confined to Eurasia.

The New World species have now been reclassified in the genera &quot;Almutaster&quot;, &quot;Canadanthus&quot;, &quot;Doellingeria&quot;, &quot;Eucephalus&quot;, &quot;Eurybia&quot;, &quot;Ionactis&quot;, &quot;Oligoneuron&quot;, &quot;Oreostemma&quot;, &quot;Sericocarpus&quot; and &quot;Symphyotrichum&quot;, though all are treated within the same tribe, Astereae. The &quot;China aster&quot; is in the related genus &quot;Callistephus&quot;. Regardless of the taxonomic change, most are still widely referred to as &quot;asters&quot;, or &quot;Michaelmas daisies&quot;, because of their typical blooming period.

==Species==

Plants of the World Online accepts 186 species as of August 2024. The species formerly known as &quot;Aster tripolium&quot; (sea aster) is now &quot;Tripolium pannonicum&quot;. The species formerly known as &quot;Aster linosyris&quot; (goldilocks) is now &quot;Galatella linosyris&quot;. Many species and a variety of hybrids and varieties are popular as garden plants because of their beautiful, attractive and colourful flowers. &quot;Aster&quot; species are used as food plants by the larvae of a number of Lepidoptera species—see list of Lepidoptera that feed on &quot;Aster&quot;. Asters can grow in all hardiness zones.

== Phytochemical Profile ==

# Flavonoids: These are commonly found in Asters and are known for their antioxidant properties. They may also impart color to the petals.
# Terpenoids: These could be responsible for the fragrance of some Aster flowers and are often studied for their potential medicinal properties. 
# Saponins: These phytochemicals create frothy solutions when agitated in water and have potential antimicrobial properties.
# Alkaloids: Though less common in Asters, if present, they could provide a range of bioactivities, including potential toxicity.
# Phenolic Compounds: These include tannins and other polyphenolic substances, which may contribute to the plant’s defense mechanisms. 

==Hybrids and cultivars==
Those marked have gained the Royal Horticultural Society&#x27;s Award of Garden Merit.

==In history==
The Hungarian revolution of 31 October 1918, became known as the &quot;Aster Revolution&quot; due to protesters in Budapest wearing this flower.

==In culture==
One of the few flowers left around Michaelmas in the British Isles is the Michaelmas daisy (another name for asters), hence the rhyme: &quot;The Michaelmas daisies, among dead weeds, Bloom for St Michael&#x27;s valorous deeds...&quot;

In the UK, national collections of asters are held at Old Court Nurseries and Picton Garden in Colwall, near Malvern, Worcestershire. and at Upton House, Warwickshire.

<text>This article lists living orders and families of birds. In total there are about 11,000 species of birds described as of 2024, though one estimate of the real number places it at almost 20,000. The order passerines (perching birds) alone accounts for well over 5,000 species.

Taxonomy is very fluid in the age of DNA analysis, so comments are made where appropriate, and all numbers are approximate. In particular see Sibley-Ahlquist taxonomy for a very different classification.

==Phylogeny==
Cladogram of modern bird relationships based on Stiller &quot;et al&quot; (2024)., showing the 44 orders recognised by the IOC.

==Subclass Palaeognathae==

The Palaeognathae or &quot;old jaws&quot; is one of the two superorders recognized within the taxonomic class Aves and consist of the ratites and tinamous. The ratites are mostly large and long-legged, flightless birds, lacking a keeled sternum. Traditionally, all the ratites were place in the order Struthioniformes. However, recent genetic analysis has found that the group is not monophyletic, as it is paraphyletic with respect to the tinamous, so the ostriches are classified as the only members of the order Struthioniformes and other ratites placed in other orders.

===Order Struthioniformes===


Africa; 2 species
* Family Struthionidae: ostrich

===Infraclass Notopalaeognathae===

====Order Rheiformes====

==Subclass Neognathae==
Nearly all living birds belong to the subclass Neognathae or &quot;new jaws&quot;. With their keeled sternum (breastbone), unlike the ratites, they are known as carinatae.

<text>Hervanta is a large suburb, or satellite city, of Tampere in Finland, located next to Hallila some 10 km south of the city centre.

Hervanta currently covers an area of 13.8 km² and is continuing to grow. Home to a population of over 26,000, Hervanta is best known for its prefabricated blocks of flats. The total number of apartments is about 11,000. Nearly a fifth of the inhabitants (some 4,500 people) are students, many of them enrolled at the Tampere University of Technology (TUT) or the Police College. The largest student housing complex is Mikontalo, in fact nearly 3% of people in Hervanta reside there. Approximately 10% of Hervanta&#x27;s population is composed of foreigners from 75 different nationalities.

Hervanta was known as a notorious neighborhood for a long time, but its reputation has improved considerably over time. It was selected as Finland&#x27;s top suburb in a survey conducted by the newspaper and published on 17 August 2003.

The complex of commercial buildings in the town center of Hervanta was designed by the Finnish architect Reima Pietilä.

==Technology==

Hervanta is sometimes called the Silicon Valley of Finland, because of the high concentration of high tech companies in the area and the presence of the Tampere University of Technology. As well as the University, Hervanta is also home to the Hermia science centre and the VTT office complex. The world&#x27;s first-ever GSM phone call was made in Hervanta in 1991, when Radiolinja started building its GSM network. Nokia, Huawei, Intel, Microsoft, and many other companies have offices in Hervanta.
==Recreation==

On the north edge of Hervanta at Lukonmäki is a downhill skiing centre with two skiing runs and one lift. The ski centre also includes a small ski jump tower that is clearly visible when entering Hervanta from the north along Hervannan valtaväylä road.

On the west side of Hervanta is located lake Suolijärvi that has a small beach for sunbathing and swimming. Around the lake goes two trails. The innermost and smaller trail goes around the lake near the shore while the outermost one makes a longer route keeping a fair distance to the lake. The longer route is linked to the trail network stretching around Tampere. The trails are used for jogging and cross-country skiing (during winter).

Hervanta has numerous small sport fields that are generally used for soccer and Finnish baseball. During winter some of the fields are frozen for ice-skating and ice hockey.

Hervanta also has a kind of a central park called Ahvenispuisto around lake Ahvenisjärvi. In southern part of Hervanta there is another big park called Näyttelijänpuisto. Näyttelijänpuisto has a disc golf track and a noteworthy hill that is used for tobogganing in winter. In addition to the two mentioned parks there are numerous smaller parks.

Hervanta has a few barbecue stalls serving popular kebab food, including &quot;Hervannan Grilli&quot;.

<text>Thurii (; ; ), called also by some Latin writers Thūrium (compare , in Ptolemy), and later in Roman times also Cōpia and Cōpiae, was an ancient Greek city situated on the Gulf of Taranto, near or on the site of the great renowned city of Sybaris, whose place it may be considered as having taken. The ruins of the city can be found in the Sybaris archaeological park near Sibari in the Province of Cosenza, Calabria, Italy.

== History ==


=== Foundation ===
Thurii was founded as a colony of Athens along with exiles from Sybaris in 443 BC. Justin writes that people say that the city of Thurii was built by Philoctetes and his monument is seen there even to his days, as well as the arrows of Hercules which laid up in the temple of Apollo. The site of that city had remained desolate for a period of 58 years after its destruction by the Crotoniats; when at length, in 452 BC, a number of the Sybarite exiles and their descendants made an attempt to establish themselves again on the spot, under the guidance of some leaders of Thessalian origin; and the new colony rose so rapidly to prosperity that it excited the jealousy of the Crotoniats, who, in consequence, expelled the new settlers a little more than 5 years after the establishment of the colony. The fugitive Sybarites first appealed for support to Sparta, but without success: their application to the Athenians was more successful, and that people determined to send out a fresh colony, at the same time that they reinstated the settlers who had been lately expelled from thence. A body of Athenian colonists was accordingly sent out by Pericles, under the command of Lampon and Xenocritus. Pericles&#x27; expressed intent was for it to be a Panhellenic colony, and the number of Athenian citizens was small, the greater part of those who took part in the colony being collected from various parts of Greece. Among them were two celebrated names: Herodotus the historian, and the orator Lysias, both of whom appear to have formed part of the original colony. Hippodamus also went out with the colonists and became the architect of the new city.

The laws of the new colony were established by the sophist Protagoras at the request of Pericles, adopting the laws of Zaleucus of Locri.

The new colonists at first established themselves on the site of the deserted Sybaris, but shortly afterwards removed (apparently in obedience to an oracle) to a spot at a short distance from thence, where there was a fountain named &quot;Thuria&quot;, from whence the new city derived its name of Thurii. The foundation of Thurii is assigned by Diodorus to the year 446 BC; but other authorities place it three years later, 443 BC, and this seems to be the best authenticated date. The protection of the Athenian name probably secured the rising colony from the assaults of the Crotoniats, at least nothing is heard of any obstacles to its progress from that quarter; but it was early disturbed by dissensions between the descendants of the original Sybarite settlers and the new colonists, the former laying claim not only to honorary distinctions, but to the exclusive possession of important political privileges. These disputes at length ended in a revolution, and the Sybarites were finally expelled from the city. They established themselves for a short time in Sybaris on the Traeis but did not maintain their footing long, being dislodged and finally dispersed by the neighboring barbarians. The Thurians meanwhile concluded a treaty of peace with Crotona, and the new city rose rapidly to prosperity. Fresh colonists poured in from all quarters, especially the Peloponnese; and though it continued to be generally regarded as an Athenian colony, the Athenians in fact formed but a small element of the population. The citizens were divided, as we learn from Diodorus, into ten tribes, the names of which sufficiently indicate their origin. They were: the Arcadian (from Arcadia), Achaean (from Achaea), Elean (from Elea), Boeotian (from Boeotia), Amphictyonic (from Amphictyonis), Dorian (from Doris), Ionian (from Ionia), Athenian (from Athens), Euboean (from Euboea), and Nesiotic (from the islands). The form of government was democratic, and the city is said to have enjoyed the advantage of a well-ordered system of laws; but the statement of Diodorus, who represents this as owing to the legislation of Charondas, and that lawgiver himself as a citizen of Thurii, is certainly erroneous. The city itself was laid out with great regularity, being divided by four broad streets or plateae, each of which was crossed in like manner by three others.

=== War and conflict ===
Very shortly after its foundation, Thurii became involved in a war with Tarentum (modern Taranto). The subject of this was the possession of the fertile district of the Siritis, about 50 km north of Thurii, to which the Athenians had a claim of long standing, which was naturally taken up by their colonists. The Spartan general, Cleandridas, who had been banished from Greece some years before, and taken up his abode at Thurii, became the general of the Thurians in this war, which, after various successes, was at length terminated by a compromise, both parties agreeing to the foundation of the new colony of Heracleia in the disputed territory.

Knowledge of the history of Thurii is very scanty and fragmentary. Fresh disputes arising between the Athenian citizens and the other colonists were at length allayed by the oracle of Delphi, which decided that the city had no other founder than Apollo. But the same difference appears again on occasion of the great Athenian expedition to Sicily, when the city was divided into two parties, the one desirous of favoring and supporting the Athenians, the other opposed to them. The latter faction at first prevailed, so far that the Thurians observed the same neutrality towards the Athenian fleet under Nicias and Alcibiades as the other cities of Italy. Thurii was, in fact, the city where Alcibiades escaped his Athenian captors who were taking him home for trial.

But two years afterwards (413 BC) the Athenian party had regained the ascendency; and when Demosthenes and Eurymedon touched at Thurii, the citizens afforded them every assistance, and even furnished an auxiliary force of 700 hoplites and 300 dartmen. From this time we hear nothing of Thurii for a period of more than 20 years, though there is reason to believe that this was just the time of its greatest prosperity. In 390 BC we find that its territory was already beginning to suffer from the incursions of the Lucanians, a new and formidable enemy, for protection against whom all the cities of Magna Graecia had entered into a defensive league. But the Thurians were too impatient to wait for the support of their allies, and issued forth with an army of 14,000 foot and 1000 horse, with which they repulsed the attacks of the Lucanians; but having rashly followed them into their own territory, they were totally defeated, near Laüs, and above 10,000 of them cut to pieces.

This defeat must have inflicted a severe blow on the prosperity of Thurii, while the continually increasing power of the Lucanians and Bruttians in their immediate neighbourhood would prevent them from quickly recovering from its effects. The city continued also to be on hostile, or at least unfriendly, terms with Dionysius of Syracuse, and was in consequence chosen as a place of retirement or exile by his brother Leptines and his friend Philistus. The rise of the Bruttian people about 356 BC probably became the cause of the complete decline of Thurii, but the statement of Diodorus that the city was conquered by that people must be received with considerable doubt.

It reappears in history at a later period, when Corinthian soldiers en route to join Timoleon on his expedition to Syracuse are blockaded there by Carthaginian ships. At this point it was still an independent Greek city, though much fallen from its former greatness. No mention of it is found during the wars of Alexander of Epirus in this part of Italy.

Later it was so hard pressed by the Lucanians that it had recourse to alliance with Rome and a Roman army was sent to its relief under Gaius Fabricius Luscinus in 282 BC. He defeated the Lucanians and Bruttians, who had laid siege to the city, in a pitched battle and several other successes broke their power, and thus relieved the Thurians from all immediate danger from that quarter. But shortly after they were attacked on the other side by the Tarentines, who are said to have taken and plundered their city; and this aggression was one of the immediate causes of the war declared by the Romans against Tarentum in 282 BC.

=== Roman dependency ===
Thurii became a dependent ally of Rome, and was protected by a Roman garrison. 

It played a considerable part in the Second Punic War with Hannibal. It was one of the cities which defected to the Carthaginians after the battle of Cannae in 212 BC. After the defection of Tarentum, they betrayed the Roman troops into the hands of the Carthaginian general Hanno. A few years later (210 BC), Hannibal, finding himself unable to protect his allies in Campania, removed the inhabitants of Atella who had survived the fall of their city to Thurii; but it was not long before he was compelled to abandon the latter city also to its fate. When he himself in 204 BC withdrew his forces into Bruttium, he removed to Crotona 3500 of the principal citizens of Thurii, while he gave up the city itself to the plunder of his troops. 

It is evident that Thurii was now sunk to the lowest state of decay, but the great fertility of its territory rendered it desirable to preserve it from utter desolation. Hence in 194 BC, it was one of the places selected for the establishment of a Roman colony with Latin rights. The number of colonists was small in proportion to the extent of land to be divided among them, but they amounted to 3000 foot and 300 knights. Livy says merely that the colony was sent in &quot;Thurinum agrum&quot;, but Strabo tells us that the Romans gave the new colony the name of Copiae, as confirmed both by Stephanus of Byzantium and by the evidence of coins, on which, however, the name is written &quot;COPIA&quot;. But this new name did not continue long in use, and Thurii still continued to be known by its ancient appellation. It is mentioned as a municipal town on several occasions during the latter ages of the Roman Republic. In 72 BC it was taken by Spartacus and subjected to heavy contributions but not otherwise injured. According to Suetonius, the Octavian family held some renown there, and Gaius Octavius (father of the future Caesar Augustus) defeated a Spartacist army near there. As a result, the future emperor was granted the surname Thurinus shortly after birth. At the outbreak of the Civil Wars, it was deemed by Julius Caesar of sufficient importance to be secured with a garrison of Gaulish and Spanish horse, and it was there that M. Caelius Rufus was put to death, after a vain attempt to excite an insurrection in this part of Italy. In 40 BC also it was attacked by Sextus Pompeius, who laid waste its territory, but he was repulsed from the walls of the city.

Thurii was at this time still a place of some importance, and it is mentioned as an existing town by Pliny and Ptolemy, as well as Strabo. It was probably, indeed, the only place of any consideration remaining on the coast of the Tarentine gulf between Crotona and Tarentum; both Metapontum and Heracleia having already fallen into almost complete decay. Its name is still found in the Itineraries, and it is noticed by Procopius as still existing in the 6th century.

=== Abandonment ===
Over time, the sediment accretion of the Crathis river caused its river delta to shift towards the sea at a long term rate of one metre a year. As a consequence the successive sites of Sybaris, Thurii, and Copia became landlocked and lost their importance because they no longer had easy access to the sea for trade. It seems to have been abandoned during the Middle Ages when the inhabitants took refuge at a place called Terranova (Terranova da Sibari), about 15 km inland, on a hill on the left bank of the Crathis.

The exact location of Greek Thurii is not known but that of the Roman town, which probably occupied the same site, is fixed by several ruins as being about 6 km to the east of Terranova da Sibari and as occupying an area some 6 km in circuit. It is clear from the statements of Diodorus and Strabo that Thurii occupied a site near to, but distinct from, that of Sybaris. It is more likely that the true site is north of the Coscile (the ancient Sybaris), a few kilometers from the sea, where ruins still exist. Roman ruins on the peninsula formed by the rivers Crathis and Sybaris may also perhaps be those of Thurii.

== The site ==
One house stands out by size and decoration: the large &quot;domus&quot; located behind the Theatre, undoubtedly one of the most sumptuous private buildings in the Roman city. It was built in the late Republican era (1st century BC) and survived until the 5th century AD through a series of expansions and transformations that gradually modified the layout. The monumentality and the splendour of the house reached their peak between the 1st and 3rd centuries AD while from the 4th are tangible signs of a decline.

== Coinage ==

Thurii had an active mint in antiquity. The coins of Thurii are of great beauty; their number and variety indeed gives us a higher idea of the opulence and prosperity of the city than we should gather from the statements of ancient writers.

== Famous people ==
* Alexis (ancient comic poet)
* Herodotus, who migrated to Thurii from Athens after 443 BC.
* Lysias, who migrated to Thurii from Athens c. 430 BC.

<text>A flip clock (also known as a &quot;flap clock&quot;) is an electromechanical, digital time keeping device with the time indicated by numbers that are sequentially revealed by a split-flap display. The study, collection and repair of flip clocks is termed horopalettology (from horology – the study and measurement of time and palette – and the Italian &quot;orologio a palette&quot; – Italian for &quot;flip clock&quot;).

==Method of operation==

An electric motor (often synchronous, if directly connected to the AC line) turns two sets of wheels continuously via a reduction gear train: the faster at a rate of 1 revolution per hour, the slower at a rate of 1 revolution per 24 hours. The wheels move continuously, not in steps.
The faster wheel has connected to it a ring of 60 flat plastic leaves. On the leaves are printed numerals so that, when a person holds two adjacent leaves apart like an open book, the two open leaves spell out a numeral, and flipping a leaf down increases the number shown by 1 unit. The &quot;book&quot; is opened vertically, and its pages form a ring. This ring is put into position and rotated so that one page falls each minute, showing a new number for the minutes.

The slower wheel has connected to it a similar ring of leaves, only there are 48 leaves on this ring. These leaves have hour numbers printed on them. There are two of each hour, like this: 12am, 12am, 1am, 1am, 2am, 2am, ... 11pm, 11pm in a 12-hour clock, and 0, 0, 1, 1, 2, 2, ... 23, 23 in a 24-hour clock. Having two sets of leaves for each hour also allows the clock to alternate between 12- and 24-hour display, every half hour, like this: 12am, 0h, 1am, 1h, 2am, 2h, ... 11pm, 23h. One leaf falls each half-hour, at approximately 25 and 55 minutes after the hour. A different design features 60 leaves with the numbers 1 to 12 repeated in fives, each leaf falling after 12 minutes. The disadvantage of this is that 24-hour clocks cannot use this design, nor there is a way to show &quot;AM&quot; or &quot;PM&quot; information in a 12-hour design.

Minute leaves 45 through 59 have a small tooth on their left edges, pointing toward the hour leaves. The purpose of this tooth is as follows: at 45 minutes after the hour, the tooth pushes a small hook that protrudes into the hour wheel area. This hook will catch any falling hour leaf (as mentioned above, it falls from its metal tab a few minutes before the hour) until it is released by the minute leaf&#x27;s fall at the top of the hour.

== Daylight saving time ==
Many vintage digital clocks with split flap displays cannot be wound back, as the flip mechanism operates only in one direction. Instead they must be either wound forward 23 hours to achieve the effect of winding back 1 hour at the end of daylight saving time or the clock may be stopped (by disconnecting it from power) for 1 hour. However, on some newer clocks, forward and backward time setting is possible. GE clocks sometimes had this feature.

<doc id="76133" wikidata="Q223177" url="?curid=76133" title="Casper, Wyoming">
<text>Casper is a city in and the county seat of Natrona County, Wyoming, United States. Casper is the second-most populous city in the state after Cheyenne, with the population at 59,038 as of the 2020 census. Casper is nicknamed &quot;The Oil City&quot; and has a long history of oil boomtown and cowboy culture, dating back to the development of the nearby Salt Creek Oil Field.

Casper is in east central Wyoming, on the North Platte River.

==History==
Casper was established east of the former site of Fort Caspar, in an area that attracted European settlers during the mid-19th century mass migration of land seekers along the Oregon, California, and Mormon trails, where several nearby ferries offered passage across the North Platte River in the early 1840s. In 1859, Louis Guinard built a bridge and trading post near the original ferry locations, allowing overland travel to continue through the area.

The government also posted the military garrison to protect telegraph and mail service. It was under the command of Lieutenant Colonel William O. Collins. Native American attacks increased after the 1864 Sand Creek Massacre in Colorado, bringing more troops to the post, which was by now called Platte Bridge Station. In July 1865, a group of Indian warriors killed Collins&#x27;s son Caspar Collins near the post, and three months later the garrison was renamed Fort Caspar in his honor. 

In 1867, the troops were ordered to abandon Fort Caspar in favor of Fort Fetterman, downstream on the North Platte along the Bozeman Trail. But the town itself was settled in 1887, and incorporated a year later by developers as an anticipated stopping point during the Wyoming Central Railway&#x27;s expansion. 

A site a few miles east was planned as the original site, where homesteader Joshua Stroud lived before the construction of the station for the Chicago and North Western Railway. The Pioneer Town Site Company laid out the site in 1888 and it was known as Strouds, but the name Casper soon prevailed. While the name is derived from Fort Caspar and Caspar Collins, it is named &quot;Casper&quot; due to a typo during the official registration.

Casper was an early commercial rival to both Bessemer and Douglas, Wyoming. The absence of a railhead doomed Bessemer in favor of Casper, while Douglas, also a railhead, survives. This rail presence also made Casper the starting point for the &quot;invaders&quot; in the Johnson County War, since the chartered train carrying the men from Texas stopped at Casper. 

Casper received a significant influx of visitors during the solar eclipse of August 21, 2017, due to its position along the path of totality.

==Geography==

Interstate 25, which approaches Casper from the north and east, is the main avenue of transportation to and from the city. The towns immediately adjacent to Casper are Mills, Evansville, and Bar Nunn. Unincorporated areas include Allendale, Dempsey Acres, Red Buttes, and Indian Springs.

Normal daily maxima range from in January to in July. Snow can fall heavily during the winter and early to mid-spring months, and usually falls in May and October. Precipitation is greatest in spring and early summer, but even then is not high. Highs reach on 37.8 days per year and fail to surpass freezing on 41.3. Lows drop to on an average of 14.6 nights annually. The highest temperature recorded in Casper was on July 12, 1954; July 16, 2005; and July 29, 2006; the lowest was on December 22, 2022.

After the discovery of crude oil in the region during the 1890s, Casper became the regional petroleum industry center. Oil has figured prominently in its history from nearly the outset. It was first discovered in the Salt Creek Oil Field in 1889, about north of Casper; the first refinery in Casper was built in 1895. The city has featured a refinery ever since, with various refineries built and closed over the years. As recently as the early 1980s, the city was near or home to three refineries. The surviving one, operated by Sinclair Oil Corporation, is in nearby Evansville. Development of Wyoming coal and uranium fields in recent decades has helped Casper continue its role as a center in the energy industry.

<text>Hydrangea ( or ), commonly named the hortensia, is a genus of more than 70 species of flowering plants native to Asia and the Americas. By far the greatest species diversity is in eastern Asia, notably China, Korea, and Japan. Most are shrubs tall, but some are small trees, and others lianas reaching up to by climbing up trees. They can be either deciduous or evergreen, though the widely cultivated temperate species are all deciduous.

The flowers of many hydrangea act as natural pH indicators, sporting blue flowers when the soil is acidic and pink ones when the soil is alkaline.

==Etymology==
&quot;Hydrangea&quot; is derived from Greek and means ‘water vessel’ (from &quot;húdōr&quot; &quot;water&quot; + &quot;ángos&quot; or &quot;angeîon&quot; &quot;vessel&quot;), in reference to the shape of its seed capsules. The earlier name, &quot;Hortensia&quot;, is a Latinised version of the French given name Hortense, honoring French astronomer and mathematician Nicole-Reine Hortense Lepaute. Philibert Commerson attempted to name the flower &quot;Lepautia&quot; or &quot;Peautia&quot; after Lepaute. However, the flower&#x27;s accepted name later became &quot;Hortensia&quot;. This led to people believing Lepaute&#x27;s name was Hortense, but the Larousse remarks that this is erroneous, and that the name probably came from &quot;hortus&quot;, garden.

==Life cycle==
&quot;Hydrangea&quot; flowers are produced from early spring to late autumn; they grow in flowerheads (corymbs or panicles) most often at the ends of the stems. Typically the flowerheads contain two types of flowers: small non-showy fertile flowers in the center or interior of the flowerhead, and large, sterile showy flowers with large colorful sepals (tepals). These showy flowers are often extended in a ring, or to the exterior of the small flowers. Plants in wild populations typically have few to none of the showy flowers, while cultivated hydrangeas have been bred and selected to have more of the larger type flowers.

There are two flower arrangements in hydrangeas with corymb style inflorescences, which includes the commonly grown &quot;bigleaf hydrangea&quot;—&quot;Hydrangea macrophylla&quot;. Mophead flowers are large round flowerheads resembling pom-poms or, as the name implies, the head of a mop. In contrast, lacecap flowers bear round, flat flowerheads with a center core of subdued, small flowers surrounded by outer rings of larger flowers having showy sepals or tepals. The flowers of some rhododendrons and viburnums can appear, at first glance, similar to those of some hydrangeas.

Hydrangea flowers, when cut, dehydrate easily and wilt very quickly due to the large surface area of the petals. A wilted hydrangea may have its hydration restored by first having its stem immersed in boiling water; as the petals of the hydrangea can also absorb water, the petals may then be immersed, in room-temperature water, to restore the flower&#x27;s hydration. 

==Colors and soil acidity==
Hydrangea flower color can change based on the pH in soil. As the graph depicts, soil with a pH of 5.5 or lower will produce blue flowers, a pH of 6.5 or higher will produce pink hydrangeas, and soil in between 5.5 and 6.5 will have purple hydrangeas. White hydrangeas cannot be color-manipulated by soil pH because they do not produce pigment for color. In other words, while the hue of the inflorescence is variable dependent upon cultural factors, the color saturation is genetically predetermined. In most species, the flowers are white. In some, however, (notably &quot;H. macrophylla&quot;), they can be blue, red, or purple, with color saturation levels ranging from the palest of pinks, lavenders &amp; powder blues, to deep, rich purples, reds, and royal blues. In these species, floral color change occurs due to the availability of aluminium ions, a variable which itself depends upon the soil pH. For &quot;H. macrophylla&quot; and &quot;H. serrata&quot; cultivars, the flower color can be determined by the relative acidity of the soil: an acidic soil (pH below 7), will have available aluminum ions and typically produce flowers that are blue to purple, whereas an alkaline soil (pH above 7) will tie up aluminium ions and result in pink or red flowers. This is caused by a color change of the flower pigments in the presence of aluminium ions which can be taken up into hyperaccumulating plants.

==Fossil record==

&quot;Hydrangea alaskana&quot; is a fossil species recovered from Paleogene strata at Jaw Mountain Alaska. †&quot;Hydrangea knowltoni&quot; has been described from leaves and flowers recovered from the Miocene Langhian Latah Formation of the inland Pacific Northwest United states. The related Miocene species †&quot;Hydrangea bendirei&quot; is known to from the Mascall Formation in Oregon, and †&quot;Hydrangea reticulata&quot; is documented from the Weaverville Formation in California.

Four fossil seeds of †&quot;Hydrangea polonica&quot; have been extracted from borehole samples of the Middle Miocene fresh water deposits in Nowy Sacz Basin, West Carpathians, Poland.

==Cultivation and uses==
Hydrangeas are popular ornamental plants, grown for their large flowerheads, with &quot;Hydrangea macrophylla&quot; being by far the most widely grown. It has over 600 named cultivars, many selected to have only large sterile flowers in the flowerheads. &quot;Hydrangea macrophylla&quot;, also known as bigleaf hydrangea, can be broken up into two main categories; mophead hydrangea and lacecap hydrangea. Some are best pruned on an annual basis when the new leaf buds begin to appear. If not pruned regularly, the bush will become very &quot;leggy&quot;, growing upwards until the weight of the stems is greater than their strength, at which point the stems will sag down to the ground and possibly break. Other species only flower on &quot;old wood&quot;. Thus, new wood resulting from pruning will not produce flowers until the following season.

The following cultivars and species have gained the Royal Horticultural Society&#x27;s Award of Garden Merit under the synonym &quot;Schizophragma&quot;: 
*&quot;S. hydrangeoides&quot; var. &quot;concolor&quot; &#x27;Moonlight&#x27; 
*&quot;S. hydrangeoides&quot; var. &quot;hydrangeoides&quot; &#x27;Roseum&#x27;
*&quot;S. integrifolium&quot;

Hydrangea root and rhizome are indicated for the treatment of conditions of the urinary tract in the Physicians&#x27; Desk Reference for Herbal Medicine and may have diuretic properties. Hydrangeas are moderately toxic if eaten, with all parts of the plant containing cyanogenic glycosides. &quot;Hydrangea paniculata&quot; is reportedly sometimes smoked as an intoxicant, despite the danger of illness and/or death due to the cyanide.

The flowers on a hydrangea shrub can change from blue to pink or from pink to blue from one season to the next depending on the acidity level of the soil. Adding organic materials such as coffee grounds and citrus peel will increase acidity and turn hydrangea flowers blue.
A popular pink hydrangea called Vanilla Strawberry has been named &quot;Top Plant&quot; by the American Nursery and Landscape Association.

A hybrid &quot;Runaway Bride Snow White&quot;, from Japan, won &quot;Plant of the Year&quot; at the 2018 RHS Chelsea Flower Show.

===In culture===
In Japan, &quot;ama-cha&quot; (), meaning sweet tea, is another herbal tea made from &quot;Hydrangea serrata&quot;, whose leaves contain a substance that develops a sweet taste (phyllodulcin). For the fullest taste, fresh leaves are crumpled, steamed, and dried, yielding dark brown tea leaves. Ama-cha is mainly used for &quot;kan-butsu-e&quot; (the Buddha bathing ceremony) on April 8 every year—the day thought to be Buddha&#x27;s birthday in Japan. During the ceremony, ama-cha is poured over a statue of Buddha and served to people in attendance. A legend has it that on the day Buddha was born, nine dragons poured Amrita over him; ama-cha is substituted for Amrita in Japan.

In Korean tea, &quot;Hydrangea serrata&quot; is used for an herbal tea called &quot;sugukcha&quot; () or &quot;isulcha&quot; ().

The pink hydrangea has risen in popularity all over the world, especially in Asia. The given meaning of pink hydrangeas is popularly tied to the phrase &quot;you are the beat of my heart,&quot; as described by the celebrated Korean florist Tan Jun Yong, who was quoted saying, &quot;The light delicate blush of the petals reminds me of a beating heart, while the size could only match the heart of the sender!&quot;

&quot;Hydrangea quercifolia&quot; was declared the official state wildflower of the U.S. state of Alabama in 1999.

Hydrangeas were used by the Cherokee people of what is now the Southern U.S. A mild diuretic and cathartic, it was considered a valuable remedy for stone and gravel in the bladder.
