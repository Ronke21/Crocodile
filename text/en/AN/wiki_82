<text>William Alison Anders (17 October 1933 – 7 June 2024) was an American United States Air Force (USAF) major general, electrical engineer, nuclear engineer, NASA astronaut, and businessman. In December 1968, he was a member of the crew of Apollo 8, the first three people to leave low-Earth orbit and travel to the Moon. Along with fellow astronauts Frank Borman and Jim Lovell, he circled the Moon ten times, and broadcast live images and commentary back to Earth, including the Christmas Eve Genesis reading. During one of the mission&#x27;s lunar orbits, he took the iconic &quot;Earthrise&quot; photograph.

A 1955 graduate of the United States Naval Academy, Anders was commissioned a second lieutenant in the USAF the same year and became a fighter pilot flying Northrop F-89 Scorpions equipped with AIR-2A nuclear-tipped air-to-air rockets. He hoped to study aeronautical engineering through the Air Force Institute of Technology (AFIT) of Air University, but the Aircraft Nuclear Propulsion program was ongoing, and he had to study nuclear engineering instead. He graduated from the AFIT in 1962 with a Master of Science degree in nuclear engineering and was sent to the Air Force Weapons Laboratory, where he managed the technical aspects of the USAF nuclear power reactor programs.

Anders was the executive secretary of the National Aeronautics and Space Council from 1969 to 1973, a commissioner of the United States Atomic Energy Commission from 1973 to 1975, and chairman of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission from 1975 to 1976. He then became the United States Ambassador to Norway from 1976 to 1977. In September 1977, he joined General Electric (GE) as the vice president and general manager of its Nuclear Products Division and became the general manager of the GE Aircraft Equipment Division in 1980. He left GE to join Textron as executive vice president for aerospace, and two years later became senior executive vice president for operations. During his time in the Civil Service, he remained a USAF reserve officer and retained his active flight status. He retired from the reserve as a major general in 1988. In 1990, he became vice chairman of General Dynamics, and in 1991 its chairman and CEO. He retired as CEO in 1993 and as chairman in 1994.

Anders died in a crash of his Beechcraft T-34 Mentor in June 2024 near the San Juan Islands.

== Early life ==
William Alison Anders was born in Hong Kong on 17 October 1933, the son of Arthur F. Anders, a United States Navy lieutenant, and his wife, Muriel . The family moved from Hong Kong to Annapolis, Maryland, where his father taught mathematics at the U.S. Naval Postgraduate School. After Annapolis, Anders&#x27; father received orders to billet in Nanjing, China. After the family moved there, the Second Sino-Japanese War erupted in 1937, followed by Japan invading China. In December of that year, his father was serving as the executive officer of the river gunboat when he was wounded as the ship was attacked and sunk by Japanese bombers. As the Japanese began to advance toward Nanjing, Anders and his mother fled by taking a train to Guangzhou.

From the porch of the Guangzhou hotel in which they stayed, they could see Japanese aircraft bombing ships on the Pearl River away. This was ominous since the river was their only means of escape. In addition to the threat of Japanese aircraft, the river was mined and there was the danger of being boarded by bandits. Foreigners were allocated special areas on the boat and separated from Chinese people by barbed wire. They eventually reached the Philippines, where they awaited news of his father. Arthur Anders was rescued by the British and sent to San Diego Naval Hospital to recover from his wounds and a staphylococcal infection. He was awarded the Purple Heart and the Navy Cross but was discharged from the Navy owing to his wounds. He was recalled to active duty during World War II.

The family returned to the United States, where Anders was active in the Boy Scouts, achieving the organization&#x27;s second-highest rank, Life Scout. As a teen, Anders attended St Martin&#x27;s Academy and Grossmont High School in El Cajon, California. To improve his grades so that he could be accepted at the United States Naval Academy in Annapolis, Maryland, Anders was sent to the Boyden School, a military academy prep school in downtown San Diego. He commuted to Boyden by bus from La Mesa, California. The school lay under the flight path into Lindbergh Field and aircraft such as the huge Convair B-36 Peacemaker would fly low over the school. He was fascinated with flight and built model aircraft. He graduated from Boyden in 1951.

== United States Air Force ==
Anders received an appointment to Annapolis, following in the footsteps of his father, who had graduated with the Class of 1927. He earned a Bachelor of Science degree in electrical engineering in 1955. Part of the course was orientation cruises during which midshipmen could experience life at sea. A cruise on board an aircraft carrier convinced him that he did not want to become a naval aviator: there were too many fatal accidents. Upon graduation in 1955 he chose to be commissioned a second lieutenant in the United States Air Force (USAF). While at Annapolis he met Valerie Elizabeth Hoard on a blind date. Midshipmen were not allowed to marry, but they were married soon after he graduated. They had six children — Alan (born in 1957), Glen (born in 1958), Gayle (born in 1960), Gregory (born in 1962), Eric (born in 1964) and Diana (born in 1972).

After graduation, Anders reported for flight training, which was conducted in the piston-engine Beechcraft T-34 Mentor and North American T-28 Trojan and then in the jet Lockheed T-33 Shooting Star. After receiving his pilot wings in 1956 he became a fighter pilot with the 84th Fighter-Interceptor Squadron, an all-weather interceptor squadron of the Air Defense Command based at Hamilton Air Force Base in California, flying Northrop F-89 Scorpions equipped with MB-1 nuclear-tipped air-to-air rockets. He then served with the 57th Fighter-Interceptor Squadron in Iceland, where he participated in intercepts of Soviet heavy bombers, which were challenging America&#x27;s air defense borders. After a year he returned to the 84th Fighter-Interceptor Squadron at Hamilton, which was now flying the McDonnell F-101 Voodoo.

Anders set his sights on becoming a test pilot. He spoke to Chuck Yeager, who recommended that he first obtain an advanced degree. Anders submitted an application to the Air Force Institute of Technology (AFIT) at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base in Ohio, hoping to study aeronautical engineering, but the Aircraft Nuclear Propulsion program was ongoing, and the AFIT had him study nuclear engineering instead. While there he took a course in aeronautical engineering at Ohio State University. He graduated from the AFIT with a Master of Science degree in nuclear engineering in 1962. By that time the Aircraft Nuclear Propulsion program had been canceled so he was assigned to the Air Force Weapons Laboratory at Kirtland Air Force Base in New Mexico, where he was responsible for the technical management of the nuclear power reactor programs.

=== Selection and training ===
Anders now applied to the USAF Aerospace Research Pilots School (ARPS) for test pilot training, but on 5 June 1963, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) announced that it would be recruiting ten to fifteen new astronauts for Project Gemini and Project Apollo, and Anders decided to apply for that too. In two previous astronaut selections, applicants had to be test pilots, but this time it was preferred but not required, making Anders eligible. He was one of the 34 finalists chosen for interviews, and on his birthday, 17 October 1963, he was informed by Mercury Seven astronaut Deke Slayton that he had been accepted as a member of the third group of NASA astronauts. Three days later, Yeager informed him that he had failed to make the cut for the ARPS but recommended that he apply again the following year.

While at NASA, he became involved in dosimetry, radiation effects, and environmental controls. In September 1966, he was the backup pilot for the Gemini 11 mission, with Neil Armstrong as the backup commander. This would have put him in line to fly a Gemini 13 mission, but no such mission was flown; Project Gemini ended with Gemini 12. Armstrong and Anders then became the first astronauts to fly the Lunar Landing Training Vehicle. The astronauts in his group without test pilot training—Anders, Roger B. Chaffee, Walter Cunningham, Rusty Schweickart, Gene Cernan, and Buzz Aldrin—were assigned to Apollo crews as the Lunar Module pilot (LMP), the lowest-ranking crew member.

=== Apollo 8 ===

On 22 December 1966, Anders was assigned to the third Apollo mission, which was to be commanded by Frank Borman, with command module pilot (CMP) Michael Collins; Neil Armstrong, Jim Lovell and Buzz Aldrin were assigned as their backup crew the following year. Collins was replaced by Lovell in July 1968, after suffering a cervical disc herniation that required surgery to repair. The mission, scheduled for December 1968, was intended to be a second test of the Apollo Lunar Module (LM) in medium Earth orbit, but the delivery of the LM fell behind schedule, and when it arrived at the Kennedy Space Center (KSC) in June 1968, more than a hundred significant defects were discovered. There was no prospect of it being ready to fly in 1968. In August 1968, there were reports, including one from the CIA, that the Soviet Union was planning a crewed circumlunar mission before the end of the year.

Although the LM would not be ready to fly in December 1968, the Apollo command and service module (CSM) would be, so a CSM-only mission could be flown. It could be sent to the Moon, entering lunar orbit before returning to Earth. Slayton asked James McDivitt, the designated commander of the second mission, if he still wanted to fly it. McDivitt turned it down; his crew had spent a great deal of time preparing to test the LM, and that was what he still wanted to do. When Borman was asked the same question, he answered &quot;yes&quot; without any hesitation. Slayton then decided to swap the crews and spacecraft, so Borman, Lovell, and Anders&#x27; mission became Apollo 8. Anders was less enthusiastic about being the Lunar Module pilot of a mission without a Lunar Module.

According to Borman:

==== Earthrise ====

In December 1968, Anders flew on the Apollo 8 mission, the first mission where humans traveled beyond low-Earth orbit, and the first crewed flight to reach and orbit the Moon. When the spacecraft came out from behind the Moon for its fourth pass across the front, the crew witnessed an &quot;Earthrise&quot; for the first time in human history. NASA&#x27;s Lunar Orbiter 1 had taken the first picture of an Earthrise from the vicinity of the Moon, on 23 August 1966.

Anders saw the Earth emerging from behind the lunar horizon and called in excitement to the others, taking a black-and-white photograph as he did so. Anders asked Lovell for color film and then took &quot;Earthrise&quot;, which was later picked by &quot;Life&quot; magazine as one of its hundred photos of the century. Anders reflected on the lasting impact of the Earthrise photograph, noting that it gained iconic status over time and helped people realize the need to take care of our fragile planet. He remarked on the photograph&#x27;s message for humanity, highlighting the contrast between our only home and the conflicts, including nuclear threats and terrorism, that we face. &quot;It amazes me.&quot;
According to Anders:

On conservation of the planet, he said:
The Apollo 8 command module splashed down in the Pacific Ocean on 27 December after a flight lasting 147 hours and 42 seconds and a voyage of . It landed just from the recovery ship, the aircraft carrier . Due to time dilation, the three astronauts had aged about 300 microseconds more than people back on Earth.

=== Apollo 11 ===
The July 1969 Apollo 11 mission was commanded by Armstrong, with Collins as the CMP and Aldrin as the LMP. The Apollo 8 crew became its backup, but without Borman. Lovell stepped up to become the backup commander, and Anders became the backup CMP, with rookie astronaut Fred Haise as the backup LMP.

== NASC, AEC, and NRC ==
Anders could see that Project Apollo was coming to a close and felt that his chances of commanding a Moon mission were slim. On 16 May 1969, President Richard Nixon nominated him to become the executive secretary of the National Aeronautics and Space Council (NASC). This was the highest government post ever offered to an astronaut up to that time. He was confirmed by the United States Senate on 19 June. The Space Council consisted of the Administrator of NASA, the Chairman of the Atomic Energy Commission (AEC), and the Secretaries of State, Defense, and Transportation, and was chaired by the Vice President. Due to his commitment to the Apollo 11 backup crew, Anders was unable to assume the position until August.
In his new role, Anders was responsible for developing aeronautical and space policy. He worked closely with the Office of Science and Technology (OST) and the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and became a personal advisor to the OMB director, Caspar Weinberger. Anders worked hard to bridge the gap between OMB and OST on the one hand and NASA on the other. He became increasingly pessimistic about the future of the NASC and the space program generally. He opposed the development of the Space Shuttle, urging instead that NASA concentrate on developing the Skylab space station. He argued that a small Space Shuttle would be a better option than a large one, but the large one was approved because it would involve more jobs in California. Frustrated with the NASC&#x27;s lack of influence, he recommended in 1972 that it be abolished. This was done on 30 June 1973.

Nixon was impressed by Anders and wanted to retain him in the administration. On 6 August 1973, he appointed Anders to the five-member AEC. Nixon felt that the commission was dominated by lawyers and he wanted an engineer on it. The chairman of the AEC, Dixy Lee Ray, appointed Anders to be the lead commissioner for nuclear and non-nuclear power research and development. He also served as the U.S. chairman of the joint US-Soviet Union nuclear fission and fusion power technology exchange program. He spent much of his time dealing with the AEC&#x27;s problematic research and development programs, particularly the troubled breeder reactor program.

One issue that had dogged the AEC since its inception was its dual role in both developing nuclear energy and regulating it. The perception that there was a conflict of interest between the two roles became acute with the growth of the nuclear power industry. On 19 January 1975, the commission was split in two, with its research and development responsibilities assumed by the Energy Research and Development Administration (ERDA), and its regulatory ones by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC). Some 1,970 former employees of the AEC joined the NRC. President Gerald Ford appointed Anders as the first chairman of the NRC. He was the only one of the five AEC commissioners to transition to one of the new organizations. Anders made the decision process of the commissioners of the NRC more transparent than that of the AEC. The NRC inherited nuclear safety and environmental compatibility functions from the AEC, but unlike the AEC&#x27;s regulatory branch, the NRC had its own safety and security research capability, so it was not reliant on the ERDA.

After his term as NRC chairman, Anders was asked if he would be interested in an ambassadorship. He did not want to, but asked his wife Valerie. She expressed an interest in Norway, based on their trip there during the Apollo 8 world publicity tour. So Anders asked if Norway was available. Lawrence Eagleburger submitted his name for the position. Anders was appointed Ambassador to Norway on 13 April 1976 and held that post until 18 June 1977.

== Private sector ==
Anders served briefly as a fellow of the American Enterprise Institute. In September 1977, he joined General Electric (GE) as its vice president and general manager of its Nuclear Products Division. Based in San Jose, California, Anders was responsible for the fuel, equipment, and instrumentation used in its boiling water reactors in San Jose and Wilmington, North Carolina. He also oversaw GE&#x27;s partnership with Chicago Bridge &amp; Iron Company, which manufactured large steel pressure vessels in Memphis, Tennessee. In August 1979, GE sent him to Harvard Business School to attend its six-week Advanced Management Program. On 1 January 1980, he became the general manager of the GE Aircraft Equipment Division. From its headquarters in Utica, New York, the division controlled more than 8,500 employees in five locations in the northeastern United States. Its products included aircraft flight and weapon control systems, cockpit instruments, aircraft electrical generating systems, airborne radars and data processing systems, electronic countermeasures, space command systems, and aircraft/surface multi-barrel armament systems.

In 1984, Anders left GE to join Textron as its executive vice president for aerospace. Two years later he became senior executive vice president for operations, but Anders did not get along well with the CEO. A perk of the job was that he got to fly Bell helicopters, as Bell was a subsidiary of Textron. During his time in the civil service, Anders had remained in the Air Force as a reservist and had retained his active flight status flying NASA Northrop T-38 Talon aircraft and helicopters, retiring from the reserves as a major general in 1988. He was also a consultant to the U.S. Office of Science and Technology Policy, and a member of the Defense Science Board and the NASA Advisory Council.

===General Dynamics board===
Anders became vice chairman of General Dynamics in January 1990, and on 1 January 1991, its chairman and CEO. Soon after he took over as CEO, the company lost $700 million (equivalent to $ billion in ) in write-offs over the canceled A-12 Avenger II program. The January 1991 cancelation directly caused about 3,500 employees to be laid-off at the Fort Worth, Texas plant that built the A-12. On 19 June 1991, Anders announced that General Dynamics was moving its corporate headquarters from St. Louis, Missouri, to Falls Church, Virginia, to be closer to its military customers at The Pentagon. The move started on 20 December 1991, with 110 of the 275 headquarters employees moving to the Washington Beltway location, and 50 remaining in the accounting office in St. Louis, leaving 115 unemployed.

When Anders took over, General Dynamics was in financial trouble. The quarter before he became chairman and CEO was the worst ever in the company&#x27;s history, losing $858 million (equivalent to $ billion in ) between October and December 1990. Anders sold off nearly $3 billion (equivalent to $ billion in ) in assets, including the missile systems and Cessna. On 9 December 1992, he sold the military aircraft division to the Lockheed Corporation for $1.5 billion (equivalent to $ billion in ), which included the F-16 jet fighter. These selloffs reduced the number of employees from 98,600 to around 35,000, and the company&#x27;s debt from $430 million (equivalent to $ million in ) to $183 million (equivalent to $ million in ). Value was returned to the shareholders in the form of $600 million in dividends. Although annual sales dropped from $10 to $3.5 billion, the value of the company&#x27;s share price quadrupled. Anders earned over $40 million. He retired as CEO in 1993, and as chairman on 4 May 1994.
==Retirement and death==
Following retirement, Anders and his wife purchased a house in Anacortes, Washington, overlooking Puget Sound and Burrows Island. After realizing he disliked the winters in northwest Washington, he purchased a second home in Point Loma, California.

Anders later established the William A. Anders Foundation, a philanthropic organization for the benefit of educational and environmental issues. He also founded the Heritage Flight Museum in 1996 in Bellingham, Washington, which moved to Skagit Regional Airport in Burlington, Washington, in 2014. This is run by his family, with Anders as president until 2008, his wife Valerie as secretary, son Greg as vice president, executive director and webmaster, and son Alan as vice president and director of maintenance.

Anders died on 7 June 2024, at the age of 90, while flying the vintage T-34 registered to him. The aircraft crashed into the waters of north Puget Sound between Jones Island and Orcas Island and was seen by witnesses as going down into a small channel between the two islands, then sinking after catching fire. After witnesses reported seeing the plane take a nosedive and crash in the water, a search was launched by the U.S. Coast Guard and the San Juan County Sheriff&#x27;s Department. Later that day, Anders&#x27; son, Greg, confirmed the death of his father and that his body had been recovered. Beginning with his Air Force career, Anders had logged over 8,000 flight hours.

== In popular culture ==

Robert John Burke played Anders in the 1998 HBO miniseries &quot;From the Earth to the Moon&quot;. Anders appeared as himself in the 2005 documentary &quot;Race to the Moon&quot;, which was shown as part of the PBS &quot;American Experience&quot; television series (season 18, episode 2). The film, renamed &quot;Earthrise: The First Lunar Voyage&quot; in 2013, was about the events that led up to the Apollo 8 mission. He was interviewed in a chapter of the 2015 book &quot;No More Worlds to Conquer&quot; by Chris Wright. The chapter is roughly evenly split between his life in the Apollo program and his later corporate life. The book&#x27;s front cover is the &quot;Earthrise&quot; image. He appeared with fellow astronauts Frank Borman and Jim Lovell on the C-SPAN channel book review, &quot;Rocket Men&quot;. He confirmed the story that he had fallen asleep while awaiting the Apollo 8 launch.

<text>A floor is the bottom surface of a room or vehicle. Floors vary from in a cave to many layered surfaces made with modern technology. Floors may be stone, wood, bamboo, metal or any other material that can support the expected load.

The levels of a building are often referred to as floors, although sometimes referred to as storeys.

Floors typically consist of a subfloor for support and a floor covering used to give a good walking surface. In modern buildings the subfloor often has electrical wiring, plumbing, and other services built in. As floors must meet many needs, some essential to safety, floors are built to strict building codes in some regions.

== Special floor structures ==
Where a special floor structure like a floating floor is laid upon another floor, both may be called subfloors.

Special floor structures are used for a number of purposes:

* Balcony, a platform projecting from a wall
* Floating floor, normally for noise or vibration reduction
* Glass floor, as in glass bottomed elevators
* Nightingale floor makes a noise when an intruder walks on it
* Raised floor, utilities underneath can be accessed easily
* Sprung floor, improves the performance and safety of athletes and dancers
* Raked floor, improves the view of performers on a stage for an audience

== Floor covering ==
Floor covering is a term to generically describe any material applied over a floor structure to provide a walking surface. Flooring is the general term for a permanent or temporary covering of a floor, or for the work of installing such a floor covering. Both terms are used interchangeably but floor covering refers more to loose-laid materials.

Materials almost always classified as floor covering include carpet, area rugs, and resilient flooring such as linoleum or vinyl flooring. Materials commonly called flooring include wood flooring, laminated wood, ceramic tile, stone, terrazzo, and various seamless chemical floor coatings.

The choice of material for floor covering is affected by factors such as cost, endurance, noise insulation, comfort and cleaning effort, and sometimes concern about allergens. Some types of flooring must not be installed below grade (lower than ground level), and laminate or hardwood should be avoided where there may be moisture or condensation.

The subfloor may be finished in a way that makes it usable without any extra work. See: 
* Earthen floor adobe or clay floors
* Solid ground floor cement screed or granolithic

A number of special features may be used to ornament a floor or perform a useful service. Examples include floor medallions, which provide a decorative centerpiece of a floor design, or gratings used to drain water or to rub dirt off shoes.

Floors may be built on beams or joists or use structures like prefabricated hollow core slabs. The subfloor builds on those and attaches by various means particular to the support structure, but the support and subfloor together always provides the strength of a floor one can sense underfoot. Nowadays, subfloors are generally made from at least two layers of moisture-resistant (&quot;AC&quot; grade, one side finished and sanded flat) plywood or composite sheeting, jointly also termed &quot;Underlayments&quot; on floor joists of 2x8, 2x10, or 2x12&#x27;s (dimensional lumber) spaced generally on centers, in the United States and Canada. Some flooring components used solely on concrete slabs consist of a dimpled rubberized or plastic layer much like bubble wrap that provide little tiny pillars for the sheet material above. These are manufactured in squares and the edges fit together like a mortise and tenon joint. Like a floor on joists not on concrete, a second sheeting underlayment layer is added with staggered joints to disperse forces that would open a joint under the stress of live loads like a person walking.

Three layers are common only in highest-quality construction. The two layers in high-quality construction will both be thick sheets (as will the third when present), but they may have a combined thickness of only half that in cheaper construction panel overlaid by plywood subflooring. At the highest end, or in select rooms of the building there might be three sheeting layers, and such stiff subflooring is necessary to prevent the cracking of large floor tiles of or more on a side. The structure under such a floor will frequently also have extra &quot;bracing&quot; and &quot;blocking&quot; joist-to-joist intended to spread the weight to have as little sagging on any joist as possible when there is a live load on the floor above.

In Europe and North America only a few rare floors have no separate floor covering on top, and those are normally because of a temporary condition pending sales or occupancy; in semi-custom new construction and some rental markets, such floors are provided for the new home buyer or renter to select their preferred floor coverings, usually a wall-to-wall carpet or one-piece vinyl floor covering. Wood clad (hardwood) and tile covered finished floors generally require a stiffer, higher-quality subfloor, especially for the later class. Since the wall base and flooring interact forming a joint, such later added semi-custom floors will generally not be hardwood, for that joint construction would be in the wrong order unless the wall base trim was also delayed pending the choosing.

The subfloor may also provide underfloor heating and if floor radiant heating is not used, will certainly suffer puncture openings to be put through for forced air ducts for both heating and air conditioning, or pipe holes for forced hot water or steam heating transport piping conveying the heat from furnace to the local room&#x27;s heat exchangers (radiators).

Some subfloors are inset below the top surface level of surrounding flooring&#x27;s joists and such subfloors and a normal height joist are joined to make a plywood box both molding and containing at least of concrete (A mud floor&quot; in builders&#x27; parlance). Alternatively, only a slightly inset floor topped by a fibrous mesh and concrete building composite floor cladding is used for smaller high quality tile floors; these &quot;concrete&quot; subfloors have a good thermal match with ceramic tiles and so are popular with builders constructing kitchen, laundry and especially both common and high end bathrooms and any other room where large expanses of well supported ceramic tile will be used as a finished floor. Floors using small ( and smaller) ceramic tiles generally use only an additional layer of plywood (if that) and substitute adhesive and substrate materials making do with both a flexible joints and semi-flexible mounting compounds and so are designed to withstand the greater flexing which large tiles cannot tolerate without breaking.

=== Ground floor construction ===
A ground-level floor can be an earthen floor made of soil, or be solid ground floors made of concrete slab.

Ground level slab floors are uncommon in northern latitudes where freezing provides significant structural problems, except in heated interior spaces such as basements or for outdoor unheated structures such as a gazebo or shed where unitary temperatures are not creating pockets of troublesome meltwaters. Ground-level slab floors are prepared for pouring by grading the site, which usually also involves removing topsoil and other organic materials well away from the slab site. Once the site has reached a suitable firm inorganic base material that is graded further so that it is flat and level, and then topped by spreading a layer-cake of force dispersing sand and gravel. Deeper channels may be dug, especially the slab ends and across the slab width at regular intervals in which a continuous run of rebar is bent and wired to sit at two heights within forming a sub-slab &quot;concrete girder&quot;. Above the targeted bottom height (coplanar with the compacted sand and gravel topping) a separate grid of rebar or welded wire mesh is usually added to reinforce the concrete, and will be tied to the under slab &quot;girder&quot; rebar at intervals. The under slab cast girders are used especially if it the slab be used structurally, i.e., to support part of the building.

=== Upper floor construction ===

Floors in wood-frame homes are usually constructed with joists centered no more than apart, according to most building codes. Heavy floors, such as those made of stone, require more closely spaced joists. If the span between load-bearing walls is too long for joists to safely support, then a heavy crossbeam (thick or laminated wood, or a metal I-beam or H-beam) may be used. A &quot;subfloor&quot; of plywood or waferboard is then laid over the joists.

=== Utilities ===
In modern buildings, there are numerous services provided via ducts or wires underneath the floor or above the ceiling. The floor of one level typically also holds the ceiling of the level below (if any).

Services provided by subfloors include:

* Air conditioning
* Telecommunications
* Electrical wiring
* Fire protection
* Thermal insulation
* Plumbing
* Sewerage
* Soundproofing
* Underfloor heating

In floors supported by joists, utilities are run through the floor by drilling small holes through the joists to serve as conduits. Where the floor is over the basement or crawlspace, utilities may instead be run under the joists, making the installation less expensive. Also, ducts for air conditioning (central heating and cooling) are large and cannot cross through joists or beams; thus, ducts are typically at or near the plenum, or come directly from underneath (or from an attic).

Pipes for plumbing, sewerage, underfloor heating, and other utilities may be laid directly in slab floors, typically via cellular floor raceways. However, later maintenance of these systems can be expensive, requiring the opening of concrete or other fixed structures. Electrically heated floors are available, and both kinds of systems can also be used in wood floors as well.
== Problems with floors ==
Wood floors, particularly older ones, will tend to &#x27;squeak&#x27; in certain places. This is caused by the wood rubbing against other wood, usually at a joint of the subfloor. Firmly securing the pieces to each other with screws or nails may reduce this problem.

Floor vibration is a problem with floors. Wood floors tend to pass sound, particularly heavy footsteps and low bass frequencies. Floating floors can reduce this problem. Concrete floors are usually so massive they do not have this problem, but they are also much more expensive to construct and must meet more stringent building requirements due to their weight.

Floors with a chemical sealer, like stained concrete or epoxy finishes, usually have a slick finish presenting a potential slip and fall hazard, however there are anti skid additives and coatings which can help mitigate this and provide increased traction. Reliable, science-backed floor slip resistance testing can help floor owners and designers determine if their floor is too slippery, or allow them to choose an appropriate flooring for the intended purpose before installation.

The flooring may need protection sometimes. A gym floor cover can be used to reduce the need to satisfy incompatible requirements.

== Floor cleaning ==
Floor cleaning is a major occupation throughout the world and has been since ancient times. Cleaning is essential for hygiene, to prevent injuries due to slips, and to remove dirt. Floors are also treated to protect or beautify the surface. The correct method to clean one type of floor can often damage another, so it is important to use the correct treatment.

<text>Floating point operations per second (FLOPS, flops or flop/s) is a measure of computer performance in computing, useful in fields of scientific computations that require floating-point calculations. 

For such cases, it is a more accurate measure than measuring instructions per second.

==Floating-point arithmetic==

Floating-point arithmetic is needed for very large or very small real numbers, or computations that require a large dynamic range. Floating-point representation is similar to scientific notation, except computers use base two (with rare exceptions), rather than base ten. The encoding scheme stores the sign, the exponent (in base two for Cray and VAX, base two or ten for IEEE floating point formats, and base 16 for IBM Floating Point Architecture) and the significand (number after the radix point). While several similar formats are in use, the most common is ANSI/IEEE Std. 754-1985. This standard defines the format for 32-bit numbers called &quot;single precision&quot;, as well as 64-bit numbers called &quot;double precision&quot; and longer numbers called &quot;extended precision&quot; (used for intermediate results). Floating-point representations can support a much wider range of values than fixed-point, with the ability to represent very small numbers and very large numbers.

===Dynamic range and precision===
The exponentiation inherent in floating-point computation assures a much larger dynamic range – the largest and smallest numbers that can be represented – which is especially important when processing data sets where some of the data may have extremely large range of numerical values or where the range may be unpredictable. As such, floating-point processors are ideally suited for computationally intensive applications.

===Computational performance===
FLOPS and MIPS are units of measure for the numerical computing performance of a computer. Floating-point operations are typically used in fields such as scientific computational research, as well as in machine learning. However, before the late 1980s floating-point hardware (it&#x27;s possible to implement FP arithmetic in software over any integer hardware) was typically an optional feature, and computers that had it were said to be &quot;scientific computers&quot;, or to have &quot;scientific computation&quot; capability. Thus the unit MIPS was useful to measure integer performance of any computer, including those without such a capability, and to account for architecture differences, similar MOPS (million operations per second) was used as early as 1970 as well. Note that besides integer (or fixed-point) arithmetics, examples of integer operation include data movement (A to B) or value testing (If A = B, then C). That&#x27;s why MIPS as a performance benchmark is adequate when a computer is used in database queries, word processing, spreadsheets, or to run multiple virtual operating systems. In 1974 David Kuck coined the terms flops and megaflops for the description of supercomputer performance of the day by the number of floating-point calculations they performed per second. This was much better than using the prevalent MIPS to compare computers as this statistic usually had little bearing on the arithmetic capability of the machine on scientific tasks.
FLOPS on an HPC-system can be calculated using this equation:

: formula_1

This can be simplified to the most common case: a computer that has exactly 1 CPU:

: formula_2

FLOPS can be recorded in different measures of precision, for example, the TOP500 supercomputer list ranks computers by 64 bit (double-precision floating-point format) operations per second, abbreviated to &quot;FP64&quot;. Similar measures are available for 32-bit (&quot;FP32&quot;) and 16-bit (&quot;FP16&quot;) operations.

==Performance records==
===Single computer records===
In June 1997, Intel&#x27;s ASCI Red was the world&#x27;s first computer to achieve one teraFLOPS and beyond. Sandia director Bill Camp said that ASCI Red had the best reliability of any supercomputer ever built, and &quot;was supercomputing&#x27;s high-water mark in longevity, price, and performance&quot;.

NEC&#x27;s SX-9 supercomputer was the world&#x27;s first vector processor to exceed 100 gigaFLOPS per single core.

In June 2006, a new computer was announced by Japanese research institute RIKEN, the MDGRAPE-3. The computer&#x27;s performance tops out at one petaFLOPS, almost two times faster than the Blue Gene/L, but MDGRAPE-3 is not a general purpose computer, which is why it does not appear in the Top500.org list. It has special-purpose pipelines for simulating molecular dynamics.

By 2007, Intel Corporation unveiled the experimental multi-core POLARIS chip, which achieves 1 teraFLOPS at 3.13 GHz. The 80-core chip can raise this result to 2 teraFLOPS at 6.26 GHz, although the thermal dissipation at this frequency exceeds 190 watts.

In June 2007, Top500.org reported the fastest computer in the world to be the IBM Blue Gene/L supercomputer, measuring a peak of 596 teraFLOPS. The Cray XT4 hit second place with 101.7 teraFLOPS.

On June 26, 2007, IBM announced the second generation of its top supercomputer, dubbed Blue Gene/P and designed to continuously operate at speeds exceeding one petaFLOPS, faster than the Blue Gene/L. When configured to do so, it can reach speeds in excess of three petaFLOPS.

On October 25, 2007, NEC Corporation of Japan issued a press release announcing its SX series model SX-9, claiming it to be the world&#x27;s fastest vector supercomputer. The SX-9 features the first CPU capable of a peak vector performance of 102.4 gigaFLOPS per single core.

On February 4, 2008, the NSF and the University of Texas at Austin opened full scale research runs on an AMD, Sun supercomputer named Ranger,
the most powerful supercomputing system in the world for open science research, which operates at sustained speed of 0.5 petaFLOPS.

On May 25, 2008, an American supercomputer built by IBM, named &#x27;Roadrunner&#x27;, reached the computing milestone of one petaFLOPS. It headed the June 2008 and November 2008 TOP500 list of the most powerful supercomputers (excluding grid computers). The computer is located at Los Alamos National Laboratory in New Mexico. The computer&#x27;s name refers to the New Mexico state bird, the greater roadrunner (&quot;Geococcyx californianus&quot;).

In June 2008, AMD released ATI Radeon HD 4800 series, which are reported to be the first GPUs to achieve one teraFLOPS. On August 12, 2008, AMD released the ATI Radeon HD 4870X2 graphics card with two Radeon R770 GPUs totaling 2.4 teraFLOPS.

In November 2008, an upgrade to the Cray Jaguar supercomputer at the Department of Energy&#x27;s (DOE&#x27;s) Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) raised the system&#x27;s computing power to a peak 1.64 petaFLOPS, making Jaguar the world&#x27;s first petaFLOPS system dedicated to open research. In early 2009 the supercomputer was named after a mythical creature, Kraken. Kraken was declared the world&#x27;s fastest university-managed supercomputer and sixth fastest overall in the 2009 TOP500 list. In 2010 Kraken was upgraded and can operate faster and is more powerful.

In 2009, the Cray Jaguar performed at 1.75 petaFLOPS, beating the IBM Roadrunner for the number one spot on the TOP500 list.

In October 2010, China unveiled the Tianhe-1, a supercomputer that operates at a peak computing rate of 2.5 petaFLOPS.

 the fastest PC processor reached 109 gigaFLOPS (Intel Core i7 980 XE) in double precision calculations. GPUs are considerably more powerful. For example, Nvidia Tesla C2050 GPU computing processors perform around 515 gigaFLOPS in double precision calculations, and the AMD FireStream 9270 peaks at 240 gigaFLOPS.

In November 2011, it was announced that Japan had achieved 10.51 petaFLOPS with its K computer. It has 88,128 SPARC64 VIIIfx processors in 864 racks, with theoretical performance of 11.28 petaFLOPS. It is named after the Japanese word &quot;&quot;, which stands for 10 quadrillion, corresponding to the target speed of 10 petaFLOPS.

On November 15, 2011, Intel demonstrated a single x86-based processor, code-named &quot;Knights Corner&quot;, sustaining more than a teraFLOPS on a wide range of DGEMM operations. Intel emphasized during the demonstration that this was a sustained teraFLOPS (not &quot;raw teraFLOPS&quot; used by others to get higher but less meaningful numbers), and that it was the first general purpose processor to ever cross a teraFLOPS.

On June 18, 2012, IBM&#x27;s Sequoia supercomputer system, based at the U.S. Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL), reached 16 petaFLOPS, setting the world record and claiming first place in the latest TOP500 list.

On November 12, 2012, the TOP500 list certified Titan as the world&#x27;s fastest supercomputer per the LINPACK benchmark, at 17.59 petaFLOPS. It was developed by Cray Inc. at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory and combines AMD Opteron processors with &quot;Kepler&quot; NVIDIA Tesla graphics processing unit (GPU) technologies.

On June 10, 2013, China&#x27;s Tianhe-2 was ranked the world&#x27;s fastest with 33.86 petaFLOPS.

On June 20, 2016, China&#x27;s Sunway TaihuLight was ranked the world&#x27;s fastest with 93 petaFLOPS on the LINPACK benchmark (out of 125 peak petaFLOPS). The system was installed at the National Supercomputing Center in Wuxi, and represented more performance than the next five most powerful systems on the TOP500 list did at the time combined.

In June 2019, Summit, an IBM-built supercomputer now running at the Department of Energy&#x27;s (DOE) Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL), captured the number one spot with a performance of 148.6 petaFLOPS on High Performance Linpack (HPL), the benchmark used to rank the TOP500 list. Summit has 4,356 nodes, each one equipped with two 22-core Power9 CPUs, and six NVIDIA Tesla V100 GPUs.

In June 2022, the United States&#x27; Frontier was the most powerful supercomputer on TOP500, reaching 1102 petaFlops (1.102 exaFlops) on the LINPACK benchmarks.
In November 2024, the United States’ El Capitan exascale supercomputer, hosted at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in Livermore, displaced Frontier as the world&#x27;s fastest supercomputer in the 64th edition of the Top500 (Nov 2024).

===Distributed computing records===
Distributed computing uses the Internet to link personal computers to achieve more FLOPS:

* , the Folding@home network has over 2.3 exaFLOPS of total computing power. It is the most powerful distributed computer network, being the first ever to break 1 exaFLOPS of total computing power. This level of performance is primarily enabled by the cumulative effort of a vast array of powerful GPU and CPU units.

* , the entire BOINC network averages about 31 petaFLOPS.
* , SETI@home, employing the BOINC software platform, averages 896 teraFLOPS.
* , Einstein@Home, a project using the BOINC network, is crunching at 3 petaFLOPS.
* , MilkyWay@home, using the BOINC infrastructure, computes at 847 teraFLOPS.
* , GIMPS, searching for Mersenne primes, is sustaining 1,354 teraFLOPS.

<doc id="82933" wikidata="Q172275" url="?curid=82933" title="Chloroform">
<text>Chloroform, or trichloromethane (often abbreviated as TCM), is an organochloride with the formula and a common solvent. It is a volatile, colorless, sweet-smelling, dense liquid produced on a large scale as a precursor to refrigerants and PTFE. Chloroform was once used as an inhalational anesthetic between the 19th century and the first half of the 20th century. It is miscible with many solvents but it is only very slightly soluble in water (only 8 g/L at 20°C).

==Structure and name==
The molecule adopts a tetrahedral molecular geometry with C3v symmetry. The chloroform molecule can be viewed as a methane molecule with three hydrogen atoms replaced with three chlorine atoms, leaving a single hydrogen atom.

The name &quot;chloroform&quot; is a portmanteau of &quot;terchloride&quot; (tertiary chloride, a trichloride) and &quot;formyle&quot;, an obsolete name for the methylylidene radical (CH) derived from formic acid.

==Natural occurrence ==
Many kinds of seaweed produce chloroform, and fungi are believed to produce chloroform in soil. Abiotic processes are also believed to contribute to natural chloroform productions in soils, although the mechanism is still unclear.

Chloroform is a volatile organic compound.

==History==
Chloroform was synthesized independently by several investigators :
*Moldenhawer, a German pharmacist from Frankfurt an der Oder, appears to have produced chloroform in 1830 by mixing chlorinated lime with ethanol; however, he mistook it for &quot;Chloräther&quot; (chloric ether, 1,2-dichloroethane).
*Samuel Guthrie, a U.S. physician from Sackets Harbor, New York, also appears to have produced chloroform in 1831 by reacting chlorinated lime with ethanol, and noted its anaesthetic properties; however, he also believed that he had prepared chloric ether.
*Justus von Liebig carried out the alkaline cleavage of chloral. Liebig incorrectly states that the empirical formula of chloroform was and named it &quot;Chlorkohlenstoff&quot; (&quot;carbon chloride&quot;).
*Eugène Soubeiran obtained the compound by the action of chlorine bleach on both ethanol and acetone.

In 1834, French chemist Jean-Baptiste Dumas determined chloroform&#x27;s empirical formula and named it: &quot;&quot;Es scheint mir also erweisen, dass die von mir analysirte Substanz, … zur Formel hat: C2H2Cl6.&quot; (Thus it seems to me to show that the substance I analyzed … has as [its empirical] formula: C2H2Cl6.). [Note: The coefficients of his empirical formula should be halved.] ... &quot;Diess hat mich veranlasst diese Substanz mit dem Namen &#x27;Chloroform&#x27; zu belegen.&quot;&quot; (This had caused me to impose the name &quot;chloroform&quot; upon this substance [i.e., formyl chloride or chloride of formic acid].)

In 1835, Dumas prepared the substance by alkaline cleavage of trichloroacetic acid. 

In 1842, Robert Mortimer Glover in London discovered the anaesthetic qualities of chloroform on laboratory animals.

In 1847, Scottish obstetrician James Y. Simpson was the first to demonstrate the anaesthetic properties of chloroform, provided by local pharmacist William Flockhart of Duncan, Flockhart and company, in humans, and helped to popularize the drug for use in medicine. 

By the 1850s, chloroform was being produced on a commercial basis. In Britain, about 750,000 doses a week were being produced by 1895, using the Liebig procedure, which retained its importance until the 1960s. Today, chloroform – along with dichloromethane – is prepared exclusively and on a massive scale by the chlorination of methane and chloromethane.

==Production==
Industrially, chloroform is produced by heating a mixture of chlorine and either methyl chloride () or methane (). At 400–500 °C, free radical halogenation occurs, converting these precursors to progressively more chlorinated compounds:
:

Chloroform undergoes further chlorination to yield carbon tetrachloride ():

The output of this process is a mixture of the four chloromethanes: chloromethane, methylene chloride (dichloromethane), trichloromethane (chloroform), and tetrachloromethane (carbon tetrachloride). These can then be separated by distillation.

Chloroform may also be produced on a small scale via the haloform reaction between acetone and sodium hypochlorite:

===Deuterochloroform===

Deuterated chloroform is an isotopologue of chloroform with a single deuterium atom. is a common solvent used in NMR spectroscopy. Deuterochloroform is produced by the reaction of hexachloroacetone with heavy water. The haloform process is now obsolete for production of ordinary chloroform. Deuterochloroform can also be prepared by reacting sodium deuteroxide with chloral hydrate.

===Inadvertent formation of chloroform===
The haloform reaction can also occur inadvertently in domestic settings. Sodium hypochlorite solution (chlorine bleach) mixed with common household liquids such as acetone, methyl ethyl ketone, ethanol, or isopropyl alcohol can produce some chloroform, in addition to other compounds, such as chloroacetone or dichloroacetone.

==Uses==
In terms of scale, the most important reaction of chloroform is with hydrogen fluoride to give monochlorodifluoromethane (HCFC-22), a precursor in the production of polytetrafluoroethylene (Teflon) and other fluoropolymers:
The reaction is conducted in the presence of a catalytic amount of mixed antimony halides. Chlorodifluoromethane is then converted to tetrafluoroethylene, the main precursor of Teflon.

===Solvent===
The hydrogen attached to carbon in chloroform participates in hydrogen bonding, making it a good solvent for many materials. 

Worldwide, chloroform is also used in pesticide formulations, as a solvent for lipids, rubber, alkaloids, waxes, gutta-percha, and resins, as a cleaning agent, as a grain fumigant, in fire extinguishers, and in the rubber industry.  is a common solvent used in NMR spectroscopy.

===Refrigerant===
Chloroform is used as a precursor to make R-22 (chlorodifluoromethane). This is done by reacting it with a solution of hydrofluoric acid (HF) which fluorinates the molecule and releases hydrochloric acid as a byproduct. Before the Montreal Protocol was enforced, most of the chloroform produced in the United States was used in the production of chlorodifluoromethane. However, its production remains high, as it is a key precursor of PTFE. 

Although chloroform has properties such as a low boiling point, and a low global warming potential of only 31 (compared to the 1760 of R-22), which are appealing properties for a refrigerant, there is little information to suggest that it has seen widespread use as a refrigerant in any consumer products.

===Lewis acid===
In solvents such as and alkanes, chloroform hydrogen bonds to a variety of Lewis bases. is classified as a hard acid, and the ECW model lists its acid parameters as EA = 1.56 and CA = 0.44.

===Reagent===
As a reagent, chloroform serves as a source of the dichlorocarbene intermediate . It reacts with aqueous sodium hydroxide, usually in the presence of a phase transfer catalyst, to produce dichlorocarbene, . This reagent effects ortho-formylation of activated aromatic rings, such as phenols, producing aryl aldehydes in a reaction known as the Reimer–Tiemann reaction. Alternatively, the carbene can be trapped by an alkene to form a cyclopropane derivative. In the Kharasch addition, chloroform forms the free radical which adds to alkenes.

===Anaesthetic===

Chloroform is a powerful general anesthetic, euphoriant, anxiolytic, and sedative when inhaled or ingested. The anaesthetic qualities of chloroform were first described in 1842 in a thesis by Robert Mortimer Glover, which won the Gold Medal of the Harveian Society for that year. Glover also undertook practical experiments on dogs to prove his theories, refined his theories, and presented them in his doctoral thesis at the University of Edinburgh in the summer of 1847, identifying anaesthetizing halogenous compounds as a &quot;new order of poisonous substances&quot;. 

The Scottish obstetrician James Young Simpson was one of those examiners required to read the thesis, but later claimed to have never read it and to have come to his own conclusions independently. Perkins-McVey, among others, have raised doubts about the credibility of Simpson&#x27;s claim, noting that Simpson&#x27;s publications on the subject in 1847 explicitly echo Glover&#x27;s and, being one of the thesis examiners, Simpson was likely aware of the content of Glover&#x27;s study, even if he skirted his duties as an examiner. In 1847 and 1848, Glover would pen a series of heated letters accusing Simpson of stealing his discovery, which had already earned Simpson considerable notoriety. Whatever the source of his inspiration, on 4 November 1847, Simpson argued that he had discovered the anaesthetic qualities of chloroform in humans. He and two colleagues entertained themselves by trying the effects of various substances, and thus revealed the potential for chloroform in medical procedures.

A few days later, during the course of a dental procedure in Edinburgh, Francis Brodie Imlach became the first person to use chloroform on a patient in a clinical context.

In May 1848, Robert Halliday Gunning made a presentation to the Medico-Chirurgical Society of Edinburgh following a series of laboratory experiments on rabbits that confirmed Glover&#x27;s findings and also refuted Simpson&#x27;s claims of originality. The laboratory experiments that proved the dangers of chloroform were largely ignored.

The use of chloroform during surgery expanded rapidly in Europe; for instance in the 1850s chloroform was used by the physician John Snow during the births of Queen Victoria&#x27;s last two children Leopold and Beatrice. In the United States, chloroform began to replace ether as an anesthetic at the beginning of the 20th century; it was abandoned in favor of ether on discovery of its toxicity, especially its tendency to cause fatal cardiac arrhythmias analogous to what is now termed &quot;sudden sniffer&#x27;s death&quot;. Some people used chloroform as a recreational drug or to attempt suicide. One possible mechanism of action of chloroform is that it increases the movement of potassium ions through certain types of potassium channels in nerve cells. Chloroform could also be mixed with other anaesthetic agents such as ether to make C.E. mixture, or ether and alcohol to make A.C.E. mixture.

In 1848, Hannah Greener, a 15-year-old girl who was having an infected toenail removed, died after being given the anaesthetic. Her autopsy establishing the cause of death was undertaken by John Fife assisted by Robert Mortimer Glover. A number of physically fit patients died after inhaling it. In 1848, however, John Snow developed an inhaler that regulated the dosage and so successfully reduced the number of deaths.

The opponents and supporters of chloroform disagreed on the question of whether the medical complications were due to respiratory disturbance or whether chloroform had a specific effect on the heart. Between 1864 and 1910, numerous commissions in Britain studied chloroform but failed to come to any clear conclusions. It was only in 1911 that Levy proved in experiments with animals that chloroform can cause ventricular fibrillation. Despite this, between 1865 and 1920, chloroform was used in 80 to 95% of all narcoses performed in the UK and German-speaking countries. In Germany, comprehensive surveys of the fatality rate during anaesthesia were made by Gurlt between 1890 and 1897. At the same time in the UK the medical journal &quot;The Lancet&quot; carried out a questionnaire survey and compiled a report detailing numerous adverse reactions to anesthetics, including chloroform. In 1934, Killian gathered all the statistics compiled until then and found that the chances of suffering fatal complications under ether were between 1:14,000 and 1:28,000, whereas with chloroform the chances were between 1:3,000 and 1:6,000. The rise of gas anaesthesia using nitrous oxide, improved equipment for administering anesthetics, and the discovery of hexobarbital in 1932 led to the gradual decline of chloroform narcosis.

The latest reported anaesthetic use of chloroform in the Western world dates to 1987, when the last doctor who used it retired, about 140 years after its first use.

=== Criminal use ===
Chloroform has been used by criminals to knock out, daze, or murder victims. Joseph Harris was charged in 1894 with using chloroform to rob people. Serial killer H. H. Holmes used chloroform overdoses to kill his female victims. In September 1900, chloroform was implicated in the murder of the U.S. businessman William Marsh Rice. Chloroform was deemed a factor in the alleged murder of a woman in 1991, when she was asphyxiated while asleep. In 2002, 13-year-old Kacie Woody was sedated with chloroform when she was abducted by David Fuller and during the time that he had her, before he shot and killed her. In a 2007 plea bargain, a man confessed to using stun guns and chloroform to sexually assault minors.

The use of chloroform as an incapacitating agent has become widely recognized, bordering on cliché, through the adoption by crime fiction authors of plots involving criminals&#x27; use of chloroform-soaked rags to render victims unconscious. However, it is nearly impossible to incapacitate someone using chloroform in this way. It takes at least five minutes of inhalation of chloroform to render a person unconscious. Most criminal cases involving chloroform involve co-administration of another drug, such as alcohol or diazepam, or the victim being complicit in its administration. After a person has lost consciousness owing to chloroform inhalation, a continuous volume must be administered, and the chin must be supported to keep the tongue from obstructing the airway, a difficult procedure, typically requiring the skills of an anesthesiologist. In 1865, as a direct result of the criminal reputation chloroform had gained, the medical journal &quot;The Lancet&quot; offered a &quot;permanent scientific reputation&quot; to anyone who could demonstrate &quot;instantaneous insensibility&quot;, i.e. loss of consciousness, using chloroform.

==Safety==
===Exposure===
Chloroform is formed as a by-product of water chlorination, along with a range of other disinfection by-products, and it is therefore often present in municipal tap water and swimming pools. Reported ranges vary considerably, but are generally below the current health standard for total trihalomethanes (THMs) of 100 μg/L. However, when considered in combination with other trihalomethanes often present in drinking water, the concentration of THMs often exceeds the recommended limit of exposure.

While few studies have assessed the risks posed by chloroform exposure through drinking water in isolation from other THMs, many studies have shown that exposure to the general category of THMs, including chloroform, is associated with an increased risk of cancer of the bladder or lower GI tract. 

Historically, chloroform exposure may well have been higher, owing to its common use as an anesthetic, as an ingredient in cough syrups, and as a constituent of tobacco smoke, where DDT had previously been used as a fumigant.

===Pharmacology===
Chloroform is well absorbed, metabolized, and eliminated rapidly by mammals after oral, inhalation, or dermal exposure. Accidental splashing into the eyes has caused irritation. Prolonged dermal exposure can result in the development of sores as a result of defatting. Elimination is primarily through the lungs as chloroform and carbon dioxide; less than 1% is excreted in the urine.

Chloroform is metabolized in the liver by the cytochrome P-450 enzymes, by oxidation to trichloromethanol and by reduction to the dichloromethyl free radical. Other metabolites of chloroform include hydrochloric acid and diglutathionyl dithiocarbonate, with carbon dioxide as the predominant end-product of metabolism.

Like most other general anesthetics and sedative-hypnotic drugs, chloroform is a positive allosteric modulator at GABAA receptors. Chloroform causes depression of the central nervous system (CNS), ultimately producing deep coma and respiratory center depression. When ingested, chloroform causes symptoms similar to those seen after inhalation. Serious illness has followed ingestion of . The mean lethal oral dose in an adult is estimated at .

The anesthetic use of chloroform has been discontinued, because it caused deaths from respiratory failure and cardiac arrhythmias. Following chloroform-induced anesthesia, some patients suffered nausea, vomiting, hyperthermia, jaundice, and coma owing to hepatic dysfunction. At autopsy, liver necrosis and degeneration have been observed. The hepatotoxicity and nephrotoxicity of chloroform is thought to be due largely to phosgene, one of its metabolites.

===Conversion to phosgene===
Chloroform converts slowly in the presence of UV light and air to the extremely poisonous gas phosgene (), releasing HCl in the process.

To prevent accidents, commercial chloroform is stabilized with ethanol or amylene, but samples that have been recovered or dried no longer contain any stabilizer. Amylene has been found to be ineffective, and the phosgene can affect analytes in samples, lipids, and nucleic acids dissolved in or extracted with chloroform. When ethanol is used as a stabiliser for chloroform, it reacts with phosgene (which is soluble in chloroform) to form the relatively harmless diethyl carbonate ester:

Phosgene and HCl can be removed from chloroform by washing with saturated aqueous carbonate solutions, such as sodium bicarbonate. This procedure is simple and results in harmless products. Phosgene reacts with water to form carbon dioxide and HCl, and the carbonate salt neutralizes the resulting acid.

Suspected samples can be tested for phosgene using filter paper which when treated with 5% diphenylamine, 5% dimethylaminobenzaldehyde in ethanol, and then dried, turns yellow in the presence of phosgene vapour. There are several colorimetric and fluorometric reagents for phosgene, and it can also be quantified using mass spectrometry.

===Regulation===
Chloroform is suspected of causing cancer (i.e. it is possibly carcinogenic, IARC Group 2B) as per the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) Monographs.

It is classified as an extremely hazardous substance in the United States, as defined in Section 302 of the US Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act (42 U.S.C. 11002), and is subject to strict reporting requirements by facilities that produce, store, or use it in significant quantities.

==Bioremediation of chloroform==
Some anaerobic bacteria use chloroform for respiration, termed organohalide respiration, converting it to dichloromethane.

<text>According to the Hebrew Bible, the tabernacle (), also known as the Tent of the Congregation (, also Tent of Meeting), was the portable earthly dwelling of God used by the Israelites from the Exodus until the conquest of Canaan. Moses was instructed at Mount Sinai to construct and transport the tabernacle with the Israelites on their journey through the wilderness and their subsequent conquest of the Promised Land. After 440 years, Solomon&#x27;s Temple in Jerusalem superseded it as the dwelling-place of God.

The main source describing the tabernacle is the biblical Book of Exodus, specifically Exodus 25–31 and 35–40. Those passages describe an inner sanctuary, the Holy of Holies, created by the veil suspended by four pillars. This sanctuary contained the Ark of the Covenant, with its cherubim-covered mercy seat. An outer sanctuary (the &quot;Holy Place&quot;) contained a gold lamp-stand or candlestick. On the north side stood a table, on which lay the showbread. On the south side was the Menorah, holding seven oil lamps to give light. On the west side, just before the veil, was the golden altar of incense. It was constructed of 4 woven layers of curtains and 48 15-foot tall standing wood boards overlaid in gold and held in place by its bars and silver sockets and was richly furnished with valuable materials taken from Egypt at God&#x27;s command.

==Meaning==
The English word &quot;tabernacle&quot; derives from the Latin &quot;tabernāculum&quot; (meaning &quot;tent&quot; or &quot;hut&quot;), which in ancient Roman religion was a ritual structure. The Hebrew word &quot;mishkan&quot; implies &quot;dwell&quot;, &quot;rest&quot;, or &quot;to live in&quot;. In Greek, including the Septuagint, the Hebrew is translated σκηνή (&quot;skēnē&quot;), itself a Semitic loanword meaning &quot;tent&quot;.

Dr. Hacham Isaac S. D. Sassoon argued that the Priestly source’s focus on the Tabernacle, rather than the Temple, serves as a post-exilic critique of the idea of rebuilding a stationary Temple, presenting the mobile Tabernacle as a divinely-ordained permanent structure for the Israelites.

==Description==

A detailed description of a tabernacle, located in Exodus chapters 25–27 and Exodus chapters 35–40, refers to an inner shrine, the Holy of Holies, housing the ark, and an outer chamber with the six-branch seven-lamp Temple menorah, table for showbread, and an altar of incense. An enclosure containing the sacrificial altar and bronze laver for the priests to wash surrounded these chambers.
Traditional scholars contend that it describes an actual tabernacle used in the time of Moses and thereafter. This view is based on the existence of significant parallels between the biblical Tabernacle and similar structures from ancient Egypt during the Late Bronze Age.

The detailed outlines for the tabernacle and its priests are enumerated in the Book of Exodus:
* : Materials needed: the Ark, the table for 12 showbread, the menorah.
* : The tabernacle, the bars, partitions.
* : The copper altar, the enclosure, oil.
* : Vestments for the priests, &quot;ephod&quot; garment, ring settings, the breastplate, robe, head-plate, tunic, turban, sashes, pants.
* : Consecration of priests and altar.
* : Incense altar, washstand, anointing oil, incense.

Liane Feldman highlights the contrasting descriptions of the Meeting Tent in the Pentateuch, where the Priestly source presents a large, ornate tent at the center of the Israelite community, while a non-priestly strand describes a smaller, simpler tent for Moses, demonstrating the composite nature of the Pentateuch and differing perspectives within it.

Benjamin D. Sommer suggests that while the Holy of Holies in the tabernacle was reserved for God’s presence, the main room featured a metal menorah with six branches on each side, potentially echoing the asherah, a sacred tree or pole linked to the goddess Asherah.

==Tent of the Presence==
Some interpreters assert the Tent of the Presence was a special meeting place outside the camp, unlike the Tabernacle which was placed in the center of the camp. According to Exodus 33:7–11, this tent was for communion with Yahweh, to receive oracles and to understand the divine will. The people&#x27;s elders were the subject of a remarkable prophetic event at the site of this tent in Numbers 11:24–30.

==Builders==

In Exodus 31, the main builder and maker of the priestly vestments is specified as Bezalel, son of Uri son of Hur of the tribe of Judah, who was assisted by Oholiab and a number of skilled artisans.

==Plan==
During the Exodus, the wandering in the desert and the conquest of Canaan, the Tabernacle was in part a portable tent, and in part a wooden enclosure draped with ten curtains, of blue (&quot;tekhelet&quot; תְּכֵלֶת), purple (&quot;’argāmān&quot; אַרְגָּמָן), and scarlet (&quot;šānî&quot; שָׁנִי) fabric. It had a rectangular, perimeter fence of fabric, poles and staked cords. This rectangle was always erected when the Israelite tribes would camp, oriented to the east as the east side had no frames. In the center of this enclosure was a rectangular sanctuary draped with goat-hair curtains, with the roof coverings made from rams&#x27; skins.

===Holy of Holies===
Beyond this curtain was the cube-shaped inner room, the &quot;Kodesh Hakedashim&quot; (Holy of Holies). This area housed the Ark of the Covenant, inside which were the two stone tablets brought down from Mount Sinai by Moses on which were written the Ten Commandments, a golden urn holding the &quot;manna&quot;, and Aaron&#x27;s rod which had budded and borne ripe almonds (, , ; ).

===Tachash===
&quot;Tachash&quot; is referred to fifteen times in the Hebrew Bible; 13 of these refer to the roof coverings.

==Restrictions==

* Wine forbidden to priests in the tabernacle: Leviticus 10:8–15
* Individuals with the Tzaraat skin affliction were not permitted entry to the tabernacle: Leviticus 22:4
* Sacrifice only at the tabernacle: Leviticus 17
* Priests could only enter into the third room of the tent once a year: Leviticus 16

There is a strict set of rules to be followed for transporting the tabernacle laid out in the Hebrew Bible. For example:
==Rituals==

Twice a day, a priest would stand in front of the golden prayer altar and burn fragrant incense. Other procedures were also carried out in the tabernacle:
* The daily meal offering: Leviticus 6:8–30
* Guilt offerings and peace offerings: Leviticus 7
* Ceremony of Ordination: Leviticus 8
* Octave of Ordination: Leviticus 9
* Yom Kippur: Leviticus 16
* Ordeal of the bitter water for suspected adulteresses: Numbers 5:11–29
* Dedication of Nazirites: Numbers 6:1–21
* Preparation of the ashes of a red heifer for the water of purification: Numbers 19

An Israelite healed of &quot;tzaraath&quot; would be presented by the priest who had confirmed his healing &quot;at the door of the tabernacle of meeting&quot;, and a woman healed of prolonged menstruation would present her offering (two turtledoves or two young pigeons) to the priest &quot;at the door of the tabernacle of meeting&quot;.

It was at the door of the tabernacle that the community wept in sorrow when all the chiefs of the people were impaled and the men who had joined in worship to the Baal of Peor were killed on God&#x27;s orders.

==Subsequent history==
During the conquest of Canaan, the main Israelite camp was at Gilgal (; ) and the tabernacle was probably erected within the camp: &quot;…and returned into the camp&quot; (&quot;see&quot; &quot;…they shall camp facing the tent of meeting on every side&quot;).

After the conquest and division of the land among the tribes, the tabernacle was moved to Shiloh in Ephraimite territory (Joshua&#x27;s tribe) to avoid disputes among the other tribes (; ; ; ). It remained there during most of the rule of the Judges. According to a possible translation of , the Ark, and thus the tabernacle, was at Bethel while Phinehas, grandson of Aaron, was alive.

After the Ark of the Covenant was captured by the Philistines, the subsequent history of the tabernacle is separate from that of the Ark, even after the latter was returned. Under King Saul, the tabernacle was eventually moved to Nob, near Saul&#x27;s his home town of Gibeah, but after he massacred the priests there (), it was moved to Gibeon, a hill-shrine (; ; , 13). Just prior to David&#x27;s moving the ark to Jerusalem, the ark was located in Kiriath-Jearim ().

The Ark was eventually brought to Jerusalem, where it was placed &quot;inside the tent David had pitched for it&quot; (; ), not in the tabernacle, which remained at Gibeon. The altar of the tabernacle at Gibeon was used for sacrificial worship (; ; ), until Solomon brought the structure and its furnishings to Jerusalem to furnish and dedicate the Temple ().

There is no mention of the tabernacle in the Tanakh after the destruction of Jerusalem and the Temple by the Babylonians in c. 587 BCE.

==Relationship to the golden calf==
Some rabbis have commented on the proximity of the narrative of the tabernacle with that of the episode known as the sin of the golden calf recounted in . Maimonides asserts that the tabernacle and its accoutrements, such as the golden Ark of the Covenant and the golden Menorah were meant as &quot;alternates&quot; to the human weakness and needs for physical idols as seen in the golden calf episode. Other scholars, such as Nachmanides, disagree and maintain that the tabernacle&#x27;s meaning is not tied in with the golden calf, but instead symbolizes higher mystical lessons that symbolize God&#x27;s constant closeness to the Children of Israel.

==Blueprint for synagogues==

Synagogue construction over the last two thousand years has followed the outlines of the original tabernacle. Every synagogue has at its front an ark, &quot;aron kodesh&quot;, containing the Torah scrolls, comparable to the Ark of the Covenant which contained the tablets with Ten Commandments. This is the holiest spot in a synagogue, equivalent to the Holy of Holies.

There is also usually a constantly lighted lamp, &quot;Ner tamid&quot;, or a candelabrum, lighted during services, near a spot similar to the position of the original Menorah. At the center of the synagogue is a large elevated area, known as the &quot;bimah&quot;, where the Torah is read. This is equivalent to the tabernacle&#x27;s altars upon which incense and animal sacrifices were offered. On the main holidays the priests gather at the front of the synagogue to bless the congregation as did their priestly ancestors in the tabernacle from Aaron onwards ().

==Inspiration for churches==

Some Christian churches are built like a tent, to symbolize the tent of God with men, including St. Matthew Cathedral, São Mateus, Brazil, Zu den heiligen Engeln (To the Holy Angels), Hanover, Germany and the Cardboard Cathedral, Christchurch, New Zealand.

==Mandaeism==
A &quot;mashkhanna&quot; (Hebrew cognate ), &quot;Beth Manda&quot; , &quot;Beit Manda&quot;, or &quot;Mandi&quot; (&#x27;house of knowledge&#x27;), is a cultic hut and place of worship for followers of Mandaeism. A &quot;Mashkhanna&quot; must be built beside a river in order to perform maṣbuta (baptism) and other ceremonies because Living Water is an essential element in the Mandaean faith.

<text>In some versions of Greek mythology, Ophion (; &quot;serpent&quot;; &quot;gen&quot;.: Ὀφίωνος), also called Ophioneus () ruled the world with Eurynome before the two of them were cast down by Cronus and Rhea.

==Mythology==
Pherecydes of Syros&#x27;s &quot;Heptamychia&quot; is the first attested mention of Ophion.

The story was apparently popular in Orphic poetry, of which only fragments survive.

Apollonius of Rhodes in his &quot;Argonautica&quot; (1.495f) summarizes a song of Orpheus:

:He sang how the earth, the heaven and the sea, once mingled together in one form, after deadly strife were separated each from the other; and how the stars and the moon and the paths of the sun ever keep their fixed place in the sky; and how the mountains rose, and how the resounding rivers with their nymphs came into being and all creeping things. And he sang how first of all Ophion and Eurynome, daughter of Oceanus, held the sway of snowy Olympus, and how through strength of arm one yielded his prerogative to Cronos and the other to Rhea, and how they fell into the waves of Oceanus; but the other two meanwhile ruled over the blessed Titan-gods, while Zeus, still a child and with the thoughts of a child, dwelt in the Dictaean cave; and the earthborn Cyclopes had not yet armed him with the bolt, with thunder and lightning; for these things give renown to Zeus.

Lycophron (1191) relates that Zeus&#x27; mother, Rhea, is skilled in wrestling, having cast the former queen Eurynome into Tartarus.

Nonnus in his &quot;Dionysiaca&quot; has Hera say (8.158f):

:I will go to the uttermost bounds of Oceanus and share the hearth of primeval Tethys; thence I will pass to the house of Harmonia and abide with Ophion.

&quot;Harmonia&quot; here is probably an error in the text for &quot;Eurynome&quot;. Ophion is mentioned again by Nonnus (12.43):

:Beside the oracular wall she saw the first tablet, old as the infinite past, containing all the things in one: upon it was all that Ophion lord paramount had done, all that ancient Cronus accomplished.

We also have fragments of the writings of the early philosopher Pherecydes of Syros (6th century ), who devised a myth or legend in which powers known as Zas and Chronos (&quot;Time&quot;) and Chthonie (&quot;Of the Earth&quot;) existed from the beginning and in which Chronos creates the universe. Some fragments of this work mention a birth of Ophioneus and a battle of the gods between Cronus (not Chronos) on one side and Ophioneus and his children on the other in which an agreement is made that whoever pushes the other side into &quot;Ogenos&quot; will lose, and the winner will hold heaven.

Eusebius of Caesarea in his &quot;Praeparatio Evangelica&quot; (1.10) cites Philo of Byblos as declaring that Pherecydes took Ophion and the Ophionidae from the Phoenicians.

<text>The ossicles (also called auditory ossicles) are three irregular bones in the middle ear of humans and other mammals, and are among the smallest bones in the human body. Although the term &quot;ossicle&quot; literally means &quot;tiny bone&quot; (from Latin &quot;ossiculum&quot;) and may refer to any small bone throughout the body, it typically refers specifically to the malleus, incus and stapes (&quot;hammer, anvil, and stirrup&quot;) of the middle ear.

The auditory ossicles serve as a kinematic chain to transmit and amplify (intensify) sound vibrations collected from the air by the ear drum to the fluid-filled labyrinth (cochlea). The absence or pathology of the auditory ossicles would constitute a moderate-to-severe conductive hearing loss.

== Structure ==
The ossicles are, in order from the eardrum to the inner ear (from superficial to deep): the malleus, incus, and stapes, terms that in Latin are translated as &quot;the hammer, anvil, and stirrup&quot;.
* The malleus () articulates with the incus through the incudomalleolar joint and is attached to the tympanic membrane (eardrum), from which vibrational sound pressure motion is passed.
* The incus () is connected to both the other bones.
* The stapes () articulates with the incus through the incudostapedial joint and is attached to the membrane of the &quot;fenestra ovalis&quot;, the elliptical or oval window or opening between the middle ear and the vestibule of the inner ear. It is the smallest bone in the body.

=== Development ===
Studies have shown that ear bones in mammal embryos are attached to the dentary, which is part of the lower jaw. These are ossified portions of cartilage—called Meckel&#x27;s cartilage—that are attached to the jaw. As the embryo develops, the cartilage hardens to form bone. Later in development, the bone structure breaks loose from the jaw and migrates to the inner ear area. The structure is known as the middle ear, and is made up of the stapes, incus, malleus, and tympanic membrane. These correspond to the columella, quadrate, articular, and angular structures in the amphibian, bird or reptile jaw.

=== Evolution ===
== Function ==

As sound waves vibrate the tympanic membrane (eardrum), it in turn moves the nearest ossicle, the malleus, to which it is attached. The malleus then transmits the vibrations, via the incus, to the stapes, and so ultimately to the membrane of the fenestra ovalis (oval window), the opening to the vestibule of the inner ear.

Sound traveling through the air is mostly reflected when it comes into contact with a liquid medium; only about 1/30 of the sound energy moving through the air would be transferred into the liquid. This is observed from the abrupt cessation of sound that occurs when the head is submerged underwater. This is because the relative incompressibility of a liquid presents resistance to the force of the sound waves traveling through the air. The ossicles give the eardrum a mechanical advantage via lever action and a reduction in the area of force distribution; the resulting vibrations are stronger but don&#x27;t move as far. This allows more efficient coupling than if the sound waves were transmitted directly from the outer ear to the oval window. This reduction in the area of force application allows a large enough increase in pressure to transfer most of the sound energy into the liquid. The increased pressure will compress the fluid found in the cochlea and transmit the stimulus. Thus, the lever action of the ossicles changes the vibrations so as to improve the transfer and reception of sound, and is a form of impedance matching.

However, the extent of the movements of the ossicles is controlled (and constricted) by two muscles attached to them (the &quot;tensor tympani&quot; and the &quot;stapedius&quot;). It is believed that these muscles can contract to dampen the vibration of the ossicles, in order to protect the inner ear from excessively loud noise (theory 1) and that they give better frequency resolution at higher frequencies by reducing the transmission of low frequencies (theory 2) (see acoustic reflex). These muscles are more highly developed in bats and serve to block outgoing cries of the bats during echolocation (SONAR).

== Clinical relevance ==
Occasionally the joints between the ossicles become rigid. One condition, otosclerosis, results in the fusing of the stapes to the oval window. This reduces hearing and may be treated surgically using a passive middle ear implant.

== History ==
There is some doubt as to the discoverers of the auditory ossicles and several anatomists from the early 16th century have the discovery attributed to them with the two earliest being Alessandro Achillini and Jacopo Berengario da Carpi. Several sources, including Eustachi and Casseri, attribute the discovery of the malleus and incus to the anatomist and philosopher Achillini. The first written description of the malleus and incus was by Berengario da Carpi in his &quot;Commentaria super anatomia Mundini&quot; (1521), although he only briefly described two bones and noted their theoretical association with the transmission of sound. Niccolo Massa&#x27;s &quot;Liber introductorius anatomiae&quot; described the same bones in slightly more detail and likened them both to little hammers. A much more detailed description of the first two ossicles followed in Andreas Vesalius&#x27; &quot;De humani corporis fabrica&quot; in which he devoted a chapter to them. Vesalius was the first to compare the second element of the ossicles to an anvil although he offered the molar as an alternative comparison for its shape. The first published description of the stapes came in Pedro Jimeno&#x27;s &quot;Dialogus de re medica&quot; (1549) although it had been previously described in public lectures by Giovanni Filippo Ingrassia at the University of Naples as early as 1546.

The term &quot;ossicle&quot; derives from , a diminutive of &quot;bone&quot; (; genitive ). The malleus gets its name from Latin &quot;malleus&quot;, meaning &quot;hammer&quot;, the incus gets its name from Latin &quot;incus&quot; meaning &quot;anvil&quot; from incudere meaning &quot;to forge with a hammer&quot;, and the stapes gets its name from Modern Latin &quot;stirrup&quot;, probably an alteration of Late Latin &quot;stapia&quot; related to stare &quot;to stand&quot; and pedem, an accusative of pes &quot;foot&quot;, so called because the bone is shaped like a stirrup – this was an invented Modern Latin word for &quot;stirrup&quot;, for which there was no classical Latin word, as the ancients did not use stirrups.

<text>In Greek mythology, Eurybia (; , meaning &quot;wide-force&quot;), described as &quot;[having] a heart of flint within her&quot;, was the daughter of Pontus and Gaia, consort to the Titan Crius, and mother of Astraeus, Perses, and Pallas. An older, relatively minor deity, her role in most mythology is as the ancestor of other gods, and she often plays no role in the mythology.

<text>The incus (: incudes) or anvil in the ear is one of three small bones (ossicles) in the middle ear. The incus receives vibrations from the malleus, to which it is connected laterally, and transmits these to the stapes medially. The incus is named for its resemblance to an anvil ().

==Structure==

The incus is the second of three ossicles, very small bones in the middle ear which act to transmit sound. It is shaped like an anvil, and has a long and short crus extending from the body, which articulates with the malleus. The short crus attaches to the posterior ligament of the incus. The long crus articulates with the stapes at the lenticular process.

The superior ligament of the incus attaches at the body of the incus to the roof of the tympanic cavity.

The incus is homologous to the quadrate bone found in other tetrapods.

==Function==

Vibrations in the middle ear are received via the tympanic membrane. The malleus, resting on the membrane, conveys vibrations to the incus. This in turn conveys vibrations to the stapes.

==History==
&quot;Incus&quot; means &quot;anvil&quot; in Latin. Several sources attribute the discovery of the incus to the anatomist and philosopher Alessandro Achillini. The first brief written description of the &quot;incus&quot; was by Berengario da Carpi in his &quot;Commentaria super anatomia Mundini&quot; (1521). Andreas Vesalius, in his &quot;De humani corporis fabrica&quot;, was the first to compare the second element of the ossicles to an anvil, thereby giving it the name &quot;incus&quot;. The final part of the long limb was once described as a &quot;fourth ossicle&quot; by Pieter Paaw in 1615.

<doc id="82951" wikidata="Q7293871" url="?curid=82951" title="Rape, Abuse &amp; Incest National Network">
<text>The Rape, Abuse &amp; Incest National Network (RAINN) is an American nonprofit anti-sexual assault organization, the largest in the United States. RAINN operates the National Sexual Assault Hotline, as well as the Department of Defense Safe Helpline, and carries out programs to prevent sexual assault, help survivors, and ensure that perpetrators are brought to justice through victim services, public education, public policy, and consulting services.

RAINN was founded in 1994 by Scott Berkowitz, with initial funding from The Atlantic Group and Warner Music Group. Tori Amos was the organization&#x27;s first spokesperson. Christina Ricci has been the national spokesperson since April 25, 2007, and she is a member of its National Leadership Council.

==History==
RAINN was founded in 1994 by Scott Berkowitz. In 2006, its National Sexual Assault Hotline received its one-millionth caller.

After Senate unanimously reauthorized the Debbie Smith Act in May 2019, RAINN gathered 32,000 signatures from online petitions in hopes to push Senate Bill 820 toward House passage. The Debbie Smith Act, which aims to eliminate the backlog of untested DNA and rape kit evidence by allocating $151 million annually to state and local labs, was passed by the House in December 2019.

In February 2022, RAINN supported the EARN IT Act, which removes blanket immunity for violations of laws related to online child sexual abuse material (CSAM). U.S. Senators Richard Blumenthal and Lindsey Graham introduced bipartisan legislation to incentivize tech companies to remove child sexual abuse imagery on their platforms. Also in February, RAINN partnered with Congresswoman Deborah Ross and Congressman Dave Joyce on the Sexual Assault Nurse Examiners (SANEs) Act, which is designed to address the nation-wide shortage of Sexual Assault Nurse Examiners (SANEs) and improve care for survivors of sexual violence. It bill was also endorsed by the American Nurses Association and the National Network to End Domestic Violence. 

In April 2022, &quot;Insider&quot; published an article about RAINN&#x27;s workplace culture in which 22 current and former staff members alleged racism and sexism. A rape survivor story by a higher-ranked Navy physician was chosen to be published on RAINN&#x27;s web site, but later was not published due to Berkowitz not wanting to jeopardize RAINN&#x27;s $2million contract with the United States Department of Defense. When &quot;The Lily&quot; interviewed a woman for International Women&#x27;s Day, she said she was tired of the homophobic lies about the LGBTQ community, which risk the murder of black trans women. The interview noted the woman was employed at RAINN. RAINN&#x27;s vice president of communications said the interview was &quot;too controversial&quot; and might jeopardize RAINN&#x27;s contract with the Department of Defense, and the employee was fired later that day. Six of RAINN&#x27;s executives resigned soon after &quot;Insider&quot; published its investigation.

RAINN supported the &quot; PROTECT Our Children Act of 2022&quot;, which passed the United States Senate on November 15, 2022, as well as Congress on December 6, 2022. The act reauthorizes funding for the Internet Crimes Against Children Task Force (ICAC) and provides support to investigate and arrest perpetrators of sex offenses against children.

In December 2022, RAINN collaborated with HBO on an original documentary series titled &quot;Unveiled: Surviving La Luz Del Mundo&quot;, which tells the story of child sexual abuse within the La Luz del Mundo church. 

===National Sexual Assault Hotline===
The National Sexual Assault Hotline is a 24-hour, toll-free phone service that routes callers to the nearest local sexual assault service provider. More than 1,000 local partnerships are associated with RAINN to provide sexual assault victims with free, confidential services. Since 2008, RAINN has provided anonymous, on-line crisis support through its National Sexual Assault Online Hotline via instant messaging.

Professional wrestler and writer Mick Foley is a member of RAINN&#x27;s national leadership council and has worked as a volunteer on its online hotline. He became involved with the charity through his friendship with Tori Amos, his favorite musician. During a 15-month period ending in April 2011, Foley logged more than 550 hours talking to victims online. The same month, he offered to mow anyone&#x27;s lawn who donated up to a certain amount to the organization, saying, &quot;If you want to help survivors of sexual assault, or just want to see a big guy with long hair mowing your lawn in front of your friends, please take part...&quot;

During the &quot; Depp v. Heard&quot; trial, RAINN noted an increase in hotline calls. RAINN says it provided help to 28% more people in May 2022 than in May 2021, and, on verdict day, it served 35% more people than on average. Following the premiere of &quot;Surviving R. Kelly III: The Final Chapter&quot;, calls to RAINN&#x27;s National Sexual Assault Hotline increased by 46%.

===RAINN Day===
RAINN sponsors an annual campaign geared toward raising awareness and educating students about sexual violence, bystander intervention, and recovery resources on college campuses. Since 2018, RAINN Day is held every April to coincide with Sexual Assault Awareness and Prevention Month (SAAPM).

==Public positions==
RAINN has published press releases in support of multiple survivors facing media scrutiny, including Christine Blasey Ford.

RAINN&#x27;s president, Scott Berkowitz, has also issued multiple public statements, including his belief that arguing against the Keystone pipeline&#x27;s expansion as a potential conduit of sexual violence is &quot;unusual&quot;:
When a former staff assistant in Joe Biden&#x27;s U.S. Senate office alleged that Biden had sexually assaulted her in 1993, RAINN tweeted, 

== Controversies ==
In 2014, RAINN attracted controversy for its criticism of the concept of rape culture and its promotion of primarily criminal justice system solutions in its recommendations to the White House Task Force to Protect Students from Sexual Assault. In response, Zerlina Maxwell created the hashtag &quot;#RapeCultureIsWhen.&quot; Wagatwe Wanjuki, Amanda Marcotte, Jessica Valenti, and others asserted that rape culture exists and denounced relying on the criminal justice system to prevent sexual violence on college campuses.

In February 2025, journalist Mady Castigan noted that RAINN had recently removed references to trans people and trans survivors of sexual violence from their website as well as their entire &quot;inclusion policy&quot; on which groups they intend to serve. Castigan speculated that the change was related to the second Trump administration&#x27;s restrictions on funding trans-supportive organizations.

<text>In Greek mythology, Epione () is a minor health goddess, the wife of Asclepius, the Greek god of healing and medicine.

== Mythology ==
Her name is derived from the word (, &quot;soothing&quot;). Epione was the personification of the soothing of pain and the care needed for recovery. With Asclepius, she was the mother of the five Asclepiades: Iaso, Panacea, Hygieia, Aceso, and Aegle, as listed in the Suda. She also had two sons, Machaon and Podalirius, who are mentioned in the &quot;Iliad&quot; of Homer as well as Telesphoros.

Epigraphical evidence suggests that Epione was a cultic figure in Athens, Epidauros, Kos, and Pergamon. Asclepius and Epione both had marble statues in Argolis, where Asclepius was widely worshipped.

<text>The stapes or stirrup is a bone in the middle ear of humans and other tetrapods which is involved in the conduction of sound vibrations to the inner ear. This bone is connected to the oval window by its annular ligament, which allows the footplate (or base) to transmit sound energy through the oval window into the inner ear. The &quot;stapes&quot; is the smallest and lightest bone in the human body, and is so-called because of its resemblance to a stirrup ().

==Structure==

The &quot;stapes&quot; is the third bone of the three ossicles in the middle ear and the smallest in the human body. It measures roughly , greater along the head-base span. It rests on the oval window, to which it is connected by an annular ligament and articulates with the &quot;incus&quot;, or anvil through the incudostapedial joint. They are connected by anterior and posterior limbs (). 

===Development===
The &quot;stapes&quot; develops from the second pharyngeal arch during the sixth to eighth week of embryological life. The central cavity of the &quot;stapes&quot;, the &quot;obturator foramen&quot;, is due to the presence embryologically of the stapedial artery, which usually regresses in humans during normal development.

===Animals===

The &quot;stapes&quot; is one of three ossicles in mammals. In non-mammalian tetrapods, the bone homologous to the &quot;stapes&quot; is usually called the columella; however, in reptiles, either term may be used. In fish, the homologous bone is called the hyomandibular, and is part of the gill arch supporting either the spiracle or the jaw, depending on the species. The equivalent term in amphibians is the &quot;&quot;.

===Variation===
The &quot;stapes&quot; appears to be relatively constant in size in different ethnic groups. In 0.01–0.02% of people, the stapedial artery does not regress, and persists in the central foramen. In this case, a pulsatile sound may be heard in the affected ear, or there may be no symptoms at all. Rarely, the &quot;stapes&quot; may be completely absent.

==Function==

Situated between the incus and the inner ear, the &quot;stapes&quot; transmits sound vibrations from the incus to the oval window, a membrane-covered opening to the inner ear. The &quot;stapes&quot; is also stabilized by the stapedius muscle, which is innervated by the facial nerve.

==Clinical relevance==
Otosclerosis is a congenital or spontaneous-onset disease characterized by abnormal bone remodeling in the inner ear. Often this causes the &quot;stapes&quot; to adhere to the oval window, which impedes its ability to conduct sound, and is a cause of conductive hearing loss. Clinical otosclerosis is found in about 1% of people, although it is more common in forms that do not cause noticeable hearing loss. Otosclerosis is more likely in young age groups, and females. Two common treatments are stapedectomy, the surgical removal of the &quot;stapes&quot; and replacement with an artificial prosthesis, and stapedotomy, the creation of a small hole in the base of the &quot;stapes&quot; followed by the insertion of an artificial prosthesis into that hole. Surgery may be complicated by a persistent stapedial artery, fibrosis-related damage to the base of the bone, or obliterative otosclerosis, resulting in obliteration of the base. 

==History==

The &quot;stapes&quot; is commonly described as having been discovered by the professor Giovanni Filippo Ingrassia in 1546 at the University of Naples, although this remains the nature of some controversy, as Ingrassia&#x27;s description was published posthumously in his 1603 anatomical commentary &quot;&quot;. Spanish anatomist Pedro Jimeno is first to have been credited with a published description, in (1549). The bone is so-named because of its resemblance to a stirrup (), an example of a late Latin word, probably created in mediaeval times from &quot;to stand&quot; (), as stirrups did not exist in the early Latin-speaking world.

<text>In Greek mythology, the goddess Pandia or Pandeia (, meaning &quot;all brightness&quot;) was a daughter of Zeus and the goddess Selene, the Greek personification of the moon. From the &quot;Homeric Hymn to Selene&quot;, we have: &quot;Once the Son of Cronos [Zeus] was joined with her [Selene] in love; and she conceived and bare a daughter Pandia, exceeding lovely amongst the deathless gods.&quot; An Athenian tradition perhaps made Pandia the wife of Antiochus, the eponymous hero of Antiochis, one of the ten Athenian tribes (&quot;phylai&quot;).

Originally Pandia may have been an epithet of Selene, but by at least the time of the late &quot;Homeric Hymn&quot;, Pandia had become a daughter of Zeus and Selene. Pandia (or Pandia Selene) may have personified the full moon, and an Athenian festival called the Pandia (probably held for Zeus) was perhaps celebrated on the full-moon and may have been connected to her.

<text>Excellent Women, the second published novel by Barbara Pym, first appeared from Jonathan Cape in 1952. A novel of manners, it is generally acclaimed as her funniest and most successful in that genre.

==Title==
The phrase &quot;excellent women&quot; appears frequently throughout the novel, and is often used by men in reference to the kind of women who perform small but meaningful duties in the service of churches and voluntary organisations and are taken for granted. The phrase first appears in Pym&#x27;s early unpublished novel &quot;Civil to Strangers&quot; and is taken from Jane Austen&#x27;s novel &quot;Sanditon&quot;.

==Plot summary==

The book is a first-person narrative in which Mildred Lathbury records the humdrum details of her everyday life in post-war London near the start of the 1950s. Perpetually self-deprecating, but with the sharpest wit, Mildred is a clergyman&#x27;s daughter who is now just over thirty and lives in &quot;a shabby part…very much the &#x27;wrong&#x27; side of Victoria Station&quot;. She works part-time at the charitable Society for Aged Gentlewomen and otherwise occupies herself by attending and helping at the local church. There she is particularly friendly with its unmarried High church priest Julian Malory and his slightly older sister Winifred, who keeps house for him.

Recently Mildred had shared a flat with her schoolteacher friend Dora Caldicote and at one time had been briefly courted by Dora&#x27;s brother William, with whom she still occasionally keeps in touch. Her rather uneventful life grows more exciting with the arrival of new neighbours in the flat below her, anthropologist Helena Napier and her handsome husband Rocky, to whom Mildred feels herself drawn. However, she is wary of being too taken in by his charm, having learned that while serving in Italy in the Royal Navy, Rocky&#x27;s principal task had been to look after the welfare of the female auxiliaries known as &#x27;Wrens&#x27;.

Helena is not interested in housework and leaves the flat in an untidy state. After his return, Rocky is only a little more house-proud, preferring to go up to Mildred&#x27;s flat and get her to make him tea. Eventually the ill-matched married couple quarrel when Helena leaves a hot saucepan on a polished walnut table; she storms off to live with her mother and he to stay in a country cottage he owns. Mildred is left to negotiate between them who owns what furniture and eventually helps arrange their reconciliation.

A subplot revolves around the activities of Julian Malory, who accepts Allegra Gray, a glamorous clergyman&#x27;s widow, as a tenant for the flat in his vicarage. After Julian eventually becomes engaged to Allegra, she attempts to ease Julian&#x27;s sister out of the house. Winifred then flees weeping to Mildred and asks if she can stay with her. Julian follows her closely, having quarrelled with Allegra over her behaviour. The engagement is broken off and Allegra leaves for the more upmarket area of Kensington. Winifred confesses that she had always hoped that Mildred would marry Julian so that they could all live together, but obviously that has now become impossible.

Throughout these events, Mildred wryly observes the ups and downs of matrimony, offering a ready ear to the participants and wondering whether she would be happy left completely on the shelf. When attending a meeting of Helena Napier&#x27;s &#x27;Learned Society&#x27; (which is never specified), Mildred had met Helena&#x27;s supposed alternative love interest, fellow anthropologist Everard Bone, who is definitely wary of becoming entangled with a married woman and at one point flees to the north to pursue his interest in prehistory. Subsequently he seems more impressed by Mildred than she is by him as he pursues her with phone calls and invitations to dinner. By the end of the novel, however, Mildred reluctantly agrees to play the &#x27;excellent woman&#x27; in Everard’s life, to the extent of proof-reading his learned papers and helping index them.

==Publication history==
Barbara Pym originally outlined the novel in one of her notebooks, where it is headed &quot;A full life&quot;, the phrase on which the book&#x27;s eventual final chapter closes. Another partial draft was begun in February 1949, this time headed &quot;No life of one&#x27;s own&quot;, which relates to Mildred&#x27;s reflections on how others perceive spinsterhood. There is also a note that &quot;the time the novel begins is February 1946&quot;, which explains the emphasis on immediately post-war drabness.

Pym completed the novel in February 1951 and it appeared the following year from Jonathan Cape, which had published her previous &quot;Some Tame Gazelle&quot;, as was noted on its cover. The book was well received, with plaudits which included the &quot;Church Times&quot; comparing her writing to Jane Austen&#x27;s, while John Betjeman, in his review for &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot;, praised its humour. The novel sold 6,577 copies in Great Britain by the end of the 1950s, far outselling her other novels, although by no means a bestseller.

By 1954, Pym wrote that eight American publishers and 10 publishers from Continental Europe had seen the manuscript and declined to publish it. Indeed, &quot;Excellent Women&quot; had to wait until E.P. Dutton published it in the US in 1978. The novelist John Updike, reviewing it then, wrote that:
Translations into European languages began soon after, with the Dutch &quot;Geweldige Vrouwen&quot; in 1980, followed by a Spanish translation in 1985, an Italian in the same year, and a German in 1988. The French translation of 1990 not only changes the title to &quot;Des Femmes Remarquables&quot; but is reported to lack much of the novel&#x27;s wit. &quot;Excellent Women&quot; was later translated into such languages as Russian, Estonian, Icelandic, Turkish and Persian.

==Analysis==
&quot;Excellent Women&quot; has been noted for its accurate analysis of life in post-war England, where rationing and other shortages were still in effect. Pym was drawing on her own life for some elements of the novel. It is the first of many to feature anthropologists and she had worked at the International African Institute in London since 1946, at the period she is describing. Previously she had been an officer in the WRNS in Italy during World War II and no doubt had come across Rocky Napier&#x27;s equivalent then.

The novel&#x27;s humour is achieved through linguistic as well as situational means. Very often the serious is juxtaposed to the bathetic in a style similar to mock-heroic. Thus Mildred reflects, &quot;I know myself to be capable of dealing with most of the stock situations or even the great moments of life – birth, marriage, death, the successful jumble sale, the garden fete spoiled by bad weather&quot;. This mood is prolonged by Mildred&#x27;s absorption in mundane detail, as in her first meeting with Helena by the dustbins in the basement, where they make arrangements for managing the supply of toilet rolls in the shared bathroom, followed by Mildred&#x27;s squeamishness at having such matters discussed where others might hear.

But behind the humour, there is a darker mood, expressed by one critic as &quot;the world of vague longing… described in this novel in a way which not only shows us the poignancy of such hopes, but allows us to smile at them&quot;. Philip Larkin, a long-time admirer of Pym&#x27;s writing, also noted this in a 14 July 1964 letter, having just re-read &quot;Excellent Women&quot; and remarking that the novel was &quot;better than I remembered it, full of a harsh kind of suffering [-] it&#x27;s a study of the pain of being single,- time and again one senses not only that Mildred is suffering but that nobody can see why she shouldn&#x27;t suffer, like a Victorian cabhorse.&quot; Later, in a letter of 1971, he enthused: &quot;what a marvellous set of characters it contains! My only criticism is that Mildred is a tiny bit &quot;too&quot; humble at times, but perhaps she&#x27;s satirising herself. I never see any Rockys, but almost every young academic wife (&#x27;I&#x27;m a shit&#x27;) has something of Helena.&quot;

==Adaptations==
The novel was serialised as a radio play in the 1950s on the BBC &quot;Woman&#x27;s Hour&quot;.

&quot;Excellent Women&quot; was serialised in 10 parts on BBC Radio 4&#x27;s &quot;Books at Bedtime&quot; programme, at the start of 2002.

==Connections to other Pym novels==
Barbara Pym&#x27;s characters often reappear or are referenced in later novels. In &quot;Jane and Prudence&quot; (1953), one of the characters mentions that &quot;nice Miss Lathbury&quot; has married an anthropologist (presumably Everard). In &quot;Less than Angels&quot; (1955), Everard reappears as a character, described as &quot;having married a rather dull woman who was nevertheless a great help to him in his work; as a clergyman&#x27;s daughter she naturally got on very well with the missionaries that they were meeting now that they were in Africa again.&quot; Later Pym writes &quot;Everard&#x27;s wife Mildred would do the typing&quot;. Bone appears finally in &quot;An Unsuitable Attachment&quot; in which he attends a dinner party while his wife, Mildred, is at home sick.

This novel also introduces Everard Bone&#x27;s assistant Esther Clovis, who will feature in the novels &quot;Less Than Angels&quot; and &quot;An Unsuitable Attachment&quot;, and whose funeral service will appear from different perspectives in both &quot;An Academic Question&quot; and &quot;A Few Green Leaves&quot;. The character of Archdeacon Hoccleve in &quot;Excellent Women&quot; had previously played a larger role in Pym&#x27;s first novel, &quot;Some Tame Gazelle&quot;.

<text>Radio astronomy is a subfield of astronomy that studies celestial objects at radio frequencies. The first detection of radio waves from an astronomical object was in 1933, when Karl Jansky at Bell Telephone Laboratories reported radiation coming from the Milky Way. Subsequent observations have identified a number of different sources of radio emission. These include stars and galaxies, as well as entirely new classes of objects, such as radio galaxies, quasars, pulsars, and masers. The discovery of the cosmic microwave background radiation, regarded as evidence for the Big Bang theory, was made through radio astronomy.

Radio astronomy is conducted using large radio antennas referred to as radio telescopes, that are either used singularly, or with multiple linked telescopes utilizing the techniques of radio interferometry and aperture synthesis. The use of interferometry allows radio astronomy to achieve high angular resolution, as the resolving power of an interferometer is set by the distance between its components, rather than the size of its components.

Radio astronomy differs from &quot;radar astronomy&quot; in that the former is a passive observation (i.e., receiving only) and the latter an active one (transmitting and receiving).

== History ==
Before Jansky observed the Milky Way in the 1930s, physicists speculated that radio waves could be observed from astronomical sources. In the 1860s, James Clerk Maxwell&#x27;s equations had shown that electromagnetic radiation is associated with electricity and magnetism, and could exist at any wavelength. Several attempts were made to detect radio emission from the Sun including an experiment by German astrophysicists Johannes Wilsing and Julius Scheiner in 1896 and a centimeter wave radiation apparatus set up by Oliver Lodge between 1897 and 1900. These attempts were unable to detect any emission due to technical limitations of the instruments. The discovery of the radio reflecting ionosphere in 1902, led physicists to conclude that the layer would bounce any astronomical radio transmission back into space, making them undetectable.

Karl Jansky made the discovery of the first astronomical radio source serendipitously in the early 1930s. As a newly hired radio engineer with Bell Telephone Laboratories, he was assigned the task to investigate static that might interfere with short wave transatlantic voice transmissions. Using a large directional antenna, Jansky noticed that his analog pen-and-paper recording system kept recording a persistent repeating signal or &quot;hiss&quot; of unknown origin. Since the signal peaked about every 24 hours, Jansky first suspected the source of the interference was the Sun crossing the view of his directional antenna. Continued analysis, however, showed that the source was not following the 24-hour daily cycle of the Sun exactly, but instead repeating on a cycle of 23 hours and 56 minutes. Jansky discussed the puzzling phenomena with his friend, astrophysicist Albert Melvin Skellett, who pointed out that the observed time between the signal peaks was the exact length of a sidereal day; the time it took for &quot;fixed&quot; astronomical objects, such as a star, to pass in front of the antenna every time the Earth rotated. By comparing his observations with optical astronomical maps, Jansky eventually concluded that the radiation source peaked when his antenna was aimed at the densest part of the Milky Way in the constellation of Sagittarius. 

Jansky announced his discovery at a meeting in Washington, D.C., in April 1933 and the field of radio astronomy was born. In October 1933, his discovery was published in a journal article entitled &quot;Electrical disturbances apparently of extraterrestrial origin&quot; in the &quot;Proceedings of the Institute of Radio Engineers&quot;. Jansky concluded that since the Sun (and therefore other stars) were not large emitters of radio noise, the strange radio interference may be generated by interstellar gas and dust in the galaxy, in particular, by &quot;thermal agitation of charged particles.&quot; (Jansky&#x27;s peak radio source, one of the brightest in the sky, was designated Sagittarius A in the 1950s and was later hypothesized to be emitted by electrons in a strong magnetic field. Current thinking is that these are ions in orbit around a massive black hole at the center of the galaxy at a point now designated as Sagittarius A*. The asterisk indicates that the particles at Sagittarius A are ionized.)

After 1935, Jansky wanted to investigate the radio waves from the Milky Way in further detail, but Bell Labs reassigned him to another project, so he did no further work in the field of astronomy. His pioneering efforts in the field of radio astronomy have been recognized by the naming of the fundamental unit of flux density, the jansky (Jy), after him.
Grote Reber was inspired by Jansky&#x27;s work, and built a parabolic radio telescope 9m in diameter in his backyard in 1937. He began by repeating Jansky&#x27;s observations, and then conducted the first sky survey in the radio frequencies. On February 27, 1942, James Stanley Hey, a British Army research officer, made the first detection of radio waves emitted by the Sun. Later that year George Clark Southworth, at Bell Labs like Jansky, also detected radiowaves from the Sun. Both researchers were bound by wartime security surrounding radar, so Reber, who was not, published his 1944 findings first. Several other people independently discovered solar radio waves, including E. Schott in Denmark and Elizabeth Alexander working on Norfolk Island.
At Cambridge University, where ionospheric research had taken place during World War II, J. A. Ratcliffe along with other members of the Telecommunications Research Establishment that had carried out wartime research into radar, created a radiophysics group at the university where radio wave emissions from the Sun were observed and studied.
This early research soon branched out into the observation of other celestial radio sources and interferometry techniques were pioneered to isolate the angular source of the detected emissions. Martin Ryle and Antony Hewish at the Cavendish Astrophysics Group developed the technique of Earth-rotation aperture synthesis. The radio astronomy group in Cambridge went on to found the Mullard Radio Astronomy Observatory near Cambridge in the 1950s. During the late 1960s and early 1970s, as computers (such as the Titan) became capable of handling the computationally intensive Fourier transform inversions required, they used aperture synthesis to create a &#x27;One-Mile&#x27; and later a &#x27;5 km&#x27; effective aperture using the One-Mile and Ryle telescopes, respectively. They used the Cambridge Interferometer to map the radio sky, producing the Second (2C) and Third (3C) Cambridge Catalogues of Radio Sources.

==Techniques==
Radio astronomers use different techniques to observe objects in the radio spectrum. Instruments may simply be pointed at an energetic radio source to analyze its emission. To &quot;image&quot; a region of the sky in more detail, multiple overlapping scans can be recorded and pieced together in a mosaic image. The type of instrument used depends on the strength of the signal and the amount of detail needed.

Observations from the Earth&#x27;s surface are limited to wavelengths that can pass through the atmosphere. At low frequencies or long wavelengths, transmission is limited by the ionosphere, which reflects waves with frequencies less than its characteristic plasma frequency. Water vapor interferes with radio astronomy at higher frequencies, which has led to building radio observatories that conduct observations at millimeter wavelengths at very high and dry sites, in order to minimize the water vapor content in the line of sight. Finally, transmitting devices on Earth may cause radio-frequency interference. Because of this, many radio observatories are built at remote places.

===Radio telescopes===
Radio telescopes may need to be extremely large in order to receive signals with low signal-to-noise ratio. Also since angular resolution is a function of the diameter of the &quot;objective&quot; in proportion to the wavelength of the electromagnetic radiation being observed, &quot;radio telescopes&quot; have to be much larger in comparison to their optical counterparts. For example, a 1-meter diameter optical telescope is two million times bigger than the wavelength of light observed giving it a resolution of roughly 0.3 arc seconds, whereas a radio telescope &quot;dish&quot; many times that size may, depending on the wavelength observed, only be able to resolve an object the size of the full moon (30 minutes of arc).

===Radio interferometry===


The difficulty in achieving high resolutions with single radio telescopes led to radio interferometry, developed by British radio astronomer Martin Ryle and Australian engineer, radiophysicist, and radio astronomer Joseph Lade Pawsey and Ruby Payne-Scott in 1946. The first use of a radio interferometer for an astronomical observation was carried out by Payne-Scott, Pawsey and Lindsay McCready on 26 January 1946 using a &quot;single&quot; converted radar antenna (broadside array) at 200 MHz near Sydney, Australia. This group used the principle of a sea-cliff interferometer in which the antenna (formerly a World War II radar) observed the Sun at sunrise with interference arising from the direct radiation from the Sun and the reflected radiation from the sea. With this baseline of almost 200 meters, the authors determined that the solar radiation during the burst phase was much smaller than the solar disk and arose from a region associated with a large sunspot group. The Australia group laid out the principles of aperture synthesis in a ground-breaking paper published in 1947. The use of a sea-cliff interferometer had been demonstrated by numerous groups in Australia, Iran and the UK during World War II, who had observed interference fringes (the direct radar return radiation and the reflected signal from the sea) from incoming aircraft.

The Cambridge group of Ryle and Vonberg observed the Sun at 175 MHz for the first time in mid July 1946 with a Michelson interferometer consisting of two radio antennas with spacings of some tens of meters up to 240 meters. They showed that the radio radiation was smaller than 10 arc minutes in size and also detected circular polarization in the Type I bursts. Two other groups had also detected circular polarization at about the same time (David Martyn in Australia and Edward Appleton with James Stanley Hey in the UK).

Modern radio interferometers consist of widely separated radio telescopes observing the same object that are connected together using coaxial cable, waveguide, optical fiber, or other type of transmission line. This not only increases the total signal collected, it can also be used in a process called aperture synthesis to vastly increase resolution. This technique works by superposing (&quot;interfering&quot;) the signal waves from the different telescopes on the principle that waves that coincide with the same phase will add to each other while two waves that have opposite phases will cancel each other out. This creates a combined telescope that is the size of the antennas furthest apart in the array. In order to produce a high quality image, a large number of different separations between different telescopes are required (the projected separation between any two telescopes as seen from the radio source is called a &quot;baseline&quot;) – as many different baselines as possible are required in order to get a good quality image. For example, the Very Large Array has 27 telescopes giving 351 independent baselines at once.

====Very-long-baseline interferometry====
Beginning in the 1970s, improvements in the stability of radio telescope receivers permitted telescopes from all over the world (and even in Earth orbit) to be combined to perform very-long-baseline interferometry. Instead of physically connecting the antennas, data received at each antenna is paired with timing information, usually from a local atomic clock, and then stored for later analysis on magnetic tape or hard disk. At that later time, the data is correlated with data from other antennas similarly recorded, to produce the resulting image. Using this method it is possible to synthesise an antenna that is effectively the size of the Earth. The large distances between the telescopes enable very high angular resolutions to be achieved, much greater in fact than in any other field of astronomy. At the highest frequencies, synthesised beams less than 1 milliarcsecond are possible.

The pre-eminent VLBI arrays operating today are the Very Long Baseline Array (with telescopes located across North America) and the European VLBI Network (telescopes in Europe, China, South Africa and Puerto Rico). Each array usually operates separately, but occasional projects are observed together producing increased sensitivity. This is referred to as Global VLBI. There are also a VLBI networks, operating in Australia and New Zealand called the LBA (Long Baseline Array), and arrays in Japan, China and South Korea which observe together to form the East-Asian VLBI Network (EAVN).

Since its inception, recording data onto hard media was the only way to bring the data recorded at each telescope together for later correlation. However, the availability today of worldwide, high-bandwidth networks makes it possible to do VLBI in real time. This technique (referred to as e-VLBI) was originally pioneered in Japan, and more recently adopted in Australia and in Europe by the EVN (European VLBI Network) who perform an increasing number of scientific e-VLBI projects per year.

==Astronomical sources==

Radio astronomy has led to substantial increases in astronomical knowledge, particularly with the discovery of several classes of new objects, including pulsars, quasars and radio galaxies. This is because radio astronomy allows us to see things that are not detectable in optical astronomy. Such objects represent some of the most extreme and energetic physical processes in the universe.

The cosmic microwave background radiation was also first detected using radio telescopes. However, radio telescopes have also been used to investigate objects much closer to home, including observations of the Sun and solar activity, and radar mapping of the planets.

Other sources include:
* Sun
* Jupiter
* Sagittarius A, the Galactic Center of the Milky Way, with one portion Sagittarius A* thought to be a radio wave emitting supermassive black hole
* Active galactic nuclei and pulsars have jets of charged particles which emit synchrotron radiation
* Merging galaxy clusters often show diffuse radio emission
* Supernova remnants can also show diffuse radio emission; pulsars are a type of supernova remnant that shows highly synchronous emission.
* The cosmic microwave background is blackbody radio/microwave emission

Earth&#x27;s radio signal is mostly natural and stronger than for example Jupiter&#x27;s, but is produced by Earth&#x27;s auroras and bounces at the ionosphere back into space.

==International regulation==


Radio astronomy service (also: &quot;radio astronomy radiocommunication service&quot;) is, according to Article 1.58 of the International Telecommunication Union&#x27;s (ITU) Radio Regulations (RR), defined as &quot;A radiocommunication service involving the use of radio astronomy&quot;. Subject of this radiocommunication service is to receive radio waves transmitted by astronomical or celestial objects.

===Frequency allocation===
The allocation of radio frequencies is provided according to &quot;Article 5&quot; of the ITU Radio Regulations (edition 2012).

In order to improve harmonisation in spectrum utilisation, the majority of service-allocations stipulated in this document were incorporated in national Tables of Frequency Allocations and Utilisations which is with-in the responsibility of the appropriate national administration. The allocation might be primary, secondary, exclusive, and shared.
*primary allocation: is indicated by writing in capital letters (see example below)
*secondary allocation: is indicated by small letters
*exclusive or shared utilization: is within the responsibility of administrations

In line to the appropriate ITU Region the frequency bands are allocated (primary or secondary) to the &quot;radio astronomy service&quot; as follows.

<text>In Greek mythology, Panopea (Ancient Greek: Πανόπεια &quot;Panopeia&quot;) or Panope (Πανόπη) may refer to various characters. The names mean &#x27;panorama&#x27; or means &#x27;of the beautiful husband&#x27;.

* Panope or Poenope, the Nereid of the sea panorama. She was one of the 50 marine-nymph daughters of the &#x27;Old Man of the Sea&#x27; Nereus and the Oceanid Doris. Panope, together with Doto and Galatea, escorted her sister Thetis out of the sea to her wedding with Peleus. Later on, Panope and her other sisters appeared to Thetis when she cries out in sympathy for the grief of Achilles for his slain friend Patroclus.
* Panopea, Panopeia or Panopaea, another &#x27;virgin&#x27; Nereid who together with her sisters, Thetis, Nesaea, Spio, Thalia, Cymodoce and Melite, helped the hero Aeneas and his crew during a storm. She may be the same with her above supposed sister who was doubled by Hyginus in his account.
* Panope, a Thespian princess as one of the 50 daughters of King Thespius and Megamede or by one of his many wives. When Heracles hunted and ultimately slayed the Cithaeronian lion, Panope with her other sisters, except for one, all laid with the hero in a night, a week or for 50 days as what their father strongly desired it to be. Panope bore Heracles a son, Threpsippas.

<text>The name Pelasgians (, &quot;Pelasgós&quot;) was used by Classical Greek writers to refer either to the predecessors of the Greeks, or to all the inhabitants of Greece before the emergence of the Greeks. In general, &quot;Pelasgian&quot; has come to mean more broadly all the indigenous inhabitants of the Aegean Sea region and their cultures, and British historian Peter Green comments on it as &quot;a hold-all term for any ancient, primitive and presumably indigenous people in the Greek world&quot;.

In the Classic period, enclaves under that name survived in several locations of mainland Greece, Crete, and other regions of the Aegean. Populations identified as &quot;Pelasgian&quot; spoke a language or languages that at the time Greeks identified as &quot;barbarian&quot;, though some ancient writers nonetheless described the Pelasgians as Greeks. A tradition also survived that large parts of Greece had once been Pelasgian before being Hellenized. These parts fell largely, though far from exclusively, within the territory which by the 5th century BC was inhabited by those speakers of ancient Greek who were identified as Ionians and Aeolians.

== Etymology ==
Much like all other aspects of the &quot;Pelasgians&quot;, their ethnonym (&quot;Pelasgoi&quot;) is of extremely uncertain provenance and etymology. Michael Sakellariou collects fifteen different etymologies proposed for it by philologists and linguists during the last two hundred years, though he admits that &quot;most [...] are fanciful&quot;.

An ancient etymology based on mere similarity of sounds links &quot;pelasgos&quot; to &quot;pelargos&quot; , postulating that the Pelasgians were migrants like storks, possibly from Arcadia, where they nest. Aristophanes deals effectively with this etymology in his comedy &quot;The Birds&quot;. One of the laws of &quot;the storks&quot; in the satirical Cloud Cuckoo Land (), playing upon the Athenian belief that they were originally Pelasgians, is that grown-up storks must support their parents by migrating elsewhere and conducting warfare.

Gilbert Murray summarized the derivation from &quot;pelas gē&quot; , current at his time: &quot;If Pelasgoi is connected with , &#x27;near&#x27;, the word would mean &#x27;neighbor&#x27; and would denote the nearest strange people to the invading Greeks&quot;.
Julius Pokorny derived Pelasgoi from &quot;*pelag-skoi&quot; ; specifically, &quot;inhabitants of the Thessalian plain&quot;. He details a previous derivation, which appears in English at least as early as William Ewart Gladstone&#x27;s &quot;Studies on Homer and the Homeric Age&quot;; if the Pelasgians were not Indo-Europeans, the name in this derivation must have been assigned by the Hellenes. Ernest Klein argued that the ancient Greek word for , &quot;pelagos&quot;, and the Doric word &quot;plagos&quot; (which is flat), shared the same root, &quot;*plāk-&quot;, and that &quot;*pelag-skoi&quot; therefore meant , where the sea is flat. This could be connected to the maritime marauders referred to as the Sea People in Egyptian records.

==Ancient literary evidence==

Literary analysis has been ongoing since classical Greece, when the writers of those times read previous works on the subject. No definitive answers were ever forthcoming by this method; it rather served to better define the problems. The method perhaps reached a peak in the Victorian era when new methods of systematic comparison began to be applied in philology. Typical of the era is the study by William Ewart Gladstone, who was a trained classicist. Unless further ancient texts come to light, advances on the subject cannot be made. Therefore the most likely source of progress regarding the Pelasgians continues to be archaeology and related sciences.

=== The term &quot;Pelasgians&quot; in ancient sources ===
The definition of the term &quot;Pelasgians&quot; in ancient sources was fluid. The Pelasgians were variously described by ancient authors as Greek, semi-Greek, non-Greek and pre-Greek. There are no &quot;emic&quot; perspectives of Pelasgian identity. According to an analysis by historian Tristn Lambright of Jacksonville State University:
===Poets===
====Homer====
In the &quot;Iliad&quot;, there were Pelasgians on both sides of the Trojan War. In the section known as the &quot;Catalogue of Trojans&quot;, they are mentioned between the Hellespontine cities and the Thracians of Southeastern Europe (i.e., on the Hellespontine border of Thrace). Homer calls their town or district &quot;Larisa&quot; and characterises it as fertile, and its inhabitants as celebrated for their spearsmanship. He records their chiefs as Hippothous and Pylaeus, sons of Lethus, son of Teutamides. The &quot;Iliad&quot; also refers to the camp at Greece, specifically at &quot;Argos Pelasgikon&quot;, which is most likely to be the plain of Thessaly, and to &quot;Pelasgic Zeus&quot;, living in and ruling over Dodona. Additionally, according to the &quot;Iliad&quot;, Pelasgians were camping out on the shore together with the following tribes:

Towards the sea lie the Carians and the Paeonians, with curved bows, and the Leleges and Caucones, and the goodly Pelasgi.

In the &quot;Odyssey&quot;, they appear among the inhabitants of Crete. Odysseus, affecting to be Cretan himself, instances Pelasgians among the tribes in the ninety cities of Crete, &quot;language mixing with language side by side&quot;. Last on his list, Homer distinguishes them from other ethnicities on the island: &quot;Cretans proper&quot;, Achaeans, Cydonians (of the city of Cydonia/modern Chania), Dorians, and &quot;noble Pelasgians&quot;.

====Hesiod====
Hesiod, in a fragment known from Strabo, calls Dodona, identified by reference to &quot;the oak&quot;, the &quot;seat of Pelasgians&quot;, thus explaining why Homer, in referring to Zeus as he ruled over Dodona, did &quot;not&quot; style him &quot;Dodonic&quot; but &quot;Pelasgic&quot; Zeus. He mentions also that Pelasgus (Greek: Πελασγός, the eponymous ancestor of the Pelasgians) was the father of King Lycaon of Arcadia.

====Asius of Samos====
Asius of Samos () describes Pelasgus as the first man, born of the earth. This account features centrally in the construction of an enduring autochthonous Arcadian identity into the Classical period. In a fragment quoted by Pausanias, Asius describes the foundational hero of the Greek ethnic groups as &quot;godlike Pelasgus [whom the] black earth gave up&quot;.

====Aeschylus====
Aeschylus incorporates all the territories that the Archaic tradition identifies as Pelasgian, including Thessaly (the region of Homer&#x27;s Pelasgian Argos), Dodona (the seat of Homer&#x27;s Pelasgian Zeus), and Arcadia (the region ruled by autochthonous Pelasgus&#x27;s son Lycaon) into an Argive-Pelasgian kingdom ruled by Pelasgus. This affirms the ancient Greek origins of the Pelasgians as well as their widespread settlements throughout central Greece and the Peloponnese.

In Aeschylus&#x27;s play, &quot;The Suppliants&quot;, the Danaids fleeing from Egypt seek asylum from King Pelasgus of Argos, which he says is on the Strymon, including Perrhaebia in the north, the Thessalian Dodona and the slopes of the Pindus mountains on the west and the shores of the sea on the east; that is, a territory including but somewhat larger than classical Pelasgiotis. The southern boundary is not mentioned; however, Apis is said to have come to Argos from Naupactus &quot;across&quot; (&quot;peras&quot;), implying that Argos includes all of east Greece from the north of Thessaly to the Peloponnesian Argos, where the Danaids are probably to be conceived as having landed. He claims to rule the Pelasgians and to be the &quot;child of Palaichthon (or &#x27;ancient earth&#x27;) whom the earth brought forth&quot;.

The Danaids call the country the &quot;Apian hills&quot; and claim that it understands the &quot;karbana audan&quot; (accusative case, and in the Dorian dialect), which many translate as &quot;barbarian speech&quot; but Karba (where the &quot;Karbanoi&quot; live) is in fact a non-Greek word. They claim to descend from ancestors in ancient Argos even though they are of a &quot;dark race&quot; (&quot;melanthes ... genos&quot;). Pelasgus admits that the land was once called Apia but compares them to the women of Libya and Egypt and wants to know how they can be from Argos on which they cite descent from Io.

According to Strabo, Aeschylus&#x27;s &quot;Suppliants&quot; defines the original homeland of the Pelasgians as the region around Mycenae.

====Sophocles and Euripides====
Sophocles and Euripides affirm the Greek origins of the Pelasgians while highlighting their relationship to the Danaids, a relationship introduced and explored in depth in Aeschylus&#x27;s &quot;Suppliants&quot;.

Sophocles presents Inachus, in a fragment of a missing play entitled &quot;Inachus&quot;, as the elder in the lands of Argos, the Heran hills and among the Tyrsenoi Pelasgoi, an unusual hyphenated noun construction, &quot;Tyrsenians-Pelasgians&quot;. Interpretation is open, even though translators typically make a decision, but Tyrsenians may well be the ethnonym &quot;Tyrrhenoi&quot;.

Euripides uses the term for the inhabitants of Argos in his &quot;Orestes&quot; and &quot;The Phoenician Women&quot;. In a lost play entitled &quot;Archelaus&quot;, he says that Danaus, on coming to reside in the city of Inachus (Argos), formulated a law whereby the Pelasgians were now to be called Danaans.

====Ovid====
The Roman poet Ovid describes the Greeks of the Trojan War as Pelasgians in his &quot;Metamorphoses&quot;:

===Historians===

====Hecataeus of Miletus====
Hecataeus of Miletus in a fragment from &quot;Genealogiai&quot; states that the &quot;genos&quot; (&quot;clan&quot;) descending from Deucalion ruled Thessaly and that it was called &quot;Pelasgia&quot; from king Pelasgus. A second fragment states that Pelasgus was the son of Zeus and Niobe and that his son Lycaon founded a dynasty of kings of Arcadia.

====Acusilaus====
A fragment from the writings of Acusilaus asserts that the Peloponnesians were called &quot;Pelasgians&quot; after Pelasgus, a son of Zeus and Niobe.

====Hellanicus====
Hellanicus of Lesbos concerns himself with one word in one line of the &quot;Iliad&quot;, &quot;pasture-land of horses&quot;, applied to Argos in the Peloponnesus. According to Hellanicus, from Pelasgus and his wife Menippe came a line of kings: Phrastōr, Amyntōr, Teutamides and Nanas (kings of Pelasgiotis in Thessaly). During Nanas&#x27;s reign, the Pelasgians were driven out by the Greeks and departed for Italy. They landed at the mouth of the Po River, near the Etruscan city of Spina, then took the inland city &quot;Crotona&quot; (&quot;Κρότωνα&quot;), and from there colonized Tyrrhenia. The inference is that Hellanicus believed the Pelasgians of Thessaly (and indirectly of the Peloponnese) to have been the ancestors of the Etruscans.

====Herodotus====
In the &quot;Histories&quot;, the Greek historian Herodotus of Halicarnassus made many references to the Pelasgians. In Book 1, the Pelasgians are mentioned within the context of Croesus seeking to learn who the strongest Greeks were to befriend them. Afterwards, Herodotus ambivalently classified the Pelasgian language as &quot;barbarian&quot; though he thought of the Pelasgians to have been essentially Greek. Herodotus also discussed various areas inhabited (or previously inhabited) by Pelasgians/Pelasgian-speakers along with their different neighbors/co-residents:

I am unable to state with certainty what language the Pelasgians spoke, but we could consider the speech of the Pelasgians who still exist in settlements above Tyrrhenia in the city of Kreston, formerly neighbors to the Dorians who at that time lived in the land now called Thessaliotis; also the Pelasgians who once lived with the Athenians and then settled Plakia and Skylake in the Hellespont; and along with those who lived with all the other communities and were once Pelasgian but changed their names. If one can judge by this evidence, the Pelasgians spoke a barbarian language. And so, if the Pelasgian language was spoken in all these places, the people of Attica being originally Pelasgian, must have learned a new language when they became Hellenes. As a matter of fact, the people of Krestonia and Plakia no longer speak the same language, which shows that they continue to use the dialect they brought with them when they migrated to those lands.

Furthermore, Herodotus discussed the relationship between the Pelasgians and the (other) Greeks, which, according to Pericles Georges, reflected the &quot;rivalry within Greece itself between [...] Dorian Sparta and Ionian Athens.&quot; Specifically, Herodotus stated that the Hellenes separated from the Pelasgians with the former group surpassing the latter group numerically:
As for the Hellenes, it seems obvious to me that ever since they came into existence they have always used the same language. They were weak at first, when they were separated from the Pelasgians, but they grew from a small group into a multitude, especially when many peoples, including other barbarians in great numbers, had joined them. Moreover, I do not think the Pelasgian, who remained barbarians, ever grew appreciably in number or power.

In Book 2, Herodotus alluded to the Pelasgians as inhabitants of Samothrace, an island located just north of Troy, before coming to Attica. Moreover, Herodotus wrote that the Pelasgians simply called their gods &quot;theoi&quot; prior to naming them on the grounds that the gods established all affairs in their order (&quot;thentes&quot;); the author also stated that the gods of the Pelasgians were the Cabeiri. Later, Herodotus stated that the entire territory of Greece (i.e., &quot;Hellas&quot;) was initially called &quot;Pelasgia&quot;.

In Book 5, Herodotus mentioned the Pelasgians as inhabitants of the islands of Lemnos and Imbros.

In Book 6, the Pelasgians of Lemnos were originally Hellespontine Pelasgians who had been living in Athens but whom the Athenians resettled on Lemnos and then found it necessary to reconquer the island. This expulsion of (non-Athenian) Pelasgians from Athens may reflect, according to the historian Robert Buck, &quot;a dim memory of forwarding of refugees, closely akin to the Athenians in speech and custom, to the Ionian colonies&quot;. Also, Herodotus wrote that the Pelasgians on the island of Lemnos opposite Troy once kidnapped the Hellenic women of Athens for wives, but the Athenian wives created a crisis by teaching their children &quot;the language of Attica&quot; instead of the Pelasgian.

In Book 7, Herodotus mentioned &quot;the Pelasgian city of Antandrus&quot; and wrote about the Ionian inhabitants of &quot;the land now called Achaea&quot; (i.e., northwestern Peloponnese) being &quot;called, according to the Greek account, Aegialean Pelasgi, or Pelasgi of the Sea Shore&quot;; afterwards, they were called &quot;Ionians&quot;. Moreover, Herodotus mentioned that the Aegean islanders &quot;were a Pelasgian race, who in later times took the name Ionians&quot; and that the Aeolians, according to the Hellenes, were known anciently as &quot;Pelasgians.&quot;

In Book 8, Herodotus mentioned that the Pelasgians of Athens were previously called &quot;Cranai&quot;.

====Thucydides====
In the &quot;History of the Peloponnesian War&quot;, the Greek historian Thucydides wrote about the Pelasgians stating that:

Before the time of Hellen, son of Deucalion [...] the country went by the names of the different tribes, in particular of the Pelasgian. It was not till Hellen and his sons grew strong in Phthiotis, and were invited as allies into the other cities, that one by one they gradually acquired from the connection the name of Hellenes; though a long time elapsed before that name could fasten itself upon all.

The author regards the Athenians as having lived in scattered independent settlements in Attica; but at some time after Theseus, they changed residence to Athens, which was already populated. A plot of land below the Acropolis was called &quot;Pelasgian&quot; and was regarded as cursed, but the Athenians settled there anyway.

In connection with the campaign against Amphipolis, Thucydides mentions that several settlements on the promontory of Actē were home to:

[...] mixed barbarian races speaking the two languages. There is also a small Chalcidian element; but the greater number are Tyrrheno-Pelasgians once settled in Lemnos and Athens, and Bisaltians, Crestonians and Eonians; the towns all being small ones.

====Ephorus====
The historian Ephorus, building on a fragment from Hesiod that attests to a tradition of an aboriginal Pelasgian people in Arcadia, developed a theory of the Pelasgians as a people living a &quot;military way of life&quot; (&quot;stratiōtikon bion&quot;) &quot;and that, in converting many peoples to the same mode of life, they imparted their name to all&quot;, meaning &quot;all of Hellas&quot;. They colonized Crete and extended their rule over Epirus, Thessaly and by implication over wherever else the ancient authors said they were, beginning with Homer. The Peloponnese was called &quot;Pelasgia&quot;.

====Dionysius of Halicarnassus====
In the &quot;Roman Antiquities&quot;, Dionysius of Halicarnassus in several pages gives a synoptic interpretation of the Pelasgians based on the sources available to him then, concluding that Pelasgians were Greek:

Afterwards some of the Pelasgians who inhabited Thessaly, as it is now called, being obliged to leave their country, settled among the Aborigines and jointly with them made war upon the Sicels. It is possible that the Aborigines received them partly in the hope of gaining their assistance, but I believe it was chiefly on account of their kinship; for the Pelasgians, too, were a Greek nation originally from the Peloponnesus [...]

He goes on to add that the nation wandered a great deal. They were originally natives of &quot;Achaean Argos&quot; descended from Pelasgus, the son of Zeus and Niobe. They migrated from there to Haemonia (later called Thessaly), where they &quot;drove out the barbarian inhabitants&quot; and divided the country into Phthiotis, Achaia, and Pelasgiotis, named after Achaeus, Phthius and Pelasgus, &quot;the sons of Larissa and Poseidon.&quot; Subsequently, &quot;about the sixth generation they were driven out by the Curetes and Leleges, who are now called Aetolians and Locrians&quot;.

From there, the Pelasgians dispersed to Crete, the Cyclades, Histaeotis, Boeotia, Phocis, Euboea, the coast along the Hellespont and the islands, especially Lesbos, which had been colonized by Macar son of Crinacus. Most went to Dodona and eventually being driven from there to Italy (then called Saturnia), they landed at Spina at the mouth of the Po River. Still others crossed the Apennine Mountains to Umbria and being driven from there went to the country of the Aborigines where they consented to a treaty and settled at Velia. They and the Aborigenes took over Umbria but were dispossessed by the Tyrrhenians. The author then continues to detail the tribulations of the Pelasgians and then goes on to the Tyrrhenians, whom he is careful to distinguish from the Pelasgians.

===Geographers===
====Pausanias====
In his &quot;Description of Greece&quot;, Pausanias mentions the Arcadians who state that Pelasgus (along with his followers) was the first inhabitant of their land. Upon becoming king, Pelasgus invented huts, sheep-skin coats, and a diet consisting of acorns while governing the land named after him, &quot;Pelasgia&quot;. When Arcas became king, Pelasgia was renamed &quot;Arcadia&quot; and its inhabitants (the Pelasgians) were renamed &quot;Arcadians&quot;. Pausanias also mentions the Pelasgians as responsible for creating a wooden image of Orpheus in a sanctuary of Demeter at Therae, as well as expelling the Minyans and Lacedaemonians from Lemnos.

====Strabo====
Strabo dedicates a section of his &quot;Geography&quot; to the Pelasgians, relating both his own opinions and those of prior writers. He begins by stating:

Almost every one is agreed that the Pelasgi were an ancient race spread throughout the whole of Greece, but especially in the country of the Æolians near to Thessaly.

He defines Pelasgian Argos as being &quot;between the outlets of the Peneus River and Thermopylae as far as the mountainous country of Pindus&quot; and states that it took its name from Pelasgian rule. He includes also the tribes of Epirus as Pelasgians (based on the opinions of &quot;many&quot;). Lesbos is named Pelasgian. Caere was settled by Pelasgians from Thessaly, who called it by its former name, &quot;Agylla&quot;. Pelasgians also settled around the mouth of the Tiber River in Italy at Pyrgi and a few other settlements under a king, Maleos.

==Language==

In the absence of certain knowledge about the identity (or identities) of the Pelasgians, various theories have been proposed. Some of the more prevalent theories supported by scholarship are presented below. Since Greek is classified as an Indo-European language, the major question of concern is whether Pelasgian was an Indo-European language.

===Reception===
The theory that Pelasgian was an Indo-European language, which &quot;fascinated scholars&quot; and concentrated research during the second part of the 20th century, has since been critiqued; an emerging consensus among modern linguists is that the substrate language spoken in the southern Balkans was non-Indo-European. García-Ramón remarked that &quot;the attempt to determine phonological rules for an Indo-European pre-Greek language (&#x27;Pelasgian&#x27;) [...] is considered a complete failure today&quot;, while Beekes (2018) notes that &quot;one of the demerits of Georgiev&#x27;s Pelasgian theory was that it drew attention away from the Pre-Greek material itself&quot;, concluding that &quot;the search for Pelasgian was an expensive and useless distraction.&quot; However, Biliana Mihaylova finds no contradiction between &quot;the idea of [an] Indo-European Pre-Greek substratum&quot; and &quot;the possibility of the existence of an earlier non-Indo-European layer in Greece&quot; given certain Pre-Greek words possessing Indo-European &quot;pattern[s] of word formation.&quot;

===Pelasgian as Indo-European===
====Greek====
Sir Edward Bulwer-Lytton, an English writer and intellectual, argued that the Pelasgians spoke Greek based on the fact that areas traditionally inhabited by the &quot;Pelasgi&quot; (i.e. Arcadia and Attica) only spoke Greek and the few surviving Pelasgian words and inscriptions (i.e., Lamina Borgiana, Herodotus 2.52.1) betray Greek linguistic features despite the classical identification of Pelasgian as a barbarian language. According to Thomas Harrison of Saint Andrews University, the Greek etymology of Pelasgian terms mentioned in Herodotus such as &quot;θεοί&quot; (derived from &quot;θέντες&quot;) indicates that the &quot;Pelasgians spoke a language at least &#x27;akin to&#x27; Greek&quot;. According to French classical scholar Pierre Henri Larcher, if this linguistic affiliation is true, then it proves that the Pelasgians and the Greeks were the same people.

====Anatolian====
In western Anatolia, many toponyms with a &quot;-ss-&quot; suffix derive from the adjectival suffix also seen in cuneiform Luwian and some Palaic; the classic example is Bronze Age Tarhuntassa (loosely meaning &quot;City of the Storm God Tarhunta&quot;), and later Parnassus possibly related to the Luwian word &quot;parna-&quot; or &quot;house&quot;. These elements have led to a second theory that Pelasgian was to some degree an Anatolian language, or that it had areal influences from Anatolian languages.

====Thracian====
Vladimir I. Georgiev, a Bulgarian linguist, asserted that the Pelasgians spoke an Indo-European language and were, more specifically, related to the Thracians. Georgiev also proposed, relying on a sound-shift model, that &quot;pelasgoi&quot; was a cognate of a Proto-Indo-European root and Greek Πέλαγος &quot;pelagos&quot; &quot;sea&quot;.

Georgiev also suggested that the Pelasgians were a sub-group of the Bronze Age Sea Peoples and identifiable in Egyptian inscriptions as the exonym PRŚT or PLŚT. However, this Egyptian name has more often been read as Peleset, a cognate of a Hebrew exonym, פלשת &quot;Peleshet&quot; (Pəlešeth) – that is, the Biblical Philistines.

====Albanian====

In 1854, an Austrian diplomat and Albanian language specialist, Johann Georg von Hahn, identified the Pelasgian language with Proto-Albanian. This theory is not supported by any scientific evidence, and is seen as a myth by modern scholars.

====Undiscovered Indo-European====
Albert Joris Van Windekens (1915–1989) offered rules for an unattested hypothetical Indo-European Pelasgian language, selecting vocabulary for which there was no Greek etymology among the names of places, heroes, animals, plants, garments, artifacts and social organization. His 1952 essay &quot;Le Pélasgique&quot; was skeptically received.

===Pelasgian as pre-Indo-European===
====Unknown origin====

One theory uses the name &quot;Pelasgian&quot; to describe the inhabitants of the lands around the Aegean Sea before the arrival of Proto-Greek speakers, as well as traditionally identified enclaves of descendants that still existed in classical Greece. The theory derives from the original concepts of the philologist Paul Kretschmer, whose views prevailed throughout the first half of the 20th century and are still given some credibility today.

Though Wilamowitz-Moellendorff wrote them off as mythical, the results of archaeological excavations at Çatalhöyük by James Mellaart and Fritz Schachermeyr led them to conclude that the Pelasgians had migrated from Asia Minor to the Aegean basin in the 4th millennium BC. In this theory, a number of possible non-Indo-European linguistic and cultural features are attributed to the Pelasgians:

*Groups of apparently non-Indo-European loan words in the Greek language, borrowed in its prehistoric development.
*Non-Greek and possibly non-Indo-European roots for many Greek toponyms in the region, containing the consonantal strings &quot;-nth-&quot; (e.g., Corinth, Probalinthos, Zakynthos, Amarynthos), or its equivalent &quot;-ns-&quot; (e.g., Tiryns); &quot;-tt-&quot;, e.g., in the peninsula of Attica, Mounts Hymettus and Brilettus/Brilessus, Lycabettus Hill, the deme of Gargettus, etc.; or its equivalent &quot;-ss-&quot;: Larissa, Mount Parnassus, the river names Kephissos and Ilissos, the Cretan cities of Amnis(s)os and Tylissos etc. These strings also appear in other non-Greek, presumably substratally inherited nouns such as &quot;asáminthos&quot; (bathtub), &quot;ápsinthos&quot; (absinth), &quot;terébinthos&quot; (terebinth), etc. Other placenames with no apparent Indo-European etymology include &quot;Athēnai&quot; (Athens), &quot;Mykēnai&quot; (Mycene), Messēnē, &quot;Kyllēnē&quot; (Cyllene), Cyrene, Mytilene, etc. (note the common -ēnai/ēnē ending); also Thebes, Delphi, Lindos, Rhamnus, and others.
*Certain mythological stories or deities that seem to have no parallels in the mythologies of other Indo-European peoples (e. g., the Olympians Athena, Dionysus, Apollo, Artemis, and Aphrodite, whose origins seem Anatolian or Levantine).
*Non-Greek inscriptions in the Mediterranean, such as the Lemnos stele.

The historian George Grote summarizes the theory as follows:

There are, indeed, various names affirmed to designate the ante-Hellenic inhabitants of many parts of Greece – the Pelasgi, the Leleges, the Curetes, the Kaukones, the Aones, the Temmikes, the Hyantes, the Telchines, the Boeotian Thracians, the Teleboae, the Ephyri, the Phlegyae, &amp;c. These are names belonging to legendary, not to historical Greece – extracted out of a variety of conflicting legends by the logographers and subsequent historians, who strung together out of them a supposed history of the past, at a time when the conditions of historical evidence were very little understood. That these names designated real nations may be true but here our knowledge ends.

The poet and mythologist Robert Graves asserts that certain elements of that mythology originate with the native Pelasgian people (namely the parts related to his concept of the White Goddess, an archetypical Earth Goddess) drawing additional support for his conclusion from his interpretations of other ancient literature: Irish, Welsh, Greek, Biblical, Gnostic, and medieval writings.

====Minoan====
According to the Russian historian and linguist Igor M. Diakonoff, the Pelasgians may have been related to the Minoans. A number of scholars consider Minoan to be essentially the same language as Pelasgian.

====Ibero-Caucasian====
Some Georgian scholars (including R. V. Gordeziani, M. G. Abdushelishvili and Z. Gamsakhurdia) connect the Pelasgians with the Ibero-Caucasian peoples of the prehistoric Caucasus, known to the Greeks as Colchians and Iberians. According to Stephen F. Jones, these scholars portray Georgia as a source of spirituality in the Greek world by &quot;manipulating Greek and Roman sources in a highly dubious manner&quot;.

==Archaeology==
===Attica===

During the early 20th century, archaeological excavations conducted by the Italian Archaeological School and by the American Classical School on the Athenian Acropolis and on other sites within Attica revealed Neolithic dwellings, tools, pottery and skeletons from domesticated animals (such as sheep and fish). All of these discoveries showed significant resemblances to the Neolithic discoveries made on the Thessalian acropolises of Sesklo and Dimini. These discoveries help provide physical confirmation of the literary tradition that describes the Athenians as the descendants of the Pelasgians, who appear to descend continuously from the Neolithic inhabitants in Thessaly. Overall, the archaeological evidence indicates that the site of the Acropolis was inhabited by farmers as early as the 6th millennium BC.

The results on the prehistoric material of the American excavations near the Clepsydra have also been analyzed by Immerwahr, arguing (in contrast to Prokopiou) that no Dimini-type pottery was unearthed.

===Lemnos===
In August and September 1926, members of the Italian School of Archaeology conducted trial excavations on the island of Lemnos. A short account of their excavations appeared in the &quot;Messager d&#x27;Athènes&quot; for 3 January 1927. The overall purpose of the excavations was to shed light on the island&#x27;s &quot;Etrusco-Pelasgian&quot; civilization. The excavations were conducted on the site of the city of Hephaisteia (i.e., Palaiopolis) where the Pelasgians, according to Herodotus, surrendered to Miltiades of Athens. There, a necropolis (c. 9th–8th centuries BC) was discovered revealing bronze objects, pots, and more than 130 ossuaries. The ossuaries contained distinctly male and female funeral ornaments. Male ossuaries contained knives and axes whereas female ossuaries contained earrings, bronze pins, necklaces, gold diadems, and bracelets. The decorations on some of the gold objects contained spirals of Mycenean origin, but had no Geometric forms. According to their ornamentation, the pots discovered at the site were from the Geometric period. However, the pots also preserved spirals indicative of Mycenean art. The results of the excavations indicate that the Early Iron Age inhabitants of Lemnos could be a remnant of a Mycenaean population and, in addition, the earliest attested reference to Lemnos is the Mycenaean Greek &quot;ra-mi-ni-ja&quot;, &quot;Lemnian woman&quot;, written in Linear B syllabic script.

===Boeotia===
During the 1980s, the Skourta Plain Project identified Middle Helladic and Late Helladic sites on mountain summits near the plains of Skourta in Boeotia. These fortified mountain settlements were, according to tradition, inhabited by Pelasgians up until the end of the Bronze Age. Moreover, the location of the sites is an indication that the Pelasgian inhabitants sought to distinguish themselves &quot;ethnically&quot; (a fluid term) and economically from the Mycenaean Greeks who controlled the Skourta Plain.

<text>Viking 1 was the first of two spacecraft, along with &quot;Viking 2&quot;, each consisting of an orbiter and a lander, sent to Mars as part of NASA&#x27;s Viking program. The lander touched down on Mars on July 20, 1976, the first successful Mars lander in history. &quot;Viking 1&quot; operated on Mars for days (over 6 years) or Martian solar days, the longest extraterrestrial surface mission until the record was broken by the &quot;Opportunity&quot; rover on May 19, 2010.

== Mission ==
Following launch using a Titan/Centaur launch vehicle on August 20, 1975, and an 11-month cruise to Mars, the orbiter began returning global images of Mars about five days before orbit insertion. The &quot;Viking 1&quot; Orbiter was inserted into Mars orbit on June 19, 1976, and trimmed to a 1,513 x 33,000 km, 24.66 h site certification orbit on June 21. Landing on Mars was planned for July 4, 1976, the United States Bicentennial, but imaging of the primary landing site showed it was too rough for a safe landing. The landing was delayed until a safer site was found, and took place instead on July 20, the seventh anniversary of the Apollo 11 Moon landing. The lander separated from the orbiter at 08:51 UTC and landed at Chryse Planitia at 11:53:06 UTC. It was the first attempt by the United States at landing on Mars.

=== Orbiter ===
The instruments of the orbiter consisted of two vidicon cameras for imaging, an infrared spectrometer for water vapor mapping, and infrared radiometers for thermal mapping. The orbiter primary mission ended at the beginning of solar conjunction on November 5, 1976. The extended mission commenced on December 14, 1976, after solar conjunction. Operations included close approaches to Phobos in February 1977. The periapsis was reduced to 300 km on March 11, 1977. Minor orbit adjustments were done occasionally over the course of the mission, primarily to change the walk rate — the rate at which the areocentric longitude changed with each orbit, and the periapsis was raised to 357 km on July 20, 1979. On August 7, 1980, &quot;Viking 1&quot; Orbiter was running low on attitude control gas and its orbit was raised from 357 × 33,943 km to 320 × 56,000 km to prevent impact with Mars and possible contamination until the year 2019. Operations were terminated on August 17, 1980, after 1,485 orbits. A 2009 analysis concluded that, while the possibility that &quot;Viking 1&quot; had impacted Mars could not be ruled out, it was most likely still in orbit. More than 57,000 images were sent back to Earth.

===Lander===

The lander and its aeroshell separated from the orbiter on July 20 at 08:51 UTC. At the time of separation, the lander was orbiting at about . The aeroshell&#x27;s retrorockets fired to begin the lander de-orbit maneuver. After a few hours at about altitude, the lander was reoriented for atmospheric entry. The aeroshell with its ablative heat shield slowed the craft as it plunged through the atmosphere. During this time, entry science experiments were performed by using a retarding potential analyzer, a mass spectrometer, as well as pressure, temperature, and density sensors. At altitude, traveling at about , the 16 m diameter lander parachutes deployed. Seven seconds later the aeroshell was jettisoned, and eight seconds after that the three lander legs were extended. In 45 seconds, the parachute had slowed the lander to . At altitude, retrorockets on the lander itself were ignited and, 40 seconds later at about , the lander arrived on Mars with a relatively light jolt. The legs had honeycomb aluminum shock absorbers to soften the landing.

The landing rockets used an 18-nozzle design to spread the hydrogen and nitrogen exhaust over a large area. NASA calculated that this approach would mean that the surface would not be heated by more than one 1 °C (1.8 °F), and that it would move no more than of surface material. Since most of Viking&#x27;s experiments focused on the surface material a more straightforward design would not have served.

The &quot;Viking 1&quot; lander touched down in western Chryse Planitia (&quot;Golden Plain&quot;) at at a reference altitude of relative to a reference ellipsoid with an equatorial radius of and a flatness of 0.0105 (22.480° N, 47.967° W planetographic) at 11:53:06 UTC (16:13 local Mars time). Approximately of propellants were left at landing.

Transmission of the first surface image began 25 seconds after landing and took about four minutes (see below). During these minutes the lander activated itself. It erected a high-gain antenna pointed toward Earth for direct communication and deployed a meteorology boom mounted with sensors. In the next seven minutes the second picture of the 300° panoramic scene (displayed below) was taken. On the day after the landing the first colour picture of the surface of Mars (displayed below) was taken. The seismometer failed to uncage, and a sampler arm locking pin was stuck and took five days to shake out. Otherwise, all experiments functioned normally.

The lander had two means of returning data to Earth: a relay link up to the orbiter and back, and by using a direct link to Earth. The orbiter could transmit to Earth (S-band) at 2,000 to 16,000 bit/s (depending on distance between Mars and Earth), and the lander could transmit to the orbiter at 16,000 bit/s. The data capacity of the relay link was about 10 times higher than the direct link.

The lander had two facsimile cameras; three analyses for metabolism, growth or photosynthesis; a gas chromatograph-mass spectrometer; an x-ray fluorescence spectrometer; pressure, temperature and wind velocity sensors; a three-axis seismometer; a magnet on a sampler observed by the cameras; and various engineering sensors.

The &quot;Viking 1&quot; lander was named the Thomas Mutch Memorial Station in January 1981 in honour of Thomas A. Mutch, the leader of the Viking imaging team. The lander operated for 2,245 sols (about 2,306 Earth days or 6 years) until November 11, 1982 (sol ), when a faulty command sent by ground control resulted in loss of contact. The command was intended to uplink new battery charging software to improve the lander&#x27;s deteriorating battery capacity, but it inadvertently overwrote data used by the antenna pointing software. Attempts to contact the lander during the next four months, based on the presumed antenna position, were unsuccessful. In 2006, the &quot;Viking 1&quot; lander was imaged on the Martian surface by the &quot;Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter&quot;.

== Mission results ==
Viking 1 operated on the surface of Mars for around six years (On Nov 11, 1982 the Lander stopped operating after getting a faulty command). The robotic sampler arm successfully scooped up soil samples and tested them with instruments such as the Gas chromatography–mass spectrometer. Atmospheric temperature recordings were as high as -14 C (7 F) at midday, and the predawn summer temperature was -77 C (-107 F). The landers had issues obtaining results from its seismometer.

=== Search for life ===
&quot;Viking 1&quot; carried a biology experiment whose purpose was to look for evidence of life. The Viking lander biological experiments weighed 15.5 kg (34 lbs) and consisted of three subsystems: the pyrolytic release experiment (PR), the labeled release experiment (LR), and the gas exchange experiment (GEX). In addition, independent of the biology experiments, Viking carried a gas chromatograph-mass spectrometer that could measure the composition and abundance of organic compounds in the Martian soil. The results were surprising and interesting: the spectrometer gave a negative result; the PR gave a negative result, the GEX gave a negative result, and the LR gave a positive result. Viking scientist Patricia Straat stated in 2009, &quot;Our [LR] experiment was a definite positive response for life, but a lot of people have claimed that it was a false positive for a variety of reasons.&quot; Most scientists now believe that the data were due to inorganic chemical reactions of the soil; however, this view may be changing after the recent discovery of near-surface ice near the &quot;Viking&quot; landing zone. Some scientists still believe the results were due to living reactions. No organic chemicals were found in the soil. However, dry areas of Antarctica do not have detectable organic compounds either, but they have organisms living in the rocks. Mars has almost no ozone layer, unlike the Earth, so UV light sterilizes the surface and produces highly reactive chemicals such as peroxides that would oxidize any organic chemicals. The &quot;Phoenix&quot; Lander discovered the chemical perchlorate in the Martian soil. Perchlorate is a strong oxidant so it may have destroyed any organic matter on the surface. If it is widespread on Mars, carbon-based life would be difficult at the soil surface.

== Test of general relativity ==
Gravitational time dilation is a phenomenon predicted by the theory of general relativity whereby time passes more slowly in regions of lower gravitational potential. Scientists used the lander to test this hypothesis, by sending radio signals to the lander on Mars, and instructing the lander to send back signals, in cases which sometimes included the signal passing close to the Sun. Scientists found that the observed Shapiro delays of the signals matched the predictions of general relativity.

<doc id="82971" wikidata="Q611171" url="?curid=82971" title="Peitho">
<text>In Greek mythology, Peitho ( or &#x27;winning eloquence&#x27;) is the personification of persuasion. She is typically presented as an important companion of Aphrodite. Her opposite is Bia, the personification of force. As a personification, she was sometimes imagined as a goddess and sometimes an abstract power with her name used both as a common and proper noun. There is evidence that Peitho was referred to as a goddess before she was referred to as an abstract concept, which is rare for a personification. Peitho represents both sexual and political persuasion. She is associated with the art of rhetoric.

== Family ==

Peitho&#x27;s ancestry is unclear, as various authors provide different identities for her parents. Hesiod in &quot;Theogony&quot; identifies Peitho as the daughter of the Titans Tethys and Okeanus, which would make her an Okeanid and the sister of notable goddesses such as Dione, Doris, and Metis. According to the lyric poet Sappho, she was the daughter of Aphrodite. Aeschylus identifies her as the daughter of Aphrodite in &quot;Suppliant Women (Hiketides)&quot;, but also describes her as the child of Ate in &quot;Agamemnon&quot;. Nonnus in his &quot;Dionysiaca&quot; describes the Charites (Graces), an ensemble of goddesses of grace and charm, as including Peitho, Pasithea, and Aglaia, and all of them are identified as daughters of Dionysus. The Hellenistic era elegiac poet Hermesianax also refers to Peitho as one of the Charites. Alcman describes her as the daughter of Prometheia and the sister of Tyche and Eunomia.

Nonnus identifies Peitho as the wife of Hermes, the messenger of the gods. However, commentary on Euripides&#x27; &quot;Orestes&quot; notes that Peitho is the wife of Phoroneus, the primordial King of Argos, and the mother of Aegialeus, Apis, Europs and Niobe. An alternative Argive tradition describes her instead as the wife of Argos, Phoroneus&#x27;s grandson. The Byzantine encyclopedic text, &quot;Suda&quot;, states that the mother of Iynx was either Peitho or Ekho.

==Mythology==
Peitho plays a limited role in mythology, mainly appearing with or as a companion of Aphrodite.

A degraded fragment by Sappho may identify Peitho as an attendant of Aphrodite, although other possibilities are Hebe, Iris, or even Hekate. Pindar characterizes Peitho, either as the abstract concept of persuasion or the goddess, as the wise one that holds the &quot;secret key to holy love&quot;, associating her with Aphrodite. She is also described as the nurse of the baby Erotes, who are Aphrodite&#x27;s children. A fragment by Ibycus describes Aphrodite and Peitho, who is described as tendered eyed (&quot;aganoblepharos&quot;), nursing Euryalus among rose blossoms.

Nonnus gives her a role within the marriage of Kadmos and Harmonia, as she appears to Kadmos in the form of a mortal slave and covers Kadmos in a mist to lead him unseen through Samothrace to the palace of Electra, Harmonia&#x27;s adoptive mother. Peitho often appears on a 5th century epinetron by the Eretria Painter depicting Harmonia’s bridal preparations with Aphrodite, Eros, Persephone (Kore), Hebe, and Himeros as in attendance. In art, she was also depicted at the weddings for Dionysus and Ariadne, Alkestis and Admetos, Thetis and Peleus, and at the union of Aphrodite and Adonis. A hydria attributed to the Meidias Painter shows Peitho fleeing from the scene of the abduction of the Leukippidai by the Dioskuri, indicating either that she persuaded the women into eloping or that she does not condone the marriage by Athenian standards.

When Zeus ordered the creation of the first woman, Pandora, Peitho and the Charites placed golden necklaces around her neck, and the Horae (Seasons) crowned Pandora&#x27;s head with spring flowers. Extravagant jewelry, particularly necklaces, were viewed with suspicion in Ancient Greek literature, as they were typically seen as a way for women to seduce men, making the necklace a way to enhance Pandora’s sexual attractiveness and persuasive abilities.

In art, Peitho is often represented with Aphrodite during the abduction of Helen, symbolizing the forces of persuasion and love at work during the scene. Her presence at the event may be interpreted as either Paris needing persuasion to claim Helen as a prize for choosing Aphrodite, or Helen needing to be persuaded to accompany him to Troy, as Helen&#x27;s level of agency became a popular topic of discussion in the 5th century. Peitho&#x27;s presence brings the question of whether mortals have the ability to resist her power or whether they are bound to her persuasive abilities.

== Cult and function ==
Cults dedicated to Peitho date to at least the early 5th century. In her role as an attendant or companion of Aphrodite, Peitho was intimately connected to the goddess of love and beauty. Aphrodite and Peitho were sometimes conflated, more commonly in the later periods, with the name Peitho appearing in conjunction with or as an epithet of Aphrodite&#x27;s name. She is also identified with Tyche in &quot;Suppliant Women (Hiketides).&quot; Peitho was associated with marriage, since a suitor or his father would negotiate with the father or guardian of a young woman for her hand in marriage and offer a bridal price in return for her. The most desirable women drew many prospective suitors, and persuasive skill often determined the suitor&#x27;s success. Plutarch includes her on a list of five deities for new couples to pray to, also included are Zeus (Teleios), Hera (Teleia), Aphrodite, and Artemis.Peitho was an important figure for emphasising civic harmony, particularly in Athens and Argos, and harmony within interpersonal relationships. Notably in Athens, the unification (synoikismos) of the city by Theseus was only possible with the intervention of both Aphrodite and Peitho to create democratic spirit and cooperation. In Argos, she was paired with the early kings of the city, functioning as a civic unifier in a similar role as Harmonia, the first Queen of Thebes. On a 4th century vase from Apulia, Peitho and Hermes are depicted together instructing Tripolemus to teach agriculture to mankind, indicating Peitho&#x27;s role in creating harmony through civilization. Plutarch outlines Peitho’s role in interpersonal harmony in &quot;Moralia&quot;, where he states that persuasion’s role within a marriage is so that spouses can achieve their wants without quarreling. In &quot;Eumenides&quot;, Athena thanks Peitho after convincing the Furies of her reasoning in acquitting Orestes and successfully defusing strife. However, Peitho may be a destructive force when used for seduction or selfish personal gains, such as in &quot;Agamemnon&quot; where Clytemnestra curses Peitho for Paris’s stealing of Helen, and she uses persuasion to convince Cassandra to enter the house in order to murder her.

=== Cult within Athens ===
Pausanias reports that after the unification (synoikismos) of Athens, Theseus set up a cult of Aphrodite Pandemos and Peitho on the south slope of Acropolis of Athens. In recognition of this myth, both goddesses were worshipped in the Attic Aphrodisia Festival. Peitho was worshipped independently as the goddess of both sexual and rhetorical persuasion in Athens from the 4th century into the Roman Imperial era, the time of Pausanias’s writing. However, some scholars believe it is possible that worship dates to the 6th century, but there is not strong evidence for this assertion. A votive inscription to Peitho was found at the site of the Temple of Aphrodite, reinforcing the link between these goddesses at Athens. The Theatre of Dionysus had seat reserved for the priestess of Peitho. Peitho was an important figure to Athenian rhetoricians in 5th century and was considered an important figure for human affairs, as persuasion was a major component to rhetoric. Rhetorician Isocrates notes in Section 249 of &quot;Antidosis&quot; that sacrifices are made to Peitho in the city annually. Furthermore, comic poet Eupolis said that Peitho sat on the lips of Pericles for his persuasive skills. Persuasion was considered essential for the democratic state&#x27;s success.

=== Cults within other Greek cities ===
Despite her connection to Aphrodite in Athens, Peitho was more commonly associated with Artemis in the Peloponnese, as the two goddesses either shared a temple at Argos or &quot;Peitho&quot; being used as an epithet for Artemis. Peitho’s association with Artemis may have formed due to a shared with importance with adult development and the loss of sexual innocence. At Argos, this temple was also shared with Hypermestra, who was acquitted in trial of a case brought by her father, as she was the only Danaid who did not murder her husband on her wedding night as per her father&#x27;s orders. With this association, Peitho is connected to persuasive speech generally as opposed to just seductive persuasion.

Pindar refers to courtesans and prostitutes in Corinth as &quot;the servants of Peitho&quot;, however, he does not elaborate on whether there was any cults associated with Peitho in the city nor whether courtesans had a particular reverence for the goddess. This passage has stirred debate among scholars one whether sacred prostitution was practiced in Greece. Peitho was commonly shown wearing jewelry, fixing her clothing, holding jars of perfume, or looking into mirrors, traits that may be associated with hetairai.

In Sicyon, Peitho had a cult and a temple, which was connected to the cults of Artemis and Apollo. According to a local cult practice recorded by Pausanias, during the festival of Apollo, seven boys and girls take the statues of Artemis and Apollo to the Sythas River and take them to the sanctuary of Peitho, after which they are returned to the Temple of Apollo. The aetiological myth for this practice was that the citizens of Sicyon refused to purify the twin gods after the slaying of Python, and as a result a plague was sent to the city. Seven boys and girls went to the river to convince the gods to return, they were successful, indicating that even the gods are susceptible to the power of persuasion, and the sanctuary to Peitho was established at this spot. There was no cult image to Peitho by the Roman Imperial Period, however, this does mean that one never existed.

According to Pausanias, in addition to the cults and sanctuaries dedicated to Peitho at Athens and Argos, there was an image decorating the throne at the Temple of Zeus at Olympia where Aphrodite, rising from the sea is greeted by Eros and crowned by Peitho. In Megara, statues of Peitho and Paregoros (personification of soothing words) stood in the Temple of Aphrodite Praxis (of intercourse). There is also evidence that Peitho had cults in Paros, Thasos, and Lesbos.

<doc id="82972" wikidata="Q213440" url="?curid=82972" title="Tyche">
<text>Tyche (; Ancient Greek: Τύχη &quot;Túkhē&quot;, &#x27;Luck&#x27;, , ; Roman equivalent: Fortuna) was the presiding tutelary deity who governed the fortune and prosperity of a city, its destiny. In Classical Greek mythology, she is usually the daughter of the Titans Tethys and Oceanus, or sometimes Zeus, and at this time served to bring positive messages to people, relating to external events outside their control.

During the Hellenistic period, with dramatic socio-political changes starting with Alexander the Great, Tyche increasingly embodied the whims of fate (both negative and positive), eclipsing the role of the Olympic gods. The Greek historian Polybius believed that when no cause can be discovered to events such as floods, droughts, frosts, or even in politics, then the cause of these events may be fairly attributed to Tyche. Other ancient Greek sources corroborate Polybius, such as Pindar who claims Tyche could hand victory to a lesser athlete. This &quot;Hellenistic Tyche&quot; is often featured on coins such as those minted by Demetrius I Soter. Further, Tyche comes to represent not only personal fate, but the fate of communities. Cities venerated their own Tychai, specific iconic versions of the original Tyche. This practice was continued in the iconography of Roman art, even into the Christian period, often as sets of the greatest cities of the empire.

Tyche was further absorbed into the Parthian Empire, who frequently depicted Tyche in their coins, as well as in imagery bestowing legitimacy to Parthian kings.

==Mythology==

=== Family ===
In literature, Tyche might be given various genealogies. She has been described as a daughter of Oceanus and Tethys, thus one of the Oceanids, or of Zeus, or even Prometheus. She was connected with Nemesis and Agathos Daimon (&quot;good spirit&quot;).

She is sometimes named as the mother of Plutus, the god of wealth; usually, however, he is the son of Demeter and Iasion.

=== Hero myths ===
According to the Pausanias in his &quot;Description of Greece&quot;, Palamedes created the first pair of dice and gave them as an offering to Tyche.

==Worship==
Tyche was uniquely venerated at Itanos in Crete, as &quot;Tyche Protogeneia&quot;, linked with the Athenian Protogeneia (&quot;firstborn&quot;), daughter of Erechtheus, whose self-sacrifice saved the city. In Alexandria the &quot;Tychaeon&quot;, the Greek temple of Tyche, was described by Libanius as one of the most magnificent of the entire Hellenistic world.

Stylianos Spyridacis concisely expressed Tyche&#x27;s appeal in a Hellenistic world of arbitrary violence and unmeaning reverses: &quot;In the turbulent years of the Epigoni of Alexander, an awareness of the instability of human affairs led people to believe that Tyche, the blind mistress of Fortune, governed mankind with an inconstancy which explained the vicissitudes of the time.&quot;

According to Matheson, the Goddess Tyche was often worshipped as the personification of a city and its fortune. Matheson also states that there were cults to Tyche all over the Mediterranean. In Athens for instance, citizens would give tribute to &quot;Agathe Tyche&quot; alongside other gods. Other gods seem to also be presented alongside Tyche including Dionysus at Corinth.

There was a Temple of Tyche that contained a figure called Nemesis-Tyche, an aspect of Tyche. According to Edwards, Nemesis and Tyche begin to share cults in the Roman period.

The mural crown of Tyche of Sparta depicts the Spartans soldiers repelling Amazons. Palagia argues that this depiction is important to Spartan mythology.

&quot;Automatia&quot; and &quot;Meilichius&quot; were two epithets of Tyche.

==Depictions==

Tyche appears on many coins of the Hellenistic period in the three centuries before the Christian era, especially from cities in the Aegean. Unpredictable turns of fortune drive the complicated plotlines of Hellenistic romances, such as, &quot;Leucippe and Clitophon&quot; or &quot;Daphnis and Chloe&quot;. She experienced a resurgence in another era of uneasy change, the final days of publicly sanctioned Paganism, between the late-fourth-century emperors Julian and Theodosius I, who definitively closed the temples. The effectiveness of her capricious power even achieved respectability in philosophical circles during that generation, although among poets it was a commonplace to revile her for a fickle harlot.

The constellation of Virgo is sometimes identified as the heavenly figure of Tyche, as well as other goddesses such as Demeter and Astraea.

=== Tyche in art ===
In Greco-Roman and medieval art, Tyche was depicted as wearing a mural crown, and carrying a cornucopia (horn of plenty), an emblematic gubernaculum (ship&#x27;s rudder), and the wheel of fortune, or she may stand on the wheel, presiding over the entire circle of fate.

The mural crown&#x27;s significance is that it identifies her as the goddess of the city, and in the case of Sparta her mural crown depicted a part of their foundation myth of their city. The mural crown is often used by archeologists and historians to identify a figure in art as Tyche.

According to Matheson the Goddess Tyche, being one of the Oceanids, is considered to be an ocean goddess of some kind. Citing how Pindar refers to her in his poems, &quot;he implores her to keep watch around Himera, a port&quot; and how she is often depicted holding a ship&#x27;s rudder.

=== Tyche in theatre ===
The play writer Euripides used Tyche as a literary device and personification. Apollo is said to direct Tyche and even the god&#x27;s plans can be influenced by the concept of Tyche.

=== Tyche in poetry ===
The poet Pindar alludes to Tyche as a goddess of fate who can control the outcome of athletic contests, according to Giannopoulou.

==Greco-Roman Tyche==

In late Roman sets the figures, usually four, represented the Tychai of Rome, Constantinople, Alexandria, and either Antioch (more usual, as in the Esquiline Treasure of about 380 AD) or Trier, as in the Calendar of 354. The Tychai may be seen wearing a mural crown (a crown like the walls of the city).

Another common depiction of Tyche in the Greco-Roman period was Nemesis-Tyche.

=== Tyche of Rome ===
The Tyche of Rome was represented &quot;in military costume&quot; according to Amin. In Rome and the other parts of the Western Roman Empire she was referred to as Fortuna.

=== Tyche of Constantinople ===
Amin mentions that the attributes of the Tyche of Constantinople included a cornucopia. Tyche was still a figure in Constantinople, depicted on coins well into early Christian Rome. Matheson argues that the Tyche of Constantinople replaced the one of Antioch as the typical representation.

=== Tyche of Alexandria ===
The Tyche of Alexandria &quot;hold sheaves of corns and rests her foot on the bow of a ship&quot; as described by Amin. This could be related to how other depictions of Tyche, like the one in Sparta, are seen with ships rudders. This is because she can steer events argues Matheson. Also, Pindar describes her power over ships &quot;At thy bidding, swift ships are steered upon the sea.

=== Tyche of Antioch ===

Several artefacts feature the Tyche of Antioch with a male swimmer personifying the Orontes River at her feet according to Amin. Her importance to the river is also strengthened by her being considered an Oceanid, according to Giannopoulou. The Antiochene Tyche maintained relevance much later into the Christian dominated empire, as show by official &quot;Pentanummium&quot; coins minted during the reigns of Justin (r. 518-527) and Justinian (r. 527-565) that depict her in her temple on the reverse.

== Tyche in the Parthian Empire ==

In the early years of the Parthian Empire, Parthian kings, starting with Mithridates I (165 BC) utilized imagery of the Olympian gods in their coinage, often with the term ΦΙΛΕΛΛΗΝΟΣ (friend of the Greeks) as a conciliatory gesture to subject Greek people living in the former Seleucid Empire lands. However, by the time of Vologases I (51 AD), the only Greek imagery used on coins was the goddess Tyche, who continued to be represented on Parthian coins for the next 200 years. In later imagery, Tyche provides the Khvarenah or projection of divine rulership in Zoroastrianism to the worthy king. It is unclear whether this &quot;Parthian Tyche&quot; simultaneously represented a Zoroastrian goddess such as Anahita or Ashi, or possibly another.

<text>In Plato&#x27;s &quot;Symposium&quot;, Penia (Ancient Greek: , &quot;Penía&quot;), or Penae (Latin: &quot;Poverty&quot;, &quot;Deficiency&quot;), is the personification of poverty and need. She conceived Eros with an intoxicated Porus (&quot;Resource&quot;, &quot;Contrivance&quot;) in Zeus&#x27;s garden while at Aphrodite&#x27;s birthday. Her sisters are Amechania and Ptocheia. Penia was also mentioned by other ancient Greek writers such as Alcaeus (Fragment 364), Theognis (Fragment 1; 267, 351, 649), Aristophanes (&quot;Plutus&quot;, 414ff), Herodotus, Plutarch (&quot;Life of Themistocles&quot;), and Philostratus (&quot;Life of Apollonius&quot;).

== Mythology ==

===Plato&#x27;s account===
Perhaps one of the most famous mentions is in Plato&#x27;s Symposium (203b–e), a Socratic Dialogue written by Plato c. 385–370 BC. She is part of a story narrated by Socrates, that he originally heard from a priestess by the name of Diotima. There, Penia appears during a banquet thrown by the gods to celebrate the birth of Aphrodite, in order to beg. In the hope for alleviating her misery, she sleeps with Poros, god of wealth, while he is intoxicated from drinking too much, resulting in the birth of Eros, God of Love; who is a combination of both his parents, in that he is forever in need and forever pursuing.

=== Aristophanes&#x27; portrayal ===
In her portrayal by the playwright Aristophanes, Penia attempts to convince two foolish men about the dangers of allowing wealth to be abundant for everybody. She debates the issue of motivation among those who are wealthy; by acquiring a luxurious life, humans will not see a need to put in effort to produce goods and products. She explains that there will come a time where mankind will not be able to purchase much of anything because of low supply, and people will end up working significantly harder than before in order to obtain food or build furniture. She understands that she is resented, but also knows that she is vital for maintaining the continuity of mankind.

<doc id="82974" wikidata="Q202387" url="?curid=82974" title="Post-traumatic stress disorder">
<text>Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a mental and behavioral disorder that develops from experiencing a traumatic event, such as sexual assault, domestic violence, child abuse, warfare and its associated traumas, natural disaster, traffic collision, or other threats on a person&#x27;s life or well-being. Symptoms may include disturbing thoughts, feelings, or dreams related to the events, mental or physical distress to trauma-related cues, attempts to avoid trauma-related cues, alterations in the way a person thinks and feels, and an increase in the fight-or-flight response. These symptoms last for more than a month after the event and can include triggers such as misophonia. Young children are less likely to show distress, but instead may express their memories through play.

A person with PTSD is at a higher risk of suicide and intentional self-harm. PTSD may provoke violent behavior by the sufferer.
Most people who experience traumatic events do not develop PTSD. People who experience interpersonal violence such as rape, other sexual assaults, being kidnapped, stalking, physical abuse by an intimate partner, and childhood abuse are more likely to develop PTSD than those who experience non-assault based trauma, such as accidents and natural disasters. Those who experience prolonged trauma, such as slavery, concentration camps, or chronic domestic abuse, may develop complex post-traumatic stress disorder (C-PTSD). C-PTSD is similar to PTSD, but has a distinct effect on a person&#x27;s emotional regulation and core identity.
Prevention may be possible when counselling is targeted at those with early symptoms, but is not effective when provided to all trauma-exposed individuals regardless of whether symptoms are present. The main treatments for people with PTSD are counselling (psychotherapy) and medication. Antidepressants of the SSRI or SNRI type are the first-line medications used for PTSD and are moderately beneficial for about half of people. Benefits from medication are less than those seen with counselling. It is not known whether using medications and counselling together has greater benefit than either method separately. Medications, other than some SSRIs or SNRIs, do not have enough evidence to support their use and, in the case of benzodiazepines, may worsen outcomes.
In the United States, about 3.5% of adults have PTSD in a given year, and 9% of people develop it at some point in their life. In much of the rest of the world, rates during a given year are between 0.5% and 1%. Higher rates may occur in regions of armed conflict. It is more common in women than men.

Symptoms of trauma-related mental disorders have been documented since at least the time of the ancient Greeks. A few instances of evidence of post-traumatic illness have been argued to exist from the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, such as the diary of Samuel Pepys, who described intrusive and distressing symptoms following the 1666 Fire of London. During the world wars, the condition was known under various terms, including &#x27;shell shock&#x27;, &#x27;war nerves&#x27;, neurasthenia and &#x27;combat neurosis&#x27;. The term &quot;post-traumatic stress disorder&quot; came into use in the 1970s, in large part due to the diagnoses of U.S. military veterans of the Vietnam War. It was officially recognized by the American Psychiatric Association in 1980 in the third edition of the &quot;Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders&quot; (DSM-III).
== Signs and symptoms ==
Symptoms of PTSD generally begin within the first three months after the inciting traumatic event, but may not begin until years later. In the typical case, the individual with PTSD persistently avoids either trauma-related thoughts and emotions or discussion of the traumatic event and may even have amnesia of the event (dissociative amnesia). However, the event is commonly relived by the individual through intrusive, recurrent recollections, dissociative episodes of reliving the trauma (&quot;flashbacks&quot;), and nightmares (50 to 70%). While it is common to have symptoms after any traumatic event, these must persist to a sufficient degree (i.e., causing dysfunction in life or clinical levels of distress) for longer than one month after the trauma to be classified as PTSD (clinically significant dysfunction or distress for less than one month after the trauma may be acute stress disorder). Some following a traumatic event experience post-traumatic growth.

=== Associated medical conditions ===
Trauma survivors often develop depression, anxiety disorders, and mood disorders in addition to PTSD. More than 50% of those with PTSD have co-morbid anxiety, mood, or substance use disorders.

Substance use disorder, such as alcohol use disorder, commonly co-occur with PTSD. Recovery from post-traumatic stress disorder or other anxiety disorders may be hindered, or the condition worsened, when substance use disorders are comorbid with PTSD. Resolving these problems can bring about improvement in an individual&#x27;s mental health status and anxiety levels.

PTSD has a strong association with tinnitus, and speculation exists that PTSD may cause some tinnitus seen in association with the condition.

In children and adolescents, there is a strong association between emotional regulation difficulties (e.g., mood swings, anger outbursts, temper tantrums) and post-traumatic stress symptoms, independent of age, gender, or type of trauma.

Moral injury, the feeling of moral distress such as a shame or guilt following a moral transgression, is associated with PTSD but is distinguished from it. Moral injury is associated with shame and guilt, while PTSD is associated with anxiety and fear.

In a population based study examining veterans of the Vietnam War, the presence of PTSD and exposure to high level stressors on the battlefield were associated with a two-fold increased risk of death, with the leading causes of death being ischemic heart disease or cancers of the respiratory tract including lung cancer.

== Risk factors ==

Persons considered at risk for developing PTSD include combat military personnel, survivors of natural disasters, concentration camp survivors, and survivors of violent crime. Persons employed in occupations that expose them to violence (such as soldiers) or disasters (such as emergency service workers) are also at risk. Other occupations at an increased risk include police officers, firefighters, first responders, ambulance personnel, health care professionals, train drivers, divers, journalists, and sailors, as well as people who work at banks, post offices, or in stores. The intensity of the traumatic event is also associated with a subsequent risk of developing PTSD, with experiences related to witnessed death, or witnessed or experienced torture, injury, bodily disfigurement, traumatic brain injury being highly associated with the development of PTSD. Similarly, experiences that are unexpected or in which the victim cannot escape are also associated with a high risk of developing PTSD.

=== Trauma ===

PTSD has been associated with a wide range of traumatic events. The risk of developing PTSD after a traumatic event varies by trauma type and is the highest following exposure to sexual violence (11.4%), particularly rape (19.0%). Men are more likely to experience a traumatic event (of any type), but women are more likely to experience the kind of high-impact traumatic event that can lead to PTSD, such as interpersonal violence and sexual assault.

Motor vehicle collision survivors, both children and adults, are at an increased risk of PTSD. Globally, about 2.6% of adults are diagnosed with PTSD following a non-life-threatening traffic accident, and a similar proportion of children develop PTSD. Risk of PTSD almost doubles to 4.6% for life-threatening auto accidents. Females were more likely to be diagnosed with PTSD following a road traffic accident, whether the accident occurred during childhood or adulthood.

Post-traumatic stress reactions have been studied in children and adolescents. The rate of PTSD might be lower in children than adults, but in the absence of therapy, symptoms may continue for decades. One estimate suggests that the proportion of children and adolescents having PTSD in a non-wartorn population in a developed country may be 1% compared to 1.5% to 3% of adults. On average, 16% of children exposed to a traumatic event develop PTSD, with the incidence varying according to type of exposure and gender. Similar to the adult population, risk factors for PTSD in children include: female gender, exposure to disasters (natural or man-made), negative coping behaviors, and/or lacking proper social support systems.

Predictor models have consistently found that childhood trauma, chronic adversity, neurobiological differences, and familial stressors are associated with risk for PTSD after a traumatic event in adulthood. It has been difficult to find consistently aspects of the events that predict, but peritraumatic dissociation has been a fairly consistent predictive indicator of the development of PTSD. Proximity to, duration of, and severity of the trauma make an impact. It has been speculated that interpersonal traumas cause more problems than impersonal ones, but this is controversial. The risk of developing PTSD is increased in individuals who are exposed to physical abuse, physical assault, or kidnapping. Women who experience physical violence are more likely to develop PTSD than men.

==== Intimate partner and sexual violence ====
An individual that has been exposed to domestic violence is predisposed to the development of PTSD. There is a strong association between the development of PTSD in mothers that experienced domestic violence during the perinatal period of their pregnancy.

Those who have experienced sexual assault or rape may develop symptoms of PTSD. The likelihood of sustained symptoms of PTSD is higher if the rapist confined or restrained the person, if the person being raped believed the rapist would kill them, the person who was raped was very young or very old, and if the rapist was someone they knew. The likelihood of sustained severe symptoms is also higher if people around the survivor ignore (or are ignorant of) the rape or blame the rape survivor.

==== War-related trauma, refugees ====

Military service in combat is a risk factor for developing PTSD. Around 22% of people exposed to combat develop PTSD; in about 25% of military personnel who develop PTSD, its appearance is delayed.

Refugees are also at an increased risk for PTSD due to their exposure to war, hardships, and traumatic events. The rates for PTSD within refugee populations range from 4% to 86%. While the stresses of war affect everyone involved, displaced persons have been shown to be more so than others.

Challenges related to the overall psychosocial well-being of refugees are complex and individually nuanced. Refugees have reduced levels of well-being and a high rate of mental distress due to past and ongoing trauma. Groups that are particularly affected and whose needs often remain unmet are women, older people, and unaccompanied minors. Post-traumatic stress and depression in refugee populations also tend to affect their educational success.

==== Unexpected death of a loved one ====
Sudden, unexpected death of a loved one is the most common traumatic event type reported in cross-national studies. However, the majority of people who experience this type of event will not develop PTSD. An analysis from the WHO World Mental Health Surveys found a 5.2% risk of developing PTSD after learning of the unexpected death of a loved one. Because of the high prevalence of this type of traumatic event, unexpected death of a loved one accounts for approximately 20% of PTSD cases worldwide.

==== Life-threatening and/or severe illness ====
Medical conditions associated with an increased risk of PTSD include cancer, heart attack, and stroke. 22% of cancer survivors present with lifelong PTSD like symptoms. Intensive-care unit (ICU) hospitalization is also a risk factor for PTSD. Some women experience PTSD from their experiences related to breast cancer and mastectomy. Loved ones of those who experience life-threatening illnesses are also at risk for developing PTSD, such as parents of a child with chronic illnesses.

===== Psychosis spectrum conditions =====
Research exists which demonstrates that survivors of psychotic episodes, which exist in diseases such as schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, bipolar I disorder, and others, are at greater risk of developing PTSD. This is often due to the experiences one may have during and after psychosis. Such traumatic experiences include, but are not limited to, experiences in psychiatric hospitals, police interactions, social stigma, and embarrassment due to psychotic behavior, suicidal behavior and attempts, distressing delusions and hallucinations, and the fear of losing control or actual loss of control. The incidence of PTSD in survivors of psychosis may be as low as 11% and as high at 67%.

===== Cancer =====
Prevalence estimates of cancer‐related PTSD range between 7% and 14%, with an additional 10% to 20% of patients experiencing subsyndromal post-traumatic stress symptoms (PTSS). Both PTSD and PTSS have been associated with increased distress and impaired quality of life, and have been reported in newly diagnosed patients as well as in long‐term survivors.

The PTSD Field Trials for the &quot;Diagnostic and Statistical Manual, Fourth Edition&quot; (DSM-IV), revealed that 22% of cancer survivors present with lifetime cancer-related PTSD (CR-PTSD), endorsing cancer diagnosis and treatment as a traumatic stressor.

Therefore, as the number of people diagnosed with cancer increases and cancer survivorship improves, cancer-related PTSD becomes a more prominent issue, and thus, providing for cancer patients&#x27; physical and psychological needs becomes increasingly important.

Evidence‐based treatments such as eye movement desensitization and reprocessing (EMDR) and cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) are available for PTSD, and indeed, there have been promising reports of their effectiveness in cancer patients.

==== Pregnancy-related trauma ====

Women who experience miscarriage are at risk of PTSD. Those who experience subsequent miscarriages have an increased risk of PTSD compared to those experiencing only one. PTSD can also occur after childbirth and the risk increases if a woman has experienced trauma prior to the pregnancy. Prevalence of PTSD following normal childbirth (that is, excluding stillbirth or major complications) is estimated to be between 2.8 and 5.6% at six weeks postpartum, with rates dropping to 1.5% at six months postpartum. Symptoms of PTSD are common following childbirth, with prevalence of 24–30.1% at six weeks, dropping to 13.6% at six months. Emergency childbirth is also associated with PTSD.

==== Natural disasters ====
=== Genetics ===

There is evidence that susceptibility to PTSD is hereditary. Approximately 30% of the variance in PTSD is caused from genetics alone. For twin pairs exposed to combat in Vietnam, having a monozygotic (identical) twin with PTSD was associated with an increased risk of the co-twin&#x27;s having PTSD compared to twins that were dizygotic (non-identical twins). Women with a smaller hippocampus might be more likely to develop PTSD following a traumatic event based on preliminary findings. Research has also found that PTSD shares many genetic influences common to other psychiatric disorders. Panic and generalized anxiety disorders and PTSD share 60% of the same genetic variance. Alcohol, nicotine, and drug dependence share greater than 40% genetic similarities.

== Pathophysiology ==

=== Neuroendocrinology ===
PTSD symptoms may result when a traumatic event causes an over-reactive adrenaline response, which creates deep neurological patterns in the brain. These patterns can persist long after the event that triggered the fear, making an individual hyper-responsive to future fearful situations. During traumatic experiences, the high levels of stress hormones secreted suppress hypothalamic activity that may be a major factor toward the development of PTSD.

PTSD causes biochemical changes in the brain and body, that differ from other psychiatric disorders such as major depression. Individuals diagnosed with PTSD respond more strongly to a dexamethasone suppression test than individuals diagnosed with clinical depression.

Most people with PTSD show a low secretion of cortisol and high secretion of catecholamines in urine, with a norepinephrine/cortisol ratio consequently higher than comparable non-diagnosed individuals. This is in contrast to the normative fight-or-flight response, in which both catecholamine and cortisol levels are elevated after exposure to a stressor.

Brain catecholamine levels are high, and corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) concentrations are high. Together, these findings suggest abnormality in the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis.

The maintenance of fear has been shown to include the HPA axis, the locus coeruleus-noradrenergic systems, and the connections between the limbic system and frontal cortex. The HPA axis that coordinates the hormonal response to stress, which activates the LC-noradrenergic system, is implicated in the over-consolidation of memories that occurs in the aftermath of trauma. This over-consolidation increases the likelihood of one&#x27;s developing PTSD. The amygdala is responsible for threat detection and the conditioned and unconditioned fear responses that are carried out as a response to a threat.

The HPA axis is responsible for coordinating the hormonal response to stress. Given the strong cortisol suppression to dexamethasone in PTSD, HPA axis abnormalities are likely predicated on strong negative feedback inhibition of cortisol, itself likely due to an increased sensitivity of glucocorticoid receptors.

PTSD has been hypothesized to be a maladaptive learning pathway to fear response through a hypersensitive, hyperreactive, and hyperresponsive HPA axis.

Low cortisol levels may predispose individuals to PTSD: Following war trauma, Swedish soldiers serving in Bosnia and Herzegovina with low pre-service salivary cortisol levels had a higher risk of reacting with PTSD symptoms, following war trauma, than soldiers with normal pre-service levels. Because cortisol is normally important in restoring homeostasis after the stress response, it is thought that trauma survivors with low cortisol experience a poorly contained—that is, longer and more distressing—response, setting the stage for PTSD.

It is thought that the locus coeruleus-noradrenergic system mediates the over-consolidation of fear memory. High levels of cortisol reduce noradrenergic activity, and because people with PTSD tend to have reduced levels of cortisol, it has been proposed that individuals with PTSD cannot regulate the increased noradrenergic response to traumatic stress. Intrusive memories and conditioned fear responses are thought to be a result of the response to associated triggers. Neuropeptide Y (NPY) has been reported to reduce the release of norepinephrine and has been demonstrated to have anxiolytic properties in animal models. Studies have shown people with PTSD demonstrate reduced levels of NPY, possibly indicating their increased anxiety levels.

Other studies indicate that people with PTSD have chronically low levels of serotonin, which contributes to the commonly associated behavioral symptoms such as anxiety, ruminations, irritability, aggression, suicidality, and impulsivity. Serotonin also contributes to the stabilization of glucocorticoid production.

Dopamine levels in a person with PTSD can contribute to symptoms: low levels can contribute to anhedonia, apathy, impaired attention, and motor deficits; high levels can contribute to psychosis, agitation, and restlessness.

Studies have also described elevated concentrations of the thyroid hormone triiodothyronine in PTSD. This kind of type 2 allostatic adaptation may contribute to increased sensitivity to catecholamines and other stress mediators.

Hyperresponsiveness in the norepinephrine system can also be caused by continued exposure to high stress. Overactivation of norepinephrine receptors in the prefrontal cortex can be connected to the flashbacks and nightmares frequently experienced by those with PTSD. A decrease in other norepinephrine functions (awareness of the current environment) prevents the memory mechanisms in the brain from processing the experience, and emotions the person is experiencing during a flashback are not associated with the current environment.

There is considerable controversy within the medical community regarding the neurobiology of PTSD. A 2012 review showed no clear relationship between cortisol levels and PTSD. The majority of reports indicate people with PTSD have elevated levels of corticotropin-releasing hormone, lower basal cortisol levels, and enhanced negative feedback suppression of the HPA axis by dexamethasone.

=== Neuroimmunology ===
Studies on the peripheral immune have found dysfunction with elevated cytokine levels and a higher risk of immune-related chronic diseases among individuals with PTSD. Neuroimmune dysfunction has also been found in PTSD, raising the possibility of a suppressed central immune response due to reduced activity of microglia in the brain in response to immune challenges. Individuals with PTSD, compared to controls, have lower increase in a marker of microglial activation (18-kDa translocator protein) following lipopolysaccharide administration. This neuroimmune suppression is also associated with greater severity of anhedonic symptoms. Researchers suggest that treatments aimed at restoring neuroimmune function could be beneficial for alleviating PTSD symptoms.

=== Neuroanatomy ===
A meta-analysis of structural MRI studies found an association with reduced total brain volume, intracranial volume, and volumes of the hippocampus, insula cortex, and anterior cingulate. Much of this research stems from PTSD in those exposed to the Vietnam War.

People with PTSD have decreased brain activity in the dorsal and rostral anterior cingulate cortices and the ventromedial prefrontal cortex, areas linked to the experience and regulation of emotion.

The amygdala is strongly involved in forming emotional memories, especially fear-related memories. During high stress, the hippocampus, which is associated with placing memories in the correct context of space and time and memory recall, is suppressed. According to one theory, this suppression may be the cause of the flashbacks that can affect people with PTSD. When someone with PTSD undergoes stimuli similar to the traumatic event, the body perceives the event as occurring again because the memory was never properly recorded in the person&#x27;s memory.

The amygdalocentric model of PTSD proposes that the amygdala is very much aroused and insufficiently controlled by the medial prefrontal cortex and the hippocampus, in particular during extinction. This is consistent with an interpretation of PTSD as a syndrome of deficient extinction ability.

The basolateral nucleus (BLA) of the amygdala is responsible for the comparison and development of associations between unconditioned and conditioned responses to stimuli, which results in the fear conditioning present in PTSD. The BLA activates the central nucleus (CeA) of the amygdala, which elaborates the fear response, (including behavioral response to threat and elevated startle response). Descending inhibitory inputs from the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) regulate the transmission from the BLA to the CeA, which is hypothesized to play a role in the extinction of conditioned fear responses.

While as a whole, amygdala hyperactivity is reported by meta analysis of functional neuroimaging in PTSD, there is a large degree of heterogeniety, more so than in social anxiety disorder or phobic disorder. Comparing dorsal (roughly the CeA) and ventral (roughly the BLA) clusters, hyperactivity is more robust in the ventral cluster, while hypoactivity is evident in the dorsal cluster. The distinction may explain the blunted emotions in PTSD (via desensitization in the CeA) as well as the fear related component.

In a 2007 study, Vietnam War combat veterans with PTSD showed a 20% reduction in the volume of their hippocampus compared with veterans who did not have such symptoms. This finding was not replicated in chronic PTSD patients traumatized at an air show plane crash in 1988 (Ramstein, Germany).

Evidence suggests that endogenous cannabinoid levels are reduced in PTSD, particularly anandamide, and that cannabinoid receptors (CB1) are increased in order to compensate. There appears to be a link between increased CB1 receptor availability in the amygdala and abnormal threat processing and hyperarousal, but not dysphoria, in trauma survivors.

A 2020 study found no evidence for conclusions from prior research that suggested low IQ is a risk factor for developing PTSD.

== Diagnosis ==
PTSD can be difficult to diagnose, because of:
* the subjective nature of most of the diagnostic criteria (although this is true for many mental disorders); 
* the potential for over-reporting, e.g., while seeking disability benefits, or when PTSD could be a mitigating factor at criminal sentencing
* the potential for under-reporting, e.g., stigma, pride, fear that a PTSD diagnosis might preclude certain employment opportunities;
* symptom overlap with other mental disorders such as obsessive compulsive disorder and generalized anxiety disorder;
* association with other mental disorders such as major depressive disorder and generalized anxiety disorder;
* substance use disorders, which often produce some of the same signs and symptoms as PTSD; and 
* substance use disorders can increase vulnerability to PTSD or exacerbate PTSD symptoms or both; and
* PTSD increases the risk for developing substance use disorders.
*the differential expression of symptoms culturally (specifically with respect to avoidance and numbing symptoms, distressing dreams, and somatic symptoms)

=== Screening ===
There are a number of PTSD screening instruments for adults, such as the PTSD Checklist for &quot;DSM-5&quot; (PCL-5) and the Primary Care PTSD Screen for &quot;DSM-5&quot; (PC-PTSD-5). The 17 item PTSD checklist is also capable of monitoring the severity of symptoms and the response to treatment.

There are also several screening and assessment instruments for use with children and adolescents. These include the Child PTSD Symptom Scale (CPSS), Child Trauma Screening Questionnaire, and UCLA Post-traumatic Stress Disorder Reaction Index for &quot;DSM-IV&quot;.

In addition, there are also screening and assessment instruments for caregivers of very young children (six years of age and younger). These include the Young Child PTSD Screen, the Young Child PTSD Checklist, and the Diagnostic Infant and Preschool Assessment.

=== Assessment ===
Evidence-based assessment principles, including a multimethod assessment approach, form the foundation of PTSD assessment. Those who conduct assessments for PTSD may use various clinician-administered interviews and instruments to provide an official PTSD diagnosis. Some commonly used, reliable, and valid assessment instruments for PTSD diagnosis, in accordance with the DSM-5, include the Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale for the DSM-5 (CAPS-5), PTSD Symptom Scale Interview (PSS-I-5), and Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-5 – PTSD Module (SCID-5 PTSD Module).

=== In the DSM and ICD ===
PTSD was classified as an anxiety disorder in the DSM-IV, but has since been reclassified as a &quot;trauma- and stressor-related disorder&quot; in the DSM-5. The DSM-5 diagnostic criteria for PTSD include four symptom clusters: re-experiencing, avoidance, negative alterations in cognition/mood, and alterations in arousal and reactivity.

The International Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, 10th Revision (ICD-10) classifies PTSD under &quot;Reaction to severe stress, and adjustment disorders.&quot; The ICD-10 criteria for PTSD include re-experiencing, avoidance, and either increased reactivity or inability to recall certain details related to the event.

The ICD-11 diagnostic description for PTSD contains three components or symptom groups (1) re-experiencing, (2) avoidance, and (3) heightened sense of threat. ICD-11 no longer includes verbal thoughts about the traumatic event as a symptom. There is a predicted lower rate of diagnosed PTSD using ICD-11 compared to ICD-10 or DSM-5. ICD-11 also proposes identifying a distinct group with complex post-traumatic stress disorder (CPTSD), who have more often experienced several or sustained traumas and have greater functional impairment than those with PTSD.

=== Differential diagnosis ===
A diagnosis of PTSD requires that the person has been exposed to an extreme stressor. Any stressor can result in a diagnosis of adjustment disorder and it is an appropriate diagnosis for a stressor and a symptom pattern that does not meet the criteria for PTSD.

The symptom pattern for acute stress disorder must occur and be resolved within four weeks of the trauma. If it lasts longer, and the symptom pattern fits that characteristic of PTSD, the diagnosis may be changed.

Obsessive–compulsive disorder (OCD) may be diagnosed for intrusive thoughts that are recurring but not related to a specific traumatic event.

In extreme cases of prolonged, repeated traumatization where there is no viable chance of escape, survivors may develop complex post-traumatic stress disorder. This occurs as a result of layers of trauma rather than a single traumatic event, and includes additional symptomatology, such as the loss of a coherent sense of self.

== Prevention ==

Modest benefits have been seen from early access to cognitive behavioral therapy. Critical incident stress management has been suggested as a means of preventing PTSD, but subsequent studies suggest the likelihood of its producing negative outcomes. A 2019 Cochrane review did not find any evidence to support the use of an intervention offered to everyone, and that &quot;multiple session interventions may result in worse outcome than no intervention for some individuals.&quot; The World Health Organization recommends against the use of benzodiazepines and antidepressants in for acute stress (symptoms lasting less than one month). Some evidence supports the use of hydrocortisone for prevention in adults, although there is limited or no evidence supporting propranolol, escitalopram, temazepam, or gabapentin.

=== Psychological debriefing ===
Trauma-exposed individuals often receive treatment called &quot;psychological debriefing&quot; in an effort to prevent PTSD, which consists of interviews that are meant to allow individuals to directly confront the event and share their feelings with the counselor and to help structure their memories of the event. However, several meta-analyses find that psychological debriefing is unhelpful, is potentially harmful and does not reduce the future risk of developing PTSD. This is true for both single-session debriefing and multiple session interventions. As of 2017 the American Psychological Association assessed psychological debriefing as &quot;No Research Support/Treatment is Potentially Harmful&quot;.

=== Early intervention ===
Trauma focused intervention delivered within days or weeks of the potentially traumatic event has been found to decrease PTSD symptoms. Similar to psychological debriefing, the goal of early intervention is to lessen the intensity and frequency of stress symptoms, with the aim of preventing new-onset or relapsed mental disorders and further distress later in the healing process.

=== Risk-targeted interventions ===

Risk-targeted interventions are those that attempt to mitigate specific formative information or events. It can target modeling normal behaviors, instruction on a task, or giving information on the event.

== Management ==
Reviews of studies have found that combination therapy (psychological and pharmacotherapy) is no more effective than psychological therapy alone.

=== Counselling ===
The approaches with the strongest evidence include behavioral and cognitive-behavioral therapies such as prolonged exposure therapy, cognitive processing therapy (CBT), and eye movement desensitization and reprocessing (EMDR). There is some evidence for brief eclectic psychotherapy (BEP), narrative exposure therapy (NET), and written exposure therapy.

A 2019 Cochrane review evaluated couples and family therapies compared to no care and individual and group therapies for the treatment of PTSD. There were too few studies on couples therapies to determine if substantive benefits were derived, but preliminary RCTs suggested that couples therapies may be beneficial for reducing PTSD symptoms.

A meta-analytic comparison of EMDR and CBT found both protocols indistinguishable in terms of effectiveness in treating PTSD; however, &quot;the contribution of the eye movement component in EMDR to treatment outcome&quot; is unclear. A meta-analysis in children and adolescents also found that EMDR was as efficacious as CBT.

Children with PTSD are far more likely to pursue treatment at school (because of its proximity and ease) than at a free clinic.

==== Cognitive behavioral therapy ====

CBT seeks to change the way a person feels and acts by changing the patterns of thinking or behavior, or both, responsible for negative emotions. Results from a 2018 systematic review found high strength of evidence that supports CBT-exposure therapy efficacious for a reduction in PTSD and depression symptoms, as well as the loss of PTSD diagnosis. CBT has been proven to be an effective treatment for PTSD and is currently considered the standard of care for PTSD by the United States Department of Defense.

In CBT, individuals learn to identify thoughts that make them feel afraid or upset and replace them with less distressing thoughts. The goal is to understand how certain thoughts about events cause PTSD-related stress. A study assessing an online version of CBT for people with mild-to-moderate PTSD found that the online approach was as effective as, and cheaper than, the same therapy given face-to-face. A 2021 Cochrane review assessed the provision of CBT in an Internet-based format found similar beneficial effects for Internet-based therapy as in face-to-face. However, the quality of the evidence was low due to the small number of trials reviewed.

Exposure therapy is a type of cognitive behavioral therapy that involves assisting trauma survivors to re-experience distressing trauma-related memories and reminders in order to facilitate habituation and successful emotional processing of the trauma memory. Most exposure therapy programs include both imaginal confrontation with the traumatic memories and real-life exposure to trauma reminders; this type of CBT has shown benefit in the treatment of PTSD.

Some organizations have endorsed the need for exposure. The U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs has been actively training mental health treatment staff in prolonged exposure therapy and cognitive processing therapy in an effort to better treat U.S. veterans with PTSD.

Recent research on contextually based third-generation behavior therapies suggests that they may produce results comparable to some of the better validated therapies. Many of these therapy methods have a significant element of exposure and have demonstrated success in treating the primary problems of PTSD and co-occurring depressive symptoms.

==== Eye movement desensitization and reprocessing ====

Eye movement desensitization and reprocessing (EMDR) is a form of psychotherapy developed and studied by Francine Shapiro. She had noticed that, when she was thinking about disturbing memories herself, her eyes were moving rapidly. When she brought her eye movements under control while thinking, the thoughts were less distressing.

In 2002, Shapiro and Maxfield published a theory of why this might work, called adaptive information processing. This theory proposes that eye movement can be used to facilitate emotional processing of memories, changing the person&#x27;s memory to attend to more adaptive information. The therapist initiates voluntary rapid eye movements while the person focuses on memories, feelings or thoughts about a particular trauma. The therapist uses hand movements to get the person to move their eyes backward and forward, but hand-tapping or tones can also be used. EMDR closely resembles cognitive behavior therapy as it combines exposure (re-visiting the traumatic event), working on cognitive processes and relaxation/self-monitoring. However, exposure by way of being asked to think about the experience rather than talk about it has been highlighted as one of the more important distinguishing elements of EMDR.&lt;ref name=&quot;Jeffries/Davis&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

There have been several small, controlled trials of four to eight weeks of EMDR in adults as well as children and adolescents. There is moderate strength of evidence to support the efficacy of EMDR &quot;for reduction in PTSD symptoms, loss of diagnosis, and reduction in depressive symptoms&quot; according to a 2018 systematic review update. EMDR reduced PTSD symptoms enough in the short term that one in two adults no longer met the criteria for PTSD, but the number of people involved in these trials was small and thus results should be interpreted with caution pending further research. There was not enough evidence to know whether EMDR could eliminate PTSD in adults.

In children and adolescents, a recent meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials using MetaNSUE to avoid biases related to missing information found that EMDR was at least as efficacious as CBT, and superior to waitlist or placebo. There was some evidence that EMDR might prevent depression. There were no studies comparing EMDR to other psychological treatments or to medication. Adverse effects were largely unstudied. The benefits were greater for women with a history of sexual assault compared with people who had experienced other types of traumatizing events (such as accidents, physical assaults and war). There is a small amount of evidence that EMDR may improve re-experiencing symptoms in children and adolescents, but EMDR has not been shown to improve other PTSD symptoms, anxiety, or depression.

The eye movement component of the therapy may not be critical for benefit. As there has been no major, high quality randomized trial of EMDR with eye movements versus EMDR without eye movements, the controversy over effectiveness is likely to continue. Authors of a meta-analysis published in 2013 stated, &quot;We found that people treated with eye movement therapy had greater improvement in their symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder than people given therapy without eye movements... Secondly, we found that in laboratory studies the evidence concludes that thinking of upsetting memories and simultaneously doing a task that facilitates eye movements reduces the vividness and distress associated with the upsetting memories.&quot;

==== Interpersonal psychotherapy ====
Other approaches, in particular involving social supports, may also be important. An open trial of interpersonal psychotherapy reported high rates of remission from PTSD symptoms without using exposure.

=== Medication ===
While many medications do not have enough evidence to support their use, four (sertraline, fluoxetine, paroxetine, and venlafaxine) have been shown to have a small to modest benefit over placebo. With many medications, residual PTSD symptoms following treatment is the rule rather than the exception.

==== Antidepressants ====
Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and serotonin–norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) may have some benefit for PTSD symptoms. Tricyclic antidepressants are equally effective, but are less well tolerated. Evidence provides support for a small or modest improvement with sertraline, fluoxetine, paroxetine, and venlafaxine. Thus, these four medications are considered to be first-line medications for PTSD. The SSRIs paroxetine and sertraline are approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved for the treatment of PTSD.

==== Benzodiazepines ====
Benzodiazepines are not recommended for the treatment of PTSD due to a lack of evidence of benefit and risk of worsening PTSD symptoms. Some authors believe that the use of benzodiazepines is contraindicated for acute stress, as this group of drugs can cause dissociation. Nevertheless, some use benzodiazepines with caution for short-term anxiety and insomnia. While benzodiazepines can alleviate acute anxiety, there is no consistent evidence that they can stop the development of PTSD and may actually increase the risk of developing PTSD 2–5 times. Benzodiazepines should not be used in the immediate aftermath of a traumatic event as they may increase symptoms related to PTSD.

Benzodiazepines may reduce the effectiveness of psychotherapeutic interventions, and there is some evidence that benzodiazepines may actually contribute to the development and chronification of PTSD. For those who already have PTSD, benzodiazepines may worsen and prolong the course of illness, by worsening psychotherapy outcomes, and causing or exacerbating aggression, depression (including suicidality), and substance use. Drawbacks include the risk of developing a benzodiazepine dependence, tolerance (i.e., short-term benefits wearing off with time), and withdrawal syndrome; additionally, individuals with PTSD (even those without a history of alcohol or drug misuse) are at an increased risk of abusing benzodiazepines.

Due to a number of other treatments with greater efficacy for PTSD and fewer risks, benzodiazepines should be considered relatively contraindicated until all other treatment options are exhausted.

Benzodiazepines also carry a risk of disinhibition (associated with suicidality, aggression and crimes) and their use may delay or inhibit more definitive treatments for PTSD.&lt;ref name=&quot;VA/DoD_2010&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Prazosin ====
Prazosin, an alpha-1 adrenergic antagonist, has been used in veterans with PTSD to reduce nightmares. Studies show variability in the symptom improvement, appropriate dosages, and efficacy in this population.

==== Glucocorticoids ====
Glucocorticoids may be useful for short-term therapy to protect against neurodegeneration caused by the extended stress response that characterizes PTSD, but long-term use may actually promote neurodegeneration.

==== Cannabinoids ====

Cannabis is not recommended as a treatment for PTSD because scientific evidence does not currently exist demonstrating treatment efficacy for cannabinoids. However, use of cannabis or derived products is widespread among U.S. veterans with PTSD.

The cannabinoid nabilone is sometimes used for nightmares in PTSD. Although some short-term benefit was shown, adverse effects are common and it has not been adequately studied to determine efficacy. An increasing number of states permit and have legalized the use of medical cannabis for the treatment of PTSD.

=== Other ===

==== Exercise, sport and physical activity ====
Physical activity can influence people&#x27;s psychological and physical health. The U.S. National Center for PTSD recommends moderate exercise as a way to distract from disturbing emotions, build self-esteem and increase feelings of being in control again. They recommend a discussion with a doctor before starting an exercise program.

==== Play therapy for children ====
Play is thought to help children link their inner thoughts with their outer world, connecting real experiences with abstract thought. Repetitive play can also be one way a child relives traumatic events, and that can be a symptom of trauma in a child or young person. Although it is commonly used, there have not been enough studies comparing outcomes in groups of children receiving and not receiving play therapy, so the effects of play therapy are not yet understood.

==== Military programs ====
Many veterans of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan have faced significant physical, emotional, and relational disruptions. In response, the United States Marine Corps has instituted programs to assist them in re-adjusting to civilian life, especially in their relationships with spouses and loved ones, to help them communicate better and understand what the other has gone through. Walter Reed Army Institute of Research (WRAIR) developed the Battlemind program to assist service members avoid or ameliorate PTSD and related problems. Wounded Warrior Project partnered with the US Department of Veterans Affairs to create Warrior Care Network, a national health system of PTSD treatment centers.

==== Nightmares ====
In 2020, the United States Food and Drug Administration granted marketing approval for an Apple Watch app call NightWare. The app aims to improve sleep for people suffering from PTSD-related nightmares, by vibrating when it detects a nightmare in progress based on monitoring heart rate and body movement.

==== The &quot;colour cure&quot; ====
Toward the end of the First World War art connoisseur Howard Kemp Prossor came up with what he called the &quot;colour cure&quot; – the use of specific colours to ease the suffering of people with shell shock.

== Epidemiology ==

There is debate over the rates of PTSD found in populations, but, despite changes in diagnosis and the criteria used to define PTSD between 1997 and 2013, epidemiological rates have not changed significantly. Most of the current reliable data regarding the epidemiology of PTSD is based on DSM-IV criteria, as the DSM-5 was not introduced until 2013.

The United Nations&#x27; World Health Organization publishes estimates of PTSD impact for each of its member states; the latest data available are for 2004. Considering only the 25 most populated countries ranked by overall age-standardized Disability-Adjusted Life Year (DALY) rate, the top half of the ranked list is dominated by Asian/Pacific countries, the US, and Egypt. Ranking the countries by the male-only or female-only rates produces much the same result, but with less meaningfulness, as the score range in the single-sex rankings is much-reduced (4 for women, 3 for men, as compared with 14 for the overall score range), suggesting that the differences between female and male rates, within each country, is what drives the distinctions between the countries.

As of 2017, the cross-national lifetime prevalence of PTSD was 3.9%, based on a survey where 5.6% had been exposed to trauma. The primary factor impacting treatment-seeking behavior, which can help to mitigate PTSD development after trauma was income, while being younger, female, and having less social status (less education, lower individual income, and being unemployed) were all factors associated with less treatment-seeking behavior.

=== United States ===
PTSD affects about 5% of the US adult population each year. 
The National Comorbidity Survey Replication has estimated that the lifetime prevalence of PTSD among adult Americans is 6.8%, with women (9.7%) more than twice as likely as men (3.6%) to have PTSD at some point in their lives. More than 60% of men and more than 60% of women experience at least one traumatic event in their life. The most frequently reported traumatic events by men are rape, combat, and childhood neglect or physical abuse. Women most frequently report instances of rape, sexual molestation, physical attack, being threatened with a weapon and childhood physical abuse. 88% of men and 79% of women with lifetime PTSD have at least one comorbid psychiatric disorder. Major depressive disorder, 48% of men and 49% of women, and lifetime alcohol use disorder or dependence, 51.9% of men and 27.9% of women, are the most common comorbid disorders.

==== Military combat ====
The United States Department of Veterans Affairs estimates that 830,000 Vietnam War veterans had symptoms of PTSD. The &quot;National Vietnam Veterans&#x27; Readjustment Study&quot; (NVVRS) found 15% of male and 9% of female Vietnam veterans had PTSD at the time of the study. Life-time prevalence of PTSD was 31% for males and 27% for females. In a reanalysis of the NVVRS data, along with analysis of the data from the Matsunaga Vietnam Veterans Project, Schnurr, Lunney, Sengupta, and Waelde found that, contrary to the initial analysis of the NVVRS data, a large majority of Vietnam veterans had PTSD symptoms (but not the disorder itself). Four out of five reported recent symptoms when interviewed 20–25 years after Vietnam.

A 2011 study from Georgia State University and San Diego State University found that rates of PTSD diagnosis increased significantly when troops were stationed in combat zones, had tours of longer than a year, experienced combat, or were injured. Military personnel serving in combat zones were 12.1 percentage points more likely to receive a PTSD diagnosis than their active-duty counterparts in non-combat zones. Those serving more than 12 months in a combat zone were 14.3 percentage points more likely to be diagnosed with PTSD than those having served less than one year.

Experiencing an enemy firefight was associated with an 18.3 percentage point increase in the probability of PTSD, while being wounded or injured in combat was associated with a 23.9 percentage point increase in the likelihood of a PTSD diagnosis. For the 2.16 million U.S. troops deployed in combat zones between 2001 and 2010, the total estimated two-year costs of treatment for combat-related PTSD are between $1.54 billion and $2.69 billion.

As of 2013, rates of PTSD have been estimated at up to 20% for veterans returning from Iraq and Afghanistan. As of 2013 13% of veterans returning from Iraq were unemployed.

==== Human-made disasters ====
The September 11 attacks took the lives of nearly 3,000 people, leaving 6,000 injured. First responders (police, firefighters, and emergency medical technicians), sanitation workers, and volunteers were all involved in the recovery efforts. The prevalence of probable PTSD in these highly exposed populations was estimated across several studies using in-person, telephone, and online interviews and questionnaires. Overall prevalence of PTSD was highest immediately following the attacks and decreased over time. However, disparities were found among the different types of recovery workers. The rate of probable PTSD for first responders was lowest directly after the attacks and increased from ranges of 4.8–7.8% to 7.4–16.5% between the 5–6 year follow-up and a later assessment.

When comparing traditional responders to non-traditional responders (volunteers), the probable PTSD prevalence 2.5 years after the initial visit was greater in volunteers with estimates of 11.7% and 17.2% respectively. Volunteer participation in tasks atypical to the defined occupational role was a significant risk factor for PTSD. Other risk factors included exposure intensity, earlier start date, duration of time spent on site, and constant, negative reminders of the trauma.

Additional research has been performed to understand the social consequences of the September 11 attacks. Alcohol consumption was assessed in a cohort of World Trade Center workers using the cut-annoyed-guilty-eye (CAGE) questionnaire for alcohol use disorder. Almost 50% of World Trade Center workers who self-identified as alcohol users reported drinking more during the rescue efforts. Nearly a quarter of these individuals reported drinking more following the recovery. If determined to have probable PTSD status, the risk of developing an alcohol problem was double compared to those without psychological morbidity. Social disability was also studied in this cohort as a social consequence of the September 11 attacks. Defined by the disruption of family, work, and social life, the risk of developing social disability increased 17-fold when categorized as having probable PTSD.

== Anthropology ==

Cultural and medical anthropologists have questioned the validity of applying the diagnostic criteria of PTSD cross-culturally.

Trauma (and resulting PTSD) is often experienced through the outermost limits of suffering, pain and fear. The images and experiences relived through PTSD often defy easy description through language. Therefore, the translation of these experiences from one language to another is problematic, and the primarily Euro-American research on trauma is necessarily limited. The Sapir-Whorf hypothesis suggests that people perceive the world differently according to the language they speak: language and the world it exists within reflect back on the perceptions of the speaker.

For example, ethnopsychology studies in Nepal have found that cultural idioms and concepts related to trauma often do not translate to western terminologies: &quot;piDaa&quot; is a term that may align to trauma/suffering, but also people who suffer from &quot;piDaa&quot; are considered &quot;paagal&quot; (mad) and are subject to negative social stigma, indicating the need for culturally appropriate and carefully tailored support interventions. More generally, different cultures remember traumatic experiences within different linguistic and cultural paradigms. As such, cultural and medical anthropologists have questioned the validity of applying the diagnostic criteria of PTSD cross-culturally, as defined in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-III), and constructed through the Euro-American paradigm of psychology.

There remains a dearth of studies into the conceptual frameworks that surround trauma in non-Western cultures. There is little evidence to suggest therapeutic benefit in synthesizing local idioms of distress into a culturally constructed disorder of the post-Vietnam era, a practice anthropologist believe contributes to category fallacy. For many cultures there is no single linguistic corollary to PTSD, psychological trauma being a multi-faceted concept with corresponding variances of expression.

Designating the effects of trauma as an affliction of the spirit is common in many non-Western cultures where idioms such as &quot;soul loss&quot; and &quot;weak heart&quot; indicate a preference to confer suffering to a spirit-body or heart-body diametric. These idioms reflect the emphasis that collectivist cultures place on healing trauma through familial, cultural and religious activities while avoiding the stigma that accompanies a mind-body approach. Prescribing PTSD diagnostics within these communities is ineffective and often detrimental. For trauma that extends beyond the individual, such as the effects of war, anthropologists believe applying the term &quot;social suffering&quot; or &quot;cultural bereavement&quot; to be more beneficial.

Every facet of society is affected by conflict; the prolonged exposure to mass violence can lead to a &#x27;continuous suffering&#x27; among civilians, soldiers, and bordering countries. Entered into the DSM in 1980, clinicians and psychiatrists based the diagnostic criteria for PTSD around American veterans of the Vietnam War. Though the DSM gets reviewed and updated regularly, it is unable to fully encompass the disorder due to its Americanization (or Westernization). That is, what may be considered characteristics of PTSD in western society, may not directly translate across to other cultures around the world. Displaced people of the African country Burundi experienced symptoms of depression and anxiety, though few symptoms specific to PTSD were noted.

In a similar review, Sudanese refugees relocated in Uganda were &#x27;concerned with material [effects]&#x27; (lack of food, shelter, and healthcare), rather than psychological distress. In this case, many refugees did not present symptoms at all, with a minor few developing anxiety and depression. War-related stresses and traumas will be ingrained in the individual, however they will be affected differently from culture to culture, and the &quot;clear-cut&quot; rubric for diagnosing PTSD does not allow for culturally contextual reactions to take place.

== Veterans ==
=== United States ===
The United States provides a range of benefits for veterans that the VA has determined have PTSD, which developed during, or as a result of, their military service. These benefits may include tax-free cash payments, free or low-cost mental health treatment and other healthcare, vocational rehabilitation services, employment assistance, and independent living support.

=== United Kingdom ===
In the UK, there are various charities and service organisations dedicated to aiding veterans in readjusting to civilian life. The Royal British Legion and the more recently established Help for Heroes are two of Britain&#x27;s more high-profile veterans&#x27; organisations which have actively advocated for veterans over the years. There has been some controversy that the NHS has not done enough in tackling mental health issues and is instead &quot;dumping&quot; veterans on charities such as Combat Stress.

=== Canada ===
Veterans Affairs Canada provides assistance to disabled veterans that includes rehabilitation, financial aid, job placement, healthcare, disability compensation, peer support, and family support.

== History ==

Aspects of PTSD in soldiers of ancient Assyria have been identified using written sources from 1300 to 600 BCE. These Assyrian soldiers would undergo a three-year rotation of combat before being allowed to return home, and were reported to have faced immense challenges in reconciling their past actions in war with their civilian lives.

Connections between the actions of Viking berserkers and the hyperarousal of post-traumatic stress disorder have also been drawn.

Psychiatrist Jonathan Shay has proposed that Lady Percy&#x27;s soliloquy in the William Shakespeare play &quot;Henry IV, Part 1&quot; (act 2, scene 3, lines 40–62), written around 1597, represents an unusually accurate description of the symptom constellation of PTSD.

Many historical wartime diagnoses such as railway spine, stress syndrome, nostalgia, soldier&#x27;s heart, shell shock, battle fatigue, combat stress reaction, and traumatic war neurosis are now associated with PTSD.

The correlations between combat and PTSD are undeniable; according to Stéphane Audoin-Rouzeau and Annette Becker, &quot;One-tenth of mobilized American men were hospitalized for mental disturbances between 1942 and 1945, and, after thirty-five days of uninterrupted combat, 98% of them manifested psychiatric disturbances in varying degrees.&quot;

The DSM-I (1952) includes a diagnosis of &quot;gross stress reaction&quot;, which has similarities to the modern definition and understanding of PTSD. Gross stress reaction is defined as a normal personality using established patterns of reaction to deal with overwhelming fear as a response to conditions of great stress. The diagnosis includes language which relates the condition to combat as well as to &quot;civilian catastrophe&quot;.

The addition of the term to the DSM-III was greatly influenced by the experiences and conditions of U.S. military veterans of the Vietnam War. In fact, much of the available published research regarding PTSD is based on studies done on veterans of the war in Vietnam.

Because of the initial overt focus on PTSD as a combat related disorder when it was first fleshed out in the years following the war in Vietnam, in 1975 Ann Wolbert Burgess and Lynda Lytle Holmstrom defined rape trauma syndrome (RTS) in order to draw attention to the striking similarities between the experiences of soldiers returning from war and of rape victims. This paved the way for a more comprehensive understanding of causes of PTSD.

Early in 1978, the diagnosis term &quot;post-traumatic stress disorder&quot; was first recommended in a working group finding presented to the Committee of Reactive Disorders.

A USAF study carried out in 1979 focused on individuals (civilian and military) who had worked to recover or identify the remains of those who died in Jonestown. The bodies had been dead for several days, and a third of them had been children. The study used the term &quot;dysphoria&quot; to describe PTSD-like symptoms.

After PTSD became an official American psychiatric diagnosis with the publication of DSM-III (1980), the number of personal injury lawsuits (tort claims) asserting the plaintiff had PTSD increased rapidly. However, triers of fact (judges and juries) often regarded the PTSD diagnostic criteria as imprecise, a view shared by legal scholars, trauma specialists, forensic psychologists, and forensic psychiatrists. The condition was termed &quot;posttraumatic stress disorder&quot; in the DSM-III (1980).

Professional discussions and debates in academic journals, at conferences, and between thought leaders, led to a more clearly-defined set of diagnostic criteria in DSM-IV (1994), particularly the definition of a &quot;traumatic event&quot;. The DSM-IV classified PTSD under anxiety disorders. In the ICD-10 (first used in 1994), the spelling of the condition was &quot;post-traumatic stress disorder&quot;.

In 2012, the researchers from the Grady Trauma Project highlighted the tendency people have to focus on the combat side of PTSD: &quot;less public awareness has focused on civilian PTSD, which results from trauma exposure that is not combat related...&quot; and &quot;much of the research on civilian PTSD has focused on the sequelae of a single, disastrous event, such as the Oklahoma City bombing, September 11th attacks, and Hurricane Katrina&quot;. Disparity in the focus of PTSD research affected the already popular perception of the exclusive interconnectedness of combat and PTSD. This is misleading when it comes to understanding the implications and extent of PTSD as a neurological disorder.

The DSM-5 (2013) created a new category called &quot;trauma and stressor-related disorders&quot;, in which PTSD is now classified.

America&#x27;s 2014 National Comorbidity Survey reports that &quot;the traumas most commonly associated with PTSD are combat exposure and witnessing among men and rape and sexual molestation among women.&quot;

== Terminology ==

The &quot;Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders&quot; does not hyphenate &quot;post&quot; and &quot;traumatic&quot;, thus, the DSM-5 lists the disorder as &quot;posttraumatic stress disorder&quot;. However, many scientific journal articles and other scholarly publications do hyphenate the name of the disorder, &quot;viz.&quot;, &quot;post-traumatic stress disorder&quot;. Dictionaries also differ with regard to the preferred spelling of the disorder with the &quot;Collins English Dictionary – Complete and Unabridged&quot; using the hyphenated spelling, and the &quot;American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language, Fifth Edition&quot; and the &quot;Random House Kernerman Webster&#x27;s College Dictionary&quot; giving the non-hyphenated spelling.

Some authors have used the terms &quot;post-traumatic stress syndrome&quot; or &quot;post-traumatic stress symptoms&quot; (&quot;PTSS&quot;), or simply &quot;post-traumatic stress&quot; (&quot;PTS&quot;) in the case of the U.S. Department of Defense, to avoid stigma associated with the word &quot;disorder&quot;.

The comedian George Carlin criticized the euphemism treadmill which led to progressive change of the way PTSD was referred to over the course of the 20th century, from &quot;shell shock&quot; in the First World War to the &quot;battle fatigue&quot; in the Second World War, to &quot;operational exhaustion&quot; in the Korean War, to the current &quot;post-traumatic stress disorder&quot;, coined during the Vietnam War, which &quot;added a hyphen&quot; and which, he commented, &quot;completely burie[s] [the pain] under jargon&quot;. He also stated that the name given to the condition has had a direct effect on the way veteran soldiers with PTSD were treated and perceived by civilian populations over time.

== Research ==
Most knowledge regarding PTSD comes from studies in high-income countries.

To recapitulate some of the neurological and neurobehavioral symptoms experienced by the veteran population of recent conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan, researchers at the Roskamp Institute and the James A Haley Veteran&#x27;s Hospital (Tampa) have developed an animal model to study the consequences of mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) and PTSD. In the laboratory, the researchers exposed mice to a repeated session of unpredictable stressor (i.e. predator odor while restrained), and physical trauma in the form of inescapable foot-shock, and this was also combined with a mTBI. In this study, PTSD animals demonstrated recall of traumatic memories, anxiety, and an impaired social behavior, while animals subject to both mTBI and PTSD had a pattern of disinhibitory-like behavior. mTBI abrogated both contextual fear and impairments in social behavior seen in PTSD animals. In comparison with other animal studies, examination of neuroendocrine and neuroimmune responses in plasma revealed a trend toward increase in corticosterone in PTSD and combination groups.

Stellate ganglion block is an experimental procedure for the treatment of PTSD.

Researchers are investigating a number of experimental FAAH and MAGL-inhibiting drugs in hopes of finding a better treatment for anxiety and stress-related illnesses. In 2016, the FAAH-inhibitor drug BIA 10-2474 was withdrawn from human trials in France due to adverse effects.

Evidence from clinical trials suggests that MDMA-assisted psychotherapy is an effective treatment for PTSD. On August 9, 2024, the FDA issued a letter stating that a further trial was necessary to ascertain that the benefits of MDMA-assisted psychotherapy outweighed the potential harms. Positive findings in clinical trials of MDMA-assisted psychotherapy might be substantially influenced by expectancy effects given the unblinding of participants. To prevent this confounding factor, it has been suggested that future trials compare MDMA against an active placebo. There is a lack of trials comparing MDMA-assisted psychotherapy to existent first-line treatments for PTSD, such as trauma-focused psychological treatments, which seems to achieve similar or even better outcomes than MDMA-assisted psychotherapy.

=== Psychotherapy ===
Trauma-focused psychotherapies for PTSD (also known as &quot;exposure-based&quot; or &quot;exposure&quot; psychotherapies), such as prolonged exposure therapy (PE), eye movement desensitization and reprocessing (EMDR), and cognitive-reprocessing therapy (CPT) have the most evidence for efficacy and are recommended as first-line treatment for PTSD by almost all clinical practice guidelines. Exposure-based psychotherapies demonstrate efficacy for PTSD caused by different trauma &quot;types&quot;, such as combat, sexual-assault, or natural disasters. At the same time, many trauma-focused psychotherapies evince high drop-out rates.

Most systematic reviews and clinical guidelines indicate that psychotherapies for PTSD, most of which are trauma-focused therapies, are more effective than pharmacotherapy (medication), although there are reviews that suggest exposure-based psychotherapies for PTSD and pharmacotherapy are equally effective. Interpersonal psychotherapy shows preliminary evidence of probable efficacy, but more research is needed to reach definitive conclusions.

<text>Porus or Poros ( ; 326–321 BC) was an ancient Indian king whose territory spanned the region between the Jhelum River (Hydaspes) and Chenab River (Acesines), in the Punjab region of what is now India and Pakistan. He is only mentioned in Greek sources.
Said to be a warrior with exceptional skills, Porus unsuccessfully fought against Alexander the Great in the Battle of the Hydaspes (326 BC). In the aftermath, an impressed Alexander not only reinstated him as his satrap but also granted him dominion over lands to the south-east extending as far as the Hyphasis (Beas). Porus reportedly died sometime between 321 and 315 BC.

==Sources==
The only contemporary information available on Porus and his kingdom is from Greek sources, whereas Indian sources do not mention him. These Greek sources differ considerably among themselves.

== Identification ==

=== Purus ===
Michael Witzel conjectures that Porus was a king of the Pūrus, a Vedic tribe, who existed as a marginal power in Punjab after their defeat in the Battle of the Ten Kings. Hem Chandra Raychaudhuri largely agreed with this identification.

=== Sourasenis ===
Quintus Curtius Rufus mentions Porus&#x27; vanguard soldiers carrying a banner of &quot;Herakles&quot; during the face-off with Alexander. Accordingly, Ishwari Prasad and a few other scholars argue that Porus was a Shurasena. This identification is based on the fact that multiple Greek histories — Indica by Arrian, Geographica by Strabo, and Bibliotheca historica by Diodorus Siculus — note Megasthenes to have described an Indian tribe called &quot;Sourasenoi&quot; who worshiped one &quot;Herakles&quot; and originated from the lands of Mathura and Yamuna.

== Rule ==

=== Background ===
Porus ruled over the tracts between the rivers Hydaspes (Jhelum) and Acesines (Chenab); Strabo noted the territory to contain almost 300 cities. He had a hostile relationship with the neighboring polity of Taxila, having assassinated their erstwhile ruler Ambhiraj, his maternal uncle.

When Alexander crossed the Indus in their eastward migration, probably in Udabhandapura, he was greeted by the then-ruler of Taxila, Omphis, son of Ambhiraj. Years ago, he had visited Alexander in Sogdiana and was treated as an ally; Omphis&#x27; rule was confirmed and gifts lavished, but a Macedonian satrap was installed. Omphis hoped to force both Porus and Abisares into submission, leveraging the might of Alexander&#x27;s forces, and dispatched diplomatic missions to this effect.

In response, Abisares offered submission but Porus refused, leading Alexander to seek a face-off on the bank of Jhelum. Thus began the Battle of the Hydaspes in 326 BC; the exact site remains unknown and the exact strength of the armies cannot be determined either, due to major discrepancies between sources.

=== Battle of the Hydaspes ===
Alexander re-used the same vessels which were used for crossing the Indus, the first time, some 300 km away at Udabhandapura. His forces frequently mounted intrusion-attempts and even before the battle had started, skirmishes were reported in the riverine islands.

A few months later, Alexander decided to accompany a strike force across the densely forested headlands and besiege Porus&#x27; defense; the base camp with substantial cavalry and infantry units was left under Craterus, who was advised to follow Alexander upon a successful passage whilst the remaining forces were distributed along the river under three phalanx officers to distract Porus&#x27; forces. The strategy was successful and they crossed the Jhelum unobstructed, on a stormy night, just before dawn. A band of horsemen on chariots led by Porus&#x27; son did detect the intrusion and mount a charge but was repelled by Alexander&#x27;s superior cavalry.

Informed of Alexander&#x27;s passage, Porus became concerned with tackling those who had already crossed, rather than preventing passage of the remaining majority. He took a defensive position in the plains, interspersing infantry units with elephants on the front lines and stationing the cavalry and chariots in the wings. Alexander chose to shield his infantry and instead led a devastating cavalry charge on Porus&#x27; left wing, forcing reinforcements from the right; however, this rear-transit came under attack by Coenus&#x27; cavalry and Porus&#x27; cavalry was compelled to take refuge within the infantry frontlines, causing confusion.

This led to an all-out attack from both sides, but Porus&#x27; plans proved futile. According to Heckle (2014), Porus is believed to have had around 30,000 infantry. However, Porus only had 4,000 mounted troops. Not only were Porus&#x27; cavalry charges repelled but the &quot;mahouts&quot; were killed using &quot;sarissas&quot; and the elephants were pushed back into Porus&#x27; columns, wreaking havoc on the rear, Alexander&#x27;s cavalry kept charging and inflicting disorder. Soon Porus&#x27; army was surrounded on all sides, and became easy fodder for Alexander&#x27;s forces with the cavalry exterminated and most of the elephants captured. Still, Porus refused to surrender and wandered about atop an elephant, until he was wounded and his force routed. A fraction of the infantry successfully escaped and probably planned to regroup but Craterus pursued them to their deaths.

==== Result ====

The battle resulted in a decisive Greek victory; however, A. B. Bosworth warns against an uncritical reading of Greek sources, who obviously exaggerated. Alexander held athletic and gymnastic games at the site, and even commissioned two cities in commemoration: Nicaea at the site of his victory and &quot;Bucephalous&quot; at the battle-ground, in memory of his horse. Later, decadrachms were minted by the Babylonian mint depicting Alexander on horseback, armed with a &quot;sarissa&quot; and attacking a pair of Indian soilders atop an elephant.

===Aftermath===

Despite the apparently one-sided results, Alexander was impressed by Porus and chose not to depose him. His territory was not only restored, but also expanded, with Alexander&#x27;s forces annexing the territories of Glausaes, who ruled to the northeast of Porus&#x27; kingdom. Further, Omphis was reconciled with Porus.

A joint expedition was then mounted against a territory east of the Chenab, ruled by an enemy cousin of Porus; he had earlier submitted to Alexander but, suspicious of Porus&#x27; rise in rank, chose to flee with his army. The date of this battle remains disputed; Alexander&#x27;s forces overran his lands before meeting stiff resistance at a walled Sangala on the other side of the Ravi. Siege warfare was executed to brilliant effect and the full-fledged attack began once Porus had joined with his elephants. As Sangala and allied cities were razed, Porus was allowed to station his garrisons.

Thereafter, Alexander proceeded unopposed to the Beas and even intended to cross it towards the Gangetic Plain; however, the monsoon was at its peak and his weary troops remained stubborn despite his cajoling and threats. A reluctant Alexander had to renounce his plans and turn back. Porus was thus ratified as the &quot;de facto&quot; ruler of the entire territory east of the Jhelum, with no European &quot;satrap&quot; to co-rule with, unlike Ambhi and Abisares. The crossing-back of the Jhelum was a prolonged affair; filled with festivities, it attracted thousands.

===Death===

After the death of Alexander the Great in 323 BC, Perdiccas became the regent of his empire, and after Perdiccas&#x27; murder in 321 BC, Antipater became the new regent. According to Diodorus, Antipater recognized Porus&#x27; authority over the territories along the Indus River. However, Eudemus, who had served as Alexander&#x27;s satrap in the Punjab region, killed Porus.

<doc id="82976" wikidata="Q9141" url="?curid=82976" title="Taj Mahal">
<text>The Taj Mahal ( ; ; ) is an ivory-white marble mausoleum on the right bank of the river Yamuna in Agra, Uttar Pradesh, India. It was commissioned in 1631 by the fifth Mughal emperor, Shah Jahan () to house the tomb of his beloved wife, Mumtaz Mahal; it also houses the tomb of Shah Jahan himself. The tomb is the centrepiece of a complex, which includes a mosque and a guest house, and is set in formal gardens bounded on three sides by a crenellated wall.

Construction of the mausoleum was completed in 1648, but work continued on other phases of the project for another five years. The first ceremony held at the mausoleum was an observance by Shah Jahan, on 6 February 1643, of the 12th anniversary of the death of Mumtaz Mahal. The Taj Mahal complex is believed to have been completed in its entirety in 1653 at a cost estimated at the time to be around 32 million, which in 2015 would be approximately 52.8 billion (827 million).

The building complex incorporates the design traditions of Indo-Islamic and Mughal architecture. It employs symmetrical constructions with the usage of various shapes and symbols. While the mausoleum is constructed of white marble inlaid with semi-precious stones, red sandstone was used for other buildings in the complex similar to the Mughal era buildings of the time. The construction project employed more than 20,000 workers and artisans under the guidance of a board of architects led by Ustad Ahmad Lahori, the emperor&#x27;s court architect.

The Taj Mahal was designated as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1983 for being &quot;the jewel of Islamic art in India and one of the universally admired masterpieces of the world&#x27;s heritage&quot;. It is regarded as one of the best examples of Mughal architecture and a symbol of Indian history. The Taj Mahal is a major tourist attraction and attracts more than five million visitors a year. In 2007, it was declared a winner of the New 7 Wonders of the World initiative.

== Etymology ==
The name &quot;Taj Mahal&quot; is of Urdu origin, and believed to be derived from Arabic and Persian, with the words &quot;tāj mahall&quot; meaning &quot;crown&quot; (&quot;tāj&quot;) &quot;palace&quot; (&quot;mahall&quot;). Abdul Hamid Lahori, in his book from 1636 &quot;Padshahnama&quot;, refers to the Taj Mahal as &quot;rauza-i munawwara&quot; (Perso-Arabic: , &quot;rawdah-i munawwarah&quot;), meaning the illumined or illustrious tomb. The name &quot;Taj&quot; might have been derived from the corruption of the second syllable of &quot;Mumtaz&quot;.

== Inspiration ==
The Taj Mahal was commissioned by Shah Jahan in 1631, to be built in the memory of his wife Mumtaz Mahal, who died on 17 June that year while giving birth to their 14th child, Gauhara Begum. Construction started in 1632, and the mausoleum was completed in 1648, while the surrounding buildings and garden were finished five years later.

The imperial court documenting Shah Jahan&#x27;s grief after the death of Mumtaz Mahal illustrates the love story held as the inspiration for the Taj Mahal. According to contemporary historians Muhammad Amin Qazvini, Abdul Hamid Lahori and Muhammad Saleh Kamboh, Shah Jahan did not show the same level of affection for others as he had shown Mumtaz while she was alive. After her death, he avoided royal affairs for a week due to his grief and gave up listening to music and lavish dressing for two years. Shah Jahan was enamoured by the beauty of the land at the south side of Agra on which a mansion belonging to Raja Jai Singh I stood. He chose the place for the construction of Mumtaz&#x27;s tomb after which Jai Singh agreed to give it to emperor Shah Jahan in exchange for a large palace in the centre of Agra.

== Architecture and design ==

The Taj Mahal incorporates and expands on design traditions of Indo-Islamic and Mughal architecture. Inspirations for the building came from Timurid and Mughal buildings including the Gur-e Amir in Samarkand (the tomb of Timur, progenitor of the Mughal dynasty) and Humayun&#x27;s Tomb in Delhi which inspired the Charbagh gardens and hasht-behesht plan of the site. The building complex employs symmetrical constructions with the usage of various shapes and symbols. While the mausoleum is constructed of white marble inlaid with semi-precious stones, red sandstone was used for other buildings in the complex similar to the Mughal era buildings of the time. The entire complex sits on platform measuring in length and in height on the banks of Yamuna river. The platform is built with varying patterns of dark and light colored sandstone.

=== Exterior ===

The mausoleum building is the central structure of the entire complex. It is a white marble structure standing on a high square plinth with sides measuring in length. The base structure is a large multi-chambered cube with chamfered corners forming an eight-sided structure that is approximately long on each of the four long sides.

The building has four identical sides with &quot;iwans&quot; (arch-shaped doorways), topped by a large dome and finial. Each side of the iwan is framed with a high &quot;pishtaq&quot; (vaulted archway) with two similarly shaped arched balconies stacked on either side. This motif of archways is replicated on a smaller scale on the chamfered corner areas, making the design completely symmetrical. At the southern side of the platform, facing the garden, there are two flights of stairs on either side which are partly covered and provide the only access from ground level up to the mausoleum building.

The predominant feature of the mausoleum is the high marble dome that surmounts the tomb. The onion shaped dome sits on a high cylindrical drum with an inner diameter of . The dome is slightly asymmetrical and is topped by a high gilded finial. The intermediate zone between the drum and the dome is supplanted by an ornamental moulding with a twisted rope design.

The main dome is surrounded by four smaller domes or &quot;chattris&quot; placed at its corners, which replicate the onion shape of the main dome. The smaller domes are supported by columns which stand on the top of the main structure and help bring light to the interior of the building. Tall spires called &quot;guldastas&quot; extend from edges of walls which serve as decorative elements. The main and the smaller domes are decorated with a design resembling a lotus flower. The domes are topped by decorative finials which uses Persian and Indian design elements. The main finial was originally made of gold but was replaced by a copy made of gilded bronze in the early 19th century. The finial is topped by a moon, a typical Islamic motif, whose horns point heavenward.

Four minarets flank the tomb building, one at each corner of the plinth facing the chamfered corners. The four minarets, which are each more than tall, are symmetrically arranged on the corners facing the chamfered corners of the main building. Each minaret is composed of three almost equal parts with balconies at the intersection of the portions. The towers are also surmounted by smaller chattris and incorporate the same design elements as the main dome with a finial. Steps lead to the top of the tower with rectangular openings below the domes providing light and air on the top. The minarets were designed similar to traditional elements of a mosque, which are used by the muezzin to call for prayer. The minarets were constructed slightly oriented towards the outside of the plinth so that in the event of collapse, the material from the towers would tend to fall away from the tomb.

The external surfaces of the building are decorated with a number of delicate relief art adorned with various precious and semi-previous stones. The decorative elements were created by applying paint, stucco, stone inlays or carvings. In line with the Islamic prohibition against the use of anthropomorphic forms, the decorative elements can be grouped into either calligraphy, abstract forms or vegetative motifs. The white marble dados consist of ornamental bas relief depictions of nature and plant based elements. The marble has been polished to emphasise the exquisite detailing of the carvings and the frames and archway spandrels are decorated with pietra dura inlays of stylised geometric pattern of vines, flowers and fruits.

The domes and vaults of the sandstone buildings are worked with tracery of incised painting to create elaborate geometric forms. Herringbone inlays define the space between the adjoining elements. White inlays are used in sandstone buildings, and dark or black inlays on the white marbles. Contrasting colors have been used to create a complex array of different geometric patterns across the mortared areas of the buildings. The floors and walkways are laid with tiles or blocks with contrasting colors and consisting of various tessellation patterns. The plinth is differentiated from the paved surface of the main platform by an interlocking pattern of octagonal white marble pieces set into four pointed stars made of red sandstone, surrounded by a border. The building has many lattice windows or &quot;jalis&quot; with interlocking hexagonal patterns.

The gateway arches are bordered by Arabic calligraphy with passages from the Qur&#x27;an. Much of the calligraphy is composed of florid thuluth script made of jasper or black marble inlaid in white marble panels. Higher panels are written with slightly larger script to reduce the skewing effect when viewed from below. The calligraphy on the southern gate roughly translates to &quot;O Soul, thou art at rest. Return to the Lord at peace with Him, and He at peace with you.&quot; The calligraphy on the buildings were believed to have been created in 1609 by Abdul Haq, who was conferred the title of &quot;Amanat Khan&quot; by Shah Jahan. At the base of the interior dome is the inscription, &quot;Written by the insignificant being, Amanat Khan Shirazi&quot;.

=== Interior ===
The main inner chamber is an octagon with sides, with the design allowing for entry from each face with the main door facing the garden to the south. Two tiers of eight &quot;pishtaq&quot; arches are located along the walls, similar to the exterior. The four central upper arches form balconies or viewing areas, and each balcony&#x27;s exterior window has an intricate &quot;jali&quot;. The inner wall is open along the axes where &quot;jali&quot; screens are fitted which transmit light from the exterior to the interior of the main chamber. Except the south side, other three sides consist of an open elongated room flanked by two square cells covered with decorated ceilings set on the platform. The central room has arched openings on three sides fitted with &quot;jalis&quot; filled with panes of glass and a small rectangular window cut into the central &quot;jali&quot;. The square cells which are reached through separate doors were probably originally used for visitors and Qur&#x27;an reciters as a place to rest. Staircases lead from the ground floor to the roof level, where there are corridors between the central hall and the two corner rooms in the south with a system of ventilation shafts.

The interior walls are about high and are topped by a &quot;false&quot; interior dome decorated with a sun motif. The inlay work is a lapidary of precious and semiprecious gemstones. Each chamber wall is highly decorated with dado bas-relief, intricate lapidary inlay and refined calligraphy panels similar to the design elements seen throughout the exterior of the complex. The main chamber houses the false sarcophagi of Mumtaz Mahal and Shah Jahan, while the real ones are in the basement. Perforated marble &quot;jalis&quot; (&quot;mahjar-i mushabbak&quot;) border the cenotaphs and are made from eight marble panels carved through with intricate pierce work inlaid in delicate detail with semi-precious stones. The cenotaphs were originally covered by a screen made of gold on the occasion of the second anniversary of Mumtaz Mahal&#x27;s death in 1633, which was later replaced by the marble screen in 1643.

Situated within the screen in the upper main chamber are the likenesses of the tombs of Mumtaz Mahal and Shah Jahan with the actual burials done below in the lower tomb chamber. From the southern main entrance room, a stairway leads to the lower tomb chamber which is rectangular in shape with walls laid with marble and an undecorated coved ceiling. The cenotaph of Mumtaz is located in the exact center of the chamber on a marble base of . Shah Jahan&#x27;s cenotaph is situated on a larger base on the western side in an asymmetrical arrangement. On the top is a traditional sculpture of a small pen box denoting it as a male tomb. The cenotaphs are aligned north–south, with the head towards the north and the bodies were laid in on their sides with the face turned towards the west, facing Mecca.

The calligraphy found on the marble cenotaphs in the tomb is particularly detailed and delicate. While the cenotaphs are similar to the ones from the Mughal era, no other tombs from the era were adorned with such an exquisite decoration. On Mumtaz&#x27;s sarcophagus on the top, the decoration consists of natural plum fruits, buds and flower blossoms inlaid with Qur&#x27;anic inscriptions with the epitaph reading &quot;The illumined grave of Arjumand Bano Begam, entided Mumtaz Mahal, who died in the year 1631&quot;. The original tomb in the lower level is largely undecorated, with Ninety Nine Names of God inscribed on the side. The false cenotaph of Shah Jahan has similar decorations and is covered with flowers and other scroll work without any inscriptions. The epitaph surrounded by red poppy flowers reads &quot;This is the sacred grave of His Most Exalted Majesty, Dweller in Paradise (Firdaus Ashiyani), Second Lord of the Auspicious. Conjunction (Sahib-i Qiran-i Sani), Shah Jahan, Padshah; may it ever be fragrant! The year 1076 [AD 1666]&quot;. The original cenotaph of Shah Jahan is a more simply decorated version with similar red flowers and yellow plants with a more comprehensive epitaph reading &quot;This is the illumined grave and sacred resting place of the emperor, dignified as Rizwan, residing in Eternity, His Majesty, having his abode in [the celestial realm of] Illiyun, Dweller in Paradise (Firdaus Ashiyani) [posthumous title of Shah Jahan], the Second Sahib-i Qiran, Shah Jahan, Padshah Ghazi [Warrior for the Faith]; may it be sanctified and may Paradise become his abode. He travelled from this world to the banquet hall of eternity on the night of the twenty-sixth of the month of Rajab, in the year one thousand and seventy-six Hijri [31 January AD 1666]&quot;.

=== Garden ===
The complex is set around a large &quot;charbagh&quot; or Mughal garden. The garden is divided by two main walkways (&quot;khiyaban&quot;) into four quadrants with further raised pathways that divide each of the four-quarters into 16 sunken parterres or flowerbeds. The garden is surrounded by a walkway connecting all the quadrants. Halfway between the tomb and gateway in the centre of the garden is a raised marble water tank with five fountains and a reflecting pool positioned on a north–south axis to reflect the image of the mausoleum. The elevated marble water tank is called &quot;al Hawd al-Kawthar&quot; in reference to the &quot;Tank of Abundance&quot; promised to Muhammad. Elsewhere, the garden is laid out with avenues of trees and fountains. In the north-western quadrant, is a place that marks the site where Mumtaz Mahal was first buried, before her body was moved to its final resting place inside the main chamber of the mausoleum.

The charbagh garden, a design inspired by Persian gardens, was introduced to India by Babur, the first Mughal emperor and symbolises the Paradise garden (Jannah) with four rivers flowing from a central spring or mountain, separating the garden into north, west, south and east. While most gardens of the era are rectangular with a tomb or pavilion in the centre, the Taj gardens is unusual in that the main element, the tomb, is located at the end of the garden. With the discovery of Mahtab Bagh (&quot;Moonlight Garden&quot;) on the other side of the Yamuna river, the Archaeological Survey of India has hypothesised that the Yamuna river itself was incorporated into the garden&#x27;s design and was meant to be seen as one of the rivers of Paradise. Similarities in layout and architectural features with the Shalimar Gardens suggest that both gardens may have been designed by the same architect, Ali Mardan. Early accounts of the garden describe its profusion of vegetation, including abundant roses, daffodils, and fruit trees. As the Mughal Empire declined, the gardens were not maintained, and when the British Raj assumed management of the gardens, they changed the landscaping to resemble the formal lawns of London in the 19th century.

The water supply for the gardens were derived from the Yamuna River, where a water channel transported the water into an underground reservoir along the eastern wall of a storage building containing multiple storage tanks. The water from the reservoir was lifted by means of a system of pulleys and wheels, turned by animals, to a tank that supplied an aqueduct which ran south carrying water up to the western wall before turning east. The water was later distributed throughout the garden through earthenware pipes embedded underground. The fountains in the central tank consisted of large vessels made of copper and inter-connected through copper pipes and the drop from the high walls created the necessary water for the fountains.

=== Outlying buildings ===
The Taj Mahal complex is enclosed by crenellated red sandstone walls on three sides, with the side facing the Yamuna river left open. Outside the complex walls, there are other mausoleums dedicated to Shah Jahan&#x27;s other wives, royals and favorite servants. The inner sides of the walls feature columned arcades, adorned with domed cuppola like chattris and smaller structures like the Music House interspersed between them. The main gateway, primarily built of marble, mirrors the tomb&#x27;s architecture and incorporates intricate decorations like bas-relief and pietra dura inlays. At the far end of the complex stand two similar buildings built of red sandstone, one of which is designated as a mosque and the other as a &quot;jawab&quot;, a structure to provide architectural symmetry. The mosque&#x27;s design resembles others built during the era and the jawab has floors with inlaid patterns while lacking a mihrab.

== Construction ==
The land on which the Taj Mahal is situated was present to the south of the walled city of Agra which was given to Shah Jahan by Raja Jai Singh I in exchange for a large palace in the centre of Agra. The building was commissioned in 1631, and construction commenced in 1632. An area of roughly was excavated, filled with dirt to reduce seepage, and levelled at above the riverbank level. In the tomb area, piles were dug and filled with lime and stone to form the footings of the tomb. The platform above the ground was constructed of brick and mortar.

The tomb complex was built mainly using brick and lime mortar. The external surface of the main tomb building and the interior of the main cenotaph chamber is veneered with white marble. The other interior surfaces and other accessory buildings are lined with red sandstone coated with a red octet for protection, excluding the exterior surfaces of domes. The white marble came from Makrana in Rajasthan, while the red sandstone was quarried from Fatehpur Sikri in Uttar Pradesh. Many precious and semi-precious stones, used for decoration, were imported from across the world, including jade and crystal from China, turquoise from Tibet, Lapis lazuli from Afghanistan, sapphire from Sri Lanka and carnelian from Arabia. In all, 28 types of precious and semi-precious stone were inlaid into the white marble.

It is believed that more than 20,000 artisans, labourers, painters and others were involved in the construction of the building. Specialist sculptors from Bukhara, calligraphers from Syria and Persia, designers from southern India, stone cutters from Baluchistan and Italian artisans were employed. Workmen constructed a colossal brick scaffold that mirrored the tomb rather than wooden scaffolds. A long earthern ramp was built to transport marble and materials to the construction site, hauled on specially constructed wagons by teams of oxen and elephants. An elaborate post-and-beam pulley system was used to raise the blocks into the desired position. Water was drawn from the river by a series of an animal-powered devices.

When the structure was partially completed, the first ceremony was held at the mausoleum by Shah Jahan on 6 February 1643, of the 12th anniversary of the death of Mumtaz Mahal. Construction of the mausoleum was completed in 1648, but work continued on other phases of the project for another five years. The Taj Mahal complex is believed to have been completed in its entirety in 1653 at a cost estimated at the time to be around 32 million, which in 2015 would be approximately 52.8 billion (827 million).

== Later years ==
In December 1652, Shah Jahan&#x27;s son Aurangzeb wrote a letter to his father about the tomb, the mosque and the assembly hall of the complex developing extensive leaks during the previous rainy season. In 1658, Shah Jahan was deposed by Aurangzeb and put under house arrest at the nearby Agra Fort from where he could see the Taj Mahal. Upon Shah Jahan&#x27;s death in 1666, Aurangzeb buried him in the mausoleum next to his wife. In the 18th century, the Jat rulers of Bharatpur attacked the Taj Mahal while invading Agra and took away two chandeliers, one of agate and another of silver, which had hung over the main cenotaph and the gold and silver screen. Kanbo, a Mughal historian, said the gold shield which covered the finial at the top of the main dome was also removed during the Jat despoliation.

By the late 19th century, parts of the buildings had fallen into disrepair. At the end of the century, British viceroy Lord Curzon ordered a restoration project, which was completed in 1908. He also commissioned the large lamp in the interior chamber and replaced the gardens with European-style lawns that are still in place today.

In 1942, the government erected scaffolding to disguise the building in anticipation of air attacks by the Japanese Air Force. Since Indian independence in 1947, the Archaeological Survey of India has been responsible for the maintenance of the monument. During the India-Pakistan wars of 1965 and 1971, scaffolding was again erected to mislead bomber pilots.

In 1983, the Taj Mahal was designated as a UNESCO World Heritage Site for being &quot;the jewel of Islamic art in India and one of the universally admired masterpieces of the world&#x27;s heritage&quot;.

Since the late 20th century, the monument has been affected by environmental pollution which has turned the Taj Mahal yellow-brown. Acid rain and pollution affecting the Yamuna River including the presence of Mathura Oil Refinery, have contributed to the same. After directives by the Supreme Court of India, in 1997 the Indian government set up the &quot;Taj Trapezium Zone (TTZ)&quot;, a area around the monument where strict emissions standards are in place.

Concerns for the tomb&#x27;s structural integrity have recently been raised because of a decline in the groundwater level in the Yamuna river basin, with cracks appearing in parts of the tomb in 2010 and the minarets surrounding the monument showing signs of tilting. Minor damage was reported due to storms on 11 April 2018 and 31 May 2020. In the 2020s, the Government of India has undertaken various restoration measures, including placing mud packs to restore the white color and replacing broken marble.

== Symbolism ==

Due to the global attention that it has received and the millions of visitors it attracts, the Taj Mahal has become a prominent image that is associated with India, and in this way has become a symbol of India itself.

Along with being a renowned symbol of love, the Taj Mahal is also a symbol of Shah Jahan&#x27;s wealth and power, and the fact that the empire had prospered under his rule. Bilateral symmetry, dominated by a central axis, has historically been used by rulers as a symbol of a ruling force that brings balance and harmony, and Shah Jahan applied that concept in the making of the Taj Mahal. Additionally, the plan is aligned in the cardinal north–south direction and the corners have been placed so that when seen from the centre of the plan, the sun can be seen rising and setting on the north and south corners on the summer and winter solstices respectively. This makes the Taj a symbolic horizon.

The planning and structure of the Taj Mahal, from the building itself to the gardens and beyond, is symbolic of Mumtaz Mahal&#x27;s mansion in the garden of Paradise. The concept of gardens of paradise is extended into the building of the mausoleum as well. The structure is decorated with colorful relief and semi-precious stones using a technique called &quot;parchin kari&quot;, symbolizing grandeur. The building appears to slightly change colour depending on the time of day and the weather. The white marble reflects varying hues—pinkish in the morning, milky white during the day, golden in the moonlight, and sometimes even a bluish hue under certain lighting conditions. This effect is due to the marble&#x27;s surface reacting to light and moisture, creating a magical and ever-changing visual experience. The sky has not only been incorporated in the design through the reflecting pools but also through the surface of the building itself. This is another way to imply the presence of Allah at the site.

According to Ebba Koch, art historian and international expert in the understanding and interpretation of Mughal architecture and the Taj Mahal, the planning of the entire compound symbolises earthly life and the afterlife, a subset of the symbolisation of the divine. The plan was split into twoone half is the white marble mausoleum itself and the gardens, and the other half is the red sandstone side, meant for worldly markets. Only the mausoleum is white so as to represent the enlightenment, spirituality and faith of Mumtaz Mahal. Koch has deciphered that symbolic of Islamic teachings, the plan of the worldly side is a mirror image of the otherworldly side, and the grand gate in the middle represents the transition between the two worlds.

== Tourism ==

The Taj Mahal is a major tourist attraction and attracts a large number of domestic and foreign visitors. About five million visitors visited Taj Mahal in the financial year 2022–23. A three-tier pricing system is in place, with a significantly lower entrance fee for Indian citizens and more expensive ones for foreigners. , the fee for Indian citizens was 50, for citizens of SAARC and BIMSTEC countries, it was 540 and for other foreign tourists, it was 1,100. Visitors are allowed through three gates and as polluting vehicles are not allowed near the complex, tourists must either walk or take electric buses from the designated parking areas. The complex is open on all days except on Friday from one hour before sunrise to 45 minutes before sunset. The complex is open for limited night viewing on the day of the full moon, excluding the month of Ramadan. In 2019, to address overtourism, the site instituted fines for visitors who stayed longer than three hours.

The small town to the south of the Taj, known as Taj Ganji or Mumtazabad, was initially constructed with caravanserais, bazaars and markets to serve the needs of visitors and workers. Lists of recommended travel destinations often feature the Taj Mahal, which also appears in several listings of seven wonders of the modern world, including the New Seven Wonders of the World, a poll conducted in 2007. Foreign dignitaries often visit the Taj Mahal on trips to India.

== Myths ==

Ever since its construction, the building has been the source of an admiration transcending culture and geography, and so personal and emotional responses have consistently eclipsed scholastic appraisals of the monument. A longstanding myth holds that Shah Jahan planned a mausoleum to be built in black marble as a Black Taj Mahal across the Yamuna river. The idea originates from fanciful writings of Jean-Baptiste Tavernier, a European traveler and gem merchant, who visited Agra in 1665. It was suggested that his son Aurangzeb overthrew Shah Jahan before it could be built. Ruins of blackened marble across the river in the Mehtab Bagh seeming to support the argument were, however, proven false after excavations carried out in the 1990s found that they were discolored white stones that had turned black. A more credible theory for the origins of the black mausoleum was demonstrated in 2006 by archaeologists who reconstructed part of the pool in the Mehtab Bagh. A dark reflection of the white mausoleum could clearly be seen, befitting Shah Jahan&#x27;s obsession with symmetry and the positioning of the pool itself.

No concrete evidence exists for claims that describe, often in horrific detail, the deaths, dismemberment and mutilations which Shah Jahan supposedly inflicted on various architects and craftsmen associated with the tomb. Some stories claim that those involved in construction signed contracts committing themselves to have no part in any similar design. No evidence exists for claims that Lord William Bentinck, governor-general of India in the 1830s, supposedly planned to demolish the Taj Mahal and auction off the marble. Bentinck&#x27;s biographer John Rosselli says that the story arose from Bentinck&#x27;s fund-raising sale of discarded marble from Agra Fort. Another myth suggests that beating the silhouette of the finial will cause water to come forth. To this day, officials find broken bangles surrounding the silhouette.

Several myths, none of which are supported by the archaeological record, have appeared asserting that people other than Shah Jahan and the original architects were responsible for the construction of the Taj Mahal. For instance, in 2000, India&#x27;s Supreme Court dismissed P. N. Oak&#x27;s petition to declare that a Hindu king built the Taj Mahal. In 2005, a similar petition brought by Amar Nath Mishra, a social worker and preacher claiming that the Taj Mahal was built by the Hindu king Paramardi in 1196, was dismissed by the Allahabad High Court. Several court cases and statements by right-wing politicians about Taj Mahal being a Hindu temple have been inspired by P. N. Oak&#x27;s 1989 book &quot;Taj Mahal: The True Story&quot;, in which he claimed it was built in 1155 AD and not in the 17th century. In November 2015, the Union Minister of Culture stated in the Indian Parliament that there was no evidence that it was ever a temple. In August 2017, the Archaeological Survey of India declared that there was no evidence to suggest the monument ever housed a temple.

Another such unsupported theory, that the Taj Mahal was designed by an Italian, Geronimo Vereneo, held sway for a brief period after it was first promoted by Henry George Keene in 1879. Keene went by a translation of a Spanish work, &quot;Itinerario&quot; (&quot;The Travels of Fray Sebastian Manrique, 1629–1643&quot;). Another theory, that a Frenchman named Austin of Bordeaux designed the Taj, was promoted by William Henry Sleeman based on the work of Jean-Baptiste Tavernier. These ideas were revived by Father Hosten and discussed again by E. B. Havell and served as the basis for subsequent theories and controversies.

<text>Porphyria is a group of disorders in which substances called porphyrins build up in the body, adversely affecting the skin or nervous system. The types that affect the nervous system are also known as acute porphyria, as symptoms are rapid in onset and short in duration. Symptoms of an attack include abdominal pain, chest pain, vomiting, confusion, constipation, fever, high blood pressure, and high heart rate. The attacks usually last for days to weeks. Complications may include paralysis, low blood sodium levels, and seizures. Attacks may be triggered by alcohol, smoking, hormonal changes, fasting, stress, or certain medications. If the skin is affected, blisters or itching may occur with sunlight exposure.
Most types of porphyria are inherited from one or both of a person&#x27;s parents and are due to a mutation in one of the genes that make heme. They may be inherited in an autosomal dominant, autosomal recessive, or X-linked dominant manner. One type, &quot;porphyria cutanea tarda&quot;, may also be due to hemochromatosis (increased iron in the liver), hepatitis C, alcohol, or HIV/AIDS. The underlying mechanism results in a decrease in the amount of heme produced and a build-up of substances involved in making heme. Porphyrias may also be classified by whether the liver or bone marrow is affected. Diagnosis is typically made by blood, urine, and stool tests. Genetic testing may be done to determine the specific mutation. Hepatic porphyrias are those in which the enzyme deficiency occurs in the liver. Hepatic porphyrias include acute intermittent porphyria (AIP), variegate porphyria (VP), aminolevulinic acid dehydratase deficiency porphyria (ALAD), hereditary coproporphyria (HCP), and porphyria cutanea tarda.
Treatment depends on the type of porphyria and the person&#x27;s symptoms. Treatment of porphyria of the skin generally involves the avoidance of sunlight, while treatment for acute porphyria may involve giving intravenous heme or a glucose solution. Rarely, a liver transplant may be carried out.
The precise prevalence of porphyria is unclear, but it is estimated to affect between 1 and 100 per 50,000 people. Rates are different around the world. Porphyria cutanea tarda is believed to be the most common type. The disease was described as early as 370 BC by Hippocrates. The underlying mechanism was first described by German physiologist and chemist Felix Hoppe-Seyler in 1871. The name &quot;porphyria&quot; is from the Greek πορφύρα, &quot;porphyra&quot;, meaning &quot;purple&quot;, a reference to the color of the urine that may be present during an attack.
==Signs and symptoms==

===Acute porphyrias===
Acute intermittent porphyria (AIP), variegate porphyria (VP), aminolevulinic acid dehydratase deficiency porphyria (ALAD) and hereditary coproporphyria (HCP). These diseases primarily affect the nervous system, resulting in episodic crises known as acute attacks. The major symptom of an acute attack is abdominal pain, often accompanied by vomiting, hypertension (elevated blood pressure), and tachycardia (an abnormally rapid heart rate).

The most severe episodes may involve neurological complications: typically motor neuropathy (severe dysfunction of the peripheral nerves that innervate muscle), which leads to muscle weakness and potentially to quadriplegia (paralysis of all four limbs) and central nervous system symptoms such as seizures and coma. Occasionally, there may be short-lived psychiatric symptoms such as anxiety, confusion, hallucinations, and, very rarely, overt psychosis. All these symptoms resolve once the acute attack passes.

Given the many presentations and the relatively low occurrence of porphyria, patients may initially be suspected to have other, unrelated conditions. For instance, the polyneuropathy of acute porphyria may be mistaken for Guillain–Barré syndrome, and porphyria testing is commonly recommended in those situations. Elevation of aminolevulinic acid from lead-induced disruption of heme synthesis results in lead poisoning having symptoms similar to acute porphyria.

===Chronic porphyrias===
The non-acute porphyrias are X-linked dominant protoporphyria (XLDPP), congenital erythropoietic porphyria (CEP), porphyria cutanea tarda (PCT), and erythropoietic protoporphyria (EPP). None of these is associated with acute attacks: their primary manifestation is with skin disease. For this reason, these four porphyrias—along with two acute porphyrias, VP and HCP, that may also involve skin manifestations—are sometimes called cutaneous porphyrias.

Skin disease is encountered where excess porphyrins accumulate in the skin. Porphyrins are photoactive molecules, and exposure to light results in promotion of electrons to higher energy levels. When these return to the resting energy level or ground state, energy is released. This accounts for the property of fluorescence typical of the porphyrins. This causes local skin damage.

Two distinct patterns of skin disease are seen in porphyria:
* Immediate photosensitivity. This is typical of XLDPP and EPP. Following a variable period of sun exposure—typically about 30 minutes—patients complain of severe pain, burning, and discomfort in exposed areas. Typically, the effects are not visible, though occasionally there may be some redness and swelling of the skin.
* Vesiculo-erosive skin disease. This—a reference to the characteristic blistering (vesicles) and open sores (erosions) noted in patients—is the pattern seen in CEP, PCT, VP, and HCP. The changes are noted only in sun-exposed areas such as the face and back of the hands. Milder skin disease, such as that seen in VP and HCP, consists of increased skin fragility in exposed areas with a tendency to form blisters and erosions, particularly after minor knocks or scrapes. These heal slowly, often leaving small scars that may be lighter or darker than normal skin. More severe skin disease is sometimes seen in PCT, with prominent lesions, darkening of exposed skin such as the face, and hypertrichosis: abnormal hair growth on the face, particularly the cheeks. The most severe disease is seen in CEP and a rare variant of PCT known as hepatoerythropoietic porphyria (HEP); symptoms include severe shortening of digits, loss of skin appendages such as hair and nails, and severe scarring of the skin with progressive disappearance of ears, lips, and nose. Patients may also show deformed, discolored teeth or gum and eye abnormalities.

===Congenital porphyrias===
* Congenital porphyrias are genetic disorders caused by mutations in enzymes involved in the heme biosynthesis pathway. There are several types of congenital porphyrias, including erythropoietic protoporphyria (EPP), congenital erythropoietic porphyria (CEP), and porphyria cutanea tarda (PCT). Each type is characterized by specific enzyme deficiencies leading to the accumulation of different porphyrins.
* Erythropoietic protoporphyria (EPP) is caused by a deficiency in ferrochelatase, leading to the accumulation of protoporphyrin IX in red blood cells, plasma, and tissues. Patients with EPP experience severe photosensitivity, with exposure to sunlight causing painful skin reactions.
* Congenital erythropoietic porphyria (CEP), also known as Günther&#x27;s disease, results from a deficiency in uroporphyrinogen III synthase. This leads to the accumulation of uroporphyrin I and coproporphyrin I in the bone marrow, blood, and urine. Symptoms of CEP include severe photosensitivity, anemia, splenomegaly, and often disfiguring cutaneous lesions.
* Diagnosis of congenital porphyrias involves clinical evaluation, biochemical testing, and genetic analysis. Treatment aims to manage symptoms and prevent acute attacks by avoiding triggers, such as sunlight exposure, certain medications, and alcohol. Additionally, treatments may include phlebotomy to reduce iron levels in PCT, administration of heme preparations to alleviate symptoms, and liver transplantation in severe cases. Early diagnosis and appropriate management are crucial in improving the quality of life for individuals with congenital porphyrias.

==Cause==
The porphyrias are generally considered genetic in nature.

===Genetics===
Subtypes of porphyrias depend on which enzyme is deficient.

X-linked dominant protoporphyria is a rare form of erythropoietic protoporphyria caused by a gain-of-function mutation in ALAS2 characterized by severe photosensitivity.

In the autosomal recessive types, anyone who inherit a single gene may become a carrier. Generally they do not have symptoms but may pass the gene on to offspring.

===Triggers===
Acute porphyria can be triggered by a number of drugs, most of which are believed to trigger it by interacting with enzymes in the liver that are made with heme. Such drugs include:
* Sulfonamides, including sulfadiazine, sulfasalazine and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole.
* Sulfonylureas like glibenclamide, gliclazide and glimepiride, although glipizide is thought to be safe.
* Barbiturates including thiopental, phenobarbital, primidone, etc.
* Systemic treatment with antifungals including fluconazole, griseofulvin, ketoconazole and voriconazole. (Topical use of these agents is thought to be safe due to minimal systemic absorption.)
* Certain antibiotics like rifapentine, rifampicin, rifabutine, isoniazid, nitrofurantoin and, possibly, metronidazole.
* Ergot derivatives including dihydroergotamine, ergometrine, ergotamine, methysergide, etc.
* Certain antiretroviral medications ( indinavir, nevirapine, ritonavir, saquinavir, etc.)
* Progestogens
* Some anticonvulsants including: carbamazepine, ethosuximide, phenytoin, topiramate, valproate.
* Some painkillers like dextropropoxyphene, ketorolac, metamizole, pentazocine
* Some cancer treatments like bexarotene, busulfan, chlorambucil, estramustine, etoposide, flutamide, idarubicin, ifosfamide, irinotecan, ixabepilone, letrozole, lomustine, megestrol, mitomycin, mitoxantrone, paclitaxel, procarbazine, tamoxifen, topotecan
* Some antidepressants like imipramine, phenelzine, trazodone
* Some antipsychotics like risperidone, ziprasidone
* Some retinoids used for skin conditions like acitretin and isotretinoin
* Miscellaneous others including: cocaine, methyldopa, fenfluramine, disulfiram, orphenadrine, pentoxifylline, and sodium aurothiomalate.

==Pathogenesis==
In humans, porphyrins are the main precursors of heme, an essential constituent of hemoglobin, myoglobin, catalase, peroxidase, and P450 liver cytochromes.

The body requires porphyrins to produce heme, which is used to carry oxygen in the blood among other things, but in the porphyrias there is a deficiency (inherited or acquired) of the enzymes that transform the various porphyrins into others, leading to abnormally high levels of one or more of these substances. Porphyrias are classified in two ways, by symptoms and by pathophysiology. Physiologically, porphyrias are classified as liver or erythropoietic based on the sites of accumulation of heme precursors, either in the liver or in the bone marrow and red blood cells.

Deficiency in the enzymes of the porphyrin pathway leads to insufficient production of heme. Heme function plays a central role in cellular metabolism. This is not the main problem in the porphyrias; most heme synthesis enzymes—even dysfunctional enzymes—have enough residual activity to assist in heme biosynthesis. The principal problem in these deficiencies is the accumulation of porphyrins, the heme precursors, which are toxic to tissue in high concentrations. The chemical properties of these intermediates determine the location of accumulation, whether they induce photosensitivity, and whether the intermediate is excreted (in the urine or feces).

There are eight enzymes in the heme biosynthetic pathway, four of which—the first one and the last three—are in the mitochondria, while the other four are in the cytosol. Defects in any of these can lead to some form of porphyria. The hepatic porphyrias are characterized by acute neurological attacks (seizures, psychosis, extreme back and abdominal pain, and an acute polyneuropathy), while the erythropoietic forms present with skin problems, usually a light-sensitive blistering rash and increased hair growth. &quot;Variegate porphyria&quot; (also &quot;porphyria variegata&quot; or &quot;mixed porphyria&quot;), which results from a partial deficiency in PROTO oxidase, manifests itself with skin lesions similar to those of porphyria cutanea tarda combined with acute neurologic attacks. Hereditary coproporphyria, which is characterized by a deficiency in coproporphyrinogen oxidase, coded for by the CPOX gene, may also present with both acute neurologic attacks and cutaneous lesions. All other porphyrias are either skin- or nerve-predominant.

==Diagnosis==

===Porphyrin studies===
Porphyria is diagnosed through biochemical analysis of blood, urine, and stool. In general, urine estimation of porphobilinogen (PBG) is the first step if acute porphyria is suspected. As a result of feedback, the decreased production of heme leads to increased production of precursors, PBG being one of the first substances in the porphyrin synthesis pathway. In nearly all cases of acute porphyria syndromes, urinary PBG is markedly elevated except for the very rare ALA dehydratase deficiency or in patients with symptoms due to hereditary tyrosinemia type I. In cases of
mercury- or arsenic poisoning-induced porphyria, other changes in porphyrin profiles appear, most notably elevations of uroporphyrins I &amp; III, coproporphyrins I &amp; III, and pre-coproporphyrin.

As most porphyrias are rare conditions, general hospital labs typically do not have the expertise, technology, or staff time to perform porphyria testing. In general, testing involves sending samples of blood, stool, and urine to a reference laboratory. All samples to detect porphyrins must be handled properly. Samples should be taken during an acute attack; otherwise a false negative result may occur. Samples must be protected from light and either refrigerated or preserved.

If all the porphyrin studies are negative, one must consider pseudoporphyria. A careful medication review often will find the cause of pseudoporphyria.

===Additional tests===
Further diagnostic tests of affected organs may be required, such as nerve conduction studies for neuropathy or an ultrasound of the liver. Basic biochemical tests may assist in identifying liver disease, hepatocellular carcinoma, and other organ problems.

•Other Diagnosis

Clinical Evaluation: A thorough medical history and physical examination focusing on symptoms related to photosensitivity, skin lesions, abdominal pain, and neurological manifestations.

Genetic Testing: Molecular genetic testing to identify specific gene mutations associated with congenital porphyrias.

Other Tests: Liver function tests, iron studies, and imaging studies such as ultrasound or MRI may be conducted to evaluate liver and spleen involvement.

==Management==

===Acute porphyria===

====Carbohydrate administration====
Often, empirical treatment is required if the diagnostic suspicion of a porphyria is high since acute attacks can be fatal. A high-carbohydrate diet is typically recommended; in severe attacks, a dextrose 10% infusion is commenced, which may aid in recovery by suppressing heme synthesis, which in turn reduces the rate of porphyrin accumulation. However, this can worsen cases of low blood sodium levels (hyponatraemia) and should be done with extreme caution as it can prove fatal.

====Heme analogs====
Hematin (trade name Panhematin) and heme arginate (trade name NormoSang) are the drugs of choice in acute porphyria in the United States and the United Kingdom respectively. These drugs need to be given very early in an attack to be effective; effectiveness varies amongst individuals. They are not curative drugs but can shorten attacks and reduce the intensity of an attack. Side effects are rare but can be serious. These heme-like substances theoretically inhibit ALA synthase and hence the accumulation of toxic precursors. In the United Kingdom, supplies of NormoSang are kept at two national centers; emergency supply is available from St Thomas&#x27;s Hospital, London. In the United States, Lundbeck manufactures and supplies Panhematin for infusion.

Heme arginate (NormoSang) is used during crises but also in preventive treatment to avoid crises, one treatment every 10 days.

Any sign of low blood sodium (hyponatremia) or weakness should be treated with the addition of hematin, heme arginate, or even tin mesoporphyrin, as these are signs of impending syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone (SIADH) or peripheral nervous system involvement that may be localized or severe, progressing to bulbar paresis and respiratory paralysis.

====Cimetidine====
Cimetidine has also been reported to be effective for acute porphyric crisis and possibly effective for long-term prophylaxis.

====Symptom control====
Pain is severe, frequently out of proportion to physical signs, and often requires the use of opiates to reduce it to tolerable levels. Pain should be treated as early as medically possible. Nausea can be severe; it may respond to phenothiazine drugs but is sometimes intractable. Hot baths and showers may lessen nausea temporarily, though caution should be used to avoid scalds or falls.

====Early identification====
It is recommended that patients with a history of acute porphyria, and even genetic carriers, wear an alert bracelet or other identification at all times. This is in case they develop severe symptoms, or in case of accidents where there is a potential for drug exposure, and as a result they are unable to explain their condition to healthcare professionals. Some drugs are absolutely contraindicated for patients with any form of porphyria.

====Neurologic and psychiatric disorders====
Patients who experience frequent attacks can develop chronic neuropathic pain in extremities as well as chronic pain in the abdomen. Intestinal pseudo-obstruction, ileus, intussusception, hypoganglionosis, and encopresis in children have been associated with porphyrias. This is thought to be due to axonal nerve deterioration in affected areas of the nervous system and vagal nerve dysfunction. Pain treatment with long-acting opioids, such as morphine, is often indicated, and, in cases where seizure or neuropathy is present, gabapentin is known to improve outcome.

Seizures often accompany this disease. Most seizure medications exacerbate this condition. Treatment can be problematic: barbiturates especially must be avoided. Some benzodiazepines are safe and, when used in conjunction with newer anti-seizure medications such as gabapentin, offer a possible regimen for seizure control. Gabapentin has the additional feature of aiding in the treatment of some kinds of neuropathic pain. Magnesium sulfate and bromides have also been used in porphyria seizures; however, development of status epilepticus in porphyria may not respond to magnesium alone. The addition of hematin or heme arginate has been used during status epilepticus.

Depression often accompanies the disease and is best dealt with by treating the offending symptoms and if needed the judicious use of antidepressants. Some psychotropic drugs are porphyrinogenic, limiting the therapeutic scope. Other psychiatric symptoms such as anxiety, restlessness, insomnia, depression, mania, hallucinations, delusions, confusion, catatonia, and psychosis may occur.

====Underlying liver disease====
Some liver diseases may cause porphyria even in the absence of genetic predisposition. These include hemochromatosis and hepatitis C. Treatment of iron overload may be required.

Patients with the acute porphyrias (AIP, HCP, VP) are at increased risk over their life for hepatocellular carcinoma (primary liver cancer) and may require monitoring. Other typical risk factors for liver cancer need not be present.

====Hormone treatment====
Hormonal fluctuations that contribute to cyclical attacks in women have been treated with oral contraceptives and luteinizing hormones to shut down menstrual cycles. However, oral contraceptives have also triggered photosensitivity and withdrawal of oral contraceptives has triggered attacks. Androgens and fertility hormones have also triggered attacks. In 2019, givosiran was approved in the United States for the treatment of acute hepatic porphyria.

===Erythropoietic porphyria===
These are associated with accumulation of porphyrins in erythrocytes and are rare.

The pain, burning, swelling, and itching that occur in erythropoietic porphyrias (EP) generally require avoidance of bright sunlight. Most kinds of sunscreen are not effective, but SPF-rated long-sleeve shirts, hats, bandanas, and gloves can help. Chloroquine may be used to increase porphyrin secretion in some EPs. Blood transfusion is occasionally used to suppress innate heme production.

The rarest is congenital erythropoietic porphyria (CEP), otherwise known as Gunther&#x27;s disease. The signs may present from birth and include severe photosensitivity, brown teeth that fluoresce in ultraviolet light due to deposition of Type 1 porphyrins, and later hypertrichosis. Hemolytic anemia usually develops. Pharmaceutical-grade beta carotene may be used in its treatment. A bone marrow transplant has also been successful in curing CEP in a few cases, although long-term results are not yet available.

In December 2014, afamelanotide received authorization from the European Commission as a treatment for the prevention of phototoxicity in adult patients with EPP. In a 2023 industry-funded phase 2 trial, dersimelagon, an orally administered, selective melanocortin 1 receptor agonist that increases levels of skin eumelanin, was reported to have increased the duration of symptom-free sunlight exposure and quality of life compared to placebo in patients with erythropoietic protoporphyria.

==Epidemiology==
Rates of all types of porphyria taken together have been estimated to be approximately one in 25,000 in the United States. The worldwide prevalence has been estimated to be between one in 500 and one in 50,000 people.

Porphyrias have been detected in all races and in many ethnic groups on every continent. There are high incidence reports of AIP in areas of India and Scandinavia. More than 200 genetic variants of AIP are known, some of which are specific to families, although some strains have proven to be repeated mutations.

===Other Information===

The epidemiology of congenital porphyrias varies depending on the specific type of porphyria. Here&#x27;s a general overview:

1. Erythropoietic Protoporphyria (EPP): EPP is relatively rare, with an estimated prevalence of 1 to 9 cases per 100,000 individuals worldwide. It affects both males and females, typically presenting in childhood or early adulthood.

2. Congenital Erythropoietic Porphyria (CEP): CEP is extremely rare, with fewer than 200 cases reported worldwide. It is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner, meaning both parents must carry a mutated gene for a child to develop the condition. CEP occurs with higher frequency in certain populations, including individuals of Northern European descent.

3. Porphyria Cutanea Tarda (PCT): PCT is the most common form of porphyria, with an estimated prevalence of 1 to 2 cases per 10,000 individuals in the general population. It predominantly affects adults, with a higher prevalence in men than in women. PCT can be sporadic or familial and is often associated with underlying liver disease, alcohol abuse, hepatitis C infection, or certain medications.

These prevalence estimates may vary across different regions and populations, and the actual prevalence of congenital porphyrias may be underreported due to challenges in diagnosis and awareness. Additionally, advances in genetic testing and increased awareness of porphyria may lead to more accurate epidemiological data in the future.

==History==
The underlying mechanism was first described by the German physiologist Felix Hoppe-Seyler in 1871, and acute porphyrias were described by the Dutch physician Barend Stokvis in 1889.

The links between porphyrias and mental illness have been noted for decades. In the early 1950s, patients with porphyrias (occasionally referred to as &quot;porphyric hemophilia&quot;) and severe symptoms of depression or catatonia were treated with electroshock therapy.

===Vampires and werewolves===
Porphyria has been suggested as an explanation for the origin of vampire and werewolf legends, based upon certain perceived similarities between the condition and the folklore.

In January 1964, L. Illis&#x27;s 1963 paper &#x27;On Porphyria and the Aetiology of Werewolves&#x27; was published in &quot;Proceedings of the Royal Society of Medicine. &quot;Later, Nancy Garden argued for a connection between porphyria and the vampire belief in her 1973 book &quot;Vampires&quot;. In 1985, biochemist David Dolphin&#x27;s paper for the American Association for the Advancement of Science, &#x27;Porphyria, Vampires, and Werewolves: The Aetiology of European Metamorphosis Legends&#x27;, gained widespread media coverage, popularizing the idea.

The theory has been rejected by a few folklorists and researchers as not accurately describing the characteristics of the original werewolf and vampire legends nor the disease and as potentially stigmatizing people with porphyria.

A 1995 article from the &quot;Postgraduate Medical Journal&quot; (via NIH) explains:
As it was believed that the folkloric vampire could move about freely in daylight hours, as opposed to the 20th century variant, congenital erythropoietic porphyria cannot readily explain the folkloric vampire but may be an explanation of the vampire as we know it in the 20th century. In addition, the folkloric vampire, when unearthed, was always described as looking quite healthy (&quot;as they were in life&quot;), whereas owing to disfiguring aspects of the disease sufferers would not have passed the exhumation test. Individuals with congenital erythropoietic porphyria do not crave blood. The enzyme (hematin) necessary to alleviate symptoms is not absorbed intact on oral ingestion, and drinking blood would have no beneficial effect on the sufferer. Finally, and most important, the fact that vampire reports were rampant in the 18th century, and that congenital erythropoietic porphyria is an extremely rare manifestation of a rare disease, makes it an unlikely explanation of the folkloric vampire.

===Notable cases===
* George III. The mental illness exhibited by George III in the regency crisis of 1788 has inspired several attempts at retrospective diagnosis. The first, written in 1855, thirty-five years after his death, concluded that he had acute mania. M. Guttmacher, in 1941, suggested manic-depressive psychosis as a more likely diagnosis. The first suggestion that a physical illness was the cause of King George&#x27;s mental derangement came in 1966, in a paper called &quot;The Insanity of King George III: A Classic Case of Porphyria&quot;, with a follow-up in 1968, &quot;Porphyria in the Royal Houses of Stuart, Hanover and Prussia&quot;. The papers, by a mother/son psychiatrist team, were written as though the case for porphyria had been proven, but the response demonstrated that many experts, including those more intimately familiar with the manifestations of porphyria, were unconvinced. Many psychiatrists disagreed with the diagnosis, suggesting bipolar disorder as far more probable. The theory is treated in &quot;Purple Secret,&quot; which documents the ultimately unsuccessful search for genetic evidence of porphyria in the remains of royals suspected to have had it. In 2005, it was suggested that arsenic (which is known to be porphyrogenic) given to George III with antimony may have caused his porphyria. This study found high levels of arsenic in King George&#x27;s hair. In 2010, one analysis of historical records argued that the porphyria claim was based on spurious and selective interpretation of contemporary medical and historical sources. The mental illness of George III is the basis of the plot in &quot;The Madness of King George&quot;, a 1994 British film based upon the 1991 Alan Bennett play, &quot;The Madness of George III&quot;. The closing credits of the film include the comment that the King&#x27;s symptoms suggest that he had porphyria, and note that the disease is &quot;periodic, unpredictable, and hereditary&quot;. The traditional argument that George III did not have porphyria, but rather bipolar disorder, is thoroughly defended by Andrew Roberts in his new biography &quot;The Last King of America&quot;.
* Descendants of George III. Among other descendants of George III theorized by the authors of &quot;Purple Secret&quot; to have had porphyria (based on analysis of their extensive and detailed medical correspondence) were his great-great-granddaughter Princess Charlotte of Prussia (Emperor William II&#x27;s eldest sister) and her daughter Princess Feodora of Saxe-Meiningen. They uncovered better evidence that George III&#x27;s great-great-great-grandson Prince William of Gloucester was reliably diagnosed with variegate porphyria.
* Mary, Queen of Scots. It is believed that Mary, Queen of Scots, King George III&#x27;s ancestor, also had acute intermittent porphyria, although this is subject to much debate. It is assumed she inherited the disorder, if indeed she had it, from her father, James V of Scotland. Both father and daughter endured well-documented attacks that could fall within the constellation of symptoms of porphyria.
* Maria I of Portugal. Maria I—known as Maria the Pious or Maria the Mad because of both her religious fervor and her acute mental illness, which made her incapable of handling state affairs after 1792—is also thought to have had porphyria. Francis Willis, the physician who treated George III, was even summoned by the Portuguese court but returned to England after the court limited the treatments he could oversee. Contemporary sources, such as Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs Luís Pinto de Sousa Coutinho, noted that the queen had ever-worsening stomach pains and abdominal spasms: hallmarks of porphyria.
* Vincent van Gogh. Other commentators have suggested that Vincent van Gogh may have had acute intermittent porphyria.
* King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon. The description of this king in Daniel 4 suggests to some that he had porphyria.
* Physician Archie Cochrane. He was born with porphyria, which caused health problems throughout his life.
* Paula Frías Allende. The daughter of the Chilean novelist Isabel Allende. She fell into a porphyria-induced coma in 1991, which inspired Isabel to write the memoir &quot;Paula&quot;, dedicated to her.

===Uses in literature===
Stated or implied references to porphyria are included in some literature, particularly gothic literature. These include the following:
* The condition is the name of the title character in the gothic poem &quot;Porphyria&#x27;s Lover,&quot; by Robert Browning.
* The condition is heavily implied to be the cause of the symptoms suffered by the narrator in the gothic short story &quot;Lusus Naturae,&quot; by Margaret Atwood. Some of the narrator&#x27;s symptoms resemble those of porphyria, and one passage of the story states that the name of the narrator&#x27;s disease &quot;had some Ps and Rs in it.&quot;

<doc id="82980" wikidata="Q29451" url="?curid=82980" title="Kidnapping of Elizabeth Smart">
<text>Elizabeth Ann Smart, aged 14, was kidnapped on June 5, 2002, by Brian David Mitchell from her home in the Federal Heights neighborhood of Salt Lake City, Utah. She was held captive by Mitchell and his wife, Wanda Barzee, on the outskirts of Salt Lake City, and later, in San Diego County, California. Her captivity lasted approximately nine months before she was discovered in Sandy, Utah, approximately from her home.

Smart was abducted at knife-point by Mitchell, while her younger sister, Mary Katherine, pretended to be asleep. Mitchell, who claimed to be a religious preacher, held Smart at a camp in the woods with Barzee, where he repeatedly raped her. During her captivity, Smart accompanied her captors in public on various occasions dressed head-to-toe in white robes and went largely unrecognized by those she came in contact with.

Since her abduction and rescue, Smart has become an advocate for missing persons and victims of sexual assault. Barzee was sentenced to fifteen years in federal prison in 2009 for her role in the abduction, although she was granted early release on September 19, 2018, for previously uncredited time served. Mitchell was diagnosed by forensic psychologists as having antisocial and narcissistic personality disorders. Extensive disputes over his competence to stand trial lasted several years before he was deemed mentally capable in 2010; he was sentenced to life imprisonment without the possibility of parole in 2011.

==Backgrounds of the kidnappers==
Brian David Mitchell was born on October 18, 1953, in Salt Lake City, Utah, the third of six children in a family belonging to The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church). His mother was a teacher and his father was a social worker. In order to teach Mitchell about sex, his father reportedly showed his adolescent son explicit photos from a medical journal, and, in order to teach him about independence, would drive him to unfamiliar parts of the city, drop him off, and leave him to find his way back home.

At age 16, Mitchell exposed himself to a child and was sent to a juvenile hall. At age 19, he married sixteen-year-old Karen Minor, with whom he had two children. After their divorce, Minor was awarded custody of both children, after which Mitchell temporarily fled with the children to New Hampshire. He resided there for two years, joining a Hare Krishna commune. 

Mitchell had a history of drug and alcohol abuse in his adult life; upon returning to Salt Lake City, he was inspired to seek sobriety by his brother, who had recently returned from an LDS Church mission. In Salt Lake City, Mitchell had two additional children with his second wife, Debbie, who herself had three children from a previous marriage. Debbie alleged that Mitchell was abusive during their marriage, and they divorced in 1984. After their separation, Debbie alleged that Mitchell had sexually abused their three-year-old son; the claim could not be medically confirmed, but Mitchell&#x27;s future visitations with his children were ordered to be supervised by the Division of Child and Family Services. One of Debbie&#x27;s daughters from her previous marriage would later claim that Mitchell had sexually abused her for four years.

On the day his divorce from Debbie was finalized, Mitchell married Wanda Elaine Barzee ( November 6, 1945, in Salt Lake City), a then-forty-year-old divorcee with six children. Barzee had a troubled relationship with her children; one of her daughters would later refer to her as a &quot;monster,&quot; and she also claimed that when she was a child, Barzee fed her pet rabbit to her for dinner. 

Together, Mitchell and Barzee became actively involved in the LDS Church. Eventually Mitchell began going by the name &quot;Immanuel David Isaiah,&quot; claiming to be a prophet of God who experienced visions. The name relates to Mitchell&#x27;s belief that he was the &quot;Davidic Servant&quot; spoken of in Avraham Gileadi&#x27;s book &quot;The Literary Message of Isaiah&quot;. For this, the two were excommunicated from the church in absentia in June 2002. Barzee began going by the name &quot;Hephzibah,&quot; and the two would panhandle and preach in downtown Salt Lake City. Mitchell presented himself in an image that was akin to the image of Jesus, dressing in white robes and tunics, and growing a beard.

==Abduction==

In the early hours of June 5, 2002, Mitchell broke into the home of Ed and Lois Smart in the Federal Heights neighborhood of Salt Lake City, where they lived with their six children. He abducted fourteen-year-old Elizabeth Smart from the bedroom she shared with her nine-year-old sister, Mary Katherine. Mary Katherine was awakened but pretended to be asleep, and later reported that:
*The man was white, about the height of her brother Charles (5 ft 8 in; 172 cm), about 40years of age, and wearing light-colored clothes and a golf hat (he was in fact actually wearing black, did not have a golf hat, and was 48years of age).&lt;ref name=&quot;Deseret18June2002/name&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
*The man had dark hair, and also had dark hair on his arms and on the backs of his hands.
*The man threatened Elizabeth with a knife (which 9-year-old Mary Katherine thought was a gun at the time).
*She never got a good look at the man&#x27;s face, a fact kept secret by the police during the investigation.
*When Elizabeth said &quot;ouch&quot; after stubbing her toe on a chair, the man said something that sounded to her like &quot;You better be quiet, and I won&#x27;t hurt you.&quot;
*When her sister Elizabeth asked &quot;Why are you doing this?&quot; the man&#x27;s reply was not clear to her, but Mary Katherine thought he may have said &quot;for ransom.&quot;
*The man was calm and soft-even and nicely dressed.
*The man&#x27;s voice seemed somehow familiar to her, despite his having spoken quietly to her sister Elizabeth throughout; however, though she tried, Mary Katherine was unable to pinpoint the circumstances under which she might have heard it.

When she thought Elizabeth and the abductor had gone, Mary Katherine attempted to go to her parents&#x27; bedroom, but only narrowly avoided being seen by Mitchell and Elizabeth, who were outside the bedroom of the family&#x27;s boys. She crept back into her bed, where she hid for an undetermined possibly over two hours.
Just before 4:00a.m. Mary Katherine woke her parents and told them what had happened, but thinking she had been dreaming, her parents did not believe her until they found a window screen that had been cut with a knife.

==Search and investigation==
On June 6, 2002, Ed and Lois went on television and pleaded for the kidnapper to return their daughter.

A massive regional search effort, organized by the Laura Recovery Center, involved up to 2,000 volunteers each day, as well as dogs and planes. Various websites carried flyers that could be printed or circulated via the internet. After many days of intensive searching, the community-led search was ended and efforts were directed to other means of finding Elizabeth.

Mary Katherine&#x27;s observations were of little use, and there was little usable evidence found at the scene such as fingerprints or DNA. A search using bloodhounds was unsuccessful. Police questioned and interviewed hundreds of potential suspects including a 26-year-old who was cleared after being located in a West Virginia hospital. The investigation had the side effect of returning several at-large criminals to prison, but Elizabeth was not found.

The Salt Lake City police considered Richard Ricci a person of interest early in the investigation. Ricci was a handyman with a history of drug abuse who had worked for the Smarts; he had been jailed on an unrelated parole violation prior. Ricci died of a brain hemorrhage in August 2002.

To keep Elizabeth&#x27;s name in the press, her family used a variety of strategies, including making a website about her abduction and providing home videos.

==Captivity==
After her kidnapping, Mitchell repeatedly told Smart that she was blessed that this was happening to her, and that she should be thankful, though Smart refused to believe him. Mitchell forced Smart to walk four miles in her nightgown into the woods to an encampment outside of Salt Lake City, where she was met by Wanda Barzee. According to Smart&#x27;s testimony, Barzee &quot;eventually just proceeded to wash my feet and told me to change out of my pajamas into a robe type of garment. And when I refused, she said if I didn&#x27;t, she would have Brian Mitchell come rip my pajamas off. I put the robe on. He came and performed a ceremony, which was to marry me to him. After that, he proceeded to rape me many times.&quot; Mitchell claimed to be an angel and he also told Smart that he was a Davidic King who would &quot;emerge in seven years, be stoned by a mob, lie dead in the streets for three days and then rise up and kill the Antichrist.&quot; Smart, he insisted, was the first of many virgin brides he planned to kidnap, each of whom would accompany him as he battled the Antichrist.

To keep Smart from escaping, she was shackled to a tree with a metal cable around her leg, which allowed her limited mobility outside of the tent she occupied, or hidden in a hole covered by boards. During her captivity, she was forced to take a new name, and she chose the name Esther, after Esther of the Old Testament (Mitchell also called her Shearjashub). It was later revealed during court testimony that Mitchell repeatedly raped Smart, sometimes multiple times a day, forced her to look at pornographic magazines, and regularly threatened to kill her. He often forced her to drink alcohol and take drugs to lower her resistance, and both starved her and fed her garbage. Smart&#x27;s abuse was facilitated with the assistance of Barzee, whom Smart would later refer to as the &quot;most evil woman&quot; she had ever met.

===Public appearances===

Smart accompanied Mitchell and Barzee in public on numerous occasions, but her presence was either obscured or unnoticed via various methods of concealment, which often consisted of her wearing a headscarf and a face veil. In August 2002, around two months after Smart&#x27;s kidnapping, Mitchell devised a plan to leave Salt Lake City with Barzee and Smart, possibly to Boston or New York City. To research potential places to relocate, Mitchell and Barzee visited the Salt Lake City Public Library with Smart. There, they were noticed by a library patron due to their unusual styles of dress; each wore full-length robes with veils which concealed most of their faces. The patron was convinced to call police after looking closely at Smart&#x27;s eyes. A police detective arrived at the library and confronted Mitchell, Barzee, and Smart; however, he was deterred by Mitchell, who claimed that Smart was his daughter (named Augustine Marshall), and they were unable to remove their veils or garb on religious grounds. When questioned by the detective, neither Barzee nor Smart spoke, and Mitchell stated that their religion prohibited women from speaking in public. Smart would later say that Barzee signaled her not to move, and she gripped her legs under the table. She later recalled the incident: &quot;I felt like hope was walking out the door. I was mad at myself that I didn&#x27;t say anything, mad at myself for not taking the chance. So close. I felt terrible that the detective hadn&#x27;t pushed harder. He just walked away.&quot;

Smart also visited grocery stores and a restaurant but went unnoticed. In the fall of 2002, she attended a party with Mitchell and Barzee and was photographed wearing a veil and robe with Mitchell and another party guest.

===Move to San Diego===
In September 2002, Mitchell and Barzee left Salt Lake City with Smart, relocating to San Diego County, California, where they held Smart in an encampment in a dry creek bed in Lakeside. Mitchell and Barzee relocated with Smart several times to different encampments in San Diego County, often moving in the middle of the night. On February 12, 2003, Mitchell was arrested in El Cajon for breaking into a church and spent several days in jail over the incident.

==Discovery==
In October 2002, Smart&#x27;s sister Mary Katherine suddenly realized that the abductor&#x27;s voice was that of an unemployed man the family knew as Immanuel, whom the family had hired for a day to work on the roof and rake leaves.

The police were skeptical because of the short time &quot;Immanuel&quot; had worked for the family, the long time that elapsed, and the short time Mary Katherine had heard the abductor&#x27;s voice; however, the family had a sketch artist draw &quot;Immanuel&#x27;s&quot; face from their descriptions, and in February this drawing was released to the media; it was shown on &quot;Larry King Live&quot; and &quot;America&#x27;s Most Wanted&quot;. The drawing was recognized by relatives of Mitchell, who gave police contemporary photographs of him.

On March 12, 2003, Mitchell was spotted with a woman and a girl in Sandy, Utah, by two separate couples who had seen photos of Mitchell on the news. The woman was Wanda Barzee, and the girl was Elizabeth Smart—disguised in a gray wig, sunglasses, veil, and t-shirt wrapped around her head. Both couples reported their recognition of Mitchell to the Sandy Police Department, which immediately dispatched police officers to the location. When asked, Smart told the officers that her name was Augustine Marshall. However, she was recognized as Elizabeth Smart during questioning by the officers, who then rescued her and arrested Mitchell and Barzee. Even after Smart was separated from Mitchell and Barzee, she insisted her name was Augustine Marshall. Officer Karen Jones handcuffed Smart, according to regulations, and Sergeant Victor Quezada asked again, &quot;Are you Elizabeth?&quot; &quot;Thou sayest,&quot; Smart replied.

One month after the recovery of Elizabeth Smart, the state of Utah superseded the then-existing Rachael Alert with the nationwide AMBER alert child abduction alert system—in part to conform with recently implemented nationwide procedures. Although the Rachael Alert was superseded, this system had seen a success in the two years of its existence.

=== Aftermath ===
Smart was put in a car to be taken to a local police station. While in the car, she began to cry and asked, &#x27;What&#x27;s going to happen to them [Mitchell and Barzee]? Are they going to be okay?&quot; However, in her 2017 television film &quot;I Am Elizabeth Smart&quot;, she denied having Stockholm syndrome. She then arrived at the police station, where she was reunited with her family. Once she was back at home, she watched a film, read emails sent by well-wishers, played her harp, met her family&#x27;s two new dogs, and slept in the same bed Mitchell had taken her from. The next day, her family threw a party to make up for her 15th birthday, which had passed when Smart had still been in captivity. Though she didn&#x27;t attend, she sent a poster board to the party that read &quot;I am the luckiest girl in the world!&quot; That day, Smart painted her nails and opened birthday presents. The same day, she had her hair cut by a family friend.

Smart married Matthew Gilmour in February 2012, after meeting while on a Mormon mission in 2009. They have three children, a daughter born in February 2015, a son born in April 2017, and a daughter born in November 2018. As of 2023, the family lives in Wasatch County, Utah.

==Legal proceedings==
===Competency evaluations===
The court requested that Mitchell undergo a competency evaluation, based on his claims of being a religious prophet. While awaiting the evaluation, Mitchell was incarcerated at the Utah State Hospital. Stephen Golding, a psychologist hired by the defense, distinguished between zealous belief and delusion, and concluded that Mitchell&#x27;s beliefs transcended zeal and were in fact delusional. It was Golding&#x27;s opinion that Mitchell was not competent to stand trial as a result of his delusions. The court, however, overruled Golding&#x27;s opinion and found Mitchell to be competent in 2004. Plea negotiations subsequently began between the defense and the prosecution. The defendant was willing to plead guilty to kidnapping and burglary for a 10- to 15-year sentence on condition that Smart should not testify. The prosecution refused to drop sexual assault charges against Mitchell, and no agreement was reached.

On October 15, 2004, plea negotiations had still not determined an agreement. The defense appealed as late as October 21, asking the prosecution to rethink their position in terms of what they were offering Mitchell. Up until this point the defense did not highlight breakdown in competence as a contributing factor to the deterioration of plea negotiations; they cited the lack of a coming to an agreement as being the result of the sole discretion of their client. The appeal was subsequently rejected.

Jennifer Skeem, a psychologist who initially stated that Mitchell was competent, interviewed Mitchell again per the defense&#x27;s request in February 2005. After this interview, Heidi Buchi, Mitchell&#x27;s attorney, filed a brief stating that Mitchell was no longer competent to stand trial. Mitchell subsequently began to act out in court, while jail staff observed no change in his behavior and thought process. Ultimately, Judge Judy Atherton agreed with the defense, asserting that Mitchell&#x27;s behavior reflected psychosis. The defendant re-entered Utah State hospital on August 11, 2005, and remained there until 2008. While he was in the hospital, no staff members observed Mitchell being paranoid in a pathological sense.

In February 2006, a bill went before the Utah legislature to allow prosecutors to apply for forcible medication on defendants to restore their competence to face trial. Permission to forcibly medicate Wanda Barzee was also sought, relying upon the U.S. Supreme Court&#x27;s decision in &quot;Sell v. United States&quot; (2003), which permits compulsory medication when the state can demonstrate a compelling interest is served by restoring a person&#x27;s competence and that medication would not harm the person or prevent them from defending themself. In June 2006, a Utah judge approved the forcible medication of Barzee so that she could stand trial.

On December 18, 2006, Mitchell was again declared unfit to stand trial in the Utah state courts after screaming at a judge during a hearing to &quot;forsake those robes and kneel in the dust.&quot; Doctors had been trying to treat Mitchell without drugs, but prosecutor Kent Morgan said after the scene in court that a request was likely to be made for permission to forcibly administer drugs. On December 12, 2008, it was reported that Mitchell could not legally be forcibly medicated by the State of Utah to attempt to restore his mental competency, also claiming that it is &quot;unnecessary and needlessly harsh,&quot; and therefore a violation of the Utah state constitution, to prolong trial proceedings to this length.

The case was eventually transferred to Federal court on October 10, 2008. Issues of competency proved to be the crux of the case, and the court held an evidentiary hearing on Mitchell&#x27;s competency on October 1, 2009, and November 30 through December 11, 2009. On one occasion during a hearing in October, it was reported that Mitchell burst out singing hymns in court. During one of these hearings, Smart described Mitchell as &quot;smart, articulate, evil, wicked, manipulative, sneaky, slimy, selfish, greedy, not spiritual, not religious, not close to God.&quot;

Competency evaluations conducted by Noel Gardner, Michael Welner and Richart DeMier were presented at the hearing. Gardner maintained that he believed Mitchell was fully aware of his actions and was attempting to deceive the court. Welner, another witness in the case, reviewed 210 sources and 57 separate interviews including Mitchell, his wife Wanda Barzee, his family, and Elizabeth Smart. The Court credited Welner with presenting a 206-page report. Welner opined that Mitchell was competent to stand trial, and diagnosed him with non-exclusive pedophilia, antisocial personality disorder, narcissistic personality disorder, malingering and alcohol abuse in a controlled environment. Welner believed that Mitchell was highly manipulative and used his religious expression as a way to coax people into overlooking his high function and dismissing him as delusional. Experts for the defense including Dr. DeMier, a clinical psychologist, did not dispute these diagnoses; they maintained he had a concurrent fixed delusional disorder, believing that Mitchell was mentally ill at the time of the crime, and this greatly impaired his judgment. Mitchell was deemed competent to stand trial on March 1, 2010.

===Prosecution and sentencing===
Wanda Barzee eventually pleaded guilty and was sentenced to concurrent terms of 15 years in state and federal prison. However, due to the delays and mental evaluations, it took Mitchell&#x27;s case almost eight years to come to court.

Mitchell&#x27;s trial began on November 8, 2010. The defense acknowledged that Mitchell was responsible for the crimes, but contended that he was legally insane at the time of the crime, and should therefore be found not guilty by reason of insanity. The insanity defense for Mitchell was rejected on December 11, 2010, when the jury found him guilty of kidnapping and transporting a minor across state lines with intent to engage in sexual activity. U.S. District Judge Dale A. Kimball sentenced Mitchell to life in prison without the possibility of parole. Mitchell is currently serving his sentence at U.S. Penitentiary, Terre Haute, a high-security federal prison in Terre Haute, Indiana.

In 2016, Barzee&#x27;s federal imprisonment was terminated and she was transferred from the Federal Medical Center, Carswell in Fort Worth, Texas, to the Utah State Prison in Draper, Utah, to begin serving her state prison sentence. She was released in September 2018, which Smart protested.

==Media==
===Television interviews===
In October 2003, Elizabeth Smart and her parents were interviewed for a special segment of &quot;Dateline NBC.&quot; The interview, conducted by the &quot;Today&quot; show&#x27;s Katie Couric, featured Elizabeth&#x27;s first interview with any media outlet. Couric questioned Elizabeth&#x27;s parents about their experiences while Elizabeth was missing, including the Smarts&#x27; personal opinions concerning Elizabeth&#x27;s captors. Couric then interviewed Elizabeth about school and her life following her kidnapping.

Shortly after the &quot;Dateline&quot; interview, Elizabeth Smart and her family were featured on &quot;The Oprah Winfrey Show&quot;, where Winfrey questioned the Smarts about the kidnapping.

In July 2006, legal commentator and television personality Nancy Grace interviewed Elizabeth Smart, purportedly to talk about pending legislation on sex-offender registration, but repeatedly asked her for information about her experience. In response to the questioning, Elizabeth told Grace, &quot;I really am here to support the bill and not to go into what, you know, what happened to me.&quot; When Grace persisted, asking Elizabeth what it was like to see out of a niqab her abductors forced her to wear, Elizabeth stated: &quot;I&#x27;m really not going to talk about this at this time ... and to be frankly honest I really don&#x27;t appreciate you bringing all this up.&quot; Grace did not pursue further questioning about the abduction.

Smart discussed child abductions on the January 22, 2024, season premiere of the rebooted &quot;America&#x27;s Most Wanted&quot; with John Walsh and his son Callahan Walsh.

===Literature===
The Smart family published a book, &quot;Bringing Elizabeth Home&quot; (). Elizabeth&#x27;s uncle Tom Smart co-authored a book with &quot;Deseret News&quot; journalist Lee Benson, titled &quot;In Plain Sight: The Startling Truth Behind the Elizabeth Smart Investigation&quot; (), which criticized the investigation process by the Salt Lake City Police Department, as well as noting the media influences that led to her successful recovery.

===Film depictions===
The kidnapping was depicted in the 2003 television film &quot;The Elizabeth Smart Story&quot;, which was directed by Bobby Roth, and based on the book &quot;Bringing Elizabeth Home&quot;. It starred Amber Marshall as Elizabeth Smart, Dylan Baker and Lindsay Frost as her parents, and Tom Everett as Brian David Mitchell. It was nominated for three Young Artist Awards in 2004. The film first aired on CBS on November 9, 2003, eight months after Elizabeth was found.

In 2017 on the 15th anniversary of her abduction, Lifetime aired the made-for-TV film titled &quot;I Am Elizabeth Smart&quot;, narrated and produced by Smart, which tells the story of her kidnapping from her own perspective. The film starred Alana Boden as Elizabeth Smart, Skeet Ulrich as Brian David Mitchell, and Deirdre Lovejoy as Wanda Ileen Barzee. Also airing in 2017 is &quot;Elizabeth Smart: Autobiography&quot; from Biography, a two-hour telefilm.

<doc id="82981" wikidata="Q1618" url="?curid=82981" title="Charles Lindbergh">
<text>Charles Augustus Lindbergh (February 4, 1902 – August 26, 1974) was an American aviator, military officer, and author. On May 20–21, 1927, he made the first nonstop flight from New York to Paris, a distance of , flying alone for 33.5 hours. His aircraft, the &quot;Spirit of St. Louis&quot;, was built to compete for the $25,000 Orteig Prize for the first flight between the two cities. Although not the first transatlantic flight, it was the longest at the time by nearly , the first solo transatlantic flight, and set a new flight distance world record. The achievement garnered Lindbergh worldwide fame and stands as one of the most consequential flights in history, signalling a new era of air transportation between parts of the globe.

Lindbergh was raised mostly in Little Falls, Minnesota, and Washington, D.C., the son of U.S. Congressman Charles August Lindbergh. He became a U.S. Army Air Service cadet in 1924. The next year, he was hired as a U.S. Air Mail pilot in the Greater St. Louis area, where he began to prepare for crossing the Atlantic. For his 1927 flight, President Calvin Coolidge presented him both the Distinguished Flying Cross and Medal of Honor, the highest U.S. military award. He was promoted to colonel in the U.S. Army Air Corps Reserve and also earned the highest French order of merit, the Legion of Honor. His achievement spurred significant global interest in flight training, commercial aviation and air mail, which revolutionized the aviation industry worldwide (a phenomenon dubbed the &quot;Lindbergh Boom&quot;), and he spent much time promoting these industries.

&quot;Time&quot; magazine named Lindbergh its first Man of the Year for 1927, President Herbert Hoover appointed him to the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics in 1929, and he received the Congressional Gold Medal in 1930. In 1931, he and French surgeon Alexis Carrel began work on inventing the first perfusion pump, a device credited with making future heart surgeries and organ transplantation possible.

On March 1, 1932, Lindbergh&#x27;s first-born infant child, Charles Jr., was kidnapped and murdered in what the American media called the &quot;crime of the century&quot;. The case prompted the U.S. to establish kidnapping as a federal crime if a kidnapper crosses state lines with a victim. By late 1935, public hysteria from the case drove the Lindbergh family abroad to Europe, from where they returned in 1939. In the months before the United States entered World War II, Lindbergh&#x27;s non-interventionist stance and statements about Jews and race led some to believe he was a Nazi sympathizer, although Lindbergh never publicly stated support for the Nazis and condemned them several times in both his public speeches and personal diary. However, he supported the isolationist America First Committee and resigned from the U.S. Army Air Corps in April 1941 after President Franklin Roosevelt publicly rebuked him for his views. In September 1941, Lindbergh gave a significant address, titled &quot;Speech on Neutrality&quot;, outlining his position and arguments against greater American involvement in the war.

Following the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor and German declaration of war against the U.S., Lindbergh avidly supported the American war effort but was rejected for active duty, as Roosevelt refused to restore his colonel&#x27;s commission. Instead he flew 50 combat missions in the Pacific Theater as a civilian consultant and was unofficially credited with shooting down an enemy aircraft. In 1954, President Dwight Eisenhower restored his commission and promoted him to brigadier general in the U.S. Air Force Reserve. In his later years, he became a Pulitzer Prize-winning author, international explorer and environmentalist, helping to establish national parks in the U.S. and protect certain endangered species and tribal people in both the Philippines and east Africa. After retiring in Maui, Lindbergh died of lymphoma in 1974 at the age of 72.

==Early life==
===Early childhood===
Lindbergh was born in Detroit, Michigan, on , 1902, and spent most of his childhood in Little Falls, Minnesota, and Washington, D.C. He was the only child of Charles August Lindbergh (birth name Carl Månsson), who had emigrated from Sweden to Melrose, Minnesota, as an infant, and Evangeline Lodge Land Lindbergh of Detroit. Lindbergh had three elder paternal half-sisters: Lillian, Edith, and Eva. The couple separated in 1909 when Lindbergh was seven years old. 

His father, a U.S. Congressman from 1907 to 1917, was one of the few congressmen to oppose the entry of the U.S. into World War I (although his congressional term ended one month before the House of Representatives voted to declare war on Germany). Lindbergh&#x27;s mother was a chemistry teacher at Cass Technical High School in Detroit and later at Little Falls High School, from which her son graduated on , 1918. Lindbergh attended more than a dozen other schools from Washington, D.C., to California during his childhood and teenage years (none for more than two years), including the Force School and Sidwell Friends School while living in Washington with his father, and Redondo Union High School in Redondo Beach, California, while living there with his mother. Although he enrolled in the College of Engineering at the University of Wisconsin–Madison in late 1920, Lindbergh dropped out in the middle of his sophomore year.
===Early aviation career===
From an early age, Lindbergh had exhibited an interest in the mechanics of motorized transportation, including his family&#x27;s Saxon Six automobile, and later his Excelsior motorbike. By the time that he started college as a mechanical engineering student, he had also become fascinated with flying, though he &quot;had never been close enough to a plane to touch it&quot;. After quitting college in February 1922, Lindbergh enrolled at the Nebraska Aircraft Corporation&#x27;s flying school in Lincoln and flew for the first time on as a passenger in a two-seat Lincoln Standard &quot;Tourabout&quot; biplane trainer piloted by Otto Timm.

A few days later, Lindbergh took his first formal flying lesson in that same aircraft, though he was never permitted to solo because he could not afford to post the requisite damage bond. To gain flight experience and earn money for further instruction, Lindbergh left Lincoln in June to spend the next few months barnstorming across Nebraska, Kansas, Colorado, Wyoming, and Montana as a wing walker and parachutist. He also briefly worked as an airplane mechanic at the Billings, Montana, municipal airport.

Lindbergh left flying with the onset of winter and returned to his father&#x27;s home in Minnesota. His return to the air and his first solo flight did not come until half a year later in May 1923 at Souther Field in Americus, Georgia, a former Army flight-training field, where he bought a World War I surplus Curtiss JN-4 &quot;Jenny&quot; biplane for $500. Though Lindbergh had not touched an airplane in more than six months, he had already secretly decided that he was ready to take to the air by himself. After a half-hour of dual time with a pilot who was visiting the field, Lindbergh flew solo for the first time in the Jenny. After spending another week or so at the field to &quot;practice&quot; (thereby acquiring five hours of &quot;pilot in command&quot; time), Lindbergh took off from Americus for Montgomery, Alabama, some to the west, for his first solo cross-country flight. He went on to spend much of the remainder of 1923 engaged in almost nonstop barnstorming under the name &quot;Daredevil Lindbergh&quot;, this time flying in his &quot;own ship&quot; as the pilot. A few weeks after leaving Americus, he made his first night flight near Lake Village, Arkansas.

While Lindbergh was barnstorming in Lone Rock, Wisconsin, on two occasions he flew a local physician across the Wisconsin River to emergency calls that were otherwise unreachable because of flooding. He broke his propeller several times while landing, and on , 1923 he was grounded for a week when he ran into a ditch in Glencoe, Minnesota, while flying his father—then running for the U.S. Senate—to a campaign stop. In October, Lindbergh flew his Jenny to Iowa, where he sold it to a flying student. He returned to Lincoln by train, where he joined Leon Klink and continued to barnstorm through the South for the next few months in Klink&#x27;s Curtiss JN-4C &quot;Canuck&quot; (the Canadian version of the Jenny). Lindbergh also &quot;cracked up&quot; this aircraft once when his engine failed shortly after takeoff in Pensacola, Florida, but again he managed to repair the damage himself.

Following a few months of barnstorming through the South, the two pilots parted company in San Antonio, Texas, where Lindbergh reported to Brooks Field on , 1924 to begin a year of military flight training with the United States Army Air Service there (and later at nearby Kelly Field). Lindbergh had his most serious flying accident on , 1925, eight days before graduation, when a mid-air collision with another Army S.E.5 during aerial combat maneuvers forced him to bail out. Only 18 of the 104 cadets who started flight training a year earlier remained when Lindbergh graduated first overall in his class in March 1925, thereby earning his Army pilot&#x27;s wings and a commission as a second lieutenant in the Air Service Reserve Corps.

Lindbergh later said that this year was critical to his development as both a focused, goal-oriented individual and as an aviator. The Army did not need additional active-duty pilots, however, so following graduation, Lindbergh returned to civilian aviation as a barnstormer and flight instructor, although as a reserve officer he also continued to do some part-time military flying by joining the 110th Observation Squadron, 35th Division, Missouri National Guard, in St. Louis. He was promoted to first lieutenant on December 7, 1925, and to captain in July 1926.

===Air mail pilot===
In October 1925, Lindbergh was hired by the Robertson Aircraft Corporation (RAC) at the Lambert-St. Louis Flying Field in Anglum, Missouri, (where he had been working as a flight instructor) to lay out and then serve as chief pilot for the newly designated Contract Air Mail Route #2 (CAM-2) to provide service between St. Louis and Chicago (Maywood Field) with intermediate stops in Springfield and Peoria, Illinois. Lindbergh and three other RAC pilots flew the mail over CAM-2 in a fleet of four modified war-surplus de Havilland DH-4s.

On , 1926, Lindbergh executed the United States Post Office Department&#x27;s Oath of Mail Messengers, and two days later he opened service on the new route. On two occasions, combinations of bad weather, equipment failure, and fuel exhaustion forced him to bail out on night approach to Chicago; both times he reached the ground without serious injury. In mid-February 1927 he left for San Diego, California, to oversee design and construction of the &quot;Spirit of St. Louis&quot;.

==New YorkParis flight==
===Orteig Prize===
In 1919, British aviators John Alcock and Arthur Brown won the Daily Mail prize for the first nonstop transatlantic flight. They left St. John&#x27;s, Newfoundland, on , 1919, and arrived in Clifden, County Galway, Ireland the following day.

Around the same time, French-born New York hotelier Raymond Orteig was approached by Augustus Post, secretary of the Aero Club of America, to put up a $25,000
() award for the first successful nonstop transatlantic flight specifically between New York City and Paris within five years after its establishment. When that time limit lapsed in 1924 without a serious attempt, Orteig renewed the offer for another five years, this time attracting a number of well-known, highly experienced, and well-financed contenders—none of whom were successful. On , 1926, World WarI French flying ace René Fonck&#x27;s Sikorsky S-35 crashed on takeoff from Roosevelt Field in New York, killing crew members Jacob Islamoff and Charles Clavier. U.S. Naval aviators Noel Davis and Stanton H. Wooster were killed at Langley Field, Virginia, on , 1927, while testing their Keystone Pathfinder. On French war heroes Charles Nungesser and François Coli departed Paris – Le Bourget Airport in the Levasseur PL 8 seaplane &quot;L&#x27;Oiseau Blanc&quot;; they disappeared somewhere in the Atlantic after last being seen crossing the west coast of Ireland.

The specific event that inspired Lindbergh to attempt the flight was René Fonck&#x27;s September 1926 failure. Reading of Fonck&#x27;s crash, Lindbergh characteristically decided that &quot;a nonstop flight between New York and Paris would be less hazardous than flying mail for a single winter.&quot; He soon &quot;discussed his idea with St. Louis businessmen and aviation supporters&quot; and began to gather resources, making &quot;several inquiries&quot; with airplane manufacturers.

===&quot;Spirit of St. Louis&quot;===

Financing the historic flight was a challenge due to Lindbergh&#x27;s obscurity, but two St. Louis businessmen eventually obtained a $15,000 bank loan. Lindbergh contributed $2,000 () of his own money from his salary as an air mail pilot and another $1,000 was donated by RAC. The total of $18,000 was far less than what was available to Lindbergh&#x27;s rivals.

The group tried to buy an &quot;off-the-peg&quot; single or multiengine monoplane from Wright Aeronautical, then Travel Air, and finally the newly formed Columbia Aircraft Corporation, but all insisted on selecting the pilot as a condition of sale. Finally the much smaller Ryan Airline Company (later called the Ryan Aeronautical Company) of San Diego agreed to design and build a custom monoplane for $10,580, and on , 1927, a deal was formally closed. Dubbed the &quot;Spirit of St. Louis&quot;, the fabric-covered, single-seat, single-engine high-wing monoplane was designed jointly by Lindbergh and Ryan&#x27;s chief engineer Donald A. Hall. The &quot;Spirit&quot; flew for the first time just two months later, and after a series of test flights Lindbergh took off from San Diego on . He went first to St. Louis, then on to Roosevelt Field on New York&#x27;s Long Island.

===Flight===
In the early morning of Friday, , 1927, Lindbergh took off from Roosevelt Field on Long Island. His destination, Le Bourget Aerodrome, was about outside Paris and from his starting point. He was &quot;too busy the night before to lie down for more than a couple of hours,&quot; and &quot;had been unable [to] sleep.&quot; It rained the morning of his takeoff, but as the plane &quot;was wheeled into position on the runway,&quot; the rain ceased and light began to break through the &quot;low-hanging clouds.&quot; A crowd variously described as &quot;nearly a thousand&quot; or &quot;several thousand&quot; assembled to see Lindbergh off. For its transatlantic flight, the &quot;Spirit&quot; was loaded with of fuel that was filtered repeatedly to avoid fuel line blockage. The fuel load was a thousand pounds heavier than any the &quot;Spirit&quot; had lifted during a test flight, and the fully loaded airplane weighed . With takeoff hampered by a muddy, rain-soaked runway, the plane was &quot;helped by men pushing at the wing struts,&quot; with the last man leaving the wings only down the runway. The &quot;Spirit&quot; gained speed very slowly during its 7:52AM takeoff, but cleared telephone lines at the far end of the field &quot;by about with a fair reserve of flying speed&quot;.

At 8:52 AM, an hour after takeoff, Lindbergh was flying at an altitude of over Rhode Island, following an uneventful passageaside from some turbulenceover Long Island Sound and Connecticut. By 9:52 AM, he had passed Boston and was flying with Cape Cod to his right, with an airspeed of and altitude of ; about an hour later he began to feel tired, even though only a few hours had elapsed since takeoff. To keep his mind clear, Lindbergh descended and flew at only above the water&#x27;s surface. By around 11:52 AM, he had climbed to an altitude of , and at this point was distant from New York. Nova Scotia appeared ahead and, after flying over the Gulf of Maine, he was only &quot;, or 2 degrees, off course.&quot; At 3:52 PM, the eastern coast of Cape Breton Island was below; he struggled to stay awake, even though it was &quot;only the afternoon of the first day.&quot; At 5:52 PM, he was flying along the Newfoundland coast, and passed St. John&#x27;s at 7:15 PM. On its May 21 front page, &quot;The New York Times&quot; ran a special cable from the prior evening: &quot;Captain Lindbergh&#x27;s airplane passed over St. John&#x27;s at 8:15 o&#x27;clock tonight [7:15 New York Daylight Saving Time]...was seen by hundreds and disappeared seaward, heading for Ireland...It was flying quite low between the hills near St. John&#x27;s.&quot; The &quot;Times&quot; also observed that Lindbergh was &quot;following the track of Hawker and Greeve and also of Alcock and Brown&quot;.

Stars appeared as night fell around 8:00 PM. The sea became obscured by fog, prompting Lindbergh to climb &quot;from an altitude of to to stay above the quickly-rising cloud.&quot; An hour later, he was flying at . A towering thunderhead stood in front of him, and he flew into the cloud, but turned back after he noticed ice forming on the plane. While inside the cloud, Lindbergh &quot;thrust a bare hand through the cockpit window,&quot; and felt the &quot;sting of ice particles.&quot; After returning to open sky, he &quot;curved back to his course.&quot; At 11:52 PM, Lindbergh was in warmer air, and no ice remained on the &quot;Spirit&quot;; he was flying at , and was from Newfoundland. Eighteen hours into the flight, he was halfway to Paris, and while he had planned to celebrate at this point, he instead felt &quot;only dread.&quot; Because Lindbergh flew through several time zones, dawn came earlier, at around 2:52 AM. He began to hallucinate about two hours later. At this point in the flight, he &quot;continually&quot; fell asleep, awakening &quot;seconds, possibly minutes, later.&quot; But after &quot;flying for hours in or above the fog,&quot; the weather finally began to clear. 7:52 AM marked twenty-four hours in the air for Lindbergh and he did not feel as tired by this point.

At around 9:52 AM New York time, or twenty-seven hours after he left Roosevelt Field, Lindbergh saw &quot;porpoises and fishing boats,&quot; a sign he had reached the other side of the Atlantic. He circled and flew closely, but no fishermen appeared on the boat decks, although he did see a face watching from a porthole. Dingle Bay, in County Kerry of southwest Ireland, was the first European land that Lindbergh encountered; he veered to get a better look and consulted his charts, identifying it as the southern tip of Ireland. The local time in Ireland was 3:00 PM. Flying over Dingle Bay, the &quot;Spirit&quot; was &quot;2.5 hours ahead of schedule and less than off course.&quot; Lindbergh had navigated &quot;almost precisely to the coastal point he had marked on his chart.&quot; He wanted to reach the French coast in daylight, so increased his speed to . The English coast appeared ahead of him, and he was &quot;now wide awake.&quot; A report came from Plymouth, on the English coast, that Lindbergh&#x27;s plane had started across the English Channel. News soon spread across both &quot;Europe and the United States that Lindbergh had been spotted over England,&quot; and a crowd started to form at Le Bourget Aerodrome as he neared Paris. At sunset, he flew over Cherbourg, on the French coast from Paris; it was around 2:52 PM New York time.

Over the hours of the flight, the aircraft fought icing, flew blind through fog for several hours, and Lindbergh navigated only by dead reckoning (he was not proficient at navigating by the sun and stars and he rejected radio navigation gear as heavy and unreliable). He was fortunate that the winds over the Atlantic cancelled each other out, giving him zero wind drift—and thus accurate navigation during the long flight over featureless ocean.

On arriving at Paris, Lindbergh &quot;circled the Eiffel Tower&quot; before flying to the airfield. He flew over the crowd at Le Bourget Aerodrome at 10:16 and landed at 10:22 PM on Saturday, , on the far side of the field and &quot;nearly half a mile from the crowd,&quot; as reported by &quot;The New York Times&quot;. The airfield was not marked on his map and Lindbergh knew only that it was some seven miles northeast of the city; he initially mistook it for some large industrial complex because of the bright lights spreading out in all directionsin fact the headlights of tens of thousands of spectators&#x27; cars caught in &quot;the largest traffic jam in Paris history&quot; in their attempt to be present for Lindbergh&#x27;s landing.

A crowd estimated at 150,000 stormed the field, dragged Lindbergh out of the cockpit, and carried him around above their heads for &quot;nearly half an hour.&quot; Some minor damage was done to the &quot;Spirit&quot; by souvenir hunters before pilot and plane reached the safety of a nearby hangar with the aid of French military fliers, soldiers, and police. The &quot;Times&quot; reported that before the police could intervene the &quot;souvenir mad&quot; spectators &quot;stripped the plane of everything which could be taken off,&quot; and were cutting off pieces of linen when &quot;a squad of soldiers with fixed bayonets quickly surrounded&quot; the plane, providing guard as it was &quot;wheeled into a shed.&quot; Lindbergh met the U.S. Ambassador to France, Myron T. Herrick, across Le Bourget field in a &quot;little room with a few chairs and an army cot.&quot; The lights in the room were turned off to conceal his presence from the frenzied crowd, which &quot;surged madly&quot; trying to find him. Lindbergh shook hands with Herrick and handed him several letters he had carried across the Atlantic, three of which were from Col. Theodore Roosevelt Jr., son of former President Theodore Roosevelt, who had written letters of introduction at Lindbergh&#x27;s request. Lindbergh left the airfield around midnight and was driven through Paris to the ambassador&#x27;s residence, stopping to visit the French Tomb of the Unknown Soldier at the Arc de Triomphe; after arriving at the residence, he slept for the first time in about 60 hours.

Lindbergh&#x27;s flight was certified by the National Aeronautic Association of the United States based on the readings from a sealed barograph placed in the &quot;Spirit&quot;.

==Global fame==
Lindbergh received unprecedented acclaim after his historic flight. In the words of biographer A. Scott Berg, people were &quot;behaving as though Lindbergh had walked on water, not flown over it&quot;. &quot;The New York Times&quot; printed an above the fold, page-wide headline: &quot;Lindbergh Does It!&quot; and his mother&#x27;s house in Detroit was surrounded by a crowd reported at nearly a thousand. He became &quot;an international celebrity, with invitations pouring in for him to visit European countries,&quot; and he &quot;received marriage proposals, invitations to visit cities across the nation, and thousands of gifts, letters, and endorsement requests.&quot; At least &quot;200 songs were written&quot; in tribute to him and his flight. &quot;Lucky Lindy!&quot;, written and composed by L. Wolfe Gilbert and Abel Baer, was finished on May 21 itself, and was &quot;performed to great acclaim in several Manhattan clubs&quot; that night. After landing, Lindbergh was eager to embark on a tour of Europe. As he noted in a speech a few weeks afterward, his flight marked the first time he &quot;had ever been abroad,&quot; and he &quot;landed with the expectancy, and the hope, of being able to see Europe.&quot;

The morning after landing, Lindbergh appeared in the balcony of the U.S. embassy, responding &quot;briefly and modestly&quot; to the calls of the crowd. The French Foreign Office flew the American flag, the first time it had saluted someone who was not a head of state. At the Élysée Palace, French President Gaston Doumergue bestowed the Légion d&#x27;honneur on Lindbergh, pinning the award on his lapel, with Ambassador Herrick present for the occasion. Lindbergh also made flights to Belgium and Britain in the &quot;Spirit&quot; before returning to the United States. On May 28, Lindbergh flew to Evere Aerodrome in Brussels, Belgium, circling the field three times for the cheering crowd and taxiing to a halt just after 3:00 PM, as a thousand children waved American flags. On his way to Evere, Lindbergh had met an escort of ten planes from the airport, who found him on course near Mons but had trouble keeping up as the &quot;Spirit&quot; was averaging &quot;about 100 miles an hour.&quot; After landing, Lindbergh was welcomed by military officers and prominent officials, including Belgian Prime Minister Henri Jaspar, who led the procession of Lindbergh&#x27;s plane to a &quot;platform where it was raised to the view of cheering thousands.&quot; &quot;It was a splendid flight,&quot; Lindbergh declared, stating: &quot;I enjoyed every minute of it. The motor is in fine shape and I could circle Europe without touching it.&quot; Belgian troops with fixed bayonets protected the &quot;Spirit&quot; to avoid a repeat of the damage at Le Bourget. From Evere, Lindbergh motored to the U.S. embassy, and then went to place a wreath on the Belgian tomb of the unknown soldier. He then visited the Belgian royal palace at the invitation of King Albert I, where the king made Lindbergh a Knight of the Order of Leopold; as Lindbergh shook the king&#x27;s hand, he said: &quot;I have heard much of the famous soldier-king of the Belgians.&quot; The United Press reported that &quot;One million persons are in Brussels today to greet Lindbergh,&quot; constituting &quot;the greatest welcome ever accorded a private citizen in Belgium.&quot;

After Belgium, Lindbergh traveled to the United Kingdom. He departed Brussels and arrived at Croydon Air Field in the &quot;Spirit&quot; on May 29, where a crowd of 100,000 &quot;mobbed&quot; him. Before reaching the airfield he overflew London where crowds, some on roofs, &quot;gazed at the flyer&quot; and observers with &quot;field glasses in the West End business district&quot; watched him. About 50 minutes before he landed, the &quot;roads leading toward Croydon airport were jammed.&quot; Flying into the airfield, Lindbergh &quot;appeared on the horizon&quot; at 5:50 PM accompanied by six British military planes, but the massive crowd &quot;swept over the guard lines&quot; and forced him to circle the airfield &quot;while police battled the crowd,&quot; and &quot;not until 10 minutes later had they cleared a space large enough&quot; for him to land. Police reserves were sent to the airfield in &quot;large numbers,&quot; but it was not enough to contain the multitude. As the plane came to a stop, the crowd &quot;waved American flags, smashed fences and knocked down police,&quot; while Lindbergh himself was described as &quot;grinning and serene&quot; amid the &quot;seething&quot; crowd. The United Press reported that a &quot;man&#x27;s leg was broken in the crush,&quot; and another man fell from atop a hangar and suffered internal injuries. English officials were reportedly &quot;surprised&quot; by the enthusiasm of the welcome. A limousine pulled near the &quot;Spirit&quot;, escorting Lindbergh to a tower on the field where he responded to the cheering crowd. &quot;All I can say is that this is worse than what happened at Le Bourget Field,&quot; he told them. &quot;But all the same, I&#x27;m glad to be here.&quot; When he reached the reception room where British Secretary of State for Air Sir Samuel Hoare, U.S. Ambassador Alanson B. Houghton, and others waited, his first words were: &quot;Save my plane!&quot; Mechanics moved the &quot;Spirit&quot; to a hangar where it was placed &quot;under a military guard.&quot; Also present at Croydon were former Secretary of State for Air Lord Thomson, Director of Civil Aviation Sir Sefton Brancker, and Brig. Gen. P. R. C. Groves.

Accompanied by two Royal Air Force planes, he then flew 90 miles from Croydon to Gosport, where he left the &quot;Spirit&quot; to be dismantled for shipment back to New York. On May 31, accompanied by an attache of the U.S. Embassy, Lindbergh visited British Prime Minister Stanley Baldwin at 10 Downing Street and then motored to Buckingham Palace, where King George V received him as a guest and awarded him the British Air Force Cross. In anticipation of Lindbergh&#x27;s visit to the palace, a crowd massed &quot;hoping to get a glimpse&quot; of him. The crowd became so great that police had to call in reserves from Scotland Yard. Upon his arrival back in the United States aboard the U.S. Navy cruiser on , 1927, a fleet of warships and multiple flights of military aircraft escorted him up the Potomac River to the Washington Navy Yard, where President Calvin Coolidge awarded him the Distinguished Flying Cross. Lindbergh received the first award of this medal, but it violated the authorizing regulation. Coolidge&#x27;s own executive order, published in March 1927, required recipients to perform their feats of airmanship &quot;while participating in an aerial flight as part of the duties incident to such membership [in the Organized Reserves]&quot;, which Lindbergh failed to satisfy.

Lindbergh flew from Washington, D.C., to New York City on , arriving in Lower Manhattan. He traveled up the Canyon of Heroes to City Hall, where he was received by Mayor Jimmy Walker. A ticker-tape parade followed to Central Park Mall, where he was awarded the New York Medal for Valor at a ceremony hosted by New York Governor Al Smith and attended by a crowd of 200,000. Some 4,000,000 people saw Lindbergh that day. That evening, Lindbergh was accompanied by his mother and Mayor Walker when he was the guest of honor at a 500-guest banquet and dance held at Clarence MacKay&#x27;s Long Island estate, Harbor Hill.
The following night, Lindbergh was honored with a grand banquet at the Hotel Commodore given by the Mayor&#x27;s Committee on Receptions of the City of New York and attended by some 3,700 people. He was officially awarded the check for the prize on .

On July 18, 1927, Lindbergh was promoted to the rank of colonel in the Air Corps of the Officers Reserve Corps of the U.S. Army.

On , 1927, a Special Act of Congress awarded Lindbergh the Medal of Honor, despite the fact that it was almost always awarded for heroism in combat. It was presented to Lindbergh by President Coolidge at the White House on , 1928. The medal contradicted Coolidge&#x27;s earlier executive order directing that &quot;not more than one of the several decorations authorized by Federal law will be awarded for the same act of heroism or extraordinary achievement&quot; (Lindbergh was recognized for the same act with both the Medal of Honor and the Distinguished Flying Cross). The statute authorizing the award was also criticized for apparently violating procedure; House legislators reportedly neglected to have their votes counted.

Lindbergh was honored as the first &quot;Time&quot; magazine Man of the Year (now called &quot;Person of the Year&quot;) when he appeared on that magazine&#x27;s cover at age 25 on , 1928; he remained the youngest &quot;Time&quot; Person of the Year until Greta Thunberg in 2019. The winner of the 1930 Best Woman Aviator of the Year Award, Elinor Smith Sullivan, said that before Lindbergh&#x27;s flight:

===Autobiography and tours===
Barely two months after Lindbergh arrived in Paris, G. P. Putnam&#x27;s Sons published his 318-page autobiography &quot;WE&quot;, which was the first of 15 books he eventually wrote or to which he made significant contributions. The company was run by aviation enthusiast George P. Putnam.
The dustjacket notes said that Lindbergh wanted to share the &quot;story of his life and his transatlantic flight together with his views on the future of aviation&quot;, and that &quot;WE&quot; referred to the &quot;spiritual partnership&quot; that had developed &quot;between himself and his airplane during the dark hours of his flight&quot;. However, as Berg wrote in 1998, Putnam&#x27;s chose the title without &quot;Lindbergh&#x27;s knowledge or approval,&quot; and Lindbergh would &quot;forever complain about it, that his use of &#x27;we&#x27; meant him and his backers, not him and his plane, as the press had people believing&quot;; nonetheless, as Berg remarked, &quot;his frequent unconscious use of the phrase suggested otherwise.&quot;

Putnam&#x27;s sold special autographed copies of the book for $25 each, all of which were purchased before publication. &quot;WE&quot; was soon translated into most major languages and sold more than 650,000 copies in the first year, earning Lindbergh more than $250,000. Its success was considerably aided by Lindbergh&#x27;s three-month, tour of the United States in the &quot;Spirit&quot; on behalf of the Daniel Guggenheim Fund for the Promotion of Aeronautics. Between and , 1927, Lindbergh visited 82 cities in all 48 states, rode in parades, and delivered 147 speeches before 30 million people.

Lindbergh then toured 16 Latin American countries between , 1927, and , 1928. Dubbed the &quot;Good Will Tour&quot;, it included stops in Mexico (where he also met his future wife, Anne, the daughter of U.S. Ambassador Dwight Morrow), Guatemala, British Honduras, El Salvador, Honduras, Nicaragua, Costa Rica, Panama, the Canal Zone, Colombia, Venezuela, St. Thomas, Puerto Rico, the Dominican Republic, Haiti, and Cuba, covering in just over 116 hours of flight time. A year and two days after it had made its first flight, Lindbergh flew the &quot;Spirit&quot; from St. Louis to Washington, D.C., where it has been on public display at the Smithsonian Institution ever since. Over the previous 367 days, Lindbergh and the &quot;Spirit&quot; had logged 489 hours 28 minutes of flight time.

A &quot;Lindbergh boom&quot; in aviation had begun. The volume of mail moving by air increased 50 percent within six months, applications for pilots&#x27; licenses tripled, and the number of planes quadrupled.
President Herbert Hoover appointed Lindbergh to the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics.

Lindbergh and Pan American World Airways head Juan Trippe were interested in developing an air route across Alaska and Siberia to China and Japan. In the summer of 1931, with Trippe&#x27;s support, Lindbergh and his wife flew from Long Island to Nome, Alaska, and from there to Siberia, Japan and China. The flight was carried out with a Lockheed Model 8 Sirius named Tingmissartoq. The route was not available for commercial service until after World WarII, as prewar aircraft lacked the range to fly Alaska to Japan nonstop, and the United States had not officially recognized the Soviet government. In China they volunteered to help in disaster investigation and relief efforts for the Central China flood of 1931. This was later documented in Anne&#x27;s book &quot;North to the Orient&quot;.

===Air mail promotion===
Lindbergh used his world fame to promote air mail service. For example, at the request of Basil L. Rowe, the owner of West Indian Aerial Express (and later Pan Am&#x27;s chief pilot), in February, 1928, he carried some 3,000 pieces of special souvenir mail between Santo Domingo, Dominican Repulic; Port-au-Prince, Haiti; and Havana, Cubathe last three stops he and the &quot;Spirit&quot; made during their &quot;Good Will Tour&quot; of Latin America and the Caribbean between , 1927, and , 1928, and the only franked mail pieces that he ever flew in his iconic plane.

Two weeks after his Latin American tour, Lindbergh piloted a series of special flights over his old CAM-2 route on and . Tens of thousands of self-addressed souvenir covers were sent in from all over the world, so at each stop Lindbergh switched to another of the three planes he and his fellow CAM-2 pilots had used, so it could be said that each cover had been flown by him. The covers were then backstamped and returned to their senders as a promotion of the air mail service.
In 1929–1931, Lindbergh carried much smaller numbers of souvenir covers on the first flights over routes in Latin America and the Caribbean, which he had earlier laid out as a consultant to Pan American Airways to be then flown under contract to the Post Office as Foreign Air Mail (FAM) routes 5 and 6.

On 10 March 1929, Lindbergh flew an inaugural flight from Brownsville, Texas, to Mexico City via Tampico, in a Ford Trimotor airplane, carrying a load of U.S. mail. When a number of mail bags came up missing for a period of one month, they subsequently came to be known in the philatelic world as the covers of the &quot;Lost Mail Flight&quot;. The historic flight was received with much notoriety in the press and marked the beginning of extended airmail service between the United States and Mexico.

==Personal life==
===American family===

In his autobiography, Lindbergh derided pilots he met as womanizing &quot;barnstormers&quot;; he also criticized Army cadets for their &quot;facile&quot; approach to relationships. He wrote that the ideal romance was stable and long-term, with a woman with keen intellect, good health, and strong genes, his &quot;experience in breeding animals on our farm [having taught him] the importance of good heredity&quot;.

Anne Morrow Lindbergh was the daughter of Dwight Morrow, who, as a partner at J.P. Morgan &amp; Co., had acted as financial adviser to Lindbergh. He was also the U.S. Ambassador to Mexico in 1927. Invited by Morrow on a goodwill tour to Mexico along with humorist and actor Will Rogers, Lindbergh met Anne in Mexico City in December 1927.

The couple was married on , 1929, at the Morrow estate in Englewood, New Jersey, where they resided after their marriage before moving to the western part of the state. They had six children: Charles Augustus Lindbergh Jr. (1930–1932); Jon Morrow Lindbergh (1932–2021); Land Morrow Lindbergh (b. 1937), who studied anthropology at Stanford University; Anne Lindbergh (1940–1993); Scott Lindbergh (b. 1942); and Reeve Lindbergh (b. 1945), a writer. Lindbergh taught Anne how to fly, and she accompanied and assisted him in much of his exploring and charting of air routes.

Lindbergh saw his children for only a few months a year. He kept track of each child&#x27;s infractions (including such things as gum-chewing) and insisted that Anne track every penny of household expenses.

Lindbergh&#x27;s grandson, aviator Erik Lindbergh, has had notable involvement in both the private spaceflight and electric aircraft industries.

===Glider hobby===
Lindbergh came to the Monterey Peninsula with his wife in March 1930 to continue innovations in the design and use of gliders. He stayed at Del Monte Lodge in Pebble Beach, to search for sites for launching gliders. He came to the Palo Corona Ranch in Carmel Valley, California, and stayed there as guests at the Sidney Fish home, where he flew a glider from a ridge at the ranch. Eight men towed the glider to the ridge where he soared over the countryside for 10 minutes and brought the plane down 3 miles below the Highlands Inn. Other flights lasted 70 minutes. In 1930, his wife became the first woman to receive a U.S. glider pilot license.

===Kidnapping of Charles Lindbergh Jr.===

On the evening of , 1932, twenty-month-old Charles Augustus Lindbergh Jr. was abducted from his crib in the Lindberghs&#x27; rural home, Highfields, in East Amwell, New Jersey, near the town of Hopewell. A man who claimed to be the kidnapper picked up a cash ransom of $50,000 on , part of which was in gold certificates, which were soon to be withdrawn from circulation and would therefore attract attention; the bills&#x27; serial numbers were also recorded. On , the child&#x27;s remains were found in woods not far from the Lindbergh home.

The case was widely called the &quot;Crime of the Century&quot; and was described by H. L. Mencken as &quot;the biggest story since the Resurrection&quot;. In response, Congress passed the so-called &quot;Lindbergh Law&quot;, which made kidnapping a federal offense if the victim is taken across state lines or (as in the Lindbergh case) the kidnapper uses &quot;the mail or... interstate or foreign commerce in committing or in furtherance of the commission of the offense&quot;, such as in demanding ransom.

Richard Hauptmann, a 34-year-old German immigrant carpenter, was arrested near his home in the Bronx, New York, on , 1934, after paying for gasoline with one of the ransom bills. $13,760 of the ransom money and other evidence was found in his home. Hauptmann went on trial for kidnapping, murder and extortion on , 1935, in a circus-like atmosphere in Flemington, New Jersey. He was convicted on , sentenced to death, and electrocuted at Trenton State Prison on , 1936. His guilt is contested.
===In Europe (19361939)===
An intensely private man, Lindbergh became exasperated by the unrelenting public attention in the wake of the kidnapping and trial, and was concerned for the safety of his three-year-old second son, Jon. In the predawn hours of Sunday, , 1935, the family &quot;sailed furtively&quot; from Manhattan for Liverpool, the only three passengers aboard the United States Lines freighter SS &quot;American Importer&quot;. They traveled under assumed names and with diplomatic passports issued through the personal intervention of former U.S. Treasury Secretary Ogden L. Mills.

News of the Lindberghs&#x27; &quot;flight to Europe&quot; did not become public until a full day later, and even after the identity of their ship became known radiograms addressed to Lindbergh on it were returned as &quot;Addressee not aboard&quot;.
They arrived in Liverpool on , then departed for South Wales to stay with relatives.

The family eventually rented &quot;Long Barn&quot; in Sevenoaks Weald, Kent. In 1938, the family (including a third son, Land, born May 1937 in London) moved to Île Illiec, a small island Lindbergh purchased off the Breton coast of France.

Except for a brief visit to the U.S. in December 1937, the Lindberghs lived and traveled extensively around Europe in their personal Miles M.12 Mohawk two person airplane, before returning to the U.S. in April 1939 and settling in a rented seaside estate at Lloyd Neck, Long Island, New York. The return was prompted by a personal request by General H. H. (&quot;Hap&quot;) Arnold, the chief of the United States Army Air Corps in which Lindbergh was a reserve colonel, for him to accept a temporary return to active duty to help evaluate the Air Corps&#x27;s readiness for war. His duties included evaluating new aircraft types in development, recruitment procedures, and finding a site for a new air force research institute and other potential air bases. Assigned a Curtiss P-36 fighter, he toured various facilities, reporting back to Wilbur Wright Field. Lindbergh&#x27;s brief four-month tour was also his first period of active military service since his graduation from the Army&#x27;s Flight School fourteen years earlier in 1925.

==Scientific activities==
Lindbergh wrote to the Longines watch company and described a watch that would make navigation easier for pilots. First produced in 1931, they called it the &quot;Lindbergh Hour Angle watch&quot;, and it remains in production today.

In 1929, Lindbergh became interested in the work of rocket pioneer Robert H. Goddard. By helping Goddard secure an endowment from Daniel Guggenheim in 1930, Lindbergh allowed Goddard to expand his research and development. Throughout his life, Lindbergh remained a key advocate of Goddard&#x27;s work.
In 1930, Lindbergh&#x27;s sister-in-law developed a fatal heart condition. Lindbergh began to wonder why hearts could not be repaired with surgery. Starting in early 1931 at the Rockefeller Institute and continuing during his time living in France, Lindbergh studied the perfusion of organs outside the body with Nobel Prize-winning French surgeon Alexis Carrel. Although perfused organs were said to have survived surprisingly well, all showed progressive degenerative changes within a few days. Lindbergh&#x27;s invention, a glass perfusion pump, named the &quot;Model T&quot; pump, is credited with making future heart surgeries possible. In this early stage, the pump was far from perfected. In 1938, Lindbergh and Carrel described an artificial heart in the book in which they summarized their work, &quot;The Culture of Organs&quot;, but it was decades before one was built. In later years, Lindbergh&#x27;s pump was further developed by others, eventually leading to the construction of the first heart-lung machine.

==Pre-war activities and politics==
===Overseas visits===
In July 1936, shortly before the opening of the 1936 Summer Olympics in Berlin, American journalist William L. Shirer recorded in his diary: &quot;The Lindberghs are here [in Berlin], and the Nazis, led by Göring, are making a great play for them.&quot;

This 1936 visit was the first of several that Lindbergh made at the request of the U.S. military establishment between 1936 and 1938, with the goal of evaluating German aviation. During this visit, the Lufthansa airline held a tea for the Lindberghs, and later invited them for a ride aboard the massive four-engine Junkers G.38 that had been christened &quot;Field-Marshal Von Hindenburg&quot;. Shirer, who was on the flight, wrote:

Hanna Reitsch demonstrated the Focke-Wulf Fw 61 helicopter to Lindbergh in 1937, and he was the first American to examine Germany&#x27;s newest bomber, the Junkers Ju 88, and Germany&#x27;s front-line fighter aircraft, the Messerschmitt Bf 109, which he was allowed to pilot. He said of the Bf 109 that he knew of &quot;no other pursuit plane which combines simplicity of construction with such excellent performance characteristics&quot;.

There is disagreement on how accurate Lindbergh&#x27;s reports were, but Cole asserts that the consensus among British and American officials was that they were slightly exaggerated but badly needed. Arthur Krock, the chief of &quot;The New York Times&quot; Washington Bureau, wrote in 1939, &quot;When the new flying fleet of the United States begins to take air, among those who will have been responsible for its size, its modernness, and its efficiency is Colonel Charles A. Lindbergh. Informed officials here, in touch with what Colonel Lindbergh has been doing for his country abroad, are authority for this statement, and for the further observation that criticism of any of his activities – in Germany or elsewhere – is as ignorant as it is unfair.&quot; General Henry H. Arnold, the only U.S. Air Force general to hold five-star rank, wrote in his autobiography, &quot;Nobody gave us much useful information about Hitler&#x27;s air force until Lindbergh came home in 1939.&quot; Lindbergh also undertook a survey of aviation in the Soviet Union in 1938.

In 1938, Hugh Wilson, the American ambassador to Germany, hosted a dinner for Lindbergh with Germany&#x27;s air chief, &quot;Generalfeldmarschall&quot; Hermann Göring, and three central figures in German aviation: Ernst Heinkel, Adolf Baeumker, and Willy Messerschmitt. At this dinner, Göring presented Lindbergh with the Commander Cross of the Order of the German Eagle. Lindbergh&#x27;s acceptance became controversial when, only a few weeks after this visit, the Nazi Party carried out the &quot;Kristallnacht&quot;, a nation-wide anti-Jewish pogrom which is considered a key inaugurating event of the Holocaust. Lindbergh declined to return the medal, later writing: It seems to me that the returning of decorations, which were given in times of peace and as a gesture of friendship, can have no constructive effect. If I were to return the German medal, it seems to me that it would be an unnecessary insult. Even if war develops between us, I can see no gain in indulging in a spitting contest before that war begins. Ambassador Wilson later wrote to Lindbergh: Neither you, nor I, nor any other American present had any previous hint that the presentation would be made. I have always felt that if you refused the decoration, presented under those circumstances, you would have been guilty of a breach of good taste. It would have been an act offensive to a guest of the Ambassador of your country, in the house of the Ambassador.

Lindbergh&#x27;s reaction to the &quot;Kristallnacht&quot; was entrusted to his diary: &quot;I do not understand these riots on the part of the Germans&quot;, he wrote. &quot;It seems so contrary to their sense of order and intelligence. They have undoubtedly had a difficult &#x27;Jewish problem&#x27;, but why is it necessary to handle it so unreasonably?&quot;
Lindbergh had planned to move to Berlin for the winter of 1938–39. He had provisionally found a house in Wannsee, but after Nazi friends discouraged him from leasing it because it had been formerly owned by Jews, it was recommended that he contact Albert Speer, who said he would build the Lindberghs a house anywhere they wanted. On the advice of his close friend Alexis Carrel, he cancelled the trip.

===Isolationism and America First Committee===
In 1938, the U.S. Air Attaché in Berlin invited Lindbergh to inspect the rising power of Nazi Germany&#x27;s Air Force. Impressed by German technology and the apparently large number of aircraft at their disposal and influenced by the staggering number of deaths from World War I, he opposed U.S. entry into the impending European conflict. In September 1938, he stated to the French cabinet that the &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; possessed 8,000 aircraft and could produce 1,500 per month. Although this was seven times the actual number determined by the &quot;Deuxième Bureau&quot;, it influenced France into trying to avoid conflict with Nazi Germany through the Munich Agreement. At the urging of U.S. Ambassador Joseph Kennedy, Lindbergh wrote a secret memo to the British warning that a military response by Britain and France to Hitler&#x27;s violation of the Munich Agreement would be disastrous; he claimed that France was militarily weak and Britain over-reliant on its navy. He urgently recommended that they strengthen their air power to force Hitler to redirect his aggression against &quot;Asiatic Communism&quot;.

Following Hitler&#x27;s invasion of Czechoslovakia and Poland, Lindbergh opposed sending aid to countries under threat, writing &quot;I do not believe that repealing the arms embargo would assist democracy in Europe&quot; and &quot;If we repeal the arms embargo with the idea of assisting one of the warring sides to overcome the other, then why mislead ourselves by talk of neutrality?&quot; He equated assistance with war profiteering: &quot;To those who argue that we could make a profit and build up our own industry by selling munitions abroad, I reply that we in America have not yet reached a point where we wish to capitalize on the destruction and death of war&quot;.

In August 1939, Lindbergh was the first choice of Albert Einstein, whom he met years earlier in New York, to deliver the Einstein–Szilárd letter alerting President Roosevelt about the vast potential of nuclear fission. However, Lindbergh did not respond to Einstein&#x27;s letter or to Szilard&#x27;s later letter of September 13. Two days later, Lindbergh gave a nationwide radio address, in which he called for isolationism and indicated some pro-German sympathies and antisemitic insinuations about Jewish ownership of the media, saying &quot;We must ask who owns and influences the newspaper, the news picture, and the radio station, ... If our people know the truth, our country is not likely to enter the war&quot;. After that, Szilard stated to Einstein: &quot;Lindbergh is not our man.&quot;

In October 1939, following the outbreak of hostilities between Britain and Germany, and a month after the Canadian declaration of war on Germany, Lindbergh made another nationwide radio address criticizing Canada for drawing the Western Hemisphere &quot;into a European war simply because they prefer the Crown of England&quot; to the independence of the Americas. Lindbergh further stated his opinion that the entire continent and its surrounding islands needed to be free from the &quot;dictates of European powers&quot;.

In November 1939, Lindbergh authored a controversial &quot;Reader&#x27;s Digest&quot; article in which he deplored the war, but asserted the need for a German assault on the Soviet Union. Lindbergh wrote: &quot;Our civilization depends on peace among Western nations ... and therefore on united strength, for Peace is a virgin who dare not show her face without Strength, her father, for protection&quot;.

In late 1940, Lindbergh became the spokesman of the isolationist America First Committee, soon speaking to overflow crowds at Madison Square Garden and Chicago&#x27;s Soldier Field, with millions listening by radio. He argued emphatically that America had no business attacking Germany. Lindbergh justified this stance in writings that were only published posthumously:

In April 1941, he argued before 30,000 members of the America First Committee that &quot;the British government has one last desperate plan ... to persuade us to send another American Expeditionary Force to Europe and to share with England militarily, as well as financially, the fiasco of this war.&quot;

In his 1941 testimony before the House Committee on Foreign Affairs opposing the Lend-Lease bill, Lindbergh proposed that the United States negotiate a neutrality pact with Germany. President Franklin Roosevelt publicly decried Lindbergh&#x27;s views as those of a &quot;defeatist and appeaser&quot;, comparing him to U.S. Rep. Clement L. Vallandigham, who had led the &quot;Copperhead&quot; movement opposed to the American Civil War. Following this, Lindbergh resigned his colonel&#x27;s commission in the U.S. Army Air Corps Reserve on April 28, 1941, writing that he saw &quot;no honorable alternative&quot; given that Roosevelt had publicly questioned his loyalty; the next day, &quot;The New York Times&quot; ran an above the fold, front-page article about his resignation.

On September 11, 1941, Lindbergh delivered a speech for an America First rally at the Des Moines Coliseum that accused three groups of &quot;pressing this country toward war; the British, the Jewish, and the Roosevelt Administration&quot;. He said that the British were propagandizing America because they couldn&#x27;t defeat Nazi Germany without American aid and that the presidency of Franklin D. Roosevelt was trying to use a war to consolidate power. The three paragraphs Lindbergh devoted to accusing American Jews of war agitation formed what biographer A. Scott Berg called &quot;the core of his thesis&quot;. In the speech, Lindbergh said that Jewish Americans had outsized control over government and news media (even though Jews did not compose even 3% of newspaper publishers and were only a minority of foreign policy bureaucrats), employing recognizably antisemitic tropes. The speech received a strong public backlash as newspapers, politicians, and clergy throughout the country criticized America First and Lindbergh for his remarks&#x27; antisemitism.

==Antisemitism and views on race==

Lindbergh&#x27;s anticommunism resonated deeply with many Americans, while his pro-eugenics views and Nordicism enjoyed social acceptance. His speeches and writings reflected his adoption of views on race, religion, and eugenics, similar to those of the German Nazis, and he was suspected of being a Nazi sympathizer. However, during a speech in September 1941, Lindbergh stated &quot;no person with a sense of the dignity of mankind can condone the persecution of the Jewish race in Germany.&quot; Interventionist pamphlets pointed out that his efforts were praised in Nazi Germany and included quotations such as &quot;Racial strength is vital; politics, a luxury.&quot;

Roosevelt disliked Lindbergh&#x27;s outspoken opposition to his administration&#x27;s interventionist policies, telling Treasury Secretary Henry Morgenthau, &quot;If I should die tomorrow, I want you to know this, I am absolutely convinced Lindbergh is a Nazi.&quot; In 1941 he wrote to Secretary of War Henry Stimson: &quot;When I read Lindbergh&#x27;s speech I felt that it could not have been better put if it had been written by Goebbels himself. What a pity that this youngster has completely abandoned his belief in our form of government and has accepted Nazi methods because apparently they are efficient.&quot; Shortly after the war ended, Lindbergh toured a Nazi concentration camp, and wrote in his diary, &quot;Here was a place where men and life and death had reached the lowest form of degradation. How could any reward in national progress even faintly justify the establishment and operation of such a place?&quot;

Lindbergh seemed to state that he believed the survival of the white race was more important than the survival of democracy in Europe: &quot;Our bond with Europe is one of race and not of political ideology,&quot; he declared. Critics have noticed an apparent influence on Lindbergh of German philosopher Oswald Spengler, a conservative authoritarian popular during the interwar period. In a 1935 interview, Lindbergh stated &quot;There is no escaping the fact that men were definitely not created equal...&quot;

Lindbergh developed a long-term friendship with the automobile pioneer Henry Ford, who was well known for his antisemitic newspaper &quot;The Dearborn Independent&quot;. In a famous comment about Lindbergh to Detroit&#x27;s former FBI field office special agent in charge in July 1940, Ford said: &quot;When Charles comes out here, we only talk about the Jews.&quot;

Lindbergh considered Russia a &quot;semi-Asiatic&quot; country compared to Germany, and he believed Communism was an ideology that would destroy the West&#x27;s &quot;racial strength&quot; and replace everyone of European descent with &quot;a pressing sea of Yellow, Black, and Brown&quot;. He stated that if he had to choose, he would rather see America allied with Nazi Germany than Soviet Russia. He preferred Nordics, but he believed, after Soviet Communism was defeated, Russia would be a valuable ally against potential aggression from East Asia.

Lindbergh elucidated his beliefs regarding the white race in a 1939 article in &quot;Reader&#x27;s Digest&quot;:

Lindbergh said certain races have &quot;demonstrated superior ability in the design, manufacture, and operation of machines&quot;, and that &quot;The growth of our western civilization has been closely related to this superiority.&quot; Lindbergh admired &quot;the German genius for science and organization, the English genius for government and commerce, the French genius for living and the understanding of life&quot;. He believed, &quot;in America they can be blended to form the greatest genius of all&quot;.

In his book &quot;The American Axis&quot;, Holocaust researcher and investigative journalist Max Wallace agreed with Franklin Roosevelt&#x27;s assessment that Lindbergh was &quot;pro-Nazi&quot;. However, he found that the Roosevelt Administration&#x27;s accusations of dual loyalty or treason were unsubstantiated. Wallace considered Lindbergh to be a well-intentioned but bigoted and misguided Nazi sympathizer whose career as the leader of the isolationist movement had a destructive impact on Jewish people.

Lindbergh&#x27;s Pulitzer Prize-winning biographer, A. Scott Berg, contended that Lindbergh was not so much a supporter of the Nazi regime as someone so stubborn in his convictions and relatively inexperienced in political maneuvering that he easily allowed rivals to portray him as one. Lindbergh&#x27;s receipt of the Order of the German Eagle, presented in October 1938 by &quot;Generalfeldmarschall&quot; Hermann Göring on behalf of &quot;Führer&quot; Adolf Hitler, was approved without objection by the American embassy. Lindbergh returned to the United States in early 1939 to spread his message of nonintervention. Berg contended Lindbergh&#x27;s views were commonplace in the United States in the interwar era. Lindbergh&#x27;s support for the America First Committee was representative of the sentiments of a number of American people.

Berg also noted: &quot;As late as April 1939after Germany overtook CzechoslovakiaLindbergh was willing to make excuses for Adolf Hitler. &#x27;Much as I disapprove of many things Hitler had done&#x27;, he wrote in his diary on , 1939, &#x27;I believe she [Germany] has pursued the only consistent policy in Europe in recent years. I cannot support her broken promises, but she has only moved a little faster than other nations ... in breaking promises. The question of right and wrong is one thing by law and another thing by history. Berg also explained that leading up to the war, Lindbergh believed the great battle would be between the Soviet Union and Germany, not fascism and democracy.

Lindbergh always championed military strength and alertness. He believed that a strong defensive war machine would make America an impenetrable fortress and defend the Western Hemisphere from an attack by foreign powers, and that this was the U.S. military&#x27;s sole purpose.

While the attack on Pearl Harbor came as a shock to Lindbergh, he did predict that America&#x27;s &quot;wavering policy in the Philippines&quot; would invite a brutal war there, and in one speech warned, &quot;we should either fortify these islands adequately, or get out of them entirely.&quot;

==World War II==

In January 1942, Lindbergh met with Secretary of War, Henry L. Stimson, seeking to be recommissioned in the Army Air Forces. Stimson was strongly opposed because of the long record of public comments. Blocked from active military service, Lindbergh approached a number of aviation companies and offered his services as a consultant. As a technical adviser with Ford in 1942, he was heavily involved in troubleshooting early problems at the Willow Run Consolidated B-24 Liberator bomber production line. As B-24 production smoothed out, he joined United Aircraft in 1943 as an engineering consultant, devoting most of his time to its Chance-Vought Division.In 1944 Lindbergh persuaded United Aircraft to send him as a technical representative to the Pacific Theater to study aircraft performance under combat conditions. In preparation for his deployment to the Pacific, Lindbergh went to Brooks Brothers to buy a naval officer&#x27;s uniform without insignia and visited Brentano&#x27;s bookstore in New York to buy a New Testament, writing in his wartime journal entry for April 3, 1944: &quot;Purchased a small New Testament at Brentano&#x27;s. Since I can only carry one book—and a very small one—that is my choice. It would not have been a decade ago; but the more I learn and the more I read, the less competition it has.&quot; He demonstrated how United States Marine Corps Aviation pilots could take off safely with a bomb load double the Vought F4U Corsair fighter-bomber&#x27;s rated capacity. At the time, several Marine squadrons were flying bomber escorts to destroy the Japanese stronghold of Rabaul, New Britain, in the Australian Territory of New Guinea. On , 1944, Lindbergh flew his first combat mission: a strafing run with VMF-222 near the Japanese garrison of Rabaul. He also flew with VMF-216, from the Marine Air Base at Torokina, Bougainville. Lindbergh was escorted on one of these missions by Lt. Robert E. (Lefty) McDonough, who refused to fly with Lindbergh again, as he did not want to be known as &quot;the guy who killed Lindbergh&quot;.

In his six months in the Pacific in 1944, Lindbergh took part in fighter bomber raids on Japanese positions, flying 50 combat missions (again as a civilian). His innovations in the use of Lockheed P-38 Lightning fighters impressed a supportive Gen. Douglas MacArthur. Lindbergh introduced engine-leaning techniques to P-38 pilots, greatly improving fuel consumption at cruise speeds, enabling the long-range fighter aircraft to fly longer-range missions. P-38 pilot Warren Lewis quoted Lindbergh&#x27;s fuel-saving settings, &quot;He said, &#x27;... we can cut the RPM down to 1400 RPMs and use 30 inches of mercury (manifold pressure), and save 50–100 gallons of fuel on a mission. The U.S. Marine and Army Air Force pilots who served with Lindbergh praised his courage and defended his patriotism.

On , 1944, during a P-38 bomber escort mission with the 433rd Fighter Squadron in the Ceram area, Lindbergh shot down a Mitsubishi Ki-51 &quot;Sonia&quot; observation plane, piloted by Captain Saburo Shimada, commanding officer of the 73rd Independent Chutai. Lindbergh&#x27;s participation in combat was revealed in a story in the &quot;Passaic Herald-News&quot; on October 22, 1944.

In mid-October 1944, Lindbergh participated in a joint Army-Navy conference on fighter planes at NAS Patuxent River, Maryland.

==Later life==
After World War II, Lindbergh lived in Darien, Connecticut, and served as a consultant to the Chief of Staff of the United States Air Force and to Pan American World Airways. With most of eastern Europe under communist control, Lindbergh continued to voice concern about Soviet power, observing: &quot;Freedom of speech and action is suppressed over a large portion of the world...Poland is not free, nor the Baltic states, nor the Balkans. Fear, hatred, and mistrust are breeding.&quot; In Lindbergh&#x27;s words, Soviet and communist influence over the post-war world meant that &quot;while our soldiers have been victorious,&quot; America had nonetheless not &quot;accomplished the objectives for which we went to war,&quot; and he declared: &quot;We have not established peace or liberty in Europe.&quot;

Commenting on the post-war world, Lindbergh said that &quot;a whole civilization is in disintegration,&quot; and believed America needed to support Europe against communism. Because America had &quot;taken a leading part&quot; in World War II, he said it therefore could not &quot;retire now and leave Europe to the destructive forces&quot; that the war had &quot;let loose.&quot; While he still believed his prewar non-interventionism was correct, Lindbergh said the United States now had a responsibility to support Europe, because of &quot;honor, self-respect, and our own national interests.&quot; Furthermore, Lindbergh wrote that &quot;we could not let atrocities such as those of the concentration camps go unpunished,&quot; and firmly supported the Nuremberg trials.

After the war, Lindbergh toured Germany, covering &quot;almost two thousand miles during his last two weeks&quot; in the country, and also traveled to Paris and participated in &quot;conferences with military personnel and the American Ambassador&quot; during the same trip. While in Germany in June 1945, he toured Dora concentration camp, inspecting the tunnels of Nordhausen and viewing V-1 and V-2 missile parts. He attempted to &quot;reconcile,&quot; as Berg wrote, the technology he saw with how the &quot;forces of evil had harnessed it.&quot; Reflecting on what happened in the camps, Lindbergh wrote in his wartime journal that it &quot;seemed impossible that men—civilized men—could degenerate to such a level. Yet they had.&quot; 

In the following page in his journal, he also lamented the mistreatment of Japanese people by Americans and other Allied personnel during the war, comparing these &quot;incidents&quot; to what the Germans did. As Berg wrote in 1998, Lindbergh returned from this two-month European journey &quot;more alarmed about the state of the world than ever,&quot; but nonetheless &quot;he knew that the American public no longer gave a hoot for his opinions.&quot; Drawing lessons from the war, Lindbergh stated: &quot;No peace will last that is not based on Christian principles, on justice, on compassion...on a sense of the dignity of man. Without such principles there can be no lasting strength...The Germans found that out.&quot;

Soon after returning to America, Lindbergh paid a visit to his mother in Detroit, and on the train home he wrote a letter wherein he mentioned a &quot;spiritual awareness,&quot; speaking of how important it was to spend time in the garden, take in the sun, and listen to birds. In Berg&#x27;s words, this letter &quot;revealed a changed man.&quot; As time went on, Lindbergh became increasingly spiritual in his outlook and grew concerned with the impact science and technology had on the world. In 1948, his &quot;Of Flight and Life&quot; was published, a book that has been described as an &quot;impassioned warning against the dangers of scientific materialism and the powers of technology.&quot; He wrote of his experiences as a combat pilot in the Pacific theater, and declared his conversion from a worshiper of science to a worshiper of the &quot;eternal truths of God,&quot; expressing concern for humanity&#x27;s future. In 1949, he received the Wright Brothers Memorial Trophy and declared in his acceptance speech: &quot;If we are to be finally successful, we must measure scientific accomplishments by their effect on man himself.&quot;

On April 7, 1954, on the recommendation of President Dwight D. Eisenhower, Lindbergh was commissioned a brigadier general in the U.S. Air Force Reserve; Eisenhower had nominated Lindbergh for promotion on February 15. Also in that year, he served on a Congressional advisory panel that recommended the site of the United States Air Force Academy. He won the Pulitzer Prize for biography in 1954 with his book, &quot;The Spirit of St. Louis&quot;, which focuses on his 1927 flight and the events leading up to it. In May 1962, Lindbergh visited the White House with his wife and met President John F. Kennedy, having his picture taken by White House photographer Robert Knudsen.

In December 1968, he visited the astronauts of Apollo 8 (the first crewed mission to orbit the Moon) the day before their launch, and in July 1969 he and his wife witnessed the launch of Apollo 11 as personal guests of Neil Armstrong. Armstrong had met Lindbergh in 1968, and the two corresponded until the latter&#x27;s death in 1974. In conjunction with the first lunar landing, he shared his thoughts as part of Walter Cronkite&#x27;s live television coverage. He later wrote the foreword to Apollo astronaut Michael Collins&#x27;s autobiography. While he maintained his interest in technology, Lindbergh began to focus more on protecting the natural world, and after viewing the Apollo 11 launch, he &quot;participated in a WWF-sponsored dedication of a 900-acre bird preserve.&quot;

===Double life and secret German children===
Beginning in 1957, Lindbergh engaged in lengthy sexual relationships with three women, while remaining married to Anne Morrow. He fathered three children with hatmaker Brigitte Hesshaimer, who lived in the Bavarian town of Geretsried. He had two children with her sister Mariette, a painter, living in Grimisuat. Lindbergh also had a son and daughter, born in 1959 and 1961, with Valeska, who was his private secretary in Europe and lived in Baden-Baden. All seven children were born between 1958 and 1967.

Ten days before he died, Lindbergh wrote to each of his European mistresses, imploring them to maintain the utmost secrecy about his illicit activities with them even after his death. The three women, none of whom ever married, all kept their affairs secret even from their children, who during his lifetime, and for almost a decade after his death, did not know the true identity of their father, whom they had only known by the alias Careu Kent, and seen only when he briefly visited them once or twice a year. 

After reading a magazine article about Lindbergh in the mid-1980s, Brigitte&#x27;s daughter Astrid deduced the truth. She later discovered photographs and more than 150 love letters from Lindbergh to her mother. After Brigitte and Anne Lindbergh had both died, she made her findings public. In 2003, DNA tests confirmed that Lindbergh had fathered Astrid and her two siblings. 

Reeve Lindbergh, Lindbergh&#x27;s youngest child with Anne, wrote in her personal journal in 2003, &quot;This story reflects absolutely Byzantine layers of deception on the part of our shared father. These children did not even know who he was! He used a pseudonym with them (To protect them, perhaps? To protect himself, absolutely!)&quot;

=== Environmental and tribal causes ===

In later life Lindbergh was heavily involved in conservation movements, and was deeply concerned about the negative impacts of new technologies on the natural world and native peoples, focusing on regions like Hawaii, Africa, and the Philippines. He campaigned to protect endangered species including the humpback whale, blue whale, Philippine eagle, and the tamaraw (a rare dwarf Philippine buffalo), and was instrumental in establishing protections for the Tasaday and Agta people, and various African tribes such as the Maasai. Alongside Laurance S. Rockefeller, Lindbergh helped establish the Haleakalā National Park in Hawaii. He also worked to protect Arctic wolves in Alaska, and helped establish Voyageurs National Park in northern Minnesota.

In an essay appearing in the July 1964 &quot;Reader&#x27;s Digest&quot;, Lindbergh wrote about a realization he had in Kenya during a trip to see land being considered for a national park. He contrasted his time amid the African landscape with his involvement in a supersonic transport convention in New York, and while &quot;lying under an acacia tree,&quot; he realized how the &quot;construction of an airplane&quot; was simple compared to the &quot;evolutionary achievement of a bird.&quot; He wrote &quot;that if I had to choose, I would rather have birds than airplanes.&quot; 

In this essay, he questioned his old definition of &quot;progress,&quot; and concluded that nature displayed more actual progress than humanity&#x27;s creations. He wrote several more essays for &quot;Reader&#x27;s Digest&quot; and &quot;Life&quot;, urging people to respect the self-awareness that came from contact with nature, which he called the &quot;wisdom of wildness,&quot; and not merely follow science. As David Boocker wrote in 2009, Lindbergh&#x27;s essays, appearing in popular magazines, &quot;introduced millions of people to the conservation cause,&quot; and he made an important &quot;appeal to lead a life less complicated by technology.&quot;

On May 14, 1971, Lindbergh received the Philippine Order of the Golden Heart at a formal dinner at Malacañang Palace in Manila. He was described as an aviation pioneer who had symbolized the advance of technology, and who now was a symbol of the drive to protect natural life from technology. Lindbergh actively participated in both conservation and advocacy for tribal minorities in the Philippines, frequently visiting the country and working to protect species including the tamaraw and Philippine eagle, which he described as a &quot;magnificent bird,&quot; lending his name to a law against killing or trapping the animal. 

In August 1971, in Davao City, he ceremonially received a young Philippine eagle kept in captivity after its mother was killed by a hunter, delaying his return to the United States so he could take part in the presentation. Arturo Garcia, a movie theater manager in Davao, had bought the bird in March 1970 after the hunting incident, and built a large cage for it behind his house. Lindbergh entered the cage with Jesus Alvarez, director of the Philippines park and wildlife commission, received the eagle, and then turned it over to Alvarez, remarking: &quot;Now we have to see if the bird can go back to its natural place.&quot; The Associated Press reported on both Lindbergh&#x27;s reception of the Order of the Golden Heart and the presentation of the eagle.

==== 1972 Philippines expedition ====

Lindbergh&#x27;s speeches and writings in later life centered on technology and nature, and his lifelong belief that &quot;all the achievements of mankind have value only to the extent that they preserve and improve the quality of life&quot;. In 1972, Lindbergh undertook an expedition with a television news crew to Mindanao, in the Philippines, to investigate reports of a lost tribe. The Tasaday, a Philippine indigenous people of the Lake Sebu area, were attracting much media attention at the time. Although both &quot;NBC Evening News&quot; and &quot;National Geographic&quot; ran stories about the supposed discovery of the tribe, a controversy emerged over whether the Tasaday were truly uncontacted, or had just been portrayed that way for media attention—particularly by Manuel Elizalde Jr., a Philippine politician who publicized the tribe—and were in reality &quot;not completely isolated.&quot; 

Lindbergh cooperated with Elizalde to get a &quot;proclamation from President Ferdinand Marcos to preserve more than 46,000 acres of Tasaday country.&quot; However, during Lindbergh&#x27;s 1972 expedition, the support helicopter for his team had mechanical trouble, creating the prospect of a three-day return trek through difficult jungle terrain. On April 2, &quot;The New York Times&quot; ran a UPI report stating Lindbergh&#x27;s party had &quot;sent a radio message from the rain forests of the southern Philippines saying their food was nearly gone and they needed help.&quot; Henry A. Byroade, U.S. Ambassador to the Philippines, called upon the 31st Aerospace Rescue and Recovery Squadron at Clark Air Base on the island of Luzon to perform a rescue. 

U.S. Air Force Maj. Bruce Ware and his crew—co-pilot Lt. Col. Dick Smith, flight engineer SSgt Bob Baldwin, and pararescueman Airman 1st Class Kim Robinson—flew their Sikorsky HH-3E Jolly Green Giant over to rescue Lindbergh and his news crew on April 12, 1972. Lindbergh and the news team were stranded on a high jungle ridge line, and because of this terrain the Sikorsky &quot;had to hover with the nose wheel on one side of the ridge, and the main wheels on the other, with the boarding steps a few feet over the ridge top.&quot; During the operation, the helicopter had to refuel twice, prompting Lindbergh to comment that although he had helped develop in-flight refueling, he had never been aboard a helicopter during the procedure, nor on the receiving end of it. 

After more than twelve hours, and a total of eight trips to a nearby drop point, the mission was completed, and all 46 individuals stranded on the ridge were extracted. With Lindbergh aboard, the helicopter then flew to Mactan Air Base, on the island of Cebu, where photographers were waiting for him. Ware rested in the pilot&#x27;s seat for several minutes after landing, and Lindbergh was hesitant to disembark before him. He told Ware he was certain he could not have made the &quot;hard&quot; three-day journey back. Lindbergh, with other passengers, was then loaded on a HC-130 and flown to Manila. As reported by the Associated Press, Lindbergh remarked after his rescue: &quot;We were in no danger but we were stranded and running low on food.&quot;

Maj. Ware received the Distinguished Flying Cross for his actions, and the other Sikorsky crew members received the Air Medal. In 2021, Ware described how he received his medal &quot;in less than a week,&quot; remarking that it normally &quot;takes several months. But when you&#x27;ve got an international hero, it kind of gains some momentum.”

==== Retirement in Hawaii ====

Lindbergh joined with early aviation industrialist, former Pan Am executive vice president, and longtime friend, Samuel F. Pryor Jr., in &quot;efforts by the Nature Conservancy to preserve plants and wildlife in Kipahulu Valley&quot; on the Hawaiian island of Maui. Lindbergh chose the Kipahulu Valley for retirement, building an A-frame cottage there in 1971; Pryor moved there in 1965 with his wife, Mary, after retiring from Pan Am. Lindbergh&#x27;s choice of Maui as a retirement home &quot;represented his love of natural places&quot; and his &quot;lifelong commitment to the ideal of simplicity.&quot;

==== Views on technology ====
Commenting on Lindbergh&#x27;s profound concern with the impact of technology on humanity, Richard Hallion wrote: &quot;He recognized the narrow margin on which society trod in the unstable nuclear era, and his work after World War II confirmed his fear that humanity now had the ability to destroy in minutes what previous generations had taken centuries to create. And so Lindbergh the technologist changed to Lindbergh the philosopher, protector of the Tasaday, preaching a turn from the materialistic, mechanistic society toward a society based on &#x27;simplicity, humiliation, contemplation, prayer.&#x27;&quot; In her 1988 book, &quot;Charles A. Lindbergh and the American Dilemma&quot;, Susan M. Gray wrote that Lindbergh &quot;established his &#x27;middle ground&#x27; between technology and human values, embracing both, rejecting neither.&quot;

===Death===

Lindbergh spent his last years on Maui in his small, rustic seaside home. In 1972, he became sick with cancer and ultimately died of lymphoma on the morning of , 1974, at age 72. After his cancer diagnosis, Lindbergh &quot;sketched a simple design for his grave and coffin,&quot; helping to design his grave in the &quot;traditional Hawaiian style.&quot; Following &quot;a series of radiation treatments, he spent several months in Maui recuperating,&quot; and also made a 26-day stay in the Columbia-Presbyterian Medical Center in New York, but with little improvement. 

After he realized the treatment would not save him, he decided to leave Columbia hospital and returned to Kipahulu with his wife Anne, flying to Honolulu on August 17 and then traveling to Maui by small plane, dying a week later. He was buried on the grounds of the Palapala Ho&#x27;omau Church in Kipahulu, Maui, a Congregational church first established in 1864, which fell into disuse in the 1940s and was restored beginning in 1964 by Samuel F. Pryor Jr., whose family cooperated with the Lindbergh family to create an endowment for the upkeep of the property. Lindbergh took part in the church restoration with his old friend Pryor, and both men agreed to make their final resting place in the small cemetery they cleared.

On the evening of August 26, President Gerald Ford made a tribute to Lindbergh, saying that the courage and daring of his Atlantic flight would never be forgotten, describing him as a selfless, sincere man, and stating: &quot;For a generation of Americans, and for millions of other people around the world, the &#x27;Lone Eagle&#x27; represented all that was best in our country.&quot;

==Honors and tributes==

* Lindbergh was a recipient of the Silver Buffalo Award, the highest adult award given by the Boy Scouts of America, on April 10, 1928.
* On , 1928, a statue was dedicated at Le Bourget Airport in Paris honoring Lindbergh and his New York to Paris flight as well as Charles Nungesser and François Coli who had disapppeared while attempted the same feat two weeks earlier in the other direction aboard &quot;L&#x27;Oiseau Blanc&quot; (&quot;The White Bird&quot;).
* San Diego International Airport was named Lindbergh Field from 1928 to 2003. A replica of his plane hangs above baggage claim.
* In 1933, the Lindbergh Range () in Greenland was named after him by Danish Arctic explorer Lauge Koch following aerial surveys made during the 1931–1934 Three-year Expedition to East Greenland.
* In St. Louis County, Missouri, a school district, high school and highway are named for Lindbergh, and he has a star on the St. Louis Walk of Fame. 
* In 1937, a transatlantic race was proposed to commemorate the tenth anniversary of Lindbergh&#x27;s flight to Paris, though it was eventually modified to take a different course of similar length. &quot;See&quot; 1937 Istres–Damascus–Paris Air Race.
* He was inducted into the National Aviation Hall of Fame in 1967.
* The Royal Air Force Museum in London minted a medal with his image as part of a 50 medal set called &quot;The History of Man in Flight&quot; in 1972.
* The original Lindbergh residence in Little Falls, Minnesota, is maintained as a museum, and is listed as a National Historic Landmark.
* In February 2002, the Medical University of South Carolina at Charleston, within the celebrations for the Lindbergh 100th birthday established the Lindbergh-Carrel Prize, given to major contributors to &quot;development of perfusion and bioreactor technologies for organ preservation and growth&quot;. M. E. DeBakey and nine other scientists received the prize, a bronze statuette expressly created for the event by the Italian artist C. Zoli and named &quot;Elisabeth&quot;, after Elisabeth Morrow, sister of Lindbergh&#x27;s wife Anne Morrow, who died as a result of heart disease. Lindbergh was disappointed that contemporary medical technology could not provide an artificial heart pump that would allow for heart surgery on Elisabeth and that led to the first contact between Carrel and Lindbergh.

==Writings==
In addition to &quot;&quot;WE&quot;&quot; and &quot;The Spirit of St. Louis&quot;, Lindbergh wrote prolifically over the years on other topics, including science, technology, nationalism, war, materialism, and values. Included among those writings were five other books: &quot;The Culture of Organs&quot; (with Dr. Alexis Carrel) (1938), &quot;Of Flight and Life&quot; (1948), &quot;The Wartime Journals of Charles A. Lindbergh&quot; (1970), &quot;Boyhood on the Upper Mississippi&quot; (1972), and his unfinished &quot;Autobiography of Values&quot; (posthumous, 1978).

==In popular culture==
===Literature===
In addition to many biographies, such as A. Scott Berg&#x27;s 1998 award-winning bestseller &quot;Lindbergh&quot;, Lindbergh also influenced or was the model for characters in a variety of works of fiction. Shortly after he made his famous flight, the Stratemeyer Syndicate began publishing a series of books for juvenile readers called the &quot;Ted Scott Flying Stories&quot; (1927–1943), which were written by a number of authors using the &quot;nom de plume&quot; &quot;Franklin W. Dixon&quot;, in which the pilot hero was closely modeled after Lindbergh. Ted Scott duplicated the solo flight to Paris in the series&#x27; first volume, &quot;Over the Ocean to Paris&quot; (1927). Another reference to Lindbergh appears in the Agatha Christie novel (1934) and movie &quot;Murder on the Orient Express&quot; (1974) which begins with a fictionalized depiction of the Lindbergh kidnapping.

There have been several alternate history novels depicting Lindbergh&#x27;s alleged Nazi-sympathies and non-interventionist views during the first half of World War II. In Daniel Easterman&#x27;s &quot;K is for Killing&quot; (1997), a fictional Lindbergh becomes president of a fascist United States. The Philip Roth novel &quot;The Plot Against America&quot; (2004) explores an alternate history where Franklin Delano Roosevelt is defeated in the 1940 presidential election by Lindbergh, who allies the United States with Nazi Germany.

The Robert Harris novel &quot;Fatherland&quot; (1992) explores an alternate history where the Nazis won the war, the United States still defeats Japan, Adolf Hitler and President Joseph Kennedy negotiate peace terms, and Lindbergh is the US Ambassador to Germany. The Jo Walton novel &quot;Farthing&quot; (2006) explores an alternate history where the United Kingdom made peace with Nazi Germany in 1941, Japan never attacked Pearl Harbor, thus the United States never got involved with the war, and Lindbergh is president and is seeking closer economic ties with the Greater East Asian Co-Prosperity Sphere.

===Film and television===
* Lindbergh has been the subject of numerous documentary films, including &quot;Charles A. Lindbergh&quot; (1927), a UK documentary by De Forest Phonofilm; &quot;40,000 Miles with Lindbergh&quot; (1928), featuring Lindbergh himself; and &quot;The American ExperienceLindbergh: The Shocking, Turbulent Life of America&#x27;s Lone Eagle&quot; (1988).
* The 1942 MGM picture &quot;Keeper of the Flame&quot;, starring Katharine Hepburn and Spencer Tracy, features Hepburn as the widow of a &quot;Lindbergh-like&quot; national hero.
* In the major motion picture &quot;The Spirit of St. Louis&quot; (1957), directed by Billy Wilder, Lindbergh was played by James Stewart, an admirer of Lindbergh and himself a World WarII aviator. The film largely centers around Lindbergh&#x27;s record-breaking 1927 flight. Prior to the casting of Stewart, John Kerr declined to play the role because of Lindbergh&#x27;s alleged pro-Nazi beliefs. 
* In 1976, Buzz Kulik&#x27;s TV movie &quot;The Lindbergh Kidnapping Case&quot;, with Anthony Hopkins as Richard Hauptmann, premiered on NBC.
* Lindbergh was the theme of prolific director Orson Welles&#x27;s final living film project in 1984, &quot;The Spirit of Charles Lindbergh&quot;, where Welles speaks of the human spirit while quoting Lindbergh&#x27;s journal. Although never intended to be viewed by the public, a brief clip can be seen at the end of Vassili Slovic&#x27;s 1995 documentary &quot;Orson Welles: the One-Man Band&quot;.
* The 2020 HBO alternate history miniseries &quot;The Plot Against America&quot;, based on the Philip Roth book of the same name, features actor Ben Cole as a fictionalized President Lindbergh following his defeat of Roosevelt in 1940. The series portrays Lindbergh as a xenophobic populist with strong ties to Nazi Germany.
* Charles Lindbergh &quot;Chuck&quot; McGill, a fictional character in the TV series &quot;Better Call Saul&quot; (2015–2022), was named after Lindbergh.

===Music===
Within days of the flight, dozens of Tin Pan Alley publishers rushed a variety of popular songs into print celebrating Lindbergh and the &quot;Spirit of St. Louis&quot; including &quot;Lindbergh (The Eagle of the U.S.A.)&quot; by Howard Johnson and Al Sherman, and &quot;Lucky Lindy!&quot; by L. Wolfe Gilbert and Abel Baer. In the two-year period following Lindbergh&#x27;s flight, the U.S. Copyright Office recorded three hundred applications for Lindbergh songs. Tony Randall revived &quot;Lucky Lindy&quot; in an album of Jazz Age and Depression-era songs that he recorded titled &quot;Vo Vo De Oh Doe&quot; (1967).

While the exact origin of the name of the Lindy Hop is disputed, it is widely acknowledged that Lindbergh&#x27;s 1927 flight helped to popularize the dance: soon after &quot;Lucky Lindy&quot; &quot;hopped&quot; the Atlantic, the Lindy Hop became a trendy, fashionable dance, and songs referring to the &quot;Lindbergh Hop&quot; were quickly released.

In 1929, Bertolt Brecht wrote a cantata called &quot;Der Lindberghflug&quot; (&quot;Lindbergh&#x27;s Flight&quot;) with music by Kurt Weill and Paul Hindemith. Because of Lindbergh&#x27;s apparent Nazi sympathies, in 1950 Brecht removed all direct references to Lindbergh and renamed the piece &quot;Der Ozeanflug&quot; (&quot;The Flight Across the Ocean&quot;).

In the early 1940s Woody Guthrie wrote &quot;Lindbergh&quot; or &quot;Mister Charlie Lindbergh&quot; which criticizes Lindbergh&#x27;s involvement with the America First Committee and his suspected sympathy for Nazi Germany.

===Postage stamps===

Lindbergh and the &quot;Spirit&quot; have been honored by a variety of world postage stamps over the last eight decades, including three issued by the United States. Less than three weeks after the flight the U.S. Post Office Department issued a 10-cent &quot;Lindbergh Air Mail&quot; stamp on , 1927, with engraved illustrations of both the &quot;Spirit of St. Louis&quot; and a map of its route from New York to Paris. This was also the first U.S. stamp to bear the name of a living person. A 13-cent commemorative stamp depicting the &quot;Spirit&quot; over the Atlantic Ocean was issued on , 1977, the 50th anniversary of the flight from Roosevelt Field. On , 1998, a 32¢ stamp with the legend &quot;Lindbergh Flies Atlantic&quot; depicting Lindbergh and the &quot;Spirit&quot; was issued as part of the Celebrate the Century stamp sheet series.

===Other===
During World War II, Lindbergh was a frequent target of Dr. Seuss&#x27;s first political cartoons, published in the New York magazine &quot;PM&quot;, in which Seuss criticized Lindbergh&#x27;s isolationism, antisemitism, and supposed Nazi sympathies.

Lindbergh&#x27;s &quot;Spirit of St. Louis&quot; is featured in the opening sequence of &quot;Star Trek: Enterprise&quot; (2001–2005).

St. Louis area–based GoJet Airlines uses the callsign &quot;Lindbergh&quot; after Charles Lindbergh.

The aeronautical themed Hotel Charles Lindbergh at German theme park Phantasialand was named after Lindbergh.

<text>A model aircraft is a physical model of an existing or imagined aircraft, and is built typically for display, research, or amusement. Model aircraft are divided into two basic groups: flying and non-flying. Non-flying models are also termed static, display, or shelf models.

Aircraft manufacturers and researchers make wind tunnel models for testing aerodynamic properties, for basic research, or for the development of new designs. Sometimes only part of the aircraft is modelled.

Static models range from mass-produced toys in white metal or plastic to highly accurate and detailed models produced for museum display and requiring thousands of hours of work. Many are available in kits, typically made of injection-molded polystyrene or resin.

Flying models range from simple toy gliders made of sheets of paper, balsa, card stock or foam polystyrene to powered scale models built up from balsa, bamboo sticks, plastic, (including both molded or sheet polystyrene, and styrofoam), metal, synthetic resin, either alone or with carbon fiber or fiberglass, and skinned with either tissue paper, mylar and other materials. Some can be large, especially when used to research the flight properties of a proposed full scale aircraft.
==Aerodynamic research and mock-ups==

Models are made for wind tunnel and free-flight research tests and may have components that can be swapped to compare various fittings and configurations, or have features such as controls that can be repositioned to reflect various in flight configurations. They are also often fitted with sensors for spot measurements and are usually mounted on a structure that ensures the correct alignment with the airflow, and which provides additional measurements. For wind tunnel research, it is sometimes necessary only to make part of the proposed aircraft.

Full-scale static engineering models are also constructed for production development, often made of different materials from the proposed design. Again, often only part of the aircraft is modelled.

==Static display models==
Static model aircraft cannot fly, and are used for display, education and are used in wind tunnels to collect data for the design of full scale aircraft. They may be built using any suitable material, which often includes plastic, wood, metal, paper and fiberglass and may be built to a specific scale, so that the size of the original may be compared to that of other aircraft. Models may come finished, or may require painting or assembly, with glue, screws, or by clipping together, or both.

Many of the world&#x27;s airlines allow their aircraft to be modelled for publicity. Airlines used to order large scale models of their aircraft to supply them to travel agencies as a promotional item. Desktop model airplanes may be given to airport, airline and government officials to promote an airline or celebrate a new route or an achievement.

===Scale===

Static model aircraft are primarily available commercially in a variety of scales from as large as 1:18 scale to as small as 1:1250 scale. Plastic model kits requiring assembly and painting are primarily available in 1:144, 1:72, 1:48, 1:32, and 1:24 scale. Die-cast metal models (pre-assembled and factory painted) are available in scales ranging from 1:48 to 1:600.

Scales are not random, but are generally based on divisions of either the Imperial system, or the Metric system.
For example, 1:48 scale is 1/4&quot; to 1-foot (or 1&quot; to 4 feet) and 1:72 is 1&quot; to 6 feet, while in metric scales such as 1:100th, 1 centimeter equals 1 meter.
1:72 scale was introduced with Skybirds wood and metal model aircraft kits in 1932 and were followed closely by Frog, which used the same scale from 1936 with their &quot;Frog Penguin&quot; brand. 1:72 was popularized in the US during the Second World War by the US War Department after it requested models of commonly encountered single engine aircraft at that scale, and multi-engine aircraft in 1:144th scale. They hoped to improve aircraft recognition skills and these scales compromised between size and detail. After WWII, manufacturers continued with these scales, however kits are also added in other divisions of the imperial system. 1:50th and 1:100th are common in Japan and France, which both use Metric. Promotional models for airlines are produced in scales ranging from 1:200 to 1:1200.

Some manufacturers made 1:18th scale aircraft to go with cars of the same scale. Aircraft models, military vehicles, figures, cars, and trains all have different common scales but there is some crossover. There is a substantial amount of duplication of more famous subjects in different scales, which can be useful for forced perspective box dioramas.

Older models often did not conform to an established scale as they were sized to fit the box, and are referred to as being to &quot;Box Scale&quot;.

===Materials===
The most common form of manufacture for kits is injection molded polystyrene plastic, formed in steel forms. Plastic pellets are heated into a liquid and forced into the mold under high pressure through trees that hold all the parts, and ensure plastic flows to every part of the mold. This allows a greater degree of automation than other manufacturing processes but molds require large production runs to cover the cost of making them. Today, this takes place mostly in Asia and Eastern Europe. Smaller runs are possible with copper molds, and some companies use resin or rubber molds, but while the cost is lower for the mold, the durability is also lower and labor costs can be much higher.

Resin kits are made in forms similar to those used for limited run plastic kits, but these molds are usually not as durable, which limits them to smaller production runs, and prices for the finished product are higher.

Vacuum forming is another common alternative but requires more skill, and details must be supplied by the modeller. There is a handful of photo etched metal kits that allow a high level of detail and they are unable to replicate compound curves.

Scale models can also be made from paper or card stock. Commercial models are mainly printed by publishers in Germany or Eastern Europe but can be distributed through the internet, some of which are offered this way for free.

From World War I through the 1950s, static model airplanes were also built from light weight bamboo or balsa wood and covered with tissue paper in the same manner as with flying models. This was a time-consuming process that mirrored the actual construction of airplanes through the beginning of World War II. Many model makers would create models from drawings of the actual aircraft.

Ready-made desk-top models include those produced in fiberglass for travel agents and aircraft manufacturers, as well as collectors models made from die-cast metal, mahogany, resin and plastic.

Carbon fibers and fiberglass have become increasingly common in model aircraft kits. In model helicopters, main frames and rotor blades are often made from carbon fiber, along with ribs and spars in fixed-wing aircraft wings.

==Flying models==

Aeromodelling is the building and operation of flying model aircraft. Some flying models resemble scaled down versions of full scale aircraft, while others are built with no intention of looking like real aircraft. There are also models of birds, bats and pterosaurs (usually ornithopters). The reduced size affects the model&#x27;s Reynolds number, which determines how the air reacts when flowing past the model, and compared to a full sized aircraft the size of control surfaces needed, the stability and the effectiveness of specific airfoil sections may differ considerably requiring changes to the design.

===Control===
Flying model aircraft are generally controlled through one of three methods
*Free flight (F/F) model aircraft are uncontrolled other than by control surfaces that must be preset before flight, and must have a high degree of natural stability. Most free flying models are either unpowered gliders or rubber powered. These pre-date manned flight.
*Control line (C/L) model aircraft use strings or wires to tether the model to a central pivot, either held by hand or to a pole. The aircraft then flies in circles around that point, secured by one cable, while a second provides pitch control through a connection to the elevator. Some use a third cable to control a throttle. There are many competition categories. Speed flying is divided into classes based on engine displacement. Class &#x27;D&#x27; 60 size speed planes can easily reach speeds well in excess of .
*Radio-controlled aircraft have a controller who operates a transmitter that sends signals to a receiver in the model to actuate servos that adjust the model&#x27;s flight controls similarly to a full sized aircraft. Traditionally, the radio signal directly controlled servos, however, modern examples often use flight control computers to stabilize the model or even to fly it autonomously. This is particularly the case with quadcopters. Rudimentary flight controllers were first introduced in model helicopters, with standalone electronic gyroscopes used stabilize the tail rotor control. Much like quadcopters, this has now extended to all flight controls.

===Construction===
Flying models construction may differ from that of static models as both weight and strength are major considerations.

Flying models borrow construction techniques from full-sized aircraft although the use of metal is limited. These might consist of forming a frame using thin planks of a light wood such as balsa to duplicate the formers, longerons, spars, and ribs of a vintage full-size aircraft, or, on larger (usually powered) models where weight is less of a factor, sheets of wood, expanded polystyrene, and wood veneers may be employed. It is then given a smooth sealed surface, usually with aircraft dope. For light models, tissue paper is used. For larger models (usually powered and radio controlled) heat-curing or heat shrink covering plastic films or heat-shrinkable synthetic fabrics are applied to the model. Microfilm covering is used for the lightest models and is made by spreading few drops of lacquer out over several square feet of water, and lifting a wire loop through it, which creates a thin plastic film.
Flying models can be assembled from kits, built from plans, or made completely from scratch. A kit contains the necessary raw material, typically die- or laser-cut wood parts, some molded parts, plans, assembly instructions and may have been flight tested. Plans are intended for the more experienced modeller, since the builder must make or find the materials themselves. Scratch builders may draw their own plans, and source all the materials themselves. Any method may be labor-intensive, depending on the model in question.

To increase the hobby&#x27;s accessibility, some vendors offer Almost Ready to Fly (ARF) models that minimize the skills required, and reduce build time to under 4 hours, versus 10–40 or more for a traditional kit. Ready To Fly (RTF) radio control aircraft are also available, however model building remains integral to the hobby for many. For a more mass market approach, foamies, injection-molded from lightweight foam (sometimes reinforced) have made indoor flight more accessible and many require little more than attaching the wing and landing gear.

===Gliders===

Gliders do not have an attached powerplant. Larger outdoor model gliders are usually radio-controlled gliders and hand-winched against the wind by a line attached to a hook under the fuselage with a ring, so that the line drops when the model is overhead. Other methods include catapult-launching, using an elastic bungee cord. The newer &quot;discus&quot; style of wingtip hand-launching has largely supplanted the earlier &quot;javelin&quot; type of launch. Also using ground-based power winches, hand-towing, and towing aloft using a second powered aircraft.

Gliders sustain flight through exploitation of the wind in the environment. A hill or slope often produces updrafts of air that sustain the flight of a glider. This is called slope soaring, and radio controlled gliders can remain airborne for as long as the updraft remains. Another means of attaining height in a glider is exploitation of thermals, which are columns of warm rising air created by differences of temperature on the ground such as between an asphalt parking lot and a lake. Heated air rises, carrying the glider with it. As with a powered aircraft, lift is obtained by the action of the wings as the aircraft moves through the air, but in a glider, height is gained by flying through air that is rising faster than the aircraft is sinking.

Walkalong gliders are lightweight model airplanes flown in the ridge lift produced by the pilot following in close proximity. In other words, the glider is slope soaring in the updraft of the moving pilot (see also Controllable slope soaring).

===Power sources===

Powered models contain an onboard &quot;powerplant&quot;, a mechanism powering propulsion of the aircraft through the air. Electric motors and internal combustion engines are the most common propulsion systems, but other types include rocket, small turbine, pulsejet, compressed gas, and tension-loaded (twisted) rubber band devices.

====Rubber====
The oldest method of powering free flight models is Alphonse Pénaud&#x27;s elastic motor (or extensible motor) of 1871, essentially a long rubber band that is twisted to add tension, prior to flight. It is the most widely used powerplant, found on everything from children&#x27;s toys to competition models. The elastic offers simplicity and durability, but has a short running time, and the initial high torque of a fully wound motor drops sharply before plateauing to a steady output, until the final turns unwind and power drops off completely. Using it efficiently is one of the challenges of competitive free-flight rubber flying, and variable-pitch propellers, differential wing and tailplane incidence and rudder settings, controlled by timers, can help to manage the torque. There are also usually motor weight restrictions in contest classes. Even so, models have achieved flights of nearly 1 hour.

====Compressed gases====
Stored compressed gas, typically carbon dioxide (CO2), can power simple models in a manner similar to filling a balloon and then releasing it. Compressed CO2 may also be used to power an expansion engine to turn a propeller. These engines can incorporate speed controls and multiple cylinders, and are capable of powering lightweight scale radio-controlled aircraft. Gasparin and Modela are two recent makers of CO2 engines. CO2, like rubber, is known as &quot;cold&quot; power because it generates no heat.

Steam is even older than rubber power, and like rubber, contributed much to aviation history, but is now rarely used. In 1848, John Stringfellow flew a steam-powered model, in Chard, Somerset, England. Samuel Pierpont Langley built both steam- and internal-combustion-powered models that made long flights.

Baronet Sir George Cayley built, and flew, internal and external combustion gunpowder-fueled model aircraft engines in 1807, 1819, and 1850. These had no crank, working ornithopter-like flappers instead of a propeller. He speculated that the fuel might be too dangerous for manned aircraft.

====Internal combustion====
For larger and heavier models, the most popular powerplant is the glow plug engine. Glow engines are fueled by a mixture of slow burning methanol, nitromethane, and lubricant (castor oil or synthetic oil), which is sold pre-mixed as glow-fuel. Glow-engines require an external starting mechanism; the glow plug must be heated until it is hot enough to ignite fuel to start. Reciprocating cylinders apply torque to a rotating crankshaft, which is the engine&#x27;s primary power-output. Some power is lost from converting linear motion to rotary and in lost heat and unburned fuel, so efficiency is low.

These are rated by engine displacement and range from to over . The smallest engines can spin a propeller to over 30,000 rpm, while the larger engines turn at 10–14,000 rpm.

The simplest glow-engines use the two-stroke cycle. These engines are inexpensive, and offer the highest power-to-weight ratio of all glow-engines, but are noisy and require substantial expansion chamber mufflers, which may be tuned. four-stroke cycle glow engines, whether using poppet valves or more rarely rotary valves are more fuel-efficient, but deliver less power than similar two-stroke engines. The power they deliver is more suited to turning larger diameter propellers for lighter weight, higher drag airframes such as with in biplanes. Four-stroke engines are now popular as they are quieter than two-stroke engines, and are available in horizontally opposed twins and radial engine configurations. Variations include engines with multiple-cylinders, spark-ignition gasoline operation, carbureted diesel operation and variable compression-ratio engines. Diesels are preferred for endurance and have higher torque, and for a given capacity, can &quot;swing&quot; a larger propeller than a glow engine. Home manufacture of model aircraft engines is a hobby in its own right.

====Jets and rockets====

Early &quot;jet&quot; style model aircraft used a multi-blade propeller ducted fan, inside ductwork, usually in the fuselage. The fans were generally powered by 2 stroke engines at high RPM. They generally had displacements, but some were as small as . This fan-in-tube design has been adopted successfully for electric-powered jets while glow engine powered ducted-fan aircraft are now rare. Small jet turbine engines are now used in hobbyist models that resemble simplified versions of the turbojet engines found on commercial aircraft, but are not scaled-down as Reynolds numbers come into play. The first hobbyist-developed turbine was developed and flown in the 1980s but recently have commercial examples become readily available. Turbines require specialized design and precision-manufacturing, and some have been built from car engine turbocharger units. Owning or operating a turbine-powered aircraft is prohibitively expensive and many national clubs (as with the USA&#x27;s Academy of Model Aeronautics) require members to be certified to safely use them. 
V-1 flying bomb type Pulsejet engines have also been used as they offer more thrust in a smaller package than a traditional glow-engine, but are not widely used due to the extremely high noise levels they produce, and are illegal in some countries.

Rocket engines are sometimes used to boost gliders and sailplanes. The earliest purpose-built rocket motor dates back to the 1950s, with the introduction of the Jetex motor, which used solid fuel pellets, ignited by a wick fuse, in a reusable casing. Flyers can now also use single-use model rocket engines to provide a short, under 10 second burst of power. Government restrictions in some countries made rocket-propulsion rare but these were being eased in many places and their use was expanding, however a reclassification from &quot;smoke producing devices&quot; to &quot;fireworks&quot; has made them difficult to obtain again.

====Electric power====

Electric-powered models use an electric motor powered by a source of electricity - usually a battery. Electrical power began being used on models in the 1970s, but the cost delayed widespread use until the early 1990s, when more efficient battery technologies, and brushless motors became available, while the costs of motors, batteries and control systems dropped dramatically. Electric power now predominated with &quot;park-flyer&quot; and &quot;3D-flyer&quot; models, both of which are small and light, where electric-power offers greater efficiency and reliability, less maintenance and mess, quieter flight and near-instantaneous throttle response compared to internal combustion engines.

The first electric models used brushed DC motors and nickel cadmium (NiCad) rechargeable cells that gave flight times of 5 to 10 minutes, while a comparable glow-engine provided double the flight-time. Later electric systems used more-efficient brushless DC motors and higher-capacity nickel metal hydride (NiMh) batteries, yielding considerably improved flight times. Cobalt and lithium polymer batteries (LiPoly or LiPo) permit electric flight-times to surpass those of glow-engines, while the more rugged and durable, cobalt-free lithium iron phosphate batteries are also becoming popular. Solar power has also become practical for R/C hobbyists, and in June 2005 a record flight of 48 hours and 16 minutes was set in California. It is now possible to power most models under with electric power for a cost equivalent to or lower than traditional power sources.

Recent developments have resulted in the use of brushless three-phase motors in model aviation. Brushless motors are more powerful and offer greater torque and efficiency. The design of brushless motors also means less internal friction, as there is no requirement for brushes to be in contact with any rotating parts. This increase in efficiency results in longer flight times.

===Propulsion types===
Most powered model-aircraft, including electric, internal-combustion, and rubber-band powered models, generate thrust by spinning an airscrew. The &quot;propeller&quot; is the most commonly used device. Propellers generate thrust due to lift generated by the wing-like sections of the blades, which forces air backward.

====Propellers====
A large diameter and low-pitch propeller offers greater thrust and acceleration at low airspeed, while a small diameter and higher-pitch propeller sacrifices acceleration for higher maximum speeds. The builder can choose from a selection of propellers to match the model but a mismatched propeller can compromise performance, and if too heavy, cause undue wear on the powerplant. Model aircraft propellers are usually specified as diameter × pitch, in inches. For example, a 5 x 3 propeller has a diameter of , and a pitch of . The pitch is the distance that the propeller would advance if turned through one revolution in a solid medium. Two and three bladed propellers are the most common.

Three methods are used to transfer energy to the propeller:
*&quot;Direct-drive&quot; systems have the propeller attached directly to the engine&#x27;s crankshaft or driveshaft. This arrangement is preferred when the propeller and powerplant both operate near peak efficiency at similar rpms. Direct-drive is most common with fuel-powered engines. Rarely, some electric motors are designed with a sufficiently high &quot;torque&quot; and low enough speed and can utilize direct-drive as well. These motors are typically called &quot;outrunners&quot;.
*&quot;Reduction drive&quot; uses gears to reduce shaft rpm, so the motor can spin much faster. The higher the gear ratio, the slower the prop rotates, which also increases torque by roughly the same ratio. This is common on larger models and on those with unusually large propellers. The reduction drive matches the powerplant and propeller to their respective optimum operating speeds. Geared propellers are rare on internal combustion engines, but are common on electric motors because most electric motors spin extremely fast, but lack torque.
*A built-in 2:1 gear reduction ratio can be obtained by attaching the propeller to the camshaft rather than the crankshaft of a four stroke engine, which runs at half the speed of the crankshaft.

====Ducted fans====
Ducted fans are multi-blade propellers encased in a cylindrical duct or tube that may look like and fit in the same space as jet engine. They are available for both electric and liquid-fuelled engines, although they have become common with recent improvements in electric-flight technology. A model aircraft can now be fitted with four electric ducted fans for less than the cost of a single jet turbine, enabling affordable modelling of multi-engine airplanes. Compared to an unducted propeller, a ducted fan generates more thrust for the same area and speeds of up to have been recorded with electric-powered ducted fan airplanes, largely due to the higher RPMs possible with ducted fan propellers. Ducted fans are popular with scale models of jet aircraft, where they mimic the appearance of jet engines but they are also found on non-scale and sport models, and even lightweight 3D-flyers.
====Other====
With ornithopters the motion of the wing structure imitates the flapping-wings of living birds, producing both thrust and lift.

===Free flight (F1)===
The Wakefield Gold Challenge Cup is an international modelling competition named for the donor, Lord Wakefield. The event was first held on 5 July 1911 at The Crystal Palace in England. There were contests in 1912, 1913 and 1914. No contests were held again until 1927, when the Society of Model Aeronautical Engineers (SMAE) approached Lord Wakefield for a new larger silver trophy for international competition. This trophy is the present Wakefield International Cup and was first awarded in 1928. The SMAE organized the international competitions until 1951 when the FAI took over, and has since been made the award for the rubber-power category at the FAI World Free Flight Championships.
The FAI free flight classes include:
*F1A – Gliders

*F1R – Indoor model aircraft “Micro 35” (provisional)
*F1S – Small electric power model aircraft “E36”

===Control line (F2)===
Also referred to as U-Control in the US, it was pioneered by the late Jim Walker who often, for show, flew three models at a time. Normally the model is flown in a circle and controlled by a pilot in the center holding a handle connected to two thin steel wires. The wires connect through the inboard wing tip of the plane to a mechanism that translates the handle movement to the aircraft elevator, allowing maneuvers to be performed along the aircraft pitch axis. The pilot turns to follow the model going round, the convention being counterclockwise for upright level flight.

For the conventional control-line system, tension in the lines is required to provide control. Line tension is maintained largely by centrifugal force. To increase line tension, models may be built or adjusted in various ways. Rudder offset and thrust vectoring (tilting the engine toward the outside) yaw the model outward. The position where the lines exit the wing can compensate for the tendency of the aerodynamic drag of the lines to yaw the model inboard. Weight on the outside wing, an inside wing that is longer or has more lift than the outside wing (or even no outside wing at all) and the torque of a left rotating propeller (or flying clockwise) tend to roll the model toward the outside. Wing tip weights, propeller torque, and thrust vectoring are more effective when the model is going slowly, while rudder offset and other aerodynamic effects have more influence on a fast moving model.

Since its introduction, control line flying has developed into a competition sport. There are contest categories for control line models, including Speed, Aerobatics (AKA Stunt), Racing, Navy Carrier, Balloon Bust, Scale, and Combat. There are variations on the basic events, including divisions by engine size and type, skill categories, and age of model design.

The events originated largely in the United States, and were later adapted for use internationally. The rules for US Competition are available from the Academy of Model Aeronautics. The international rules are defined by the Fédération Aéronautique Internationale (FAI). World Championships are held semiannually throughout the world, most recently in 2008 in France, with a limited slate of events – special varieties of Racing (F2C or &quot;Team Race&quot;), combat (F2D), and speed (F2A), all limited to engines displacing 0.15 cu. in (2.5cc), and Stunt (F2b), which is essentially unlimited with regard to design and size.

CIAM (FAI Aeromodelling Commission) designated the following classes in the F2 Control Line category:

;F2A : CL Speed
;F2B : CL Aerobatics
;F2C : CL Team racing
The international class of racing is referred to as F2C (F2 = Control-line, C=racing) or Team Race. A pilot and a mechanic compete as a team to fly small wingspan semi-scale racing models over a tarmac or concrete surface. Lines are long.

Three pilots, plus mechanic teams, compete simultaneously in the same circle, and the object is to finish the determined course as fast as possible. Tank size is limited to , requiring 2 or 3 refueling pitstops during the race.

The mechanic stands at a pit area outside the marked flight circle. The engine is started and the model released on the start signal. For refueling, the pilot operates a fuel shutoff by a quick down elevator movement after the planned number of laps so that the model can approach the mechanic at optimum speed, of around . The mechanic catches the model by the wing, fill the tank from a pressurized can by a hose and finger valve, then restart the engine by flicking the propeller with his finger. A pitstop generally takes less than three seconds.

The course is , with 100 laps. Flying speeds are around , which means that the pilots turn one lap in roughly 1.8 seconds. Line pull due to centrifugal force is . An overtaking model is steered over the heads of the competing pilots of slower models.

After two rounds of elimination heats, the 6, 9 or 12 fastest teams enter two semifinal rounds, and the three fastest teams in the semifinals go to the final, which is run over the double course. Single cylinder two-stroke Diesel compression ignition engines designed for this purpose of up to are used. At the world championship level it is common for competitors design and build their own engines. Output power approaches at 25,000 rpm.

====F2D – control line combat====
CLASS F2D - Control Line Combat Model Aircraft - Two pilots compete, with four mechanics in the pit. The aircraft are light and stubby so as to maneuver quickly in the air. Each has a crepe paper streamer attached to the rear of the aircraft by a string. Each pilot attacks only the other aircraft&#x27;s streamer, to attempt to cut it with their propeller or wing. Each cut scores 100 points. Each second the model is in the air scores a point and the match runs for 4 minutes from the starter&#x27;s signal. At the almost speeds of the aircraft, mistakes often lead to crash damage so two aircraft are permitted for each match. The mechanics are prepared for crashes and quickly start the second aircraft and transfer the streamer to the reserve model before launching. The action is so fast that an observer may miss the cuts of the streamers. A second loss eliminates a competitor, and the last pilot still flying wins.

==Model aerodynamics==

The flight behavior of an aircraft depends on the scale to which it is built, the density of the air and the speed of flight.

At subsonic speeds the relationship between these is expressed by the Reynolds number. Where two models at different scales are flown with the same Reynolds number, the airflow is similar. Where the Reynolds numbers differ, as for example a small-scale model flying at lower speed than the full-size craft, the airflow characteristics can differ significantly. This can make an exact scale model unflyable, and the model has to be modified in some way. For example, at low Reynolds numbers, a flying scale model usually requires a larger-than-scale propeller.

Maneuverability depends on scale, with stability also becoming more important. Control torque is proportional to lever arm length while angular inertia is proportional to the square of the lever arm, so the smaller the scale the more quickly an aircraft or other vehicle turns in response to control inputs or outside forces.

One consequence of this is that models in general require additional longitudinal and directional stability, resisting sudden changes in pitch and yaw. While it may be possible for a pilot to respond quickly enough to control an unstable aircraft, a radio control scale model of the same aircraft would be flyable only with design adjustments such as increased tail surfaces and wing dihedral for stability, or with avionics providing artificial stability. Free flight models need to have both static and dynamic stability. Static stability is the resistance to sudden changes in pitch and yaw already described, and is typically provided by the horizontal and vertical tail surfaces respectively, and by a forward center of gravity. Dynamic stability is the ability to return to straight and level flight without any control input. The three dynamic instability modes are pitch (phugoid) oscillation, spiral and Dutch roll. An aircraft with too large a horizontal tail on a fuselage that is too short may have a phugoid instability with increasing climbs and dives. With free flight models, this usually results in a stall or loop at the end of the initial climb. Insufficient dihedral or sweep back generally leads to increasing spiral turn. Too much dihedral or sweepback generally causes Dutch roll. These all depend on the scale, as well as details of the shape and weight distribution. For example, the paper glider shown here is a contest winner when made of a small sheet of paper but goes from side to side in Dutch roll when scaled up even slightly.

<text>The Flaming Lips are an American psychedelic rock band formed in 1983 in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma. The band currently consists of Wayne Coyne (vocals, guitars, bass, keyboards), Steven Drozd (guitars, bass, keyboards, drums, vocals), Derek Brown (keyboards, guitars, percussion), Matt Duckworth Kirksey (drums, percussion, keyboards) and Tommy McKenzie (bass). Coyne and Drozd have remained the band&#x27;s only consistent members since 1991, with Coyne being the only remaining founding member following the departure of bassist and keyboardist Michael Ivins in 2021.

The group recorded several albums and EPs on an indie label, Restless, in the 1980s and early 1990s. After signing to Warner Brothers they released &quot;Hit to Death in the Future Head&quot; (1992), followed by &quot;Transmissions from the Satellite Heart&quot; (1993) and the hit single &quot;She Don&#x27;t Use Jelly&quot; which broke the band into the mainstream. They later released &quot;The Soft Bulletin&quot; (1999), which was &quot;NME&quot; magazine&#x27;s Album of the Year, followed by the critically acclaimed &quot;Yoshimi Battles the Pink Robots&quot; (2002). In February 2007, they were nominated for a BRIT Award for &quot;Best International Act&quot;. The group has won three Grammy Awards, including two for Best Rock Instrumental Performance. They were placed on &quot;Q&quot; magazine&#x27;s list of the &quot;50 Bands to See Before You Die&quot; in 2002.

==History==

===Early history and releases (1983–1990)===
The Flaming Lips formed in Oklahoma City in 1983 with Wayne Coyne on guitar, his brother Mark singing lead vocals, Michael Ivins on bass and Dave Kotska on drums. The band debuted at Oklahoma City&#x27;s Blue Note Lounge. After they hired Dave Kotska as the drummer, Richard English joined the band in 1984. That same year they recorded &quot;The Flaming Lips&quot; EP, their only release with Mark singing lead vocals.

There are several theories as to how the band chose their name. One possibility is that it was inspired by the 1953 feature film &quot;Geraldine&quot;, in which comedian Stan Freberg sings several songs, including one named &quot;Flaming Lips&quot;. Another possible source is from the 1964 Shirley MacLaine film &quot;What a Way to Go!&quot; in which Gene Kelly&#x27;s character stars in a film titled &quot;Flaming Lips&quot;. However, according to an article in the September 16, 1993, issue of Rolling Stone, Mark and Wayne came up with the name as a reference to a rumor about a classmate who contracted genital herpes after receiving cunnilingus from a partner with active cold sores. Wayne elaborated:When Mark and I were in, I think it was Junior Year in High School, there was a rumor about this girl who got herpes from this guy at a party. He went down on her with a cold sore. I don&#x27;t think we knew the girl, and I&#x27;m not sure if she even existed, you know how kids just spread bullshit. But when we were thinking of band names one night over a pack of Schlitz and some left-handed cigarettes and remembered how we joked that they both had &quot;Flaming Lips&quot; and it just stuck.After his brother&#x27;s departure, Wayne assumed the vocal duties and the band recorded their first full-length album, &quot;Hear It Is&quot;, on Pink Dust Records (the psychedelic-rock imprint of Enigma Records) in London&#x27;s Southern Studios, in 1986. This line-up recorded two more albums: 1987&#x27;s &quot;Oh My Gawd!!!&quot; and 1989&#x27;s &quot;Telepathic Surgery&quot;, the latter originally planned to be a 30-minute sound collage.

Drummer Nathan Roberts replaced English and guitarist Jonathan Donahue (also a member of the alternative rock band Mercury Rev) joined in 1989. &quot;In a Priest Driven Ambulance&quot;, their first album with producer Dave Fridmann, was recorded at the State University of New York in Fredonia for $5 an hour on a $10,000 budget. The album was host to a marked expansion in the band&#x27;s sound and their previous experiments in tape loops and effects were given a more prominent role. During this period, Coyne made his transition to a higher, more strained vocal style akin to Neil Young, which he first used on &quot;Telepathic Surgery&#x27;s&quot; &quot;Chrome Plated Suicide&quot; and has employed ever since.

In 1990, the band caught the attention of Warner Bros. Records and was signed promptly after a label representative witnessed a show at which the band almost burned down the venue (American Legion Hall in Norman, Oklahoma) with the use of pyrotechnics.

===Signed to Warner Bros. (&quot;Hit to Death in the Future Head&quot; to &quot;Clouds Taste Metallic&quot;) (1991–1996)===
In 1991, the band started recording their major label debut &quot;Hit to Death in the Future Head&quot;. The album&#x27;s release was halted for nearly a year because of the use of a sample from Michael Kamen&#x27;s score for the film &quot;Brazil&quot; in the track &quot;You Have to Be Joking (Autopsy of the Devil&#x27;s Brain)&quot;, which required a lengthy clearance process. After the recording of this album, Donahue left the band to concentrate on Mercury Rev, and Roberts left the band as well, citing creative differences. They were replaced by Ronald Jones and Steven Drozd, respectively.

In 1993, they released &quot;Transmissions from the Satellite Heart&quot;. This was the only studio album since &quot;In a Priest Driven Ambulance&quot;, to date, in which Dave Fridmann has not been involved. Because of the success of the album and the single &quot;She Don&#x27;t Use Jelly&quot;, the band was featured on four popular television series: &quot;Beverly Hills, 90210&quot;, &quot;Late Show with David Letterman&quot;, &quot;Charmed&quot; and &quot;Beavis and Butt-head&quot;. The success of this record led to long stints of touring, opening for bands including Red Hot Chili Peppers and Candlebox.

&quot;Clouds Taste Metallic&quot; was released to much critical fanfare in late 1995, though it did not achieve the commercial success of its predecessor. The strain of the year-long &quot;Clouds&quot; tour, added to the stress from the three years touring in support of &quot;Transmissions&quot;, was a major factor in the departure of Jones in late 1996. He was said to be suffering from a severe case of agoraphobia, although the documentary &quot;Fearless Freaks&quot; states that he left because of his growing concerns over Drozd&#x27;s drug use.

In September 2014, the band paid tribute to Jones and the impact his music had on their developing sound by performing &quot;Transmissions from the Satellite Heart&quot; live at First Avenue. In February 2015, they performed &quot;Clouds Taste Metallic&quot; at the same venue. Later, in December, a 20th anniversary box set called &quot;Heady Nuggs: 20 Years After Clouds Taste Metallic 1994–1997&quot;, was released.

===&quot;Zaireeka&quot; (1997–1998)===
The departure of Jones and a general dissatisfaction with standard &quot;rock&quot; music led to the three remaining members of the group redefining the direction of the band with the experimental &quot;Zaireeka&quot; (1997), a four-CD album which is intended to be heard by playing all four CDs in four separate CD players simultaneously. The music incorporated both traditional musical elements and &quot;found&quot; sounds (as in musique concrète), often heavily manipulated with recording studio electronics.

As part of the development of this project, the band conducted a series of &quot;parking lot experiments&quot; and then later, &quot;boombox experiments&quot;. In the parking lot experiments up to 40 volunteers were given cassettes created by the band to be played at a parking lot in their cars&#x27; stereo systems simultaneously. In the &quot;boom box experiments&quot; an orchestra composed of up to 40 volunteers with modified &quot;boombox&quot;-type tape players was &quot;conducted&quot; – directed to vary the volume, speed or tone of the tape they were playing (again composed by the band) – by Wayne Coyne.

Meanwhile, a series of unfortunate events (recounted in the 1999 song &quot;The Spiderbite Song&quot;) beset the band. Drozd&#x27;s arm was almost amputated needlessly because of what he claimed was a spider bite (it turned out to be abscessed as a result of Drozd&#x27;s heroin use), Ivins was trapped in his car for several hours after a wheel spun off of another vehicle into his windshield, and Coyne&#x27;s father died after a long battle with cancer.

===Mainstream breakthrough (&quot;The Soft Bulletin&quot; and &quot;Yoshimi Battles the Pink Robots&quot;) (1999–2002)===
Though their experimental endeavors received some press coverage, their real breakthrough came with the 1999 release, &quot;The Soft Bulletin&quot;. Marrying more traditional catchy melodies with synthetic strings, hypnotic, carefully manipulated beats, booming cymbals and oddball but philosophical lyrics (sung much more strongly than on earlier releases), the album quickly became one of the underground hits of the year, even widely considered to be one of the best albums of the entire decade.

Compared by many music critics to the Beach Boys&#x27; &quot;Pet Sounds&quot; because of its inclusion of harmonies and orchestrated sounds, &quot;The Soft Bulletin&quot; also featured greater use of synthesizers, drum machines, sound effects and more studio manipulation. After this album was released, Coyne stated that, &quot;if someone was to ask me what instrument do I play, I would say the recording studio.&quot; As the band considered an attempt to recreate this complex album live solely with additional musicians to be complex and expensive, they decided to tour as a three-piece and make extensive use of pre-recorded music to fill out those parts that were not performed live by the members of the band. This led to the decision to have Drozd play primarily keyboards and guitar live instead of the drums. The band utilized video recordings and projections of Drozd playing the drums for some of the band&#x27;s older songs. The band later added Kliph Scurlock on drums and percussion, with Drozd focusing on guitars, keyboards, bass (when he played bass, Ivins played keyboards), and occasional vocals. When Drozd sung, Coyne played guitars, keyboards and theremin.

To enhance the live experience for their audience and to accurately reproduce the sound of &quot;The Soft Bulletin&quot; live, the Lips devised the concept of the &quot;Headphone Concert&quot;. A low-powered FM transmitter was set up at shows, and the concert was simultaneously broadcast to small Walkman-style receivers and headphones made available for free to audience members. This would, in theory, allow the audiences greater sonic clarity while still feeling the power of a full live P.A. This concept was debuted in Dallas, Texas, and at the South by Southwest conference in Austin, Texas, in March 1999, and was subsequently used on the &quot;International Music Against Brain Degeneration Revue&quot; tour. This tour featured Japanese band Cornelius, Sebadoh, Robyn Hitchcock, Sonic Boom&#x27;s E.A.R. and IQU.

Three years later, in the summer of 2002, the Flaming Lips joined bands Cake and Modest Mouse on the Unlimited Sunshine Tour. They also released the full-length &quot;Yoshimi Battles the Pink Robots&quot; to much critical acclaim. Featuring guest musician Yoshimi P-We (who inspired the album&#x27;s title track) and demonstrating more use of electronic instruments and computer manipulation than &quot;The Soft Bulletin&quot;, &quot;Yoshimi&quot; is widely considered to be the Flaming Lips&#x27; first critical &quot;and&quot; commercial success after nearly twenty years as a band. The final track on the album, &quot;Approaching Pavonis Mons by Balloon (Utopia Planitia)&quot;, earned a 2003 Grammy Award for Best Rock Instrumental Performance, and the album was certified gold on April 10, 2006. In March 2007, the band revealed that they had recently teamed up with screenwriter Aaron Sorkin to produce a Broadway musical based on the album.

In January 2012, Pitchfork TV released a forty-five-minute documentary on &quot;The Soft Bulletin&quot;. The documentary featured several rare archival photos and videos along with interviews from the members, producer Dave Fridmann, and manager Scott Booker. The same year, &quot;Yoshimi Battles the Pink Robots&quot; was adapted into a musical after being in development for years after the album&#x27;s release.

Both &quot;The Soft Bulletin&quot; and &quot;Yoshimi Battles the Pink Robots&quot; have been released on DVD-Audio.

Following the success of &quot;Yoshimi&quot;, Steven Drozd completed rehab for heroin addiction. This decision was spurred by a physical altercation between Drozd and Wayne Coyne.

===Continued success (&quot;At War with the Mystics&quot;) (2002–2006)===
Shortly after &quot;Yoshimi&quot; and &quot;The Soft Bulletin&quot;, the Flaming Lips released two EPs in the same vein of their previous album&#x27;s robotic theme which contain remixed songs from &quot;Yoshimi&quot;, &quot;Fight Test&quot; and &quot;Ego Tripping at the Gates of Hell&quot;. They also appeared on the track &quot;Marching the Hate Machines (Into the Sun)&quot; on the Thievery Corporation album &quot;The Cosmic Game&quot;. In 2002 they were invited to work with the Chemical Brothers. Steven Drozd performed lead vocals, while Wayne Coyne performed harmony vocals, on the single &quot;The Golden Path&quot;, which was included on the Chemical Brothers compilation album, &quot;Singles 93-03&quot;.

In 2002, they performed as the opening act, as well as the backup band, for singer Beck on his &quot;Sea Change&quot; tour. In the summer of 2004, it was announced that the Flaming Lips would appear among the headliners on the 2004 Lollapalooza tour, alongside such artists as Sonic Youth and Morrissey; however, the tour was canceled because of lack of revenue. Also in 2004, the band recorded the song &quot;SpongeBob and Patrick Confront the Psychic Wall of Energy&quot; for the soundtrack of &quot;The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie&quot;. Following the concerts&#x27; cancellation, the band entered Tarbox Road Studio with producer Dave Fridmann and began work on their eleventh album, the more organic-sounding &quot;At War with the Mystics&quot;. The record, aimed to be a more guitar-based and heavier effort than recent albums, featured more politically conscious lyrics than any of their previous releases, and was released in April 2006 to a mixed yet mostly positive reception.

In 2005 the band was the subject of a documentary called &quot;Fearless Freaks&quot;, featuring appearances by other artists and celebrities such as Gibby Haynes, the White Stripes, Beck, Christina Ricci, Liz Phair, Juliette Lewis, Steve Burns, Starlight Mints, and Adam Goldberg. In that same year, the Flaming Lips contributed a version of &quot;Bohemian Rhapsody&quot; to the album &quot;Killer Queen: A Tribute to Queen&quot;. Also in this year, the Flaming Lips released the DVD &quot;VOID (Video Overview in Deceleration)&quot;, which chronicles all of their ventures into music video that have been produced since they signed with Warner Bros in 1991. In October 2005, the Flaming Lips recorded a cover of &quot;If I Only Had a Brain&quot; for the soundtrack of the video game &quot;Stubbs the Zombie&quot;, which features modern rock bands covering songs from the 1950s and 1960s. Additionally, the band released one new song, &quot;Mr. Ambulance Driver&quot;, for the soundtrack of the 2005 film &quot;Wedding Crashers&quot; (a slightly edited version of the song found its way onto the new record).

The band released two singles from &quot;At War With the Mystics&quot;: &quot;The W.A.N.D.&quot;, which was featured in a Dell commercial and which was originally put out as a download-only single in early 2006, and &quot;The Yeah Yeah Yeah Song&quot;, which became their highest-charting single on the UK Singles Chart, peaking at No. 16. A 4-track EP, entitled &quot;It Overtakes Me&quot;, was released later in the UK that year. The only instrumental on the album, &quot;The Wizard Turns On... The Giant Silver Flashlight and Puts on His Werewolf Moccasins&quot;, earned a 2006 Grammy Award for Best Rock Instrumental Performance, making it twice in a row the Lips have been nominated in that category and won.

Following the April 4, 2006, release of &quot;At War with the Mystics&quot;, the band began a tour to support the album in the United Kingdom, including a finale at the Royal Albert Hall and performances at the O2 Wireless Festival. At the Leeds England date of the festival, the band opened for the Who, of whom they are long standing fans.
The band continued to tour throughout the fall of 2006 stopping in Montreal, the Virgin Festival on the Toronto Islands, Atlantic City&#x27;s House of Blues, The University of Vermont in Burlington, their hometown Oklahoma City, the Austin City Limits Music Festival in Austin, Texas, and New York City, NY as well as several other cities. The homecoming show in Oklahoma City was performed at the Zoo Amphitheater and included the unveiling of a new UFO stage prop, and would provide footage for the U.F.O.s at the Zoo concert DVD.

In November 2006 then mayor of Oklahoma City Mick Cornett proposed naming a downtown alley after the band. Vince Gill and Charlie Christian were also to be given street names by the city. Flaming Lips Alley is at the center of Oklahoma City&#x27;s entertainment district, Bricktown. At the official dedication in 2007, Coyne said of Oklahoma City, &quot;...We&#x27;re on the way to becoming, I think, the fucking coolest city in America.&quot;

===&quot;Christmas on Mars&quot; (2008)===
In 2001, the Flaming Lips began filming a low-budget indie film entitled &quot;Christmas on Mars&quot;. Filming for the movie ended in late September 2005 and premiered on May 25, 2008, at the Sasquatch! Music Festival. The film tells the story of the first Christmas of a colony set-up on the surface of Mars and was written by Wayne Coyne, and co-directed by Wayne Coyne, Bradley Beesley and George Salisbury, with the band and their friends acting in the movie.

The band brought the film to rock festivals across America during the summer of 2008 and screened it in a large circus tent they had bought for that purpose. The film was released on DVD on November 11, 2008, along with a soundtrack written and performed by the Flaming Lips.

The band released their first live concert DVD, &quot;UFO&#x27;s at the Zoo: The Legendary Concert in Oklahoma City&quot;, on August 7, 2007. The band also contributed original songs to the soundtracks of several 2007 films, including &quot;The Supreme Being Teaches Spider-Man How to be in Love&quot; for &quot;Spider-Man 3&quot;, &quot;I Was Zapped by the Super Lucky Rainbow&quot; for &quot;Good Luck Chuck&quot;, &quot;Love the World You Find&quot; for &quot;Mr. Magorium&#x27;s Wonder Emporium&quot;, and &quot;Maybe I&#x27;m Not the One&quot; and &quot;Tale of the Horny Frog&quot; for &quot;The Heartbreak Kid&quot;.

===Official rock song of Oklahoma (2009)===
In March 2009 &quot;Do You Realize??&quot; was announced as the official rock song of Oklahoma. Ten choices were put to a public vote, and out of 21,000 votes cast nearly 51% were for &quot;Do You Realize??&quot; The Oklahoma Senate approved this choice unanimously. The Oklahoma House of Representatives failed to confirm the choice after Rep. Mike Reynolds, R-Oklahoma City attacked the band for its use of offensive language, and Rep. Corey Holland, R-Marlow said he had been &quot;really offended&quot; when Michael Ivins came to the announcement ceremony in March wearing a red T-shirt with a yellow hammer and sickle. However, that evening, Oklahoma governor Brad Henry announced he would sign an executive order naming the song the official rock song. Henry said that for more than 20 years the Flaming Lips have produced &quot;creative, fun and provocative rock music.&quot; &quot;The music of the Flaming Lips has earned Grammys, glowing critical acclaim and fans all over the world&quot;, the governor said. &quot;A truly iconic rock n&#x27; roll band, they are proud ambassadors of their home state... They were clearly the people&#x27;s choice, and I intend to honor that vote.&quot; However, it was revealed in 2013 that Republican governor Mary Fallin removed this designation by not renewing Brad Henry&#x27;s executive order upon taking office in 2011. An alley in Oklahoma City had been named for the band in 2006.

===&quot;Embryonic&quot; and &quot;Dark Side of the Moon&quot; (2009)===
In 2009, the band released their twelfth studio album and first double album, &quot;Embryonic&quot;. The album, which was the band&#x27;s first to open in the &quot;Billboard&quot; top 10, was widely critically acclaimed for its new direction; late in the recording the band added Derek Brown on keyboards, percussion and guitar. In December of the same year, the band released their second album of the year and thirteenth overall, &quot;The Flaming Lips and Stardeath and White Dwarfs with Henry Rollins and Peaches Doing The Dark Side of the Moon&quot;, a track-for-track cover of Pink Floyd&#x27;s &quot;The Dark Side of the Moon&quot;, which was recorded with Stardeath and White Dwarfs and features guest appearances from Henry Rollins and Peaches. The album was released physically on vinyl and CD in 2010.

In 2010, the band performed &quot;I Can Be a Frog&quot; on the Nick Jr. television series &quot;Yo Gabba Gabba!&quot;.

===2011 releases===
In January 2011, the Lips announced their intention of releasing a new song every month of the year. In February, they released the first track titled &quot;Two Blobs Fucking&quot;. The song exists as 12 separate pieces on YouTube and must be played simultaneously to be heard as intended.

In March 2011, the Lips released the EP &quot;The Flaming Lips with Neon Indian&quot;. 
In April, the band released the &quot;Gummy Song Skull&quot; EP, a seven-pound skull made of gummy bear material with a gummy brain, which contained a flashdrive with 4 songs on them. This release was extremely limited, but was soon leaked on the internet shortly after its release.

In May, the band released its second collaboration EP titled &quot;The Flaming Lips with Prefuse 73&quot;. It contains four songs and was released in a similar way to the earlier Neon Indian EP, in that the run was extremely limited and consisted of randomly colored, one of a kind discs. This EP was briefly available on the band&#x27;s official website but sold out shortly after it was put up for sale.

June saw several releases by the band, the first being &quot;The Soft Bulletin: Live la Fantastique de Institution 2011&quot;, a live-in-studio recording of the band&#x27;s 1999 album &quot;The Soft Bulletin&quot; which was on a flash drive embedded in a marijuana-flavored brain inside a strawberry flavored gummy skull. This was only released at the band&#x27;s two night show at the Hollywood Forever Cemetery on June 14 and 15. This show was a special two-night, one morning event in which they played the entirety of &quot;The Soft Bulletin&quot; one night and a new revamped version of &quot;The Dark Side of the Moon&quot; and collaborated with Edward Sharpe and the Magnetic Zeros for a performance of &quot;Do You Realize??&quot; at dawn of the second day. Also included on this flash drive was a best-of compilation titled &quot;Everyone You Know Someday Will Die&quot;. It included songs from every portion of the band&#x27;s career as well as a newly recorded intro. The final June release was the &quot;Gummy Song Fetus&quot; EP which consisted of three songs on a flash drive embedded in a bubblegum-flavored fetus made of gummy bear material.

In July, the band released &quot;The Flaming Lips with Lightning Bolt&quot;, a collaborative EP with experimental rock group Lightning Bolt, featuring the songs &quot;I Wanna Get High But I Don&#x27;t Want Brain Damage&quot; and &quot;Working at NASA on Acid&quot;. This EP was released on randomly colored vinyl as with the previous two collaborative EPs.

In late August, the band announced that it would be recording a six-hour-long song titled &quot;I Found a Star on the Ground&quot;. This, along with two other songs, was released in September packaged with a set of spinning discs with animations on them. This release is officially called &quot;Strobo Trip&quot;. Featured in &quot;I Found a Star on the Ground&quot; is Sean Lennon who, with his band, opened for the Lips in early 2011. In the song Lennon reads off several lists of names of people who donated $100 to the Oklahoma City SPCA and Academy of Contemporary Music at University of Central Oklahoma. 212 names are featured in the song.

At midnight October 31, 2011, a 24-hour song was released titled &quot;7 Skies H3&quot;. The song played live on a never-ending audio stream on a special website set up by the band and was made available for purchase as a hard drive encased in an actual human skull, limited to 13 copies.

The band&#x27;s last release of 2011 was a 12&quot; EP collaboration, The Flaming Lips with Yoko Ono/Plastic Ono Band, sold only at the band&#x27;s annual New Years shows in Oklahoma City.

===&quot;Heady Fwends&quot;, Guinness World Record and other collaborations (2012)===
With their previous contract with Warner Bros. Records having expired in 2011, the band re-signed to Warner Bros. for the United States and to Bella Union in Europe in early 2012. The first release under these new deals was &quot;The Flaming Lips and Heady Fwends&quot;, initially released as a limited edition vinyl-only package for Record Store Day on April 21. The album features collaborations with artists such as Kesha, Nick Cave, and Erykah Badu. In an interview with American Songwriter, Coyne stated that &quot;Since we were releasing music every month, we thought it would be a little bit boring for us each month to say &#x27;Well here&#x27;s four more Flaming Lips songs.&#x27; We just thought &#x27;Well we&#x27;ll get some of our friends, and we&#x27;ll do collaborations and see what happens.&#x27;&quot; The album later received a wider release on CD and digitally on June 26 in the US and July 30 in Europe.

The Flaming Lips broke Jay-Z&#x27;s Guinness World Record for the most live concerts (8) in 24 hours, on June 27 and 28, 2012. The attempt was part of the O Music Awards, and was Livestreamed online for the entire 24 hours. The attempt started in Memphis on the afternoon of June 27 and ended in New Orleans on the afternoon of June 28, with 20 minutes to spare. The band played with guests including Grace Potter and the Nocturnals, Neon Indian, Linear Downfall and Phantogram and HOTT MT, among others.

The concerts, which were required to be at least 15 minutes long, as per Guinness rules, featured a mix of special covers, songs rarely or never performed live by the band before, and new songs from &quot;Heady Fwends&quot;.

In November 2012 the band&#x27;s Lovely Sorts of Death Records released a collaborative track-by-track reinterpretation of King Crimson&#x27;s &quot;In the Court of the Crimson King&quot; with Stardeath and White Dwarfs, Linear Downfall, New Fumes, and Space Face entitled &quot;Playing Hide and Seek with the Ghosts of Dawn&quot; on vinyl and on their own &#x27;Satellite Heart Radio&#x27; website.

They also worked on Kesha&#x27;s &quot;Warrior&quot; album (on &quot;Past Lives&quot;) and &quot;Lipsha&quot;. She also featured on their collaborative albums.

===&quot;The Terror&quot; (2013–2014)===
The band&#x27;s next studio album, titled &quot;The Terror&quot;, was originally due for release on April 2, 2013, in the US and on April 1 in Europe, the tour began with a new member: keyboardist and guitarist Jake Ingalls, Derek Brown focused on percussion and additional guitars and keyboards. Because of a corruption while mastering the record on vinyl, the US release was delayed for two weeks, until April 16.

In anticipation of the album&#x27;s release, their song, &quot;Sun Blows Up Today&quot;, was featured in a Hyundai Super Bowl XLVII commercial. The band also released a lyric video on for &quot;Sun Blows Up Today&quot; with animations created by long-time Lips collaborator George Salisbury. The band premiered the new album live at a free outdoor concert at SXSW on March 15, 2013.

Critical reception of the album has tended to focus on its thematic bleakness and the turgid noisiness of its instrumentation. Like the three albums often referred to as &quot;a trilogy&quot; accounting for the majority of the band&#x27;s mainstream production over the past 15 years (consisting of &quot;The Soft Bulletin&quot;, &quot;Yoshimi Battles the Pink Robots&quot;, and &quot;At War With the Mystics&quot;), &quot;The Terror&quot; adheres to the love story/space opera narrative structure while taking a much darker approach. As noted in a review by Pitchfork, &quot;&quot;The Terror&quot; deals in more personal turmoil– loneliness, depression, anxiety... Perhaps not coincidentally, the album was preceded by news of Coyne&#x27;s separation from his partner of 25 years, Michelle, and of multi-instrumentalist Steven Drozd relapsing temporarily.&quot;

Jon Pareles of &quot;The New York Times&quot; summarized the thematic content of the album fairly succinctly when he wrote, &quot;The lyrics [of &#x27;The Terror&#x27;] find cosmic repercussions in a lovers&#x27; breakup; loneliness turns to contemplation of grim human compulsions and the end of the universe.&quot; Another critic goes so far as to say that the album underlines the Lacanian psychodynamics structurally inherent in the conventions of the space opera.

Wayne Coyne&#x27;s own description of his process or the theme of the album jibes well with this critical diagnosis:

&quot;We want, or wanted, to believe that without love we would disappear, that love, somehow, would save us that, yeah, if we have love, give love and know love, we are truly alive and if there is no love, there would be no life. The Terror is, we know now, that even without love, life goes on... we just go on... there is no mercy killing.&quot;

In November 2013 they produced and curated &quot;The Time Has Come to Shoot You Down…What a Sound&quot;, a reworking of the Stone Roses&#x27; debut album featuring New Fumes, Spaceface, Stardeath and White Dwarfs, Foxygen, Peaking Lights, Poliça and others.

In March 2014, longtime drummer and percussionist Kliph Scurlock left the band and was replaced by drummer, percussionist, and keyboardist Matt Duckworth Kirksey and percussionist and drummer Nicholas Ley. Derek Brown began focusing on guitars and occasional keyboards and percussion. In May, Scurlock claimed he had been fired for negative comments about Wayne Coyne&#x27;s friend Christina Fallin, the daughter of Oklahoma&#x27;s governor and leader of a band called Pink Pony. Fallin had recently been criticized for cultural appropriation after she wore a Native American headdress in a publicity photo. According to Scurlock, his criticism of Fallin&#x27;s actions led to conflict with Coyne and his dismissal. In response, Drozd said, &quot;[t]his Lips/Kliph bullshit has gone too far. We parted ways because of the usual band musical differences. The rest has been blown way out.&quot; Coyne went even further, calling Scurlock a &quot;pathological liar&quot; and stated that he never meant his defense of Fallin, which included posting a photo of his dog in a feathered headdress, to be offensive but that he was &quot;very sorry, to anybody that is following my Instagram or my Twitter, if I offended anybody of any religion, any race, any belief system. I would say you shouldn&#x27;t follow my tweets; you shouldn&#x27;t even probably want to be a Flaming Lips fan because we don&#x27;t really have any agenda.&quot;

===&quot;Miley Cyrus &amp; Her Dead Petz&quot; (2015)===

On August 30, 2015, after hosting the 2015 MTV Video Music Awards, Miley Cyrus announced that &quot;Miley Cyrus &amp; Her Dead Petz&quot;, the free, 23-track experimental album that Cyrus and the Flaming Lips wrote and recorded together, was available via online streaming. The album is described by Coyne as a combination of Pink Floyd and Portishead and &quot;a slightly wiser, sadder, more true version&quot; of Cyrus&#x27; pop music output.

===&quot;Oczy Mlody&quot;, &quot;King&#x27;s Mouth&quot;, and &quot;American Head&quot; (2016–present)===
According to the Tarbox Roads Studio&#x27;s website, the Flaming Lips began recording a new album with Dave Fridmann on January 27, 2016.
In a June interview with Danish music blog Regnsky, Wayne Coyne said that a new album would come out in January 2017, even though they had originally planned for it to be released in October 2016. Wayne Coyne later confirmed in a September interview with &quot;Consequence of Sound&quot;, that they would release a new album at the beginning of 2017. On October 20, the band confirmed the January 2017 release date for the album. The band embarked on a tour in support that was described as &quot;rock&#x27;s greatest acid punch party&quot; with &quot;balloons, confetti cannons and rainbow visuals&quot;. On January 13, 2017, the fourteenth Flaming Lips album &quot;Oczy Mlody&quot; was released, and featured a guest appearance by Miley Cyrus. The album charted in both the UK and US.

On Record Store Day, April 22, 2017, the Flaming Lips released &quot;Onboard the International Space Station Concert for Peace&quot;, a re-recording of seven tracks from &quot;Oczy Mlody&quot; in a faux live setting.

The band&#x27;s next studio album, &quot;King&#x27;s Mouth&quot;, was released on April 13, 2019, for Record Store Day. Mick Jones of the Clash and Big Audio Dynamite narrates the album; Wayne Coyne said of Jones that &quot;he’s on almost every song... it really is quite unbelievable.&quot;

In late 2019, Coyne and Drozd collaborated with garage rock duo Deap Vally to form a new band, Deap Lips. The project&#x27;s self-titled debut album was released on March 13, 2020.

On March 23, 2020, Drozd announced that the band&#x27;s sixteenth studio album, &quot;American Head&quot;, was due for release in the summer. The band officially announced the album&#x27;s release date as September 11, 2020, along with the single &quot;My Religion Is You&quot; on June 6, 2020.

During the COVID-19 pandemic, the band performed a concert in their hometown of Oklahoma City on October 12, 2020, while entirely encased within inflatable human-sized bubbles. Audience members were also protected by plastic bubbles. They performed in this fashion on &quot;The Late Show with Stephen Colbert&quot; and again in 2021. In 2022, &quot;The Flaming Lips Space Bubble Film&quot;, a documentary film covering these experimental concerts was released.

On August 16, 2021, Jake Ingalls announced on his Instagram page that he left the band on amicable terms. Also in August, Coyne commented on his Instagram that Michael Ivins was no longer in the band, leaving Coyne as the only original member. Micah Nelson has been on bass for recent live performances. He was soon replaced by Tommy McKenzie, who joined the band later in 2021.

In November 2021, the band released &quot;Where the Viaduct Looms&quot;, featuring 13-year old Canadian musician Nell Smith. The album covers nine songs by the Australian musician Nick Cave. Smith died in a car accident on October 6, 2024, at the age of 17.
