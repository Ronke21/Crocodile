<text>Daniel Handler (born February 28, 1970) is an American author, musician, screenwriter, television writer, and television producer. He is best known for his children&#x27;s book series &quot;A Series of Unfortunate Events&quot; and &quot;All the Wrong Questions&quot;, published under the pen name Lemony Snicket. The former was adapted into a film in 2004, as well as a Netflix series from 2017 to 2019.

Handler has published adult novels and a stage play under his real name, along with other children&#x27;s books under the Snicket pseudonym. His first book, a satirical fiction piece titled &quot;The Basic Eight&quot;, was rejected by many publishers for its dark subject matter.

Handler has also played the accordion in several bands, and appeared on the album &quot;69 Love Songs&quot; by indie pop band The Magnetic Fields.

==Life==
Handler was born in San Francisco, California, the son of Sandra Handler (née Walpole), a retired City College of San Francisco dean, and Louis Handler, an accountant. His father was a Jewish refugee from Germany in 1939. His mother is distantly related to British writer Hugh Walpole. Of his early religious upbringing, Handler said, &quot;I had a fairly standard Reform Jewish upbringing, I guess, in terms of the religious side of it.&quot; He has a younger sister, Rebecca Handler. He attended Commodore Sloat Elementary, Herbert Hoover Middle School, and Lowell High School. He graduated from Wesleyan University in 1992. He was awarded the 1992 Connecticut Student Poet Prize, which he has said he won by ripping off Elizabeth Bishop. He is an alumnus of the San Francisco Boys Chorus.

Handler has been a voracious reader since childhood. The first book he bought as a child was &quot;The Blue Aspic&quot; by Edward Gorey, of whom he is a fan. He enjoyed the writings of William Maxwell and Roald Dahl.

He is married to Lisa Brown, an illustrator he met in college. They have a child, born in 2003. They live in an Edwardian house in San Francisco.

Handler has expressed ambivalence about his wealth and the expectations it creates. He often donates money to charitable causes. Handler and his wife have also donated $1,000,000 to Planned Parenthood, and he has supported the Occupy Wall Street movement.

Handler describes himself as a secular humanist and an atheist. He describes himself as having developed a &quot;feminist consciousness&quot; while in college.

==Professional work==
===Books===
Six of Handler&#x27;s major works have been published under his name. His first, &quot;The Basic Eight&quot;, was rejected by many publishers for its subject matter and tone (a dark view of a teenage girl&#x27;s life). Handler has said the novel was rejected 37 times before being published in 1999.

&quot;Watch Your Mouth,&quot; his second novel, was completed before publication of &quot;The Basic Eight&quot;. It follows a more operatic theme, complete with stage directions and various acts. &quot;Watch Your Mouth&quot;″s second half replaces the opera troupe with the form of a 12-step recovery program, linguistically undergone by the protagonist. In April 2005, Handler published &quot;Adverbs&quot;, a collection of short stories that he says are &quot;about love.&quot; It was followed in 2011 by &quot;Why We Broke Up&quot;, which received a 2012 Michael L. Printz honor award. Handler&#x27;s 2015 novel &quot;We Are Pirates&quot; is about a modern-age pirate who &quot;wants to be an old-fashioned kind of pirate.&quot; His most recent novel, &quot;All the Dirty Parts&quot;, was published in 2017 and &quot;takes the blunt and constant presence of a male teen&#x27;s sexuality and considers it with utmost seriousness&quot;.

Handler served as a judge for the PEN/Phyllis Naylor Working Writer Fellowship in 2012. In 2016, he founded Per Diem Press, a poetry competition for young writers. He awarded $1,000 to three winners and published a chapbook of their work.

====Lemony Snicket====
Handler wrote the bestselling series of 13 novels &quot;A Series of Unfortunate Events&quot; under the Snicket pseudonym from 1999 to 2006. The series is about three orphaned children who experience increasingly terrible events after their parents die and their home burns. Snicket acts as the orphans&#x27; narrator and biographer. Handler narrated the audiobooks for three books in the series before handing back the narrating job to the original narrator, Tim Curry.

From 2012 to 2015, Handler published the four-part series &quot;All the Wrong Questions&quot; under the name Lemony Snicket; the books explore Snicket&#x27;s childhood and V.F.D. apprenticeship in the failing town Stain&#x27;d-by-the-Sea. He has also written other children&#x27;s novels under the Snicket name, including companion books to his two Snicket series, and children&#x27;s books such as &quot;The Composer is Dead&quot; and &quot;The Latke Who Couldn&#x27;t Stop Screaming&quot;.

=== Music ===
Handler was in two bands after college, the Edith Head Trio and Tzamboni, but his music received little attention until &quot;69 Love Songs&quot;, a three-album set by The Magnetic Fields on which he played accordion. In the box set of the project, Handler interviews band leader Stephin Merritt about the project. He also appears in Kerthy Fix&#x27;s and Gail O&#x27;Hara&#x27;s 2009 documentary &quot;Strange Powers,&quot; about Merritt and the Magnetic Fields.

Handler has played accordion in several other Merritt projects, including The 6ths and The Gothic Archies, the last of which provided songs for the &quot;A Series of Unfortunate Events&quot; audiobooks. In 2006, a Gothic Archies album was released with all 13 songs from the 13 &quot;A Series of Unfortunate Events&quot; audiobooks, along with two bonus songs.

In the audio commentary on the film adaptation &quot;Lemony Snicket&#x27;s A Series of Unfortunate Events&quot;, Handler plays a song about how depressing it is to have leeches in a film.

Handler wrote the lyrics to the song &quot;Radio&quot;, performed by One Ring Zero, and &quot;The Gibbons Girl&quot;, by Chris Ewen&#x27;s The Hidden Variable.

=== Theater ===
In 2017, Handler wrote the play &quot;Imaginary Comforts&quot;, &quot;and The Story of The Ghost of The Dead Rabbit&quot;, which was performed at the Berkeley Repertory Theatre. The satirical play follows the intertwining lives of three characters and is inspired by the grief Handler felt after his father&#x27;s death.

=== Film and television ===
Handler has also had some success in film. He produced the screenplay for &quot;Rick&quot;, based on the Verdi opera &quot;Rigoletto&quot;, as well as &quot;Kill the Poor&quot;, based on the novel by Joel Rose.

Handler was involved in the screenwriting process for the film &quot;Lemony Snicket&#x27;s A Series of Unfortunate Events&quot; but was ultimately removed from the project. After writing eight drafts of the script for Sonnenfeld, he was replaced by Robert Gordon in May 2003. Handler approved of the changes that were made to his original screenplay. &quot;I was offered credit on the film for screenwriting by the Writers Guild of America,&quot; Handler said, &quot;but I didn&#x27;t take it because I didn&#x27;t write it. I felt like it would be an insult to the guy who did.&quot;

Handler submitted a commentary track for the DVD version alongside director Brad Silberling. In character as Lemony Snicket, he derides the Lemony Snicket in the film as an impostor and plays the accordion and sings about leeches rather than pay attention to the film. Many times during the track, he shows great sympathy towards the Baudelaire children and implies that he is being held captive by the director to do the commentary.

Handler was a writer on the Netflix series &quot;A Series of Unfortunate Events&quot;, also contributing lyrics to the show&#x27;s theme song, which varies each episode. The show has won several accolades, including a Peabody Award in 2017 for excellence in children&#x27;s and youth programming.

==Controversies==
===Remark about race===
At the November 2014 National Book Awards ceremony, Handler made a controversial remark after author Jacqueline Woodson was presented with an award for &quot;Brown Girl Dreaming&quot;. During the ceremony, he said that Woodson was allergic to watermelon, a reference to the racist watermelon stereotype. His comments were immediately criticized; Handler apologized and donated $10,000 to We Need Diverse Books, and promised to match donations up to $100,000. In a &quot;New York Times&quot; op-ed published shortly thereafter, &quot;The Pain of the Watermelon Joke&quot;, Woodson wrote that &quot;in making light of that deep and troubled history&quot; with his joke, Handler had come from a place of ignorance, but underscored the need for her mission to &quot;give people a sense of this country&#x27;s brilliant and brutal history, so no one ever thinks they can walk onto a stage one evening and laugh at another&#x27;s too often painful past&quot;.

===Allegations of inappropriate sexual comments===
In February 2018, Handler signed an online pledge to boycott conferences that do not have and enforce harassment policies. Underneath his comment, author Kate Messner recounted an incident in which Handler had made inappropriate jokes directed at her, such as &quot;Are you a virgin, too?!&quot; and &quot;These children&#x27;s book events always turn into orgies!&quot; This led to many other women accusing Handler of verbal sexual harassment at book conferences; among the public accusations are stories of Handler telling a woman he had just met to kiss a random stranger, making crass comments to a teenage girl and walking off without apology when confronted, referring to a stranger as a &quot;hot blonde&quot; and making a &quot;uni-ball&quot; double entendre in front of young children. The incident occurred during the larger Me Too movement.

Handler apologized for his behavior, saying, &quot;It has never been my wish to insult any of my professional colleagues&quot;, &quot;my sense of humor has not been for everyone&quot;, &quot;as a survivor of sexual violence, I also know very well how words or behaviors that are harmless or even liberating to some people can be upsetting to others&quot;, and &quot;I am listening and willing to listen; I am learning and willing to learn.&quot; After this, Wesleyan University students began to protest Handler&#x27;s upcoming planned commencement speech at the university. In March 2018, Wesleyan president Michael S. Roth announced that Handler had withdrawn from the appearance, to be replaced by Anita Hill.

<text>The Cimmerians were an ancient Eastern Iranic equestrian nomadic people originating in the Pontic–Caspian steppe, part of whom subsequently migrated into West Asia. Although the Cimmerians were culturally Scythian, they formed an ethnic unit separate from the Scythians proper, to whom the Cimmerians were related and who displaced and replaced the Cimmerians.

The Cimmerians themselves left no written records, and most information about them is largely derived from Neo-Assyrian records of the 8th to 7th centuries BC and from Graeco-Roman authors from the 5th century BC and later.

== Name ==
=== Etymology ===
The English name is derived from Latin , itself derived from the Ancient Greek (), of an ultimately uncertain origin for which there have been various proposals:
*according to János Harmatta, it was derived from Old Iranic , meaning &quot;union of clans.&quot;
* and Igor Diakonoff derived it from an Old Iranic term or , meaning &quot;mobile unit.&quot;
*Askold Ivantchik derives the name of the Cimmerians from an original form or , of uncertain meaning.
**Igor Diakonoff later abandoned his own etymology to support Ivantchik&#x27;s proposed etymology of the name of the Cimmerians.
**According to Ivantchik, the Greek form of the name started with /k/ rather than with /g/ as in the original name due to its transmission to the Greek language through the intermediary of the Lydian language, which did not distinguish between the voiced and non-voiced velar stops.

The name of the Cimmerians is attested in:
* Neo-Assyrian Akkadian as ( and ),
* Late Babylonian Akkadian as ( and );
* and Hebrew as ().

=== Broader usage ===
The Late Babylonian scribes of the Achaemenid Empire used the name &quot;Cimmerians&quot; to designate all the nomad peoples of the steppe, including the Scythians and Saka.

However, while the Cimmerians were an Iranic people sharing a common language, origins and culture with the Scythians and are archaeologically indistinguishable from the Scythians, all sources contemporary to their activities clearly distinguished the Cimmerians and the Scythians as being two separate political entities.

In 1966, the archaeologist Maurits Nanning van Loon described the Cimmerians as &quot;Western Scythians&quot;, and referred to the Scythians proper as the &quot;Eastern Scythians&quot;.

== History ==

There are three main sources of information on the historical Cimmerians:
*Akkadian cuneiform texts from Mesopotamia;
*Graeco-Roman sources;
*archaeological data from the Pontic-Caspian Steppes, Caucasia, and West Asia.

===Origins===
The arrival of the Cimmerians in Europe was part of the larger process of westwards movement of Central Asian Iranic nomads towards Southeast and Central Europe which lasted from the 1st millennium BC to the 1st millennium AD. Other Iranic nomads, such as the Scythians, Sauromatians, and Sarmatians, would later follow.

====Beginning of steppe nomadism====
The formation of genuine nomadic pastoralism itself happened in the early 1st millennium BC due to climatic changes which caused the environment in the Central Asian and Siberian steppes to become cooler and drier than before. These changes caused the sedentary mixed farmers of the Bronze Age to become nomadic pastoralists, so that by the 9th century BC all the steppe settlements of the sedentary Bronze Age populations had disappeared, and therefore led to the development of population mobility and the formation of warrior units necessary to protect herds and take over new areas.

These climatic conditions in turn caused the nomadic groups to become transhumant pastoralists constantly moving their herds from one pasture to another in the steppe, and to search for better pastures to the west, in Ciscaucasia and the forest steppe regions of western Eurasia.

====The Chernogorovka-Novocherkassk complex====
The Cimmerians originated as a section of the first wave of the nomadic populations who originated in the parts of Central Asia corresponding to eastern Kazakhstan or the Altai-Sayan region, and who had, beginning in the 10th century BC and lasting until the 9th to 8th centuries BC, migrated westwards into the Pontic-Caspian Steppe regions, where they formed new tribal confederations which constituted the Chernogorovka-Novocherkassk complex.

Among these tribal confederations were the Cimmerians in the Caspian Steppe, as well as the Agathyrsi in the Pontic Steppe, and possibly the Sigynnae in the Pannonian Steppe. The archaeological and historical records regarding these migrations are however scarce, and permit to sketch only a very broad outline of this complex development.

The Cimmerians corresponded to a part of the Chernogorovka-Novocherkassk complex, to whose development three main cultural influences contributed to:
*present in the development of the Chernogorovka-Novocherkassk complex is a strong impact of the native Bilozerka culture, especially in the form of pottery styles and burial traditions;
*the two other influences were of foreign origin:
**attesting of the Inner Asian origin, a strong material influence from the Altai, Aržan and Karasuk cultures from Central Asia and Siberia is visible in the Chernogorovka-Novocherkassk complex of Inner Asian origin were especially dagger and arrowhead types, horse gear such as bits with stirrup-shaped terminals, deer stone-like carved stelae and Animal Style art;
**in addition to this Central Asian influence, the Kuban culture of Ciscaucasia also played an important contribution in the development of the Chernogorovka-Novocherkassk complex, especially regarding the adoption of Kuban culture-types of mace heads and bimetallic daggers.
The Chernogorovka-Novocherkassk complex thus developed natively in the North Pontic region over the course of the 9th to mid-7th centuries BC from elements which had earlier arrived from Central Asia, due to which it itself exhibited similarities with the other early nomadic cultures of the Eurasian steppe and forest steppe which existed before the 7th century BC, such as the Aržan culture, so that these various pre-Scythian early nomadic cultures were thus part of a unified Aržan-Chernogorovka cultural layer originating from Central Asia.

Thanks to their development of highly mobile mounted nomadic pastoralism and the creation of effective weapons suited to equestrian warfare, all based on equestrianism, these nomads from the Pontic-Caspian Steppes were able to gradually infiltrate into Central and Southeast Europe and therefore expand deep into this region over a very long period of time, so that the Chernogorovka-Novocherkassk complex covered a wide territory ranging from Central Europe and the Pannonian Plain in the west to Caucasia in the east, including present-day Southern Russia.

This in turn allowed the Chernogorovka-Novocherkassk complex itself to strongly influence the Hallstatt culture of Central Europe: among these influences was the adoption of trousers, which were not used by the native populations of Central Europe before the arrival of the Central Asian steppe nomads.

===In the Caspian and Ciscaucasian Steppes===
Within the western sections of the Eurasian Steppe, the Cimmerians lived in the Caspian and Ciscaucasian Steppes, situated on the northern and western shores of the Caspian Sea and along the Araxes river, i.e., the Volga river, which acted as their eastern border separating them from the Scythians; to the west, the territory of the Cimmerians extended until the Bosporus, i.e. the Kerch Strait).

The Cimmerians were thus the first large nomadic confederation to have inhabited the Ciscaucasian Steppe, and they never formed the basic mass of the population of the Pontic Steppe, with neither Hesiod nor Aristeas of Proconnesus ever recording them living in this area; moreover the groups of the Chernogorovka-Novocherkassk complex from the Pontic Steppe and Central Europe have so far not been identifiable with the historical Cimmerians. Instead, the main grouping of Iranic nomads of Central Asian origin belonging to the Chernogorovka-Novocherkassk complex in the eastern parts of the Pontic Steppe were the Agathyrsi to the north of the Lake Maeotis.

Some later place names mentioned by the ancient Greeks in the 5th century BC as existing in the Bosporan (Kerch Strait) region, might have owed their origin to the historical presence of the Cimmerians in this area, such as:
*the &quot;Cimmerian ferry&quot; (),
*the &quot;country of Cimmeria&quot; (),
*and the &quot;Cimmerian Bosporus&quot; ().
However, a derivation of these names from the historical Cimmerian presence is still very uncertain.

===The displacement of the Cimmerians===
====Arrival of the Scythians====
A second wave of migration of Iranic nomads corresponded with the arrival of the early Scythians from Central Asia into the Caucasian Steppe, which started in the 9th century BC, when a significant movement of the nomadic peoples of the Eurasian Steppe started after the early Scythians were expelled out of Central Asia by either the Massagetae, who were a powerful nomadic Iranic tribe from Central Asia closely related to the Scythians, or by another Central Asian people called the Issedones, thus forcing the early Scythians to the west, across the Araxes river and into the Caspian and Ciscaucasian Steppes.

Like the nomads of the Chernogorovka-Novocherkassk complex, the Scythians originated in Central Asia in the steppes corresponding to either present-day eastern Kazakhstan or the Altai-Sayan region, which is attested by the continuity of Scythian burial rites and weaponry types with the Karasuk culture, as well as by the origin of the typically Scythian Animal Style art in the Mongolo-Siberian region.

Therefore, the Scythians and the nomads of the Chernogorovka-Novocherkassk complex were closely related populations who shared a common origin, culture, and language, and the earliest Scythians were therefore part of a common Aržan-Chernogorovka cultural layer originating from Central Asia, with the early Scythian culture being materially indistinguishable from the Chernogorovka-Novocherkassk complex.

This western migration of the early Scythians lasted through the middle 8th century BC, and archaeologically corresponded to the movement of a population originating from Tuva in southern Siberia in the late 9th century BC towards the west, and arriving in the 8th to 7th centuries BC into Europe, especially into Ciscaucasia, which it reached some time between and , thus following the same general migration path as the first wave of Central Asian Iranic nomads who had formed the Chernogorovka-Novocherkassk complex.

====Migration of the Cimmerians====
The westward migration of the Scythians brought them around to the lands of the Cimmerians, who around this time were leaving their homelands in the Caspian Steppe to move into West Asia.

The reasons for the departure of the Cimmerians are unknown, although they might possibly have migrated under the pressure from the Scythians, similarly to how various nomadic peoples drove each other into the peripheries of the steppes in Europe, West Asia and the Iranian Plateau during Late Antiquity and afterwards.

Ancient West Asia sources are however lacking for any such pressure on the Cimmerians by the Scythians or of any conflict between these two peoples at this early period. Moreover, the arrival of the Scythians in West Asia about 40 years after the Cimmerians did so suggests that there is no available evidence to the later Graeco-Roman account that it was under pressure from the Scythians migrating into their territories that the Cimmerians crossed the Caucasus and moved south into West Asia.

The remnants of the Cimmerians in the Caspian Steppe were assimilated by the Scythians, with this absorption being facilitated by their similar ethnic backgrounds and lifestyles, thus transferring the dominance of this region from the Cimmerians to the Scythians who were assimilating them, after which the Scythians settled between the Araxes river to the east, the Caucasus mountains to the south, and the Maeotian Sea to the west, in the Ciscaucasian Steppe where were located the Scythian kingdom&#x27;s headquarters.

The arrival of the Scythians and their establishment in this region in the 7th century BC corresponded to a disturbance of the development of the Cimmerian peoples&#x27; Chernogorovka-Novocherkassk complex, which was thus replaced through a continuous process over the course of to by the early Scythian culture in southern Europe, which itself nevertheless still showed links to the Chernogorovka-Novocherkassk complex.

===In West Asia===
Over the course of the second half of the 8th century BC and the 7th century BC, the equestrian steppe nomads from Ciscaucasia expanded to the south, beginning with the Cimmerians, who migrated from the Caspian Steppe into West Asia, following the same dynamic of the steppe nomads like the Scythians, Alans and Huns who would later invade West Asia via Caucasia. The Cimmerians entered West Asia by crossing the Caucasus Mountains through the Alagir, Darial, and Passes, which was the same route that Sarmatian detachments would later take to invade the Arsacid Parthian Empire, after which Cimmerians eventually became active in the West Asian regions of Transcaucasia, the Iranian Plateau and Anatolia.

====Reasons for southwards nomad expansion====
The involvement of the steppe nomads in West Asia happened in the context of the then growth of the Neo-Assyrian Empire, which under its kings Sargon II and Sennacherib had expanded from its core region of the Tigris and Euphrates valleys to rule and dominate a large territory ranging from Que (Plain Cilicia) and the Central and Eastern Anatolian mountains in the north to the Syrian Desert in the south, and from the Taurus Mountains and North Syria and the coast of the Mediterranean Sea in the west to the Iranian Plateau in the east.

Surrounding the Neo-Assyrian Empire were several smaller polities:
*in Anatolia to the northwest, were the kingdoms of:
**Phrygia, with its capital at Gordion, held hegemony over Central and Midwest Anatolia and parts of Cilicia;
**and Lydia;
*Babylon, conquered several times by the Assyrians, in the south;
*Egypt in the southwest;
*Elam, whose capital was Susa, in the southeast of West Asia and the southwest of the Iranian plateau, where they were the main power, with their ruling classes being divided into pro-Assyrian and pro-Babylonian factions;
*and to the immediate north laid the powerful kingdom of Urartu (centred around Ṭušpa), which had established several installations including a system of fortresses and provincial centres over regional communities in eastern Anatolia and the northwest Iranian Plateau, was contesting its southern borderlands with the Neo-Assyrian Empire;
*in the eastern mountains were several weaker polities:
**Ellipi;
**Mannai;
**the city-states of the Medes, who were an Iranic people of West Asia to whom the Scythians and Cimmerians were distantly related.
Beyond the territories under the direct Assyrian rule, especially in its frontiers in Anatolia and the Iranian Plateau, were local rulers who negotiated for their own interests by vacillating between the various rival great powers.

This state of permanent social disruption caused by the rivalries of the great powers of West Asia thus proved to be a very attractive source of opportunities and wealth for the steppe nomads. And, as the populations of the nomads of the Ciscaucasian Steppe continued to grow, their aristocrats would lead their followers southwards across the Caucasus Mountains in search of adventure and plunder in the volatile status quo then prevailing in West Asia, not unlike the later Ossetian tradition of the ritual plunder called the (), with the occasional raids eventually leading to longer expeditions, in turn leading to groups of nomads choosing to remain in West Asia in search of opportunities as mercenaries or freebooters.

Thus, the Cimmerians and Scythians became active in West Asia in the 7th century BC, where they would vacillate between supporting either the Neo-Assyrian Empire or other local powers, and serve them as mercenaries, depending on what they considered to be in their interests. Their activities would over the course of the late-8th to late-7th centuries BC disrupt the balance of power which had prevailed between the states of Elam, Mannai, the Neo-Assyrian Empire and Urartu on one side and the mountaineer and tribal peoples on the other, eventually leading to significant geopolitical changes in this region.

Nevertheless, a 9th or 8th century BC barrow grave, belonging from Paphlagonia to a warrior, and containing typical steppe nomad equipment, suggests that nomadic warriors had already been arriving in West Asia since the 9th century BC. Such burials imply that some small groups of steppe nomads from Ciscaucasia might have acted as mercenaries, adventurers and settler groups in West Asia, which laid the ground for the later large scale movement of the Cimmerians and Scythians into West Asia.

There appears to have been very little direct connection between the Cimmerians&#x27; migration into West Asia and the Scythians&#x27; later expansion into this same region. Thus, the arrival of the Scythians in West Asia about 40 years after the Cimmerians did so suggests that there is no available evidence to the later Graeco-Roman account that it was under pressure from the Scythians migrating into their territories that the Cimmerians crossed the Caucasus and moved south into West Asia.

====In Transcaucasia====
During the early phase of their presence in West Asia until the early 660s BC, the Cimmerians moved into Transcaucasia, which acted as their initial centre of operations: after having passed through Colchis and western Caucasia and Georgia, during the 8th century BC, the Cimmerians settled in a region located to the east of Colchis, in the areas of central Transcaucasia to the immediate south of the Darial and Klukhor passes and on the Cyrus river, which corresponds to territory of Gori in modern-day central and southern Georgia. Archaeologically, this Cimmerian presence is attested by remains associated to nomadic populations dating from between to .

The presence of the Cimmerians in this area led Mesopotamian sources to call it (, ).

The territory of the Cimmerians at this time was separated from the kingdom of Urartu by a Urartian vassal country named Quriani, itself located near the countries of Kulḫa and Diaueḫi, to the east and northeast of the Lake Çıldır and the north and northwest of Lake Sevan.

=====Conflict with Urartu=====

The Cimmerians appeared to have first become active in the territories to the south of the Caucasus in the , where they helped the inhabitants of Colchis and of the nearby regions defeat attacks by the kingdom of Urartu.

The oldest known activities of the Cimmerians in West Asia date from the mid-710s BC, when they launched a sudden attack on Urartu&#x27;s province of Uišini (whose capital was Waysi) through the territory of the kingdom of Mannai, after the Mannaean king Ullusunu had invited them to attack Urartu through his kingdom&#x27;s territory. This attack therefore took the Urartians by surprise and forced the governor of Uišini to ask for support from the king of the neighbouring small state of Muṣaṣir located on the Assyro-Urartian border region.

The first recorded mentions of the Cimmerians date from spring or early summer of 714 BC and are from the intelligence reports of the then superpower of West Asia, the Neo-Assyrian Empire, sent by the crown prince Sennacherib to his father the Neo-Assyrian king Sargon II, recording that the Urartian king Rusa I () had launched a counter-attack against the Cimmerians: Rusa I had gathered almost all of the Urartian armed forces to campaign against the Cimmerians, with Rusa I himself as well as his commander in chief and thirteen governors personally participating in this campaign. Rusa I&#x27;s counter-attack was heavily defeated, and the governor of the Urartian province of Uišini was killed while the commander in chief and two governors were captured by the Cimmerian forces, attesting of the significant military power of the Cimmerians.

After this defeat, the Urartian forces retreated to Quriani, while Rusa I left for the Urartian province of Wazaun. Although Neo-Assyrian intelligence reports claimed that the Urartians were fearing an attack by the Neo-Assyrian Empire and that panic spread had among them following this defeat, the situation within Urartu remained calm, and the king Urzana of Muṣaṣir personally, as well as a messenger from the kingdom of Ḫubuškia, went to meet Rusa I to reaffirm his allegiance to Urartu.

This defeat against the Cimmerians had nonetheless weakened Urartu significantly enough that, when Sargon II campaigned against Urartu in 714 BC itself, in the month of Tamūzu, he was able to defeat the Urartians in the region of mount Wauš, and annex Muṣaṣir, while Rusa I consequently committed suicide and his son Melarṭua was crowned as the new king of Urartu. Although Urartu&#x27;s power was so shaken by these defeats that it stopped harassing Mannai and the Neo-Assyrian provinces on the Iranian Plateau, it nevertheless remained a major power in West Asia under Melarṭua&#x27;s successor, Argišti II ().

According to Neo-Assyrian reports from the reign of Sargon II itself, the king of the Cimmerians, whose name was not mentioned in these reports, had set up his camp in a region named Uṣunali. At another point, this Cimmerian king had departed from Mannai to attack Urartu, where he plundered several regions, including the district of Arḫi, and reached the city of Ḫuʾdiadae near the core territory of Urartu, forcing the governor of Uišini to request military aid for the people of Pulia and Suriana from Urzana of Muṣaṣir.

Urartu mobilised its armed forces to fight against this Cimmerian invasion, although the Urartians preferred to wait until it was snowing to attack the Cimmerians, due to how snow could block roads and hinder the mobility of the horses that the Cimmerians depended on to carry on their attacks.

Thus, the Cimmerians were attacking Urartu by passing through the routes in Mannai, thanks to which they were able to establish areas of influence on the northeastern borders of Urartu, which also provided them with access to the Anatolian Plateau and allowed them to replace Urartu as the dominant power in some parts of the western Iranian Plateau and Transcaucasia.

=====Death of Sargon II=====
Possibly out of fear from the danger of the Cimmerians, the Phrygian king Midas, who had previously been a bitter opponent of the Neo-Assyrian Empire, ended hostilities with the Neo-Assyrians in 709 BC and sent a delegation to Sargon II to attempt to form an anti-Cimmerian alliance.

In 705 BC, Sargon II led a campaign against a rebellious Neo-Assyrian vassal, the Neo-Hittite kingdom of Tabal in Anatolia, during which he probably also fought the Cimmerians, and was killed in battle against the Tabalian ruler Gurdî of Kulummu.
After Sargon II&#x27;s death, Gurdî&#x27;s kingdom grew in power while the Neo-Assyrian Empire lost control of Tabal, which largely came under Gurdî&#x27;s rule; although Sargon II&#x27;s son and successor Sennacherib () attacked Gurdî at Til-Garimmu in 695 BC, he was able to evade capture by the Neo-Assyrian forces.

Nonetheless, although the Neo-Assyrian Empire stopped intervening in Anatolia, Sennacherib was able to secure the new northwestern Neo-Assyrian borders running from Cilicia to Melid to Ḫarran due to which the Cimmerians ceased being mentioned in Neo-Assyrian records under his reign and would re-start being mentioned by the Assyrians only under the reign of Sennacherib&#x27;s own son and successor Esarhaddon.

The Cimmerians might however have possibly ended their hostilities with Urartu and acted as mercenaries in the Urartian army during this period, under the reign of Argišti II. Some of these Cimmerians serving in the Urartian army might have been responsible for the creation of several human funerary statues in the region of Muṣaṣir which resemble the funerary statues of steppe nomads.

=====Cimmerians in the Assyrian army=====
By 680 and 679 BC, Cimmerian detachments composed of individual soldiers were serving in the Neo-Assyrian army. These might have been Cimmerian captives or Cimmerians recruited into the Neo-Assyrian military or merely Assyrian soldiers equipped in the &quot;Cimmerian style,&quot; that is using Cimmerian bows and arrows.

=====Division of the Cimmerians=====
During the period corresponding to the rule of the Neo-Assyrian king Esarhaddon (), the Cimmerians split into two major divisions:
*the bulk of the Cimmerians migrated from Transcaucasia into Anatolia under the leadership of the king Teušpâ, becoming the western division of the Cimmerians;
*a smaller group of the Cimmerians, called the Indaraeans (, ) in Neo-Assyrian sources, remained on the Iranian Plateau in the area near Mannai, where they had been settled since the time of Sargon II, thus forming the eastern division of the Cimmerians.
The two groups of the Cimmerians might themselves have continued to remain part of the same steppe nomad polity, which was itself nevertheless organised along various divisions depending on political changes. Such a structure was also present among:
*the ancient Xiongnu, whose princes and nobles were divided into Eastern and Western groups;
*the mediaeval Turkic Oguz people, who were organised into a single kingdom ruled through two divisions, each of which was composed of several tribes and was ruled by a member of the same dynasty.

The Cimmerian and Scythians movements into Anatolia and the Iranian Plateau would act as catalysts for the adoption of Eurasian nomadic military and equestrian equipments by various West Asian states: it was during the 7th and 6th centuries BC that &quot;Scythian-type&quot; socketed arrowheads and sigmoid bows ideal for use by mounted warriors, which were the most advanced shooting weapon of their time and were both technically and ballistically superior to native West Asian archery equipment, were adopted throughout West Asia.

Cimmerian and Scythian trading posts and settlements on the borders of the various West Asian states at this time also supplied them with goods such as animal husbandry products, not unlike the trade relations which existed the mediaeval period between the eastern steppe nomads and the Chinese Tang Empire.

====On the Iranian Plateau====
The eastern group of Cimmerians would remain on the northwestern Iranian plateau, where they were initially active in Mannai before later moving southwards into Media.

=====In Mannai=====
======Scythian expansion into West Asia======
After having settled into Ciscaucasia, the Scythians became the second wave of steppe nomads to expand southwards from there, following the western shore of the Caspian Sea and bypassing the Caucasus Mountains to the east through the Caspian Gates, with the Scythians first arriving in Transcaucasia around , after which they consequently became active in West Asia. This Scythian expansion into West Asia, nonetheless, never lost contact with the core Scythian kingdom located in the Ciscaucasian Steppe and was merely an extension of it, as was the concurrently occurring westward Scythian expansion into the Pontic Steppe.

Once they had finally crossed into West Asia, the Scythians settled in eastern Transcaucasia and the northwest Iranian plateau, between the middle course of the Cyrus and Araxes rivers before expanding into the regions corresponding to present-day Gəncə, Mingəçevir and the Muğan plain in the steppes of what is presently Azerbaijan, which became their centre operations until , and this part of Transcaucasia settled by the Scythians consequently became known in the Akkadian sources from Mesopotamia as (, ) after them.

The arrival of the Scythians in West Asia about 40 years after that of the Cimmerians suggests that there is no available evidence to the later Graeco-Roman account of the Cimmerians crossing the Caucasus and moving south into West Asia under pressure from the Scythians migrating into their territories.

======Attacks against the Neo-Assyrian Empire======

With the Cimmerian victory on Urartu and Sargon II&#x27;s successful campaign there in 714 BC having eliminated it as a threat against the Neo-Assyrian Empire, Mannai had ceased being useful as a buffer zone for Neo-Assyrian power, while the Mannaeans themselves saw the Neo-Assyrian imperial demands as a now unneeded burden. Therefore, the Mannaean king Aḫšēri () welcomed the Cimmerians and the Scythians as useful allies who could offer both protection and favourable new opportunities to his kingdom, which in turn allowed him to become an opponent of the Neo-Assyrian Empire, with him subsequently remaining an enemy of Sennacherib and his successors Esarhaddon and Ashurbanipal.

The first ever recorded mention of the Scythians is from the records of the Neo-Assyrian Empire of , which detail the first Scythian activities in West Asia and refer to the first recorded Scythian king, Išpakāya, as an ally of the Mannaeans.

Around this time, Aḫšēri was hindering operations by the Neo-Assyrian Empire between its own territory and Mannai, while the Scythians were recorded by the Neo-Assyrians along with the eastern Cimmerians, Mannaeans and Urartians as possibly menacing communication between the Neo-Assyrian Empire and its vassal of Ḫubuškia, with messengers travelling between the Neo-Assyrian Empire and Hubuskia being at risk of being captured by hostile Cimmerian, Mannaean, Scythian or Urartian forces. Neo-Assyrian records also referred to these joint Cimmerian-Scythian forces, along with the Medes and Mannaeans, as a possible threat against the collection of tribute from Media.

During these attacks, the Scythians, along with the eastern Cimmerians who were located on the border of Mannai, were able to reach far beyond the core territories of the Iranian Plateau and attack the Neo-Assyrian provinces of Parsuwaš and Bīt-Ḫambān and even until as far as Yašuḫ, Šamaš-naṣir and Zamuā in the valley of the Diyala river. One Scytho-Cimmerian attack which had invaded Ḫubuškia from Mannai was even able to threaten the core Neo-Assyrian territories by passing through Anisus and Ḫarrāniya on the Lower Zab river and sack the small city of Milqiya near Arbaʾil, close the capital cities of the Neo-Assyrian Empire, where they destroyed the (House of the New Year Festival) of this city, which later had to be rebuilt by Esarhaddon. These attacks into their heartlands shocked the Assyrians, who sought to know if they were to face more such invasions through divination.

Meanwhile, Mannai, which had been able to grow in power under Aḫšēri, possibly thanks to its adaptation and incorporation of steppe nomad fighting technologies borrowed from its Cimmerian and Scythian allies, was able to capture the territories including the fortresses of Šarru-iqbi and Dūr-Illil from the Neo-Assyrian Empire and retain them until the .

Under Argišti II, Urartu attempted to restore its power by expanding to the east towards the region of Mount Sabalan, possibly to relieve the pressure on the trade routes across the Iranian Plateau and the steppes from the Scythians, Cimmerians, and Medes. Urartu remained a major power under Argišti II&#x27;s successor Rusa II (), the latter of whom carried out major fortification construction projects around Lake Van, such as at Rusāipatari, and at Teišebaini near what is presently Yerevan; other fortifications built by Rusa II were Qale Bordjy and Qale Sangar north of Lake Urmia, as well as the fortresses of Pir Chavush, Qale Gavur and Qiz Qale around the administrative centre of Haftavan Tepe to the northwest of the Lake, all intended to monitor the activities of the allied forces of the Scythians, Mannaeans and Medes.

These allied forces of the Cimmerians, Mannaeans and Scythians were defeated some time between and by Sennacherib&#x27;s son Esarhaddon (), who had succeeded him as the king of the Neo-Assyrian Empire and carried out a retaliatory campaign which reached deep into Median territory until Mount Bikni and the country of Patušarra (Patischoria) on the limits of the Great Salt Desert. Išpakāya was killed in battle against Esarhaddon&#x27;s forces during this campaign, and he was succeeded as king of the Scythians by Bartatua, with whom Esarhaddon might have immediately initiated negotiations.

Since the Cimmerians had left their Ciscausian homelands and moved into West Asia to seek booty, they had no interest in the local affairs of the West Asian states and therefore fought for whoever was capable of paying them the most: therefore Esarhaddon took advantage of this and, at some point before , he started secret negotiations with the eastern Cimmerians, who confirmed to the Assyrians that they would remain neutral and promised not to interfere when Esarhaddon invaded Mannai again in . Nonetheless, since the Cimmerians were distant foreigners with a very different culture, and therefore did not fear the Mesopotamian gods, Esarhaddon&#x27;s diviner and advisor Bēl-ušēzib referred to these eastern Cimmerians instead of the Scythians as possible allies of the Mannaeans and advised Esarhaddon to spy on both them and the Mannaeans.

This second Assyrian invasion of Mannai however met little success because the Cimmerians with whom Esarhaddon had negotiated had deceived him by accepting his offer only to attack his invasion force, and the relations between Mannai and the Neo-Assyrian Empire remained hostile while the Cimmerians remained allied to Mannai until the period lasting from 671 to 657 BC. As a result of this failure, the Neo-Assyrian Empire resigned itself to waiting until the Cimmerians were no longer a threat before mounting any further expedition in Mannai.

Around this same time, the Indaraeans were also active around the northern boundary of Elam, and some of them might have moved to the southern Iranian Plateau, where they possibly introduced Bronze articles from the Koban culture into the Luristan bronze culture.

=====Alliance with the Medes=====
The Neo-Assyrian Empire did not remain on a defensive footing in response to the activities of the allied Cimmerian, Mannaean and Scythian forces, and it soon undertook diplomatic initiatives to separate Aḫšēri from his allies: by 672 BC, the Scythians had become the allies of the Neo-Assyrian Empire after Išpakāya&#x27;s successor, Bartatua, had asked for the hand of the eldest daughter of Esarhaddon, the Neo-Assyrian princess Šērūʾa-ēṭirat, and promised to form an alliance treaty with the Neo-Assyrian Empire in an act of careful diplomacy.

The marriage between Bartatua and the Šērūʾa-ēṭirat likely took place, in consequence of which the Scythians ceased to be referred to as an enemy force in the Neo-Assyrian records and the alliance between the Scythian kingdom and the Neo-Assyrian Empire was concluded, following which the Scythian kingdom therefore remained on friendly terms with the Neo-Assyrian Empire and maintained peaceful relations with it.

The eastern Cimmerians meanwhile remained hostile to Assyria, and, along with the Medes, were the allies of Ellipi against an invasion by the Neo-Assyrian Empire between and . The eastern Cimmerians also attacked the Assyrian province of Šubria during this time.

It consequently became more difficult for the Neo-Assyrian Empire to control the Median city-states and the various polities in the Zagros Mountains at this point. Soon, the Median chieftains Kaštaritu of Kār-Kaššî and Dusanni of Šaparda became powerful enough that their respective polities were seen by the Neo-Assyrian Empire as major forces in Media. And when Kaštaritu rebelled against the Neo-Assyrian Empire and founded the first independent kingdom of the Medes after successfully liberating them from Neo-Assyrian overlordship in to , the eastern Cimmerians were allied to him.

Around , the eastern Cimmerians experienced a defeat by the Neo-Assyrian army and were forced to retreat into their own territory, and they were still on the territory of Mannai by .

However, some time in the late 660s or early 650s BC, the eastern Cimmerians left the Iranian Plateau and retreated to the west into Anatolia to join the western Cimmerians operating there: since Aḫšēri had depended on his alliance with the Cimmerians and Scythians to protect his kingdom from attacks by the Neo-Assyrian Empire, their departure provided Esarhaddon&#x27;s successor to the Neo-Assyrian kingship, Ashurbanipal (), with the opportunity to attack Mannai and recover some of the settlements which the Mannaeans had previously captured. And although Aḫšēri himself was able to withstand the Neo-Assyrian invasion, he had depended on the Cimmerians to suppress internal opposition to his rule, and their absence weakened him enough that he was soon deposed and killed by a popular rebellion which his son Uallî repressed before ascending to the throne of Mannai and submitting to the Neo-Assyrian Empire.

Thus, Ashurbanipal&#x27;s situation improved once he was finally re-establish Neo-Assyrian overlordship over Mannai thanks to the retreat of the Cimmerians from the Iranian Plateau.

====In Anatolia====
At an unknown time, the western Cimmerian group moved into Anatolia, where it would be particularly active in the regions of Tabal, Phrygia and Lydia and would be involved in wars against these latter two states as well as against the Neo-Assyrian Empire, which itself avoided confrontations with the Cimmerians unless doing so was necessary.

This Cimmerian movement into Anatolia consisted of a large scale migration, with Cimmerian families taking their mobile possessions, animals, as well as conquered booty, along with them. This migration is archaeologically attested in the form of the expansion of the Scythian culture into this region, although the further details of the exact time and trajectory through which the Cimmerians moved into Anatolia, and whether these movements consisted of a single group or of disparate divisions, are however unknown.

=====Defeat by Esarhaddon=====
Around the same time, the rulers of the Neo-Hittite kingdom of Ḫubišna, which occupied a strategic position containing many settlements and routes linking the Konya Plain with Cilicia, might have demanded help from the Cimmerians against possible Neo-Assyrian attempts to take control of their region following the death of Warpalawas II of Tuwana, or the Cimmerians might have attempted to invade this region on their own. The Neo-Assyrian Empire reacted to maintain its control of Cilicia by conducting a campaign in 679 BC during which Esarhaddon killed the Cimmerian king Teušpâ and annexed a part of the territory of the kingdom of Ḫilakku and of the kingdom of Kundi and Sissû in the region of Que.

Despite this victory, and although Esarhaddon had managed to stop the advance of Cimmerians in the Neo-Assyrian province of Que so that this latter region remained under Neo-Assyrian control, the military operations were not successful enough for the Assyrians to firmly occupy the areas around of Ḫubišna, nor were they able to secure the borders of the Neo-Assyrian Empire, leaving Que vulnerable to incursions from Tabal, Kuzzurak and Ḫilakku, who were allied to the western Cimmerians who were establishing themselves in Anatolia at this time and might still have maintained connections with them even after Esarhaddon&#x27;s victory at Ḫubišna.

=====Invasion of Phrygia=====
With Urartu incapable of stopping the Cimmerian advance, some time around , under their king Dugdammî (the Lygdamis of the Greek authors), the western Cimmerians invaded and destroyed the empire of Phrygia, whose king Midas committed suicide, and sacked its capital of Gordion, although they appear to have neither settled within the city nor destroyed its fortifications.

The western Cimmerians consequently settled in Phrygia and subdued part of the Phrygians so that they controlled a large area consisting of Phrygia from its western limits which bordered on Lydia to its eastern boundaries neighbouring the Neo-Assyrian Empire, after which they made Cappadocia into their centre of operations.

These western Cimmerians soon became sedentary, and by , they had established their rule over native Anatolian settlements as well as formed their own settlements in Central Anatolia, with the city of Ḫarzallē or Ḫarṣallē being the capital city of the Cimmerian king Dugdammî. Each of these settlements had rulers referred to by Neo-Assyrian sources as (): these administrators consisted of both Cimmerians and members of other ethnic groups who lived within Dugdammî&#x27;s kingdom.

According to a tradition later recorded by Stephanus of Byzantium, the Cimmerians found several tens of thousands of  of wheat in the underground granaries of the Phrygian village of Syassos that they used as food for a long time.

=====Activities in Anatolia=====
When Esarhaddon conquered the nearby state of Šubria in 673 BC, Rusa II supported him, attesting of a period of non-aggression between Urartu and Assyria under the reigns of Rusa II and Esarhaddon.

Assyrian sources from around this same time also recorded a Cimmerian presence in the area of the Neo-Hittite state of Tabal.

And between and , an Assyrian oracular text recorded that the Cimmerians, together with the Phrygians and the Cilicians, were threatening the Neo-Assyrian Empire&#x27;s newly conquered territory of Melid.

The western Cimmerians were thus active in Tabal, Ḫilakku and Phrygia in the 670s BC, and, in alliance with these former two states, were attacking the western Neo-Assyrian provinces. At unknown dates, the western Cimmerians also invaded Bithynia and Paphlagonia.

In the early 660s BC, the power of the Cimmerians grew drastically and they became the masters of Anatolia, where they controlled a large territory bordering Lydia in the west, covering Phrygia around Gordion and the Sangarios river, and reaching the Taurus Mountains in Cilicia and the borders of Urartu in the east, and encompassing the area bounded by the Black Sea in the north and the Mediterranean Sea in the south.

The core territories of the western Cimmerians were in Central Anatolia between the Konya Plain and the Neo-Assyrian province of Que, but also extended to parts of the Konya Plain itself, including its western parts, and to Cappadocia, as well as to the west of Tabal, implying that some of the Neo-Hittite states in and near the Konya Plain had become subjected to the Cimmerians.

The disturbances experienced by the Neo-Assyrian Empire as result of the activities of the Cimmerians in Anatolia led to many of the rulers of this region to try to break away from Neo-Assyrian overlordship, with Ḫilakku having become an independent polity again under the king Sandašarme by the time that Esarhaddon had been succeeded as king of the Neo-Assyrian Empire by Ashurbanipal, so that by then the Cimmerians had effectively ended Neo-Assyrian control in Anatolia.

=====Reunification of the Cimmerians=====
Soon, in the late 660s or early 650s BC, the western Cimmerians were reinforced by the eastern Cimmerians who had left the western Iranian plateau to move to the west into Anatolia.

======First contacts with the Greeks======

Beginning in the 8th century BC, the ancient Greeks were first starting to make expeditions in the Black Sea, and encounters with friendly native populations quickly stimulated trade relations and the development of more regular commercial transits, which in turn led to the formation of trading settlements. The first Greek colony in the Black Sea, founded by settlers from Miletus around , was that of Sinope, in whose region the Cimmerians were active at this time.

The Cimmerians destroyed Sinope during the 7th century BC and killed its founder, Habrōn, after they had invaded Paphlagonia. The Greek colony of Cyzicus might also have been destroyed by the Cimmerians so that it had to be re-founded at a later date. Thus, it was at this time that the Cimmerians first came into contact with the Greeks in Anatolia, constituting the first encounter between the ancient Greeks and steppe nomads.

In 671 to 670 BC, Cimmerian contingents were serving in the Assyrian army, and Neo-Assyrian sources were referring to the spread of military technology and animal husbandry products referred to in Assyrian sources as &quot;Cimmerian leather straps&quot; and &quot;Cimmerian bows&quot; into the Neo-Assyrian Empire from to .

=====First attack on Lydia=====
With their eastern and southeastern borders abutting the Neo-Assyrian, which had been powerful enough to defeat their king Teuspa some years earlier, in the late and early , the Cimmerians under Dugdammî instead redirected their activities towards western Anatolia, where they attacked the kingdom of Lydia, which under its king Gyges had been filling the power vacuum in Anatolia created by the destruction of the Phrygian Empire and was establishing itself as a new rising regional power.

However, the Lydian forces were initially not able to resist this invasion, and Gyges sought to find help to face the Cimmerian invasions by initiating diplomatic relations with the Neo-Assyrian Empire in 666 BC: without accepting Assyrian overlordship, Gyges started to send regular embassies and diplomatic gifts to Ashurbanipal, with another Lydian embassy to the Neo-Assyrian Empire being attested from .

Since it was due to the threat of the Cimmerians that Gyges had made friendly overtures to the Neo-Assyrian Empire, Ashurbanipal considered the Cimmerian presence in Anatolia more useful than fighting them. Therefore, he adopted a policy of accepting whatever gifts and praise that Gyges would offer him, in exchange of which Ashurbanipa promised him support from the gods Aššur and Marduk while keeping him waiting and abstaining from providing any military support to Lydia.

These Cimmerian attacks also destroyed the relations between Lydia and Phrygia, and archaeological evidence from the Lydian site of Daskyleion shows that the Cimmerian invasion ended the development of trade and economic production in the early 7th century BC which had contributed to integrating both Lydia and Ionia into the Mediterranean economy. Lower class Ionian Greeks and Carians affected by this Cimmerian invasion appear to have formed a significant part of the colonists who went to set up new settlements throughout the shore of the Black Sea in the 7th century BC, such as the colonies of Borysthenēs, Histria, Apollonia Pontica, Kallatis, and Karōn Limēn.

Gyges&#x27;s struggle against the Cimmerians soon turned in his favour without Neo-Assyrian support, so that he was able to defeat them between and , possibly through campaigns in western Central Anatolia to the east of Sardis and the south of the core Phrygian territory, after which he sent captured Cimmerian city-lords as diplomatic gifts to Ashurbanipal.

Gyges then stationed Carian and Ionian mercenaries at Abydos, which provided an impetus for the formation of new Greek colonies in the Propontis and therefore made the Black Sea accessible to Greeks from Ionia.

The defeat of the Cimmerians by Gyges in turn weakened their allies, Mugallu of Tabal and Sandašarme of Ḫilakku, enough that they were left with no choice but to submit to the authority of the Neo-Assyrian Empire in .

=====Hegemony in the Levant=====
Facing resistance from the Lydians in the west, the Cimmerians moved eastwards, against the Neo-Assyrian Empire: despite their defeat by Gyges in the , the Cimmerians&#x27; power soon grew much so that by they were not only in control of a large territory in Anatolia and were one of the main political forces operating in this region, but were also able conquer part of what had previously been secure western possessions of the Neo-Assyrian Empire, such as the province of Que or even part of the Levant.

These Cimmerian aggressions worried Ashurbanipal about the security of the northwest border of the Neo-Assyrian Empire enough that he sought answers concerning this situation through divination. And, as a result of these Cimmerian conquests, by 657 BC, the Assyrian astrologer Akkullanu was calling the Cimmerian king Dugdammî by the title of (), which in the Mesopotamian worldview was a title that could belong only a single ruler in the world at any given time, and was normally held by the King of the Neo-Assyrian Empire. This attribution of the title of to a foreign ruler was an unprecedented situation of which there is no other known occurrence throughout the duration of the Neo-Assyrian Empire.

Akkullanu nevertheless also assured to Ashurbanipal that he would eventually regain the , that is the world hegemony which rightfully belonged to him, from the Cimmerians who had usurped it.

This extraordinary situation meant that, under Dugdammî, who was their most powerful king, the Cimmerians had become a force feared by Ashurbanipal, and the Cimmerians&#x27; successes against the Neo-Assyrian Empire meant that they had become recognised in ancient West Asia as equally powerful as Ashurbanipal himself.

This situation remained unchanged throughout the rest of the 650s and the early 640s BC, with the Cimmerian aggressions worrying Ashurbanipal regarding the security of his northwestern border so much that he often sought answers regarding this situation through divination.

These setbacks, along with Ashurbanipal&#x27;s refusal to provide military support to Lydia, discredited Neo-Assyrian power enough that Gyges understood that he could not rely on Assyrian support against the Cimmerians, and, once the Cimmerians had moved to the east and their attacks on his kingdom decreased, he therefore ended diplomacy with the Neo-Assyrian Empire and instead sent troops to help the Egyptian kinglet Psamtik I of Sais, who had himself been a Neo-Assyrian vassal who was then eliminating the other Neo-Assyrian vassal kinglets in Lower Egypt to unite the whole of Egypt under his own rule. Ashurbanipal responded to Gyges&#x27;s disengagement with the Neo-Assyrian Empire by cursing him.

=====Exhaustion of Assyria=====
Neo-Assyrian power experienced another significant blow in 652 BC, when Esarhaddon&#x27;s eldest son, Šamaš-šuma-ukin, who had succeeded him as king of Babylon, rebelled against his younger brother Ashurbanipal: it took Ashurbanipal four years to fully suppress the Babylonian rebellion by 648 BC, and another year to destroy the power of Elam, who had supported Šamaš-šuma-ukin, and, although Ashurbanipal would nevertheless be able to maintain control over Babylonia for the rest of his reign, the Neo-Assyrian Empire finally emerged from this crisis severely worn out.

One of the oracular responses received by Ashurbanipal in 652 BC itself claimed that the goddess Ishtar had promised to him that the Cimmerians would be defeated similarly to how Ashurbanipal himself had defeated the Elamites and killed their king Teumman in 653 BC.

Meanwhile, Dugdammî might have taken advantage of the civil war within the Neo-Assyrian Empire caused by Samas-suma-ukin&#x27;s rebellion to attack northwestern Neo-Assyrian provinces.

=====Attack on Šubria=====
In the 650s BC, the Cimmerians were allied to Urartu and were serving as auxiliaries in the service of its king Rusa II, who was then attempting to attack the newly conquered Assyrian province of Šubria near the Urartian border. Urartu was thus integrating steppe nomad mercenaries into its armed forces, and was also trying to borrow the military technology of these peoples.

======Alliance with the Treres======

Around the , the Thracian tribe of the Treres migrated across the Thracian Bosporus and invaded Anatolia from the north-west, after which they allied with the Cimmerians, and, from around the , the Cimmerians were nomadising in Anatolia along with the Treres.

=====Second attack on Lydia=====
The Cimmerians and Treres under Lygdamis and the Treran king Kōbos, and in alliance with the Lycians or Lycaonians, attacked Lydia for a second time in 644 BC: this time they defeated the Lydians and captured their capital city of Sardis except for its citadel, and Gyges was killed during this attack. The Neo-Assyrian sources blamed Gyges&#x27;s death on his own , that is on his own independent actions, by claiming that the Cimmerians invaded Lydia and killed him as punishment for him providing Psamtik I with the troops he used to eliminate the other pro-Assyrian Egyptian kinglets and unify Egypt under his sole rule.

After this attack, Gyges&#x27;s son Ardys succeeded him as king of Lydia and resumed diplomatic activity with the Neo-Assyrian Empire with the hope of military support which Ashurbanipal again did not provide. As a result, Ardys might possibly have been forced to submit to the Cimmerians, although the Cimmerians themselves never ruled Lydia.

=====Attack on Ionia and Aeolia=====
After sacking Sardis, Lydgamis and Kobos led the Cimmerians and the Treres into invading the Greek city-states of the Troad, Aeolia and Ionia on the western coast of Anatolia, where they destroyed the city of Magnesia on the Meander as well as the Artemision of Ephesus. The city of Colophon joined Ephesus and Magnesia in resisting the Cimmerian invasion.

The Cimmerians and Treres remained on the western coast of Anatolia inhabited by the Greeks for three years, from to , where later Greek tradition claimed that Lygdamis had occupied Antandros and Priene, which forced a large number of the inhabitants of the coastal region called Batinētis to flee to the islands of the Aegean Sea.

=====Activities in Cilicia=====
Sensing the exhaustion of Neo-Assyrian power following the suppression of the revolt of Šamaš-šuma-ukin, the Cimmerians and Treres moved to Cilicia on the north-west border of the Neo-Assyrian Empire in itself, immediately after their third invasion of Lydia and the attack on the Asian Greek cities. There, Dugdammî allied with Mugallu&#x27;s son and successor as king of the then rebellious Assyrian vassal state of Tabal, Mussi, to attack the Neo-Assyrian Empire.

Although the Urartians had sent tribute to the Neo-Assyrian Empire in 643 BC, the Urartian king Sarduri III (), who had been a Neo-Assyrian vassal, was at this time also forced to accept the suzerainty of the Cimmerians.

However, Mussi died before the planned attack on Neo-Assyrian Empire and his kingdom collapsed when its elite fled or was deported to Assyria, while Dugdammî carried it out but failed because, according to Neo-Assyrian sources, he became ill and fire broke out in his camp. Following this, Dugdammî was faced with a revolt against himself, after which ended his hostilities against the Neo-Assyrian Empire and sent tribute to Ashurbanipal to form an alliance with him, while Ashurbanipal forced Dugdammi to swear an oath to not attack the Neo-Assyrian Empire.

======Death of Dugdammî======
Dugdammî soon broke his oath and attacked the Neo-Assyrian Empire again, but during his military campaign he contracted a grave illness whose symptoms included paralysis of half of his body and vomiting of blood as well as gangrene of the genitals, and he consequently committed suicide in 640 BC in Cilicia itself.

Dugdammî was succeeded as king of the Cimmerians in Cilicia by his son Sandakšatru, who continued Dugdammî&#x27;s attacks against the Neo-Assyrian Empire but failed just like his father.

The power of the Cimmerians dwindled quickly after the death of Dugdammî, although the Lydian kings Ardys and Sadyattes might however have either died fighting the Cimmerians or were deposed for being incapable of efficiently fighting them, respectively in and .

=====Final defeat=====

Despite these setbacks, the Lydian kingdom was able to grow in power, and the Lydians themselves appear to have adopted Cimmerian military practices such as the use of mounted cavalry, with the Lydians fighting using long spears and archers, both on horseback.

Around , and with Neo-Assyrian approval, the Scythians under their king Madyes conquered Urartu, entered Central Anatolia, and defeated the Cimmerians and Treres. This final defeat of the Cimmerians was carried out by the joint forces of Madyes&#x27;s Scythians, whom Strabo of Amasia credits with expelling the Treres from Asia Minor, and of the Lydians led by their king Alyattes, who was himself the son of Sadyattes as well as the grandson of Ardys and the great-grandson of Gyges, whom Herodotus of Halicarnassus and Polyaenus of Bithynia claim permanently defeated the Cimmerians so that they no longer constituted a threat.

In an inscription from after , Ashurbanipal thanked the god Marduk for the fate which had struck Sandakšatru, suggesting that he had experienced a horrifying death not unlike his father&#x27;s.

The Cimmerians completely disappeared from history following this final defeat, and they were soon assimilated by the various populations and polities of Anatolia, such as Lydia, Media, and Pteria. It was also around this time that the last still-existing Syro-Hittite and Aramaean states in Anatolia, which had been either independent or vassals of the Neo-Assyrian Empire, Phrygia, Urartu, or of the Cimmerians, also disappeared, although the exact circumstances of their end are still very uncertain.

Scythian power in West Asia thus reached its peak under Madyes, with the West Asian territories ruled by the Scythian kingdom extending from the Halys river in Anatolia in the west to the Caspian Sea and the eastern borders of Media in the east, and from Transcaucasia in the north to the northern borders of the Neo-Assyrian Empire in the south. And, following the defeat of the Cimmerians and the disappearance of these states, it was the new Lydian Empire of Alyattes which became the dominant power of Anatolia, while the city of Sinope was re-founded by the Milesian Greek colonists Kōos and Krētinēs.

====Impact in West Asia====
The inroads of the Cimmerians and the Scythians into West Asia over the course of the 8th to 7th centuries BC had destabilised the political balance which had prevailed in the region between the dominant great powers of Assyria, Urartu, and Phrygia, and also caused the decline and destruction of several of these states&#x27; power, consequently led to the rise of multiple new powers such as the empires of the Medes and Lydians, thus irreversibly changing the geopolitical situation of West Asia.

The Cimmerian and Scythian activities in West Asia also hampered the development of trade, and overland trade routes in the region such as the Great Khorasan Road likely became dangerous to use, while also preventing the formation of new trade routes.

These Cimmerian and Scythian activities also influenced the developments in West Asia through the spread of the steppe nomad military technology brought by them into this region, and which were disseminated during the periods of their respective hegemonies in West Asia.

===Possible migration in Europe===
It has been hypothesised that some Cimmerians might have migrated into Eastern, Southeast and Central Europe, although this identification is presently considered very uncertain.

Proponents of a Cimmerian migration into southeastern Europe suggest that it affected as far as Thrace, where between 700 and 650 BC the Edoni allied with the Cimmerians to expand their territories by occupying Mygdonia and the area up to the Axios river at the expense of the Sintians and the Siropaiones.

The proponents of this hypothesis of a Cimmerian invasion also suggest that it would have also affected south-eastern Illyria, where raids by Cimmerians allied to Thracians ended the hegemony of Illyrian tribes around 650 BC, and possibly into Epirus as well, where distinctive Cimmerian horse trappings were found offered in dedication at the temple of Dodona.

===Legacy===
====Ancient====
=====In Europe=====
The peoples of the Chernogorovka-Novocherkassk complex of which the Cimmerians were part of introduced the use of trousers into Central Europe, whose local native populations did not wear trousers before the arrival of the first wave of steppe nomads of Central Asian origin into Europe.

=====In West Asia=====
The inroads of the Cimmerians and the Scythians into West Asia over the course of the 8th to 7th centuries BC, which were early precursors of the later invasions of West Asia by steppe nomads such as the Huns, various Turkic peoples, and the Mongols, in Late Antiquity and the Mediaeval Period, had destabilised the political balance which had prevailed in the region between the dominant great powers of Assyria, Urartu, and Phrygia, and also caused the decline and destruction of several of these states&#x27; power, consequently to the rise of multiple new powers such as the empires of the Medes and Lydians, thus irreversibly changing the geopolitical situation of West Asia.

These Cimmerians and Scythians also influenced the developments in West Asia through the spread of the steppe nomad military technology brought by them into this region, and which were disseminated during the periods of their respective hegemonies in West Asia.

After the end of the Neo-Assyrian Empire, and following the conquest of the Neo-Babylonian Empire which had succeeded it by the Persian Achaemenids, the Babylonian scribes of the Achaemenid Persian Empire used the name of the Cimmerians (: and ) in Neo-Babylonian Akkadian to indiscriminately and anachronistically refer to all of the nomads of the steppes, including both the Pontic Scythians and the Central Asian Saka, because of their similar nomadic lifestyles. The Achaemenid Babylonian scribes therefore designated the bows used by Saka mounted archers as (, and , ). The Greeks similarly used the name of the Scythians as a generalising term for all stepp nomads, and the Byzantines later also similarly used it as an archaising term to designate the Huns, Slavs and other eastern peoples centuries after the actual Scythians had disappeared.

The Cimmerians appear in the Hebrew Bible under the name of  (; ), where is closely linked to  (), that is to the Scythians.

Due to the fear that the Cimmerian invasions caused among the Greeks of Ionia, they were remembered in Greek tradition, and an inscription from 283 BC mentioned that the Greek city-states of Samos and Priene were still engaging in a lawsuit disputing the territory of Batinetis which had been abandoned during the Cimmerian invasion of Ionia and Aeolia.

In the mediaeval period, Armenian tradition assigned the name of the Biblical Gōmer to the Konya Plain and to Cappadocia, which was therefore called () in the Armenian language.

=====In Graeco-Roman literature=====
======In Homer&#x27;s ======
The first mention of the Cimmerians in Graeco-Roman literature dates from the 8th century BC in Homer&#x27;s , which describes them as a people living in a city located at the entrance of Hades beyond the western shore of the Oceanus river which encircles the world, in a land towards which Odysseus sailed to obtain an oracle from the soul of the seer Tiresias, and which was covered with mists and clouds and therefore remained permanently deprived of sunlight although the Sun-god Helios sets there.

This mention of the Cimmerians in the was purely poetic and combined fantasy with records of real events, and naturalism with supernatural elements, and therefore contained no reliable information about the real Cimmerian people. This image was created as a poetic opposite of the Laestrygonians and Aethiopians who, in ancient Greek mythology, lived in a permanently sunlit land on the eastern borders of the world. Due to this location, the Ancient Greek name of the Cimmerians was identified with the word for mist, ().

Homer&#x27;s passage relating to the Cimmerians had however used as its source the Argonautic myth, which dealt with the region of the Black Sea and the country of Colchis, on whose eastern borders the Cimmerians were still living in the 8th century BC. Thus, Homer&#x27;s source on the Cimmerians was the Argonautic myth, which itself recorded of their existence when they were still living in northern Transcaucasia: the location of the Cimmerians as recorded by the Argonautic myth corresponds to the same one recorded by the late 7th century BC poem by Aristeas of Proconessus and the later writings of Herodotus of Halicarnassus, who both described the Cimmerians as having once dwelt in the steppe to the immediate north of the Caspian Sea, with the Araxes river (the Volga) forming their eastern border separating them from the Scythians.

======In the 6th century BC======
The Greeks living in Anatolia in the 6th century BC still evoked the memory of the Cimmerians with fear a century after their disappearance.

The Greek historian Hecataeus of Miletus, drawing from information acquired by the Persian army during its invasion of Scythia in 513 BC, later started the tradition of locating Homer&#x27;s Cimmerians and &quot;Cimmerian&quot; places (such as a &quot;Cimmerian city&quot;) in the Scythian-dominated Pontic Steppe between the Araxes and the Bosporus.

======According to Herodotus of Halicarnassus======
Herodotus of Halicarnassus wrote a legendary account, partly based on Hecataeus&#x27;s narrative, of the arrival of the Scythians into the lands of the Cimmerians:
#after the Scythians were expelled from Central Asia by the Massagetae, they moved to the west across the Araxes, and took possession of the Cimmerians&#x27; lands after chasing them away;
#the approach of the Scythians led to a civil war among the Cimmerians because the &quot;royal tribe&quot; wanted to remain in their lands and defend themselves from the invaders, while the rest of the people saw no use in fighting and preferred to flee;
#since neither side could be persuaded by the other, the &quot;royal tribe&quot; divided themselves into two equally numerous sides that fought each other till death, after which the commoners buried them by the Tyras river.

Basing himself on Greek folk tales from the city of Tyras, Herodotus claimed the tombs of the Cimmerian princes could still be seen in his days near the Tyras river.

Herodotus also referred to the presence of several &quot;Cimmerian&quot; toponyms as existing in the Bosporan region, such as:
*&quot;Cimmerian walls&quot; (),
*a &quot;Cimmerian ferry&quot; (),
*a &quot;country of Cimmeria&quot; (),
*and a &quot;Cimmerian Bosporus&quot; ().

Herodotus likely used Bosporan Greek folk tales as source for these claims, although some of the &quot;Cimmerian&quot; toponyms in the Bosporan region might have originated from a genuine Cimmerian presence in this area.

The story of the fratricidal war of the Cimmerian &quot;royal tribe,&quot; that is of the defeat and destruction of its ruling class, is contradicted by how powerful the Cimmerians were according to the Assyrian records contemporaneous with their presence in West Asia. Another inconsistency in Herodotus&#x27;s description of the flight of the Cimmerians is the direction through which they retreated: according to this narrative, the Cimmerians moved from the Pontic Steppe to the east into Caucasia to flee from the Scythians, who were themselves moving from the east into the Pontic Steppe.

These inconsistencies suggest that Herodotus&#x27;s narrative of an eastern flight of the Cimmerians was a later folk tale invented by Greek colonists on the north shore of the Black Sea to explain the existence of ancient tombs, reflecting the motif of assigning old tombs and buildings with mythical heroes or with lost ancient valiant peoples, similarly to how the Greeks within Greece proper claimed similar remains had been built by the Pelasgi and the Cyclops, or how later Ossetian tradition recounted the death of the Narts.

Herodotus&#x27;s account of the Cimmerians&#x27; flight contracted the actual events into a more condensed story where they moved south by following the shore of the Black Sea under the leadership of Lygdamis, while their Scythian pursuers followed the Caspian Sea&#x27;s coast, thus leading the Cimmerians into Anatolia and the Scythians into Media. While Cimmerian activities in Anatolia and Scythian activities in Media are attested, the claim that the Scythians arrived in Media while pursuing the Cimmerians is unsupported by evidence, and the arrival of the Scythians in West Asia about 40 years after that of the Cimmerians suggests that there is no available evidence to the later Graeco-Roman account of the Cimmerians crossing the Caucasus and moving south into West Asia under pressure from the Scythians migrating into their territories.

Moreover, Herodotus&#x27;s account also ignored the earlier Cimmerian activities in West Asia during the reigns of Sargon II to the ascension of Ashurbanipal, including the two separate invasions of Lydia, and instead contracted them into a single event during which Lydgamis led the Cimmerians from the steppes into Anatolia to sack Sardis under the reign of Ardys.

======In later Graeco-Roman literature======
Drawing on similar older Graeco-Roman sources, Strabo of Amasia claimed that the Cimmerian Bosporus had been named after the Cimmerians, who were once powerful in that region, and that the city of &quot;&quot; (; ) used a trench and a mount to close the isthmus. According to Strabo, there was in Crimea a mountain called (; ), which had also been named because the Cimmerians had once ruled the region of the Bosporus.

In the 4th century BC, a town called Cimmeris was established in the Sindic Chersonese.

Homer&#x27;s description of the Cimmerians as living deprived from sunlight and close to the entrance of Hades influenced later Graeco-Roman authors who, writing centuries after the disappearance of the historical Cimmerians, conceptualised of this people as the one described by Homer, and therefore assigned to them various fantastical locations and histories:
*some Classical writers considered the western Mediterranean Sea as having been the setting of the , and therefore located the Cimmerians in this region:
**Ephorus of Cyme in the 4th century BC located the Cimmerians near the Campanian city of Cumae in Magna Graecia in southern Italy, where 
***following Ephorus&#x27;s narrative, Strabo and Pliny claimed that a &quot;Cimmerian city&quot; () was located near the Lake Avernus in Italy:
****Strabo, himself citing Ephorus, claimed that, because the inhabitants of Magna Graecia placed the setting of the Odyssey&#x27;s Nekyia around Lake Arvernus, they also depicted the Cimmerians as a people living in this area in underground houses tunnels around the nearby Ploutonion (oracle of the dead) where was believed to be the entrance to Hades; these &quot;underground Cimmerians&quot; visited each other using tunnels through which they would also admit strangers to the also underground oracle: according to this legend, these &quot;underground Cimmerians&quot; had an ancestral custom according to which they should never see the sun and were allowed to go out only at night;
*Hecataeus of Abdera claimed that the Cimmerians lived in a &quot;Cimmerian city&quot; () located in Hyperborea in the north;
*Aeschylus mentioned a &quot;Cimmerian isthmus&quot; and a &quot;Cimmerian land&quot; in his work, ;
*Posidonius of Apamea, while trying to explain where the Cimbri came from, elaborated some speculative interpretations of their origins:
**drawing on the similarity of the names of the Cimmerians and Cimbri, Posidonius equated these two peoples with each other, and then claimed that the Cimmerians who passed into West Asia were merely a small body of exiles, while the bulk of the Cimmerians lived in the thickly wooded and sun-less far north, between the shores of the Oceanus and the Hercynian Forest, and were the same people known as the Cimbri;
***Since the Cimmerians and Cimbri had similar names, and they were also both perceived by the Graeco-Romans as ferocious and barbarian peoples who caused death and destruction, the ancient Greek literary traditions progressively equated and identified them with each other.
**Posidonius then, in turn, argued that the Cimmerian Bosporus (Kerch Strait) had been named after the Cimbri, whom he claimed the Greeks called &quot;Cimmerians.&quot;
***Plutarch criticised Posidonius&#x27;s theories as being based on conjecture rather than on concrete historical evidence.
***Strabo and Diodorus of Sicily, using Posidonius as their sources, also equated the Cimmerians and the Cimbri.
*Crates of Mallos, in the 2nd century BC, wrote a commentary on the  and the in which he assumed that Homer did not know of the Cimmerians and therefore renamed them in his text as the &quot;Cerberians&quot; () because of the Homeric location of this people at the entrance of Hades where dwelt Cerberus.
*Proteus of Zeugma renamed the Cimmerians as the (), .
The eastern Greeks living on the north shore of the Black Sea, who were familiar with the Cimmerian activities in Asia, nevertheless criticised these western locations assigned to the Cimmerians.

====Modern====
Basing themselves on the location of the Cimmerians in the as living on the western shore of the Oceanus, some earlier modern interpretations tried to locate them in the far north of Europe, such as in Britain and Jutland.

In the 18th to 20th centuries, the racialist British Israelist movement developed a pseudohistory according to which, after population of the historical kingdom of Israel had been deported by the Neo-Assyrian Empire in 721 BC and became the Ten Lost Tribes, they fled north to the region near Sinope, from where they migrated into East and Central Europe and became the Scythians and Cimmerians, who themselves moved to north-west Europe and became the supposed ancestors of the white Protestant peoples of North Europe, with the being the supposed descendants of those among them who maintained their Cimmerian identity. Being an antisemitic movement, British Israelists claim to be the most authentic heirs of the ancient Israelites while rejecting Jews as being &quot;contaminated&quot; through intermarriage with Edomites; or, they adhere to the antisemitic conspiracy theory claiming that Jews descend from the Khazars. According to the scholar Tudor Parfitt, the proof cited by adherents of British Israelism is &quot;of a feeble composition even by the low standards of the genre.&quot;

Research in the late 20th century AD eventually concluded that the various &quot;Cimmerian&quot; toponymies from the Pontic Steppe were invented during the 6th century BC, that is when the Pontic Steppe was under Scythian rule, long after the historical Cimmerians had disappeared.

=====In popular culture=====
The character of Conan the Barbarian, created by Robert E. Howard in a series of fantasy stories published in  from 1932, is canonically a Cimmerian: in Howard&#x27;s fictional Hyborian Age, the Cimmerians are a pre-Celtic people who were the ancestors of the Irish and Scots (Gaels). Moreover, a miscegenation of Cimmerians and Turanians was given as the origin of the Scyths.

, a novel by Michael Chabon, includes a chapter describing the (fictional) oldest book in the world, , created by ancient Cimmerians.

Isaac Asimov attempted to trace various place names to Cimmerian origins. He suggested that gave rise to the Turkic toponym , which in turn gave rise to the name. The derivation of the name of Crimea from that of the Cimmerians is however no longer accepted, and it is now thought to have originated from the Crimean Tatar word , which means &quot;fortress.&quot;

Manau&#x27;s song  recounts an imaginary battle between Celts and enemies identified by the narrator as Cimmerians.

==Culture and society==
===Location===
====In the Caspian Steppe====
The original homeland of the Cimmerians before they migrated into West Asia was in the steppe situated to the north of the Caspian Sea and to the west of the Araxēs (Volga) river until the Cimmerian Bosporus (the Ketch Strait) and some Cimmerians might have nomadised in the Kuban steppe; the Cimmerians thus originally lived in the Caspian and Caucasian steppes, in the area corresponding to present-day Southern Russia.

The region of the Pontic Steppe to the north of the Lake Maeotis was instead inhabited by the Agathyrsi, who were another nomadic Iranic tribe related to the Cimmerians, and the claim in earlier scholarship that the Cimmerians lived in the Pontic Steppe appears to be erroneous and lacks evidence to support it.

The later claim by Greek authors that the Cimmerians lived in the Pontic Steppe around the Tyras river was a retroactive invention dating from after the disappearance of the Cimmerians.

====In West Asia====
=====In Transcaucasia=====
During the initial phase of their presence in West Asia, the Cimmerians lived in a country which Mesopotamian sources called () or (), that is the , located around the Kuros river, to the north and north-west of Lake Sevan and the south of the Darial or Klukhor passes, in a region of Transcaucasia to the east of Colchis corresponding to the modern-day Gori, in southern Georgia.

=====In Anatolia and on the Iranian Plateau=====
The Cimmerians later split into two groups, with a western horde located in Anatolia, and an eastern horde which moved into Mannai and later Media.

===Ethnicity===
The Cimmerians were a Iranic people sharing a common language, origins and culture with the Scythians, although they may have been an ethnically heterogeneous tribal confederation living under an Iranic aristocracy, not unlike how the polity of the Scythians consisted of various peoples living under the dominance of the Iranic Royal Scythians.

And, while the Cimmerians are archaeologically, culturally and linguistically indistinguishable from the Scythians, all Mesopotamian and Greek sources contemporary to their activities sources both nevertheless clearly distinguished between the Cimmerians and the Scythians as separate political entities, suggesting that the Scythians and Cimmerians were merely two member tribes of a single cultural group.

Other suggestions for the ethnicity of the Cimmerians include the possibility of them being Thracian. However the proposal of a Thracian origin of the Cimmerians is untenable and arose from a confusion by Strabo of Amasia between the Cimmerians and their allies, the Thracian tribe of the Treres. According to the scholar Igor Diakonoff, the possibility of the Cimmerians being Thracian-speakers is less likely than that of them being Iranic-speakers.

====Language====
According to the historian Muhammad Dandamayev and the linguist János Harmatta, the Cimmerians spoke a dialect belonging to the Scythian group of Iranic languages, and were able to communicate with Scythians proper without needing interpreters.

The Iranologist Ľubomír Novák considers Cimmerian to be a relative of Scythian which exhibited similar features as Scythian, such as the evolution of the sound into .

According to Igor Diakonoff, the Cimmerians spoke a Scythian language belonging to the eastern branch of the Iranic language. The Scythologist Askold Ivantchik also considers the Cimmerians to have been linguistically very close to the Scythians.

The recorded personal names of the Cimmerians were either Iranic, reflecting their origins, or Anatolian, reflecting the cultural influence of the native populations of Asia Minor on them after their migration there.
Only a few personal names in the Cimmerian language have survived in Assyrian inscriptions:
* () or ():
**According to the linguist János Harmatta, it goes back to Old Iranic , meaning &quot;swelling with strength&quot;, although Askold Ivantchik has criticised this proposal on phonetic grounds.
**Askold Ivantchik instead posits three alternative suggestions for an Old Iranic origin of :
*** &quot;abductor of horses&quot;
*** &quot;abductor dog&quot;
*** &quot;divine dog&quot;
* or (), and recorded as () and () by Greek authors
**K. T. Vitchak has proposed that it was derived from an Old Iranic form , meaning &quot;owner of milk-producing sheep.&quot;
**According to the Scythologist , the original form of this name was likely , formed from the word , meaning &quot;milk.&quot;
**The Iranologist Ľubomír Novák has noted that the attestation of this name in the forms and in Akkadian and the forms and in Greek shows that its first consonant had experienced the change of the sound /d/ to /l/, which is consistent with the phonetic changes attested in the Scythian languages.
* (): this is an Iranic reading of the name, and Manfred Mayrhofer (1981) points out that the name may also be read as .
**According to János Harmatta, it goes back to Old Iranic &quot;splendid son.&quot;
**Askold Ivantchik derives the name from a compound term consisting of the name of the Anatolian deity , and of the Iranic term .

===Social organisation===
====Tribal structure====
The Cimmerians might have been a confederation composed of several tribes spread across Anatolia and the western Iranian Plateau, and which was in turn divided into larger groups depending on political changes. A similar structure is attested in mediaeval times among the Oguz Turks, whose single kingdom was divided into two wings each ruled by a member of the same dynasty and each made up of several tribes.

====Administrative structure====
The Cimmerians, like the Scythians, were organised into a tribal nomadic state with its own territorial boundaries, and comprising both pastoralist and urban elements.

Such nomadic states were managed by institutions of authority presided over by the rulers of the tribes, the warrior aristocracy, and ruling dynasty.

=====Kingship=====
The Cimmerians were ruled by a supreme king whose power was passed down in a single dynasty. The names of three Cimmerian kings have been recorded: Teušpâ, Dugdammî, and Sandakšatru.

=====Assemblies=====
The Cimmerians had military assemblies composed of their troops, which the king had the power to convene to assist him. Cimmerian warlords were also capable of rebelling against the king.

Once the Cimmerians in Anatolia had become sedentary, they formed settlements which were ruled by city-lords not unlike those who ruled the city-states of the Medes.

===Lifestyle===
====Nomadism and sedentarisation====
The Cimmerians shared a common culture and origin with the Scythians and lived an equestrian nomadic pastoralist way of life similar to that of the Scythians, which is reflected by how West Asian sources mentioned Cimmerian arrows, bows and horse equipment, which are typical of steppe nomads.

After the Cimmerians who had migrated into West Asia had divided into two groups, the western horde living in Anatolia had become sedentary and were living in settlements, some of which were fortified, and which had either been founded by them or were native Anatolian settlements over whom the Cimmerians had established their rule. The capital of these Anatolian Cimmerians was a city by the name of Ḫarzallē.

These settlements were administered by leaders who were part of a hierarchical system, and who were either Cimmerians themselves or belonged to the various ethnic groups living within the Cimmerian kingdom in Anatolia. The Neo-Assyrian Empire considered these leaders to be equivalents of the rulers of the contemporary Median city-states, due to which they referred to the leaders of these Cimmerian rulers as (), which was the same designation that they had used for the Median petty-rulers as well.

====Equestrianism====
The &quot;mare-milkers&quot; () and &quot;milk consumers&quot; () from Homer&#x27;s might have been a reference to the Cimmerians, who had this lifestyle in common with the Scythians, as attested by Hesiod&#x27;s description of the Scythians as living in the same way.

The Cimmerians used the same types of horse harness as the Scythians.

===Art===
The Cimmerians used the same type of &quot;Animal-style&quot; art as the Scythians.

===Religion===
The western group of the Cimmerians who migrated into West Asia appeared to have adopted the worship of the Anatolian deity Šanta from the local inhabitants of Ḫilakku and Tabal. The name of the god Šanta might possibly appear as a theophoric element in the name of the Cimmerian king Sandakšatru.

===Warfare===
The Cimmerians used the same types of weapons as the Scythians, and practised mounted warfare just like them.

The Cimmerians who moved in Anatolia also adopted the use of chariot warfare and unmounted infantry.

===Genetics===
A genetic study published in Science Advances in October 2018 examined the remains of three Cimmerians buried between around 1000 and 800 BC. The two samples of Y-DNA extracted belonged to haplogroups R1b1a and Q1a1, while the three samples of mtDNA extracted belonged to haplogroups H9a, C5c and R. 

Another genetic study published in &quot;Current Biology&quot; in July 2019 examined the remains of three Cimmerians. The two samples of Y-DNA extracted belonged to haplogroups R1a-Z645 and R1a2c-B111, while the three samples of mtDNA extracted belonged to haplogroups H35, U5a1b1 and U2e2.

== Archaeology ==
===In the Eurasian Steppe===
The Cimmerians were part of the Scytho-Siberian horizon, and they produced a Scythian-like material culture. Archaeological remains typical of Iron Age steppe nomads found in Caucasia and Transcaucasia, consisting of kurgans, weapons, horse harness parts, horses, stirrups, arrowheads, and Animal Style ornaments, might have belonged to the Cimmerians.

The Cimmerians before their migration into West Asia archaeologically corresponded to a part of the Chernogorovka-Novocherkassk complex of the northern Pontic steppe regions over the course of the 9th to 7th centuries BC.

The Chernogorovka-Novocherkassk complex thus developed natively in the North Pontic region over the course of the 9th to mid-7th centuries BC from elements which had earlier arrived from Central Asia, due to which the Chernogorovka-Novocherkassk complex itself exhibited similarities with the other early nomadic cultures of the Eurasian steppe and forest-steppe which existed before the 7th century BC, such as the Aržan culture, so that these various pre-Scythian early nomadic cultures were thus part of a unified Aržan-Chernogorovka cultural layer originating from Central Asia.

Both the Cimmerians and the early Scythians thus belonged to pre-Scythian archaeological cultures, and the material culture of the Cimmerians was therefore similar enough to that of the later Scythians who followed them that the Chernogorovka-Novocherkassk and Proto-Scythian cultures are archaeologically indistinguishable from each other.

===In West Asia===
The movement of the Cimmerians and Scythians into West Asia archaeologically corresponds to the movement of these pre-Scythian archaeological cultures into this region, where both groups used identical arrowheads, thus making it difficult to distinguish the Cimmerians from the early Scythians.

By the time the Cimmerians had moved into West Asia, their culture along with the pre-Scythian culture of the Scythians had evolved into the Early Scythian culture: several &quot;Early Scythian&quot; remains are known from West Asia which correspond to the activities of the Cimmerians in this region, with &quot;Scythian&quot; arrowheads have been found among the weapons of besieging armies of ruined cities in parts of Anatolia where Cimmerians are attested have operated but where Scythians were not active.

Despite textual sources attesting of Cimmerian activities in Anatolia which strongly affected the polities in that region, their presence there has largely still not been identified in the archaeology of Iron Age Anatolia.

The few known Cimmerian archaeological remains from the period of their presence in Anatolia include a burial from the village of İmirler in the Amasya Province of Turkey which contains typically Early Scythian weapons and horse harnesses. Another Cimmerian burial, located at about 100 km to the east of İmirler and 50 km from Samsun, contained 250 Scythian-type arrowheads.

The site of Büklükale, where was discovered Scythian-type animal style ornaments, might have been the location of a Cimmerian settlement, although this identification is still uncertain.

<text>Mineola is a village and the county seat of Nassau County, on Long Island, New York, United States. The population was 20,800 at the time of the 2020 census. The village&#x27;s name is derived from an Algonquin Chief, Miniolagamika, which means &quot;pleasant village&quot;.

The Incorporated Village of Mineola is located primarily in the Town of North Hempstead, with the exception being a small portion of its southern edge within the Town of Hempstead. Old Country Road runs along the village&#x27;s southern border.

The area serviced by the Mineola Post Office extends farther south into the adjacent village of Garden City, where the Old Nassau County Courthouse is located. Offices of many Nassau County agencies are in both Mineola and Garden City.

== History ==


The central, flat, grassy part of Long Island was originally known as the Hempstead Plains. In the 19th century, various communities were started in this area. One of those communities was called &quot;Hempstead Branch,&quot; which would ultimately be known as &quot;Mineola&quot; later on.

Long Island was part of Henry Hudson&#x27;s original claim in the name of the Dutch East India Company dating as far back as 1609. In the 18th century, the Dutch and English settlers worked to clear farmland to start their life on the Hempstead Plains. It was in 1858 when this land was named after an Algonquin Indian Chief, Miniolagamika meaning, &quot;Pleasant Village&quot;. The name was later shortened and altered to &quot;Mineola&quot;.

From about 1787 until the 1870s, the area was the county seat for Queens County, in a section then known as Clowesville, just outside the present village boundaries. The western portion of Queens became a borough of New York City in 1898, and in 1899, Nassau County was formed from the part of Queens that did not consolidate. Voters selected Mineola (in the Town of North Hempstead) to be the county seat for the new county of Nassau in November 1898(before Mineola incorporated as a village in 1906 and set its boundaries), winning out over Hicksville and Hempstead. The Garden City Company (founded in 1893 by the heirs of Alexander Turney Stewart) donated four acres of land for the county buildings just south of the Mineola train station and the present day Village of Mineola, in the Town of Hempstead.

Mineola officially became the County Seat of Nassau County on July 13, 1900, as Governor Theodore Roosevelt laid the cornerstone of the Nassau County Court House. A celebration was held to commemorate the occasion on the barren site at the corner of Old Country Road and Franklin Avenue. Many dignitaries were present to witness this event such as Frederick Hicks, Congressman Townsend Scudder, Colonel William Youngs and Supervisors William Jones and Edwin Willits.

Mineola was legally incorporated as a village in 1906 and run by a president. The land on which the County buildings sat was not included as part of the village. The land and the buildings have a Mineola postal address, but are within the present day Village of Garden City, which did not incorporate or set its boundaries until 1919.

NYU Langone Hospital – Long Island, founded in 1896 by local physicians and residents as Nassau Hospital, and later Winthrop-University Hospital, was Long Island&#x27;s first voluntary hospital. In 1897, it admitted 91 patients, performed 27 operations, and reported two births and eight deaths during the first year. The original hospital was constructed in 1900. Renamed Winthrop-University Hospital in the 1980s, it is now a nationally recognized award-winning hospital and in 2004 was ranked among the Top 5 Percent of Acute-Care Hospitals in the Country.

In 1888, the Mineola Fire Department was formed in the Willis Ave School house. The department soon moved to a location on Washington Ave. The department originally consisted of volunteer firemen and would officially be incorporated as an official company in 1889.

In 1840, the Mineola Hotel was built by resident John A. Searing across the rail station that was completed the year prior. When the village was separated from Queens and became the county seat of Nassau, it was renamed to Allen&#x27;s Mineola Hotel. It is considered a landmark alongside the local offices and agencies in Garden City. An adjacent inn, also named the Mineola Hotel, burned down in 1966 as the result of arson. One man was killed and seven others were injured. A jobless machinist, a 20 year old hotel resident named Chlary Skorge, Jr. who was previously on probation for robbery, was indicted for murder. The cause was speculated to be revenge, as he was threatened with eviction after annoying fellow residents.

Main Street was the center of village business as well as a popular meeting place for farmers and the business community alike. The general store offered an array of goods that would fulfill most everyday needs, such as hardware, toys, wool, dry goods, clothing and food. The small glass-fronted mail and delivery boxes filled the existing six-foot post office. As the Mineola population grew, the post office was relocated to the Meyer Building on Mineola Boulevard, and then twice more to 3rd Street and 2nd Street. It eventually found its permanent home on 1st Street and Main Street. As years passed, Jericho Turnpike became the commercial &quot;main street&quot;. Farmland was sold off and homes and offices were built. Mineola has continued to be a community of growth and development.

Mineola&#x27;s first theater named Allen&#x27;s Hall drew in many early moviegoers to see &quot;the flickers&quot;. Motion picture success drew in other theaters to the area, the most lavish being the Century Opera House. Most theaters had a showing in the morning and in the evening, usually featuring a live pianist who kept up with the action of the movie while playing music that suited the story.

The centennial celebration for Mineola was held in 2006. Developments for this celebration originated in 2004 from a Centennial Committee formed by then-mayor Jack M. Martins. Co-chairing this were John DaVanzo, former mayor Robert W. Hinck, Sr., and Candida Maia. Various events commenced in January 2006, including the Nassau Pops Symphony Orchestra performing at Chaminade High School, the installation of LIRR Caboose #50 in Memorial Park, the unveiling of a historical quilt by the Nimble Fingers quilting group, and a Centennial Journal delivered to residents and businesses. In March, a fashion show entitled “Decade by Decade” was hosted by Fox’s department store at the Corpus Christi Knights of Columbus Hall, and a marching parade consisting of 80 units took place later in October. The final event was an ecumenical service at Mineola Middle School in December, followed by fireworks in Memorial Park.

Mineola is home to large Portuguese communities, and has been for years. Portuguese restaurant, businesses and its accompanying language are a common feature throughout the neighborhood. According to census data, the village contains approximately 1,900 Portuguese residents, out of the 5,100 total across Long Island.

=== Prevalence in aviation ===
Mineola was also a familiar place to many of the most famous pilots in history. The Aero Club of America chose the area for the level plains. Glenn Curtiss brought the area to national attention in July 1909 with his second Scientific American Award flight of over 23 minutes and 15 miles. He also made some of the first public flights in America in his &quot;Golden Flyer&quot;, while practicing for the Reims Aviation Meet in France. The Wright Brothers, Igor Sikorsky, Captain Rene Fonck, and the famed duo of Clarence Chamberlain and Bert Acosta, dubbed &quot;twins of derring-do&quot;, all spent time in Mineola taking advantage of the rolling grasslands and favorable winds.

On November 1, 1915, Captain Raynal Cawthorne Bolling, a New York attorney working at United States Steel, organized the Aviation Detachment, 1st Battalion Signal Corps of the New York National Guard (now the 102d Rescue Squadron). It was the Guard&#x27;s first genuine aviation unit. Subsequently, the organization was redesignated the 1st Aero Company. Located at Mineola on Long Island, the unit rented and then purchased its own aircraft with funds donated by the Aero Club of America and other contributors. It was &quot;provisionally recognized&quot; on June 22, 1916, and then called into federal service on July 13, 1916, during the Mexican border crisis. However, instead of active service in the southwest, it remained at Mineola training and was released from federal service on November 2, 1916.

After World War I, the British Royal Navy rigid airship R34 made the first-ever east–west aerial crossing of the North Atlantic, traveling from the airship base at RAF East Fortune in the UK to Mineola from July 2 to 6, 1919.

On May 20, 1927, at 7:52 a.m., Charles Lindbergh started his historic flight on the &quot;Spirit&quot; from nearby Roosevelt Field. Thirty-three hours later he landed in Paris and became the first person to complete a solo flight from the United States across the Atlantic Ocean. This historic feat was given numerous test flights in the weeks leading up to his departure, particularly in San Diego and St. Louis. On May 20, 1977, fifty years after the flight, a thirteen-cent commemorative stamp depicting the &quot;Spirit&quot; over the Atlantic Ocean was issued in commemoration.

<text>The Southern Conference (SoCon) is a collegiate athletic conference affiliated with the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) Division I. Southern Conference football teams compete in the Football Championship Subdivision (formerly known as Division I-AA). Member institutions are located in the states of Alabama, Georgia, North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee, and Virginia. Established in 1921, the Southern Conference ranks as the fifth-oldest major college athletic conference in the United States, and either the third or fourth oldest in continuous operation, depending on definitions. 

The Southern Conference is considered one of the stronger football conferences in the Football Championship Subdivision and is considered a mid-major conference in basketball. The three-time Division I NCAA Football champion Appalachian State Mountaineers were a member of the conference when they stunned the fifth-ranked Michigan Wolverines 34–32 on September 1, 2007. The Davidson Wildcats reached the Elite Eight in the 2008 NCAA Men&#x27;s Division I Basketball Tournament by upsetting power programs Gonzaga, Georgetown, and Wisconsin. More recently, the six-time Division I NCAA football champion Georgia Southern Eagles stunned Southeastern Conference power-house Florida Gators 26–20 in The Swamp on November 23, 2013—the first loss to a lower-division opponent in the Florida program&#x27;s history. In 2015, Furman defeated UCF 16–15 and The Citadel topped South Carolina 23–22 for their second win over the Gamecocks in the past three meetings. On September 4, 2021, East Tennessee State University stunned Vanderbilt 23–3 in their opening game. The SoCon also frequently sees multiple teams selected to participate in the NCAA Division I baseball championship.

The SoCon was the first conference to use the three-point field goal in basketball in a November 29, 1980, game at Western Carolina against Middle Tennessee State University (MTSU), where Ronnie Carr shot the historic shot from away and the Catamounts won 77–70.

==History==


Talks of a new conference for Southern athletics had started as early as fall of 1920. The conference was formed on February 25, 1921, in Atlanta as fourteen member institutions split from the Southern Intercollegiate Athletic Association. Southern Conference charter members were Alabama, Auburn, Clemson, Georgia, Georgia Tech, Kentucky, Maryland, Mississippi State, North Carolina, North Carolina State, Tennessee, Virginia, Virginia Tech, and Washington &amp; Lee. In 1922, six more universities—Florida, LSU, Mississippi, South Carolina, Tulane, and Vanderbilt joined the conference. The first year of competition for the conference was in 1922, effective January 1. The new rules banned freshman play. Later additions included (1924), Virginia Military Institute (1924), and Duke (1929).

The SoCon is particularly notable for having spawned two other major conferences. In 1932, the 13 schools located south and west of the Appalachians (Alabama, Auburn, Florida, Georgia, Georgia Tech, Kentucky, LSU, Mississippi, Mississippi State, University of the South (Sewanee), Tennessee, Tulane, and Vanderbilt) all departed the SoCon to form the Southeastern Conference (SEC). In 1953, seven additional schools (Clemson, Duke, Maryland, North Carolina, North Carolina State, South Carolina, and Wake Forest) withdrew from the SoCon to form the Atlantic Coast Conference (ACC). The SEC and ACC have gone on to surpass their parent conference in prestige; while the SEC and ACC are considered &quot;power&quot; conferences in Division I FBS (formerly Division I-A), the SoCon dropped to Division I-AA (FCS) in 1982, four years after the top division was split into two levels in 1978.

The SoCon became the first league to hold a post-season basketball tournament to decide a conference champion. Although first played in 1921, it did not become &quot;official&quot; until 1922, and in its first few years included teams which were not conference members. Held at the Municipal Auditorium in Atlanta from February 24 to March 2, 1922, the first meeting was won by North Carolina who defeated non-member Mercer in the Finals 40–25. The SoCon Basketball Tournament continues as the nation&#x27;s oldest conference tournament. The next-oldest tournament overall is the SEC men&#x27;s basketball tournament, founded in 1933, but that event was suspended after its 1952 edition and did not resume until 1979. With the demise of the Division II West Virginia Intercollegiate Athletic Conference in 2013, whose tournament had been continuously held since 1936, the next-oldest conference tournament in continuous existence is now the ACC men&#x27;s basketball tournament, first held in 1954.

==Member schools==

===Current full members===
The all-sports membership changed to 10 schools in 2014 following the departure of Appalachian State, Davidson, Elon, and Georgia Southern, plus the arrival of East Tennessee State (ETSU), Mercer, and VMI. The current football membership stands at nine. UNC Greensboro does not sponsor football, while ETSU relaunched its previously dormant football program in 2015 and rejoined SoCon football in 2016 after one season as an independent.
The 10 members of the Southern Conference are:

===Associate members===
On January 9, 2014, the SoCon and Atlantic Sun Conference, now known as the ASUN Conference, announced a new alliance in lacrosse that took effect with the 2015 spring season (2014–15 school year). Under its terms, sponsorship of men&#x27;s lacrosse shifted from the ASUN to the SoCon, while women&#x27;s lacrosse sponsorship remained with the ASUN. Bellarmine, which had announced it would join the ASUN for men&#x27;s lacrosse for the 2015 spring season, instead joined the SoCon. The alliance remains in effect in men&#x27;s lacrosse, but the leagues amicably ended their full alliance in women&#x27;s lacrosse once the SoCon began sponsoring that sport in the 2018 spring season (2017–18 school year). However, the conferences maintained their working relationship in women&#x27;s lacrosse, with the SoCon adding Coastal Carolina as an associate member effective with the 2021 spring season (2020–21 school year) in order to keep both conferences at five women&#x27;s lacrosse members for 2021. Coastal was intended to play in SoCon women&#x27;s lacrosse in the 2022 spring season (2021–22 school year) as well, but the SoCon decided to drop the sport after the 2021 spring season (2020–21 school year). While no formal announcement was made, the SoCon–ASUN women&#x27;s lacrosse partnership definitively ended at that time, as the three full SoCon members who sponsored women&#x27;s lacrosse moved that sport to the Big South Conference. Coastal and Delaware State both returned women&#x27;s lacrosse to the ASUN Conference.

The men&#x27;s lacrosse partnership took a slightly different form from the 2022 spring season (2021–22 school year) forward, as the ASUN reinstated its men&#x27;s lacrosse league. The two full ASUN members with men&#x27;s lacrosse programs separated, with Jacksonville remaining in SoCon men&#x27;s lacrosse while Bellarmine joined the ASUN men&#x27;s lacrosse league. SoCon associate Air Force also left for ASUN men&#x27;s lacrosse. The SoCon maintained its automatic NCAA tournament berth with the addition of Hampton.

Before the addition of Hampton men&#x27;s lacrosse, the most recent addition to the associate membership was Presbyterian wrestling, which joined during summer 2019. Two women&#x27;s lacrosse members, Central Michigan and Detroit Mercy, left after the 2020 season (2019–20 school year) to join the new women&#x27;s lacrosse league of Central&#x27;s full-time home of the Mid-American Conference; this move contributed to the eventual demise of the SoCon women&#x27;s lacrosse league.

Men&#x27;s soccer member Belmont left the SoCon after the 2021–22 school year when it joined the Missouri Valley Conference, which sponsors that sport. At the same time, Hampton moved men&#x27;s lacrosse to its new full-time home of the Colonial Athletic Association, now known as the Coastal Athletic Association.

The addition of men&#x27;s lacrosse by the Atlantic 10 Conference, announced on May 23, 2022, led to the demise of the SoCon men&#x27;s lacrosse league after the 2022 season. In addition to Hampton joining the CAA, SoCon associate members High Point and Richmond (the latter a full A-10 member) moved to the A-10, and Jacksonville returned to ASUN men&#x27;s lacrosse.

In the table below, the &quot;Joined&quot; column denotes the start of the school year in which the institution became an associate member, which for spring sports differs from the first season of competition.


;Notes:


===Former full members===
Most former members are currently members of either the Southeastern Conference or the Atlantic Coast Conference. Two of the former full members, Appalachian State and Davidson, maintain SoCon associate membership in wrestling. A third former full member, Georgia Southern, became an associate member in rifle when the SoCon added the sport for the 2016–17 school year.

In the table below, the &quot;Joined&quot; and &quot;Left&quot; columns denotes the calendar year in which each school joined and left the SoCon. For fall sports, the year of departure differs from the final year of competition. For spring sports, the year of arrival differs from the first season of competition.

===SoCon membership timeline===



==Sports==
The Southern Conference sponsors championship competition in 11 men&#x27;s, 9 women&#x27;s, and one co-educational NCAA-sanctioned sports. Five schools are associate members for wrestling. Under a cooperative agreement with the ASUN Conference, the SoCon began sponsoring men&#x27;s lacrosse in the 2014–15 school year (2015 season) with three full members (Furman, Mercer, VMI) and four associates (Bellarmine, High Point, Jacksonville, Richmond). SoCon men&#x27;s lacrosse has since added Air Force. Women&#x27;s lacrosse was sponsored by the ASUN through the 2017 season, after which the SoCon launched its own women&#x27;s lacrosse league. Beginning in the 2016–17 academic year, after a 30-year hiatus, the SoCon resumed rifle as its 21st sport. Members for conference competition are full members The Citadel, VMI, and Wofford as well as associate members UAB, Georgia Southern, and North Georgia. The SoCon is one of only two all-sports conferences to sponsor rifle, joining the Ohio Valley Conference. Rifle is technically a men&#x27;s sport for NCAA purposes, but men&#x27;s, women&#x27;s, and co-ed teams all compete against each other. Women&#x27;s lacrosse was added as the 22nd sport for 2017–18, but was dropped after the 2020–21 school year.

The SoCon dropped men&#x27;s lacrosse after the 2022 season. Affiliate member Hampton joined the Colonial Athletic Association, which sponsors that sport, and the Atlantic 10 Conference, full-time home to men&#x27;s lacrosse affiliate Richmond, launched a men&#x27;s lacrosse league in the 2023 season, also taking in another SoCon affiliate in High Point. With SoCon men&#x27;s lacrosse being gutted by these changes, VMI moved that sport to its former men&#x27;s lacrosse home of the Metro Atlantic Athletic Conference, and the two remaining men&#x27;s lacrosse members, Jacksonville and Mercer, moved that sport to the ASUN.

The Commissioner&#x27;s and Germann Cups are awarded each year to the top men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s program in the conference. The Commissioner&#x27;s Cup was inaugurated in 1970. The Germann Cup, named for former Southern Conference Commissioner Ken Germann, was first awarded in 1987. The completion of the 2013–2014 athletics season saw Appalachian State winning its 33rd Commissioner&#x27;s Cup and Furman its 13th Germann Cup.

<text>Radio Active is a radio comedy programme, broadcast on BBC Radio 4 during the 1980s. The series grew out of a 1979 Edinburgh Festival Fringe show presented by The Oxford Revue and starred Angus Deayton, Geoffrey Perkins, Michael Fenton Stevens, Helen Atkinson-Wood and Philip Pope. The first episode was broadcast in 1980, and it ran for seven series.

==Programme format==

The show is based on a fictional radio station (described as &quot;Britain&#x27;s first national local radio station&quot;) and the programmes that it might transmit. Initially the radio station concept was used simply as a loose framing device for otherwise unlinked sketches and songs, but as the show developed, the episodes became more thematically focused, each one lampooning a different broadcasting genre and sometimes even a specific programme such as &quot;Down Your Way&quot; (parodied as &quot;Round Your Parts&quot;), &quot;In at the Deep End&quot; (&quot;Out of Your Depth&quot;), &quot;Ultra Quiz&quot; (&quot;Gigantaquiz&quot;), &quot;The Radio Programme&quot; (&quot;The Radio Radio Programme&quot;) and &quot;Crimewatch&quot; (&quot;Stop That Crime UK&quot;).

The programmes often pitch the &quot;modern-media&quot; regular characters against older stereotypes of foreigners and &quot;establishment types&quot; such as generals and politicians, though the programme rarely strays into the &quot;alternative comedy&quot; vogue of contemporary political comment. However some episodes in the final series made reference to real-life events: &quot;Probe Round the Back&quot; is a parody of investigative journalism which revolved around the Cambridge Five and contains allusions to &quot;Spycatcher&quot; and the Zircon affair, and &quot;The Flu Special&quot; satirises the then-current HIV/AIDS public awareness campaigns.

===Characters===

Most of the original characters on the show are named after pieces of sound equipment, including:

* rising star Mike Flex (Perkins),
* aged fading star Mike Channel (Deayton),
* &quot;children&#x27;s favourite&quot; &quot;Uncle&quot; Mike Stand (Stevens)
* the food-obsessed Anna Daptor (Atkinson-Wood)

Also on the station&#x27;s staff are:
* the incomprehensible and accident-prone Nigel Pry (Pope)
* the incompetent hospital-radio trained Martin Brown (Stevens)
* the carefully enunciated gag named &quot;oh-so-daring&quot; Mike Hunt (Deayton), whose daredevil stunts invariably turned out not to be as spectacular as he claimed
* brusque station owner Sir Norman Tonsil (Deayton), the name perhaps alluding to Norman Tebbit
* Norwegian correspondent Oivind Vinstra (Perkins), whose command of English was virtually limited to the phrase &quot;and on with the music&quot;
* Head of Religious Affairs The Right Reverend Reverend Wright (Deayton), who had a mail-order bride

Other recurring characters include:
* unsympathetic agony aunt Anna Rabies (known as &quot;Joanna Jaundice&quot; in series one, and &quot;Claire Rabies&quot; in series three) (Atkinson-Wood), the names perhaps alluding to Anna Raeburn and Claire Rayner
* singing doctor Philip Percygo (Pope)
* Luscivia, who ran the Radio Active gift shop (Atkinson-Wood)

The second series sees the characters become more defined, with Mike Channel revealed as the station&#x27;s longest-serving presenter and resentful of the more popular younger hosts, especially Mike Flex, whom Channel frequently complained had taken &quot;his&quot; mid-morning show. At the same time, Nigel Pry gains the idiosyncratic speech patterns and propensity to injury that became his defining traits, and Mike Stand is effectively reinvented as a completely new character, changing from an old-school rock DJ in the first series, to a giggling, infantile children&#x27;s presenter. Although he would come to be regarded as a main character, Martin Brown is not introduced until series 4, and was originally intended as a one-off character (he is so incompetent that during his first show, the station&#x27;s other presenters are revealed to be listening in another studio and laying bets on how long it will take for Sir Norman to fire him – which duly happens at the end of the episode) but was so well-received that a brief appearance by the character was added to the final episode of the series, before he was brought back as a regular in the fifth series.

===Writers===

Angus Deayton and Geoffrey Perkins wrote most of the material. The first series was credited as written by Deayton, Perkins and Richard Curtis, as it drew on sketches written by Deayton and Curtis for the original stage show. Other significant additional contributions came from, at various times, Jon Canter, Terence Dackombe, Michael Fenton Stevens, Jack (then John) Docherty, Moray Hunter, and in the later series Jeremy Pascall (with whom Deayton and Perkins were concurrently writing &quot;The Uncyclopedia of Rock&quot; for Capital Radio). The musical elements were provided by Philip Pope. Four producers worked on the series over the years (Jimmy Mulville, Jamie Rix, Paul Mayhew-Archer and David Tyler).

===Theme tune===
The series theme tune is &quot;Out To Lunch&quot; by The Client, a 1979 RCA single (PB5214), originally used for a NatWest advert. The Client consisted of Ronnie Bond and Tom Parker.

===Recurring elements===

The show had its origins in the University of Oxford student drama community, especially in the musical parodies of Philip Pope, which were regularly featured on &quot;Radio Active&quot;. The best known of these is the Bee Gees parody &quot;The Hee Bee Gee Bees&quot;, with their song &quot;Meaningless Songs (In Very High Voices)&quot;, which became a moderate 1980 hit.

Pope was also responsible for the very long and very contemporary jingles presenting the station telephone number for phone ins (with a false ending) and introducing the commercials. Each week&#x27;s show has its own one-off jingles, which initially resembled the sort of generic jingles used by real radio stations, but later became elaborate musical pastiches in their own right.

The &quot;commercials&quot; feature many parodies of current TV adverts and other running jokes, including conversations between housewives Mary (Fenton Stevens putting on a high-pitched voice) and June (Atkinson-Wood); goods and services of dubious legality offered by &quot;Honest Ron – the others are a con&quot; (Stevens); and &quot;blindingly obvious&quot; patronising public service announcements (&quot;Do not throw boiling water over a child&quot;).

Mike Flex presides over the rigged &quot;Master Quiz&quot; with ever-changing rules and format, although the prize remains the same: a chateau in the Loire Valley, which curiously goes un-won from week to week. The Radio Active Drama Repertory Company usually give a performance with wild misreadings of the scripts (&quot;She&#x27;s seriously one hundred and eleven. (Pause). She&#x27;s seriously ill.&quot;) and miscued sound effects.

Each programme starts and ends with a comical handover to the Radio 4 continuity announcer.

==Transmission==
The original broadcasts took place on BBC Radio 4 between 1980 and 1988 (as detailed in the table below). One special from the same team (&quot;The Hee Bee Gee Bees Story&quot;) premiered on BBC Radio 2; uniquely this edition was presented as a straightforward mockumentary, narrated by disc jockey Paul Burnett.

Episodes from the series were repeated on Radio 4 in late 2002, and again on classic comedy radio station BBC 7 in 2003, late 2004, early 2005 and mid-2006 and again in 2007.

A new one-off episode of &quot;Radio Active&quot;, the first for 15 years, was broadcast on BBC Radio 4 in December 2002.

The third episode of series 7 (&quot;The God Alone Knows Show&quot;) caused many complaints on its first transmission and so was edited for the mid-week repeat and all later broadcasts. In particular, in the broadcast church service near the start of the episode, the inability of any of the congregation to recite the Lord&#x27;s Prayer correctly was replaced with a request for two girls in the front row to turn off their Sony Walkmans. The new translation of the Bible (by &quot;Honest Ron&quot;) was also heavily edited; the new Ten Commandments were changed to remove two which were originally of a sexual nature (replaced by &quot;thou shalt not listen to the Beastie Boys&quot; and &quot;thou shalt not support Arsenal&quot;). A description of the cover (which Ron attempts to pass off as a depiction of Mary Magdalene, but is actually a reproduction or re-creation of the famous Tennis Girl poster) was deleted completely. To make up the lost time, the preceding article was lengthened with a few extra lines.

==Television adaptation==
The show transferred to TV as &quot;KYTV&quot;, which produced 19 episodes (a pilot, three series and one Children in Need special) between 1989 and 1993. The TV show was written, produced and performed by largely the same team as had worked on &quot;Radio Active&quot;.

Some of the &quot;Radio Active&quot; scripts and/or plot devices originally heard on the radio series were reused for the TV show, though the central setting changed from a local radio station to a satellite television broadcaster, and a number of new features and scenarios which parodied television convention were added. Spoof commercials continued to broadcast, along with parodies of the self-promotions and branding which were a common feature of television stations at this point.

Several key characters from &quot;Radio Active&quot; transferred to &quot;KYTV&quot; largely unchanged from their radio incarnations, including Mike Channel, Mike Flex, Anna Daptor and Martin Brown, who formed the central presentation team for KYTV&#x27;s programmes; other characters including Anna Rabies and the Right Reverend Reverend Wright also transferred across. Phillip Pope&#x27;s main character in &quot;KYTV&quot; was as the station&#x27;s unnamed continuity announcer, although as with the radio series he (and the other regulars) appeared in multiple roles. The station&#x27;s owner was again played by Deayton, though the character name was changed from Sir Norman Tonsil to Sir Kenneth Yellowhammer for the TV series, to serve as one of the show&#x27;s thinly-veiled references to Sky TV.

==Stage revival==

In 2014, Angus Deayton appeared on the Radio 4 series &quot;The Frequency of Laughter&quot; to discuss &quot;Radio Active&quot;. When asked whether the show would ever be revived, he responded that it would be &quot;awkward&quot; without Geoffrey Perkins (who died in 2008) but &quot;never say never&quot;. After seeing Neil Pearson&#x27;s production of &quot;The Missing Hancocks&quot; at the Edinburgh Festival Fringe in 2015, Deayton felt that &quot;Radio Active&quot; could be revived in the same manner, with the stage show presented as a mock radio recording. The surviving original cast members subsequently appeared at the Fringe in August 2016 in a show using two radio scripts, &quot;David Chizzlenut&quot; and &quot;Did You Catch It?&quot;. The &quot;David Chizzlenut&quot; section, recorded at the Fringe, was also broadcast as a one-off special on Radio 4.

The Radio Active team performed the same two episodes on a UK tour in 2019, with extra material added.

==Episode list==


==Commercial Releases==
An LP of sketches from the second and third series was released by BBC Records in 1983, with a cassette featuring the episodes &quot;David Chizzlenut&quot; and &quot;Mega Phone-In&quot; following in 1993 as part of the BBC Canned Laughter range. A CD of the first series was released in 2010 on the BBC Classic Radio Comedy label, with some minor music edits to &quot;The Midday Show with Anna Daptor&quot;. A tie-in book, &quot;Radio Active Times&quot;, was published in 1986 by Sphere Books. Later that same year, some &quot;Radio Active&quot; content was featured in &quot;The Utterly Utterly Merry Comic Relief Christmas Book&quot;. Some of the show&#x27;s musical parodies were released as singles and albums under the Hee Bee Gee Bees name.

<doc id="79591" wikidata="Q32542" url="?curid=79591" title="The Magnetic Fields">
<text>The Magnetic Fields are an American band founded and led by Stephin Merritt. Merritt is the group&#x27;s primary songwriter, producer, and vocalist, as well as frequent multi-instrumentalist. The band is named after the André Breton/Philippe Soupault novel &quot;Les Champs Magnétiques&quot;.

The band released their debut single &quot;100,000 Fireflies&quot; in 1991. The single was typical of the band&#x27;s earlier career, characterized by synthesized instrumentation by Merritt, with lead vocals provided by Susan Anway (and then by Stephin Merritt himself, from the &quot;House of Tomorrow&quot; EP onwards). A more traditional band later materialized; it is now composed of Merritt, Claudia Gonson, Sam Davol, and John Woo, with occasional guest vocals by Shirley Simms. The band&#x27;s best-known work is the 1999 three-volume concept album &quot;69 Love Songs&quot;. It was followed in the succeeding years by a &quot;no-synth&quot; trilogy: &quot;i&quot; (2004), &quot;Distortion&quot; (2008), and &quot;Realism&quot; (2010). The band&#x27;s latest album, &quot;Quickies&quot;, was released on May 29, 2020.

==History==
The band began as Merritt&#x27;s studio project under the name Buffalo Rome. With the help of friend Claudia Gonson, who had played in Merritt&#x27;s band the Zinnias during high school, a live band was assembled in Boston, where Merritt and Gonson lived, to play Merritt&#x27;s compositions. The band&#x27;s first live performance was in 1991 at T.T. the Bear&#x27;s Place in Cambridge, Massachusetts, where they were mistakenly billed as Magnetophone, an alias used briefly in that year by Damon Krukowski and Naomi Yang of Galaxie 500.

The 1999 triple album &quot;69 Love Songs&quot; showcased Merritt&#x27;s songwriting and lyrical abilities and the group&#x27;s musicianship, demonstrated by the use of such varied instruments as the ukulele, banjo, accordion, cello, mandolin, flute, xylophone, and the Marxophone, in addition to their usual setting of synthesizers, guitars, and effects. The album features vocalists Shirley Simms, Dudley Klute, L.D. Beghtol, and Gonson, each of whom sings lead on six songs as well as various backing vocals, plus Daniel Handler (who has written under the pseudonym Lemony Snicket) on accordion, and longtime collaborator Christopher Ewen (of Future Bible Heroes) as guest arranger/synthesist. Violinist Ida Pearle makes a brief cameo on &quot;Luckiest Guy on the Lower East Side&quot;.

The band&#x27;s albums &quot;i&quot; (2004) and &quot;Distortion&quot; (2008) both followed the album theme structure of &quot;69 Love Songs&quot;: the song titles on &quot;i&quot; begin with the letter (or, in the case of half the songs&#x27; titles, the pronoun) &quot;I&quot;, whilst &quot;Distortion&quot; was an experiment in combining noise music with their typically unconventional musical approach. The liner notes claim the album was made without synthesizers. According to an article, &quot;To celebrate the release of &quot;Distortion&quot;, Merritt and the Magnetic Fields played mini-residencies in cities around the country, culminating with six shows at Chicago&#x27;s Old Town School of Folk Music.&quot;

&quot;Realism&quot; was released in January 2010, concluding what Merritt termed the &quot;no-synth&quot; trilogy (following &quot;i&quot; and &quot;Distortion&quot;). The next album produced would feature synthesizers &quot;almost exclusively&quot;.

In 2010, the documentary film &quot;Strange Powers: Stephin Merritt and the Magnetic Fields&quot; made its debut in film festivals around the world. It was directed by Kerthy Fix and Gail O&#x27;Hara. Shot over a period of 10 years, it discusses the formation of the band, Stephin&#x27;s friendship with Claudia Gonson, the production of various albums, and Stephin&#x27;s move to California from New York. It won the Outfest 2010 Grand Jury Prize for Feature Documentary.

The band was chosen by Jeff Mangum of Neutral Milk Hotel to perform a rare festival performance at the All Tomorrow&#x27;s Parties event that he curated in March 2012 in Minehead, England.

The band released its tenth full-length album, &quot;Love at the Bottom of the Sea&quot;, on March 6, 2012. This album, compared by Dan Raby to &quot;69 Love Songs&quot;, brought back the use of synthesizers. Merritt told fans on his website, &quot;I was very happy to be using synthesizers in ways that I had not done before. Most of the synthesizers on the record didn&#x27;t exist when we were last using synthesizers.&quot; The song &quot;Andrew in Drag&quot; garnered much attention, receiving play from entities such as CBS News and NPR&#x27;s &quot;All Songs Considered&quot;. In 2012, the Magnetic Fields celebrated its new album by launching a North American and European tour. It began on March 6, the release date of &quot;Love at the Bottom of the Sea&quot;, and continued for two months.

In 2016, it was announced that the band&#x27;s eleventh studio album, &quot;50 Song Memoir&quot;, would contain fifty songs, akin to the &quot;69 Love Songs&quot; concept, one to commemorate each year since Stephin Merritt was born. It was released in March 2017.

On May 15, 2020, the band digitally released the album &quot;Quickies&quot;—twenty-eight songs under three minutes long—through Nonesuch Records. The first single, &quot;The Day the Politicians Died&quot;, was released on February 25, followed by &quot;Kraftwerk in a Blackout&quot; on April 1, &quot;I Want to Join a Biker Gang&quot; on April 16, and &quot;I&#x27;ve Got a Date With Jesus&quot; on May 8. The band released a vinyl box set of the album on May 29, followed by the CD on June 16. Former lead singer Susan Anway died in September 2021.

<text>Stephin Merritt (born February 9, 1965) is an American singer-songwriter and multi-instrumentalist, best known as the songwriter and principal singer of the bands the Magnetic Fields, the Gothic Archies, and Future Bible Heroes. He is known for his distinctive bass voice.

==Musical projects==
Merritt created and plays principal roles in the bands the Magnetic Fields, the 6ths, the Gothic Archies and Future Bible Heroes. He briefly used the name &quot;The Baudelaire Memorial Orchestra&quot; as an attribution for &quot;Scream and Run Away&quot;, a song written for Lemony Snicket&#x27;s &quot;A Series of Unfortunate Events&quot;, but further music was attributed to the Gothic Archies.

Between 1999 and 2005, he was one-third of the infrequent, live-only ensemble the Three Terrors, with &quot;69 Love Songs&quot;″s Dudley Klute and LD Beghtol. These performances were themed around French pop music, movie themes (including the title song from &quot;Deep Throat&quot;), intoxication, and New York City. Kenny Mellman (of Kiki &amp; Herb), Jon DeRosa and others performed with the Three Terrors at these sporadic gala events.

Under his own name, he recorded and released the soundtracks to the films &quot;Eban and Charley&quot; (2000) and &quot;Pieces of April&quot; (2003). The soundtrack to the Nickelodeon show &quot;The Adventures of Pete &amp; Pete&quot; featured many of his songs.

He and director Chen Shi-Zheng collaborated on three pieces of musical theatre: &quot;The Orphan of Zhao&quot; (2003), &quot;Peach Blossom Fan&quot; (2004) and &quot;My Life as a Fairy Tale&quot; (2005). Selected tracks from these works have been released on Nonesuch Records under the title &quot;Showtunes&quot;.

Merritt wrote and sang &quot;I&#x27;m in a Lonely Way&quot; in a television commercial for Volvo that aired in the summer and fall of 2007. He also performed &quot;The Wheels on the Car&quot;. He also penned the music and lyrics for a 2009 Off-Broadway stage musical adaptation of &quot;Coraline&quot;, a novel by Neil Gaiman. In the MCC Theater production, his music was performed by a piano &quot;orchestra&quot; consisting of a traditional piano, a toy piano and a prepared piano.

He produced a score for the silent film &quot;20,000 Leagues Under the Sea&quot; that was performed at the Castro Theatre, San Francisco on May 4, 2010, as part of the San Francisco International Film Festival.

In 2014, he released his first book, &quot;101 Two-Letter Words&quot;. It is a collection of brief poems, one inspired by each of the two-letter words legal in Scrabble.

==Musical style==
Merritt has been acclaimed for his lyrics, which have been described as &quot;romantic&quot;, &quot;humorous&quot;, and &quot;literary&quot;, and he has been called an &quot;insightful lyricist&quot; and a &quot;brilliant wordsmith&quot;. At other times, writers have emphasized the unhappiness of his lyrics. In September 2005, an interviewer quoted an anonymous reviewer to Bob Mould that Mould was &quot;the most depressed man in rock.&quot; Mould&#x27;s response was &quot;He&#x27;s never met Stephin Merritt, obviously.&quot;

Unlike most singer-songwriters, Merritt rarely writes autobiographical songs and does not consider songwriting to be emotionally expressive but an exercise in craft, carried out for its own pleasure. His albums generally have a lyrical theme; for instance, &quot;The Charm of the Highway Strip&quot; is imitation country music. He has stated that he finds writing lyrics with constraints easier. Merritt&#x27;s preferred method of writing songs involves spending several hours sitting in gay bars &quot;one-third full of cranky old gay men gossiping over thumping disco music&quot; with a glass of cognac, which provides him with inspiration for lyrics.

Critics have also praised his tunes and production, calling him a &quot;master melody-writer&quot; and &quot;an arduous studio rat&quot;. Some albums also have musical themes: for instance, the Magnetic Fields album &quot;Distortion&quot; is feedback-rich mix of noise and pop, and it, &quot;i&quot;, and &quot;Realism&quot; make a &quot;trilogy&quot; of records without synthesizers. In contrast, their next album, &quot;Love at the Bottom of the Sea&quot;, used synthesizers extensively. Throughout Merritt&#x27;s career, he has changed styles frequently, and uses a wide variety of instruments on his records.

He has described ABBA, Stephen Sondheim, and Phil Spector as influences. Merritt has said he is an avid listener of bubblegum pop, listing Ramones, Kraftwerk, Abba, The Troggs as examples of the style. He has expressed a disdain for hip hop and much of contemporary pop, describing the former as responsible for &quot;more vicious caricatures of African-Americans than they had in the 19th century.&quot;

==Personal life==

Growing up, Merritt used different spellings of his name for different purposes. He used &quot;Stephin&quot; to sort his junk mail, and that eventually became the name he used as a musician. He attended Massachusetts high school The Cambridge School of Weston and briefly attended NYU before moving back to Boston. He has worked as an editor for &quot;Spin Magazine&quot; and &quot;Time Out New York&quot;.

Prior to 2013, he had never met his biological father, folk singer Scott Fagan, who had a brief affair with Merritt&#x27;s mother. The three met at a screening of the film &quot;AKA Doc Pomus&quot; in 2013. Merritt&#x27;s relationship with his father is described in the song &quot;&#x27;99: Fathers in the Clouds&quot;, on the Magnetic Fields album &quot;50 Song Memoir&quot;.

Merritt has struggled with epilepsy and depression since his youth, and has a hearing condition known as hyperacusis, which he believes is damage sustained from attending an Einstürzende Neubauten concert at Danceteria. Any sound heard louder than normal begins to &quot;feedback&quot; in his left ear at increasingly louder volumes. This has largely influenced the reserved live setup of the Magnetic Fields, which usually consists of acoustic instruments and little to no percussion. Merritt also wears earplugs during performances, and typically covers his left ear when the audience applauds. When touring the &quot;50 Song Memoir&quot; album live, which required a more expanded line-up and amplified sound, the band were able to address this issue by building an elaborate set around Merritt which doubles as an isolation booth.

He was the subject of a documentary, &quot;Strange Powers: Stephin Merritt and the Magnetic Fields&quot;, which premiered in March 2010.

Merritt is gay and a vegan, saying, &quot;I ain&#x27;t eaten an animal since 1983.&quot; He has said that he may be on the autism spectrum.

<doc id="79595" wikidata="Q1325744" url="?curid=79595" title="Metro Atlantic Athletic Conference">
<text>The Metro Atlantic Athletic Conference (MAAC, ) is a collegiate athletic conference affiliated with NCAA Division I. Its current 13 full members are located in five Northeastern states: Connecticut, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Jersey, and New York. 

Members are all relatively small private institutions, a majority Catholic or formerly Catholic, with the only exceptions being two secular institutions: Rider University and Quinnipiac University.

The MAAC currently sponsors 25 sports and has 17 associate member institutions.

==History==
The conference was founded in 1980 by six charter members: the U.S. Military Academy, Fairfield University, Fordham University, Iona College, Manhattan University, and Saint Peter&#x27;s College. Competition officially began the next year, in the sports of men&#x27;s cross-country and men&#x27;s soccer.

Competition in men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s basketball began in the 1981–1982 season. In 1982, Saint Peter&#x27;s was the first women&#x27;s team to represent the MAAC in the NCAA women&#x27;s basketball tournament. In 1984, the MAAC received an automatic bid to the NCAA men&#x27;s basketball tournament, where Iona was the first team to represent the MAAC on the men&#x27;s side.

The conference currently possesses 15 automatic bids to NCAA championships. In 2012–13, the MAAC became eligible for its 15th NCAA championship automatic bid when women&#x27;s rowing fulfilled the qualifying requirements.

The league added football in 1993, but discontinued it following the 2007 season.

From 1997 to 2003, the MAAC sponsored ice hockey. At that time, the hockey league split from the MAAC and changed its name to the Atlantic Hockey Association (now Atlantic Hockey America after its 2024 merger with College Hockey America). Also, Marist College and Rider University moved the majority of their intercollegiate athletic programs to the MAAC in 1997 with the intent that the MAAC would enhance media exposure and competition for their men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s Division I basketball programs.

In September 2011, the conference announced the launch of MAAC.TV, the league&#x27;s first broadband network.

In March 2012, for the first time in 16 years, the MAAC had two teams advance to the NCAA Division I men&#x27;s basketball tournament, with Loyola earning the league&#x27;s automatic bid and Iona garnering an at-large bid.

In July 2013, Quinnipiac University and Monmouth University joined the MAAC to replace Loyola University Maryland, departing to the Patriot League. Also in 2013, the MAAC announced that it would add field hockey with league play set to begin in the 2013–14 academic year. However, field hockey was dropped after the 2018 season. The MAAC field hockey league was effectively taken over by the Northeast Conference (NEC), which reinstated the sport the following year. The conference decided to no longer host a conference championship for men&#x27;s rowing after the 2016 season, which is governed by the Intercollegiate Rowing Association.

On January 25, 2022, Monmouth announced it was leaving the MAAC after the 2021–22 school year to join the Colonial Athletic Association, now known as the Coastal Athletic Association. The MAAC responded by entering into negotiations with Mount St. Mary&#x27;s University, a full but non-football NEC member. ESPN reported on April 27, 2022 that the addition of Mount St. Mary&#x27;s for 2022–23 and beyond would be finalized in early May. The last of these developments came shortly after the MAAC&#x27;s greatest success in men&#x27;s basketball, when Saint Peter&#x27;s became the first 15-seed ever to reach an NCAA regional final, losing there to eventual national runner-up No. 8 North Carolina. Mount St. Mary&#x27;s would be confirmed as Monmouth&#x27;s replacement on May 2.

Also in 2022, four schools that were already MAAC affiliates added men&#x27;s lacrosse to their MAAC memberships. All were full members of conferences that dropped the sport following the addition of men&#x27;s lacrosse by the Atlantic 10 Conference. LIU, Sacred Heart, and Wagner are members of the Northeast Conference, and VMI is a member of the Southern Conference. LIU is the only one of the four that had not previously housed men&#x27;s lacrosse in the MAAC.

In October 2023, the MAAC announced that Merrimack College and Sacred Heart University would join the conference for the 2024-25 season.

===Athletic and academic success===
Over the conference&#x27;s history, MAAC teams have achieved national acclaim in many sports. In the summer of 2002, the Marist men&#x27;s varsity eight boat advanced to the semifinals of the Temple Challenge Cup at the Henley Royal Regatta. In 2007, the Marist women&#x27;s basketball team advanced to the Sweet 16 of the NCAA Division I women&#x27;s basketball tournament. The Red Foxes have recorded five NCAA wins since their run in 2007. In the fall of 2011, the Iona men&#x27;s cross country team finished tied for ninth place at the NCAA Championship race, extending the Gaels&#x27; streak to 10 straight Top 10 national finishes. During the 2022 NCAA Division I men&#x27;s basketball tournament, the Saint Peter&#x27;s Peacocks became the first 15 seed to reach the Elite Eight. With an overall record of 22–12, Saint Peter&#x27;s had the best NCAA postseason run with the most wins in a single NCAA Tournament by any MAAC program (men or women) in the conference&#x27;s 41-year history. In basketball, MAAC teams have made a total of 80 NIT appearances and 50 NCAA basketball tournament appearances.

Notable MAAC student athletes include Mary Beth Riley, a 1991 graduate of Canisius, who was the first recipient of the NCAA Woman of the Year Award and Erin Whalen, a member of the Iona women&#x27;s rowing team who in the fall of 1998 was awarded one of the nation&#x27;s 32 Rhodes Scholarships for academic achievement and civic leadership.

==Member institutions==

===Current===

====Current full members====
The MAAC currently has thirteen full member institutions; all are private schools. Of these, all but Quinnipiac, Rider, and Marist College are Catholic, though Marist is formerly Catholic.

===Associate members===
Of the MAAC&#x27;s ten current affiliate members, only two are Catholic. Drake, Jacksonville, LIU, Robert Morris, and Stetson are nonsectarian and Wagner College is Lutheran. There are also two public institutions, the University at Albany and the Virginia Military Institute.

Departing members are in red.

====Postseason history====

====NCAA tournament at-large bids====

In 2012, Iona, who was inspired by one of their all around best players Sean Armand, which had lost in the semifinals of that year&#x27;s MAAC tournament, received an NCAA at-large tournament bid. This was the second time the conference was awarded multiple men&#x27;s NCAA bids.

After St. Peter&#x27;s won the 1995 MAAC tournament, the NCAA men&#x27;s basketball tournament selection committee awarded Manhattan University an at large bid. The Jaspers proved the committee correct by defeating Oklahoma in the first round.

The same first-round success Manhattan enjoyed in the 1995 NCAA tournament could not be matched by Iona. In the 2012 NCAAs, the Gaels unexpectedly relinquished a 25-point, first-half lead to the BYU Cougars, falling 78–72 in Dayton, Ohio. Further, Iona&#x27;s offense, the highest-scoring (per game) in the nation, managed just 17 points in the second half of that upset.

It was the largest comeback in NCAA tournament history, besting the 22-point hole the Duke Blue Devils rallied from to defeat the Maryland Terrapins in the Final Four of the 2001 NCAA tournament.

<doc id="79596" wikidata="Q165284" url="?curid=79596" title="Louis VIII of France">
<text>Louis VIII (5 September 1187 8 November 1226), nicknamed The Lion (), was King of France from 1223 to 1226. As a prince, he invaded England on 21 May 1216 and was excommunicated by a papal legate on 29 May 1216. On 2 June 1216, Louis was proclaimed &quot;King of England&quot; by rebellious barons in London, though never crowned. He quickly seized half the English kingdom but was eventually defeated by the English. After the Treaty of Lambeth, he was paid 10,000 marks, pledged never to invade England again, and was absolved of his excommunication. 

As prince and fulfilling his father&#x27;s crusading vow, Louis led forces during the Albigensian Crusade in support of Simon de Montfort the Elder, from 1219 to 1223, and as king, from January 1226 to September 1226. Crowned king in 1223, Louis&#x27; ordinance against Jewish usury, a reversal of his father&#x27;s policies, led to the establishment of Lombard moneylenders in Paris. 

Louis&#x27; campaigns in 1224 and 1226 against the Angevin Empire gained him Poitou, Saintonge, and La Rochelle as well as numerous cities in Languedoc, thus leaving the Angevin Kings of England with Gascony as their only remaining continental possession. Louis died in November 1226 from dysentery, while returning from the Albigensian Crusade, and was succeeded by his son, Louis IX.

==Prince Louis==
===Early years===
Born 5 September 1187, Louis was the son of King Philip II of France and Isabella of Hainault. His mother died in 1190, but Louis was not formally invested as Count of Artois. Instead, his father allowed him a nominal control over the county to learn about governance. In summer 1195, a marriage between Louis and Eleanor of Brittany, niece of King Richard I of England, was suggested for an alliance between Philip II and Richard, but it failed.

On 23 May 1200, Louis was married to Blanche of Castile, daughter of King Alfonso VIII of Castile and Eleanor of England. The marriage could only be concluded after prolonged negotiations between King Philip II of France and Blanche&#x27;s uncle John, King of England.

===Campaign of 1214===
In 1213, Louis occupied two towns in Flanders, St. Omer and Aire, which led to animosity between Louis&#x27; father, Philip II, and Count Renaud of Boulogne. By 1214, Philip II of France was facing an alliance consisting of King John of England, Emperor Otto IV, Count Renaud of Boulogne and Count Ferdinand of Flanders. Facing a two-front war, the first attack coming from Flanders led by Otto, Renaud and Ferdinand, supported by the Earl of Salisbury would march south-west, while the other attack from Poitou, under John, would march north-east towards Paris.

Louis was given command of the front against John in Poitou. The first part of the campaign went well for the English, Louis being outmaneuvered by John, and losing the city of Angers by the end of June. When John besieged the castle of Roche-au-Moine, a key stronghold, Louis was forced give battle against John&#x27;s army. When faced against Louis&#x27; forces, the local Poitevin nobles refused to advance with the king; left at something of a disadvantage, John retreated back to La Rochelle. Shortly afterwards, Philip won the hard-fought Battle of Bouvines in the north against Otto and John&#x27;s other allies, bringing an end to John&#x27;s hopes of retaking Normandy.

===Albigensian crusade===
In April 1215, Louis, fulfilling his father&#x27;s vow to crusade against the Albigensians, was cautioned by a papal legate not to impede the crusade. At Narbonne, Louis ordered the destruction of the town&#x27;s fortifications in response to the disagreement between Simon de Montfort and Arnaud Amalric and forced the viscount of Narbonne and other authorities to swear loyalty to Simon. While at Toulouse, he ordered the city officials to tear down their walls, fill in their moat, and to accept Simon de Montfort as the head of their government. Louis&#x27; involvement in the crusade favored Simon de Montfort at every turn.

===Pretender to the English throne===

In 1215, the English barons rebelled against the unpopular King John in the First Barons&#x27; War. The barons, seeing Louis&#x27; wife as a descendant of Henry II of England, offered the throne to him. While Louis prepared an army to press his claim to the English throne, a new papal legate, Cardinal Guala Bicchieri, who was traveling through France to England, explicitly condemned Louis&#x27; plan.

Louis landed unopposed on the Isle of Thanet in eastern Kent, England, at the head of an army on 21 May 1216. There was little resistance when the prince entered London, and he was proclaimed King Louis I of England at Old St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral with great pomp and celebration in the presence of all of London. Even though he was not crowned, many nobles, as well as King Alexander II of Scotland on behalf of his English possessions, gathered to give homage. At Winchester on 29 May 1216, Cardinal Bicchieri excommunicated Louis and all his followers.

On 14 June 1216, Louis captured Winchester and soon controlled over half of the English kingdom. King John&#x27;s death in October 1216 caused many of the rebellious barons to desert Louis in favour of John&#x27;s nine-year-old son, Henry III. Louis, undeterred by Henry&#x27;s reissuing of the Magna Carta, besieged and invested the castle of Hertford in December 1216. By 20 December 1216, he received a proposal for a truce, from regent William Marshal, 1st Earl of Pembroke, lasting from Christmas until 13 January. Louis accepted these terms and traveled back to London, on the way threatening to burn the abbey at St. Albans for the abbot&#x27;s refusal to recognize him as King of England.

After his army was beaten at the Battle of Lincoln on 20 May 1217 and his naval forces were defeated at the Battle of Sandwich on 24 August 1217, Louis was forced to make peace on English terms. The principal provisions of the Treaty of Lambeth were an amnesty for English rebels, a pledge from Louis not to attack England again, and 10,000 marks to be given to Louis – a considerable sum at the time. In return Louis&#x27; excommunication was lifted.

==King Louis VIII==
Louis succeeded his father on 14 July 1223; his coronation took place on 6 August of the same year in the cathedral at Reims. Amalric of Montfort traded Louis his claim on the county of Toulouse in return for becoming constable of the kingdom. As King, he refused to renew the truce with England on 5 May 1224. Instead Louis attacked the possession of the Angevins, invading Gascony, seizing Poitou (in 1224), La Rochelle (August 1224), and Saintonge. To accomplish this task, he treated with Hugh X of Lusignan, promising him the city of Bordeaux if Gascony were conquered. By the end of summer 1224, Louis had conquered Limousin, Perigord, and Quercy.

Louis&#x27;s campaign in 1226 captured numerous cities in Languedoc. By 1226, Louis&#x27; lack of military support in Gascony had embittered Hugh X of Lusignan.

===Policy on Jews===
On 1 November 1223, Louis issued an ordinance that prohibited his officials from recording debts owed to Jews, thus reversing the policies set by his father Philip II Augustus. This removed any type of assistance for the Jews from the king or barons. Further, Christians would be required to repay only the principal of any loans owed to Jews. This principal would be paid to the king or other lords who had direct authority over the Jews. This caused such a major financial impact on Jewish moneylenders, that in 1225 Louis invited Lombard moneylenders to Paris. 

===Albigensian crusade as King===

In 1223, Louis received a letter from Pope Honorius III, entreating him to move against the Albigensians. In early 1226, following the excommunication of Raymond VII of Toulouse at the Council of Bourges and the promise of a tenth of clerical incomes towards the next crusade, Louis took the cross, stating his intention to crusade against the Albigensians. 

In May 1226, Louis assembled his army at Bourges and moving quickly captured the towns of Béziers, Carcassonne, Beaucaire, and Marseille. However, Avignon resisted, refusing to open its gates to the French troops. Not wanting to storm the city, Louis settled in for a siege. A frontal assault that August was fiercely beaten back. On 9 September 1226, the town surrendered, agreeing to pay 6,000 marks, handing over hostages, and destroying its walls. However, Louis&#x27; army took heavy losses besieging Avignon. Finally arriving at Toulouse in October 1226, it was apparent his army was too tired and too weak to attack. Louis chose to return to Paris with the plan to attack Raymond VII of Toulouse next season.

===Death===
While returning to Paris, Louis became ill with dysentery and died on 8 November 1226 in the Château de Montpensier, Auvergne. His disposition, dated June 1225, instructed that his son Louis would succeed him as King, while younger sons were given apanages. Robert received Artois, John Tristan acquired Maine and Anjou, and Alphonse gained Poitou and Auvergne.

The Saint Denis Basilica, just to the north of Paris, houses the tomb of Louis VIII. His young son, Louis IX (born 1214, reigned 1226–70), succeeded him as king of France.

==Marriage and issue==
On 23 May 1200, Louis married Blanche of Castile. They had:
# Philip (9 September 1209 30 June 1218), betrothed in July 1215 to Agnes of Donzy
# Alphonse (26 January 1213, died shortly after birth), twin of John
# John (26 January 1213, died shortly after birth), twin of Alphonse
# Louis (Poissy, 25 April 1214 25 August 1270, Tunis), King of France as successor to his father.
# Robert (25 September 1216 9 February 1250, killed in battle, Mansoura, Egypt), Count of Artois
# John Tristan (21 July 1219 1232), Count of Anjou and Maine, betrothed in March 1227 to Yolande of Brittany.
# Alphonse (Poissy, 11 November 1220 21 August 1271, Corneto), Count of Poitou and Auvergne, and by marriage, of Toulouse
# Philip Dagobert (20 February 1222 1232)
# Isabelle (16 March 1225 23 February 1270)
# Stephen (31 December 1225 21 March 1227)
# Charles (posthumously 21 March 1227 7 January 1285), Count of Anjou and Maine, by marriage Count of Provence and Forcalquier. King of Sicily from 1266.

==Legacy==
Louis left the French monarchy in control of Gascony and much of Languedoc. His decision to divert the payment of loans from Jewish moneylenders to lords in authority over them, led to a Parisian financial crisis which was averted by the introduction of Lombard moneylenders into Paris. Louis&#x27; crusade, which did not start until 1226, against the Cathars was largely successful taking Béziers, Carcassonne, Beaucaire, and Marseille. The costly victory at Avignon, however, rendered his army incapable of taking Toulouse. After his death, his wife, Blanche of Castile continued the crusade resulting in Raymond VII, Count of Toulouse, signing the Treaty of Paris (1229), which brought the monarchy the county of Toulouse in 1271 following the death of Louis&#x27; son Alphonse.

<text>The Northeast Conference (NEC) is a collegiate athletic conference whose schools are members of the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA). Teams in the NEC compete in Division I for all sports; football competes in the Division I Football Championship Subdivision (FCS). Participating schools are located principally in the Northeastern United States, from which the conference derives its name.

==History==
The conference was named the ECAC Metro Conference when it was established in 1981. The original eleven member schools were Fairleigh Dickinson University, the Brooklyn campus of Long Island University (whose athletic program has now merged with that of LIU&#x27;s Post campus into a single athletic program), Loyola College in Maryland (left in 1989), Marist College (left in 1997), Robert Morris University (left in 2020), St. Francis College (NY) (left in 2023), Saint Francis College (PA), Siena College (left in 1984), Towson State University (left in 1982), the University of Baltimore (left in 1983) and Wagner College.

The conference&#x27;s name was changed to its present form on August 1, 1988. Other names considered were Big North, Great North, North Shore, Northern, Northeastern, Eastern and Eastern Private Intercollegiate.

The Northeast Conference has admitted new members ten times since 1981. The expansions and additions from the original charter members were: in 1985 (Monmouth University, which left in 2013), in 1989 (Mount St. Mary&#x27;s University, which left in 2022), in 1992 (Rider University, which left in 1997), in 1997 (Central Connecticut State University), in 1998 (Quinnipiac University which left in 2013, and the University of Maryland, Baltimore County which left in 2003), in 1999 (Sacred Heart University, which is left in 2024), in 2008 (Bryant University, which also left in 2022), in 2019 (Merrimack College, which also left in 2024), in 2022 (Stonehill College), in 2023 (Le Moyne College), and in 2024 (Chicago State University and Mercyhurst University). The Northeast Conference&#x27;s full membership was its largest at 12 in 2008 with the addition of Bryant University. It then dropped to 10 in 2013 with the departure of Monmouth and Quinnipiac for the Metro Atlantic Athletic Conference (MAAC), returned to 11 with the 2019 addition of Merrimack, and again dropped to 10 in 2020 with the departure of Robert Morris for the Horizon League. The conference dropped to 9 members in 2022 with the departure of Bryant and Mount St. Mary&#x27;s, respectively for the America East Conference and the MAAC, plus the addition of Stonehill. On March 20, 2023, St. Francis Brooklyn announced that all intercollegiate sports would be dropped effective at the end of the 2022-23 season, dropping the NEC down to 8 full members. This was followed on May 10, 2023 by the announcement that Le Moyne College would begin a transition from Division II and join the NEC on July 1.

Additional changes were announced in 2018 and took effect with the 2019–20 school year. First, on September 10, the NEC announced it would add Merrimack. Then, on October 3, Long Island University announced that it would combine its two existing athletic programs—NEC member LIU Brooklyn and the Division II program at LIU Post—into a single Division I program under the LIU name. The new LIU program, nicknamed Sharks, maintains LIU Brooklyn&#x27;s previous memberships in Division I and the NEC. Another recent change took place on July 1, 2020, when charter member Robert Morris left to join the Horizon League. The next changes in membership were on July 1, 2022, with Bryant leaving for the America East Conference, Mount St. Mary&#x27;s leaving for the MAAC, and Stonehill arriving from NCAA Division II.

The Northeast Conference has a total of 9 full members in 24 championship sports: baseball, men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s basketball, women&#x27;s bowling, men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s cross country, women&#x27;s field hockey, football, men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s golf, men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s indoor track &amp; field, women&#x27;s lacrosse, men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s outdoor track &amp; field, men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s soccer, softball, men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s swimming, men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s tennis, and men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s volleyball.

Men&#x27;s lacrosse became the league&#x27;s 23rd sport for the 2011 season. The number of sports dropped to 22 after the 2012–13 school year, when the conference dropped field hockey. The departure of Monmouth and Quinnipiac to become all-sports members of the Metro Atlantic Athletic Conference (MAAC) in July 2013 gave the MAAC four full members that sponsored the sport; the other two were NEC single-sport affiliates Rider and Siena. The MAAC then decided to add field hockey as a sponsored sport for the 2013 season, and all of the NEC&#x27;s remaining field hockey programs eventually joined the MAAC except for Saint Francis (PA), which joined the Atlantic 10 Conference. The NEC reinstated field hockey as a sponsored sport for the 2019 season with seven members—full members Bryant, LIU, Merrimack, Sacred Heart, and Wagner, plus associate members Fairfield and Rider. Saint Francis (PA) rejoined the NEC in field hockey during the 2021-22 season. A more recent addition to the NEC&#x27;s sports roster was men&#x27;s swimming &amp; diving, added for 2020–21 with full members Bryant, LIU, Mount St. Mary&#x27;s, St. Francis Brooklyn, and Wagner plus incoming associate member Howard.

In 2022–23, the NEC added one sport and dropped another. On September 30, 2021, the NEC announced that it would begin sponsoring men&#x27;s volleyball in 2022–23 with six members. Before the end of the 2021–22 school year, the NEC announced that two Division II schools from the Buffalo, New York area, Daemen and D&#x27;Youville, would also become part of the new men&#x27;s volleyball league. In a May 9, 2022 Twitter post, NEC commissioner Noreen Morris indicated that the NEC would shut down its men&#x27;s lacrosse league after the then-ongoing 2022 season. The NEC had already lost two full members that sponsored the sport, and would eventually lose its two affiliate members in that sport when the Atlantic 10 Conference announced it would launch a men&#x27;s lacrosse league in the 2023 season. Three of the remaining four NEC men&#x27;s lacrosse programs became affiliate members of the Metro Atlantic Athletic Conference. The other program, Merrimack, was in talks with several lacrosse-sponsoring conferences for affiliate membership, and eventually joined the America East in time for the 2023 season.

In July 2022, the Northeast Conference announced a partnership with the Mid-Eastern Athletic Conference in which MEAC schools sponsoring baseball and men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s golf would become affiliate members in their respective sports beginning in the 2022-23 season. That September, the NEC announced that MEAC member Delaware State, which had just joined NEC baseball and women&#x27;s golf, would add women&#x27;s lacrosse and women&#x27;s soccer to its NEC membership in 2023–24.

In March 2023, St. Francis College (Brooklyn) announced that it would discontinue its athletic programs at the end of the spring 2023 schedule. Le Moyne was announced as SFC&#x27;s replacement that May.

The NEC added two affiliate members in 2023–24—Binghamton University in men&#x27;s golf plus men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s tennis, and Niagara University in bowling. Niagara added that sport for 2023–24 by effectively absorbing the bowling program of Medaille University, a nearby Division III school that closed at the end of the 2022–23 school year.

In October 2023, the Metro Atlantic Athletic Conference announced that Merrimack and Sacred Heart were going to join the conference for the 2024-25 season. This announcement came on the heels of the announcement that the NEC was going to support men&#x27;s lacrosse as a conference sponsored sport for the 2024–25 academic year, after having to discontinue it two years earlier due to the lack of sponsoring members. The original plan was for full members Le Moyne, LIU, Merrimack, Sacred Heart, and Wagner to be joined by two new associate members, the University of Detroit Mercy and the Virginia Military Institute (VMI). The departure of Merrimack and Sacred Heart left the number of men&#x27;s lacrosse programs in the conference with less than the 6 member minimum required for an automatic bid to the NCAA Division I men&#x27;s lacrosse tournament. The NEC announced in November 2023 that Cleveland State University and former full member Robert Morris were going to join the league as men&#x27;s lacrosse associates. In November 2023, Robert Morris also announced that it was going to return to the NEC in football. Shortly after this, Maryland Eastern Shore announced that it was going to add men&#x27;s volleyball in the 2026 season (2025–26 school year) as an NEC associate member, increasing the number of its NEC teams to four. It became the first historically African-American Division I member to announce the addition of that sport. In April 2024, Sacred Heart announced that it was going to leave NEC men&#x27;s volleyballd, and that it was going to return to the Eastern Intercollegiate Volleyball Association, where it had played that sport before the NEC established its own league. Also in 2024–25, former full member Monmouth returned to the NEC as an associate member in bowling. Soon after the start of the 2024–25 academic year, Manhattan University announced that it was going to add men&#x27;s volleyball and become an NEC affiliate in 2025–26.

In response to the departure of Merrimack and Sacred Heart, the NEC announced first in December 2023 that D-I independent Chicago State University was going to join the NEC. A few months later, in April 2024, Mercyhurst University announced that it was going to transition from Division II and join the NEC, bringing the league to 9 members again, for the 2024-25 season.

Currently, a total of 20 affiliate members compete in football, women&#x27;s golf, men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s lacrosse, men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s soccer, men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s swimming, women&#x27;s bowling, field hockey, and men&#x27;s volleyball.

==Sports==
The Northeast Conference currently sponsors championship competition in 11 men&#x27;s and 13 women&#x27;s NCAA sanctioned sports. Twelve schools are associate members in 14 of those sports.

The most recent change to the NEC sports lineup is the reinstatement of men&#x27;s lacrosse in 2024–25 after it had been eliminated in 2022. At the same time men&#x27;s lacrosse was dropped, the NEC added men&#x27;s volleyball.

==Baseball champions==
The NEC has held a tournament for baseball since 1993.

==NEC rivalries==
Before the 2013 departure of Monmouth and Quinnipiac, the NEC had 6 rivalry matchups in the conference; which is most prevalent during NEC&#x27;s men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s basketball &quot;Rivalry Week.&quot; The concept of playing back-to-back games against a local rival the same week is the only one of its kind among the nation&#x27;s 31 NCAA Division I conferences. The pre-2013 NEC rivalries are as follows (with the current NEC team listed first in the matchups that are now non-conference):

;Non-conference
*Constitution State Rivalry: Central Connecticut vs. Sacred Heart (non-conference starting in 2024–25)
*Garden State Rivalry: Fairleigh Dickinson vs. Monmouth (non-conference since 2013–14)
*Governor&#x27;s Cup: Sacred Heart vs. Quinnipiac (non-conference since 2013–14, MAAC rivalry in 2024–25)
*Keystone Clash: Saint Francis (PA) vs. Robert Morris (non-conference since 2020–21)
*NY–MD Showdown: Wagner vs. Mount St. Mary&#x27;s (non-conference since 2022–23)

;Discontinued
*Battle of Brooklyn: LIU vs. St. Francis Brooklyn (St. Francis Brooklyn dropped athletics after the 2022–23 academic year.)

==Brenda Weare Commissioner&#x27;s Cup==
The NEC Commissioner&#x27;s Cup was instituted during the 1986–87 season with Long Island winning the inaugural award. Cup points are awarded in each NEC sponsored sport. For men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s basketball, men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s soccer, women&#x27;s volleyball, football, women&#x27;s bowling, softball, men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s lacrosse, and baseball, the final regular season standings are used to determine Cup points. Starting with the 2012–13 season, the Conference began awarding three bonus points to the NEC Tournament champion in those sports. In all other sports, points are awarded based on the finish at NEC Championship events.

<text>Priscillian (in Latin: &quot;Priscillianus&quot;; Gallaecia, – Augusta Treverorum, Gallia Belgica, ) was a wealthy nobleman of Roman Hispania who promoted a strict form of Christian asceticism. He became bishop of Ávila in 380. Certain practices of his followers (such as meeting at country villas instead of attending church) were denounced at the Council of Zaragoza in 380. Tensions between Priscillian and bishops opposed to his views continued, as well as political maneuvering by both sides. Around 385, Priscillian was charged with sorcery and executed by authority of the Emperor Maximus. The ascetic movement Priscillianism is named after him, and continued in Hispania and Gaul until the late 6th century. Tractates by Priscillian and close followers, which were thought lost, were discovered in 1885 and published in 1889.

==Sources==
The principal and almost contemporary source for the career of Priscillian is the Gallic chronicler Sulpicius Severus, who characterized him (&quot;Chronica&quot; II.46) as noble and rich, a layman who had devoted his life to study, and was vain of his classical pagan education.

==Life==
Priscillian was born around 340, into the nobility, possibly in northwestern Hispania (Gallaecia), and was well-educated. About 370, he initiated a movement in favour of asceticism. Priscillian advocated studying not only the Bible, but also apocryphal books. His followers, who were won over by his eloquence and his severely ascetic example, included the bishops Instantius and Salvianus.

==Beliefs==

According to Priscillian, apostles, prophets, and &quot;doctors&quot; (in the Latin sense of &quot;teachers&quot;) are the divinely appointed orders of the Church, preeminence being due the doctors, among whom Priscillian reckoned himself. The &quot;spiritual&quot; comprehend and judge all things, being &quot;children of wisdom and light&quot;; and the distinction between flesh and spirit, darkness and light, Moses and Christ, and the &quot;prince of this world&quot; and Christ, are emphasised. In asceticism, Priscillian distinguished three degrees, though he did not deny hope of pardon to those who were unable to attain full perfection. The perfect in body, mind, and spirit were celibate, or, if married, continent. Certain practices of the Priscillianists are known through the condemnatory canons issued by the 380 synod, such as receiving the Eucharist in the church but eating it at home or in the conventicle; women joining with men during the time of prayer; fasting even on Sunday; and meditating at home or in the mountains instead of attending church during Lent.

According to historian Ana Maria Castelo Martins Jorge, &quot;He played the role of a catalyst among Lusitanian Christians and crystallized a variety of ascetic, monastic and intellectual aspirations that were either fairly, or even entirely, incompatible with Christianity as it was lived by the great majority of the bishops of the day.&quot;

==Opposition==
His notable opponents in Hispania were Hyginus, bishop of Corduba, and Hydatius, bishop of Augusta Emerita. They accused Priscillian&#x27;s teachings of being gnostic in nature. Through his intolerance of and severity toward Priscillian, Hydatius promoted rather than prevented the spread of his sect.
Hydatius convened a synod held at Caesaraugusta in 380. Ten bishops were present at this synod from Spain, and two from Aquitaine, Delphinus of Bordeaux, and Phœbadus of Agen. Although neither Priscillian nor any of his followers attended, he wrote in reply his third tract justifying the reading of apocryphal literature, without denying that their contents were partly spurious.

Neither Priscillian nor any of his disciples is mentioned in the decrees. The synod forbade certain practices. It forbade assumption of the title of &quot;doctor&quot;, and forbade clerics from becoming monks on the motivation of a more perfect life; women were not to be given the title of &quot;virgins&quot; until they had reached the age of forty. Michael Kulikowski characterizes the concern at Zaragoza as the relationship between town and country, and the authority of the urban episcopacy over religious practice in outlying rural areas.

In the immediate aftermath of the synod, Priscillian was elected bishop of Abila or Abela, and was consecrated by Instantius and Salvianus. Priscillian was now a suffragan of Ithacius of Ossonoba, the metropolitan bishop of Lusitania, whom he attempted to oust, but who then obtained from the emperor Gratian an edict against &quot;false bishops and Manichees&quot;. This was a threat against the Priscillianists, since the Roman Empire had banned Manichaeism long before it legalized Christianity. Consequently, the three bishops, Instantius, Salvianus and Priscillian, went in person to Rome, to present their case before Pope Damasus I, himself a native of Hispania. Neither the Pope nor Ambrose, bishop of Mediolanum, where the emperor resided, granted them an audience. Salvianus died in Rome, but through the intervention of Macedonius, the imperial &quot;magister officiorum&quot; and an enemy of Ambrose, they succeeded in procuring the withdrawal of Gratian&#x27;s edict, and an order for the arrest of Ithacius. Instantius and Priscillian, returning to Spain, regained their sees and churches.

A sudden change occurred in 383, when the governor of Britain, Magnus Maximus, rebelled against Gratian, who marched against him but was assassinated. Maximus was recognized as emperor of Britain, Gaul and Spain, and made Augusta Treverorum, in Gallia Belgica, his residence.

There Ithacius presented his case against Priscillian, and Maximus ordered a synod convened at Burdigala in 384. After this, the matter was transferred to the secular court at Augusta Treverorum. Ithacius and Hydatius of Mérida both went there for the trial. Sulpicius Severus notes that Martin of Tours protested to the Emperor against the ruling, which said that the accused who went to Treves should be imprisoned. Maximus, a Spaniard by birth, treated the matter not as one of ecclesiastical rivalry but as one of morality and society. He is also said to have wished to enrich his treasury by confiscation of the property of the condemned.

At Augusta Treverorum, Priscillian was tried by a secular court on criminal charges that included sorcery, a capital offence. Priscillian was questioned and forced to make the confession that he studied obscene doctrines, held nocturnal meetings with shameful women, and prayed while naked. Consequently, he was charged with practicing magic (maleficium), for which he was convicted and sentenced to death. Ithacius was his chief accuser. Priscillian was condemned and, with five of his companions, executed by the sword in 385. Priscillian&#x27;s execution is seen as the first example of secular justice intervening in an ecclesiastical matter and the first Christian killed by other Christians for heresy.

==Reactions to the execution==
Pope Siricius, Ambrose of Milan, and Martin of Tours protested against the execution, largely on the jurisdictional grounds that an ecclesiastical case should not be decided by a civil tribunal, and worked to reduce the persecution. Pope Siricius censured not only Ithacius but the emperor himself. On receiving information from Maximus, he excommunicated Ithacius and his associates. On an official visit to Augusta Treverorum, Ambrose refused to give any recognition to Ithacius, &quot;not wishing to have anything to do with bishops who had sent heretics to their death&quot;. 

Before the trial, Martin had obtained from Maximus a promise not to apply a death penalty. After the execution, Martin broke off relations with Felix, bishop of Augusta Treverorum, and all others associated with the enquiries and the trial, and restored communion only when the emperor promised to stop the persecution of the Priscillianists. Maximus was killed in his attempted invasion of Italy in 388. Under the new ruler, Ithacius and Hydatius were deposed and exiled. The remains of Priscillian were brought from Augusta Treverorum to Spain, where he was honoured as a martyr, especially in the west of the country, where Priscillianism did not die out until the second half of the 6th century.

==Continued Priscillianism==
The heresy, notwithstanding the severe measures taken against it, continued to spread in Gaul as well as in Hispania. A letter dated 20 February 405, from Pope Innocent I to Exuperius, bishop of Tolosa, opposed the Priscillianists’ interpretation of the Apocrypha. 

In 412, Lazarus, bishop of Aix-en-Provence, and Herod, bishop of Arelate, were expelled from their sees on a charge of Manichaeism. Proculus, the metropolitan of Massilia, and the metropolitans of Vienna and Gallia Narbonensis Secunda were also followers of the rigorist tradition of Priscillian. Something was done for its repression by a synod held by Turibius of Asturica in 446, and by that of Toletum in 447; as an openly professed creed it had to be declared heretical once more by the second synod of Bracara Augusta in 563, a sign that Priscillianist asceticism was still strong long after his execution. &quot;The official church,&quot; says F. C. Conybeare, &quot;had to respect the ascetic spirit to the extent of enjoining celibacy upon its priests, and of recognizing, or rather immuring, such of the laity as desired to live out the old ascetic ideal.&quot;

It is not always easy to separate the genuine assertions of Priscillian himself from those ascribed to him by his enemies, nor from the later developments taken by groups who were labelled Priscillianist. The long prevalent estimation of Priscillian as a heretic and Manichaean rested upon Augustine, Turibius of Astorga, Pope Leo I, the Great, and Orosius (who quotes a fragment of a letter of Priscillian&#x27;s), although at the Council of Toledo in 400, fifteen years after Priscillian&#x27;s death, when his case was reviewed, the most serious charge that could be brought was the error of language involved in a misrendering of the word &quot;innascibilis&quot; (&quot;unbegettable&quot;). Augustine criticized the Priscillianists, who he said were like the Manicheans in their habit of fasting on Sundays.

Priscillianism continued in the north of Hispania and the south of Gaul. Priscillian was honored as a martyr, especially in Gallaecia (modern Galicia and northern Portugal), where his headless body was reverentially returned from Augusta Treverorum and allegedly became rediscovered and revered in the 9th century as Saint James the Great.

==Writings and rediscovery==
Some writings by Priscillian were accounted orthodox and were not burned. For instance he divided the Pauline epistles (including the &quot;Epistle to the Hebrews&quot;) into a series of texts on their theological points and wrote an introduction to each section. These canons survived in a form edited by Peregrinus. They contain a strong call to a life of personal piety and asceticism, including celibacy and abstinence from meat and wine. The charismatic gifts of all believers are equally affirmed. Study of scripture is urged. Priscillian placed considerable weight on apocryphal books, not as being inspired but as helpful in discerning truth and error. It was long thought that all his writings had perished, but in 1885, Georg Schepss discovered at the University of Würzburg eleven genuine tracts, published in the CSEL in 1886.Though they bear Priscillian&#x27;s name, four describing Priscillian&#x27;s trial appear to have been written by a close follower.

According to Raymond E. Brown (1995), the source of the &quot;Comma Johanneum&quot;, a later insertion into the First Epistle of John, known since the fourth century, appears to be the Latin &quot;Liber Apologeticus&quot; by Priscillian.

The modern assessment of Priscillian is summed up by Henry Chadwick (1976).

<doc id="79599" wikidata="Q734916" url="?curid=79599" title="Alan Smithee">
<text>Alan Smithee (also Allen Smithee) is an official pseudonym used by film directors who wish to disown a project. Coined by the Directors Guild of America in 1968 and used until it was largely discontinued in 2000, it was the sole pseudonym used by DGA members when directors, dissatisfied with the final product, proved to the satisfaction of a guild panel that they had not been able to exercise creative control over a film. The director was also required by guild rules not to discuss the circumstances leading to the move or even to acknowledge being the project&#x27;s director. The Alan Smithee credit has also been adopted for direction credit disputes in television, music videos and other media.

== History ==
Before 1968, DGA rules did not permit directors to be credited under a pseudonym. This was intended to prevent producers from forcing them upon directors, which would inhibit the development of their résumés. The guild also required that the director be credited, in support of the auteur theory, which posits that the director is the primary creative force behind a film.

The Smithee pseudonym was created for use on the film &quot;Death of a Gunfighter&quot;, released in 1969. During its filming, lead actor Richard Widmark was unhappy with director Robert Totten and arranged to have him replaced by Don Siegel. Siegel later estimated that he had spent 9 to 10 days filming, while Totten had spent 25 days. Each had roughly an equal amount of footage in Siegel&#x27;s final edit, but Siegel made clear that Widmark had effectively been in charge the entire time. When the film was finished, Siegel did not want to take the credit for it and Totten refused to take credit in his place. The DGA panel hearing the dispute agreed that the film did not represent either director&#x27;s creative vision.

The original proposal was to credit the fictional &quot;Al Smith&quot;, but the name was deemed too common and was already in use within the film industry. The last name was first changed to &quot;Smithe&quot;, then &quot;Smithee&quot;, which was thought to be distinctive enough to avoid confusion with similar names but without drawing attention to itself. Critics praised the film and its &quot;new&quot; director, with &quot;The New York Times&quot; commenting that the film was &quot;sharply directed by Allen Smithee who has an adroit facility for scanning faces and extracting sharp background detail,&quot; and Roger Ebert commenting, &quot;Director Allen Smithee, a name I&#x27;m not familiar with, allows his story to unfold naturally.&quot;

Following its coinage, the pseudonym &quot;Alan Smithee&quot; was applied retroactively to &quot;Fade In&quot; (also known as &quot;Iron Cowboy&quot;), a film starring Burt Reynolds and directed by Jud Taylor, which was first released before the release of &quot;Death of a Gunfighter&quot;. Taylor also requested the pseudonym for &quot;City in Fear&quot; (1980) with David Janssen. Taylor commented on its use when he received the DGA&#x27;s Robert B. Aldrich Achievement Award in 2003:

The spelling &quot;Alan Smithee&quot; became standard, and the Internet Movie Database lists about two dozen feature films and many more television features and series episodes credited to this name. A persistent urban legend suggests that this particular spelling was chosen because it is an anagram of the phrase &quot;the alias men&quot;, but this is apocryphal.

Over the years the name and its purpose became more widely known. Some directors violated the embargo on discussing their use of the pseudonym. In 1997, the film &quot;An Alan Smithee Film: Burn Hollywood Burn&quot; was released, in which a man named Alan Smithee (played by Eric Idle) wishes to disavow a film he directed, but is unable to do so because the only pseudonym he is permitted to use is his own name. The film was directed by Arthur Hiller, who reported to the DGA that producer Joe Eszterhas had interfered with his creative control. He successfully removed his own name from the film, so Alan Smithee was credited instead. The film was a commercial and critical failure, released in only 19 theaters, grossing only $45,779 in the United States with a budget of about $10 million. Rotten Tomatoes reports an aggregate critical rating of only 8% positive. 

The film was nominated for eight Golden Raspberry Awards at the following year&#x27;s ceremony, and won five, including Worst Picture. The harsh negative publicity that surrounded the film drew unwanted mainstream attention to the pseudonym. Following this, the DGA retired the name; for the film &quot;Supernova&quot; (2000), dissatisfied director Walter Hill was instead credited as &quot;Thomas Lee&quot;, and &quot;Accidental Love&quot; director, David O. Russell, left the product credited to Stephen Greene.

Meanwhile, the name had been used outside of the film industry, and it continues to be used in other media and on film projects not under the purview of the DGA. Although the pseudonym was intended for use by directors, the Internet Movie Database lists several uses as writer credits as well. Variations of the name have also occasionally been used, such as &quot;Alan Smithee and Alana Smithy&quot; (screenwriters for the 2011 film &quot;Hidden 3D&quot;).

The chair was ultimately changed again to display Hideo Kojima&#x27;s name as Solid Snake sits on it however. This is a reference to Kojima&#x27;s negative attitude towards directing the series and how he felt he had to keep directing it in spite of this.

* &quot;Highball&quot; (1997), after a falling-out with the film&#x27;s producer left it released in an unfinished state, Noah Baumbach had his directing credit changed to &quot;Ernie Fusco&quot; and his writing credit changed to &quot;Jesse Carter&quot;.

<text>NCAA Division I Football Championship Subdivision independent schools are four-year institutions in the United States whose football programs are not part of a football conference. This means that FCS independents are not required to schedule each other for competition as conference schools do. As of the 2024 season, Merrimack and Sacred Heart will be competing as independents, as their primary conference, Metro Atlantic Athletic Conference, does not sponsor football. They were previously members of the Northeast Conference which does sponsor the sport. Merrimack and Sacred Heart are confirmed to play as FCS independents in 2024. 

==Current FCS independents==
==Former FCS independents==
The following is a complete list of teams that have been Division I-AA/FCS Independents since the formation of Division I-AA in 1978. The &quot;Current Conference&quot; column indicates affiliations for the 2023 college football season. The years listed in this table are football seasons; since football is a fall sport, this means that the final season of independent status, or membership in a given conference, is the calendar year before a conference change took effect.

Teams in &quot;italics&quot; are current FBS members; this includes second-year transitional schools that are counted as FBS for scheduling purposes but not bowl game eligibility. Because James Madison met FBS scheduling requirements in its first season in the Sun Belt Conference in 2022 (specifically five home games against FBS opposition), it was allowed to skip the first year of the normal two-year process.

<doc id="79603" wikidata="Q660356" url="?curid=79603" title="Giotto (spacecraft)">
<text>Giotto was a European robotic spacecraft mission from the European Space Agency. The spacecraft flew by and studied Halley&#x27;s Comet and in doing so became the first spacecraft to make close up observations of a comet. On 13 March 1986, the spacecraft succeeded in approaching Halley&#x27;s nucleus at a distance of 596 kilometers. It was named after the Early Italian Renaissance painter Giotto di Bondone. He had observed Halley&#x27;s Comet in 1301 and was inspired to depict it as the star of Bethlehem in his painting &quot;Adoration of the Magi&quot; in the Scrovegni Chapel.

==Mission==
===Development===

Members of the ESA’s Solar System Working Group started investigating a mission to Halley’s comet in 1977 before rejecting it in August 1978 in favour of a lunar orbiter. Shortly afterwards this was reversed by the Science Advisory Committee and the ESA started to study a joint mission with NASA. This mission was to be the International Comet Mission consisting of a carrier NASA probe and smaller European probe based on the ISEE-2. The plan was for the American probe to release the European probe towards Halley for a close flyby before going on to explore Comet 10P/Tempel. The NASA probe was cancelled November 1979. 

Proposals then moved to an Ariane 1 launched mission with the first option considered being one suggested by Giuseppe Colombo. Named HAPPEN it involved using parts for a planned Geos-3 satellite to first examine the earth&#x27;s Magnetotail before flying through the tail of Halley’s comet in march 1986. This was rejected 24 January 1980 by the solar system working group for not offering to return enough information on Halley. In February 1980 it was proposed that the Ariane 1 launch two Geos based probes. One to examine the magnetotail and the other to target Halley’s comet. It was at this point the name Giotto name started being used. The proposal was approved by the Science Advisory Committee and then moved onto the Science program committee. The Science program committee initially rejected the mission in favour of the Hipparcos satellite while giving Giotto at chance for a second submission without the Magnetotail mission but with more extensive planning and a budget of 80 million accounting units. In July 1980 the committee approved the second proposal with a budget of 80 million accounting units. The Hipparcos program while delayed also continued.

There were plans to have observation equipment on board a Space Shuttle in low-Earth orbit around the time of &quot;Giotto&quot;″s fly-by, but they in turn fell through with the &quot;Challenger&quot; disaster.

The plan then became a cooperative armada of five space probes including &quot;Giotto&quot;, two from the Soviet Union&#x27;s Vega program and two from Japan: the &quot;Sakigake&quot; and &quot;Suisei&quot; probes. The idea was for Japanese probes and the pre-existing American probe International Cometary Explorer to make long distance measurements, followed by the Soviet Vegas which would locate the nucleus, and the resulting information sent back would allow &quot;Giotto&quot; to precisely target very close to the nucleus. Because &quot;Giotto&quot; would pass so very close to the nucleus ESA was mostly convinced it would not survive the encounter due to the spacecraft colliding at very high speed with the many dust particles from the comet. The coordinated group of probes became known as the Halley Armada.

==Design==

The cylindrical spacecraft was 1.85 m in diameter and had three internal platforms. It was derived from the GEOS research satellite built by British Aerospace in Filton, Bristol, and modified with the addition of a dust shield (Whipple shield) as proposed by Fred Whipple. The shield comprised a thin (1 mm) aluminium sheet separated by a space and a thicker (12 mm) Kevlar sheet. The later &quot;Stardust&quot; spacecraft would use a similar Whipple shield. Giotto also had a 1.51 m diameter antenna that it used to communicate with Earth. A mock-up of the spacecraft resides at the Bristol Aero Collection hangar, at Filton, Bristol, England.

=== Science Instruments ===
Giotto had 10 science instruments.

* MAG: a magnetometer 
* HMC (Halley Multicolour Camera): a 16-cm telescope and camera
* DID (Dust Impactor Detector System): measured the mass of dust particles that hit the instrument
* RPA (Rème Plasma Analyser): studied solar wind and charged particles
* JPA (Johnstone Plasma Analyser): also measured solar wind and charged particles
* PIA (Particulate Impact Analyser): studied the size and chemistry of particles
* OPE (Optical Probe Experiment): examined the emissivity of gas and dust behind the spacecraft
* EPA (Energetic Particle Analyser): analyzed alpha-particles, electrons, and neutrons
* NMS (Neutral Mass Spectrometer): measured the composition of the particles around the comet
* IMS (Ion Mass Spectrometer): measured the amount of ions from the sun and the comet
* GRE (Giotto Radio Experiment): used Giotto&#x27;s radio signals to study Halley&#x27;s comet

==Timeline==

===Launch===
The mission was given the go-ahead by ESA in 1980, and launched
on an Ariane 1 rocket (flight V14) on 2 July 1985 from Kourou, French Guiana. The craft was controlled from the European Space Agency ESOC facilities in Darmstadt (then West Germany) initially in Geostationary Transfer Orbit (GTO) then in the Near Earth Phase (NEP) before the longer Cruise Phase through to the encounter. While in GTO a number of slew and spin-up manoeuvres (to 90 RPM) were carried out in preparation for the firing of the Apogee Boost Motor (ABM), although unlike orbit circularisations for geostationary orbit, the ABM for Giotto was fired at perigee. Attitude determination and control used sun pulse and IR Earth sensor data in the telemetry to determine the spacecraft orientation.

===Halley encounter===

The Soviet Vega 1 started returning images of Halley on 4 March 1986, and the first ever of its nucleus, and made its flyby on 6 March, followed by Vega 2 making its flyby on 9 March. Vega 1&#x27;s closest approach to Halley was
8 889 km.

&quot;Giotto&quot; passed Halley successfully on 14 March 1986 at 596 km distance, and surprisingly survived despite being hit by some small particles. One impact sent it spinning off its stabilized spin axis so that its antenna no longer always pointed at the Earth, and its dust shield no longer protected its instruments. After 32 minutes &quot;Giotto&quot; re-stabilized itself and continued gathering science data.

Another impact destroyed the Halley Multicolor Camera, but not before it took photographs of the nucleus at closest approach.

===First Earth flyby===

&quot;Giotto&quot;″s trajectory was adjusted for an Earth flyby and its science instruments were turned off on 15 March 1986 at 02:00 UTC.

===Grigg–Skjellerup encounter===

&quot;Giotto&quot; was commanded to wake up on 2 July 1990 when it flew by Earth in order to sling shot to its next cometary encounter.

The probe then flew by the Comet Grigg–Skjellerup on 10 July 1992 which it approached to a distance of about 200 km. Afterwards, Giotto was again switched off on 23 July 1992.

===Second Earth flyby===

In 1999 &quot;Giotto&quot; made another Earth flyby but was not reactivated.

==Scientific results==

Images showed Halley&#x27;s nucleus to be a dark peanut-shaped body, 15 km long, 7 km to 10 km wide. Only 10% of the surface was active, with at least three outgassing jets seen on the sunlit side. Analysis showed the comet formed 4.5 billion years ago from volatiles (mainly ice) that had condensed onto interstellar dust particles. It had remained practically unaltered since its formation.

Measured volume of material ejected by Halley:

* 80% water,
* 10% carbon monoxide
* 2.5% a mix of methane and ammonia.
* other hydrocarbons, iron, and sodium were detected in trace amounts.

&quot;Giotto&quot; found Halley&#x27;s nucleus was dark, which suggested a thick covering of dust.

The nucleus&#x27;s surface was rough and of a porous quality, with the density of the whole nucleus as low as 0.3 g/cm3. Sagdeev&#x27;s team estimated a density of
0.6 g/cm3, but S. J. Peale warned that all estimates had error bars too large to be informative.

The quantity of material ejected was found to be three tonnes per second for seven jets, and these caused the comet to wobble over long time periods.

The dust ejected was mostly only the size of cigarette smoke particles, with masses ranging from 10 ag to 0.4 g. (See Orders of magnitude (mass).) The mass of the particle that impacted &quot;Giotto&quot; and sent it spinning was not measured, but from its effects—it also probably broke off a piece of &quot;Giotto&quot;—the mass has been estimated to lie between 0.1 g and 1 g.

Two kinds of dust were seen: one with carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen and oxygen; the other with calcium, iron, magnesium, silicon and sodium.

The ratio of abundances of the comet&#x27;s light elements excluding nitrogen (i.e. hydrogen, carbon, oxygen) were the same as the Sun&#x27;s. The implication is that the constituents of Halley are among the most primitive in the Solar System.

The plasma and ion mass spectrometer instruments showed Halley has a carbon-rich surface.

===Spacecraft achievements===

* &quot;Giotto&quot; made the closest approach to Halley&#x27;s Comet and provided the best data for this comet.
* &quot;Giotto&quot; was the first spacecraft:
:* to provide detailed pictures of a cometary nucleus.
:* to make a close flyby of two comets. Young and active comet Halley could be compared to old comet Grigg–Skjellerup.
:* to return from interplanetary space and perform an Earth swing-by.
:* to be re-activated from hibernation mode.
:* to use Earth for a gravity assist.

<doc id="79607" wikidata="Q8257871" url="?curid=79607" title="Boeotia">
<text>Boeotia ( ), sometimes Latinized as Boiotia or Beotia (; modern: ; ancient: ), is one of the regional units of Greece. It is part of the region of Central Greece. Its capital is Livadeia, and its largest city is Thebes.

Boeotia was also a region of ancient Greece, from before the 6th century BC.

==Geography==
Boeotia lies to the north of the eastern part of the Gulf of Corinth. It also has a short coastline on the Gulf of Euboea. It bordered on Megaris (now West Attica) in the south, Attica in the southeast, Euboea in the northeast, Opuntian Locris (now part of Phthiotis) in the north and Phocis in the west.

The main mountain ranges of Boeotia are Mount Parnassus in the west, Mount Helicon in the southwest, Cithaeron in the south and Parnitha in the east. Its longest river, the Cephissus, flows in the central part, where most of the low-lying areas of Boeotia are found.

Lake Copais was a large lake in the center of Boeotia. It was drained in the 19th century. Lake Yliki is a large lake near Thebes.

==Origins==
The origin of the name &quot;Boeotians&quot; may lie in the mountain Boeon in Epirus.

The earliest inhabitants of Boeotia, associated with the city of Orchomenus, were called Minyans. Pausanias mentions that Minyans established the maritime Ionian city of Teos, and occupied the islands of Lemnos and Thera. The Argonauts were sometimes referred to as Minyans. Also, according to legend the citizens of Thebes paid an annual tribute to their king Erginus. The Minyans may have been proto-Greek speakers. Although most scholars today agree that the Myceneans descended from the Minyans of the &quot;Middle Helladic period&quot;, they believe that the progenitors and founders of Minyan culture were an indigenous people.
The early wealth and power of Boeotia is shown by the reputation and visible Mycenean remains of several of its cities, especially Orchomenus and Thebes.

Some toponyms and the common Aeolic dialect indicate that the Boeotians were related to the Thessalians. Traditionally, the Boeotians are said to have originally occupied Thessaly, the largest fertile plain in Greece, and to have been dispossessed by the north-western Thessalians two generations after the Fall of Troy (1200 BC). They moved south and settled in another rich plain, while others filtered across the Aegean and settled on Lesbos and in Aeolis in Asia Minor. Others are said to have stayed in Thessaly, withdrawing into the hill country and becoming the &quot;perioikoi&quot; (&quot;dwellers around&quot;). Boeotia was an early member of the oldest Amphictyonic League (&quot;Anthelian&quot;), a religious confederacy of related tribes, despite its distance from the League&#x27;s original home in Anthela.

Although they included great men such as Pindar, Hesiod, Epaminondas, Pelopidas, and Plutarch, the Boeotian people were portrayed as proverbially dull by the Athenians (cf. &quot;Boeotian ears&quot; incapable of appreciating music or poetry and &quot;Hog-Boeotians&quot;, Cratinus.310).

==Legends and literature==

Many ancient Greek legends originated or are set in this region. The older myths took their final form during the Mycenean age (1600–1200 BC) when the Mycenean Greeks established themselves in Boeotia and the city of Thebes became an important centre. Many of them are related to the myths of Argos, and others indicate connections with Phoenicia, where the Mycenean Greeks and later the Euboean Greeks established trading posts.

Important legends related to Boeotia include:

*Eros, worshiped by a fertility cult in Thespiae
*The Muses of Mount Helicon
*Ogyges and the Ogygian deluge
*Cadmus, who was said to have founded Thebes and brought the alphabet to Greece
*Dionysus and Semele
*Narcissus
*Heracles, who was born in Thebes
*The Theban Cycle, including the myths of Oedipus and the Sphinx, and the Seven against Thebes
*Antiope and her sons Amphion and Zethus
*Niobe
*Orion, who was born in Boeotia and said to have fathered 50 sons with the daughters of a local river god.

Many of these legends were used in plays by the tragic Greek poets, Aeschylus, Sophocles, and Euripides:

*Aeschylus&#x27;s &quot;Seven Against Thebes&quot;
*Sophocles&#x27;s &quot;Oedipus Rex&quot;, &quot;Oedipus at Colonus&quot;, and &quot;Antigone&quot;, known as the Theban plays
*Euripides&#x27;s &quot;Bacchae&quot;, &quot;Phoenician Women&quot;, &quot;Suppliants&quot;, and &quot;Heracles&quot;

They were also used in lost plays such as Aeschylus&#x27;s &quot;Niobe&quot; and Euripides&#x27;s &quot;Antiope&quot;.

Boeotia was also notable for the ancient oracular shrine of Trophonius at Lebadea. Graea, an ancient city in Boeotia, is sometimes thought to be the origin of the Latin word &quot;Graecus&quot;, from which English derives the words &quot;Greece&quot; and &quot;Greeks&quot;.

The major poets Hesiod and Pindar were Boeotians. Nonetheless, the French use the term (&quot;Boeotian&quot;) to denote Philistinism.

==History==

Boeotia had significant political importance, owing to its position on the north shore of the Gulf of Corinth, the strategic strength of its frontiers, and the ease of communication within its extensive area. On the other hand, the lack of good harbours hindered its maritime development.

The importance of the legendary Minyae has been confirmed by archaeological remains (notably the &quot;Treasury of Minyas&quot;). The Boeotian population entered the land from the north possibly before the Dorian invasion. With the exception of the Minyae, the original peoples were soon absorbed by these immigrants, and the Boeotians henceforth appear as a homogeneous nation. Aeolic Greek was spoken in Boeotia.

In historical times, the leading city of Boeotia was Thebes, whose central position and military strength made it a suitable capital; other major towns were Orchomenus, Plataea, and Thespiae. It was the constant ambition of the Thebans to absorb the other townships into a single state, just as Athens had annexed the Attic communities. But the outlying cities successfully resisted this policy, and only allowed the formation of a loose federation that, initially, was merely religious.
While the Boeotians, unlike the Arcadians, generally acted as a united whole against foreign enemies, the constant struggle between the cities was a serious check on the nation&#x27;s development. Boeotia hardly figures in history before the late 6th century BC.

Previous to this, its people are chiefly known as the makers of a type of geometric pottery, similar to the Dipylon ware of Athens. In about 519 BC, the resistance of Plataea to the federating policy of Thebes led to the interference of Athens on behalf of the former; on this occasion, and again in 507 BC, the Athenians defeated the Boeotian levy.

The Works and Days by Hesiod is often used by economists and historians alike to provide invaluable evidence for the Boetian economic system and its developments in the Homeric Age. In the poem Hesiod, who lived in Boeotia, describes the beginnings of a modern economy, with the use of artisans to &#x27;do the technical work in making his plow and wagon&#x27; and the beginnings of sea commerce and its increasing importance in the economic life of Greece.

===Emigration of the Boeotians===
According to myth, the Boeotians () lived in Thessaly, especially in the area around Arne, though some may have gone to the Pagasitic Gulf before migrating to the land later termed Boeotia. The location of Arne is unknown, though sometimes it is equated with Cierium in Central Thessaly. The presence in Classical times in Boeotia of cults and place-names of Thessalian origin, such as Itonia and Itonian Athena, Homole and Homoloian Zeus, Alalcomenae, Corseia and Pharae, confirm for most scholars the merits of these traditions. It is, therefore, generally believed that the Boeotians originated in Thessaly and lived there as a distinct ethnos, in Phthiotis or in Thessaliotis, before they migrated to Boeotia, taking elements with them from other parts of Thessaly.

Boeotians were expelled from Thessaly after the Trojan war although there are three traditions which disagree on how expulsion played out. One tradition says that the Boiotoi were expelled by the Thessalians who were led by Thessalus, son of Aiatus, son of Pheidippus, son of another Thessalus. Pheidippus appears in the Catalogue of ships as one of the commanders of the force from Cos and Carpathus. He was thought to have been driven to Epirus after the war and to have settled at Ephyra in the Thesprotid. Hence the Boiotoi were expelled two generations after the Trojan War. Hellanicus is probably the source of this tradition, and the source of Thucydides&#x27; &quot;sixtieth year&quot;, that is, two generations of thirty years. A second tradition puts the expulsion of the Boiotoi in the reign of Aiatus, one generation after the War. To this should also belong the story in Plutarch, which tells how Opheltas king of the Boiotoi took Chaeronea &quot;by force from the barbarians.&quot; Opheltas is the son of Peneleus, one of the leaders of the Boeotian contingent in the Catalogue, and living one generation after the war. It is not until the reign of Damasichthon, son of Opheltas, that control of Thebes was gained by the Boiotoi. Hence in this tradition one generation after the war, the Boiotoi were expelled and western Boeotia was invaded; two generations after the war, Thebes was won. A third tradition combines the other two: the two generations until the expulsion from Thessaly after the War and the two generations until Thebes is gained give the four generations cited by Hieronymus in his tale of the Cadmean return to Thebes after the war.

The entry-point to Boeotia by Boeotians seems to be put in the same general area by all traditions. The second tradition gives Chaeronea as the first place attacked, while the first says that Coronea and Orchomenus were captured virtually simultaneously and then the sanctuary of Itonian Athena was founded. It is clear that both traditions envisaged the Boiotoi as following a well-known invasion route from Thessaly, the one via Thermopylae and Hyampolis to Chaeronea, where the invaders would be poised to attack both Orchomenus and Coronea. Having gained control of Chaeronea, Orchomenus and Coronea, and their territories, the Boiotoi seem to have paused to digest western Boeotia; the generation or two before Thebes was captured marks this pause in all traditions. The siting close to Coronea of the sanctuary of Itonian Athena, and the celebration of the Pamboeotia there, together with the renaming of rivers and other toponyms, and the sanctity attached to the neighbouring settlement of Alalcomenae, all strengthen the belief that this western section was the area where the first Boeotian settlement took place, and where Boeotian institutions were first established in the new homeland. The advance eastward eventually proceeded both to the north and to the south of Copais lake. On the north side it ultimately reached Anthedon, a town credited with once having been occupied by the Thracians. On the south side it came as far as Thebes and Thespiae. In Thebes, according to one version, Damasichthon took the rule from Autesion, son of Tisamenus, son of Thersander, another stemma that puts the Boeotians in Thebes two generations after the Trojan War. The tradition intimates that there was a peaceful take-over, with Autesion joining the Dorians. There must have been another pause for some time. The next advance, into the Asopus valley, was led by Xanthus, son of Ptolemy, son of Damasichthon, that is, two generations after the gaining of Thebes. The Thebans remembered, according to Thucydides, that the Asopus valley and Plataea were reduced later than the rest of Boeotia and were occupied in accordance with an agreed plan. The Boeotian advance was apparently stalled on what became the Athenian-Boeotian frontier, by the efforts of local forces, if the legend of Xanthus and Melanthus has any historical significance. In any event the death of Xanthus symbolized traditionally the completion of the conquest of Boeotia under the kings and the consequent immediate extinction of the kingship.

===Fifth century BC===

During the Persian invasion of 480 BC, Thebes assisted the invaders. In consequence, for a time, the presidency of the Boeotian League was taken from Thebes, but in 457 BC the Spartans reinstated that city as a bulwark against Athenian aggression after the Battle of Tanagra. Athens retaliated with a sudden advance upon Boeotia, and after the victory at the Battle of Oenophyta took control of the whole country, taking down the wall the Spartans had built. With the victory the Athenians also occupied Phocis, the original source of the conflict, and Opuntian Locris. For ten years the land remained under Athenian control, which was exercised through the newly installed democracies; but in 447 BC the people revolted, and after a victory at the Battle of Coronea regained their independence.

In the Peloponnesian War the Boeotians fought zealously against Athens. Although slightly estranged from Sparta after the peace of Nicias, they never abated their enmity against their neighbours. They rendered good service at Syracuse and at the Battle of Arginusae in the closing years of the Peloponnesian War; but their greatest achievement was the decisive victory at the Battle of Delium over the Athenian army (424 BC) in which both their heavy infantry and their cavalry displayed unusual efficiency.

===Boeotian League===

According to the Hellenica Oxyrhynchia, in 395 BC the Boeotian League comprised eleven groups of sovereign cities and associated townships, each of which elected one Boeotarch or minister of war and foreign affairs, contributed sixty delegates to the federal council at Thebes, and supplied a contingent of about 1000 infantry and 100 cavalry to the federal army. A safeguard against undue encroachment on the part of the central government was provided in the councils of the individual cities, to which all important questions of policy had to be submitted for ratification. These local councils, to which the propertied classes alone were eligible, were subdivided into four sections, resembling the prytaneis of the Athenian council, which took it in turns to vote on all new measures.

Two Boeotarchs were provided by Thebes, but by 395 BC Thebes was providing four Boeotarchs, including two who had represented places now conquered by Thebes such as Plataea, Scolus, Erythrae, and Scaphae. Orchomenus, Hysiae, and Tanagra each supplied one Boeotarch. Thespiae, Thisbe, and Eutresis supplied two between them. Haliartus, Lebadea and Coronea supplied one in turn, and so did Acraephia, Copae, and Chaeronea.

The total military force of the Boiotian League (11,000 infantry and 1,100 cavalry) has been used as the basis for a number of calculations of the population of the region in the early fourth century BC. John Bintliff assumes an additional 21,000 light troops and rowers in the navy, for a total of 33,100 men. Assuming the same number of women, two children and one slave for every household, he estimates the total Boeotian population at 165,500 (including 33,100 slaves). Mogens Herman Hansen assumes an additional 12,100 light troops, for a total of 24,200 men in the army. He assumes that 25% of men were ineligible for military service, so his total population of men between the ages of twenty and fifty is 30,250. Using model life tables he calculates a total male citizen population of 72,240 and an equal number of women, for a minimum free population of 144,050, plus an unknown number of slaves and foreign residents. He proposes a maximum of 250,000. By comparison, the population of Boeotia was 38,000–50,000 in the late sixteenth century, according to tahrir records, 40,000–42,000 in the 1889 census, and 117,920 in the 2011 census.

===Fourth century BC===
Boeotia took a prominent part in the Corinthian War against Sparta, especially in the battles of Haliartus and Coronea (395–394 BC). This change of policy was mainly due to the popular resentment against foreign interference. Yet disaffection against Thebes was now growing rife, and Sparta fostered this feeling by insisting on the complete independence of all the cities in the Peace of Antaclidas (387 BC). In 374 BC, Pelopidas restored Theban dominance. Boeotian contingents fought in all the campaigns of Epaminondas against the Spartans, most notably at the Battle of Leuctra in 371 BC, and in the Third Sacred War against Phocis (356–346 BC); while in the dealings with Philip of Macedon the cities merely followed Thebes.

The federal constitution was also brought into accord with the democratic governments now prevalent throughout the land. Sovereign power was vested in the popular assembly, which elected the Boeotarchs (between seven and twelve in number), and sanctioned all laws. After the Battle of Chaeroneia, in which the Boeotian heavy infantry once again distinguished itself, the land never again rose to prosperity.

===Hellenistic period===
The destruction of Thebes by Alexander the Great (335 BC) destroyed the political energy of the Boeotians. They never again pursued an independent policy, but followed the lead of protecting powers. Although military training and organization continued, the people proved unable to defend the frontiers, and the land became more than ever the &quot;dancing-ground of Ares&quot;. Although enrolled for a short time in the Aetolian League (about 245 BC) Boeotia was generally loyal to Macedon, and supported its later kings against Rome. Rome dissolved the league in 171 BC, but it was revived under Augustus, and merged with the other central Greek federations in the Achaean synod. The death-blow to the country&#x27;s prosperity was dealt by the devastations during the First Mithridatic War.

===Middle Ages and later===

Save for a short period of prosperity under the Frankish rulers of Athens (1205–1310), who repaired the underground drainage channels ( &quot;katavóthra&quot;) of Lake Kopais and fostered agriculture, Boeotia long continued in a state of decay, aggravated by occasional barbarian incursions. The first step toward the country&#x27;s recovery was not until 1895, when the drainage channels of Kopais were again put into working order.

==Archaeological sites==
In 1880–86, Heinrich Schliemann&#x27;s excavations at Orchomenus (H. Schliemann, &quot;Orchomenos&quot;, Leipzig 1881) revealed the tholos tomb he called the &quot;Tomb of Minyas&quot;, a Mycenaean monument that equalled the beehive tomb known as the Treasury of Atreus at Mycenae. In 1893, A. de Ridder excavated the temple of Asclepios and some burials in the Roman necropolis. In 1903–05, a Bavarian archaeological mission under Heinrich Bulle and Adolf Furtwängler conducted successful excavations at the site. Research continued in 1970–73 by the Archaeological Service under Theodore Spyropoulos, uncovering the Mycenaean palace, a prehistoric cemetery, the ancient amphitheatre, and other structures.

==Administration==
The regional unit Boeotia is subdivided into 6 municipalities. These are (number as in the map in the infobox):
*Aliartos-Thespies (2)
*Distomo-Arachova-Antikyra (3)
*Livadeia (1)
*Orchomenos (5)
*Tanagra (6)
*Thebes (&quot;Thiva&quot;, 4)

===Prefecture===
Boeotia was created as a prefecture in 1836 (), again in 1899 () and again in 1943; in all cases it was split from Attica and Boeotia Prefecture. As a part of the 2011 Kallikratis government reform, the regional unit Boeotia was created out of the former prefecture Boeotia. The prefecture had the same territory as the present regional unit. At the same time, the municipalities were reorganised, according to the table below.
===Provinces===
The provinces were:
*Livadeia Province – Livadeia
*Thebes Province – Thebes

==Economy==

Boeotia is the home of the third largest pasta factory in Europe, built by MISKO, a member of Barilla Group. Also, some of the biggest companies in Greece and Europe have factories in this place. For example, Nestlé and Viohalco have factories in Oinofyta, Boeotia.

<text>The Big South Conference is a collegiate athletic conference affiliated with the NCAA&#x27;s Division I. Originally a non-football conference, the Big South began sponsoring football in 2002 as part of the Football Championship Subdivision (FCS), and began operating the OVC–Big South Football Association in partnership with the Ohio Valley Conference in 2023. The Big South, founded in 1983, is firmly rooted in the South Atlantic region of the United States, with full member institutions located in North Carolina, South Carolina, and Virginia. Associate members are located in Georgia and South Carolina.

==History==
Charter members included Armstrong State (later Armstrong Atlantic State University and now merged into Georgia Southern University as its Armstrong Campus) (1983–1987), Augusta (later Augusta State University and now merged into Augusta University) (1983–1990), Campbell University (1983–1994; 2011–2023), Baptist College (now Charleston Southern University) (1983–present), Coastal Carolina University (1983–2016), Radford University (1983–present) and Winthrop University (1983–present).

The expansion of membership occurred during the 1980s and 1990s. Some of those members are the University of North Carolina at Asheville (1984–present), Davidson College (1990–1992), Liberty University (1991–2018), the University of Maryland, Baltimore County (1992–1998), the University of North Carolina at Greensboro (1992–1997), Towson University (1992–1995), Elon University (1999–2003), High Point University (1999–present) and Birmingham–Southern College (2000–2006).

The Big South Conference began sponsoring football in 2002, with Charleston Southern, Elon (at the time) and Liberty (Gardner–Webb University also joined as a football-only member) fielding teams; Coastal Carolina and Virginia Military Institute (VMI) joined the conference as football-only members in 2003. In that same athletic year, VMI also joined the conference for all sports, but left to re-join the Southern Conference in 2014. Presbyterian College joined the conference in 2007, moving up from Division II, and became eligible for regular-season championships and conference honors during the 2008–09 athletic year. Gardner–Webb, which had been a football-only member since 2002, joined the conference for all sports on July 1, 2008. Campbell rejoined the Big South for all sports except football in the 2011–12 athletic year. Longwood University accepted an invitation to join the Big South on January 23, 2012, and membership formally began July 1 of that year; Longwood had been independent since 2004, during their transition to Division I. In 2014, following the departure of VMI, the conference returned to a single-division structure. On September 1, 2015, Coastal Carolina announced they would leave the conference following the 2015–16 school year to transition to FBS-level football and the Sun Belt Conference. On June 30, 2016, the day before the school joined the Sun Belt, Coastal Carolina won the 2016 College World Series in baseball. This was the first time in conference history that a team won an NCAA championship in any sport.

In September 2016, the Big South and the ASUN Conference (ASUN) announced a football partnership that effectively combined the two conferences in that sport. Under its terms, any members of either conference that add or upgrade to scholarship football, provided they fall within the current geographic footprint of the two leagues, automatically join Big South football. At the time of announcement, the only ASUN member that played scholarship football, Kennesaw State, was already a Big South football member. The partnership also provides a guaranteed football home to the leagues&#x27; non-scholarship football programs (at that time, Campbell from the Big South, and Jacksonville and Stetson from the ASUN) should they upgrade to scholarship status.

In November 2016, Campbell announced that it would begin offering scholarships and move its football program from the Pioneer Football League to the Big South in 2018.

In December 2016, the University of North Alabama, ASUN, and the Big South Conference announced that, effective in 2018, the school will leave the Division II Gulf South Conference and will join ASUN in non-football sports and the Big South in football. UNA has won three Division II NCAA national championships in football and has won at least a share of the Gulf South Conference football championship for four consecutive seasons through 2016.

Three months later, Liberty announced that it would begin a transition to FBS football in July 2017 and leave the Big South football league in 2018. Liberty and the Big South agreed later in 2017 that the school would continue to house all of its non-football sports (except for field hockey and women&#x27;s swimming, neither of which is sponsored by the Big South) in that conference for the immediate future. Once Liberty became a full FBS member at the start of the 2019–20 school year, it would have technically become a Big South associate member (barring the school joining an FBS conference). However, Liberty&#x27;s plans would change several months later, as it instead announced in May 2018 that it would move its non-football sports to the ASUN effective that July (except for the aforementioned field hockey and women&#x27;s swimming, also not sponsored by the ASUN).

In November 2017, the University of South Carolina Upstate and Hampton University announced that they would be leaving the ASUN and Mid-Eastern Athletic Conference, respectively, to join the Big South, starting in the fall of 2018.

On November 19, 2017, Presbyterian College announced it would be moving its football program to the non-scholarship Pioneer Football League. Presbyterian&#x27;s last Big South football season was in 2019; the Blue Hose planned to play the 2020 season as an independent before joining the Pioneer League for 2021 and beyond. The Blue Hose remain a member of the Big South in all other sports.

A more recent change to its core membership was the July 2021 arrival of North Carolina A&amp;T State University from the MEAC as a full member, including football. At the same time, Robert Morris University was planned to join as a football-only member. North Carolina A&amp;T joined on the originally planned schedule, but Robert Morris became a Big South football member in November 2020. COVID-19 led the conference to move its 2020 football season to spring 2021. Since two of the eight Big South football members (apart from RMU) chose to play in the originally scheduled fall 2020 season and a third chose not to play football at all in 2020–21, the Big South chose to bring the Colonials into the football league for spring 2021.

More recently, the Big South added three new single-sport members in women&#x27;s lacrosse effective with the 2022 season (2021–22 school year): Furman University, Mercer University, and Wofford College. All three are full members of the Southern Conference (SoCon), which disbanded its women&#x27;s lacrosse league after the 2021 season.

On January 25, 2022, the Colonial Athletic Association (now the Coastal Athletic Association) announced that Hampton University would join that conference, as well as CAA Football, its technically separate football league, on July 1, 2022. On February 22, that conference announced that North Carolina A&amp;T State University would be leaving the Big South, joining the all-sports CAA on July 1. North Carolina A&amp;T would play Big South football in 2022 and join CAA Football on July 1, 2023.

Also on February 22, the conference announced its intent to combine its football membership with the Ohio Valley Conference beginning in 2023 and operate as the OVC–Big South Football Association. The following month saw Bryant University announced as a new football-only member effective with the 2022 season. Campbell announced on August 3 that it would join both sides of the CAA in 2023 as well. This was followed by Bryant announcing that it would join CAA Football in 2024. On November 28, it was announced that Robert Morris would also leave the association and return football to its previous home, the Northeast Conference effective after the 2023 football season.

<text>An aerospace manufacturer is a company or individual involved in the various aspects of designing, building, testing, selling, and maintaining aircraft, aircraft parts, missiles, rockets, or spacecraft. Aerospace is a high technology industry.

The aircraft industry is the industry supporting aviation by building aircraft and manufacturing aircraft parts for their maintenance. This includes aircraft and parts used for civil aviation and military aviation. Most production is done pursuant to type certificates and Defense Standards issued by a government body. This term has been largely subsumed by the more encompassing term: &quot;aerospace industry&quot;.

== Market ==

In 2015 the aircraft production was worth US$180.3 billion: 61% airliners, 14% business and general aviation, 12% military aircraft, 10% military rotary wing and 3% civil rotary wing; while their MRO was worth $135.1 Bn or $315.4 Bn combined.

The global aerospace industry was worth $838.5 billion in 2017: aircraft &amp; engine OEMs represented 28% ($ Bn), civil &amp; military MRO &amp; upgrades 27% ($ Bn), aircraft systems &amp; component manufacturing 26% ($ Bn), satellites &amp; space 7% ($ Bn), missiles &amp; UAVs 5% ($ Bn) and other activity, including flight simulators, defense electronics, public research accounted for 7% ($ Bn).
The Top 10 countries with the largest industrial bases in 2017 were the United States with $408.4 billion (representing % of the whole), followed by France with $69 billion (%), then China with $61.2 billion (%), the United Kingdom with $48.8 billion (%), Germany with $46.2 billion (%), Russia with $27.1 billion (%), Canada with $24 billion (%), Japan with $21 billion (%), Spain with $14 billion (%) and India with $11 billion (%). These ten countries represent $731 billion or % of the whole industry.

In 2018, the new commercial aircraft value is projected for $270.4 billion while business aircraft will amount for $18 billion and civil helicopters for $4 billion.

== Largest aerospace companies ==


== Geography ==

In September 2018, PwC ranked aerospace manufacturing attractiveness: the most attractive country was the United States, with $240 billion in sales in 2017, due to the sheer size of the industry (#1) and educated workforce (#1), low geopolitical risk (#4, #1 is Japan), strong transportation infrastructure (#5, #1 is Hong Kong), a healthy economy (#10, #1 is China), but high costs (#7, #1 is Denmark) and average tax policy (#36, #1 is Qatar).
Following were Canada, Singapore, Switzerland and United Kingdom.

Within the US, the most attractive was Washington state, due to the best Industry (#1), leading Infrastructure (#4, New Jersey is #1) and Economy (#4, Texas is #1), good labor (#9, Massachusetts is #1), average tax policy (#17, Alaska is #1) but is costly (#33, Montana is #1).
Washington is tied to Boeing Commercial Airplanes, earning $10.3 billion, is home to 1,400 aerospace-related businesses, and has the highest aerospace jobs concentration.
Following are Texas, Georgia, Arizona and Colorado.

In the US, the Department of Defense and NASA are the two biggest consumers of aerospace technology and products. The Bureau of Labor Statistics of the United States reported that the aerospace industry employed 444,000 wage and salary jobs in 2004, many of which were in Washington and California, this marked a steep decline from the peak years during the Reagan Administration when total employment exceeded 1,000,000 aerospace industry workers.

During that period of recovery a special program to restore U.S. competitiveness across all U.S. industries, Project Socrates, contributed to employment growth as the U.S. aerospace industry captured 72 percent of world aerospace market. By 1999 U.S. share of the world market fell to 52 percent.

In the European Union, aerospace companies such as Airbus, Safran, BAE Systems, Thales, Dassault, Saab AB, Terma A/S, Patria Plc and Leonardo are participants in the global aerospace industry and research effort.

In Russia, large aerospace companies like Oboronprom and the United Aircraft Corporation (encompassing Mikoyan, Sukhoi, Ilyushin, Tupolev, Yakovlev, and Irkut, which includes Beriev) are among the major global players in this industry.

=== Cities ===

Important locations of the civil aerospace industry worldwide include Seattle, Wichita, Kansas, Dayton, Ohio and St. Louis in the United States (Boeing), Montreal and Toronto in Canada (Bombardier, Pratt &amp; Whitney Canada), Toulouse and Bordeaux in France (Airbus, Dassault, ATR), Seville in Spain and Hamburg in Germany (Airbus), the North-West of England and Bristol in Britain (Airbus and AgustaWestland), Komsomolsk-on-Amur and Irkutsk in Russia (Sukhoi, Beriev), Kyiv and Kharkiv in Ukraine (Antonov), Nagoya in Japan (Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Aerospace and Kawasaki Heavy Industries Aerospace), as well as São José dos Campos in Brazil where Embraer is based.

== Consolidation ==

Several consolidations took place in the aerospace and defense industries over the last few decades.

Airbus prominently illustrated the European airliner manufacturing consolidation in the late 1960s.

Between 1988 and 2010, more than 5,452 mergers and acquisitions with a total known-value of US$579 billion were announced worldwide.

In 1993, then United States Secretary of Defense Les Aspin and his deputy William J. Perry held the &quot;Last Supper&quot; at the Pentagon with contractors executives who were told that there were twice as many military suppliers as he wanted to see: $55 billion in military–industry mergers took place from 1992 to 1997, leaving mainly Boeing, Lockheed Martin, Northrop Grumman and Raytheon.
Boeing bought McDonnell Douglas for US$13.3 billion in 1996.
Raytheon acquired Hughes Aircraft Company for $9.5 billion in 1997.

BAE Systems is the successor company to numerous British aircraft manufacturers which merged throughout the second half of the 20th century. Many of these mergers followed the 1957 Defence White Paper. Marconi Electronic Systems, a subsidiary of the General Electric Company plc, was acquired by British Aerospace for US$12.3 billion in 1999 merger, to form BAE Systems.

In 2002, when Fairchild Dornier was bankrupt, Airbus, Boeing or Bombardier declined to take the 728JET/928JET large regional jet program as mainline and regional aircraft manufacturers were split and Airbus was digesting its ill-fated Fokker acquisition a decade earlier.

On September 4, 2017, United Technologies acquired Rockwell Collins in cash and stock for $23 billion, $30 billion including Rockwell Collins&#x27; net debt, for $500+ million of synergies expected by year four.

The Oct. 16, 2017 announcement of the CSeries partnership between Airbus and Bombardier Aerospace could trigger a daisy chain of reactions towards a new order. 
Airbus gets a new, efficient model at the lower end of the narrowbody market which provides the bulk of airliner profits and can abandon the slow selling A319 while Bombardier benefits from the growth in this expanded market even if it holds a smaller residual stake.
Boeing could forge a similar alliance with either Embraer with its E-jet E2 or Mitsubishi Heavy Industries and its MRJ.

On 21 December, Boeing and Embraer confirmed to be discussing a potential combination with a transaction subject to Brazilian government regulators, the companies&#x27; boards and shareholders approvals.
The weight of Airbus and Boeing could help E2 and CSeries sales but the 100-150 seats market seems slow.
As the CSeries, renamed A220, and E-jet E2 are more capable than their predecessors, they moved closer to the lower end of the narrowbodies.
In 2018, the four Western airframers combined into two within nine months as Boeing acquired 80% of Embraer&#x27;s airliners for $3.8 billion on July 5.

On April 3, 2020, Raytheon and United Technologies Corporation (except Otis Worldwide, leaving Rockwell Collins and engine maker Pratt and Whitney) merged to form Raytheon Technologies Corporation, with combined sales of $79 billion in 2019.

The most prominent unions between 1995 and 2020 include those of Boeing and McDonnell Douglas; the French, German and Spanish parts of EADS; and United Technologies with Rockwell Collins then Raytheon, but many mergers projects did not went through: Textron-Bombardier, EADS-BAE Systems, Hawker Beechcraft-Superior Aviation, GE-Honeywell, BAE Systems-Boeing (or Lockheed Martin), Dassault-Aerospatiale, Safran-Thales, BAE Systems-Rolls-Royce or Lockheed Martin–Northrop Grumman.

== Suppliers ==

The largest aerospace suppliers are United Technologies with $28.2 billion of revenue, followed by GE Aviation with $24.7 billion, Safran with $22.5 billion, Rolls-Royce Holdings with $16.9 billion, Honeywell Aerospace with $15.2 billion and Rockwell Collins including B/E Aerospace with $8.1 billion. Electric aircraft development could generate large changes for the aerospace suppliers.

On 26 November 2018, United Technologies announced the completion of its Rockwell Collins acquisition, renaming systems supplier UTC Aerospace Systems as Collins Aerospace, for $23 billion of sales in 2017 and 70,000 employees, and $39.0 billion of sales in 2017 combined with engine manufacturer Pratt &amp; Whitney.

== Supply chain ==

Before the 1980s/1990s, aircraft and aeroengine manufacturers were vertically integrated.
Then Douglas aircraft outsourced large aerostructures and the Bombardier Global Express pioneered the &quot;Tier 1&quot; supply chain model inspired by automotive industry, with 10-12 risk-sharing limited partners funding around half of the development costs.
The Embraer E-Jet followed in the late 1990s with fewer than 40 primary suppliers. 
Tier 1 suppliers were led by Honeywell, Safran, Goodrich Corporation and Hamilton Sundstrand.

In the 2000s, Rolls-Royce reduced its supplier count after bringing in automotive supply chain executives.
On the Airbus A380, less than 100 major suppliers outsource 60% of its value, even 80% on the A350.
Boeing embraced an aggressive Tier 1 model for the 787 but with its difficulties began to question why it was earning lower margins than its suppliers while it seemed to take all the risk, ensuing its 2011 &quot;Partnering for Success&quot; initiative, as Airbus initiated its own &quot;Scope+&quot; initiative for the A320.
Tier 1 consolidation also affects engine manufacturers : GE Aerospace acquired Avio in 2013 and Rolls-Royce took control of ITP Aero.

<doc id="79616" wikidata="Q134929" url="?curid=79616" title="Pindar">
<text>Pindar (; ; ; ) was an Ancient Greek lyric poet from Thebes. Of the canonical nine lyric poets of ancient Greece, his work is the best preserved. Quintilian wrote, &quot;Of the nine lyric poets, Pindar is by far the greatest, in virtue of his inspired magnificence, the beauty of his thoughts and figures, the rich exuberance of his language and matter, and his rolling flood of eloquence, characteristics which, as Horace rightly held, make him inimitable.&quot; His poems can also, however, seem difficult and even peculiar. The Athenian comic playwright Eupolis once remarked that they &quot;are already reduced to silence by the disinclination of the multitude for elegant learning&quot;. Some scholars in the modern age also found his poetry perplexing, at least until the 1896 discovery of some poems by his rival Bacchylides; comparisons of their work showed that many of Pindar&#x27;s idiosyncrasies are typical of archaic genres rather than of only the poet himself. His poetry, while admired by critics, still challenges the casual reader and his work is largely unread among the general public.

Pindar was the first Greek poet to reflect on the nature of poetry and on the poet&#x27;s role. His poetry illustrates the beliefs and values of Archaic Greece at the dawn of the Classical period. Like other poets of the Archaic Age, he has a profound sense of the vicissitudes of life, but he also articulates a passionate faith in what men can achieve by the grace of the gods, most famously expressed in the conclusion to one of his Victory Odes:

&lt;poem&gt;
Creatures of a day! What is anyone?
What is anyone not? A dream of a shadow
Is our mortal being. But when there comes to men
A gleam of splendour given of heaven,
Then rests on them a light of glory
And blessed are their days. (&quot;Pythian 8&quot;)
&lt;/poem&gt;

== Biography ==
===Sources===
Five ancient sources contain all the recorded details of Pindar&#x27;s life. One of them is a short biography discovered in 1961 on an Egyptian papyrus dating from at least 200 AD (P.Oxy.2438). The other four are collections that were not finalized until some 1600 years after his death:
* A brief biography of Pindar and his tomb in Boeotia, from Pausanias&#x27;s “descriptions of Greece” [9.23.2]-[9.23.5].
* &quot;Commentaries on Pindar&quot; by Eustathius of Thessalonica;
* &quot;Vita Vratislavensis&quot;, found in a manuscript at Wrocław, author unknown;
* a text by Thomas Magister;
* some meagre writings attributed to the lexicographer Suidas.
Although these sources are based on a much older literary tradition, going as far back as Chamaeleon of Heraclea in the 4th century BC, they are generally viewed with scepticism today: much of the material is clearly fanciful. Scholars both ancient and modern have turned to Pindar&#x27;s own workhis victory odes in particularas a source of biographical information: some of the poems touch on historic events and can be accurately dated. The 1962 publication of Elroy Bundy&#x27;s ground-breaking work &quot;Studia Pindarica&quot; led to a change in scholarly opinion: the Odes were no longer seen as expressions of Pindar&#x27;s personal thoughts and feelings, but rather as public statements &quot;dedicated to the single purpose of eulogizing men and communities.&quot; It has been claimed that biographical interpretations of the poems are due to a &quot;fatal conjunction&quot; of historicism and Romanticism. In other words, we know almost nothing about Pindar&#x27;s life based on either traditional sources or his own poems. However, the pendulum of intellectual fashion has begun to change direction again, and cautious use of the poems for some biographical purposes is considered acceptable once more.

===Life===
====Infancy to adulthood====
Pindar was born circa 518 BC (the 65th Olympiad) in Cynoscephalae, a village in Boeotia, not far from Thebes. His father&#x27;s name is variously given as Daiphantus, Pagondas or Scopelinus, and his mother&#x27;s name was Cleodice. It is told that in his youth, or possibly infancy, bees built a honeycomb in his mouth and this was the reason he became a poet of honey-like verses. (An identical fate has been ascribed to other poets of the archaic period.) Pindar was about twenty years old in 498 BC when he was commissioned by the ruling family in Thessaly to compose his first victory ode (&quot;Pythian 10&quot;). He studied the art of lyric poetry in Athens, where his tutor was Lasos of Hermione, and he is also said to have received some helpful criticism from Corinna.

The early to middle years of Pindar&#x27;s career coincided with the Greco-Persian Wars during the reigns of Darius and Xerxes. This period included the first Persian invasion of Greece, which ended at the Battle of Marathon in 490 BC, and the second Persian invasion of Greece (480–479 BC). During the second invasion, when Pindar was almost forty years old, Thebes was occupied by Xerxes&#x27; general, Mardonius, who with many Theban aristocrats subsequently perished at the Battle of Plataea. It is possible that Pindar spent much of this time at Aegina. His choice of residence during the earlier invasion in 490 BC is not known, but he was able to attend the Pythian Games of that year, where he first met the Sicilian prince, Thrasybulus, nephew of Theron of Acragas. Thrasybulus had driven the winning chariot; and he and Pindar were to form a lasting friendship, paving the way for his subsequent visit to Sicily.

====Middle age====

Pindar seems to have used his odes to advance his, and his friends&#x27;, personal interests. In 462 BC he composed two odes in honour of Arcesilas, king of Cyrene, (&quot;Pythians 4 and 5&quot;), pleading for the return from exile of a friend, Demophilus. In the latter ode Pindar proudly mentions his own ancestry, which he shared with the king, as an Aegeid or descendant of Aegeus, the legendary king of Athens. The clan was influential in many parts of the Greek world, having intermarried with ruling families in Thebes, in Lacedaemonia, and in cities that claimed Lacedaemonian descent, such as Cyrene and Thera. The historian Herodotus considered the clan important enough to deserve mention (&quot;Histories&quot; IV.147). Membership of this clan possibly contributed to Pindar&#x27;s success as a poet, and it informed his political views, which are marked by a conservative preference for oligarchic governments of the Doric kind.

Pindar might not actually claim to be an Aegeid since his &#x27;I&#x27; statements do not necessarily refer to himself. The Aegeid clan did however have a branch in Thebes, and his reference to &#x27;my ancestors&#x27; in Pythian 5 could have been spoken on behalf of both Arcesilas and himselfhe may have used this ambivalence to establish a personal link with his patrons.

He was possibly the Theban proxenos or consul for Aegina and/or Molossia, as indicated in another of his odes, Nemean 7, in which he glorifies Neoptolemus, a national hero of Aegina and Molossia. According to tradition, Neoptolemus died disgracefully in a fight with priests at the temple in Delphi over their share of some sacrificial meat. Pindar diplomatically glosses over this and concludes mysteriously with an earnest protestation of innocence&quot;But shall my heart never admit that I with words none can redeem dishonoured Neoptolemus&quot;. Possibly he was responding to anger among Aeginetans and/or Molossians over his portrayal of Neoptolemus in an earlier poem, &quot;Paean 6&quot;, which had been commissioned by the priests at Delphi and which depicted the hero&#x27;s death in traditional terms, as divine retribution for his crimes.

Some doubt this biographical interpretation of &quot;Nemean 7&quot; since it is largely based on marginal comments by scholiasts and Pindaric scholiasts are often unreliable. The fact that Pindar gave different versions of the myth may simply reflect the needs of different genres, and does not necessarily indicate a personal dilemma. &quot;Nemean 7&quot; in fact is the most controversial and obscure of Pindar&#x27;s victory odes, and scholars ancient and modern have been ingenious and imaginative in their attempts to explain it, so far with no agreed success.

In his first Pythian ode, composed in 470 BC in honour of the Sicilian tyrant Hieron, Pindar celebrated a series of victories by Greeks against foreign invaders: Athenian and Spartan-led victories against Persia at Salamis and Plataea, and victories by the western Greeks led by Theron of Acragas and Hieron against the Carthaginians and Etruscans at the battles of Himera and Cumae. Such celebrations were not appreciated by his fellow Thebans: they had sided with the Persians and had incurred many losses and privations as a result of their defeat. His praise of Athens with such epithets as &quot;bulwark of Hellas&quot; (&quot;fragment 76&quot;) and &quot;city of noble name and sunlit splendour&quot; (Nemean 5) induced the authorities in Thebes to fine him 5,000 drachmae, to which the Athenians are said to have responded with a gift of 10,000 drachmae. According to another account, the Athenians even made him their proxenus or consul in Thebes. His association with the fabulously rich Hieron was another source of annoyance at home. It was probably in response to Theban sensitivities over this issue that he denounced the rule of tyrants (i.e. rulers like Hieron) in an ode composed shortly after a visit to Hieron&#x27;s sumptuous court in 476–75 BC (&quot;Pythian 11&quot;).

Pindar&#x27;s actual phrasing in &quot;Pythian 11&quot; was &quot;I deplore the lot of tyrants&quot; and though this was traditionally interpreted as an apology for his dealings with Sicilian tyrants like Hieron, an alternative date for the ode has led some scholars to conclude that it was in fact a covert reference to the tyrannical behaviour of the Athenians, although this interpretation is ruled out if we accept the earlier note about covert references. According to yet another interpretation Pindar is simply delivering a formulaic warning to the successful athlete to avoid hubris. It is highly unlikely that Pindar ever acted for Athenians as their proxenus or consul in Thebes.

Lyric verse was conventionally accompanied by music and dance, and Pindar himself wrote the music and choreographed the dances for his victory odes. Sometimes he trained the performers at his home in Thebes, and sometimes he trained them at the venue where they performed. Commissions took him to all parts of the Greek worldto the Panhellenic festivals in mainland Greece (Olympia, Delphi, Corinth and Nemea), westwards to Sicily, eastwards to the seaboard of Asia Minor, north to Macedonia and Abdera (&quot;Paean 2&quot;) and south to Cyrene on the African coast. Other poets at the same venues vied with him for the favours of patrons. His poetry sometimes reflects this rivalry. For example, &quot;Olympian 2&quot; and &quot;Pythian 2&quot;, composed in honour of the Sicilian tyrants Theron and Hieron following his visit to their courts in 476–75 BC, refer respectively to &quot;ravens&quot; and an &quot;ape&quot;, apparently signifying rivals who were engaged in a campaign of smears against himpossibly the poets Simonides and his nephew Bacchylides. Pindar&#x27;s original treatment of narrative myth, often relating events in reverse chronological order, is said to have been a favourite target for criticism. Simonides was known to charge high fees for his work and Pindar is said to have alluded to this in &quot;Isthmian 2&quot;, where he refers to the Muse as &quot;a hireling journeyman&quot;. He appeared in many poetry competitions and was defeated five times by his compatriot, the poet Corinna, in revenge of which he called her &quot;Boeotian sow&quot; in one of his odes (&quot;Olympian&quot; 6. 89f.).

It was assumed by ancient sources that Pindar&#x27;s odes were performed by a chorus, but this has been challenged by some modern scholars, who argue that the odes were in fact performed solo. It is not known how commissions were arranged, nor if the poet travelled widely: even when poems include statements like &quot;I have come&quot; it is not certain that this was meant literally. Uncomplimentary references to Bacchylides and Simonides were found by scholiasts but there is no reason to accept their interpretation of the odes. In fact, some scholars have interpreted the allusions to fees in &quot;Isthmian 2&quot; as a request by Pindar for payment of fees owed to himself. His defeats by Corinna were probably invented by ancient commentators to account for the &quot;Boeotian sow&quot; remark, a phrase moreover that was completely misunderstood by scholiasts, since Pindar was scoffing at a reputation that all Boeotians had for stupidity.

====Old age and death====
His fame as a poet drew Pindar into Greek politics. Athens, the most important city in Greece throughout his poetic career, was a rival of his home city, Thebes, and also of the island state Aegina, whose leading citizens commissioned about a quarter of his Victory Odes. There is no open condemnation of the Athenians in any of his poems but criticism is implied. For example, the victory ode mentioned above (&quot;Pythian 8&quot;) describes the downfall of the giants Porphyrion and Typhon and this might be Pindar&#x27;s way of covertly celebrating a recent defeat of Athens by Thebes at the Battle of Coronea (447 BC). The poem ends with a prayer for Aegina&#x27;s freedom, long threatened by Athenian ambitions.
Covert criticism of Athens (traditionally located in odes such as &quot;Pythian&quot; 8, &quot;Nemean&quot; 8 and &quot;Isthmian&quot; 7) is now dismissed as highly unlikely, even by scholars who allow some biographical and historical interpretations of the poems.

One of his last odes (&quot;Pythian 8&quot;) indicates that he lived near a shrine to the oracle Alcmaeon and that he stored some of his wealth there. In the same ode he says that he had recently received a prophecy from Alcmaeon during a journey to Delphi (&quot;...he met me and proved the skills of prophecy that all his race inherit&quot;) but he does not reveal what the long-dead prophet said to him nor in what form he appeared. The ode was written to commemorate a victory by an athlete from Aegina.

Pindar doesn&#x27;t necessarily mean himself when he uses the first person singular. Many of his &#x27;I&#x27; statements are generic, indicating somebody engaged in the role of a singer i.e. a &#x27;bardic&#x27; I. Other &#x27;I&#x27; statements articulate values typical of the audience, and some are spoken on behalf of the subjects celebrated in the poems. The &#x27;I&#x27; that received the prophecy in &quot;Pythian 8&quot; therefore might have been the athlete from Aegina, not Pindar. In that case the prophecy must have been about his performance at the Pythian Games, and the property stored at the shrine was just a votive offering.

Nothing is recorded about Pindar&#x27;s wife and son except their names, Megacleia and Daiphantus.

About ten days before he died, the goddess Persephone appeared to him and complained that she was the only divinity to whom he had never composed a hymn. She said he would come to her soon and compose one then.

Pindar lived to about eighty years of age. He died around 438 BC while attending a festival at Argos. His ashes were taken back home to Thebes by his musically gifted daughters, Eumetis and Protomache.

====Post mortem====
One of Pindar&#x27;s female relatives claimed that he dictated some verses to her in honour of Persephone after he had been dead for several days. Some of Pindar&#x27;s verses were inscribed in letters of gold on a temple wall in Lindos, Rhodes. At Delphi, where he had been elected a priest of Apollo, the priests exhibited an iron chair on which he used to sit during the festival of the Theoxenia. Every night, while closing the temple doors, they intoned: &quot;Let Pindar the poet go unto the supper of the gods!&quot;

Pindar&#x27;s house in Thebes became one of the city&#x27;s landmarks. When Alexander the Great demolished Thebes in 335 BC, as punishment for its resistance to Macedonian expansionism, he ordered the house be left intact out of gratitude for verses praising his ancestor, Alexander I of Macedon.

===Values and beliefs===
Pindar&#x27;s values and beliefs have been inferred from his poetry. No other ancient Greek poet has left so many comments about the nature of his art. He justified and exalted choral poetry at a time when society was turning away from it. It &quot;... had for two centuries reflected and shaped the sentiments, the outlook, and the convictions of the Greek aristocracies ... and Pindar spoke up for it with passionate assurance&quot;. His poetry is a meeting ground for gods, heroes and meneven the dead are spoken of as participants: &quot;Deep in the earth their heart listens&quot;.

His view of the gods is traditional but more self-consistent than Homer&#x27;s and more reverent. He never depicts gods in a demeaning role. He seems indifferent to the intellectual reforms that were shaping the theology of the times. Thus an eclipse is not a mere physical effect, as contemplated by early thinkers such as Thales, Anaximander and Heraclitus, nor was it even a subject for bold wonder, as it was for an earlier poet, Archilochus; instead Pindar treated an eclipse as a portent of evil.

Gods are the embodiment of power, uncompromisingly proud of their nature and violent in defense of their privileges. There is some rationalization of religious belief, but it is within a tradition at least as old as Hesiod, where abstractions are personified, such as &quot;Truth the daughter of Zeus&quot;. Sometimes the wording suggests a belief in &#x27;God&#x27; rather than &#x27;a god&#x27; (e.g. &quot;What is God? Everything&quot;), but the implications are not given full expression and the poems are not examples of monotheism. Nor do they vocalize a belief in Fate as the background to the gods, unlike the plays of Aeschylus for example. Pindar subjects both fortune and fate to divine will (e.g. &quot;child of Zeus ... Fortune&quot;).

He selects and revises traditional myths so as not to diminish the dignity and majesty of the gods. Such revisionism was not unique. Xenophanes had castigated Homer and Hesiod for the misdeeds they ascribed to gods, such as theft, adultery and deception, and Pythagoras had envisioned those two poets being punished in Hades for blasphemy. A subtle example of Pindar&#x27;s approach can be found in his treatment of the myth of Apollo&#x27;s rape of the nymph Cyrene. As the god of the Delphic oracle, Apollo is all-knowing, yet in keeping with his anthropomorphic nature he seeks information about the nymph from a third party, in this case the centaur Chiron. Chiron however affirms the god&#x27;s omniscience with an elegant compliment, as if Apollo had only pretended to be ignorant: &quot;You, Sire, who know the appointed end of all, and all paths...&quot; Apollo&#x27;s abduction of the nymph is not presented as a shameful act. Pindar&#x27;s gods are above such ethical issues and it is not for men to judge them by ordinary human standards. Indeed, the finest breeds of men resulted from divine passions: &quot;For Pindar a mortal woman who is loved by a god is an outstanding lesson in divine favours handsomely bestowed&quot;.

Being descendants of divine unions with privileged mortals, mythical heroes are an intermediate group between gods and men, and they are sympathetic to human ambitions. Thus, for example, Pindar not only invokes Zeus for help on behalf of the island of Aegina but also its national heroes Aeacus, Peleus and Telamon. Unlike the gods, however, heroes can be judged according to ordinary human standards and they are sometimes shown in the poems to demean themselves. Even in that case, they receive special consideration. Thus Pindar refers obliquely to the murder of Phocus by his brothers Peleus and Telamon (&quot;I am shy of speaking of a huge risk, hazarded not in right&quot;), telling the audience that he will not talk of it (&quot;silence is a man&#x27;s wisest counsel&quot;). The Theban hero Heracles was a favourite subject but in one poem he is depicted as small in order to be compared with a small Theban patron who had won the pankration at the Isthmian Games: a unique example of Pindar&#x27;s readiness to shape traditional myths to fit the occasion, even if not always flattering to the mythical hero. A hero&#x27;s status is not diminished by an occasional blemish but rests on a summary view of his heroic exploits.

Some of his patrons claimed divine descent, such as Diagoras of Rhodes, but Pindar makes all men akin to gods if they realize their full potential: their innate gifts are divinely bestowed, and even then success still depends on the gods&#x27; active favour. In honouring such men, therefore, Pindar was honouring the gods too. His statements about life after death were not self-consistent but that was typical for the times. Traditional ambivalence, as expressed by Homer, had been complicated by a growth of religious sects, such as the Eleusinian mysteries and Pythagoreanism, representing various schemes of rewards and punishments in the next life. However, for the poet, glory and lasting fame were men&#x27;s greatest assurance of a life well-lived. He presents no theory of history apart from the view that Fortune is variable even for the best men, an outlook suited to moderation in success, courage in adversity. Notions of &#x27;good&#x27; and &#x27;bad&#x27; in human nature were not analysed by him in any depth nor did he arrive at anything like the compassionate ethics of his near contemporary, Simonides of Ceos. His poems are indifferent to the ordinary mass of people. They are dismissed with phrases such as &quot;the brute multitude&quot; (&quot;Pythian Ode&quot; 2.87). Nor are the poems concerned with the fate of rich and powerful men once they lose their wealth and social status (compared for example with the bitter and disillusioned poems of Theognis of Megara). They are more interested in what successful men do with their good fortune: success brings obligations, and religious and artistic activities need patrons.

Whereas the Muses inspired Homer with relevant information and with the language to express it, Pindar seems to receive only their inspiration: his role is to shape that inspiration with his own wisdom and skill. Like his patrons, whom he immortalizes in verse, he owes his success to hard work as well as to innate gifts; though he hires himself out, he has a vocation. The Muses are to him as an oracle is to a prophet, and lesser poets are to him as ravens are to an eagle; the art of such men is as hackneyed as garland-making; his is magical:
==Works==
Pindar&#x27;s strongly individual genius is apparent in all his extant compositions but, unlike Simonides and Stesichorus for example, he created no new lyrical genres. He was however innovative in his use of the genres he inheritedfor example, in one of his victory odes (&quot;Olympian&quot; 3), he announces his invention of a new type of musical accompaniment, combining lyre, flute and human voice (though our knowledge of Greek music is too sketchy to allow us to understand the full nature of this innovation).

Although he probably spoke Boeotian Greek, he composed in a literary language that tended to rely more on the Doric dialect than his rival Bacchylides, but less insistently than Alcman. There is an admixture of other dialects, especially Aeolic and epic forms, and an occasional use of some Boeotian words.

He composed &#x27;choral&#x27; songs yet it is by no means certain that they were all sung by choirsthe use of choirs is testified only by the generally unreliable scholiasts.

Scholars at the Library of Alexandria collected his compositions in seventeen books organized according to genre:
* 1 book of &quot;hymnoi&quot;&quot;hymns&quot;
* 1 book of &quot;paianes&quot;&quot;paeans&quot;
* 2 books of &quot;dithyramboi&quot;&quot;dithyrambs&quot;
* 2 books of &quot;prosodia&quot;&quot;&quot;processionals&quot;&quot;
* 3 books of &quot;parthenia&quot;&quot;songs for maidens&quot;
* 2 books of &quot;hyporchemata&quot;&quot;&quot;songs for light dances&quot;&quot;
* 1 book of &quot;enkomia&quot;&quot;songs of praise&quot;
* 1 book of &quot;threnoi&quot;&quot;laments&quot;
* 4 books of &quot;epinikia&quot;&quot;victory odes&quot;

Of this vast and varied corpus, only the &quot;epinikia&quot;odes written to commemorate athletic victoriessurvive in complete form; the rest survive only by quotations in other ancient authors or from papyrus scraps unearthed in Egypt. Even in fragmentary form however, they reveal the same complexity of thought and language that are found in the victory odes.

Dionysius of Halicarnassus singled out Pindar&#x27;s work as an outstanding example of austere style () but he noted its absence in the maiden songs or &quot;parthenia&quot;. One surviving fragment of a maiden song does seem to be different in tone, due however to the fact that it is spoken in the character of a girl:
Enough of his dithyrambic poetry survives for comparison with that of Bacchylides, who used it for narrative. Pindar&#x27;s dithyrambs are an exuberant display of religious feeling, capturing the wild spirit of Dionysus and pointing forward to the ecstatic songs of Euripides&#x27; &quot;Bacchae&quot;. In one of these, dedicated to the Athenians and written to be sung in Spring, he depicts the divine energy of the revitalized world.
===Victory odes===

Almost all Pindar&#x27;s victory odes are celebrations of triumphs gained by competitors in Panhellenic festivals such as the Olympian Games. The establishment of these athletic and musical festivals was among the greatest achievements of the Greek aristocracies. Even in the 5th century BC, when there was an increased tendency towards professionalism, they were predominantly aristocratic assemblies, reflecting the expense and leisure needed to attend such events either as a competitor or spectator. Attendance was an opportunity for display and self-promotion, and the prestige of victory, requiring commitment in time and/or wealth, went far beyond anything that accrues to athletic victories today, even in spite of the modern preoccupation with sport. Pindar&#x27;s odes capture something of the prestige and the aristocratic grandeur of the moment of victory, as in this stanza from one of his Isthmian Odes, here translated by Geoffrey S. Conway:

:::::If ever a man strives
:::With all his soul&#x27;s endeavour, sparing himself
:::Neither expense nor labour to attain
:::True excellence, then must we give to those
:::Who have achieved the goal, a proud tribute
:::::Of lordly praise, and shun
::::All thoughts of envious jealousy.
:::To a poet&#x27;s mind the gift is slight, to speak
:::A kind word for unnumbered toils, and build
:::For all to share a monument of beauty. (&quot;Isthmian&quot; I, antistrophe 3)

His victory odes are grouped into four books named after the Olympian, Pythian, Isthmian, and Nemean GamesPanhellenic festivals held respectively at Olympia, Delphi, Corinth and Nemea. This reflects the fact that most of the odes were composed in honour of boys, youths, and men who had recently enjoyed victories in athletic (and sometimes musical) contests at those festivals. In a few odes however much older victories, and even victories in lesser games, are celebrated, often as a pretext for addressing other issues or achievements. For example, &quot;Pythian 3&quot;, composed in honour of Hieron of Syracuse, briefly mentions a victory he had once enjoyed at the Pythian Games, but it is actually intended to console him for his chronic illness (similarly, &quot;Pythian&quot; 2 is like a private letter in its intimacy). &quot;Nemean 9&quot; and &quot;Nemean 10&quot; celebrate victories in games at Sicyon and Argos, and &quot;Nemean 11&quot; celebrates a victory in a municipal election on Tenedos (though it also mentions some obscure athletic victories). These three odes are the final odes in the &quot;Nemean&quot; book of odes, and there is a reason for their inclusion. In the original manuscripts, the four books of odes were arranged in the order of importance assigned to the festivals, with the Nemean festival, considered least important, coming last. Victory odes that lacked a Panhellenic subject were then bundled together at the end of the book of &quot;Nemean&quot; odes.

====Style====
Pindar&#x27;s poetic style is very distinctive, even when the peculiarities of the genre are set aside. The odes typically feature a grand and arresting opening, often with an architectural metaphor or a resounding invocation to a place or goddess. He makes rich use of decorative language and florid compound adjectives. Sentences are compressed to the point of obscurity, unusual words and periphrases give the language an esoteric quality, and transitions in meaning often seem erratic, the images seem to burst outit is a style that sometimes baffles but also makes his poetry vivid and unforgettable.
His odes were animated by...
Some of these qualities can be found, for example, in this stanza from &quot;Pythian 2&quot;, composed in honour of Hieron:
The stanza begins with a celebration of divine power, and then abruptly shifts to a darker, more allusive train of thought, featuring condemnation of a renowned poet, Archilochus, &quot;Grown fat on the harsh words of hate&quot;. Archilochus was an iambic poet, working within a genre that licensed abusive and scurrilous versea regrettable tendency from the viewpoint of Pindar, whose own persona is intensely earnest, preaching to Hieron the need for moderation (wealth with wisdom) and submission to the divine will. The reference to the embittered poet appears to be Pindar&#x27;s meditative response to some intrigues at Hieron&#x27;s court, possibly by his rivals, condemned elsewhere as &quot;a pair of ravens&quot; (&quot;Olympian 2&quot;). The intensity of the stanza suggests that it is the culmination and climax of the poem. In fact, the stanza occupies the middle of &quot;Pythian 2&quot; and the intensity is sustained throughout the poem from beginning to end. It is the sustained intensity of his poetry that Quintilian refers to above as a &quot;rolling flood of eloquence&quot; and Horace below refers to as the &quot;uncontrollable momentum&quot; of a river that has burst its banks. Longinus likens him to &quot;a vast fire&quot; and Athenaeus refers to him as &quot;the great-voiced Pindar&quot;.

Pindar&#x27;s treatment of myth is another unique aspect of his style, often involving variations on the traditional stories, since his original audience was familiar with the myths and this allowed him to concentrate on unique and surprising effects. Reversing the chronological order was one such effect, as in &quot;Olympian VII&quot; dedicated to Diagoras of Rhodes, but this could also resemble a circular pattern, beginning with a culminating event, followed by scenes leading up to it, and ending with its restatement, as in his account of the Dioscuri in &quot;Nemean 10&quot;. Myths enabled him to develop the themes and lessons that pre-occupy himin particular mankind&#x27;s exulted relation with the gods via heroic ancestors and, in contrast, the limitations and uncertainties of human existencebut sometimes the traditional stories were an embarrassment and were carefully edited, as for example:
&quot;Be still my tongue: here profits not / to tell the whole truth with clear face unveiled,&quot; (&quot;Nemean 5&quot;, epode 1); &quot;Away, away this story! / Let no such tale fall from my lips! / For to insult the gods is a fool&#x27;s wisdom,&quot; (&quot;Olympian 9&quot;, strophe 2); &quot;Senseless, I hold it, for a man to say / the gods eat mortal flesh. / I spurn the thought,&quot; (&quot;Olympian 1&quot;, epode 2). His mythical accounts are edited for dramatic and graphic effects, usually unfolding through a few grand gestures against a background of large, often symbolic elements such as sea, sky, darkness, fire or mountain.

====Structure====
Pindar&#x27;s odes typically begin with an invocation to a god or the Muses, followed by praise of the victor and often of his family, ancestors and home-town. Then follows a narrated myth, usually occupying the central and longest section of the poem, which exemplify a moral, while aligning the poet and his audience with the world of gods and heroes. The ode usually ends in more eulogies, for example of trainers (if the victor is a boy), and of relatives who have won past events, as well as with prayers or expressions of hope for future success. The event where the victory was gained is never described in detail, but there is often some mention of the hard work needed to bring the victory about.

A lot of modern criticism tries to find hidden structure or some unifying principle within the odes. 19th century criticism favoured &#x27;gnomic unity&#x27; i.e. that each ode is bound together by the kind of moralizing or philosophic vision typical of archaic Gnomic poetry. Later critics sought unity in the way certain words or images are repeated and developed within a particular ode. For others, the odes are just celebrations of men and their communities, in which the elements such as myths, piety, and ethics are stock themes that the poet introduces without much real thought. Some conclude that the requirement for unity is too modern to have informed Pindar&#x27;s ancient approach to a traditional craft.

The great majority of the odes are triadic in structurei.e., stanzas are grouped together in three&#x27;s as a lyrical unit. Each triad comprises two stanzas identical in length and meter (called &#x27;strophe&#x27; and &#x27;antistrophe&#x27;) and a third stanza (called an &#x27;epode&#x27;), differing in length and meter but rounding off the lyrical movement in some way. The shortest odes comprise a single triad, the largest (&quot;Pythian 4&quot;) comprises thirteen triads. Seven of the odes however are monostrophic (i.e., each stanza in the ode is identical in length and meter). The monostrophic odes seem to have been composed for victory marches or processions, whereas the triadic odes appear suited to choral dances. Pindar&#x27;s metrical rhythms are nothing like the simple, repetitive rhythms familiar to readers of English versetypically the rhythm of any given line recurs infrequently (for example, only once every ten, fifteen or twenty lines). This adds to the aura of complexity that surrounds Pindar&#x27;s work. In terms of meter, the odes fall roughly into two categoriesabout half are in dactylo-epitrites (a meter found for example in the works of Stesichorus, Simonides and Bacchylides) and the other half are in Aeolic metres based on iambs and choriambs.

====Chronological order====
Modern editors (e.g., Snell and Maehler in their Teubner edition), have assigned dates, securely or tentatively, to Pindar&#x27;s victory odes, based on ancient sources and other grounds. The date of an athletic victory is not always the date of composition but often serves merely as a &quot;terminus post quem&quot;. Many dates are based on comments by ancient sources who had access to published lists of victors, such as the Olympic list compiled by Hippias of Elis, and lists of Pythian victors made by Aristotle and Callisthenes. There were however no such lists for the Isthmian and Nemean GamesPausanias (6.13.8) complained that the Corinthians and Argives never kept proper records. The resulting uncertainty is reflected in the chronology below, with question marks clustered around Nemean and Isthmian entries, and yet it still represents a fairly clear general timeline of Pindar&#x27;s career as an epinician poet. The code M denotes monostrophic odes (odes in which all stanzas are metrically identical) and the rest are triadic (i.e. featuring strophes, antistrophes, epodes):

===Manuscripts, shreds and quotes===
Pindar&#x27;s verses have come down to us in a variety of ways. Some are only preserved as fragments via quotes by ancient sources and papyri unearthed by archeologists, as at Oxyrhynchusin fact the extant works of most of the other canonic lyric poets have survived only in this tattered form. Pindar&#x27;s extant verses are unique in that the bulk of themthe victory odeshave been preserved in a manuscript tradition, i.e., generations of scribes copying from earlier copies, possibly originating in a single archetypal copy and sometimes graphically demonstrated by modern scholars in the form of a stemma codicum, resembling a &#x27;family tree&#x27;. Pindar&#x27;s victory odes are preserved in just two manuscripts, but incomplete collections are located in many others, and all date from the mediaeval period. Some scholars have traced a stemma through these manuscripts, for example Ulrich von Wilamowitz-Moellendorff, who inferred from them the existence of a common source or archetype dated no earlier than the 2nd century AD, while others, such as C.M. Bowra, have argued that there are too many discrepancies between manuscripts to identify a specific lineage, even while accepting the existence of an archetype. Otto Schroeder identified two families of manuscripts but, following on the work of Polish-born classicist, Alexander Turyn, Bowra rejected this also. Different scholars interpret the extant manuscripts differently. Bowra for example singled out seven manuscripts as his primary sources (see below), all featuring errors and/or gaps due to loss of folios and careless copying, and one arguably characterized by the dubious interpolations of Byzantine scholars. These he cross-referenced and then supplemented or verified by reference to other, still more doubtful manuscripts, and some papyrus fragmentsa combination of sources on which he based his own edition of the odes and fragments. His general method of selection he defined as follows:


== Influence and legacy ==
* The influential Alexandrian poet Callimachus was fascinated by Pindar&#x27;s originality. His masterpiece &quot;Aetia&quot; included an elegy in honour of Queen Berenice, celebrating a chariot victory at the Nemean Games, composed in a style and presented in a manner that recall Pindar.
* The Hellenistic epic &quot;Argonautica&quot;, by Apollonius Rhodius, was influenced by some aspects of Pindar&#x27;s style and his use of episodic vignettes in narrative. The epic concerns the adventures of Jason, also touched on by Pindar in &quot;Pythian&quot; 4, and both poems link the myth to a Greek audience in Africa.
* There seems to have been a vogue for Pindaric-style lyrics following the &#x27;publication&#x27; of Horace&#x27;s &quot;Odes&quot; 1–3. Horace had mastered other styles such as Sapphic and Alcaeic, which had discouraged his contemporaries from attempting anything in the same form, but he had not composed anything in triadic stanzas in the manner of Pindar.
* Pindar was much read, quoted, and copied during the Byzantine Era. For example, Christophoros Mytilenaios of the 11th century parodied a chariot race in his sixth poem, employing explicit allusions to Pindar.
* During the 17th and 18th centuries, literary theorists in Europe distinguished between two types of lyric poetry, loosely associated with Horace and Pindar. Regular verses in four line stanzas were associated with Horace&#x27;s Odes, which did in fact inspire and influence poets of the period. Irregular verses in longer stanzas were termed Pindarics, though the association with Pindar was largely fanciful. Abraham Cowley was considered the main exponent of English Pindarics. In fact, the two styles were not always easy to distinguish and many &#x27;Pindaric&#x27; odes were quite Horatian in content, as in some poems by Thomas Gray.
* A &#x27;Pindaric Ode&#x27; was composed for the revived 1896 Olympic Games in Athens by the Oxford scholar George Stuart Robinson, and similar compositions were commissioned from and composed by classicist Armand D&#x27;Angour for the Athens Olympics in 2004 and the London Olympics in 2012.

===Bowra&#x27;s tribute===
C. M. Bowra, the leading Pindaric scholar of his generation and the editor of the 1935 OUP edition of his poems, summarized Pindar&#x27;s qualities in the following words:

<text>The Great Northwest Athletic Conference (GNAC) is a college athletic conference affiliated with the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) at the Division II level. It has historically operated in the northwestern United States, but also includes schools in Alaska, Montana, and British Columbia.

The GNAC is the only NCAA conference in any division with a Canadian university as a member.

==History==
The conference formed in 2001 when its original ten members split from the Pacific West Conference.


===Chronological timeline===
* 2001 - The Great Northwest Athletic Conference (GNAC) was founded. Charter members included the University of Alaska at Fairbanks, the University of Alaska at Anchorage, Central Washington University, Humboldt State University (now California State Polytechnic University, Humboldt), Northwest Nazarene University, Saint Martin&#x27;s, Seattle University, Seattle Pacific University, Western Oregon University and Western Washington University, effective beginning the 2001-02 academic year.
* 2006 - Humboldt State left the GNAC to join the California Collegiate Athletic Association (CCAA), effective after the 2005-06 academic year. This would result in the GNAC dropping football, with Western Washington and Central Washington becoming football affiliates of the now defunct North Central Conference and Western Oregon competing as a D-II independent.
* 2007 - Montana State University at Billings joined the GNAC, effective in the 2007-08 academic year.
* 2008 - Seattle left the GNAC to join the Division I ranks of the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) as an NCAA D-I Independent (who would later join the Western Athletic Conference (WAC), effective beginning the 2012-13 academic year), effective after the 2007-08 academic year.
* 2008 - Dixie State University joined the GNAC as an affiliate member for football (with Humboldt State returning for that sport), effective with the 2008 fall season (2008-09 academic year), leading to the GNAC to begin sponsoring football once again.
* 2010 - Simon Fraser University joined the GNAC, effective in the 2010-11 academic year.
* 2012 - Three institutions joined the GNAC as affiliate members: Azusa Pacific University for football, and the University of Mary and the University of Sioux Falls for men&#x27;s soccer, all effective with the 2012-13 academic year.
* 2013 - South Dakota School of Mines and Technology (South Dakota Mines) joined the GNAC as an affiliate member for men&#x27;s soccer, effective in the 2013 fall season (2013-14 academic year).
* 2014 - South Dakota Mines added football to its GNAC affiliate membership, effective in the 2014 fall season (2014-15 academic year).
* 2015 - South Dakota Mines left the GNAC as an affiliate member for men&#x27;s soccer, effective after the 2014 fall season (2014-15 academic year).
* 2015 - Concordia University–Portland joined the GNAC, effective in the 2015-16 academic year.
* 2016 - Dixie State and South Dakota Mines left the GNAC as affiliate members for football, effective after the 2015 fall season (2015-16 academic year).
* 2019 - Humboldt State left the GNAC as an affiliate member for football as the school announced it was dropping the sport after the 2018 fall season (2018-19 academic year).
* 2019 - The University of California San Diego (UC San Diego) and the University of Central Oklahoma (along with Humboldt State returning for that sport), joined the GNAC as affiliate members for women&#x27;s rowing, effective in the 2020 spring season (2019-20 academic year).
* 2020 - Concordia–Portland left the GNAC as the school announced that it would close, effective after the 2019-20 academic year.
* 2020 - Azusa Pacific left the GNAC as an affiliate member for football as the school announced it was dropping the sport after the 2020 fall season (2020-21 academic year).
* 2020 - UC San Diego left the GNAC as an affiliate member for women&#x27;s rowing, effective after the 2020 spring season (2019-20 academic year), coinciding with the start of its transition to NCAA Division I.
* 2022 - Central Washington, Western Oregon and Simon Fraser, the only 3 football-sponsoring schools remaining in the GNAC, announce that they will be joining the Lone Star Conference as football affiliates, bringing an end to the GNAC as a football conference for a second time, effective after the 2021 fall season (2021-22 academic year).

<doc id="79621" wikidata="Q1051735" url="?curid=79621" title="Soca music">
<text>Soca music, or the &quot;soul of calypso&quot;, is a genre of music that originated in Trinidad and Tobago in the 1970s. It is considered an offshoot of calypso, with influences from West African (e.g. kaiso) and East Indian rhythms. It was created by Ras Shorty I (or Lord Shorty) in an effort to revive traditional calypso, the popularity of which had been declining amongst younger generations in Trinidad due to the rise in popularity of reggae from Jamaica and soul and funk from the United States. From the 1980s onward, soca has developed into a range of new styles.

== Etymology ==
&quot;Soca&quot; is a portmanteau of the words &quot;soul&quot; and &quot;calypso&quot;. The genre defined was defined by Lord Shorty as the &quot;Soul of Calypso.&quot;

The word was originally spelled s-o-k-a-h by Lord Shorty. In a 1979 interview with &quot;Carnival Magazine,&quot; Lord Shorty stated that he &quot;came up with the name soca. I invented soca. And I never spelt it s-o-c-a. It was s-o-k-a-h to reflect the East Indian influence.&quot; The use of &quot;kah&quot; (the Hindi word for ‘divine’) referenced the genre&#x27;s Indo-Caribbean influence. However, s-o-c-a quickly became the popular spelling after a journalist, Ivor Ferreira, misspelled the name. The article, which included an interview with Lord Shorty, was published during the 1976 Trinidad Carnival season. The article said &quot;Shorty is doing soca&quot;. Lord Shorty confirmed the error, but chose to leave it that way to avoid confusion.

==History==

Soca began its development in the early 1970s and grew in popularity throughout that decade. Soca&#x27;s development as a musical genre included its fusion with calypso, kaiso, chutney, reggae, zouk, Latin, cadence, and traditional West African rhythms.

A sound project started in 1970 at KH Studios in Trinidad to find a way to record the complex calypso rhythm in a new multi-track recording era. Musicians involved in the initiative were Robin Imamshah (guitar, project lead), Angus Nunez (bass), Errol Wise (drums), Vonrick Maynard (drums), Clarence James (percussion), Carl Henderson (keyboards) and David Boothman (strings). 

Some of the early songs recorded in 1972 at the KH Studios which benefited from this project were &quot;Indrani&quot; by Lord Shorty and &quot;Calypso Zest&quot; by Sensational Roots. Later came the soca hits &quot;Endless Vibrations&quot; and &quot;Sweet Music&quot; by Lord Shorty, recorded in 1974 and 1975 respectively, and &quot;Second Fiddle&quot; by Ella Andall, recorded in 1975. In 1976, &quot;Savage&quot; by Maestro and &quot;Trinidad Boogie&quot; by Last Supper (composed by Robin Imamshah) also benefited from the improving multi-track recording technology at KH Studios.

Soca continues to incorporate contemporary music styles and trends. Bollywood films, bhangra, the new Punjabi pop, and disco music in the United States have also experimented with soca.

===Lord Shorty===
The &quot;father&quot; of soca was a Trinidadian named Garfield Blackman, who rose to fame as Lord Shorty with his 1964 hit &quot;Cloak and Dagger&quot;. He adopted the name &quot;Ras Shorty I&quot; in the early 1980s. He started out writing songs and performing in the calypso genre. A prolific musician, composer and innovator, Shorty experimented with fusing calypso and elements of Indo-Caribbean music after 1965, before debuting &quot;the Soul of Calypso&quot; (or &quot;soca&quot;) music in the early 1970s.

Shorty was the first to define his music as &quot;soca&quot; during 1975 when his hit song &quot;Endless Vibrations&quot; caused musical waves on radio stations and at parties and clubs - not just in his native Trinidad and Tobago, but also in cities like New York, Toronto and London. Soca was originally spelled &quot;sokah&quot;, with the &quot;kah&quot; part being the first letter in the Sanskrit alphabet, and representing the power of movement as well as the East Indian rhythmic influence that helped to inspire the new beat. Shorty stated in a number of interviews that the idea for the new soca beat originated with the fusion of calypso with East Indian rhythms that he used in his 1972 hit &quot;Indrani&quot;. Soca solidified its position as the popular new beat adopted by most Trinidadian calypso musicians by the time Shorty recorded his crossover hit &quot;Endless Vibrations&quot; in 1974.

In 1975, Shorty recorded an album entitled &quot;Love in the Caribbean&quot; that contained a number of crossover soca tracks. During the subsequent promotional tour, Shorty stopped at the isle of Dominica and saw the top band there, Exile One, perform at the Fort Young Hotel. Shorty was inspired to compose and record a soca and cadence-lypso fusion track titled &quot;E Pete&quot; or &quot;Ou Petit&quot;, which was the first in that particular soca style. Shorty consulted on the Creole lyrics he used in the chorus of his &quot;E Pete&quot; song with Dominica&#x27;s 1969 Calypso King, Lord Tokyo, and two Creole lyricists, Chris Seraphine and Pat Aaron.

==French Creole impact on soca==
The main source of soca is calypso developed in Trinidad in the 18th and 19th centuries from the West African kaiso and canboulay music brought by enslaved Africans and Immigrants from the French Antilles to Trinidad to work on sugar plantations after the Cedula of Population of 1783. The Africans brought to toil on sugar plantations, were stripped of many connections to their homeland and family. They used calypso to mock the slave masters and to communicate with each other. Many early calypsos were sung in French Creole by an individual called a griot. As calypso developed, the role of the griot became known as a &quot;chantuelle&quot; and eventually, &quot;calypsonian&quot;.

Modern calypso, however, began in the 19th century, a fusion of disparate elements ranging from the masquerade song &quot;lavway&quot;, French Creole &quot;belair&quot; and the calinda stick-fighting chantwell. Calypso&#x27;s early rise was closely connected with the adoption of Carnival by Trinidadian slaves, including canboulay drumming and the music masquerade processions. The French brought Carnival to Trinidad, and calypso competitions at Carnival grew in popularity, especially after the abolition of slavery in 1834.

Cadence-lypso is a fusion of cadence rampa from Haiti and calypso from Trinidad &amp; Tobago that has also spread to other English speaking countries of the Caribbean. Originated in the 1970s by the Dominican band Exile One on the island of Guadeloupe, it spread and became popular in the dance clubs around the Creole world and Africa as well as the French Antilles.

In the French Antilles, cadence-lypso evolved into zouk as popularized by Kassav in the 1980s. Kassav&#x27; was formed in 1979 by Pierre-Edouard Décimus (former musicians from the Les Vikings de Guadeloupe) and Paris studio musician Jacob Desvarieux. Together and under the influence of well-known Dominican, Haitian and Guadeloupean kadans or compas bands like Experience 7, Grammacks, Exile One, Les Aiglons, Tabou Combo, Les Freres Dejean, etc., they decided to make Guadeloupean carnival music recording it in a more fully orchestrated yet modern and polished style. This style of music had an impact on a certain style of soca known as &quot;zouk soca&quot;, mostly produced in St. Lucia.

The nineties in Dominica was dominated by a new musical form called bouyon music. The best-known band in the genre is Windward Caribbean Kulture (WCK), who originated the style in 1988 by experimenting with a fusion of cadence-lypso and jing ping. They began using native drum rhythms such as lapo kabwit and elements of the music of jing ping bands, as well as ragga-style vocals.

Bouyon influenced a certain style of soca known as bouyon soca. Bouyon soca typically blends old bouyon music rhythms from the &#x27;90s and soca music creating a unique style soca sound. The style of music was made more popular to the Caribbean region by the likes of the producer Dada and artists ASA from Dominica with collaborations from Trinidadian and St. Vincentian artists such as Skinny Fabulous, Bunji Garlin, Iwer George and Machel Montano. Hit songs featuring bouyon flavored rhythms and sounds and familiar soca attributes include &quot;Famalay&quot; and &quot;Conch Shell&quot;.

==Related genres==
Soca music has evolved like most other music genres over the years, with calypsonians, soca artists, musicians and producers also experimenting with fusing soca with other Caribbean rhythms. Examples include:

=== Afrosoca ===

Afrosoca is a fusion genre of afrobeats and soca music and some influences from dancehall. Afrosoca songs typically have a similar tempo to Groovy Soca (110 to 135 BPM), often with West African-influenced melodies. The genre was pioneered in Trinidad &amp; Tobago by Nigerian and Trinidadian artists.

===Chutney soca===

Chutney soca is one of the original soca styles started by Lord Shorty that contains strong East Indian musical influences; It is a soca style that originates in Trinidad and Tobago; many of the songs have both English and &quot;Hindi&quot; lyrics. The term Chutney soca was coined by the Indo-Trini artist, Drupatee Ramgoonai in 1987 when she recorded a hit song called &quot;Chatnee Soca&quot;. Soon after 1987 the spelling was changed to Chutney Soca. Before 1987 this fusion style was sometimes referred to as Indo Soca or Indian Soca. The term Chutney that is now being used to refer to Indo-Caribbean music did not come into popular use until after 1987 when many Indo-Trinis started to abbreviate the term &quot;Chutney soca&quot; to &quot;Chutney&quot; in reference to those Chutney soca songs that were sung only in the Hindi language.

===Ragga soca===
Ragga soca is a fusion of soca and the former artistic lyrical delivery of Jamaican artists known as &quot;DJing or chanting&quot;. It is a fusion of dancehall and contemporary calypso/soca, which has an uptempo beat with moderate bass and electronic instruments. Bunji Garlin is one of the artists that has sung ragga soca in Trinidad and Tobago since the late 1990s and has been dubbed the King of Ragga Soca. &quot;Dancehall soca&quot; and &quot;bashment soca&quot; are other terms used to refer to &quot;ragga soca&quot; music and these other terms are sometimes used depending on the artists and Caribbean country they hail from, with &quot;bashment soca&quot; being used for the Barbadian contribution to the genre while the Jamaican artists usually refer to their contributions as &quot;dancehall soca&quot;.

===Parang soca===
Parang soca or soca parang is a fusion of calypso, soca, parang and Latin music. It originated in Trinidad &amp; Tobago and is often sung in a mixture of English and Spanish. The first major parang soca hit was a track called &quot;Parang Soca&quot; by the Calypsonian called Crazy for the 1978 Christmas season that also gave this soca sub-genre its name. Crazy is viewed as the pioneer of the parang soca sub-genre and is also dubbed the Original Parang Soca King.

===Steelband soca===

Steelband soca or Pan soca also referred to in Trinidad &amp; Tobago as Pan Kaiso is soca composed for or using steel pans which are types of music drums often used in soca and calypso music; it became so popular that it became its own musical genre. This soca style was mostly pioneered by the late Lord Kitchener whose songs have been played by steel bands at T&amp;T&#x27;s annual Panorama competitions more than the songs of any other composer. The steel pan originated in the Republic of Trinidad and Tobago during the late 1930s. Steel pans are handmade, bowl-like metal drums crafted from oil drums so that different drum sections produce different notes when struck. Steelbands are groups of musicians who play songs entirely on steel drums. There are many types of steel pans, each with its own set of pitches.

===Groovy soca===
Though most of the early soca recordings of the 1970s were done at a groovy pace, Groovy soca was made popular as a trend and soca style starting with Robin Imamshah&#x27;s composition &quot;Frenchman&quot; in 1990.

The term groovy soca was coined in early 2005 by the ISM organizers as a re-branding of the slower tempo soca styles that had been popular in Trinidad and Tobago since the inception of soca music in early 1970s.

===Bouyon soca===

Bouyon soca, sometimes referred to as &quot;jump up soca&quot;, is a fusion genre that typically blends old bouyon rhythms from the &#x27;90s and soca music. Bouyon soca is a term coined by non-Dominican producers and musicians, mainly from St Lucia, who embrace both Soca from Trinidad and Bouyon music from Dominica and so find it natural to produce blends of both music genres. Bouyon is a music genre that originated in Dominica that is distinguishable from its older &quot;colleague&quot; Soca.

In Dominica while there may have been the occasional fusions, bouyon has always maintained a very clear, recognizable and different style from soca. Outside of Dominica the Bouyon Soca fusion style is popular in islands like Antigua, Saint Lucia, Guadeloupe and Martinique and is a natural evolution from Zouk and Soca fusions that were popular there during the 1980s.

===Dennery segment===
Dennery segment is a style of Soca music developed in Saint Lucia in the early 2010s. It emerged from Kuduro, incorporating Zouk influence and Lucian drums alongside suggestive lyrics usually sung in Kwéyòl (Saint Lucian Creole). Originally known as Lucian kuduro, it was changed to Dennery segment to reference the town Dennery where the genre began.

Originally just singing over existing kuduro beats, artists began to build their own rhythms from scratch and that&#x27;s what created the foundation of the genre. Dennery segment beats have a simple build, aggressive drums, and are always above 140 BPM. The style is also different from other soca because it is less melodic and more repetitive, usually only having one lead instrument that carries the entire beat.

In the late 2010s, Dennery segment artists such as Freezy, Mighty, and Motto incorporated more English into their lyrics and that led to a boom in popularity throughout the Caribbean and raised the genre&#x27;s international profile. Artists in this first wave from Saint Lucia began collaborating with artists from off the island, and they played at festivals throughout the Caribbean.

===Power soca===
The term &quot;power soca&quot; was coined in early 2005 by the ISM organizers as a re-branding of the uptempo jump &amp; wave soca style that took hold in Trinidad and Tobago during the early 1990s. This fast-paced version of Soca music tends to appeal more to the younger generation of party-goers and those who love working out in the gyms getting fit for the Carnival season and playing mas. Calypsonian and soca artist Superblue pioneered this style with his 1991 hit &quot;Get Something &amp; Wave&quot;. Power soca of today is known for its high bpm (ranging from 155–163) and its aggressive drums/percussion and dark synths. Today, it has transcended from its original sound of darkness into a more light and playful sound but has kept its foundation of fast-paced rhythms.

==Instrumentation==
Soca music is based on a strong rhythmic section that is often recorded using synthesized drum sounds and then sequenced using computers; however, for live shows, the live human drummer emulates the recorded version, often using electronic drums to trigger drum samples. The drum and percussion are often loud in this genre of music and are sometimes the only instruments to back up the vocal. Soca is indeed defined by its loud, fast percussive beats. Synthesizers are used often in modern soca and have replaced the once typical horn section at &#x27;smaller&#x27; shows. Electric and bass guitars are typical components of a live soca bands. A horn section is found occasionally in live soca bands mostly for the &#x27;bigger&#x27; shows. It usually consists of two trumpets and a trombone, with saxophones being part of the section from time to time. Other metal instruments may include cowbell or automobile brake drums.

== Brooklyn soca ==
From the mid-1970s through the early 1990s, Brooklyn, NY, in the United States, became a center for soca music production. The borough, home to a large and diverse West Indian population, boasted three important Caribbean immigrant-owned record companies: Straker&#x27;s Records (owned by Granville Straker), Charlie&#x27;s Records (owned by Rawlston Charles), and B&#x27;s Records (owned by Michael Gould). Nearly every important calypsonian/soca singer of the era recorded on one or more of these Brooklyn labels, resulting in a significant expansion of the music&#x27;s international reach. Taking advantage of New York&#x27;s advanced recording and mixing facilities, several top calypsonians turned soca singers, including the Mighty Sparrow, Calypso Rose, and the Mighty Duke, relocated to the city. Others, including Chalkdust, Lord Kitchener, Explainer, Swallow, and Shadow, cycled between the Caribbean and Brooklyn to record and perform.

==In media==
Soca music videos are played on several television channels including CaribVision, Centric, Synergy TV, and Tempo TV. The theme tune to the UK comedy show Desmond&#x27;s was in a soca style.

In 2014 the Apple&#x27;s iTunes Store became the largest online store to recognize calypso and soca as two of its formal catalog genres.

<text>The Central Intercollegiate Athletic Association (originally and through 1950 known as the Colored Intercollegiate Athletic Association — CIAA) is a college athletic conference affiliated with the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) at the Division II level, whose member institutions consist entirely of historically black colleges and universities (HBCUs).

The thirteen member institutions reside primarily along the central portion of the East Coast of the United States, in the states of Pennsylvania, Maryland, West Virginia, Virginia, North Carolina and South Carolina. Since a majority of the members are in North Carolina, the CIAA moved its headquarters to Charlotte, North Carolina from Hampton, Virginia in August 2015.

The CIAA sponsors 14 annual championships and divides into north and south divisions for some sports. The most notable CIAA sponsored championship is the CIAA Basketball Tournament having become one of the largest college basketball events in the nation.

==History==
The CIAA, founded on the campus of Hampton Institute (now Hampton University) in 1912, is the oldest African-American athletic conference in the United States. It was originally known as the Colored Intercollegiate Athletic Association and adopted its current name in December 1950. The conference composes predominantly of historically black colleges and universities (HBCUs) spanning the east coast from Pennsylvania to South Carolina.

Founding leaders were Allen Washington and Charles H. Williams of Hampton Institute (now Hampton University); Ernest J. Marshall of Howard University; George Johnson of Lincoln University (PA); W. E. Atkins, Charles Frazier, and H. P. Hargrave of Shaw University; and J. W. Barco and J. W. Pierce of Virginia Union University.

Football experiences a major resurgence after going through a period of decline at several member universities. Football was absent from the campus of Saint Augustine&#x27;s University for nearly three decades, before the administration reinstated it in 2002. Shaw University then brought back its football program in 2003, following a hiatus of 24 years.

Lincoln University, a charter member, added varsity football in 2008 and was readmitted to the CIAA after nearly three decades in Division III. Chowan University joined the CIAA in 2008 for football only. On October 14, 2008, the CIAA Board of Directors admitted Chowan as a full member effective July 1, 2009, the first non-HBCU to play in the conference.

On August 27, 2012, the CIAA announced the appointment of Jacqie Carpenter, the first African-American female commissioner to hold the position.

In 2014, a collection of records, including the original 1912 documents leading to the formation of the CIAA and meeting minutes from 1913 to 1922, were sold at auction after being discovered in a storage locker. The lot sold for $11,500 to an unnamed bidder.

On May 22, 2018, Chowan University announced its athletic department will realign with the Conference Carolinas as a full member while maintaining an associate relationship with the CIAA for both football and women&#x27;s bowling.

On October 4, 2024, the CIAA suspended St. Augustine&#x27;s membership within the conference for the 2024–25 academic year, citing failure to meet conference compliance requirements and concerns surrounding its ability to meet NCAA sports sponsorship and scheduling requirements. The suspension was extended indefinitely at the CIAA&#x27;s 2024 Fall Board meeting on December 10.

==CIAA Basketball Tournament==
The CIAA is the first NCAA Division II conference to have its tournament televised as part of Championship Week on ESPN. Over 100,000 fans and spectators are in attendance annually and it has become one of the largest college basketball events in the nation. During the week of the tournament, there are many high-profile social and celebratory events associated with the event. The last day of the tournament is known as &quot;Super Saturday&quot; in which the men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s tournament champions are crowned. For 15 years, the tournament had an annual $55 million economic impact on Charlotte, North Carolina and was consistently the largest event held in the city every year. The conference was offered better incentives to move it to Baltimore, Maryland, in 2021, where it will remain at least through 2025.

==CIAA cheerleading==
One of the signature events of &quot;Super Saturday&quot; at the CIAA Basketball Tournament is the Cheer Exhibition. At the exhibition, CIAA cheer squads showcase elaborate routines to entertain spectators and display their talents. Every cheerleading team in the CIAA is a &quot;Stomp-N-Shake&quot; squad which is a unique style of cheer that is most common among historically Black colleges and schools located in the East Coast region.

The CIAA is one of the only conferences in the country that has an annual All-Conference Cheerleading Team. The All-Conference Cheerleading Team is a recognition bestowed on select cheerleaders in the conference that exemplify the epitome of school spirit, leadership, athleticism, and academic excellence.

<doc id="79629" wikidata="Q621672" url="?curid=79629" title="Pontus (region)">
<text>Pontus or Pontos (; ,) is a region on the southern coast of the Black Sea, located in the modern-day eastern Black Sea Region of Turkey. The name was applied to the coastal region and its mountainous hinterland (rising to the Pontic Alps in the east) by the Greeks who colonized the area in the Archaic period and derived from the Greek name of the Black Sea: &quot;(&quot;&quot;)&quot;, &quot;Hospitable Sea&quot;, or simply &quot;Pontos&quot; () as early as the Aeschylean &quot;Persians&quot; (472 BC) and Herodotus&#x27; &quot;Histories&quot; (circa 440 BC).

Having originally no specific name, the region east of the river Halys was spoken of as the country &quot;()&quot;, , and hence it acquired the name of Pontus, which is first found in Xenophon&#x27;s &quot;Anabasis&quot; (). The extent of the region varied through the ages but generally extended from the borders of Colchis (modern western Georgia) until well into Paphlagonia in the west, with varying amounts of hinterland. Several states and provinces bearing the name of Pontus or variants thereof were established in the region in the Hellenistic, Roman and Byzantine periods, culminating in the late Byzantine Empire of Trebizond. Pontus is sometimes considered as the original home of the Amazons, in ancient Greek mythology and historiography (e. g. by Herodotus and Strabo).

==History==
===Early inhabitants===
Pontus remained outside the reach of the Bronze Age empires, of which the closest was Great Hatti. The region went further uncontrolled by Hatti&#x27;s eastern neighbors, Hurrian states like Azzi and (or) Hayasa. In those days, the best any outsider could hope from this region was temporary alliance with a local strongman. The Hittites called the unorganized groups on their northeastern frontier the Kaška. As of 2004 little had been found of them archaeologically.

In the wake of the Hittite empire&#x27;s collapse, the Assyrian court noted that the &quot;Kašku&quot; had overrun its territory in conjunction with a hitherto unknown group whom they labeled the Muški. Iron Age visitors to the region, mostly Greek, noted that the hinterlands remained disunited, and they recorded the names of tribes: Moskhians (often associated with those Muški), Leucosyri, Mares, Makrones, Mossynoikoi, Tibarenoi, Tzans and Chalybes or Chaldoi.

The Armenian language went unnoted by the Hittites, the Assyrians, and all the post-Hittite nations; an ancient theory – first conjectured by Herodotus – is that its speakers migrated from Phrygia, past literary notice, across Pontus during the early Iron Age. The Greeks, who spoke a closely related Indo-European tongue, followed them along the coast. The Greeks are the earliest long-term inhabitants of the region from whom written records survive. During the late 8th century BC, Pontus further became a base for the Cimmerians, another Indo-European speaking people; however, these were defeated by the Lydians, and became a distant memory after the campaigns of Alyattes.

Since there was so little literacy in northeastern Anatolia until the Persian and Hellenistic era, one can only speculate as to the other languages spoken here. Given that Kartvelian languages remain spoken to the east of Pontus, some are suspected to have been spoken in eastern Pontus during the Iron Age: the Tzans are usually associated with today&#x27;s Laz.
===Ancient Greek colonization===


The first travels of Greek merchants and adventurers to the Pontus region occurred probably from around 1000 BC, whereas their settlements would become steady and solidified cities only by the 8th and 7th centuries BC as archaeological findings document. This fits in well with a foundation date of 731 BC as reported by Eusebius of Caesarea for Sinope, perhaps the most ancient of the Greek colonies in what was later to be called Pontus. The epical narratives related to the travels of Jason and the Argonauts to Colchis, the tales of Heracles&#x27; navigating the Black Sea, and Odysseus&#x27; wanderings into the land of the Cimmerians, as well as the myth of Zeus constraining Prometheus to the Caucasus mountains as a punishment for his outwitting the Gods, can all be seen as reflections of early contacts between early Greek colonists and the local, probably Caucasian, peoples. The earliest known written description of Pontus, however, is that of Scylax of Korianda, who in the 7th century BC described Greek settlements in the area.

===Persian Empire expansion===
By the 6th century BC, Pontus had become officially a part of the Achaemenid Empire, which probably meant that the local Greek colonies were paying tribute to the Persians. When the Athenian commander Xenophon passed through Pontus around a century later in 401-400 BC, in fact, he found no Persians in Pontus.

The peoples of this part of northern Asia Minor were incorporated into the third and nineteenth satrapies of the Persian empire. Iranian influence ran deep, illustrated most famously by the temple of the Persian deities Anaitis, Omanes, and Anadatos at Zela, founded by victorious Persian generals in the 6th century BC.

===Kingdom of Pontus===
The Kingdom of Pontus extended generally to the east of the Halys River. The Persian dynasty which was to found this kingdom had during the 4th century BC ruled the Greek city of Cius (or Kios) in Mysia, with its first known member being Ariobarzanes I of Cius and the last ruler based in the city being Mithridates II of Cius. Mithridates II&#x27;s son, also called Mithridates, would proclaim himself later Mithridates I Ktistes of Pontus.

As the &quot;Encyclopaedia Iranica&quot; states, the most famous member of the family, Mithradates VI Eupator, although undoubtedly presenting himself to the Greek world as a civilized philhellene and new Alexander, also paraded his Iranian background: he maintained a harem and eunuchs in true Oriental fashion; he gave all his sons Persian names; he sacrificed spectacularly in the manner of the Persian kings at Pasargadae (Appian, Mith. 66, 70); and he appointed “satraps” (a Persian title) as his provincial governors. Iranica further states, and although there is only one inscription attesting it, he seems to have adopted the title “king of kings.” The very small number of Hellenistic Greek inscriptions that have been found anywhere in Pontus suggest that Greek culture did not substantially penetrate beyond the coastal cities and the court.

During the troubled period following the death of Alexander the Great, Mithridates Ktistes was for a time in the service of Antigonus, one of Alexander&#x27;s successors, and successfully maneuvering in this unsettled time managed, shortly after 302 BC, to create the Kingdom of Pontus which would be ruled by his descendants mostly bearing the same name, until 64 BC. Thus, this Persian dynasty managed to survive and prosper in the Hellenistic world while the main Persian Empire had fallen.

This kingdom reached its greatest height under Mithridates VI or Mithridates Eupator, commonly called the Great, who for many years carried on war with the Romans. Under him, the realm of Pontus included not only Pontic Cappadocia but also the seaboard from the Bithynian frontier to Colchis, part of inland Paphlagonia, and Lesser Armenia. Despite ruling Lesser Armenia, King Mithridates VI was an ally of Armenian King Tigranes the Great, to whom he married his daughter Cleopatra. Eventually, however, the Romans defeated both King Mithridates VI and his son-in-law, Armenian King Tigranes the Great, during the Mithridatic Wars, bringing Pontus under Roman rule.

===Roman province===
With the subjugation of this kingdom by Pompey in 64 BC, little changed in the daily lives of either the oligarchies that controlled the cities or for the common people there and in the hinterland, though the meaning of the name Pontus underwent a change. Part of the kingdom was now annexed to the Roman Empire, being united with Bithynia in a double province called Pontus and Bithynia: this part included only the seaboard between Heraclea (today Ereğli) and Amisus (Samsun), the &quot;ora Pontica&quot;. The larger part of Pontus, however, was included in the province of Galatia.

Hereafter the simple name Pontus without qualification was regularly employed to denote the half of this dual province, especially by Romans and people speaking from the Roman point of view; it is so used almost always in the New Testament. The eastern half of the old kingdom was administered as a client kingdom together with Colchis. Its last king was Polemon II.

In AD 62, the country was constituted by Nero a Roman province. It was divided into the three districts: Pontus Galaticus in the west, bordering on Galatia; Pontus Polemoniacus in the centre, so called from its capital Polemonium; and Pontus Cappadocicus in the east, bordering on Cappadocia (Armenia Minor). Subsequently, the Roman Emperor Trajan moved Pontus into the province of Cappadocia itself in the early 2nd century AD. In response to a Gothic raid on Trebizond in 287 AD, the Roman Emperor Diocletian decided to break up the area into smaller provinces under more localized administration.

With the reorganization of the provincial system under Diocletian (about AD 295), the Pontic districts were divided up between three smaller, independent provinces within the Dioecesis Pontica:

*Galatian Pontus, also called Diospontus, later renamed Helenopontus by Constantine the Great after his mother. It had its capital at Amisus, and included the cities of Sinope, Amasia, Andres, Ibora, and Zela as well.
*Pontus Polemoniacus, with its capital at Polemonium (also called Side), and including the cities of Neocaesarea, Argyroupolis, Comana, and Cerasus as well.
*Cappadocian Pontus, with its capital at Trebizond, and including the small ports of Athanae and Rhizaeon. This province extended all the way to Colchis.

===Byzantine province and theme===
The Byzantine Emperor Justinian further reorganized the area in 536:

*Pontus Polemoniacus was dissolved, with the western part (Polemonium and Neocaesarea) going to Helenopontus, Comana going to the new province of Armenia II, and the rest (Trebizond and Cerasus) joining the new province of Armenia I Magna with its capital at Justinianopolis.
*Helenopontus gained Polemonium and Neocaesarea, and lost Zela to Armenia II. The provincial governor was relegated to the rank of &quot;moderator&quot;.
*Paphlagonia absorbed Honorias and was put under a praetor.

By the time of the early Byzantine Empire, Trebizond became a center of culture and scientific learning. In the 7th century, an individual named Tychicus returned from Constantinople to establish a school of learning. One of his students was the early Armenian scholar Anania of Shirak.

Under the Byzantine Empire, the Pontus came under the Armeniac Theme, with the westernmost parts (Paphlagonia) belonging to the Bucellarian Theme. Progressively, these large early themes were divided into smaller ones, so that by the late 10th century, the Pontus was divided into the themes of Chaldia, which was governed by the Gabrades family, and Koloneia. After the 8th century, the area experienced a period of prosperity, which was brought to an end only by the Seljuk conquest of Asia Minor in the 1070s and 1080s. Restored to the Byzantine Empire by Alexios I Komnenos, the area was governed by effectively semi-autonomous rulers, like the Gabras family of Trebizond.

The region was secured militarily from the 11th through the 15th centuries with a vast network of sophisticated coastal fortresses.

===Empire of Trebizond===
Following Constantinople&#x27;s loss of sovereignty to the Fourth Crusade in 1204, the Pontus retained independence as the Empire of Trebizond under the Komnenos dynasty. Through a combination of geographic remoteness and adroit diplomacy, this remnant managed to survive, until it was conquered by the Ottomans in 1461 after the Fall of Constantinople itself. This political adroitness included becoming a vassal state at various times to both Georgia and to various inland Turkic rulers. In addition, the Empire of Trebizond became a renowned center of culture under its ruling Komnenos dynasty.

===Ottoman &quot;vilayet&quot;===


Under the subsequent Ottoman rule which began with the fall of Trebizond, particularly starting from the 17th century, some of the region&#x27;s Pontic Greeks became Muslim through the Devşirme system. But at the same time some valleys inhabited by Greeks converted voluntarily, most notably those in the Of valley. Large communities (around 25% of the population) of Christian Pontic Greeks remained throughout the area (including Trabezon and Kars in northeastern Turkey/the Russian Caucasus) until the 1920s, and in parts of Georgia and Armenia until the 1990s, preserving their own customs and dialect of Greek. One group of Islamicized Greeks were called the Kromli, but were suspected of secretly having remained Christians. They numbered between 12,000 and 15,000 and lived in villages including Krom, Imera, Livadia, Prdi, Alitinos, Mokhora, and Ligosti. Many of the Islamized Greeks continued speaking their language, known for its unique preservation of characteristics of Ancient Greek and still today there are some in the Of valley that speak the local Ophitic dialect.

===Republic of Pontus===
The Republic of Pontus () was a proposed Pontic Greek state on the southern coast of the Black Sea. Its territory would have encompassed much of historical Pontus and today forms part of Turkey&#x27;s Black Sea Region. The proposed state was discussed at the Paris Peace Conference of 1919, but the Greek government of Eleftherios Venizelos feared the precarious position of such a state and so it was included instead in the larger proposed state of Wilsonian Armenia. Neither state came into existence and the Pontic Greek population was subjected to genocide and expelled from Turkey after 1922 and resettled in the Soviet Union or in Macedonia. This state of affairs was later formally recognized as part of the population exchange between Greece and Turkey in 1923.

===Present===


The Black Sea Region (), comprising all or parts of 22 provinces, is one of Turkey&#x27;s seven census-defined geographical regions. It encompasses but is larger than historic Pontus.

==Religion==
Mentioned thrice in the New Testament, inhabitants of Pontus were some of the first converts to Christianity. mentions them present in Jerusalem on the Day of Pentecost; Acts 18:2 mentions a Jewish tentmaker from Pontus, Aquila, who was then living in Corinth with his wife Priscilla, who had both converted to Christianity, and in , Peter the Apostle addresses the Pontians in his letter as the &quot;elect&quot; and &quot;chosen ones&quot;.

As early as the First Council of Nicea, Trebizond had its own bishop. Subsequently, the Bishop of Trebizond was subordinated to the Metropolitan Bishop of Poti. Then during the 9th century, Trebizond itself became the seat of the Metropolitan Bishop of Lazica.

Originally known as the Mid-South Athletic Conference or Mid-South Conference, the Gulf South Conference was formed by six universities in the summer of 1970: Delta State, Florence State (now North Alabama), Jacksonville State, Livingston (now West Alabama), Tennessee–Martin, and Troy State (now Troy). Scheduling problems for the 1970–71 academic year limited the league to football, won by Jacksonville State.

In 1971, the league changed its name to the Gulf South Conference; added Southeastern Louisiana (SLU) and Nicholls State (increasing the membership to eight); opened an office in Hammond, Louisiana; and began championships in all men&#x27;s sports. The following year, Mississippi College and Northwestern Louisiana (NWLA, now Northwestern State) were admitted. NWLA withdrew to go Division I two years later, followed by SLU and Nicholls State in 1979.

The conference continued with seven teams until 1981, when the presidents admitted Valdosta State. West Georgia joined in 1983. Eight years of stability ended in 1991 when Tennessee–Martin and Troy State went Division I, briefly dropping the GSC back to seven members, before the beginning of an expansion resulting in ten new members: Lincoln Memorial (1992–93); Alabama–Huntsville, Henderson State, Central Arkansas, and Mississippi University for Women (MUW) (1993–94); West Florida (1994–95); and Arkansas-Monticello, Arkansas Tech, Montevallo, and Southern Arkansas (1995–96). Jacksonville State went Division I at the end of 1992–93. Mississippi College dropped to Division III at the end of 1995–96 and was replaced by Christian Brothers to keep the Conference at 16 schools. In July 2000, the GSC welcomed Harding University and Ouachita Baptist University, making it the largest NCAA conference at any level with 18 schools. The Conference membership decreased to 17 when MUW dropped its athletics program at the end of the 2002–03 season.

2006–07 was another season of change for the GSC. Central Arkansas moved to Division I, leaving the West Division with eight schools while Lincoln Memorial left for the South Atlantic Conference due to travel and location issues, leaving the East Division with seven schools.

Montevallo announced on June 27, 2008 that they would be leaving for the Peach Belt Conference following the 2008–09 season due to issues between the University&#x27;s President and the Commissioner.

The GSC moved away from divisional play after the 2010-11 season after its six Arkansas members broke away, dropping the membership to eight. Thanks to an aggressive expansion plan, the GSC sponsored the Division II applications of Union University (TN) and Shorter University (GA), which became official members in 2014-15. The next step in bolstering its membership came in 2012, backing the Division II application of Lee University (TN) which was on track to join the league officially in 2015-16. The league added its first-ever associate member, Florida Tech, in football only in 2013. The Conference planned to add an old friend back into the fold when Mississippi College submitted its application to rejoin Division II and was on track for 2016-17 membership.

Former Commissioner Jim McCullough brought the GSC office to Birmingham when he was hired in 1979. The conference welcomed its seventh commissioner in May 2014 when Matt Wilson was selected to follow Nate Salant who retired after a 22-year stint.

===2010s realignment===
Beginning with the 2011–12 academic year; Arkansas Tech University, University of Arkansas at Monticello, Harding University, Henderson State University, Ouachita Baptist University, and Southern Arkansas University left the GSC to form the Great American Conference.

The University of New Orleans, which was transitioning from Division I to Division II, was accepted into the conference in June 2011, but the school announced intentions to stay at Division I in March 2012. In July 2011, Shorter University and Union University (Jackson, Tenn.) were accepted into the NCAA and began the multi-year transition process from the NAIA to NCAA. Both universities began GSC competition in the 2012–13 academic year but will not be eligible for NCAA national tournaments until the 2014–15 academic year. In August 2011, the GSC added the Florida Institute of Technology as an associate member for football beginning in the 2013 season.

On October 11, 2012, Mississippi College announced that it would petition the NCAA to leave Division III and return to the conference. The transition was a lengthy process; Mississippi College officially became a Division II candidate starting with the 2013–14 academic year, with the school becoming a full Division II member for 2016–17.

In 2013, Lee University joined the GSC, bringing the membership to 11. Lee University moved to Division II provisional membership for the 2014-15 season. They will complete transition to Division II in the 2015-16 season. Mississippi College entered its second candidacy year with the 2014-15 season in its path to full Division II membership in 2016-17 and added Gulf South Conference teams to its schedule.

The next change to the conference&#x27;s membership was officially announced on December 6, 2016 when North Alabama was accepted to the ASUN Conference and would begin a transition to Division I sports in 2018. In May 2020, affiliate member Florida Tech announced the discontinuation of their football program due to the financial fallout of the COVID-19 pandemic.

<text>The Lone Star Conference (LSC) is a college athletic conference affiliated with the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) at the Division II level. Member institutions are located in the South Central states, with schools in Texas, Oklahoma, and New Mexico, with two members in the Pacific Northwest states of Oregon and Washington competing as affiliates for football only.

The Lone Star Conference operates from the same headquarters complex in the Dallas suburb of Richardson as the American Southwest Conference.

==History==
The conference was formed in 1931 when five schools withdrew from the old Texas Intercollegiate Athletic Association. Charter members included East Texas State (now East Texas A&amp;M), North Texas State (now University of North Texas), Sam Houston State, Southwest Texas State (now Texas State), and Stephen F. Austin. With East Texas A&amp;M (then named Texas A&amp;M–Commerce) starting its transition to Division I in July 2022, none of the five charter members remain in Division II or in the conference – all have moved up to Division I (in football as of 2024, North Texas, Sam Houston, and Texas State compete in NCAA Division I FBS, while Stephen F. Austin and East Texas A&amp;M compete in NCAA Division I FCS).

===Chronological timeline===

Austin State College (now Stephen F. Austin State University). The conference constitution required member schools to sponsor football, basketball, track &amp; field and tennis.

* 1991 - On June 1, 1991, at the LSC Council of Presidents meeting, Angelo State president Dr. Drew Vincent said, &quot;there is a survival issue in the conference that has nothing to do with finances which was that the conference needed to be enlarged. East Central University, Southwestern Oklahoma State University, and Northeastern State University might be interested in joining, as well as Tarleton State University and Midwestern State University.
* 1991 - On November 25, 1991, the LSC Directors of Athletics requested Central Oklahoma&#x27;s Skip Wagnon to invite representatives from Henderson State University, the University of Central Arkansas, Fort Hays State University, and Midwestern State University to a meeting on January 7, 1992, during the NCAA convention.

* 1995 - On January 8, 1995, at a joint meeting of the LSC Council of Presidents and the LSC Directors of Athletics at the NCAA convention in San Diego, a thorough discussion of conference expansion was held with the potential of developing two divisions of eight members each. The catalyst had been the fragmentation of NAIA Division I with member institutions moving to NCAA Division II. Discussion centered on universities in Oklahoma and Arkansas that had applied to NCAA Division II and the rationale for expansion. The consensus was that the LSC presidents should host a meeting of Oklahoma presidents to share information on expansion and to study the feasibility of developing a regional conference. A meeting would be set up in the next 60 days.
* 1995 - On August 29, 1995, on a conference call of the executive committee of the LSC Council of Presidents, a recommendation was approved to &quot;take a proactive position regarding expansion with the development of a regional conference with two divisions&quot;.
* 1995 - On September 28, 1995, the executive committee of the LSC Council of Presidents met with the presidents of Northeastern State University, Southeastern Oklahoma State University, the University of Central Arkansas, Harding University, and Ouachita Baptist University. Focus of discussion was that with expansion, a strategic long-range decision would be made to stabilize LSC membership, while providing flexibility for conference athletics programs in scheduling, postseason playoff competition, gender-equity guidelines, marketing potential, media coverage, NCAA legislative strength, enhancing the image of the conference, and economy of scale for the conference administration and services. Further, the downside to the proposed expansion/realignment was minimal.
* 1995 - On October 11, 1995, on a conference call of the LSC Council of Presidents, a recommendation was unanimously approved to extend invitations to Northeastern State University, Southeastern Oklahoma State University, the University of Central Arkansas, Harding University, and Ouachita Baptist University for LSC membership.

===Men&#x27;s sponsored sports by school===


===Women&#x27;s sponsored sports by school===


===Other sponsored sports by school===
;Notes:
In addition to the above:

* Arkansas–Fort Smith counts its male and female cheerleaders, plus its all-female dance team (called a &quot;pom squad&quot; on the school&#x27;s athletic website), as varsity athletes.
* Cameron counts its female cheerleaders (though not male cheerleaders) and all-female dance team as varsity athletes under the collective name of &quot;spirit team&quot;.
* Dallas Baptist fields a varsity team in the all-female cheerleading discipline of STUNT.
* Eastern New Mexico counts its female cheerleaders (though not male cheerleaders) and all-female dance team as varsity athletes under the collective name of &quot;spirit squad&quot;. The school also fields a coeducational rodeo team.
* Lubbock Christian counts its female cheerleaders (though not male cheerleaders) as varsity athletes.
* Oklahoma Christian fields a varsity team in the non-NCAA sport of men&#x27;s bowling.
* St. Edward&#x27;s counts its male and female cheerleaders as varsity athletes.
* UT Tyler counts its cheerleaders (male and female) and dance team (all-female) as varsity athletes under the collective name of &quot;spirit squad&quot;.

Only schools that explicitly list cheerleading and dance teams as men&#x27;s, women&#x27;s, or coed sports are counted in this listing. Some schools feature links to said teams on their athletics websites, but place them in a specific menu for &quot;spirit teams&quot; or a similar term.

==Facilities==
==Champions==
This is a list of conference champions since 1997.

===Men===

Note: (HC) denotes the Heartland Conference. In 2012–2013, the LSC stopped sponsoring Men&#x27;s soccer. In 2016, 4 schools (Eastern New Mexico, Midwestern State, UT-Permian Basin, and West Texas A&amp;M) joined the Heartland as affiliate members for Men&#x27;s soccer. When the Heartland folded, most schools became non-football members of the LSC.

===Women===
===Conference tournament champions===
===Division championships===
From 1997 to 2011, and 2020–present, the LSC has been divided into divisions. From 1997 to 2011, the split was north–south. Beginning in the 2019–2020 academic year, the LSC was split into three nameless divisions among the non-football sports: West Texas and New Mexico in the western division; South Texas, Central Texas, and DFW in the central division; East Texas, North Texas, Oklahoma, and Arkansas in the eastern division. The divisional split was temporarily discontinued for the 2021–2022 season; but divisions were reintroduced for basketball for the 2022-23 season under the names East and West.

2014-2015&lt;br&gt;
In the 2014 season, a conference playoff was added due to the small number of football programs in the conference. At the end of the season, the teams were guaranteed two more conference games in the Lone Star Conference playoffs, the teams were split into two separate brackets, the championship bracket (seeds 1–4) and the non-championship bracket (seeds 5–7). This format ended after the 2015 season due to the addition of Western New Mexico, UT Permian Basin, and Oklahoma Panhandle State.

<doc id="79636" wikidata="Q6840590" url="?curid=79636" title="Mid-America Intercollegiate Athletics Association">
<text>The Mid-America Intercollegiate Athletics Association (MIAA) is a college athletic conference affiliated with the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) at the Division II level, headquartered in Kansas City, Missouri. Its fourteen member institutions, of which all but one are public schools, are located in Arkansas, Kansas, Missouri, Nebraska, and Oklahoma. The MIAA is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization incorporated in Missouri.

Originally named the Missouri Intercollegiate Athletic Association, the conference was established in 1912 with 14 members, two of which are still current members. Six members (Central Methodist, Central Wesleyan, Culver-Stockton, Missouri Valley, Missouri Wesleyan, Tarkio College, Westminster, and William Jewell) were later removed from the conference in 1924 when it decided to only include the public schools. A majority of the charter members that left in 1924 have shut down their operations, or merged with another school. Over the next century, nearly twenty schools have joined and left the conference, with a few affiliate members. Some of those schools have reclassified to NCAA Division I.

The conference&#x27;s current 14-campus makeup resulted when Lincoln departed the conference while Arkansas-Fort Smith joined the league for the 2024-25 season.

The current MIAA commissioner is Mike Racy.

==History and overview==
The MIAA currently sponsors 20 sports – ten men&#x27;s and ten women&#x27;s. MIAA schools with additional sports compete independently or as part of a nearby conference. On July 1, 1992, the MIAA entered a new era when the conference changed its name from the Missouri Intercollegiate Athletic Association to the Mid-America Intercollegiate Athletics Association. The name change originated in 1989, when Pittsburg State University and Washburn University became the first schools outside the state of Missouri to gain membership in the MIAA.

===Founding and former members===
The MIAA was established in 1912 with 14 member institutions. It included the five state teachers colleges in Missouri – Warrensburg Teachers College (now the University of Central Missouri), Northeast Missouri State Teachers College (now Truman State University), Northwest Missouri State Teacher&#x27;s College (now Northwest Missouri State University), Southeast Missouri State Teacher&#x27;s College (now Southeast Missouri State University), and Southwest Missouri State Teacher&#x27;s College (now Missouri State University). It also included nine private schools – Central Methodist University, Central Wesleyan College, Culver–Stockton College, Drury University, Missouri Valley College, Missouri Wesleyan College, Tarkio College, Westminster College, and William Jewell College. Only Central Missouri and Northwest Missouri State remain members in the MIAA.

In 1924 the conference reorganized to include only public schools, and conference records tend to begin with that date. The schools left behind in the reorganization went on to later form the Missouri College Athletic Union, which would in time become the current Heart of America Athletic Conference in the NAIA.

===First expansions of the conference===
The Missouri School of Mines, later the University of Missouri-Rolla and now the Missouri University of Science &amp; Technology, joined in 1935 to bring membership to six schools. The membership remained at six until Lincoln University joined in 1970, followed by the University of Missouri-St. Louis in 1980.

===1980s===
Southwest Missouri State left the MIAA after the 1980–81 season to move on to NCAA Division I. In 1986, Southwest Baptist University brought the conference membership back to eight schools. In 1989, Pittsburg State, Washburn, Missouri Southern State College and Missouri Western State College – formerly members of the Central States Intercollegiate Conference – began competition in the 1989–90 season.

===1990s and 2000s===
Southeast Missouri State left the MIAA following the 1990–91 season to move on to NCAA Division I, and was replaced by Emporia State University in the 1991–92 season. Missouri-St. Louis left the MIAA in 1996, as did Missouri–Rolla in 2005. Lincoln forfeited membership in 1999.

Fort Hays State University joined the MIAA in 2006 and the University of Nebraska Omaha entered the league in 2008.

On July 3, 2007, Southwest Baptist was granted independent status for their football team, while all remaining teams will stay in the MIAA.

On July 8, 2009, the MIAA CEO Council voted to remain a 12-team league for the foreseeable future, denying an application by Rockhurst University (which does not have a football team but wanted to compete in other sports). The vote ended short term speculation about the League expanding to 16 teams divided into two divisions.

===2010s===
Lincoln rejoined the conference in 2010 and in that same year, the MIAA CEO Council voted to extend invitations to the University of Central Oklahoma and Northeastern State University to become members of the league beginning in 2012–13, as well as Lindenwood University and the University of Nebraska at Kearney. In 2012, the schools started to only play each other in football and play no non-conference games. At first, the teams that were closest geographically played each other every year and would rotate through the other conference members in other years. The move to expand the league was spurred at least in part after Northwest Missouri during its national championship game run had problems finding non-conference teams that would play it resulting in 2010 with it having 10-game rather than 11-game schedule. In 2011, Nebraska–Omaha joined the Summit League and moved to Division I after the 2010–11 season.

As Nebraska–Omaha departed in 2011, the membership of the MIAA downsized to 11. Central Oklahoma, Northeastern State, Nebraska–Kearney, and Lindenwood all joined in 2012–13, pushing the membership to 15. The league returned to 14 institutions when Truman left in 2013 to join the Great Lakes Valley Conference (GLVC).

Southwest Baptist rejoined the MIAA in football for the 2013 football season, which meant that the schools would then play an 11-game conference football schedule with no non-conference games. In 2014, Southwest Baptist and Lincoln joined the GLVC for football only. This puts it so that all of the football schools in the MIAA can play each other now, instead of rotating.

On February 8, 2018, Newman University announced that it had accepted an invitation to join the league as an associate member in all 14 sports it sponsors beginning with the 2019–20 athletic season. On May 31, 2018, the MIAA announced that Southwest Baptist would be withdrawing its membership from the MIAA to join the Great Lakes Valley Conference full-time, effective August 1, 2019. Lindenwood followed Southwest Baptist on October 4, 2018 announcing they would be joining the GLVC as well, effective July 1, 2019. On October 18, 2018 Rogers State University in Claremore, Oklahoma announced that it would be joining the league as an associate member, aborting a move to the Lone Star Conference. They became full members on July 1, 2022.

After more than 25 years at its current office at 17th and Main Streets, The MIAA announced that it was moving its offices to the newly renovated Hy-Vee Arena, which is formerly known as Kemper Arena.

MIAA and GAC announced a partnership in June 2018 to combine their men’s tennis and men’s soccer leagues in both sports from 2019–20 academic year. Under the agreement, the MIAA will organize the tennis league and the GAC will organize the soccer.

===2020 to present===
On January 26, 2023, Lincoln announced it was departing the MIAA following two stints of membership inside the association spanning 43 years. On June 26, 2023, Arkansas-Fort Smith announced they had accepted an invitation to become a full-time member of the league. Both changes occurred in time for the 2024-25 season.

===Commissioners===
In July 1981, Ken B. Jones was appointed as the first full-time MIAA commissioner. He held the position for 16 years, retiring in 1997. Ralph McFillen succeeded Jones, serving 10 years until retiring in 2007. Jim Johnson then succeeded McFillen in July 2007 and served as commissioner until September 2010. Bob Boerigter succeeded Johnson on September 20, 2010 as commissioner and retired on January 27, 2017. On September 7, 2016, it was announced that Mike Racy would become the fifth commissioner of the MIAA, effective January 30, 2017.

<doc id="79641" wikidata="Q1443" url="?curid=79641" title="Molise">
<text>Molise ( , ; ; , ) is a region in Southern Italy. Until 1963, it formed part of the region of Abruzzi e Molise together with Abruzzo.

== Economy ==
Agriculture, involving small and micro holdings, is currently offering high-quality products. The agricultural holdings produce wine, cereals, olive oil, vegetables, fruits and dairy products. Traditional products are Grass Pea (cicerchia) and Farro. Molise&#x27;s autochthonous grape is Tintilia which has been rediscovered during the last ten years, and many other PDO (DOP) wines, both red and white.

Though there is a large Fiat plant (Termoli), the industrial sector is dominated by the farming industry with small and medium-sized farms spread widely throughout the region. Another important industry is food processing: pasta, meat, milk products, oil and wine are the traditional products of the region. In the services sector the most important industries are distribution, hotels and catering, followed by transport and communications, banking and insurance. With few exceptions, in all sectors firms are small, and this explains the difficulties encountered when marketing products on a national scale.

International tourism is growing largely as a result of the recent opening of international flights from other European countries to Pescara Airport, which is not far to the north in Abruzzo and connected to Molise by the A14 highway (the only highway passing through Molise, by Termoli).

The unemployment rate stood at 9.5% in 2020.

===Tourism===
Molise has many small and picturesque villages. Four of them have been selected by (), a non-profit private association of small Italian towns of strong historical and artistic interest, founded on the initiative of the Tourism Council of the National Association of Italian Municipalities.

== Demographics ==
The density of the population in Molise is well below the national average. In 2008, Molise registered 72.3 inhabitants per km2, compared to a national figure of 198.8. The region is subdivided into two provinces: Campobasso and Isernia, which together cover 1.5% of Italy&#x27;s territory and less than 1% of its population. The larger province in terms of area is Campobasso at 2,909 km2, while the smaller is Isernia at 1,529 km2. The province of Campobasso is the more densely populated of the two provinces, with 79.4 inhabitants per km2, whereas Isernia registers 58.9 inhabitants per km2. At the end of 2008 the most populous towns were Campobasso (51,247 inhabitants), Termoli (32,420) and Isernia (21,811).

In the period 1951–71, large-scale emigration to other countries of the European Union, to other parts of Italy and overseas led to a significant decline in the population of Molise. Negative net migration persisted until 1981. Large-scale emigration has caused many of the smaller towns and villages to lose over 60% of their population, while only a small number of larger towns have recorded significant gains. From 1982 to 1994, net migration has been positive, then followed by a negative trend until 2001. Between 1991 (330,900 inhabitants) and 2001 (320,601 inhabitants), the population of the region decreased by 3.1%; since 2001 the population remained stable.

The region is home to two main ethnic minorities: the Molisan Croats (20,000 people who speak an old Dalmatian dialect of Croatian alongside Italian), and those who speak the Arbëresh dialect of Albanian in five towns of &quot;basso Molise&quot; in the province of Campobasso.

==Government and politics==

===Cuisine===
The cuisine of Molise is similar to the cuisine of Abruzzo, though there are some differences in the dishes and ingredients. The flavors of Molise are dominated by the many aromatic herbs that grow there. Some of the characteristic foods include spicy salami, a variety of locally produced cheeses, dishes using lamb or goat, pasta dishes with hearty sauces, and vegetables that grow in the region.

In addition to bruschetta, a typical antipasto will consist of any of several meat dishes, such as the sausages capocollo, the fennel-seasoned salsiccie al finocchio, soppressata, ventricina, frascateglie or sanguinaccio. In addition to these sausages, a variety of ham is available, such as smoked prosciutto. Frequently, the sausages are enjoyed with polenta.

Main dishes of the region include:
*&quot; Brodosini&quot; made of tagliatelle in broth with pork cheek and fat
* &quot;Calcioni di ricotta&quot;, a specialty of Campobasso, made of fried pasta stuffed with ricotta, provolone, prosciutto, and parsley, and usually served with fried artichokes, cauliflower, brains, sweetbread, potato croquette, and scamorza cheese
* &quot;Cavatiegl e Patane&quot;, or gnocchi served in a meat sauce of rabbit and pork
* A variety of pasta such as cavatelli, lasagna, or maccheroni served with a ragù of lamb or goat
* &quot;Pasta e fagioli&quot;, pasta-and-white-bean soup cooked with pig&#x27;s feet and pork rinds
* &quot;Polenta d&#x27;iragn&quot;, a polenta-like dish actually made of wheat and potatoes, sauced with raw tomatoes and pecorino
* &quot;Risotto alla marinara&quot;, a risotto with seafood
* &quot;Spaghetti with diavolillo&quot;, a strong chili pepper sauce
* &quot;Zuppa di cardi&quot;, a soup of cardoons, tomatoes, onions, pancetta, olive oil
* &quot;Zuppa di ortiche&quot;, a soup of nettle stems, tomatoes, onions, pancetta, olive oil

Common second dishes (often meat and vegetable dishes) are:
* Lamb, the most popular meat, served grilled, roasted, or stewed
* Many organ meats of lamb, especially tripe, are popular
* &quot;Coniglio alla molisana&quot;, grilled rabbit pieces skewered with sausage and herbs
* &quot;Mazzarelle&quot;, tightly wrapped rolls made with lung and tripe of lamb
* &quot;Ragù d&#x27; agnello&quot;, braised lamb with sweet peppers, a specialty of Isernia
* &quot;Torcinelli&quot;, rolled strips of lamb tripe, sweetbreads, and liver
* &quot;Pamparella&quot; or pork pancetta dried with peperoncino, soaked in wine and cut into small pieces. Pamparella is used to flavor sauces, in particular the sauce for dressing the tacconi, a rustic pasta made with flour and water.
* &quot;Saucicc&#x27;, Paparuol&#x27; e Ova Fritte&quot;, sausage with sweet pepper and fried eggs

Typical vegetable dishes may include:
* &quot;Carciofi ripieni&quot;, artichokes stuffed with anchovies and capers
* Peeled sweet peppers stuffed with breadcrumbs, anchovies, parsley, basil and peperoncino, sautéed in a frying pan and cooked with chopped tomatoes
* &quot;Cipollacci con pecorino&quot;, fried strong onions and pecorino cheese
* &quot;Frittata con basilico e cipolle&quot;, omelette with basil and onions

Fish dishes include red mullet soup, and spaghetti with cuttlefish. Trout from the Biferno river is notable for its flavor, and is cooked with a simple but tasty sauce of aromatic herbs. Zuppa di pesce, a fish stew, is a specialty of Termoli.

The cheeses produced in Molise are not very different from those produced in Abruzzo. The more common ones are Burrino and Manteca, soft, buttery cow&#x27;s-milk cheeses; Pecorino, sheep&#x27;s-milk cheese, served young and soft or aged and hard, called also &quot;Maciuocco&quot; in Molise; Scamorza, bland cow&#x27;s-milk cheese, often served grilled; and Caciocavallo, sheep&#x27;s-milk cheese.

Sweets and desserts have an ancient tradition here and are linked to the history of the territory and to religious and family festivities. Most common are:
* &quot;Calciumi&quot; (also called &quot;caucioni&quot; or &quot;cauciuni&quot;), sweet ravioli filled with chestnuts, almonds, chocolate, vanilla, cooked wine musts, and cinnamon and then fried
* &quot;Ciambelline&quot;, ring-shaped cakes made in the countryside. They may be &quot;all&#x27;olio&quot; (with olive oil) or &quot;al vino rosso&quot; (with red wine).
* &quot;Ferratelle all&#x27;anice&quot;, anise cakes made in metal molds and stamped with special patterns
* &quot;Ricotta pizza&quot;, a cake pan filled with a blend of ricotta cheese, sugar, flour, butter, maraschino liqueur, and chocolate chips

<text>Cappadocia (; , from ) is a historical region in Central Anatolia region, Turkey. It is largely in the provinces of Nevşehir, Kayseri, Aksaray, Kırşehir, Sivas and Niğde.

According to Herodotus, in the time of the Ionian Revolt (499 BC), the Cappadocians were reported as occupying a region from the Taurus Mountains to the vicinity of the Euxine (Black Sea). Cappadocia, in this sense, was bounded in the south by the chain of mountains that separate it from Cilicia, to the east by the upper Euphrates, to the north by the Pontus, and to the west by Lycaonia and eastern Galatia.

The name, traditionally used in Christian sources throughout history, continues in use as an international tourism concept to define a region of exceptional natural wonders, in particular characterized by fairy chimneys, in addition to its religious heritage of being a centre of early Christian learning, evidenced by hundreds of churches and monasteries (such as those of Göreme and Ihlara), as well as underground cities that were dug to offer protection during periods of persecution.

==Etymology==
The earliest record of the name of Cappadocia (; ; , , from ; ; ) dates from the late sixth century BC, when it appears in the trilingual inscriptions of two early Achaemenid emperors, Darius the Great and Xerxes I, as one of the countries (Old Persian &quot;dahyu-&quot;). In these lists of countries, the Old Persian name is &quot;Katpatuka&quot;. It was proposed that &quot;Kat-patuka&quot; came from the Luwian language, meaning &quot;Low Country&quot;.

Subsequent research suggests that the adverb &quot;katta&quot; meaning &#x27;down, below&#x27; is exclusively Hittite, while its Luwian equivalent is &quot;zanta&quot;. Therefore, the recent modification of this proposal operates with the Hittite &quot;katta peda-&quot;, literally &quot;place below&quot; as a starting point for the development of the toponym Cappadocia.

The earlier derivation from Iranian &quot;Hu-apa-dahyu&quot; &#x27;Land of good horses&#x27; can hardly be reconciled with the phonetic shape of &quot;Kat-patuka&quot;. Several other etymologies have also been offered in the past.

Herodotus wrote that the name of the Cappadocians was applied to them by the Persians, while they were termed by the Greeks &quot;White Syrians&quot; (&quot;Leucosyri&quot;), who were most probably descendants of the Hittites. One of the Cappadocian tribes he mentions is the Moschoi, associated by Flavius Josephus with the biblical figure Meshech, son of Japheth: &quot;and the Mosocheni were founded by Mosoch; now they are Cappadocians&quot;. AotJ I:6.


Cappadocia appears in the biblical account given in the book of . The Cappadocians were named as one group (among &quot;Parthians, Medes and Elamites; residents of Mesopotamia, Judea and Cappadocia, Pontus and Asia&quot;) hearing the Gospel account from Galileans in their own language on the day of Pentecost shortly after the resurrection of Jesus Christ. states &quot;Now there were staying in Jerusalem God-fearing Jews from every nation under heaven,&quot; seeming to suggest that some of the Cappadocians were Jews, or part of the diaspora of Jews present in Jerusalem at the time.

The region is also mentioned in the Jewish Mishnah, in Ketubot 13:11, and in several places in the Talmud, including Yevamot 121a, Hullin 47b.

Under the later kings of the Persian Empire, the Cappadocians were divided into two satrapies, or governments, with one comprising the central and inland portion, to which the name of Cappadocia continued to be applied by Greek geographers, while the other was called Pontus. This division had already come about before the time of Xenophon. As after the fall of the Persian government the two provinces continued to be separate, the distinction was perpetuated, and the name Cappadocia came to be restricted to the inland province (sometimes called Great Cappadocia), which alone will be the focus of this article.

The kingdom of Cappadocia still existed in the time of Strabo () as a nominally independent state. Cilicia was the name given to the district in which Caesarea, the capital of the whole country, was situated. The only two cities of Cappadocia considered by Strabo to deserve that appellation were Caesarea (originally known as Mazaca) and Tyana, not far from the foot of the Taurus.

==Geography and climate==

Cappadocia lies in eastern Anatolia, in the heartland of what is now Turkey. The relief consists of a high plateau over 1000 m in altitude that is pierced by volcanic peaks, with Mount Erciyes (ancient Argaeus) near Kayseri (ancient Caesarea) being the tallest at . The boundaries of historical Cappadocia are vague, particularly towards the west. To the south, the Taurus Mountains form the boundary with Cilicia and separate Cappadocia from the Mediterranean Sea. To the west, Cappadocia is bounded by the historical regions of Lycaonia to the southwest, and Galatia to the northwest. Due to its inland location and high altitude, Cappadocia has a markedly continental climate, with hot dry summers and cold snowy winters. Rainfall is sparse and the region is largely semi-arid.

Cappadocia contained the sources of the Sarus and Pyramus rivers with their higher affluents, and also the middle course of the Halys, and the whole course of the tributary of the Euphrates later called Tokhma Su. But as no one of these rivers was navigable or served to fertilize the lands along its course, none has much importance in the history of the province.

==Geology==
Ignimbrites of Miocene age are present within the area.

===IUGS geological heritage site===
In respect of the &#x27;voluminous eruption deposits in a fluvio-lacustrine sequence with &#x27;fairy-chimney&#x27; development produced by uplift and erosion&#x27;, the International Union of Geological Sciences (IUGS) included &#x27;The Miocene Cappadocian ignimbrites sequence&#x27; in its assemblage of 100 &#x27;geological heritage sites&#x27; around the world in a listing published in October 2022. The organisation defines an IUGS Geological Heritage Site as &#x27;a key place with geological elements and/or processes of international scientific relevance, used as a reference, and/or with a substantial contribution to the development of geological sciences through history.&#x27;

==History==
===Ancient history===

Cappadocia was known as Hatti in the late Bronze Age, and was the homeland of the Hittite power centred at Hattusa. After the fall of the Hittite Empire, with the decline of the Syro-Cappadocians (Mushki) after their defeat by the Lydian king Croesus in the 6th century BC, Cappadocia was ruled by a sort of feudal aristocracy, dwelling in strong castles and keeping the peasants in a servile condition, which later made them apt to foreign slavery. It was included in the third Persian satrapy in the division established by Darius but continued to be governed by rulers of its own, none apparently supreme over the whole country and all more or less tributaries of the Great King.

===Kingdom of Cappadocia===

After ending the Persian Empire, Alexander the Great tried to rule the area through one of his military commanders. But Ariarathes, previously satrap of the region, declared himself king of the Cappadocians. As Ariarathes I (332–322 BC), he was a successful ruler, and he extended the borders of the Cappadocian Kingdom as far as to the Black Sea. The kingdom of Cappadocia lived in peace until the death of Alexander. The previous empire was then divided into many parts, and Cappadocia fell to Eumenes. His claims were made good in 322 BC by the regent Perdiccas, who crucified Ariarathes; but in the dissensions which brought about Eumenes&#x27;s death, Ariarathes II, the adopted son of Ariarathes I, recovered his inheritance and left it to a line of successors, who mostly bore the name of the founder of the dynasty.

Persian colonists in the Cappadocian kingdom, cut off from their co-religionists in Iran proper, continued to practice Zoroastrianism. Strabo, observing them in the first century BC, records (XV.3.15) that these &quot;fire kindlers&quot; possessed many &quot;holy places of the Persian Gods&quot;, as well as fire temples. Strabo furthermore relates, were &quot;noteworthy enclosures; and in their midst there is an altar, on which there is a large quantity of ashes and where the magi keep the fire ever burning.&quot; According to Strabo, who wrote during the time of Augustus (), almost three hundred years after the fall of the Achaemenid Persian Empire, there remained only traces of Persians in western Asia Minor; however, he considered Cappadocia &quot;almost a living part of Persia&quot;.

Under Ariarathes IV, Cappadocia came into relations with Rome, first as a foe espousing the cause of Antiochus the Great, then as an ally against Perseus of Macedon. The kings henceforward threw in their lot with the Republic as against the Seleucids, to whom they had been from time to time tributary. Ariarathes V marched with the Roman proconsul Publius Licinius Crassus Dives Mucianus against Aristonicus, a claimant to the throne of Pergamon, and their forces were annihilated (130 BC). The imbroglio which followed his death ultimately led to interference by the rising power of Pontus and the intrigues and wars which ended in the failure of the dynasty.

===Roman and early Christian period===

The Cappadocians, supported by Rome against Mithridates VI of Pontus, elected a native lord, Ariobarzanes, to succeed (93 BC); but in the same year Armenian troops under Tigranes the Great entered Cappadocia, dethroned king Ariobarzanes and crowned Gordios as the new client-king of Cappadocia, thus creating a buffer zone against the encroaching Romans. It was not until Rome had deposed the Pontic and Armenian kings that the rule of Ariobarzanes was established (63 BC). In the civil wars Cappadocia was first for Pompey, then for Caesar, then for Antony, and finally, Octavian. The Ariobarzanes dynasty came to an end, a Cappadocian nobleman Archelaus was given the throne, by favour first of Antony and then of Octavian, and maintained tributary independence until AD 17, when the emperor Tiberius, whom he had angered, summoned him to Rome and reduced Cappadocia to a Roman province.

In 70 AD, Vespasian joined Armenia Minor to Cappadocia, and made the combined province a frontier bulwark. It remained, under various provincial redistributions, part of the Eastern Empire for centuries. In 314, Cappadocia was the largest province of the Roman Empire, and was part of the Diocese of Pontus. In 371, the western part of the Cappadocia province was divided into &quot;Cappadocia Prima&quot;, with its capital at Caesarea (modern-day Kayseri); and &quot;Cappadocia Secunda&quot;, with its capital at Tyana. By 386, the region to the east of Caesarea had become part of &quot;Armenia Secunda&quot;, while the northeast had become part of &quot;Armenia Prima&quot;. Cappadocia largely consisted of major estates, owned by the Roman emperors or wealthy local families. The Cappadocian provinces became more important in the latter part of the 4th century, as the Romans were involved with the Sasanian Empire over control of Mesopotamia and &quot;Armenia beyond the Euphrates&quot;. Cappadocia, now well into the Roman era, still retained a significant Iranian character; Stephen Mitchell notes that &quot;many inhabitants of Cappadocia were of Persian descent and Iranian fire worship is attested as late as 465&quot; and the area also contained a sizeable Armenian population since antiquity. For most of the Byzantine era it remained relatively undisturbed by the conflicts in the area with the Sasanian Empire, but the Persian Wars of the 610s and 620s placed Cappadocia on the frontline for the first time since the first century.

The exact date of arrival of Christianity in uncertain, but latest from the third century it was firmly established in society and the Church was fully developed. The Cappadocian Fathers of the 4th century were integral to much of early Christian philosophy. It also produced, among other people, John of Cappadocia, Patriarch of Constantinople from 517–520, and Macrina, an early champion of women&#x27;s monasticism. The region suffered famine in 368 described as &quot;the most severe ever remembered&quot; by Gregory of Nazianzus:
The city was in distress and there was no source of assistance [...] The hardest part of all such distress is the insensibility and insatiability of those who possess supplies [...] Such are the buyers and sellers of corn [...] by his word and advice Basil&#x27;s] open the stores of those who possessed them, and so, according to the Scripture, dealt food to the hungry and satisfied the poor with bread [...] He gathered together the victims of the famine [...] and obtaining contributions of all sorts of food which can relieve famine, set before them basins of soup and such meat as was found preserved among us, on which the poor live [...] Such was our young furnisher of corn, and second Joseph [...] [But unlike Joseph, Basil&#x27;s] services were gratuitous and his succour of the famine gained no profit, having only one object, to win kindly feelings by kindly treatment, and to gain by his rations of corn the heavenly blessings.

This is similar to another account by Gregory of Nyssa that Basil &quot;ungrudgingly spent upon the poor his patrimony even before he was a priest, and most of all in the time of the famine, during which [Basil] was a ruler of the Church, though still a priest in the rank of presbyters; and afterwards did not hoard even what remained to him&quot;. Basil also famously constructed near Caeserea the Basileias, a vast complex with hospices for sick, churches, quarters for travellers and facilities for doctors and nurses.

===Byzantine periods===

The Arrival of Muslim Arab armies in the mid-seventh century resulted in the breakdown of civil and military order of the Eastern provices and a colossal displacement of population. Cappdocia became a border region of the Byzantine Empire, frequently raided by the Caliphate. From the 7th century, Cappadocia was divided between the Anatolic and Armeniac themes. The frontier zone between Caeserea (Kayseri) and Melitene became a no-man&#x27;s land, in which the akritai and ghazis fought each other and which is remembered in the epic &quot;Digenes Akritas&quot;. The warfare, consisting of the yearly razzias as well as major campaigns took a heavy toll on the cities and villages, especially on the favourite Arab lines of march.
Cappadocia contains several underground cities (see Kaymaklı Underground City), many of which were dug by Christians to provide protection during the Arab raids and periods of persecution. The underground cities have vast defence networks of traps throughout their many levels. These traps are very creative, including such devices as large round stones to block doors and holes in the ceiling through which the defenders may drop spears.

Throughout the Dark Ages to the Middle Byzantine period, Armenians immigrated in significant numbers into Cappadocia, partly due to imperial policies. The Arab historian Abu Al Faraj asserts the following about Armenian settlers in Sebasteia, during the 10th century:
They [the Armenians] were assigned the Sebaste (now Siwas) district of Cappadocia. Their number grew to such an extent that they became valuable auxiliaries to the imperial armies. They were employed to garrison the fortresses reconquered from the Arabs (probably Membedj, Dolouk, etc.). They formed excellent infantry for the armies of Basileus in all wars, constantly fighting with courage and success alongside the Romans.
As a result of the Byzantine military campaigns and the Seljuk invasion of Armenia, the Armenians spread into Cappadocia and eastward from Cilicia into the mountainous areas of northern Syria and Mesopotamia, and the Armenian Kingdom of Cilicia was eventually formed. This immigration was increased further after the decline of the local imperial power and the establishment of the Crusader States following the Fourth Crusade. To the crusaders, Cappadocia was &quot;terra Hermeniorum&quot;, the land of the Armenians, due to the large number of Armenians settled there.

In the 9th–11th centuries, the region comprised the themes of Charsianon with its capital at the eponymous city and Cappadocia, which had first its capital in Nyssa and then at Koron, after Nyssa had been sacked by the Arabs in 838. By the mid-tenth century, the region was again reorganised as much of the no-men&#x27;s land was resettled, especially around the area of Larissa, Tzamandos, and Lykandos. After the Byzantine reconquests in the East finished, Cappadocia was again removed from the frontier and an increasingly demilitarised region in the eleventh century.
===Turkish Cappadocia===

Following the Battle of Manzikert in 1071, various Turkish clans under the leadership of the Seljuks began settling in Anatolia. With the rise of Turkish power in Anatolia, Cappadocia slowly became a tributary to the Turkish states that were established to the east and to the west; some of the native population converted to Islam with the rest forming the remaining Cappadocian Greek population. By the end of the early 12th century, Anatolian Seljuks had established their sole dominance over the region. With the decline and the fall of the Konya-based Seljuks in the second half of the 13th century, they were gradually replaced by successive Turkic ruled states: the Karaman-based Beylik of Karaman and then the Ottoman Empire. Cappadocia remained part of the Ottoman Empire until 1922, when it became part of the modern state of Turkey.

A fundamental change occurred in between when a new urban center, Nevşehir, was founded in the early 18th century by a grand vizier who was a native of the locality (Nevşehirli Damat İbrahim Pasha), to serve as regional capital, a role the city continues to assume to this day. In the meantime many former Cappadocians had shifted to a Turkish dialect (written in Greek alphabet, &quot;Karamanlıca&quot;), and where the Greek language was maintained (Sille, villages near Kayseri, Pharasa town and other nearby villages), it became heavily influenced by the surrounding Turkish. This dialect of Eastern Roman Greek is known as &quot;Cappadocian Greek&quot;. Following the foundation of Turkey in 1922, those who still identified with this pre-Islamic culture of Cappadocia were required to leave, so this language is now only spoken by a handful of their descendants, most now located in modern Greece.

==Modern tourism==


The area is a popular tourist destination, as it has many areas with unique geological, historic, cultural, and religious features. Touristic Cappadocia includes four cities: Nevşehir, Kayseri, Aksaray and Niğde.

The region is located southwest of the major city Kayseri, which has airline and railway service to Ankara and Istanbul and other cities.

The most important towns and destinations in Cappadocia are Ürgüp, Göreme, Love Valley, Ihlara Valley, Selime, Güzelyurt, Uçhisar, Avanos and Zelve.

Sedimentary rocks formed in lakes and streams and ignimbrite deposits that erupted from ancient volcanoes approximately nine to years ago, during the late Miocene to Pliocene epochs, underlie the Cappadocia region. The rocks of Cappadocia near Göreme eroded into hundreds of spectacular pillars and minaret-like forms. People of the villages at the heart of the Cappadocia region carved out houses, churches and monasteries from the soft rocks of volcanic deposits. Göreme became a Christian monastic centre in 300–1200 AD. The Yusuf Koç, Ortahane, Durmus Kadir and Bezirhane churches in Göreme, and houses and churches carved into rocks in the Uzundere, Bağıldere and Zemi Valleys, all evidence Cappadocia as a centre of early Christian learning and are thus a place of pilgrimage. The Göreme Open Air Museum is the most visited site of the Christian monastic communities in Cappadocia (see Churches of Göreme and Churches of the Ihlara Valley) and is one of the most famous sites in central Turkey. The complex contains more than 30 carved-from-rock churches and chapels, some having superb frescoes inside, dating from the ninth century to the eleventh century.

The three main castles in Cappadocia are Uçhisar Castle, Ortahisar Castle, and Ürgüp Kadıkalesi (Temenni Tepe). Among the most visited underground cities are Derinkuyu, Kaymakli, Gaziemir and Ozkonak. The best historic mansions and cave houses for tourist stays are in Ürgüp, Göreme, Güzelyurt and Uçhisar.

Hot-air ballooning is very popular in Cappadocia and is available in Göreme. Trekking is practised in Ihlara Valley, Monastery Valley (Güzelyurt), Ürgüp and Göreme.

==Mesothelioma==
In 1975, a study of three small villages in central Cappadocia—Tuzköy, Karain and Sarıhıdır—found that mesothelioma was causing 50% of all deaths. Initially, this was attributed to erionite, a zeolite mineral with similar properties to asbestos, but detailed epidemiological investigation demonstrated that the substance causes the disease mostly in families with a genetic predisposition to mineral fiber carcinogenesis. The studies are being extended to other parts of the region.

==Media==

The area was featured in several films due to its topography. The 1983 Italian/French/Turkish film &quot;Yor, the Hunter from the Future&quot; and 1985&#x27;s &quot;Land of Doom&quot; were filmed in Cappadocia. The region was used for the 1989 science fiction film &quot;Slipstream&quot; to depict a cult of wind worshippers. In 2010 and early 2011, the film &quot;Ghost Rider: Spirit of Vengeance&quot; was also filmed in the Cappadocia region.

Autechre&#x27;s second album, Amber, features a photo of this region&#x27;s fairy mountains as the cover art, being their only album whose cover isn&#x27;t computer-generated.

Cappadocia&#x27;s winter landscapes and broad panoramas are prominent in the 2014 film &quot;Winter Sleep&quot; (Turkish: Kış Uykusu), directed by Nuri Bilge Ceylan, which won the Palme d&#x27;Or at the 2014 Cannes Film Festival.

==Sports==
Since 2012, a multiday track running ultramarathon of desert concept, called Runfire Cappadocia Ultramarathon, is held annually in July. The race tours in six days through several places across Cappadocia reaching out to Lake Tuz. Between September 9 and September 13, 2016, for the first time, the Turkish Presidential Bike Tour took place in Cappadocia where more than 300 cyclists from around the globe participated.

<text>The pinto bean () is a variety of common bean (&quot;Phaseolus vulgaris&quot;). In Spanish they are called . It is the most popular bean by crop production in Northern Mexico and the Southwestern United States, and is most often eaten whole (sometimes in broth), or mashed and then refried. Prepared either way, it is a common filling for burritos, tostadas, or tacos in Mexican cuisine, also as a side or as part of an entrée served with a side tortilla or sopaipilla in New Mexican cuisine.

In South America, it is known as the , literally &quot;strawberry bean&quot;. In Portuguese, the Brazilian name is (literally &quot; bean&quot;; contrary to popular belief, the beans were not named after Rio de Janeiro, but after a pig breed that has the same color as the legume), which differs from the name in Portugal: . Additionally, the young immature pods may be harvested and cooked as &quot;green pinto beans&quot;. There are a number of different varieties of pinto bean, notably some originating from Northern Spain, where an annual fair is dedicated to the bean.

In many languages, &quot;pinto&quot; means &quot;colored&quot; or &quot;painted&quot;, as derived from the Late Latin and Classical Latin . In Spanish, it means &quot;painted&quot;, &quot;dappled&quot;, or &quot;spotted&quot;. The coloration of pinto beans is similar to that of pinto horses.

==Use==
The dried pinto bean is used in many dishes, especially refried beans. It is popular in chili con carne, although kidney beans, black beans, and many others may be used in other locales.

Pinto beans are often found in Brazilian cuisine. Legumes, mainly the common bean, are a staple food everywhere in the country, cultivated since 3000 BC, along with starch-rich foods, such as rice, manioc, pasta, and other wheat-based products, polenta and other corn-based products, potatoes and yams. Pinto beans are also a very important ingredient in Spanish cuisine and Mexican cuisine.

In Spanish cuisine pinto beans are mostly used in a dish named after them.

In the Southern United States, pinto beans were once a staple, especially during the winter months. Some organizations and churches in rural areas still sponsor &quot;pinto bean suppers&quot; for social gatherings and fund raisers.

==Varieties==

Pinto bean varieties include: &#x27;Burke&#x27;, &#x27;Hidatsa&#x27;, and &#x27;Othello&#x27;.

The alubia pinta alavesa, or the &quot;Alavese pinto bean&quot;, a red variety of the pinto bean, originated in Añana, a town and municipality located in the province of Álava, in the Basque Country of northern Spain. In October, the &quot;Feria de la alubia pinta alavesa&quot; (Alavese pinto bean fair) is celebrated in Pobes.

==Cooking==
Pinto beans are often soaked, which greatly shortens cooking time. If unsoaked, they are frequently boiled rapidly for 10 minutes. They will then generally take two to three hours to cook on a stove to soften. In a pressure cooker they will cook very rapidly, perhaps 3 minutes if soaked, and 20-45 minutes if unsoaked. Cooking times vary considerably however and may depend on the source of the bean, hardness of the cooking water and many other factors.

==Nutrition==
A nutrient-dense legume, the pinto bean contains many essential nutrients. It is a good source of protein, phosphorus and manganese, and very high in dietary fiber and folate.

Rice and pinto beans served with cornbread or maize tortillas are often a staple meal where meat is unavailable. This combination contains the essential amino acids necessary for humans in adequate amounts: maize complements beans&#x27; relative scarcity of methionine and cystine and beans complement maize&#x27;s relative scarcity of lysine and tryptophan.

Studies have indicated pinto beans can lower the levels of both HDL and LDL cholesterol. Pinto beans have also been shown to contain the phytoestrogen coumestrol, which has a variety of possible health effects.

<text>Brief Lives is a collection of short biographies written by John Aubrey (1626–1697) in the last decades of the 17th century.

==Writing==
Aubrey initially began collecting biographical material to assist the Oxford scholar Anthony Wood, who was working on his own collection of biographies. With time, Aubrey&#x27;s biographical researches went beyond mere assistance to Wood and became a project in its own right.

Aubrey was careful, wherever possible, to seek out and talk with those who had been acquainted with his subjects. His sociable nature and his wide circle of friends helped him in this pursuit. At his death, Aubrey left his biographical writings in a state of chaos. It has been the task of later editors to organise the manuscripts (held at the Bodleian Library) into readable form.

==Afterlife==
Aubrey&#x27;s &quot;Brief Lives&quot; has been loved for generations for its colourful gossipy tone and for the glimpses it provides of the unofficial sides of its subjects. Aubrey&#x27;s use of informants and his eye for the unusual provides much more vivid pictures than a biography based on documents could. He is frank but never malicious.

The &quot;Brief Lives&quot; includes biographies of such figures as Francis Bacon, Robert Boyle, Thomas Browne, John Dee, Sir Walter Raleigh, Edmund Halley, Ben Jonson, Thomas Hobbes, John Ogilby, William Petty and William Shakespeare. There have been many modern editions.

Patrick Garland wrote and directed a play &quot;Brief Lives&quot; based on Aubrey&#x27;s work; featuring Roy Dotrice as Aubrey. The production has been performed worldwide since 1969.

In 2008, &quot;Aubrey&#x27;s Brief Lives&quot; was a five-part drama serial on BBC Radio 4. Writer Nick Warburton intertwined some of Aubrey&#x27;s biographical sketches with the story of the turbulent friendship between Aubrey and Wood. Abigail le Fleming produced and directed.

<text>Interstate 78 (I-78) is an east–west Interstate Highway in the Northeastern United States that runs from I-81 northeast of Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, through Allentown to western and North Jersey, terminating at the Holland Tunnel entrance to Lower Manhattan in New York City. Major metropolitan areas along I-78 include the Lehigh Valley in Pennsylvania, the Gateway Region in New Jersey, and the New York metropolitan area.

I-78 links ports in New York City and North Jersey to points west, including the Lehigh Valley, the third-largest metropolitan region of Pennsylvania. I-78 accommodates over four million trucks annually, representing 24 percent of all truck traffic in the nation. It also is a major connection point to the New York metropolitan area&#x27;s three major international airports, Newark Liberty International Airport, John F. Kennedy International Airport, and LaGuardia Airport.

===Pennsylvania===

I-78 begins at a directional T interchange with I-81 in Union Township, about northeast of Harrisburg. Near the east end of the county, at exit 8, U.S. Route 22 (US 22) merges with I-78, and runs concurrently for the next through Berks and Lehigh counties.

At exit 51, in Upper Macungie Township, US 22 leaves the highway. Drivers on I-78 eastbound must use this exit to access I-476, also known as the Northeast Extension of the Pennsylvania Turnpike, and westbound travelers must use exit 53 (northbound Pennsylvania Route 309, PA 309) and then westbound US 22. From exits 53 to 60, I-78 runs concurrently with PA 309. The six-lane overlap bypasses the city of Allentown to the south and crosses South Mountain.

At exit 60 (A–B going westbound), PA 309 yields south to Quakertown. Approximately east, there is an interchange between PA 412 and I-78 in Hellertown, serving Bethlehem and Lehigh University. At exit 71, PA 33 reaches its southern terminus at a trumpet interchange. PA 33 traverses the Pocono Mountains as it enters Bangor and crosses I-80. The final exit on I-78 in Pennsylvania is Morgan Hill Road, which accesses PA 611 and Easton. I-78 then crosses the I-78 Toll Bridge and enters New Jersey.

===New Jersey===

After the I-78 Toll Bridge, I-78 enters New Jersey as the Phillipsburg–Newark Expressway. The road begins by running parallel with County Route 642 (CR 642) in the town of Alpha. At , a partial cloverleaf interchange brings together US 22, Route 122, and Route 173 with I-78 in Phillipsburg. US 22 now runs concurrently with I-78 for the next . Going westbound, exit 4 leaves to the right for CR 637 and Warren Glen. The next exit, exit 6, is for CR 632 in Bloomsbury. The route number is not signed on I-78. Exit 7 in Bloomsbury is the first of several eastbound exits for Route 173, which runs parallel the Interstate. later, exit 11 leaves to the right as another exit for Route 173. CR 614 is located off the exit. Exit 12 westbound is for Route 173 again. Exit 12 eastbound is for a frontage road paralleling I-78.

Exit 13 is only westbound and is another exit for Route 173. Nearby the exit, going eastbound, the frontage road merges in. Exit 15 is for Route 173 and CR 513 in Franklin Township. Exit 17 is for Route 31 in Clinton Township. In Annandale, US 22 leaves I-78 at exit 18. US 22 continues to Bound Brook and Union County. At exit 20, CR 639 intersects. CR 639 heads to the Round Valley Reservoir. Exit 24 is for CR 523 to Oldwick. At exit 29, I-287, US 202, and US 206 interchange with I-78 in Bedminster. At this point, in Somerset County, exits 33, 36, and 40 are for county routes in Warren Township. At exit 41, I-78 enters Union County and then passes through the Watchung Reservation, where land bridges cross over the highway to allow for the safe passage of wildlife. At exit 45, CR 527 intersects after paralleling for some time. West of exit 48, I-78 splits into express and local highways. Exit 48 is for Route 24 in Springfield Township. Exit 49A is for one of Route 24&#x27;s spur routes, Route 124. Exit 52 is for the Garden State Parkway in Union Township. At exits 57 and 58, Route 21, US 1, US 9, and US 22 intersect I-78. The exit provides access to Newark Liberty International Airport.

East of exit 58 at the eastern tip of Newark, I-78 becomes the Newark Bay Extension of the New Jersey Turnpike. Past the first toll plaza, I-78 has an interchange with I-95 (New Jersey Turnpike) and crosses Newark Bay via the Newark Bay Bridge. The first exit, 14A, is for Route 440 in Bayonne. Liberty State Park can be reached by taking exit 14B. Exit 14C is the final numbered exit, providing access to the Liberty Science Center. Route 139 runs concurrently with I-78 along a one-way pair of surface streets as it approaches the Holland Tunnel and enters New York state.

===New York===

I-78&#x27;s length in New York is —half of the Holland Tunnel and the egress-only roundabout immediately beyond the end of the tunnel. The route was planned to run east and north through New York City to end at I-95 in the Bronx, but sections of the planned route, including the Lower Manhattan Expressway, were canceled.

In New York City, I-78 continues through the egress-only roundabout known as the Saint John&#x27;s Rotary. The five separate exits from the Rotary are assigned numbers, exits 1 to 5, in counterclockwise order. Exit 5, the last eastbound exit, leads onto Canal Street. Under original plans, I-78 was to cross Manhattan as the Lower Manhattan Expressway onto the Williamsburg Bridge and then beyond I-278 on Bushwick Expressway through Brooklyn into Queens near the John F. Kennedy International Airport. A section of I-78 at the airport was built as the Nassau Expressway, later I-878 and now New York State Route 878 (NY 878), though most of the westbound side was never built. Under the plans, east of the airport, I-78 would have turned north on the Clearview Expressway, built north of Hillside Avenue in Queens and now I-295, run across the Throgs Neck Bridge, and forked into two spurs, ending at I-95 via the Throgs Neck Expressway, which is now I-695 and the Bruckner Interchange via the Cross Bronx Expressway, which is now part of I-295.

==Auxiliary routes==
All of I-78&#x27;s auxiliary routes serve New York City; however, none of these routes actually intersect I-78, following the route&#x27;s truncation at the eastern end of the Holland Tunnel.
* runs from US 1/9 in Linden, New Jersey, over the Goethals Bridge, through Staten Island, over the Verrazzano-Narrows Bridge and through Brooklyn and Queens, and across the Triborough Bridge into the Bronx to end at I-95 at the Bruckner Interchange. I-278 was planned to extend west from Elizabeth, New Jersey, to I-78 in Springfield Township, Union County, New Jersey, and was to intersect I-78 at the east end of the Williamsburg Bridge in Brooklyn. Until 1972, I-278 ran along present-NY 895 and a proposed extension to I-95, while I-278 east of NY 895 was I-878.
* is an unsigned designation for the Brooklyn–Battery Tunnel, a spur from I-278 into Lower Manhattan. Plans were made to continue it north along the West Side Highway (NY 9A) to I-78 at the Holland Tunnel, though the project was later canceled.
* runs from I-278 at the Bruckner Interchange south over the Bronx–Whitestone Bridge to John F. Kennedy International Airport. It was to intersect I-78 at its south end. Original plans took I-678 west on the Grand Central Parkway to I-278.
* is an unsigned designation for part of NY 878, a short west–east freeway on the north edge of John F. Kennedy International Airport. It was once planned as part of I-78 and now intersects I-678. The number was assigned in 1970.
*A former I-878 existed from 1959 to 1972 along present I-278 east of NY 895. (NY 895 was part of I-278.)

In the Lehigh Valley region of eastern Pennsylvania, PA 378, which exits in downtown Bethlehem was once I-378 but was predesignated as a state route after I-78 was rerouted to a new southerly alignment. I-178 was initially planned to extend in Center City Allentown, but local opposition to the plan led to it being cancelled.

<text>Interstate 96 (I-96) is an east–west Interstate Highway that runs for approximately entirely within the Lower Peninsula of the US state of Michigan. The western terminus is at an interchange with US Highway 31 (US 31) and Business US 31 (Bus. US 31) on the eastern boundary of Norton Shores southeast of Muskegon, and the eastern terminus is at I-75 near the Ambassador Bridge in Detroit. From Grand Rapids through Lansing to Detroit, the freeway parallels Grand River Avenue, never straying more than a few miles from the decommissioned US 16. The Wayne County section of I-96 is named the Jeffries Freeway from its eastern terminus to the junction with I-275 and M-14. Though maps still refer to the freeway as the Jeffries, the portion within the city of Detroit was renamed by the state legislature as the Rosa Parks Memorial Highway in December 2005 in honor of the late civil rights pioneer. There are four auxiliary Interstates as well as two current and four former business routes associated with I-96.

Grand River Avenue originated as an Indian trail before Michigan statehood. It later was used as a wagon road across the state. The roadway was included in the State Trunkline Highway System in 1919 as M-16 and later the United States Numbered Highway System as US 16. Construction of a freeway along the length of the corridor was proposed in the 1940s, and included as part of the Interstate Highway System in the mid-1950s. This construction was started in 1956 and initially completed across the state to Detroit in 1962. The proposed route for the Jeffries Freeway in Detroit was moved in the 1960s; it was built in the 1970s. I-96 was completed on November 21, 1977, in the Detroit area, closing the last gap along the route. Since then, additional interchanges and lanes have been added in places to accommodate traffic needs.

==Route description==
I-96 is maintained by the Michigan Department of Transportation (MDOT) as a segment of the larger State Trunkline Highway System. In 2011, the department&#x27;s traffic surveys showed that on average, 201,200 vehicles used the highway daily between 6 and 7 Mile roads in Livonia. Near Norton Shores, 20,638 vehicles did so each day between Airline and Fruitport roads. These are the highest and lowest counts along the highway, respectively. As an Interstate Highway, all of I-96 is included in the National Highway System, a network of roads important to the country&#x27;s economy, defense, and mobility. In addition, the highway in Detroit has been named the Rosa Parks Memorial Highway by the Michigan Legislature to honor the civil rights pioneer Rosa Parks. The segment from Livonia west to I-275 is the Jeffries Freeway, named for a former mayor of Detroit, Edward Jeffries.

===Norton Shores to Grand Rapids===

I-96 begins at a three-quarter cloverleaf interchange with US 31 northeast of the Muskegon County Airport in Norton Shores, near Muskegon. At the starting terminus, the highway has a grassy median and two lanes in each direction as it travels southeasterly through rural Muskegon County. The freeway is paralleled by Airline Highway in an area with a mix of fields and residences as far as Fruitport. I-96 bypasses that village to the north and east before crossing into Ottawa County at Fruitport Road. After a distance of about in the county, the trunkline reaches Nunica. The highway crosses the Crockery Creek and turns eastward toward Coopersville. The freeway runs parallel to the Grand River, about to the north. Near Ironwood Drive, I-96 turns southeasterly again and goes through Marne.

Beyond Marne, I-96 passes the western end of M-11 and crosses into Kent County, curving around a rest area for the eastbound lanes. The freeway runs eastward through a light industrial area of the suburb of Walker as it enters the Grand Rapids metropolitan area. At the interchange with Alpine Avenue, M-37 merges onto the freeway and the two run concurrently past the studios for WZZM-TV with its iconic weatherball, a sphere above the ground that uses colored lights to display a weather forecast. Adjacent to the studios are the ramps from eastbound I-96 to southbound US 131 and from northbound US 131 to westbound I-96. These ramps mark the northern end of I-296, an unsigned auxiliary Interstate Highway designation applied to them and the US 131 freeway south to downtown Grand Rapids. I-96 turns northeasterly past a commercial area to a three-quarter cloverleaf interchange that provides all of the other connections with US 131 next to a crossing of the Grand River.
East of the river, I-96 and M-37 pass through the northern suburb of Comstock Park, intersecting Connector M-44 (Conn. M-44, Plainfield Avenue) near Lamberton Lake. Past that interchange, the freeway angles southeasterly and then southward, bypassing Grand Rapids to the northeast. East of downtown, I-96/M-37 meets I-196 (Gerald R. Ford Freeway) at a partial interchange; traffic headed eastbound on I-196 must enter I-96 eastbound and only westbound I-96 traffic may enter I-196. Immediately east of the interchange is another for M-44 (East Beltline Avenue) where M-37 separates from the freeway to turn southward. Through this series of interchanges, I-96 curves to the east and then turns back southward after passing through them. There are two more interchanges for M-21 (Fulton Street) and Cascade Road before I-96 meets the eastern end of M-11 at 28th Street. The next interchange for 36th Street provides access to the Gerald R. Ford International Airport. The freeway continues to the east of the airport and then intersects the eastern end of M-6 (Paul B. Henry Freeway, South Beltline Freeway) at an interchange over the Thornapple River.

===Grand Rapids to Howell===
The freeway exits the edges of the Grand Rapids urban area past the interchange with M-6, turning due east and paralleling the northern edge of Cascade Road. I-96 curves to the south of Pratt Lake near the county line, crossing into Ionia County. Grand River Avenue is the frontage road as the freeway heads east through farm fields. South of Ionia, I-96 intersects M-66. Near Portland, the trunkline turns to the southeast to cross the Grand River again. On the east side of town, the freeway crosses Grand River Avenue, its former business spur into town. I-96 continues southeasterly, crossing into Clinton County and passes the community of Eagle. Entering the western reaches of the Lansing metropolitan area, I-96 merges with I-69 and turns southward at an interchange in the southwestern corner of the county; this interchange also provides access to Business Loop I-96 (BL I-96, Grand River Avenue).
These two Interstates run southward together for about on the west side of the metropolitan area, picking up a third lane in each direction. The exit numbers and mileposts along the concurrency reflect those of I-96, which is considered the dominant designation of the pair. South of that interchange, the freeway crosses into Eaton County and over the Grand River. The trunkline passes near residential subdivisions, and next to the interchange for BL I-69/M-43 (Saginaw Highway), there is a large retail development. Farther south, I-496 (Olds Freeway) branches off to run into downtown Lansing before the split between I-96 and I-69. I-69 turns southward while I-96 turns southeasterly, dropping back to four lanes in total. After the Lansing Road interchange, the freeway crosses the Grand River one last time and runs due east to bypass Lansing.
I-96 crosses into Ingham County and continues along the southern edges of the Lansing metro area. It passes through areas with residential subdivisions and commercial developments, coming to a pair of interchanges including one for the eastern end of BL I-96 (Cedar Street). Near the crossing of the Red Cedar River, I-96 goes through the interchange for I-496/US 127. East of that interchange, the freeway begins to exit the metro area as the landscape transitions back to farm fields. I-96 continues eastward, bypassing Williamston and Webberville to the south. Near the latter, the freeway turns more southeasterly and crosses into Livingston County. In Livingston County, I-96 passes to the south of Fowlerville and then enters the far northwestern edge of Metro Detroit, passing south of Howell. From this point, the freeway expands to six lanes and runs parallel to Grand River Avenue on the southern side of town.

===Metro Detroit===

Near the Livingston County Spencer J. Hardy Airport on the western edge of Howell, I-96 meets M-59, which runs to Pontiac and carries the Howell business loop easterly to Grand River Avenue. The business loop reconnects near Lake Chemung on the east side of town, and I-96 turns further to the southeast. On the northeast side of Brighton, I-96 crosses over Grand River Avenue and the landscape transitions to include residential subdivisions. I-96 proceeds to cross US 23.

I-96 passes through an area with several lakes as it crosses into Oakland County. This area includes the Island Lake State Recreation Area to the south and the Kensington Metropark to the north of the freeway in an area where it crosses the Huron River. The Interstate runs through Wixom into Novi, where it passes to the south of the Twelve Oaks Mall. Southeast of the mall, I-96 enters a complex interchange on the border between Novi and Farmington Hills that connects it to M-5 (Haggerty Connector), I-275 and I-696 (Reuther Freeway). The trunkline drops a lane in each direction as it enters the interchange and turns southward. The freeway then merges into I-275 and increases to four lanes in each direction running south in Farmington Hills.

According to the Federal Highway Administration, I-275 ends at the junction with I-96 and M-14 along the boundary between Livonia and Plymouth Township and not at the interchange in Novi and Farmington Hills. MDOT considers I-275 to extend northward concurrently with I-96 to the Novi and Farmington Hills, and maps from other providers follow MDOT&#x27;s lead and label the freeway north of M-14 as I-96/I-275.

I-96/I-275 runs southward for about before crossing into Wayne County at the interchange with 8 Mile Road near the Meadowbrook Country Club. The freeway curves to the east around Schoolcraft College; then, south of 5 Mile Road, I-96 meets the interchange with M-14 and I-275 where it turns to the east along the Jeffries Freeway. To the north and south sides of I-96 are a pair of service drives named Schoolcraft Road which follow the 4 Mile location on the Mile Road System for Detroit. To the north of the Jeffries are residential neighborhoods, and to the south are commercial or industrial areas. At Inkster Road, the freeway crosses into Redford Township where it intersects US 24 (Telegraph Road) near Eliza Howell Park. East of the park, I-96 enters Detroit.

Past the Outer Drive interchange, I-96 splits into a local-express lanes configuration. There are two carriageways in each direction, and the central ones have three lanes that bypass almost all of the exits while the outer ones have two lanes that have access to each exit. The Jeffries turns southeasterly and separates from Schoolcraft Road shifting to the south. The interchange with M-39 (Southfield Freeway) features slip ramps so that traffic can pass between the local and express lanes. Further east, I-96 turns northeasterly to cross M-5 (Grand River Avenue). I-96 curves over to the interchange with M-8 (Davison Avenue) and the local-express configuration ends as the freeway turns back to the south to cross over Grand River Avenue.
From the crossing south of Davison, I-96 runs parallel to Grand River Avenue southeasterly with eight lanes total. The two run together as far as the interchange with I-94 (Edsel Ford Freeway) near Bishop Park. I-96 turns more south-southeasterly there through residential neighborhoods on Detroit&#x27;s southeastern side. I-96 terminates at an interchange that connects it to I-75 (Fisher Freeway) and to the Ambassador Bridge.

==History==
Interstate 96 was mostly constructed in sections that opened from 1957 to 1962, but it was not completed in the Detroit area until 1977. Even before the National Interstate and Defense Highways Act was signed in 1956, the route was being planned as a replacement of the old US 16, which was decommissioned in the state in 1962.

===Beginnings===

The Muskegon–Grand Rapids–Lansing–Detroit corridor was initially named the Grand River Road, an Indian trail that was designated as a military highway in 1825. The roadway was included as a branch of &quot;Division 2&quot; of the State Trunkline Highway System when that was created in May 1913. When the system was signposted in 1919, the highway was assigned the M-16 designation. Grand River Avenue was the first paved highway across the state when paving was completed in 1926. The entire highway was designated as part of US 16 later that year.
East of Grand Rapids, the highway was a major artery of national importance, and was added to the proposed &quot;Interregional Highway System&quot; as part of a northern route between Chicago and Detroit by the 1940s. A branch from Grand Rapids to Muskegon was added later that decade, and in 1957 the Chicago–Detroit route was labeled as part of I-94, with I-94N on the spur to Muskegon. Michigan, believing that this would &quot;cause considerable confusion to the public&quot;, requested a change in April 1958, which would move I-94 to the shorter Kalamazoo route (which was planned as I-92), make the Muskegon–Detroit route I-96, and assign I-67 to the connection from I-94 to I-96 at Grand Rapids, but this was initially rejected by the American Association of State Highway Officials (AASHO). By mid-1959, Michigan&#x27;s plan had been approved, with one change: I-96 would take the south leg from I-94 at Benton Harbor to Grand Rapids, and the north leg to Muskegon would be I-196.

Construction of the Brighton–Farmington Expressway piece of the US 16 upgrade began in 1956, and, when a piece opened on August 1, 1957, it was the first section of funded Interstate to open in Michigan. The entire freeway from east of Brighton to a bypass of Farmington was completed in December of that year. By early 1959, when signs for I-96 and I-196 were posted, of the &quot;Detroit–Muskegon Freeway&quot; had been completed and marked as US 16. With the opening of from west of Lansing to east of Howell, the entire route, except in the Detroit area, opened for travel on December 12, 1962. US 16 was decommissioned in the state at that time; the portions into Muskegon and Detroit, beyond the ends of the freeway, became separate related highways named Business Spur I-196 (BS I-196) for Muskegon and BS I-96 for Detroit.

In 1963, the Michigan State Highway Department petitioned AASHO to again make the change it had requested back in 1958, moving I-96 over I-196 to end at Muskegon and renumbering I-96 west of Grand Rapids to I-67. The state cited problems with destination signing and numerous complaints from the public about confusion caused by the numbering. At their October 21, 1963, meeting, AASHO approved the relocation of I-96, but rejected I-67, stating that the number should be kept for a more major route in case the system is expanded, and instead assigned I-196 to the not-yet-complete Benton Harbor–Grand Rapids highway. The signage was switched in January 1964. With the scheduled completion of the Lodge Freeway on October 29, 1964, a full freeway route was available from I-96 into downtown Detroit via I-696 and the Lodge, but it would be some time before I-96 was finished into the city.

===Construction of the Jeffries Freeway===
The Detroit Expressway and Transit System plan, prepared in 1945 for the city of Detroit, included a Grand River Expressway, which was to parallel Grand River Avenue into downtown and relieve congestion on that artery. A rail line would be built in the median of the freeway west of West Chicago Street, where streetcars would exit onto the existing surface tracks on Grand River Avenue into downtown. The plan called for a future conversion to rapid transit with a grade-separated route to downtown. The Department of Street Railways determined in 1947 that the operation would cost $6 million per year (equivalent to $/yr in ), and the planned transit line was dropped from the plans. By 1961, the proposed highway was renamed the Jeffries Freeway, after Edward Jeffries, who served as Detroit mayor from 1940 to 1948.
Originally, the route of I-96 from the east end of the existing freeway in Farmington through Detroit, named the Jeffries Freeway (commonly referred to as simply &quot;the Jeffries&quot;), was to closely parallel Grand River Avenue (formerly US 16). However, by 1963, several freeway revolts were taking place in urban locations throughout the country, including Detroit. Several of Detroit&#x27;s planned freeways were modified, scaled back, or outright cancelled. To minimize the impact to existing communities and businesses, it was decided that the Jeffries Freeway would no longer utilize the Grand River Avenue corridor. Instead, the new I-96 freeway corridor would partially use right-of-way from the C&amp;O Railroad through the city of Livonia (ultimately being built over Schoolcraft Road), and utilize the planned I-275 freeway bypassing Detroit to the west to connect back to the existing freeway.

The first piece of the Jeffries Freeway connected the Fisher Freeway (I-75) with the Edsel Ford Freeway (I-94) in 1970. It was extended northwest to Livernois Avenue (exit 188A) in July 1971, and then to Grand River Avenue at Schaefer Highway (exit 185) in 1973. In 1976, the freeway was extended west to the Southfield Freeway (exit 183), and the entire I-275 concurrent section was opened. The final piece was completed on November 21, 1977, connecting the Detroit section to I-275. The I-96 designation was assigned along the I-275 freeway south to the Jeffries Freeway, and eastward along the new freeway to the M-39 interchange; the remaining stub of I-96 around Farmington was redesignated as an extension of M-102 (now M-5).

===Subsequent history===
Since the completion of I-96 in 1977, several changes to the freeway have taken place. Beginning in 1984, an extension of the US 27 freeway (later to become I-69) bypassing Lansing opened; US 27 was then cosigned with I-96 along the western side of Lansing. Three years later, the I-69 designation was applied to this new bypass, resulting in a triple concurrency (I-96/I-69/US 27) that existed until 2002, when US 27 was decommissioned in Michigan.
From 2003 to 2005, the Beck Road interchange (exit 160) in Novi was reconstructed as a single point urban interchange (SPUI), the first in the metropolitan Detroit area and the first on I-96. An interchange between 36th Street and I-96 was built starting in 2005 and was completed in 2006. The project aimed to improve access to the Gerald R. Ford International Airport southeast of Grand Rapids. The reconstruction of the Wixom Road interchange near Novi as a SPUI was completed in late fall of 2008. Another interchange at Latson Road in Howell was approved for construction on July 19, 2012. This interchange was designed to bring improved access to the eastern Howell area, which prior to construction of the Latson Road exit was only accessible from westbound I-96. The project was completed on December 2, 2013. Also in 2013, the two interchanges near Nunica serving M-104 and B-31 were reconstructed, with two ramps removed from the former and two added to the latter; a new partial interchange was also built in preparation of M-231, which opened on October 30, 2015.

On April 5, 2014, MDOT closed I-96 between Newburgh Road and US 24 (Telegraph Road). The project was estimated to cost $148 million (equivalent to $ in ), and would rebuild the of roadway, replace two bridges, and repair 32 other bridges. The department also planned to install new drainage and replace the signs along I-96. The project was expected to be completed in October 2014. Instead, it was finished ahead of schedule, and that segment of I-96 was re-opened on September 21, 2014.

Also in 2015, work began on bypassing the 1960s interchange with US 23 near Brighton. A new set of through lanes was built on I-96 between the previous eastbound and westbound lanes with three new bridges over northbound and southbound US 23, and Old US 23. The existing lanes of I-96 were changed to be collector-distributor lanes for ramp traffic. This project was completed in November 2016.

MDOT started work to add a flex route on I-96 between Kent Lake Road and the I-275/I-696/M-5 interchange in Novi on March 21, 2022. Under this plan, the shoulders of the highway will be available as extra lanes during peak traffic periods, and indicated with overhead light systems. In addition, ramp meters will be installed at ramps onto the freeway. The construction was completed in October 2024, but the flex route will not be operational until 2025.

===Gateway Project===

Beginning on February 25, 2008, MDOT and the Detroit International Bridge Company initiated the Ambassador Gateway Project at the eastern end of I-96. The adjacent section of I-75 closed completely to traffic in both directions to start the complete reconstruction of the road to better connect I-75 and I-96 to the Ambassador Bridge, and the plans included the reconstruction of a mile (1.6 km) of I-96. That segment of I-96 closed on July 14, 2008, and it was scheduled to reopen a month early the following September. The overall project to realign ramps and connect the bridge to the freeways was mired in lawsuits between MDOT and the private company that owns the bridge. The company&#x27;s owner was jailed for contempt of court during court proceedings in early 2012. MDOT was later ordered to assume responsibility for construction, and the department completed the project on September 21, 2012.

===Incidents===
On January 12, 2005, a large multiple-vehicle collision consisting of over 200 motor vehicles occurred on both directions of I-96 near Williamston in Ingham County. Two people were killed in the incident. It was one of the largest collisions in US history and was blamed on heavy fog.

In October 2012, reports of a sniper shooting cars along I-96 in four counties led to a federal investigation and a multi-jurisdictional task force of 100 law enforcement officials. As of October 30, 2012, 25 shootings had been linked to one suspect. The Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, and Crime Stoppers offered a $102,000 (equivalent to $ in ) reward for information leading to the arrest of the perpetrator. The suspect, Raulie Casteel of Wixom, was arrested on November 5, 2012, and ordered to stand trial in 2013 in Oakland County for 60 charges in one case, with a second trial on terrorism and murder charges to be brought by the Michigan Attorney General. On October 30, 2013, the suspect pleaded no contest, but mentally ill, in the Oakland County case, and he was sentenced to serve anywhere from six years and eight months to 10 years in prison on multiple assault charges (as well as two concurrent years on weapons charges) for that case on February 4, 2014. The trial for the Livingston County case began on January 14, 2014, and after being convicted on the terrorism charge, Casteel was sentenced to 16 to 40 years in state prison.

===Auxiliary Interstates===
I-96 has four related, auxiliary Interstate highways that connect the main freeway to downtowns and other cities. I-196 is a relatively long freeway spur, beginning at I-96 east of downtown Grand Rapids and heading west through downtown to Holland, and then south to I-94 near Benton Harbor. The unsigned I-296 connects I-96 north of downtown Grand Rapids with I-196 in downtown, and it is signed as US 131. I-496 is a loop through downtown Lansing, which I-96 bypasses to the south, and I-696 is a northern bypass of Detroit, connecting I-96 in Novi with I-75 in Royal Oak and I-94 in St. Clair Shores.

===Business routes===

There have been six business routes of I-96 in Michigan. There are two business loops designated Business Loop I-96 (BL I-96): one through Lansing and one through Howell. Both follow the old route of US 16, with appropriate connections to I-96. There are three former business spurs that were designated Business Spur I-96 (BS I-96). One connected to the carferry docks in Muskegon, running concurrently with part of Business US 31 (Bus. US 31) along former US 16, but it has been eliminated. The second spur ran into downtown Portland until it was decommissioned in 2007. Two routes in the Detroit area—a loop through Farmington and a spur into Detroit—both using Grand River Avenue, and meeting at the temporary end of I-96 near Purdue Avenue, were eliminated when I-96 was moved to the completed Jeffries Freeway in 1977. The Farmington business route is still state-maintained as an unsigned highway, while the Detroit business route remained unsigned until it was decommissioned in 2016 and replaced by an extension of M-5.

<text>Lychee ( , ; Litchi chinensis; ) is a monotypic taxon and the sole member in the genus Litchi in the soapberry family, Sapindaceae.

There are three distinct subspecies of lychee. The most common is the Indochinese lychee found in South China, Malaysia, and northern Vietnam. The other two are the Philippine lychee (locally called &quot;alupag&quot; or &quot;matamata&quot;) found only in the Philippines and the Javanese lychee cultivated in Indonesia and Malaysia. The tree has been introduced throughout Southeast Asia and South Asia. Cultivation in China is documented from the 11th century. China is the main producer of lychees, followed by India, Vietnam, other countries in Southeast Asia, other countries in South Asia, Madagascar, and South Africa. A tall evergreen tree, it bears small fleshy sweet fruits. The outside of the fruit is a pink-red, rough-textured soft shell.

Lychee seeds contain methylene cyclopropyl glycine which has caused hypoglycemia associated with outbreaks of encephalopathy in undernourished Indian and Vietnamese children who consumed lychee fruit.

== Taxonomy ==

&quot;Litchi chinensis&quot; is the sole member of the genus &quot;Litchi&quot; in the soapberry family, Sapindaceae.

It was described and named by French naturalist Pierre Sonnerat in his account &quot;Voyage aux Indes Orientales et à la Chine, fait depuis 1774 jusqu&#x27;à 1781&quot; (translation: &quot;Voyage to the East Indies and China, made between 1774 and 1781&quot;), which was published in 1782. There are three subspecies, determined by flower arrangement, twig thickness, fruit, and a number of stamens.
* &quot;Litchi chinensis&quot; subsp. &quot;chinensis&quot; is the only commercialized lychee. It grows wild in southern China, northern Vietnam, and Cambodia. It has thin twigs, flowers typically have six stamens, fruit are smooth or with protuberances up to .
* &quot;Litchi chinensis&quot; subsp. &quot;philippinensis&quot; (Radlk.) Leenh. It is common in the wild in the Philippines and rarely cultivated. Locally called &quot;alupag&quot;, &quot;mata-mata&quot;, or &quot;matamata&quot; due to its eye-like appearance when the fruit is opened, it has thin twigs, six to seven stamens, long oval fruit with spiky protuberances up to .
* &quot;Litchi chinensis&quot; subsp. &quot;javensis&quot;. It is only known in cultivation, in Malaysia and Indonesia. It has thick twigs, flowers with seven to eleven stamens in sessile clusters, smooth fruit with protuberances up to .

== Description ==

=== Tree ===
&quot;Litchi chinensis&quot; is an evergreen tree that is frequently less than tall, sometimes reaching . Its evergreen leaves, long, are pinnate, having 4 to 8 alternate, elliptic-oblong to lanceolate, abruptly pointed, leaflets,

The bark is grey-black, the branches a brownish-red. Its evergreen leaves are long, with leaflets in two to four pairs. Lychee are similar in foliage to the family Lauraceae, likely due to convergent evolution. They are adapted by developing leaves that repel water, and are called laurophyll or lauroid leaves.

Flowers grow on a terminal inflorescence with many panicles on the current season&#x27;s growth. The panicles grow in clusters of ten or more, reaching or longer, holding hundreds of small white, yellow, or green flowers that are distinctively fragrant.

=== Fruit ===
The lychee bears fleshy fruits that mature in 80–112 days depending on climate, location, and cultivar. Fruits vary in shape from round to ovoid to heart-shaped, up to 5 cm long and 4 cm wide (2.0 in × 1.6 in), weighing approximately 20 g.

The thin, tough skin is green when immature, ripening to red or pink-red, and is smooth or covered with small sharp protuberances roughly textured. The rind is inedible but easily removed to expose a layer of translucent white flesh with a floral smell and a sweet flavor. The skin turns brown and dry when left out after harvesting.

The fleshy, edible portion of the fruit is an aril, surrounding one dark brown inedible seed that is 1 to 3.3 cm long and 0.6 to 1.2 cm wide (0.39–1.30 by 0.24–0.47 in). Some cultivars produce a high percentage of fruits with shriveled aborted seeds known as &#x27;chicken tongues&#x27;. These fruits typically have a higher price, due to having more edible flesh. Since the floral flavor is lost in the process of canning, the fruit is usually eaten fresh.

== History ==
Cultivation of lychee began in the region of southern China, going back to 1059 AD, Malaysia, and northern Vietnam. Unofficial records in China refer to lychee as far back as 2000 BC. Wild trees still grow in parts of southern China and on Hainan Island. The fruit was used as a delicacy in the Chinese Imperial Court.

In the 1st century during the Han dynasty, fresh lychees were a popular tribute item, and in such demand at the Imperial Court that a special courier service with fast horses would bring the fresh fruit from Guangdong. There was great demand for lychee in the Song Dynasty (960-1279), according to Cai Xiang, in his &quot;Li chi pu&quot; (Treatise on Lychees). It was also the favorite fruit of Emperor Li Longji (Xuanzong)&#x27;s favored concubine Yang Yuhuan (Yang Guifei). The emperor had the fruit delivered at great expense to the capital.

The lychee attracted the attention of European travelers, such as the Spanish bishop, explorer, and sinologist Juan González de Mendoza in his &quot;History of the great and mighty kingdom of China&quot; (1585; English translation 1588), based on the reports of Spanish friars who had visited China in the 1570s gave the fruit high praise:

Later the lychee was described and introduced to the West in 1656 by Michal Boym, a Polish Jesuit missionary (at that time Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth).

Lychee trees were introduced to Jamaica by Chinese immigrants in the 18th century, where the fruit is associated with the Chinese Jamaican community. The fruit is featured in a popular Jamaican cake, called &quot;lychee cake&quot;, which is made of a light sponge cake, cream, and fruit, which has been one of the most popular cakes in Jamaica since its creation by baker Selena Wong in 1988.

Lychee was introduced in the north-western parts of Indian Subcontinent (then British Raj) in 1932 and remained an exotic plant until the 1960s when commercial production began. The crop&#x27;s production expanded from Begum Kot (Lahore District) in Punjab to Hazara, Haripur, Sialkot and Mirpur Khas.

=== Double domestication ===
Genomic studies indicate that the lychee resulted from double domestication by independent cultivation in two different regions of ancient China.

== Cultivation and uses ==

Lychees are extensively grown in southern China, Taiwan, Vietnam and the rest of tropical Southeast Asia, the Indian Subcontinent, and in tropical regions of many other countries. They require a tropical climate that is frost-free and is not below the temperature of . Lychees require a climate with high summer heat, rainfall, and humidity, growing optimally on well-drained, slightly acidic soils rich in organic matter and mulch.

Some 200 cultivars exist, with early and late maturing forms suited to warmer and cooler climates, respectively. In China, eight cultivars are mainly used for commerce. Lychees are also grown as an ornamental tree. The most common propagation method for lychee is through air layering. Air-layers are made by cutting a branch of a mature tree, covering the cut with a rooting medium, such as peat or sphagnum moss, then wrapping the medium with polyethylene film and allowing the cut to root. Once significant rooting has occurred, the layer is cut from the branch and potted.

According to folklore, a lychee tree that is not producing much fruit can be girdled, leading to more fruit production. When the central opening of trees is carried out as part of training and pruning, stereo fruiting can be achieved for higher orchard productivity.

Lychees are commonly sold fresh in Asian markets. The red rind turns dark brown when the fruit is refrigerated, but the taste isn&#x27;t affected. It is also sold canned year-round. The fruit can be dried with the rind intact, at which point the flesh shrinks and darkens.

=== Cultivars ===
There are numerous lychee cultivars, with considerable confusion regarding their naming and identification. The same cultivar grown in different climates can produce very different fruit. Cultivars can also have different synonyms in various parts of the world. Southeast Asian countries, along with Australia, use the original Chinese names for the main cultivars. India grows more than a dozen different cultivars. South Africa grows mainly the &quot;Mauritius&quot; cultivar. Most cultivars grown in the United States were imported from China, except for the &quot;Groff&quot;, which was developed in the state of Hawaii.

Different cultivars of lychee are popular in various growing regions and countries. In China, popular cultivars include Sanyuehong, Baitangying, Baila, Muzaffarpur, Samastipur, Shuidong, Feizixiao, Dazou, Heiye, Nuomici, Guiwei, Huaizhi, Lanzhu, and Chenzi. In Vietnam, the most popular cultivar is Vai Thieu Hai Duong. In the US, production is based on several cultivars, including Mauritius, Brewster, and Hak Ip. India grows more than a dozen named cultivars, including Shahi (Highest Pulp %), Dehradun, Early Large Red, Kalkattia and Rose Scented.

=== Nutrients ===
Raw lychee fruit is 82% water, 17% carbohydrates, 1% protein, and contains negligible fat (table). In a 100-gram (3.5 oz) reference amount, raw lychee fruit supplies 66 calories of food energy. The raw pulp is rich in vitamin C, having 72 mg per 100 grams – an amount representing 79% of the Daily Value – but contains no other micronutrients in significant content (table).

=== Phytochemicals ===
Lychees have moderate amounts of polyphenols, including flavan-3-ol monomers and dimers as major compounds representing about 87% of total polyphenols, which declined in content during storage or browning. Cyanidin-3-glucoside represented 92% of total anthocyanins.

== Poisoning ==
In 1962, it was found that lychee seeds contained methylenecyclopropylglycine (MCPG), a homologue of hypoglycin A, which caused hypoglycemia in human and animal studies.
Since the end of the 1990s, unexplained outbreaks of encephalopathy occurred, appearing to affect only children in India (where it is called &quot;chamki bukhar&quot;), and northern Vietnam (where it was called Ac Mong encephalitis after the Vietnamese word for nightmare) during the lychee harvest season from May to June.

A 2013 investigation by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), in India, showed that cases were linked to the consumption of lychee fruit, causing a noninflammatory encephalopathy that mimicked symptoms of Jamaican vomiting sickness. Because low blood sugar (hypoglycemia) of less than 70 mg/dL in the undernourished children on admission was common, and associated with a poorer outcome (44% of all cases were fatal) the CDC identified the illness as a hypoglycemic encephalopathy.

The investigation linked the illness to hypoglycin A and MCPG toxicity, and to malnourished children eating lychees (particularly unripe ones) on an empty stomach.

The CDC report recommended that parents ensure their children limit lychee consumption and have an evening meal, elevating blood glucose levels that may be sufficient to deter illness.

Earlier studies had incorrectly concluded that transmission may occur from direct contact with lychees contaminated by bat saliva, urine, or guano or with other vectors, such as insects found in lychee trees or sand flies, as in the case of Chandipura virus. A 2017 study found that pesticides used in the plantations could be responsible for the encephalitis and deaths of young children in Bangladesh.

<text>Bridge City is a city in Orange County, Texas, United States. It is 100 miles east of Houston, near the Gulf of Mexico. The population was 9,546 at the 2020 census. The town borders the Neches River and Cow Bayou. It is part of the Beaumont–Port Arthur Metropolitan Statistical Area. The area is mostly known for its association with the petroleum products (oil) industry.

==History==

The city was originally named Prairie View, as it was located on the coastal grasslands of the upper Texas coastline. But in 1938, the Port Arthur-Orange Bridge (now known as the Rainbow Bridge) was built, and the unincorporated area took on the name &quot;Bridge City&quot;. Despite several previous attempts, the city did not incorporate until 1970.

Bridge City got its name from the fact that one has to cross a bridge to enter the city. All three major roads that enter Bridge City—Chemical Road, SH 87, and F.M. 1442—cross a body of water. SH 87 crosses the Neches River and Cow Bayou—Cow Bayou on the Orange side and the Neches River on the Port Arthur side. Chemical Road crosses a branch off of the Sabine River and Cow Bayou. F.M. 1442 crosses a small creek off Cow Bayou between F.M. 105 and the Bridge City City limits. F.M. 1442 also crosses Cow Bayou just north of Orangefield and south of Interstate 10.

In 1990, Bridge City became the first city in Texas to install &quot;leaning&quot; streetlights because of the tall electrical lines near the roadway.

In 2008, the storm surge generated by Hurricane Ike caused nearly complete flooding of Bridge City. Mayor Kirk Roccaforte estimated that only 14 homes in the city were unaffected by the surge. The piles of debris and waterlogged furniture placed outside homes by residents beginning to clean up led the mayor to say &quot;The whole city looks like a flea market.&quot;

==Geography==

According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which is land and (4.63%) is water.

==Natural disasters==
Bridge City, in common with surrounding areas, has had a long history of hurricanes and tropical storms.

=== Hurricane Humberto (2007) ===
Widespread flooding occurred in Jefferson and Orange counties, and at least 20 homes in Beaumont were flooded from Hurricane Humberto. Additionally, several roadways were flooded. The passage of the hurricane caused one fatality in the state; a Bridge City man was killed when his carport crashed on him outside his house. The combination of saturated grounds and strong winds uprooted many trees and downed power lines across the path of the hurricane, with at least 50 high voltage transmission poles blown down or seriously damaged; over 120,000 power customers in Orange and Jefferson counties lost power, with 118,000 Entergy customers in the state without electricity. The National Weather Service estimated gusts exceeded in southwestern Jefferson County and extreme southeastern Chambers County.

===Hurricane Ike (2008)===
Bridge City, Texas was heavily damaged by Hurricane Ike on September 13, 2008. Damage was widespread and severe across Orange County. With over 95 percent of buildings and houses in Bridge City totally gutted, the city was nearly completely destroyed. The storm surge completely flooded the city and obliterated everything in its way. Storm surge breached the levee at the City of Orange, and traveled up the Neches River to flood Rose City. It took three days to drain the water from the city. The city government gutted the city hall due to the Ike damages. The first city council meeting after Ike was held there sometime recent before January 19, 2009. Of the 3,400 houses in Bridge City, 16 were still habitable immediately after Ike.

In the City of Orange, right next to Bridge City, nearly the entire city of 19,000 people was flooded, anywhere from to . The mayor of the city said about 375 people, of those who stayed behind during the storm, began to emerge, some needing food, water and medical care. Many dead fish littered streets and properties. Bridge City Mayor Kirk Roccaforte estimated that only 14 homes in the city were unaffected by the surge. Five of which were in the Oakview addition on Louise Street. The piles of debris and waterlogged furniture placed outside homes by residents beginning to clean up led the mayor to say &quot;The whole city looks like a flea market.&quot; During the post-storm cleanup, Bridge City residents found swimming pools had been occupied by jellyfish brought inland with the water. Three people were found dead in Orange County on September 29.

===Hurricane Harvey (2017)===
Hurricane Harvey was a huge rainfall producer. On the night of August 30, 2017, Bridge City was absolutely inundated with floodwaters, causing widespread damage. The past twenty-four hours had seen over 20 inches of rainfall. By the time Harvey was working its way toward Southeast Texas, it was a slow-moving storm, meaning everywhere in Harvey&#x27;s path would be drenched in rainfall for several days before Harvey moved on.

===Hurricane Laura (2020)===
When Hurricane Laura hit, there was mainly wind damage in Bridge City. Several trees, light poles and traffic lights down due to the violent winds that Hurricane Laura brought. A wind gust of 73 mph was recorded at Port Arthur near Bridge City. The Orange County Airport&#x27;s weather station went out during the storm.
