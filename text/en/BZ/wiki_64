<text>Severn Tunnel Junction railway station () is a minor station on the western side of the Severn Tunnel in the village of Rogiet, Monmouthshire, Wales. It is from London Paddington and lies at the junction of the South Wales Main Line from London and the Gloucester to Newport Line.

The next station to the west is Newport. The next stations to the east are at Pilning in South Gloucestershire (through the Severn Tunnel) and nearby Caldicot (on the Gloucester line).

==History==
The South Wales Main Line was opened through the village of Rogiet in 1850. At this time Rogiet was little more than a church and a farm, and the expansion of the village did not begin until after the opening of the station in 1886.

During construction of the Severn Tunnel, several maps were printed that labelled the new junction as Rogiet Station, although the station was always named &quot;Severn Tunnel Junction&quot; from the time that it opened to the public on 1 December 1886.

The junction system consisted of a five-platform station (four through, and an up facing bay), a railway depot, and a major marshalling yard. The purpose of the yard was to sort coal coming from the South Wales Coalfield to London and the Midlands; while in reverse, it sorted goods in transit from the rest of the UK to South Wales.

The area was bombed during World War II, due to the large goods yard facility, its location on strategic rail routes and its proximity to other target areas such as Bristol and Cardiff. From 1924 to 1966 Severn Tunnel Junction was the terminus of a car transport service through the tunnel to Pilning. The service was made redundant by the opening of the Severn Bridge in 1966.

As a result of reduced coal and industrial production from the mid-1980s from South Wales, and increases in fixed goods formations, Severn Tunnel Junction goods yard and locomotive depot were closed from 12 October 1987 with residual marshalling moving to Newport railway station.

From 2010, Network Rail remodelled the track layout, which in conjunction with resignalling work was due to be completed by 2014. The plan provided improved operational flexibility, reduce maintenance costs and re-instated a fourth through platform. SEWTA invested in improved passenger facilities at the station. The new track layout came into operation on 4 January 2010, with the South Wales Main Line now using platforms 3 and 4, and Gloucester to Newport Line platforms 1 and 2. There are no rail connections between the platforms east of the station as high-speed crossovers have been provided to the west.

== Electrification ==

As with other parts of the South Wales Main Line, the road bridge and footbridge were replaced, with additional clearance above the overhead lines, and with raised and solid parapets to the bridges to prevent vandalism of the equipment. Class 800/802 stock now operates through the station, although no electric services are scheduled to stop here.

==Services==
The station is served by two main routes - Transport for Wales&#x27; to Cardiff Central and via local service and Great Western Railway&#x27;s Cardiff to via Bristol line. Both run hourly on weekdays and Saturdays, albeit with some two-hour gaps on the Chepstow line. In the weekday peaks, certain Cardiff to services also stop here, whilst there is a daily train to . CrossCountry also provides very limited services to/from via Gloucester and Birmingham New Street.

On Sundays, the Bristol to Cardiff service is once again hourly (and runs to/from Portsmouth) whist the Cheltenham service is two-hourly.

In December 2022, the ORR approved Grand Union to commence a new service from Paddington to Carmarthen in partnership with Spanish rail operator Renfe, for which a fleet of new bi-mode trains will be used. The new service is scheduled to commence in December 2024. The service will call at Bristol Parkway, Severn Tunnel Junction, Newport, Cardiff Central, Gowerton and Llanelli en-route to Carmarthen, and will provide Severn Tunnel Junction with direct trains to London, which currently do not call.




==Marshalling yard==

Severn Tunnel Junction Yard was a major marshalling yard for the Great Western Railway in South Wales and the largest on the railway. It was built initially to support domestic coal traffic from the South Wales coalfield to either the Midlands, via the Gloucester line, or else to the Royal Navy dockyards of the south coast, through the tunnel. In later years the yard expanded as a freight classification yard and hump shunting was added. A wagon repair workshop was also built alongside. During the early modernisation era of British Railways in the 1950s the yard expanded. In the 1970s under British Rail though, rail freight moved from wagon load freight, requiring marshalling, to containerisation. As the yard had poor road access, container facilities for the area were built at Newport instead and the yard began to decline in importance. Coal was also worked by block trains directly from the colliery to the power station and no longer required marshalling. The yard closed completely in the mid-1980s. This is often explained as being due to the Miners&#x27; Strike and the closure of deep coal in South Wales, but in fact the decline in small-unit freight was much more significant.

In its heyday, the engine shed employed large numbers of railwaymen, which in turn encouraged the growth of the adjoining village of Rogiet. The first estate houses in Rogiet were owned by the railway and were only rented to railwaymen.

=== Engine sheds ===

To support the marshalling yard, the junction and the need for banking engines on the tunnel line, a large engine shed developed near the station, towards Caldicot. This closed in the mid-1960s with the withdrawal of steam traction. A far smaller diesel traction maintenance depot replaced it, now only needing to support far fewer locos. This was on the other side of the station, towards Undy. The depot codes were 86E and ST. The main engine shed was located to the north east of the railway station, while the goods yards were to the west.

From 1955 to 1974, Class 08 shunters, British Rail Class 14 and 37 locomotives could be seen at the depot.

The steam sheds, their turntable, coaling stage and water tower were demolished in the 1960s. The land remains empty and derelict although it was used as a storage depot for new cars during the 1970s, and more recently as a works yard during the electrification of the South Wales main line.

The goods yards were located on both sides of the running lines, one for each direction, and used hump shunting to sort individual wagons into trains.

<doc id="744454" wikidata="Q7864153" url="?curid=744454" title="UC Davis College of Agricultural and Environmental Sciences">
<text>The College of Agricultural and Environmental Sciences (Ag&amp;E) is one of four colleges of the University of California, Davis. Established in 1922, it offers degrees in 27 undergraduate majors and thirty-three graduate groups (i.e. M.S. and Ph.D.). As of January 2014, the College has been overseen by Dean Helene Dillard.

Davis was founded as the University Farm in 1905, as part of the College of Agriculture at the main campus at Berkeley, but provided only a non-degree vocational program resulting in certificates. In 1922, to shut down agitation by agriculture interests to sever Davis and the entire College of Agriculture from the university, the Regents of the University of California authorized a two-year undergraduate program at Davis. This quickly evolved into a four-year program leading to the degree of bachelor of science in agriculture, which was first awarded in 1926. This is why the college dates its beginnings to 1922, when college-level courses were first offered at Davis. 

In 1952, the College of Agriculture at Davis became independent of the College of Agriculture at Berkeley. Most agriculture-related departments were entirely transferred over the decades to Davis, so that Berkeley&#x27;s original College of Agriculture evolved into an environmental sciences college which also includes a few departments that were never transferred (e.g., nutrition). In 1959, Davis achieved full administrative independence from Berkeley as a general campus of the UC system. 

==Divisions==
The college is organized into three divisions, which are then further subdivided into 22 departments, as follows:

Agricultural Sciences Division
*Animal Science
*Biological and Agricultural engineering
*Entomology
*Nematology
*Plant pathology
*Plant sciences
*Agronomy and Range science
*Environmental horticulture
*Pomology
*Vegetable crops
*Viticulture and Enology

Environmental Sciences Division
*Environmental science and Policy
*Environmental toxicology
:*Founded in 1968, this department offered the first undergraduate degree in environmental toxicology at any university.
*Landscape Architecture
*Land, Air and Water Resources
*Wildlife, Fish, and Conservation Biology
:*This department was started in the early 1970s under the name Department of Wildlife and Fisheries. It was given its current name in the mid-1980s as conservation was becoming an increasingly popular societal issue. Department faculty, cooperative extension specialists, postdoctoral researchers, and graduate students training and studying in fields including ecology, wildlife management, conservation biology, animal behavior, evolution, and population biology. It is home of the Museum of Wildlife and Fish Biology, which houses 60,000 specimens of vertebrates primarily used for teaching and research. Undergraduates may choose the wildlife, fish, and conservation biology major and take a Bachelor of Science.
Human Sciences Division
*Managerial Economics (formally Agricultural and Resource Economics)
*Environmental Design
*Food Science and Technology
*Human and Community Development
*Nutrition

<doc id="744460" wikidata="Q4384874" url="?curid=744460" title="Jumbotron">
<text>A jumbotron, sometimes referred to as jumbovision, is a video display using large-screen television technology (video wall). 

The original technology was developed in the early 1980s by Mitsubishi Electric and Sony, which coined JumboTron as a brand name in 1985. Mitsubishi Electric sold their version of the technology as Diamond Vision. It is typically used in sports stadiums and concert venues to show team statistics, close up shots of an event or even other sporting events occurring simultaneously.The same jumbotron technology is used in outdoor public places, often for advertising purposes (such as Times Square, for example).

==History and development==
The jumbotron was invented in Japan during the early 1980s, but there is a dispute between two rival Japanese companies, Mitsubishi Electric and Sony, over its invention. In 1980, Mitsubishi introduced the first large-scale video board, the Diamond Vision, which was a large screen using cathode-ray tube technology similar to traditional tube televisions. The first demonstration of the technology was during the 1980 Major League Baseball All-Star Game in Dodger Stadium, Los Angeles.

Panasonic had the Astro Vision which was based on Fluorescent Discharge Tubes. These were the only three players in the large-screen industry.

In 1985, the term &quot;JumboTron&quot; was coined by Sony for its large-scale video board. The JumboTron was the brand name for the large-scale video boards originally manufactured by Sony and is recognized as one of the largest non-projection video displays ever manufactured. Sony creative director Yasuo Kuroki, who previously helped create the Walkman, is credited with the development of the JumboTron. It was introduced at the Expo &#x27;85 held in May 1985 at Tsukuba, Ibaraki. It had a display resolution of 450,000 pixels, using a new proprietary Sony technology called the Trini-lite. It was a microprocessor-based light bulb developed by one of Kuroki&#x27;s colleagues, chief Betamax engineer Yuji Watanabe. Trini-lite technology allowed screen clarity and computer control, laying the foundation for the first Sony Jumbotrons.

In December 1986, the San Antonio Spurs unveiled the first indoor arena JumboTron scoreboard at the now-defunct HemisFair Arena.

While the JumboTron and similar large-screen displays are physically large, they ranged from low to medium display resolutions. While the original Sony JumboTron in 1985 had a 450,000-pixel resolution, comparable to standard-definition televisions of that era, certain later models had lower resolutions. The JumboTron at the now-demolished Tampa Stadium in Tampa, Florida, measured 30 ft (9 m) diagonally, with a resolution of only 240x192 pixels, below VHS resolution. Screen size since then varies depending on the venue. The display introduced in 1985 was 40 meters wide by 25 meters tall. Newer, LED-based large screens have resolutions that are an order of magnitude greater than the early JumboTron resolution at a fraction of the cost. For example, the much publicized center-hung video board in the Dallas Cowboys&#x27; AT&amp;T Stadium is 72 feet tall and 160 feet wide (22 m x 49 m), displaying HDTV at 1920 x 1080 resolution, 45 times more pixels.

The largest JumboTron in use was located at SkyDome (now Rogers Centre) in Toronto, Ontario, and measured 10 m tall by 33.5 m wide (33 ft × 110 ft), with a resolution of 672 × 200 pixels, or 134,400 pixels. Its cost was US$17 million; by comparison, a similar-sized LED system sold today would cost around $3 million. The Rogers Centre JumboTron was replaced in 2005 by a Daktronics ProStar as part of a stadium revitalization project.

Sony JumboTron was the first video board ever in Times Square. It remained that way for almost ten years.

== Purpose ==
Originally, JumboTrons solely displayed the scores of the games via numerical displays. This then evolved into instant replays being showcased for the benefit of fans within the stadiums or arena, and in modern day, social media is heavily integrated, with fans being urged to post on various social media platforms to then have their content appear on the JumboTron screen.

Sony JumboTron&#x27;s were the world&#x27;s first mobile screens and concert screens. Big Mo was the first portable video screen and Genesis used the first portable video screens for concert tours in the mid-1990s.

==Specifications of production and design==
Originally, the JumboTron was not an LED display (light-emitting diode display), since blue LEDs were unavailable at the time, and the only green LEDs available were of the traditional yellow-green variety, which were unsuitable for an RGB display. Each display consisted of multiple modules composed of 16 or more small flood-beam cathode-ray tubes (CRTs), each of which included from 2 to 16 pixels composed of red, green, and blue phosphors. Sony displayed one of the earliest versions at the Expo &#x27;85 World&#x27;s Fair in Tsukuba.
Eventually, JumboTron systems adopted LED technology as blue and pure green LEDs were developed. LED-based systems have about ten times the lifespan of CRT-based systems, a key reason for the change.

==Genericized trademark==
Although &quot;JumboTron&quot; was a registered trademark owned by the Sony Corporation, Sony stopped manufacturing the devices under that name in 2001 and the word &quot;Jumbotron&quot; has since become a genericized trademark. An Illinois-based company called Watchfire Signs filed for the US trademark in February 2023.

<text>Thomas d&#x27;Urfey (26 February 1723) was an English writer and playwright. He wrote plays, songs, jokes, and poems. He was an important innovator and contributor in the evolution of the ballad opera.

==Life==
D&#x27;Urfey was born in Devonshire and began his professional life as a scrivener, but quickly turned to the theatre. In personality, he was considered so affable and amusing that he could make friends with nearly everyone, including such disparate characters as Charles II of England and his brother James II, and in all layers of society.

D&#x27;Urfey lived in an age of self-conscious elitism and anti-egalitarianism, a reaction against the &quot;levelling&quot; tendencies of the previous Puritan reign during the Interregnum. D&#x27;Urfey participated in the Restoration&#x27;s dominant atmosphere of social climbing: he claimed to be of French Huguenot descent, though he might not have been; and he added an apostrophe to the plain English name Durfey when he was in his 30s. He wrote 500 songs, and 32 plays, starting with &quot;The Siege of Memphis, or the Ambitious Queen&quot; in 1676. This first play was a failure, but he responded in the following year (1677) with a comedy, &quot;Madam Fickle&quot;, which proved more successful.

His plays include &quot;A Fond Husband&quot; (1676), &quot;The Virtuous Wife&quot; (1680), and &quot;Wonders in the Sun, or, The Kingdom of the Birds&quot; (1706). In 1698 he wrote &quot;The Campaigners&quot; as a reply and satire of Jeremy Collier&#x27;s anti-theatrical scourges. When it was performed Mary Lindsey took the part of the nurse although her major contribution was to sing a comedic ballad. His multi-volume &quot;Wit and Mirth, or Pills to Purge Melancholy&quot;, written between 1698 and 1720, is a collection of songs and ballads. d&#x27;Urfey&#x27;s play &quot;The Injured Princess&quot; is an adaptation of Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Cymbeline&quot;. Durfey wrote widely in a witty, satirical vein, usually from a courtly point of view, and his works are a compendium of comedic ideas with brisk, complicated plots carried out in lively dialogue.

His songs, which were often introduced into his plays, generally fell into three types: court songs, political songs (such as &quot;Joy to Great Caesar&quot;), and country songs—the latter tending to be more than a little bawdy. (&quot;The Fart&quot; was one of his hits; &quot;The Lusty Young Smith&quot; was another.) Over forty different composers set his lyrics to music, including Ed McCurdy and Henry Purcell. Purcell composed music for D&#x27;Urfey&#x27;s play &quot;The Comical History of Don Quixote&quot; (1694), one of the first dramatisations of Miguel de Cervantes&#x27; celebrated novel.

D&#x27;Urfey wrote tunes himself as well, although he admitted that they were not very good. Many of the songs&#x27; lyrics in &quot;Wit and Mirth&quot; are preceded by their melodies written in musical notation. He was a friend of the great essayists Joseph Addison and Richard Steele; but, as was not atypical of the time, he also quarreled energetically with other poets and writers. He wrote parodies, and was parodied in return. He stuttered slightly—except, it was said, when he sang or swore. At one point in his career, a jealous rival would respond to D&#x27;Urfey&#x27;s play &quot;Love for Money&quot; with a parody called &quot;Wit for Money, or, Poet Stutterer&quot;.

D&#x27;Urfey&#x27;s songs met with royal approval. Addison (in &quot;The Guardian&quot;) related that he remembered seeing Charles II leaning on Tom d&#x27;Urfey’s shoulder and humming a song with him. Even William III liked to hear him sing his songs, and as a strong Tory he was sure of the favour of Princess Anne, who is said to have given Tom fifty guineas for a song on the Electress Sophia, then the next heir in succession to the crown.

Although he was poor in his old age, his friends revived &quot;A Fond Husband&quot; in 1713, with a prologue written by Alexander Pope, which seems to have eased his difficulties.

==Death==
He was buried on the day of his death at St James&#x27;s, Piccadilly, in London. His lasting achievement lay in his best songs: 10 of the 68 songs in &quot;The Beggar&#x27;s Opera&quot; were by d&#x27;Urfey.

<text>Novation Digital Music Systems Ltd. is a British musical equipment manufacturer, founded in 1992 by Ian Jannaway and Mark Thompson as Novation Electronic Music Systems. Today the company specializes in MIDI controllers with and without keyboards, both analog and virtual analog performance synthesizers, grid-based performance controllers, and audio interfaces. At present, Novation products are primarily manufactured in China.

==History==

Novation&#x27;s first commercial product, released in 1992, was the Novation MM10, a portable battery-operated keyboard controller with full-sized keys, designed to operate with the Yamaha QY10 music workstation. It was based on a device called the MidiCon, which was never released and was the first hardware controller the company made. The MM10 combined with the QY10 arguably constituted the first completely portable modern music workstation.

In 1993 the company released the Novation Bass Station. Influenced by the Roland TB-303 Bassline, a portable compact synthesiser designed for instrumental accompaniment, the Bass Station used digitally controlled analogue oscillators (DCOs), an LFO, and a filter to replicate the sound of a traditional monophonic twin-oscillator analogue synth.

The core technology of Analogue Sound Modelling (ASM) was introduced in 1995 with the Drum Station, which modelled the Roland TR-808 and TR-909 drum machines using digitally synthesised models of the original waveforms.

Novation&#x27;s first technical director was Chris Huggett, who designed the Wasp and OSCar synthesisers and wrote the operating system for the Akai S1000. While working for Akai, he gave Novation&#x27;s founders advice and support, contributing to the design of the Bass Station and Drum Station – the former featured both the filter and amplifier Huggett had designed for the EDP Wasp – and joining full-time in the mid-1990s to design the Novation Supernova. He was a consultant to the company and was involved in the design of many of the company&#x27;s products, until his death in October 2020.

Supernova, released in 1998, was a 3U rack-mounted polyphonic synthesiser with 16+ note polyphony and multitimbral operation, an important feature being the provision of multiple effects units which could be assigned to each timbre, allowing a much richer sound than had generally been possible with a multitimbral synthesiser. Supernova and its successor, SuperNova II, have been used by a wide range of artists including Orbital, ATB, The Faint, Sin, Jean Michel Jarre and A Guy Called Gerald.

Having produced controllers since the beginning and synthesisers from the early days, the company added USB-based computer audio interfaces and in 2004 produced the X-Station, intended to provide a complete music production environment with the addition of a computer/sequencer, microphone and monitoring. This was followed by MIDI controllers featuring no keyboard at all, but instead offering varying numbers of buttons, pads, control knobs and sliders, all sending MIDI messages. With the introduction of the SL range in 2005, this was complemented by Novation Automap, a software system that automatically detects and maps the controllable parameters of a plug-in or software application and configures the control surface to address them. Automap is no longer supported.
In August 2004, Novation was acquired by Focusrite Ltd. and became a subsidiary named Novation Digital Music Systems Ltd.

A keyboardless MIDI controller, the Novation Launchpad, was launched in 2009 with an 8x8 grid of large illuminated buttons that could be used to trigger sounds, loops, effects and other parameters, initially in conjunction with the Ableton Live music performance application. Launchpad was one of the first grid-based performance controllers and this area expanded over the subsequent period to become a significant aspect of the electronic music hardware market. There are currently 3 variations of the product, the Launchpad, Launchpad Pro, and Launchpad Mini. The Launchpad was out of the top two best Novation makings.

The company expanded into DJ controllers initially with the Novation Dicer in 2010, which consisted of two sets of buttons designed to be attached to a turntable or laptop, and then a full-blown DJ controller in 2011 with Novation Twitch, which differed significantly from then available devices of the type in that it used twin touch-strip controllers instead of the more common turntable emulation, providing additional control capabilities. The product has been discontinued since.

All these different areas of synthesis and control have increasingly combined in Novation products to create hybrid instruments and devices such as keyboard controllers with miniature grid launchers and on board synth and vocoder capability, for example the Ultranova (2011) and Mininova (2012).

Novation synthesisers have been used by a range of electronic acts including drum and bass/Rock group Pendulum, French composer Jean Michel Jarre, Steve Hillier of Dubstar and British group Orbital.

In the track &quot;Triumph&quot; by the rap group Wu-Tang Clan, Novation is referenced by Wu-Tang member RZA.

MM10 (1992) was a battery-powered portable keyboard system for the Yamaha QY10 music workstation. Later updated as the MM10-X.

BassStation (1993: aka BassStation Keyboard) included a pair of digitally controlled analogue oscillators (DCOs) with square, pulse and sawtooth waveforms, plus an LFO with random, triangle and sawtooth waveforms, and replicated the sound of a monophonic twin-oscillator analogue synth for bass and lead lines and synth effects plus MIDI controller data.

BassStation Rack (1994) included dual ADSR envelope shapers, 12/24db per octave filter, oscillator sync, and LFO, DCOs and built-in MIDI/Control Voltage (CV) converter. Users include William Orbit, Biosphere, Massive Attack, Orbital, Apollo 440, Nine Inch Nails, Radiohead, Jimi Tenor, Laurent Garnier, ATB, Sneaker Pimps, Out of Logic and Underworld.

DrumStation (1995) used &#x27;Analogue Sound Modelling&#x27; (ASM), DrumStation included all the sounds of the TR808 and its successor the TR909, and the same tone controls for each sound, including tone, attack, decay, tuning, &#x27;snappiness&#x27; and distortion (depending on the sound). &#x27;

Super BassStation (1997) added an arpeggiator, noise source, ring modulator, an additional LFO bringing the complement to two, a sub-oscillator (an octave below Oscillator 1), analogue chorus and distortion effects, keyboard filter tracking, stereo outputs and panning, enhanced memory, analogue trigger signal output and more to the original design.

Supernova (1998) Polyphonic synth providing a complete multi-effects processor for each of its eight audio output parts – and a total of 56 programmable effects available on all voices all the time. Supernova originally featured 16-note polyphony, later expanded to 20 with a new operating system, and three DCOs with ASM to recreate the classic analogue synth sound. A comprehensive filter provided low-, high- and bandpass filtering with 12, 18 and 24 dB/octave, with resonance and self-oscillation, plus overdrive and key tracking, where the filter tuning could follow the keyboard. Two powerful LFOs and two ring modulators completed the sound modification capabilities and the Supernova specification was rounded out with eight analogue outputs and full MIDI implementation. Supernova and its successor, Supernova II, have been used by Orbital, ATB, The Faint, Sin, Jean-Michel Jarre and A Guy Called Gerald.
Nova (1999) essentially repackaged the Supernova into a desktop performance module based around the same synthesiser engine.

Supernova II (2000) was available in 24, 36 and 48-voice models with additional 12 or 24-voice expansion boards. Available again in a 3U rack-mount format, the Supernova II was also available in a 61-note performance keyboard version with velocity and aftertouch, enabling sound tweaking during live performance. FM synthesis capability was included along with ring modulation, dual analogue inputs and a 42-band vocoder. An 8-part arpeggiator was also on board and in its full version the product offered 8-part multitimbrality and 48-voice polyphony, with 57 and 2304 oscillators running simultaneously.

A-Station (2001) was a cross between the BassStation and the Supernova. With voice architecture was based on the Supernova, A-Station added 8-voice polyphony and a basic FM synthesis engine, reverb and delay, plus a 12-voice vocoder for processing external sounds – which can also be used as an oscillator source and processed via filter and envelopes. An arpeggiator was also provided.

K-Station (2002) was a 2-octave keyboard version of the A-Station with 8-voice polyphony, three ASM oscillators providing a range of waveforms plus FM synthesis and a noise source, a 12-band vocoder, arpeggiator, dual ADSR envelope shapers and two LFOs, reverb and delay effects.

KS Series (2002) – KS4, KS5 and KS Rack – used enhanced versions of the K-Station engine with a range of additional features. The KS4 was a 4-octave keyboard, while the KS5 offered five octaves. Keyboards are semi-weighted and include aftertouch, and all 33 control knobs on the ergonomic control section send MIDI. The KS Series included four-part multitimbral operation with multiple assignable audio outputs, a 14 band vocoder and a separate effects processor for each part.

ReMOTE 25 MIDI controller keyboard (2003) was conceived in 2003 to bring back &quot;hands on&quot; tweaking to the computer musician. In addition to the ReMOTE 25, which was MIDI based, the ReMOTE 25 Audio provided the same facilities with the addition of a built-in USB audio interface and later developed into the X-Station. The ReMOTE keyboards were originally developed as controllers for &quot;Propellerhead Reason&quot;.

V-Station and B-Station (2003). These software products, still available as of January 2017, provide virtual emulations of the K-Station and Bass Station respectively. Both are available for Macintosh and Windows platforms, in both VST and AU formats.

X-Station (2004) was designed to create a complete music-making environment by adding a computer/sequencer, microphone and monitoring. Supernova class 8-voice ASM-based synth engine, template-based ReMOTE style MIDI control and a 2-in, 2-out stereo audio interface and multi effects engine plus semi-weighted aftertouch keyboard.

ReMOTE Zero SL (2006) was an addition to Novation&#x27;s MIDI and USB controller range – most of which feature keyboards – with no (zero) keys. What the Remote Zero SL did offer was an enormous selection of knobs, buttons, sliders and trigger pads that could all be freely assigned to virtually any hardware device or application that supports MIDI. At the heart of the Remote SL range was Automap, which detects the sequencer in use and the software plugin instruments used in the project. It then intelligently and logically maps the software&#x27;s controls to the controller&#x27;s host of rotary controls, slider and push buttons.

Nio 2|4 (2007) was a multi-platform compact 2-in, 4-out USB audio interface aimed at musicians in general and guitarists in particular, bundled with a specially selected complement of 20 software effects in the Nio FX Rack application, controlled from the unit&#x27;s front panel, which resembled a guitar effects pedal.

XioSynth (2007) was a keyboard synthesiser with USB audio interface and template-based MIDI controller, available in 25- or 49-key versions. Like the X-Station, it featured Novation&#x27;s X/Y touchpad (the &#x27;X-Pad&#x27;) and included a synth engine based on that in the X-Station with the addition of filter overdrive and the X-Gator patch programmer, which can be configured to gate each patch to create 16-32-step rhythmic patterns synchronised to MIDI clock.

Nocturn (2008) takes the Automap technology from the Remote SL range and applied it to a compact controller. Utilising the automation frameworks used by various plugin architectures such as VST, Audio Units and RTAS, Nocturn downloads a list of controllable settings provided by a plug-in and assigns them to its combination of knobs and buttons. Eight touch-sensitive rotary shaft encoder controls with a ring of LEDs around each to indicate its setting; touch-sensitive crossfader; and a Speed Dial knob allowing patch selection and the ability to control any on-screen parameter.

The SL ReMOTE range was updated (2008–2009) to SL ReMOTE Mk II to include touch-sensitive knobs and sliders and Automap technology. SL MkII controllers were available with 25, 49 and 61 note velocity/aftertouch keyboards. Included eight rotary shaft encoders. Version with no keyboard was named ZeRO SL Mk II.

Launchpad (2009) is a multi-button controller for the popular live control application Ableton Live, featuring a grid of 64 (8x8) brightly illuminated square buttons. Each button can be assigned to a Clip – a piece of audio or MIDI that may or may not be looped. Additional modes allow Automap control of features and mixer control.

Nocturn 25 and 49 (2009) were essentially the Nocturn rotary encoder-based controller with the addition of a 25- or 49-note velocity/aftertouch keyboard.

Automap for iPhone and iPod Touch (2009) is an app providing basic remote control of DAWs, effects, sequencers or plug-in parameters using two faders and eight buttons on an iOS device.

Dicer (2010) consists of a pair of hardware button sets – five large operational buttons and three mode select buttons – designed to attach to the corners of a turntable or laptop and allow users of DJ applications such as Traktor and Serato the ability to control loops, cues and effects.

UltraNova (2010) is a &#x27;Nova&#x27; series USB bus-powered single-part analogue-modelling synthesizer with an effects processor based on the Supernova II synth engine plus wavetable synthesis, enhanced filters, a software editor and a new touch-sense performance mode. Up to 18 voices, 14 filter types, 36 wavetables, and 5 effect slots, 37 full-sized keys and aftertouch, a 12-band vocoder and 2-in 4-out USB interface.

Twitch (2011) is a DJ controller with touchstrips instead of turntable emulators to navigate tracks, slice up beats and mix them back together on the fly. Includes a built-in audio interface. Originally developed in collaboration with Serato.

Impulse (2011) is a range of professional USB/MIDI controllers combining a 25-, 49- or 61-note precision semi-weighted aftertouch keyboard with a control surface providing DAW control including mixer, transport and plug-in instruments and effects powered by Automap control software. Impulse also has 8 back-lit performance pads that can trigger drums, effects, and launch Live clips.

MiniNova (2012) is a micro synth with 37-note keyboard based around the same synth engine as the UltraNova, capable of creating and editing sounds with up to 18 voices and effects. The VocalTune function can recreate iconic urban and hip hop vocal sounds, as well as classic house and techno voice effects with the onboard vocoder. MiniNova is a live synthesiser allowing sounds to be tweaked and modified in realtime. A range of free soundpacks created by eminent artists and sound designers including Chuckie, Ultimate Patches and more are available for download.

Launchkey (2013) is a range of 25, 37, 49 and 61 note keyboard controllers with up to 50 physical controls including 16 velocity-sensitive multi-colour launch pads that trigger clips and launch scenes in Ableton Live. As well as enabling hands-on control of a DAW mixer, instruments and more, Launchkey is an integrated software/hardware instrument with two apps for iPad: the Launchkey app and the Launchpad app, plus the V-Station &amp; Bass Station synth plug-ins for Mac and Windows.

Launchkey app includes 60 synth sounds that can be changed instantly using interactive graphics. The Launchpad app is an app for iPad that makes it possible to create beats and music using an extensive selection of high quality loops and sounds can be combined in the multicolour 8x6 Launchpad grid. Eight volume sliders allow quick volume changes and FX modes offer DJ effects such as beat-repeaters and synced filter effects.

Launchpad S (2013) is an updated and brighter version original LaunchPad with faster flicker, response rate and brighter buttons.

Bass Station II (2013) is a re-working of the original concept with two filters, three oscillators, patch save and a fully analogue effects section and signal path. It includes a step-mode sequencer, arpeggiator, a dual octave (25-note) velocity-sensitive keyboard with full-sized keys, and a comprehensive modulation section. There&#x27;s also full MIDI I/O and USB connectivity. AFX Mode, added with firmware v4.14 allows for modification of patches on a key-by-key basis. A variety of free &amp; paid sounds by Ultimate Patches are available for download.

Launchpad Pro, Launchpad MkII, Launchpad Mini, and Launchpad Mini MkII (2015) are other updated versions of the Launchpad. Launchpad Pro and Launchpad MkII introduce a new RGB feature, Launchpad Pro has velocity and aftertouch sensitivity, 16 more side buttons, and standalone external MIDI I/O mode. As well as a setup mode

Circuit (2015) is a multi-part groovebox sequencer, featuring two synth engines (derived from the MiniNova) and a four part sample based drum machine. It consists of a 4x8 sequencer/note grid, 8 knobs and is battery-powered.

Peak (2017) is a digital / analogue hybrid synthesizer with a unique oscillator architecture designed by Chris Huggett, based on FPGA technology. The Peak has eight voices of polyphony: three FPGA oscillators per voice plus an independent noise source. While the oscillators are digital, the filter is analog, as are the distortion circuits (consisting of pre- and post-filter overdrive and a separate overdrive affecting the composite output).

Circuit MonoStation (2017) is an Analogue Paraphonic Synthesizer in the Circuit family. It uses a similar 4x8 grid but has more control knobs for specific parameters of the synth engine. Its two oscillators can be sequenced together or used paraphonically (a variation on Duophony, where each oscillators pitch can be played separately, but uses only one master amp envelope).

Launchpad X (2019) is an updated version the launchpad Mk2 line-up, featuring 16 squared off edge buttons. the 64 main buttons which have become velocity and pressure sensitive.

<text>Harry Ferguson Research Limited was a British company founded by Harry Ferguson who was mostly known as &quot;the father of the modern farm tractor&quot;. He was also a pioneer aviator, becoming one of the first to build and fly his own aeroplane in Ireland, and also went on to develop four-wheel drive systems for cars including pioneering their use in Formula One racing cars. The company was based in Siskin Drive, in Coventry, England.

== History==
In the 1930s, racing driver Freddie Dixon began to develop the idea of producing a super-safe family car, with four-wheel drive and four-wheel steering. When Dixon was racing in the Ulster TT, he met Harry Ferguson, who garaged his car for him. Ferguson had developed the Ferguson System of tractor implements for reasons of safety and Dixon&#x27;s ideas interested him. Army officer and racing driver Tony Rolt, who had engaged Dixon to maintain his ERA racing car became interested in Dixon&#x27;s ideas and between them formed Dixon-Rolt Developments Ltd.

After the war, Rolt and Dixon persuaded Harry Ferguson to invest money in their company. Ferguson had sold out Massey-Harris, which became Massey Ferguson. He had also won a substantial lawsuit for patent infringement with the Ford Motor Company in the US and now had money to invest.

In 1950, Harry Ferguson Research Ltd. was formed, with premises in Redhill, Surrey. Ferguson was chairman and Rolt and Dixon were directors. The plan was to design a four-wheel drive family car and sell the manufacturing rights to a big car maker. Ferguson moved the business to his premises in Coventry, a move which Dixon resisted and he left the company. Soon after, Ferguson broke with Massey Ferguson and eventually built new premises for Harry Ferguson Research Ltd at Siskin Drive, Coventry. Despite huge efforts, nobody was interested in the cars.

To promote the company&#x27;s technology, Tony Rolt set in motion the development of a Coventry-Climax powered 4WD Formula One car in 1960.

Despite the death of Ferguson in 1961, the Ferguson P99 was raced during the 1961 season in UK F1 races by Rob Walker&#x27;s team. The car raced only once in the World Championship at the British Grand Prix. However the car won a non-championship race, the 1961 International Gold Cup at Oulton Park with Stirling Moss as the driver. As of today, this is the only victory of a four-wheel drive car in F1 (and incidentally the last race won by Moss in Europe), with the technology banned in 1983. Despite its promising beginnings this front-engined car was soon made obsolete by mid-engined cars.

Ferguson Research went on in racing, supplying the Novi-powered P104 to the STP team for Indianapolis. In 1964 the Ferguson P99, by then fitted with a 2.5 litre Climax engine, was lent to Peter Westbury who used it to win the British Hillclimb Championship that year. Westbury built two 4WD sports racing cars, Felday 4, powered by a BRM V8 and Felday 5, powered by a 7-litre Holman Moody Ford V8. In 1964, Harry Ferguson research built a Novi-powered car for the Indianapolis 500 for Andy Granatelli&#x27;s STP team, the 4WD Formula One BRM P67 car for BRM  in 1964, provided the 4WD system for the Lotus 56 turbine Indy car and 56B turbine Formula 1 car.

===Ferguson Formula 4WD===

Soon after Ferguson&#x27;s death, his son-in-law Tony Sheldon took over the chairmanship of Harry Ferguson Research and changed the company policy to one of developing 4WD systems that could be adopted by car makers for their own models. Jensen Motors took up the idea, stretching the Interceptor by 5 in (130 mm) to create the FF (for &quot;Ferguson Formula&quot;, Ferguson&#x27;s term for 4WD). It appeared in 1966. The high cost of its hand-built 4WD system kept it from being a commercial success. The company also converted a number of Ford Mustangs to 4WD with the aim of getting Ford in the US to make them as a production model. In 1969 the company converted a fleet of   Ford Zephyr MkIV police vehicles for assessment by the UK government, with interests in possible military use.

In 1968, GKN took a stake in the company, with the intention of mass-producing 4WD systems for production cars. The first company to be interested was Ford of Britain, who. examined the idea of a 4WD Capri. Production issues prevented a 3-litre 4WD model from being manufactured.

In 1969, there was a 4WD boom in F1 with the top teams of the era, with  Matra, Lotus and McLaren, building 4WD cars. Only Matra used the Ferguson system. (Cosworth also built a 4WD car but using their own system). The 1968 seasons had seen many wet races and the constructors were searching for means to increase the grip of the cars. The 1969 British Grand Prix, saw a record number of four 4WD cars entered, with John Miles in a Lotus 63 achieving the best finish of 10th.  Tyre technology had vastly improved and 1969 also saw the introduction of wings in F1 and as there was no wet race that year, all the competitors ceased developing 4WD F1 cars as wings appeared as an easier way to increase grip. 4WD no longer presented any advantage in F1, if it ever did. Team Lotus made a last attempt with the Ferguson system on the gas turbine powered Lotus 56B in 1971, but the car was uncompetitive. Eventually, in 1971, Tony Sheldon decided that too much money had been pumped into research with no real result and closed down Harry Ferguson Research Ltd

Tony Rolt was convinced of 4WD&#x27;s future in road cars and in 1971 formed a new company called FF Developments  to develop Ferguson&#x27;s four-wheel drive systems.

<doc id="744478" wikidata="Q629479" url="?curid=744478" title="Tehuantepec">
<text>Tehuantepec (, in full, Santo Domingo Tehuantepec) is a city and municipality in the southeast of the Mexican state of Oaxaca. It is part of the Tehuantepec District in the west of the Istmo Region. The area was important in pre-Hispanic period as part of a trade route that connected Central America with what is now the center of Mexico. Later it became a secondary capital of the Zapotec dominion, before it was conquered by the Spanish in the early 16th century.

The city is still the center of Zapotec culture in the Isthmus of Tehuantepec and is the second largest in the region. The city is known for its women and their traditional dress, which was adopted by Frida Kahlo. Tehuantepec has a reputation for being a matriarchal society. Women dominate the local markets and are known to taunt men. However, political power is still the domain of men. 

The city experienced a short economic boom in the early 20th century related to a rail line that was built linking the two oceans, but it was soon eclipsed by the Panama Canal. The project, however, has revived since 2018, as the Mexican government has worked on the rehabilitation of the line and other projects related to it, in a project known as the Interoceanic Corridor of the Isthmus of Tehuantepec.

==Description and history==
Tehuantepec is the second largest city on the Isthmus of Tehuantepec in the south of Mexico. Founded by the Zapotecs in the period just before the arrival of the Spanish in the 16th century, Tehuantepec remains the center of Zapotec culture in the Isthmus. One important symbol of this culture is the image of a Zapotec woman from the area called La Tehuana. In the 2000s, a sculpture of this figure was created by Miguel Hernández Urbán from the State of Mexico. The sculpture is found at the main entrance to the city of Tehuantepec, made of local marble and fine wood along with stainless steel brought from Mexico City. The work made Hernández an &quot;adopted son&quot; of the city. The city remains home to many traditions and customs which are centuries old, with many, especially in the market, still favoring the Zapotec language over Spanish. The city reached its height in the early 20th century with the arrival of the railroad. However, since then the importance of this railroad had severely diminished by the building of the Panama Canal. Today the city is considered to be poor, with many of its buildings in disrepair. Many survive on subsistence commerce. Many motorcycle taxi operators in Tehuantepec and other cities in Oaxaca are underage, between 13 and 15. The city also has had problems with stray dogs including an incident when about twenty dogs took over the main entrance. 

Despite the circumstances, the government of Andrés Manuel López Obrador revived the railroad and started working on its rehabilitation, as part of the project known as Interoceanic Corridor of the Isthmus of Tehuantepec (abbreviated in Spanish as CIIT), modernizing the railroad line and planning the construction of 10 industrial parks across the Isthmus of Tehuantepec. The project has often been described as a potential &quot;competitor&quot; to the Panama Canal, but the project&#x27;s administration believes it will work as a &quot;complement&quot; to it. Though the project has raised some controversy over environmental and other such social issues, it is expected to contribute to the country&#x27;s economic growth and the industrial development of the South of Mexico. It is planned to open for passenger operations in December 2023 and for other related works to be completed by July 2024.

Tehuantepec and nearby Juchitán have had a fierce rivalry dating back to the 19th century. In 1862, Napoleon III sent French troops to collect on debts Mexico owed. Those Frenchmen allied themselves with local Mexican conservatives who allowed them to occupy the Isthmus area. Both Juchitán and Tehuantepec resisted the occupation until a captain in Tehuantepec switched sides. When the Juchitecos learned of this, they attacked Tehuantepec, suffering a defeat. Four year later, this same captain attacked Juchitán but was defeated as well. After the French left in 1862, Juchitán attacked Tehuantepec as a personal vendetta. Although there has been no blood shed since then, the rivalry and competitive attitudes have carried into modern times. Each has tried to outdo the other in festivals in both quantity and quality. The two communities mock one another in looks, hairstyles and clothing.

The center of the city has colonial era constructions such as the Santo Domingo Monastery from the 16th century, which is also the main cathedral. The former monastery part of the cathedral complex houses the Casa de Cultura or cultural center. The monastery was remodeled for this purpose at a cost of 50,000 pesos, mostly to rehabilitate walls and ceiling vaults. This Casa de Cultura houses the Museo de Antropología e Historia Zapoteca del Istmo, which contains archeological and artistic artifacts from the region. The museum has halls dedicated to archeology, ethnographic studies, the history of the Mexican Revolution and the Reform War, as well as items related to religion, regional dress, housing and folk art. It also has a library.
The municipal palace was built during the railroad boom in the early 20th century. Covering an entire side of the main plaza, it today towers over the other buildings in the center. It is built in provincial Neoclassical style with massive columns and arches. However, the back of the structure is very different, as it is an irregular pattern of brickwork, which looks like it has half collapsed. In reality, the structure was never completed. Since 1906, the city has promised to finish the building, but never has. Even the federal government in 1975 announced plans to not only finish the building but restore many of the churches and plazas, but they never came to fruition.

===Tehuantepec market===

The most important institution in the city is the market. There are four traditional markets with the most important of these located just off the main square. The main market building was built by the city in 1970, with booths in this market now worth as much as $30,000 pesos. The owners of the booths pay a small trust fee which is used for public works projects. These are supplemented by tianguis markets in the Guichivere neighborhood on Wednesdays and one in Reoloteca neighborhood on Sundays. The market is the center of nearly all commerce in the city, with 95% of the goods small enough to carry sold there. As a result, the city lacks department, electronics, clothing, jewelry and other types of stores.
====Tehuanas====

The city&#x27;s markets are dominated by women, known as Tehuanas, who make up nearly all of the buyers and sellers. Until the 1970s, there was a complete ban on men in this area, but this was relaxed at that time. Today still it is estimated that less than five percent of the people seen in the market are men. The historical reason for this is that traditionally women worked in the markets as men worked in the fields. Today still, men in the market can be subjected to taunts by the women who question their masculinity. The dominance of women in the markets, and the city in general in the daytime, made the city an interest starting in the 19th century. The writings of French traveler and historian Brasseur de Bourbourg and later by Mexican educator José Vasconcelos described Tehuantepec as a &quot;matriarchial society&quot;. Later writings went as far as stating that the birth of a daughter was cause for celebration and men turned over their wages over to women. This depiction of the women of Tehuantepec focused on three factors: their dominance in the markets; their unreserved manner, often ridiculing men publicly; and that they bathed partially nude in the local river. 

In the early 20th century, painter Frida Kahlo (1907–1954) adopted Tehuana traditional dress in solidarity with these women and depict Tehuana traditional dress in paintings such as &quot;Memory, the Heart&quot;. Much of the Tehuanas&#x27; dominance, however, seems to be limited today to the market and to household finances. They earn money primarily through commerce and have the right to use this income as they wish, regardless of what their husbands or other family members say. Men dominate municipal politics, however, in Tehuantepec and other areas in the southern Isthmus. Women may participate in strikes, protests and other political movements but do not generally hold positions of power such as municipal president or council member. Even when they do, they hold less powerful portfolios usually related to education and health.

The role model for Tehuana women was a woman by the name of Juana Cata Romero who lived in the late 19th and early 20th century. She began as a humble candy seller, but rose to become a local power broker and one of the most revered figures in the city. Romero rose to prominence by befriending a young soldier, then Lieutenant Colonel Porfirio Díaz. Díaz was charged with guarding the town against plots and rebellions by Conservatives during the Reform War. Juana Cata allied herself with Díaz&#x27;s cause by signaling opportune times to attack Conservative forces. Juana became head of Díaz&#x27;s intelligence service as well as his lover for four decades, although both married others. The alliance made Juana the richest and most powerful woman in Tehuantepec, owning various sugar and coconut plantations and even the Isthmus of Tehuantepec railroad was built to pass by her house.

Romero&#x27;s house remains in Tehuantepec, which was the only two-story structure in the town when it was built. It was designed to look like a French chalet with north and west wings that come off of a circular entryway. The structure stands out from the surrounding 18th-century Spanish architecture around it.

The city constructed a bronze statue of Romero but it is controversial. The statue depicts a stern, conservatively dressed woman holding an open book. Many claim the statue is a misrepresentation. The plinth notes her works of charity in her later years, but the real reason she is admired is that she amassed her wealth and power using her looks and shrewdness, considered a Tehuana trait.

==Velas==

The rest of the city is divided into fifteen neighborhoods called barrios, each of which has its own church. Each of these churches have their own patron saint, which is celebrated each year during an event called a &quot;vela.&quot; Velas are celebrations of pre-Hispanic origin which occur in each neighborhood in the Isthmus area which consist of processions in the main streets and the offering of a ceremonial candle to the patron saint. Each of the &quot;velas&quot; are organized by a mayordomo and includes a &quot;queen&quot; who is crowned with flowers. These velas became annual events starting in the 19th century with European elements such as balls or dances added. These dances have fabrics for decoration, like in Europe in the 19th century, but these have been modified with include indigenous designs, many laboriously embroidered by hand. For these and other special events, women may wear traditional Tehuana dress, which consists of heavily embroidered garments accessorized with large amounts of gold jewelry. This jewelry often contains old, gold bearing coins and gold filigree earrings. In addition, local specialties such as various mole sauces such as negro, rojo, amarillo, coloradito, chichilo as well as tasajo, fresh corn quesadillas and tamales are served. While they began as religious festivals, today, most have lost their religious basis. Most of these velas occur in the summer. The vela of Santa María Reoloteca occurs between 13 and 18 August. The Vela of Guiexoba occurs at the beginning of the year. The neighborhood is divided into north and south into a friendly rivalry of who can bring the best musicians from various parts of the state. In addition there are citywide velas such as the Vela Tehuantepec on 26 December, but the most important is the Vela Sandunga at the end of May.

The Vela Sandunga celebrates a song called La Sandunga, which is considered to be the region&#x27;s anthem, learned by all in the region. The lyrics were written by Maximo Ramon Ortiz in 1853, and honors Tehuantepec women. Ortiz supported the separation of the Isthmus area from the Mexican government to form the Territorio Libre del Tehuantepec and wrote the song in part to promote the idea of a separate Tehuantepec identity. The music is thought to be based on a melody from Andalucia and rearranged by Zapotec musician Andres Gutierrez or Ndre Sa’a, his name in Zapotec. It is considered to be a &quot;mestizo&quot;song because it contains both European and indigenous elements.

To commemorate the song&#x27;s creation, there is a large festival that lasts a week. It includes parties, and presentations of musicians from the Conservatoire de Paris, which has a similar festival in honor of the opening of the opera &quot;La Traviata&quot; by Giuseppe Verdi. It also includes the election of a festival queen and a parade dedicated to the evolution of Tehuantepec traditional dress. The event ends with a procession in honor of Saint Dominic, the patron saint of the Isthmus.

==The municipality==

As the municipal seat, the city of Tehuantepec is the local governing authority for about 120 communities, which together cover an area of 965.8 km2. The main communities of the municipality outside the city proper are Concepción Bamba, Morro Mazatán, San José El Paraíso, Santa Cruz Bamba, Santa Isabel de la Reforma, Aguascalientes de Mazatán, Buenos Aires, Colonia Jordán, Guelaguechi, Las Cruces, Potrero de Carballo, Potrero de San Miguel Tenango, Rincón Moreno, San Francisco, San Juan Zaragoza, Santa Gertrudis Miramar, Zanjón y Garrapatero, Cajón de Piedra, Pishishi, San Vicente Mazatán, Santa Clara, Santa Cruz Hidalgo, Colonia San Luis, El Limón, La Noria, San Andrés Villa Zapata, Santa Rita and Ejido El Jordán. It borders the municipalities of Santa María Jalapa de Marqués, Santa María Mixtequilla, Magdalena Tlacotepec, San Pedro Huamelula, San Miguel Tenango, Magdalena Tequisistlán, San Pedro Comitancillo, San Blas Atempa and Salina Cruz with the Pacific Ocean to the south. The municipal government consists of a municipal president, two &quot;sindicos&quot; and 17 officials called regidores.

As of 2005, the municipality had a total of 13,555 homes, with almost all owned by their residents. Flooring varies from packed earth to brick and cement with walls of adobe, brick and block and with roofs of tiles or concrete slabs. As of 2005, there were just over 5,300 people who spoke an indigenous language, out of a total population of just over 55,000. The Pan-American Highway passes through the municipality, connecting it to Salina Cruz. Another highway connects it to Coatzacoalcos.

Major elevations include El Zacatal (1,040 masl), Cerro de la Marimba (1,257 masl), Guiengola (1,257) and Tecuani (700 masl). Within the city proper there are a number of hills which carry names such as El Tigre (Dani’i Guie Be’edxe in Zapotec), Crux Padre López, El Zopilote, Vixhana and La Cueva. All of these are under 425 meters above sea level. There one river with the same name, which cuts through the city. Its Zapotec name is Guigu Roo Guisii. This rivers starts in the Miahuatlán Sierra and empties into the Pacific Ocean at La Ventosa in Salina Cruz. The climate is hot and humid with rains in spring, summer and fall. It can be windy at times with prevailing winds blowing north to south or vice versa. The vegetation is mostly deciduous with guanacaste, oak, guirisiña, granadillo (Rhamnus alaternus), mango, chicozapote, hierba de cancer (Cuphea procumbens) and others dominating. Wildlife includes deer, armadillos, rabbits, eagles, quail and mimus.

==History==

The full name of the city and municipality is Santo Domingo Tehuantepec. &quot;Tehuantepec&quot; comes from Nahuatl and has been generally regarded to mean &quot;wild animal (tecuani) hill (tepec)&quot;. The name was given to the area by the Aztecs, purportedly because of the ferocity of the native Zapotec warriors they encountered there. The Zapotec name for the area is Guie-Ngola, or Large Hill/Rock, with the city name being Guisi’si Gui. Santo Domingo was added by Bartolomé de las Casas as he passed by in honor of the Dominican church was had already been established here. From pre-Hispanic times, the settlement has been represented by an Aztec glyph, the earliest example of which comes from the Guevea Codex, also known as the Zapotec Codex. This glyph represents a hill with a jaguar, an ancient totem animal throughout Mesoamerica. Thus, the &quot;wild animal&quot; component of the hill&#x27;s name may actually be related to a recognition of an ancient religious meeting site associated with the symbol of the jaguar. The Nahuatl word &quot;tehuan&quot; actually means &quot;among the people&quot; or &quot;a gathering&quot;, i.e. a meeting place.

The hill is divided into sixty-six parts and each part has a circle.

The archeology of the area around the city is little studied, in part because the main archeological sites are difficult to access and the climate of the southern Isthmus makes excavation work difficult. Much of the area&#x27;s early cultural interactions are only speculated about but it is known there was contact with Teotihuacan, Tula, Monte Albán and later, Tenochtitlan. The Tehuantepec area in the very early Pre-Classic period was on the periphery of the zone where the Olmecs had influence as is noted by artifacts. The area&#x27;s initial importance was not as a center of a dominion but rather as part of a trade route which connected Central America with what is now central Mexico. Through its trade routes passed manta rays, jade, other precious stones, shells, sponges, gold, amber, salt, feathers, furs, cotton, spices, honey and cocoa. The main control point for this trade route in this area was most likely Lass Gui’e’e, according to recent excavations. This site has a history of at least 3500 years with figures of Olmec and Chiapas origin found in its oldest sections. This and the abundance of marine shells indicate that this site in the Cañada de Tehuantepec was the main axis of communication between the Oaxacan highlands the Isthmus of Tehuantepec and into Guatemala since early in Mesoamerican history.

The Zapotec kingdom of Zaachila expanded into the Tehuantepec area under Cosijoeza starting in 1487, pushing the native Huaves to the narrow coastal strips around the Tehuantepec lagoons. With this, the Zapotecs gained control of the salt deposits of the area, which was a valuable commodity. Tehuantepec became a second Zapotec capital. This dominion had relations with the Aztecs but did not pay tribute and controlled the trade route to Central America. The influence of this dominion extended west to Nexapa and along the coast to Tlapanatepec. Tequixixtlan and Xallapan were subordinate dominions, ruled by governors sent from Tehuantepec. Tehuantepec increased in importance as the original capital of Zaachila came under pressure from the Mixtecs and later from the Aztecs by the end of the 15th century. The Aztecs’ interest here was the control the trade route between the Mexican Plateau to Soconusco in Chiapas and into Guatemala. The Aztecs attacked Tehuantepec in 1496, and it was defended by an alliance of Mixtecs and Zapotecs. These two groups normally fought each other, but allied in the face of the foreign threat. This and the city&#x27;s formidable defenses led to a seven-month siege under Aztec ruler Axayacatl. The next Aztec chief Ahuitzotl, decided to marry his daughter Coyolicatzin to the Zapotec king Cosijoeza. This ended the war.

At the time of the Conquest and for some time after, the area was dominated by three linguistic groups, Zapotec, Mixe and Chontal, which are unrelated. The Zapotecs occupied the area from the Sierra Madre del Sur and Xallapan up to Tehuantepec. The Chontales were found between Mazatlán and Tequixixtlan. The Mixes occupied the high mountain areas, centered in Utlatepec.

Cosijoeza&#x27;s son Cosijopii became the ruler of Tehuantepec shortly before the arrival of the Spanish in 1518. Pedro de Alvarado made two incursions from the west in 1522 arriving to the Mixe area of Ultatepec and Xoconochco. Alvarado entered Tehuantepec again in 1524, subduing the local population in Tequixixtlan and Xallapan. However, many years passed before the Spanish had full control of the area. After the Conquest, Cosijopii remained the head of the city, but subject to Spanish hegemony from 1521 until his death in 1563.

There is little information about the development of the Tehuantepec area during the colonial period, especially economically. However, one of the first colonial shipyards El Carbón, was established at the mouth of the Rover Tehuantepec. Timber was plentiful in the area, but other shipbuilding supplies had to be brought from Veracruz, on the Atlantic coast. The route up the navigable Coatzacoalcos River then on land to El Carbón to was the most straightforward route to the Pacific coast. This is the route that was later proposed for a canal across the Isthmus of Tehuantepec and was later followed by the Tehuantepec Railway. At the end of 1532, two ships were built to become part of the flotilla of Diego Hurtado de Mendoza but they wrecked on the coast of what is now Jalisco. More ships were built for exploration and trade along the coasts between California and Peru. Casaban and Junco (2020) give details of several of these ships from a document of 1535. However, soon after Hernán Cortés and other colonial authorities lost interest in the economic development of this area in favor of other areas. However, a main road called the Camino Real de Tehuantepec which connected it to other parts of what is now Oaxaca. The Spanish town of Tehuantepec was officially established by Dominican brothers Gregorio de Beteta and Bernardo de Alberquerer in 1538 and received a royal seal from Charles V in 1543. The church and monastery were constructed starting in 1544. By 1550, the city had forty-nine neighborhoods.

Further development of the Tehuantepec area focused on the Camino Real or Royal Road of Tehuantepec, which was built to control newly conquered areas, facilitate the collection of tribute and for commerce. Along the road, ranches and haciendas were established that regularized the commerce and gave social and political unity to the area. This process gave rise to conflicts between hacienda owners and the indigenous peoples as possession of lands changed. In 1660, the indigenous rebelled against Spanish authorities. The rebellion ended in 1661 in part because Philip IV put the city under direct control of the Spanish crown and issued a pardon to the rebels.

In the mid 19th century, the United States pressured Mexico for transit rights across the Isthmus of Tehuantepec, with the aim of building a road, railway or canal for the purpose of connecting the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans for trade. Pressure was greatest during the Mexican–American War, when these transit rights were part of the first attempts at talks to end the war. However, this was not included in the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo. During negotiations for the Gadsden Purchase, the issue came up again but transit rights were again denied. Despite strong interests in the area, the U.S. Army never invaded Tehuantepec, even though troops had gone as far south as southern Veracruz. However, the war drained the south of the country of soldiers and lessened control from Mexico City. As a result, the Isthmus area rebelled against rule from the city of Oaxaca. In 1850, the first plan to separate the Tehuantepec area from Oaxaca took shape. The result was the regaining of a certain amount of autonomy. A second attempt took place in 1853.

Tehuantepec gained municipal status in 1825 and town status in 1857. The Reform Laws secularized most of the lands of the Dominican order in the area.

Tehuantepec&#x27;s &quot;Golden Age&quot; began in the early 20th century with the building and operation of the trans-Isthmus railroad, which then provided the shortest trade route between the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans. At its height, the line carried fifty trains per day, making one of the busiest railways in history. The goods and travelers brought money to the town and it grew. However, the boom ended shortly thereafter with the completion of the Panama Canal in 1914.
The Pan-American Highway came through the area in the middle of the 20th century, which connected it with the rest of Mexico and by extension all the Americas. Shortly after, a modern highway connecting it to the city of Oaxaca was constructed.

The southern Isthmus area of Tehuantepec and Juchitán have had sporadic bouts of unrest since the late 1960s, paralleling conflicts which were occurring in other parts of Mexico. This trend continued from the 1970s to the 1990s, mostly focused on the activities of the Tehuantepec diocese under bishop Arturo Lona Reyes, who led from 1971 to his retirement in 2000. The Diocese of Tehuantepec was part of a movement to mobilize the poor and indigenous in the 1980s and 1990s, allied with other elements of the Catholic Church in Oaxaca, the CEDIPIO and others. This movement was based on the teachings of liberation theology. Bishop Arturo Lona was a strong supporter of the teachings of Vatican II calling for the creation of a &quot;people&#x27;s church&quot;. The Oaxaca church was allied with Diocese of Chiapas under Bishop Samuel Ruiz. The pastoral style of these Oaxacan and Chiapas churches came to be known as the &quot;pastoral indígena&quot; or indigenous pastoral and was focused explicitly on working with the most marginalized segments of society. He instituted a health clinic just outside the city of Tehuantepec basic hospital facilities and the promotion of natural medicine with the training of local healers called curanderos. There is also an ecological center on the same site promoting recycling and organic fertilizer for the area&#x27;s agriculture.

During the 1980s, the diocese faced violence by regional power-holders, with two serious assassination attempts in the years before Lona&#x27;s retirement. The goal of these groups was to suppress further political activism similar to the Zapatista uprising in Chiapas. Attacks against Lona and allies continued into the 1990s. Liberation theology remained center of the diocese while Lona remained bishop although it lost power in the 1990s as the country moved towards neoliberal policies as well as the Church&#x27;s own gradual abandonment of liberation theology. Arturo Lona Reyes was one of the last of church leaders aligned with Liberation Theology.

The retirement of Bishop Arturo Lona Reyes drew about four thousand people, mostly native Zapotecs and Mixes. His work was recognized by the Archbishop of Oaxaca over 29 years in Tehuantepec. Lona Reyes retired from the official post but remained head of a religious group called the Iglesia Universal. The bishop stated that his &quot;Opción por los Pobres&quot; (Choice for the Poor) program which he heads would remain intact after he hands his resignation to the Vatican. In the &quot;Church of the People&quot; the offering consist of food and gifts brought by hundreds of indigenous. The bishop&#x27;s sermons often contained references to those &quot;excluded from the system,&quot; &quot;community cooperatives&quot; and &quot;human rights.&quot; The current bishop of Tehuantepec is Oscar Armando Campos Cantreras.

The rail line that had been the source of Tehuantepec&#x27;s boom in the early 20th century steadily declined over the remainder of the century. It and the rest in the country were privatized in 2001, but the 24 km nearest the city has become virtually abandoned with workstations dismantled and equipment sold off. This put a final end to the rail based economy of the city, especially in the Reoloteca neighborhood.

Since then, there have been several attempts to resurrect the line crossing the Isthmus of Tehuantepec. The purpose of the project is to create a competitor to the overcrowded Panama Canal. It would be a rail line between the Gulf of Mexico and the Pacific at Tehuantepec, modernizing and extending existing rail lines. This type of project was initially proposed in 1980 again in 1997, 2006 and 2009. Versions of the project would have infrastructure built in Tehuantepec and in the nearby port of Salina Cruz. These attempts, however, did not come to fruition due to the large initial investment as a primary issue. However, in 2018 the Mexican government began to work on modernizing the railroad built in 1907 with the purpose of connecting the Pacific and the Gulf, in a project that also plans to build 10 industrial parks across the Isthmus and improve the infrastructure or the local highways and the ports of Salina Cruz and Coatzacoalcos. This project is known as the Interoceanic Corridor of the Isthmus of Tehuantepec, which is expected to be completed by the end of 2023 and the middle of 2024.

Despite an income of 100 million pesos a year, the municipality has had problems with bankruptcy and few works to show for the money in 2009. The municipal president was accused of embezzling the money, leaving the city with one of its worst crises in its history.

==Economy==

Twenty-one percent of the working population is in agriculture and livestock. Principle crops include beans, corn, sorghum, sesame seed, melons, cucumbers, squash, peanuts and flowers. Livestock includes cattle, pigs and goats. The Union of Indigenous Communities of the Isthmus Region, a cooperative founded in 1982, assists in production and distribution of the local products, notably coffee, under a fair trade label.

Twenty-five percent work in industry, mining and construction. Industry is limited to a water purification facility, an ice plant and one that processes calcium oxide (calidra). Limestone is mined as well. The most typical handcraft of the area is the traditional dress. There is also the production of ceramics especially for the kitchen as well as decorative items and toys.

Fifty-one percent work in commerce, tourism and services. Most of the commerce serves local needs with some serving regional customers and tourists. There are two four-star hotels, one two star hotel and nine guesthouses. The municipality also has water parks and beaches.

==Education==
The municipality has twenty-six pre-schools, thirty-eight formal primary schools (ten of which are bilingual), five middle schools, eight distance education middle schools, seven high schools and a nursing school. The Universidad del Istmo opened in 2002 with a campus in Tehuantepec and Ixtepec.

==Archeology==

The main archeological site is located on a large hill called Guiengola, Gola, Gui’ngola or Guien-Gola. It and a nearby volcanic cone were fortified with walls, trenches and towers on the slopes. On the summit, terraces, bases, pyramids and temples were constructed with slabs of stone covered in stucco. The fortress city also had pens of deer and wild boar as well as artificial ponds with fish to act as food reserves. The area is filled with small ravines, which makes access more difficult. The fortifications served well in the 1490s, when the Aztecs laid siege to the city, but were unable to definitely conquer it after seven months.

The summit offers a panoramic view of a large part of the area as it extends over the plains. Many of the original walls and other structures remain more than 700 years after they were built. There are some underground chambers. At the top of the hill, there are small pyramids oriented east–west and a type of shrine with circular walls along with a principle residence. The main plaza contains a Mesoamerican ball court facing east. There are also two cylindrical structures which may have been astronomical observatories. The archeological zone is located about twelve km from the modern city along Federal Highway 190. From there a dirt road leads to the hill four km away.

Difficulty of access and hot climate have discouraged study by archeologists. Zapotec fortresses can also be found in Nexapa, Maxaltepec, Quievicuasa, Quiechapa and Quiecolani, which were likely controlled by Tehuantepec.

<doc id="744480" wikidata="Q1126662" url="?curid=744480" title="Kern River">
<text>The Kern River is an Endangered, Wild and Scenic river in the U.S. state of California, approximately long. It drains an area of the southern Sierra Nevada mountains northeast of Bakersfield. Fed by snowmelt near Mount Whitney, the river passes through scenic canyons in the mountains and is a popular destination for whitewater rafting and kayaking. It is the southernmost major river system in the Sierra Nevada, and is the only major river in the Sierra that drains in a southerly direction.

The Kern River formerly emptied into the now dry Buena Vista Lake and Kern Lake via the Kern River Slough, and Kern Lake in turn emptied into Buena Vista Lake via the Connecting Slough at the southern end of the Central Valley. Buena Vista Lake, when overflowing, first backed up into Kern Lake and then upon rising higher drained into Tulare Lake via Buena Vista Slough and a changing series of sloughs of the Kern River. The lakes were part of a partially endorheic basin that sometimes overflowed into the San Joaquin River. This basin also included the Kaweah and Tule Rivers, as well as southern distributaries of the Kings River that all flowed into Tulare Lake.

Since the late 19th century the Kern has been almost entirely diverted for irrigation, recharging aquifers, and the California Aqueduct, although some water empties into Lake Webb and Lake Evans, two small lakes in a portion of the former Buena Vista lakebed. The lakes were created in 1973 for recreational use. The lakes hold combined. Crops are grown in the rest of the former lakebed. In extremely wet years the river will reach the Tulare Lake basin through a series of sloughs and flood channels.

Despite its remote source, nearly all of the river is publicly accessible. The Kern River is particularly popular for wilderness hiking and whitewater rafting. The Upper Kern River is paralleled by trails to within a half-mile of its source (which lies at ). Even with the presence of Lake Isabella, the river is perennial down to the lower Tulare Basin. Its swift flow at low elevation makes the river below the reservoir a popular location for rafting.

==Course==
The Kern begins in the Sierra Nevada in Sequoia National Park in northeastern Tulare County, near the border with Inyo County. The main branch of the river (sometimes called the North Fork Kern River) rises from several small lakes in a basin northwest of Mount Whitney. The headwaters are surrounded by the Great Western Divide to the west, the Kings-Kern Divide to the north and the main Sierra Crest to the east, all of which have multiple peaks above . The Kern River flows due south through a deep glacier-carved valley, passing through Inyo and Sequoia National Forests and the Golden Trout Wilderness, and receiving numerous tributaries including Rock Creek, Big Arroyo, Golden Trout Creek and Rattlesnake Creek. After deviating briefly from its due south course as it flows east around Hockett Peak, it is joined by the Little Kern River from the northwest at a site called Forks of the Kern. Below there, the Kern River continues south, and is joined by more tributaries including Peppermint Creek, South Creek, Brush Creek, and Salmon Creek, which all form large waterfalls as they tumble into the Kern River canyon.

At Kernville the river emerges from its narrow canyon into a wide valley where it is impounded in Lake Isabella, formed by Isabella Dam. The area was once known as Whiskey Flat, the former location of the town of Kernville. In Lake Isabella, it is joined by its largest tributary, the South Fork Kern River, which drains a high plateau area to the east of the North Fork drainage. The -long South Fork rises in Tulare County and flows south through Inyo National Forest, turning west after entering Kern County.

Below Isabella Dam the Kern River flows southwest in a rugged canyon along the south edge of the Greenhorn Mountains, parallel to SR 178. A number of hot springs (Scovern, Miracle, Remington, Delonegha, Democrat) are located along this section of the river. With a descent of between Isabella Dam and Bakersfield, this section of the Kern River feeds several hydroelectric plants and is also a popular whitewater run. Due to upstream dam releases for irrigation and power generation, this part of the river has a swift flow even in the driest summers. The river then flows through a winding valley in the Sierra foothills before entering the San Joaquin Valley at Bakersfield, the largest city on the river. In Bakersfield proper, most of the river&#x27;s flow is diverted into various canals for agricultural use in the southern San Joaquin Valley, and provide municipal water supplies to the City of Bakersfield and surrounding areas. Diverting the river&#x27;s flow has left of the riverbed that runs through Bakersfield dry. This fertile region is a large alluvial plain, or inland delta, formed by the Kern River, which once spread out into vast wetlands and seasonal lakes.

The Friant-Kern Canal, constructed as part of the Central Valley Project, joins the Kern about west of downtown Bakersfield, restoring some flow to the river. The river channel continues about southwest to a point near the California Aqueduct on the western side of the San Joaquin Valley. A weir allows excess floodwaters from the Kern to drain into the California Aqueduct, while any remaining water continues south into the seasonal Buena Vista Lake, which once reached sizes of about in wet periods. Historically, a distributary of the Kern split off above Bakersfield and flowed south to what is now Arvin, where it formed the seasonal Kern Lake, which would grow to cover about during wet periods. Water from Kern Lake would then flow west through Buena Vista Slough into Buena Vista Lake.

In periods of extremely high runoff, Buena Vista Lake overflowed and joined other wetlands and seasonal lakes in a series of sloughs that drained north into the former Tulare Lake, which would sometimes overflow into the San Joaquin River via Fresno Slough.

The Kern River is one of the very few rivers in the Central Valley which does not contribute water to the Central Valley Project (CVP). However, water from the CVP, mainly the Friant-Kern Canal, will be deposited for water storage in the aquifers.

==History==

The river was named by John C. Frémont in honor of Edward M. Kern in 1845 who, as the story goes, nearly drowned in the turbulent waters. Kern was the topographer of Fremont&#x27;s third expedition through the American West. Before this, the Kern River was known as the as named by Spanish missionary explorer Francisco Garcés when he explored the Bakersfield area on May 1, 1776. On August 2, 1806, Padre Zavidea renamed the river for the day of the Porciuncula Indulgence. It was locally known as Po-sun-co-la until its renaming by Fremont.

Gold was discovered along the upper river in 1853. The snowmelt that fed the river resulted in periodic torrential flooding in Bakersfield until the construction of the Isabella Dam in the 1950s. These floods would periodically change the channel of the river. Since the establishment of Kern County in 1866 the main channel has flowed through what is the main part of downtown Bakersfield along Truxtun Avenue and again made a south turn along what is Old River Road. Many of the irrigation canals that flow in a southerly direction from the river follow the old channels of the Kern River, especially the canal that flows along Old River Road. The irrigated region of the Central Valley near the river supports the cultivation of alfalfa, carrots, fruit, and cotton, cattle grazing, and many other year-round crops. In 1987 the United States Congress designated of the Kern&#x27;s North (Main) Fork and South Fork as a National Wild and Scenic River.

The Great 1857 Fort Tejon earthquake on January 9, 1857, with an estimated magnitude of 7.9 on the San Andreas Fault was strong enough to temporarily switch the direction of the flow of the Kern River. Fish in the now dry Tulare Lake were left stranded on the shores.

The Buena Vista Lake basin is an arid area and the Kern River is the only significant water supply. Ongoing conflicts between urban and agricultural interests complicate management decisions, in recent years owing to the expiration of some long-term contractual agreements.

=== &quot;Lux v. Haggin&quot; - 1886 California Supreme Court case on water rights ===
The Kern River was at the center of &quot;Lux v. Haggin&quot;, 69 Cal. 255; 10 P. 674; (1886), a historic case in the development of water rights in California, and also one of the most consequential water lawsuits in American history.

The overarching issue in &quot;Lux v. Haggin&quot; was whether the court would uphold English common law riparian rights (even though they were poorly suited to California&#x27;s Mediterranean climate), institute the primacy of appropriative water rights, or create an entirely new system of water rights. The decision was important because it gave the court a chance to either continue to uphold English common law and riparian rights or give appropriative rights supremacy.

In the end, the court recognized both water rights systems but decided that appropriative rights were secondary to riparian rights. The ruling &quot;created chaos by shackling the state with two fundamentally incompatible water allocation systems&quot;.

Additionally, the original definition of &quot;reasonable&quot; water use under English common law was changed. The court decided that water could be used for commercial and agricultural purposes as long as the use did not negatively affect other riparian landowners. This broadening of the &quot;reasonable&quot; use definition meant that riparian landowners could now use more water than previously allowed.

The subsequent 1888 Miller-Haggin Agreement that divides the water between First Point and Second Point users, still governs the use of Kern River water today.

===National Wild And Scenic Rivers System designation===

On November 24, 1987, portions of the Kern River were designated as Wild &amp; Scenic under the Wild &amp; Scenic Rivers Act. The Wild &amp; Scenic designation covers broken down as Wild — ; Scenic — ; Recreational — .

==Ecology==
The Kern River watershed is the native range of California&#x27;s State Freshwater Fish, California golden trout (&quot;Oncorhynchus mykiss aguabonita&quot;), which are native to the Kern River tributaries South Fork Kern River and Golden Trout Creek, and the latter&#x27;s tributary, Volcano Creek. Two currently recognized and closely related sibling subspecies. The Little Kern golden trout (&quot;O. m. whitei&quot;), found in the Little Kern River basin, and the Kern River rainbow trout (&quot;O. m. gilberti&quot;), are also found in the Kern River system. Together, these three trout form what is sometimes referred to as the &quot;Golden Trout Complex&quot;.

The rare and endangered Kern Canyon slender salamander lives alongside the river.

In 2008, after public outcry, the City of Bakersfield and the California Department of Fish and Game (CDFG) decided to relocate a family of California Golden beaver (&quot;Castor canadensis subauratus&quot;) instead of killing them. California Golden beaver were native to the Central Valley and throughout the Sierra Nevada. Specifically to the Kern watershed, an oral history was taken from Roy De Voe, who claimed to have seen &quot;very old beaver sign&quot; on the east side of the Kern River at Funston Meadow (elevation ) in 1946. Also, Mr. De Voe reported that his friend Kenny Keelor trapped the Kern River for beaver around 1900, making his camp at the mouth of Rattlesnake Creek (elevation ) until they were trapped out completely by 1910 – 1914. The presence of Beaver Canyon Creek, tributary to the lower Kern River just east of Delonegha Hot Springs, is also consistent with the Kern River watershed having historically supported native beaver. This oral history is consistent with another oral history taken one watershed to the north by CDFG&#x27;s Donald T. Tappe from a retired game warden in 1940, who stated that beaver were &quot;apparently not uncommon on the upper part of the Kings River&quot; until 1882–1883. Currently, there are large numbers of beaver in the Ramshaw Meadows on the South Fork Kern River where their dams are trapping sediment, forming extensive pools, accelerating meadow restoration, and increasing riparian willow habitat.

=== The Panorama Vista Preserve ===
Panorama Vista Preserve is a 930-acre wildlife refuge and outdoor recreational area located in the northeast part of Bakersfield, California. The preserve includes hiking trails, biking paths, and areas for horseback riding, and is known for being dog-friendly. It serves as a sanctuary for endangered species such as the San Joaquin Kit Fox and the Bakersfield Cactus. Panorama Vista Preserve is located near Panorama Park and &quot;The Bluffs&quot; and comprises two distinct floodplain elevations that support different vegetation communities. The lower terrace features typical riparian forests and shrub lands, while the upper terrace supports a salt-brush scrub community and relict stands of the endangered Bakersfield Cactus. Visitors to the preserve can see the Gordon&#x27;s Ferry historic landmark and learn about the natural and cultural history of the region.

=== Kern River Hatchery ===
Just north of Lake Isabella is the Kern River Hatchery. The Kern River Hatchery is also home to the Fishing and Natural History Museum, features picnic grounds and outdoor activities in the area.

==== Hatchery closure ====
On December 1, 2020, after 3 years of extensive renovations, the hatchery was closed down by California Department of Fish and Wildlife, just 20 months after being reopened. According to CDFW, the hatchery is closed for repairs with the primary focus on &quot;replacement of a pipeline that is more than 50 years old and no longer adequately provides a reliable water supply for fish production&quot;. There is currently no date set for reopening the hatchery. Despite the closure of the hatchery, the hatchery still diverts 35 cfs year-round from the North Fork Kern River at the expense of North Fork Kern fishery and its biome.

==Geology==
The upper Kern River Canyon was created primarily as a result of tectonic forces, and not just by the erosional force of the river. The geologically active Kern Canyon Fault runs the length of the canyon, from the river&#x27;s headwaters down to the Walker Basin about south of Lake Isabella. The river&#x27;s course has been modified several times throughout ancient geological history. Prior to 10 million years ago, the Kern River flowed into the San Joaquin Valley at a point further south, along what is now Walker Basin Creek, which outlets north of Arvin. Uplift west of the Kern Canyon Fault blocked the river and forced it to cut a new course further north, forming the steep gorge below Lake Isabella and Bakersfield. The upper part of the Kern River canyon, at least above Golden Trout Creek, was widened and deepened by glaciers during the Ice Ages. The Kern Canyon fault passes very close to Isabella Dam, and is considered a threat to the dam&#x27;s structural stability.

The Kern River Oil Field is adjacent to the river on the north, just before the river flows into Bakersfield. The large oil field, on low hills which rise gradually into the Sierra foothills, formerly allowed much of its wastewater to drain directly south into the river. However, modern environmental regulation ended this practice, and the contaminated water is now cleaned at water treatment plants and used to irrigate farms in the valley to the west.

===Discharge===

Due to water diversion and Isabella Dam the Kern River&#x27;s discharge changes considerably over its length. The highest mean annual flows occur just downriver of Isabella Dam, but because the dam serves to regulate the flow of water the highest daily discharges occur above the dam on the North Fork section of the Kern River. The USGS stream gauge on the North Fork Kern River has recorded an average annual mean discharge of and a maximum daily discharge of , and the gauge on the South Fork Kern River shows an average annual mean discharge of and a maximum daily discharge of . In contrast the first stream gauge below Isabella Dam has recorded an average annual mean of but a maximum daily discharge of only . Due to water withdrawals the three stream gauge stations below Isabella Dam show a dramatically decreasing discharge. At the last gauge, near Bakersfield, the river&#x27;s average flow is only .

==Recreation and Tourism==
===Activities===

Kern Canyon, the deep canyon of the river northeast of Bakersfield, is a popular location for fishing and boating, particularly fly fishing and whitewater rafting, whitewater kayaking, and riverboarding. Of particular interest to fishermen are the Kern River rainbow trout, the Little Kern golden trout, and the California golden trout. The Kern Canyon is popular for camping, hiking, and picnicking. There are developed campgrounds maintained by the US Forest Service along the North Fork of the Kern River. Campgrounds include Camp 3, Fairview, Goldledge, Headquarters, Hospital Flat, and Limestone. All of the campgrounds are open in the summer months while only a few remain open year-round.

===Safety Concerns===

The Kern is well known for its danger, and is sometimes referred to as the &quot;killer Kern&quot;. A sign at the mouth of Kern Canyon warns visitors: &quot;Danger. Stay Out. Stay Alive&quot; and tallies the deaths since 1968; as of May 23, 2024, the number of deaths listed is 335. Merle Haggard&#x27;s song &quot;Kern River&quot; fictionally recounts such a tragedy.

Below the canyon the Kern River has a gradient of 0.3% until it reaches the Kern River Oil Field and begins to meander along flat land into and through the city of Bakersfield. Tubing is popular along this stretch.

===Kernville Whitewater===

The Class II whitewater located in Kernville is used for the slalom event of the annual Kern River Festival.

===The Kern River Parkway Trail===

The Kern River Parkway Trail is a system of hiking and biking trails that extends along the Kern River from the mouth of the canyon to Hart Park in Bakersfield, California. The trail system is part of the larger Kern River Parkway, which includes several parks, picnic areas, and green spaces along the river.

====History====

The Kern River Parkway Trail was first proposed in the 1970s as part of a plan to create a system of parks and trails along the Kern River. The first section of the trail, between the mouth of the canyon and Buena Vista Lake, was completed in the 1980s. Since then, the trail has been extended to its current length, with several amenities added along the way.

====Route====

The Kern River Parkway Trail is a multi-use trail that can be used for hiking, biking, and equestrian activities. The trail extends for approximately 30 miles, from the mouth of the canyon to Hart Park in Bakersfield.

The trail follows the Kern River through several parks and green spaces, including the Kern River County Park, Yokuts Park, and the Kern River Preserve. The trail is mostly flat, with a few gentle slopes and curves, and several rest stops and picnic areas are available along the way.

====Amenities====

The Kern River Parkway Trail offers several amenities for hikers, bikers, and equestrians, including parking areas, restrooms, and drinking fountains. The trail system includes several hiking and biking trails that branch off from the main trail. These trails offer a variety of terrain and difficulty levels, from easy walks along the river to challenging mountain bike rides through the surrounding hills. The trail is maintained by the City of Bakersfield and the Kern County Parks and Recreation Department, with funding provided by grants and community donations.

=== Art Projects ===
==== &quot;Flow&quot; ====
Flow was a temporary art installation created by environmental artist Andres Amador on the Kern River in Bakersfield, California. The installation was meant to highlight the irony of the dry riverbed and raise awareness about the need to restore water flow to the Kern River. It was commissioned by &quot;Bring Back the Kern&quot;, a community group advocating for the restoration of the river, and supported by the Virginia and Alfred Harrell Foundation.

The installation featured a 2,500-square-foot image on the riverbed floor south of the 24th street overcrossing, created with an invasive bamboo-like reed called Arundo, which the group would like to eradicate from the Kern River. The design evoked the smooth lines of flowing water and the eddies created by a river&#x27;s currents. The lines in the design were over 2500 feet in length, making it a large-scale installation.

Flow involved extensive community involvement, including volunteer participation in the collection of plant material, the creation of the installation, and the removal of the artwork. The plant material used in the installation was collected by volunteers who had removed invasive plants from elsewhere along the parkway. The seeds from this plant were sterile, but the plant material was removed and disposed of within two weeks of the installation to ensure that the invasive weeds did not spread elsewhere along the river.

Bring Back the Kern hoped to draw attention to the lack of water in the Kern River and advocate for solutions, including calling upon the State Water Resources Control Board to award unappropriated water to the city of Bakersfield. The group believed that restoring water flow to the river would revive the local ecosystem, provide recreation opportunities, and enhance property values in the city.

Flow was a visual representation of the group&#x27;s message, highlighting the need for action to restore the Kern River. The installation was open to the public from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. on Thursday, February 11, and was available for viewing until its removal two weeks later. Visitors were encouraged to enjoy the artwork and engage with it.

==== &quot;The Mighty Kern River&quot; ====
&quot;The Mighty Kern River&quot; is a children&#x27;s book in the &quot;Indy, Oh Indy&quot; series created by author Teresa Adamo and illustrator Jennifer Williams-Cordova. The book takes readers on a tour of the Kern River, from its mountain origins to the Buena Vista Lake Aquatic Recreation Area west of Bakersfield. The book was inspired by Bring Back the Kern, a grassroots group raising awareness about Bakersfield&#x27;s mostly dry river and efforts to revive a more regular flow of water through town.

The book features cute animal characters and easy-to-follow prose to introduce children to the importance of a running river and its benefits to the community and environment. The creators of the &quot;Indy&quot; book series used Kickstarter to fund &quot;The Mighty Kern River&quot;, with a goal of $6,500. The book costs $15 and includes a fold-out map of the river. As an added incentive, the creators are offering &quot;extras&quot; for donors, including having a person illustrated into the book or having someone&#x27;s name painted on the side of a ski boat. The book is set to be released to buyers by August 1.

Bring Back the Kern wrote a foreword for the book to capture some of the river&#x27;s history and legal issues. The group is promoting the book as a way for readers, young and old, to envision a flowing river &quot;year-round&quot;. The state Water Resources Control Board recently announced it would begin the hearing process on the Kern River to determine the allocation of unappropriated water. Bring Back the Kern has been advocating for a hearing and for any available water to be given to the city for use in the riverbed.

== Legal Action for Restoration and Public Trust Issues ==
In December 2022, six environmental groups initiated a lawsuit against the city of Bakersfield, aiming to restore the flow of the Kern River, which had been heavily diverted to supply water to farms. The lawsuit argued that the city&#x27;s continued allowance of water diversions upstream was harmful to both the environment and the community, violating California&#x27;s public trust doctrine.

In January 2022, critics, including Attorney Adam Keats, argued that the State Water Resources Control Board was not adequately addressing public interests in its handling of the Kern River water case. The state hearings were not set to consider the impact of water diversion on the environment, recreation, drinking water, or quality of life, collectively known as the &quot;public trust&quot;.

Keats argued that the first consideration should be the requirements of the public trust, including the amount of water needed to maintain the river&#x27;s flow. The Bakersfield group Bring Back the Kern sent a letter to the state requesting that the Water Board direct its Administrative Hearing Officer to include several public trust questions. The group also referenced California Fish and Wildlife Code 5937, which mandates that dam owners must allow enough water into rivers to sustain a fishery. The letter pointed out that the current situation on the Kern River precluded the existence of any fisheries.

==Endangered river status==
The Lower Kern River was listed by American Rivers as one of America&#x27;s Most Endangered Rivers of 2022. According to American Rivers, &quot;decades of excessive water diversions for agriculture operations have dried up the last of the Lower Kern River.&quot;. Water right holders, use a series of canals, many that run right next to the dry riverbed, to divert water from the natural riverbed and in the process have allowed the Lower Kern River to run dry. Doing so has denied the 500,000 residents of the surrounding communities access to flowing river in direct violation of the public trust doctrine. &quot;Under the Public Trust Doctrine, California is obligated to protect flowing waterways for the benefit of current and future generations.&quot;

There are several local groups such as Bring Back the Kern, Kern River Fly Fishers, and The Kern River Parkway Foundation that are working to restore the Lower Kern River.

<doc id="744482" wikidata="Q4979723" url="?curid=744482" title="Brushed metal">
<text>Brushed stainless steel or dull polished metal is metal with a unidirectional satin finish. It is produced by polishing the metal with a 120–180 grit belt or wheel then softening with an 80–120 grit greaseless compound or a medium non-woven abrasive belt or pad.

Commonly brushed metals include stainless steel, aluminium and nickel. Brushed finishes are popular in both small appliances and whiteware, and feature in architecture and automotive design. The Gateway Arch and DMC DeLorean are both clad in brushed stainless steel. The intensity of the brushed finish is specified as a surface roughness and is typically 0.5–1.5 micrometres Ra.

== Characteristics ==

Brushing gives metal a distinctive look, as it retains some but not all of its metallic lustre and is given a pattern of very fine lines parallel to the brushing direction. For this reason, it is commonly used for decorative items like jewellery and watches.

A brushed finish is susceptible to damage. Brushed finishes also typically have a detrimental effect on corrosion resistance. In particular the brushed texture limits the ability of fluid to bead on the material surface. In the case of stainless steel the grooves of the finish can accumulate chloride ions which break down the chromium oxide passivation layer, enabling rusting to occur.

<text>Asher Brown Durand (August 21, 1796 – September 17, 1886) was an American engraver and painter of the Hudson River School.

==Early life==
Durand was born in, and eventually died in, Maplewood, New Jersey (then called Jefferson Village). He was the eighth of eleven children. Durand&#x27;s father was a watchmaker and a silversmith.

Durand was apprenticed to an engraver from 1812 to 1817 and later entered into a partnership with the owner of the company, Charles Cushing Wright (1796–1854), who asked him to manage the company&#x27;s New York office. He engraved &quot;Declaration of Independence&quot; for John Trumbull during 1823, which established Durand&#x27;s reputation as one of the country&#x27;s finest engravers. The project took three years and he was paid $3,000. Between 1829 and 1850, he submitted illustrations and engravings for &quot;The Token and Atlantic Souvenir&quot; annual gift book, including the title page for the 1829 volume. Contemporary critic John Neal praised Durand&#x27;s engraving of &quot;The Wife&quot; by Samuel F.B. Morse for &quot;The Atlantic Souvenir&quot; (1830), which Neal said was better than the original painting. 

Durand helped organize the New York Drawing Association in 1825, which would become the National Academy of Design; he would serve the organization as president from 1845 to 1861. There he exhibited 181 engravings and paintings between 1826 and 1860.

Asher&#x27;s engravings on bank notes were used as the portraits for America&#x27;s first postage stamps, the 1847 series. Along with his brother Cyrus he also engraved some of the succeeding 1851 issues. Contemporary art historian William Dunlap dubbed Durand America&#x27;s first engraver.

==Painting career==
Durand&#x27;s main interest changed from engraving to oil painting about 1830 with the encouragement of his patron, Luman Reed. In 1837, he accompanied his friend Thomas Cole on a sketching expedition to Schroon Lake in the Adirondacks Mountains, and soon after he began to concentrate on landscape painting. He spent summers sketching in the Catskills, Adirondacks, and the White Mountains of New Hampshire, making hundreds of drawings and oil sketches that were later incorporated into finished academy pieces which helped to define the Hudson River School.

Durand is remembered particularly for his detailed portrayals of trees, rocks, and foliage. He was an advocate for drawing directly from nature with as much realism as possible. Durand wrote, &quot;Let [the artist] scrupulously accept whatever [nature] presents him until he shall, in a degree, have become intimate with her infinity...never let him profane her sacredness by a willful departure from truth.&quot;

Like other Hudson River School artists, Durand also believed that nature was an ineffable manifestation of God. He expressed this sentiment and his general opinions on art in his essay &quot;Letters on Landscape Painting&quot; in &quot;The Crayon&quot;, a mid-19th century New York art periodical. Wrote Durand, &quot;[T]he true province of Landscape Art is the representation of the work of God in the visible creation...&quot;Durand is noted for his 1849 painting &quot;Kindred Spirits&quot; which shows fellow Hudson River School artist Thomas Cole and poet William Cullen Bryant in a Catskills Mountains landscape. This was painted as a tribute to Cole upon Cole&#x27;s death in 1848 and a gift to Bryant. The painting, donated by Bryant&#x27;s daughter Julia to the New York Public Library in 1904, was sold by the library using Sotheby&#x27;s at an auction in May 2005 to Alice Walton for a purported $35 million (the sale was performed as a sealed, first bid auction, so the actual sales price is not known). At $35 million, however, it would be a record price paid for an American painting at the time.
Another of Durand&#x27;s paintings is &quot;Progress&quot; (1853), commissioned by a railroad executive. The landscape depicts America&#x27;s progress, from a state of nature (on the left, where Native Americans look on), towards the right, where there are roads, telegraph wires, a canal, warehouses, railroads, and steamboats. In December 2018, it was purchased by an anonymous donor for an estimated $40 million and given to the Virginia Museum of Fine Arts.

In 2007, the Brooklyn Museum exhibited nearly sixty of Durand&#x27;s works in the first monographic exhibition devoted to the painter in more than thirty-five years. The show, entitled &quot;Kindred Spirits: Asher B. Durand and the American Landscape&quot;, was exhibited from March 30 to July 29, 2007. Durand is interred in Brooklyn, New York, in Green-Wood Cemetery.

<text>DoubleClick Inc. was an American advertisement company that developed and provided Internet ad serving services from 1995 until its acquisition by Google in March 2008. DoubleClick offered technology products and services that were sold primarily to advertising agencies and mass media, serving businesses like Microsoft, General Motors, Coca-Cola, Motorola, L&#x27;Oréal, Palm, Inc., Apple Inc., Visa Inc., Nike, Inc., and Carlsberg Group. The company&#x27;s main product line was known as &quot;DART&quot; (Dynamic Advertising, Reporting, and Targeting), which was intended to increase the purchasing efficiency of advertisers and minimize unsold inventory for publishers.

DoubleClick was founded in 1995 by Kevin O&#x27;Connor and Dwight Merriman and had headquarters in New York City, United States. It was acquired by private equity firms Hellman &amp; Friedman and JMI Equity in July 2005. On March 11, 2008, Google acquired DoubleClick for $3.1 billion. In June 2018, Google announced plans to rebrand its ads platforms, and DoubleClick was merged into the new Google Marketing Platform brand. DoubleClick Bid Manager became Display and Video 360, DoubleClick Search became Search Ads 360, DoubleClick Campaign Manager became Campaign Manager 360 and DoubleClick for Publishers (DFP) became Google Ad Manager 360.

==History==
In 1995, Kevin O&#x27;Connor and Dwight Merriman developed the concept for DoubleClick in O&#x27;Connor&#x27;s basement. They created a system to display banner ads across a network of websites and track their performance to better target internet users. The product caught the attention of entrepreneur Kevin Ryan, who later joined as the company&#x27;s CFO and later became its CEO.

Later that year, O&#x27;Connor and Merriman met Fergus O&#x27;Daily, the CEO of Poppe Tyson. Poppe Tyson had created an Interactive Sales division, but lacked the technology to deliver online ads across its network of client&#x27;s sites. O&#x27;Connor, Merriman, and O&#x27;Daily decided to merge the two companies. To prevent competition from each company&#x27;s sales teams, in November 1995 DoubleClick was spun off as an independent, wholly owned subsidiary. DoubleClick was founded as one of the earliest known Application Service Providers (ASP) for internet &quot;ad-serving&quot;—primarily banner ads.

In February 1998, during the dot-com bubble, the company became a public company, trading on NASDAQ under the symbol DCLK, via an initial public offering. Shares rose 75% on the first day of trading.

In June 1999, DoubleClick acquired Abacus Direct, which marketed consumer-purchasing data to catalog firms.

In July 1999, DoubleClick acquired NetGravity and rebranded NetGravity AdServer as &quot;DART&quot; Enterprise.

As of 2002, DoubleClick faced six lawsuits, including class-action lawsuits, related to invasions of privacy. Privacy groups complained that DoubleClick&#x27;s plan to combine its online profiling information with offline information gathered by Abacus Direct would violate privacy rules, including the Stored Communications Act, the Wiretap Statute, and the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, as it would allow the company to match a person&#x27;s identity with their online habits, which it tracks through cookies. In February 2000, the FTC announced it had launched an investigation into the matter. The investigation was concluded in January 2001, with the FTC stating that it found no evidence that DoubleClick used or disclosed consumers personal identifying information. DoubleClick eventually entered into a settlement agreement where DoubleClick was required to explain its privacy policy in &quot;easy-to-read&quot; language; conduct a public information campaign consisting of 300 million banner ads inviting consumers to learn more about protecting their privacy; and institute data purging and opt-in procedures among other requirements.

In 2004, DoubleClick acquired Performics, which offered affiliate marketing, search engine optimization, and search engine marketing products. These products were integrated into the core DART system and rebranded DART search. DoubleClick Advertising Exchange connected both media buyers and sellers on an advertising exchange much like the financial negotiations of listed companies&#x27; capital stock. Google sold Performics in 2008 to Publicis.

In April 2005, Hellman &amp; Friedman, a San Francisco-based private equity firm, agreed to acquire the company for $1.1 billion.

==Acquisition==
On April 13, 2007, Google agreed to acquire DoubleClick for US$3.1 billion in cash. The deal raised concerns surrounding competition with both the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) and the European Union. In May 2007, the FTC requested additional information about the deal after it was urged by competitors, including Microsoft, which believed it would give Google too much control over online advertising. On December 20, 2007, the FTC approved Google&#x27;s purchase of DoubleClick from its owners Hellman &amp; Friedman and JMI Equity. European Union regulators approved on March 11, 2008, and Google completed the acquisition later that day. On April 2, 2008, Google announced it would cut 300 jobs at DoubleClick due to organizational redundancies. Selected employees would be matched within the Google organization as per position and experience.

In November 2007, shortly after the announcement of the acquisition, it was reported that DoubleClick had been serving ads designed to trick users into buying malware. This occurred after a malicious website tricked several name-brand websites into serving the ads.

In June 2010, Google confirmed its acquisition of Invite Media, a demand-side platform, which it later renamed DoubleClick Bid Manager.

On July 24, 2018, the names and logos of all DoubleClick products were updated, and DoubleClick Bid Manager is now Display &amp; Video 360 (DV360).

<text>Medea Benjamin (born Susan Benjamin on September 10, 1952) is an American political activist who, along with Jodie Evans and others, co-founded Code Pink. She also co-founded, along with her husband Kevin Danaher, the fair trade advocacy group Global Exchange. Benjamin was the Green Party nominee in the 2000 United States Senate election in California, running under the name Medea Susan Benjamin.

== Early life ==
Susan Benjamin was born September 10, 1952, daughter of Alvin and Rose Benjamin. She grew up in Freeport, New York, on Long Island, and is of Jewish descent. Her father, Alvin Benjamin (1920-2012), was a wealthy real estate developer, president of The Benjamin Companies.

During her first year at Tufts University, she renamed herself after the Greek mythological character Medea. Samuel Moyn wrote that Benjamin &quot;liked how the name sounded, and she had heard a feminist interpretation of the Greek tragedy suggesting that Medea had never killed her children and was only blamed for it by patriarchal traditions&quot;.

She also joined the Students for a Democratic Society. Later she dropped out of school and hitchhiked through Europe and Africa, teaching English classes to earn money. She later returned to the United States and received master&#x27;s degrees in public health from Columbia University and in economics from The New School. Benjamin worked for ten years as an economist and nutritionist in Latin America and Africa for the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization, the World Health Organization, the Swedish International Development Agency, and the Institute for Food and Development Policy.

== Career ==

=== Organizations ===

In 1988, with her husband, Kevin Danaher, and Kirsten Moller, Benjamin co-founded the San Francisco-based Global Exchange, which advocates fair trade alternatives to what she describes as corporate globalization. In 2002, with Jodie Evans and others, she co-founded the feminist anti-war group Code Pink: Women for Peace, which advocated for an end to the Iraq War, the prevention of future wars, and social justice. Benjamin has been involved with the anti-war organization United for Peace and Justice.

She later created the Occupation Watch Center in Baghdad (IOWC) to monitor the United States military, and the war&#x27;s effect on civilian populations. Through this center, she brought U.S. military family members to see the conditions under which enlisted personnel served, and to speak out against the war, in Congress and at the United Nations, in 2003.

She is a member of the Board of Directors of Liberty Tree.

=== Politics ===
In 2000, Benjamin ran as a Green Party candidate challenging incumbent US Senator from California, Dianne Feinstein. She advocated a living wage, universal healthcare and delaying genetically engineered foods. During the campaign, Benjamin and her Republican rival Tom Campbell participated in joint events, including a joint press conference, touting their opposition to Feinstein (but also disagreeing with each other on many issues). Benjamin garnered 99,716 votes, 74%, in the Green Party primary, and 326,828 votes, 3.08% of the general election total ballots. Since then she has remained active in the Green Party and has also supported efforts by the Progressive Democrats of America.

In 2015, the Green Party created a shadow cabinet, naming Benjamin as the shadow Secretary of State.

== Protest actions ==

From 2002 to 2009, Benjamin engaged in numerous protests involving members of the Bush administration (Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld; President George W. Bush; Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice); Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki, and others. Benjamin engaged in protest actions at the 2004 Democratic National Convention and the 2004 Republican National Convention. On December 4, 2007, she was arrested by plainclothes police in Lahore, Pakistan, detained by the ISI for eight hours, and deported after protesting the house arrest of lawyers (including Aitzaz Ahsan). In 2009, Benjamin joined the steering committee for the Gaza Freedom March. In February 2012, Benjamin was arrested and deported for illegal entry to Bahrain and her participation in an illegal protest.

During 2005–2010, she worked to oppose United States threats of a possible impending war with Iran, including lobbying Congress, taking peace delegations to Iran, and bringing Iranian youth to Congress.

Benjamin repeatedly interrupted a major speech by President Barack Obama regarding United States policy in the War on Terror at the National Defense University on May 23, 2013. After Benjamin was removed for her actions, President Obama then went off script. &quot;The voice of that woman is worth paying attention to,&quot; he said. &quot;Obviously I do not agree with much of what she said. And obviously she wasn&#x27;t listening to me and much of what I said. But these are tough issues. And the suggestion that we can gloss over them is wrong.&quot; Benjamin responded by telling The Daily Beast, &quot;If he had indeed made significant policy changes, I wasn&#x27;t going to say anything. I would have preferred that option, but given that he didn&#x27;t make those kind of changes I was looking for, I was glad to be given the opportunity to speak out.&quot;

On July 21, 2016, Benjamin heckled Donald Trump&#x27;s acceptance speech at the Republican National Convention with a sign that read &quot;Build bridges not walls&quot;.

She joined other activists on the 2024 Gaza freedom flotilla.

== Organization efforts ==
=== Labor rights and corporate responsibility ===
During the 1990s, Benjamin focused on countering what she believed was unfair trade as promoted by the World Trade Organization. She participated in an anti-sweatshop movement, initiating campaigns against Nike and clothing companies such as the GAP. In 1999, Benjamin helped expose the problem of indentured servitude among garment workers in the United States territory of Saipan (the Marianas Islands), which led to a billion-dollar lawsuit against 17 United States retailers. In 1999, she produced the documentary &quot;Sweating for a T-Shirt&quot; about the sweatshop industry.

During the World Trade Organization meeting in Seattle in December 1999, Benjamin&#x27;s organization, Global Exchange, helped organize the 1999 Seattle WTO protests.

In 2000, she helped a campaign to pressure Starbucks to carry fair trade coffee in all their cafes. In October 2000, Starbucks introduced whole bean Fair Trade Certified coffee at more than 2,300 stores.

For 2001, Benjamin focused on California&#x27;s energy crisis, assisting low-income ratepayers and small businesses. She headed a coalition of consumer, environmental, union and business leaders working for clean and affordable power under public control.

In September 2003, Benjamin was in Cancún, Mexico challenging the policies of the World Trade Organization (WTO) and in November, she was in Miami protesting the proposed Free Trade Area of the Americas (FTAA) while trying to bring attention to global peace and economic justice movements.

After several fact-finding visits to China, Benjamin co-sponsored with the International Labor Rights Fund an initiative to improve the labor and environmental practices of United States multinationals in China. The ensuring Human Rights Principles for US Businesses in China have been endorsed by major companies such as Cisco, Intel, Reebok, Levi Strauss and Mattel.

=== Israel/Palestine ===
In 2006, Benjamin organized humanitarian aid for war refugees in Lebanon and spoke out against Israeli bombing. In 2008 during the Operation Cast Lead Israeli invasion of Gaza, she organized a daily protest at the hotel where President-elect Barack Obama was staying, and then visited Gaza to see the immediate effects of the bombing. She brought humanitarian aid and helped put together six other delegations to Gaza. She was one of the lead organizers of the Gaza Freedom March, where 1,350 people from dozens of countries came together in Cairo to try to march to Gaza. Benjamin criticized the United States government for passing legislation to send Israel $3 billion in aid, lobbied Congress and sailed on the U.S. Flotilla to Gaza in November 2011. Days after Israel launched its Pillar of Defense operation targeting sites in Gaza during November 2012, Benjamin led a delegation to deliver medical supplies to the Shifa hospital and the Palestinian Red Crescent in Gaza. She also helped to organize an annual gathering in Washington, D.C., with the objective of exposing the &quot;negative influence&quot; of the United States lobby group American-Israel Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC).

In January 2018, it was announced that activists from 20 American groups, including Code Pink, were banned from entering Israel because of their support for the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions (BDS) movement. &quot;The Algemeiner&quot; reported in April 2014 that Benjamin&#x27;s charitable foundation, which was worth $12 million, had shareholdings in Caterpillar, a company targeted by the BDS movement, as well as the oil company Chevron and the tobacco conglomerate Phillip Morris.

In November 2023, Benjamin conducted an ambush interview with US Senator Marco Rubio, and asked him if he would &quot;call for a ceasefire in Gaza.&quot; Rubio responded &quot;No I will not. On the contrary, … I want Israel to destroy every element of Hamas they can get their hands on.&quot;

=== Iraq ===
After the United States invaded Iraq in 2003, she created the Occupation Watch Center in Baghdad to monitor the United States military and the war&#x27;s effect on civilian populations. Through this center she brought Iraqi women to the United States to speak about the occupation, organized delegations of U.S. military family members to see the conditions of their children serving in Iraq, and documented United States abuses, including at Abu Ghraib prison before the scandal involving it broke in the United States media. She also organized medical aid delegations to Iraq to civilians harmed by the United States military. She testified in Congress and the United Nations against the Iraq War.

In 2005, she was involved in the Hammering Halliburton campaign which was concerned with the abuses of United States military contractors such as Halliburton, the goal of which was to expose the awarding of corrupt no-bid contracts to corporations with close ties to the Bush administration. Along with this, Benjamin also exposed Blackwater Worldwide&#x27;s illegal activities, including protests at the headquarters of the International Association of War Contractors. She was arrested outside the home of Blackwater&#x27;s CEO.

In opposition to indefinite detention in Guantanamo, in 2007, Benjamin organized a delegation of prisoners&#x27; family members to Guantanamo Naval Base prison camp in Cuba, demanding its closing. In 2007 as well, she continued to protest weekly outside the Justice Department concerning water boarding and indefinite detention, and called for the resignation of Attorney General Alberto Gonzales. She was arrested many times for protests in Congressional hearings.

On October 31, 2009, Benjamin led a group of Code Pink protestors at a protest aimed at military families queued up for a White House Halloween Party hosted by President Obama and First Lady Michelle Obama. The event raised controversy when a Reuters News photo showing the protesters (dressed as wounded soldiers), including one identified as Benjamin, were described as &quot;taunting&quot; the children.

=== Drones ===
In 2009, Benjamin began her efforts to bring attention to the effects of drone warfare, participating in demonstrations at United States bases where drones are piloted and at headquarters of drone manufacturers. On April 28, 2012, in Washington, D.C., she was responsible for organizing the first International Drone Summit with lawyers, scientists, academics, and activists to kick off an international campaign to rein in the use of drones in the U.S. and abroad.

On April 30, 2012, Benjamin interrupted a speech on United States counterterrorism strategy given by John Brennan at the Woodrow Wilson Center, to ask about civilians casualties of US drone strikes in Pakistan, Somalia, and Yemen.

In October 2012, she organized a 34-person delegation to Pakistan to protest U.S. drone warfare. While in Pakistan she allegedly met with drone victims, family members, lawyers, academics, women&#x27;s groups, and Pakistani leaders, as well as the U.S. Ambassador to Pakistan. The delegation made international headlines when they joined a caravan to Waziristan organized by prominent political leader and former Pakistani cricket captain Imran Khan, a staunch opponent of American involvement in Pakistan. (See CNN video, &quot;The New York Times&quot;, &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, Al Jazeera, the BBC, and more than 100 major news outlets, September 28 – October 14, 2012). She also organized a public fast in Islamabad in sympathy with alleged drone victims.

In 2012, she authored &quot;Drone Warfare: Killing by Remote Control&quot;, published by OR Books, and toured the country speaking out against drone warfare.

=== Other campaigns ===
As part of Code Pink&#x27;s mission, Benjamin helped organize many International Women&#x27;s Day Marches and Mother&#x27;s Day Calls for Peace, the latter to bring back the original intent of Mother&#x27;s Day as women mobilizing against war. These included bringing women from war torn countries such as Iraq, Palestine and Afghanistan to the U.S. to speak about their experiences. Between 2003 and 2010, Benjamin helped organized anti-war mass mobilizations in Washington, D.C., New York City and San Francisco.

Benjamin organized the campaign Bring Our War Dollars Home, which fought to divert money from the Pentagon into social programs at home.

=== WTO protest violence ===
During the 1999 anti-globalization movement protests against the WTO in Seattle, a quote from Benjamin was published by the &quot;New York Times&quot;, which implied that she was calling for the arrest of those who destroyed property during the protests. Benjamin later clarified that, while she did not approve of the tactics of destroying property, she did not want the arrest of those responsible.

=== Anybody But Bush ===
Benjamin has been criticized by some Greens for her support for &quot;Anybody But Bush&quot; in 2004. Explaining why she supported this movement, she said that &quot;maybe it&#x27;s time for the people who voted for Bush in 2000, the people who didn&#x27;t vote at all in 2000, and yes, people like myself who voted for Ralph Nader in 2000, to admit our mistakes. I&#x27;ll say mine — I had no idea that George Bush would be such a disastrous president. Had I known then what I know now, and had I lived in a swing state, I would have voted for Gore instead of Ralph Nader.&quot;

Todd Chretien, a member of the International Socialist Organization, responded:
=== Views on United States involvement in the Middle East ===
Benjamin writes in &quot;The Huffington Post&quot; that the U.S. needs to end military interventionism and that the &quot;U.S. military should close all foreign military bases and use our soldiers to protect us here at home.&quot;

Benjamin also writes in &quot;The Huffington Post&quot; that the United States never had any &quot;justification for invading Iraq&quot;, that there is no &quot;justification for continuing the war in Afghanistan&quot;, and that in Pakistan, the United States &quot;drone attacks are only fueling the violence and creating more Osama bin Ladens&quot;. Regarding the killing of bin Laden, she says: &quot;Let us not sink into a false sense of triumphalism in the wake of Bin Laden&#x27;s passing.&quot;

=== Arrest In Egypt ===
On March 3, 2014, Benjamin was arrested in Egypt. She had flown there en route to participating in a women&#x27;s conference in the Palestinian territory of Gaza. Upon her arrival at Cairo International Airport, Benjamin was detained by airport police and held overnight, during which time she said she was assaulted by police officers, resulting in a broken arm and a dislocated shoulder. She was later deported to Turkey. Questions arose regarding the role of the United States Embassy in her detention, as embassy spokesman Mofid Deak said that Benjamin left the country following assistance from the embassy, while Code Pink&#x27;s Alli McCracken said the embassy did not help Benjamin.

=== Venezuela ===
In 2006, Benjamin said that it was a myth that Venezuelan President Hugo Chávez had limited freedom of speech and eroded civil rights in Venezuela. In May 2007, Benjamin appeared as a guest on talk-show host Tucker Carlson&#x27;s show, which was then part of MSNBC&#x27;s schedule. Carlson criticized Benjamin for her statement and asked her: &quot;Do you want to revise that given the news that Hugo Chávez has closed the last nationally broadcast opposition television station for criticizing him?&quot; Benjamin replied that Chávez had not renewed the license of RCTV because the station &quot;participated in a coup against a democratically elected government, his [Chavez&#x27;s] government&quot;. Benjamin also said: &quot;Peru recently did not renew a license. Uruguay didn&#x27;t renew a license. Why do you hold Venezuela to a different standard?&quot;

Carlson responded that a 360-page Venezuelan government-published book accused RCTV of showing lack of respect for authorities and institutions. Carlson asked Benjamin: &quot;I would think, as a self-described liberal, you would stand up for the right of people to &#x27;challenge authorities and institutions.&#x27; And yet you are apologizing for the squelching of minority views. Why could that be?&quot; Benjamin replied: &quot;They [RCTV] falsified information. They got people out on the street. They falsified footage that showed pro-Chavez supporters killing people, which did not happen. They refuse to cover any of the pro-Chavez demonstrations.&quot;

In January 2019, in a &quot;Democracy Now!&quot; interview, Benjamin said she was against &quot;US intervention in Venezuela&quot;, which had the potential to &quot;create a civil war leading to tremendous violence&quot;.

In April and May 2019, Benjamin was part of an &quot;Embassy Protection Collective&quot; formed by groups that include CodePink, ANSWER Coalition, Poor People&#x27;s Army, People&#x27;s Power Assembly, Revolutionary Alliance and Popular Resistance, which occupied the Venezuelan Embassy in Washington. Benjamin said the group had the permission of the Maduro government to stay in the embassy.

==Awards and accolades==
In 2010, Benjamin received the Martin Luther King Jr. Peace Prize from the Fellowship of Reconciliation. In 2012, she won the Marjorie Kellogg National Peacemaker Award and the Thomas Merton Center Peace Award. Also in 2012, she was awarded The US Peace Prize &quot;in recognition of her creative leadership on the front lines of the antiwar movement&quot;. In 2014, she received the Gandhi Peace Award from Promoting Enduring Peace &quot;to honor her for her unyielding advocacy for social justice of more than 30 years&quot;.

In 2003, the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; described her as &quot;one of the high profile leaders&quot; of the peace movement.

==Controversies==
In 2014, Benjamin attended the second annual New Horizon conference in Tehran, which hosted several fascists and Holocaust deniers. The Anti-Defamation League criticized Benjamin for attending the conference. Benjamin responded saying she was &quot;uncomfortable&quot; with many of the attendees but learned a lot and had nothing to apologize for.

Peter Camejo claims that, at the 2004 Green Party of the United States national convention, a supermajority of members had voted for endorsing the Nader-Camejo ticket, but a conspiracy involving Benjamin caused a slight majority of delegates to instead endorse the Cobb-LaMarche ticket.

== Personal life ==
Benjamin has been married twice. Her second marriage is to activist Kevin Danaher. She has two daughters, Maya Danaher and Arlen Gomez, who respectively serve as treasurer and secretary of the Benjamin Fund, an organization for which she serves as president.

Benjamin lives in Washington, D.C., and in San Francisco.

<doc id="744504" wikidata="Q205808" url="?curid=744504" title="Circular reference">
<text>A circular reference (or reference cycle) is a series of references where the last object references the first, resulting in a closed loop.
==Simple example==
A newcomer asks a local where the town library is. &quot;Just in front of the post office,&quot; says the local. The newcomer nods, and follows up: &quot;But where is the post office?&quot;

&quot;Why, that&#x27;s simple,&quot; replies the local. &quot;It&#x27;s just behind the library!&quot;

==In language==
A circular reference is not to be confused with the logical fallacy of a circular argument. Although a circular reference will often be unhelpful and reveal no information, such as two entries in a book index referring to each other, it is not necessarily so that a circular reference is of no use. Dictionaries, for instance, must always ultimately be a circular reference since all words in a dictionary are defined in terms of other words, but a dictionary nevertheless remains a useful reference. Sentences containing circular references can still be meaningful:

:&quot;Her brother gave her a kitten; his sister thanked him for it.&quot;

is circular, but not without meaning. Indeed, it can be argued that self-reference is a necessary consequence of Aristotle&#x27;s Law of non-contradiction, a fundamental philosophical axiom. In this view, without self-reference, logic and mathematics become impossible, or at least, lack usefulness.

==In computer programming==
Circular references can appear in computer programming when one piece of code requires the result from another, but that code needs the result from the first. For example, the two functions, posn and plus1 in the following Python program comprise a circular reference:
def posn(k: int) -&gt; int:
 if k &lt; 0:
 return plus1(k)
 return k

def plus1(n: int) -&gt; int:
 return posn(n + 1)
Circular references like the above example may return valid results if they have a terminating condition. If there is no terminating condition, a circular reference leads to a condition known as livelock or infinite loop, meaning it theoretically could run forever.
def posn(k: int) -&gt; int:
 return plus1(k)

def plus1(n: int) -&gt; int:
 return posn(n + 1)
In ISO Standard, SQL circular integrity constraints are implicitly supported within a single table. Between multiple tables circular constraints (e.g. foreign keys) are permitted by defining the constraints as deferrable (See CREATE TABLE for PostgreSQL and DEFERRABLE Constraint Examples for Oracle). In that case the constraint is checked at the end of the transaction not at the time the DML statement is executed. To update a circular reference, two statements can be issued in a single transaction that will satisfy both references once the transaction is committed.

Circular references can also happen between instances of data of a mutable type, such as in this Python script:

mydict = {
 &quot;this&quot;: &quot;that&quot;,
 &quot;these&quot;: &quot;those&quot;
mydict[&quot;myself&quot;] = mydict
print(mydict)
The function will output , where indicates a circular reference, in this case, to the dictionary.

==In spreadsheets==
Circular references also occur in spreadsheets when two cells require each other&#x27;s result. For example, if the value in Cell A1 is to be obtained by adding 5 to the value in Cell B1, and the value in Cell B1 is to be obtained by adding 3 to the value in Cell A1, no values can be computed. (Even if the specifications are A1:=B1+5 and B1:=A1-5, there is still a circular reference. It does not help that, for instance, A1=3 and B1=-2 would satisfy both formulae, as there are infinitely many other possible values of A1 and B1 that can satisfy both instances.)

Circular reference in worksheets can be a very useful technique for solving implicit equations such as the Colebrook equation and many others, which might otherwise require tedious Newton-Raphson algorithms in VBA or use of macros.

A distinction should be made with processes containing a circular reference between those that are incomputable and those that are an iterative calculation with a final output. The latter may fail in spreadsheets not equipped to handle them but are nevertheless still logically valid.

<doc id="744505" wikidata="Q177182" url="?curid=744505" title="Sixto Durán Ballén">
<text>Sixto Alfonso Durán-Ballén Cordovez (July 14, 1921 – November 15, 2016) was an Ecuadorian political figure and architect. He served as Mayor of Quito between 1970 and 1978. In 1951, he co-founded a political party, the Social Christian Party. In 1991, he left the Social Christian Party and formed a new conservative group, the Republican Union Party (PUR), before running for president for the third time in 1992.

Durán-Ballén was elected as President of Ecuador in 1992. He served as congressman in 1984 and again in 1998. he helped to modernize the Ecuadorian economy while facing challenges from the World Bank and oversaw and resolved the Cenepa War during the last years of his presidency. He received positive ratings, upon leaving office four years later on 10 August 1996. His presidency was seen favorably by the public polls, but received mixed opinions from scholars.

==Early life==
Durán-Ballén was born on 14 July 1921, in Boston, Massachusetts. He was born while his parents, Sixto Durán-Ballén Romero and Maria Eugenia Cordovéz y Cayzedo, were on a diplomatic mission in the United States.

Ballén studied at San Jose La Salle grammar schools in Guayaquil and in Quito. His secondary schooling was with the Jesuits at San Gabriel high school. Durán-Ballén studied architecture at Columbia University, where he graduated first in his class in 1945.

He married Josefina Villalobos in New York in 1945.

==Early political career==
Durán-Ballén was one of the founders of the Social Christian Party (PSC) together with Camilo Ponce Enríquez in 1955. Under the presidency of Camilo Ponce Enríquez, he served as minister of public works from 1956 to 1960. Went on to Washington DC where was named Deputy Director of Projects Analysis, at the beginnings of the Inter-American Development Bank. Returning in 1968 to his private practice of Architecture, ran for Mayor and was elected Mayor of Quito in 1970 and re-elected in 1974.

In 1979 he ran as the PSC&#x27;s presidential candidate, but was defeated by the populist Jaime Roldós Aguilera. In 1984, President Leon Febres-Cordero, appointed Durán-Ballén Minister of Housing, position he held until 1988 when the Social Christian Party chose him to run again for president. However &quot;his heart was not in it&quot; as his youngest daughter of his nine children was going through the rigors of bone marrow transplant and chemotherapy because of leukemia. She died in 1989 at the age of 29.

==Presidency (1992–1996)==
===1992 Ecuadorian presidential election===

At the end of 1990 he publicly criticized the direction of the PSC in a public statement. In February 1991 he contested the internal elections for the party leadership, in which the Guayaquil faction (led by Febres-Cordero) succeeded in appointing Jaime Nebot as presidential candidate and national director. Durán-Ballén alleged irregularities in the election of party delegates, to no avail (and despite opinion polls reportedly giving him advantage over Nebot).

As a consequence, Durán-Ballén and his supporters left the party to form the more right-wing Republican Union Party. This decision was widely popular as it was seen as breaking with the political establishment, even being compared with Peru’s Alberto Fujimori in the media. They subsequently entered into a controversial alliance with the Conservative Party. Eventually, Durán defeated Nebot in the second round of the 1992 presidential election.

===Tenure===
Durán-Ballén was inaugurated president on 10 August 1992. At age 71, Ballén was the oldest person to have served as president.
During his time as president, he actively pursued structural reform to modernize the Ecuadorian state and cut down wasteful bureaucratic spending. During his presidency, Ballén lowered the Ecuadorian inflation from 67% to 24%. The result was a significant reduction of government deficits and a thriving private sector. Durán-Ballén also led Ecuador into membership in the WTO, with negotiations being led by his subsecretary of Foreign Affairs, Patricio Izurieta Mora-Bowen. The admission to the WTO had a significant impact on the nation&#x27;s political institutions and export competitiveness.

During his presidency, there was criticism towards Ballén&#x27;s economic policies. Many analysts agree that all these actions carried out under his economic plan meant the prelude to almost absolute insolvency to which the country would arrive in 1998 with an external debt of 16.4 billion dollars. He also faced harsh criticism when he eliminated the External Credit Committee in 1995 and was accused of abuse and subjection to public indebtedness. In response to the corruption allegations against him, Ballén called for a second popular referendum to allow reforms as per modernization of the state, which were largely rejected.

Ballén faced challenges while attempting to secure the modernization of the Ecuadorian economy from the World Bank. The World Bank insistent on the privatization of public services which resulted in the reduction of jobs, the elimination of alleged subsidies and the profitability of the Ecuadorian state management.

In 1995, Ballén proved to be one of Ecuador&#x27;s most successful war-time leaders when his determined leadership united a divided country under the theme &quot;Ni un paso atras&quot; which means &quot;not a single step backwards&quot; during the Cenepa War with Peru. His last years as president, he focused on the resolution of the Cenepa War with President of Peru Alberto Fujimori. The war ended with both nations withdrawing troops on 28 December 1995, a few months before Ballén left office.

On 10 August 1996, Ballén was succeeded by Abdalá Bucaram. Upon leaving office, Ballén was praised by the public opinion, while his economic policies and his involvement in the Cenepa War, caused his presidency to have mixed opinions from scholars.

==Post–presidency (1996–2016)==
Following his presidency, Ballén was elected deputy for the Pichincha Province in 1998. Between 2001 and 2003, he served as an ambassador to the Court of St. James in London.

In 2005, he wrote an autobiography titled &quot;A mi manera... Los años de Carondelet&quot; and edited by the publisher of the Universidad Andina Simón Bolívar. In 2006, he appeared as a candidate for the Andean Parliament for the Christian Democratic Union, but was not elected.

===Death===

Ballén died in his sleep at his home in Northern Quito on the night of 15 November 2016, from natural causes at the age of 95. He is survived by his wife Josefina and their eight children.

His state funeral was held on the following day on 16 November at Quito&#x27;s city hall. His funeral procession later conclude at a religious service at the Cathedral of Quito. The incumbent president, Rafael Correa did not attend the funeral but he declared three days of national mourning. Former president Gustavo Noboa and Ballén&#x27;s first vice president, Alberto Dahik, were also those in attendance. His remains were later buried in a vault at the Church of Santa Teresita in Quito.

==Legacy==
Ballen led Ecuador to a victory in the 1995 conflict with Peru, uniting the country under his famous slogan &quot;ni un paso atrás&quot;. Ballen&#x27;s term in office was also characterized by a continued political stalemate with a Congress led by his former party. It spearheaded many of the corruption allegations against his administration and members of his family, accused of illicit enrichment, in cases such as &quot;Flores y Miel&quot; (&quot;Flowers and Honey&quot;). The impeachment of his Vice President Alberto Dahik, for allegedly using public funds illicitly, further weakened his stance. However, none of these claims were properly supported and are suspected to have been started by his political adversaries to weaken his legacy.

In December 2021, a statue of him was erected in Quito.

<doc id="744508" wikidata="Q3354184" url="?curid=744508" title="Religious views of Charles Darwin">
<text>Charles Darwin&#x27;s views on religion have been the subject of much interest and dispute. His pivotal work in the development of modern biology and evolution theory played a prominent part in debates about religion and science at the time. In the early 20th century, his contributions became a focus of the creation–evolution controversy in the United States.

While Darwin came to heavily dispute the dogmatic prescriptions of the Anglican Church and Christianity in general, later in life he clarified his position as an agnostic in response to a letter from John Fordyce:

:&quot;In my most extreme fluctuations I have never been an atheist in the sense of denying the existence of a God.— I think that generally (&amp; more and more so as I grow older) but not always, that an agnostic would be the most correct description of my state of mind.&quot;

Charles Darwin had a non-conformist Unitarian background, but attended an Anglican school. With the aim of becoming a clergyman, he went to the University of Cambridge for the required Bachelor of Arts degree, which included studies of Anglican theology. He took great interest in natural history and became filled with zeal for science as defined by John Herschel, based on the natural theology of William Paley which presented the argument from divine design in nature to explain adaptation as God acting through laws of nature. On the voyage of the &quot;Beagle&quot; he remained orthodox and looked for &quot;centres of creation&quot; to explain distribution, but towards the end of the voyage began to doubt that species were fixed. By this time he was critical of the Bible as history, and wondered why all religions should not be equally valid. Following his return in October 1836, he developed his novel ideas of geology while speculating about transmutation of species and thinking about religion.

Following Darwin&#x27;s marriage to Emma Wedgwood in January 1839, they shared discussions about Christianity for several years, Emma&#x27;s views being Unitarian like much of her family. The theodicy of Paley and Thomas Malthus vindicated evils such as starvation as a result of a benevolent creator&#x27;s laws which had an overall good effect. To Darwin, natural selection produced the good of adaptation but removed the need for design, and he could not see the work of an omnipotent deity in all the pain and suffering such as the ichneumon wasp paralysing caterpillars as live food for its eggs. Until 1844 he followed Paley in viewing organisms as perfectly adapted with only a few imperfections, and only partly modified that view by 1859. &quot;On the Origin of Species&quot; reflects theological views. Though he thought of religion as a tribal survival strategy, Darwin still believed that God was the ultimate lawgiver, and later recollected that at the time he was convinced of the existence of God as a First Cause and deserved to be called a theist. This view subsequently fluctuated, and he continued to explore conscientious doubts, without forming fixed opinions on certain religious matters.

Darwin continued to play a leading part in the parish work of the local church, but from around 1849 would go for a walk on Sundays while his family attended church. Though reticent about his religious views, in 1879 he responded that he had never been an atheist in the sense of denying the existence of a god, and that generally &quot;an Agnostic would be the more correct description of my state of mind.&quot; He further stated that &quot;Science has nothing to do with Christ, except insofar as the habit of scientific research makes a man cautious in admitting evidence. For myself, I do not believe that there ever has been any revelation. As for a future life, every man must judge for himself between conflicting vague probabilities.&quot;

==Darwin&#x27;s religious background==

Charles Darwin was born during the Napoleonic Wars and grew up in their aftermath, a conservative time when Tory-dominated government closely associated with the established Anglican Church of England repressed Radicalism, but when family memories recalled the 18th-century Enlightenment and a multitude of Non-conformist churches held differing interpretations of Christianity. His Whig supporting extended family of Darwins and Wedgwoods was strongly Unitarian, though one of his grandfathers, Erasmus Darwin, was a freethinker, and his father was quietly a freethinker but as a physician avoided any social conflict with his wealthy Anglican patrons. While Darwin&#x27;s parents were open enough to changing social pressures to have Charles baptised in the Church of England, his pious mother took the children to the Unitarian chapel. After her death when he was only eight he became a boarder at &quot;Shrewsbury School&quot;, an Anglican public school.

===Edinburgh – medical studies and Lamarckian evolution theory===
The two universities in England, namely Oxford and Cambridge, were under the Church of England and required students to sign the &quot;Thirty-nine Articles&quot; of the Anglican faith, so many English Non-conformists sent their children to the Scottish universities which had a better reputation in fields like medicine. Charles initially attended the University of Edinburgh, and while he was put off medicine he took an active interest in natural history at the Plinian Society. One of his proposers for the society was the radical William A. F. Browne, and on 27 March 1827 Browne argued that mind and consciousness were simply aspects of brain activity, not &quot;souls&quot; or spiritual entities separate from the body. A furious debate ensued, and later someone struck out all mention of this materialist heresy from the minutes. This was the first time that Darwin was exposed to militant freethought and the arguments it aroused. On one occasion Robert Edmund Grant discussed Lamarck&#x27;s evolutionary ideas. Darwin was astonished, but had recently read the similar ideas of his grandfather Erasmus and remained indifferent.

Natural history had grown from the idea that the different kinds of plants and animals showed the wonder of God&#x27;s creation, making their study and cataloguing into species worthwhile. In Darwin&#x27;s day it was common for clergymen to be naturalists, though scientific findings had already opened up ideas on creation. The established churches (of England and Scotland) and the English universities remained insistent that species were divinely created and man was distinct from the &quot;lower orders&quot;, but the Unitarian church rejected this teaching and even proclaimed that the human mind was subject to physical law. Erasmus Darwin went further and his &quot;Zoönomia&quot; asks &quot;…would it be too bold to imagine that all warm-blooded animals have arisen from one living filament, which the great First Cause endued with animality… possessing the faculty of continuing to improve by its own inherent activity, and of delivering down these improvements by generation to its posterity, world without end!&quot;, anticipating Lamarckism.

===Cambridge – theology and geology===
When Darwin proved unable to persevere at medical studies, his father sent him to Christ&#x27;s College, Cambridge, for a Bachelor of Arts degree as the first step towards becoming an Anglican parson. Darwin was at first uncertain, he later wrote: &quot;from what little I had heard and thought on the subject I had scruples about declaring my belief in all the dogmas of the Church of England; though otherwise I liked the thought of being a country clergyman. Accordingly I read with care &#x27;Pearson on the Creed&#x27; and a few other books on divinity; and as I did not then in the least doubt the strict and literal truth of every word in the Bible, I soon persuaded myself that our Creed must be fully accepted. It never struck me how illogical it was to say that I believed in what I could not understand and what is in fact unintelligible. I might have said with entire truth that I had no wish to dispute any dogma; but I never was such a fool as to feel and say &#x27;credo quia incredibile&quot;. He was particularly convinced by the reasoning of John Bird Sumner&#x27;s &quot;Evidences of Christianity&quot; which set out the logic that the unbelief of sceptics gave them the dilemma that if Christianity were untrue, then either &quot;Jesus did not live, or he actually lived, but was not the Son of God, hence an imposter.&quot; The Gospels made this highly improbable, as his miracles had convinced unbelievers, hence we had &quot;no right to deny&quot; that such events were probable. Jesus&#x27;s religion was &quot;wonderfully suitable… to our ideas of happiness in this &amp; the next world&quot; and there was &quot;no other way… of explaining the series of evidence &amp; probability.&quot;

The university was essentially tied into the Church of England, with virtually all of the college heads and most of the professors and fellows having been ordained. About half of the undergraduates were destined for the church, like Darwin hoping for a comfortable parish. During Darwin&#x27;s second year, the harmony was disturbed when Cambridge was briefly visited by the Radicals Richard Carlile and the Revd Robert Taylor on an &quot;infidel home missionary tour&quot;, causing a stir before being banned. Taylor would be remembered by Darwin as &quot;the Devil&#x27;s Chaplain&quot;, a warning example of an outcast from society who had challenged Christianity and had been imprisoned for blasphemy.

In his third year, he joined John Stevens Henslow&#x27;s natural history course and was introduced to the Cambridge version of natural theology, part of the liberal Christianity of colleagues such as Adam Sedgwick, George Peacock and William Whewell who all had strong views about science as the search for the laws of nature. Study of nature was study of the work of the Lord, and scientists who were ordained clerics of the Church of England, such as themselves, could follow their enquiries without theological difficulties. Sedgwick gave a talk to the Geological Society of London in 1831 which declared that &quot;No opinion can be heretical, but that which is not true… Conflicting falsehoods we can comprehend; but truths can never war against each other. I affirm, therefore, that we have nothing to fear from the results of our enquiries, provided they be followed in the laborious but secure road of honest induction. In this way we may rest assured that we shall never arrive at conclusions opposed to any truth, either physical or moral, from whatever source that truth may be derived.&quot; For these men, science could not be out of harmony with religion, and in a sense it was religion.

Under pressure in the fourth year, Darwin worked hard at his studies, getting tuition in theology by Henslow. Darwin became particularly interested in the Revd William Paley&#x27;s &quot;Evidences of Christianity&quot; and &quot;Principles of Moral and Political Philosophy&quot;, which were set texts. The latter was becoming outdated. It opposed arguments for increased democracy, but saw no divine right of rule for the sovereign or the state, only &quot;expediency&quot;. Government could be opposed if grievances outweighed the danger and expense to society. The judgement was &quot;Every man for himself&quot;. These ideas had suited the conditions of reasonable rule prevailing when the text was published in 1785, but in 1830 they were dangerous ideas at a time when the French king was deposed by middle class republicans and given refuge in England by the Tory government, and resulting radical street protests demanded suffrage, equality and freedom of religion. Paley&#x27;s text even supported abolition of the &quot;Thirty-nine Articles&quot; of the Anglican faith which every student at Cambridge (and Oxford University) was required to sign. Henslow insisted that &quot;he should be grieved if a single word of the Thirty-nine Articles were altered&quot; and emphasised the need to respect authority. Darwin later wrote that he was convinced that he &quot;could have written out the whole of the &quot;Evidences&quot; with perfect correctness, but not of course in the clear language of Paley. The logic of this book and as I may add of his &quot;Natural Theology&quot; gave me as much delight as did Euclid.&quot;

After doing particularly well in his final exam questions on Paleys&#x27; books, Darwin read Paley&#x27;s &quot;Natural Theology&quot; which set out to refute David Hume&#x27;s argument that the teleological argument for &quot;design&quot; by a Creator was merely a human projection onto the forces of nature. Paley saw a rational proof of God&#x27;s existence in the complexity and perfect adaptation to needs of living beings exquisitely fitted to their places in a happy world, while attacking the evolutionary ideas of Erasmus Darwin as coinciding with atheistic schemes and lacking evidence. Paley&#x27;s benevolent God acted in nature through uniform and universal laws, not arbitrary miracles or changes of laws, and this use of secondary laws provided a theodicy explaining the problem of evil by separating nature from direct divine action, drawing directly on the ideas of Thomas Malthus. For Paley, a Malthusian &quot;system of natural hostilities&quot; of animals living on prey was strictly connected to the surplus of births keeping the world appropriately stocked as circumstances changed, and poverty showed that the world was in a &quot;state of probation… calculated for the production, exercise, and improvement of moral qualities, with a view to a future state&quot;, even where such divine purpose was not obvious. This convinced Charles and encouraged his interest in science. He later wrote &quot;I do not think I hardly ever admired a book more than Paley&#x27;s &quot;Natural Theology&quot;: I could almost formerly have said it by heart.&quot;

He read John Herschel&#x27;s new &quot;Preliminary Discourse on the Study of Natural Philosophy&quot;, learning that nature was governed by laws, and the highest aim of natural philosophy was to understand them through an orderly process of induction, balancing observation and theorising. This exemplified the natural theology that Darwin had learnt in previous years. He also read Alexander von Humboldt&#x27;s &quot;Personal Narrative&quot;, and the two books were immensely influential, stirring up in him &quot;a burning zeal to add even the most humble contribution to the noble structure of Natural Science.&quot;

===Voyage of the &quot;Beagle&quot;===
Darwin planned a visit to the tropics before settling down as a clergyman, and on Henslow&#x27;s advice studied geology with Adam Sedgwick, finding about the ancient age of the Earth, then went with him for two weeks surveying strata in Wales. He returned to find that his arrangements had fallen through, but was given the opportunity to join the &quot;Beagle&quot; survey expedition as a gentleman naturalist and companion to captain Robert FitzRoy. Before they left England FitzRoy gave Darwin a copy of the first volume of Charles Lyell&#x27;s &quot;Principles of Geology&quot;, the subject which would be his primary work.

Darwin was questioning from the outset, and in his first zoology notes he wondered why deep-ocean plankton had been created with so much beauty for little purpose as no one could see them. He saw landforms as supporting Lyell&#x27;s Uniformitarianism which explained features as the outcome of a gradual process over huge periods of time, and quickly showed a gift for theorising about the geology he was examining. He concluded that the land had indeed risen, and referred to loose rock deposits as &quot;part of the long disputed Diluvium&quot;. Around 1825 both Lyell and Sedgwick had supported William Buckland&#x27;s Catastrophism which postulated diluvialism to reconcile findings with the Biblical account of Noah&#x27;s ark, but by 1830 evidence had shown them that the &quot;diluvium&quot; had come from a series of local processes. They still distinguished between diluvial and alluvial deposits, but Sedgwick no longer thought these deposits were connected with Noah&#x27;s flood by the time he taught Darwin, though the debate continued. Darwin&#x27;s notes show him increasingly discounting &quot;debacles&quot; to account for such formations. It was only later that glaciation was accepted as the source of these deposits.

Lyell&#x27;s second volume explained extinctions as a &quot;succession of deaths&quot; due to changed circumstances with new species then being created, but Darwin found giant fossils of extinct mammals with no geological signs of a &quot;diluvial debacle&quot; or environmental change, and so rejected Lyell&#x27;s explanation in favour of Giovanni Battista Brocchi&#x27;s idea that species had somehow aged and died out. On the Galápagos Islands he remained convinced by Lyell&#x27;s idea of species spreading from &quot;centres of creation&quot;, and assumed that species had spread from the mainland rather than originating on these geologically recent volcanic islands. He failed to note locations of most of his finds, but fortunately recorded mockingbirds and plant life with more care. In Australia, reflecting on the marsupial kangaroos and potoroos, he thought them so strange that an unbeliever &quot;might exclaim &#x27;Surely two distinct Creators must have been [at] work; their object however has been the same &amp; certainly the end in each case is complete&#x27;&quot;, yet an antlion he was watching was very similar to its European counterpart. &quot;Now what would the Disbeliever say to this? Would any two workmen ever hit on so beautiful, so simple &amp; yet so artificial a contrivance? It cannot be thought so. – The one hand has surely worked throughout the universe. A Geologist perhaps would suggest, that the periods of Creation have been distinct &amp; remote the one from the other; that the Creator rested in his labor.&quot; Darwin was struggling with inconsistencies in these ideas. As they neared the end of the voyage his thoughts about the mockingbirds shook his confidence that species were fixed and that variation was limited.

In Cape Town, South Africa, Darwin and FitzRoy visited John Herschel. On 20 February 1836, Herschel had written to Lyell praising his &quot;Principles of Geology&quot; as opening a way for bold speculation on &quot;that mystery of mysteries, the replacement of extinct species by others.&quot; Herschel thought catastrophic extinction and renewal &quot;an inadequate conception of the Creator&quot;, and by analogy with other intermediate causes &quot;the origination of fresh species, could it ever come under our cognizance, would be found to be a natural in contradistinction to a miraculous process&quot;. The letter was widely circulated in London, and Darwin remembered the phrase &quot;that mystery of mysteries&quot;. Missionaries were being accused of causing racial tension and profiteering, and after the &quot;Beagle&quot; set to sea on 18 June FitzRoy wrote an open letter to the evangelical &quot;South African Christian Recorder&quot; on the &quot;Moral State of Tahiti&quot; incorporating extracts from both his and Darwin&#x27;s diaries to defend the reputation of missionaries. This was given to a passing ship which took it to Cape Town to become FitzRoy&#x27;s (and Darwin&#x27;s) first published work.

FitzRoy too had seen geological features as supporting Lyell&#x27;s timescale, and on his return to England extracts from his diary stressing the immense age of the Patagonian raised beaches were read to the Royal Geographical Society, but he married a very religious lady and in his &quot;Narrative&quot; of the voyage added a supplement regretting having &quot;remarked to a friend&quot; that these vast plains &quot;could never have been effected by a forty days&#x27; flood&quot;, remarks he ascribed to his own &quot;turn of mind and ignorance of scripture&quot; during the voyage.

==Darwin&#x27;s changing view on faith==

In his later private autobiography, Darwin wrote of the period from October 1836 to January 1839:
:&quot;During these two years I was led to think much about religion. Whilst on board the &quot;Beagle&quot; I was quite orthodox, &amp; I remember being heartily laughed at by several of the officers (though themselves orthodox) for quoting the Bible as an unanswerable authority on some point of morality. I suppose it was the novelty of the argument that amused them. But I had gradually come, by this time, to see that the Old Testament from its manifestly false history of the world, with the Tower of Babel, rainbow as a sign, etc., etc., and from its attributing to God the feelings of a revengeful tyrant, was no more to be trusted than the sacred books of the Hindoos, or the beliefs of any barbarian.&quot;

In seeking to explain his observations, by early 1837 Darwin was speculating in his notebooks on transmutation of species and writing of &quot;my theory&quot;. His journal for 1838 records &quot;All September read a good deal on many subject: thought much upon religion. Beginning of October ditto.&quot; At this time he outlined ideas of comparative anthropology, from his knowledge of different religious beliefs around the world as well as at various times in history, and came to the view that scriptures were unreliable and contradictory.

===Discussions with Emma===
Having decided to marry, Darwin visited his cousin Emma on 29 July 1838 and told her of his ideas on transmutation. On 11 November, he returned and proposed to Emma. Again he discussed his ideas, and about ten days later she wrote, &quot;When I am with you I think all melancholy thoughts keep out of my head but since you are gone some sad ones have forced themselves in, of fear that our opinions on the most important subject should differ widely. My reason tells me that honest &amp; conscientious doubts cannot be a sin, but I feel it would be a painful void between us. I thank you from my heart for your openness with me &amp; I should dread the feeling that you were concealing your opinions from the fear of giving me pain. It is perhaps foolish of me to say this much but my own dear Charley we now do belong to each other &amp; I cannot help being open with you. Will you do me a favour? yes I am sure you will, it is to read our Saviours farewell discourse to his disciples which begins at the end of the 13th Chap of John. It is so full of love to them &amp; devotion &amp; every beautiful feeling. It is the part of the New Testament I love best. This is a whim of mine it would give me great pleasure, though I can hardly tell why I don&#x27;t wish you to give me your opinion about it.&quot;

Darwin had already wondered about the materialism implied by his ideas, noting in his transmutation notebook &quot;Thought (or desires more properly) being hereditary it is difficult to imagine it anything but structure of brain hereditary, analogy points out to this. – love of the deity effect of organization, oh you materialist!&quot; The letter shows Emma&#x27;s tension between her fears that differences of belief would separate them, and her desire to be close and openly share ideas. Emma cherished a belief in the afterlife, and was concerned that they should &quot;belong to each other&quot; for eternity. The Gospel of John says &quot;Love one another&quot; (13:34), then describes Jesus as the Word Incarnate saying &quot;I am the way, the truth and the life: no man comes to the Father, except through me.&quot; (14:6). Desmond and Moore note that the section continues &quot;Whoever does not abide in me is thrown away like a branch and withers; such branches are gathered, thrown into the fire and burned&quot;(15:6). As disbelief later gradually crept over Darwin, he could &quot;hardly see how anyone ought to wish Christianity to be true; for if so the plain language of the text seems to show that the men who do not believe, and this would include my Father, Brother and almost all my best friends, will be everlastingly punished. And this is a damnable doctrine.&quot;

Following Darwin&#x27;s marriage to Emma in January 1839, they shared discussions about Christianity for many years. Unitarianism emphasised inner feeling which overrode the authority of religious texts or doctrine, and her beliefs resulted from intensive study and questioning. They socialised with the Unitarian clergymen James Martineau and John James Tayler, and read their works as well as those of other Unitarian and liberal Anglican authors such as Francis William Newman whose &quot;Phases of faith&quot; described a spiritual journey from Calvinism to theism, all part of widespread and heated debate on the authority of Anglicanism. In Downe Emma attended the Anglican village church, but as a Unitarian had the family turn round in silence when the Trinitarian Nicene Creed was recited.

Soon after their marriage, Emma, while writing about Darwin, felt that &quot;while you [Charles] are acting conscientiously &amp; sincerely wishing, &amp; trying to learn the truth, you cannot be wrong&quot;, and though concerned at the threat to faith of the &quot;habit in scientific pursuits of believing nothing till it is proved&quot;, Emma’s hope that he did not &quot;consider his opinion as formed&quot; proved correct. Methodical conscientious doubt as a state of inquiry rather than disbelief made him open to nature and revelation, and they remained open with each other.

===Theorising===
Darwin was interested in ideas of Natural &quot;laws of harmony&quot;, and made enquiries into animal breeding. Having read the new 6th edition of the Revd. Thomas Malthus&#x27;s &quot;Essay on the Principle of Population&quot;, around late November 1838 he compared breeders selecting traits to a Malthusian Nature selecting from variants thrown up by &quot;chance&quot; so that &quot;every part of newly acquired structure is fully practical &amp; perfected&quot;, thinking this &quot;a beautiful part of my theory&quot;. The theodicy of Paley and Thomas Malthus vindicated evils such as starvation as a result of a benevolent creator&#x27;s laws which had an overall good effect. To Darwin, natural selection produced the good of adaptation but removed the need for design, and he could not see the work of an omnipotent deity in all the pain and suffering such as the ichneumon wasp paralysing caterpillars as live food for its eggs.

Early in 1842, Darwin wrote about his ideas to Lyell, who noted that his ally &quot;denies seeing a beginning to each crop of species&quot;. On 11 January 1844 Darwin mentioned his theorising to the botanist Joseph Dalton Hooker, writing with melodramatic humour &quot;I am almost convinced (quite contrary to opinion I started with) that species are not (it is like confessing a murder) immutable. Heaven forfend me from Lamarck nonsense of a &#x27;tendency to progression&#x27; &#x27;adaptations from the slow willing of animals&#x27; &amp;c,—but the conclusions I am led to are not widely different from his—though the means of change are wholly so—I think I have found out (here&#x27;s presumption!) the simple way by which species become exquisitely adapted to various ends.&quot; Hooker replied &quot;There may in my opinion have been a series of productions on different spots, &amp; also a gradual change of species. I shall be delighted to hear how you think that this change may have taken place, as no presently conceived opinions satisfy me on the subject.&quot;

In November 1844 public controversy erupted over ideas of evolutionary progress in the anonymously published &quot;Vestiges of the Natural History of Creation&quot;, a well written best-seller which widened public interest in transmutation. Darwin scorned its amateurish geology and zoology, but carefully reviewed his own arguments.

From around 1849 Darwin stopped attending church, but Emma and the children continued to attend services. On Sundays Darwin sometimes went with them as far as the lych gate to the churchyard, and then he would go for a walk. During the service, Emma continued to face forward when the congregation turned to face the altar for the Creed, sticking to her Unitarian faith.

===Death of Annie===
At the end of June 1850 his bright nine-year-old daughter Annie who had become a particular favourite and comfort to him fell sick and, after a painful illness, died on 23 April 1851. During Annie&#x27;s long illness Darwin had read books by Francis William Newman, a Unitarian evolutionist who called for a new post-Christian synthesis and wrote that &quot;the fretfulness of a child is an infinite evil&quot;. Darwin wrote at the time, &quot;Our only consolation is that she passed a short, though joyous life.&quot; For three years he had deliberated about the Christian meaning of mortality. This opened a new vision of tragically circumstantial nature. His faith in Christianity had already dwindled away and he had stopped going to church. He wrote out his memories of Annie, but no longer believed in an afterlife or in salvation. Emma believed that Annie had gone to heaven and told this to the children, with the unfortunate result that Henrietta wondered, &quot;If all the angels were men, did women go to heaven?&quot; She worried for months that her naughtiness while Annie was alive would mean that she would go to hell unless God forgave her.

===&quot;On the Origin of Species&quot;===
Darwin continued to avoid public controversy and to accumulate evidence supporting his theory against the anticipated arguments. In 1858 the information that Alfred Russel Wallace now had a similar theory forced an early joint publication of Darwin&#x27;s theory. The reaction to Darwin&#x27;s theory, even after publication of &quot;On the Origin of Species&quot; in 1859, was more muted than he had feared. One of the first responses to review copies came from Charles Kingsley, a Christian socialist country rector and novelist, who wrote that it was &quot;just as noble a conception of Deity, to believe that He created primal forms capable of self development... as to believe that He required a fresh act of intervention to supply the lacunas which He Himself had made.&quot; For the second edition, Darwin added these lines to the last chapter, with attribution to &quot;a celebrated author and divine&quot;.
In 1860 seven liberal Anglican theologians caused a much greater furore by publishing a manifesto titled &quot;Essays and Reviews&quot; in which they sought to make textual criticism of the Bible available to the ordinary reader, as well as supporting Darwin. Their new &quot;higher criticism&quot; represented &quot;the triumph of the rational discourse of logos over myth.&quot; It argued that the Bible should not be read in an entirely literal manner, thus and would in the future become &quot;a bogey of Christian fundamentalists ... but this was only because Western people had lost the original sense of the mythical.&quot; The traditional Christians were just as vocal.

There was close correspondence between Darwin and his American collaborator Asa Gray, a devout Presbyterian who discussed with him the relationship of natural selection to natural theology and published several reviews arguing in detail that they were fully compatible. Darwin financed a pamphlet publishing a collection of these reviews for distribution in Britain. In one 1860 letter to Gray, Darwin expressed his doubts about the teleological argument which claimed nature as evidence of god, though he was still inclined to vaguely believe in an impersonal God as first cause:
===Autobiography on gradually increasing disbelief===
In his autobiography written in 1876 Darwin reviewed questions about Christianity in relation to other religions and how &quot;the more we know of the fixed laws of nature the more incredible do miracles become&quot;. Though &quot;very unwilling to give up my belief&quot;, he found that &quot;disbelief crept over me at a very slow rate, but was at last complete. The rate was so slow that I felt no distress, and have never since doubted even for a single second that my conclusion was correct.&quot; He noted how &quot;The old argument of design in nature, as given by Paley, which formerly seemed to me so conclusive, fails, now that the law of natural selection has been discovered&quot;, and how Paley&#x27;s teleological argument had difficulties with the problem of evil.

Even when writing &quot;On the Origin of Species&quot; in the 1850s he was still inclined to theism, but his views gradually changed to agnosticism:
==Downe parish==
Although he is commonly portrayed as being in conflict with the Church of England, Darwin was supportive of the local parish church.

On moving to Downe, Kent in 1842, Darwin supported the parish church&#x27;s work, and became a good friend of the Revd. John Innes who took over in 1846. Darwin contributed to the church, helped with parish assistance and proposed a benefit society which became the &quot;Down Friendly Society&quot; with Darwin as guardian and treasurer. His wife Emma Darwin became known throughout the parish for helping in the way a parson&#x27;s wife might be expected to, and as well as providing nursing care for her own family&#x27;s frequent illnesses she gave out bread tokens to the hungry and &quot;small pensions for the old, dainties for the ailing, and medical comforts and simple medicine&quot;.

Innes inherited his family home of Milton Brodie, in the Scottish Highlands near Forres. In 1862 he retired there and changed his name to Brodie Innes, leaving the parish in the dubious hands of his curate, the Revd. Stevens, while still remaining the patron. The meagre &quot;living&quot; and lack of a vicarage made it hard to attract a priest of quality. Innes made Darwin treasurer of Downe village school and they continued to correspond, with Innes seeking help and advice on parish matters. The Revd. Stevens proved lax, and departed in 1867. His successors were worse, one absconding with the school&#x27;s funds and the church organ fund after Darwin mistakenly shared the treasurer&#x27;s duties with him: Brodie Innes offered to sell the advowson – the right to appoint the parish priest – to Darwin but Darwin declined. The next was rumoured to have disgraced himself by &quot;walking with girls at night&quot;. Darwin now became involved in helping Innes with detective work, subsequently advising him that the gossip that had reached Innes was not backed up by any reliable evidence.

A new reforming High Church vicar, the Revd. George Sketchley Ffinden, took over the parish in November 1871 and began imposing his ideas. Darwin had to write to Brodie Innes, explaining what had upset the parishioners. Ffinden now usurped control of the village school which had been run for years by a committee of Darwin, Lubbock and the incumbent priest, with a &quot;conscience clause&quot; which protected the children from Anglican indoctrination. Ffinden began lessons on the &quot;Thirty-nine Articles of the Anglican faith&quot;, an unwelcome move from the point of view of the Baptists who had a chapel in the village. Darwin withdrew from the committee and cut his annual donation to the church, but continued with the Friendly Society work.

For two years Emma organised a winter reading room in the local school for local labourers, who subscribed a penny a week to smoke and play games, with &quot;Respectable newspapers &amp; a few books ... &amp; a respectable housekeeper ... there every evening to maintain decorum.&quot; This was a common facility to save men from &quot;resorting to the public house&quot;. In 1873 the Revd. Ffinden opposed it, as &quot;Coffee drinking, bagatelle &amp; other games&quot; had been allowed and &quot;the effects of tobacco smoke &amp; spitting&quot; were seen when the children returned in the morning. Emma got Darwin to get the approval of the education inspectorate in London, and just before Christmas 1873 the Darwins and their neighbours the Lubbocks got the agreement of the school committee, offering to pay for any repairs needed &quot;to afford every possible opportunity to the working class for self improvement &amp; amusement&quot;. A furious Ffinden huffed that it was &quot;quite out of order&quot; for the Darwins to have gone to the inspectorate behind his back. Darwin&#x27;s health suffered as he argued over natural selection with G. J. Mivart, and in the autumn of 1874 Darwin expressed his exasperation at Ffinden when putting in his resignation from the school committee due to ill health.

Ffinden then refused to speak to any of the Darwins, and when two evening lectures were proposed for the village in 1875, Lubbock had to act as an intermediary in requesting use of the schoolroom. The committee agreed, but Ffinden refused to co-operate, writing that
:&quot;I had long been aware of the harmful tendencies to revealed religion of Mr. Darwin&#x27;s views, but ... I had fully determined ... not to let my difference of opinion interfere with a friendly feeling as neighbours, trusting that God&#x27;s grace might in time bring one so highly gifted intellectually and morally to a better mind.&quot; Darwin was equally haughty in return, condescending that &quot;If Mr. F. bows to Mrs. D. and myself, we will return it&quot;.

The dispute with Ffinden reflected the Church of England narrowing its social provision to its own adherents as secular provision of education became more widespread. Though Darwin no longer attended church, he was willing to give patronage to Non-conformism, and the family welcomed and supported the work of the Non-conformist evangelist J. W. C. Fegan in the village of Downe.

==Religion as an evolved social characteristic==
In his 1871 book &quot;The Descent of Man&quot; Darwin clearly saw religion and &quot;moral qualities&quot; as being important evolved human social characteristics. Darwin&#x27;s frequent pairing of &quot;Belief in God&quot; and religion with topics on superstitions and fetishism throughout the book can also be interpreted as indicating how much truth he assigned to the former.

In the introduction Darwin wrote:

: &quot;Ignorance more frequently begets confidence than does knowledge: it is those who know little, and not those who know much, who so positively assert that this or that problem will never be solved by science.&quot;

Later on in the book he dismisses an argument for religion being innate:

: &quot;Belief in God — Religion. — There is no evidence that man was aboriginally endowed with the ennobling belief in the existence of an Omnipotent God. On the contrary there is ample evidence, derived not from hasty travellers, but from men who have long resided with savages, that numerous races have existed, and still exist, who have no idea of one or more gods, and who have no words in their languages to express such an idea. The question is of course wholly distinct from that higher one, whether there exists a Creator and Ruler of the universe; and this has been answered in the affirmative by some of the highest intellects that have ever existed.&quot;

: &quot;The belief in God has often been advanced as not only the greatest, but the most complete of all the distinctions between man and the lower animals. It is however impossible, as we have seen, to maintain that this belief is innate or instinctive in man. On the other hand a belief in all-pervading spiritual agencies seems to be universal; and apparently follows from a considerable advance in man&#x27;s reason, and from a still greater advance in his faculties of imagination, curiosity and wonder. I am aware that the assumed instinctive belief in God has been used by many persons as an argument for His existence. But this is a rash argument, as we should thus be compelled to believe in the existence of many cruel and malignant spirits, only a little more powerful than man; for the belief in them is far more general than in a beneficent Deity. The idea of a universal and beneficent Creator does not seem to arise in the mind of man, until he has been elevated by long-continued culture.&quot;

==Enquiries about religious views==
Fame and honours brought a stream of enquiries about Darwin&#x27;s religious views, leading him to comment &quot;Half the fools throughout Europe write to ask me the stupidest questions.&quot; He sometimes retorted sharply, &quot;I am sorry to have to inform you that I do not believe in the Bible as a divine revelation, &amp; therefore not in Jesus Christ as the Son of God&quot;, and at other times was more guarded, telling a young count studying with Ernst Haeckel that &quot;Science has nothing to do with Christ; except in so far as the habit of scientific research makes a man cautious in admitting evidence. For myself I do not believe that there ever has been any Revelation. As for a future life, every man must judge for himself between conflicting vague probabilities.&quot; He declined a request by the Archbishop of Canterbury to join a &#x27;Private Conference&#x27; of devout scientists to harmonise science and religion, for he saw &quot;no prospect of any benefit arising&quot; from it.

When Brodie Innes sent on a sermon by E. B. Pusey, Darwin responded that he could &quot;hardly see how religion &amp; science can be kept as distinct as he desires, as geology has to treat of the history of the Earth &amp; Biology that of man.— But I most wholly agree with you that there is no reason why the disciples of either school should attack each other with bitterness, though each upholding strictly their beliefs. You, I am sure, have always practically acted in this manner in your conduct towards me &amp; I do not doubt to all others. Nor can I remember that I have ever published a word directly against religion or the clergy.&quot; In response to an enquiry about the same sermon from the botanist Henry Nicholas Ridley, Darwin stated that &quot;Dr Pusey was mistaken in imagining that I wrote the &quot;Origin&quot; with any relation whatever to Theology&quot;, and added that &quot;many years ago when I was collecting facts for the Origin, my belief in what is called a personal God was as firm as that of Dr Pusey himself, &amp; as to the eternity of matter I have never troubled myself about such insoluble questions.— Dr Pusey&#x27;s attack will be as powerless to retard by a day the belief in evolution as were the virulent attacks made by divines fifty years ago against Geology, &amp; the still older ones of the Catholic church against Galileo&quot;. Brodie Innes deplored &quot;unwise and violent&quot; theological attacks on his old friend, for while they had disagreements, &quot;How nicely things would go if other folk were like Darwin and Brodie Innes.&quot;

In a letter to a correspondent at the University of Utrecht in 1873, Darwin expressed agnosticism:
===Caution about publication, spiritualism===
In 1873 Darwin&#x27;s son George wrote an essay which boldly dismissed prayer, divine morals and &quot;future rewards &amp; punishments&quot;. Darwin wrote &quot;I would urge you not to publish it for some months, at the soonest, &amp; then consider whether you think it new &amp; important enough to counterbalance the evils; remembering the cart-loads which have been published on this subject. – The evils on giving pain to others, &amp; injuring your own power &amp; usefulness ... It is an old doctrine of mine that it is of foremost importance for a young author to publish ... only what is very good &amp; new ... remember that an enemy might ask who is this man ... that he should give to the world his opinions on the deepest subjects? ... but my advice is to pause, pause, pause.&quot;

During the public interest in Modern Spiritualism, Darwin attended a séance at Erasmus&#x27;s house in January 1874, but as the room grew stuffy Darwin went upstairs to lie down, missing the show, with sparks, sounds and the table rising above their heads. While Francis Galton thought it a &quot;good séance&quot;, Darwin later wrote &quot;The Lord have mercy on us all, if we have to believe such rubbish&quot; and told Emma that it was &quot;all imposture&quot; and &quot;it would take an enormous weight of evidence&quot; to convince him otherwise. At a second séance Huxley and George found that the medium was nothing but a cheat, to Darwin&#x27;s relief.

In 1876 Darwin wrote the following regarding his publicly stated position of agnosticism:
:&quot;Formerly I was led ... to the firm conviction of the existence of God and the immortality of the soul. In my Journal I wrote that whilst standing in the midst of the grandeur of a Brazilian forest, &quot;it is not possible to give an adequate idea of the higher feelings of wonder, admiration, and devotion, which fill and elevate the mind.&quot; I well remember my conviction that there is more in man than the mere breath of his body. But now, the grandest scenes would not cause any such convictions and feelings to rise in my mind.&quot;

In November 1878 when George Romanes presented his new book refuting theism, &quot;A Candid Examination of Theism&quot; by &quot;Physicus&quot;, Darwin read it with &quot;very great interest&quot;, but found it unconvincing; the arguments it put forward left open the possibility that God had initially created matter and energy with the potential of evolving to become organised.

===Agnosticism===
In 1879 John Fordyce wrote asking if Darwin believed in God, and if theism and evolution were compatible. Darwin replied that &quot;a man may be an ardent Theist and an evolutionist&quot;, citing Charles Kingsley and Asa Gray as examples, and for himself, &quot;In my most extreme fluctuations I have never been an atheist in the sense of denying the existence of a God.— I think that generally (&amp; more and more so as I grow older) but not always, that an agnostic would be the most correct description of my state of mind.&quot;

Those opposing religion often took Darwin as their inspiration and expected his support for their cause, a role he firmly refused. In 1880 there was a huge controversy when the atheist Charles Bradlaugh was elected as a member of parliament and then prevented from taking his seat in the House of Commons. In response, the secularist Edward Aveling toured the country leading protests. In October of that year Aveling wanted to dedicate his book on &quot;Darwin and his Works&quot; to Darwin and asked him for permission. Darwin declined, writing that &quot;though I am a strong advocate for free thought on all subjects, yet it appears to me (whether rightly or wrongly) that direct arguments against Christianity &amp; theism produce hardly any effect on the public; &amp; freedom of thought is best promoted by the gradual illumination of men&#x27;s minds, which follows from the advance of science. It has, therefore, been always my object to avoid writing on religion, &amp; I have confined myself to science. I may, however, have been unduly biased by the pain which it would give some members of my family, if I aided in any way direct attacks on religion.&quot;

====Aveling and Büchner====
In Germany militant &quot;Darwinismus&quot; elevated Darwin to heroic status. When the eminent Freethinker Doctor Ludwig Büchner requested an audience he thought he was greeting a noble ally. To Darwin this was a grotesque misunderstanding, but he felt unable to refuse. Darwin&#x27;s wife Emma Darwin expressed her expectation that their guest &quot;will refrain from airing his very strong religious opinions&quot; and invited their old friend the Revd. John Brodie Innes. On Thursday 28 September 1881 Büchner arrived with Edward Aveling. Darwin&#x27;s son Frank was also present. Darwin wittily explained that &quot;[Brodie] &amp; I have been fast friends for 30 years. We never thoroughly agreed on any subject but once and then we looked at each other and thought one of us must be very ill.&quot;

In uncharacteristically bold discussions after dinner Darwin asked his guests &quot;Why do you call yourselves Atheists?&quot; When they responded that they &quot;did not commit the folly of god-denial, [and] avoided with equal care the folly of god-assertion&quot;, Darwin gave a thoughtful response, concluding that &quot;I am with you in thought, but I should prefer the word Agnostic to the word Atheist.&quot; Aveling replied that, &quot;after all, &#x27;Agnostic&#x27; was but &#x27;Atheist&#x27; writ respectable, and &#x27;Atheist&#x27; was only &#x27;Agnostic&#x27; writ aggressive.&quot; Darwin smiled and responded &quot;Why should you be so aggressive? Is anything gained by trying to force these new ideas upon the mass of mankind? It is all very well for educated, cultured, thoughtful people; but are the masses yet ripe for it?&quot; Aveling and Büchner questioned what would have happened if Darwin had been given that advice before publication of the &quot;Origin&quot;, and had confined &quot;the revolutionary truths of Natural and Sexual Selection to the judicious few&quot;, where would the world be? Many feared danger if new ideas were &quot;proclaimed abroad on the house-tops, and discussed in market-place and home. But he, happily for humanity, had by the gentle, irresistible power of reason, forced his new ideas upon the mass of the people. And the masses had been found ripe for it. Had he kept silence, the tremendous strides taken by human thought during the last twenty-one years would have been shorn of their fair proportions, perhaps had hardly been made at all. His own illustrious example was encouragement, was for a command to every thinker to make known to all his fellows that which he believed to be the truth.&quot;

Their talk turned to religion, and Darwin said &quot;I never gave up Christianity until I was forty years of age.&quot; He agreed that Christianity was &quot;not supported by the evidence&quot;, but he had reached this conclusion only slowly. Aveling recorded this discussion, and published it in 1883 as a penny pamphlet. Francis Darwin thought it gave &quot;quite fairly his impressions of my father&#x27;s views&quot;, but took issue with any suggestion of similar religious views, saying &quot;My father&#x27;s replies implied his preference for the unaggressive attitude of an Agnostic. Dr. Aveling seems to regard the absence of aggressiveness in my father&#x27;s views as distinguishing them in an unessential manner from his own. But, in my judgment, it is precisely differences of this kind which distinguish him so completely from the class of thinkers to which Dr. Aveling belongs.&quot;

==Funeral==
Darwin&#x27;s Westminster Abbey funeral expressed a public feeling of national pride, and religious writers of all persuasions praised his &quot;noble character and his ardent pursuit of truth&quot;, calling him a &quot;true Christian gentleman&quot;. In particular the Unitarians and free religionists, proud of his Dissenting upbringing, supported his naturalistic views. The Unitarian William Carpenter carried a resolution praising Darwin&#x27;s unravelling of &quot;the immutable laws of the Divine Government&quot;, shedding light on &quot;the progress of humanity&quot;, and the Unitarian preacher John White Chadwick from New York wrote that &quot;The nation&#x27;s grandest temple of religion opened its gates and lifted up its everlasting doors and bade the King of Science come in.&quot;

==Posthumous &quot;Autobiography&quot;==
Darwin decided to leave a posthumous memoir for his family, and on Sunday 28 May 1876 he began &quot;Recollections of the Development of my Mind and Character&quot;. He found this candid private memoir easy going, covering his childhood, university, life on the &quot;Beagle&quot; expedition and developing work in science. A section headed &quot;Religious Belief&quot; opened just before his marriage, and frankly discussed his long disagreement with Emma. At first he had been unwilling to give up his faith, and had tried to &quot;invent evidence&quot; supporting the Gospels, but just as his clerical career had died a slow &quot;natural death&quot;, so too did his belief in &quot;Christianity as a divine revelation&quot;. &quot;Inward convictions and feelings&quot; had arisen from natural selection, as had survival instincts, and could not be relied on. He was quick to show Emma&#x27;s side of the story and pay tribute to &quot;your mother, ... so infinitely my superior in every moral quality ... my wise adviser and cheerful comforter&quot;.

&quot;The Autobiography of Charles Darwin&quot; was published posthumously, and quotes about Christianity were omitted from the first edition by Darwin&#x27;s wife Emma and his son Francis because they were deemed dangerous for Charles Darwin&#x27;s reputation. Only in 1958 did Darwin&#x27;s granddaughter Nora Barlow publish a revised edition, which contained the omitted comments. This included statements discussed above in Autobiography on gradually increasing disbelief, and others such as the following:
:&quot;By further reflecting that the clearest evidence would be requisite to make any sane man believe in the miracles by which Christianity is supported, — that the more we know of the fixed laws of nature the more incredible, do miracles become, — that the men at that time were ignorant and credulous to a degree almost incomprehensible by us, — that the Gospels cannot be proved to have been written simultaneously with the events, – that they differ in many important details, far too important as it seemed to me to be admitted as the usual inaccuracies of eyewitness; – by such reflections as these, which I give not as having the least novelty or value, but as they influenced me, I gradually came to disbelieve in Christianity as a divine revelation. The fact that many false religions have spread over large portions of the earth like wild-fire had some weight with me. Beautiful as is the morality of the New Testament, it can hardly be denied that its perfection depends in part on the interpretation which we now put on metaphors and allegories.&quot;

: &quot;I can indeed hardly see how anyone ought to wish Christianity to be true; for if so the plain language of the text seems to show that the men who do not believe, and this would include my Father, Brother and almost all my best friends, will be everlastingly punished. And this is a damnable doctrine.&quot;

: &quot;The old argument of design in nature, as given by Paley, which formerly seemed to me so conclusive, fails, now that the law of natural selection had been discovered. We can no longer argue that, for instance, the beautiful hinge of a bivalve shell must have been made by an intelligent being, like the hinge of a door by man. There seems to be no more design in the variability of organic beings and in the action of natural selection, than in the course which the wind blows. Everything in nature is the result of fixed laws.&quot;

:&quot;At the present day [ 1872] the most usual argument for the existence of an intelligent God is drawn from the deep inward conviction and feelings which are experienced by most persons. But it cannot be doubted that Hindoos, Mahomadans and others might argue in the same manner and with equal force in favor of the existence of one God, or of many Gods, or as with the Buddhists of no God ... This argument would be a valid one if all men of all races had the same inward conviction of the existence of one God: But we know that this is very far from being the case. Therefore I cannot see that such inward convictions and feelings are of any weight as evidence of what really exists.&quot;

==The Lady Hope Story==
The &quot;Lady Hope Story&quot;, first published in 1915, claimed that Darwin had reverted to Christianity on his sickbed. The claims were rejected by Darwin&#x27;s children and have been dismissed as false by historians.

<text>The Institute for Research in Information and Scholarship (IRIS) was founded at Brown University by Andries van Dam, William S. Shipp, and Norman Meyrowitz in 1983 and closed in 1991. It was initially part of a campus-wide effort at Brown to develop a &quot;scholar&#x27;s workstation.&quot;

The Intermedia advanced hypertext authoring system was the most significant project developed at IRIS.

IRIS partnered with the Getty Art History Information Program to conduct a study of the research methods of art historians in the mid 1980s.

<doc id="744516" wikidata="Q329966" url="?curid=744516" title="Abraham Duquesne">
<text>Abraham Duquesne, marquis du Bouchet (; 2 February 1688) was a French naval officer, who also saw service as an admiral in the Swedish navy. He was born in Dieppe, a seaport, in 1610, and was a Huguenot. He was the son of a naval officer and therefore became a sailor himself, spending his early years in merchant service.

==Service in the French navy==
In 1635, he became a &quot;capitaine de vaisseau&quot; (captain) in the French navy. He was appointed to the &quot;Neptune&quot; squadron in 1636. In May 1637, he gained some fame for capturing the island of Lerins from Spain. Around this time, his father died in a conflict with the Spanish, which permanently increased his animosity towards them and he sought revenge. He fought them viciously at the Battle of Guetaria in 1638, during the expedition to Corunna in 1639, and in the battles at Tarragona in 1641, Barcelona and the Cabo de Gata.

==Service in the Swedish navy==
Duquesne then left to join the Royal Swedish navy in 1643. He fought the Danish fleet personally commanded by King Christian IV at the Battle of Colberger Heide in the frigate &quot;Regina&quot; 34. Later, in the Battle of Fehmarn Belt, the Danes were decisively defeated, their admiral Pros Mund killed and his ship taken. After a peace had been reached between the Danes and the Swedes in 1645, he returned to France.

==Return to French service==


He suppressed a revolt at Bordeaux (which was materially supported by his most hated foe, the Spanish) in 1650, during the Fronde outbreaks. During that same year, he created at his own expense a squadron with which he blockaded the Gironde, forcing that city to surrender. This earned him a promotion in rank to &quot;chef d&#x27;escadre&quot; (Rear-Admiral), a castle, and a gift of the entire isle of Indre, Loire-Atlantique. The French and the Spanish made peace in 1659, which left him to fight pirates in the Mediterranean Sea. In 1667 he was promoted &quot;&#x27;Lieutenant-Général&quot; (Vice-Admiral). He distinguished himself in the Third Dutch War, fighting as second in command of the French squadron at the Battle of Solebay and later supporting the insurgents in the revolt of Messina from Spain, fighting Admiral Michel Adriaanzoon de Ruyter, who had the united fleets of Spain and the United Provinces under his command. He fought the combined Dutch-Spanish fleet at the Battle of Stromboli and the Battle of Augusta where De Ruyter was mortally wounded. On 2 June he was present as second in command when the French fleet under Comte and Vivonne attacked and partly destroyed the combined Spanish-Dutch fleet at the Battle of Palermo, which secured French control of the Mediterranean. For this accomplishment he received a personal letter from Louis XIV and was given, in 1681, the title of marquis along with the estate of Bouchet, even though he was a Protestant.

Duquesne also fought the Barbary pirates in 1681 and bombarded Algiers between 1682 and 1683.
In response the Algerians tied the French consul Jean Le Vacher to their huge Baba Merzoug cannon and blasted him towards the French fleet in July 1683. Another French consul received the same treatment in 1688, and the cannon became known as La Consulaire. Duquesne bombarded Genoa in 1684.
==Last years==

In that same year, 1684, he retired from poor health. He may have foreseen the revocation of the Edict of Nantes in 1685, though he was exempted from the proscription. He died in Paris on 2 February 1688.

Abraham&#x27;s heart was placed in a silver box and sent to Aubonne, Switzerland after his death. More than a hundred years later in 1894 the box was discovered and moved to his birthplace in Dieppe.
==Trivia==
* The Marquis Duquesne de Menneville, another famous mariner, was his grandnephew
* 8 vessels of the Royal French Navy have been named in his honour, see French ship &quot;Duquesne&quot;

<doc id="744517" wikidata="Q547571" url="?curid=744517" title="Paul Mazurkiewicz">
<text>Paul Mazurkiewicz Jr. ( ; born September 8, 1968) is an American musician best known as the drummer of the death metal band Cannibal Corpse. 

==Musical career==
Mazurkiewicz started off playing guitar before deciding to focus on drums. He spray-painted his first drum kit black because it was “not metal enough.” Mazurkiewicz&#x27;s biggest influence in his youth was Slayer drummer Dave Lombardo. He said, &quot;Dave Lombardo is my biggest influence, of course. If it wasn&#x27;t for him, I probably wouldn&#x27;t be doing what I&#x27;m doing. He&#x27;s the king of thrash, double bass and all that, so as a teenager, hearing him play in the mid-&#x27;80s, obviously I wasn&#x27;t playing at that point yet — I [was] just starting out — so that really solidified me wanting to play the way I play today, what he was doing and still is doing.&quot; Additionally, he cited band such as Iron Maiden, Metallica, Slayer, Kreator, and Death Angel as influences during his formative years. 

===Cannibal Corpse===
Mazurkiewicz was originally the drummer for the band Tirant Sin alongside two other future Cannibal Corpse members, Chris Barnes and Bob Rusay. The trio joined Alex Webster and Jack Owen in 1988, forming Cannibal Corpse. Mazurkiewicz, along with Webster, is one of two remaining original members of the band. 

Aside from drumming, Mazurkiewicz also plays the guitar, and is the group&#x27;s primary lyricist and contributes heavily to composing songs; he penned the songs &quot;Dead Human Collection&quot;, &quot;Frantic Disembowelment&quot;, &quot;Monolith&quot;, &quot;Carrion Sculpted Entity&quot;, and &quot;Worm Infested&quot;.

===Umbilicus===
In 2022, Mazurkiewicz co-founded Umbilicus, a 1970s-style hard rock group with Deicide guitarist Taylor Nordberg.

===Heaven&#x27;s Gate===
Mazurkiewicz plays drums in Heaven&#x27;s Gate, a crossover thrash project featuring Municipal Waste vocalist Tony Foresta.

== Personal life ==

Mazurkiewicz divorced in 2019. He has one daughter. He became a vegetarian in 2002 and he lives with his family and animals on a farm-like property including a couple of acres of land.

<text>The University of the District of Columbia (UDC) is a public historically black land-grant university in Washington, D.C., United States. Its origins go back to 1851 and is the only public university in the city. UDC is a member school of the Thurgood Marshall College Fund. The full university system offers workforce and certificate programs in addition to associate, baccalaureate, master&#x27;s, professional and doctoral degrees. The university&#x27;s academic schools and programs include the UDC Community College, College of Arts and Sciences, School of Engineering and Applied Sciences, School of Business and Public Administration, Colleges of Agriculture, Urban Sustainability &amp; Environmental Sciences, and David A. Clarke School of Law.

The university operates a flagship campus at Van Ness in the Northwest quadrant of the city with several branch campuses across Washington, DC. Other campuses and sites include the Lamond-Riggs Campus, Congress Heights Campus, aviation facilities (Hangar #2) at Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport and the UDC Firebird Farm Research Farm in Beltsville, Maryland.

==History==
The University of the District of Columbia was created on August 1, 1977, with the consolidation of Teachers College, Federal City College, and Washington Technical Institute into one university.

===Normal School for Colored Girls===

Myrtilla Miner founded the Normal School for Colored Girls with six pupils against considerable racist opposition. On December 3, 1851, it started operations in a rented room about fourteen feet square, in a frame house then owned and occupied as a dwelling by African American Edward Younger. This was the first normal school in the District of Columbia and the fourth in the United States.

The school trained young black women to become teachers. Among its benefactors were the Society of Friends, Henry Ward Beecher, and his sister Harriet Beecher Stowe; Stowe donated $1,000 from the sales of her book &quot;Uncle Tom&#x27;s Cabin&quot;. Although Mayor Walter Lenox believed that education would make Blacks a &quot;restless population&quot; and local residents formed some mobs in opposition to the school, the school remained open until the Civil War began. Reopened after her death, by 1879 the Normal School for Colored Girls was then known as Miner Normal School. It joined the D.C. public education system.

===James Ormond Wilson Normal School===

In 1873, Another institution for white girls was established in Washington D.C. in 1913 was named the Washington Normal School, and it was renamed the Wilson Normal School

===District of Columbia Teachers College===
In 1929, the United States Congress made both schools Miner Normal School and James Ormond Wilson Normal School four-year teachers&#x27; colleges and designated Miner Teachers College for African Americans and Wilson Teachers College for white people. On July 1, 1955, following &quot;Brown v. Board of Education&quot;, the two schools merged into the District of Columbia Teachers College.

===Federal City College &amp; Washington Technical Institute===
On November 7, 1966, the District of District of Columbia School Reform Act, sponsored by U.S. Senator Wayne Morse of Oregon and Representative Ancher Nelsen of Minnesota, was enacted, as Public Law 89-791; it established two additional institutions:
* The Federal City College was created as a four-year liberal arts college. It was originally planned to be a small, selective college of about 700 students. By the time the college opened in 1968, however, admission was quite open and applications had soared to 6000; some 1400 students were placed by lottery.
* The Washington Technical Institute was established as a technical school. Both closed with the 1977 consolidation.

The institutions had been given land-grant status and awarded a $7.24 million endowment (USD), in lieu of a land grant. 

Accreditation was achieved in the early 1970&#x27;s

===University of the District of Columbia===
Efforts to unify the D.C. Teachers College, Federal City College, and Washington Technical Institute under a single administrative structure began in earnest after the passage of the District of Columbia Home Rule Act. A merger of the institutions was approved in 1975, and on August 1, 1977, the three institutions were formally consolidated as the University of the District of Columbia, with Lisle C. Carter named its first president. The Council of the District of Columbia later passed legislation merging the District of Columbia School of Law with the University of the District of Columbia in 1996.

Beginning with the 2009–2010 academic year, UDC&#x27;s programs were split into two separate institutions under an umbrella &quot;university system&quot;-style setup. A new Community College (UDC-CC) assumed UDC&#x27;s associate&#x27;s degree, certificate, continuing education, and workforce development programs, while the UDC Flagship campus continued with its bachelor&#x27;s and graduate degree programs. While UDC-CC maintained an open enrollment policy for entry to its associate degree programs, a high school diploma no longer guaranteed admission into UDC&#x27;s flagship programs.

In late 2012, the university reported that its average expenses of &quot;$35,152 (~$ in ) per full-time student] are 66 percent higher than expenses for comparable schools.&quot; To cut costs, UDC underwent a reorganization and eliminated several degree programs.

In 2012 and 2013, the university eliminated 97 full-time equivalent positions including abolished positions, executive appointments, and vacant funded positions. In late December 2012, the Board of Trustees approved a change in the university&#x27;s executive administration and appointed Rachel Petty to serve as interim COO. During the spring of 2013 James E. Lyons Sr. was hired as an interim President to lead the institution through strategic planning. Since July 1, 2015, president Ronald Mason has led the resurgence of the university by implementing its Equity Imperative. UDC expanded its footprint through campus expansions and community extensions across the District of Columbia. In 2021, the university was ranked 59th in &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot; annual list of Top Performers on Social Mobility for Regional Universities North.

The university launched the District of Columbia&#x27;s Institute of Politics Policy and History in 2019. In response to the George Floyd protests in 2020, the university launched the Institute for the Study and Elimination of White Supremacy

==Campus==
The flagship campus of UDC, known as the Van Ness campus, is in the North Cleveland Park neighborhood at Connecticut Avenue and Van Ness Street in Northwest Washington, D.C. It lends its name to the nearby Van Ness–UDC Metrorail station. Primarily a commuter school, UDC opened its first residential accommodations or dormitories in August 2010 by leasing an apartment building across the street from its campus. UDC plans to open a new residence hall on its main campus by 2012 that could house as many as 300 students. Construction of a new $40 million (~$ in ) student center also began in 2012.

The Van Ness campus opened in 1968 as the campus of the Washington Technical Institute, occupying buildings vacated by the National Bureau of Standards. Following the announcement of the UDC in 1975, work began on redeveloping the campus, with the construction of Buildings 32, 38, and 39 completed in 1976. Seven additional buildings opened in 1981 at the conclusion of a second phase of construction. The DCTC facilities at the old Wilson Teachers College building at 11th and Harvard Streets, NW and at the Franklin School were retired.

Mt. Vernon Square was selected as the site for Federal City College in 1968, and in 1973 FCC took control of the Carnegie Library, closed in 1970 in anticipation of the D.C. Public Library&#x27;s move to the Martin Luther King Jr. Memorial Library. Funding for the campus did not materialize until 1978, however. Facing declining enrollment and lack of funding, operations at the downtown campus were wound down in the 1990s, and the facilities shuttered. &quot;UDC&quot; was removed from the name of the nearby Mount Vernon Square Metro Station in 2001.

In January 2019, UDC leased property near its Van Ness campus as part of its project to improve its infrastructure.

===UDC Police Department===
The UDC Police Department (UDCPD) is an operating element within the Office of Public Safety &amp; Emergency Management. The UDCPD is tasked with providing full-service policing for all UDC assets and stakeholders. The department consists of commissioned officers and non-sworn support staff. UDCPD officers have full authority to investigate crimes, respond to calls for service and effect arrests on any UDC property. OPSEM and the UDCPD are under the command of Marieo Foster who serves as the Chief of Police and Director of Public Safety.

==Academics==
UDC offers 81 undergraduate and graduate degree programs. The Workforce Development Program also offers a variety of practical, nonacademic educational programs and training. The university is accredited by the Middle States Commission on Higher Education.
IPEDs reports UDC&#x27;s full-time student graduation to be 15%, although UDC graduates more District resident students than any other college or university in the District of Columbia. The university relaunched doctoral programs in 2019 with PhDs in Computer Science &amp; Engineering and Urban Leadership &amp; Entrepreneurship. UDC also has an accredited law school, the David A. Clarke School of Law.

The Felix Grant Jazz Archives are maintained by the University of the District of Columbia&#x27;s Jazz Studies Program within the university library. The majority of the archives&#x27; holdings consist of about 45,000 LP albums, 10,000 CDs, reel-to-reel tapes, audio cassettes, 45s, and 78s which were donated to the university by Grant. Books, periodicals, photographs, and other paper materials complement the sound recordings.

===Faculty===
Among UDC&#x27;s faculty are Paul Cooke, who taught English and directed several plays at the university for 22 years, including serving as president, and historian C.L.R. James who taught at the university from 1972 to 1980 and whose work is a staple of subaltern studies and postcolonial literature.

===International programs===
A 1996 academic partnership with the Modern Academy In Maadi (located in Maadi, a southern suburb of Cairo, Egypt) encourages the material, physical, and intellectual growth of students, faculty, and staff of both institutions through Cairo-based UDC Bachelor&#x27;s degrees, Computer Science and Business Administration management programs. In July 2001, the partnership included Accounting and Finance options in Business, Computer Engineering and Information Technology and Electronic Engineering and Communication Technology and graduate studies in Business Administration (MBA).

The Maadi branch campus partnership ended in June 2014. All matriculating students will participate in a teach-out process. No degrees will be conferred after May 2016 to any currently enrolled students.

The UDC&#x27;s adult education department had a collegial relationship with the University of Nairobi for several years, including faculty exchange and doctoral student sponsoring.

===Tuition and scholarships===
The University of the District of Columbia is a public university which receives funds from the D.C. government and U.S. federal government. Therefore, student fees are lower than private universities in the area, with in-state tuition being around $6,000. DC residents&#x27; fees are lower than students that live out of Washington D.C. In addition to its low cost, DC residents who apply to DC Futures Program can receive up to $8,000 In Scholarships.

===Ranking===
UDC is ranked #148 of 178 schools among Regional Universities North by &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot; in its 2024 rankings.

==Student life==
UDC has several Greek-lettered organizations including all nine of the National Pan-Hellenic Council organizations.

UDC publishes &quot;The Trilogy&quot;, a student paper highlighting campus events and national and local news. &quot;The Flightpath&quot; yearbook focuses on graduating students and the years&#x27; activities.

<doc id="744522" wikidata="Q201716" url="?curid=744522" title="Alex Webster">
<text>Alex Webster (born October 25, 1969) is an American musician who is the bassist and a co-founder of the death metal band Cannibal Corpse. He is one of two original remaining members, alongside drummer Paul Mazurkiewicz. He is also the bassist of Blotted Science and the supergroup Conquering Dystopia. Before Cannibal Corpse was formed, he was a member of Beyond Death.

== Career ==
===Early career===
Webster was born in Akron, New York. Webster was born into a musical family. Webster’s father was partially of Scottish descent and played in a bagpipe band, performing in carnivals in various small towns. Webster’s mother was a self-taught pianist. Webster was originally part of the band &quot;Beyond Death&quot;, with ex-Cannibal Corpse guitarist Jack Owen, in 1987. Both met up with Chris Barnes, Bob Rusay and Paul Mazurkiewicz, all of whom were in the band &quot;Tirant Sin&quot;. Webster was the one to come up with the band&#x27;s name, Cannibal Corpse. In an interview, he said that he thought it was a very catchy name for a band.

===Later activities===
Webster recorded bass for Hate Eternal, Erik Rutan&#x27;s death metal band. 

In 2005, Alex was contacted by guitarist Ron Jarzombek about a possible collaboration which became Blotted Science, an all-instrumental extreme metal project. They released their debut album, &quot;The Machinations of Dementia&quot;, in the fall of 2007.

== Equipment ==
Webster currently uses Spector &#x27;Alex Webster Signature Edition&#x27; (based on Euro 5lx basses), DR Strings, and His signature Hammer Smashed Bass pickups by Seymour Duncan paired with a Darkglass Electronics tone capsule preamp wired for 18 volt operation.

On the first two Cannibal Corpse albums, Webster played a Fender Precision Bass that was purchased for him by his mother for his 19th birthday. 

==Personal life==
Webster lives with his wife in Oregon, U.S. He is agnostic, though he was &quot;brought up with a fairly religious upbringing [which was] Protestant, Methodist&quot;.

Webster is known for his interaction with fans of the band, regularly answering questions on the band&#x27;s forum.

== Musical influences ==
When describing his relationship with music, he has stated &quot;I just always liked music since I was a little kid. Music was always a soundtrack in my head to things going on in my life. I always wanted to play. I wanted to play drums when I was about three. I made a drum out of an old butter container and hit it with tinker toys. I was going to make music. Most people who are musicians didn&#x27;t have to have anyone tell them to do it. I would never push music on someone, because it is something that doesn&#x27;t need to be pushed. If you&#x27;re going to make music, you&#x27;re going to make it.&quot;
Webster has stated that he is a big fan of Slayer, and that if any band could cover a Cannibal Corpse song, it would be Slayer.

Webster&#x27;s five all-time favorite albums are (in descending order) Accept&#x27;s &quot;Restless and Wild&quot;, Morbid Angel&#x27;s &quot;Altars of Madness&quot;, Metallica&#x27;s &quot;Master of Puppets&quot;, Iron Maiden&#x27;s &quot;Powerslave&quot; and Slayer&#x27;s &quot;Reign in Blood&quot;, and, in a 2006 interview with LambGoat.com, Webster named his five favourite albums of the past five years as Spawn of Possession&#x27;s &quot;Cabinet&quot;, Necrophagist&#x27;s &quot;Epitaph&quot;, Aeon&#x27;s &quot;Bleeding the False&quot;, Hate Eternal&#x27;s &quot;I, Monarch&quot;, and Spastic Ink&#x27;s &quot;Ink Compatible&quot;.

Webster named the Morbid Angel album &quot;Altars of Madness&quot; one of his all-time favourites, citing &quot;Chapel of Ghouls&quot;, &quot;Immortal Rites&quot;, and &quot;Visions from the Darkside&quot; as his favorite tracks in particular; though prior to naming these three tracks, Webster states that &quot;that whole album is so amazing, it&#x27;s hard to choose [a favourite]&quot;.

Aside from metal, Webster has also expressed a liking for Ohio New Wave band Devo, and, when asked what a musical guilty pleasure of his was, he replied &quot;there&#x27;s some good songs from the first No Doubt album&quot;.

When asked about his favorite Cannibal Corpse song, Webster answered: &quot;I don&#x27;t know, it would be hard to choose one that&#x27;s the &quot;best&quot;, but one of my favorites is &quot;From Skin to Liquid&quot;, mainly because it was so different for us. It showed we didn&#x27;t necessarily have to be playing at warp drive and have gory lyrics to be heavy.&quot;

==Honors==
The prehistoric giant marine worm species &quot;Websteroprion armstrongi&quot; is partially named after Webster. Luke Parry, one of the scientists who described the species, said of the name, &quot;Mats and I are both massive metalheads and think Alex Webster is a monstrously good bass player... (He) just seemed like the perfect fit for a giant worm with saw-like jaws.&quot;

<doc id="744532" wikidata="Q1559442" url="?curid=744532" title="Tehachapi Mountains">
<text>The Tehachapi Mountains (; Kawaiisu: &quot;Tihachipia&quot;, meaning &quot;hard climb&quot;) are a mountain range in the Transverse Ranges system of California in the Western United States. The range extends for approximately in southern Kern County and northwestern Los Angeles County and form part of the boundary between the San Joaquin Valley and the Mojave Desert.

==Geography==
The Tehachapis form a geographic, watershed, habitat, and rain shadow divide separating the San Joaquin Valley to the northwest and the Mojave Desert to the southeast. The Tehachapis&#x27; crest varies in height from approximately . They are southeast of Bakersfield and the Central Valley, and west of Mojave and the Antelope Valley. The range runs southwest to northeast (SW-NE) connecting the Southern Sierra Nevada range on their northeast with the San Emigdio Mountains on the west and Sierra Pelona Mountains on the southwest.

The Tehachapis are delineated from the San Emigdio Mountains by Tejon Pass at the range&#x27;s western end. The dramatic incline of Interstate 5 from the San Joaquin Valley floor up to the pass, is regionally referred to as &quot;The Grapevine&quot;, after Grapevine Canyon which it follows between the northern slopes of the two mountain ranges and is sometimes extended to include the portion of Interstate 5 on the southern side of Tejon Pass, especially during snow closures. The canyon was named after native grapevines, the California grapevine (&quot;Vitis californica&quot;), found at springs on its slopes. The California State Water Project is to the east, with the California Aqueduct pumped by the Edmonston Pumping Plant over/through the Tehachapis to Castaic Lake reservoir.

The Tehachapis are delineated from the Sierra Pelona Mountains by California State Route 138 at the range&#x27;s southwestern end, connecting Interstate 5 and the Antelope Valley.

The Tehachapis are delineated from the Sierra Nevada by Tehachapi Pass and State Route 58 at the range&#x27;s northeastern end, connecting the San Joaquin Valley and Mojave Desert. The Union Pacific north/south railroad line, with the famous Tehachapi Loop, crosses here also. The Tehachapi Pass Wind Farm is on its eastern side.

The Tehachapis, though neither as long or high as other California mountain ranges, are often considered the topographic feature that separates this part of Northern California from Southern California, with the geographic boundary often being Kern County. Some historians consider that California averted a potential split into two separate states – &quot;North California&quot; and &quot;South California&quot; – from the early 20th century Ridge Route construction, the first highway crossing these mountains to connect the Greater Los Angeles and San Joaquin Valley regions.

==Geology==
The Tehachapis are largely the result of the movements of the Garlock Fault, located along the southeastern base of the range, a major transform fault which runs from the San Andreas Fault in the west to the Sierra Nevada Fault on the east and some distance beyond. This earthquake fault is unusual in California in that it is a left-lateral fault — meaning that if one stands facing the fault, the land on the opposite side moves to the left — opposite to most of the state&#x27;s faults which are right-lateral faults.

==Natural history==
The Tehachapi Mountains are a major and crucial wildlife corridor and plant habitat bridge linking the other Transverse Ranges and the California Coast Ranges on the west with the Sierra Nevada on the east. Their relative lack of development, especially in the large Tejon Ranch section, have allowed the continuity of these ecological functions to date.

===Flora===
The Tehachapis are primarily in the California interior chaparral and woodlands sub-ecoregion, with native grasslands, California oak woodlands and oak savanna the predominant habitats. The higher montane elevations include the California mixed evergreen forest plant community. Some of the chaparral woodland species include: canyon live oak (&quot;Quercus chrysolepis&quot;), valley oak (&quot;Quercus lobata&quot;), blue oak (&quot;Quercus douglasii&quot;), and gray pine (&quot;Pinus sabiniana&quot;).

Montane species include: black oak (&quot;Quercus kelloggii&quot;), Coulter pine (&quot;Pinus coulteri&quot;), incense cedar (&quot;Calocedrus decurrens&quot;), white fir (&quot;Abies concolor&quot;), and in a few remote locations small stands of quaking aspen (&quot;Populus tremuloides&quot;).

The Tehachapi linanthus (&quot;Leptosiphon nudatus&quot;) is a phlox plant species endemic to chaparral habitat in the Tehachapi Mountains and the southern Sierra Nevada. The Tehachapi ragwort (&quot;Packera ionophylla&quot;) is an aster plant species endemic to forest habitat in the Tehachapis and eastern Transverse Ranges. The Tehachapi buckwheat (&quot;Eriogonum callistum&quot;) is known only from the chaparral of the Tehachapis.

===Fauna===
The Tehachapi slender salamander is endemic to the Tehachapi Mountains and a listed vulnerable species. The white-eared pocket mouse is endemic to the Tehachapis and San Bernardino Mountains and a listed endangered species.

There are at least 107 bird species, including the Steller&#x27;s jay and mountain chickadee, found in the Tehachapis, many which consume acorns of the black oak (&quot;Quercus kelloggii&quot;) as part of their diet. Other flora found here include the buckbrush and mountain mahogany. The notable raptor is the California condor, a critically endangered species. As in many California mountains, larger fauna includes: mule deer, mountain lion, coyote, fox, black bear, feral pig, bobcat and raccoon.

The Tehachapi Mountains are also the only known breeding site prior to 1860 of the jaguar in the United States. The big cats were found there as recently as the late 1800s.

===Climate===

The range includes and is the boundary between the xeric Mojave Desert and Mediterranean climate zones, and includes the subalpine zone. The majority of the range is in the Mediterranean climate zone, receiving precipitation in the winter similar to the neighboring Transverse Ranges in the Los Padres and Angeles National Forests to the west and southwest. They create a rain shadow for the eastern foothills ecotone into the Mojave climate zone that typically receives only a few inches of precipitation a year, usually in winter. Summer monsoon season can bring localized rains to the higher subalpine parts of the range. The wettest slopes receive about 20–25 inches of precipitation a year, some in the form of snow.

The prevailing wind is northwesterly, funneling up the east–west canyons from the San Joaquin Valley into the valleys, upper canyons, and passes of the Tehachapi range with regularity. The Tehachapi Wind Resource Area exists due to this. To the northwest lies the San Joaquin Valley with its grasslands and oak savanna climbing the broad western slopes of the range. The Tehachapis collect marine and valley moisture, which piles up into fog that blankets the windward sides of the range many weeks of the year. The higher north-facing slopes are mixed evergreen forest, while the south-facing are chaparral and woodlands, typical of the relationship between the cooler moisture-retaining northern slopes and the exposed warmer and drier southern slopes. Canyons can have year-round surface water flow, even on southern slopes, from springs and orographic enhancements bringing extra precipitation and snow from passing storms.

==History==

The origin of the name Tehachapi may come from the Kawaiisu language, derived from the word &quot; &quot;tihachipia&quot; &quot; translated as &quot;hard climb&quot;.
The historic Indigenous peoples of California with homelands in the Tehachapi Mountains were the:
*Kitanemuk
*Kawaiisu
*Serrano people

The historic Mexican land grants in the Tehachapis are:
*Rancho El Tejon (1843)
*Rancho Castac (1843)
*Rancho La Liebre (1846)
*Rancho Los Alamos y Agua Caliente (1846)
All four Tehachapi ranchos were acquired over 1855 to 1866 and combined by Edward Beale. As the Tejon Ranch it stayed in the family until sold by Truxtun Beale 1912. The purchase was by a Harry Chandler—Moses Sherman lead syndicate of land investors, and became a public company in 1936. Tejon Ranch is still one of the largest private landholdings in the state, and currently an undeveloped agricultural and wildland entity. The Tejon Ranch corporation has recently proposed major new developments in portions of the Tehachapi Mountains, including the Tejon Mountain Village and Centennial, California planned urban center.

==Historic sites==
*Oak Creek Pass – Indian trail in the Tehachapis; Francisco Garces was first European to use the pass in 1776
*Fort Tejon: 1854 fort, with the nearby former 1854 Chumash Sebastian Indian Reservation. Now Fort Tejon State Historic Park in the Tejon Pass area.
*1857 Fort Tejon earthquake – moment magnitude of 7.9, average slip along the fault was 
*Monolith Cement Works: supplied concrete for the construction of Hoover Dam and other major public works; east of Tehachapi Pass.
* Old Tejon Pass – Another ancient native trail, used by Pedro Fages in 1772 and Jedediah Smith in 1827.

<text>George Franklin Drew (August 6, 1827 – September 26, 1900) was the 12th Governor of the U.S. state of Florida. He was a Democrat.

== Early life and career ==
George Franklin Drew was born on August 6, 1827 in Alton, New Hampshire. Drew had a grammar school level education and quit going to school when he was 12 because of his family&#x27;s financial problems and ended up working on the family farm. Drew moved to Lowell, Massachusetts in 1841 to become an apprentice. 

He moved to the South in 1847 where he opened a machine shop in Columbus, Georgia. During the American Civil War, Drew was loyal to the Union despite living in the Confederacy. After the Civil War ended, he moved to Ellaville, Florida in 1865 where he opened the largest sawmill in Florida.

Drew was a supporter of Ulysses S. Grant&#x27;s presidential run in 1868. During Reconstruction in Florida, he became the chairman of the Madison County&#x27;s commissioners in 1870. Drew was a candidate for the Florida State Senate in 1872.

== Governorship ==
In 1876, Drew was elected as the Governor of Florida. His candidacy drew support from African-Americans and former Southern Unionists. He was inaugurated on January 2, 1877. 

As governor, Drew attempted to eliminate the state&#x27;s budget deficit from the state&#x27;s previous administration. His legislative program followed the economic orthodoxy of the Bourbon Democrats. Drew proposed cutting expenditures to eliminate Florida&#x27;s budget deficit. He closed the state prison at Chattahoochee and introduced a system of convict leasing.

With regards to education, Drew said it was “cheaper to build schoolhouses and maintain schools than to build poorhouses and jails and support paupers and criminals.” He believed that the state had a responsibility to support the education of African Americans. Minor improvements were made to public school system at the elementary level, such as encouragement of rural education and standardization of textbooks. Drew&#x27;s support did not extent to public high schools which he advocated eliminating. During Drew&#x27;s administration he decided to abandon the Florida Agriculture College which was set to open in Eau Gallie.

Drew opted to not seek a second term in 1880.

== Later life and death ==
He left office on January 4, 1881, returning to the lumber business. Later in life, he settled in Jacksonville serving as the president of the city&#x27;s trade board. Drew died on September 26, 1900, in Jacksonville.

<text>The Tejon Pass , previously known as Portezuelo de Cortes, Portezuela de Castac, and Fort Tejon Pass is a mountain pass between the southwest end of the Tehachapi Mountains and northeastern San Emigdio Mountains, linking Southern California north to the Central Valley. Both the pass and the grade north of it to the Central Valley are commonly referred to as &quot;the Grapevine&quot;. It has been traversed by major roads such as the El Camino Viejo, the Stockton – Los Angeles Road, the Ridge Route, U.S. Route 99, and now Interstate 5.

==Geography==
Tejon Pass marks the intersection of the two largest seismic faults in California; the San Andreas and Garlock fault systems.

The highest point of the pass is near the northwesternmost corner of Los Angeles County, north of Gorman. Its elevation is along Peace Valley Road and Gorman Post Road, northwest of downtown Los Angeles and south of Bakersfield.

Interstate 5, which connects Southern California with the San Joaquin Valley and the north, reaches its highest point in the state, , near the summit of Tejon Pass.

The pass has a gradual rise from its southern approach of at Santa Clarita, but a precipitous descent through Grapevine Canyon toward the San Joaquin Valley on the north, where it ends at Grapevine at .

On its northward slope lies Fort Tejon State Historic Park, the site of a former U.S. Army post, first garrisoned on August 10, 1854.

The pass actually crosses 3 mountain ranges. The stretch from Lake Hughes Road to State Route 138 crosses the Sierra Pelona Mountains, and goes through the Angeles National Forest and the section from SR 138 to Grapevine crosses the Tehachapis and the San Emigdios.

==History==

===Pre-Columbian===
Historians speak of the area around Gorman, California (just south of the crest of the Tejon Pass), as &quot;one of the oldest continuously used roadside rest stops in California.&quot; This is because pre-Columbian indigenous Californians &quot;would have stopped there when it was the Tataviam village of Kulshra&#x27;jek&quot;, a trading crossroads for hundreds to thousands of years.

===18th century===
In 1772, Lieutenant Pedro Fages crossed the pass in pursuit of military deserters, and named it Portezuelo de Cortes (Cortes Pass). Fages also named the canyon beyond the pass leading down into the Tulare Basin, &quot;Cañada de las Uvas&quot; (Canyon of the Grapes) for all the wild California grape vines (&quot;Vitis californica&quot;)
growing in it.

In the late 18th century, El Camino Viejo, a road between Los Angeles and the Mission Santa Clara de Asis began to be used for travel north and south along the western San Joaquin Valley. It crossed over the pass and turned westward up Cuddy Canyon, (avoiding the Cañada de las Uvas) and then descended San Emigdio Creek into the San Joaquin Valley.

===Old Tejon Pass===

In 1806, Father Jose Maria Zalvidea, diarist for the expedition of First Lieutenant Francisco Ruiz into the San Joaquin Valley, named the canyon, creek, and pass which had been discovered in 1776 by the explorer priest, Father Francisco Garces. He recorded the name as &quot;Tejon&quot; (badger)—after a dead badger found at the canyon&#x27;s mouth. This original Tejon Pass (later called &quot;Old Tejon Pass&quot;), is situated 15 miles to the northeast of what is now Tejon Pass. The old pass goes through the Tehachapi Mountains, at the top of the divide between Tejon Creek Canyon in the San Joaquin Valley and Cottonwood Creek Canyon in Antelope Valley.

Before 1854, the main route of travel into the San Joaquin Valley had come directly north from Elizabeth Lake (originally &quot;Laguna de Chico Lopez&quot;) across the Antelope Valley, over this original Tejon Pass, and down into Tejon Canyon, and then proceeded west along Tejon Creek—into the lands of the Rancho Tejon, that had been granted in 1843. This route to the pass diverted from the El Camino Viejo at Elisabeth Lake, and from 1849 to before 1854 it was the main road connecting the southern part of the state to the trail along the eastern side of the San Joaquin Valley to the goldfields to the north.

===19th century===

====Castaic Pass====
In 1843, Rancho Castac was established in La Cañada de las Uvas. During that same year, the first grant of Rancho Los Alamos y Agua Caliente included the pass, which was now called Portezuela de Castac (Castaic Pass).

====Fort Tejon Pass====

After the establishment of Fort Tejon and the Stockton - Los Angeles Road, the Portezuela de Castac began to be called the &quot;Fort Tejon Pass.&quot; The rather poor wagon route of the old Tejon Pass route was generally abandoned, and eventually the Fort Tejon Pass took the shortened name it has today.

In 1858 the Butterfield Overland Mail stagecoach line ran through the pass on the Stockton - Los Angeles Road. The Butterfield Overland was discontinued in 1861 but was replaced by the Telegraph Stage Line, which stopped at almost all the former stations, including Gorman&#x27;s, where the horses were changed. Six of them were used for the pull up from Bakersfield to Gorman&#x27;s.

===20th century===

The Ridge Route was the first automobile highway linking the Central Valley with the Los Angeles Basin. It was laid in a sinuous fashion through the ridges and gullies of the Sierra Pelona Mountains to the Tejon Pass around 1910. The northern portion of this highway, which became a part of U.S. Route 99, was known as &quot;The Grapevine.&quot; The Ridge Route was replaced by a three-lane alternate highway in 1933, a four-lane expressway in 1947, and later by the eight-lane Interstate 5 Freeway in 1970.
A section of the highway known as &quot;Dead Man&#x27;s Curve,&quot; was the &quot;scene of many accidents on the narrow old road,&quot; and in July 1932 it took the life of Jack Klieby, 33, who deliberately drove his truck, transporting gasoline, off the roadway to avoid hitting oncoming automobiles. He died when the truck burst into flames.

The curve &quot;(in adjoining photo)&quot; was eliminated in 1935 with improvements completed from Fort Tejon to Grapevine station. That work &quot;supersedes the worst portions of the old twenty-foot Grapevine Canyon Highway, shortens the length of the road by approximately eight-tenths of a mile and eliminates 2,937 degrees of curvature or the equivalent of eight complete circles,&quot; according to R.M. Gillis of Fresno, District 6 highways engineer.

==Wildlife==
Bears roam the rugged area.

==Weather impacts==
The pass is sunny in summer, spring, and autumn, but is subject to severe weather and closure to traffic in winter. Car engines frequently overheat when ascending the long grade, especially in hot weather. The 40-mile stretch of Interstate 5 between Grapevine and Castaic is sometimes closed by the California Highway Patrol, generally because of the icy conditions combined with the steep grade of the pass, and the high traffic during the winter holidays. The Highway Patrol is also concerned, especially with the number of big-rigs that pass through, that one accident in the snowy conditions might force traffic to slow down or come to a complete stop, leaving hundreds of vehicles stalled at once. Whenever there is such a closure, traffic must either wait for it to reopen, or endure a multi-hour detour.

==Communities==
This historic gap has given its name to the Mountain Communities of the Tejon Pass. Beginning on the south at Santa Clarita, it passes through Castaic, Gorman, and Lebec, to end at Grapevine. It passes by the Tejon Ranch, where two large planned communities—Centennial and Tejon Mountain Village—are proposed.

<text>John Drew (September 3, 1827 – May 21, 1862) was an Irish-American stage actor and theatre manager.

==Early life==
Born Jonathan Henry Drewland in Dublin, Ireland, (then in the former United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland (1801-1922)
to father Thomas L. Drewland and wife / mother Louise Kanten, he was the fifth of their six children. In 1832, he journeyed and crossed the Atlantic Ocean, emigrated to the United States with his family to Boston, Massachusetts in New England. As a child, he spent most of his life living in Boston. This is where he began acting. A younger brother, Frank Drew (1831–1903), also came from Ireland to America, becoming an actor also.

==Career==
After moving to the United States, Drew got a job in Joseph J. Johlen&#x27;s theatrical company. He appeared in a number of Johlen&#x27;s plays, including &quot;Uncle Mutch&quot;, &quot;The Barber Man&quot;, &quot;Canterbury of Livingston&quot; and &quot;The Progrist&quot;.

Drew made his first New York appearance in 1846. He played Irish and light comedy parts with success in many American cities, and was the co-manager of the famous Arch Street Theatre in Philadelphia after 1860 with his actress / wife Louisa Lane Drew (1820-1897), who also assisted in the theatre management along with the nearby Walnut Street Theatre, continuing as manager alone and occasional acting roles after his 1862 death for another three decades to 1892.

==Personal life==
John married Louisa Lane in 1848 this being her third marriage and his first. They had subsequently three children: Louisa (1852–1888), John Jr. (1853–1927), and Georgiana (1856–1893).

Drew died at his home in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania on May 21, 1862, at the early age of 34, after tripping, falling and fatally hitting his head during a party for then 6-year old daughter Georgiana. He was buried in nearby Glenwood Cemetery (now Glenwood Memorial Gardens), in Philadelphia, which was later closed, and his remains were then moved to nearby Mount Vernon Cemetery in Philadelphia. After his death, his wife Louisa Lane Drew took over the management of the Arch Street Theatre for the next three decades up to 1892. The Arch Street venue survived as the second oldest theatre in America until 1936 when it was unfortunately demolished after 108 years.

<text>John Drew Jr. (November 13, 1853 – July 9, 1927), commonly known as John Drew during his life, was an American stage actor noted for his roles in Shakespearean comedy, society drama, and light comedies. He was the eldest son of John Drew Sr., who had given up a blossoming career in whaling for acting, and Louisa Lane Drew, and the brother of Louisa Drew, Georgiana Drew, and Sidney Drew. As such, he was also the uncle of John, Ethel, and Lionel Barrymore, and also great-great-uncle to Drew Barrymore. He was considered to be the leading matinee idol of his day, but unlike most matinee idols Drew&#x27;s acting ability was largely undisputed.

==Life==
Drew was educated at a fine academy in Philadelphia, but the life of the theater would become his primary focus at a young age. His first role as a boy was &quot;Plumper&quot; in &quot;Cool as a Cucumber&quot; at the family&#x27;s Arch Street Theater.
Drew had a long association with Charles Frohman and leading lady Maude Adams. In these years under Frohman, John Drew&#x27;s stardom was established. His first play with Frohman was &quot;The Masked Ball&quot;, a comedy adapted from a French play. This show was primarily a vehicle to establish Drew&#x27;s stardom under Frohman, and it succeeded in that.

Drew was associated originally with the company of Augustin Daly in the 1880s, a man known for managing and training with grim efficiency. Under Daly&#x27;s management, John Drew developed his reputation for versatility, appearing in many varieties of play, but especially in contemporary works that are rarely performed or remembered today. His frequent leading lady with Daly was Ada Rehan. His memoirs, titled &quot;My Years on the Stage&quot;, were published in 1922. His final Broadway play was &quot;The Circle&quot; co-starring fellow veteran star Mrs. Leslie Carter and proved to be a popular comeback for the two Victorian actors. The Circle was made into a silent film in 1925 by MGM directed by Frank Borzage.

Highly esteemed by his fellow actors, John Drew was elected lifetime president of New York City’s theatrical club The Players. The appellation &quot;Jr.&quot;, distinguishing him from his long-deceased actor father, is usually dropped. He died in San Francisco on July 9, 1927, shortly after being visited by his nephews John and Lionel Barrymore, both of whom had taken time off from movie-making on the West Coast. After cremation, his remains were taken to Philadelphia and interred at Mount Vernon Cemetery alongside his wife.

Drew and his wife Josephine (&quot;nee&quot; Baker) had one daughter, Louise Drew (1882–1954). Louise married Broadway actor Jack Devereaux and they had a son, John Drew Devereaux.

<text>Tolui (–1232) was the youngest son of Genghis Khan and Börte. A prominent general during the early Mongol conquests, Tolui was a leading candidate to succeed his father after his death in 1227 and ultimately served as regent of the Mongol Empire until the accession of his brother Ögedei two years later. Tolui&#x27;s wife was Sorghaghtani Beki; their sons included Möngke and Kublai, the fourth and fifth khans of the empire, and Hulagu, the founder of the Ilkhanate.

Tolui was less active than his elder brothers Jochi, Chagatai, and Ögedei during their father&#x27;s rise to power, but once he reached adulthood he was considered the finest warrior of the four. He commanded armies under his father during the first invasion of Jin China (1211–1215), and his distinguished service during the Mongol invasion of the Khwarazmian Empire secured his reputation. After the fall of the cities of Transoxiana in 1220, Genghis dispatched Tolui early the following year to subjugate the region of Khorasan, which had begun to cause trouble for the Mongol armies. Tolui executed his orders with ruthless efficiency, assaulting the major cities of Merv, Nishapur, and Herat, and subjugating numerous others. Medieval chroniclers attributed more than three million deaths to the massacres he ordered at Nishapur and Merv; while these figures are considered exaggerated by modern historians, they are evidence of the abnormal brutality of Tolui&#x27;s campaign.

As the Mongols&#x27; traditional inheritance system was a form of ultimogeniture, Tolui was always a leading candidate to succeed his father. His position was strengthened by the elimination of Jochi and Chagatai, on account of possible illegitimacy and excessive arrogance respectively. Genghis eventually passed Tolui over in favour of Ögedei, who was known for his generosity. Tolui was on his father&#x27;s last campaign when the latter died in mid-1227; as the youngest son, he became regent, in charge of his father&#x27;s burial and the administration of the nation. It is possible that the two-year interregnum was lengthened by Tolui&#x27;s desire to become khan himself; he nevertheless eventually swore allegiance to Ögedei, who was crowned in 1229.

Tolui accompanied Ögedei after the resumption of warfare against the Jin dynasty in 1230. The campaign was successful and they returned home to Mongolia two years later. Tolui died in unclear circumstances in late 1232. The official record was that he died during a shamanic ritual while saving Ögedei from a curse; alternative theories suggest that he died from alcoholism or that Ögedei had him poisoned. Having taken over Tolui&#x27;s lands and estates after his death, Sorghaghtani amassed enough wealth and supporters to ensure that her son Möngke took power in 1251, after the death of Ögedei&#x27;s son Güyük.

==Life==
===Life under Genghis (–1227)===
The year of Tolui&#x27;s birth is disputed; while the historian Christopher Atwood believes he was born in 1191 or 1192, the sinologists Frederick W. Mote and Paul Ratchnevsky placed the date in the late 1180s. He was the fourth son of Temüjin, the future Genghis Khan, and Börte, Temüjin&#x27;s first wife; his elder brothers were Jochi (), Chagatai (), and Ögedei (). He also had five full sisters—in order of birth, these were Qojin, Chechiyegen, Alaqa, Tumelun, and Altun. The name &quot;Tolui&quot; (Mongolian script: , , meaning &#x27;mirror&#x27;) has also been transliterated to English as Toli and Tuluy, among other spellings. The historian Isenbike Togan has speculated that &quot;Tolui&quot; was a title which Genghis intended to replace the pre-imperial epithet , traditionally given to the youngest son.

Shortly after Temüjin&#x27;s campaign against the Tatars , Tolui, then a young child, was the subject of a kidnapping attempt recounted in two sources: the 13th-century Mongolian poem &quot;The Secret History of the Mongols&quot; and the history by the 14th-century Persian historian Rashid al-Din. According to the &quot;Secret History&quot;, the five year-old Tolui was saved by Altani, the wife of the general Boroqul, who held onto the Tatar kidnapper until two other Mongols killed him; Rashid al-Din on the other hand recounts that Tolui was saved by his adopted brother Shigi Qutuqu, then a young adolescent, with the help of a nearby Mongol sheepdog. After the defeat and death of the Kereit khan Toghrul in 1203, Tolui received Toghrul&#x27;s niece Sorghaghtani Beki and granddaughter Doquz Khatun, both Nestorian Christians, as wives. Tolui and Sorghaghtani had their first son, Möngke, in 1209; Kublai and Hulagu followed in 1215 and 1217 respectively, while their final son Ariq Böke was born more than a decade afterwards. Tolui also married Lingqun, the daughter of Kuchlug, prince of the Naiman tribe, and had a son named Qutuqtu with her.

Tolui was considered the best warrior of the sons of Temüjin, who entitled himself Genghis Khan at a kurultai in 1206. He commanded armies during the invasion of Jin China; when Genghis was wounded by an arrow during the siege of Xijing (modern Datong), Tolui was appointed to command the besieging army until the Mongols withdrew. With his brother-in-law Chigu, he assaulted the walls of Dexing in autumn 1213 during preparations for the assault on the Juyong Pass.

====Khorasan campaign (1221)====
During the invasion of the Khwarazmian Empire, which began in 1219, Tolui initially accompanied his father&#x27;s army. They bypassed the ongoing siege at Otrar to attack the major centres of Transoxiana—the Khwarazmshah&#x27;s capital Samarkand and its neighbour Bukhara—in early 1220. The latter was captured in February after a swift siege, while Samarkand fell a couple of months later. Genghis moved southwards into the Turkestan mountain range, where he rested his army for the summer while his generals Jebe and Subutai moved westwards and his sons conducted various operations; he emerged in the autumn to assault and capture Termez. Tolui and his father spent the winter of 1220–1221 dealing with rebels on the upper Vakhsh river in modern-day Tajikistan. By this point, Jebe and Subutai had moved into western Iran, and the cities which had earlier submitted to them in the Khorasan region had become bolder; Genghis Khan&#x27;s son-in law Toquchar was killed by a nascent rebellion at Nishapur in November 1220. After capturing Balkh in early 1221 and while continuing to besiege Taliqan, Genghis dispatched Tolui to Khorasan to make sure that no opposition remained in the extensive and wealthy region. His task was to pacify and subjugate the region and its cities by any means possible, and he carried out the task &quot;with a thoroughness from which that region has never recovered&quot;, in the words of the historian J.A. Boyle.
Tolui&#x27;s army was composed of a tenth of the Mongol invasion force augmented by Khwarazmian conscripts; the historian Carl Sverdrup estimates its size at around 7,000 men. He marched westwards from Balkh to Murichaq, on the present-day Afghanistan–Turkmenistan border, and then crossed the Marghab river and its tributary the Kushk to approach the city of Merv from the south. He ambushed a force of Turkmen raiders during the night of 24 February; the surprise attack caught the raiders off guard, and those who were not killed by the Mongols or did not drown in the river were scattered. The Mongols arrived at Merv the following day. After assessing the city for six days, Tolui came to the conclusion that the city fortifications would withstand a lengthy siege. Having been subjected to a general assault on the seventh day, the townspeople, who twice attempted a sortie to no effect, lost the will to resist and surrendered to the Mongols, who promised to treat them fairly. Tolui, however, reneged on this guarantee, and ordered that the entire population be driven out on the plain and put to the sword, excluding a small number of artisans and children. It was reported that each Mongol soldier was allotted between three and four hundred people to kill; the contemporary chronicler Ibn al-Athir estimated the number of deaths at 700,000, while the chronicler Ata-Malik Juvayni, writing a few decades later, recorded that a cleric spent thirteen days counting the dead and arrived at a figure of 1,300,000.

Tolui had meanwhile marched on south-westerly towards Nishapur, which had already seen a number of events during the war. Muhammad II, the ruler of the Khwarazmian Empire, had arrived nearly a year earlier on 18 April 1220, fleeing the Mongol advance in Transoxiana. He departed in mid-May that year, just in time to escape the armies of Jebe and Subutai, who arrived the following day. The city submitted to the generals, who requested them to reduce their walls and aid any Mongols who passed by. However, the city did not heed these instructions and instead began causing trouble for the Mongols, killing Toquchar when he attempted to enforce control. Jalal al-Din, the eldest son and heir of the now-deceased Muhammad II, arrived at the city on 10 February 1221, attempting to escape the ongoing Mongol siege at Gurganj, the capital of the empire; he remained at the city for only a couple of days before departing in the direction of Zozan.

Tolui arrived at the city on 7 April and the inhabitants, awed by the size of his force, immediately sought to agree surrender terms. Because the killing of the khan&#x27;s son-in-law had been a grave insult to the Mongols, all proposals were rejected; the assault had begun before the end of the day, with the walls being breached on 9 April and the city captured the next day. According to Juvayni, the city was razed in revenge; Toquchar&#x27;s widow supervised the massacre of the entire population of the city, with the exception of 400 craftsmen. Unlike in Merv, all children were killed, and the corpses of the alleged 1,747,000 victims, including all the cats and dogs in the city, were piled in great heaps. The ground was subsequently ploughed over. While marching through the region, Tolui was also sending detachments against surrounding towns such as Abiward, Nasa, Tus, and Jajarm.

There has been some confusion about the fate of Herat, the last of the great cities of Khorasan. The early 20th-century historian Vasily Bartold, citing a local history from the 1400s, stated that none of the inhabitants were killed with the exception of the garrison; meanwhile, the chronicler Minhaj-i Siraj Juzjani, who fought the Mongols nearby, recorded that after an eight-month siege, the city was taken and its population slaughtered. It is now known, thanks to a chronicle rediscovered in 1944, that there were two sieges of Herat. The first started with the execution of a Mongol diplomat in the town; an incensed Tolui launched an eight-day assault, which culminated in the death of the town&#x27;s (governor). From the edge of the city moat, Tolui proclaimed that the inhabitants would be spared if they surrendered. Unlike at Merv, the Mongols honoured their word, only killing the 12,000 men in the city garrison. Having appointed a Mongol overseer to govern the town, Tolui left the region to rejoin his father at Taliqan in mid-1221. The population subsequently rebelled and were besieged for months by the Mongol general Eljigidei, who was said to have killed between 1,600,000 and 2,400,000 people during his sack of the town, in a massacre lasting seven days in June 1222.

The death tolls traditionally attributed to Tolui&#x27;s campaign in Khorasan are considered exaggerated by modern historians. The cities of Merv, Nishapur, and Herat could have only supported fractions of their reported populations, and populations were reported to return almost miraculously to destroyed cities—Genghis Khan&#x27;s adopted son Shigi Qutuqu was said to have ordered the deaths of a further 100,000 at Merv in November 1221, after yet another rebellion. The figures do however clearly represent a demographic catastrophe so extreme the native populations found it difficult to quantify the destruction. The historian Michal Biran has suggested that the speed with which the Mongols brought the pragmatically brutal warfare of East Asia into the less ruthless Muslim world was a factor in this cultural shock.

===Regency and succession question (1227–1229)===

The tribes of the Mongol steppe had no fixed succession system, but often defaulted to some form of ultimogeniture—succession of the youngest son—on the grounds that unlike his older brothers, the youngest son would not have had time to gain a following for himself and needed the help of his father&#x27;s inheritance; but this applied only to property, not to titles. Through the Mongol appanage system, Genghis allocated lands and populations as property to each member of his close family. His brothers Qasar, Hachiun, Temüge, and Belgutei were given lands along the Greater Khingan mountains in the east, and the lands of his three elder sons were located in the west: for Jochi, along the Irtysh river, extending into Siberia and the territory of the Kipchaks; for Chagatai, the former Qara Khitai territories surrounding Almaligh in Turkestan; for Ögedei, lands in Dzungaria; and for Tolui the Mongolian fatherland near the Altai Mountains.

The &quot;Secret History of the Mongols&quot; records that he chose his successor at the behest of his wife Yisui while preparing for the Khwarazmian campaigns in 1219. Rashid al-Din, on the other hand, states that the decision came before the khan&#x27;s final campaign against the Xia dynasty. Regardless of the date, there were five possible candidates: Genghis Khan&#x27;s four sons and his youngest brother Temüge, who had the weakest claim and who was never seriously considered. Even though there was a strong possibility Jochi, born after Börte had been kidnapped and raped by Merkit tribesmen, was illegitimate, Genghis was not particularly concerned by this; nevertheless, he and Jochi became increasingly estranged over time. This was due to Jochi&#x27;s preference for remaining in and growing his own appanage—his actions during the Siege of Gurganj, where his reluctance to destroy a wealthy city that would become part of his territory eventually led to his failure to give Genghis the khan&#x27;s share of the booty, exacerbated the tensions. Genghis was angered by Jochi&#x27;s refusal to attend a kurultai in 1223, allegedly because he was busy hunting, and was considering sending Ögedei and Chagatai to bring him back to heel when news came that Jochi had died from a serious illness.

Chagatai&#x27;s attitude towards Jochi&#x27;s possible succession—he had termed his elder brother &quot;a Merkit bastard&quot; and had brawled with him in front of their father—led Genghis to view him as uncompromising, arrogant, and narrow-minded, despite his great knowledge of Mongol legal customs. His elimination left Ögedei and Tolui as the two primary candidates. Tolui was unquestionably superior in military terms. His campaign in Khorasan had broken the Khwarazmian Empire, while Ögedei was far less able as a commander and was known to drink excessively even by Mongol standards. He was however well-liked by all in the nation and was known for his generosity, courtesy, and willingness to mediate and compromise. Aware of his own lack of military skill, he placed his trust in his capable subordinates. He was also more likely to preserve Mongol traditions than Tolui, whose wife Sorghaghtani, herself a Nestorian Christian, was a patron of many other religions.

Tolui was accompanying his father Genghis Khan when the latter died in 1227 during the campaign against the Xia. As the youngest son, Tolui served as regent and administered the empire; possibly drawing upon previous traditions, he established a precedent for what to do after a khan&#x27;s death. These included the halting of all offensive military actions involving Mongol troops, the establishment of a lengthy mourning period, which the regent would oversee, and the holding of a kurultai which would nominate successors and select them. For Tolui, this presented an opportunity. He was still a viable candidate for succession and had the support of the family of Jochi. Any general kurultai, attended by the commanders Genghis had promoted and honoured, would however observe their former ruler&#x27;s desires without question and appoint Ögedei as ruler. It has been suggested that Tolui&#x27;s reluctance to hold the kurultai was driven by the knowledge of the threat it posed to his ambitions. In the end, Tolui had to be convinced by the bureaucrat Yelu Chucai to hold the kurultai; in 1229, it crowned Ögedei as khan, with Tolui recorded as the first to acclaim the new ruler; the &quot;Secret History&quot;, written by Toluid-favouring chroniclers, possibly exaggerates his role.

===Life under Ögedei and death (1229–1232)===
The remnants of the Jin dynasty in Shaanxi were proving difficult to handle at the start of Ögedei&#x27;s reign: their leading general defeated a Mongol general in 1230 at the Tongguan Pass. Ögedei took to the field himself in autumn, accompanied by Tolui and the latter&#x27;s son Möngke, who had been raised by Ögedei&#x27;s third wife Angqui. Much of the events of this campaign are confused in the sources due to chronological difficulties and later suppressions of taboo information: the following is a rough outline by the historian Christopher Atwood. The defeat at the Tongguan Pass was likely followed by two more, including one over Subutai; these reverses threatened the stability of Ögedei&#x27;s reign and so he set out personally, accompanied by his close family. A number of sources written during the reign of Tolui&#x27;s son Kublai attribute the defeats to Ögedei&#x27;s poor generalship and credit Tolui both for the subsequent victories and for rebuking his brother&#x27;s petulant complaints with words of wisdom.

With the Tongguan Pass securely held by the Jin and the Mongol army suffering from famine in the depleted Shaanxi province, the brothers withdrew to Inner Mongolia to plan. They decided to adopt one of their father&#x27;s ideas: in a massive pincer movement, Tolui, accompanied by Subutai and Shigi Qutuqu, would bypass Tongguan by traversing Song territory to the south of Shaanxi, while Ogedei marched towards the Jin capital Kaifeng along the Yellow River. This risky strategy paid off—although Tolui&#x27;s men allegedly suffered such deprivations they resorted to cannibalism—he successfully managed to gather provisions from untouched Song lands, cross back into the Jin province of Henan, and engage the enemy at Mount Sangfeng on 9 February 1232. Outnumbering Tolui&#x27;s army by a large margin, the Jin threatened to rape all the Mongol women in the army; after Tolui&#x27;s forces emerged victorious, they retaliated with the sodomization of the entire Jin force. Tolui&#x27;s success strengthened his position in the Mongol court, while Ogedei&#x27;s mediocre military performance weakened his own.
Tolui died later that year in mysterious circumstances near Beijing; he had travelled northwards with his brother while Subutai besieged Kaifeng. According to the official records in the &quot;Secret History&quot;, he sacrificed his life in a shamanic ritual to spare Ögedei, who had been cursed by the maleficent spirits of Jin China; although the shamans sought to bribe the spirits with gifts of booty, livestock, or commoners, they were only willing to accept a member of the imperial family. It is recorded that Tolui volunteered for this fate, following a prophecy he had allegedly made during his father&#x27;s lifetime, a peculiar account that has given rise to suspicions that Ögedei had Tolui murdered. Atwood has theorised that these suspicions were the intended aim of the &quot;Secret Historian&quot;, writing under the patronage of Tolui&#x27;s descendants wanting to subtly discredit their Ögedeid rivals. He proposes that the prosaic explanation of a death from alcoholism, as recorded by Juvayni, was the most likely; the official line was nevertheless propagated by Sorghaghtani to cement her family&#x27;s position at the top of the Mongol court.

Sorghaghtani inherited Tolui&#x27;s property after his death on Ögedei&#x27;s command; with the backing of his vast estates in Mongolia, she became one of the most respected and powerful figures in the empire. She played a major role in cultivating an alliance with the descendants of Jochi in the Golden Horde, which culminated in the Toluid Revolution of 1252, the accession of her eldest son Möngke, and a near-total purge of the Ögedeid and Chagataid branches of the imperial family; The Toluids would remain the holders of the imperial title as it evolved into the Yuan dynasty under the second son Kublai and eventually fell, while their third son Hulagu became the founder of the Ilkhanate in Persia. Tolui was later elevated to the status of khan by Kublai, after he established the Yuan dynasty in the late 13th-century, while he and Sorghaghtani also became major figures of the &quot;Eight White Yurts&quot; cult in Mongolia, today headquartered at the Mausoleum of Genghis Khan.

<text>Charles Foix (; 1 February 1882 – 22 March 1927) was a French internist and neurologist.

Charles Foix was born in Salies-de-Béarn, Pyrénées-Atlantiques. He studied medicine at the University of Paris and was a pupil of Pierre Marie at the Salpêtrière Hospital (Paris). He was an intern in 1906, &quot;Médecin des hôpitaux&quot; in 1919 and became &quot;agrégé&quot; in 1923.

Foix taught at Georges Guillain&#x27;s clinic at the Salpêtrière and at Émile Achard&#x27;s at the Beaujon Hospital, always distinguishing himself by his wide knowledge and rational approach.

Foix&#x27; main contributions to the neurology was to relate thrombosis of specific arteries at autopsies with symptoms and signs that he had established in his patients and he wrote a book on the blood supply and anatomy of the brain. With Ion Niculescu he published an imposing treatise on the anatomy and blood supply of the midbrain and interbrain.

A most impressive teacher and clinician, Foix was almost as much at home with general medicine as he was with neurology. He was an accomplished poet, but even a better lyricist.

<text>Hans Adolf Eduard Driesch (28 October 1867 – 17 April 1941) was a German biologist and philosopher from Bad Kreuznach. He is most noted for his early experimental work in embryology and for his neo-vitalist philosophy of entelechy. He has also been credited with performing the first artificial &#x27;cloning&#x27; of an animal in the 1880s, although this claim is dependent on how one defines cloning.

==Early years==

Driesch was educated at the Gelehrtenschule des Johanneums. He began to study medicine in 1886 under August Weismann at the University of Freiburg. In 1887 he attended the University of Jena under Ernst Haeckel, Oscar Hertwig and Christian Ernst Stahl. In 1888 he studied physics and chemistry at the University of Munich. He received his doctorate in 1889. He travelled widely on field and study trips and lecture-tours, visiting Plymouth, India, Zurich and Leipzig where, in 1894, he published his &quot;Analytische Theorie der organischen Entwicklung&quot; or &quot;Analytic Theory of Organic Development&quot;. His interests encompassed mathematics, philosophy and physics as well as biology. He married Margarete Relfferschneidt, and the couple had two children.

==Experiments in embryology==

From 1891 Driesch worked in Naples at the Marine Biological Station, where until 1901 he continued to experiment and seek a theoretical formulation of his results. He enquired into classical and modern philosophy in his search for an adequate theoretical overview and ended by adopting an Aristotlean teleological theory of entelechy.

Under the influence of his teacher Haeckel, Driesch had tested the mechanistic embryological theories of another of Haeckel&#x27;s students, Wilhelm Roux. Driesch studied sea urchin embryos, and found that when he separated the two cells of the embryo after the first cell-division, each developed into a complete sea urchin. This was contrary to his expectation that each cell would develop into the corresponding half of the animal, a prediction based on Wilhelm Roux&#x27;s earlier work with frog embryos. This also happened at the four-cell stage: entire larvae ensued from each of the four cells, albeit smaller than usual. By 1885 Driesch&#x27;s experiments on the sea urchin embryo showed that it was even possible to shuffle the blastomeres of the early embryo without affecting the resulting larva.

These findings suggested that any single cell in the early embryo was capable of forming any part of the developing larva. This seemed to be an important refutation of both early preformation ideas and the later mosaic theory of Wilhelm Roux, and was to be subject to much discussion in the ensuing years. The conclusion caused friction among Driesch, Roux and Haeckel. Driesch&#x27;s findings brought about the adoption of the terms &quot;totipotent&quot; and &quot;pluripotent&quot; cell, referring respectively to a cell that can generate every cell in an organism and one that can generate nearly every cell.

Driesch&#x27;s results were confirmed with greater precision, and the experiments extended, by Sven Hörstadius who showed that conclusions of equivalence between sea urchin embryonic cells were an over-simplification.

==The philosophy of entelechy==

Driesch, believing that his results compromised contemporary mechanistic theories of ontogeny, instead proposed that the autonomy of life that he deduced from this persistence of embryological development despite interferences was due to what he called entelechy, a term borrowed from Aristotle&#x27;s philosophy to indicate a life force which he conceived of as &quot;psychoid&quot; or &quot;mind-like&quot;, that is; non-spatial, intensive, and qualitative rather than spatial, extensive, and quantitative.

Driesch was awarded the chair of natural theology at the University of Aberdeen, where he delivered the Gifford Lectures in 1906 and 1908 on &quot;The Science and Philosophy of the Organism&quot; - the first comprehensive presentation of his ideas. From 1909, determined to take up a career in academic philosophy, he taught natural philosophy at the Faculty of Natural Sciences in Heidelberg. In the ensuing decade he published a complete system of philosophy in three volumes, including his fundamental &quot;Theory of Order&quot; (1912) in which he proposed a three-part &quot;doctrine of order&quot;.

In 1919 he was ordinary professor of systematic philosophy at Cologne and in 1921 professor of philosophy at Leipzig, though he was a visiting professor in Nanjing and Beijing during 1922-23, and in 1923 he received honorable doctor&#x27;s degree from National Southeastern University (later renamed National Central University and Nanjing University) where he taught for a semester. He taught at the University of Wisconsin (1926–27) and in Buenos Aires (1928). In 1933 he was removed from his Leipzig chair and prematurely placed in emeritus status by the Nazi administration, the first non-Jewish academic to be thus expelled, because of his pacifism and open hostility to Nazism. He became interested in parapsychology and published on such phenomena as telepathy, clairvoyance, and telekinesis.

His concept of entelechy was criticized by the scientific community. Biologist J. W. Jenkinson wrote that Driesch was inventing new entities &quot;beyond necessity and the progress of science would be better served by a simpler philosophy.&quot; Zoologist Herbert Spencer Jennings commented that the concept of entelechy &quot;does not help in our understanding of matters in the least.&quot;

His vitalist writings were criticized by historian Ruth Brandon for being based on a religious rather than an objective scientific standpoint.

==Parapsychology==
Driesch developed a deep interest in psychical research and parapsychology. In 1931, he published a methodology of parapsychological research (in German) and in 1933 he published a book on the topic titled &quot;Psychical Research: The Science of the Super-normal&quot;. From 1926 to 1927 he served as the president of the Society for Psychical Research.

<doc id="744569" wikidata="Q7619449" url="?curid=744569" title="Stone–von Neumann theorem">
<text>In mathematics and in theoretical physics, the Stone–von Neumann theorem refers to any one of a number of different formulations of the uniqueness of the canonical commutation relations between position and momentum operators. It is named after Marshall Stone and John von Neumann.

== Representation issues of the commutation relations ==
In quantum mechanics, physical observables are represented mathematically by linear operators on Hilbert spaces.

For a single particle moving on the real line formula_1, there are two important observables: position and momentum. In the Schrödinger representation quantum description of such a particle, the position operator and momentum operator formula_2 are respectively given by
formula_3
on the domain formula_4 of infinitely differentiable functions of compact support on formula_1. Assume formula_6 to be a fixed &quot;non-zero&quot; real number—in quantum theory formula_6 is the reduced Planck constant, which carries units of action (energy &quot;times&quot; time).

The operators formula_8, formula_2 satisfy the canonical commutation relation Lie algebra,
formula_10

Already in his classic book, Hermann Weyl observed that this commutation law was &quot;impossible to satisfy&quot; for linear operators , acting on finite-dimensional spaces unless vanishes. This is apparent from taking the trace over both sides of the latter equation and using the relation ; the left-hand side is zero, the right-hand side is non-zero. Further analysis shows that any two self-adjoint operators satisfying the above commutation relation cannot be both bounded (in fact, a theorem of Wielandt shows the relation cannot be satisfied by elements of &quot;any&quot; normed algebra). For notational convenience, the nonvanishing square root of may be absorbed into the normalization of and , so that, effectively, it is replaced by 1. We assume this normalization in what follows.

The idea of the Stone–von Neumann theorem is that any two irreducible representations of the canonical commutation relations are unitarily equivalent. Since, however, the operators involved are necessarily unbounded (as noted above), there are tricky domain issues that allow for counter-examples. To obtain a rigorous result, one must require that the operators satisfy the exponentiated form of the canonical commutation relations, known as the Weyl relations. The exponentiated operators are bounded and unitary. Although, as noted below, these relations are formally equivalent to the standard canonical commutation relations, this equivalence is not rigorous, because (again) of the unbounded nature of the operators. (There is also a discrete analog of the Weyl relations, which can hold in a finite-dimensional space, namely Sylvester&#x27;s clock and shift matrices in the finite Heisenberg group, discussed below.)

== Uniqueness of representation ==
One would like to classify representations of the canonical commutation relation by two self-adjoint operators acting on separable Hilbert spaces, &quot;up to unitary equivalence&quot;. By Stone&#x27;s theorem, there is a one-to-one correspondence between self-adjoint operators and (strongly continuous) one-parameter unitary groups.

Let and be two self-adjoint operators satisfying the canonical commutation relation, , and and two real parameters. Introduce and , the corresponding unitary groups given by functional calculus. (For the explicit operators and defined above, these are multiplication by and pullback by translation .) A formal computation (using a special case of the Baker–Campbell–Hausdorff formula) readily yields
formula_11

Conversely, given two one-parameter unitary groups and satisfying the braiding relation

formally differentiating at 0 shows that the two infinitesimal generators satisfy the above canonical commutation relation. This braiding formulation of the canonical commutation relations (CCR) for one-parameter unitary groups is called the Weyl form of the CCR.

It is important to note that the preceding derivation is purely formal. Since the operators involved are unbounded, technical issues prevent application of the Baker–Campbell–Hausdorff formula without additional domain assumptions. Indeed, there exist operators satisfying the canonical commutation relation but not the Weyl relations (). Nevertheless, in &quot;good&quot; cases, we expect that operators satisfying the canonical commutation relation will also satisfy the Weyl relations.

The problem thus becomes classifying two jointly irreducible one-parameter unitary groups and which satisfy the Weyl relation on separable Hilbert spaces. The answer is the content of the Stone–von Neumann theorem: &quot;all such pairs of one-parameter unitary groups are unitarily equivalent&quot;. In other words, for any two such and acting jointly irreducibly on a Hilbert space , there is a unitary operator so that
formula_12
where and are the explicit position and momentum operators from earlier. When is in this equation, so, then, in the -representation, it is evident that is unitarily equivalent to , and the spectrum of must range along the entire real line. The analog argument holds for .

There is also a straightforward extension of the Stone–von Neumann theorem to degrees of freedom.
Historically, this result was significant, because it was a key step in proving that Heisenberg&#x27;s matrix mechanics, which presents quantum mechanical observables and dynamics in terms of infinite matrices, is unitarily equivalent to Schrödinger&#x27;s wave mechanical formulation (see Schrödinger picture),
formula_13
=== Representation theory formulation ===
In terms of representation theory, the Stone–von Neumann theorem classifies certain unitary representations of the Heisenberg group. This is discussed in more detail in the Heisenberg group section, below.

Informally stated, with certain technical assumptions, every representation of the Heisenberg group is equivalent to the position operators and momentum operators on . Alternatively, that they are all equivalent to the Weyl algebra (or CCR algebra) on a symplectic space of dimension .

More formally, there is a unique (up to scale) non-trivial central strongly continuous unitary representation.

This was later generalized by Mackey theory – and was the motivation for the introduction of the Heisenberg group in quantum physics.

In detail:
* The continuous Heisenberg group is a central extension of the abelian Lie group by a copy of ,
* the corresponding Heisenberg algebra is a central extension of the abelian Lie algebra (with trivial bracket) by a copy of ,
* the discrete Heisenberg group is a central extension of the free abelian group by a copy of , and
* the discrete Heisenberg group modulo is a central extension of the free abelian -group by a copy of . 

In all cases, if one has a representation , where is an algebra and the center maps to zero, then one simply has a representation of the corresponding abelian group or algebra, which is Fourier theory.

If the center does not map to zero, one has a more interesting theory, particularly if one restricts oneself to &quot;central&quot; representations.

Concretely, by a central representation one means a representation such that the center of the Heisenberg group maps into the center of the algebra: for example, if one is studying matrix representations or representations by operators on a Hilbert space, then the center of the matrix algebra or the operator algebra is the scalar matrices. Thus the representation of the center of the Heisenberg group is determined by a scale value, called the quantization value (in physics terms, the Planck constant), and if this goes to zero, one gets a representation of the abelian group (in physics terms, this is the classical limit).

More formally, the group algebra of the Heisenberg group over its field of scalars &quot;K&quot;, written , has center , so rather than simply thinking of the group algebra as an algebra over the field , one may think of it as an algebra over the commutative algebra . As the center of a matrix algebra or operator algebra is the scalar matrices, a -structure on the matrix algebra is a choice of scalar matrix – a choice of scale. Given such a choice of scale, a central representation of the Heisenberg group is a map of -algebras , which is the formal way of saying that it sends the center to a chosen scale.

Then the Stone–von Neumann theorem is that, given the standard quantum mechanical scale (effectively, the value of ħ), every strongly continuous unitary representation is unitarily equivalent to the standard representation with position and momentum.

=== Reformulation via Fourier transform ===
Let be a locally compact abelian group and be the Pontryagin dual of . The Fourier–Plancherel transform defined by
formula_14
extends to a C*-isomorphism from the group C*-algebra of and , i.e. the spectrum of is precisely . When is the real line , this is Stone&#x27;s theorem characterizing one-parameter unitary groups. The theorem of Stone–von Neumann can also be restated using similar language.

The group acts on the *-algebra by right translation : for in and in ,
formula_15

Under the isomorphism given above, this action becomes the natural action of on :
formula_16

So a covariant representation corresponding to the *-crossed product
formula_17
is a unitary representation of and of such that
formula_18

It is a general fact that covariant representations are in one-to-one correspondence with *-representation of the corresponding crossed product. On the other hand, all irreducible representations of
formula_19
are unitarily equivalent to the formula_20, the compact operators on . Therefore, all pairs are unitarily equivalent. Specializing to the case where yields the Stone–von Neumann theorem.

== Heisenberg group ==
The above canonical commutation relations for , are identical to the commutation relations that specify the Lie algebra of the general Heisenberg group for a positive integer. This is the Lie group of square matrices of the form
formula_21

In fact, using the Heisenberg group, one can reformulate the Stone von Neumann theorem in the language of representation theory. 

Note that the center of consists of matrices . However, this center is &quot;not&quot; the identity operator in Heisenberg&#x27;s original CCRs. The Heisenberg group Lie algebra generators, e.g. for , are
formula_22
and the central generator is not the identity.

All these representations are unitarily inequivalent; and any irreducible representation which is not trivial on the center of is unitarily equivalent to exactly one of these.

Note that is a unitary operator because it is the composition of two operators which are easily seen to be unitary: the translation to the &quot;left&quot; by and multiplication by a function of absolute value 1. To show is multiplicative is a straightforward calculation. The hard part of the theorem is showing the uniqueness; this claim, nevertheless, follows easily from the Stone–von Neumann theorem as stated above. We will sketch below a proof of the corresponding Stone–von Neumann theorem for certain finite Heisenberg groups.

In particular, irreducible representations , of the Heisenberg group which are non-trivial on the center of are unitarily equivalent if and only if for any in the center of .

One representation of the Heisenberg group which is important in number theory and the theory of modular forms is the theta representation, so named because the Jacobi theta function is invariant under the action of the discrete subgroup of the Heisenberg group.

=== Relation to the Fourier transform ===
For any non-zero , the mapping
formula_23
is an automorphism of which is the identity on the center of . In particular, the representations and are unitarily equivalent. This means that there is a unitary operator on such that, for any in ,
formula_24

Moreover, by irreducibility of the representations , it follows that up to a scalar, such an operator is unique (cf. Schur&#x27;s lemma). Since is unitary, this scalar multiple is uniquely determined and hence such an operator is unique.

This means that, ignoring the factor of in the definition of the Fourier transform,
formula_25

This theorem has the immediate implication that the Fourier transform is unitary, also known as the Plancherel theorem. Moreover, 
formula_26

From this fact the Fourier inversion formula easily follows.

== Example: Segal–Bargmann space ==
The Segal–Bargmann space is the space of holomorphic functions on that are square-integrable with respect to a Gaussian measure. Fock observed in 1920s that the operators
formula_27
acting on holomorphic functions, satisfy the same commutation relations as the usual annihilation and creation operators, namely,
formula_28

In 1961, Bargmann showed that is actually the adjoint of with respect to the inner product coming from the Gaussian measure. By taking appropriate linear combinations of and , one can then obtain &quot;position&quot; and &quot;momentum&quot; operators satisfying the canonical commutation relations. It is not hard to show that the exponentials of these operators satisfy the Weyl relations and that the exponentiated operators act irreducibly. The Stone–von Neumann theorem therefore applies and implies the existence of a unitary map from to the Segal–Bargmann space that intertwines the usual annihilation and creation operators with the operators and . This unitary map is the Segal–Bargmann transform.

== Representations of finite Heisenberg groups ==
The Heisenberg group is defined for any commutative ring . In this section let us specialize to the field for a prime. This field has the property that there is an embedding of as an additive group into the circle group . Note that is finite with cardinality . For finite Heisenberg group one can give a simple proof of the Stone–von Neumann theorem using simple properties of character functions of representations. These properties follow from the orthogonality relations for characters of representations of finite groups.

For any non-zero in define the representation on the finite-dimensional inner product space by
formula_29

It follows that
formula_30

By the orthogonality relations for characters of representations of finite groups this fact implies the corresponding Stone–von Neumann theorem for Heisenberg groups , particularly:
* Irreducibility of 
* Pairwise inequivalence of all the representations .
Actually, all irreducible representations of on which the center acts nontrivially arise in this way.

== Generalizations ==
The Stone–von Neumann theorem admits numerous generalizations. Much of the early work of George Mackey was directed at obtaining a formulation of the theory of induced representations developed originally by Frobenius for finite groups to the context of unitary representations of locally compact topological groups.

<text>Tigra (Greer Grant Nelson) is a superhero appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. Created by writer-editor Roy Thomas and artist Wally Wood (Marie Severin was then brought in to help layout the art), with her early adventures written by Linda Fite, the character first appeared as the superpowered and gadget-wielding crime fighter the Cat in &quot;The Claws of the Cat&quot; #1 (November 1972). She first appeared as Tigra in &quot;Giant-Size Creatures&quot; #1 (July 1974), by writer Tony Isabella and artist Don Perlin.

==Publication history==
The Cat was introduced in one of a trio of Marvel Comics aimed at a female audience, alongside &quot;Night Nurse&quot; and &quot;Shanna the She-Devil&quot;. Marvel writer-editor Roy Thomas recalled in 2007:

Marie Severin commented on the characters design stating &quot;They wanted her to look like a cat. The sash was my idea, I&#x27;m pretty sure. The sash was just an element of flair, not having a tail. She had something on her feet so she could climb buildings. that all made sense in the realm of the nonsense of comic books&quot;

The series lasted four issues, each with a different art team. Severin was teamed with acclaimed 1950s EC Comics artist Wally Wood as inker for the premiere, followed by Severin and inker Jim Mooney in issue #2; newcomer Paty Greer co-penciling with 1940s Golden Age of Comic Books legend Bill Everett, who also inked, in issue #3; and Jim Starlin and Alan Weiss co-penciling the finale, with Frank McLaughlin inking. A fifth issue of the series was drawn by Ramona Fradon, but the title was cancelled due to lack of sales on previous issues. Severin attributes the character&#x27;s sensual appearance to Wood: &quot;I remember saying, &#x27;My God, I drew this woman and Wally inked her like she&#x27;s wrapped in Saran Wrap.&#x27; His storytelling always had lovely inking, nice blacks and everything, but I didn&#x27;t have her that revealing. The boys loved his work, though.&quot;

The Cat appeared alongside Spider-Man in &quot;Marvel Team-Up&quot; #8 (April 1973) during her series&#x27; brief run. After a year&#x27;s absence, she was revamped as the superpowered, part-animal Tigra in a two-part story in &quot;Giant-Size Creatures&quot; #1 (July 1974; &quot;Giant-Size&quot; refers to the comic&#x27;s page-count, not giant creatures) and &quot;Werewolf by Night&quot; #20 (August 1974). Writer Tony Isabella recounted &quot;My memory may be a bit shaky here, but I recall the Giant-Size books were approved and put on the schedule without a lot of lead time... I think I got the assignment one day, pitched the idea on the next, and one day later was sitting down with Roy [Thomas] and Gil Kane to work out what Tigra would look like.&quot; He also names Don Perlin and John Romita Sr. as having a hand in Tigra&#x27;s appearance, and credits Thomas with coming up with the name. Tigra made her solo-feature debut with a 15-page story in the black-and-white horror-comics magazine &quot;Monsters Unleashed&quot; #10 (February 1975), followed by a brief run in the umbrella series &quot;Marvel Chillers&quot; #3-7 (February–October 1976), and one more solo story in &quot;Marvel Premiere&quot; #42 (June 1978). Like &quot;The Claws of the Cat&quot;, &quot;Marvel Chillers&quot; was also cancelled due to struggling sales.

Tigra went on to guest star throughout the Marvel line, often appearing in issues of the superhero-team comic &quot;The Avengers&quot; and later in the cast of the spin-off comic &quot;West Coast Avengers&quot;. She starred in the four-issue miniseries &quot;Tigra&quot; (May–August 2002) by writer Christina Z. and artist Mike Deodato, and has since guest starred in &quot;She-Hulk&quot;, &quot;Civil War&quot;, various Avengers comics, and elsewhere.

Tigra appeared as a supporting character in &quot;Avengers Academy&quot; from issue #1 (August 2010) to its final issue, #39 (January 2013).

==Fictional character biography==

===The Cat===

Greer Grant was a native of Chicago, Illinois. She was a sophomore at the University of Chicago when she met her future husband, policeman Bill Nelson. She left college to marry him. The marriage was a strong one, flawed only by Bill&#x27;s overprotective nature. Bill was killed in an off-duty shooting, and Greer had to find a job of her own. After weeks of searching, she ran into her old physics professor, Dr. Joanne Tumulo, and signed on as her research assistant.

Dr. Tumulo was working on human enhancement methods effective for women. For several reasons, including distrust for the haphephobic Malcolm Donalbain (Tumulo&#x27;s financial backer), distaste for Shirlee Bryant (his chosen subject), and Greer&#x27;s own enthusiasm, Tumolo decided to let her friend undergo the treatment as well.

Greer emerged from the regimen with greatly enhanced physical and mental capabilities, including the peculiar tendency to feel others&#x27; pain. Shirlee emerged with similar physical capacity but considerably less mental empowerment, a result they blamed on her lack of adherence to the preparatory regimen.

Tumolo then investigated further, and discovered that Donalbain had created a mind-control device and a set of cat-themed gadgets, with which he intended to make Shirlee his mindless superhuman enforcer. However, she fell to her death while testing the grapple-claw.

Stealing away, Dr. Tumulo presented the story to Greer, along with a spare Cat costume and gadget-set as evidence. However, her intention to call the police was thwarted by a bombing at her lab, which claimed her life.
Greer then donned the suit, and set out to put an end to his scheme. With her powers, she adapted quickly to the strange garb and attacked Donalbain&#x27;s headquarters and he committed suicide rather than let her touch him. A fire set off by the earlier fight then destroyed Donalbain&#x27;s headquarters, including his copy of the enhancement machine.

Greer then embarked on a brief crimefighting career as the Cat.

Years later, another of Donalbain&#x27;s Cat costumes surfaced when Patsy Walker discovered it while accompanying the Avengers. Donning it, she began calling herself the Hellcat.

===Tigra===
&quot;The Tigra&quot; is the historical defender/champion of the Cat People, a humanoid race created by sorcery during the Dark Ages. Concerned about the Cat People&#x27;s uncontrollable population growth and savagery, a community of sorcerers eventually banished the entire original Cat People population to a demonic netherworldly realm.

The two very first Cat People, who were themselves very capable scientists and sorcerers, were able to evade banishment through their magic. They continued to live among humanity in secret and worked to refine the Cat People&#x27;s biology to make a peaceful integration into the human population possible. They were constantly persecuted and required a protector. Discovering that the original spell for transforming cats into Cat People like themselves had been rendered inoperative, they created a process combining science, sorcery, and focused mental power that could transform a human female into a &quot;Tigra&quot;, a humanoid tiger-like being with abilities that far surpassed those of either race.

This unnamed first Tigra defended the Cat People with great effectiveness, and allowed a new community to establish themselves on Earth, separate from the group that had been banished. This new population continued to live amongst humanity in secrecy through the present day, relying on enchantments that cast the illusion of a human appearance.

Nothing is known about the other Tigras who may have existed, or even if there have been more than two. At the time when Greer was transformed into Tigra, &quot;the Tigra&quot; was only remembered by the Cat People as a distant, but powerful, legend. It has been strongly implied that only one Tigra can exist at any given time.

Dr. Tumulo was revealed to be one of these modern Cat People. When members of HYDRA tracked Tumolo down to obtain &quot;the Final Secret&quot; (the Black Death plague, which was another creation of the first two Cat People), Greer once again donned the Cat costume and drove them off. However, she was mortally injured by a blast from one of their alpha radiation pistols.

Greer regained consciousness in a Baja California cave, surrounded by a gathering of Cat People summoned by Tumolo. Rapidly dying from the radiation&#x27;s effects, Greer was offered one last hope of survival: a combination of ancient science, sorcery, and mental power that would transform her into Tigra, the Cat People&#x27;s legendary half-human, half-cat warrior. She readily consented, began wearing only her black bikini from this time on, and arose from the ceremony as a superhumanly-powered human-animal hybrid. Striped fur covered her entire body, her hands and feet bore razor-sharp claws, her teeth became long and pointed, and her eyes were now cat&#x27;s eyes. In addition to superhuman strength and senses, she also gained many of the drives and instincts of a cat. Soon after, she encountered the Werewolf.

Though initially unable to change back to her human self, Tigra later received as a mystical cat-headed amulet that allowed her to transform at will. She seldom made use of it, preferring her feline superpowered form and mostly abandoning her civilian identity.

Greer resumed her superhero career, with most of the world unaware that the woman who briefly fought crime as the Cat was now the feline Tigra. She fought alongside most of Marvel&#x27;s heavy-hitters in wide-ranging adventures. She first battled Kraven the Hunter, and then teamed with Spider-Man against Kraven. She also became a friend and associate of the Fantastic Four.

When the Avengers found themselves shorthanded, Moondragon used her mental powers to compel a dozen unaffiliated heroes (apparently selected at random) to travel to Avengers Mansion and audition for the vacant position. Though he disapproved of Moondragon&#x27;s methods, Captain America offered Tigra a spot on the team.

Although Tigra&#x27;s first tenure with the Avengers was brief, she served well. She also aided the X-Men against Deathbird. Her time with the Avengers was highlighted by her saving the world from destruction by the Molecule Man single-handed, who intended to consume the planet&#x27;s energy, like Galactus. Alone among the Avengers, she was able to get close enough to him to talk him out of his plan. She convinced him to seek help from a therapist and the Molecule Man has ceased to be a threat to this day.

The Avengers fought the Ghost Rider, who blasted the team with his terror-inducing hellfire. The nature of Tigra&#x27;s powers caused her to be affected by the exposure on a far deeper level than her teammates. She was left with great self-doubts about her qualifications as a member of Earth&#x27;s premier superhero team, particularly alongside such heavy-hitters as Thor and Iron Man. Ultimately she resigned her membership, leaving the team on good terms.

She resumed her modeling career, moving to San Francisco when employers on the East Coast proved unreceptive to the idea of a cat person model. There she befriended private investigator Jessica Drew, and aided her on several cases, but had no better luck with modeling work there than on the East Coast and accepted an offer from the Vision to become a founding member of the Avengers&#x27; new West Coast-based team. Alongside the new West Coast Avengers, she fought Graviton, and became a close friend of Wonder Man. She also began a flirtation with Henry Pym.

While with the West Coast Avengers, she seemed to have shed the remainders of her hellfire-induced self-doubt. However, the cat-like aspects of her personality (such as a penchant for savagery and a need for affection) had begun to dominate her human intellect, causing her increasing distress. She sought help from her Avengers teammates in overcoming the &quot;cat&quot; side of her personality, which had caused her to become the lover of both Wonder Man and Henry Pym. She also encountered and fought the Werewolf. She was transported with the West Coast Avengers by Balkatar to the realm of the Cat People. Ultimately, she came into contact with the banished colony of Cat People, whose king agreed to resolve her crisis in exchange for carrying out her historical function by murdering the Cat People&#x27;s longtime foe, Master Pandemonium. Though she initially accepted their terms, when the critical moment came at an arena in the Cat People&#x27;s realm, Tigra refused to violate the Avengers&#x27; code against killing, and failed to kill Master Pandemonium. The Cat People stripped her of her &quot;Tigra soul&quot; (the peculiar articulation of her Tigra powers in this demonic realm). She was reduced to her normal, pre-transformation human state.

The Hellcat, who had accompanied Greer and the West Coast Avengers, lent Greer the super-suit that she used to wear as the Cat, and a battle ensued. As the tide began to turn against the Cat People, their leader released the &quot;Tigra soul&quot; as a means of confusing Greer. The tactic backfired: the cat-suit had been designed by a Cat Person (Tumolo) specifically to amplify Greer&#x27;s human capabilities, so instead of Greer being dominated by the &quot;Tigra soul&quot; as before, the suit caused her human and feline personalities to successfully integrate together.

This time, Greer&#x27;s transformation into the legendary cat-warrior was much more complete than before. Her strength and abilities were far greater than they were originally. Her appearance became more feline, and she grew a tail like the rest of the Cat People. She also lost the ability to shift back to a human form, though as before she showed no sense of loss for her human identity.

Her transformation was so complete and the Tigra legend was so strong among the Cat People that they immediately ceased hostilities. Tigra continues to hold a position of significant reverence among the Cat People.

The transformation also resolved the conflicts between the human and feline aspects of her personality. Tigra could now exploit the full range and ferocity of her abilities without fear of going so far that she would lose control of her actions, and she could also indulge her natural feline inclinations (such as hunting and chasing prey for enjoyment) without feeling guilty or self-conscious. This integration was confirmed in concrete ways immediately upon the team&#x27;s return to Earth. Tigra performed a sport dive off the highest span of the Golden Gate Bridge, exhibiting no signs of any injury or fear of the water. She also terminated her ongoing relationship with Hank Pym, explaining that although she no longer felt a cat-like need to seek affection at every opportunity, she had no conventional human desire to be tied down to one mate, either.

She was captured by Graviton at one point, but freed the Avengers from him. Around this time, the Arthurian Lady of the Lake summoned the West Coast Avengers to England to aid the superhero team Excalibur. With the others, Tigra ventured into the realm of limbo to help stop Doctor Doom&#x27;s mad plans to gain power at the cost of killing everyone in Britain.

Tigra briefly left the West Coast Avengers in a dispute over the Avengers&#x27; policy against killing. Tigra stated that she believed by her very nature that killing prey was sometimes necessary. She joined Mockingbird and the Moon Knight in forming an independent group.

After returning to the team, Tigra inexplicably underwent another &quot;inversion&quot; and transformed into a more animal-like feline form, losing her human intellect completely and becoming a danger to her fellow Avengers. This was possibly due to the reality-warping machinations of Immortus, who at the time sought to distract the team so as to have unimpeded access to the Scarlet Witch. Tigra was forcibly shrunken down to sub-house cat size by Hank Pym and kept in a cage in his lab while the team tended to other urgent matters. She escaped and traveled into suburbia, where she lived as a wild animal. She was ultimately rescued and restored to her former appearance and stability by noted witch Agatha Harkness, who was an associate of the West Coast Avengers at the time.

Tigra resumed her membership in the West Coast Avengers. On an intelligence-gathering mission in Japan, she and Iron Man battled a team of Asian supervillains known as the Pacific Overlords. During the fight, Iron Man was incapacitated and Tigra suffered a deep, critical stab wound to the abdomen before dispatching her attackers and making her escape. She flew away in the Avengers&#x27; Quinjet, intending to report back to headquarters on the Overlords&#x27; plans, but severe loss of blood caused her to lose consciousness and crash land in Arnhem Land, an Aboriginal territory in northern Australia. Rescued by Aborigines, she decided to stay put while she recovered from her wounds, naming Spider-Woman (Julia Carpenter) as her replacement. She briefly made Arnhem Land her home, enjoying the company of the Aborigines and the pleasures of living wild.

After the West Coast Avengers disbanded, Tigra resumed her wide-ranging adventures. Though no longer an active Avenger, she continued to participate in Avengers operations when needed as a member of the team&#x27;s extended family.

With the aid of a new transformation device to disguise her true identity from her fellow officers, Tigra spent some time on the New York City police force. She focused much of her time on a personal case and in combating a force of vigilante police officers.

Later, mystical forces which attacked all Avengers brought her to the Avengers Mansion. There, she and all the other Avengers were entrapped by Morgan le Fay, to live out in an alternate universe where le Fay ruled, fighting alongside the others as one of the &quot;queen&quot;&#x27;s guards under the name &quot;Grimalkin&quot;. After the defeat of Morgan, Tigra went off into space with Starfox to enjoy the pleasures found there. She appeared off and on, having a series of adventures as part of the ad hoc space-faring Avengers Infinity team in which she helps in preventing an extra-universal race from destroying all life in our universe.

Tigra returned to Earth with the Avengers Infinity team during the &quot;Maximum Security&quot; storyline, during which she helped to save the Earth from becoming a penal colony for alien criminals. She played a particularly crucial role in events when the Infinity team were captured after discovering the Kree&#x27;s role in recent events, with the Kree intending to lobotomize the team and make it appear as though they had destroyed another planet; due to the attention the Kree had paid to keeping the more powerful team members contained, they were unprepared for Tigra, the weakest member, to escape her bonds by returning to her smaller human form, allowing her to escape her shackles and free her teammates in time to reveal the truth.

===&quot;Civil War&quot;===
Tigra fought along Iron Man&#x27;s side during the Civil War. She supported the Superhuman Registration Act, although she expressed sincere concern about the fate of Captain America and the other heroes who opposed the Act and turned fugitive. Nonetheless, in &quot;Civil War Files&quot;, Tigra was listed not merely as having registered to comply with the law, but also as having become an agent of S.H.I.E.L.D. to actively aid in its enforcement.

Pretending to switch allegiances, she infiltrated Captain America&#x27;s Secret Avengers team as a mole. She passed information to Iron Man undetected until the very end of the conflict, when she was discovered and &quot;outed&quot; by Hulkling, Captain America&#x27;s own spy among the pro-registration forces. Captain America kept quiet, exploiting her presence to feed disinformation to Iron Man about his team&#x27;s plan to rescue imprisoned heroes later that day.

===The Initiative===
Greer has been identified as one of the 142 registered superheroes who are part of the Fifty State Initiative. She served as a founding instructor at Camp Hammond, the training compound for the Initiative, and resumed her romantic relationship with fellow superhero Yellowjacket, unaware that he had been kidnapped and replaced by a Skrull duplicate.

Tigra was captured by Chilean soldiers controlled by the Puppet Master, who sculpted a figure in her likeness and thus put her under his mental control. He used her and the other superhuman women he had enslaved (including Stature, Dusk, Araña, and Silverclaw) as elite guards at his South American base of operations. Tigra and the rest of the heroes were restored to their normal free will when Ms. Marvel and her S.H.I.E.L.D. strike team liberated the compound and killed the Puppet Master.

Later she was shot and severely beaten by the Hood in her home in retaliation for having beaten Jigsaw, a member of his fledgling super-criminal organization. While Tigra was incapacitated, the Hood threatened the life of her mother, and Jigsaw stole the mystic talisman she occasionally uses to transform to her human identity.

The Hood and his entire crew later appeared at her apartment, demanding to know the location of the New Avengers&#x27; secret headquarters. Tigra intentionally gave him information that led them into an ambush. She joined in the battle and personally beat down the Hood, saving the life of Iron Fist in the process. By the time of the Hood&#x27;s second appearance in her apartment, she had completely recovered from her injuries and had either reacquired her talisman or replaced it with a close facsimile.

Tigra continued to serve in the Initiative as a senior staff member of the central organization, and was the leader of the Arkansas Initiative team &quot;the Battalion&quot;, until the Initiative was taken over by Norman Osborn and she learned of the Hood&#x27;s role as his right-hand man. She has also appeared as a member of She-Hulk&#x27;s &quot;Lady Liberators&quot; team.

After the Skrull invasion, Tigra reveals to the Hellcat and Trauma that she believes herself to be pregnant by Yellowjacket, though she is unsure if the baby is the real Hank&#x27;s or the Skrull impostor&#x27;s. She tells Trauma that she has decided to terminate the pregnancy regardless of the father&#x27;s identity. She later decides to leave the camp for Arkansas, planning to train Razorback, who had been replaced by a Skrull and recently returned, and was eager to take the impostor&#x27;s place in the Battalion. When she was nearly injured by Ragnarok&#x27;s hammer, she seemed to show concern for the baby.

When Norman Osborn told her that he was going to take her baby for genetic testing and that moreover he had made the Hood the chief operating officer of the Initiative, Tigra went on the run with Gauntlet despite having been offered her choice of prestige assignments as a registered hero. She co-founded the Avengers Resistance, choosing its name as a means of restoring honor to the legendary team&#x27;s traditions. Now wanted as an outlaw, she began exacting personal vengeance on members of the Hood&#x27;s gang, starting by savagely attacking and beating one of the Brothers Grimm inside his home. She serves as the team&#x27;s de facto leader.

Tigra is later approached by Ultra Girl, asking why she and the Avengers Resistance are going after the villains in the Initiative. In response, she shows her a video of the Hood savagely beating her. Now, she wants to get back at them, by showing them that they are vulnerable...by making them scared and broken. Tigra later ambushes Mandrill.

She claimed her final retribution against the Hood not on the battlefield, but after he was rendered powerless and taken into custody. After telling him that she was perfectly comfortable with the idea of taking his life, the sight of his baby in the hallway outside convinced her that dooming him to either a life in prison or on the run would be a far worse punishment, as he would never get to hold his child ever again; and to kill him would jeopardize her future with her own baby. Tigra gave birth to what is apparently a normal Cat Person kitten during the transition between Tony Stark&#x27;s administration of the Initiative and Norman Osborn&#x27;s; the gestation period was a mere two months, due to her feline physiology. She hid the infant from Osborn, entrusting its care to the Cat People until the end of hostilities. She named the child William, after her late husband.

===Heroic Age===
At the conclusion of the Siege, Tigra stated a new motivation not only to restore the good name of the Avengers, but also to ensure that her child will grow up in a safer world.

Following the arrest and incarceration of Norman Osborn, the dismantling of his criminal superhero teams, and the repeal of the Superhuman Registration Act, the President names Steve Rogers (the original Captain America) as America&#x27;s new head of national security. Rogers seeks to assemble a collection of heroes to inspire the nation and the world as a new organization of Avengers. Tigra is among the 25 heroes he personally invites to join him in creating a new Heroic Age.

Alongside Hank Pym, Quicksilver, Jocasta, Speedball and Justice, Tigra serves as part of the founding faculty of Avengers Academy, training a new generation of heroes in the traditions of the world&#x27;s elite superhero team.

During this time, Tigra learns that the Skrull posing as Pym was indeed William&#x27;s father, but as he had disguised himself as Pym at the genetic level, it means that William is half-human, rather than half-Skrull, with Pym technically being the genetic father. After learning this, Tigra asks Pym to take care of William in the event of anything happening to her.

When a former associate of The Hood plans to release the video of Tigra&#x27;s beating commercially, Tigra arranges to have the footage air in its entirety during a live interview, so that her own experience may serve as an example to other trauma survivors and inspire them to seek help. During this same interview, she announces her formation of a series of &quot;Always an Avenger&quot; centers to provide veterans, children, spouses and any other trauma victims with needed counseling and resources.

Members of the existing Avengers Academy class react to the initial news of the video by tracking the unpowered Hood down, attacking him, and releasing video of the attack on the Internet, rather than taking the escaped Hood into custody and returning him to jail. Tigra becomes furious at their counter-heroic actions and by their refusal to appreciate the seriousness of their transgression; she summarily expels all those involved. Later, after talking with the rest of the faculty staff, they decide to put all those involved on probation instead.

She has slowly grown closer to Henry Pym and the two have resumed their romantic relationship.

Tigra was one of 10 female heroes recruited by Misty Knight to aid her and the Valkyrie in repelling a group of Asgardian Doom Maidens. At the end of this adventure, the Valkyrie comes to realize that Tigra and three of the other heroines are among those deemed by the All-Mother to be worthy to become shield-maidens like herself, symbols of honor and valor and courage, to one day be led by the Valkyrie into battle and death.

During the &quot;Secret Empire&quot; storyline, Tigra appears as a member of the Underground, a resistance movement against HYDRA.

Tigra appeared in the Fresh Start revival of the West Coast Avengers, in which she had been changed into a giant 200-Foot tall woman with her mind set in a feral state. After the new West Coast Avengers roster defeated her, they worked on stopping other feral giant women mutated into such by M.O.D.O.K. in his failed quest for love. Once returned to her original self, she thanked the WCA, went to hunt M.O.D.O.K. and wished the new WCA the best of luck. During the 17th birthday party for Nadia van Dyne-Pym, the long lost daughter of Hank Pym, Tigra introduced William to Nadia as her half-brother. With the introduction serving as her birthday gift, Tigra had tears of joy that Nadia happily accepted her new brother and would be a big part in William&#x27;s life.

==Powers and abilities==
Tigra&#x27;s powers are the result of a combination of science, magic, and mental energy utilized by Dr. Joanne Marie Tumulo and the other Cat People. Her physical appearance is distinctly cat-like. A thick, sleek coat of orange fur with black stripes covers her entire body. She has pointed ears, sharper-than-normal teeth with pronounced upper and lower canines, eyes with enlarged irises and vertically slitted pupils, and retractable claws on her feet and hands instead of nails. Her claws and teeth are sufficiently strong to puncture sheet steel, such as that found in a car body. Tigra also has a long semi-prehensile tail, and can willfully contact (but not grasp and lift) objects with it. Tigra&#x27;s feline physiology grants her various superhuman attributes including superhuman strength, speed, stamina, agility, reflexes, and resistance to physical injury. If she is injured, her physiology enables her to heal much faster and more extensively than an ordinary human.

Tigra&#x27;s senses of sight, smell, and hearing extend far into the superhuman range and are also superior to those of ordinary cats. Tigra can see farther, and with much greater clarity, than an ordinary human. She has this same level of clarity at night, and her vision also extends slightly into the infrared spectrum, allowing her to see in complete darkness.

Her hearing is similarly enhanced, allowing her to hear a wider range of frequencies than a normal human as well as clearly hear sounds that would be far too faint for a human to detect. Exposure to intense, high-frequency sound is far more painful for Tigra than a normal human.

Tigra&#x27;s sense of smell is developed to the point that she can recognize a person by scent alone, and track an individual across great distances and through complex environments. She can also sense changes in a person&#x27;s mood through changes in their scent.

Thick pads on her feet, combined with her natural grace, allow her to move in almost complete silence.

Tigra&#x27;s thick coat of fur prevents her from losing body heat quickly. She has stated that she wears bikinis partly because a full set of clothes over her fur would cause her to overheat in warm environments and possibly pass out. In addition, she is completely comfortable with her feline appearance and is not annoyed by the inevitable attention.

The unusual feline-human hybrid configuration of her brain makes her somewhat resistant to telepathic assaults. Though Tigra is not immune to such tactics, attackers have been forced to focus their powers carefully in order to use them effectively against her.

Like all cats, the interconnective tissues of Tigra&#x27;s skeleton are unusually resilient. On at least one occasion this allowed her to shift her bones to slip out of mechanical restraints that would have effectively held a normal human, though doing so was quite painful. This resiliency also contributes to many of her other super-powered abilities, such as her body&#x27;s resistance to injury.

Tigra possesses a mystical talisman that allows her to change her appearance from feline to human at will. She rarely uses it and only appears in her human form whenever circumstances require it. She regards her feline body as her natural form.

She formerly possessed what was referred to as a &quot;cat-soul&quot; in addition to her &quot;human soul&quot;. Though vaguely defined, her &quot;two souls&quot; were consistently depicted merely as a means to describe her conflicting human and feline instincts, and not as separate personalities or personas, and her &quot;cat soul&quot; was not the soul of any specific Cat Person from the past. Regardless of the definition of her &quot;two souls&quot;, they were fully merged during Greer&#x27;s second, more complete transformation into the legendary figure.

Greer received a form of empathic ability when she became the Cat. She retains this ability as Tigra. With careful concentration, she can sense the emotions of others within her immediate proximity. She appears to prefer to achieve this same effect through her enhanced feline senses.

Tigra is an experienced and formidable hand-to-hand combatant, with a unique fighting style that exploits her feline speed, agility, senses, and instincts. She is a superhumanly adept athlete and gymnast. Like all Avengers of her generation, she has sparred and trained extensively with Steve Rogers, the original Captain America.

She is also a capable leader and pilot, qualified to operate Avengers aircraft as well as interstellar spacecraft.

While working undercover in human guise, Tigra attended the New York Police Academy to investigate the decade-old murder of her husband Bill Nelson. After bringing the murderers to justice, she completed her training under her Greer Grant Nelson identity. While she does not serve as an active-duty police officer, she retains legal authority under both her civilian and superpowered identities and unofficial ties to the police community.

Tigra possesses mystical abilities that have largely gone unexplored. In addition to using her mystic talisman to change her appearance from feline to human and back, she has been shown magically summoning the Balkatar, the Cat People&#x27;s designated emissary to the Earthly plane. When Dr. Strange abdicated his position as Sorcerer Supreme, the Eye of Agamotto created a vision showing the many mystic beings who were potentially worthy or capable of assuming the title. An image of Tigra was included in this vision.

Tigra&#x27;s physiology is more feline than human. When she became pregnant via the Skrull pretending to be Hank Pym, she carried the baby to term in two months, producing a single Cat Person son named William after her late husband. William does not have any traces of Skrull DNA as the Skrull pretending to be Hank Pym imitated him down to a cellular level; thus, genetically, William is Hank Pym&#x27;s son. William matures more quickly than a human baby would.

<text>The Borough of Arfon was local government district with borough status from 1974 to 1996, being one of five districts in the county of Gwynedd, north-west Wales.

==Etymology==
 means &#x27;opposite Anglesey&#x27; ( + which is the soft mutation of , the Welsh name for Anglesey). The name is ancient and has been used to designate the area since early medieval times. In the Middle Ages Cantref Arfon was an administrative territorial entity of the Kingdom of Gwynedd. Arfon survived as a geocultural name () over the centuries and remains in use today. It is also sometimes found as a personal name (e.g. Arfon Griffiths).

==History==
The borough was created on 1 April 1974, under the Local Government Act 1972. It covered the whole area of four former districts and most of a fifth from the administrative county of Caernarfonshire, which were all abolished at the same time:
*Bangor Municipal Borough
*Bethesda Urban District
*Caernarfon Municipal Borough
*Gwyrfai Rural District, except the parishes of Beddgelert and Clynnog which went to Dwyfor
*Ogwen Rural District
The new borough was named Arfon.

Under the Local Government (Wales) Act 1994, the previous two tier system of counties and districts was replaced with new principal areas (each designated either a &quot;county&quot; or a &quot;county borough&quot;), whose councils perform the functions previously divided between the county and district councils. The Arfon area merged with Dwyfor and Meirionnydd to become a county which the government initially called &quot;Caernarfonshire and Merionethshire&quot;. During the transition to the new system, the shadow authority requested a change of name from &quot;Caernarfonshire and Meirionethshire&quot; to &quot;Gwynedd&quot;. The government confirmed the change with effect from 2 April 1996, one day after the new council came into being.

==Political control==
The first election to the council was held in 1973, initially operating as a shadow authority alongside the outgoing authorities until it came into its powers on 1 April 1974. The council consisted of 40 district councillors elected from 33 electoral wards. From 1987 this reduced to 39 councillors and 31 wards. Political control of the council from 1974 until its abolition in 1996 was as follows:
==Premises==

Arfon Borough Council was based at the Town Hall, Ffordd Gwynedd, Bangor. This was the former Bishop&#x27;s Palace of the Bishop of Bangor, dating back to around 1500. The building ceased to be used as the bishop&#x27;s residence in 1900, and was bought by the former Bangor City Council in 1903, who converted it to become their headquarters. The building was renamed &quot;Town Hall&quot; (despite Bangor being a city) in 1908. After Arfon Borough Council&#x27;s abolition in 1996 the Town Hall was used as an area office of Gwynedd Council before being converted to become the Storiel museum and art gallery, which opened in 2016.

<text>The Indoor Football League (IFL) began in 1999 as an offshoot of the troubled Professional Indoor Football League. Keary Ecklund, the owner of the Green Bay Bombers and Madison Mad Dogs, left the PIFL after its first, financially troubled, season to start his own league. Unlike the PIFL, the IFL was an &quot;entity league&quot;; teams were owned by the league and franchised out to management groups. NFL Hall-of-Famer Kellen Winslow was brought in as commissioner. The league was successful enough for a major expansion in 2000. Expansion was done regionally to cut down on travel expenses. Hence, the majority of the teams were in the Midwest. Their championship game was known as the Gold Cup.

Midway through the 2000 season, the Topeka Knights changed management and nicknames and became the Kings. After the season, the entire league was purchased by the Arena Football League&#x27;s Orlando Predators. Two teams, the Lincoln Lightning and Peoria Pirates, as well as many players, became a part of their developmental (&quot;farm&quot;) league, the AF2. The Wichita Warlords were rebranded the Wichita Stealth. Other teams resurfaced with new names in the Indoor Professional Football League (which consisted of the remnants of the PIFL that Ecklund left in 1999) and the National Indoor Football League.

<text>Homologation (Greek &quot;homologeo&quot;, ὁμολογέω, &quot;to agree&quot;) is the granting of approval by an official authority. This may be a court of law, a government department, or an academic or professional body, any of which would normally work from a set of rules or standards to determine whether such approval should be given. The word may be considered very roughly synonymous with &quot;&quot;, and in fact in French and Spanish may be used with regard to academic degrees (see apostille). &quot;Certification&quot; is another possible synonym, while &quot;to homologate&quot; is the infinitive verb form.

In today&#x27;s marketplace, for instance, products must often be homologated by some public agency to assure that they meet standards for such things as safety and environmental impact. A court action may also sometimes be homologated by a judicial authority before it can proceed, and the term has a precise legal meaning in the judicial codes of some countries.

The equivalent process of testing and certification for conformance to technical standards is usually known as type approval in English-language jurisdictions.

==Sport==
===Motorsports===

In motorsports a vehicle must be type approved by the sanctioning body to race in a given league, such as World Superbike, International Level Kart Racing, or other sportscar racing/touring car racing series.

Where a racing class requires that the vehicles raced be production vehicles only slightly adapted for racing, manufacturers typically produce a limited run of such vehicles for public sale so that they can legitimately race them in the class. These vehicles are commonly called &quot;homologation specials&quot;.

===Olympics===
The term is also applicable in the Olympic Games, in venue certifications, prior to the start of competition. An issue was raised at Cesana Pariol—the bobsleigh, luge, and skeleton track used for the 2006 Winter Olympics in Turin—over its safety in luge. This delayed homologation of the track from January 2005 to October 2005 in order to achieve safe runs during luge competitions.

===Other sports===
In towed water sports, tournaments must adhere to homologation requirements set by the International Waterski &amp; Wakeboard Federation in order to qualify as ranking. In speed climbing, in order for world, continental or national records to be recognised by the International Federation of Sport Climbing, an official homologated wall must be used, and each event must be approved through a homologation visit.

<text>Edwin O. Guthman (August 11, 1919 – August 31, 2008) was an American journalist and university professor. While at the &quot;Seattle Times&quot;, he won the paper&#x27;s first Pulitzer Prize for National Reporting in 1950. Guthman was third on Richard Nixon&#x27;s &quot;Enemies List.&quot;

==Biography==
Guthman was born in Seattle, Washington, graduating from the University of Washington in 1941. He entered the Army in 1942. During World War II, he served as an infantry regiment reconnaissance platoon leader in both North Africa and Italy. In 1946, he was discharged as a captain. During his tour, he was awarded the Silver Star and Purple Heart.

He was a reporter for the &quot;Seattle Star&quot; (1941–1947), and &quot;The Seattle Times&quot; (1947–1961). While at the &quot;Seattle Times&quot;, he won the paper&#x27;s first Pulitzer Prize for National Reporting in 1950. His articles provided evidence that the Washington State Un-American Activities Committee suppressed evidence that cleared University of Washington professor Melvin Rader of false charges of being a Communist.

In 1961, he was tapped by Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy to be his press secretary. He later served in a similar position for one year when Kennedy became U.S. Senator from New York in 1965. As a result of his work with Kennedy, he was third on Nixon&#x27;s Enemies List.

He was the national editor for the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; from 1965 to 1977 and then the editorial page editor for &quot;The Philadelphia Inquirer&quot; (1977–1987).

He was a senior lecturer at the USC Annenberg School for Communication at the University of Southern California in Los Angeles, California, where he had been a professor since 1987. He retired in 2007.

==Personal life==
Guthman died August 31, 2008, at his home in the Pacific Palisades neighborhood of Los Angeles, at the age of 89. He suffered from amyloidosis, a rare disease that attacks the internal organs. He was of Jewish descent and was interred at Hillside Memorial Park. He was survived by his four children: Les Guthman, Edwin H. Guthman, Gary Guthman, and Diane Guthman.

<text>Column generation or delayed column generation is an efficient algorithm for solving large linear programs.

The overarching idea is that many linear programs are too large to consider all the variables explicitly. The idea is thus to start by solving the considered program with only a subset of its variables. Then iteratively, variables that have the potential to improve the objective function are added to the program. Once it is possible to demonstrate that adding new variables would no longer improve the value of the objective function, the procedure stops. The hope when applying a column generation algorithm is that only a very small fraction of the variables will be generated. This hope is supported by the fact that in the optimal solution, most variables will be non-basic and assume a value of zero, so the optimal solution can be found without them.

In many cases, this method allows to solve large linear programs that would otherwise be intractable. The classical example of a problem where it is successfully used is the cutting stock problem. One particular technique in linear programming which uses this kind of approach is the Dantzig–Wolfe decomposition algorithm. Additionally, column generation has been applied to many problems such as crew scheduling, vehicle routing, and the capacitated p-median problem.

== Algorithm ==
The algorithm considers two problems: the master problem and the subproblem. The master problem is the original problem with only a subset of variables being considered. The subproblem is a new problem created to identify an improving variable (&quot;i.e.&quot; which can improve the objective function of the master problem). 

The algorithm then proceeds as follow:

# Initialise the master problem and the subproblem
# Solve the master problem
# Search for an improving variable with the subproblem
# If an improving variable is found: add it to the master problem then go to step 2
# Else: The solution of the master problem is optimal. Stop.

== Finding an improving variable == 

The most difficult part of this procedure is how to find a variable that can improve the objective function of the master problem. This can be done by finding the variable with the most negative reduced cost (assuming without loss of generality that the problem is a minimization problem). If no variable has a negative reduced cost, then the current solution of the master problem is optimal.

When the number of variables is very large, it is not possible to find an improving variable by calculating all the reduced cost and choosing a variable with a negative reduced cost. Thus, the idea is to compute only the variable having the minimum reduced cost. This can be done using an optimization problem called the pricing subproblem which strongly depends on the structure of the original problem. The objective function of the subproblem is the reduced cost of the searched variable with respect to the current dual variables, and the constraints require that the variable obeys the naturally occurring constraints. The column generation method is particularly efficient when this structure makes it possible to solve the sub-problem with an efficient algorithm, typically a dedicated combinatorial algorithm.

We now detail how and why to compute the reduced cost of the variables. Consider the following linear program in standard form:
:formula_1
which we will call the primal problem as well as its dual linear program:
:formula_2

Moreover, let formula_3 and formula_4 be optimal solutions for these two problems which can be provided by any linear solver. These solutions verify the constraints of their linear program and, by duality, have the same value of objective function (formula_5) which we will call formula_6. This optimal value is a function of the different coefficients of the primal problem: formula_7. Note that there exists a dual variable formula_8 for each constraint of the primal linear model. It is possible to show that an optimal dual variable formula_8 can be interpreted as the partial derivative of the optimal value formula_6 of the objective function with respect to the coefficient formula_11 of the right-hand side of the constraints:formula_12 or otherwise formula_13. More simply put, formula_8 indicates by how much increases locally the optimal value of the objective function when the coefficient formula_11 increases by one unit.

Consider now that a variable formula_16 was not considered until then in the primal problem. Note that this is equivalent to saying that the variable formula_16 was present in the model but took a zero value. We will now observe the impact on the primal problem of changing the value of formula_16 from formula_19 to formula_20. If formula_21 and formula_22 are respectively the coefficients associated with the variable formula_16 in the objective function and in the constraints then the linear program is modified as follows:

:formula_24

In order to know if it is interesting to add the variable formula_16 to the problem (&quot;i.e&quot; to let it take a non-zero value), we want to know if the value formula_26 of the objective function of this new problem decreases as the value formula_20 of the variable formula_16 increases. In other words, we want to know formula_29. To do this, note that formula_26 can be expressed according to the value of the objective function of the initial primal problem: formula_31. We can then compute the derivative that interests us:

:formula_32

In other words, the impact of changing the value formula_20 on the value formula_34 translates into two terms. First, this change directly impacts the objective function and second, the right-hand side of the constraints is modified which has an impact on the optimal variables formula_3 whose magnitude is measured using the dual variables formula_4. The derivative formula_29 is generally called the reduced cost of the variable formula_16 and will be denoted by formula_39 in the following.

He was ordained to the priesthood by Bishop Adrianus Godschalk on June 15, 1889, and then traveled to the United States at the request of Archbishop Francis Janssens, who assigned Drossaerts to pastoral work in Lake Charles, Louisiana. He initiated the religious education of African-American Catholics, and also served as a pastor in New Orleans, Broussard, and Baton Rouge.

On July 18, 1918, Drossaerts was appointed the fifth Bishop of San Antonio, Texas, by Pope Benedict XV. He received his episcopal consecration on the following December 18 from Archbishop Giovanni Bonzano, with Bishops Theophile Meerschaert and John Marius Laval serving as co-consecrators, in St. Louis Cathedral. Drossaerts was later made an Archbishop upon San Antonio&#x27;s elevation to the rank of an archdiocese on August 3, 1926.

Throughout his tenure in San Antonio, he provided refuge to numerous clergymen who fled from persecution during the Mexican Revolution, raising over $21,000 for this cause in 1926–1929. 

At the funeral Mass for the late Bishop of Aguascalientes, Drossaerts condemned the perceived lack of American interest in the Church&#x27;s persecution in Mexico, saying, &quot;Liberty is being crucified at our very door, and the United States looks on with perfect indifference. Despotism seems to have become popular amongst us. Are we not sending endless goodwill parties to Mexico? Are we not courting the friendship and favor of the very men whose hands are simply dripping with the blood of their innocent victims? ... The ominous silence of the American press and pulpit is not understandable.&quot; 

Pope Pius XI made him an Assistant at the Pontifical Throne for these efforts on August 19, 1934.

Drossaerts also denounced the women&#x27;s fashions of his time, which he described as &quot;formerly the exclusive badge of the scarlet woman&quot;, lamenting the &quot;degrading spectacle of young women being exhibited and appraised like dogs and cattle.&quot;

==Death==
Archbishop Drossaerts died at Santa Rosa Hospital, three days before his 78th birthday. He was buried at San Fernando Archdiocesan Cemetery in San Antonio.

<text>Jason Elliott Stollsteimer (born April 22, 1978) is an American musician, best known as the vocalist and lead guitarist for the indie rock band The Von Bondies, which took a break in 2011. Stollsteimer was also the main songwriter and a producer of the band. He released three studio albums with The Von Bondies, one studio album with The Hounds Below, and is currently playing with PONYSHOW.

==Career==

===The Von Bondies===
The Von Bondies debut album, &quot;Lack of Communication&quot;, was released in 2001 on Sympathy for the Record Industry. Jason toured the states with the first incarnation of The Von Bondies featuring longtime friend Carrie Smith on the bass, Don Blum on drums, and Marcie Bolen (Silverghost, Slumber Party) on rhythm guitar. Over ten U.S. tours were done in order to help promote the record. The group shared the stage with The Cramps, on their 8th US tour. The Von Bondies also played several shows in the U.K. and Europe and a live performance on Later... with Jools Holland in London.

In 2003, The Von Bondies released the live album &quot;Raw and Rare&quot;. The album consists mostly of live BBC recordings from the John Peel sessions. On December 13, 2003, Stollsteimer and Jack White of The White Stripes had a confrontation at the Majestic Theatre Center, in a Detroit nightclub called The Magic Stick. This was the second time the two had been in a physical altercation over the unresolved issues surrounding the production credit that Jim Diamond believed he deserved on the 2001 Von Bondies album, &quot;Lack of Communication&quot;. Diamond and the rest of the Von Bondies both agreed that Diamond did most of the production work, but White denied their claims and placed his own name on the credits of the album as the sole producer, which led to the brawl. Additionally, Diamond was also suing The White Stripes at the time claiming he produced their two earliest albums, which may have added fuel to the conflict. The first attack was one year earlier, also in Detroit. White&#x27;s and Stollsteimer&#x27;s statements on the police report of the incident contradict each other as to who started the scuffle. In March 2004, White pleaded guilty to assault and battery, was made to pay $750 (including court costs) and to attend anger management classes.

In 2004, The Von Bondies released their second studio album, &quot;Pawn Shoppe Heart&quot;, and toured extensively in the US, UK, and Europe. &quot;C&#x27;mon C&#x27;mon&quot; was the first single and reached the UK Top 25 for the first time (peaking at #21), and also generated some huge buzz for the band. The other single that was released from the album, &quot;Tell Me What You See&quot;, reached number 43 on the UK charts. Almost every track from the album has appeared in numerous commercials, movies, and TV shows. One song in particular, &quot;C&#x27;mon C&#x27;mon&quot;, was used more than all the others combined including use in local radio commercials/adverts and as the main theme song of the hit F/X television show &quot;Rescue Me&quot;.
While touring this record, The Von Bondies played the Reading and Leeds Festivals, Glastonbury Festival and Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival

The Von Bondies&#x27; third album, &quot;Love, Hate and Then There&#x27;s You&quot;, has gone through a long process of discovery and change before coming to its current polished form. In early 2006, a handful of demos were posted on The Von Bondies Myspace page. Later, the band posted more songs on their MySpace page including &quot;Shut Your Mouth&quot;, &quot;Pale Bride&quot;, and &quot;Only to Haunt You.&quot; Don Blum played drums on these recordings with all other instruments played by Stollsteimer. &quot;Love, Hate and Then There&#x27;s You&quot; was the first time Stollsteimer shared songwriting duties with anyone. The songs &quot;This Is Our Perfect Crime&quot; and &quot;Accidents Will Happen&quot; were co-written with Butch Walker, who also produced some songs on the album. The songs &quot;Blame Game&quot; and &quot;Earthquake&quot; were co-written with longtime drummer Don Blum. The album was released in 2009 on Majordomo Records.

===The Hounds Below===
Stollsteimer later became the frontman for The Hounds Below, which he established in 2009 and had focused on full-time following the breakup of the Von Bondies. The Hounds Below released their debut album, &quot;You Light Me Up In the Dark&quot;, in 2012.

===PONYSHOW===
Stollsteimer also became the frontman for PONYSHOW, which he established in 2014 with two of his former Von Bondies bandmates, Don Blum and Leann Banks. They released the songs &quot;Folks&quot; and &quot;Yeah, My Ears&quot; in 2014.

==Personal life==
Stollsteimer was born in Southfield, Michigan. His mother was a nurse, and his father an architect. He grew up in the Detroit suburbs of Plymouth, Michigan with his one brother, Eric. As a child, he went to school at Plymouth-Canton Educational Park. He later lived in Ann Arbor/Ypsilanti, where in 1997 he became friends with his new schoolmate at college, Marcie Bolen, who would become The Von Bondies first rhythm guitarist. A year later, while studying at Washtenaw Community College, Stollsteimer met Don Blum who would eventually become the drummer of The Von Bondies.

Jason currently resides in Metro Detroit. In addition to being a musician, he also works as a real estate agent.

<doc id="744602" wikidata="Q7893703" url="?curid=744602" title="Unitrans">
<text>Unitrans is the transit system which operates in and around the campus of the University of California, Davis. It takes its name from an abbreviation of the words &quot;University Transport&quot;. Excepting several managerial and maintenance positions, Unitrans is managed and operated entirely by students of the University of California, Davis who usually work part-time while attending school. The system is well known throughout the area for its use of several distinctive ex-Transport for London double-decker buses, as well as its fleet of modern natural gas single-decks. The system has 18 weekday, 1 school-centered and 6 weekend routes. Current fares are $1.50 for the general public and included in student fees for undergraduate University attendees. Unitrans is one of a small number of transit systems in the United States to operate double deck buses in regular (non-sightseeing) service (the others include The Deuce in Las Vegas, Nevada, Antelope Valley Transit Authority in Lancaster/Palmdale, California, Foothill Transit in San Gabriel Valley, California, SLO Transit in San Luis Obispo, AC Transit in Alameda County, California, AppalCART in Boone, North Carolina, and Community Transit in Snohomish County, Washington). Unitrans has one of the best safety records of any public transit system in the US.

In , the system had a ridership of , or about per weekday as of .

== History ==
In the late 1960s, members of the Associated Students of the University of California, Davis (ASUCD) realized the need for a transit system to transport students between the City of Davis and the university campus. In the spring of 1966, providing a transportation system became an ASUCD presidential promise. Newly elected in the fall, the President helped start experimental service in October 1966. This service was initially run using a private charter service. The estimated cost at the time was $2000/quarter. The service ran for several months, but ASUCD officials decided that the service needed to be changed. These students approached Davis&#x27; then-mayor Maynard Skinner and appealed for support both politically and financially. With the mayor&#x27;s endorsement, the University Transport System, or Unitrans, began to take shape.
To be unique, get the system noticed, and encourage ridership, Unitrans made arrangements to purchase two former London Transport double-decker buses in the middle part of 1967 and use them on &quot;East&quot; and &quot;West&quot; perimeter routes in Davis. According to the March 5, 1968 edition of The California Aggie newspaper, the two RTL type double-decker buses cost $3500 each, and were shipped to San Francisco for an additional $1000. After being modified with features like clearance lights and larger left side mirrors, service began in February 1968. Upon its retirement in 2007, RTL1014 was the oldest functioning example of its type in the world still operating in revenue service on a regular basis. These first two lines operated from what is now a parking lot behind Young Hall, until 1970 when expanded service forced the terminal to move to its current location near Hickey Gym. Starting in the late 1960s, Unitrans also began supplementing its fleet with second-hand single-deck buses, starting with several General Motors &quot;old-look&quot; buses ranging in length from 35 to 37¾ feet.

In 1972 the service dropped its remaining full-time drivers, and started operating with a full staff of part-time student drivers. Since then Unitrans has remained a student operated organization, employing students as drivers, conductors, supervisors, driver trainers, maintenance shop assistants, bus washers and office clerks. Career positions, the only non-student positions at Unitrans, currently include General and Assistant General Manager, Maintenance Shop Manager, Maintenance Shop Mechanics, and the Safety and Training Supervisor.

Through the 1970s Unitrans added eight former London Transport RT type double-deck buses, and in the early 1980s Unitrans added two Daimler Fleetline double-deck buses that had previously operated in Yorkshire, a county in northern England. The late 1970s and early 1980s saw the addition of a 40-foot and a number of 35-foot General Motors New Look buses. In 1982 Unitrans purchases its first all new, never before used, buses when it purchased five 35-foot Gillig Phantoms from the manufacturer in Hayward, California. Two RT type double-decker buses were retired in the early 1980s, and by this time the fleet of single-deck buses outnumbered the double-deckers.

With an increasing demand for service fueled by the expanding size of the university and the City of Davis, Unitrans continued to gear up for larger passenger loads by adding more buses and more routes through the City of Davis. The mid-1980s saw the purchase of yet more previously owned single-deck buses: two more 35-foot GM &quot;old-look&quot; buses from the Sacramento Regional Transit District (affectionately nicknamed &quot;Prison Buses&quot;), another 40-foot GM New Look bus, and several more 35-foot GM New Look buses (at least one of which was also from Sacramento). In the late 1980s, the Unitrans fleet expanded again with the purchase of four 40-foot and five 35-foot Flxible New Look buses from the Sacramento Regional Transit District, and eight 35-foot GM New Look buses from the San Diego Metropolitan Transit System. Three new 30-foot Gillig Phantoms were provided by UCD&#x27;s Transportation and Parking Services (TAPS) for the intracampus and UCD Medical Center shuttle to be operated by Unitrans drivers (this service is now run by the Medical Center).
Greater ridership in the 1980s prompted the writing and passing of a student referendum that added a $13 fee to registration costs to create the fare-less system. Students who paid their registration fees could ride the bus by simply showing their registration card with a valid registration sticker, or board for a cash fare of $0.50. This referendum made Unitrans an even more convenient method of transportation for students attending UC Davis.

The 1990s saw Unitrans operating 13 routes, with yearly ridership expected to top 2 million in fiscal year 1997–98. The addition of 15 brand new natural gas powered Orion Mark V buses from Oriskany, New York allowed Unitrans to modernize and clean up by retiring the Flxible fleet and portions of the GM fleet. Around the same time two 40-foot Gillig Phantoms purchased from Yolobus were reborn as Unitrans buses (and yet two more were purchased for Yolobus in 2001 and 2005).

In the late 1990s, the remainder of the GM fleet was retired, as were the two Daimlers and RTL1194, one of the first two double-deck buses purchased by Unitrans (although it hadn&#x27;t operated in some time). One of the RT&#x27;s that was also no longer in service by this time was ultimately sold in 2002.

In 2000 the Unitrans maintenance shop completed its retrofit of RT2819 to use a brand-new John Deere natural-gas powered engine. This bus is believed to be the only one of its type in the world to be powered by such an engine.

In 2001, Unitrans purchased 12 new natural gas powered Blue Bird Xcel 102 buses. Working with the University of California, Davis&#x27; Institute of Transportation Studies, one of the Blue Birds was slated to operate on a Hydrogen/CNG fuel blend, and was retired from service to begin work on the conversion. This bus was eventually introduced on April 20, 2004, when California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger made a visit to the campus as part of a push for the Hydrogen highway project.

2003 saw the addition of five new Mark VII 40-foot buses from Orion. These buses were purchased in coordination with Sacramento Regional Transit, and featured a low floor design, intended to make loading wheelchairs easier on the driver and the passengers.
In 2006–2007, Unitrans added eight new Orion Mark V 40-foot buses (4171-4178) to its fleet, returning to the high-floor design. This decision was made due to lower prices, fleet standardization, and availability of buses.

On May 12, 2008, construction began on the new Unitrans Silo Terminal. The terminal was completed in late September 2008. A dedication ceremony took place on October 30, 2008, and was attended by several local dignitaries. October 30, 2008 also marked the 50 millionth rider of the transit system.

Unitrans received six new low-floor buses from New Flyer at the beginning of Summer 2009, and received 12 more in 2010. These new buses will replace most of the aging Orion V buses, due to the upcoming end of their fuel cylinder lifespans. Unitrans received delivery of two Alexander Dennis Enviro500 40&#x27; double-deck buses in March 2010.

In 2019, Unitrans started the transition to battery electric buses. Six New Flyer Xcelsior CHARGE buses were purchased, supported by Federal Transit Administration grants. Unitrans plans to fully transition away from CNG buses to battery electric buses by 2023. The first six New Flyer Xcelsior CHARGE buses will go into service in Fall 2022.

== Future ==

Unitrans has moved towards an almost-entirely alternative fuel fleet. With the exception of the vintage double-deck buses and two rarely used support vans, the fleet is powered entirely by compressed natural gas. All diesel single-deck buses have been retired from service and have been sold. The Unitrans fleet is currently powered by nearly 95% alternative fuel.

Unitrans received delivery in March 2010 of two Alexander Dennis Enviro500 buses, in an attempt to accommodate the high passenger loads while reducing the demand on drivers. These buses are powered by clean diesel engines, which produce the same levels of emissions as the compressed natural gas, which powers the modern fleet. These two buses are not intended to replace the antique double-deck buses, but to complement them and accommodate the high passenger loads that Unitrans experiences on a daily basis.

Unitrans has added six New Flyer C40LFR low-floor buses to the fleet, and had 12 more delivered in 2010. The aging 1996 Orion V 35&#x27; fleet was retired, as well as four of the remaining 40&#x27; Orion V buses.

Unitrans purchased three New Flyer Xcelsior low-floor buses in 2014, and they were put into service in July 2014.

<doc id="744603" wikidata="Q16848405" url="?curid=744603" title="Indoor Professional Football League">
<text>The Indoor Professional Football League (IPFL) was the new incarnation of the Professional Indoor Football League (PIFL), which started in 1998. Two of its teams (the Madison Mad Dogs and the Green Bay Bombers) left the league and their owner, Kerry Ecklund, founded the Indoor Football League in 1999. The IPFL led a troubled three-year existence, and died after its 2001 season, with its most successful teams joining up with the National Indoor Football League.

The IPFL was unique among indoor football leagues in that it sanctioned the use of a white football, manufactured by Rawlings, which was easier to see in the artificial lighting conditions. The league&#x27;s slogan was &quot;Great Football, No Gimmicks&quot;.

In 1999, IPFL was headed by a new commissioner, Mike Storen, and the league offices were moved to Atlanta.

==IPFL 1999 teams==
Before the Pro Indoor Football League folded, the league was looking into replacing the two folded franchises of Minnesota and Texas and expanding the league back to 8 teams, or even beyond, to 10 or 12, for what was supposed to be its second season. However, the league took a major hit when Madison and Green Bay left the league to form a new league called the Indoor Football League. This left the league with only four teams: Honolulu, Utah, Colorado and Louisiana. The Utah Catzz soon folded as well, leading to the demise of the Pro Indoor Football League. The Pro Indoor Football League was re-formed as the Indoor Professional Football League and the three remaining clubs from the old league; the Hawaii Hammerheads (formerly Honolulu Hurricanes), the Rocky Mountain (Colorado Springs) Thunder (formerly Colorado (Denver) Wildcats) and the Louisiana Bayou Beast were joined by three new franchises in Boise, Idaho; Biloxi, Mississippi; and Austin, Texas. The league was going to have 8 clubs, but the Arizona (Tucson) Mirage and the Syracuse Blitz folded.

# Texas Terminators, 12-4
# Hawaii Hammerheads, 10-6
# Mississippi Fire Dogs, 9-7
# Idaho Stallions, 6-10
# Louisiana Bayou Beast, 6-10
# Rocky Mountain Thunder, 5-11

== IPFL 2000 teams==
During the off season, the Indoor Professional Football League saw major changes with the loss of three of its charter franchises: Rocky Mountain, Hawaii and Texas. However, the league saw the addition of four new franchises with the fourth new addition expanding the league beyond six franchises. The new clubs were Shreveport-Bossier City, Portland (OR), Omaha and Mobile. The Indoor Professional Football League approved the relocation of the Baton Rouge-based Louisiana Bayou Beast to Alexandria, Louisiana and announced the team would be known as the Louisiana Rangers. The Bayou Beast&#x27;s relocation to Alexandria left the league with no club still remaining in its city that it started operations in. Mississippi defeated Portland in the championship.

# Portland Prowlers, 11-5
# Mississippi Fire Dogs, 11-5
# Omaha Beef, 8-8
# Mobile Seagulls, 8-8
# Louisiana Rangers, 9-7
# Idaho Stallions, 5-11
# Shreveport-Bossier Bombers, 5-11

The Fort Wayne Safari was announced as an expansion team for the 2002 season, which never occurred.

<doc id="744604" wikidata="Q7082284" url="?curid=744604" title="Oklahoma Panhandle State University">
<text>Oklahoma Panhandle State University (OPSU, informally Panhandle State or simply Panhandle) is a public college in Goodwell, Oklahoma. OPSU is a baccalaureate degree-granting institution. General governance of the institution is provided by the Board of Regents of the Oklahoma Agricultural and Mechanical Colleges. Academic programs and financial support are authorized and coordinated through the Oklahoma State Regents for Higher Education.

==History==
In 1908, the Oklahoma Legislature passed legislation stating that, &quot;...each of the Supreme Court judicial districts [shall have] a district agricultural school of secondary grade for instruction in agriculture and mechanics and allied branches, and domestic science, and economics, with courses of instruction leading to the Agricultural and Mechanical College, and the state normal schools&quot;.

Oklahoma Panhandle State University was created in response to this act and opened in 1909 as Pan-Handle Agricultural Institute, (PAI) offering secondary agricultural education for the Panhandle area. PAI began offering courses to prepare public school teachers in 1915. In 1921, the legislature authorized the school to offer a two-year college curriculum, and the name was changed to Panhandle Agricultural and Mechanical College (PAMC). The college began offering four-year degree programs in 1925. In 1967, the school was designated as Oklahoma Panhandle State College of Agriculture and Applied Science. In 1974, the university assumed its present name.

Franklin Hall, the school&#x27;s oldest building, is listed on the U.S. National Register of Historic Places.

==Academics==
The university is organized into 3 colleges that offer associate degrees and bachelor&#x27;s degrees in such areas as history, education, business, and nursing. OPSU&#x27;s agriculture-related degree programs produce valued and competent graduates who are qualified to work in the region&#x27;s many bovine, equine, swine, and farming-related industries.

OPSU is regionally accredited by the Commission on Institutions of Higher Education of the North Central Association of Colleges and Schools to grant associate and bachelor&#x27;s degrees. It is also approved by the Oklahoma State Board of Education for the preparation of elementary and secondary teachers, The National Council for Accreditation of Teacher Education (NCATE), and by the Accreditation Commission for Education in Nursing Inc.(ACEN).
The constituent colleges are:

*College of Agriculture, Science, and Nursing
*College of Business and Technology
*College of Arts and Education

Nationally competitive teams in: Computer Programming (OPSU AITP), Business (OPSU PBL), Crops Judging, and Livestock Judging.

==Athletics==


The Oklahoma Panhandle State (OPSU) athletic teams are called the Aggies. The university is a member of the National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics (NAIA), primarily competing in the Sooner Athletic Conference (SAC) for most of its sports since the 2017–18 academic year. The Aggies previously competed in the Heartland Conference of the NCAA Division II ranks from 2002–03 to 2016–17.

OPSU competes in 18 intercollegiate varsity sports. Men&#x27;s sports include baseball, basketball, cross country, football, golf, soccer and track &amp; field; while women&#x27;s sports include basketball, cheerleading, cross country, golf, soccer, softball, track &amp; field and volleyball; and co-ed sports include equestrian, rodeo and shooting sports.

===Football===
The football team plays at Carl Wooten Field and at one point competed in the Central States Football League (CSFL) until after the 2017 fall season. Previously, the Aggies competed in the NCAA Division II Lone Star Conference during the 2016 fall season. In the early nineties, OPSU Aggies football was known as a football powerhouse in the NAIA. The program has recently had some success thanks to the late Mike Wyatt (2007–2010). The 2010 team produced the Aggie football program&#x27;s first winning season since 2004, going 6–5. The current coach, Russell Gaskamp, has set new records in player involvement in community service activities.

===Rodeo===
A point of pride for OPSU is its men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s rodeo teams. The school is a member of the Central Plains Region of the National Intercollegiate Rodeo Association (NIRA) and has won several regional and national team championships as well as numerous individual championships in the sport. The OPSU men&#x27;s rodeo team won national titles in 1997, 1998, 2000, 2004. 2013, 2017, and 2018. As part of their scholarship package, rodeo team members may receive lodging in special housing and stalls for their animals.

<text>William Henry Drummond (April 13, 1854 – April 6, 1907) was an Irish-born Canadian poet whose humorous dialect poems made him &quot;one of the most popular authors in the English-speaking world,&quot; and &quot;one of the most widely-read and loved poets&quot; in Canada.

&quot;His first book of poetry, &quot;The Habitant&quot; (1897), was extremely successful, establishing for him a reputation as a writer of dialect verse that has faded since his death.&quot;

==Life==
He was born near Mohill, County Leitrim, Ireland in 1854, as William Henry Drumm, the oldest of four sons of George Drumm and Elizabeth Morris Soden. Shortly after his birth Drummond family moved to Tawley, where he attended school. The family emigrated to Canada in 1864, settling in Montreal, Quebec.

George Drumm died in 1866, leaving the family facing poverty. Mrs. Drumm opened a store, and the boys all delivered newspapers. When he was 14, William was apprenticed as a telegraph operator. He trained and worked at L&#x27;Abord-à-Plouffe, now in Laval, on the Lake of Two Mountains, &quot;a Quebec lumber town where he had his first encounters with the habitants and voyageurs who were to inspire (and even to preoccupy) the poet.&quot; In 1875 (when he was 21, legally the head of the household), he changed the family name to Drummond.

In 1876, Drummond went back to the High School of Montreal. He then studied medicine (unsuccessfully) at McGill College and (successfully) at Bishop&#x27;s College. After interning in 1885, he practised medicine first in the Eastern Townships, Knowlton and then in Montreal starting in 1888. He became professor of hygiene at Bishop&#x27;s in 1893, and of medical jurisprudence in 1894.

In 1894, Drummond married Miss May Harvey, of Savanna-la-Mar, Jamaica. Their first child was born in 1895 but died just hours after birth. Their second child, a son named Charles Barclay, was born in July 1897. Soon after Charles&#x27;s birth, Drummond&#x27;s &quot;The habitant and other French-Canadian poems&quot; was published, which helped Drummond become one of the most popular authors in the English-speaking world.

===&quot;The Habitant and Other Poems&quot;===

According to his wife&#x27;s unpublished biography, Drummond wrote &quot;The Wreck of the &quot;Julie Plante&quot;&quot; in 1879. He had begun it years earlier as a telegraph operator at L&#x27;Abord-à-Plouffe. An elderly friend, Gédéon Plouffe, had entreated him to stay off the lake because of an approaching storm, repeating, &quot;An&#x27; de win&#x27; she blow, blow, blow!&quot; Those words &quot;rang so persistently in [Drummond&#x27;s] ears that, at the dead of night, unable to stand any longer the haunting refrain, he sprang from his bed and penned&quot; the lines that were &quot;to be the herald of his future fame.&quot; He supposedly used Lac St. Pierre because he couldn&#x27;t find &quot;anything to rhyme with &#x27;Lake of Two Mountains.&#x27;&quot;

&quot;The Wreck of the &quot;Julie Plante&quot;&quot; is a saga of a lumber scow that &quot;break up on Lac St. Pierre.&quot; It has the same stanza form as Henry Wadsworth Longfellow&#x27;s 1842 poem, &quot;The Wreck of the Hesperus,&quot; and in places reads like a parody of the latter: for example, just as the captain of the &quot;Hesperus&quot; tied his daughter to the mast, the captain of the &quot;Julie Plante&quot; tied Rosie the cook.

The poem &quot;Right Minds&quot; was among his most popular works, featuring one of Drummond&#x27;s most quoted lines: &quot;Right minds feel not love but reason. And what reasonable man truly loves.&quot;

The poem &quot;was an instant success... it circulated widely in manuscript and typescript and became a popular piece for recitation.&quot; A version appeared in the Winnipeg &quot;Siftings&quot; in September 1886; another (with word variations and music of unknown origin) was in the 1896 &quot;McGill University Song Book&quot;. &quot;By the 1890s its setting had been adapted to other lakes and rivers in North America and the name of its creator had been so completely forgotten that various people disputed Drummond&#x27;s authorship.&quot; It has been Drummond&#x27;s most anthologized poem.

Drummond composed other occasional poems for private circulation. &quot;But not all his poems were about habitants and country doctors, and not all of them were comic. Drummond wrote &#x27;Le Vieux Temps&#x27; (The Old Times, 1895) during his wife&#x27;s convalescence following the death of their first child.&quot;

Although &quot;he had preferred to compose his verse for private readings,&quot; Drummond was encouraged by his wife and brother to share his work. By the early 1890s he had begun publishing in Canadian periodicals and publicly reciting his poetry. In the middle of the decade he began planning a volume. Publishers were courting him by 1896.

&quot;The Habitant and Other Poems&quot; appeared in 1897, with a New York City publisher, illustrations by Canadian landscape artist F.S. Coburn, and an enthusiastic introduction (in French) by prominent poet Louis Fréchette. Fréchette &quot;passed on a compliment that Henry Wadsworth Longfellow had paid to Drummond, calling him &#x27;The pathfinder of a new land of song.&#x27;&quot; With 
Fréchette&#x27;s assurance that Drummond&#x27;s dialect poetry did not mock them, French-Canadians &quot;whole-heartedly supported his verse.&quot;

The book &quot;was both a popular and a critical success. Before the end of December 1897 four impressions of the edition had been issued... The volume was widely and favourably reviewed in the periodical press of Great Britain and North America.&quot; By the time of Drummond&#x27;s death, 38,000 copies had been printed.

===Later life===

Drummond found himself besieged with requests for speaking engagements, for magazine submissions, for more books. He did as much as he could. Three more volumes of Habitant verse were issued by 1905. &quot;All three were illustrated by Coburn and were extensively reviewed and warmly received; the last two were reprinted many times.&quot; In addition, Drummond &quot;undertook various lecture tours in the United States and Canada,&quot; and visited British Columbia in 1901 and Great Britain in 1902.

In August 1904, Drummond&#x27;s only daughter, Moira, was born. That September his third son, William Harvey, died at three years of age. One of William Henry Drummond&#x27;s &quot;most famous poems, &#x27;,&#x27; which appeared in &quot;The voyageur and other poems&quot;, came to him as a result of a dream that he had on Christmas Eve 1904 while he was still mourning the boy&#x27;s death.&quot;

In 1905, Drummond closed his Montreal medical practice. He began spending extensive time in Cobalt, Ontario, where he and his brothers had acquired interest in silver mines. &quot;He served for a year as the town&#x27;s first doctor, was vice-president of Drummond Silver Mine, and wrote poetry of life in the north.&quot;

In the early spring of 1907 Drummond returned to Montreal, and took his wife on a trip to New York City and Washington, D.C. By April, though, he had returned to Cobalt, where he died of a cerebral hemorrhage on the morning of April 6. &quot;Probably no other Canadian poet has been so widely mourned.&quot; His funeral was held at St. George&#x27;s Anglican Church (Montreal), where he had worshipped for much of his life, and he was buried in that city&#x27;s Mount Royal Cemetery.

==Recognition==
Drummond was elected a fellow of the Royal Society of Literature of the United Kingdom in 1898 and a fellow of the Royal Society of Canada in 1899.

He received honorary degrees from the University of Toronto in 1902 and from Bishop&#x27;s University in 1905.

&quot;The Wreck of the &quot;Julie Plante&quot;&quot; has been set to many folk tunes, and to new music by several composers including H.H. Godfrey, Geoffrey O&#x27;Hara, and Herbert Spencer.

The Dr. William Henry Drummond Poetry Contest, one of the longest-running national poetry contests in Canada, was established in 1970 in Cobalt, Ontario. &quot;The Drummond Poetry Contest features $1000 in prizes, an anthology, a new trophy, and award ceremony at the Spring Pulse Poetry Festival in Cobalt&quot; in May.

<doc id="744619" wikidata="Q733850" url="?curid=744619" title="Allen Drury">
<text>Allen Stuart Drury (September 2, 1918 – September 2, 1998) was an American novelist. During World War II, he was a reporter in the Senate, closely observing Presidents Franklin D. Roosevelt and Harry S. Truman, among others. He would convert these experiences into his first novel &quot;Advise and Consent&quot;, for which he won the Pulitzer Prize for Fiction in 1960. Long afterwards, it was still being praised as ‘the definitive Washington tale’. His diaries from this period were published as &quot;A Senate Journal 1943–45&quot;.

==Early life and ancestry==
Drury was born on September 2, 1918, in Houston, Texas, to Alden Monteith Drury (1895–1975), a citrus industry manager, real estate broker, and insurance agent, and Flora Allen (1894–1973), a legislative representative for the California Parent-Teacher Association. The family moved to Whittier, California, where Alden and Flora had a daughter, Anne Elizabeth (1924–1998). Drury was a direct descendant of Hugh Drury (1616–1689) and Lydia Rice (1627–1675), daughter of Edmund Rice (1594–1663), all of whom were early immigrants to Massachusetts Bay Colony.

Allen Stuart Drury grew up in Porterville, California, and earned his B.A. at Stanford University, where he joined Alpha Kappa Lambda, in 1939. He told Writer&#x27;s Yearbook that he was &quot;associate editor, wrote a column, and editorials.&quot; His last series of novels, written shortly before he died, were inspired by his experiences at Stanford. After graduating from Stanford, Drury went to work for the &quot;Tulare Bee&quot; in Porterville in 1940, where he won the Sigma Delta Chi Award for editorial writing from the Society of Professional Journalists. He then moved to Bakersfield and wrote for the &quot;Bakersfield Californian&quot;, where he &quot;handled what they called county news.&quot; Drury enlisted in the U.S. Army on July 25, 1942, in Los Angeles and trained as an infantry soldier, but was discharged &quot;because of an old back injury.&quot;

==&quot;A Senate Journal&quot;==
In 1943, Drury moved to Washington. &quot;I went East and wound up in Washington, which fascinated me, and I thought I would get a job for about a year for experience before coming back to the coast. I came back twenty years later, finally.&quot;

From 1943 to 1945, Drury worked as the United States Senate correspondent for United Press which, as he wrote, gave him the opportunity &quot;to be of some slight assistance in making my fellow countrymen better acquainted with their Congress and particularly their Senate.&quot; He worked as a reporter, but also kept a journal in which he recorded the events of Congress as well as his impressions and views of individual senators and the Senate itself. Drury&#x27;s journal followed the career of Harry S. Truman from junior senator to President of the United States, and also covered &quot;President Franklin D. Roosevelt and his contentious relations with the Senate.&quot; The journal was published in 1963 as &quot;A Senate Journal 1943–45&quot; after Drury had experienced great success with his 1959 novel &quot;Advise and Consent&quot;.

After leaving United Press, he free-lanced for a year, writing a column for local papers in the West. &quot;This venture lasted about a year and did not succeed, as it does not for many people.&quot; He then moved to &quot;Pathfinder Magazine&quot;, a general news magazine. From there, he moved to the &quot;Washington Evening Star&quot;, where he gained a reputation for the quality of his writing. Various pieces from this period were collected in a volume entitled &quot;Three Kids in a Cart&quot;.

==&quot;Advise and Consent&quot; and later works==
In 1954, James Reston, the Washington bureau chief of &quot;The New York Times&quot;, hired Drury. Russell Baker, hired at about the same time, recalled the circumstances in a remembrance published after Drury&#x27;s death:

In his spare time, Drury wrote the novel which would become 1959&#x27;s &quot;Advise and Consent&quot;. Drury later wrote a memorandum for his archives at the Hoover Institution in which he gives a full account of how the book came to be written and published. Baker was one of the first people to read the manuscript and describes his initial reluctance and then reaction:
The novel uses several incidents from Drury&#x27;s fifteen years in Washington as pegs for the story, about a controversial nominee for Secretary of State. Addressing the suggestion that the book was a &quot;roman à clef&quot;, Drury wrote a very sharply worded preface which was only published in the new edition:
The novel spent 102 weeks on &quot;The New York Times&quot; Best Seller list. It won the Pulitzer Prize for Fiction in 1960. It was adapted into a well-received Broadway play by Loring Mandel, who is known for a highly successful career writing for television. Otto Preminger directed an acclaimed 1962 film starring Henry Fonda. In 2009, Scott Simon of NPR wrote in &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot;, &quot;Fifty years after its publication and astounding success ... Allen Drury&#x27;s novel remains the definitive Washington tale.&quot; When it was republished, ABC News White House correspondent Jonathan Karl wrote for &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; that it offers &quot;a compelling portrait of American social and political history and even today is well worth reading.&quot;

With the success of &quot;Advise and Consent&quot;, Drury left &quot;The New York Times.&quot; He became a political correspondent for &quot;Reader&#x27;s Digest&quot;, but wrote very little for it. From then on, his only major publications were his books. He followed &quot;Advise and Consent&quot; with several sequels. &quot;A Shade of Difference&quot; (1962) is set a year after &quot;Advise and Consent,&quot; and uses the United Nations as a backdrop for portraying racial tensions in the American South and in Africa. Drury then turned his attention to the next presidential election after those events with &quot;Capable of Honor&quot; (1966) and &quot;Preserve and Protect&quot; (1968). &quot;Preserve and Protect&quot; had a cliffhanger ending—an assassination in which the victim is not identified.  He then wrote two alternative finales based on two different outcomes of the assassination: &quot;Come Nineveh, Come Tyre&quot; (1973) and &quot;The Promise of Joy&quot; (1975). The last two books are set in the middle of a full international crisis.

In 1971, Drury published &quot;The Throne of Saturn&quot;, a political/science fiction novel about the first attempt at sending a crewed mission to Mars in competition with a similar Soviet effort. With the historical novel &quot;A God Against the Gods&quot; (1976) and its sequel &quot;Return to Thebes&quot;, Drury explored the reign and fall of Pharaoh Akhenaten of ancient Egypt. The novels are based on extensive reading about the Amarna Period and, in the introduction to &quot;A God Against the Gods&quot;, he thanks at length the greatest Egyptologist of the time, Cyril Aldred, for his guidance on research. He disagreed with Aldred&#x27;s view that Akhenaten&#x27;s religious innovations were accepted by the supplanted religious authorities. Drury wrote, &quot;I am afraid my own view, conditioned by some years as a political correspondent, is much more cynical concerning the lengths to which human beings, of whatever era, will go in order to get, and keep, power.&quot;

After the Egypt novels, Drury returned to Washington in a succession of novels that were only tenuously related. &quot;Anna Hastings&quot; (1977) is more a novel about journalism than politics. He returned to the Senate in 1979 with &quot;Mark Coffin, U.S.S.&quot;, which was followed by the two-part &quot;The Hill of Summer&quot; (1981) and &quot;The Roads of Earth&quot; (1984), though the four books are not a series. Drury also wrote stand-alone novels, &quot;Decision&quot; (1983) about the Supreme Court, and &quot;Pentagon&quot; (1986) and &quot;A Thing of State&quot; (1995) about the State Department. His career ended with the trilogy of books following the lives of fictional members of his Stanford graduating class: &quot;Toward What Bright Glory?&quot; (1994), &quot;Into What Far Harbor?&quot;(1997), and &quot;Public Men&quot; (1998). John J. Miller wrote that readers are &quot;able to mark through Washington&#x27;s major institutions with Drury and his novels ... Television producers who want to develop a show to compete with Netflix&#x27;s &quot;House of Cards&quot; would do well to look to Drury.&quot;

&quot;Advise and Consent&quot; was out of print for almost 15 years and it ranked #27 on the 2013 BookFinder.com list of the Top 100 Most Searched for Out of Print Books before WordFire Press reissued it in paperback and e-book format in February 2014. The WordFire edition includes never-before-published essays about the book written by Drury himself, new appendices, and remembrances by Drury&#x27;s heirs and literary executors Kenneth and Kevin Killiany. WordFire also released &quot;Advise and Consent&quot; five sequels, and other novels. WordFire is projected to ultimately bring out about 20 of Drury&#x27;s novels.

==Personal life and death==
Drury, whose &quot;passions were reading and travel…was an intensely private man, who never married, and lived quietly.&quot; In one of the White House audiotapes, Richard Nixon in conversation with H.R. Haldeman and John Ehrlichman stated, &quot;Allen Drury is a homosexual.&quot;

Drury lived in Tiburon, California, from 1964 until his death. He completed his 20th novel, &quot;Public Men&quot;, just two weeks before his death. He died of cardiac arrest on September 2, 1998, his 80th birthday, at St. Mary&#x27;s Medical Center in San Francisco, California.

<doc id="744621" wikidata="Q1856893" url="?curid=744621" title="Privilege escalation">
<text>Privilege escalation is the act of exploiting a bug, a design flaw, or a configuration oversight in an operating system or software application to gain elevated access to resources that are normally protected from an application or user. The result is that an application or user with more privileges than intended by the application developer or system administrator can perform unauthorized actions.

==Background==
Most computer systems are designed for use with multiple user accounts, each of which has abilities known as privileges. Common privileges include viewing and editing files or modifying system files.

Privilege escalation means users receive privileges they are not entitled to. These privileges can be used to delete files, view private information, or install unwanted programs such as viruses. It usually occurs when a system has a bug that allows security to be bypassed or, alternatively, has flawed design assumptions about how it will be used. Privilege escalation occurs in two forms:

* Vertical privilege escalation, also known as &quot;privilege elevation&quot;, where a lower privilege user or application accesses functions or content reserved for higher privilege users or applications (e.g. Internet Banking users can access site administrative functions or the password for a smartphone can be bypassed).
* Horizontal privilege escalation, where a normal user accesses functions or content reserved for other normal users (e.g. Internet Banking User A accesses the Internet bank account of User B).

==Vertical==

This type of privilege escalation occurs when the user or process is able to obtain a higher level of access than an administrator or system developer intended, possibly by performing kernel-level operations.

===Examples===
In some cases, a high-privilege application assumes that it would only be provided with input matching its interface specification, thus doesn&#x27;t validate this input. Then, an attacker may be able to exploit this assumption, in order to run unauthorized code with the application&#x27;s privileges:
*Some Windows services are configured to run under the Local System user account. A vulnerability such as a buffer overflow may be used to execute arbitrary code with privilege elevated to Local System. Alternatively, a system service that is impersonating a lesser user can elevate that user&#x27;s privileges if errors are not handled correctly while the user is being impersonated (e.g. if the user has introduced a malicious error handler)
*Under some legacy versions of the Microsoft Windows operating system, the All Users screensaver runs under the Local System account – any account that can replace the current screensaver binary in the file system or Registry can therefore elevate privileges.
* A Windows driver, for example kprocesshacker.sys, can be used to run programs such as cmd.exe as internal accounts, also providing access to LocalSystem. 
*In certain versions of the Linux kernel it was possible to write a program that would set its current directory to codice_1, request that a core dump be performed in case it crashes and then have itself killed by another process. The core dump file would have been placed at the program&#x27;s current directory, that is, codice_1, and codice_3 would have treated it as a text file instructing it to run programs on schedule. Because the contents of the file would be under attacker&#x27;s control, the attacker would be able to execute any program with root privileges.
*Cross Zone Scripting is a type of privilege escalation attack in which a website subverts the security model of web browsers, thus allowing it to run malicious code on client computers.
*There are also situations where an application can use other high privilege services and has incorrect assumptions about how a client could manipulate its use of these services. An application that can execute Command line or shell commands could have a Shell Injection vulnerability if it uses unvalidated input as part of an executed command. An attacker would then be able to run system commands using the application&#x27;s privileges.
*Texas Instruments calculators (particularly the TI-85 and TI-82) were originally designed to use only interpreted programs written in dialects of TI-BASIC; however, after users discovered bugs that could be exploited to allow native Z-80 code to run on the calculator hardware, TI released programming data to support third-party development. (This did not carry on to the ARM-based TI-Nspire, for which jailbreaks using Ndless have been found but are still actively fought against by Texas Instruments.)
*Some versions of the iPhone allow an unauthorised user to access the phone while it is locked.

===Jailbreaking===

In computer security, jailbreaking is defined as the act of removing limitations that a vendor attempted to hard-code into its software or services. A common example is the use of toolsets to break out of a chroot or jail in UNIX-like operating systems or bypassing digital rights management (DRM). In the former case, it allows the user to see files outside of the filesystem that the administrator intends to make available to the application or user in question. In the context of DRM, this allows the user to run arbitrarily defined code on devices with DRM as well as break out of chroot-like restrictions. The term originated with the iPhone/iOS jailbreaking community and has also been used as a term for PlayStation Portable hacking; these devices have repeatedly been subject to jailbreaks, allowing the execution of arbitrary code, and sometimes have had those jailbreaks disabled by vendor updates.

iOS systems including the iPhone, iPad, and iPod Touch have been subject to iOS jailbreaking efforts since they were released, and continuing with each firmware update. iOS jailbreaking tools include the option to install package frontends such as Cydia and Installer.app, third-party alternatives to the App Store, as a way to find and install system tweaks and binaries. To prevent iOS jailbreaking, Apple has made the device boot ROM execute checks for SHSH blobs in order to disallow uploads of custom kernels and prevent software downgrades to earlier, jailbreakable firmware. In an &quot;untethered&quot; jailbreak, the iBoot environment is changed to execute a boot ROM exploit and allow submission of a patched low level bootloader or hack the kernel to submit the jailbroken kernel after the SHSH check.

A similar method of jailbreaking exists for S60 Platform smartphones, where utilities such as HelloOX allow the execution of unsigned code and full access to system files. or edited firmware (similar to the M33 hacked firmware used for the PlayStation Portable) to circumvent restrictions on unsigned code. Nokia has since issued updates to curb unauthorized jailbreaking, in a manner similar to Apple.

In the case of gaming consoles, jailbreaking is often used to execute homebrew games. In 2011, Sony, with assistance from law firm Kilpatrick Stockton, sued 21-year-old George Hotz and associates of the group fail0verflow for jailbreaking the PlayStation 3 (see &quot;Sony Computer Entertainment America v. George Hotz&quot; and PlayStation Jailbreak).

Jailbreaking can also occur in systems and software that use generative artificial intelligence models, such as ChatGPT. In jailbreaking attacks on artificial intelligence systems, users are able to manipulate the model to behave differently than it was programmed, making it possible to reveal information about how the model was instructed and induce it to respond in an anomalous or harmful way.

===Android===

Android phones can be officially rooted by either going through manufacturers controlled process, using an exploit to gain root, or installing a rooting modification. Manufacturers allow rooting through a process they control, while some allow the phone to be rooted simply by pressing specific key combinations at boot time, or by other self-administered methods. Using a manufacturers method almost always factory resets the device, making rooting useless to people who want to view the data, and also voids the warranty permanently, even if the device is derooted and reflashed. Software exploits commonly either target a root-level process that is accessible to the user, by using an exploit specific to the phone&#x27;s kernel, or using a known Android exploit that has been patched in newer versions; by not upgrading the phone, or intentionally downgrading the version.

===Mitigation strategies===
Operating systems and users can use the following strategies to reduce the risk of privilege escalation:
* Data Execution Prevention
* Address space layout randomization (to make it harder for buffer overruns to execute privileged instructions at known addresses in memory)
* Running applications with least privilege (for example by running Internet Explorer with the Administrator SID disabled in the process token) in order to reduce the ability of buffer overrun exploits to abuse the privileges of an elevated user.
* Requiring kernel mode code to be digitally signed.
* Patching
* Use of compilers that trap buffer overruns
* Encryption of software and/or firmware components.
* Use of an operating system with Mandatory Access Controls (MAC) such as SELinux
* Kernel Data Relocation Mechanism (dynamically relocates privilege information in the running kernel, preventing privilege escalation attacks using memory corruption)
Recent research has shown what can effectively provide protection against privilege escalation attacks. These include the proposal of the additional kernel observer (AKO), which specifically prevents attacks focused on OS vulnerabilities. Research shows that AKO is in fact effective against privilege escalation attacks.

==Horizontal==
Horizontal privilege escalation occurs when an application allows the attacker to gain access to resources which normally would have been protected from an application or user. The result is that the application performs actions with the same user but different security context than intended by the application developer or system administrator; this is effectively a limited form of privilege escalation (specifically, the unauthorized assumption of the capability of impersonating other users). Compared to the vertical privilege escalation, horizontal requires no upgrading the privilege of accounts. It often relies on the bugs in the system.

===Examples===
This problem often occurs in web applications. Consider the following example:
* User A has access to their own bank account in an Internet Banking application.
* User B has access to their own bank account in the same Internet Banking application.
* The vulnerability occurs when User A is able to access User B&#x27;s bank account by performing some sort of malicious activity.

This malicious activity may be possible due to common web application weaknesses or vulnerabilities.

Potential web application vulnerabilities or situations that may lead to this condition include:
* Predictable session IDs in the user&#x27;s HTTP cookie
* Session fixation
* Cross-site scripting
* Easily guessable passwords
* Theft or hijacking of session cookies
* Keystroke logging

<text>The Intense Football League (IFL) was a professional indoor football minor league that began operations in 2004. Its focus was in Texas, but it was notable for being the first professional football league to place a franchise in Alaska.

==History==
During its first season, the El Paso Rumble folded and the league oversaw operations of the team until the end of the season. In 2005, the Amarillo Dusters left for the AF2, while the other teams joined the National Indoor Football League and the league suspended operations. In 2006, the Intense Football League restarted. Three of the original teams (Odessa, San Angelo and Corpus Christi) returned to the IFL, joined by new teams from Belton, Lake Charles, and Laredo.

Following the 2006 season, the Laredo Lobos left for AF2, but the league expanded with three new teams for 2007 in the Frisco Thunder, Katy Ruff Riders, and Alaska Wild (notable for being the first ever professional football team in the state of Alaska). For 2008 another Alaskan team was added with the Fairbanks Grizzlies. The league planned to add a team in El Paso for 2009.

On July 22, 2008, it was announced that the IFL would be merging with United Indoor Football for the upcoming 2009 season, following the National Indoor Bowl Championship between both leagues&#x27; champions on August 2. On August 1 it was announced the new league would be called Indoor Football League.

<text>Ialoveni () is a city in the Republic of Moldova situated from Chișinău. The city is administrative center of the Ialoveni District.

== History ==
On 25 March 1977 the settlement was named to Kutuzov, and also its status was changed to urban-type settlement. In 1989, after Moldova gained suveranity, on citizens&#x27; demand, the locality re-took its old name – Ialoveni. Since 7 December 1994 Ialoveni has status of city/town ().

==Demographics==
According to the 2014 census, the population of Ialoveni amounted to 12,515 inhabitants, a decrease compared to the previous census in 2004, when 15,041 inhabitants were registered. 5,968 were men and 6,547 were women. 


&quot;Footnotes&quot;: 

* &quot;There is an ongoing controversy regarding the ethnic identification of Moldovans and Romanians.&quot;

* &quot;Moldovan language is one of the two local names for the Romanian language in Moldova. In 2013, the Constitutional Court of Moldova interpreted that Article 13 of the constitution is superseded by the Declaration of Independence, thus giving official status to the name &quot;Romanian&quot;.&quot;

<doc id="744639" wikidata="Q944672" url="?curid=744639" title="Thalweg">
<text>In geography, hydrography, and fluvial geomorphology, a thalweg or talweg () is the line or curve of lowest elevation within a valley or watercourse. Its vertical position in maps is the nadir (greatest depth, sounding) in the stream profile.

Under international law, a thalweg is instead taken to be the middle of the primary navigable channel of a waterway which is the default legal presumption for the boundary between entities such as states. Thalwegs can have local proprietorial and administrative significance because their formerly somewhat shifting position, reliant on renewed soundings, now more fixed as described internationally, is part of centuries-old custom and practice in some jurisdictions. In some jurisdictions and between some states the median line (between banks) is the preferred boundary presumption as may extend from estuaries. Also being easy to map, drawing &quot;turning points&quot; are the solution for a few major rivers such as the St Lawrence River-Great Lakes system.

==Etymology==
The word &quot;&quot; is of 19th-century German origin. The German word (modern spelling ) is a compound noun that is built from the German elements (since Duden&#x27;s orthography reform of 1901 written ) meaning &quot;valley&quot; (cognate with &quot;dale&quot; in English), and , meaning &quot;way.&quot; It means &quot;valley way&quot; and is used, with its modern spelling , in daily German to describe a path or road which follows the bottom of a valley, or in geography with the more technical meaning also adopted by English.

==Hydrology==
In hydrological and fluvial landforms, the thalweg is a line drawn to join the lowest points along the length of a stream bed or valley in its downward slope, defining its deepest channel. The thalweg thus marks the natural direction (the profile) of a watercourse. The term is sometimes used to refer to a subterranean stream that percolates under the surface and in the same general direction as the surface stream.

==Bouldering of thalweg of non-canalised rivers==
Slowing stream-bed erosion by bouldering a thalweg helps stabilize natural rivers&#x27; course and depth. Placing boulders along the thalweg helps to protect the channel&#x27;s sedimentary erosion and deposit balance. In concurrence with this, doing so along an instream to form artificial sills helps to slow the sedimentary erosion and deposit of watercourses, while keeping the esteem (fishing, local wildlife, and recreation) and natural resources of the running water source intact. Placement of boulders along a thalweg and the creation of instream sills makes drying up rarer and less severe during late summer, and abates cases of severe sediment erosion and deposit in the spring and fall months when the flow rates are high, particularly if those rates have increased. Such partial infilling of a thalweg was prototyped in Meacham Creek in Umatilla, Oregon.

==Thalweg principle==

The &quot;thalweg principle&quot; (also known as the &quot;thalweg doctrine&quot; or the &quot;rule of thalweg&quot;) is the legal principle that if the boundary between two political entities is stated to be a waterway without further description (&quot;e.g.&quot;, a median line, right bank, eastern shore, low-tide line, etc.), the boundary follows the thalweg of that watercourse. A thalweg is the center of the principal navigable channel of the waterway (which is presumed to be the deepest part). If there are multiple navigable channels in a river, the one principally used for downstream travel (likely having the strongest current) is used. The definition has been used in specific descriptions as well. The Treaty of Versailles, for example, specifies that &quot;In the case of boundaries which are defined by a [navigable] waterway&quot; the boundary is to follow &quot;the median line of the principal channel of navigation.&quot;

The precise drawing of river boundaries has been important on countless occasions. Notable examples include the Shatt al-Arab between Iraq and Iran, the Danube in central Europe (Croatia–Serbia border dispute), the Kasikili/Sedudu Island dispute between Namibia and Botswana (settled by the International Court of Justice in 1999), and the 2004 dispute settlement under the UN Law of the Sea concerning the offshore boundary between Guyana and Suriname, in which the thalweg of the Courantyne River played a role in the ruling. In the 20th century dispute between the USSR and China (PRC) over Zhenbao Island, China held that the Thalweg principle supported their position. The doctrine is also applied to sub-national boundaries, such as those between American states.

<text>Dwyfor was one of the five local government districts of Gwynedd, Wales from 1974 to 1996, covering the Llŷn peninsula. Its council was based in Pwllheli.

==History==
The district was created on 1 April 1974, under the Local Government Act 1972. It covered the whole area of four former districts and parts of a fifth from the administrative county of Caernarfonshire, which were all abolished at the same time:
*Beddgelert parish from Gwyrfai Rural District
*Clynnog parish from Gwyrfai Rural District
*Criccieth Urban District
*Llŷn Rural District
*Porthmadog Urban District
*Pwllheli Municipal Borough
The new district was named after the river Dwyfor.

Dwyfor was notable for being the last stronghold of the Sabbatarian temperance movement in Wales. Under the terms of the Licensing Act 1961, local referendums prevented the opening of public houses on Sundays until 1996.

Under the Local Government (Wales) Act 1994, the previous two tier system of counties and districts was replaced with new principal areas (each designated either a &quot;county&quot; or a &quot;county borough&quot;), whose councils perform the functions previously divided between the county and district councils. The Dwyfor area merged with Arfon and Meirionnydd to become a county which the government initially called &quot;Caernarfonshire and Merionethshire&quot;. During the transition to the new system, the shadow authority requested a change of name from &quot;Caernarfonshire and Meirionethshire&quot; to &quot;Gwynedd&quot;. The government confirmed the change with effect from 2 April 1996, one day after the new council came into being.

The Dwyfor area remains in use as an area committee of Gwynedd Council.

==Political control==
The first election to the council was held in 1973. The council operated as a shadow authority alongside the outgoing authorities until it came into its powers on 1 April 1974. Throughout the council&#x27;s existence a majority of the seats were held by independents:
==Premises==
The council established its main offices on Embankment Road in Pwllheli. After the council&#x27;s abolition in 1996 the building became an area office of Gwynedd Council.

<text>Paremata is a suburb of Porirua, on the Tasman Sea coast to the north of Wellington, New Zealand.

==History==

===Early history===
The modern suburb, just south of Plimmerton, derives its name from the &quot;Paremata Barracks&quot;, erected on the north shore of Porirua Harbour in about 1846 when the British Empire was nervous about the local Ngāti Toa tribe under its leader Te Rauparaha. The stone barracks were largely destroyed by an earthquake in 1848.

The Wellington and Manawatu Railway Company built a station nearby, towards the end of the 19th century. In 1936 a road bridge finally spanned the entrance to the Pāuatahanui Inlet, greatly easing access to Wellington for the growing suburb. After a coast road was built between Pukerua Bay and Paekākāriki further north, the route through Paremata became part of State Highway 1. Later developments to ease congestion included the Paremata Roundabout, just south of the road bridge, reducing some of the distress that was occasionally caused at what came to be known as &quot;Glass Corner&quot;.

During World War II, United States soldiers were stationed near the barracks, on land that later became the Ngatitoa Domain.

===Recent history===
With the building of the new Paremata Railway Station across the inlet, the locality south of the road and rail bridges took on the name Paremata as well. The street along the original shoreline had been known as &quot;The Crescent&quot; for decades, but by the end of the 20th century it was commonly called &quot;Paremata Crescent&quot;.

The area to the north, which included a subdivision called &quot;Dolly Varden&quot; (named after a Charles Dickens character), is now called Mana because the new Mana Railway Station a little further north was given that name; probably because it is the first point on the rail journey north at which travellers get a view of Mana Island. Current maps identify the areas to the north of the road and rail bridges as &#x27;Mana&#x27; and the areas to the south as &#x27;Paremata&#x27;, matching the naming of the railway stations and streets.

By the start of the 21st century, several members of the Ngāti Toa iwi had served on the Porirua City Council, and the whole locality around the Ngatitoa Domain had become a busy suburb and fishing base with housing and commerce. A new suburb, Papakōwhai, has grown on the hills to the south, while the large suburb of Whitby has developed to the east, with its main access via from the Paremata Roundabout.

In August 2004, a new road bridge was opened for northbound traffic, allowing southbound traffic to use both lanes of the old bridge. This is part of an ongoing project by Transit New Zealand to solve congestion issues and improve safety of motorists, pedestrians and local residents accessing SH 1 from side-roads and driveways. By July 2006 a series of traffic lights had been installed along Mana Esplanade, along with two transit lanes. A second feeder roundabout had been constructed on SH 58 allowing easier access to Whitby.

The SH 1 route through Paremata was renumbered on 7 December 2021, due to SH 1 being shifted to the Transmission Gully Motorway.

<doc id="744648" wikidata="Q48824" url="?curid=744648" title="Seattle Liberation Front">
<text>The Seattle Liberation Front, or SLF, was a radical anti-Vietnam War movement, based in Seattle, Washington, in the United States. The group, founded by the University of Washington visiting philosophy professor and political activist Michael Lerner, carried out its protest activities from 1970 to 1971.
The most famous members of the SLF were the &quot;Seattle Seven,&quot; who were charged with &quot;conspiracy to incite a riot&quot; in the wake of a violent protest at a courthouse. The members of the Seattle Seven were Lerner, Michael Abeles, Jeff Dowd, Joe Kelly, Susan Stern, Roger Lippman and Charles Marshall III.

==Formation==
After the nationwide organization Students for a Democratic Society (SDS) disintegrated in 1969, Michael Lerner, an instructor newly arrived in Seattle from Berkeley, California, felt compelled to start up his own local group. He kick-started his efforts by inviting Jerry Rubin, a notable counterculture figure, to speak on the University of Washington campus on January 17, 1970 – two days later, the SLF was formed, largely composed of students and radicals coming out of organizations (like the SDS) that had recently disbanded. The exact impetus for Lerner seeking a new organization is somewhat vague. The founding of SLF came less than a month after SDS Weatherman, which had staged violent street demonstrations during the latter half of 1969, announced that it was going underground to adopt a strategy of random acts of bombing, arson, and other sabotage. It has not been explained whether or not Lerner was seeking a new organization prior to Weatherman&#x27;s underground turn. One of the SLF&#x27;s first actions was to hold a demonstration in support of the Chicago Seven, a group of radicals charged with inciting riots at the 1968 Democratic National Convention.

==Affiliation with Weather Underground==
The relationship between the Weather Underground and the Seattle Liberation Front remains somewhat ambiguous. Both groups shared many of the same political viewpoints, where they participated in protests and demonstrations, and there was overlap in membership. The violent, confrontational style of protest at events sponsored by SLF was identical with that of the SDS Weatherman faction before the latter went underground at the end of 1969. There were no official ties between the Seattle Liberation Front and the Weather Underground. Chip Marshall was one of the leading members of the Seattle Liberation Front. In an interview with Time magazine in 1980, Marshall commented on the takeover of the SDS by Weatherman, a violent radical left faction. He said Weatherman had established cultural standards to which members were to adhere. Marshall did not agree with destroying monogamy, cutting family ties, and devaluing personal relationships. SLF founder Michael Lerner was never known to be affiliated with the Weather Underground or to endorse its strategy of bombing and arson.

==Demonstrations==
SLF planned a demonstration to be held at the Federal Courthouse in downtown Seattle on February 17, 1970. It is commonly referred to by former SLF members as &quot;The Day After&quot; or &quot;TDA.&quot; The roughly 2,000 protesters in attendance escalated their protests into violence, throwing rocks and paint bombs at both the courthouse and at police responding to the scene. Twenty were injured in the riot, and 76 were arrested. Michael Lerner stated that it was a different sequence of events: &quot;when it [the demonstration] was attacked by police, it turned into a riot.&quot; In March 1970, the Seattle Liberation Front, UW Black Student Union, and the Weathermen organized hundreds of protesters at the University of Washington&#x27;s campus. The groups wanted the university to sever its athletic links with Brigham Young University, a Mormon school that was accused of racism. Seattle Liberation Front and Black Student Union supporters initiated a riot that moved through eleven buildings at the University of Washington&#x27;s Seattle campus. Around 200 chanting demonstrators left a trail of damage throughout the campus. Members of the SLF collective based at 814 South Weller Street spoke at a design hearing for the then-proposed I-90 freeway in June 1970, denouncing the project as &quot;racist&quot; and advocating revolution.

==Indictments and trial==
Two months later, on April 16, a federal grand jury indicted members of the SLF on charges of inciting the February 17 riot – Lerner was charged with &quot;using the facilities of interstate commerce [a telephone] with the intent of inciting to riot,&quot; but he was not charged with &quot;inciting to riot.&quot; (One of the eight, Michael Justesen, disappeared but was later arrested in California by the FBI in an infiltration of the Weathermen). Federal District Judge George Boldt was assigned the case, which began in his Tacoma courtroom on November 23, 1970. The trial was quickly derailed by the defendants&#x27; vocal disruptions, a protest walkout, and their eventual refusal to enter the courtroom. Boldt declared a mistrial on December 10, citing all defendants for contempt of court. He summarily found them guilty of contempt, sentenced them to six months in prison, and refused to grant bail. The defendants eventually served three months in prison.

The original charges of inciting a riot, or of intent to incite to riot, and conspiracy to damage the Seattle Federal Building, were unsuccessfully prosecuted. Lerner stated the reason for the failure to win a conviction was &quot;because it was revealed that the FBI agents who were infiltrating the anti-war organization were themselves the people who had precipitated the violence.&quot; Most observers agreed that the prosecution&#x27;s case was floundering (aided by the admission of government witnesses on the stand that they would &quot;go to any length&quot; to combat the radicals). It is believed by some that the Seattle Seven would have been freed if some of them had not provoked the elderly judge with catcalls during the proceedings.

==Aftermath and recent activities==
Due to the publicity of the trial, the Seattle Liberation Front faced ideological dissension, personality conflicts, and charges of &quot;male chauvinism.&quot; In the fall of 1970 SLF sponsored a short-lived weekly underground newspaper, &quot;Sabot&quot;, which folded in December after a three-month run amid political infighting among the staff. In late 1971, the SLF was disbanded. Many of the individual SLF members continued to promote diverse social movements, such as Capitol Hill&#x27;s Country Doctor Clinic. Lerner, the founder of SLF, eventually became the editor of &quot;Tikkun&quot; and an advisor to President Bill Clinton and Hillary Clinton. Jeff Dowd went to Hollywood to become a screenwriter and producer. Chip Marshall remained active in Washington politics, running for Seattle City Council in 1975 and working as a neighborhood activist in Issaquah.

==Cultural references==
In the movie &quot;The Big Lebowski&quot;, the main character Jeffrey &quot;The Dude&quot; Lebowski says, &quot;Did you ever hear of the Seattle Seven? That was me ... and six other guys.&quot; This refers to Jeff Dowd&#x27;s involvement in the Seattle Seven. He was a friend of the Coen brothers and the inspiration for the character &quot;The Dude.&quot;

The 3rd Battalion (Toronto Regiment), CEF was authorized on 10 August 1914 and embarked for Great Britain on 26 September 1914. It disembarked in France on 11 February 1915, where it fought as part of the 1st Infantry Brigade, 1st Canadian Division in France and Flanders until the end of the war. The battalion was disbanded on 15 September 1920.

It disembarked in France on 22 February 1916, where it fought as part of the 9th Infantry Brigade, 3rd Canadian Division in France and Flanders until the end of the war. The battalion was disbanded on 15 September 1920. Its battalion history is captured in the book, &quot;Second to None&quot; by Kevin Shackleton.

The 123rd Battalion (Royal Grenadiers), CEF, was authorized on 22 December 1915 and embarked for Great Britain on 7 and 8 August 1916. It was converted to pioneers and redesignated the 123rd Canadian Pioneer Battalion, Royal Grenadiers, CEF on 17 January 1917. It disembarked in France on 10 March 1917, where it served as the Pioneer Battalion of the 3rd Canadian Division in France and Flanders until 25 May 1918, when it was reorganized to form three new Engineering Battalions; the 7th, 8th and 9th Canadian Engineer Battalions, CEF. The battalion was disbanded on 15 September 1920. Its battalion history is chronicled in the book, &quot;One-Two-Three - The Story of the 123rd Battalion, Royal Grenadiers, CEF&quot; by Dan Mowat.

The 124th Battalion (Governor General&#x27;s Body Guard), CEF, was authorized on 22 December 1915 and embarked for Great Britain on 7 August 1916. It was redesignated the 124th Canadian Pioneer Battalion, CEF, on 17 January 1917. It disembarked in France on 11 March 1917, where it served as part of the 4th Canadian Division in France and Flanders until 26 May 1918, when it was reorganized to form three new Engineering Battalions; the 10th, 11th and 12th Canadian Engineer Battalions, CEF.

On 8 December 1916, its personnel were absorbed by the 169th Battalion (109th Regiment), CEF, to provide reinforcements for the Canadian Corps in the field. The battalion was disbanded on 17 July 1917.

The 204th Battalion (Beavers), CEF, was authorized on 15 July 1916 and embarked for Great Britain on 28 March 1917. On 4 May 1917, its personnel were absorbed by the 2nd Reserve Battalion, CEF, to provide reinforcements for the Canadian Corps in the field. The battalion was disbanded on 17 July 1917.

===Second World War===
The regiment mobilised the Royal Regiment of Canada, CASF (Canadian Active Service Force), for active service on 1 September 1939. It embarked for garrison duty in Iceland with &quot;Z&quot; Force on 10 June 1940, and on 31 October 1940 it was transferred to Great Britain. It was redesignated the 1st Battalion, the Royal Regiment of Canada, CASF, on 7 November 1940 when a 2nd Battalion was formed to provide reinforcements to the Regiment in Europe. The 1st battalion took part in the raid on Dieppe on 19 August 1942. It landed again in France on 7 July 1944, as part of the 4th Infantry Brigade, 2nd Canadian Infantry Division, and continued to fight in North-West Europe until the end of the war. The 1st battalion was disbanded on 31 December 1945 when it amalgamated with the 2nd Battalion back home.

===Raid on Dieppe - Blue Beach===
The naval engagement between the small German convoy and the craft carrying No. 3 Commando had alerted the German defenders at Blue Beach. The Royal Regiment of Canada landed near Puys along with three platoons from the Black Watch (Royal Highland Regiment) of Canada and an artillery detachment who were tasked to neutralize machine gun and artillery batteries protecting the Dieppe beach. They were delayed by 20 minutes and the smoke screens that should have hidden their assault had lifted, eliminating the advantage of surprise and darkness lost. The Germans manned their defensive positions in preparation for the landings. The well emplaced German forces stopped the Canadian forces that did land on the beach. As soon as they reached the shore, the Canadians found themselves pinned against the seawall, unable to advance and having murderous rifle and machine-gun fire rain down from the cliffs above. The Royals suffered severe casualties: of the 556 men in the regiment 200 were killed and 264 captured. The regiment evolved from the 10th Royal Grenadiers and thus inherited British traditions. The regiment was authorized to wear the distinctive scarlet uniform of the &quot;Guards&quot; on all ceremonial occasions by decree of Queen Victoria. It is also sixth in the order of precedence.

== Alliances ==
* – The Duke of Lancaster&#x27;s Regiment (King&#x27;s Lancashire and Border)

==Band==

The Band of The Royal Regiment of Canada is the oldest permanently organized band in the Canadian Army and in the whole of the Canadian Armed Forces. Based at Fort York in Toronto, the band has served its country, province and city in many different roles throughout the world since its formation in 1863. , the director of music is Captain Kevin Anderson, the band sergeant major is Warrant Officer Sheila Andrews, and the drum major is Sergeant Steven Yasinsky.

Some highlights from the band&#x27;s itinerary are:
* Performances for the Queen Mother, Princess Anne, the Duke of York, Prince Charles and Queen Elizabeth II.
* International commitments include: performances for the United Nations in Cyprus; the Military Musical Pageant, held at Wembley Stadium, in London, England; a command performance for the colonel-in-chief, Prince Charles, Prince of Wales, in the Gardens of Buckingham Palace; and, being selected as the official band to accompany the veterans and the official party to the United Kingdom and France to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the raid on Dieppe 19 August 1942. In summer 2006 the band performed at the 16th International Military Band Festival in Kraków, Poland. Recent years have seen the band travel from Gander, Newfoundland and Labrador, to Victoria, British Columbia, with many performances in between (including the launching of the ship the &quot;Hector&quot; in Pictou, Nova Scotia, The Summerside Tattoo in Prince Edward Island, and the 2000 International Military Festival of Music in Quebec City).

==The Royal Regiment of Canada Association==
The Royal Regiment of Canada Association consists of former members of the unit.
The Association meets the first Thursday of each month September to June in the Royal Regiment of Canada Warrant Officers and Sergeants Mess in Canadian Forces Armoury, Fort York.
The main goal of the association is to maintain the comradeship and esprit du corps of the regimental family. The Association in 2008 co-ordinated a successful fund-raising campaign aimed at obtaining sufficient stocks of the scarlet and blue full dress of the regiment to enable the majority of its personnel to parade in this traditional uniform on ceremonial occasions.

==The Museum of The Royal Regiment of Canada==

The museum preserves and displays the history of the Royal Regiment of Canada and its several predecessors for the benefit of both the members of the regiment and the public at large.

<doc id="744677" wikidata="Q458736" url="?curid=744677" title="Daniel Kirkwood">
<text>Daniel Kirkwood (September 27, 1814 – June 11, 1895) was an American astronomer.

Kirkwood was born in Harford County, Maryland, to John and Agnes (née Hope) Kirkwood. He graduated in mathematics from the York County Academy in York, Pennsylvania, in 1838. After teaching there for five years, he became Principal of the Lancaster High School in Lancaster, Pennsylvania, and after another five years he moved on to become Principal of the Pottsville Academy in Pottsville, Pennsylvania. In 1851, he was elected as a member to the American Philosophical Society. The same year he became Professor of Mathematics at Delaware College and in 1856 Professor of Mathematics at Indiana University in Bloomington, Indiana, where he stayed until his retirement in 1886, with the exception of two years, 1865–1867, at Jefferson College in Canonsburg, Pennsylvania.

Kirkwood&#x27;s most significant contribution came from his study of asteroid orbits. When arranging the then-growing number of discovered asteroids by their distance from the Sun, he noted several gaps, now named Kirkwood gaps in his honor, and associated these gaps with orbital resonances with the orbit of Jupiter. Further, Kirkwood also suggested a similar dynamic was responsible for Cassini Division in Saturn&#x27;s rings, as the result of a resonance with one of Saturn&#x27;s moons. In the same paper, he was the first to correctly posit that the material in meteor showers is cometary debris.

Kirkwood also identified a pattern relating the distances of the planets to their rotation periods, which was called Kirkwood&#x27;s Law. This discovery earned Kirkwood an international reputation among astronomers; he was dubbed &quot;the American Kepler&quot; by Sears Cook Walker, who claimed that Kirkwood&#x27;s Law proved the widely held Solar Nebula Theory. The &quot;Law&quot; has since become discredited as new measurements of planetary rotation periods have shown that the pattern doesn&#x27;t hold.

In 1891, at age 77, he became a lecturer in astronomy at Stanford University. He died in Riverside, California, in 1895.

Altogether he wrote 129 publications, including three books. The asteroid was named 1578 Kirkwood in his honor and so was the lunar impact crater &quot;Kirkwood&quot;, as well as Indiana University&#x27;s Kirkwood Observatory. He is buried in the Rose Hill Cemetery in Bloomington, Indiana, where Kirkwood Avenue is named for him.

Kirkwood was a cousin of Iowa governor Samuel Jordan Kirkwood who became United States Secretary of the Interior under President James A. Garfield and President Chester A. Arthur.

<text>William John Duane (May 9, 1780 – September 27, 1865) was an American politician and lawyer from Pennsylvania.

Duane served a brief term as United States Secretary of the Treasury in 1833. His refusal to withdraw Federal deposits from the Second Bank of the United States led to his dismissal by President Andrew Jackson.

==Early life==
Duane was born on May 9, 1780, in Clonmel, County Tipperary, Ireland. Duane emigrated to the United States with his parents, William Duane, and Catherine Corcoran in 1796, settling in Philadelphia.

In Ireland, his father had apprenticed with a local paper, the &quot;Hibernian Advertiser,&quot; that supported the Volunteer movement for reform, and celebrated the American struggle for independence. Duane senior then produced his paper in East India Company administered Bengal, until deported by order of the Governor General. In London, he edited &quot;The Telegraph&quot; as an active member of the city&#x27;s federation of democratic clubs, the London Corresponding Society and a United Irishman.

In Philadelphia, Duane assisted his father in publishing the &quot;Aurora&quot;, a pro-Jeffersonian Philadelphia newspaper, until 1806. He became an influential lawyer and served several terms in the Pennsylvania General Assembly, becoming one of the most powerful state politicians in Pennsylvania at the time.

==Marriage==

He was married on December 31, 1805, in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, to Deborah Franklin Bache, who was born on October 1, 1781, in Philadelphia, and died on February 12, 1863, in Philadelphia. His father-in-law was Richard Bache Sr., a marine insurance underwriter and importer in Philadelphia. Bache served as United States Postmaster General from 1776 to 1782. His mother-in-law was Sarah Franklin Bache, the daughter of Benjamin Franklin.

==Support for Andrew Jackson==

Duane supported Jackson for president in 1824 and 1828. He declined appointments to serve as government director of the Second Bank of the United States and United States District Attorney.

==Secretary of the Treasury==
In 1833, in the midst of the Bank War, President Andrew Jackson attempted to remove federal deposits from the Second Bank of the United States, whose money-lending functions were taken over by the legions of local and state banks that materialized across America, thus drastically increasing credit and speculation. Jackson&#x27;s moves were greatly controversial. He removed his moderately pro-Bank Treasury Secretary Louis McLane, having him serve instead as Secretary of State, replacing Edward Livingston. On May 29, he replaced McLane with Duane. However, Duane also refused to remove the deposits. As a result, Jackson fired him in September. He replaced him with Attorney General Roger B. Taney, a strong opponent of the Bank. Under Taney, the deposits began to be removed.

Duane defended his own position in his book &quot;Narrative and Correspondence Concerning the Removal of the Deposites, and Occurrences Connected Therewith&quot;, published in 1838.

Jackson biographer James Parton heaps high praise upon Duane. He lauds the Treasury Secretary for refusing to yield to a position that he could not in good conscience accept, therefore preserving his integrity and honor. &quot;In not yielding,&quot; Parton says, &quot;he displayed a genuine moral heroism.&quot; Later Jackson biographer Robert V. Remini treats Duane far less favorably. He faults both Jackson and Duane for the turmoil that characterized Duane&#x27;s brief time in office. He criticizes Jackson for not adequately screening Duane before nominating him, for allowing members of his administration to treat him poorly upon taking office, and for his dismissal of Duane. He continues:

He died on September 27, 1865, in Philadelphia and was interred at Laurel Hill Cemetery.

<doc id="744700" wikidata="Q360283" url="?curid=744700" title="José Napoleón Duarte">
<text>José Napoleón Duarte Fuentes (23 November 1925 – 23 February 1990) was a Salvadoran politician who served as President of El Salvador from 1 June 1984 to 1 June 1989. He was mayor of San Salvador before running for president in 1972. He lost, but the election is widely viewed as fraudulent. Following a coup d&#x27;état in 1979, Duarte led the subsequent civil-military Junta from 1980 to 1982. He was then elected president in 1984, defeating ARENA party leader Roberto D&#x27;Aubuisson.

Supported by the Reagan Administration and the Central Intelligence Agency, his time in office occurred during the worst years of the Salvadoran Civil War which saw numerous abuses and massacres of the civilian population by the Salvadoran security forces and the death squads linked to them.

==Early life==
Duarte was born in Santa Ana in the department of the same name. While he was studying at Liceo Salvadoreño in May 1944, he took part in the protests that brought down the twelve-year-old regime of then-President General Maximiliano Hernández Martínez. Other military regimes followed, and in 1945 he crossed the border into Guatemala to join the opposition in exile. Although he spoke no English at the time, his father enrolled him in the University of Notre Dame in Indiana, United States. In 1948, having worked doing dishes and laundry in order to support himself through his studies, he graduated with a degree in engineering before returning to an El Salvador uncomfortably transitioning to a democracy. He married his childhood sweetheart, Maria Inés Durán, with whom he had 6 children: Inés Guadalupe, Alejandro, Napoleón, María Eugenia, María Elena, and Ana Lorena. Duarte got a job in his father-in-law&#x27;s construction firm and, at the same time, began teaching.

==Political career==

===Mayor of San Salvador===

In 1960, he became a founding member and Secretary General of the Christian Democratic Party (PDC), which searched for a middle ground between the extreme right and the extreme left. Even as part of the United Democratic Party (PUD), the PDC failed to gain a seat in that year&#x27;s National Congress elections. After boycotting the 1962 presidential elections, Duarte became Mayor of San Salvador in March 1964. He initiated the Adult Evening Schools helping a lot of adult workers to become technicians and also get high school diplomas. He supported emerging sectors of the economy and some redistribution of wealth. Duarte easily won the next two elections for mayor in March 1966 and March 1968.

After leaving office in 1970, he set up his own estate agency until he ran in the February 20, 1972 presidential election under a political grouping called the United National Opposition (UNO). He lost to Arturo Armando Molina in an election that was widely viewed as fraudulent, with Molina declared the winner even though Duarte was said to have received a majority of the votes; poll watchers claimed the real vote tally was 327,000 for Duarte and 318,000 for Molina.

On 25 March 1972, a coup d&#x27;état was attempted by left-wing military officers who supported Duarte. The coup was suppressed and Duarte was arrested. He was subjected to torture. He was condemned to death for high treason, but international pressure forced Molina to grant him exile, which he obtained in Venezuela. Duarte got a job as an engineering advisor and became involved as a private investor in various construction projects. He was also given posts in the international Christian Democratic movement. In 1974, he returned to El Salvador, where he was promptly arrested and returned to Venezuela.

===Junta leader===

On 15 October 1979, a Revolutionary Government Junta (JRG) took control of El Salvador, deposing President Carlos Humberto Romero. This is the start of the beginning of a full scale civil war. Duarte returned to El Salvador on March 3, 1980 and joined the Junta, becoming El Salvador&#x27;s foreign minister.

Just weeks after joining the government, Duarte came to the attention of the U.S. public as spokesperson for the Junta following the assassination of Archbishop Romero on 24 March 1980. As an official source, he promoted a &quot;blame on both sides&quot; apologetic to explain the government&#x27;s lack of resolve to investigate the assassination.

On 22 December 1980, he became the head of state and of the Junta. The Farabundo Martí National Liberation Front (FMLN) responded by launching an all out attack on the government on January 10, 1981, which resulted in the regime receiving immediate military aid and advisors from the United States of America.

With the arrival of the new US government of Ronald Reagan, Duarte became a symbol for &quot;anti-communist&quot; resistance in Central America although support for the FMLN from the Soviet Union has been questioned by Noam Chomsky.

On 28 March 1982, elections were held to the National Congress in which Duarte&#x27;s Christian Democratic Party (PDC) party gained 24 of the 60 seats, putting them in opposition against the combined strength of the Nationalist Republican Alliance (ARENA) party, which gained 19 seats, and the National Conciliation Party (PNC), which gained 14. On 2 May, he handed over power to Álvaro Magaña, who had been chosen President by the National Congress. During his time at the head of the JRG, Duarte initiated land reform and nationalized certain industries such as sugar as well as denouncing human rights violations by the military and the FMLN alike. However, members of the military and affiliated death squad paramilitaries continued to carry out atrocities against the civilian population during his rule as the head of JRG, under the pretext of eliminating terrorists. The Salvadoran army received financial and material support throughout this period from the CIA, which also trained many of the death squads, and arranged for arms supplies from Israel when Congress terminated direct CIA support.

==President (1984–1989) ==
On 25 March 1984, in the 1984 presidential elections, Duarte (running as the PDC candidate), running along with Rodolfo Antonio Castillo Claramount, came in first with 43.4% of the vote. In the second round, on 6 May, he won with 53.6% of the vote against the Nationalist Republican Alliance (ARENA) candidate, Roberto D&#x27;Aubuisson. The elections were marred by violence between the FMLN and Salvadoran military at and near the polling stations. As both candidates were known to have close links with wartime undemocratic factions, the US government spent approximately US$2 million to support the democratic process and prevent violence at the voting polls. However, some scholars of Central American history have suggested that the CIA was merely ensuring that Duarte, the candidate favored by the US, was elected.

Duarte became president on 1 June. He was determined to end the civil war by &quot;dialogue without arms,&quot; and on 15 October 1984, in La Palma, Chalatenango, he met FMLN leaders face to face, which marked the beginning of the end of the civil war. His basic goal, he claimed, was to see the guerrillas disarm and then to demobilize so that their members could be reincorporated into society. He argued that the issues that had caused them to rise up in armed struggle had been or were being resolved.

The FMLN demanded for ARENA to be banned from participating in the political life of the country, which made the dialogue between the two sides difficult. During 1985, Duarte tried to improve the image of the state by banning the Salvadoran Air Force from bombing civilian areas without presidential permission, creating an Investigative Commission to investigate political assassinations, and prosecuting the right-wing death squads that were alleged to be embedded in the state security services. However, that attempt largely failed to influence the excesses of the death squads.

On 31 March, in the 1985 congressional elections, the PDC gained a majority with 33 seats. ARENA&#x27;s loss of control in the Congress enabled Duarte to achieve his goals more easily. On 10 September 1985, his daughter, Inés Guadalupe Duarte Durán, and her friend, Ana Cecilia Villeda, arrived by car at the gates of a private university in San Salvador. They were followed in a van by two bodyguards assigned to protect them. As the two vehicles came to a stop, other vehicles positioned themselves to block traffic while a number of armed individuals killed the bodyguards and forced the two women into a truck. The two women were taken to a guerrilla camp.

Four days after the incident, the self-styled Pedro Pablo Castillo commando of the FMLN publicly announced that it had been responsible for the abduction of the women. In spite of angering the military, Duarte&#x27;s family was sent to the United States for its safety, and he began the negotiations for the release of Inés Duarte and Ana Cecilia Villeda.
On 24 October, after several weeks of negotiations in which the Salvadoran church and diplomats from the region acted as mediators in secret talks, Inés Duarte and her friend were released in exchange for 22 political prisoners. The operation also included the release of 25 mayors and local officials abducted by FMLN in exchange for 101 war wounded guerrillas, whom the government allowed to leave the country. The entire process of exchanging prisoners, which took place in various parts of the country, was carried out through the International Committee of the Red Cross.

In a communiqué from the FMLN General Command broadcast by Radio Venceremos on the day Inés Duarte was released, the General Command assumed full responsibility for the operation and described the actions of the commando, including the killing of the bodyguards, as &quot;impeccable&quot;. The abduction of Inés Duarte and Ana Cecilia Villeda was widely denounced as a violation of international law.

In 1986, Duarte&#x27;s tax reform plans, bitterly opposed by ARENA, were judged unconstitutional. In August, he participated in the historic Esquipulas II agreement with other leaders to lay the groundwork for a firm and lasting peace in Central America by outlining the demobilization of the guerrilla groups in El Salvador, Guatemala, and Nicaragua. On 5 October 1987, a third dialogue began between the government and the FMLN, and on 28 October, Congress passed an amnesty law, just two days after Herbert Anaya, the president of the special United Nations Human Rights Commission for El Salvador, had been assassinated. Anaya&#x27;s assassination was interpreted by some as a sign of disapproval of the peace process.
Duarte was criticized by the Organization of American States, which demanded a full investigation into Anaya&#x27;s death. As a result, Duarte offered a reward of $10,000 and asked the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights to investigate. The National police arrested a suspect Jorge Alberto Miranda Arevalo, who confessed that he had acted as a lookout for the gang. He said that he was a member of one of the guerrillas groups, &quot;the ERP.&quot; He was judged and sentenced to 30 years in prison.

Duarte was increasingly seen as powerless not only between the two opposing forces of left and right but also in terms of the US anticommunist political influence in the region. With corruption scandals, an economy in tatters, rumors of a right-wing coup, and a civil war that did not appear to have a solution, the government became ineffective, unstable, and unable to stop the indiscriminate violence and brutality. In the 20 March 1988 elections, the PDC were soundly beaten by ARENA in a fair election.

In June 1988, Duarte was rushed to a military hospital in Washington, DC, where he was diagnosed with advanced stomach cancer and given between 6 months to a year to live. Both the diagnosis and the prognosis became public knowledge. In spite of having to stay in the United States for surgery and chemotherapy, he refused to resign as president, and he handed power over constitutionally to Alfredo Cristiani in June 1989. He died at 64 in San Salvador on 23 February 1990.

==&quot;Duarte: My Story&quot;==
In his autobiography, Duarte wrote: &quot;When the structures and values of Salvadoran society exemplify a democratic system, then the revolution I have worked for will have taken place. This is my dream&quot;.

<doc id="744703" wikidata="Q378943" url="?curid=744703" title="Vitosha">
<text>Vitosha ( ), the ancient &quot;Scomius&quot; or &quot;Scombrus&quot;, is a mountain massif, on the outskirts of Sofia, the capital of Bulgaria. Vitosha is one of the symbols of Sofia and the closest site for hiking, alpinism and skiing. Convenient bus lines and rope ways render the mountain easily accessible. Vitosha has the outlines of an enormous dome. 

The territory of the mountain includes Vitosha nature park that encompasses the best known and most frequently visited parts. The foothills of Vitosha shelter resort quarters of Sofia; Knyazhevo quarter has mineral springs. Vitosha is the oldest nature park in the Balkans.

The mountain emerged as a result of volcanic activity and has been subsequently shaped by the slow folding of the granite rock layers and a series of gradual uplifts of the area. It appears dome shaped at first sight, but the mountain, 19 km long by 17 km wide, actually consists of concentric denudational plateaus rising in tiers one above the other. Vitosha is separated into four main parts whose main ridges gather at a crown known as &quot;Cherni Vrah&quot; (&#x27;Black Peak&#x27;, Bulgarian: ). This is the highest point of the mountain at 2290 m and is one of 12 peaks of Vitosha over 2000 m in height. It is the highest massif of Srednogorie mountain chain system, together with Sredna gora, Plana (mountain), Lyulin Mountain, Greben (mountain), Viskyar Mountain, etc. They all are a result of the folding of the earth layers through the Mesozoic, causing also magma sheet-like intrusion (or concordant pluton) that has been injected between layers of sedimentary rock. The laccolithic domed form of Vitosha is a typical example.

Bulgaria&#x27;s longest cave – Duhlata, with a total length of 18,200 m, is situated in Vitosha in the karstic region near the village of Bosnek.

Since the ancient times of the Thracians a large population has always existed at the base of Vitosha. For the last four thousand years the economy of this large settlement has always been connected, in one way or another, with the neighboring mountain. The name Vitosha comes from the two-peaked, twin ridge mountain, which rises above the Sofia field and has acquired its present shape in stages over many millennia.

A meteorological station was built at the top in 1935, and is still operating. The station also serves as a rest shelter for hikers and is the headquarters for the mountain rescue team. Historical documents show that several centuries ago Vitosha mountain was still covered by the remains of the inaccessible &quot;Great Bulgarian Forest&quot; (&quot;Magna Silva Bulgarica&quot;). Today, the natural coniferous forests of Vitosha remain only in the reserve Bistrishko Branishte and around Zlatnite Mostove (The Golden Bridges). The Golden Bridges is a stone river consisting of a ribbon of huge boulders running down the mountainside. This scenic spot is located along the Vladayska River in an area of mixed deciduous and evergreen forest. However, this is only one of the stone rivers found in Vitosha and they were once the moraines of ancient glaciers. Their further formation occurred due to the spherical erosion of the sienite rocks and their gradual movement to down stream valleys by the forces of gravity and moving water.

At a time when nature conservation ideas were a long way from the present understanding, some enlightened noblemen took the first step in 1934 by declaring 66 km² of Vitosha a nature park, hence Vitosha became the first park of this kind in the Balkans. During the following year, some of the early Bulgarian reserves, Bistrishko Branishte (subsequently expanded to 10.61 km²) and Torfeno Branishte (7.84 km² respectively), were designated within its boundaries. The park boundaries fluctuated over many years and today it encompasses the entire mountain; an area of 266.06 km².
== Ecology ==
Due to a great variability in elevation, a rich diversity of climates, flora and fauna can be found within the park. Research has revealed that on the comparatively small area of the mountain there are 1,500 species of higher plants, 500 species of fungi, 500 species of algae, 326 species of mosses, and 200 species of lichens.

The forests are mainly composed of Norway spruce and Bulgarian fir, with some Macedonian pine, Scots pine, and at the tree-line, mountain pine, and mixed deciduous forest at lower altitudes, mainly beech, birch, aspen and alder. Regarding herbaceous plants, well-established populations of &quot;Veratrum album&quot; are present on the mountain, as well as other species commonly called &#x27;lilies&#x27;. There are also orchids, such as the East European green-winged orchid (&quot;Orchis morio&quot;) that grows in the higher parts. Lungwort (&quot;Pulmonaria officinalis&quot;) is another widespread herbaceous plant on Vitosha; it develops in dank sites under the shade of the forest.


== Honours ==
Vitosha Saddle, Rezen Knoll, Komini Peak, and Kikish Crag on Livingston Island in the South Shetland Islands, Antarctica are named respectively for Mount Vitosha, and for the Vitosha peaks of Malak Rezen and Golyam Rezen, Kominite Peak, and Kikish site.
Vitosha is also the name of:
* Radio Vitosha
* Vitosha Boulevard - a popular main street in Sofia; with shops, boutiques and restaurants.

<text>Arch Colson Chipp Whitehead (born November 6, 1969) is an American novelist. He is the author of nine novels, including his 1999 debut &quot;The Intuitionist&quot;; &quot;The Underground Railroad&quot; (2016), for which he won the 2016 National Book Award for Fiction and the 2017 Pulitzer Prize for Fiction; and &quot;The Nickel Boys&quot;, for which he won the Pulitzer Prize for Fiction again in 2020, making him one of only four writers ever to win the prize twice. He has also published two books of nonfiction. In 2002, he received a MacArthur Fellowship.

==Early life==
Whitehead was born in New York City on November 6, 1969, and grew up in Manhattan. He is one of four children of successful entrepreneur parents who owned an executive recruiting firm. As a child in Manhattan, Whitehead went by his first name Arch. He later switched to Chipp, before switching to Colson. He attended Trinity School in Manhattan and graduated from Harvard University in 1991. In college, he became friends with poet Kevin Young.

== Career ==
After graduating from college, Whitehead wrote for &quot;The Village Voice&quot;. While working at the &quot;Voice&quot;, he began drafting his first novels.

Early in his career, Whitehead lived in Fort Greene, Brooklyn.

Whitehead has since produced 11 book-length works—nine novels and two nonfiction works, including a meditation on life in Manhattan in the style of E. B. White&#x27;s famous 1949 essay &quot;Here Is New York&quot;. Whitehead&#x27;s books are &quot;The Intuitionist&quot; (1999); &quot;John Henry Days&quot; (2001); &quot;The Colossus of New York&quot; (2003); &quot;Apex Hides the Hurt&quot; (2006); &quot;Sag Harbor&quot; (2009); 2011&#x27;s &quot;Zone One&quot;, a &quot;New York Times&quot; bestseller; 2016&#x27;s &quot;The Underground Railroad&quot;, which earned a National Book Award for Fiction; &quot;The Nickel Boys&quot; (2019); &quot;Harlem Shuffle&quot; (2021); and &quot;Crook Manifesto&quot; (2023). &quot;Esquire&quot; magazine named &quot;The Intuitionist&quot; the best first novel of the year, and &quot;GQ&quot; called it one of the &quot;novels of the millennium&quot;. Novelist John Updike, reviewing &quot;The Intuitionist&quot; in &quot;The New Yorker&quot;, called Whitehead &quot;ambitious&quot;, &quot;scintillating&quot;, and &quot;strikingly original&quot;, adding: &quot;The young African-American writer to watch may well be a thirty-one-year-old Harvard graduate with the vivid name of Colson Whitehead.&quot;

&quot;The Intuitionist&quot; was nominated as the Common Novel at Rochester Institute of Technology (RIT). The Common Novel nomination was part of a longtime tradition at the Institute that included such authors as Maya Angelou, Andre Dubus III, William Joseph Kennedy, and Anthony Swofford.

Whitehead&#x27;s nonfiction, essays, and reviews have appeared in numerous publications, including &quot;The New York Times&quot;, &quot;The New Yorker&quot;, &quot;Granta&quot;, and &quot;Harper&#x27;s&quot;.

His nonfiction account of the 2011 World Series of Poker, &quot;The Noble Hustle: Poker, Beef Jerky &amp; Death&quot;, was published by Doubleday in 2014.

Whitehead has taught at Princeton University, New York University, the University of Houston, Columbia University, Brooklyn College, Hunter College, and Wesleyan University. He has been a writer-in-residence at Vassar College, the University of Richmond, and the University of Wyoming.

In 2015, he joined &quot;The New York Times Magazine&quot; to write a column on language.

&quot;The Underground Railroad&quot; was a selection of Oprah&#x27;s Book Club 2.0, and was chosen by President Barack Obama as one of five books on his summer vacation reading list. In 2017, the novel was awarded the Carnegie Medal for Excellence in Fiction at the American Library Association Mid-Winter Conference in Atlanta, Georgia. Colson was honored with the 2017 Hurston/Wright Award for fiction presented by the Zora Neale Hurston/Richard Wright Foundation. &quot;The Underground Railroad&quot; won the 2017 Pulitzer Prize for Fiction. Judges of the prize called the novel &quot;a smart melding of realism and allegory that combines the violence of slavery and the drama of escape in a myth that speaks to contemporary America&quot;.

Whitehead&#x27;s seventh novel, &quot;The Nickel Boys&quot;, was published in 2019. It was inspired by the story of the Dozier School for Boys in Florida, where children convicted of minor offenses suffered violent abuse. In conjunction with its publication, Whitehead was featured on the cover &quot;Time&quot; magazine&#x27;s July 8, 2019, edition, alongside the strap-line &quot;America&#x27;s Storyteller&quot;. &quot;The Nickel Boys&quot; won the 2020 Pulitzer Prize for Fiction. Judges of the prize called the novel &quot;a spare and devastating exploration of abuse at a reform school in Jim Crow-era Florida that is ultimately a powerful tale of human perseverance, dignity and redemption&quot;. It was Whitehead&#x27;s second win, making him the fourth writer to win the prize twice. In 2022, it was announced that Whitehead will executive produce the upcoming film adaptation of the same name.

Whitehead&#x27;s eighth novel, &quot;Harlem Shuffle&quot;, was conceived and begun before he wrote &quot;The Nickel Boys&quot;. It is a work of crime fiction set in Harlem during the 1960s. Whitehead spent years writing it, and finished it in &quot;bite-sized chunks&quot; during the months he spent in quarantine in New York City during the COVID-19 pandemic. &quot;Harlem Shuffle&quot; was published by Doubleday on September 14, 2021. &quot;Crook Manifesto&quot;, Whitehead&#x27;s ninth novel and a follow-up to &quot;Harlem Shuffle&quot;, was published on July 18, 2023.

<text>John Langalibalele Dube OLG (22 February 1871 – 11 February 1946) was a South African essayist, philosopher, educator, politician, publisher, editor, novelist and poet. He was the founding president of the South African Native National Congress (SANNC), which became the African National Congress in 1923. He was an uncle to Dr Pixley ka Isaka Seme, with whom he founded SANNC. Dube served as the president of SANNC between 1912 and 1917. He was brought to America by returning missionaries and attended Oberlin Preparatory Academy. 

He returned to South Africa, where in 1901 he and his first wife, Nokutela Dube, founded the Ohlange High School based on the Tuskegee Institute founded by Booker T. Washington. In 1903, the Dubes founded the isiZulu newspaper &quot;Ilanga&quot; (now &quot;Ilanga lase Natal&quot;). In 1930, John Dube published &quot;Shaka&#x27;s Body Servant&quot;. He died in 1946.

== Early life ==

John Langalibalele Dube was born in Natal at the Inanda mission station of the American Zulu Mission (AZM), a branch of the American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions, whose Southern African mission churches later merged with sister Congregational mission churches of the London Missionary Society and Congregational Union of South Africa to form the United Congregational Church of Southern Africa (UCCSA). His father, the Reverend James Dube, was one of the first ordained African pastors of the AZM. Dube began his formal education in Inanda and Adams College, Amanzimtoti. The Reverend William Cullen Wilcox was called in to talk to Dube, who was misbehaving at the Adams School. His father James Dube was then the Congregational minister at Inanda. 

In 1887, the Wilcox family were returning to the United States and John Dube and his mother persuaded the missionary couple to take Dube to America, where he could further his education. The Cullens agreed, on the condition that Dube was to maintain himself financially; however, they advised him, and William found him his first work on the road gang when he arrived in America. In late 1888, Dube enrolled at Oberlin Academy Preparatory School and, although he studied printing and self-help, he did not graduate.

In 1893, he returned to Inanda, where in January 1894 he married Nokutela Mdima.

==Statesman==
For a missionary-educated person, there was conflict between the newly arrived Western education and African traditional society. However, Dube navigated this social schism with a statesman-like ability, as in his later years, when he was able to win the trust of the Zulu royal family. It is conceivable that Dube would never have been part of the SANC, except that his teaching and discourse on the necessity of unity chimed in with the then-nascent political atmosphere. 

Dube&#x27;s speeches as president of a black political mass-movement have never been made available. The next formation of black people into a coherent socio-political movement was to come into being with Marcus Garvey&#x27;s Universal Negro Improvement Association and African Communities League, founded in 1914. In his politics Dube was cautious and conservative, yet he was forthright on the rights of blacks and the paramount tenet of unity – he foresaw the necessity of the unity of black people long before Garvey came to the international scene.

==Educator==
Dube was also an educator, a speaker of note on the circuit engaging whites in lectures around the country. In 1901, he and his first wife, Nokutela Dube, founded the Zulu Christian Industrial School which is now the Ohlange High School at Ohlange, near Phoenix and EkuPhakameni. This was the first educational institution in South Africa to be founded by black people.

He gave lecturers by invitation and he was awarded a Doctorate of Philosophy as a result. His role as an educator has been less documented, but he held and proposed views on education and culture that were to be used in inimical ways by the Apartheid government when it came into power in 1948 and legislating the Bantu Education Act. Dube had identified the need to combine Western education with local customs and traditions, all grounded in broad African communal behaviour. His theories on education are found in both &quot;Ukuziphatha&quot; and &quot;Isita&quot;.

==Man of letters==

He was among the pioneering men of letters who helped to establish Zulu literature. He was one of the first published Zulu authors, although the first published Zulu book was written by Magema Fuze, whose history of the Zulus, &quot;Abantu abamnyama lapo bavela ngakona&quot; (translated as &quot;The Black People and From Whence They Came&quot;), was published in 1922, having been written in the 1880s and early 1890s. 

Dube&#x27;s first published work was an essay in English on self-improvement and public decency that was published in 1910. The work that was to earn him the honorary doctorate of philosophy was the 1992 essay &quot;Umuntu Isita Sake Uqobo Lwake&quot; (&quot;A man is his own worst enemy&quot;; text in pre-1936 Zulu old orthography). He went on to publish, in 1930, a historical novella that has proven to be popular and influential in Zulu canon titled &quot;Insila kaShaka&quot; (&quot;Shaka&#x27;s Body Servant&quot;).

He embarked on writing biographies of the Zulu royal family, especially that of King Dinizulu, making him the first biographer in African literature. There are numerous other works of less significant literary quality such as the 1910 essay &quot;Ukuziphatha&quot; (&quot;On Behaviour&quot;).

In addition to his literary works, Dube and his wife founded the first Zulu/English newspaper, &quot;Ilanga laseNatali&quot; (&quot;The Sun of Natal&quot;), in 1903, a publication that in 2003 celebrated its centenary. &quot;Ilanga laseNatali&quot; is no longer independent since being bought by the then proto-political association &quot;Inkatha yeNkululelo yeSizwe&quot; in 1988, led by Mangosuthu Buthelezi, later to be known as a political party in post-apartheid South Africa called Inkatha Freedom Party (IFP). 

Dube and his first wife, Nokutela Dube, are credited with popularizing the Enoch Sontonga song &quot;Nkosi Sikelel&#x27; iAfrika&quot;. This later became a national anthem after Ohlange Institute&#x27;s choir used it. They played it at the South African Native National Congress meeting in 1912. It was sung after the closing prayer and the ANC adopted it as its official closing anthem in 1925.

==Influenced by Booker T. Washington==
Dube had experienced first-hand the influence of Booker T. Washington in his travels to the US to expand his education in early 1890. He and his wife founded the Ohlange High School in 1901, a school dedicated to teaching Bantu women modern ways to be liberated and find a place in modern society. In his &quot;Ukuziphatha&quot; Dube had identified the Bantu woman as the weakness in developing Bantu society because of the society&#x27;s restrictions on education for women and what he identified as woman&#x27;s propensity to ephemera. Dube was particularly influenced by reading Washington&#x27;s &quot;Up From Slavery&quot; (1901), a book on self-reliance, the gospel that was taught by the American sage Ralph Waldo Emerson. Washington&#x27;s book proved immensely influential in Bantu thought and across the black world. It was subsequently translated into several Bantu languages in South Africa, but Dube never chose to translate it, instead putting its teachings into practice. This was a feat that was never duplicated, except by Garvey and his movement and, on a minor scale, by the political figure Steve Biko in his hometown of King William&#x27;s Town in the province of the Eastern Cape. Dube had been inspired by Washington&#x27;s Tuskegee Institute; years later Marcus Garvey attempted to see Washington because of a similar inspiration, though he arrived in the US in 1916, Washington had died the previous year. Dube&#x27;s school is still functioning today. Dube was a firm believer in self-reliance, both as an ethical and spiritual quest towards realisation of dignity and respect in the eyes of others. In &quot;Isita&quot;, he preached self-reliance and the need for black people to initiate economic ventures to gain respect in the eyes of the world.

Nokutela and John Dube&#x27;s organisation success was not matched in their marriage. Their failure to have children was seen to reflect badly on Nokutela and John fathered a child with one of their pupils. A committee was set up to investigate John, but they took no action and Nokutela felt humiliated. The couple separated in about 1914, and Nokutela moved to the Transvaal until she became ill with kidney disease. She returned to live with John Dube in Johannesburg, and died in 1917 at the age of 44. Her funeral was attended by Pixley ka Isaka Seme and other prominent members of what was to become the African National Congress.

<text>Quilmes () is a city on the coast of the Rio de la Plata, in the , on the southeast end of the Greater Buenos Aires, being some away from the urban centre area of Buenos Aires. The city was founded in 1666 and is the seat of the eponymous &quot;partido&quot; (district).

==History==
The &quot;Quilmes&quot; were a native tribe who lived in the surroundings of Tucumán. In the 17th century, after repeated attempts by the Spanish invaders to control their lands, the Quilmes were defeated and were forced to settle in a restricted colony (&quot;reducción&quot;) near Buenos Aires, where the authorities could control them. The settlement was thus established in 1666 as &quot;Exaltación de la Santa Cruz de los Kilme&quot;. The journey from Tucumán was made on foot, causing hundreds of Quilmes to die in the process. The colony had been abandoned by 1810 and had become a ghost town. The land was divided in parcels and the town of Quilmes was established in 1818, which would later flourish during the wave of immigration in late 19th-century Argentina. 

During the first British invasion, lasting 46 days in 1806, the British arrived from Montevideo through Quilmes and went to Buenos Aires from there before being defeated and expelled.
Quilmes was also inhabited by British immigrants. Juan Clark, born in Yorkshire, England, was president of the municipality in 1855. The Clark&#x27; were owners of land in Quilmes, and were linked to the Irish and Scottish community, established in the area since 1830s.

In 1898 was established in the area the St. George&#x27;s College, a private educational institution run by the Reverend Joseph Thomas Stevenson.

The town&#x27;s development accelerated during the wave of immigration in Argentina during the late 19th century, and Quilmes was considered as the location for a new provincial capital during the Federalization of Buenos Aires of 1880 (ultimately established in La Plata). The Argentine Air Force established a 220 ha (540 acre) base in East Quilmes in 1943. In 1944, Impa (Industria Metallurgica y Plastica Argentina) opened Argentina&#x27;s first airplane plant at Quilmes. Impa had been blacklisted by the United States government due to its connections to Nazi-occupied Austria and fascist figures within Argentina itself. The airplanes were considered of &quot;antiquated design&quot; according to the New York Times.

Quilmes proper consists of two main parts, east and west, which are divided by the tracks of the Metropolitano passenger train line. East Quilmes has several relatively wealthy areas and a large shopping district. As one travels east toward the Río de la Plata, neighborhoods become increasingly poor, and two large &quot;villas miseria&quot; (slums) are found close to the river. These areas often experience severe flooding.

Quilmes is the home of two football teams: Quilmes Atlético Club and Club Atlético Argentino de Quilmes. The first was founded in the 19th century by Cannon J. T. Stevenson, and the second one was founded later, by Argentines who were not allowed to play for the QAC. They are two of the oldest Argentine football teams. The city has been chosen by FIH to host the 2014 Men&#x27;s Hockey Champions Trophy.

The city also gives its name to the &quot;Cerveza Quilmes&quot; beer company, as this is where it was first brewed in 1888 where the brewery was started by Otto Bemberg; the establishment remains a leading employer in the city. Other significant manufacturers in Quilmes include textile maker La Bernalesa, glass maker Cattorini, construction materials maker Cerámica Quilmes, and climate control equipment maker Rheem.

<text>David Dubinsky (; born David Isaac Dobnievski; February 22, 1892 – September 17, 1982) was a Belarusian-born American labor leader and politician. He served as president of the International Ladies Garment Workers Union (ILGWU) between 1932 and 1966, took part in the creation of the CIO, and was one of the founders of the American Labor Party and the Liberal Party of New York.

==Early life and career in Russia==

David Isaac Dobnievski was born February 22, 1892, in Brest, in what was then the Russian Empire (and is now Belarus), as the youngest of five boys and three girls. Dubinsky and his family moved to Łódź, Poland, shortly before he turned three. David&#x27;s father, Bezalel Dobnievski, a religious Jew, owned a bakery, but limited himself to administrative tasks related to the enterprise. David&#x27;s mother Shaina Wyshengrad died when he was eight, with his father remarrying a year and a half later. David worked from early childhood delivering bread from his father&#x27;s bakery to local shops, while attending a Hebrew school, where he studied Polish, Russian, and Yiddish. He was later forced to leave a semi-private school he attended to take work in his father&#x27;s bakery to replace a brother who had left abruptly.

=== Early union activity, arrest, and emigration to United States ===
During the 1905 Russian Revolution, Dubinsky attended a mass meeting which led to his kinship, if not actual membership, with the General Jewish Labor Bund, a Jewish socialist labor organization. He joined the bakers&#x27; union, which was controlled by the Bund, and owing to his superior education and fluency in several languages, was elected assistant secretary within the union by 1906. By age 15, he was leader of the local labor union.

In 1906 or 1907, Dubinsky was arrested by the Okhrana, and was held for 18 months in prison before being sentenced to hard labor in Chelyabinsk, Siberia upon reaching the age of 16. On the way to Chelyabinsk, however, he escaped containment and fled to the United States, landing in New York City in 1911, at the age of 19.

==Early career in the United States==

===Joining the ILGWU===

When Dubinsky came to the United States in 1911, he began by working as a dishwasher. He quickly rose to become a sewing machine operator, but ignored requests from relatives that he pursue a career in the medical industry, and did not join his brother as a baker. Instead of these tasks, Dubinsky continued in the garments trade alongside tens of thousands of other Jewish workers, and became a member of Local 10, the ILGWU&#x27;s cutter&#x27;s union.

Within the ILGWU, Dubinsky&#x27;s rise was swift, and he became president and general manager of Local 10 by 1921. The next year, he became a member of the ILGWU&#x27;s General Executive Board, before becoming General Secretary-Treasurer in 1929.

===Battles with the left===
Shortly after Dubinsky was elected to the International Executive Board Benjamin Schlesinger, the International&#x27;s president, resigned. Dubinsky campaigned hard for election of Morris Sigman, a former Industrial Workers of the World (IWW) member who took office in 1923. Sigman began to remove Communist Party USA members from leadership of locals in New York, Chicago, Philadelphia and Boston. Dubinsky supported Sigman&#x27;s campaign.

Sigman could not, however, regain control of the New York locals, including Dressmakers&#x27; Local 22 and Cloak Finishers Local 9, where the Communist Party leadership and their left wing allies, some anarchists and some socialists, enjoyed strong support of the membership. Dubinsky, by his own account, thought that Sigman was too rash and appears to have urged him to call a truce after the left wing-led unions led a campaign to reject a proposed agreement that Sigman had negotiated with the industry in 1925, bringing more than 30,000 members to a rally at Yankee Stadium to call for a one-day stoppage on August 10, 1925.

The left wing won control of the New York Joint Board, the body that coordinated the activities of all of the New York City ILGWU locals in all aspects of the industry, that year. When it called a general strike on July 1, 1926, Dubinsky was given a nominal role in the strike, reflecting his power base in the cutters&#x27; union, but was largely sidelined. That strike was a disastrous failure, leading to the rout of leftist leadership from the Joint Board and ultimately from the industry, other than the independent International Fur Workers Union.

== Leadership of the ILGWU ==

=== Rise to power ===

Dubinsky was somewhat disenchanted with Sigman&#x27;s leadership by this point; while he was a wholehearted supporter of Sigman&#x27;s attack on the Communist influence within the union, he thought that Sigman was too abrasive, alienating the right wing almost reflexively, given his dislike of &quot;union bureaucrats&quot; gained through his years in the Industrial Workers of the World (IWW). At the 1928 convention of the ILGWU he first proposed that Sigman resign in favor of Schlesinger – a suggestion seen by many as part of a plan by Dubinsky to become the eventual head of the union. Dubinsky denied any personal ambitions and rebuffed a proposal from Abraham Cahan of &quot;The Forward&quot; to promote him as Sigman&#x27;s heir apparent.

When Morris Hillquit, the union&#x27;s long-time counsel, advanced a proposal to create a new position of Executive Vice-president, which Schlesinger would hold, giving up his position as General Manager of the &quot;Forward&quot;, Sigman agreed. Five months later, after the union&#x27;s executive board rejected an attempt by Sigman to merge two unions, Sigman resigned and Schlesinger returned to office.

By that point, however, the union was in a shambles, still struggling with the huge debts acquired during the failed strike, fighting expelled local leaders, some of whom had taken their unions out of the ILG, and facing an even more disorganized and piratical industry. Dubinsky set out to rebuild the ILGWU&#x27;s base in New York City by striking a deal with the major manufacturers&#x27; group in 1929 that provided no pay raises but made it possible for the union to police the contract by cracking down on subcontractors who &quot;chiseled&quot;, cheating workers out of pay or hours in order to gain a competitive advantage. The Communist Party USA opposed the new agreement but was by that time too weak to muster any effective resistance to Dubinsky.

Dubinsky was elected Secretary-Treasurer of the ILGWU at the end of 1929. He was elected president after Schlesinger died in 1932, retaining the position of Secretary-Treasurer in order to avoid the sort of internecine battles that previous officers had waged in the past. He held the Presidency until 1966, while remaining Secretary-Treasurer until 1959.

Dubinsky proved to be far more durable than his predecessors. He did not brook dissent within the union and insisted that every employee of the International first submit an undated letter of resignation, to be used should Dubinsky choose to fire him later. He also acquired the power to appoint key officers throughout the union. As he explained his position at one of the union&#x27;s conventions: &quot;We have a democratic union – but they know who&#x27;s boss.&quot;

Under his leadership the union, more than three fourths of whose members were women, continued to be led almost exclusively by men. Rose Pesotta, a longtime ILGWU activist and organizer, complained to Dubinsky that she had the same uncomfortable feeling of being the token woman on the ILGWU&#x27;s executive board that Dubinsky had complained about when he was the only Jew on the AFL&#x27;s board. The union did not, however, make any significant efforts to bring women into leadership positions during Dubinsky&#x27;s tenure.

===Organizing during the Great Depression===
As weak as the ILGWU was in the aftermath of the 1926 strike, it was nearly destroyed by the Great Depression. Its dues-paying membership slipped to 25,000 in 1932 as unionized garment shops shut, abandoned unions, or stopped abiding by their union contracts.

The union recovered, however, after the election of Franklin D. Roosevelt and the passage of the National Industrial Recovery Act, which promised to protect workers&#x27; right to organize. As in the case in other industries with a history of organizing, that promise alone was enough to bring thousands of workers who had never been union members in the past to the union; when the union called a strike of dressmakers in New York on August 16, 1933, more than 70,000 workers joined in it – twice the number that the union had hoped for. It did not hurt, moreover, that the local leader of the NRA was quoted as saying – without any basis in fact – that President Roosevelt had authorized the strike. The union rebounded to more than 200,000 members by 1934, increasing to roughly 300,000 by the end of the Depression.

As one of the few industrial unions within the AFL, the ILGWU was eager to advance the cause of organizing employees in the steel, automobile and other mass production industries that employed millions of workers, many of them immigrants or children of immigrants, at low wages. The ILGWU was one of the original members of the Committee for Industrial Organization, the group that John L. Lewis of the United Mine Workers formed within the AFL in 1935 to organize industrial workers, and provided key financial support and assistance; Rose Pesotta played a key role in early organizing drives in the rubber and steel industries.

Dubinsky was unwilling, on the other hand, to split the AFL into two competing federations and did not follow Lewis and the Amalgamated Clothing Workers of America (ACWA) when they formed the Congress of Industrial Organizations as a rival to, rather than a part of, the AFL. Dubinsky also had personality differences with Lewis, whom he resented as high-handed.

In addition, Dubinsky was alarmed by the presence of Communist Party members on the payroll of the CIO and the fledgling unions it had sponsored. Dubinsky was opposed to any form of collaboration with communists and had offered financial support to Homer Martin, the controversial president of the United Auto Workers, who was being advised by Jay Lovestone, a former leader of the Communist Party turned anti-communist. Lewis, by contrast, was unconcerned with the number of communists working for the CIO; as he told Dubinsky, when asked about the communists on the staff of the United Steelworkers, &quot;Who gets the bird? The hunter or the dog?&quot;

The ILGWU began reducing its support for the CIO and, after a few years in which it attempted to be allies with both sides, reaffiliated with the AFL in 1940. Dubinsky regained his former positions as a vice president and member of the executive council of the AFL in 1945. He was the most visible supporter within the AFL of demands to clean house by ousting corrupt union leaders; the AFL-CIO ultimately adopted many of his demands when it established codes of conduct for its affiliates in 1957.

===Electoral politics===
Dubinsky and Sidney Hillman, leader of the ACWA, helped found the American Labor Party in 1936. At the time Dubinsky and Hillman were both nominal members of the Socialist Party, although Dubinsky had, by his own admission, allowed his membership to lapse during the factional fighting of the 1920s. The Labor Party served as a halfway house for socialists and other leftists who were willing to vote for liberal Democratic politicians such as Roosevelt or Governor Herbert Lehman of New York, but who were not prepared to join the Democratic Party itself.

The new party was subject to many of the same fissures that divided much of the left in the late 1930s. For a while after the signing of the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact, Communists within the ALP condemned Roosevelt as a warmonger because of his support for Britain. At one particularly stormy meeting Dubinsky and the other leaders were only able to hold their vote endorsing Roosevelt after moving from room to room and calling the police to arrest those who had disrupted the meeting.

Dubinsky ultimately left the ALP in 1944 after a dispute with Hillman over whether labor leaders in New York, such as Mike Quill, who either were members of the Communist Party or were seen as sympathetic to it, should be given any role in the ALP. When Hillman prevailed, Dubinsky and his allies left to form the Liberal Party of New York. The ALP went on to endorse Henry Wallace in the 1948 presidential election, while the ILGWU campaigned energetically for Harry S. Truman, nearly bringing New York State into his column, despite it being the home state of the Republican nominee, Governor Thomas Dewey.

Dubinsky had hopes of launching a national liberal party, headed by Wendell Willkie, the Republican candidate for president in 1940 who had soured on the Republican Party after his defeat in the primaries in 1944. He proposed that Willkie begin by running for Mayor of New York City in 1945; Willkie, however, died before the plan could get off the ground.

Dubinsky and the ILGWU played an active role in the Liberal Party for most of the 1950s and up until his retirement in 1966. The ILGWU ended its support for the party after Dubinsky left office.

===Post-war changes in the industry and the union===

The union often saw itself, both before and during Dubinsky&#x27;s years at the head of the union, as the savior of the industry, eliminating the cutthroat competition over wages that had made it unstable while making workers&#x27; lives miserable. Dubinsky took pride in negotiating a contract in 1929 that contained no raises, but allowed the union to crack down on subcontractors who &quot;chiselled&quot;. Dubinsky even claimed to have once turned down an employer&#x27;s wage offer in negotiations as too costly to the employers, and therefore harmful to employees. Dubinsky summarized his attitude by saying that &quot;workers need capitalism the way a fish needs water.&quot;

Policing the industry became much harder, however, as gangsters invaded the garment district. Both the employers and the union had hired gangsters during the strikes of the 1920s. Some of them, such as Lepke Buchalter remained in the industry as labor racketeers who took over unions for the opportunities for raking off dues and extorting payoffs from employers with the threat of strikes. Some also became garment manufacturers themselves, driving away unions, other than those they controlled, by violence. While Dubinsky himself remained untouched by graft, a number of officers within the union were corrupted.

The industry changed greatly in the years after World War II; while it had once been concentrated in New York City and other eastern and Midwestern cities, with smaller outposts on the West Coast, the work done by formerly unionized shops fled to other parts of the US or abroad, where unions were non-existent and wages far lower. The ILGWU was unable to prevent these runaway shops or to organize workers at the new locations.

The union&#x27;s membership also changed greatly in the years after World War II; what once had been a predominantly Jewish and Italian workforce became largely Latino, African-American and Asian. The leadership of the union had less and less in common with its membership and very often had no experience in the trade itself.

In the last decade of Dubinsky&#x27;s tenure some of these new members began to rebel, protesting their exclusion from positions of power within the union. That rebellion failed: the established leadership had too strong a hold on the official structure of the union, in an industry in which members were scattered across a number of small shops and in which power was concentrated in the upper echelons of the union, rather than in the locals. Without the support of a mass movement that would have given the majority an effective voice, individual insurgents were either marginalized or coopted.

The union continued to expand its membership after World War II, reaching its apex at 500,000 members in 1965, one year before Dubinsky&#x27;s retirement. Dubinsky&#x27;s focus on maintaining the stability of the industry and the union&#x27;s place in it dampened the union&#x27;s desire to gain significant wage increases for its members. The union gradually lost its ability to keep sweatshop conditions from returning, even in the former center of its strength in New York. While the union still had one-half million members in the years immediately after Dubinsky&#x27;s retirement, the forces that brought about the decline and eventual disappearance of the ILGWU thirty years later, when it merged with the ACWA to form the union known as the Union of Needletrades, Industrial and Textile Employees (UNITE), were already at work. In his last years, Dubinsky was often accessible to the union&#x27;s members.

== Retirement, death, and legacy ==

On March 17, 1966, Dubinsky resigned as leader of the ILGWU at the age of 74. At the time of his retirement, he had led the ILGWU for 34 years. Nearly three years after his retirement, he received the Presidential Medal of Freedom on January 20, 1969, from President Richard Nixon. He died September 17, 1982, in New York City.

Dubinsky had a profound impact on the development of workers&#x27; rights, both in the garments industry and in general: among his achievements were the first garment industry pact for a 35-hour week, the first employer-contributed fund for worker vacations, affordable housing for workers, and initiatives in workers&#x27; health and training.

<doc id="744739" wikidata="Q2524533" url="?curid=744739" title="Paul Dubois (sculptor)">
<text>Paul Dubois (; 18 July 1829 – 23 May 1905, also known by Dubois-Pigalle) was a French sculptor and painter from Nogent-sur-Seine. His works were mainly sculptures and statues, and he was also a portrait painter.

==Early life==
Paul Dubois was born on the 18 July 1829 in Nogent-sur-Seine, France. He began studying law to please his father who practiced as a notary, but gave this up in order to train as a sculptor; his enthusiasm for this possibly fanned by the admiration he had for the work of his great-uncle Jean-Baptiste Pigalle. When making his debut at the Paris Salon in 1857 he did so under the name Dubois-Pigalle.

==Career==
In 1858 he entered the atelier of Armand Toussaint at the École Nationale des Beaux-Arts. The following year he travelled to Rome, studying and copying the many great sculptures and mixed with the likes of Henri Chapu, Alexandre Falguière and Georges Bizet. As an artist he did not have to struggle with financial problems as his family supported all his studies. He stayed in Rome for 4 years and whilst in Rome he executed the works &quot;Saint Jean-Baptiste&quot; and &quot;Narcisse&quot; and, in 1863, was awarded &quot;une médaille de 2° classe&quot; by the Paris Salon for work sent to Paris from Rome. When he returned to France he completed the study of a young troubadour, &quot;Chanteur florentin du XVe siècle&quot;, a work which was to bring him such popular success.

In 1865 and 1876, he was awarded a &quot;médaille d&#x27;honneur&quot; at the Salon des beaux-arts. In June 1867 he was named Chevalier (Knight) of the Légion d&#x27;honneur; in July 1874 he was named Officer of the Légion d&#x27;honneur; in July 1886 he was promoted to Commander of the Légion d&#x27;honneur; and in 1889 he was decorated with the Grand Croix (Grand Cross) of the Légion d&#x27;honneur.

His success was not limited to sculpture and as a painter he was in much demand for portraits and after 1870 he gave as much time and effort to his painting as to his sculpture. He also taught at the Académie Julian. Dubois died from pneumonia in 1905.

==Main works==
==Le musée Camille Claudel (ex Dubois-Boucher)==

This museum was established by Dubois and Alfred Boucher and holds information relating to Dubois.

<text>Olivos is a neighborhood in Vicente López Partido, Buenos Aires Province, Argentina. It is bordered to the south by Vicente López neighborhood and Florida; to the east by the River Plate; to the north by La Lucila and Martínez, and to the west by Munro.

Olivos is the municipal seat of Vicente López Partido, and it is also seat of the Argentina presidencial residence.

==History==

A well-known stop along the Buenos Aires-Córdoba trade route for much of the 18th century, one of the area&#x27;s first landowners, Domingo de Acassuso, began cultivating olive trees around 1720 and the spot was officially named &quot;Olivos&quot; (&quot;Olive Trees&quot;) on 19 February 1770. Much of the area was later purchased by Viceroy Antonio de Olaguer y Feliú and by a German immigrant, Hernán Wineberg, who sold a large tract in 1860 for the construction of the Ferrocarril Central Argentino through the area.

The 1863 inaugural of the local railway station, one of Argentina&#x27;s first, began attracting homeowners drawn by the area&#x27;s tranquility and convenient access to the rapidly growing capital and, in 1897, the Church of Jesus of the Olive Trees was consecrated. A 1905 edict subdivided San Isidro Partido in two, creating the modern Partido de Vicente López and designating Olivos as the seat.

Home to a growing upscale community by 1917, local businessman Rodolfo Negrete founded the city&#x27;s first clinic and marina and, during the 1920s, the small marina was modernized and the city&#x27;s streets paved. The opening of National Route 9 in the mid-1930s, west of the city, further accentuated the area&#x27;s draw as a convenient suburb for Buenos Aires commuters.

The city became the focus of national attention in 1941 when, upon the passing of Carlos Villate Olaguer (a great-great-grandson of Viceroy Olaguer y Feliú&#x27;s), a section of the family&#x27;s local land was deeded to the national government for use as the president&#x27;s official residence. Graced by a mansion of an eclectic, Italianate-inspired style, the main house was commissioned by Miguel José de Azcuénaga in 1851 and designed by renowned local artist and architect Prilidiano Pueyrredón. The complementing structures for the compound were built in variations on Baroque architecture.

The residence hosted the Olivos Pact, a political agreement signed on 14 November 1993 between then-President Carlos Menem and former President Raúl Alfonsín (head of the main opposition party, the centrist Radical Civic Union). The pact secured support for constitutional reforms allowing for the re-election of the President well as for the popular election of the Mayor of Buenos Aires, hitherto an appointed post. The Kheyvis nightclub fire of 20 December 1993 in Olivos was the deadliest such tragedy in Argentina up to that time. Olivos was selected as a stop along the Tren de la Costa tourist railway upon the line&#x27;s opening in 1995.

==Geography==
Olivos is located on the western bank of the Río de la Plata, the world&#x27;s widest river. The river is approximately wide at Olivos, and as such, Uruguay is not visible from ground level. However, Olivos (and this entire region of the Rio) do not have sandy beaches; the shoreline is relatively rocky. Comparable shorelines include those of the Great Lakes in North America. The city&#x27;s topography is relatively flat. However, there are some ridges by the river towards the north, in the &quot;La Lucila&quot; neighbourhood.

The city is located about north of Buenos Aires, of which it is effectively a suburb, and south of Rosario. Montevideo, capital of Uruguay is due east of Olivos, across the river.

===Climate===
Olivos has an oceanic climate (Cfb). The city has comfortably warm summers and cool winters. Temperatures are noticeably more moderate than in places further inland, or even in nearby Buenos Aires, due to the lack of an urban heat island. Rainfall is fairly consistent throughout the year.

<doc id="744764" wikidata="Q221941" url="?curid=744764" title="War of the Quadruple Alliance">
<text>The War of the Quadruple Alliance was fought from 1717 to 1720 by Spain and the Habsburg Monarchy, with the latter being joined in 1718 by Great Britain, France, and Savoy, and in 1719 by the Dutch Republic. Caused by Spanish attempts to recover territories in Italy ceded in the 1713 Peace of Utrecht, most of the fighting took place in Sicily and Spain, with minor engagements in North America. Spain also promoted the Jacobite rising of 1719 in Scotland in an effort to divert British naval resources.

Spain recaptured Sardinia in 1717 from Habsburg Austria, followed by a landing in Sicily in July 1718. On 2 August, the Quadruple Alliance was formed and on 11th, the Royal Navy defeated a Spanish fleet at Cape Passaro. This meant their troops in Sicily could not be resupplied or reinforced, and Austrian land forces eventually retook the island. In October 1719, a British naval force sacked the Spanish port of Vigo.

The 1720 Treaty of The Hague restored the position prior to 1717, with Savoy and Austria exchanging Sardinia and Sicily.

==Naming==
The war is named for the alliance signed between Austria and the Triple Alliance of Great Britain, France, and the Dutch Republic against Spain on 2 August 1718. Savoy entered the alliance on 8 November, despite fighting Spain in Sicily since 1 July. Inversely, the Dutch Republic did not declare war on Spain until August 1719.

==Background==
Under the 1713 Peace of Utrecht that ended the War of the Spanish Succession, Spain ceded possessions in Italy and Flanders to Austria, and Sicily to Savoy. Their recovery was a priority for the French-born Philip V of Spain. This objective was reinforced by chief minister Cardinal Alberoni, who like Philip&#x27;s second wife Elisabeth Farnese was a native of Parma.

Utrecht specified Spain could never be unified with either France or Austria, and under its terms Philip gave up any future claim to the French throne. However, a series of deaths in the French royal family between 1713 and 1715 made him heir presumptive to the five year old Louis XV, and he now cast doubts on this renunciation. Emperor Charles VI also refused to accept this principle, as well as delaying implementation of the Barrier Treaty in the newly acquired Austrian Netherlands, an objective for which the Dutch Republic had effectively bankrupted themselves. Concerned by these moves, Britain and France agreed the 1716 Anglo-French alliance to enforce these terms, then formed the Triple Alliance with the Dutch in January 1717.

Its key principles were to ensure Charles and Philip reconfirmed the withdrawal of their claims to the thrones of Spain and France. In return for this, Savoy and Austria would exchange Sicily and Sardinia. Spain saw little benefit in this and decided to seize the opportunity to recover territorial losses agreed at Utrecht. As neither Savoy nor Austria possessed significant navies, the most obvious targets were the islands of Sardinia and Sicily, an ambition that aligned with the Italian dynastic claims of Elizabeth Farnese.

==War==
===Outbreak===
In August 1717, Spanish forces landed on Sardinia and by November had re-established control of the island. They met little opposition; Austria was engaged in the 1716–1718 Austro-Turkish War, while France and the Netherlands needed peace to rebuild their shattered economies. Attempts to resolve the situation through diplomacy failed and in June 1718, a British naval force arrived in the Western Mediterranean as a preventive measure. Emboldened by their success in Sardinia, in July 1718 the Spanish landed 30,000 men on Sicily but the strategic position had now changed. Austria signed the July 1718 Treaty of Passarowitz with the Ottoman Empire, and on 2 August, joined Britain, France, and the Dutch in the Quadruple Alliance, which gave its name to the war.

The Spanish took Palermo on 7 July, then divided their army; on 18 July, the Marquess of Lede opened the siege of Messina, while the duke of Montemar occupied the rest of the island. On 11 August, a British squadron commanded by Sir George Byng eliminated the Spanish fleet at the Battle of Cape Passaro. This was followed in the autumn by the landing of a small Austrian army, assembled in Naples by the Austrian Viceroy Count Wirich Philipp von Daun, near Messina to lift the siege by the Spanish forces. The Austrians were defeated in the First Battle of Milazzo on 15 October, and only held a small bridgehead around Milazzo.

In 1718, Cardinal Alberoni began plotting to replace the Duc d&#x27;Orléans, regent to the 5-year-old King Louis XV of France, with Philip V. This plot became known as the Cellamare conspiracy. After the plot was discovered, Alberoni was expelled from France, which declared war on Spain. By 17 December 1718, the French, British, and Austrians had all officially entered the war against Spain. The Dutch would join them later, in August 1719.

===San Sebastián===

The Duc d&#x27;Orléans ordered a French army under the Duke of Berwick to invade the western Basque districts of Spain in April 1719, still under the shock of Philip V&#x27;s military intervention against them. Berwick successfully besieged San Sebastián and also entered northern Catalonia. In both regions there was support for the invaders from leading local figures, some of whom lobbied for them to be permanently annexed by France. Spain attempted to counter this by launching its own expedition to Brittany, in the hope of raising a rebellion against the Regent of France. It consisted of a 1,000 troops, but carried arms for 10,000 more. However, after landing at Vannes they found little support amongst the inhabitants and withdrew.

===Sicily===
In Sicily, the Austrians started a new offensive under Count Claude Florimond de Mercy. They first suffered a defeat in the Battle of Francavilla (20 June 1719). But the Spanish were cut off from their homeland by the British fleet and it was just a matter of time before their resistance would crumble. Mercy was then victorious in the second Battle of Milazzo, took Messina in October and besieged Palermo.

===Invasion of Britain===

In early 1719 the Irish exile, the Duke of Ormonde, organized an expedition with extensive Spanish support to invade Britain and replace King George I with James Stuart, the Jacobite &quot;Old Pretender&quot;. However, his fleet was dispersed by a storm near Galicia in March 1719, and never reached Britain. A small force of 300 Spanish marines under George Keith, 10th Earl Marischal did land near Eilean Donan, but they and the Highlanders who supported them were defeated at the Battle of Eilean Donan in May 1719 and the Battle of Glen Shiel a month later, and the hopes of an uprising soon fizzled out.

===Vigo===

In retaliation for this attack, the British government prepared to launch a raid on the Spanish coast. An expedition was assembled at Portsmouth and the Isle of Wight under the command of Lord Cobham and George Wade. They successfully captured Vigo and marched inland seizing the towns of Redondela and Pontevedra in October 1719. This caused some shock to the Spanish authorities as they realized how vulnerable they were to Allied amphibious attacks, with the potential to open up a new front away from the French frontier.

===North America===
The French captured the Spanish settlement of Pensacola in Florida in May 1719, pre-empting a Spanish attack on South Carolina. While Spanish forces retook the town in August 1719, it fell to the French again towards the end of the year and they destroyed the town before withdrawing.

In February 1720 a 1,200 strong Spanish force set out from Cuba to take the British settlement of Nassau in the Bahamas. After taking a large amount of plunder they were eventually driven off by the local militia.

On June 16, 1720 (four months after the end of the war), the Villasur expedition left Santa Fe de Nuevo Mexico to check on 1719 reports of growing French presence in the Great Plains, but was defeated on August 14 by Pawnee and Otoe warriors, assisted by French settlers, near modern-day Columbus, Nebraska. This was the furthest north and east that any Spanish expedition reached in interior North America before France ceded Louisiana to Spain in 1762.

==Peace==

Displeased with his kingdom&#x27;s military performance, Philip dismissed Alberoni in December 1719, and made peace with the allies with the Treaty of The Hague on 17 February 1720.

In the treaty, Philip was forced to relinquish all territory captured in the war. However, his third surviving son&#x27;s right to the Duchy of Parma and Piacenza after the death of Elisabeth&#x27;s childless uncle, Antonio Farnese, was recognized.

France returned Pensacola and the remaining conquests in the north of Spain in exchange for commercial benefits. Included in the terms of this treaty, Victor Amadeus was forced to exchange Sicily for that of the less important Kingdom of Sardinia.

==Legacy==
The war provided a unique example during the eighteenth century when Britain and France were on the same side. It came during a period between 1716 and 1731 when the two countries were allies. Spain would later join with France in the Bourbon Compact, and the two would become enemies of the British once more. Spain later regained the Kingdom of Naples during the 1733 to 1735 War of the Polish Succession.

<doc id="744767" wikidata="Q603075" url="?curid=744767" title="Alfonso, Duke of Anjou and Cádiz">
<text>Alfonso, Duke of Anjou, Duke of [[Cádiz]], [[Grandee]] of Spain (Spanish: &quot;Don Alfonso Jaime Marcelino Manuel Víctor María de Borbón y Dampierre&quot;; French: &quot;Alphonse Jacques Marcellin Emmanuel Victor Marie de Bourbon&quot;; 20 April 1936 – 30 January 1989) was a grandson of King Alfonso XIII of Spain, a potential heir to the throne in the event of the restoration of the Spanish monarchy, and the Legitimist claimant to the throne of France.

==Upbringing==
Alfonso was born at Sant&#x27;Anna Clinic in Rome, the elder son of Infante Jaime, Duke of Segovia, King Alfonso&#x27;s second of four sons. His mother was &quot;Donna&quot; Emanuela de Dampierre, daughter of Roger, Duke of San Lorenzo and &quot;Donna&quot; Vittoria Ruspoli dei principi di Poggio Suasa. The Segovias lived in Rome where Jaime&#x27;s father had maintained a royal court-in-exile since the royal family fled Spain following the 1931 election of republicans and socialists in Spain&#x27;s major cities. Alfonso was baptised by Eugenio Cardinal Pacelli (later Pope Pius XII) at the Palazzo Ruspoli on the Via del Corso in Rome, home of his maternal grandmother, &quot;Donna&quot; Vittoria Ruspoli dei principi di Poggio Suasa.

In 1941, Alfonso and his parents followed his English-born grandmother, Queen Victoria Eugenie to Lausanne in Switzerland. They lived first at the Hotel Royal, before Alfonso and his younger brother Gonzalo were sent to the Collège Saint-Jean (later Villa St. Jean International School) in Fribourg. On 8 December 1946 Alfonso made his first communion with his brother, Gonzalo; on the same day he was confirmed by Pedro Cardinal Segura y Sáenz, Archbishop of Seville.

==Spanish succession rights==
The king&#x27;s eldest son, Alfonso, Prince of Asturias, had inherited hemophilia from his maternal great-grandmother Queen Victoria, yet had been considered Spain&#x27;s heir apparent until the republic was established in 1931. In 1933 he renounced any claim to inherit the Spanish throne (in the event of a restoration) to marry a Cuban commoner, Edelmira Sampedro-Ocejo, and later died of internal bleeding following a minor auto accident by September 1938. Next in the line of succession, Infante Don Jaime, deaf and largely mute, was that same day persuaded to renounce his claim (and that of future descendants) alongside his elder brother, thereby assuming the Duke of Segovia title and clearing the way for King Alfonso&#x27;s third son, Don Juan, Count of Barcelona to take up the monarchist cause on behalf of the banished dynasty. There being no need for Segovia to contract a dynastic alliance, Emanuela de Dampierre&#x27;s noble rather than royal background was looked upon approvingly by the former king and former queen when the couple wed in Rome in 1935, and neither style nor title is attributed to Alfonso de Borbón-Segovia y Dampierre in the 1944 edition of the &quot;Almanach de Gotha&quot;.

During the Spanish Civil War which began in July 1936 Franco emerged as the &quot;Caudillo&quot; of the &quot;Falangist movement&quot;, overturning the republic and promising restoration, yet consolidating his grip on power in Madrid. Following Alfonso XIII&#x27;s death in Rome in February 1941, Franco wrote Don Juan, acknowledging him as rightful heir to the throne (though without inviting him to occupy it), implicitly confirming that he considered Segovia and his sons excluded from the royal succession. Although in 1947, following the overturn of monarchies in Eastern Europe and Italy, Franco promulgated, and voters approved, a succession law which defined Spain as a kingdom, it also empowered Franco to decide whom to enthrone and when. Don Juan responded by issuing the Estoril Manifesto which affirmed the traditional order of succession, and followed up with comments embracing a democratic monarchy. The new law allowed Franco or his successor to choose any man &quot;of royal lineage&quot; as king, and Alfonso was mentioned that year as a possible alternative to Don Juan and his son, Juan Carlos, should Franco consider the former too liberal to reign over a Falangist Spain.

In December 1949, Segovia retracted his renunciation as coerced and claimed that he was the rightful claimant to Spain&#x27;s crown. Relations between Don Juan and Franco continued to deteriorate and in 1952 the latter prevailed upon Segovia to send his elder son to Spain to be educated under his guidance. Reluctantly, Alfonso moved from Switzerland to Spain, initially to study law at Deusto University and, in 1955 to attend the elite &quot;Centro de Estudios Universitarios&quot; (CEU). By 1956 Franco was diverting sponsors of some civic events from Juan Carlos, who was also being educated in Spain under the &quot;Caudillo&#x27;s&quot; supervision, to Alfonso. By 1964, Franco considered Juan Carlos his preferred candidate for the throne over his father, but also considered that if the latter deviated from obedience to Franco or loyalty to his &quot;Movimiento Nacional&quot;, Alfonso was a suitable alternative. Alfonso&#x27;s strongest supporter in Franco&#x27;s government was Jose Solis, minister and secretary-general of the &quot;Movimiento&quot;. Anticipating that Franco would soon offer to declare him Spain&#x27;s next king rather than Don Juan, in June 1969, Juan Carlos warned his father that if he declined Franco&#x27;s offer, Alfonso would be invited to accept the crown, nevertheless Don Juan refused to consent to being bypassed. Nonetheless on 12 July 1969 Franco offered to designate Juan Carlos king whenever he stepped down from power, and Juan Carlos accepted.

Asked by Juan Carlos to be chief witness at the ceremony declaring him successor and &quot;Prince of Spain&quot;, Alfonso immediately agreed to do so and sent some of his supporters to visit his father in Paris to persuade him to express no opposition publicly. In return for his full support, Franco later appointed Alfonso Spain&#x27;s ambassador to Sweden. But in June 1972, after he had taken up that post, Alfonso advised Franco&#x27;s foreign minister Laureano López Rodó that he deemed his support conditional upon his cousin&#x27;s continued loyalty to Francoist Spain. He further hinted that Spain&#x27;s law of succession should be amended to facilitate Alfonso&#x27;s replacing or succeeding Juan Carlos as Franco&#x27;s heir or on the throne, if circumstances called for such a change.

On 8 March 1972, in the Palace of &quot;El Pardo&quot; in Madrid, Alfonso married Doña María del Carmen Martínez-Bordiú y Franco, daughter of Don Cristóbal Martínez-Bordiú, 10th Marquis de Villaverde, and of his wife, Doña Carmen Franco y Polo (Franco&#x27;s only daughter. Doña Carmen was granted a title in 1975 becoming the 1st Duchess de Franco after Franco&#x27;s death). The witnesses of the marriage were Franco and Alfonso&#x27;s mother. Alfonso and Carmen separated in 1979, received a civil divorce in 1982 and an ecclesiastical annulment in 1986.

On 22 November 1972, General Franco awarded Alfonso the Spanish title &quot;Duque de Cádiz&quot; with the dignity Grandee of Spain, and he received the style of &quot;Royal Highness&quot;. The Cádiz title had been held by Alfonso&#x27;s great-great-grandfather, the Infante Francisco de Asís.

==French succession rights==
Since Alfonso&#x27;s mother was not born a princess of royal descent, his grandfather Alfonso XIII did not consider young Alfonso in line to the Spanish throne in accordance with the Pragmatic Sanction of 1830. Alfonso&#x27;s father Jaime, however, came to assert that his sons were French dynasts entitled to the style of &quot;Royal Highness&quot;.

In Spain up until 1972, Alfonso was generally addressed as &quot;Don Alfonso de Borbón y Dampierre&quot;. Elsewhere he was often addressed as a prince.

From his birth, Alfonso was considered a &quot;prince du sang&quot; by those legitimists who believed that Alfonso XIII was also the heir to the French throne. When his grandfather died on 28 February 1941, Alfonso&#x27;s father Jaime succeeded him in this French claim; Alfonso was thereupon recognised by the legitimists as Dauphin of France.

On 25 November 1950, Alfonso received the title &quot;Duc de Bourbon&quot; (Duke of Bourbon) from his father. In 1963, Alfonso engaged the French historian and ardent royalist Hervé Pinoteau as his private secretary. Pinoteau remained with him until the duke&#x27;s death.

On 20 March 1975, Alfonso&#x27;s father Jaime died. On 3 August 1975, he took the courtesy title &quot;Duc d&#x27;Anjou&quot; (Duke of Anjou).

On 21 January 1985 (the 192nd anniversary of the death of King Louis XVI) Alfonso was present for the requiem mass at the Chapelle expiatoire in Paris.

==Marriage and children==
 

* Don &quot;Francisco de Asís&quot; Alfonso Jaime Cristóbal Víctor José Gonzalo Cecilio de Borbón y Martínez-Bordiú, Duke of Bourbon (Madrid, 22 November 1972 – Pamplona, 7 February 1984). 
* Don &quot;Luis Alfonso&quot; Gonzalo Víctor Manuel Marco de Borbón y Martínez-Bordiú, Duke of Anjou (born Madrid, 25 April 1974).

==Lawsuit of the Count of Clermont against the Duke of Anjou==
In 1987, his paternal 10th cousin Prince Henri of Orléans, Count of Clermont, eldest son of Henri, Count of Paris, the then Orléanist claimant to the defunct throne of France, initiated a court action against Alfonso for his use of the title Duke of Anjou and the coat-of-arms France Moderne (three &quot;fleur-de-lis or&quot;); Henri asked the court to fine Alfonso 50,000 French francs for each future violation. In 1988, Prince Ferdinand, Duke of Castro and Prince Sixtus Henry of Bourbon-Parma joined Henri&#x27;s lawsuit in reference to the use of the title Duke of Anjou, but not in respect to the coat-of-arms. On 21 December 1988, the Tribunal de grande instance of Paris ruled that the lawsuit was inadmissible because the title&#x27;s legal existence could not be proven; that neither the plaintiff (Henri) nor the intervenors (Fernando and Sixtus) had established their claims to the title; and that Henri was not injured from the use of the plain arms of France by the Spanish branch of the Bourbon family.

In 1989, Prince Henri d&#x27;Orléans and Prince Sixtus Henry of Bourbon-Parma appealed the judgment in the lawsuit about the use of a title and arms by Alfonso; the original judgment in favour of Alfonso was upheld.

== Career ==
From 1977 to 1984, Alfonso was President of the Spanish Skiing Federation, and from 1984 to 1987 President of the Spanish Olympic Committee.

==Death==
Alfonso died in a skiing accident in Beaver Creek Resort, Eagle County, Colorado, on 30 January 1989, beheaded by a cable which he collided with as it was being raised to support a banner at the finish line of a course at the FIS Alpine World Ski Championships.

<text>Kolya () is a 1996 Czech drama film about a man whose life is reshaped in an unexpected way. The film was directed by Jan Svěrák and stars his father, Zdeněk Svěrák, who also wrote the script from a story by Pavel Taussig. &quot;Kolya&quot; earned critical acclaim and won the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film and Golden Globe Award for Best Foreign Language Film.

== Plot ==
The film begins in 1988 in Soviet-occupied Czechoslovakia. František Louka, a middle-aged man dedicated to bachelorhood and the pursuit of women, is a concert cellist struggling to eke out a living by playing funerals at the Prague crematoriums. He has lost his previous job at the Czech Philharmonic, having been blacklisted as &quot;politically unreliable&quot; by the authorities. A friend offers him a chance to earn a great deal of money through a sham marriage to a Russian woman to enable her to stay in Czechoslovakia. The woman then uses her new citizenship to emigrate to West Germany, where her boyfriend lives.

Due to a concurrence of circumstances, she has to leave behind her 5-year-old son, Kolya, for the disgruntled Czech musician to look after. At first Louka and Kolya have communication difficulties, as they don&#x27;t speak each other&#x27;s languages and the many false friend words that exist in Czech and Russian add to the confusion. Gradually, though, a bond forms between Louka and Kolya. The child suffers from suspected meningitis and has to be placed on a course of carefully monitored antibiotics. Louka is threatened with imprisonment for his suspect marriage and the child may be placed in a Soviet children&#x27;s home. The Velvet Revolution intervenes though, and Kolya is reunited with his mother. Louka and Kolya say their goodbyes.

Louka returns to the Czech Philharmonic and plays &quot;Má Vlast&quot; with the orchestra under the conductor Rafael Kubelík at the Old Town Square in 1990, while his pregnant girlfriend Klára watches from the crowd.

<doc id="744786" wikidata="Q232789" url="?curid=744786" title="Simone Perrotta">
<text>Simone Perrotta (; born 17 September 1977) is an Italian former professional footballer who played as a midfielder. Throughout his career, he stood out for his work-rate, energy, and box-to-box play as a ball-winner in the midfield area. After initially playing for Italian sides Reggina, Juventus, Bari, and Chievo, Perrotta went on to spend most of his career with Serie A club Roma, until his retirement on 29 June 2013; he won consecutive Coppa Italia titles with the club in 2007 and 2008, as well as the 2007 Supercoppa Italiana.

Born in England, at international level, Perrotta represented the Italy national team on 48 occasions between 2002 and 2009. He was a member of the team that won the 2006 FIFA World Cup and also represented Italy in two UEFA European Championships.

==Club career==
===Early career: Reggina and Juventus===
Perrotta was born in Ashton-under-Lyne, England, in the same hospital as England&#x27;s 1966 World Cup winner Geoff Hurst. He grew up in the youth system of Reggina and debuted in Serie B in 1995, becoming an important fixture in their line-up. In 1998, Juventus decided to sign him; however, due to the presence of several more experienced and world-class midfielders ahead of him on the team, such as Antonio Conte, Didier Deschamps, Edgar Davids, Alessio Tacchinardi, and Zinedine Zidane, he struggled to gain playing time, and only made five league appearances for the Turin club, and 15 in total. Despite his limited space at the club, he was able to score a goal in the Coppa Italia, make his Champions League debut, and appeared in the 1999 UEFA Intertoto Cup, which Juventus went on to win, before being sent out on loan to Bari.

===Bari===
In 1999, Perrotta was farmed to Bari in a co-ownership deal for 3 billion Italian lire (or €1,549,371), as part of Gianluca Zambrotta&#x27;s deal, where he played for two seasons, breaking into the first team. In June 2001, Bari acquired him outright for approximately €300,000, making Juventus booked a financial cost of €1.25 million for the discount.

===Chievo===
At the start of 2001–02 Serie A, following Bari&#x27;s relegation from the Serie A, he was shipped to Chievo, where he remained for three seasons, and made a name for himself as one of Italy&#x27;s best midfielders. Alongside Eugenio Corini, he was a mainstay in the midfield of a surprising newly promoted Chievo squad that was first place at the winter break, and finished the season in fifth place under manager Luigi Delneri, qualifying for the UEFA Cup. He even provided the winning assist in their famous victory over Internazionale that season. Despite his consistent performances, his next two seasons at the club were less successful, due to the departure of several key players, as Chievo finished seventh in Serie A during the 2002–03 season, and ninth in Serie A during the 2003–04 season.

===Roma===
In 2004, Roma signed him from the Veneto club for €7.2 million on a four-year instalment. The deal was later changed to three instalments, however; new Roma signing Matteo Brighi, valued at €16 million was loaned to Chievo for the season as part of the deal. and then discounted to €7.05 million, His first season at the club saw him play in a supporting role as a defensive midfielder, behind the attacking trio made up of Francesco Totti, Antonio Cassano, and Vincenzo Montella; however, the season was largely unsuccessful, as Roma underwent several managerial changes, suffered a first round elimination in the UEFA Champions League, finished eighth in Serie A, and lost out to Inter in the 2005 Coppa Italia final.

The following season saw the arrival of Luciano Spalletti as Roma&#x27;s new head coach. Under Spalletti&#x27;s 4–2–3–1 formation, Perrotta played in a more advanced role, behind the first striker and in between the left and right winger as an attacking central midfielder, in which he was able to rediscover his form, becoming a key member of Roma&#x27;s midfield, as Roma reached the 2006 Coppa Italia final. In merit of his fine performances for the capital club, he earned a call-up to Marcello Lippi&#x27;s Italy squad for the 2006 FIFA World Cup, starting all seven games for the eventual champions. In 2006, he also signed a contract extension with the capital club, keeping him in Rome until 2010.

Perrotta continued to excel in this more advanced role under Spalletti, and scored 13 goals in all competitions during the 2006–07 season, as he won the Coppa Italia title in 2007, finishing as the tournament&#x27;s top scorer; the following season, he helped Roma to defend title, and also won the 2007 Supercoppa Italiana, in which he was sent off.

Perrotta signed a new one-year extension to his contract with Roma in October 2009, extending his stay at the club until 2011. In March 2011, he signed another contract, with basic salary decreased to €2.5 million per season.

For the 2011–12 season, Perrotta was usually used as a central midfielder alongside Daniele De Rossi and Miralem Pjanić. On 20 February 2012, Perrotta signed a new one-year extension to his contract with Roma that will keep him at the club until 2013. Perrotta&#x27;s fixed gross fee for the current season was raised to €2.6 million plus performance bonuses. He played 20 matches in the 2011–12 season, failing to score a goal.

After almost two years without scoring, he scored against Siena on 2 December 2012, giving Roma a 1–2 lead away. Roma eventually won the game 1–3, with a brace from Mattia Destro. He scored again on 3 March 2013, also in a 3–1 win, against Genoa at the Stadio Olimpico. He was substituted on for striker Dani Osvaldo in the 81st minute and eight minutes later, in the 89th minute, he scored a goal that sealed the match. After the appointment of Aurelio Andreazzoli as caretaking manager, he received significantly more playing time than under the Czech Zdeněk Zeman. He finished the season with 16 league appearances, only four as a starter, with two goals scored; under manager Aurelio Andreazzoli, he was left on the bench in Roma&#x27;s 1–0 Coppa Italia final defeat to cross-city rivals Lazio. On 29 June 2013, Perrotta announced his retirement from professional football.

==International career==
Perrotta was eligible to play for both Italy and England – the latter due to his birth in the country (in addition to being Italian, he is automatically a British citizen as the United Kingdom granted unconditional birthright citizenship until 1983). Perrotta made his debut for the Italy under-21 team under Marco Tardelli, making 6 appearances and scoring a goal. He won the 2000 UEFA European Under-21 Football Championship, appearing in Italy&#x27;s 2–1 victory over the Czech Republic in the final, but was later dropped from the 2000 Summer Olympics squad due to injury. He made his senior international debut under Giovanni Trapattoni, on 20 November 2002, in a 1–1 draw against Turkey. He subsequently played for Italy at UEFA Euro 2004, scoring a goal in a 2–1 win against Bulgaria, although the Italy national side were eliminated in the first round of the tournament on direct-encounters following a three-way five point tie with Denmark and Sweden.

Perrotta also represented the Italy national team during the 2006 FIFA World Cup under coach Marcello Lippi, starting in all seven of the &quot;Azzurri&quot;&#x27;s games, including the final, en route to their fourth World Cup title, setting up Filippo Inzaghi&#x27;s goal in a 2–0 win over the Czech Republic in Italy&#x27;s final group match of the tournament on 22 June. Unlike with Roma, Perrotta was often used as a left winger with the Italy national team under Lippi, or as a &quot;front-lying&quot; defensive midfielder, as he was in the 2006 World Cup.

Under new manager Roberto Donadoni, Perrotta scored his second goal for Italy in a 3–1 away win over Georgia in a Euro 2008 qualifying match on 11 October 2006. He made his first appearance as Italy captain on 21 November 2007, in the second half of a 3–1 home win over the Faroe Islands, in a European qualifier. He went on to take part at UEFA Euro 2008, often appearing as an attacking midfielder, where Italy lost out to eventual champions Spain on penalties in the quarter-finals.

In 2009, after being left out from 2010 FIFA World Cup squad by Marcello Lippi, he retired from international football; he made his final appearance for Italy on 10 February 2009, in a 2–0 friendly defeat to Brazil, at the Emirates Stadium. In total he made 48 appearances for Italy, scoring two goals.

==Style of play==
A quick, physically strong, energetic, tenacious, and hard-working two-way player, Perrotta was known for his pace, versatility, and consistency, as well as his stamina, box-to-box play, and hard running style. His wide range of skills allowed him to play anywhere in midfield. He was usually used in the centre, and often in a holding role in front of the defence, where he was adept at pressing opponents, breaking down plays, and subsequently distributing the ball to team-mates after winning back possession, or even linking up with other players through his passing to help start attacks. However, throughout his career, he was also deployed in other roles; for example, he was also used in a more offensive central midfield role, known as a &quot;mezzala&quot; in Italian football jargon, due to his movement. With the Italy national football team, under manager Marcello Lippi, he was used out wide as a defensive winger in a 4–4–1–1 formation during the 2006 World Cup, due to his work-rate and crossing ability; he was also later used in a similar role under his Roma manager Claudio Ranieri. Under his Roma manager Luciano Spalletti, he was even fielded in a more advanced role during the 2006–07 season, as a false attacking midfielder behind the team&#x27;s lone striker Francesco Totti in a 4–2–3–1 formation, the latter of whom acted as a false nine; this change of position was effective, due to Perrotta&#x27;s movement off the ball, eye for goal from midfield, and ability to make late attacking runs into the penalty box, despite not being the most naturally technically gifted player in his position.

==Personal life==
Perrotta is of Calabrian origins and was born in England. He lived in England until the age of five, attending the former St Ann&#x27;s RC Primary School on Burlington Street in the electoral ward of St Peter&#x27;s in Ashton-under-Lyne. His parents, Francesco and Anna Maria, ran a pub in Ashton and lived on Fitzroy Street and briefly at the Chiltern Chapel before moving back to Italy in 1982, to their hometown Cerisano, near Cosenza. He is married and he has a son called Peter.

On 22 December 2010, a statue of Perrotta was unveiled in Ashton-under-Lyne, close to Curzon Ashton F.C.&#x27;s Tameside Stadium in the Roy Oldham Sports Village, Richmond Street. The triple sculpture by Andrew Edwards and Sculpture For Sport commemorates the three men from the borough of Tameside who hold World Cup winner&#x27;s medals: Geoff Hurst, Jimmy Armfield, and Perrotta. He speaks English and Italian.

<text>Stein&#x27;s lemma, named in honor of Charles Stein, is a theorem of probability theory that is of interest primarily because of its applications to statistical inference — in particular, to James–Stein estimation and empirical Bayes methods — and its applications to portfolio choice theory. The theorem gives a formula for the covariance of one random variable with the value of a function of another, when the two random variables are jointly normally distributed.

Note that the name &quot;Stein&#x27;s lemma&quot; is also commonly used to refer to a different result in the area of statistical hypothesis testing, which connects the error exponents in hypothesis testing with the Kullback–Leibler divergence. This result is also known as the Chernoff–Stein lemma and is not related to the lemma discussed in this article.

==Statement==
Suppose &quot;X&quot; is a normally distributed random variable with expectation μ and variance σ2. 
Further suppose &quot;g&quot; is a differentiable function for which the two expectations E(&quot;g&quot;(&quot;X&quot;) (&quot;X&quot; − μ)) and E(&quot;g&quot; ′(&quot;X&quot;)) both exist. 
(The existence of the expectation of any random variable is equivalent to the finiteness of the expectation of its absolute value.) 
Then

:formula_1

=== Multidimensional ===
In general, suppose &quot;X&quot; and &quot;Y&quot; are jointly normally distributed. Then

:formula_2

For a general multivariate Gaussian random vector formula_3 it follows that
:formula_4
Similarly, when formula_5, formula_6

=== Gradient descent ===
Stein&#x27;s lemma can be used to stochastically estimate gradient:formula_7where formula_8 are IID samples from the standard normal distribution formula_9. This form has applications in Stein variational gradient descent and Stein variational policy gradient.

==Proof==

The univariate probability density function for the univariate normal distribution with expectation 0 and variance 1 is

:formula_10

Since formula_11 we get from integration by parts:

:formula_12.

The case of general variance formula_13 follows by substitution.

==Generalizations==
Isserlis&#x27; theorem is equivalently stated asformula_14where formula_15 is a zero-mean multivariate normal random vector.

Suppose &quot;X&quot; is in an exponential family, that is, &quot;X&quot; has the density

:formula_16

Suppose this density has support formula_17 where formula_18 could be formula_19 and as formula_20, formula_21 where formula_22 is any differentiable function such that formula_23 or formula_24 if formula_18 finite. Then 

:formula_26

The derivation is same as the special case, namely, integration by parts.

If we only know formula_27 has support formula_28, then it could be the case that formula_29 but formula_30. To see this, simply put formula_31 and formula_32 with infinitely spikes towards infinity but still integrable. One such example could be adapted from formula_33 so that formula_34 is smooth. 

Extensions to elliptically-contoured distributions also exist.
