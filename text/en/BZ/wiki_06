<text>Willem Jacob Luyten (March 7, 1899 – November 21, 1994) was a Dutch-American astronomer.

==Life==
Jacob Luyten was born in Semarang, Java, at the time part of the Dutch East Indies. His mother was Cornelia M. Francken and his father Jacob Luyten, a teacher of French.

At the age of 11 he observed Halley&#x27;s Comet, which started his fascination with astronomy. He also had a knack for languages, and eventually could speak nine. In 1912 his family moved back to the Netherlands where he studied astronomy at the University of Amsterdam, receiving his BA in 1918.

He was the first student to earn his PhD (at the age of 22) with Ejnar Hertzsprung at Leiden University. In 1921 he left for the United States where he first worked at the Lick Observatory. From 1923 to 1930 Luyten worked at the Harvard College Observatory eventually working at the observatory&#x27;s Bloemfontein station. He spent the years 1928–1930 in Bloemfontein, South Africa, where he met Willemina H. Miedema and married her on February 5, 1930.

Upon his return to the United States in 1931, he taught at the University of Minnesota from 1931–1967, then served as astronomer emeritus from 1967 until his death.

Luyten studied the proper motions of stars and discovered many white dwarfs. He also discovered some of the Sun&#x27;s nearest neighbors, including Luyten&#x27;s Star as well as the high–proper motion star system Luyten 726-8, which was soon found to contain the remarkable flare star UV Ceti.

He also catalogued 17,000 high-proper motion stars in the Luyten Two-Tenths Arcsecond Catalog. An exoplanet was discovered orbiting one of them, LTT 1445A.

<text>Oscar Solomon Straus (December 23, 1850 – May 3, 1926) was an American politician and diplomat. He served as United States Secretary of Commerce and Labor under President Theodore Roosevelt from 1906 to 1909. He was the first Jewish United States Cabinet Secretary. 

Straus also served in four presidential administrations as America&#x27;s representative to the Ottoman Empire and ran for Governor of New York in 1912 as the candidate of then-former president Theodore Roosevelt&#x27;s Progressive &quot;Bull Moose&quot; Party, in tandem with Roosevelt&#x27;s own unsuccessful run for a nonconsecutive third term as president that same year.

==Early life and education==

Oscar Straus was born to a German Jewish family in Otterberg in the former Palatinate, then ruled by the Kingdom of Bavaria (now part of present-day Germany), the third child of Lazarus Straus (1809–1898) and his second wife, Sara (1823–1876). His siblings were Hermine Straus Kohns (1846–1922), Isidor Straus (1845–1912), and Nathan Straus (1848–1931). The family moved to the U.S. state of Georgia in 1854. The Straus family owned slaves and conducted business with other slave owners, taking several formerly enslaved people to the North with the family following the defeat of the Confederacy. 

At the close of the Civil War he moved to New York City where he graduated from Columbia College in 1871 and Columbia Law School in 1873. He practiced law until 1881, and then became a merchant, retaining his interest in literature.

==Diplomatic career==

He first served as United States Minister to the Ottoman Empire from 1887 to 1889 and again from 1898 to 1899. Upon his arrival to Constantinople, he was said to have been given a &quot;cordial welcome&quot;. 

At the outbreak of the Philippine–American War in 1899, Secretary of State John Hay asked Strauss to approach Sultan Abdul Hamid II to request that the Sultan write a letter to the Moro Sulu Muslims of the Sulu Sultanate telling them to submit to American suzerainty and American military rule. The Sulu sultanate agreed, with Straus writing that the &quot;Sulu Mohammedans ... refused to join the insurrectionists and had placed themselves under the control of our army, thereby recognizing American sovereignty.&quot;

President McKinley sent a personal letter of thanks to Straus and said that its accomplishment had saved the United States at least twenty thousand troops in the field.&quot; 

The Moro Rebellion then broke out in 1904 with war raging between the Americans and Moro Muslims and atrocities committed against Moro Muslim women and children such as the Moro Crater Massacre.

On January 14, 1902, he was named a member of the Permanent Court of Arbitration at The Hague to fill the place left vacant by the death of former President Benjamin Harrison.

==Career as Secretary of Commerce and Labor and Ambassador to Ottoman Empire==
In December 1906, Straus became the United States Secretary of Commerce and Labor under President Theodore Roosevelt. The position also placed him in charge of the US Bureau of Immigration. During his tenure, Straus ordered immigration inspectors to work closely with local police and the United States Secret Service to find, arrest, and deport immigrants with anarchist political beliefs under the terms of the Anarchist Exclusion Act. 

Straus left the Commerce Department in 1909 when William Howard Taft became president. Taft appointed him U.S. Ambassador to the Ottoman Empire in 1909. During the Taft administration, an American strategy was to become involved in business transactions, rather than military confrontations, a policy known as Dollar Diplomacy. It failed with respect to the Ottoman Empire because of opposition from Straus, who served until 1910, and to the Ottoman vacillation under pressure from the entrenched European powers, which did not wish to see American competition. American trade remained a minor factor.

In 1912, he ran unsuccessfully for Governor of New York on the Progressive and Independence League tickets. In 1915, he became chairman of the public service commission of New York State. He was elected to the American Philosophical Society in 1917. In 1919, he was a delegate representing the League to Enforce Peace at the Versailles Peace Conference.

He was president of the American Jewish Historical Society.

He is buried at Beth El Cemetery in Ridgewood, New York.

==Family==

The Straus family had several influential members including Straus&#x27;s grandson Roger W. Straus, Jr., who started the publishing company of Farrar, Straus and Giroux; his brother, Isidor Straus, who perished aboard the RMS &quot;Titanic&quot; in 1912, served as a representative from New York City&#x27;s 15th District, and was co-owner of the department store R. H. Macy &amp; Co. along with another brother, Nathan; and nephew Jesse Isidor Straus, confidant of Franklin Delano Roosevelt and Ambassador to France from 1933 to 1936.

In 1882, Strauss married Sarah Lavanburg. They had three children: Mildred Straus Schafer (born 1883), Aline Straus Hockstader (born 1889), and Roger Williams Straus (born 1891).

The family&#x27;s household goods from their Washington home were sold at an by C.G. Sloan held March 25, 26, and 27, 1909.

His grandson is Oscar Schafer, chairman emeritus of the New York Philharmonic.

<text>Martin Schwarzschild (May 31, 1912 – April 10, 1997) was a German-American astrophysicist.

==Biography==
Schwarzschild was born in Potsdam into a distinguished German Jewish academic family. His father was the physicist Karl Schwarzschild and his uncle the astrophysicist Robert Emden. His sister, Agathe Thornton, became a classics scholar in New Zealand.

In line with a request in his father&#x27;s will, his family moved to Göttingen in 1916. Schwarzschild studied at the University of Göttingen and took his doctoral examination in December 1936. He left Germany in 1936 for Norway and then the United States.
Schwarzschild served in the US army intelligence. He was awarded the Legion of Merit and the Bronze Star for his wartime service. After returning to the US, he married fellow astronomer Barbara
Cherry (1914–2008).
In 1947, Martin Schwarzschild joined his lifelong friend, Lyman Spitzer at Princeton University. Spitzer died 10 days before Schwarzschild.

Schwarzschild&#x27;s work in the fields of stellar structure and stellar evolution led to improved understanding of pulsating stars, differential solar rotation, post-main sequence evolutionary tracks on the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram (including how stars become red giants), hydrogen shell sources, the helium flash, and the ages of star clusters. With Fred Hoyle, he computed some of the first stellar models to correctly ascend the red-giant branch by steadily burning hydrogen in a shell around the core.
He and Härm were the first to compute stellar models going through thermal pulses on the asymptotic giant branch and later showed that these models develop convective zones between the helium- and hydrogen-burning shells, which can bring nuclear ashes to the visible surface.
Schwarzschild&#x27;s 1958 book &quot;Structure and Evolution of the Stars&quot; taught a generation of astrophysicists how to apply electronic computers to the computation of stellar models.

In the 1950s and ’60s he headed the Stratoscope projects, which took instrumented balloons to unprecedented heights.
The first Stratoscope produced high resolution images of solar granules and sunspots, confirming the existence of convection in the solar atmosphere, and the second obtained infrared spectra of planets, red giant stars, and the nuclei of galaxies. In his later years he made significant contributions toward understanding the dynamics of elliptical galaxies. Schwarzschild was renowned as a teacher and held major leadership positions in several scientific societies.

In the 1980s, Schwarzschild applied his numerical skills to building models for triaxial galaxies.
Schwarzschild was the Eugene Higgins Professor Emeritus of Astronomy at Princeton University, where he spent most of his professional life.

<doc id="726413" wikidata="Q2120578" url="?curid=726413" title="Zero-emissions vehicle">
<text>A zero-emission vehicle (ZEV) is a vehicle that does not emit exhaust gas or other pollutants from the onboard source of power. The California definition also adds that this includes under any and all possible operational modes and conditions. This is because under cold-start conditions for example, internal combustion engines tend to produce the maximum amount of pollutants. In a number of countries and states, transport is cited as the main source of greenhouse gases (GHG) and other pollutants. The desire to reduce this is thus politically strong.

==Terminology==
Harmful pollutants to the health and the environment include particulates (soot), hydrocarbons, carbon monoxide, ozone, lead, and various oxides of nitrogen. Although not considered emission pollutants by the original California Air Resources Board (CARB) or U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) definitions, the most recent common use of the term also includes volatile organic compounds, several toxic airborne compounds (such as 1,3-Butadiene), and pollutants of global significance such as carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases.

Examples of zero-emission vehicle with different power sources can include muscle-powered vehicles such as bicycles, electric bicycles, and gravity racers.

===Motor vehicles===
Also other battery electric vehicles, which may shift emissions to the location where the electricity is generated (if the electricity comes from coal or natural gas power plants—as opposed to hydro-electric, wind power, solar power or nuclear power plants); and fuel cell vehicles powered by hydrogen, which may shift emissions to the location where the hydrogen is generated. It does not include hydrogen internal combustion engine vehicles because these do generate some emissions (although being near-emissionless). It also does not include vehicles running on 100% biofuel as these also emit exhaust gases, despite being carbon neutral overall.

Emissions from the manufacturing process are thus not included in this definition, and it has been argued that the emissions that are created during manufacture are currently of an order of magnitude that is comparable to the emissions that are created during a vehicle&#x27;s operating lifetime.

However, these vehicles are in the early stages of their development; the manufacturing emissions may decrease by the development of technology, industry, shifting toward mass production and the ever-increasing use of renewable energy throughout the supply-chains.

==History==

===Well-to-wheel emissions===
The term zero-emissions or ZEV, as originally coined by the California Air Resources Board (CARB), refers only to motor vehicle emissions from the onboard source of power. Therefore, CARB&#x27;s definition is accounting only for pollutants emitted at the point of the vehicle operation, and the clean air benefits are usually local because depending on the source of the electricity used to recharge the batteries, air pollutant emissions are shifted to the location of the electricity generation plants. In a broader perspective, the electricity used to recharge the batteries must be generated from renewable or clean sources such as wind, solar, hydroelectric, or nuclear power for ZEVs to have almost none or zero well-to-wheel emissions. In other words, if ZEVs are recharged from electricity generated by fossil fuel plants, they cannot be considered as zero emissions.

However, the spread of electrical-powered vehicles can help the development of systems for charging the EV batteries from excess electricity which cannot be used otherwise. For instance, electricity demand is lowest at night and the excess generated electricity at this time can be used for recharging the EVs&#x27; batteries. It&#x27;s worth mentioning that renewable sources such as wind turbines or solar panels are less controllable in terms of the amount of generated electricity compared to fossil fuel power plants; most renewable energy sources are intermittent energy sources. Therefore, development of these resources will lead to excess energy which can be better used by development of EVs. Moreover, most EVs can benefit from regenerative brakes and other optimization systems which increases the energy efficiency in these vehicles.

Fuel cell vehicles (FCVs) can help even more in terms of the development of sustainable energy sources because these cars use hydrogen as their fuel. Compressed hydrogen can be used as an energy storage element, while electricity must be stored in batteries. The hydrogen can be produced by electricity through electrolysis, and this electricity can come from green sources. Hydrogen can be produced in situ, e.g. excess at wind farm when the generated electricity is not needed, or it can be connected to the grid to use the excess electricity from the grid and produce electricity, e.g. at hydrogen pump stations. As a result, development of FCVs can be a big step toward sustainable development and reducing GHG emission in a long-term perspective.

Other countries have a different definition of ZEV, noteworthy the more recent inclusion of greenhouse gases, as many European rules now regulate CO2 emissions. CARB&#x27;s role in regulating greenhouse gases began in 2004 based on the 2002 Pavley Act (AB 1493), but was blocked by lawsuits and by the EPA in 2007, by rejecting the required waiver. Additional responsibilities were granted to CARB by California&#x27;s Global Warming Solutions Act of 2006 (AB 32), which includes the mandate to set low-carbon fuel standards.

As a result of an investigation into false advertising regarding &quot;zero-emissions&quot; claims, the Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) in the UK ruled in March 2010 to ban an advertisement from Renault UK regarding its &quot;zero-emission vehicles&quot; because the ad breached CAP (Broadcast) TV Code rules 5.1.1, 5.1.2 (Misleading advertising) and 5.2.1 (Misleading advertising- Evidence) and 5.2.6 (Misleading advertising-Environmental claims.)

Greenhouse gases and other pollutant emissions are generated by vehicle manufacturing processes. The emissions from manufacturing are many factors larger than the emissions from tailpipes, even in gasoline engine vehicles. Most reports on ZEVs&#x27; impact to the climate do not take into account these manufacturing emissions, though over the lifetime of the car the emissions from manufacturing are relatively small.

Considering the current U.S. energy mix, a ZEV would produce an average 58% reduction in carbon dioxide emissions per mile driven. Given the current energy mixes in other countries, it has been predicted that such emissions would decrease by 40% in the U.K. and 19% in China.

==Types of zero-emission vehicles==

Apart from animal-powered and human-powered vehicles, battery electric vehicles (which include cars, aircraft and boats) also do not emit any of the above pollutants, nor any CO2 gases during use. This is a particularly important quality in densely populated areas, where the health of residents can be severely affected. However, the production of the fuels that power ZEVs, such as the production of hydrogen from fossil fuels, may produce more emissions per mile than the emissions produced from a conventional fossil fueled vehicle. A well-to-wheel life cycle assessment is necessary to understand the emissions implications associated with operating a ZEV.

===Bicycles===

In the mid-19th century, bicycle ownership became common (during the bike boom)—predating mass car ownership. In the 1960s, the Flying Pigeon bicycle became the single most popular mechanized vehicle on the planet. Some 210 million electric bikes are on the road in China.

===Motor vehicles===

Segway Personal Transporters are two-wheeled, self-balancing, battery-powered machines that are eleven times more energy-efficient than the average American car. Operating on two lithium-ion batteries, the Segway PT produces zero emissions during operation, and utilizes a negligible amount of electricity while charging via a standard wall outlet.

===Marine===
Wind-powered land vehicles operating on wind exist (using wind turbines and kites). For boats and other watercraft, regular and special sails (as rotorsails, wing sails, turbo sails, skysails) exist that can propel them without emissions.

===Air===
An electric aircraft is an aircraft powered by electric motors. Electricity may be supplied by a variety of methods including batteries, ground power cables, solar cells, ultracapacitors, fuel cells and power beaming. Between 2015 and 2016, Solar Impulse 2 completed a circumnavigation of the Earth using solar power.

==Incentives==

===Subsidies for public transport===
Japanese public transport is being driven in the direction of zero emissions due to growing environmental concern. Honda has launched a conceptual bus which features exercise machines to the rear of the vehicle to generate kinetic energy used for propulsion.

Due to the stop-start nature of idling in public transport, regenerative braking may be a possibility for public transport systems of the future.

===Subsidies for development of electric cars===
In an attempt to curb carbon emissions as well as noise pollution in South African cities, the South African Department of Science &amp; Technology (DST), as well as other private investments, have made US$5 million available through the Innovation Fund for the development of the Joule. The Joule is a five-seater car, planned to be released in 2014. However the company ceased trading in 2012.

===Low and zero emission zones===
Several cities have implemented low-emission zones. Launched in 2019 and set to expand in 2023, the implementation of London&#x27;s Ultra Low Emission Zone (ULEZ) incentivizes and accelerates the widespread adoption of cleaner vehicles through setting daily charge rates for driving vehicles that are non-compliant with ULEZ emission standards.

<text>The Sapsal (also Sapsali/Sapsari or Sapsalgae) () is a shaggy-haired South Korean breed of dog that is said to ward off evil spirits. In the Korean language, the word &quot;Sapsal&quot; is followed by either &quot;gae&quot; (, meaning &quot;dog&quot;) or the nominative particle &quot;i&quot; (), and may occasionally be romanized as Sapsaree. The breed was designated as one of the Natural monuments of South Korea in 1992 to receive protected status and funding for its preservation as a part of Korea&#x27;s cultural heritage. The breed is officially recognized by the Korean Kennel Federation.

== Description ==
The height of the male is 51cm and the female is 49cm, and the body is covered with long, thick fur which protects them from the cold. The dog may be any of several colors, either solid or mixed: 

* Black
* Gold
* Orange
* Brown
* Grey

The ears lie down, and the snout is relatively blunt and not pointed like a Jindo dog. Its tail is raised and its head is large, so its shape resembles that of a lion. Its personality is bold and valiant, loyal to its owner. 

==History==
The breed&#x27;s name Sapsalgae means &quot;a dog that chases away evil spirits and misfortune&quot;, and it appears frequently in lyrics, folktales, and paintings. They are nicknamed &quot;Ghost Hunters&quot; or &quot;Sunshine Dogs&quot; for their supernatural qualities, or &quot;Lion Dogs&quot; for their appearance having large paws and shaggy fur. 

Sapsali dogs date back to the Three Kingdoms period around 220 A.D. - 280 A.D. They were mainly bred as companions for aristocrats during the Silla period, but were owned by common people after the collapse of Unified Silla. A 300-year-old stone memorial in southeastern South Korea tells the story of an aristocrat who fell asleep on a riverbank after having too many drinks. Embers from his pipe started a brush fire as he slept, and his faithful Sapsali jumped into the river and used its wet fur to douse the fire and save its master at the cost of its own life.

The breed were slaughtered in large numbers by the Japanese when Korea was under Japanese rule to make winter coats for its military in Manchuria. In the late 1960s professors at Kyungpook National University collected about 30 Sapsali dogs in an effort to preserve the breed, but the dogs were near extinction by the mid-1980s with only eight dogs remaining. The breed was revived by geneticist Dr. Ha Ji-hong, who used DNA methods to reestablish the breed and weed out congenital issues. In 1992 the breed was designated as one of the Natural Monuments of South Korea, receiving protected status and funding for its preservation as a part of Korean cultural heritage.

The breed&#x27;s population currently numbers in the thousands, and they are commonly found as household pets and therapy dogs due to their gentle temperament, loyal nature, and friendliness. A Sapsali dog was chosen as the Mascot of the IAAF World Champship in Daegu 2011.

<text>Inner Space Cavern (Also known as Laubach Cave) is a karst cave located in Georgetown, Texas. The cavern was formed by water passing through Edwards limestone. The cavern is estimated to be around 20–25 million years old but were only open to the surface since the late Pleistocene period 14,000–45,000 years ago.

== Geology ==
=== Speleogenesis ===
Inner Space Cavern lies within limestone and dolomite rocks of the Edwards Group formed during the Cretaceous period. Following the formation of the Balcones Fault, a series of vertical fractures through the Edwards Formations allowed ground water to freely move through the limestone marking the beginning of the cavern&#x27;s formation. As water from the surface became ground water, carbon dioxide (CO2) was picked up from the atmosphere and from decaying organic matter, creating carbonic acid (H2CO3), which would react with and dissolve the limestone rocks creating voids. Over millions of years these voids grew leaving behind large rooms and passages. 

=== Fossil Record ===
There were several large openings to the caverns during the Ice Age, an evidence of several skeletons of prehistoric Ice-Age animals including a baby mammoth, giant sloth and the saber-toothed tiger have been found in the cavern; many were trapped in the cavern after they fell through the opening, unable to escape, and others drowned in thick, quicksand-like mud at the bottom of watering holes. Some filled-in sinkholes have been found, including the prehistoric entrance to the cavern. All natural entrances closed approximately 14,000 years ago. 

== Discovery ==
Inner Space Cavern was discovered by the Texas Highway Department drilling team in the spring 1963 during the construction of an overpass for Interstate 35. The cavern was mapped for the first time by the Texas Speleological Association in 1963; since then, several miles of the cavern&#x27;s passage have been surveyed, with many sections of the cavern remaining unexplored, due to filled-in areas being blocked.

== Tourist attraction ==
The cavern was opened to the public in 1966. Three different levels of tours are available, ranging from a basic walking guided tour to an advanced wild cave spelunking tour, with over 1.2 miles of passage being open to the public. However, non-public passages are well-guarded and independent exploration is not allowed. Apart from the main entrance, which was created by dynamite blasts, a vertical borehole, located in the Inner Cathedral Room, serves as an emergency entryway/exit and a means for ventilating the cavern.

<text>The Oscar S. Straus Memorial in Washington, D.C., commemorates the accomplishments of the first Jew to serve in the cabinet of a U.S. president. Oscar Solomon Straus was Secretary of Commerce and Labor under President Theodore Roosevelt from 1906 to 1909. The memorial is a marble fountain located in the Federal Triangle on 14th Street between Pennsylvania Avenue and Constitution Avenue, Northwest, Washington, D.C. It is located in front of the Ronald Reagan Building and International Trade Center.

The fountain was designed by Adolph Alexander Weinman, funded with a public subscription beginning in 1929, and dedicated on October 26, 1947. In the center of the memorial is the massive fountain with the inscription &quot;&quot; and to each side are two groups of statues, one called &quot;Justice&quot; (to symbolize the religious freedom which allowed a Jew to serve in such a position of authority) and the other &quot;Reason&quot; (to symbolize the capitalism and labor efforts put forth by Straus).

It was rededicated on October 26, 1998.

<doc id="726426" wikidata="Q1687740" url="?curid=726426" title="Jerome Hanus">
<text>Jerome George Hanus, O.S.B. (born May 26, 1940) is an American prelate of the Roman Catholic Church, presiding as archbishop of the Archdiocese of Dubuque in Iowa from 1995 until 2013.

A member of the Order of Saint Benedict, Hanus served as abbot of Conception Abbey from 1977 to 1987. He also served as bishop of the Diocese of Saint Cloud in Minnesota from 1987 to 1994 and coadjutor archbishop of the Archdiocese of Dubuque from 1994 to 1995.

== Biography ==

===Early life and education===
George Hanus was born on May 26, 1940, in Brainard, Nebraska, to Leo A. and Kristine (née Polak) Hanus. The third of eight children, he has three brothers and four sisters. He received his early education at parochial schools in Dwight, Nebraska, and Bellwood, Nebraska, Hanus graduated from St. John Vianney Seminary in Elkhorn, Nebraska in 1958.

Hanus joined the Order of Saint Benedict, at Conception Abbey in Conception, Missouri. He made his profession as a Benedictine monk on September 1, 1961, taking the name Jerome. Hanus studied at Conception Seminary College in Conception, Missouri, where he earned a Bachelor of Arts degree in 1963. He continued his studies at the Pontifical University of St. Anselm in Rome, receiving a Licentiate of Sacred Theology in 1967.

===Priesthood===
Hanus was ordained to the priesthood in the Order of Saint Benedict by Archbishop Gerald Bergan on July 30, 1966.After his ordination, Hanus taught scholastic theology at Conception Seminary College from 1967 to 1969. He studied moral theology at Princeton University, earning a Master of Arts degree in 1972. Hanus then returned to Conception Seminary, where he served as professor of religion from 1973 to 1976. From 1974 to 1976, Hanus was an adjunct professor of moral theology at the Pontifical University of St. Anselm.

Hanus was elected the sixth abbot of Conception Abbey on January 5, 1977, and received the abbatial blessing the next day. In addition to his role as abbot, he served as abbot president of the Swiss-American Congregation, to which the abbey belongs, from 1984 to 1987.

===Bishop of Saint Cloud===
On July 6, 1987, Pope John Paul II appointed Jerome as the eighth bishop of the Diocese of Saint Cloud. He was consecrated on August 24, 1987, by Archbishop John Roach. Bishops John Sullivan and George Speltz were the principal co-consecrators.

===Archbishop of Dubuque===
On August 23, 1994, John Paul II appointed Hanus as the coadjutor archbishop of the Diocese of Dubuque. He was installed on October 27, 1994. In 1995, Archbishop Daniel Kucera sent his letter of resignation as archbishop of Dubuque to Pope John II, On October 16, 1995, Hanus automatically succeeded Kucera as the 11th bishop and 9th archbishop of Dubuque.

As archbishop, Hanus implemented a strategic planning process throughout the archdiocese. He spoke to people in the archdiocese via videotaped messages played at mass in all the parishes. Parishioners were given opportunities to respond and express their own views. Hanus then issued a vision statement, which spelled out his plans for the archdiocese. These plans included an increased role for the laity in leadership roles, necessitated by the priest shortage and the changing demographics of the archdiocese. These conditions also forced Hanus to combine and close a number of parishes.

On February 1, 2006, Hanus announced a $5 million legal settlement for 26 victims of sexual abuse by priests in the 1950s and 1960s in the archdiocese. Six deceased priests were mentioned in the document; the one living priest who was listed has since been laicized.

On May 12, 2008, US Immigration and Customs Enforcement raided the Agriprocessors meat packing plant in Postville, Iowa, detaining 398 employees who were overwhelmingly of Latino descent. In the wake of the raid, Hanus called for comprehensive immigration reform. He called on those attending at a prayer service to remember the scriptures &quot;to treat the alien in your midst like your brother or sister, and that when you receive the alien, the foreigner, you are welcoming Christ.&quot;

In February 2012. Hanus suffered serious chest injuries when his car rolled over twice in a crash. Those injuries caused recurring body spasms that required hospitalizations and resulted in more arthritic pain.

== Retirement and legacy ==
Hanus submitted his resignation as archbishop for health reasons, which Pope Francis accepted. On April 8, 2013, Hanus announced that Francis had appointed Bishop Michael Jackels of the Diocese of Wichita to succeed him. Hanus acted as apostolic administrator for the archdiocese until Jackels was installed on May 30, after which he resumed his life as a monk in Missouri.

In April 2013, Hanus was scheduled to make a deposition in two sexual abuse lawsuits against Conception Abbey. The plaintiffs were two Missouri men who claimed that in the 1980s Reverend Bede Parry, a priest at the abbey, had abused them as boys. Hanus served as abbot of Conception Abbey during that period. The lawsuits claimed that Hanus met with Perry in 1981, before the alleged abuses occurred. In that meeting, Perry confessed to &quot;inappropriate sexual relationships&quot; with minors. Hanus ordered Perry to undergo psychological counseling, but allowed him to continue as the youth choir director. According to Perry, Hanus told him not to do it again.

* Andrea Guarneri ( 1626 – 7 December 1698) was an apprentice in the workshop of Nicolò Amati from 1641 to 1646 and returned to make violins for Amati from 1650 to 1654. His early instruments are generally based on the &quot;Grand Amati&quot; pattern but struggled to achieve the sophistication of Amati&#x27;s own instruments. Andrea Guarneri produced some fine violas. The ex-Primrose Viola, which was played by William Primrose, bears Andrea&#x27;s label but may have been made by his son Giuseppe.

Two of Andrea&#x27;s sons continued the father&#x27;s traditions:

* Pietro Giovanni Guarneri (&quot;Pietro da Mantova&quot;) (18 February 1655 – 26 March 1720) worked in his father&#x27;s workshop from around 1670 until his marriage in 1677. He was established in Mantua by 1683, where he worked both as a musician and a violin maker. His instruments are generally finer than his father&#x27;s, but are rare owing to his double profession. Joseph Szigeti played one of his instruments.
*Giuseppe Giovanni Battista Guarneri (&quot;filius Andreae&quot;) (25 November 1666 – 1739 or 1740), Andrea&#x27;s younger son, joined his father&#x27;s business in Cremona, inheriting it in 1698. He is reckoned among the great violin makers, although he struggled to compete with Stradivari, a pervasive presence throughout his career. From around 1715 he was assisted by his sons, and probably Carlo Bergonzi.

Giuseppe Giovanni Battista was father to two further instrument makers:

* Pietro Guarneri (&quot;Pietro da Venezia&quot;) (14 April 1695 – 7 April 1762), finding life in Casa Guarneri in some way uncongenial, left Cremona for good in 1718, eventually settling in Venice. Here he blended the Cremonese techniques of his father with Venetian, perhaps working with Domenico Montagnana and Carlo Annibale Tononi. His first original labels from Venice date from 1730. His instruments are rare and as highly prized as those of his father and uncle. One of his cellos was played by Beatrice Harrison.
* Bartolomeo Giuseppe Guarneri (&quot;del Gesù&quot;) (21 August 1698 – 17 October 1744) has been called the greatest violinmaker of all time. Giuseppe is known as &quot;del Gesù&quot; (&quot;of Jesus&quot;) because his labels always incorporated the characters I.H.S. (&quot;iota eta sigma&quot;, a Greek acronym known as the Christogram). His instruments deviated significantly from family tradition, becoming uniquely his own style, and are considered second in quality only to those of Stradivari and argued by some to be superior. The famed violin virtuoso Niccolò Paganini’s favorite instrument &quot;Il Cannone Guarnerius&quot; was a Guarneri del Gesù violin of 1743. The &quot;Lord Wilton&quot; Guarneri del Gesù violin made in 1742 was owned by Yehudi Menuhin. His last work is believed to be &quot;Ole Bull&quot;, a Guarneri del Gesù violin of 1744.

Other 20th-century &#x27;del Gesù&#x27; players include Arthur Grumiaux, Jascha Heifetz, Leonid Kogan, Kyung Wha Chung, Michael Rabin, Joseph Silverstein, Isaac Stern, Pinchas Zukerman, Charles Fleischman, Robert McDuffie, Itzhak Perlman, Midori Goto, Rachel Barton Pine, Henryk Szeryng, Sarah Chang, Leila Josefowicz and the late Eugene Fodor.

The Guarneri family&#x27;s history is partially uncertain. Anthony J. Guarnieri writes, &quot;Giuseppe del Gesù and Peter of Venice may have been cousins rather than brothers, and Peter of Venice may have been the son of Peter of Mantua.&quot;

&quot;Signor Giovanni de Piccolellis, in 1885, searched the archives at the church, San Donato, in Cremona for information on the Guarneri family. His findings, published 1886, in the manuscript entitled &quot;LIUTAI ANTICHI e MODERNI&quot;, and now available online in PDF format on Google Books clearly shows that Joseph Guarneri &#x27;del Gesù&#x27; was the son of Gian Battista Guarneri, who was in fact the younger brother of Andrea Guarneri.&quot;

==Guarneri violins==
Some of the world&#x27;s most famous violinists, such as Niccolò Paganini, Jascha Heifetz and Yehudi Menuhin have preferred Guarneris to Stradivaris. The average Stradivari is stronger in the 200 Hz and 250 Hz bands and above 1.6 kHz. Guarneri violins are also known by the extension of Giuseppe Guarneri&#x27;s name, Del Gesù. Del Gesùs are on average stronger from 315 Hz up to 1.25 kHz. These differences are perceived as a more brilliant sound and stronger fundamentals of the lowest notes of the Stradivari, versus a darker sound in the del Gesùs.

A Guarneri violin is a center object in one of Andrea Camilleri&#x27;s main Montalbano novels &quot;La Voce del violino&quot; (&quot;The voice of the violin&quot;).

In the summer of 2010, the ex-Vieuxtemps Guarneri del Gesù, a violin built in 1741 by Bartolomeo Giuseppe Guarneri, was offered for sale at auction with a starting bid of $18 million, the highest price ever sought for a musical instrument. The violin was later sold for an undisclosed sum and Anne Akiko Meyers was given lifetime use.

<text>The Ronald Reagan Building and International Trade Center, named after former United States President Ronald Reagan, is located in downtown Washington, D.C., and was the first federal building in Washington designed for both governmental and private sector purposes.

Each of the organizations located in the Pennsylvania Avenue building are dedicated to international trade and global relations. Organizations headquartered in this building include U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP), U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), and the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars. The first private sector lease was signed with investment banking firm Quarterdeck Investment Partners, Inc. The building hosts conferences, trade shows, cultural events, and outdoor concerts. Post-9/11, security requirements for high-profile federal buildings has limited the amount of public access anticipated by the center&#x27;s designers.

==History==

===20th century===

The building is located near Federal Triangle station in Washington, D.C., an area once heavily populated with saloons and brothels. The federal government purchased the land in the 1920s, and it was to be part of the Federal Triangle redevelopment of the late 1920s and 1930s. Until development on the current building began, the area known as the &quot;Great Plaza&quot; was used as a massive downtown parking lot.

In the 1960s and 1970s, efforts were under way to finish Federal Triangle by building a large office building on the site of the parking lot. The first effort came in 1972, when the Nixon administration proposed building a $126 million office building on the lot in time for the national bicentennial in 1976. But this proposal was never seriously contemplated or funded. One outcome of the Nixon proposal was &quot;the Weese Plan&quot;. The Nixon administration commissioned the architecture planning firm of Harry Weese &amp; Associates to come up with a master plan for the continued development of Federal Triangle. The Master Plan, which was later called the Weese Plan, proposed a massive new federal office building on the parking lots of the Triangle and a new series of pedestrian paths throughout the complex, titled &quot;Federal Walk&quot;. Federal Walk would not only be a network of sidewalks designed to showcase the architecture of Federal Triangle; it also included destinations such as spots for tourists to wait for tours of the interiors of each building, outdoor art, places for rest and contemplation, and cafes and restaurants. Federal Walk was gradually implemented in piecemeal fashion over the next 15 years, although it still remained incomplete as of 1997. The General Services Administration (GSA) held a competition in 1982 to select a design for a 10-story office building to replace the parking lot, but planning bodies refused to approve the plan.

Plans for construction of an office building on the Federal Triangle parking lot site found support in 1986. The Federal City Council, a private civic organization which had been promoting the construction of a $200 million international trade center in the District of Columbia, advocated construction of its proposed building at Federal Triangle. Reagan administration officials favored the plan, and in October 1986 the proposal received the backing of the GSA. The idea received support from Democrats in Congress as well, especially from Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan, a former Kennedy administration aide who had long championed completion of the Federal Triangle. There was some opposition to the idea from planning officials and others, who were dismayed at the loss of parking in the downtown area and who feared that the trade center&#x27;s proposed 1,300 to 2,600 underground parking slots would not be built due to poor soil conditions. A bill was passed (almost unanimously) by Congress on August 7, 1987, to provide $362 million for the construction of an &quot;International Cultural and Trade Center&quot; on the parking lot at Federal Triangle. 

The plan was to provide office space for both the U.S. Departments of Justice and State. The legislation also provided that although the U.S. government would finance the building, a private developer would construct it. The federal government would lease space from the private developer for 30 years, after which ownership of the building would revert to the government. The bill also required the building to be financially self-supporting within two years of its completion. The rental prices throughout the lease&#x27;s term would remain stable. It was only the fifth time the government had signed a &quot;lease-to-own&quot; agreement. With of office space and of space for trade center activities, the planned trade center would be larger than any other federally owned building except for The Pentagon. 

The bill also required that the trade center be &quot;designed in harmony with historical and government buildings in the vicinity, ... reflect the symbolic importance and historic character of Pennsylvania Avenue and the Nation&#x27;s Capital, and ... represent the dignity and stability of the Federal Government.&quot; A nine-member panel was established to approve any plans, and included the Secretaries of State, Agriculture, and Commerce; the Mayor of the District of Columbia; and five members of the public. The building was expected to be completed in 1992. President Reagan signed the &quot;Federal Triangle Development Act&quot; into law on August 22, 1987.

Preliminary design specifications required that the final building be no taller than the existing Federal Triangle structures, be constructed of similar materials, emphasize pedestrian traffic, and have a &quot;sympathetic&quot; architectural style. An architectural model by the firms of Notter Finegold &amp; Alexander, Mariani &amp; Associates, and Bryant &amp; Bryant depicted a building with a long, uninterrupted facade along 14th Street NW and two colonnaded hemicycles on the east side (matching the Post Office Department building&#x27;s hemicycle). The preliminary design specs were criticized for not more clearly specifying the architectural style, for bringing another 10,000 new workers to Federal Triangle each day, and for reducing the required number of parking spaces by 30 percent to just 1,300. The five public members of the design committee were named on April 6, 1988, and were former Senator Charles H. Percy, chair; Harry McPherson, president of the Federal City Council; Donald A. Brown, chair of the Federal City Council&#x27;s International Center Task Force; Michael R. Garder, a member of the Pennsylvania Avenue Development Corporation; and Judah C. Sommer, a local attorney. 

Groundbreaking on the now-$350 million building was scheduled for 1989, and completion in 1993. Disagreements broke out in mid-1988 over which federal agencies should take up residence in the structure, and whether they should be trade- or foreign-policy related. Seven designs were submitted in June 1989, each incorporating a base-middle-crown structure and enclosed in traditional materials, including a limestone facade, vertical glass windows, and terra-cotta roof tiles. Each design incorporated a new home for the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars (a Smithsonian Institution entity), an outdoor memorial to President Woodrow Wilson, and exhibition and retail space.

Construction began in mid-1989. Contractors estimated the cost of the building at between $550 million and $800 million, far higher than the anticipated $350 million original price tag. The design committee picked the $738.3 million design submitted by Pei Cobb Freed &amp; Partners in October 1989. A consortium, the Delta Partnership, led by New York City developer William Zeckendorf Jr. and Larry Silverstein, was chosen to build and operate the building and lease it to the government. One of the firms that previously lost the contract for the building&#x27;s construction subsequently challenged the bidding process.

Significant cost increases led to the project being mothballed by the George H. W. Bush administration. The GSA refused to sign the draft lease, arguing that the building&#x27;s rental costs were too high and would cost, rather than save, the federal government between $18 million and $24 million a year. Although Pei Cobb Freed agreed to investigate design changes to make the project less costly, at least one member of Congress declared the project dead. In September 1990, the architectural team made changes, which cut $82 million from the cost of the building, including eliminating two theaters, scaling down the reception hall, using plaster rather than stone, substituting aluminum for bronze in the trim, and reducing the size of interior doors, which reduced the building cost to $656 million. 

In January 1991, another design change came when the number of parking spaces at the building was increased by 12.6 percent to 2,500 spaces. But the changes did not resolve the controversies enveloping the project. Design committee member Donald A. Brown quit the committee in late 1991, complaining that the Bush administration was meddling in the project&#x27;s design. Two days later, Eleanor Holmes Norton, delegate to Congress, repeated these charges. On January 19, 1992, even as the foundation for the trade center was being dug, the GSA said the building would not achieve financial self-sufficiency. A separate report commissioned by the Bush administration reached similar conclusions. On January 25, 1992, the Bush administration cancelled the international trade center construction project. Days later, a United States district court ruled that Delta Partnership had been chosen in violation of federal contracting guidelines, although the court also refused to overturn the award after finding no bias in the award process. Construction experts decried the decision, saying that the building&#x27;s costs could balloon to more than $1.2 billion if construction were resumed at a later time.

The decision to cancel the building was reversed on December 2, 1993, by the Clinton administration. Although the building was originally designed to be a major tourist destination and provide a boost to economic development in the downtown area, the building was repurposed to be a simple office building. Rather than a mix of federal and private renters, federal agencies were now scheduled to occupy 80 percent of the office space. By January 1995, the structure was two years behind schedule. 

By September 1995, a tentative occupancy date of December 1996 had been set. The building was named for former President Ronald Reagan in October 1995. There were still occasional design glitches. The GSA approved two major sculptures for the Woodrow Wilson Plaza in 1994, but were abruptly ordered to halt work on them in June 1996 before being ordered to proceed again on them the following month, in July 1996. Construction slipped further, and by January 1997 occupancy was scheduled for the following summer. Construction continued to fall behind schedule, with completion not expected until summer 1998. Federal officials nonetheless planned to move more than 480 Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) employees into the building in July 1997. By this time, security concerns had led to several additional design changes, including a reduction in the number of parking spaces to just 1,900, and the cost of the building&#x27;s construction had risen to $738 million.

====Opening====

The Ronald Reagan Building opened on May 5, 1998. President Bill Clinton and former First Lady Nancy Reagan dedicated the building. Three large pieces of artwork were included in the building. The first, by sculptor and Washington, D.C. native Stephen Robin, is a gigantic rose with stem and a lily, both made out of cast aluminum and lying on stone pedestals. The second, by Washington, D.C. native Martin Puryear, is a Minimalist tower of brown welded metal titled &quot;Bearing Witness&quot;, which stands in Woodrow Wilson Plaza. The third, located inside the building&#x27;s atrium, is a multi-story neon installation by Keith Sonnier titled &quot;Route Zenith&quot;. The structure&#x27;s final cost was $818 million.

===21st century===
In early 2015, the GSA announced that the interior spaces of the Reagan Building had &quot;reached the anticipated end of life cycle in nearly all areas of finishes, carpets, furniture, fixtures and equipment&quot;, and it began seeking contractors to extensively renovate the structure.

== Occupants ==
In addition to CBP, AID and the Wilson Center, other federal agencies with offices in the building include the Department of Commerce, EPA and GSA. Other tenants include the National Children&#x27;s Museum, several retail shops and various commercial and nonprofit organizations.

== Events ==
The conference center hosts over 1,200 events each year, including many of Washington&#x27;s annual social galas such as the Washington International Trade Association&#x27;s Annual Dinner, and formerly including the Conservative Political Action Conference. The International Trade Center offers two large ballrooms, exhibition space, pre-function space, and other reception spaces. The outdoor, four-acre Woodrow Wilson Plaza is also used in special events and galas.

With the city&#x27;s largest parking garage, information center, and a Washington Metro station, the building is visited by over one million tourists each year. The summer concert series held on the Woodrow Wilson Plaza and the many food options draw many to the building during the lunch hour. The National Children&#x27;s Museum opened in the building on February 24, 2020.

<text>Hurricane hunters, typhoon hunters, or cyclone hunters are aircrews that fly into tropical cyclones to gather weather data. In the United States, the organizations that fly these missions are the United States Air Force Reserve&#x27;s 53rd Weather Reconnaissance Squadron and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration&#x27;s Hurricane Hunters. Such missions have also been flown by Navy units and other Air Force and NOAA units. Other organizations also fly these missions, such as Government Flying Service Hong Kong.

The first crewed flight into a hurricane happened in 1943 when a pilot-trainer flew into a Category 1 hurricane near Galveston, Texas on a bet.

In the past, before satellites were used to find tropical storms, military aircraft flew routine weather reconnaissance tracks to detect formation of tropical cyclones. While modern satellites have improved the ability of meteorologists to detect cyclones before they form, only aircraft are able to measure the interior barometric pressure of a hurricane and provide accurate wind speed data, information needed to accurately predict hurricane development and movement.

==Units==
===USAFR 53rd WRS===
The Air Force Reserve 53rd Weather Reconnaissance Squadron, the world&#x27;s only operational military weather reconnaissance unit, is based at Keesler Air Force Base in Biloxi, Mississippi; most weather recon flights originate there. The term &quot;hurricane hunters&quot; was first applied to its missions in 1946.

The USAFR hurricane hunters fly weather missions in an area midway through the Atlantic Ocean to the Hawaiian Islands, and have on occasion flown into typhoons in the Pacific Ocean and gathered data in winter storms.

The 53rd WRS hurricane hunters operate ten Lockheed WC-130J aircraft, which fly directly into hurricanes, typically penetrating the hurricane&#x27;s eye several times per mission at altitudes between and .

===NOAA Hurricane Hunters===

The civilian and NOAA Corps crew members of the NOAA Hurricane Hunters, originally based at the Aircraft Operations Center at MacDill AFB, in Tampa, Florida, mainly perform surveillance, research, and reconnaissance with highly instrumented aircraft including airborne Doppler weather radar measurements in both Atlantic and Pacific storms. In June 2017 the Hunters moved into a new facility at Lakeland Linder International Airport in Lakeland, Florida, having been at MacDill since 1993. They fly two Lockheed WP-3D Orion aircraft, heavily instrumented flying laboratories modified to take atmospheric and radar measurements within tropical cyclones and winter storms, and a G-IV Gulfstream high-altitude jet above to document upper- and lower-level winds that affect cyclone movement. The computer models that forecast hurricane tracks and intensity mainly use G-IV dropsonde data collected day and night in storms affecting the United States.

On September 27, 2024, NOAA announced it had awarded a contract to Lockheed Martin Aeronautics for two Lockheed Martin C-130J Super Hercules aircraft configured for use as hurricane hunters to replace its aging WP-3D Orions, with service entry planned in 2030.

===Government Flying Service Hong Kong===
Since 2009 the Government Flying Service of Hong Kong (GFS) have conducted regular flight data collection in cooperation with the Hong Kong Observatory. In 2011, the cooperation between GFS and the Observatory extended to reconnaissance flights to capture weather data for tropical cyclones over the South China Sea. In September 2016 they introduced the dropsonde system, which collects extra meteorological data on tropical cyclones to enhance the monitoring of typhoons.

==History==
Among the types of aircraft that have been used to investigate hurricanes, are an instrumented Lockheed U-2 flown in Hurricane Ginny during the 1963 Atlantic hurricane season. Other types include the A-20 Havoc, 1944; B-24, 1944–1945; B-17, 1945–1947; B-25, 1946–1947; B-29, 1946–1947. WB-29, 1951–1956; WB-50, 1956–1963; WB-47, 1963–1969; WC-121N 1954–1973; WC-130A, B, E, H, 1965–2012.

The idea of aircraft reconnaissance of hurricane storm trackers was put forth by Captain W. L. Farnsworth of the Galveston Commercial Association in the early 1930s. Supported by the United States Weather Bureau, the &quot;storm patrol bill&quot; passed both the United States Senate and United States House of Representatives on June 15, 1936.

=== 1935 Labor Day Hurricane ===
The first time a reconnaissance flight took place with the sole purpose of locating a hurricane was during the 1935 Great Labor Day Hurricane, which would later become the strongest storm to ever impact the U.S.

On September 1, the storm moved through The Bahamas where it was estimated to be at hurricane strength. As a result, ships began to avoid the Florida Straits, depriving the Weather Bureau of valuable information. This led to confusion as the Weather Bureau believed it would continue on its westward path and make landfall in Cuba while the Cuba weather service didn&#x27;t see any evidence for this.

On September 2, a pilot flying over the Florida Keys noticed a large cloud mass to the east and more north than it should have been. The Cuban weather service requested a plane to be sent up to find the storm, with Captain Leonard Povey volunteering. After circling, but not penetrating (his plane had an open cockpit), the storm, he confirmed the storm was located more north than originally thought and actually heading northeast. This was relayed to the Weather Bureau, which immediately put warnings out for the Florida Keys. The storm would make landfall later that day.

Capt. Povey urged Congress and the Weather Bureau to implement full-time reconnaissance planes, but to no avail. A plan was laid out to use Coast Guard cutters, but was never implemented.

===1943 Surprise Hurricane===
The 1943 Surprise Hurricane, which struck Houston, Texas, during World War II, marked the first intentional meteorological flight into a hurricane. It started with a bet.

That summer, British pilots were being trained in instrument flying at Bryan Field. When they saw that the Americans were evacuating their AT-6 Texan trainers in the face of the storm, they began questioning the construction of the aircraft. Lead instructor Colonel Joe Duckworth took one of the trainers out and flew it straight into the eye of the storm. After he returned safely with navigator Lt. Ralph O&#x27;Hair, the base&#x27;s weather officer, Lt. William Jones-Burdick, took over the navigator&#x27;s seat and Duckworth flew into the storm a second time.

This flight showed that hurricane reconnaissance flights were possible, and further flights continued occasionally. In 1946, the moniker &quot;Hurricane Hunters&quot; was first used, and the Air Force and now Air Force Reserve have used it ever since. The flights demonstrated that hurricane reconnaissance flights were feasible.

===VW-4===
The United States Navy&#x27;s VW-4 / WEARECORON FOUR Weather Reconnaissance Squadron Four, &quot;Hurricane Hunters&quot; was the seventh U.S. Navy squadron dedicated to weather reconnaissance. They flew several types of aircraft, but the WC-121N &quot;Willy Victor&quot; was the aircraft most often associated with flying into the &quot;eye of the storm.&quot; The squadron operated WC-121s between late 1954 and 1972. VW-4 lost one aircraft with its crew of 11 in a penetration of Hurricane Janet in 1955, and another to severe damage in a storm, but the severely damaged Willy Victor (MH-1) brought her crew home, although she never flew again. During 1973–1975, VW-4 operated the turbine-propeller Lockheed WP-3A Orion.

===Hurricane Katrina===
The landfall of Hurricane Katrina on 29 August 2005 devastated Keesler Air Force Base, home of the 53rd WRS. The equipment and personnel of the squadron were flying out of Dobbins Air Reserve Base near Atlanta. Despite heavy equipment losses, the squadron never missed a mission from the National Hurricane Center. The 53rd has since returned to Keesler.

==Aircraft losses==
* October 1, 1945 – A United States Navy Consolidated PB4Y-2 Privateer (Bureau Number: 59415) of VPB-119 went down in Typhoon Jean over the South China Sea. All seven members of the crew were killed.
* October 26, 1952 – A United States Air Force Boeing WB-29 Superfortress (Serial Number: 44-69970) from the 54th Weather Reconnaissance Squadron was lost in Super Typhoon Wilma over the Pacific with 10 men aboard.
* December 16, 1953 – A United States Navy Consolidated PB4Y-2 Privateer (Bureau Number: 59716) of Airborne Early Warning Squadron (VW-3) was lost during reconnaissance of Super Typhoon Doris. All nine members of the crew were killed.
* September 26, 1955 – A United States Navy Lockheed P2V Neptune of Airborne Early Warning Squadron Four (VW-4) disappeared in Hurricane Janet over the Caribbean Sea with nine Navy men and two Canadian journalists aboard.
* January 15, 1958 – A United States Air Force Boeing WB-50 Superfortress (Serial Number: 49-295) from the 54th Weather Reconnaissance Squadron went down southeast of Guam while flying into Super Typhoon Ophelia with nine men aboard.
* October 12, 1974 – In 1974, a newly converted Lockheed WC-130 Hercules (Serial Number: 65-0965) was transferred to the 54th Weather Reconnaissance Squadron, the &quot;Typhoon Chasers&quot;, at Andersen Air Force Base on Guam. The aircraft was sent to investigate Typhoon Bess. The crew departed Clark Air Base in the Philippines with the callsign &quot;Swan 38&quot;. Radio contact with the aircraft was lost on 12 October 1974, apparently as the aircraft was heading into the typhoon&#x27;s eye to make a second position fix. There were no radio transmissions indicating an emergency on board, and search teams could not locate the aircraft or its crew. All six crew members were listed as killed in action. Swan 38 was the only WC-130 lost in a storm.

=== Other incidents === 
*September 15, 1989 – While entering the eyewall of Hurricane Hugo, a NOAA WP-3D Orion (registration N42RF) encountered multiple severe downdrafts, causing the inboard right engine to overheat. The crew was forced to shut it down as the aircraft reached above the ocean in the eye. They dumped fuel and followed a United States Air Force WC-130 out of the hurricane. The aircraft sustained major damage and was grounded for the rest of the 1989 Atlantic hurricane season.
*February 9, 2007 – While inside of an extratropical cyclone, the same WP-3D Orion involved in the Hurricane Hugo incident suffered a compressor stall on three of its four engines at above the ocean, forcing the crew to shut them down. They were able to restart the engines and return to St. John&#x27;s. Sea salt reduced the engine performance, which resulted in a compressor stall and a rain cloud the aircraft passed through caused the engines to be cleaned out, resulting in their restarting.

==In popular culture==
A reality television series featuring the USAFR 53rd WRS, entitled &quot;Hurricane Hunters&quot;, debuted on The Weather Channel in July 2012.

The story of the NOAA flight during Hurricane Hugo was shown as part of the &quot;Mayday&quot; television show on the during 2015.

<text>The 53rd Weather Reconnaissance Squadron, also known by its nickname, Hurricane Hunters, is a flying unit of the United States Air Force, and &quot;the only Department of Defense organization still flying into tropical storms and hurricanes.&quot; Aligned under the 403rd Wing of the Air Force Reserve Command (AFRC) and based at Keesler Air Force Base, Mississippi, with ten aircraft, it flies into tropical cyclones in the Atlantic Ocean, the Caribbean Sea, the Gulf of Mexico and the Central Pacific Ocean for the specific purpose of directly measuring weather data in and around those storms. The 53rd WRS currently operates the Lockheed WC-130J aircraft as its weather data collection platform.

The squadron was activated in 1944 during World War II as the 3rd Weather Reconnaissance Squadron, tracking weather in the North Atlantic between North America and Europe. Redesignated the 53rd Weather Reconnaissance Squadron in 1945, the term &quot;Hurricane Hunters&quot; was first applied to its activities in 1946. The 53rd became a part of the USAF before its inactivation in 1947, was reactivated in 1951 as a long range weather reconnaissance unit based in Bermuda and England, and since 1963 has been based in the southern United States or in Puerto Rico with its primary mission the measurement of tropical cyclones. The 53rd WRS moved to its present home station at Keesler AFB in 1973, and after being briefly inactivated again between 1991 and 1993, became an Air Force Reserve unit.

The Hurricane Hunters of the Air Force Reserve are distinct from those of the Department of Commerce&#x27;s NOAA Hurricane Hunters, based at Lakeland Linder International Airport, Florida, who use a pair of Lockheed WP-3D Orion and a Gulfstream IV-SP aircraft to also fly weather reconnaissance, data collection and scientific research missions. In accordance with its memorandum of agreement with NOAA, AFRC maintains a capability in the 53rd WRS for five sorties per day from its home station and two deployed locations in support of requirements for the National Hurricane Operations Plan, or two sorties a day during winter storm seasons. The 53rd also provides a subunit, the Chief, Aerial Reconnaissance Coordination, All Hurricanes (&quot;CARCAH&quot;), at the National Hurricane Center to coordinate the activities of both organizations.

Concurrent with its operational mission, the 53rd WRS is also tasked with recruiting, organizing and training assigned personnel to perform aerial weather reconnaissance, and its air crews are qualified to handle tactical airlift missions.

==History==

===Operational history===
====Hurricane hunting====
Aerial reconnaissance of tropical storms first began in September 1935. In that year the United States Weather Bureau decentralized its hurricane warning system, which depended to a great extent on reports from ships at sea, opening three warning centers in San Juan, Puerto Rico; Jacksonville, Florida; and New Orleans, Louisiana. In August the Jacksonville center followed the progress of a developing hurricane east of the Bahamas, determining that it would pass through the Straits of Florida and strike the north coast of Cuba. It contacted the Cuban weather service when ship information was no longer available, but track of the storm was lost when the Cubans observed no evidence of it. Acting on a report from a Pan American Airlines pilot, a weather observation flight was requested of the Cuban Army Air Corps and on 2 September 1935 its chief training pilot, American expatriate Capt. Leonard J. Povey, volunteered to locate the system. Although he was unable to penetrate the storm in his open-cockpit Curtiss Hawk II biplane, Povey provided information that indicated the hurricane was moving north into the Florida Keys. The destructiveness of the 1935 Labor Day hurricane prompted Povey to recommend a regular aerial hurricane patrol.

The 1943 Surprise Hurricane, which struck Houston during World War II, marked the first intentional meteorological flight into a hurricane. That summer, British pilots being trained as instrument instructor pilots at Bryan Army Airfield heard that the school was evacuating its AT-6 Texan trainers in the face of the oncoming hurricane, and began teasing their instructors about the airworthiness of the aircraft. Instrument flying school commander USAAF Lt. Col. Joseph B. Duckworth, a former airline pilot with Eastern Airlines who had developed instrument procedures for the carrier, bet his RAF students that he could safely fly into the storm and return. On 27 July 1943 he took out one of the trainers with 2nd Lt Ralph M. O&#x27;Hair navigating and flew it straight into the eye of the storm. After he returned safely, the base&#x27;s only weather officer, 1st Lt William H. Jones-Burdick, took over the navigator&#x27;s seat and Duckworth flew into the storm (now over land) a second time, this time recording their observations and measuring temperatures within the storm. The flights demonstrated that hurricane reconnaissance flights were feasible.

24 days later, on 19 August 1943, the AAF weather station at Waller Field, Trinidad, recorded unusually low pressures and received a similar report from Beane Field on Saint Lucia. Together with a report of high winds to the east from a U.S. Navy aircraft landing at Naval Operating Base Trinidad, the data prompted the first weather reconnaissance mission to locate a previously unreported tropical disturbance, which was flown the next morning. The flight, made by a B-25 Mitchell medium bomber assigned to the 25th Bombardment Group (an anti-submarine unit at nearby Edinburgh Field), proceeded from Waller to Barbados and then due east at altitudes between into the heart of Hurricane III of 1943. Using standard navigational position fixes, the mission plotted observations inflight on a chart as they proceeded and transmitted them to Beane Field for relay to Waller and Borinquen Field, Puerto Rico.

====53rd WRS history====
The 53rd WRS was activated on 7 August 1944 at Presque Isle Army Air Field, Maine, originally as the 3 WRS. Many of its missions were flown from a forward base at Gander, Newfoundland, using B-25s. Its original mission was to fly weather tracks along aircraft ferry routes between North America and Allied Western Europe. During the 1946 season, when the 53d WRS acquired the Boeing RB-29 (later WB-29) Superfortress as its primary aircraft, the term &quot;Hurricane Hunters&quot; was first used to describe its missions. While not an ideal weather reconnaissance platform, the WB-29 proved to be comparatively safe and reliable. The first medium level penetration of a hurricane took place on 19 October 1947 by an RB-29 of the 53d WRS into Hurricane Love near Bermuda, validating penetration of tropical storms at lower altitudes as reasonably safe.

From Gander, the squadron moved to New Hampshire; Florida; Kindley Field, Bermuda; RAF Burtonwood, England, with forward basing at Dhahran, Saudi Arabia; Bermuda for a short time, and Hunter Air Force Base, Georgia. In 1966, now flying the Lockheed WC-130, the 53rd WRS once again left the continental United States, this time for Ramey Air Force Base, Puerto Rico. When Ramey closed in 1973, the Hurricane Hunters relocated to their present location at Keesler AFB, Mississippi.
On 18 September 1953, while based at Kindley, Bermuda, the squadron suffered its only mission-related loss of an aircraft, a WB-29. Returning to base with a runaway propeller on the inboard engine of the right wing, the propeller separated from its shaft and struck the engine beside it, causing both the wing and outboard engine to catch fire. The pilot ordered an immediate bailout, but the aircraft went out of control and only three of the 10-man crew survived.

In 1965 the 53rd WRS became the first squadron of the Air Weather Service to operate the WC-130 after its designation as such, and from Ramey flew the first WC-130 Hurricane Hunter mission on 27 August 1965, penetrating the eye of Hurricane Betsy.

In the 1970s, after its move to Keesler, the 53rd participated in two &quot;firsts&quot; in the changing of regulations to permit women to be qualify as aircrew. Sgt. Vickiann Esposito became the first female dropsonde operator and possibly the first fully qualified aircrew member (excepting flight nurses) in Air Force history, approved by Headquarters Air Force in December 1973 as a waiver of the regulation prohibiting the assignment of women, over the initial objections of the commanding general of the Air Mobility Command. In October 1977, after the regulation had been rescinded, 1st Lt. Florence Fowler became one of the first two women to be rated as navigators (now combat systems officers).

In 1976, the 815th Tactical Airlift Squadron of the Air Force Reserve, also based at Keesler, was redesignated the 815th Weather Squadron &quot;Storm Trackers&quot; and served as an associate squadron to the 53rd until 1987, when the 815th reverted to a tactical airlift unit because of reduced numbers of WC-130s. The Regular Air Force&#x27;s 53rd WRS was inactivated in June 1991 for budgetary reasons and its assets and personnel transferred to the 815th TAS, which formed a flight to assume the weather recon mission while continuing its airlift role as well. On 1 November 1993, as a result of the impact of Hurricane Andrew the year before, the 53rd WRS was reactivated as a full-time Air Force Reserve squadron to take over the weather reconnaissance mission from the 815th AS.

The WC-130H airframes flown by the 53rd WRS were originally built in 1964–65 as C-130Es. Hurricane Andrew had also demonstrated a need for upgraded models to continue the Hurricane Hunter mission, and funding for ten replacements was authorized by Congress in FY1998. On 11 October 1999, the 53rd WRS received its first Lockheed WC-130, and flew its first hurricane mission in the new model on 16 November, into Hurricane Lenny. Problems with the new model, primarily damage to its composite material 6-bladed propellers from hail and ice and a lack of sensitivity in its color radar images, delayed its Initial Operational Capability until just before the 2005 hurricane season. The propeller problem was overcome by bonding a metal sleeve to the leading edge of each blade and the radar issue by changes in the radar software coding.

While in conversion to the new airframe, the unit continued its mission of aerial weather reconnaissance and added a new weather-related mission type in 2003, using the WC-130Js to drop buoys ahead of impending tropical storms. In 2004, the unit started training to support tactical airlift missions in addition to its weather mission. The landfall of Hurricane Katrina on 29 August 2005 caused devastating damage to Keesler. An estimated one-third of the members of the parent 403rd Wing lost a home or had it extensively damaged. Yet the equipment and personnel of the squadron, flying out of Dobbins Air Reserve Base near Atlanta, Georgia when the hurricane struck, never missed a tasked mission during Katrina or follow-up storms.

The operations of the 53rd WRS were affected by the federal budget sequestration of 2013. Furloughs of personnel, amounting to two days in every pay period per member, resulted in a 20% cut in capability, according to the wing commander of the 403rd Wing on 24 July 2013. While sequestration was in effect, this meant the squadron was capable of working only two storms simultaneously at full mission scheduling instead of the normal three, and that pace sustainable only for five or six days.

==Hurricane Hunter mission==
The 53rd Weather Reconnaissance Squadron, using the call signs &quot;Teal 70&quot; to &quot;Teal 79&quot;, flies missions into hurricanes and weather systems for research purposes and observation. Although satellite data has revolutionized weather forecasters&#x27; ability to detect early signs of tropical cyclones before they form, there are still many important tasks for which this information is not suitable. Satellites cannot determine the interior barometric pressure of a hurricane, nor provide accurate wind speed information. These data are needed to accurately predict hurricane development and movement. Because satellites cannot collect the data and ships are too slow and vulnerable, the only viable way to collect this information is with aircraft. Meteorological parameters measured, in order of priority, are:
* Geographical position of the flight level vortex center (vortex fix) and relative position of the surface center, if known;
* Center sea-level pressure determined by dropsonde or extrapolation from within of the sea surface or from the computed 925 hPa, 850 hPa, or 700 hPa height;
* Minimum 700, 850 or 925 hPa height, if available;
* Wind data (continuous observations along the flight track) for surface and flight level;
* Surface wind data from Stepped-Frequency Microwave Radiometer (SFMR);
* High density three-dimensional Doppler radial velocities of the tropical cyclone core circulation;
* Temperature at flight level;
* Rain rate from SFMR;
* Sea surface temperature; and
* Dew-point temperature at flight level.

The 53rd WRS is equipped with ten pallet-instrumented WC-130J aircraft to collect the required meteorological data. The area of responsibility for the &quot;Hurricane Hunters&quot; is from midway through the Atlantic Ocean west to the Hawaiian Islands, although they have also been tasked to fly into typhoons in the Pacific Ocean on occasion, as well as gather data in winter storms. The Hurricane Hunters are tasked to support 24-hour-a-day continuous operations with the ability to fly to up to 3 storms at a time with a response time of 16 hours. This necessitates a mission organization of ten full-time aircrews and ten part-time.

The WC-130J employs a standard five person crew element of a pilot, co-pilot, Combat Systems Officer (CSO), aerial reconnaissance weather officer (ARWO), and a weather loadmaster/dropsonde operator, with a second loadmaster assigned when required. The ARWO is the flight meteorologist and acts as flight director inside the storm system. Operational crews train twice monthly at Keesler AFB and fly weather recon missions when available. 53rd WRS pilots and loadmasters go through their initial C-130J training at the 314th Airlift Wing&#x27;s tactical airlift training center at Little Rock Air Force Base, Arkansas. CSOs and ARWOs from the 53rd WRS have no formal school and train in-house at Keesler utilizing an Air Education and Training Command-approved syllabus for their specialized mission training.

The 53rd WRS uses Henry E. Rohlsen Airport on St. Croix as its primary forward-deployed location for North Atlantic basin operations. Each May since 1996, when it switched operations from Antigua to the U.S. Virgin Islands to operate from U.S. soil, the squadron prepositions maintenance equipment and materiel at Rohlsen in preparation for the coming season. From July through September three crews are commonly forward-deployed to St. Croix at any given time with rotations of a week&#x27;s deployment per month.

Since 1969, the 53rd WRS also performs winter storm weather reconnaissance off both coasts of the United States between 1 November and 15 April in support of the National Centers for Environmental Prediction. These missions are flown at the WC-130&#x27;s service ceiling of , which subjects them to turbulence, lightning and icing. The crews collect data ahead of weather systems, dropping weather buoys along their routes, before they move off the eastern seaboard to help determine if the conditions are right to intensify into Nor&#x27;easter blizzards. In 1997 and 1998, the Hurricane Hunters also flew winter storms in the Gulf of Alaska. The predetermined tracks are six to eleven hours in duration, with one to three missions flown per major winter storm event. Coverage of winter storms in the eastern Pacific has become standard during the month of February, operating TDY from either Elmendorf AFB, Alaska, or Hickam AFB, Hawaii.
The 53rd WRS works closely with the National Hurricane Center (NHC), a division of the National Weather Service (NWS) located in Miami, that tracks hurricanes to provide early warning service for Atlantic basin storms. It maintains a subunit, the &quot;Chief, Aerial Reconnaissance Coordination, All Hurricanes&quot; (CARCAH), at the NHC as a point-of-contact and provides the staff and equipment to coordinate Department of Commerce requirements for hurricane data, assign weather reconnaissance missions and monitor all data transmitted from weather reconnaissance aircraft of DOC and the 53rd WRS. To that end CARCAH is responsible for producing, publishing, and coordinating the Tropical Cyclone Plan of the Day (TCPOD) during hurricane season.

The 53rd WRS maintains similarly configured satellite communications ground stations within CARCAH at the NHC and its facility at Keesler to receive and process data from the aircraft. The Keesler ground station is maintained as a backup to the primary system at NHC, which has greater data streaming capability, and would be manned by CARCAH personnel in the event of a long-term satellite communications failure at NHC. During temporary outages, 53rd personnel at Keesler act as operators and relay data from the aircraft by land line to the CARCAH ground station. Processed data is transmitted to the Weather Product Management and Distribution System (WPMDS) of the Air Force Weather Agency at Offutt AFB, Nebraska, which then relays it to the NWS Telecommunication Gateway at Silver Spring, Maryland, for worldwide distribution. The Keesler site has direct communications capability with WPMDS in the event of land line/internet failure between Keesler and the NHC. The system also provides backup transmission paths to WPMDS using local NHC servers and satellite connection to Keesler in the event of internet outages, except if an outage originates at Offutt.

===Tropical cyclone operational profiles===
When a tropical disturbance becomes suspect for development as a tropical or subtropical cyclone, the NHC assigns the system a temporary tracking (&quot;Investigation&quot;) number and requests the 53rd WRS to determine if the winds are blowing in a counterclockwise rotation, indicating a &quot;closed cyclonic circulation&quot;. This investigative mission is flown at an altitude of above the ocean surface in a pattern designated by the ARWO aboard the mission WC-130 based on observed conditions. The ARWO, using a stepped-frequency microwave radiometer (SFMR, or &quot;smurf&quot;), continuously monitors ocean waves to determine wind speed and direction. The low-level wind and pressure fields provide an accurate picture for NHC forecasters. Investigative missions are usually flown during daylight and may be timed to arrive in the investigative area at first light in the morning or last light in the evening. Weak pressure gradients, large areas of calm, and light winds in areas of heavy convective activity often make vortex fixes difficult to obtain in areas of weak circulation, challenging the skills of the crews.

Once NHC determines that there is circulation within the disturbance, the mission becomes a sequentially numbered &quot;fix&quot; mission, conducted initially every six hours by rotating flights in cooperation with NOAA missions, and then at three-hour intervals as the storm moves within specified parameters. During the &quot;fix&quot; mission, the ARWO directs the aircraft to the true center or &quot;vortex&quot; of the storm by monitoring the radar presentation, temperature, pressure, and mapping the wind fields as the aircraft makes left-hand turns. Vortices determined by individual parameters including visual observation may not coincide at the same geographic location. Surface and upper-level centers may be displaced by many miles. In order to make a reliable evaluation of its size and configuration, the crew flies through the disturbance using &quot;Flight Pattern Alpha&quot; consisting of intercardinal headings with legs in length. The Alpha pattern is repeated at least twice during the mission, which will typically see a penetration of the eye of the system four times. Patterns may also be adjusted to meet circumstances encountered in the system. In August 2011, as Hurricane Irene neared the Delmarva Peninsula between landfalls, a 53rd WRS ARWO directed a pattern with shorter legs and more rapid turnarounds because of the proximity of land, making seven center fixes in one flight. Flight weather data is continuously collected and sent directly to the NHC by satellite communications. Since the WC-130J is not equipped for aerial refueling, the alpha pattern continues until minimum fuel reserve is reached, or until the NHC has received all the data it requires.

Major hurricanes (Category 3 or higher in the Saffir–Simpson scale) are entered at approximately altitude. While penetrating the eyewall, a dropsonde is released to determine the maximum sustained winds at the surface and a second dropsonde is released in the eye to detect the lowest pressure at the surface. After exiting the eye, the ARWO creates a Vortex Data Message that includes the precise latitude and longitude of the storm center as well as its maximum winds, maximum temperature, and minimum sea level pressure. The average duration of a &quot;Hurricane Hunter&quot; mission is ten hours, with five to six hours on station, depending on the distance of the storm from base, when tasked to perform three fixes at three-hour intervals.

The Weather Channel announced in January 2012 that it would be presenting a six-episode docu-reality series (&quot;Hurricane Hunters&quot;) in July 2012 depicting the operations of the 53rd WRS during the 2011 hurricane season. However even before its debut, the series and its network were beset by controversy when a 53rd WRS member, Major (then Captain) Nicole L. Mitchell, an ARWO and an on-camera meteorologist for TWC from July 2004 to January 2011, revealed on 4 June 2012 that she had filed suit 9 September 2011 in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Georgia against The Weather Channel and its owners, NBC Universal and two private equity firms, Bain Capital and the Blackstone Group, claiming that the termination of her employment in 2010 was based on her part-time Air Force Reserve service, was discriminatory and was in violation of the Uniformed Services Employment and Reemployment Rights Act (USERRA) of 1994. A second nine-segment season, filmed in August and October 2012, aired on The Weather Channel beginning in June 2013. Mitchell subsequently became the Chief Meteorologist at Al Jazeera America and after September 2015 became the only remaining Air Force meteorologist with personal experience flying through Hurricane Katrina.

<doc id="726496" wikidata="Q458791" url="?curid=726496" title="German Conservative Party">
<text>The German Conservative Party (, DkP) was a right-wing political party of the German Empire founded in 1876. It largely represented the wealthy landowning German nobility and the Prussian Junker class.

The party was a response to German unification, universal and equal franchise in national elections and rapid industrialization. It changed from a diffuse party of broad ideology into an interest party in Bismarckian Germany. In the early 1870s, Otto von Bismarck formed his majority with the base in the National Liberal Party which emphasized free trade and anti-Catholicism. Bismarck broke with them in the late 1870s, by which time the German Conservative Party and the Free Conservative Party had brought together the landed Junkers in the East and the rapidly growing industrial leadership in the major cities. They now became the main base of Bismarck&#x27;s support and successive Chancellors down to 1918.

According to Robert M. Berdahl, this redirection illustrated &quot;the slow and painful process by which the landed aristocracy adjusted to its new position in the capitalist &#x27;class&#x27; system that had come to replace the precapitalist &#x27;Estate&#x27; structure of Prussian society&quot;.

== Policies ==
The German Conservative Party was generally seen as representing the interests of the German nobility, the Junker landowners living east of the Elbe and the Evangelical Church of the Prussian Union and had its political stronghold in the Prussian Diet, where the three-class franchise gave rural elites and the wealthy disproportionate representation. Predominantly Prussian traditionalists, the party members had been skeptical at first about the 1871 unification of Germany—unlike the Free Conservative Party, a national conservative split-off dominated by business magnates unrestrictedly supporting the policies of Chancellor Otto von Bismarck.
The policies of Old Conservatives like Field Marshal Helmuth von Moltke or Elard von Oldenburg-Januschau generally embraced support for the powers of the monarchy and opposition to economic liberalism and democratization, the introduction of electoral reform in Prussia, or true parliamentary government in Germany as a whole. Due to universal suffrage, on federal level the DKP had to face strikingly decreased significance. In the 1878 federal election, it gained 13.0% of the votes cast and entered the Reichstag parliament with 59 deputies. Afterwards, the party, which furthermore lost votes as Germans moved from rural areas to new industrial centers in the west (&quot;Ostflucht&quot;), forged an electoral alliance with the Christian Social Party under Adolf Stoecker, opportunistically embracing antisemitism. 

Thomas Childers stated that the Conservatives were the first major party in Germany to incorporate antisemitism into its platform. The 1892 party program denounced a &quot;demoralizing Jewish influence&quot;, but when this attitude failed to halt the party&#x27;s fall in the polls this element was de-emphasized. Stoecker finally revoked the alliance in 1896.

Though predominantly Protestant, the DKP opposed the &quot;Kulturkampf&quot;, but supported Bismarck when during the Long Depression he began to implement protectionist policies by restricting grain imports from Russia and the United States. Following this, the DKP strongly opposed the New Course of his successor Leo von Caprivi. It also withdrew its confidence in Chancellor Bernhard von Bülow in 1909 when he tried to implement an inheritance tax reform; Bülow resigned following the reform&#x27;s failure. The party supported Kaiser Wilhelm II&#x27;s naval policies and Germany&#x27;s arms race with the United Kingdom but initially kept its distance towards colonialism and the activists of the Pan-German League.

The party was dissolved following the fall of the monarchy in November 1918 and the German Revolution. Most of its supporters turned to the newly established German National People&#x27;s Party. The &quot;Deutschkonservative Partei&quot; had no direct connection to the &quot;Deutsche Rechtspartei&quot; founded in 1946, which used the name &quot;Deutsche Konservative Partei&quot; (German Conservative Party) in parts of West Germany.

Members were for example Wilhelm von Rauchhaupt, Otto von Manteuffel, Ernst von Heydebrand und der Lasa, Kuno von Westarp, Hans Hugo von Kleist-Retzow, Philipp von Nathusius-Ludom, Elard von Oldenburg-Januschau, Hans von Kanitz, Heinrich von Salisch, Georg Oertel, Gustav von Goßler or Wilhelm Joachim von Hammerstein.

<text>The Free Conservative Party (, FKP) was a liberal-conservative political party in Prussia and the German Empire which ran as the German Reich Party (, DRP) in the federal elections to the Reichstag beginning in 1871.

The party was formed when it split from the Prussian Conservative Party in 1866. It was a minimally organized &quot;party of notables&quot; whose members came largely from the wealthier upper classes. Politically, the Free Conservatives stood between the German Conservative Party and the National Liberal Party. During the chancellorship of Otto von Bismarck, it generally gave him its strong support, and many of its members were ministers and diplomats. After Wilhelm II became emperor in 1888, the party lost a significant portion of its earlier strength. It took a staunchly nationalist stance during World War I and disbanded in 1918 during the early weeks of the German revolution. The majority of its members then joined the right-wing German National People&#x27;s Party.

== History ==
=== Founding and organisation ===
The Free Conservative Party split from the Prussian Conservative Party in 1866 as a result of disagreements over Chancellor Otto von Bismarck&#x27;s policies in the wake of the Austro-Prussian War. Unlike the original party, the Free Conservatives supported the territorial annexations that led to the founding of the North German Confederation under Prussia&#x27;s leadership. They also favoured the advancement of commerce and industry and trusted that Bismarck would incorporate elements of modernity into Prussia&#x27;s tradition of authoritarian rule. On 28 July 1866, along with some members of the Old Liberals, they formed the Free Conservative Association, which within the year renamed itself the Free Conservative Party. After the founding of the German Empire in 1871, the party ran in the Reichstag elections as the German Reich Party ().

The party was poorly organised internally and consisted of little more than the party contingents in the Reichstag and the Prussian &quot;Landtag&quot;. To establish a connection between the two, a national committee was formed in 1870, but it was not particularly active. Its office in Berlin was staffed by only one person. Before 1890 there was no official party leader, and the first party conference did not take place until 1906. Beginning in 1907, the official party structure consisted of an electoral association which was led by an executive board and committee. In the party&#x27;s later phase, regional associations were established as well.

The party newspaper was , which switched allegiance to the anti-government Pan-German camp in 1910.

=== Party manifesto ===
The Free Conservatives had no fixed party program until 1906; before then its founding manifesto, presented on 27 October 1867, served in place of one. The manifesto expressed only high-level political tenets. It saw the North German Confederation as an &quot;extension of the Prussian monarchy&quot; and praised its accomplishments as an absolute monarchical power, but then went on to say that absolutism&#x27;s time had ended. The Confederation&#x27;s people needed to have a part in determining their own destiny, and &quot;the monarchy itself requires the cooperation of the people in order to fulfil its lofty mission&quot;. The party believed in a constitution but opposed the separation of powers:We honour the state constitution as a source of strength for the monarchy, as an unfolding of popular customs and traditions, as the guarantor of the freedom of the church, of the equality of confessions, of the separation of political rights from religious faith. We also fight the antiquated doctrine of separation of powers; we counter that notion confidently with the principle of the communal exercise of unified state authority.The manifesto stated that the party would support both federal and state governments when their policies placed the national interest first but would, &quot;with true loyalty to king and Fatherland&quot;, uphold free conservative principles when a government&#x27;s policies parted from them.

=== Membership ===
The Free Conservative Party was a &quot;party of notables&quot; (), a party whose members came largely from the wealthy upper class and (educated middle class) and were able to participate in politics because of their financial independence. Many were high-ranking civil servants, military men, university professors and representatives of trade and industry. Because its members filled a large number of posts as ministers and state undersecretaries, it was sometimes referred to as the party of &quot;ministers and diplomats&quot;. Rather than exercising policy influence through a party apparatus, it did so through personal contacts, including many at the imperial court.&quot;&quot; In the 1867 Reichstag it was represented by three princes, two dukes, nine counts and eleven barons. Its leading members were the landowner Wilhelm von Kardorff and mining industrialist Carl Ferdinand von Stumm. Geographically it had particular strengths in Silesia and Prussia&#x27;s Rhine Province. The party had close ties to the nationalist Pan-German League (founded in 1891) and the German Agrarian League (1893).

=== Policies ===
Politically, the Free Conservatives stood between the National Liberals and the German Conservative Party. As a decidedly pro-government party, they supported Bismarck&#x27;s anti-Catholic &quot;Kulturkampf&quot; and, as the party of the elites, his Anti-Socialist Laws. In 1878 it was the driving force behind the shift towards a protective tariff policy. With support from some members of the German Conservative Party, the Free Conservatives opposed Bismarck when he ended the &quot;Kulturkampf&quot; and began to introduce social reforms such as health insurance for workers. They wanted to see the Anti-Socialist Laws strengthened and advocated a stronger military and more colonisation. From 1887 to 1890 (the final years of Bismarck&#x27;s chancellorship), it was one of the cartel parties – an electoral alliance of the Free Conservatives, the German Conservative Party and the National Liberals – which Bismarck saw as his only reliable source of support. With the cartel in the majority following the 1887 Reichstag election, it was able to push through the second seven-year military budget (septennate) that Bismarck wanted.

At the beginning of the Wilhelmine era (1890–1918), the party lost 22 seats in the 1890 Reichstag election, dropping from 41 to 19. It never recovered its former strength; the greatest number of seats it was able to achieve afterwards was 28 in the 1893 election. The party continued to oppose moves towards parliamentarisation but was open to changes in the Prussian three-class franchise, which weighted votes by the amount of taxes paid, as long as they did not lead to an equal, universal manhood voting system such as was used in elections to the national Reichstag.

During the First World War, the party advocated annexationist war aims, opposed the Reichstag&#x27;s 1917 peace resolution and supported the militaristic German Fatherland Party after it was founded in 1917. On 13 December 1918, during the early weeks of the German revolution, the executive board of the Free Conservatives advised party members to join the right-wing German National People&#x27;s Party (DNVP), effectively disbanding the 52-year-old party.

<text>Jump, Little Children is an American indie rock band that formed in 1991 in Winston-Salem, North Carolina, United States. Known for its unique sound, energetic live performances, and willingness to interact with fans, the band has a devoted following and is a fixture in the Charleston, South Carolina music scene. The name &quot;Jump, Little Children&quot; is taken from a song written by blues musician Leroy Dallas and covered by Sonny Terry and Brownie McGhee.

==History==
===1991–1994: Formation===
Jay Clifford, Matthew Bivins, Ward Williams, and Christopher Pollen met and formed Jump, Little Children at the North Carolina School of the Arts in Winston-Salem, North Carolina in 1991. The band played its first show on January 1, 1992 as part of a New Year&#x27;s Day festival in downtown Winston-Salem.

The group was performing Irish music, and Clifford, Bivins, and Pollen traveled to Ireland to learn their craft firsthand during the winter of 1992. Upon their return, Evan Bivins left the School of the Arts to join the band, and the quartet decided to move to Boston, Massachusetts. As they worked to finance the move, the band spent the summer of 1993 in Charleston, SC, where they met future member Jonathan Gray. After arriving in Boston in late 1993, Jump, Little Children recorded and released a self-titled cassette featuring original songs and traditional Irish works. Pollen then left the group to join a religious community, and Clifford and the Bivins brothers returned to Charleston in the summer of 1994.

===1995–1999: &quot;The Licorice Tea Demos&quot;, &quot;Buzz&quot;, and &quot;Magazine&quot;===
Gray and Williams joined the lineup soon thereafter and the band was frequently found busking on the corner of Church and Market Streets in Charleston. Their Irish influences began to blend with an alternative rock sound, and the public took notice. Jump, Little Children recorded and released &quot;The Licorice Tea Demos&quot; in early 1995 and toured the Southeast with vigor. They continued to gain local notoriety and received regional radio airplay for the song &quot;Quiet.&quot; Regular touring continued throughout 1996 and 1997, including the first of what would become a yearly tradition: New Year&#x27;s shows at the Dock Street Theatre in Charleston.

&quot;Buzz&quot;, a live EP, was released in early 1997, and the band was courted by various record labels. The group eventually chose Breaking Records (a subsidiary of Atlantic Records started by Hootie and the Blowfish) in 1998. Jump, Little Children&#x27;s only album released under Breaking Records, &quot;Magazine&quot;, was recorded during the summer of 1998 with producer Brad Jones. &quot;Magazine&quot; was released in the fall of 1998, and the single &quot;Cathedrals&quot; achieved radio play nationwide over the following year.

===2000–2005: &quot;Vertigo&quot; and &quot;Between The Dim &amp; The Dark&quot;===
Looking to build on the success of &quot;Cathedrals,&quot; the band reentered the studio in the fall of 2000 to record &quot;Vertigo&quot;. Produced by Clifford and Brad Wood and mixed by David Leonard, the album was originally due to be released in May 2001, but was put on hold when Breaking Records was dropped from the Atlantic roster. The rights to &quot;Vertigo&quot; were given to Breaking, and after a fierce struggle, Jump, Little Children was able to release the album on their own imprint, EZ Chief Records, in September 2001. &quot;Vertigo&quot; reached No. 44 on the Billboard Top Independent Albums chart.

The band regrouped over 2002 and 2003, expanding their touring to include the Midwest and West Coast and recording and releasing a DVD titled &quot;Live At The Music Farm&quot;. They also expanded EZ Chief Records, launching a website where users could create custom CDs using tracks from independent artists. In the summer of 2003, the band took its first hiatus, but soon returned with an abbreviated name, &quot;Jump,&quot; and plans for another album, &quot;Between The Dim &amp; The Dark&quot;. Produced by Rick Beato and released on Brash Music in April 2004, the album was well received. &quot;Between The Glow &amp; The Light&quot;, an EP of B-sides to &quot;Between The Dim &amp; The Dark&quot;, was released in April 2005.

On June 16, 2005, the band announced that the tenth annual Dock Street Theatre shows at end of 2005 would mark their split. The final show was a black tie affair in Charleston on December 30, 2005, and featured material from each of the member&#x27;s future projects. The show ended with the band and audience walking from the theatre to the corner of Church and Market Streets for a busking session typical of the band&#x27;s early years. &quot;Jump, Little Children&quot; was the last song played. During the final show, Amanda Kapousouz announced the formation of a scholarship fund at the College of Charleston in honor of the band.

===2006–2015: Hiatus===
&quot;Live at the Dock Street Theatre&quot;, a double live album, was released in 2006 and would be the band&#x27;s last recording for more than ten years. Over the next decade, the bandmates spread out across the country and pursued their own artistic interests. Finally, in a May 2014 interview, Jay Clifford hinted at a reunion: &quot;I can neither confirm, nor deny, a Jump, Little Children reunion tour in 2015.&quot;

===2015–2018: Reunion===
On March 13, 2015, the band&#x27;s new website announced the eleventh installment of Dock Street by displaying a countdown to December 28, 2015. A full reunion tour (the &quot;Church and Queen Tour&quot;) was announced in May 2015 and consisted of four club dates followed by two nights of Dock Street. The demand for the six shows was overwhelming, with both nights of Dock Street selling out in less than one minute, and the band responded by adding three more club dates.

Bringing the &quot;Jump&quot; community back together was an emotional experience for both the band and its audiences. After such a successful reunion, discussion once again turned to the future. Matt Bivins wrote, &quot;Nothing is set right now. We know that we don’t want to be in a rock band again, full-time. We want anything we work on together to be special. We don’t want to forget again why we started this band in the first place: because we were friends that loved working together, creating music together, having fun.&quot;

On November 10, 2016, Jump, Little Children announced that it would participate in the High Water Festival organized by Shovels &amp; Rope. In addition, the band announced another short Southeastern tour scheduled for April 2017.

===2018–2022: &quot;Sparrow&quot; and &quot;Foundering&quot;===
In January 2018, the band announced they would be releasing their first full-length album in more than 13 years. The new album, titled &quot;Sparrow&quot;, was released on Friday, September 14, 2018. The first single off &quot;Sparrow,&quot; &quot;Hand on My Heartache&quot;, was released as a lyric video via the website of music magazine &quot;American Songwriter&quot; on August 16, 2018.

On October 5, 2021, Matt and Evan Bivins announced that they would be leaving the band to focus on building a company together, while the remaining three members would continue to perform under the name Jump, Little Children. The band&#x27;s sixth studio album, &quot;Foundering&quot;, was recorded in Nashville, Tennessee in March 2022 and released on September 23, 2022. Prior to the release, the band announced that the album and accompanying tour would both be the last. A 15-date &quot;Farewell Tour&quot; spanned the Southeast and featured Christina Cone on vocals and keyboard and Josh Kaler on drums. The tour concluded with back-to-back shows in Charleston, SC, with the band&#x27;s final show at the Charleston Music Hall on December 30, 2022.

<doc id="726508" wikidata="Q20825977" url="?curid=726508" title="Liar's dice">
<text>Liar&#x27;s dice is a class of dice games for two or more players in which deception is a significant gameplay element. In &quot;single hand&quot; liar&#x27;s dice games, each player is given a set of dice, all players roll once, and the bids relate to the dice each player can see (their hand) plus all the concealed dice (the other players&#x27; hands). In &quot;common hand&quot; games, there is one set of dice which is passed from player to player. The bids relate to the dice as they are in front of the bidder after selected dice have been re-rolled. Originating during the 15th century, the game subsequently spread to Latin American and European countries. In 1993, a variant, &quot;Call My Bluff&quot;, won the Spiel des Jahres. 

== Background ==
&quot;Liar&#x27;s dice&quot; originated as a bluffing board game titled Dudo during the 15th century from the Inca Empire, and subsequently spread to Latin American countries. The game later spread to European countries via Spanish conquistadors. In the 1970s, numerous commercial versions of the game were released.

==Single hand==

Five dice are used per player with dice cups used for concealment.

Each round, each player rolls a &quot;hand&quot; of dice under their cup and looks at their hand while keeping it concealed from the other players. The first player begins bidding, announcing any face value and the minimum number of dice that the player believes are showing that value, under all of the cups in the game. Ones are often wild, always counting as the face of the current bid.

Turns rotate among the players in a clockwise order. Each player has two choices during their turn: to make a higher bid, or challenge the previous bid – typically with a call of &quot;liar&quot;. Raising the bid means either increasing the quantity, or the face value, or both, according to the specific bidding rules used. There are many variants of allowed and disallowed bids; common bidding variants, given a previous bid of an arbitrary quantity and face value, include:

* the player may bid a higher quantity of any particular face, or the same quantity of a higher face (allowing a player to &quot;re-assert&quot; a face value they believe prevalent if another player increased the face value on their bid);
* the player may bid a higher quantity of the same face, or any particular quantity of a higher face (allowing a player to &quot;reset&quot; the quantity);
* the player may bid a higher quantity of the same face or the same quantity of a higher face (the most restrictive; a reduction in either face value or quantity is usually not allowed).

If the current player challenges the previous bid, all dice are revealed. If the bid is valid (at least as many of the face value and any wild aces are showing as were bid), the bidder wins. Otherwise, the challenger wins. The player who loses a round loses one of their dice. The last player to still retain a die (or dice) is the winner. The loser of the last round starts the bidding on the next round. If the loser of the last round was eliminated, the next player starts the new round.

===Dice odds===
For a given number of unknown dice &quot;n&quot;, the probability that &quot;exactly&quot; a certain quantity &quot;q&quot; of any face value are showing, &quot;P(q)&quot;, is

:formula_1

Where &quot;C(n,q)&quot; is the number of unique subsets of &quot;q&quot; dice out of the set of &quot;n&quot; unknown dice. In other words, the number of dice with any particular face value follows the binomial distribution formula_2.

For the same n, the probability &quot;P&#x27;(q)&quot; that &quot;at least q&quot; dice are showing a given face is the sum of &quot;P(x)&quot; for all &quot;x&quot; such that &quot;q ≤ x ≤ n&quot;, or

:formula_3

These equations can be used to calculate and chart the probability of exactly &quot;q&quot; and at least &quot;q&quot; for any or multiple &quot;n&quot;. For most purposes, it is sufficient to know the following facts of dice probability:

* The expected quantity of any face value among a number of unknown dice is one-sixth the total unknown dice.
* A bid of the expected quantity (or twice the expected value when playing with wilds), rounded down, has a greater than 50% chance of being correct and the highest chance of being exactly correct.

==Common hand==
The &quot;Common hand&quot; version is for two players. The first caller is determined at random. Both players then roll their dice at the same time, and examine their hands. Hands are called in style similar to poker, and the game may be played with poker dice:

One player calls their hand. The other player may either call a higher-ranking hand, call the bluff, or re-roll some or all of their dice. When a bluff is called, the accused bluffer reveals their dice and the winner is determined.

==Commercial versions==

*1987, Milton Bradley published its own version of &quot;Liar&#x27;s Dice&quot;.
*1993 &quot;Call My Bluff&quot;, by F.X. Schmid and designer Richard Borg, was a remake of the original game then in public domain. It won the 1993 Spiel des Jahres, with the jury praising its entertainment and describing the rules as uncomplicated. &quot;Bluff&quot; also placed third on the Deutscher Spiele Preis awards.

<text>Callahan&#x27;s Place is a fictional bar with strongly community-minded and empathetic clientele, part of the fictional universe of American writer Spider Robinson. It appears in the Callahan&#x27;s Crosstime Saloon stories (compiled in the first novel of the same name) along with its sequels &quot;Time Travelers Strictly Cash&quot; and &quot;Callahan&#x27;s Secret&quot;; most of the beloved barflies appear in the further sequels &quot;The Callahan Touch&quot;, &quot;Callahan&#x27;s Legacy&quot;, &quot;Callahan&#x27;s Key&quot;, and &quot;Callahan&#x27;s Con&quot;, and the computer game.

==Synopsis==
In the book, the fictional bar is run by Mike Callahan. The regulars are welcoming and willing to listen to any visitor&#x27;s problems, no matter how strange, but they do not snoop if a visitor is unwilling to share. Strange visitors and unusual events turn up frequently in the stories. Regulars at Callahan&#x27;s include a talking dog, several extraterrestrials and time travelers, an ethical vampire, a couple of Irish mythological beings, and a parrot spewing obscenities. The stories make heavy use of puns. Irish whiskeys are the preferred beverage, with Tullamore Dew and Bushmills mentioned in nearly every collection of shorts or novel that references the saloon. The stories make an obvious homage to Fletcher Pratt and L. Sprague de Camp&#x27;s &quot;Tales from Gavagan&#x27;s Bar&quot; and Arthur C. Clarke&#x27;s &quot;Tales from the White Hart&quot;.

In the book, Lady Sally McGee, the madam of a house of excellent repute (and Mike Callahan&#x27;s wife), stars in Robinson&#x27;s &quot;Callahan&#x27;s Lady&quot; and &quot;Lady Slings the Booze.&quot; The regulars at Lady Sally&#x27;s brothel (where the employees are &quot;artists&quot; and the patrons are &quot;clients&quot;) insist on the same empathy and humor as those at Callahan&#x27;s, and they are just as likely to have fantastic backgrounds. Relatedly, nobody in Lady Sally&#x27;s is forced into anything they are unwilling to do.

This is the source of Callahan&#x27;s Law (also known as the Law of Conservation of Pain and Joy): &quot;Shared pain is lessened; shared joy, increased—thus do we refute entropy.&quot; Stated another way: &quot;Just as there are Laws of Conservation of Matter and Energy, so there are Laws of Conservation of Pain and Joy. Neither can ever be created or destroyed. But one can be converted into the other.&quot;

==Characters==
* Jake Stonebender: The narrator of the Callahan stories. He has tried to commit suicide after losing his wife and daughter to a car accident which he believes to be his fault. His physician, Doc Webster, saved him and sent him to Callahan&#x27;s. Jake is a master with his guitar, whom he calls &quot;Lady Macbeth&quot;.
* Mike Callahan: In the book, he is the owner of the bar, he is always ready with a drink and a friendly word—though he will also deal quite firmly with anyone who deliberately breaks the bar&#x27;s rules.
* Sam &quot;Doc&quot; Webster: M.D.; In the book, he is one of the oldest regulars and a master of puns. He works shifts at Smithtown General Hospital.
* Fast Eddie Costigan: In the book, he is the bar&#x27;s piano player; he jams with Jake and is equipped with a blackjack to discourage nosy questions.
* Long Drink McGonnigle: In the book, he is one of the oldest regulars; a night watchman, and also skilled at puns.
* Tom Hauptman: In the book, he is an ex-minister and widower, who was locked away for ten years with his wife in a Latin American banana republic. He believes missing out on ten years of sociological development means he cannot do his job. Callahan offers him the job of assistant bartender after he tells his story.
* Noah Gonzalez: In the book he is a sergeant in the police force who has a prosthetic leg. He works on the bomb squad.
* Michael &quot;Mickey&quot; Finn: In the book, he is a humanoid alien who was sent to destroy Earth. Coming to Callahan&#x27;s makes him want to reconsider; with the assistance of the patrons, he can become his being and save the planet.
* Tommy Janssen: In the book, he is a teenager who comes to Callahan&#x27;s and gives up his heroin addiction.
* Tom Flannery: In the book, he is one of the former regulars who has eight months to live at the start of the series.
* &quot;Slippery&quot; Joe Maser: In the book, he is bigamous; both wives are aware of one another and approve of the arrangement.
* Marty Matthias: In the book, he had a gambling issue, but got it fixed after he came to Callahan&#x27;s.
* Rachel: In the book, she is a woman, which is a rarity in itself at Callahan&#x27;s. She may also be immortal but is long-lived at the very least.
* Shorty Steinitz: In the book, he had his appendix removed by Doc Webster on Callahan&#x27;s bar. World&#x27;s worst driver; makes a living restoring antique vehicles.
* Big Beef McCaffrey: In the book, he was kicked out of the bar in 1947 by Mike Callahan, without opening the solid oak door first. The door has remained unmended as a reminder. Mentioned, but does not appear in any of the stories.
* Mary Callahan Finn: In the book, she is Mike Callahan&#x27;s daughter; a blacksmith. The love of Jake Stonebender&#x27;s life and the wife of Mickey Finn.
* Ralph Von Wau Wau: In the book, he is a mutant talking dog and a regular customer. Regular at Lady Sally&#x27;s, and a skilled ventriloquist. Often a moral barometer for newcomers: accepting Ralph as a sentient being worthy of respect is considered a final test for acceptance by the Callahan &quot;family&quot;.
* Spider Robinson: In the book, author Spider Robinson appeared in one of the &quot;Callahan&#x27;s&quot; stories as himself. When a patron asked Jake for &quot;a double&quot;, Robinson appeared, as Jake looks exactly like him. Within the context of the series, Robinson lives in a different &quot;ficton&quot; (fictional universe) and has made his living as an author by writing down the stories that Jake tells him of his adventures at Callahan&#x27;s, whenever the two meet by crossing over into the other&#x27;s fiction.

==Stories==
&quot;Callahan&#x27;s Crosstime Saloon&quot; contains the following stories, virtually all of which were published in &quot;Analog Science Fiction and Fact&quot;:

* &quot;The Guy with the Eyes&quot;
* &quot;The Time-Traveler&quot;
* &quot;The Centipede&#x27;s Dilemma&quot;
* &quot;Two Heads Are Better Than One&quot;

&quot;Time Travelers Strictly Cash&quot; contains four Callahan stories and several non-Callahan stories and essays.

&quot;Callahan&#x27;s Secret&quot; contains four Callahan stories; there is only Callahan material.

In 1987 Phantasia Press published a 1500-copy hardcover edition of &quot;Callahan and Company&quot; (ISBN 0-932096-48-4) which reprints the 18 Callahan&#x27;s stories that appeared in the three previous books.

&quot;Callahan&#x27;s Legacy&quot; contains three sections that were not separately published as stories.

All of the later works appeared as individual novels.

Some elements of &quot;Callahan&#x27;s Lady&quot; and &quot;Lady Slings the Booze&quot; have been separately published in &quot;Pulphouse&quot;.

==Other versions==
In 1997 Legend Entertainment released a graphic adventure game for the PC (&quot;Callahan&#x27;s Crosstime Saloon&quot;), designed by Josh Mandel (of &quot;Freddy Pharkas: Frontier Pharmacist&quot; fame), based on the series. The player controls Jake Stonebender (narrator of the books) through a series of bizarre adventures. Included in the game are several songs performed by Spider Robinson himself; these can be heard by talking to the pianist in the bar and asking for &quot;one of your specialties&quot;.

The series has also been adapted as a setting for the &quot;GURPS&quot; roleplaying game covering the material of the first three Callahan&#x27;s books and the first Lady Sally book.

<text>Aguascalientes is a state in North Central Mexico that is divided into eleven municipalities. According to the 2020 Mexican census, Aguascalientes is the sixth least populous state with inhabitants and the fourth smallest by land area spanning .

Municipalities in Aguascalientes are administratively autonomous of the state according to the 115th article of the 1917 Constitution of Mexico. Their legal framework derives from the state Constitution and the 2003 Municipal Law for the State of Aguascalientes. Every three years, citizens elect a municipal president (Spanish: &quot;presidente municipal&quot;) by a plurality voting system who heads a concurrently elected municipal council (&quot;ayuntamiento&quot;) responsible for providing all the public services for their constituents. The municipal council consists of a variable number of trustees and councillors (&quot;regidores y síndicos&quot;). Title 9 of the Municipal Law provides for the establishment of unipersonal auxiliary authorities (&quot;autoridades auxiliares&quot;) to represent local communities in the municipalities.

Municipalities are responsible for public services (such as water and sewerage), street lighting, public safety, traffic, and the maintenance of public parks, gardens and cemeteries. They may also assist the state and federal governments in education, emergency fire and medical services, environmental protection and maintenance of monuments and historical landmarks. Since 1984, they have had the power to collect property taxes and user fees, although more funds are obtained from the state and federal governments than from their own income.

The largest municipality by population is the state capital Aguascalientes, with 948,990 residents or approximately of the state population. The smallest municipality by population is San José de Gracia with 9,552 residents. The largest municipality by land area is also Aguascalientes which spans , and the smallest is Cosío which spans . The first municipality to incorporate was Asientos on and the newest municipality is San Francisco de los Romo which incorporated .

<doc id="726515" wikidata="Q5697015" url="?curid=726515" title="Hector the Hero">
<text>&quot;Hector the Hero&quot; is a classic lament penned by Scottish composer and fiddler James Scott Skinner in 1903. It was written as a tribute to Major-General Hector MacDonald, a distinguished Scottish general around the turn of the century. MacDonald, a friend of Skinner&#x27;s, had not long before committed suicide after false accusations and charges against him. 

As it is a lament, it is played slowly and sadly, often using instruments such as the violin, piano, guitar or bagpipes. It has been covered by many artists since its release, and is still reasonably well known today.

As it was written in 1903, the lyrics, by Thomas McWilliam, and music to &quot;Hector the Hero&quot; have passed into the public domain.

==Lyrics==

:Lament him, ye mountains of Ross-shire;
:Your tears be the dew and the rain;
:Ye forests and straths, let the sobbing winds
:Unburden your grief and pain.
:Lament him, ye warm-hearted clansmen,
:And mourn for a kinsman so true
:The pride of the Highlands, the valiant MacDonald
:Will never come back to you.

:O, wail for the mighty in battle,
:Loud lift ye the Coronach strain;
:For Hector, the Hero, of deathless fame,
:Will never come back again.

:Lament him, ye sons of old Scotia,
:Ye kinsmen on many a shore;
:A patriot-warrior, fearless of foe,
:Has fallen to rise no more.

:O cherish his triumph and glory
:On Omdurman&#x27;s death-stricken plain,
:His glance like the eagle&#x27;s, his heart like the lion&#x27;s
:His laurels a nation&#x27;s gain.

:O, wail for the mighty in battle,
:Loud lift ye the Coronach strain;
:For Hector, the Hero, of deathless fame,
:Will never come back again.

:O rest thee, brave heart, in thy slumber,
:Forgotten shall ne&#x27;er be thy name;
:The love and the mercy of Heaven be thine;
:Our love thou must ever claim.
:To us thou art Hector the Hero,
:The chivalrous, dauntless, and true;
:The hills and the glens, and the hearts of a nation,
:Re-echo the wail for you.

:O, wail for the mighty in battle,
:Loud lift ye the Coronach strain;
:For Hector, the Hero, of deathless fame,
:Will never come back again.

<doc id="726516" wikidata="Q7160737" url="?curid=726516" title="Peggy Shippen">
<text>Margaret Shippen (July 11, 1760 – August 24, 1804) was the second wife of General Benedict Arnold. She has been described as &quot;the highest-paid spy in the American Revolution&quot;.

Shippen was born into a prominent Philadelphia family with Loyalist tendencies. She met Arnold during his tenure as military commander of the city following the British withdrawal in 1778. They were married in the Shippen townhouse on Fourth Street on April 8, 1779, and Arnold began conspiring with the British to change sides soon after. Peggy played a role in the conspiracy which was exposed after British Major John André was arrested in September 1780 carrying documents concerning the planned surrender of the critical Continental Army base at West Point.

Arnold escaped to New York City and Peggy followed. They traveled together to London at the end of 1781, where she established a home and Arnold rebuilt a trading business. In 1787, she joined him in Saint John, New Brunswick, where his difficulties with local businessmen forced them to return to London in December 1791. Arnold died in 1801, after which she had to settle his business affairs and pay off his debts. She died in 1804, having borne seven children, five of whom survived infancy.

==Early life==
Margaret Shippen was born July 11, 1760, in Philadelphia, the fourth and youngest daughter of Edward Shippen IV and Margaret Francis, the daughter of Tench Francis, Sr.; she was nicknamed &quot;Peggy&quot;. She was born into a prominent Philadelphia family, which included two Philadelphia mayors and the founder of Shippensburg, Pennsylvania. Edward Shippen was a judge and member of the Provincial Council of Pennsylvania; the Shippen family was politically divided, and the judge was considered either a &quot;Neutralist&quot; or a covert &quot;Tory &quot; with allegiance to the British crown. Two younger boys died in infancy, and Peggy grew up as the baby of the family and was the &quot;family&#x27;s darling&quot;.

As a young woman, she enjoyed music, doing needlework, and drawing, and participated in the study of politics. She looked up to her father and, under his tutelage, learned about politics, finance, and the forces which led to the American Revolution.

==Courtship and marriage to Benedict Arnold==

The British captured Philadelphia in September 1777, and the Shippen family held social gatherings at their home, in keeping with their political interests and stations. A frequent guest was John André, an officer in General William Howe&#x27;s command, and he paid particular attention to Peggy. The British withdrew from the city in June 1778 following France&#x27;s entry into the war; André left Philadelphia with his fellow troops, but the two of them remained in contact.

In late summer of 1778, Shippen met Arnold, the Continental military commander of Philadelphia, and he began courting her despite the differences between himself and Judge Shippen. Shortly after, Arnold sent her father a letter asking for her hand, but Shippen was skeptical of Arnold due to Arnold&#x27;s legal problems. In 1779, the Supreme Executive Council of Pennsylvania had brought eight formal charges against Arnold for corruption and malfeasance with the money of the federal and state governments, and he was subsequently convicted on two relatively minor counts. Despite this, Edward Shippen eventually granted permission for Arnold and Peggy to marry, which took place on April 8, 1779.

Arnold purchased Mount Pleasant on March 22, 1779, a manor home built in 1762 for Captain John Macpherson, and he deeded the property to Peggy and any future children. The couple did not live at Mount Pleasant, however, but rented it out as an income property. The couple honeymooned at family homes in New Jersey and Pennsylvania, then returned to Philadelphia to take residence at Arnold&#x27;s military headquarters in the Masters-Penn mansion.

==Espionage between the Arnolds and Major John André==
As a newlywed, Peggy may have had contact with her &quot;dear friend&quot; Major André, who had become General Clinton&#x27;s spy chief. She and Arnold also had close friends who were either actively Loyalist or sympathetic to that cause. Some historians believe that Peggy Shippen instigated the correspondence between Arnold and André and sent military secrets to the British before her wedding. Other suspects in Arnold&#x27;s subsequent espionage ring with André were Loyalists Rev. Jonathan Odell and Joseph Stansbury.

Arnold hired Joseph Stansbury to initiate communications in May 1779, offering his services to the British not long after he married. General Clinton gave Major André orders to pursue the possibility, and secret communications began between André and Arnold. The messages that they exchanged were sometimes transmitted through Peggy&#x27;s actions; letters written in her hand also include coded communications written by Benedict Arnold in invisible ink.
Enraged by his treatment in Philadelphia, General Arnold resigned his command there in March 1779. Pursuant to the secret communications with the British, he sought and obtained the command of West Point, a critical American defense post in the highlands of the Hudson River. Peggy and their infant son Edward Shippen Arnold (born 19 Mar 1780) joined him there in a home on the Hudson two miles south of West Point. General Arnold systematically weakened the defenses of West Point with the intent of making it easier for the British to capture.

On Thursday, September 21, 1780, General Arnold met with André on the shores of the Hudson River and gave him documents and maps about the fortifications at West Point in anticipation of the British capture of that site. On Saturday, September 23, André was arrested as he rode towards British territory, the documents were discovered, and the plot was exposed. On Monday, September 25, Arnold received a note announcing André&#x27;s capture and possession of treasonous papers and maps. That same morning, General George Washington was planning to meet Arnold at his home, two miles south of West Point. Arnold first dashed upstairs to Peggy, then fled, eventually reaching HMS &quot;Vulture&quot; on the Hudson River.

Peggy Shippen Arnold was then dressing in anticipation of hosting a breakfast for Washington and his party. Possibly based on a brief discussion with her husband, she faked insanity in order to convince General Washington and his staff that she had nothing to do with her husband&#x27;s betrayal. Before beginning her histrionics, however, she burned all letters and evidence in her possession related to the plot. She then disarrayed her hair before beginning to scream incoherently, wearing too few clothes &quot;to be seen even by gentlemen of the family, much less by many strangers&quot;, in the words of one observer. Peggy accused Washington and others of being part of a plot to kill her child and begged for his life, appearing alternately frantic and catatonic. Peggy&#x27;s dramatics—described by the author Nancy Rubin Stuart as &quot;the grandest theatrical performance of her life&quot;—completely fooled Washington and his aide Alexander Hamilton, who believed her innocent.

The delay caused by her histrionics may have allowed Arnold time to escape, leaving Peggy with their infant son. Fearing for her safety, she traveled to Philadelphia to stay with her family. She also played the innocent when asked about her husband, even though she knew his whereabouts. Philadelphia authorities soon found a letter from André to Peggy written from British-occupied New York—the so-called &quot;millinery letter&quot;—and seized upon it as proof that Arnold&#x27;s wife had been complicitous in the treason. That led the Supreme Executive Council of Pennsylvania to banish her from Philadelphia. In November 1780, her father escorted Peggy and her infant son to the shores of the Hudson where she boarded a boat to New York City to join Arnold.

After a military trial, Major André was condemned to death as a common spy and was hanged at Tappan, New York. He was later re-interred in London&#x27;s Westminster Abbey.

==After the Revolution==
Hostilities appeared to be winding down in North America after Cornwallis&#x27; surrender at Yorktown in October 1781, and the Arnolds left for London on December 15, 1781—including their second child James Robertson (born in August)—arriving January 22, 1782.

Peggy was initially welcomed warmly in Great Britain, as was her husband; she was presented at English court to the queen on February 10, 1782, by Lady Amherst. Queen Charlotte awarded her an annuity of 100 pound sterling for the maintenance of her children, including those not yet born. King George III also presented her with £350 &quot;obtained for her services, which were meritorious&quot;. A girl (Margaret) and a boy (George), born in 1783 and 1784 respectively, died in infancy while the Arnolds lived in London.

Arnold left for a business opportunity in 1784 and sent to Connecticut for his three sons Benedict, Richard, and Henry (by his first wife) to join him in Saint John, New Brunswick. During Arnold&#x27;s stay in New Brunswick, Peggy Shippen Arnold gave birth to their third surviving child Sophia Matilda Arnold, while her husband may have fathered an illegitimate child (John Sage) in New Brunswick. Peggy sailed to Saint John to join her husband in 1787, leaving her two older sons with a private family in London; in New Brunswick, Peggy gave birth to son George in 1787; their last child William Fitch was born in 1794 after their return to London.

In 1789, she returned briefly to Philadelphia, accompanied by her infant son George and a maid, to visit with her parents and family. She was treated coldly by Philadelphians in spite of her father&#x27;s considerable influence. Peggy sailed back to New Brunswick with young George in the spring of 1790, and from there returned to United Kingdom with Arnold in late December 1791. Their departure was unhappy, with mobs gathering on their property to protest against them and calling them &quot;traitors&quot;.

After Arnold died in 1801, Peggy auctioned the contents of their home, the home itself, and many of her personal possessions to pay off his debts. She died in London in 1804, reportedly of cancer, and was buried with her husband at St. Mary&#x27;s Church in Battersea on August 25, 1804.

==Role in conspiracy==

Historians are unanimous in her complicity—and she accepted a reward for her services from the king. Her family in Philadelphia denied everything. 

James Parton, a biographer of Aaron Burr, published an account in the 19th century, after all of the principal actors had died, implying that Peggy Shippen Arnold had manipulated or persuaded Benedict to change sides. The basis for the claim was interviews that Burr conducted with Theodosia Prevost, the widow of Jacques Marcus Prevost who later married Burr, and notes later made by Burr. While en route to Philadelphia from West Point in 1780, Peggy Shippen Arnold visited Prevost at Paramus, New Jersey. According to Parton, she unburdened herself to Prevost, claiming that she &quot;was heartily tired of all the theatricals she was exhibiting&quot;, referring to her histrionics at West Point. According to Burr&#x27;s notes, Shippen Arnold &quot;was disgusted with the American cause&quot; and &quot;through unceasing perseverance, she had ultimately brought the general into an arrangement to surrender West Point&quot;.

When these allegations were first published, the Shippen family countered with allegations of improper behavior on Burr&#x27;s part. They claimed that Burr rode with Peggy Shippen Arnold in the carriage to Philadelphia after her stay with Mrs. Prevost, and that he fabricated the allegation because she refused advances that he made during the ride. Arnold biographer Willard Sterne Randall suggests that Burr&#x27;s version has a more authentic ring to it: first, Burr waited until all were dead before it could be published; and second, Burr was not in the carriage on the ride to Philadelphia. Randall also notes that ample further evidence has since come to light showing that Peggy Shippen Arnold played an active role in the conspiracy. British documents from 1792 show that Mrs. Arnold was paid £350 for handling secret dispatches.

==Family==

Peggy Shippen had seven children with Benedict Arnold, of whom five survived to adulthood:
*Edward Shippen Arnold (March 19, 1780 – December 13, 1813) Lieutenant, British Army in India; see Bengal Army. Died in Dinajpur, Bengal, India; unmarried and childless.

==In popular culture==
Peggy Shippen is portrayed by Erin McGathy and Winona Ryder in the &quot;Drunk History&quot; episode on Philadelphia. She is also portrayed in the TV miniseries &quot;George Washington&quot; by Megan Gallagher, in the TV movie &quot;Benedict Arnold: A Question of Honor&quot; by Flora Montgomery, and in the Revolutionary War drama &quot;&quot; by Ksenia Solo.

She was voiced by Maria Shriver in the animated series &quot;Liberty&#x27;s Kids&quot;.

Shippen is also the subject of at least four historical novels: &quot;The Exquisite Siren&quot; by E. Irvine Haines (1938), &quot;Peggy&quot; by Lois Duncan (1970), &quot;Finishing Becca&quot; by Ann Rinaldi (1994), and &quot;The Traitor&#x27;s Wife&quot; by Allison Pataki (2014).

<doc id="726521" wikidata="Q112870" url="?curid=726521" title="Archduke Carl Ludwig of Austria (1918–2007)">
<text>Archduke Carl Ludwig of Austria (Carl Ludwig Maria Franz Joseph Michael Gabriel Antonius Robert Stephan Pius Gregor Ignatius Markus d&#x27;Aviano; 10 March 1918 – 11 December 2007), also known as Carl Ludwig Habsburg-Lothringen, was the fifth child of Charles I of Austria and Princess Zita of Bourbon-Parma. He was born in Baden bei Wien and died in Brussels.

==Life==
He studied at the University of Louvain and graduated from Université Laval, in Quebec City where his family was in exile. During the Second World War, Karl Ludwig and his brother Felix volunteered to serve in the 101st Infantry Battalion of the United States Army, known as the &quot;Free Austria Battalion&quot;. However, the battalion was disbanded when a number of exiled Jewish volunteers who made up the majority of the force ultimately declined to confirm their enlistment.

He was buried beside his mother in the Kapuziner Crypt in Vienna.

==Marriage and issue==
He was married in Belœil on 17 January 1950 to Princess Yolande of Ligne (6 May 1923 – 13 September 2023). They had four children:

<text>Baja California is a state in Northwest Mexico that is divided into seven municipalities. According to the 2020 Mexican census, Baja California is the 13th most populous state with inhabitants and the 12th largest by land area spanning .

Municipalities in Baja California are administratively autonomous of the state according to the 115th article of the 1917 Constitution of Mexico. Their legal framework derives from Title VI of the state Constitution and the state&#x27;s 2001 Law of the Municipal Regime. Every three years, citizens elect a municipal president (Spanish: &quot;presidente municipal&quot;) by a plurality voting system who heads a concurrently elected municipal council (&quot;ayuntamiento&quot;) responsible for providing public services for their constituents. The municipal council consists of a variable number of trustees and councillors (&quot;regidores y síndicos&quot;) who govern from the municipal seat. Municipalities are responsible for public services (such as water and sewerage), street lighting, public safety, traffic, and the maintenance of public parks, gardens and cemeteries. They may also assist the state and federal governments in education, emergency fire and medical services, environmental protection and maintenance of monuments and historical landmarks. Since 1984, they have had the power to collect property taxes and user fees, although more funds are obtained from the state and federal governments than from their own income. Municipalities may establish functional and geographical subdivisions called &quot;delegaciones&quot; and &quot;subdelegaciones&quot; in accordance with Article 29 of the Law of the Municipal Regime.

The largest municipality by population in Baja California and in Mexico is Tijuana with 1,922,523 residents, representing around half () of the population of the state. The smallest municipality by population is San Felipe: the areas which now make up San Felipe recorded a population of 18,369 inhabitants in the 2010 Mexican Census. San Quintín, which spans , is the largest municipality by area in the state and in the country. Playas de Rosarito is the smallest municipality by area spanning . The first municipality to incorporate was Ensenada on and the newest municipality is San Felipe which was formed from Ensenada and Mexicali on .

<text>Herbert Hall Turner (13 August 1861 – 20 August 1930) was a British astronomer and seismologist.

==Biography==
Herbert Hall Turner was educated at the Leeds Modern School, Clifton College, Bristol and Trinity College, Cambridge. In 1884 he accepted the post of Chief Assistant at the Royal Greenwich Observatory and stayed there for nine years. In 1893 he became Savilian Professor of Astronomy and Director of the Radcliffe Observatory at Oxford University, a post he held for 37 years until his sudden death in 1930.

He was one of the observers in the Eclipse Expeditions of 1886 and 1887. In seismology, he is credited with the discovery of deep focus earthquakes. He is also credited with coining the word &quot;parsec&quot;.

His 1897 Royal Society candidature citation read:

Secretary of the Royal Astronomical Society. Was Chief Assistant at the Royal Observatory, Greenwich 1884-1894. Author of various papers among which may be mentioned:-
* &quot;On the correction of the Equilibrium theory of tides for the continents&quot; (with G H Darwin, Proc.RS. vol lx)
* &quot;Report of observations of total solar eclipse of Aug 29 1886&quot; (Phil Trans. vol 180A),
* &quot;On Mr Edgeworth&#x27;s method of reducing observations relating to several quantities&quot; (Phil. Mag. Vol24).
* &quot;On Mr Leath&#x27;s Intersects&quot; (Monthly Notices R.A.S. vol xlvi).
* &quot;On observations for coincidence of collimators at Royal Observatory Greenwich&quot; (M, N. Vols xlv and liii).

* &quot;On the reduction of measures of photographic plates&quot; (N.N. vol LiV)
He co-edited the first official history of the Royal Astronomical Society along with John Louis Emil Dreyer, &quot;History of the Royal Astronomical Society 1820–1920 (1923, reprinted 1987)&quot;.

He died of a brain haemorrhage in 1930 at a conference in Stockholm. He had married Agnes Margaret Whyte in 1899; they had one daughter, Ruth.

A few months before Turner&#x27;s death in 1930, the Lowell Observatory announced the discovery of a new planet, and an eleven-year-old Oxford schoolgirl, Venetia Burney, proposed the name Pluto for it to her grandfather Falconer Madan, who was retired from the Bodleian Library. Madan passed the name to Turner, who cabled it to colleagues at the Lowell Observatory in the United States. The new planet was officially named &quot;Pluto&quot; on 24 March 1930.

His portrait, by Catharine Dodgson, hangs at New College, Oxford, at which he held a Professorial Fellowship attached to the Savilian Professor of Astronomy.

<doc id="726552" wikidata="Q363930" url="?curid=726552" title="Geoffrey Burbidge">
<text>Geoffrey Ronald Burbidge (24 September 1925 – 26 January 2010) was an English astronomy professor and theoretical astrophysicist, most recently at the University of California, San Diego. He was married to astrophysicist Margaret Burbidge and was the second author of the influential B2FH paper which she led.

==Early life and education==
Burbidge was born in Chipping Norton, Oxfordshire, a small market town in the Cotswolds, where he attended grammar school. His father, also Geoffrey Ronald Burbidge, was a builder.

He first attended the University of Bristol to study history, but changed to physics, receiving his degree in 1946. In 1947, he went to London and received his PhD from University College London (UCL) in 1950. While at UCL he worked with Professor H. S. W. Massey who was then head of the department of mathematics.

==Career and research==
With his wife Margaret Burbidge he worked at Harvard University, the University of Chicago, and the University of Cambridge, before Margaret obtained work at the California Institute of Technology, while Geoffrey worked at the Mount Wilson Observatory and Palomar Observatory. They both obtained positions at the University of California, San Diego, in 1962. He was the Director of Kitt Peak National Observatory from 1978 to 1984. He was the Editor of the &quot;Annual Review of Astronomy and Astrophysics&quot; from 1974 to 2004.

===B2FH===
In collaboration with American physicist William Fowler and British astronomer Fred Hoyle, he and his wife were co-authors of &quot;Synthesis of the Elements in Stars&quot;, a fundamental paper on stellar nucleosynthesis published in 1957. It is commonly referred to as the B2FH paper after the initial letters of the four authors&#x27; surnames. The paper describes the process of stars burning lighter elements into successively heavier atoms which then are expelled to form other structures in the universe, including other stars and planets.

===Alternative cosmology===
In his late years, Burbidge was known mostly for his alternative cosmology &quot;quasi-steady state theory&quot;, which contradicts the Big Bang theory. According to Burbidge, the universe is oscillatory and as such, expands and contracts periodically over infinite time.

===Awards and honours===
*Warner Prize, with his wife (1959)
*Fellow of the American Physical Society (1988) 
*Bruce Medal (1999)
*Gold Medal of the Royal Astronomical Society, with his wife (2005)
*NAS Award for Scientific Reviewing of the National Academy of Sciences (2007)
*The Asteroid 11753 Geoffburbidge is named after him

==Personal life==
He met Margaret Peachey and they married in 1948.

Burbidge died on 26 January 2010 in La Jolla, California.

<text>The Witches of Eastwick is a 1984 novel by American writer John Updike. A sequel, &quot;The Widows of Eastwick&quot;, was published in 2008.

==Plot==
The story, set in the fictional Rhode Island town of Eastwick in the early 1970s, follows the witches Alexandra Spofford, Jane Smart, and Sukie Rougemont, who acquire their powers after their respective marriages end. Their coven is upset by the arrival of Darryl Van Horne, who buys a neglected mansion outside of town. The mysterious Darryl seduces each of the women, encouraging their creative powers and creating a scandal in the town. The power of the three witches grows, so much so that they unknowingly bewitch the townsfolk they come in contact with. This becomes clear when Sukie&#x27;s lover and boss, Clyde Gabriel, kills his busybody wife Felicia before hanging himself.

The three women share Darryl in relative peace until he unexpectedly marries their young, innocent friend, Jenny, the Gabriels&#x27; daughter. The witches resolve to take revenge by giving her cancer through their magic. Although Alexandra feels remorse for their hex, the spell kills Jenny and Darryl flees town with her younger brother, Chris, apparently his lover. In his wake, he leaves their relationships strained and their sense of self in doubt. Eventually, each summons her ideal man and leaves town.

==Literary significance and criticism==

Updike described his novel as &quot;about female power, a power that patriarchal societies have denied.&quot; Many scholars viewed it as strongly pro-feminist, &quot;an intelligent engagement with feminism, and a rare case of a male novelist writing from women&#x27;s points of view.&quot; Some have expressed concern that the book may be misogynistic, as it seems to reinforce the patriarchal conceptions of women as witches and of women requiring a man for personal growth; others believe that the book may be more of a satire of such ideas.

At the same time, some praised the novel as a departure from Updike&#x27;s previous novels.

==In other media==
===Film===

In 1987, the novel was adapted into a film starring Jack Nicholson as Darryl, Cher as Alexandra, Susan Sarandon as Jane, and Michelle Pfeiffer as Sukie – with considerable differences from the book&#x27;s plot. The film&#x27;s Oscar-nominated score was composed by John Williams.

===Television===
In 1992, a television series pilot aired that was directed by Rick Rosenthal and starred Michael Siberry as Darryl, Ally Walker as Alexandra, Julia Campbell as Jane, and Catherine Mary Stewart as Sukie. It was not picked up as a series.

In 2002, a television series pilot was filmed based on the world created in the book, called simply &quot;Eastwick&quot;. It starred Jason O&#x27;Mara as Darryl, Marcia Cross as Jane, Kelly Rutherford as Alexandra, and Lori Loughlin as Sukie. It was not picked up as a series so only the pilot episode exists.

In 2009, &quot;The Witches of Eastwick&quot; was adapted into a television series on ABC, one entitled &quot;Eastwick&quot;, with Lindsay Price, Jaime Ray Newman and Rebecca Romijn as the three witches. Paul Gross played Darryl. Veronica Cartwright who had played Felicia Alden in the 1987 movie is also in the cast of the series as Bun Waverly. The show was canceled during its first season.

===Musical===

In 2000, the novel was adapted into a stage musical by John Dempsey and Dana P. Rowe, originally staged in London.

In 2002, &quot;The Witches of Eastwick&quot; musical opened in Australia, starring Paul McDermott as Darryl Van Horne, Marina Prior as Jane Smart, Pippa Grandison as Sukie Rougemont and Angela Toohey as Alexandra Spofford.

In 2007, the stage musical had its American debut at the Signature Theatre in Arlington, Virginia.

<text>War Is a Racket is a speech and a 1935 short book by Smedley D. Butler, a retired United States Marine Corps major general and two-time Medal of Honor recipient. Based on his career military experience, Butler discusses how business interests commercially benefit from warfare. He had been appointed commanding officer of the Gendarmerie during the 1915–1934 United States occupation of Haiti.

After Butler retired from the US Marine Corps in October 1931, he made a nationwide tour in the early 1930s giving his speech &quot;War Is a Racket&quot;. The speech was so well received that he wrote a longer version as a short book published in 1935. His work was condensed in &quot;Reader&#x27;s Digest&quot; as a book supplement, which helped popularize his message. In an introduction to the &quot;Reader&#x27;s Digest&quot; version, Lowell Thomas, who wrote Butler&#x27;s oral autobiography, praised Butler&#x27;s &quot;moral as well as physical courage&quot;. 

== Contents ==
In &quot;War Is a Racket&quot;, Butler points to a variety of examples, mostly from World War I, where industrialists, whose operations were subsidized by public funding, were able to generate substantial profits, making money from mass human suffering.

The work is divided into five chapters:
# War is a racket
# Who makes the profits?
# Who pays the bills?
# How to smash this racket!
# To hell with war!

It contains this summary:

Butler confesses that during his decades of service in the United States Marine Corps:
=== Recommendations ===
In the booklet&#x27;s penultimate chapter, Butler recommends three steps to disrupt the war racket:

# Making war unprofitable. Butler suggests that the means for war should be &quot;conscripted&quot; before those who would fight the war: It can be smashed effectively only by taking the profit out of war. The only way to smash this racket is to conscript capital and industry and labour before the nation&#x27;s manhood can be conscripted. […] Let the officers and the directors and the high-powered executives of our armament factories and our steel companies and our munitions makers and our ship-builders and our airplane builders and the manufacturers of all other things that provide profit in war time as well as the bankers and the speculators, be conscripted — to get $30 a month, the same wage as the lads in the trenches get.
# Acts of war to be decided by those who fight it. He also suggests a limited referendum to determine if the war is to be fought. Eligible to vote would be those who risk death on the front lines. &lt;br&gt;
# Limitation of militaries to self-defense. For the United States, Butler recommends that the Navy be limited, by law, to operating within 200 miles of the coastline, and the Army restricted to the territorial limits of the country, ensuring that war, if fought, can never be one of aggression.

<text>Walu is a sun deity in the mythology of the Yolŋu of Arnhem Land.

Walu was believed to light a small fire each morning and paint herself with red ochre. She would then carry a torch from east to west, extinguish the source, and return to her camp in the east.
One legend describes her as living with her daughter, Bara. Bara accompanied her across the Sun every day, but Walu realized she made the Earth too hot and made her stop.

<text>Ozma is the second studio album by the Melvins, released in 1989 through Boner Records. It is the first Melvins album to feature Lori Black on bass guitar and was recorded when the band relocated to San Francisco.

==Background and release==
&quot;Love Thing&quot; is a cover of the KISS song &quot;Love Theme from KISS&quot; from their eponymous debut album. &quot;Creepy Smell&quot; begins with the intro to the song &quot;Living In Sin&quot; from Gene Simmons&#x27; solo album. &quot;Candy-O&quot; is originally by the Cars and was a bonus track on the cassette and CD editions.

The title refers to the character Princess Ozma from the Oz series of books.

The CD version includes the entire &quot;Gluey Porch Treatments&quot; album. The track listing that is printed on the CD lists 34 tracks, but the CD only has 33 tracks. This is due to &quot;Exact Paperbacks&quot; and &quot;Happy Grey or Black&quot; being mistakenly combined on track 23 and not split into separate tracks as credited.

The album&#x27;s cover art was drawn by Spazz bassist and owner of Slap-a-Ham Records, Chris Dodge.

==Critical reception==
AllMusic critic Ned Raggett wrote: &quot;The genre-dipping and out-of-nowhere efforts of later years were still some distance off, to be sure, but moments like the vocal/drum-only part on &quot;Oven&quot; and the needle-thin feedback treatment punctuating &quot;Revulsion/We Reach&quot; (along with occasional chimes) show more chances already being taken.&quot; Ira Robbins of &quot;Trouser Press&quot; described the record as &quot;an outpouring of overweight weirdness cut into short slices&quot;.

The album was included in &quot;Revolver&quot; magazine&#x27;s list of &quot;10 Grunge Albums You Need to Own&quot;, and was described as &quot;a bestial metal-punk hybrid that&#x27;s lumbering, ponderous, and completely frightening.&quot;

<doc id="726586" wikidata="Q373502" url="?curid=726586" title="Alex Pacheco (activist)">
<text>Alexander Fernando Pacheco (born August 1958) is an American animal rights activist. He is the founder of 600 Million Dogs, co-founder and former chairman of People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) and a member of the advisory board of the Sea Shepherd Conservation Society.

Pacheco first crewed with Captain Paul Watson in 1979 on the ship &quot;Sea Shepherd&quot; across the Atlantic Ocean, during a campaign of opposition to the &quot;Sierra&quot;, a Portuguese pirate whaling ship. Both &quot;The Sea Shepherd&quot; and the &quot;Sierra&quot; were sunk after being seized by the Portuguese authorities.

Pacheco came to wider public attention in 1981 for his role, along with Ingrid Newkirk, in what became known as the Silver Spring monkeys case, a campaign to release 17 crab-eating macaques who were undergoing experiments in the Institute for Behavioral Research in Silver Spring, Maryland. Filmmaker Oliver Stone writes that the political campaign to save the monkeys gave birth to the animal rights movement in the United States.

==Early life and education==
Pacheco was born in Joliet, Illinois, but moved to Mexico with his family when he was very young, where he and his two siblings were raised near the ocean by his Mexican father, a physician, and his mother, an American nurse. Kathy Snow Guillermo writes in &quot;Monkey Business&quot; (1993) that Pacheco&#x27;s early life was filled with animals; bats lived in the rubber trees in his front yard, snakes slept behind nearby rocks, and fishermen regularly dragged dolphins out of the water onto the beach. Instead of animals being killed for food in slaughterhouses, pigs, oxen, chickens, and turkeys were frequently killed in front of him.

The family left Mexico when Pacheco was in junior high, and moved between Ohio, Indiana, and Illinois. His interest in animals continued. He bought turtles and birds from pet stores, and a baby crab-eating macaque, whom he called Chi Chi and who would perch on his shoulder as he walked around the house.

He attended a Catholic university in Ohio, intending to enter the priesthood, but while in Canada in his first year at the university, he visited a friend who worked at a meat-packing plant. Guillermo writes that he was shocked by the sight of two men throwing a newborn calf, cut from the uterus of its slaughtered mother, into a dumpster. Later in the week, a friend gave him a copy of Peter Singer&#x27;s &quot;Animal Liberation&quot;, and he returned to Ohio as a vegetarian. His heart was no longer in becoming a priest, and he decided to attend Ohio State University in Columbus, Ohio and devote himself to helping what he called &quot;other-than-human beings&quot;.

==Activism==

===Sea Shepherd===
At university, Pacheco organized campaigns against the use of leghold traps and castrating pigs and cattle without anesthetic. Guillermo writes that, as Ohio is an agricultural state, his activism met with stiff opposition and the occasional anonymous telephone call threatening to blow his head off.

In 1979, he attended a talk in Columbus, Ohio, by Cleveland Amory of the &quot;Saturday Review&quot;, who was also the founder of the Fund for Animals, which funded the anti-whaling vessel the &quot;Sea Shepherd&quot;. He sought Amory out after the talk and volunteered. Pacheco first crewed with Paul Watson on the ship for the summer in 1979 (and again in 2003), in the bridge, the engine room and as a deckhand, during the Sea Shepherd&#x27;s first whale protection campaign, known as The Sierra Campaign, across the Atlantic, which ended with both the &quot;Sea Shepherd&quot; and the &quot;Sierra&quot; being sunk, in Portugal in 1980.

===Silver Spring monkeys case===
The Silver Spring monkeys case began in 1981, when Pacheco took a job as a volunteer inside the Institute for Behavioral Research in Silver Spring, Maryland. Edward Taub, a neuroscientist, was cutting sensory ganglia that supplied nerves to the fingers, hands, arms, and legs of 17 macaque monkeys – a process known as &quot;deafferentation&quot; – so that the monkeys could not feel them. (Some of them had had their entire spinal columns deafferented.) Taub used restraint and electric shock to force the monkeys to use the limbs they could not feel. He discovered that, when motivated by extreme hunger or the desire to avoid electric shock, they could be induced to use their deafferented limbs. The research led in part to the discovery of neuroplasticity within the primate motor system and a new therapy for stroke victims called constraint-induced movement therapy that helped restore the use of affected limbs.

Pacheco reported Taub for violations of animal cruelty laws based on the animals&#x27; living conditions.

Police raided the lab, seized the monkeys and charged Taub with 119 counts of animal cruelty and failure to provide adequate veterinary care, the first such charges brought in the United States against a research scientist. 113 charges were dismissed at the first court hearing. Taub was initially convicted on six misdemeanor counts of failure to provide adequate veterinary care. Five convictions were dismissed after a second trial, and the final conviction was overturned on appeal when the court ruled that Maryland&#x27;s Prevention of Cruelty to Animals law did not apply to researchers.

In 1990, &quot;Washingtonian&quot; magazine published an article alleging that Pacheco&#x27;s photo of a monkey in a restraint chair was &quot;staged.&quot; PETA filed a $3 million libel lawsuit, which was settled out of court when the magazine agreed to issue an apology and donate an unspecified amount of money to animal rights organizations.

The legal battle for custody of the monkeys, following their removal by PETA, reached the United States Supreme Court. It was the first animal-rights case to do so, though the newly formed PETA ultimately failed in its battle to secure the animals&#x27; release. The proceedings, which lasted years, generated a large amount of publicity for PETA, transforming it from what Ingrid Newkirk called &quot;five people in a basement&quot; into a national movement. As a result of the case, the House of Representatives Subcommittee on Science, Research and Technology held hearings that led to the 1985 Animal Welfare Act, and in 1986 changes in United States Public Health Service guidelines for animals used in animal research included a requirement that each institution seeking federal funding have an Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee whose job it is to oversee how laboratory animals within that institution are cared for.

===Snare trapping of wild pigs and goats in Hawaii===
In 1992, Pacheco and a staffer went to the Hawaiian island of Molokai and destroyed several hundred wire snares that were causing pigs and goats to die slowly of strangulation, starvation, and dehydration. The traps had been set by the Nature Conservancy in an effort to preserve native species by killing non-native species. After this was publicized, the Nature Conservancy discontinued the trapping.

===Dogs at Pentagon wound lab===
In July 1983, &quot;The New York Times&quot; reported that Pacheco was responsible for Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger halting Pentagon plans to shoot dogs in a &quot;wound laboratory&quot; at a military medical facility near Washington, D.C. Pacheco had learned about the project and notified both Congress and &quot;The Washington Post&quot;. Weinberger had a collie, and when he read the article, he immediately banned the use of dogs in the experiments. Two days later, he also ordered the Pentagon to review the plans and suspend the shooting of pigs, goats, and other animals until the review was completed.

Pacheco continued to raise public awareness of the issue through protests.

He also worked with Congressional contacts and the media in order to convince the military to make the change permanent and include other facilities and other species. In November 1983, Congressional representatives instructed the Defense Department not to use dogs and cats in any wound laboratories, and the policy went into effect in January 1984.

In late 1984, after continued public pressure and completion of the review ordered by Secretary Weinberger, the secretaries of the Army and Air Force banned the use of dogs and cats not just in wound labs, but in all biomedical and clinical research under their control.

===Horse slaughter in Texas===
In late 1983, Pacheco went to Falls County, Texas, to investigate reports of horses dying in fields. At least 14,000 horses had been gathered by a company called Horses Unlimited, which planned to fatten them for slaughter and sale in Europe as horsemeat. Instead, 2,000 horses died of starvation, and one third of the rest suffered from severe malnutrition.

Pacheco and others tried to aid the horses but were threatened with arrest by Falls County authorities, PETA told reporters. He took his investigation and evidence of cruelty to the national media in early 1984. State investigators called it &quot;one of the biggest cases of animal abuse in the state&#x27;s history&quot;, and Jacy Reese Anthis described it as &quot;the first modern undercover investigation of farmed animal abuse&quot; in his 2018 book &quot;The End of Animal Farming&quot;.

As a result of his efforts, Pacheco was brought before a grand jury on criminal charges. He was represented by well-known defense attorney Richard &quot;Racehorse&quot; Haynes, and the charges were dropped. The same month, the slaughter operation closed down permanently.

===Pennsylvania head injury lab&#x27;s baboon experiments===
In May 1984, Pacheco compiled a 30-minute video called &quot;Unnecessary Fuss&quot; based on 60 hours of videotapes taken from the Pennsylvania Head Injury Lab by the underground organization Animal Liberation Front.

The videos, made by the researchers, showed baboons receiving severe head and neck injuries from a head-acceleration machine. The videos also included footage of the researchers laughing at injured, brain-damaged animals.

After nearly a year of other efforts to stop the federal government from continuing to fund this laboratory, in July 1985 Pacheco led approximately 100 activists in a sit-in at the headquarters of the National Institutes of Health, the federal agency funding the experiments. The sit-in lasted 4 days, after which Secretary of Health and Human Services Margaret Heckler publicly announced the termination of funding for the $14 million Head Injury Laboratory at the University of Pennsylvania.

===Testing on animals; declining sales of fur===
During his 20-year tenure as chairman of PETA, Pacheco was involved in bringing public attention to the way animals are treated in cosmetic tests and in urging companies to abandon this practice. These campaigns resulted in major companies such as Avon, Revlon, and Benetton ending animal tests on products sold in the U.S., and hundreds of other companies pledging to do the same.

He was also involved in informing the public about the treatment of animals used for fur. The publicity by PETA was considered by the media, the public, and some in the fur industry to have caused a decline in fur sales.

===Spokesperson for the Animal Liberation Front===
Pacheco was the subject of grand jury investigations because he sometimes obtained information from, and served as the spokesperson for, the underground Animal Liberation Front, which broke into animal facilities to remove animals, gather evidence of cruelty, and sometimes damage laboratory equipment.

=== 600 Million Dogs ===
In 2010, Alex Pacheco founded 600 Million Dogs with the mission to develop safe veterinary formulas to permanently end the number one cause of suffering and death for dogs and cats worldwide—dog and cat overpopulation. The first formulas in development are Spay and Neuter Cookies, which are being designed to safely sterilize strays—without surgery. The objective is to end the cycle of suffering for the tens of millions of stray cats in the U.S. and end the cycle of suffering for the 600 million stray dogs worldwide, who give birth to over one billion stray pups each year. The organization is also dedicated to alleviating the plight of the 29 million people who are treated for rabies each year, and preventing the deaths of the 59,000 people who die from rabies each year.

==Awards==
The Peace Abbey, of Sherborn, Massachusetts, awarded Alex Pacheco the Courage of Conscience award in 1995. In 2001, Pacheco was inducted into the US Animal Rights Hall of Fame.

<doc id="726587" wikidata="Q6031027" url="?curid=726587" title="Information cascade">
<text>An information cascade or informational cascade is a phenomenon described in behavioral economics and network theory in which a number of people make the same decision in a sequential fashion. It is similar to, but distinct from herd behavior.

An information cascade is generally accepted as a two-step process. For a cascade to begin an individual must encounter a scenario with a decision, typically a binary one. Second, outside factors can influence this decision, such as the individual observing others&#x27; choices and the apparent outcomes.

The two-step process of an informational cascade can be broken down into five basic components:

# There is a decision to be made – for example; whether to adopt a new technology, wear a new style of clothing, eat in a new restaurant, or support a particular political position
# A limited action space exists (e.g. an adopt/reject decision)
# People make the decision sequentially, and each person can observe the choices made by those who acted earlier
# Each person has some information aside from their own that helps guide their decision
# A person can&#x27;t directly observe the outside information that other people know, but he or she can make inferences about this information from what they do

Social perspectives of cascades, which suggest that agents may act irrationally (e.g., against what they think is optimal) when social pressures are great, exist as complements to the concept of information cascades. More often the problem is that the concept of an information cascade is confused with ideas that do not match the two key conditions of the process, such as social proof, information diffusion, and social influence. Indeed, the term information cascade has even been used to refer to such processes.

== Basic model ==

This section provides some basic examples of information cascades, as originally described by Bikchandani et al. (1992). The basic model has since been developed in a variety of directions to examine its robustness and better understand its implications.

=== Qualitative example ===

Information cascades occur when external information obtained from previous participants in an event overrides one&#x27;s own private signal, irrespective of the correctness of the former over the latter. The experiment conducted by Anderson is a useful example of this process. The experiment consisted of two urns labeled A and B. Urn A contains two balls labeled &quot;a&quot; and one labeled &quot;b&quot;. Urn B contains one ball labeled &quot;a&quot; and two labeled &quot;b&quot;. The urn from which a ball must be drawn during each run is determined randomly and with equal probabilities (from the throw of a dice). The contents of the chosen urn are emptied into a neutral container. The participants are then asked in random order to draw a marble from this container. This entire process may be termed a &quot;run&quot;, and a number of such runs are performed.

Each time a participant picks up a marble, he is to decide which urn it belongs to. His decision is then announced for the benefit of the remaining participants in the room. Thus, the (n+1)th participant has information about the decisions made by all the n participants preceding him, and also his private signal which is the label on the ball that he draws during his turn. The experimenters observed that an information cascade was observed in 41 of 56 such runs. This means, in the runs where the cascade occurred, at least one participant gave precedence to earlier decisions over his own private signal. It is possible for such an occurrence to produce the wrong result. This phenomenon is known as &quot;Reverse Cascade&quot;.

=== Quantitative description ===

A person&#x27;s signal telling them to accept is denoted as (a high signal, where high signifies he should accept), and a signal telling them not to accept is (a low signal). The model assumes that when the correct decision is to accept, individuals will be more likely to see an , and conversely, when the correct decision is to reject, individuals are more likely to see an signal. This is essentially a conditional probability – the probability of when the correct action is to accept, or formula_1. Similarly formula_2 is the probability that an agent gets an signal when the correct action is reject. If these likelihoods are represented by &quot;q&quot;, then &quot;q&quot; &gt; 0.5. This is summarized in the table below.
 
The first agent determines whether or not to accept solely based on his own signal. As the model assumes that all agents act rationally, the action (accept or reject) the agent feels is more likely is the action he will choose to take. This decision can be explained using Bayes&#x27; rule:

formula_3

If the agent receives an signal, then the likelihood of accepting is obtained by calculating formula_4. The equation says that, by virtue of the fact that &quot;q&quot; &gt; 0.5, the first agent, acting only on his private signal, will always increase his estimate of &quot;p&quot; with an signal. Similarly, it can be shown that an agent will always decrease his expectation of &quot;p&quot; when he receives a low signal. Recalling that, if the value, , of accepting is equal to the value of rejecting, then an agent will accept if he believes &quot;p&quot; &gt; 0.5, and reject otherwise. Because this agent started out with the assumption that both accepting and rejecting are equally viable options (&quot;p&quot; = 0.5), the observation of an signal will allow him to conclude that accepting is the rational choice.

The second agent then considers both the first agent&#x27;s decision and his own signal, again in a rational fashion. In general, the &quot;n&quot;th agent considers the decisions of the previous &quot;n&quot;-1 agents, and his own signal. He makes a decision based on Bayesian reasoning to determine the most rational choice.
formula_5
Where is the number of accepts in the previous set plus the agent&#x27;s own signal, and is the number of rejects. Thus, . The decision is based on how the value on the right hand side of the equation compares with &quot;p&quot;.

===Explicit model assumptions===

The original model makes several assumptions about human behavior and the world in which humans act, some of which are relaxed in later versions or in alternate definitions of similar problems, such as the diffusion of innovations. 
#Boundedly Rational Agents: The original Independent Cascade model assumes humans are boundedly rational – that is, they will always make rational decisions based on the information they can observe, but the information they observe may not be complete or correct. In other words, agents do not have complete knowledge of the world around them (which would allow them to make the correct decision in any and all situations). In this way, there is a point at which, even if a person has correct knowledge of the idea or action cascading, they can be convinced via social pressures to adopt some alternate, incorrect view of the world.
#Incomplete Knowledge of Others: The original information cascade model assumes that agents have incomplete knowledge of the agents which precede them in the specified order. As opposed to definitions where agents have some knowledge of the &quot;private information&quot; held by previous agents, the current agent makes a decision based only on the observable action (whether or not to imitate) of those preceding him. It is important to note that the original creators argue this is a reason why information cascades can be caused by small shocks.
#Behavior of all previous agents is known

=== Resulting conditions ===

#Cascades will always occur – as discussed, in the simple mode, the likelihood of a cascade occurring increases towards 1 as the number of people making decisions increases towards infinity.
#Cascades can be incorrect – because agents make decisions with both bounded rationality and probabilistic knowledge of the initial truth (e.g. whether accepting or rejecting is the correct decision), the incorrect behavior may cascade through the system.
#Cascades can be based on little information – mathematically, a cascade of an infinite length can occur based only on the decision of two people. More generally, a small set of people who strongly promote an idea as being rational can rapidly influence a much larger subset of the general population
#Cascades are fragile – because agents receive no extra information after the difference between a and b increases beyond 2, and because such differences can occur at small numbers of agents, agents considering opinions from those agents who are making decisions based on actual information can be dissuaded from a choice rather easily. This suggests that cascades are susceptible to the release of public information. also discusses this result in the context of the underlying value p changing over time, in which case a cascade can rapidly change course.

== Responding ==

A literature exists that examines how individuals or firms might respond to the existence of informational cascades when they have products to sell but where buyers are unsure of the quality of those products. Curtis Taylor (1999) shows that when selling a house the seller might wish to start with high prices, as failure to sell with low prices is indicative of low quality and might start a cascade on not buying, while failure to sell with high prices could be construed as meaning the house is just over-priced, and prices can then be reduced to get a sale. Daniel Sgroi (2002) shows that firms might use &quot;guinea pigs&quot; who are given the opportunity to buy early to kick-start an informational cascade through their early and public purchasing decisions, and work by David Gill and Daniel Sgroi (2008) show that early public tests might have a similar effect (and in particular that passing a &quot;tough test&quot; which is biased against the seller can instigate a cascade all by itself). Bose &quot;et al.&quot; have examined how prices set by a monopolist might evolve in the presence of potential cascade behavior where the monopolist and consumers are unsure of a products quality.

==Examples and fields of application==
Information cascades occur in situations where seeing many people make the same choice provides evidence that outweighs one&#x27;s own judgment. That is, one thinks: &quot;It&#x27;s more likely that I&#x27;m wrong than that all those other people are wrong. Therefore, I will do as they do.&quot;

In what has been termed a reputational cascade, late responders sometimes go along with the decisions of early responders, not just because the late responders think the early responders are right, but also because they perceive their reputation will be damaged if they dissent from the early responders.

=== Market cascades ===
Information cascades have become one of the topics of behavioral economics, as they are often seen in financial markets where they can feed speculation and create cumulative and excessive price moves, either for the whole market (market bubble) or a specific asset, like a stock that becomes overly popular among investors.

Marketers also use the idea of cascades to attempt to get a buying cascade started for a new product. If they can induce an initial set of people to adopt the new product, then those who make purchasing decisions later on may also adopt the product even if it is no better than, or perhaps even worse than, competing products. This is most effective if these later consumers are able to observe the adoption decisions, but not how satisfied the early customers actually were with the choice. This is consistent with the idea that cascades arise naturally when people can see what others do but not what they know.

An example is Hollywood movies. If test screenings suggest a big-budget movie might be a flop, studios often decide to spend more on initial marketing rather than less, with the aim of making as much money as possible on the opening weekend, before word gets around that it&#x27;s a turkey.

Information cascades are usually considered by economists:
* as products of rational expectations at their start,
* as irrational herd behavior if they persist for too long, which signals that collective emotions come also into play to feed the cascade.

=== Social networks and social media ===

Dotey et al. state that information flows in the form of cascades on the social network. According to the authors, analysis of virality of information cascades on a social network may lead to many useful applications like determining the most influential individuals within a network. This information can be used for &quot;maximizing market effectiveness&quot; or &quot;influencing public opinion&quot;. Various structural and temporal features of a network affect cascade virality. Additionally, these models are widely exploited in the problem of Rumor spread in social network to investigate it and reduce its influence in online social networks.

In contrast to work on information cascades in social networks, the social influence model of belief spread argues that people have some notion of the private beliefs of those in their network. The social influence model, then, relaxes the assumption of information cascades that people are acting only on observable actions taken by others. In addition, the social influence model focuses on embedding people within a social network, as opposed to a queue. Finally, the social influence model relaxes the assumption of the information cascade model that people will either complete an action or not by allowing for a continuous scale of the &quot;strength&quot; of an agents belief that an action should be completed.

Information cascades can also restructure the social networks that they pass through. For example, while there is a constant low level of churn in social ties on Twitter—in any given month, about 9% of all social connections change—there is often a spike in follow and unfollow activity following an information cascade, such as the sharing of a viral tweet. As the tweet-sharing cascade passes through the network, users adjust their social ties, particularly those connected to the original author of the viral tweet: the author of a viral tweet will see both a sudden loss in previous followers and a sudden increase in new followers.

As a part of this cascade-driven reorganization process, information cascades can also create assortative social networks, where people tend to be connected to others who are similar in some characteristic. Tweet cascades increase in the similarity between connected users, as users lose ties to more dissimilar users and add new ties to similar users. Information cascades created by news coverage in the media may also foster political polarization by sorting social networks along political lines: Twitter users who follow and share more polarized news coverage tend to lose social ties to users of the opposite ideology.

=== Historical examples ===
* Small protests began in Leipzig, Germany in 1989 with just a handful of activists challenging the German Democratic Republic. For almost a year, protesters met every Monday growing by a few people each time. By the time the government attempted to address it in September 1989, it was too big to quash. In October, the number of protesters reached 100,000 and by the first Monday in November, over 400,000 people marched the streets of Leipzig. Two days later the Berlin Wall was dismantled.

* The adoption rate of drought-resistant hybrid seed corn during the Great Depression and Dust Bowl was slow despite its significant improvement over the previously available seed corn. Researchers at Iowa State University were interested in understanding the public&#x27;s hesitation to the adoption of this significantly improved technology. After conducting 259 interviews with farmers it was observed that the slow rate of adoption was due to how the farmers valued the opinion of their friends and neighbors instead of the word of a salesman. See for the original report.

=== Empirical studies ===
In addition to the examples above, Information Cascades have been shown to exist in several empirical studies. Perhaps the best example, given above, is. Participants stood in a line behind an urn which had balls of different colors. Sequentially, participants would pick a ball out of the urn, looks at it, and then places it back into the urn. The agent then voices their opinion of which color of balls (red or blue) there is a majority of in the urn for the rest of the participants to hear. Participants get a monetary reward if they guess correctly, forcing the concept of rationality.

Other examples include
* De Vany and Walls create a statistical model of information cascades where an action is required. They apply this model to the actions people take to go see a movie that has come out at the theatre. De Vany and Walls validate their model on this data, finding a similar Pareto distribution of revenue for different movies.
* Walden and Browne also adopt the original Information Cascade model, here into an operational model more practical for real world studies, which allows for analysis based on observed variables. Walden and Browne test their model on data about adoption of new technologies by businesses, finding support for their hypothesis that information cascades play a role in this adoption

==Legal aspects==
The negative effects of informational cascades sometimes become a legal concern and laws have been enacted to neutralize them. Ward Farnsworth, a law professor, analyzed the legal aspects of informational cascades and gave several examples in his book &quot;The Legal Analyst&quot;: in many military courts, the officers voting to decide a case vote in reverse rank order (the officer of the lowest rank votes first), and he suggested it may be done so the lower-ranked officers would not be tempted by the cascade to vote with the more senior officers, who are believed to have more accurate judgement; another example is that countries such as Israel and France have laws that prohibit polling days or weeks before elections to prevent the effect of informational cascade that may influence the election results.

== Globalization ==
One informational cascade study compared thought processes between Greek and German organic farmers, suggesting discrepancies based upon cultural and socioeconomic differences. Even further, cascades have been extrapolated to ideas such as financial volatility and monetary policy. In 2004 Helmut Wagner and Wolfram Berger suggested cascades as an analytical vehicle to examine changes to the financial market as it became more globalized. Wagner and Berger noticed structural changes to the framework of understanding financial markets due to globalization; giving rise to volatility in capital flow and spawning uncertainty which affected central banks. Additionally, information cascades are useful in understanding the origins of terrorist tactics. When the attack by Black September occurred in 1972 it was hard not to see the similarities between their tactics and the Baader-Meinhof group (also known as the Red Army Faction [RAF]). All of these examples portray how the process of cascades were put into use. Moreover, it is important to understand the framework of cascades to move forward in a more globalized society. Establishing a foundation to understanding the passage of information through transnational and multinational organizations, and even more, is critical to the arising modern society. Summing up all of these points, cascades, as a general term, encompass a spectrum of different concepts. Information cascades have been the underlying thread in how information is transferred, overwritten, and understood through various cultures spanning from a multitude of different countries.

<doc id="726596" wikidata="Q435735" url="?curid=726596" title="M-3 (Michigan highway)">
<text>M-3, known for most of its length as Gratiot Avenue (, ), is a north–south state trunkline highway in the Detroit metropolitan area of the US state of Michigan. The trunkline starts in Downtown Detroit and runs through the city in a northeasterly direction along one of Detroit&#x27;s five major avenues. The highway passes several historic landmarks and through a historic district. It also connects residential neighborhoods on the city&#x27;s east side with suburbs in Macomb County and downtown.

Gratiot Avenue in Detroit was one of the original avenues laid out by Judge Augustus Woodward after the Detroit fire in 1805. It was later used as a supply road for Fort Gratiot in Port Huron under authorization from the US Congress in the 1820s. The roadway was included in the State Trunkline Highway System in 1913 and signposted with a number in 1919. Later, it was used as a segment of US Highway 25 (US 25) before that highway was functionally replaced by Interstate 94 (I-94) in the 1960s. The M-3 designation was applied to the current highway in 1973, and a southern section was reassigned to M-85 in 2001.

==Route description==

The southern end of M-3 is at an intersection between Broadway and Randolph streets and Gratiot Avenue in downtown Detroit; the highway runs northeasterly from this intersection along Gratiot Avenue, one of Detroit&#x27;s five major thoroughfares. This street is a boulevard setup with four lanes divided with a median or center turn lane. Gratiot Avenue runs northeasterly through downtown, past Ford Field. Near the stadium, the street passes over I-375 (Chrysler Freeway) without any direct connections. On the east side of the freeway, M-3 runs past the Historic Trinity Lutheran and St. John&#x27;s-St. Luke&#x27;s Evangelical churches before intersecting the end of the Fisher Freeway, which at this location is an unnumbered connector to I-75 and I-375. Gratiot continues past the freeway on the city&#x27;s east side, bordering residential neighborhoods along the way. Through this area, it had a continuous center turn lane, losing the grassy median it had in places downtown. The highway intersects Grand Boulevard near Dueweke Park, and at Van Dyke Avenue, it intersects the southern end of M-53. Gratiot Avenue crosses I-94 at the latter&#x27;s exit 219 near the Coleman A. Young International Airport and an adjacent industrial area.
Past the airport, Gratiot Avenue once again runs through residential neighborhoods while being immediately bordered by commercial properties. The southern end of M-97 is at the intersection between Gratiot and Gunston avenues just northeast of the Outer Drive junction by the airport. The trunkline passes the Assumption of the Blessed Virgin Mary Church near a branch location of the Detroit Public Library at McNichols Street. Just before crossing M-102 (8 Mile Road), Gratiot Avenue widens back to a boulevard. This intersection marks the transition from Detroit and Wayne County to Eastpointe in Macomb County.

In Macomb County, M-3 follows a boulevard setup complete with Michigan lefts at the major intersections in the suburbs of Detroit. There are a series of commercial properties between 10 Mile Road and I-696 (Reuther Freeway) that includes the Eastgate Shopping Center in Roseville. Near 13 Mile Road, there is a partial interchange with I-94 that allows eastbound traffic, which is physically traveling northbound to access northbound M-3 and southbound M-3 traffic to access westbound I-94. The missing connections are possible through the adjacent interchange for Little Mack Avenue on I-94 which also connects to 13 Mile Road and Gratiot Avenue. North of 14 Mile Road, M-3 crosses into Clinton Charter Township next to the Hebrew Memorial Park, a cemetery.

North of the intersection with Metropolitan Parkway, Gratiot Avenue splits into a one-way pairing of Northbound and Southbound Gratiot avenues as it crosses into Mount Clemens near the Clinton River. The two separate streets are one, two, or even three blocks apart through the city&#x27;s downtown area. North of the Patterson Street intersections, the two streets cross back into Clinton Township and merge back together in four-lane street with a center turn lane. North of M-59 (Hall Road). M-3 clips the southeastern corner of Macomb Township near Selfridge Air National Guard Base. The highway continues into Chesterfield Township. M-3 parts from Gratiot Avenue at the intersection with 23 Mile Road, turning eastward along that roadway to an intersection with I-94. At exit 243, M-3 terminates at this interchange and 23 Mile Road continues easterly as M-29.

M-3 is maintained by the Michigan Department of Transportation (MDOT) like other state highways in Michigan. As a part of these maintenance responsibilities, the department tracks the volume of traffic that uses the roadways under its jurisdiction. These volumes are expressed using a metric called annual average daily traffic, which is a statistical calculation of the average daily number of vehicles on a segment of roadway. MDOT&#x27;s surveys in 2010 showed that the highest traffic levels along M-3 were the 73,957 vehicles daily south of 14 Mile Road in Roseville; the lowest counts were the 4,609 vehicles per day north of Cadillac Square in downtown Detroit. All of M-3 has been listed on the National Highway System, a network of roads important to the country&#x27;s economy, defense, and mobility.

==History==

===Original designation===

The first trunkline to be designated M-3 was Schaefer Highway in 1937, running north–south from US 25 (Dix Avenue) in Melvindale to US 16 (Grand River Avenue) in western Detroit. Two years later, the highway became M-39. Since M-39 was moved to Southfield Road in the end of the 1950s, Schaefer Highway has been a locally maintained road.

===Current designation===
The chief transportation routes in 1701 were the Indian trails that crossed the future state of Michigan; the one connecting what are now Detroit and Port Huron was one of these thirteen trails at the time. Detroit created rights-of-way for the principal streets of the city, the modern Gratiot Avenue included, in 1805. This street plan was devised by Augustus Woodward and others following a devastating fire in Detroit. Gratiot Avenue, then also called Detroit–Port Huron Road, was authorized by the US Congress on March 2, 1827, as a supply road from Detroit to Port Huron for Fort Gratiot. Construction started in Detroit in 1829, and the roadway was completed in the same year to Mount Clemens. The rest was finished in 1833. The road was named for the fort near Port Huron, which was in turn named for Colonel Charles Gratiot, the supervising engineer in charge of construction of the structure in the aftermath of the War of 1812.
On May 13, 1913, the Michigan Legislature passed the &quot;State Reward Trunk Line Highway Act&quot;, which included Gratiot Avenue as part of Division 1 of the initial highway system. When the Michigan State Highway Department signposted the first state highways in 1919, the trunkline bore the M-19 designation for its entire length from Detroit to Port Huron. In 1926, Gratiot Avenue was redesignated as part of US 25, while the M-19 designation was relocated westward, connecting Yale with US 25 (Gratiot Avenue) just north of 31 Mile Road. In 1963, the portion of US 25 north of 23 Mile Road was turned over to local control as US 25 was routed over the newly constructed I-94 freeway, with the exception of the stretch between New Haven and Muttonville, which was again designated M-19 as an extension of that route. Between Hall and 23 Mile roads, Gratiot Avenue was added to an extended M-59.
M-3 returned to existence in 1973, when US 25, now concurrent with I-94 and I-75 for most of its length through Michigan and Ohio, was truncated at Cincinnati. The former US 25 section of Gratiot Avenue was redesignated M-3, along with a southwestern extension down Fort Street to Clark Avenue (I-75 exit 47A). This also provided an international connection via the Ambassador Bridge to Ontario&#x27;s Highway 3. The signs were changed over in February 1974 to complete the change. In 1998, the eastern end of M-59 was rerouted to end at I-94 exit 240, eliminating the concurrency from Hall Road to the current northern terminus of M-3.

At the end of 2000, MDOT proposed several highway transfers in Detroit, some of which involved transferring highways in the Campus Martius Park area to city control; another part of the proposal involved MDOT assuming control over a section of Fort Street from the then-northern terminus of M-85 to the then-southern terminus of M-3 at Clark Street. When these transfers were completed the following year, M-3 was severed into two discontinuous segments by the Campus Martius changes, and the southern segment between Clark and Griswold streets was added to an extended M-85.

On April 26, 2023, MDOT and the City of Detroit approved a memorandum of understanding that transferred jurisdiction over the of Randolph Street to city control. This MOU also included a payment of $7,609,203.68 to the city to reconstruct that section of street with the stipulation that the city has to complete the project within five years or return the money to the department. The transfer moved Randolph Street from the state trunkline highway system and shifted M-3&#x27;s southern terminus northward to the intersection of Broadway and Randolph streets with Gratiot Avenue.

<text>Scott Cao (; pronounced &quot;Ts-awh&quot;) is a violin maker (luthier), who is originally from China but now works in Campbell, California, United States.

==Biography==
In the mid-1970s, amidst Mao&#x27;s cultural revolution, Cao was a farm worker. A violin-making teacher who visited the area offered him the opportunity of an apprenticeship. He graduated from the Guangzhou Institute of Professions in 1977.

When China opened its borders Cao went to the United States in 1985. He originally stayed in San Francisco where a violin dealer suggested that he should study repairing older instruments under a master luthier. His mentors included eminent violin makers such as Louiz Bellini, Hans Weisshaar, and Roland Feller. In 1990, Scott partnered with Hideo Kamimoto to start a violin shop and returned to China, where he founded a company which makes affordable instruments and bows, including violas, cellos, basses, guitars and established Scott Cao Violins. Three years later Scott was able to open his own shop in the United States in Campbell, California.

His best instruments are meticulous copies of famous Stradivari and Guarneri designs.

==History==
The oldest known petroglyphs in North America are in the Great Basin. Near the banks of Winnemucca Lake in Nevada, this rock art dates between 10,500 and 14,800 years ago.

Archaeologists called the local period 9,000 BCE to 400 CE the Great Basin Desert Archaic Period. This was followed by the time of the Fremont culture, who were hunter-gatherers and agriculturalists. Numic language-speakers, ancestors of today&#x27;s Western Shoshone and both Northern Paiute people and Southern Paiute people entered the region around the 14th century CE.

The first Europeans to document their encounters with Native groups in the Great Basin was Juan María Antonio de Rivera&#x27;s expedition in 1765. Rivera led two expeditions from Santa Fe that year, the first departing sometime in June. Rivera&#x27;s party camped with Paiutes on the Dolores River in July, and returned to Santa Fe for supplies. His second expedition departed Santa Fe in late September and went considerably farther, crossing the Colorado just south of present-day Moab, Utah. Rivera&#x27;s diaries greatly influenced the Domínguez–Escalante expedition, which set off 11 years later in 1776 and passed far from present day Delta, Utah. Great Basin settlement was relatively free of non-Native settlers until the first Mormon settlers arrived in 1847. Within ten years, the first Indian reservation was established, in order to assimilate the native population. The Goshute Reservation was created in 1863. The attempted acculturation process included sending children to Indian schools and limiting the landbases and resources of the reservations.

Because their contact with European-Americans and African-Americans occurred comparatively late, Great Basin tribes maintain their religion and culture and were leading proponents of 19th century cultural and religious renewals. Two Paiute prophets, Wodziwob and Wovoka, introduced the Ghost Dance in a ceremony to commune with departed loved ones and bring renewal of buffalo herds and precontact lifeways. The Ute Bear Dance emerged on the Great Basin. The Sun Dance and Peyote religion flourished in the Great Basin, as well.

In 1930, the Ely Shoshone Reservation was established, followed by the Duckwater Indian Reservation in 1940.

Conditions for the Native American population of the Great Basin were erratic throughout the 20th century. Economic improvement emerged as a result of President Franklin Roosevelt&#x27;s Indian New Deal in the 1930s, while activism and legal victories in the 1970s have improved conditions significantly. Nevertheless, the communities continue to struggle against chronic poverty and all of the resulting problems: unemployment; substance abuse; and high suicide rates.

Today self-determination, beginning with the 1975 passage of the Indian Self-determination and Education Assistance Act, has enabled Great Basin tribes to develop economic opportunities for their members.

==Cultures==

Different ethnic groups of Great Basin tribes share certain common cultural elements that distinguish them from surrounding groups. All but the Washoe traditionally speak Numic languages, and tribal groups, who historically lived peacefully and often shared common territories, have intermingled considerably. Prior to the 20th century, Great Basin peoples were predominantly hunters and gatherers.

&quot;Desert Archaic&quot; or more simply &quot;The Desert Culture&quot; refers to the culture of the Great Basin tribes. This culture is characterized by the need for mobility to take advantage of seasonally available food supplies. The use of pottery was rare due to its weight, but intricate baskets were woven for containing water, cooking food, winnowing grass seeds and storage—including the storage of pine nuts, a Paiute-Shoshone staple. Heavy items such as metates would be cached rather than carried from foraging area to foraging area. Agriculture was not practiced within the Great Basin itself, although it was practiced in adjacent areas (modern agriculture in the Great Basin requires either large mountain reservoirs or deep artesian wells). Likewise, the Great Basin tribes had no permanent settlements, although winter villages might be revisited winter after winter by the same group of families. In the summer, the largest group was usually the nuclear family due to the low density of food supplies.

In the early historical period the Great Basin tribes were actively expanding to the north and east, where they developed a horse-riding bison-hunting culture. These people, including the Bannock and Eastern Shoshone share traits with Plains Indians.

Today, the Great Basin Native Artists, which was cofounded by Melissa Melero-Moose represents Indigenous visual artists from the region and curates groups exhibitions.

<text>Donald Lynden-Bell CBE FRS (5 April 1935 – 6 February 2018) was a British theoretical astrophysicist. He was the first to determine that galaxies contain supermassive black holes at their centres, and that such black holes power quasars. Lynden-Bell was President of the Royal Astronomical Society (1985–1987) and received numerous awards for his work, including the inaugural Kavli Prize for Astrophysics. He worked at the University of Cambridge for his entire career, where he was the first director of its Institute of Astronomy.

==Biography==
Lynden-Bell was born at Dover Castle in Dover, Kent, into a military family, as one of two children to Lachlan Arthur Lynden-Bell (1897–1984) and Monica Rose Thring (1906–1994). His father, a lieutenant colonel, fought on the Western Front and in the Middle East during World War I and had received a Military Cross. He had a sister, Jean Monica, who became a prominent music teacher in Canada.

He attended Marlborough College before being admitted to Clare College, Cambridge in 1953. After earning a distinction in the Mathematical Tripos, Lynden-Bell went on to doctoral studies in theoretical astronomy working with Leon Mestel, which he completed in 1960. In 1962, he published research with Olin Eggen and Allan Sandage arguing that the Milky Way originated through the dynamic collapse of a single large gas cloud. In 1969 he published his theory that quasars are powered by massive black holes accreting material. From counting dead quasars, he deduced that most massive galaxies have black holes at their centres.

Lynden-Bell developed a theory for the relaxation of a system of particles in changing potential field known as &quot;violent relaxation.&quot; Violent relaxation has many applications in dynamical astronomy, affecting the orbits of stars within star clusters and galaxies. Lynden-Bell is also known for the development of the theory of the gravothermal catastrophe, a phenomenon in star clusters that is the result of the negative heat capacity of gravitational systems. The catastrophe occurs when the core of a cluster shrinks and heats up, causing it to transfer energy to stars in the cluster&#x27;s halo, leading the cluster core to collapse.

Lynden-Bell authored an influential 1974 paper with James E. Pringle about the evolution of disks around &quot;nebular variables,&quot; which were later to become known as T Tauri stars – an early phase in a star&#x27;s life cycle. The paper predicts the signature of radiation from such disks, which is emitted primarily at infrared wavelengths where it dominates over the emission from the star. Excess infrared emission from young stars has become one of the primary methods used to identify these objects in astronomical surveys.

In 1971, he became Professor of Astrophysics (1909) and later the first director of the Institute of Astronomy, Cambridge, when it formed from the merger of the Institute of Theoretical Astrophysics and the Cambridge Observatories in 1972.

In the 1980s, he was a member of a group of astronomers known as the &#x27;Seven Samurai&#x27; (with Sandra Faber, David Burstein, Alan Dressler, Roger Davies, Roberto Terlevich, and Gary A. Wegner) who postulated the existence of the Great Attractor, a huge, diffuse region of material around 250 million light-years away that results in the observed motion of our local galaxies.

Lynden-Bell, Roger Griffin, Neville Woolf, and Wallace L. W. Sargent were in the 2015 documentary film &quot;Star Men&quot; that covered some of their professional accomplishments at their fiftieth reunion to redo a memorable hike.

His research in the last years of his life mainly focused on astrophysical jets and general relativity.

==Personal life and death==
Donald was married to Ruth Lynden-Bell, a professor of chemistry at the University of Cambridge, on 1 July 1961.

Lynden-Bell died at his home in Cambridge on 6 February 2018, at the age of 82. He had a stroke in the months preceding his death, and never fully recovered. Responding to news of his death, John Zarnecki, then President of the Royal Astronomical Society, praised Lynden-Bell&#x27;s contributions to astronomy, particularly his &quot;incisive questions at scientific meetings and being generous in his support for others&quot;.

<doc id="726604" wikidata="Q3326551" url="?curid=726604" title="Social hygiene movement">
<text>In the United States, the social hygiene movement was an attempt by Progressive Era reformers in the late 19th and early 20th century to control venereal disease, regulate prostitution and vice, and disseminate sexual education through the use of scientific research methods and modern media techniques. Social hygiene as a profession grew alongside social work and other public health movements of the era. Social hygienists emphasized sexual continence and strict self-discipline as a solution to societal ills, tracing prostitution, drug use and illegitimacy to rapid urbanization. The movement remained alive throughout much of the 20th century and found its way into American schools, where it was transmitted in the form of classroom films about menstruation, sexually transmitted disease, drug abuse and acceptable sexual behavior in addition to an array of pamphlets, posters, textbooks and films.

==History==
The social hygiene movement of the late 19th and early 20th was rooted in the reformist zeal of the Progressive Era. Its aims were the diminishment if not elimination of vice, including prostitution, and venereal disease via educating the public about sex. A mental hygiene movement also developed, partly separately and now generally known as mental health, although the older term is still in use, e.g. in New York state&#x27;s law. The social hygiene movement represented a rationalized, professionalized version of the earlier social purity movement. 

Many reformers, such as Marie Stopes, were also proponents of eugenics. Inspired by Charles Darwin&#x27;s theory of natural selection, they argued for the sterilisation of certain groups, even racial groups, in society. Indeed, by the 1930s thousands of forced sterilizations of people deemed undesirable took place in America and other countries each year. This continued for several more decades in some countries, though after 1945, the movement was largely discredited.

===Social hygiene movement===
Social hygiene as a profession grew alongside social work and other public health movements of the era. Social hygienists emphasized sexual continence and strict self-discipline as a solution to societal ills, tracing prostitution, drug use and illegitimacy to rapid urbanization.

The social hygiene movement began to gain momentum and in 1913 making the movement part of publishings such as the American Journal of Public Health. The American Social Hygiene Association was officially formed in 1913. It was later renamed to the American Social Health Association and, in 2012, the American Sexual Health Association.

The movement remained alive throughout much of the 20th century and found its way into American schools, where it was transmitted in the form of classroom films about menstruation, sexually transmitted disease, drug abuse and acceptable sexual behavior in addition to an array of pamphlets, posters, textbooks and films.

===Soviet Union===
The Social hygiene approach was adopted in medical schools in the Soviet Union in the 1920s and was supported by the Commissariat of Public Health. The definition adopted by Commissar Nikolai Semashko was less focussed on eugenics and more in line with what is now regarded as public health: “study of the influence of economic and social factors on the incidence of disease and on the ways to make the population healthy”. 

The State Institute for Social Hygiene opened in 1923. This approach was not popular with educators or with medical students. In 1930 the institute was renamed the Institute of Organisation of Health Care and Hygiene.

===American Social Hygiene Association===
The American Social Hygiene Association partnered with the government during World War I. The American Social Hygiene Association provided social hygiene health and sexual health information to the soldiers in hopes that this education would help take fewer soldiers out of action from venereal diseases.

The idea of prostitution was considered a “necessary evil” in light of an artificial demand that had been created through various forms including political corruption and advertising. With further investigation into the business of prostitution cities that did not contain commercialized prostitution had less crime and appeared to be in better shape than those who contained such. Most prostitutes that had been examined were found to have venereal diseases, but with that included a negative social stigma which stopped people from getting examined and so there became a campaign involving several organizations to suppress prostitution and begin educating people about sex and venereal diseases. The two organizations that had developed were the American Vigilance Association, fighting prostitution, and the American Federation for Sex Hygiene. Finally, the two organizations had realized their mutual interest and called a meeting in Buffalo, New York which the term “social hygiene” was coined. By 1914 the organizations formed into one, calling themselves, “The American Social Hygiene Association”.

===Progressive Era===
The social hygiene movement helped with the development of the management of prostitution in the Progressive Era. The Progressive Era was the turning point in the state&#x27;s regulations of sexuality. It was said that the Progressive Era had physicians and women moral reformers working together to help manage prostitution and educate the people on social hygiene.

===Racial Hygiene Association===
This link between racial hygiene and social hygiene movements can be seen in Australia, where the Racial Hygiene Association of New South Wales is now named The Family Planning Association.

===Negro Project===
In the 1940s during World War II, ASHA (American Social Hygiene Association) launched a new project called the Negro Project, also known as the Negro Venereal Disease Education Project. The aim of this project was to address the widespread presence of venereal diseases among African Americans. 

In the early 1940s, ASHA drafted a grant proposal and in 1942 it was sent to prospective funding agencies. The proposal emphasized two main aspects of the Negro Project, “that the higher rate of prevalence of venereal diseases among the black population was alarming; and two, that this higher prevalence rate was not the fault of the black community.” (A. Sharma) The main purpose of the Negro Project was to provide educational materials and methods for instruction regarding syphilis. Some of the intended materials to be produced were pamphlets, posters, and motion pictures specifically aimed at the African American community. 

After being rejected by private funding organizations, the project found support from the Social Protection Division of the Federal Security Agency. 

In November 1943, in New York City, the Negro Project held its first major activity which was the National Conference on Wartime Problems in Venereal Disease Control. This conference was held so that they could form a committee and create an action plan for the Negro Project. After the national conference in 1943, project officials held meetings at regional level, predominantly in Southern states. However, in 1945 the records of the project suddenly go silent and no further activity for this project was documented in ASHA records. It has been speculated that due to the Social Protection Division of the Federal Security Agency being dissolved in the 1940s, the funds for the project dried up causing the project to end.

===Mental hygiene movement===
In regards to the mental hygiene movement, it helped providers realize that the problems of mental health and prevention of disease goes beyond providers in hospitals. The movement helped healthcare train their providers properly. It also helped with studies of more sympathetic treatment for mental health patients.

<doc id="726607" wikidata="Q571833" url="?curid=726607" title="Antena 3 (Spanish TV channel)">
<text>Antena 3 (&quot;Antena Tres&quot;) is a Spanish terrestrial television channel part of Atresmedia, of which it is the flagship station. Its current headquarters are located in San Sebastián de los Reyes.

Some of the most popular programmes broadcast by Antena 3 include &quot;Aquí no hay quien viva&quot;, &quot;Física o Química&quot;, &quot;El barco&quot;, &quot;Los Protegidos&quot;, &quot;The Simpsons&quot; and &quot;El Internado&quot;. Some of its programmes, such as &quot;Física o Química&quot;, &quot;Money Heist&quot; and &quot;Your Face Sounds Familiar&quot; gained international success and recognition, leading to many duplicate programmes being produced worldwide.

Antena 3 is generally listed as the third channel on television sets throughout Spain, except in certain autonomous communities where the regional station occupies channel number 3.

== History ==
It was launched on Christmas Day, 25 December 1989 when it began test transmissions, and then later, it commenced its official broadcasts throughout Spain exactly one month later on 25 January 1990 with a programme fronted by journalist Miguel Ángel Nieto, thus becoming Spain&#x27;s first nationwide private television station.

The channel presented a new brand identity on 24 January 2025, introduced on 25 January, the 35th anniversary of its regular broadcasts, creating a modern and &quot;timeless&quot; identity. A new custom typeface was created.

==Programming==
The biggest winners for the channel are &quot;The Simpsons&quot;, &quot;Velvet&quot;, &quot;DEC&quot;, &quot;El Diario&quot; (a daily talk show run by Sandra Daviú) and the &quot;Noticias&quot; (particularly the evening edition run by Matías Prats).

Antena 3 dramas and sitcoms in the past and present include &quot;Manos a la obra&quot;, &quot;Canguros&quot;, &quot;La casa de los líos&quot;, &quot;Los lahkldrones van a la oficina&quot;, &quot;Hermanos de leche&quot;, &quot;Vecinos&quot;, &quot;Cañas y barro&quot;, &quot;Compañeros&quot;, &quot;Un paso adelante&quot;, &quot;Policías&quot;, &quot;Fuego&quot;, &quot;El pantano&quot;, &quot;Ada madrina&quot;, &quot;Dime que me quieres&quot;, &quot;Lleno por favor&quot;, &quot;¿Quién da la vez?&quot;, &quot;Farmacia de guardia&quot;, &quot;Menudo es mi padre&quot;, &quot;Nada es para siempre&quot;, &quot;Aquí no hay quien viva&quot;, and &quot;Los hombres de Paco&quot;.

==Antena 3 Internacional==
Antena 3 Internacional is a pay television channel owned by Atresmedia Internacional, with distribution handled by MVS Comunicaciones. The channel serves the Americas (including the United States, Mexico and Central America), the Caribbean and Europe. Antena 3 Internacional was founded in 1995. The channel retransmits programmes from the domestic Antena 3 schedule and other programmes from Atresmedia channels (LaSexta, Neox, Nova, Mega and Atreseries), along with live news programming, but due to rights issues with others who might hold rights to their shows in the Americas, some programming might air on a delay of several months or only after its original run has been completed.

==Logos==
==Fake Gdim Izig photos scandal (Western Sahara)==

Antena 3 was fined €215,000 by the Court of First Instance of Brussels for repeatedly misusing fake photos of homicide to illustrate what the channel presented as Moroccan police brutality at Gdim Izig (Laayoune) in Western Sahara. The pictures showed the bodies of victims of a quadruple homicide in Casablanca. The Rachidi family whose relatives&#x27; photos have been &quot;repeatedly misused in bad faith&quot; is still awaiting for &quot;a public apology&quot; from Antena 3.

<text>Carl Keenan Seyfert (February 11, 1911 – June 13, 1960) was an American astronomer. He is best known for his 1943 research paper on high-excitation line emission from the centers of some spiral galaxies, which are named Seyfert galaxies after him. Seyfert&#x27;s Sextet, a group of galaxies, is also named after him.

==Biography==
Seyfert was born and raised in Cleveland, Ohio, then attended Harvard University, starting in 1929. He earned his B.S. and M.S. degrees in 1933, and his Ph.D. in astronomy in 1936. His thesis was &quot;Studies of the External Galaxies&quot;, supervised by Harlow Shapley. The thesis dealt with colors and magnitudes of galaxies.

In 1935 Seyfert married astronomer Muriel Elizabeth Mussels, who was a former Harvard computer who made contributions to the study of ring nebulae. They had two children, daughter Gail Carol and son Carl Keenan Seyfert, Jr.

In 1936 Seyfert joined the staff of the new McDonald Observatory in Texas, where he helped get the observatory started. He stayed until 1940, working with Daniel M. Popper on the properties of faint B stars and continuing his work on colors in spiral galaxies.

In 1940 Seyfert went to Mount Wilson Observatory as a fellow with the National Research Council. He stayed until 1942, studying a class of active galaxies now called &quot;Seyfert galaxies&quot;. In 1942 he returned to Cleveland, at Case Institute of Technology, where he taught navigation to military personnel and participated in secret military research. He also carried out some astronomical research at the Warner and Swasey Observatory of the Case Institute.

In 1946 Seyfert joined the faculty of Vanderbilt University in Nashville, Tennessee. The astronomy program at Vanderbilt was very small at the time. The university had only a small observatory, equipped with a refractor, and only a modest teaching program. Seyfert worked diligently to improve the teaching program and to raise funds to build a new observatory. Within a few years, he had obtained significant public support from the Nashville community. As the result, the Arthur J. Dyer Observatory with its reflector was completed in December 1953. Seyfert became director of the new observatory, a position he held until his death. Seyfert was also the local weatherman for WSM-TV, Nashville&#x27;s NBC affiliate, during the 1950s.

Seyfert died in an automobile accident in Nashville on June 13, 1960; a residential street near the Dyer Observatory was subsequently renamed &quot;Carl Seyfert Memorial Drive&quot; in his honor. A 1949 oil portrait of Seyfert by his wife Muriel Mussels Seyfert, who was a former Harvard computer, hangs in the Dyer Observatory.

==Contributions to astronomy==
Carl Seyfert published many papers in the astronomical literature, on a wide variety of topics in stellar and galactic astronomy, as well as on observing methods and instrumentation.

In 1943 he published a paper on galaxies with bright nuclei that emit light with emission line spectra with characteristically broadened emission lines. The prototype example is Messier 77 (NGC 1068). It is this class of galaxies that is now known as Seyfert galaxies, in his honor.

During his time at the Case Institute, he and Jason John Nassau obtained the first good color images of nebulae and stellar spectra. In 1951 he observed and described a group of galaxies around NGC 6027, now known as Seyfert&#x27;s Sextet. He was an active innovator in instrumentation, being involved in new techniques such as the astronomical use of photomultiplier tubes and television techniques, and electronically controlled telescope drives.

The lunar crater Seyfert is named in his honor (29.1N, 114.6E, 110 km diameter). The telescope at Dyer Observatory was renamed after him.

<doc id="726615" wikidata="Q1572384" url="?curid=726615" title="Paget's disease of the breast">
<text>Paget&#x27;s disease of the breast (also known as mammary Paget&#x27;s disease) is a rare skin change at the nipple nearly always associated with underlying breast cancer. Paget&#x27;s disease of the breast was first described by Sir James Paget in 1874. The condition is an uncommon disease accounting for 1 to 4% of all breast cancers cases. 92% to 100% of patients with Paget&#x27;s disease of the breast have an underlying breast cancer.

The condition in itself often appears innocuous, limited to a surface appearance and it is sometimes dismissed, although it is actually indicative of underlying breast cancer.

==Signs and symptoms==
Paget&#x27;s disease of the breast can affect the nipple and areola: the nipple is typically affected first and then the skin changes spread to the areola. It is common for symptoms to wax and wane. Symptoms typically only affect one breast and may include:
* &quot;Skin:&quot; The first symptom is usually an eczema-like rash. The skin of the nipple and areola may be red, itchy, or tingly. After a period of time, the skin may become flaky, scaly, or thickened. Many patients do not visit the doctor because they assume Paget&#x27;s disease of the breast to be minor contact dermatitis or eczema.
* &quot;Nipple discharge:&quot; A discharge, which may be yellow or bloody, may ooze from the area.
* &quot;Nipple changes:&quot; The nipple may become inverted.
* &quot;Breast changes:&quot; Palpable lumps or masses may be present. There may be redness, oozing and crusting, and a sore that does not heal.

A person with Paget&#x27;s disease of the breast may experience signs and symptoms for several months before a diagnosis is made.

==Pathophysiology==

Paget&#x27;s disease of the breast is characterized by Paget cells: large cells with clear cytoplasm (clear halo) and eccentric (not centered), hyperchromic (darkly colored) nuclei found throughout the epidermis.

There is some controversy as to whether these cancer cells travel through the ductal system of the breast to the nipple, or whether these cells result from in situ malignant transformation.

The most widely accepted theory of how Paget&#x27;s disease of the breast arises is the migratory theory: ductal carcinoma in situ cancerous cells migrate into the lactiferous sinuses and out of the nipple onto the skin. Cancer cells disrupt the normal epithelial barrier and fluid accumulates on the surface of the skin, resulting in the crusting of the skin of the nipple and/ or areola.

==Diagnosis==
During a physical examination, the provider will likely conduct a breast examination: evaluating the appearance of the skin on and around the nipples, and feeling for any lumps or areas of thickening in the breast and armpit.

Paget&#x27;s disease of the breast is difficult to diagnose by physical exam alone due to its resemblance to dermatitis and eczema. One helpful differentiator is that eczema tends to affect the areola first, and then the nipple, whereas Paget&#x27;s disease of the breast typically begins at the nipple and spreads outwards. In addition, nipple eczema is typically responsive to topical steroid application, while Paget&#x27;s disease of the breast will not improve with topical steroid use.

Mammogram and biopsy with cytopathology are common confirmatory tests. In biopsy, a tissue sample removed from the affected area is then examined under the microscope by a pathologist, who distinguishes Paget cells from other cell types by staining tissues to identify specific cells (immunohistochemistry).

Less commonly, samples of nipple discharge may also be examined under the microscope to determine whether Paget cells are present. In addition, ultrasound of the breast may be performed in the absence of positive findings on mammography.

== Treatment ==
Paget&#x27;s disease of the breast is a symptom of underlying breast cancer. Treatment is variable and is determined by the type of breast cancer in addition to its staging and prognostic considerations. Management often involves a lumpectomy or mastectomy to surgically remove the tumour.Chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy may also be necessary.

Patients with Paget&#x27;s disease of the breast that has not spread beyond the nipple are often treated with breast-conserving surgery: removal of the cancerous area of the nipple and areola, but conservation of the rest of the breast. Patients then usually undergo radiation therapy after surgery as an adjuvant treatment to prevent recurrence.

In most cases, adjuvant treatment is part of the treatment schema. Adjuvant therapy is given to patients with cancer as a secondary form of treatment to minimize the risk of recurrence by targeting undetectable metastases. Whether adjuvant therapy is needed depends upon the type of cancer and its staging. In Paget&#x27;s disease of the breast, the most common type of adjuvant therapy is radiation following breast-conservative surgery as discussed above.

Paget&#x27;s disease of the breast with underlying breast cancer is primarily treated with mastectomy. In cases of invasive cancer, radical mastectomy is performed: removal of the breast, the lining over the chest muscles, and affected lymph nodes from under the arm. In cases of noninvasive cancers, simple mastectomy are performed in which only the breast with the lining over the chest muscles is removed.

==Prognosis==
Three factors are evaluated when determining prognosis for breast cancer: whether there is a palpable mass, whether lymph nodes have cancer cells in them, and whether there is an underlying metastatic cancer. Prognosis of Paget&#x27;s disease of the breast with underlying breast cancer depends on these three factors of the underlying cancer. Whether or not a patient has Paget&#x27;s disease of the breast does not affect their prognosis in the presence of underlying breast cancer.

Patients with Paget&#x27;s disease of the breast and no underlying breast cancer have a 5-year relative survival rate of 82.6%.

==Epidemiology==
Most patients diagnosed with Paget&#x27;s disease of the breast are over age 50, but rare cases have been diagnosed in patients in their 20s. The average age at diagnosis is 57. The disease is rare among both women and men, but more common in women.

<doc id="726618" wikidata="Q7288271" url="?curid=726618" title="Ralph Wiley">
<text>Ralph Heygood Wiley Jr. (April 12, 1952 – June 13, 2004) was an American sports journalist who wrote for &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; and ESPN&#x27;s Page 2. He was well known for his distinctive literary tone and his writings on race in America.

== Early life ==
Born in Memphis, Tennessee, Wiley attended Knoxville College from 1972 to 1975, where he played college football. After suffering an injury, he landed his first professional journalism job at the &quot;Knoxville Spectrum&quot;. He was a member of Kappa Alpha Psi fraternity.

== Career ==
Upon graduation, Wiley earned a position at the &quot;Oakland Tribune&quot;, where he quickly climbed up the ranks from copy boy to beat writer and eventually became a regular columnist. In 1980, he coined the famous phrase &quot;Billy Ball&quot; to describe the managerial style of Billy Martin. In 1982, he was hired by &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot;, where he wrote 28 cover stories over a nine-year period, mainly about boxing, football, and baseball.

Wiley published several books during the course of his career, including &quot;Serenity, A Boxing Memoir&quot;; &quot;Why Black People Tend To Shout&quot;; and &quot;By Any Means Necessary: The Trials and Tribulations of Making Malcolm X&quot;, with Spike Lee.

Additionally, Wiley wrote articles for &quot;GQ&quot;, &quot;Premiere&quot;, and &quot;National Geographic&quot;. He was a weekly contributor to ESPN&#x27;s Page 2, where he wrote more than 240 columns. His presence on TV included ESPN&#x27;s &quot;The Sports Reporters&quot; and regular guest appearances on &quot;SportsCenter&quot;.

=== Style ===
Wiley was famous for his well-regarded essays on race in America. He was known for his ability to mix street vernacular with literary references, and for his witty, erudite, and sometimes forceful writing style. When writing for ESPN&#x27;s Page 2, in skirting the line between sports journalism and literary fiction, Wiley wrote many articles in the third person, featuring discursive, jazz-inflected prose and dialogue conducted between himself and a fictionalized character whose identity the writer left deliberately obscure.

== Death ==
Wiley died of a heart attack at the age of 52 on June 13, 2004, while watching Game 4 of the 2004 NBA Finals. Survivors included his companion, Susan Peacock of Orlando; his mother, Dorothy Brown of Washington, D.C.; a son from his marriage to Holly Cypress, Colen C. &quot;Cole&quot; Wiley; a daughter from his marriage to Monica Valdiviez-Wiley, Magdalena Elizabeth “Maggie” Valdiviez-Wiley; and a half brother, Samuel Graham of Memphis.

<text>Maarten Schmidt (28 December 1929 – 17 September 2022) was a Dutch-born American astronomer who first measured the distances of quasars. He was the first astronomer to identify a quasar, and so was pictured on the March cover of &quot;Time&quot; magazine in 1966.

==Early life==
Schmidt was born in Groningen, The Netherlands, on 28 December 1929. His father, Wilhelm, worked as an accountant for the Dutch government; his mother, Annie Wilhelmina (Haringhuizen), was a housewife. Schmidt studied math and physics at the University of Groningen, graduating with a bachelor&#x27;s degree in 1949 before obtaining a master&#x27;s degree the following year. He then commenced doctoral studies at Leiden University under Jan Oort. Schmidt was awarded a Doctor of Philosophy from Leiden Observatory in 1956.

==Career==
After completing his doctorate, Schmidt resided in the United States for two years on a Carnegie Fellowship. He returned briefly to the Netherlands, but ultimately emigrated to the US on a permanent basis in 1959 to work at the California Institute of Technology. In the beginning, he worked on theories about the mass distribution and dynamics of galaxies. Of particular note from this period was his formulation of what has become known as the Schmidt law, which relates the density of interstellar gas to the rate of star formation occurring in that gas. He later began a study of the light spectra of radio sources. In 1963, using the 200-inch reflector telescope at the Palomar Observatory, Schmidt identified the visible object corresponding to one of these radio sources, known as 3C 273 and also studied its spectrum. While its star-like appearance suggested it was relatively nearby, the spectrum of 3C 273 proved to have what was at the time a high redshift of 0.158, showing that it lay far beyond the Milky Way, and thus possessed an extraordinarily high luminosity. Schmidt termed 3C 273 a &quot;quasi-stellar&quot; object or quasar; thousands have since been identified.

Schmidt was featured on the cover of &quot;Time&quot; magazine in March 1966. He was later a co-recipient, with Donald Lynden-Bell, of the inaugural Kavli Prize for Astrophysics in 2008.

He lectured a total of 33 times at the Summer Science Program. 

==Personal life==
Schmidt married Cornelia Tom in 1955. They met at a party hosted by Oort, and remained married until her death in 2020. Together, they had three daughters: Anne, Elizabeth, and Marijke.

Schmidt died on 17 September 2022 at his home in Fresno, California. He was 92 years old.

<text>Isaac Jogues (10 January 1607 – 18 October 1646) was a French missionary and martyr who traveled and worked among the Iroquois, Huron, and other Native populations in North America. He was the first European to name Lake George, calling it (Lake of the Blessed Sacrament). In 1646, Jogues was martyred by the Mohawk at their village of Ossernenon, near the Mohawk River.

Jogues, Jean de Brébeuf and six other martyred missionaries, all Jesuit priests or laypeople associated with them, were canonized by the Catholic Church in 1930; they are known as the Canadian Martyrs, or the North American Martyrs. A shrine was built in their honor at Auriesville, New York, formerly believed to be that of the Mohawk village. Their feast day is celebrated on 19 October in the General Roman Calendar and 26 September in Canada.

==Early life and education==
Isaac Jogues was born to Laurent Jogues and Françoise de Sainte-Mesmin on 10 January 1607. He was born in Orléans, France, into a bourgeois family, where he was the fifth of nine children. He was educated at home until the age of ten, at which point he began attending Jesuit schools. In 1624, at the age of seventeen, he entered the Jesuit novitiate at Rouen in Northern France. Here, his Master of Novices was Louis Lallemant. The Jesuit community had a strong missionary spirit, beginning in 1625 with their first mission to New France, including missionary pioneers, Énemond Massé, and later, Jean de Brébeuf. Lallement had two brothers and a nephew serving as missionaries in the colony of New France. These Jesuit missionaries inspired Jogues, and he aspired to follow in their footsteps.

Jogues professed simple vows in 1626, and went to study philosophy at the royal college of La Flèche. In 1629, he taught humanities to boys in Rouen. In 1633, Jogues was sent to the Collège de Clermont in Paris to pursue his studies in Theology. In 1636, he was ordained a priest at Clermont.

== Early missions ==
In 1636 missionary fathers Brébeuf, Charles Lallemant and Massé returned from New France. They told Jogues of the hardships, treacheries, and tortures which ordinarily awaited missionaries in New France. Their accounts however, increased Jogues&#x27; desire to &quot;devote himself to labour there for the conversion and welfare of the natives&quot;. Soon after Jogues was ordained, he accepted service in the missions and embarked to New France with several other missionaries, among them Charles Garnier. Jogues was assigned as a missionary to the Huron and Algonquian peoples; both were allies of the French in Quebec.

Jogues sailed from France on 8 April 1636, and eight weeks later, his ship dropped anchor in the Baie des Chaleurs. Jogues arrived in Quebec only several weeks later, on 2 July. On arrival, Jogues wrote to his mother: &quot;I do not know it is to enter Heaven, but this I know—that it would be difficult to experience in this world a joy more excessive and more overflowing than I felt in setting foot in the New World, and celebrating my first Mass on the day of Visitation.&quot; 

Jogues joined Jean de Brébeuf, the Superior of the Jesuit Mission, at their settlement on Lake Huron, the village of St-Joseph (Ihonatiria), on 11 September. Upon his arrival, Jogues was stricken by fever. Soon after that, a similar epidemic broke out among other Jesuits and the native people. Due to recurring epidemics, the Huron blamed the Black Coats, as they called the Jesuits, threatening to kill them all. Father Brébeuf conciliated them, and by the following year, relations had improved as evidenced by one of his reports: &quot;We are gladly heard, and there is scarcely a village that has not invited us to go to it... And at last, it is understood from our whole conduct that we have not come to buy skins or to carry on any traffic, but solely to teach them and to procure them their souls&#x27; health.&quot;

For six years, Jogues lived in the village of St-Joseph and learned the Hurons&#x27; ways and language. The missionaries &quot;accommodated themselves to the customs and food of the savages&quot; as much as possible to show the Indians that they intended to share their life. Gradually, the native people began to accept Jogues. This did not last long, however, as there were some Indigenous people who had been &quot;among the English and Dutch settlers to the south&quot; who spread reports that the missionaries brought &quot;calamity wherever they went and that they had in consequence been driven out of Europe.&quot;

Jogues traveled with Garnier to the Petun, a first nations band located in modern-day southern Ontario, who were also known as the Tobacco Nation for their chief commodity crop. The natives of the village were so uninviting to the missionaries that the Fathers thought it would be impossible to do any missionary work among them. The rumors that had encircled them spread to the village and quickly discovered that their cause was just as hopeless as in the former place. They traveled from village to village, until after a couple of months, they decided that they could not continue to do their missionary work. Their luck changed, however, when in 1639, the new superior of the Jesuit Mission, Father Jérôme Lalemant, entrusted the building of Fort Sainte-Marie to Jogues.

In September 1641, Jogues and Charles Raymbaut went into the territory of the Sauteurs (Oijbwe). Some two thousand Indians welcomed them upon their arrival. Jogues settled down to the duties of a resident missioner at St. Mary&#x27;s for some time.

== Capture by the Iroquois ==

On 3 August 1642, Jogues, Guillaume Couture, René Goupil, and a group of Christian Hurons were heading back from Quebec City when they were waylaid by a war party of the Mohawk Nation, part of the Iroquois Confederacy. Jogues allegedly hid in reeds and bushes but decided to leave his hiding place to join the prisoners so that he could comfort them and ensure that their faith in Christianity remained strong. Shortly after that, and in retaliation for comforting a tortured Guillaume Couture, the Mohawk beat Jogues with sticks, tore out his fingernails, then gnawed the ends of his fingers until finger bones were visible. The war party then took their captives on a journey to a Mohawk village. The villagers marched them through a gauntlet, consisting of rows of Iroquois armed with rods and sticks, beating the prisoners walking in single-file. Afterward, the Iroquois forced Jogues and the prisoners onto an elevated platform where they were mocked. A captive Algonquin woman then cut off Jogues&#x27; thumb. At night, the prisoners were tied spread-eagled in a cabin. Children threw burning coals onto their bodies. Three days later, Jogues and the prisoners were marched from one village to another, where the Iroquois flogged them in gauntlets and jabbed sticks into their wounds and sores. At the third village, Jogues was hung from a wooden plank and nearly lost consciousness until an Iroquois had pity on him and cut him free. Throughout his captivity, Jogues comforted, baptized, heard confession from, and absolved the other prisoners.

Hearing of their capture, Arent van Curler, &quot;commis&quot; of Rensselaerswyck, visited the &quot;first castle&quot; and attempted to ransom them, but without success as the Mohawk were not inclined to release them at that time. Van Curler was able to elicit a promise not to kill the captives. Instead of being put to death or integrated into a Mohawk family, Jogues remained a captive at large. Perpetually malnourished and inadequately dressed for the harsh winters, he spent his days gathering wood, praying, and proselytizing his captors. Seeking solace in his faith, Jogues prayed so intensely that he had visions: in one, he suddenly appeared in a bookstore covered in crosses and bought a book that reminded him that, to enter into Heaven, it was necessary to experience many tribulations. His captivity dragged on, lasting about a year, during which he experienced severe malnourishment and exposure to the cold. During this period, some noteworthy incidents were when he saved the life of a pregnant woman that had fallen into a deep, fast-flowing creek during the winter and when he baptized the Iroquois man who had freed him from the wooden torture device.
In the autumn of 1643, the Mohawk were persuaded to bring the priest with them when they came to Beverwijck to trade. Once there, Van Curler helped Jogues escape, hiding him in his barn until a deal could be reached. The Frenchman put on a ship to take him downriver. Reformed minister Johannes Megapolensis accompanied him to New Amsterdam, where Jogues stayed with the minister while waiting for a ship to take him to France. Jogues was the first Catholic priest to visit Manhattan Island. From there, he sailed back to France.

== Return to France ==
Pope Urban VIII considered Jogues a &quot;living martyr&quot; and gave him dispensation to say Mass with his mutilated hand. Under Catholic Church law of the time, the Blessed Sacrament could not be touched with any fingers but the thumb and forefinger. Jogues was unable to follow this law after losing two fingers while in Iroquois captivity, resulting in the requirement for dispensation by the pope. Jogues visited his mother in Orléans, but was eager to return to the missions. Jogues experienced regret over his time in captivity, and a longing for martyrdom that motivated his return to New France in 1644 after only a year and a half in France, first to Quebec, followed by a trip to Wendake.

== Return to New France and death ==
In the spring of 1646, Jogues returned to Iroquois territory, along with Jean de Lalande, to act as the French ambassador to the Mohawk. His ambassadorship was intended to maintain the tentative peace reached in 1645 between the Iroquois and the French, the Huron and the Algonquin. This was done to ensure a safe passage for trade and travel.

Jogues and Lalande were met with hesitation upon arrival, as some Mohawk regarded missionaries as evil practitioners of foreign magic. The Europeans transmitted European diseases, such as smallpox and measles, that spread among Native Americans. These diseases resulted in high fatality rates among the Mohawk, who lacked immunity to the new diseases. When the Mohawk suffered yet another outbreak of infectious disease and crop failure at Ossernenon, they blamed these unfortunate events on Catholic paraphernalia left behind by the Jesuits, which the Mohawks perceived as magically harmful. Additionally, as a result of his previous experience on the territory, Jogues demonstrated an uncanny knowledge of the territory, which the Mohawks perceived as threatening.

On 18 October 1646, the Mohawks killed Jogues with a tomahawk; they killed LaLande the next day. They threw the missionaries&#x27; bodies into the Mohawk River. The killing seems to have been the work of an anti-French faction within the Mohawk community.

The story holds a curious double martyrdom of Jogues. Aboriginal allies of the French captured Jogues&#x27; killer in 1647 and condemned him to death. While awaiting his execution, this man was baptized and renamed with the Christian name of Father Isaac Jogues. His death represented a secondary martyring of Isaac Jogues.

== Attitudes towards martyrdom ==
Jogues&#x27; refusal to escape and how he embraced torture demonstrate selflessness that, like many other Jesuits in New France, he believed that being martyred would mean partaking in the torment that Jesus had endured on the cross. This would indicate his acceptance &quot;into the pantheon of heroes whose physical and spiritual strength had been equal to the cruel persecutions inflicted on the primitive church.&quot; Jogues is quoted as saying: &quot;He [Jesus] was making us share his sufferings, and admitting us to participate in his crosses.&quot;

At another point, Jogues speaks of, &quot;The procession [of torture victims] beginning to enter this narrow way of Paradise... it was indeed then that I could say with my Lord and master, ,—&#x27;Sinners have built and left monuments and marks of their rage upon my back.&#x27;&quot; Jogues regarded his torture, and the death he thought would follow, as allowing him to imitate, and thus participate in, the passion of Jesus.

== Veneration and legacy ==
Jogues was canonized on 29 June 1930 by Pope Pius XI along with seven other Canadian Martyrs. His feast day is celebrated on 19 October in the General Roman Calendar, and on 26 September in Canada. Jogues and companions are patron saints of North America.
There are several buildings and monuments dedicated to Jogues. The largest of these monuments is the Shrine of the North American Martyrs, built in Auriesville, New York in 1930. It honors Jogues, René Goupil, Louis Lalande, and Kateri Tekakwitha. It was completed in 1930. The shrine also honors Jean de Brébeuf and five of his companions killed in Canada in 1648 and 1649.

There is also the Martyr&#x27;s Shrine located in Midland, Ontario, Canada, which honors the Canadian Martyrs (another term for North American Martyrs).

A seasonal chapel on the east shore of Saratoga Lake, New York is named after Jogues. A statue of Jogues stands in front of the main entrance to the chapel that faces the lake. While he was being taken into captivity, Jogues is said to have been the first European to see this lake.

Fordham University, a Jesuit university in New York, has a dormitory building at its Rose Hill Campus named Martyrs&#x27; Court. The three wings of the building are named after Jogues, René Goupil, and Jean de Lalande.

Another statue of Jogues was erected in 1939, in the village of Lake George, in the Battlefield Park by the lake.

Camp Ondessonk, a Roman Catholic youth camp located in Ozark, Illinois, is named after Jogues&#x27; Mohawk name. The living quarters for campers are named for North American Martyrs and others influenced by their ministry, including Kateri Tekakwitha, Jean de Brébeuf, Noël Chabanel, Antoine Daniel, Charles Garnier, René Goupil, Jean de Lalande, and Gabriel Lalemant.

<text>Wallace Leslie William Sargent (February 15, 1935 – October 29, 2012) was a British-born American astronomer and the Ira S. Bowen Professor of Astronomy at California Institute of Technology.

==Education==
Sargent was born in Elsham, North Lincolnshire, the son of a gardener and a housecleaner, and grew up in Winterton, Lincolnshire. Sargent was the first person in his family to attend high school, and the first pupil from his high school – Scunthorpe Technical High School – to ever attend university. He received his bachelor&#x27;s degree from the University of Manchester in 1956, and his Ph.D. in 1959 from the same institution.

==Career and research==
Sargent spent the majority of his career at California Institute of Technology (Caltech), excepting an absence of four years during which he claims to have had to go back to England to find himself a wife, Anneila Sargent.

Sargent carried out research in many areas of astronomy including stars, galaxies, quasars and active galactic nuclei, quasar absorption lines, and the intergalactic medium. He pioneered the detection of supermassive black holes in galactic nuclei using stellar dynamics, and published the first dynamical measurement of the mass of the black hole in the elliptical galaxy Messier 87.

He supervised the theses of a number of students while at Caltech, including John Huchra, Edwin Turner, Peter J. Young, Charles C. Steidel, and Alex Filippenko.

He was director of the Palomar Observatory from 1997 to 2000.

Donald Lynden-Bell, Roger Griffin, Neville Woolf, and Wal Sargent were in the film &quot;Star Men&quot; that documented some of their professional accomplishments at their fiftieth reunion to redo a memorable hike. The film also revealed the personalities of these men.

===Awards and honors===
*Helen B. Warner Prize for Astronomy (1969)
*Dannie Heineman Prize for Astrophysics (1991)
*Bruce Medal (1994)
*Henry Norris Russell Lectureship (2001)
*Elected a Fellow of the Royal Society (FRS) in 1981
*The Asteroid 11758 Sargent is named in his honor

==Personal life==
Sargent was married to fellow Caltech astronomer Anneila Sargent from 1964 until his death. Although he became a U.S. citizen, he was born in Elsham, England. He was an atheist.

<text>The Faraway Places is an American indie rock band. Originally formed in Boston, Massachusetts, United States, as the Solar Saturday, they changed their name after moving to Los Angeles, California.

==History==
The group issued its first EP as a self-titled affair under the name Solar Saturday in 2001. Members Chris Colthart and Donna Coppola had previously accompanied Papas Fritas on a tour promoting their third album &quot;Buildings and Grounds&quot; (2000). Following a move to Los Angeles, the group reconvened with Colthart, Coppola, Chris Phillips, and Scott Barber, and changed its name to Faraway Places. In 2003, they released a full-length on Eenie Meenie Records, which received enough attention to warrant a European release through the Bella Union label. The record won the group comparisons to XTC and the Elephant 6 collective. A follow-up arrived in 2009.

<doc id="726643" wikidata="Q3305320" url="?curid=726643" title="Melway">
<text>Melway, colloquially referred to as Melways or The Melways, is a street directory for Melbourne, Victoria, Australia and its immediate surrounds, including the city of Geelong. Formerly a highly ubiquitous directory, Melway is currently in its 50th edition, the 2024 edition.

==History==
Melway was conceived by Merv Godfrey and Ray Harrison in the 1950s. After Harrison died in 1961, Iven Mackay was recruited by Merv as the new partner for the project. Godfrey and Mackay developed the first edition of Melway, which was released in May 1966. Melway initially faced skepticism toward its market potential due to its selling price of $2.50, nearly twice that of its nearest competitor. All of the 106 original maps were hand-drawn in ink. First editions of Melway can sell for around $500 on the second-hand market. A reprint of the first edition was released in 2012, and can be purchased from Melway. The original maps from the first edition can be viewed online via a clickable map.

By the early 1980s, Melway was the most popular street directory in Melbourne, holding over 80 per cent of the market, and &quot;Melway&quot; had begun to be used as a generic term for any street directory. 

In 1982, after the fourteenth edition of Melway had been released, it was awarded the International Cartographic Association Excellence Award, as well as the inaugural award for Cartographic Excellence from the Australian Institute of Cartographers. Ausway won the Australian award again in 1994 for its first edition of Sydway.

As of 2001, most motorists in Melbourne had a copy of Melway, as did many taxi drivers, bus drivers, and hire cars. The Victoria Police, fire brigade, ambulance service, Victorian State Emergency Service, St John Ambulance Victoria and for the State government car fleet officially use Melway. Its main competitor is UBD-Gregory&#x27;s, which is the most popular brand in all other states and territories.

==Features==

While primarily a street directory, Melway editions also contain details on public transport (train, tram, and bus routes, tickets and prices), bicycle paths, suburb and postcode details, public parks and reserves, landmarks (such as commercial buildings, telephone boxes, pubs and restaurants), attractions, and also boat mooring details in recognised docks.

In addition to the blue-bordered and red-bordered street maps, there are yellow-bordered maps of university campuses and crematoria. Moreover, there are also green-bordered maps showing routes through the country to Adelaide and Sydney. Many versions of the street directory are obtainable, usually in standard or large-print editions, wall-charts, or an online catalogue.

===Grid references===
In Melbourne it is common for a Melway reference (in the format &quot;Map—Grid reference&quot;, e.g., &quot;59 K5&quot;) to be given along with directions on, for example, an event notice or real estate advertisement. It is generally assumed that everyone has, or has access to, a copy of the directory in Melbourne. By comparison, the UBD reference for a particular &quot;Melways reference&quot; (as it is colloquially known) can be significantly different, but is rarely (if ever) provided. It is generally assumed that all such references, regardless of whether it is explicitly stated or not, are from the Melway directory and not from the UBD. The reverse is true in all other states and territories.

Some organisations provide a Melway year of publication in addition to their map reference (e.g., (2006) 70 F6), to avoid confusion if map references change in newer versions of the directory. However, Melway has kept the need for this to an absolute minimum over the years. It has held off several cartographic features, including a more logical overall tiling of pages across the entire metropolitan area (which do appear in the Sydway and Brisway). That is to protect the integrity and continuity of the original 1966 grid references.

===Cartography===
One of the distinguishing differences of a Melway-style map from other Australian street directories is in the rendering of roads. Rather than the traditional drawing of two lines with the road name printed in-between, (known as &quot;double casing&quot;) Melway maps show a single line with the name above or below the road, in many colours reflecting the identity or usage of the road. This allows for much more detail to fit into the same size map, as well as showing dual carriageways, slip lanes, service roads, speed bumps, roundabouts, and other useful information.

UBD has copied this difference in their Melbourne directory, in a bid to capitalise on the familiarity of Melway. UBD has only attempted this in the Melbourne directory, retaining their usual format for their other directories. The map design was first fully completed by computers in 2000.

==Editions==
There have been 50 editions of Melway since the mid-1960s. A new edition is typically released late one year and denoted as being for the following year. For example, edition 35 was released in August 2007 and denoted as the 2008 Melway. Despite this discrepancy, numerous roads and other features under construction or proposal are included (e.g.Eastlink in the 35th edition). Therefore, editions dating up to 5 or even ten years old could still remain useful.

===List of editions===
==Expansion into other Australian markets==
Melway has spawned an umbrella company known as Ausway, which started producing directories for other cities and towns from the early 1990s onwards. These other directories include:
*&quot;Sydway&quot; – Sydney, introduced 1994
*&quot;Sydway: Central Coast&quot; – Central Coast, New South Wales region, introduced 1999
*&quot;Brisway&quot; – Brisbane, Queensland introduced 2005 and most recent issue was 2017
*&quot;Ballarat Special Edition Melway&quot; – introduced 2008
*&quot;Melway Perth&quot; – Perth, Western Australia, introduced 2010.

<doc id="726650" wikidata="Q2466349" url="?curid=726650" title="Diorama (Silverchair album)">
<text>Diorama is the fourth studio album by Australian alternative rock band Silverchair, released on 31 March 2002 by Atlantic/. It won the 2002 ARIA Music Award for Best Group and Best Rock Album. The album was co-produced by Daniel Johns and David Bottrill. While Bottrill had worked on albums for a variety of other bands, &quot;Diorama&quot; marked the first production credit for lead singer Johns.

Johns wrote most of the album at the piano instead of his usual guitar, while the band took a 12-month break following their previous studio album, &quot;Neon Ballroom&quot;. Silverchair worked with composer Van Dyke Parks on &quot;Diorama&quot;; the album contains numerous orchestral arrangements and power ballads, a change from the grunge music typical of their earlier work, but consistent with the band&#x27;s previous orchestrations on &quot;Neon Ballroom&quot;. The album&#x27;s title refers to &quot;a world within a world&quot;. Four singles were released: &quot;The Greatest View&quot;, &quot;Without You&quot;, &quot;Luv Your Life&quot;, &quot;Across the Night&quot;. All appeared on the Australian singles chart.

&quot;Diorama&quot; was successful in the charts but was not as well received by critics as the band&#x27;s earlier albums. It reached number one on the Australian Recording Industry Association (ARIA) Albums Chart and received a rating of 71 (out of 100) on review aggregator Metacritic. It was certified triple-platinum by ARIA, selling in excess of 210,000 copies, and won five ARIA Awards in 2002. &quot;Diorama&quot; was nominated for Highest-Selling Album in 2003, and three songs from the album were nominated for awards over the two years.

==Recording and production==
On &quot;Diorama&quot;, Silverchair worked with a new producer, David Bottrill, who replaced Nick Launay. Though Launay had produced the band&#x27;s three previous albums, lead singer Daniel Johns decided he needed someone &quot;who understood where he wanted to go&quot;. Johns believed &quot;Diorama&quot; would be &quot;the kind of record that people were either going to be into or were really going to hate&quot;, and needed a producer who would understand the band&#x27;s new direction. He interviewed several candidates, eventually choosing Bottrill and taking the role of co-producer himself.

Johns initially recorded eight songs, only to delete the files thinking they were too similar to tracks on the previous album, &quot;Neon Ballroom&quot;. Leaving the security and darkness of his earlier work, he restarted from scratch to create something more uplifting. &quot;Diorama&quot; represented a radical change in Silverchair&#x27;s musical structure; the heavy grunge influence on their prior work was replaced by string and horn ensembles and highly complex song structures. Johns felt more comfortable in making this radical change rather than a minor one, finding it helped him to regain his passion for music, which had diminished during the grunge days. Johns wrote much of the album at a baby grand piano; he had previously taught himself the instrument and composed songs on it for the first time with &quot;Diorama&quot;. This change in songwriting technique had a significant effect on the sound of the album; Johns commented on the difference in how his vocals resonated with piano as compared to guitar. He worked with others in developing the album; Van Dyke Parks (Beach Boys, U2) collaborated on orchestral arrangements, and the pair spent much of their recording time attempting to describe the music in metaphorical terms, with Johns describing Parks&#x27; orchestral swells as &quot;tidal waves&quot; and violins as &quot;a flock of birds&quot;. The pair described the collaborative experience as &quot;mind-blowing&quot;. A DVD titled &quot;Across the Night: The Creation of Diorama&quot; was released in 2002, featuring interviews with Johns and Parks.

Several songs on &quot;Diorama&quot; were inspired by Johns&#x27; then-girlfriend Natalie Imbruglia, but he cautioned against possible misinterpretations of the songs, stating: &quot;Everyone will think that any lyric that&#x27;s about someone in a positive light will be about her&quot; and noting that there were other people he cared for about whom he wrote the songs. Johns denied rumours that he had written songs intending Imbruglia to sing them.

Silverchair intended to tour supporting &quot;Diorama&quot; following its release, but plans were postponed when Johns developed reactive arthritis, causing his joints to swell and making guitar playing and singing too painful. After performing &quot;The Greatest View&quot; at the 2002 ARIA Awards, Johns said that he wanted &quot;to perform [&quot;Diorama&quot;″s] 11 songs at least once in front of an audience&quot; before laying the album to rest. He travelled to California to receive treatments for his arthritis, including daily physiotherapy.

==Album and single releases==

Following a 31 March 2002 release on record label , &quot;Diorama&quot; reached number one on the ARIA Albums Chart on 14 April, making it Silverchair&#x27;s fourth chart-topping album. It went on to be certified triple-platinum by ARIA, indicating sales in excess of 210,000 copies. The album peaked at number seven in New Zealand, thirteen in Austria, forty in Switzerland, and 116 in France. &quot;Diorama&quot; reached number ninety-one on the U.S. &quot;Billboard&quot; 200.

The first single, &quot;The Greatest View&quot;, was released in advance of the album on 28 January 2002. It reached number three in Australia, where it was also certified gold, and number four in New Zealand and Canada. It charted at number thirty-six on &quot;Billboard&quot;″s Hot Modern Rock Tracks in 2007 when re-released alongside the band&#x27;s next album, &quot;Young Modern&quot;. Johns wrote &quot;The Greatest View&quot; as a response to the media &quot;always watching [him] in different ways&quot;. It was not intended to be aggressive but rather a straightforward commentary on the media frenzy that had surrounded the band for many years.

On 13 May 2002, &quot;Without You&quot; was released as the second single. It peaked at number eight in Australia but dropped to number twenty-nine the following week, spending only five weeks on the chart. The song was first announced by Silverchair bass guitarist Chris Joannou in November 1999, when he told fans the band had &quot;a very small cache of recorded material stored away&quot;, including &quot;Without You&quot;. &quot;Without You&quot; was followed by &quot;Luv Your Life&quot;, which peaked at number twenty in Australia after its 20 September release. The inspiration for the song came to Johns during a therapy session, based on the idea that &quot;there were people in the world who needed treatment but couldn&#x27;t afford therapy.&quot; Johns composed most of the song&#x27;s lyrics while listening to a therapist. In a performance at London&#x27;s Shepherd&#x27;s Bush Empire, Johns jokingly said &quot;Luv Your Life&quot; was dedicated &quot;to all my ladies&quot;.

The final single &quot;Across the Night&quot; was released on 11 March 2003. The song, which Johns wrote over nine hours on a sleepless night, peaked at number twenty-four on its three weeks on the Australian chart. The arrangement by Parks features twin keyboards and a full orchestra. The band&#x27;s much-delayed tour in support of &quot;Diorama&quot; took its name from &quot;Across the Night&quot;.

===&quot;The Diorama Box&quot;===
On 1 December 2002, a limited-edition CD box set was released as &quot;The Diorama Box&quot;, consisting of the first three singles from the album as well as an exclusive single, &quot;After All These Years&quot;.

==Reception==
&quot;Diorama&quot; received a score of 71 out of 100 on review aggregator Metacritic, based on nine reviews. Australian radio station Triple J listeners voted the album number one on their Top 10 Albums of 2002, while Triple J staff Rosie Beaton and Gaby Brown placed it third and fifth respectively.

Music magazine &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; gave &quot;Diorama&quot; four and a half stars in Australia and three out of five stars in the US. Reviewer Mark Kemp praised Silverchair&#x27;s development, saying that the band had developed a strong, independent musical ability, in contrast to their heavily influenced debut album, &quot;Frogstomp&quot;. Kemp spoke highly of the &quot;heavy orchestration, unpredictable melodic shifts and a whimsical pop sensibility&quot;, also noting Parks&#x27; arrangements gave the music &quot;more breadth and depth&quot;. He argued that the album&#x27;s strength was a product of Johns&#x27; confidence, resulting in high quality on &quot;World Upon Your Shoulders&quot;, &quot;Tuna in the Brine&quot;, and &quot;After All These Years&quot;. However, &quot;Without You&quot; saw Silverchair slip into &quot;old habits&quot;, according to Kemp, and contained an &quot;MTV-approved hook&quot;.

Bradley Torreano, of review website AllMusic, gave &quot;Diorama&quot; four stars, labelling it an AMG Album Pick. He began by noting that Silverchair&#x27;s improvement from the &quot;Frogstomp&quot; era was impressive, and that &quot;Diorama&quot; saw the band &quot;finally growing into their own skin&quot;. Bottrill&#x27;s production was praised, and the result likened to Big Country and U2, while Johns showcased &quot;his rich voice and shockingly catchy tunes with a gusto missing from their earlier albums&quot;. Torreano&#x27;s criticism was reserved for two songs on the album; he described the apparent Goo Goo Dolls influences on &quot;Without You&quot; as &quot;an unwelcome twist&quot;, and felt that on &quot;One Way Mule&quot;, the band reverted &quot;back to their grunge sound&quot;.

James Jam, of music magazine &quot;NME&quot;, was critical of &quot;Diorama&quot;, calling it &quot;over-produced Aussie rock&quot;. Jam compared Silverchair to Bryan Adams in their attempt to &quot;venture boldly into exciting new musical landscapes&quot;. &quot;Tuna in the Brine&quot; was &quot;grossly pretentious and overblown&quot;, while he saw the album as a whole as inoffensive, especially in comparison to the band&#x27;s past post-grunge. According to Jam, the band were not trying to make a mature musical statement with the album but rather &quot;impress their parents&quot;.

Nikki Tranter of pop music website &quot;PopMatters&quot; called the album mature, praising everything from the cover art to the &quot;finely crafted pop melodies&quot;. Tranter praised &quot;Diorama&quot; for standing out in the &quot;very similar&quot; Australian music scene. The majority of songs on the album were rated highly; she thought &quot;The Greatest View&quot; was a stand-out with &quot;orchestral twangs&quot;, and &quot;After All These Years&quot; had &quot;sweeping horns, introspective lyrics and soft, haunting vocals&quot;.

Rob O&#x27;Connor of Yahoo!&#x27;s music website gave &quot;Diorama&quot; a positive review, agreeing that the band had matured greatly since their early high-school releases. The pop songs on the album, &quot;Luv Your Life&quot; and &quot;Too Much of Not Enough&quot;, were said to &quot;glide&quot;, and O&#x27;Connor praised Johns for &quot;whisper[ing] his lyrics with grace and subtlety&quot; where in the past he would &quot;shout in angst&quot;, drawing comparisons to Elliott Smith. His main critique of the album was that it still contained some &quot;obligatory &#x27;grunge&#x27; efforts&quot;; he felt eliminating those would allow the band to reach its full potential. In April 2007 the album was described on SBS-TV&#x27;s &quot;Great Australian Albums&quot;.

==Commercial performance==
&quot;Diorama&quot; charted highest in Australia; it spent 50 weeks on the ARIA Albums Chart, including a week at number one. This popularity was not matched in other countries; it spent ten weeks or less on all other charts, although it reached number seven in New Zealand.

<doc id="726651" wikidata="Q386053" url="?curid=726651" title="Donny Osmond">
<text>Donald Clark Osmond (born December 9, 1957) is an American singer, dancer, actor, television host and former teen idol. He first gained fame performing with four of his elder brothers as the Osmonds, earning several top ten hits and gold albums. In the early 1970s, Osmond began a solo career, earning several additional top ten songs.

He further gained fame due to the success of the 1976–1979 variety series &quot;Donny &amp; Marie&quot;, which Osmond hosted with his sister, Marie Osmond. The &quot;Donny &amp; Marie&quot; duo also released a series of top ten hits and gold albums and hosted a syndicated and Daytime Emmy Award–nominated 1998–2000 talk show. Donny &amp; Marie retired from headlining an 11-year Las Vegas residency at the Flamingo Las Vegas in 2019.

He also successfully competed on two reality TV shows, winning season 9 of &quot;Dancing with the Stars&quot; and being named runner-up for season 1 of &quot;The Masked Singer&quot;. He also hosted the game show &quot;Pyramid&quot; from 2002 to 2004.

==Early life==
Osmond was born on December 9, 1957, in Ogden, Utah, as the seventh child of Olive May (née Davis; 1925–2004) and George Virl Osmond (1917–2007). He is the brother of Virl, Tom, Alan, Wayne, Merrill, Jay, Marie, and Jimmy Osmond. Alan, Wayne, Merrill, Jay and Donny were members of the popular singing group Osmond Brothers. Osmond was raised as a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church) in Utah along with his siblings. In his youth, Osmond held a ham radio license, listed as KA7EVD.

==Music career==
===Teen idol: 1971–1978===

Jay Emerson Williams, the father of Andy Williams, saw the Osmond Brothers (Alan, Wayne, Merrill and Jay) perform on a Disneyland televised special (Disneyland After Dark) as a barbershop quartet. The group was then invited to audition for &quot;The Andy Williams Show&quot;. Williams initially had reservations about featuring children on the program but was encouraged by his father to try them out. The Osmond Brothers proved themselves as an asset to the program, soon becoming regulars on the show and quickly gaining popularity. In 1963, Donny Osmond made his debut on the show at the age of five singing &quot;You Are My Sunshine&quot;. The brothers continued to perform on the show throughout the 1960s, along with an occasional visit from their sister Marie.

Osmond became a teen idol in the early 1970s as a solo singer, while continuing to sing with his older brothers. Osmond was one of the biggest &quot;cover boy&quot; pop stars for &quot;Tiger Beat&quot;, Flip and &quot;16&quot; magazines in the early 1970s. His first solo hit was a cover of Roy Orbison&#x27;s 1958 recording of &quot;Sweet and Innocent&quot;, which peaked at no. 7 in the U.S. in 1971. Osmond&#x27;s follow-ups Steve Lawrence&#x27;s &quot;Go Away Little Girl&quot; (1971) (U.S. no. 1), Paul Anka&#x27;s &quot;Puppy Love&quot; (U.S. no. 3), and &quot;Hey Girl/I Knew You When&quot; (U.S. no. 9) (1972) vaulted him into international fame, further advanced by his November 20, 1972, appearance on the &quot;Here&#x27;s Lucy&quot; show, where he sang Nat King Cole&#x27;s &quot;Too Young&quot; to Lucy&#x27;s niece, played by Eve Plumb, and sang with Lucie Arnaz (&quot;I&#x27;ll Never Fall in Love Again&quot;).
===Comeback: 1989–1990===
In the 1980s, all of the Osmonds abandoned their earlier image—which had originally been crafted to appeal to young viewers—hoping to reach a more adult audience. While his brothers moved toward country music to modest success, Donny was able to revive his career in popular music. He made an unlikely appearance as one of several celebrities and unknowns auditioning to sing for guitarist Jeff Beck in the video for Beck&#x27;s 1985 single &quot;Ambitious&quot;, which was produced by Paul Flattery and directed by Jim Yukich. This was followed in 1986 by an equally unlikely cameo in the animated Luis Cardenas music video &quot;Runaway&quot;. He spent several years as a performer, before hiring the services of music and entertainment guru Steven Machat, who got Osmond together with English singer-songwriter Peter Gabriel to see whether Machat and Gabriel could turn Osmond&#x27;s image into a contemporary young pop act. They succeeded, returning Osmond to the US charts in 1989 with the Billboard Hot 100 no. 2 song &quot;Soldier of Love&quot; (originally announced on radio stations as &quot;from a mystery singer&quot;) and its top twenty follow-up &quot;Sacred Emotion&quot;. Launching an extensive tour in support of the Eyes Don&#x27;t Lie record, he enlisted guitarist Dick Smith of Earth Wind &amp; Fire and Kenny Loggins, along with keyboardist Mark Jackson.

===Current music career: 1991–present===
Osmond was the guest vocalist on Dweezil Zappa&#x27;s star-studded version of the Bee Gees&#x27; &quot;Stayin&#x27; Alive&quot; which appeared on Zappa&#x27;s 1991 album &quot;Confessions&quot;. The song also included guitar solos from Zakk Wylde, Steve Lukather, Warren DeMartini, Nuno Bettencourt, and Tim Pierce. Osmond sang &quot;No One Has to Be Alone&quot;, which was heard at the end of the film &quot;The Land Before Time IX: Journey to Big Water&quot;. He also sang &quot;I&#x27;ll Make a Man Out of You&quot; for Disney&#x27;s &quot;Mulan&quot;.

In the 2000s, he released a Christmas album, an album of his favorite Broadway songs, and a compilation of popular love songs. In 2004, he returned to the UK Top 10 for the first time as a solo artist since 1973, with the George Benson-sampling &quot;Breeze On By&quot;. The song was co-written with former teen idol Gary Barlow, from the 1990s UK boy band Take That, and reached number 8 on the UK charts.

His 17th solo album (and 61st album including those with his siblings), &quot;The Soundtrack of My Life&quot;, features a collection of cover songs with personal meaning to Osmond. He enlisted Stevie Wonder to play harmonica on the track &quot;My Cherie Amour&quot;.

Following Marie&#x27;s stint on &quot;Dancing with the Stars&quot; in 2007, the pair teamed up for a limited six-week engagement in Las Vegas. The residency began in September 2008, but proved so successful that it was ultimately extended for an eleven-year run through November 2019. Donny and Marie performed at the 750-seat showroom at the Flamingo Hotel. &quot;Donny &amp; Marie&quot; was a 90-minute show. The singing siblings were backed by eight dancers and a nine-piece band. Donny and Marie sang together at the beginning and end of the show, and had solo segments in between. The Flamingo Hotel&#x27;s showroom was updated in 2014 and renamed the Donny and Marie Theater.

Osmond and the show earned three of the &quot;Las Vegas Review-Journal&quot;″s Best of Las Vegas Awards in 2012 including &quot;Best Show&quot;, &quot;Best All-Around Performer&quot; (Donny &amp; Marie), and &quot;Best Singer&quot;. Osmond earned &quot;Best Singer&quot; for a second time in the &quot;Las Vegas Review-Journal&quot;″s Best of Las Vegas Awards in 2013.

==Film, radio and television==
===&quot;Donny &amp; Marie&quot;===
In 1974, Osmond and his sister, Marie, co-hosted &quot;The Mike Douglas Show&quot; for a week. Fred Silverman offered them a show of their own, &quot;The Donny &amp; Marie Show&quot;, a television variety series which aired on ABC from 1976 to 1979. In honor of their impact on American pop culture, Donny and Marie received the Pop Culture Award at the 2015 TV Land Awards. In the past, Osmond has expressed regret that the show was canceled, and that he and Marie were unable to decide when to end the show.

Donny and Marie also co-hosted the eponymous and syndicated talk show &quot;Donny &amp; Marie&quot; from 1998 to 2000. They would occasionally perform with musical guests. Though they received back-to-back nominations for the Daytime Emmy Award for Outstanding Talk Show Host in 2000 and 2001, the show was canceled.

===Other hosting opportunities===
For two seasons in the US, Osmond hosted &quot;Pyramid&quot; (2002–2004), a syndicated version of the Dick Clark-hosted television game show. He reprised hosting for a British version of &quot;Pyramid&quot; on Challenge in 2007. For his performance on &quot;Pyramid&quot;, Osmond was nominated for a Daytime Emmy Award for Outstanding Game Show Host in 2003; the award went to Alex Trebek.

Osmond is one of two game show hosts to host two different versions of the same game show in different countries; the other being Howie Mandel for the American and Canadian versions of &quot;Deal or No Deal&quot;.

Osmond returned to ABC as host of &quot;The Great American Dream Vote&quot;, a primetime reality-game show that debuted in March 2007. After earning lackluster ratings in its first two episodes, the program was canceled.

Osmond hosted the daytime British version of the game show &quot;Identity&quot; on BBC Two in 2007.

On April 11, 2008, he hosted the 2008 Miss USA Pageant in Las Vegas with his sister, Marie.

He appeared on &quot;Entertainment Tonight&quot; as a commentator covering the ABC show &quot;Dancing with the Stars&quot; during his sister Marie&#x27;s run as a contestant on the 5th season of the American version of the show in 2007.

===Music===
Osmond is mentioned in the lyrics of Alice Cooper&#x27;s song &quot;Department of Youth&quot; on the album &quot;Welcome to My Nightmare&quot;. As the song fades, Cooper can be heard asking the youth choir backing him up, &quot;Who&#x27;s got the power?&quot; to which a crowd of young people screams &quot;We do!&quot; After a couple of repetitions, this changes to &quot;We&#x27;ve got the power&quot; with a cheering response. On the final repetition, Cooper changes the question to &quot;...and who gave it to you?&quot; The crowd answers, &quot;Donny Osmond!&quot; Cooper then responds &quot;What?!&quot;

Osmond is featured in the song &quot;Start the Par-dee&quot; with Lil Yachty, written as a promotion for Chef Boyardee&#x27;s throwback recipe ravioli. His most iconic line is &quot;My name is Donny O, and you know I love my ravio&#x27;s&quot;.

===Film and television===
In the animated television series &quot;Johnny Bravo&quot;, Osmond voiced himself as a recurring character. 

He has done guest spots on numerous television shows such as &quot;Friends&quot;, &quot;&quot;, and &quot;Hannah Montana&quot;. 

He appeared in a Pepsi Twist commercial during the Super Bowl with his sister, Marie, and Ozzy and Sharon Osbourne. 

In 1978, he appeared in &quot;Goin&#x27; Coconuts&quot; with sister Marie. His future wife Debbie (credited as Debbie Glenn) made a cameo appearance at the end of the film.

In 1982, he co-starred with Priscilla Barnes and Joan Collins in the television movie &quot;The Wild Women of Chastity Gulch&quot; for Aaron Spelling.

In 1985, he appeared in a cameo role impersonating himself on Jeff Beck&#x27;s video for the track &quot;Ambitious&quot;, written by Nile Rodgers.

In 1998, Osmond was chosen as the singing voice of Shang in Disney&#x27;s &quot;Mulan&quot;. He sang &quot;I&#x27;ll Make a Man Out of You&quot;.

In 1999, he starred as Joseph in the movie version of &quot;Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat&quot; by Andrew Lloyd Webber&#x27;s request who said, &quot;to me, there is no better selection.&quot;

In 2002, he sang &quot;No One Has to Be Alone&quot; for the end credits of &quot;The Land Before Time IX: Journey to Big Water&quot;.

In the &quot;Bob the Builder&quot; special &quot;Built to be Wild&quot;, he played Jackaroo the pickup truck.

Osmond remarked in an interview that his movie appearance on &quot;College Road Trip&quot; and upcoming appearances on two Disney Channel shows would mean that he would be coming full circle since he and his family were discovered by Walt Disney.

Osmond appears in the music video of &quot;Weird Al&quot; Yankovic&#x27;s song &quot;White &amp; Nerdy&quot;. The song is a parody of Chamillionaire&#x27;s &quot;Ridin&#x27;&quot;; Osmond&#x27;s role is analogous to that of Krayzie Bone&#x27;s role in the original video. Yankovic asked Osmond to appear because &quot;if you have to have a white and nerdy icon in your video, like who else do you go for?&quot;

In February 2019, he was revealed to have portrayed &quot;Peacock&quot; on the first season of &quot; The Masked Singer,&quot; where he was the runner-up.

Osmond was a guest on Kevin Nealon&#x27;s web series on YouTube, &quot;Hiking with Kevin&quot;, in March 2019. The webisode begins with the two hiking through the snow at the Sundance Resort in Utah, and ends with them walking a crowded Las Vegas Strip until Osmond brings Nealon backstage at the Donny &amp; Marie Showroom in the Flamingo Hotel, at which he was to perform that evening.

In 2020, Osmond was invited as a celebrity panelist for Fox&#x27;s &quot;I Can See Your Voice&quot;, appearing on episode 5 in the first season of the show (4 November).

===&quot;Dancing with the Stars&quot;===
Osmond and professional Kym Johnson were paired for the ninth season of &quot;Dancing with the Stars&quot;. He participated in the show to prove he was a better dancer than his sister, Marie, who made it to the finals of season 5. For the first week, Donny and his partner were assigned to perform a foxtrot and a 30-second salsa. His foxtrot was said to be &quot;too theatrical&quot; and was scored 20/30 by the judges, however he managed to maintain a good score when his salsa scored 10 points. He performed a jive the following week, which was guest-judged by Baz Luhrmann. He scored 25 and was scored second place, called first to be safe. That following week he performed a rumba and scored 21.

The following week introduced four new dances including the Charleston, for which he scored 24. That following week, the two performed an Argentine tango. The couple scored 29/30, which was the highest-scored dance to date until it was beaten by then-top scorer and future runner-up Mýa and her 70s-themed samba. Donny also received that week&#x27;s encore.

Following that week, Osmond and Johnson danced a train-station-themed jitterbug and scored a 24. He then performed a mambo against all couples and was eliminated 6th, receiving seven points for a total of 31/40. The following week, he performed a quickstep, which he quotes &quot;was one of the worst moments of my life&quot; and scored 24 and a team tango along with Joanna Krupa and Kelly Osbourne and received 28/30 and the encore.

In the 8th week of competition, Osmond was required to dance a ballroom and decade-themed Latin dance. His ballroom Viennese waltz received 26 but his 1980s themed pasodoble received 24 being quoted by judge Len Goodman as &quot;the scariest, bizarre pasodoble we&#x27;ve ever seen&quot; being awarded the last place on the judges&#x27; leaderboard for the first time. Following that week, he danced a tango and got advice from past runner-up Gilles Marini. He got tangled in Johnson&#x27;s dress and received 21 saying the cause was that &quot;I saw Marie.&quot; He then danced the samba to a song originally recorded by his brothers and himself called &quot;One Bad Apple&quot;, receiving 26 and a Jitterbug scored 27. He once again was scored last place.

For the finals week, he danced a cha-cha-cha (27), a megamix dance alongside Mya and Kelly Osbourne (28), the only perfect-scoring freestyle (30) and a repeat of his Argentine tango (30) and won the competition, making him the oldest winner. As he accepted his trophy, he hugged fellow finalist Mya and brought his wife, Debbie, and sister, Marie, on stage.

On season 18, he guest-judged week five on Disney Night. In October 2014, he guest judged on the British version of the show, &quot;Strictly Come Dancing&quot;, on week 3 (movie week) of the 12th series.

==Musical theater==

His first foray into Broadway musical theater was the lead role in a revival of the 1904 George M. Cohan show &quot;Little Johnny Jones&quot;. Osmond replaced another former teen idol, David Cassidy, who left the show while it was on its pre-Broadway tour. After 29 previews and only one performance, the show closed in March 1982.

Osmond found success in musical theater through much of the 1990s when he starred as Joseph in &quot;Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat&quot; for over 2,000 performances beginning in July 1992 in the Elgin Theatre&#x27;s Toronto production. He relocated to Chicago where Joseph played for 16 months in 1993–94. Osmond suffered from social anxiety disorder during his performances for the musical, which caused him to feel light-headed and extremely nervous during his performances. In 1997, Osmond left his starring role in the tour to participate with his family in the cast of the Hill Cumorah Pageant. Creator Andrew Lloyd Webber later chose Osmond to star in the 1999 film version.

He returned to Broadway on 19 September 2006 as Gaston in Disney&#x27;s &quot;Beauty and the Beast&quot;. He was scheduled to perform for nine weeks, but due to popular demand, he extended his run through December. Liz Smith of the &quot;New York Post&quot; wrote, &quot;I am here to tell you he is charmingly campy, good-looking and grand as the villain &#x27;Gaston&#x27;, patterned after our old friend Elvis&quot;, and noting &quot;Donny is divine&quot;. On 29 July 2007, Osmond played Gaston again for the final performance of &quot;Beauty and the Beast&quot;.

Osmond and his sister, Marie, starred in a holiday production called &quot;Donny &amp; Marie – A Broadway Christmas&quot;, originally scheduled to play on Broadway at the Marquis Theatre 9–19 December 2010. The show was extended through December 2010 and again until 2 January 2011. &quot;Donny &amp; Marie – Christmas in Chicago&quot; played at the Ford Center for the Performing Arts Oriental Theatre in Chicago in December 2011. It was similar to the 2010 Broadway show. In December 2014, they again performed in a similar Broadway show, receiving very positive reviews.

Osmond is set to play the role of Pharaoh, in the upcoming production of &quot;Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat&quot; for a limited run over Christmas 2024 at the Edinburgh Playhouse opening on 3 December 2024 as part of the UK Tour going into 2025.

==Other ventures==
===Donny Osmond Home===
&quot;Donny Osmond Home&quot; is a furniture and decor accessories collection, established in 2013 by Osmond and his wife Debbie, in collaboration with decor manufacturers.

===Author===
&quot;Life is Just What You Make It: My Story So Far&quot;, his autobiography co-written with Patricia Romanowski, is a &quot;tell-all&quot;, Donny Osmond style. The book, released in 1999, includes stories from behind-the-scenes as a teen star, to his thought of tarnishing his &quot;goody-two-shoes&quot; image as he started his solo career, to him describing the intense panic attacks he suffered on stage.

==Public image==
Osmond states that he has had a tremendous public-image struggle since &quot;Donny &amp; Marie&quot; ended in 1979. Reviews from Allmusic noted that while Osmond remained a gifted singer, a series of creative missteps in the late 1970s led to his virtually disappearing from the public eye during the 1980s. He was described in the 1980s as having an &quot;unhip image&quot;, and he said he was embarrassed that the Osmond name was not considered cool. A publicist suggested that Osmond purposely plan an arrest for drug possession in order to change his image. &quot;I remember hiring a publicist who figured out this whole campaign to get me busted for drugs and change my image.&quot;

Osmond commented on his opposition to same-sex marriage after the 2008 Proposition 8 in California. The LDS Church were one of many groups that supported Proposition 8 (to ban same-sex marriage), and Osmond stated that he opposes same-sex marriage but that he does not condemn homosexuality. He believes that homosexuals should be accepted in the LDS Church if they remain celibate. He stated on his website:

In March 2010, Osmond criticized Lady Gaga and Beyoncé for using profanity and sex in their &quot;Telephone&quot; video.

==Personal life==
On May 8, 1978, Osmond married Debra Glenn of Billings, Montana, in the Salt Lake Temple. Together they have five sons: Don, Jeremy, Brandon, Chris, and Josh. The Osmonds became grandparents in 2005 and have 14 grandchildren. Chris, who is also a musician, appeared on season 2 of the American reality series &quot;Claim to Fame&quot;, in which contestants have to determine their competitors&#x27; famous relative; Chris advanced to the final episode, having repeatedly survived numerous eliminations because the other contestants could not guess Donny&#x27;s identity.

Like the rest of his family, Osmond is a member of the LDS Church. In retrospect, he has written, &quot;It would have been nice to be able to have served a regular full-time mission, but when I was of that age, my career was such that everyone, including my parents and the leaders of the church, thought that I could do a lot of good in the world by continuing to be in the public eye, by living an exemplary life and sharing my beliefs in every way that I could.&quot; He continues sharing his beliefs in an extensive letters-and-comments portion of his website.

Osmond&#x27;s two oldest brothers, Virl and Tom, are deaf, and his nephew, Justin, is hearing impaired. He has talked about the experience of growing up with his brothers and their use of sign language when performing together.

Osmond has traced some of his family ancestry back to Merthyr Tydfil in Wales; his journey was documented in a BBC Wales program, &quot;Donny Osmond Coming Home&quot;. On the BBC&#x27;s &quot;The One Show&quot;, a plaque was unveiled in the town to commemorate &quot;the ancestors of Donny Osmond.&quot;

<text>Marcel Gilles Jozef Minnaert (12 February 1893 – 26 October 1970) was a Belgian-Dutch astronomer. He was born in Bruges and died in Utrecht. He is notable for his contributions to astronomy and physics and for a popular book on meteorological optics: &quot;Light and colour in the open air&quot;, first published in English in 1940.

==Biography==
Minnaert obtained a PhD in biology at Ghent University in 1914. Later he obtained also a PhD in physics from Utrecht University, under the supervision of Leonard Ornstein.

He was a supporter of the Flemish movement during World War I and endorsed the replacement of French by Dutch during the German occupation of Belgium. He worked as &quot;lector fysica&quot; at the new Flemish University of Ghent, which was made possible by the support of the German occupation forces, and was viewed as connivance with the enemy by the reestablished Belgian authorities. Because of this, he was sentenced after the war in absence to 15 years of forced labor. However, Minnaert had anticipated this outcome by fleeing Belgium in time.

In 1918, he found a position at Utrecht University in the Netherlands, initially to do photometric research. In Utrecht, he became interested in astronomy, and he became a pioneer of solar research. He specialized in spectroscopy and the study of stellar atmospheres and invented the spectroscopic curve of growth.

Minnaert was also interested in bubbles and musical nature of the sounds made by running water. In 1933 he published a solution for the acoustic resonance frequency of a single bubble in water, the so-called Minnaert resonance.

In 1937, he was appointed director of the stellar observatory &quot;Sonnenborgh&quot; in Utrecht and full professor in astronomy at the university. In 1940, he published his famous Utrecht Atlas of the solar spectrum. In 1941, he invented the Minnaert function, which is used in optical measurements of celestial bodies.

During the German occupation of the Netherlands in World War II, he was imprisoned in Kamp Sint-Michielsgestel by the Germans because of his left-wing, anti-fascist sympathies. During his incarceration, he taught physics and astronomy to his fellow prisoners. After the War, he was one of the founders of the Mathematisch Centrum in Amsterdam.

Minnaert was elected to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1959. In 1946 he became member of the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences. He became a member of the United States National Academy of Sciences in 1964 and the American Philosophical Society in 1969.

*&quot;Practical Work in Elementary Astronomy&quot;, D. Reidel, 1969, ; 2012 pbk reprint 

One of his interests was the effects of the atmosphere on light and images. His classic book on this subject, the first part of a trilogy, was originally published in Dutch in 1937 as:
*&quot;De natuurkunde van &#x27;t vrije veld. Licht en kleur in het landschap&quot;. It was released in English translation as:
*&quot;Light and colour in the open air&quot; (H. M. Kremer-Priest, Trans.). London: G. Bell and Sons. An edition of this book was reprinted in 1954, as a Dover reprint:
*&quot;The Nature of Light and Color in the Open Air&quot;, Dover, 1954, and in a new translation with color photographs as:
*&quot;Light and Color in the Outdoors&quot;, Springer, 1993, , , .

==Honors==
Awards
*Gold Medal of the Royal Astronomical Society (1947)
*Bruce Medal (1951)

<text>Albrecht Otto Johannes Unsöld (20 April 1905 – 23 September 1995) was a German astrophysicist known for his contributions to spectroscopic analysis of stellar atmospheres.

==Career==

Albrecht Unsöld was born in Bolheim, Württemberg, Germany. After school attendance in Heidenheim, Unsöld studied physics at the University of Tübingen and the University of Munich. At Munich, he studied under Arnold Sommerfeld, and was granted his doctorate in 1927. As a Fellow of the Rockefeller Foundation, he was an assistant in Potsdam and worked at the Mount Wilson Observatory in Pasadena, California. He then completed his Habilitation in Munich in 1929. In 1930, he was an assistant at the Institute of Theoretical Physics at the University of Hamburg. In September 1932, Unsöld became Ordinarius Professor and Director of the Institute for Theoretical Physics (and Observatory) at the University of Kiel – a position he held until his emeritus status was granted in 1973, after which he remained scientifically active for 15 years.

While a student at Munich, Unsöld was one of many of a long line of students who helped Sommerfeld explore and advance atomic theory. Unsöld&#x27;s theorem states that the square of the total electron wavefunction for a filled or half-filled sub-shell is spherically symmetric. Thus, like atoms containing a half-filled or filled s orbital (&quot;l&quot; = 0), atoms of the second period with 3 or 6 p (&quot;l&quot; = 1) electrons are spherically shaped. Likewise, so are atoms of the third period in which there are 5 or 10 d (&quot;l&quot; = 2) electrons. Hence, spherical atoms are those of the 1st, 2nd, 7th, 12th, 15th and 18th columns of the periodic table.

At Kiel, Unsöld made an intensive study of the effects of abundances, radiation damping, Doppler shifts, electric fields, and collisions on the formation and shape of spectral lines in stellar atmospheres. His analysis of the B0 star Tau Scorpii, obtained on his 1939 visit to Yerkes and McDonald Observatories, provided the first detailed analysis of a star other than the Sun, and he was able to determine the physics and composition of the star&#x27;s atmosphere.

From 1947 to 1948, Unsöld was President of the Astronomische Gesellschaft.

Unsöld edited the &quot;Zeitschrift für Astrophysik&quot; until it was merged with other European journals into &quot;Astronomy and Astrophysics&quot;. He was also the author of many books, and his book &quot;Physik der Sternatmosphären mit besonderer Berücksichtigung der Sonne&quot; was a bible for quantitative stellar spectroscopy and related fields, with special emphasis on the Sun.

<text>The Bite of Seattle is an annual food festival held in Seattle, Washington. It takes place at the Seattle Center. Locally, the festival is known as &quot;The Bite&quot;. It is held on one weekend during the month of July, and is considered to be one of Seattle&#x27;s largest food and beverage events with over 200 participating vendors. 

== History ==
Back in July 1982, Alan Silverman, the president of Festivals, Inc., founded the festival which was originally held at Green Lake Park. Initially, it was expected that roughly 25,000 people would attend, but there were 25 restaurants participating and 75,000 people in attendance. In 2006 there were 60 restaurants and food vendors participating and over 425,000 visitors.

Throughout the rest of the years, the number of visitors averaged out to about 400,000 people over the course of the three day long festival with over 60 restaurants participating. 

The 2020 Bite of Seattle and Taste of Tacoma were both cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic. In 2023, CHEQ a mobile payments platform company brought the Bite of Seattle back after two years of hiatus. The 2023 event was panned by attendees due to poor functionality of the CHEQ app.

==Attractions==
The Bite offers many attractions, including food sampling from local restaurants, food cook-off competitions, eating competitions, new foods and vendors, commercial vendors, traveling tours, child-friendly activities and local chefs showcasing their cooking. There are also many activities and entertainment options unrelated to food, which include live entertainment, stage performances, a free movie night, craft beer &amp; cider tasting, and beer gardens.
Bite of Seattle hosts over 80 live bands that play on stage, primarily local and regional artists. These performances are usually held at one of the three main stages: either the Fountain Lawn Stage, the Mural Stage, or the Fisher Green Stage.

<doc id="726659" wikidata="Q1566000" url="?curid=726659" title="Superintelligence">
<text>A [[superintelligence]] is a hypothetical agent that possesses intelligence surpassing that of the brightest and most gifted human minds. &quot;Superintelligence&quot; may also refer to a property of problem-solving systems (e.g., superintelligent language translators or engineering assistants) whether or not these high-level intellectual competencies are embodied in agents that act in the world. A superintelligence may or may not be created by an intelligence explosion and associated with a technological singularity.

University of Oxford philosopher Nick Bostrom defines &quot;superintelligence&quot; as &quot;any intellect that greatly exceeds the cognitive performance of humans in virtually all domains of interest&quot;. The program Fritz falls short of this conception of superintelligence—even though it is much better than humans at chess—because Fritz cannot outperform humans in other tasks.

Technological researchers disagree about how likely present-day human intelligence is to be surpassed. Some argue that advances in artificial intelligence (AI) will probably result in general reasoning systems that lack human cognitive limitations. Others believe that humans will evolve or directly modify their biology to achieve radically greater intelligence. Several future study scenarios combine elements from both of these possibilities, suggesting that humans are likely to interface with computers, or upload their minds to computers, in a way that enables substantial intelligence amplification.

Some researchers believe that superintelligence will likely follow shortly after the development of artificial general intelligence. The first generally intelligent machines are likely to immediately hold an enormous advantage in at least some forms of mental capability, including the capacity of perfect recall, a vastly superior knowledge base, and the ability to multitask in ways not possible to biological entities. This may allow them to — either as a single being or as a new species — become much more powerful than humans, and displace them.

Several scientists and forecasters have been arguing for prioritizing early research into the possible benefits and risks of human and machine cognitive enhancement, because of the potential social impact of such technologies.

== Feasibility of artificial superintelligence ==
The creation of artificial superintelligence (ASI) has been a topic of increasing discussion in recent years, particularly with the rapid advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) technologies.

=== Progress in AI and claims of AGI ===

Recent developments in AI, particularly in large language models (LLMs) based on the transformer architecture, have led to significant improvements in various tasks. Models like GPT-3, GPT-4, Claude 3.5 and others have demonstrated capabilities that some researchers argue approach or even exhibit aspects of artificial general intelligence (AGI).

However, the claim that current LLMs constitute AGI is controversial. Critics argue that these models, while impressive, still lack true understanding and are primarily sophisticated pattern matching systems.

=== Pathways to superintelligence ===

Philosopher David Chalmers argues that AGI is a likely path to ASI. He posits that AI can achieve equivalence to human intelligence, be extended to surpass it, and then be amplified to dominate humans across arbitrary tasks.

More recent research has explored various potential pathways to superintelligence:

# Scaling current AI systems – Some researchers argue that continued scaling of existing AI architectures, particularly transformer-based models, could lead to AGI and potentially ASI.
# Novel architectures – Others suggest that new AI architectures, potentially inspired by neuroscience, may be necessary to achieve AGI and ASI.
# Hybrid systems – Combining different AI approaches, including symbolic AI and neural networks, could potentially lead to more robust and capable systems.

=== Computational advantages ===

Artificial systems have several potential advantages over biological intelligence:

# Speed – Computer components operate much faster than biological neurons. Modern microprocessors (~2 GHz) are seven orders of magnitude faster than neurons (~200 Hz).
# Scalability – AI systems can potentially be scaled up in size and computational capacity more easily than biological brains.
# Modularity – Different components of AI systems can be improved or replaced independently.
# Memory – AI systems can have perfect recall and vast knowledge bases. It is also much less constrained than humans when it comes to working memory.
# Multitasking – AI can perform multiple tasks simultaneously in ways not possible for biological entities.

=== Potential path through transformer models ===

Recent advancements in transformer-based models have led some researchers to speculate that the path to ASI might lie in scaling up and improving these architectures. This view suggests that continued improvements in transformer models or similar architectures could lead directly to ASI.

Some experts even argue that current large language models like GPT-4 may already exhibit early signs of AGI or ASI capabilities. This perspective suggests that the transition from current AI to ASI might be more continuous and rapid than previously thought, blurring the lines between narrow AI, AGI, and ASI.

However, this view remains controversial. Critics argue that current models, while impressive, still lack crucial aspects of general intelligence such as true understanding, reasoning, and adaptability across diverse domains.

The debate over whether the path to ASI will involve a distinct AGI phase or a more direct scaling of current technologies remains ongoing, with significant implications for AI development strategies and safety considerations.

=== Challenges and uncertainties ===

Despite these potential advantages, there are significant challenges and uncertainties in achieving ASI:

# Ethical and safety concerns – The development of ASI raises numerous ethical questions and potential risks that need to be addressed.
# Computational requirements – The computational resources required for ASI might be far beyond current capabilities.
# Fundamental limitations – There may be fundamental limitations to intelligence that apply to both artificial and biological systems.
# Unpredictability – The path to ASI and its consequences are highly uncertain and difficult to predict.

As research in AI continues to advance rapidly, the question of the feasibility of ASI remains a topic of intense debate and study in the scientific community.

==Feasibility of biological superintelligence==
Carl Sagan suggested that the advent of Caesarean sections and &quot;in vitro&quot; fertilization may permit humans to evolve larger heads, resulting in improvements via natural selection in the heritable component of human intelligence. By contrast, Gerald Crabtree has argued that decreased selection pressure is resulting in a slow, centuries-long reduction in human intelligence and that this process instead is likely to continue. There is no scientific consensus concerning either possibility and in both cases, the biological change would be slow, especially relative to rates of cultural change.

Selective breeding, nootropics, epigenetic modulation, and genetic engineering could improve human intelligence more rapidly. Bostrom writes that if we come to understand the genetic component of intelligence, pre-implantation genetic diagnosis could be used to select for embryos with as much as 4 points of IQ gain (if one embryo is selected out of two), or with larger gains (e.g., up to 24.3 IQ points gained if one embryo is selected out of 1000). If this process is iterated over many generations, the gains could be an order of magnitude improvement. Bostrom suggests that deriving new gametes from embryonic stem cells could be used to iterate the selection process rapidly. A well-organized society of high-intelligence humans of this sort could potentially achieve collective superintelligence.

Alternatively, collective intelligence might be constructional by better organizing humans at present levels of individual intelligence. Several writers have suggested that human civilization, or some aspect of it (e.g., the Internet, or the economy), is coming to function like a global brain with capacities far exceeding its component agents. If this systemic superintelligence relies heavily on artificial components, however, it may qualify as an AI rather than as a biology-based superorganism. A prediction market is sometimes considered as an example of a working collective intelligence system, consisting of humans only (assuming algorithms are not used to inform decisions).

A final method of intelligence amplification would be to directly enhance individual humans, as opposed to enhancing their social or reproductive dynamics. This could be achieved using nootropics, somatic gene therapy, or brain−computer interfaces. However, Bostrom expresses skepticism about the scalability of the first two approaches and argues that designing a superintelligent cyborg interface is an AI-complete problem.

== Forecasts ==
Most surveyed AI researchers expect machines to eventually be able to rival humans in intelligence, though there is little consensus on when this will likely happen. At the 2006 AI@50 conference, 18% of attendees reported expecting machines to be able &quot;to simulate learning and every other aspect of human intelligence&quot; by 2056; 41% of attendees expected this to happen sometime after 2056; and 41% expected machines to never reach that milestone.

In a survey of the 100 most cited authors in AI (as of May 2013, according to Microsoft academic search), the median year by which respondents expected machines &quot;that can carry out most human professions at least as well as a typical human&quot; (assuming no global catastrophe occurs) with 10% confidence is 2024 (mean 2034, st. dev. 33 years), with 50% confidence is 2050 (mean 2072, st. dev. 110 years), and with 90% confidence is 2070 (mean 2168, st. dev. 342 years). These estimates exclude the 1.2% of respondents who said no year would ever reach 10% confidence, the 4.1% who said &#x27;never&#x27; for 50% confidence, and the 16.5% who said &#x27;never&#x27; for 90% confidence. Respondents assigned a median 50% probability to the possibility that machine superintelligence will be invented within 30 years of the invention of approximately human-level machine intelligence.

In a 2022 survey, the median year by which respondents expected &quot;High-level machine intelligence&quot; with 50% confidence is 2061. The survey defined the achievement of high-level machine intelligence as when unaided machines can accomplish every task better and more cheaply than human workers.

In 2023, OpenAI leaders Sam Altman, Greg Brockman and Ilya Sutskever published recommendations for the governance of superintelligence, which they believe may happen in less than 10 years. In 2024, Ilya Sutskever left OpenAI to cofound the startup &quot;Safe Superintelligence&quot;, which focuses solely on creating a superintelligence that is safe by design, while avoiding &quot;distraction by management overhead or product cycles&quot;.

== Design considerations ==

The design of superintelligent AI systems raises critical questions about what values and goals these systems should have. Several proposals have been put forward:

=== Value alignment proposals ===

* Coherent extrapolated volition (CEV) – The AI should have the values upon which humans would converge if they were more knowledgeable and rational.
* Moral rightness (MR) – The AI should be programmed to do what is morally right, relying on its superior cognitive abilities to determine ethical actions.
* Moral permissibility (MP) – The AI should stay within the bounds of moral permissibility while otherwise pursuing goals aligned with human values (similar to CEV).

Bostrom elaborates on these concepts:

instead of implementing humanity&#x27;s coherent extrapolated volition, one could try to build an AI to do what is morally right, relying on the AI&#x27;s superior cognitive capacities to figure out just which actions fit that description. We can call this proposal &quot;moral rightness&quot; (MR)... 

MR would also appear to have some disadvantages. It relies on the notion of &quot;morally right&quot;, a notoriously difficult concept, one with which philosophers have grappled since antiquity without yet attaining consensus as to its analysis. Picking an erroneous explication of &quot;moral rightness&quot; could result in outcomes that would be morally very wrong...

One might try to preserve the basic idea of the MR model while reducing its demandingness by focusing on &quot;moral permissibility&quot;: the idea being that we could let the AI pursue humanity&#x27;s CEV so long as it did not act in morally impermissible ways.

=== Recent developments ===

Since Bostrom&#x27;s analysis, new approaches to AI value alignment have emerged:

* Inverse Reinforcement Learning (IRL) – This technique aims to infer human preferences from observed behavior, potentially offering a more robust approach to value alignment.
* Constitutional AI – Proposed by Anthropic, this involves training AI systems with explicit ethical principles and constraints.
* Debate and amplification – These techniques, explored by OpenAI, use AI-assisted debate and iterative processes to better understand and align with human values.

=== Transformer LLMs and ASI ===

The rapid advancement of transformer-based LLMs has led to speculation about their potential path to ASI. Some researchers argue that scaled-up versions of these models could exhibit ASI-like capabilities:

* Emergent abilities – As LLMs increase in size and complexity, they demonstrate unexpected capabilities not present in smaller models.
* In-context learning – LLMs show the ability to adapt to new tasks without fine-tuning, potentially mimicking general intelligence.
* Multi-modal integration – Recent models can process and generate various types of data, including text, images, and audio.

However, critics argue that current LLMs lack true understanding and are merely sophisticated pattern matchers, raising questions about their suitability as a path to ASI.

=== Other perspectives on artificial superintelligence ===

Additional viewpoints on the development and implications of superintelligence include:

* Recursive self-improvement – I. J. Good proposed the concept of an &quot;intelligence explosion&quot;, where an AI system could rapidly improve its own intelligence, potentially leading to superintelligence.
* Orthogonality thesis – Bostrom argues that an AI&#x27;s level of intelligence is orthogonal to its final goals, meaning a superintelligent AI could have any set of motivations.
* Instrumental convergence – Certain instrumental goals (e.g., self-preservation, resource acquisition) might be pursued by a wide range of AI systems, regardless of their final goals.

=== Challenges and ongoing research ===

The pursuit of value-aligned AI faces several challenges:

* Philosophical uncertainty in defining concepts like &quot;moral rightness&quot;
* Technical complexity in translating ethical principles into precise algorithms
* Potential for unintended consequences even with well-intentioned approaches

Current research directions include multi-stakeholder approaches to incorporate diverse perspectives, developing methods for scalable oversight of AI systems, and improving techniques for robust value learning.

Al research is rapidly progressing towards superintelligence. Addressing these design challenges remains crucial for creating ASI systems that are both powerful and aligned with human interests.

== Potential threat to humanity ==
The development of artificial superintelligence (ASI) has raised concerns about potential existential risks to humanity. Researchers have proposed various scenarios in which an ASI could pose a significant threat:

=== Intelligence explosion and control problem ===

Some researchers argue that through recursive self-improvement, an ASI could rapidly become so powerful as to be beyond human control. This concept, known as an &quot;intelligence explosion&quot;, was first proposed by I. J. Good in 1965:

This scenario presents the AI control problem: how to create an ASI that will benefit humanity while avoiding unintended harmful consequences. Eliezer Yudkowsky argues that solving this problem is crucial before ASI is developed, as a superintelligent system might be able to thwart any subsequent attempts at control.

=== Unintended consequences and goal misalignment ===

Even with benign intentions, an ASI could potentially cause harm due to misaligned goals or unexpected interpretations of its objectives. Nick Bostrom provides a stark example of this risk:

Stuart Russell offers another illustrative scenario:

These examples highlight the potential for catastrophic outcomes even when an ASI is not explicitly designed to be harmful, underscoring the critical importance of precise goal specification and alignment.

=== Potential mitigation strategies ===

Researchers have proposed various approaches to mitigate risks associated with ASI:

* Capability control – Limiting an ASI&#x27;s ability to influence the world, such as through physical isolation or restricted access to resources.
* Motivational control – Designing ASIs with goals that are fundamentally aligned with human values.
* Ethical AI – Incorporating ethical principles and decision-making frameworks into ASI systems.
* Oversight and governance – Developing robust international frameworks for the development and deployment of ASI technologies.

Despite these proposed strategies, some experts, such as Roman Yampolskiy, argue that the challenge of controlling a superintelligent AI might be fundamentally unsolvable, emphasizing the need for extreme caution in ASI development.

=== Debate and skepticism ===

Not all researchers agree on the likelihood or severity of ASI-related existential risks. Some, like Rodney Brooks, argue that fears of superintelligent AI are overblown and based on unrealistic assumptions about the nature of intelligence and technological progress. Others, such as Joanna Bryson, contend that anthropomorphizing AI systems leads to misplaced concerns about their potential threats.

=== Recent developments and current perspectives ===

The rapid advancement of LLMs and other AI technologies has intensified debates about the proximity and potential risks of ASI. While there is no scientific consensus, some researchers and AI practitioners argue that current AI systems may already be approaching AGI or even ASI capabilities.

* LLM capabilities – Recent LLMs like GPT-4 have demonstrated unexpected abilities in areas such as reasoning, problem-solving, and multi-modal understanding, leading some to speculate about their potential path to ASI.

* Emergent behaviors – Studies have shown that as AI models increase in size and complexity, they can exhibit emergent capabilities not present in smaller models, potentially indicating a trend towards more general intelligence.

* Rapid progress – The pace of AI advancement has led some to argue that we may be closer to ASI than previously thought, with potential implications for existential risk.

A minority of researchers and observers, including some in the AI development community, believe that current AI systems may already be at or near AGI levels, with ASI potentially following in the near future. This view, while not widely accepted in the scientific community, is based on observations of rapid progress in AI capabilities and unexpected emergent behaviors in large models.

However, many experts caution against premature claims of AGI or ASI, arguing that current AI systems, despite their impressive capabilities, still lack true understanding and general intelligence. They emphasize the significant challenges that remain in achieving human-level intelligence, let alone superintelligence.

The debate surrounding the current state and trajectory of AI development underscores the importance of continued research into AI safety and ethics, as well as the need for robust governance frameworks to manage potential risks as AI capabilities continue to advance.

<doc id="726663" wikidata="Q1434530" url="?curid=726663" title="Flybanger">
<text>Flybanger was a Canadian metal band from Vancouver. They are best known for their 2001 major label release &quot;Headtrip to Nowhere&quot;.

== History ==
The band started out performing under the name Jar. They released two CDs under that name, including &quot;Knott Skull&quot; in 1998. The
song &quot;Regional Pump&quot; from their 1996 debut &quot;Harsh and Discord&quot; appeared in the credits for the Canadian science fiction film &quot;Laserhawk&quot;, released in 1997.

Because there was more than one other band with the same name, the band members decided to rename their group Flybanger. They released a five track EP titled &quot;Outlived&quot; in 2000.

In 2001 the band released an album, &quot;Headtrip to Nowhere&quot;, as Flybanger through Sony Music in 2001, which was produced by Matt Wallace (Faith No More, The Replacements, Deftones, Maroon 5, etc.). Playing on the album were singer Garth Allen, guitarist Bryan Fratesi, Tom Macdonald on bass and Rob Wade on drums. The singles released from &quot;Headtrip To Nowhere&quot; were &quot;Cavalry&quot;, &quot;Radical&quot; and &quot;Blind World&quot;. The latter was also used on the soundtrack for the motion picture &quot;Dracula 2000&quot;.

The band toured in support of the album.

In 2003 the band broke up. Original Lyricist and lead singer Mark Simson was released as part of the break up. In 2005, Rob Wade (drums) and Garth Allen (vocals) joined Kill Rhythm, a band started by Rob Thiessen (formerly of Noise Therapy). In March 2009, following the breakup of Kill Rhythm, both Wade and Allen turned their focus to the heavy acoustic rock project, The Thick of It.

In 2013, the band released an album under their original name of Jar. containing re-recordings of several of their older songs.

<doc id="726664" wikidata="Q4810294" url="?curid=726664" title="Assonet River">
<text>The Assonet River is located in Bristol County, Massachusetts. It flows in a westerly direction through Freetown and joins the Taunton River near Assonet Neck in Berkley, Massachusetts.

==Description==
The Assonet River is formed from the Cedar Swamp River near the border of Freetown and Lakeville just south of Myricks village. It is joined by Quaker Brook at Forge Pond. From this point it flows parallel to Route 79 through a series of small mill ponds. It becomes tidal near the Elm Street Bridge in Assonet village where it widens and becomes Assonet Bay to the west of Route 24.

Assonet Bay contains several small coves fed by small streams including Payne&#x27;s Cove (fed by Terry Brook from the south) and Shepherd&#x27;s Cove located at its southwest end. The bay is also fed by Stacy&#x27;s Creek from the north. Assonet Bay is surrounded by several small hills (drumlins). Past Shepherd&#x27;s Cove the Assonet River narrows again for its last mile or so before joining the wide Taunton River between Conspiracy Island and Winslow Point. This portion of the river forms the town line between Berkley and Freetown.

At its mouth, the Assonet River also forms Hathaway Cove in Assonet.

==History==
The Assonet River is a major river of southeastern Massachusetts, along with the Taunton River. Throughout the history of colonial and early America, the river and its tributaries provided the power to run grist mills and saw mills, and later the Crystal Springs Bleachery. It provided for a minor port, and is also a prime location for herring runs.

During the 18th century, the river played a part in the American Revolutionary War. British ships travelled both it and the Taunton River when fighting in the colonies. Such attacks led to the Battle of Freetown, as well as the burning of river-centered rural settlement.

During the 19th century, fishing and cargo ships regularly used the Assonet River to reach their home port of Assonet, Massachusetts. From these ports on Water Street and South Main Street were delivered products such as food, dairy, lobster, fish, lumber, and for a span of time guns. The N. R. Davis Gun Factory, located on Water Street adjacent to the river, supplied many weapons to forces in the Civil War.

In the 20th century, the river continued to see its share of action, but only briefly. The last ship to sail from Assonet set out in 1902. Small bootlegging operations used the river sporadically. The Green Dragon Tavern was torn down in the 1930s, and the Town of Freetown constructed its bandstand on the riverside site, providing a wonderful greenspace. The gun factory burned in 1925, and the bleachery followed suit in 1955, essentially bringing the commercial life of the river to a close.

Assonet Bay Shores, a former summer community, is a peninsula formed by Assonet Bay, Payne Cove, and Shepherd&#x27;s Cove. It was first settled early in Assonet&#x27;s history, with this major development following in the early 1960s. Across Shepherd&#x27;s Cove is an abundance of higher-end homes, proving that the river has found new life as a beautiful backdrop for rural life.

<text>Jessica Louise Cutler (born May 18, 1978) is an American blogger, author, and former congressional staff assistant who was fired for detailing her active sexual life, including receiving money for having sex (prostitution), in her blog.

==Career==

===Education===
Cutler was born in Monterey, California. She attended Syracuse University, and was a photo editor at the student newspaper, &quot;The Daily Orange&quot;.

===Washingtonienne===
In 2004 while a staff assistant for Senator Michael DeWine, Cutler published a short-lived blog called &quot;Washingtonienne&quot; describing her life in Washington, D.C. which included graphic details of her sex life.

Cutler justified receiving money from her lovers by saying, &quot;I&#x27;m sure I am not the only one who makes money on the side this way: How can anybody live on $25K/year??&quot;

Her identity was revealed by the blog &quot;Wonkette&quot; in May 2004, which resulted in a scandal on Capitol Hill.

On May 21, 2004, Cutler was fired for &quot;unacceptable use of Senate computers&quot; by Senator DeWine. Media treatment of Cutler was harsh, the &quot;Philadelphia Daily News&quot; going so far as to label her a &quot;DC slut&quot;. Cutler, though, has been relatively accepting of her notoriety:
In summer 2004, Playboy.com featured an interview and nude pictures of Cutler.

She wrote a novel based on her experiences and blog: &quot;The Washingtonienne: A Novel&quot;, selling it for a reported $300,000. A reviewer for the &quot;Washington Post&quot; wrote, &quot;&quot;The Washingtonienne&quot; gives hints of being lively, funny and agreeably in-your-face.&quot; Judy Bachrach of &quot;The Weekly Standard&quot; wrote, &quot;This is a novel of uncommon candor, humor, and perspicacity, and I loved every page of it.&quot;

===Steinbuch lawsuit===
In June 2005, Robert Steinbuch, who says that he is the person Cutler referred to as &quot;RS&quot; on her blog, filed a lawsuit against her, seeking over $75,000 in damages. Steinbuch&#x27;s complaint and related filings, filed in federal court in Washington, D.C., describe the case as for &quot;defamation,&quot; &quot;false light,&quot; &quot;invasion of privacy for public revelation of private facts,&quot; the &quot;intentional infliction of emotional distress,&quot; and &quot;other causes of action.&quot; Cutler is represented by Atlanta lawyer, Matthew C. Billips, and D.C. lawyer, John R. Ates. On May 30, 2007, Cutler filed for bankruptcy in an attempt to protect herself from potential debts. Listed among potential creditors were some of her former attorneys, as well as Steinbuch. At the time she filed for bankruptcy, staying the case in the DC District Court, a motion to dismiss—as a sanction against Steinbuch for refusing to comply with Court Ordered discovery—was still pending.

Steinbuch also filed a $20 million suit against her in Arkansas, where he lives and works as a law professor. The lawsuit was eyed closely by privacy groups because it could establish whether bloggers are obligated to protect the privacy of those they name in their online public blogs. The Arkansas case was dismissed for &quot;forum non-conveniens&quot; by the district court. However, the United States Court of Appeals reversed the district judge in Arkansas, holding that he abused his discretion and ruled incorrectly. Eventually, after the case was sent back to the district judge in Arkansas, the district judge transferred the case to another judge.

It was reported in 2007 that cable television channel HBO and entertainment company Disney, whom Steinbuch also sued, are working on a TV series about Cutler&#x27;s story.

According to the &quot;New York Law Journal&quot;, Steinbuch was ordered to reimburse discovery expenses regarding a deposition to Cutler&#x27;s attorney Billips in June 2009. Billips has filed an affidavit requesting over $14,000 in fees and expenses.

==Personal life==
In 2008, she married Charles Rubio, a lawyer, in New York City. She gave birth in August 2009 to a daughter, Jessica-Louise.

<doc id="726737" wikidata="Q727892" url="?curid=726737" title="Black Warrior River">
<text>The Black Warrior River is a waterway in west-central Alabama in the southeastern United States. The river rises in the extreme southern edges of the Appalachian Highlands and flows 178 miles (286 km) to the Tombigbee River, of which the Black Warrior is the primary tributary. The river is named after the Mississippian paramount chief Tuskaloosa, whose name was Muskogean for &#x27;Black Warrior&#x27;. The Black Warrior is impounded along nearly its entire course by a series of locks and dams to form a chain of reservoirs that not only provide a path for an inland waterway, but also yield hydroelectric power, drinking water, and industrial water.

The river flows through the Black Warrior Basin, a region historically important for the extraction of coal and methane. The cities of Tuscaloosa and Northport grew at the historical head of navigation at the fall line between the Appalachian Highlands (specifically, the Cumberland Plateau) and the Gulf Coastal Plain. Birmingham, though not directly on the river, became a manufacturing hub and one of the largest cities in the South partly through the use of the Black Warrior River for the transportation of goods. Birmingham grew up around a major junction of north-south and east-west railroads, just as Atlanta, Georgia did.

Overall, the watershed of the Black Warrior has an area of 6,275 square miles (16,250 km2).

== Course ==
The Black Warrior River is formed about 22 mi (40 km) west of Birmingham by the confluence of the Mulberry Fork and the Locust Fork of the Warrior River, which join as arms of Bankhead Lake, a narrow reservoir on the upper river formed by the Bankhead Lock and Dam. Bankhead Lake drains directly into Holt Lake, formed by the Holt Lock and Dam, which itself then drains into Oliver Lake, formed by the Oliver Lock and Dam. These three reservoirs encompass the entire course of the river for its upper 60 miles (80 km) stretching southeast into central Tuscaloosa County and Tuscaloosa, the largest city on the river. Past Oliver Dam, immediately west of downtown Tuscaloosa, the Black Warrior flows generally south in a highly meandering course, joining the Tombigbee River from the northeast at Demopolis. The lower 30 miles (48 km) of the river are part of the long, narrow Lake Demopolis. 

The Black Warrior River receives its largest tributary, the North River, from the north about one mile (1.6 km) northeast of Tuscaloosa. North River was dammed in 1968 to form Lake Tuscaloosa, and is the main source for drinking water for the cities, towns, and unincorporated areas of Tuscaloosa County.

== Crossings ==
Outside Tuscaloosa County, only three vehicular crossings of the Black Warrior River exist. Within Tuscaloosa County are seven, though none are upstream of the Paul Bryant Bridge in Tuscaloosa.

== History ==
Variant names of the river used over time include Apotaka Hacha River, Bance River, Canebrake or Coinbrake River, Chocta River, Pafallaya River, Patagahatche River, Tascaloosa River, Tuskaloosa River, and Warrior River.

Historically, the river was called the Warrior River above Tuscaloosa and the Black Warrior River below Tuscaloosa. Though unofficial, this naming convention is still often used by the public and occasionally by government agencies. However, the official name of the entire river from Bankhead Lake south is the Black Warrior River.

To develop the coal industries of central Alabama, the US government in the 1880s began building a system of locks and dams that concluded in 17 impoundments. The first 16 locks and dams were constructed of sandstone quarried from the banks of the river and the river bed. Huge blocks of stone were hand shaped with hammer and chisel to construct the locks and dams, and a few of these dams were in service until the 1960s. One example of the craftsmanship of the stone locks is at University Park on Jack Warner Parkway in Tuscaloosa. The bank side wall of Lock 3 (Later renumbered Lock 12 and today largely disassembled) is the last remnant of the old dams made of this dressed stone from the late 1800s. A concrete dam completed in 1915, Lock 17 (John H. Bankhead Lock and Dam) is the last and only existing of the original dams, and has been modernized over the years with the addition of spillway gates, and replacement of the two-stage lift with a larger single-lift lock. Lock 17 and Holt Lock and Dam also have hydroelectric power plants owned by the Alabama Power Company supplying electricity for west-central Alabama areas.

This lock and dam system made the Black Warrior River navigable along its entire course and it is one of the longest channelized waterways in the United States forming part of the extended system that link the Gulf of Mexico to Birmingham. Birmingham became the &quot;Pittsburgh of the South&quot;, shipping iron and steel products via the Black Warrior River through the Panama Canal to the West Coast of the United States and the world. High-grade coal is barged to Mobile and is then shipped throughout the world, making Mobile the largest coal port in the Southeastern states. Coal mining and production in west-central Alabama is one of the larger employers and is likely to continue being important to the energy needs of the world.

Today, a severe threat to the Black Warrior River is sedimentation, or siltation, the primary causes of which are development projects, logging and mining operations, and the building and maintaining of roads.

<doc id="726739" wikidata="Q2484063" url="?curid=726739" title="Massachusetts Route 79">
<text>Route 79 is a state highway in southeastern Massachusetts. The route had formerly began as a highway in Fall River, also known as the Fall River Viaduct and Western Fall River Expressway, before becoming a more rural route further north. Most of the southern expressway portion of the route was permanently closed by MassDOT in 2023 for conversion into a street level urban boulevard.

==Route description==

Route 79 begins south of the Braga Bridge and I-195, multiplexed with Route 138 as a surface four-lane controlled-access highway. It has exits to Davol Street, which act as one-way frontage roads on both sides of Route 79, and to the Veterans Memorial Bridge, at which point Route 138 leaves Route 79 and goes over the bridge.

The route continues northward, passing under North Main Street with exit access to that street. It then connects to Route 24 at that route&#x27;s exit 7. There is no access between Route 79 north and Route 24 south, or vice versa. The route continues concurrently along Route 24 into the Assonet section of the town of Freetown, where it leaves its concurrency at exit 11 (formerly 9), turning on to South Main Street. (South Main Street southbound in Assonet connects to North Main Street in Fall River.) The route passes through the village before turning eastward along Elm Street, intertwining with the Assonet River as both make their way into Berkley.

In Berkley, Route 79 passes through the village of Myricks, in the far eastern end of the town. It crosses the New Bedford Secondary in Myricks, and Route 140 just over the Taunton line. In Taunton, the route follows along the Taunton-Lakeville town line before leaving Taunton completely. In Lakeville, the route heads through the northern part of the town, crossing Route 18 and passing the former Lakeville Hospital, before ending at a 4-way intersection with Route 105 and Commercial Drive (the entry to Middleborough/Lakeville station).
==History==
In 1958, the northern end of the Western Fall River Expressway opened, which carried Route 79 from Route 24 south to an interchange at North Main Street in Fall River. In 1965, as part of the construction of I-195 from Swansea through Somerset and Fall River to Westport, the southern section of the expressway, along the Fall River Viaduct, was opened, connecting between an interchange with Route 138 (&quot;Broadway Extended&quot;) and I-195 north to a partial interchange with Route 138 along a one-way pair of North Davol Street and South Davol Street.

Prior to the completion of the central section of the Western Fall River Expressway (relocation of Route 79) which connected the 1965-opened southern section on the Fall River Viaduct to the 1958-built northern section (between North Main Street and a partial interchange with Route 24, both in North Fall River) in 1974, Route 79 followed North Main Street south of the end of the expressway&#x27;s northern section down to Route 79&#x27;s southern terminus at US 6 (President Avenue) slightly to the east of the completed expressway and Davol Street one-way pair.

In 2012, the northern terminus of Route 79 was relocated. Before the project, the northern terminus of Route 79 still ended at Route 105, only 1/10 of a mile north of its current terminus, but it was too close to the southbound ramps for Interstate 495. By relocating Route 79 to a four-way intersection with Route 105 and Commercial Drive, traffic was eased during rush hour. Instead of Route 79 traffic looping onto Route 105 to get to the MBTA station, the new alignment provides easier access to the MBTA station from areas such as North Lakeville, East Taunton, Berkley and Freetown.

The southern end of Route 79 used to be a double-decked elevated highway called the Fall River Viaduct, with ramps to Route 138 and I-195. The viaduct continued northward under the Braga Bridge for a third of a mile before splitting into a surface four-lane highway. As part of a $3 billion effort to replace structurally deficient bridges in Massachusetts, the Massachusetts Department of Transportation replaced the Fall River Viaduct and some of its connector ramps to I-195 with new roadways and structures. The project was completed in 2016.
=== Expressway closure and redevelopment ===
Discussions to permanently close the expressway portion of Route 79 began in the early 2000s. Despite local officials and residents calling for the expressway&#x27;s removal by the early 2010s, MassDOT moved forward with a plan to include a large multi-acre highway interchange with Route 79 and U.S. Route 6 as a part of the Veterans Memorial Bridge project in 2011. Expressway removal advocates viewed the Western Fall River Expressway as a vestige of urban blight that had been induced by twentieth-century highway construction practices; city officials viewed the expressway as a preclusion to the economic development of Fall River&#x27;s waterfront.

In 2014 MassDOT completed an improvement study of the Route 79-Davol Street corridor. The study examined many options to improve safety, mobility, and connections to the Taunton riverfront; the study ultimately recommended an alternative that called for replacing Route 79 and Davol Street with an at-grade urban boulevard. The study found that Route 79 carried approximately between 20,000 and 30,000 vehicles per day with excess capacity; this gave MassDOT justification to commence preliminary planning to remove the four-lane elevated expressway in 2018.

The expressway closed permanently on February 27, 2023, with demolition of the expressway commencing shortly after. The aptly named &quot;Route 79 Improvement Project&quot; seeks to reroute traffic onto existing surface streets and convert them to an urban boulevard; those surface streets will also get upgraded sidewalks, shared-use pathways, and crosswalks. The project will also build new cross-streets to re-connect portions of the historic street grid and improve access between the city&#x27;s North End neighborhood and the riverfront. The project will free up almost 17 acres of riverfront land between the Senator Norton City Pier park and Brightman Street; additionally, most of the land will be within walking distance of Fall River&#x27;s South Coast Rail MBTA Commuter Rail station which is under construction one block to the east of Route 79. Fall River economic development officials and local investors view the project as opportunity to create new housing in walkable neighborhoods on the newly available land that the expressway had formerly occupied.

The Route 79 Improvement Project is projected to be complete in 2026.

<text>Glen William Bell Jr. (September 3, 1923 – January 16, 2010) was an American restaurateur who founded Taco Bell.

==Biography==
Glen Bell was born in Lynwood, California, to Glen William Bell Sr. and Ruth Elizabeth Bell (née Johnson). His parents were born in the Midwest with his mother having been born in Kandiyohi County, Minnesota and his father in Franklin County, Iowa. Bell&#x27;s mother Ruth was born to a half Swedish father and a predominantly English mother. His father Glen Sr. was born to a German father and predominantly English mother, Glen also had colonial New England ancestry through both his parents&#x27; families. Bell graduated from San Bernardino High School in 1941. He served in the U.S. Marine Corps as a cook during World War II. After the Marines, he started his first hot dog stand &#x27;Bell&#x27;s Drive-In&#x27;, in San Bernardino in 1948. In 1952, he sold the hot dog stand and built a second location selling hot dogs and hamburgers. He soon started selling tacos at a taco stand named Taco-Tia at 19 cents each from a side window. Between 1954 and 1955, he opened three Taco Tias in the San Bernardino area, eventually selling those restaurants and opening four El Tacos with a partner in the Long Beach area. He partnered with John Galardi, originally hired as a part-time worker and then a manager. Galardi later founded the Wienerschnitzel hot dog chain.

Glen Bell learned how to make tacos from the Mitla Café in San Bernardino under his then mentor chef, Gloria Hoyle.

In 1962, he went solo and sold the El Tacos to his partner and opened his first Taco Bell in Downey, California. Bell franchised his restaurant in 1964. His company grew rapidly, and the 868-restaurant chain was later sold to PepsiCo in 1978 for $125 million in stock.

=== West Side and Cherry Valley Railroad ===
In the late 1970s, Bell opened a tourist railroad at Tuolumne, California. This gauge railroad used the lower section of the track and several steam locomotives of the West Side Lumber Company railway. The operation offered boat rides on the old mill pond and RV parking. In the initial plan, there were themed areas of the park with restaurants and stores. Glen Bell was able to locate and purchase old equipment (trains, cars, water towers, etc.) that were used in logging operations and brought to the park. It closed in the early 1980s after falling traffic.

The property was eventually sold off to the Tuolumne tribe of the Mi Wuk Natives who have developed the land including event grounds.

== Death ==
Bell died from Parkinson&#x27;s disease on January 16, 2010, at age 86 in Rancho Santa Fe, California, leaving a wife, Martha, two sons, one daughter, four grandchildren, and three sisters.

<text>Black-body radiation is the thermal electromagnetic radiation within, or surrounding, a body in thermodynamic equilibrium with its environment, emitted by a black body (an idealized opaque, non-reflective body). It has a specific, continuous spectrum of wavelengths, inversely related to intensity, that depend only on the body&#x27;s temperature, which is assumed, for the sake of calculations and theory, to be uniform and constant.

A perfectly insulated enclosure which is in thermal equilibrium internally contains blackbody radiation, and will emit it through a hole made in its wall, provided the hole is small enough to have a negligible effect upon the equilibrium. The thermal radiation spontaneously emitted by many ordinary objects can be approximated as blackbody radiation.

Of particular importance, although planets and stars (including the Earth and Sun) are neither in thermal equilibrium with their surroundings nor perfect black bodies, blackbody radiation is still a good first approximation for the energy they emit. 

The term &quot;black body&quot; was introduced by Gustav Kirchhoff in 1860. Blackbody radiation is also called thermal radiation, &quot;cavity radiation&quot;, &quot;complete radiation&quot; or &quot;temperature radiation&quot;.

==Theory==

===Spectrum===
Black-body radiation has a characteristic, continuous frequency spectrum that depends only on the body&#x27;s temperature, called the Planck spectrum or Planck&#x27;s law. The spectrum is peaked at a characteristic frequency that shifts to higher frequencies with increasing temperature, and at room temperature most of the emission is in the infrared region of the electromagnetic spectrum. As the temperature increases past about 500 degrees Celsius, black bodies start to emit significant amounts of visible light. Viewed in the dark by the human eye, the first faint glow appears as a &quot;ghostly&quot; grey (the visible light is actually red, but low intensity light activates only the eye&#x27;s grey-level sensors). With rising temperature, the glow becomes visible even when there is some background surrounding light: first as a dull red, then yellow, and eventually a &quot;dazzling bluish-white&quot; as the temperature rises. When the body appears white, it is emitting a substantial fraction of its energy as ultraviolet radiation. The Sun, with an effective temperature of approximately 5800 K, is an approximate black body with an emission spectrum peaked in the central, yellow-green part of the visible spectrum, but with significant power in the ultraviolet as well.

Blackbody radiation provides insight into the thermodynamic equilibrium state of cavity radiation.

===Black body===
All normal (baryonic) matter emits electromagnetic radiation when it has a temperature above absolute zero. The radiation represents a conversion of a body&#x27;s internal energy into electromagnetic energy, and is therefore called thermal radiation. It is a spontaneous process of radiative distribution of entropy.

Conversely, all normal matter absorbs electromagnetic radiation to some degree. An object that absorbs all radiation falling on it, at all wavelengths, is called a black body. When a black body is at a uniform temperature, its emission has a characteristic frequency distribution that depends on the temperature. Its emission is called blackbody radiation.

The concept of the black body is an idealization, as perfect black bodies do not exist in nature. However, graphite and lamp black, with emissivities greater than 0.95, are good approximations to a black material. Experimentally, blackbody radiation may be established best as the ultimately stable steady state equilibrium radiation in a cavity in a rigid body, at a uniform temperature, that is entirely opaque and is only partly reflective. A closed box with walls of graphite at a constant temperature with a small hole on one side produces a good approximation to ideal blackbody radiation emanating from the opening.

Blackbody radiation has the unique absolutely stable distribution of radiative intensity that can persist in thermodynamic equilibrium in a cavity. In equilibrium, for each frequency, the intensity of radiation which is emitted and reflected from a body relative to other frequencies (that is, the net amount of radiation leaving its surface, called the &quot;spectral radiance&quot;) is determined solely by the equilibrium temperature and does not depend upon the shape, material or structure of the body. For a black body (a perfect absorber) there is no reflected radiation, and so the spectral radiance is entirely due to emission. In addition, a black body is a diffuse emitter (its emission is independent of direction). 

Blackbody radiation becomes a visible glow of light if the temperature of the object is high enough. The Draper point is the temperature at which all solids glow a dim red, about . At , a small opening in the wall of a large uniformly heated opaque-walled cavity (such as an oven), viewed from outside, looks red; at , it looks white. No matter how the oven is constructed, or of what material, as long as it is built so that almost all light entering is absorbed by its walls, it will contain a good approximation to blackbody radiation. The spectrum, and therefore color, of the light that comes out will be a function of the cavity temperature alone. A graph of the spectral radiation intensity plotted versus frequency(or wavelength) is called the &quot;blackbody curve&quot;. Different curves are obtained by varying the temperature.

When the body is black, the absorption is obvious: the amount of light absorbed is all the light that hits the surface. For a black body much bigger than the wavelength, the light energy absorbed at any wavelength &quot;λ&quot; per unit time is strictly proportional to the blackbody curve. This means that the blackbody curve is the amount of light energy emitted by a black body, which justifies the name. This is the condition for the applicability of Kirchhoff&#x27;s law of thermal radiation: the blackbody curve is characteristic of thermal light, which depends only on the temperature of the walls of the cavity, provided that the walls of the cavity are completely opaque and are not very reflective, and that the cavity is in thermodynamic equilibrium. When the black body is small, so that its size is comparable to the wavelength of light, the absorption is modified, because a small object is not an efficient absorber of light of long wavelength, but the principle of strict equality of emission and absorption is always upheld in a condition of thermodynamic equilibrium.

In the laboratory, blackbody radiation is approximated by the radiation from a small hole in a large cavity, a hohlraum, in an entirely opaque body that is only partly reflective, that is maintained at a constant temperature. (This technique leads to the alternative term &quot;cavity radiation&quot;.) Any light entering the hole would have to reflect off the walls of the cavity multiple times before it escaped, in which process it is nearly certain to be absorbed. Absorption occurs regardless of the wavelength of the radiation entering (as long as it is small compared to the hole). The hole, then, is a close approximation of a theoretical black body and, if the cavity is heated, the spectrum of the hole&#x27;s radiation (that is, the amount of light emitted from the hole at each wavelength) will be continuous, and will depend only on the temperature and the fact that the walls are opaque and at least partly absorptive, but not on the particular material of which they are built nor on the material in the cavity (compare with emission spectrum).

The radiance or observed intensity is not a function of direction. Therefore, a black body is a perfect Lambertian radiator.

Real objects never behave as full-ideal black bodies, and instead the emitted radiation at a given frequency is a fraction of what the ideal emission would be. The emissivity of a material specifies how well a real body radiates energy as compared with a black body. This emissivity depends on factors such as temperature, emission angle, and wavelength. However, it is typical in engineering to assume that a surface&#x27;s spectral emissivity and absorptivity do not depend on wavelength so that the emissivity is a constant. This is known as the &quot;gray body&quot; assumption.

With non-black surfaces, the deviations from ideal blackbody behavior are determined by both the surface structure, such as roughness or granularity, and the chemical composition. On a &quot;per wavelength&quot; basis, real objects in states of local thermodynamic equilibrium still follow Kirchhoff&#x27;s Law: emissivity equals absorptivity, so that an object that does not absorb all incident light will also emit less radiation than an ideal black body; the incomplete absorption can be due to some of the incident light being transmitted through the body or to some of it being reflected at the surface of the body.

In astronomy, objects such as stars are frequently regarded as black bodies, though this is often a poor approximation. An almost perfect blackbody spectrum is exhibited by the cosmic microwave background radiation. Hawking radiation is the hypothetical blackbody radiation emitted by black holes, at a temperature that depends on the mass, charge, and spin of the hole. If this prediction is correct, black holes will very gradually shrink and evaporate over time as they lose mass by the emission of photons and other particles.

A black body radiates energy at all frequencies, but its intensity rapidly tends to zero at high frequencies (short wavelengths). For example, a black body at room temperature () with one square meter of surface area will emit a photon in the visible range (390–750 nm) at an average rate of one photon every 41 seconds, meaning that, for most practical purposes, such a black body does not emit in the visible range.

The study of the laws of black bodies and the failure of classical physics to describe them helped establish the foundations of quantum mechanics.

=== Further explanation ===
According to the Classical Theory of Radiation, if each Fourier mode of the equilibrium radiation (in an otherwise empty cavity with perfectly reflective walls) is considered as a degree of freedom capable of exchanging energy, then, according to the equipartition theorem of classical physics, there would be an equal amount of energy in each mode. Since there are an infinite number of modes, this would imply infinite heat capacity, as well as a nonphysical spectrum of emitted radiation that grows without bound with increasing frequency, a problem known as the ultraviolet catastrophe.
In the longer wavelengths this deviation is not so noticeable, as formula_1 and formula_2 are very small. In the shorter wavelengths of the ultraviolet range, however, classical theory predicts the energy emitted tends to infinity, hence the ultraviolet catastrophe. The theory even predicted that all bodies would emit most of their energy in the ultraviolet range, clearly contradicted by the experimental data which showed a different peak wavelength at different temperatures (see also Wien&#x27;s law).

Instead, in the quantum treatment of this problem, the numbers of the energy modes are quantized, attenuating the spectrum at high frequency in agreement with experimental observation and resolving the catastrophe. The modes that had more energy than the thermal energy of the substance itself were not considered, and because of quantization modes having infinitesimally little energy were excluded.

Thus for shorter wavelengths very few modes (having energy more than formula_1) were allowed, supporting the data that the energy emitted is reduced for wavelengths less than the wavelength of the observed peak of emission.

Notice that there are two factors responsible for the shape of the graph, which can be seen as working opposite to one another. Firstly, shorter wavelengths have a larger number of modes associated with them. This accounts for the increase in spectral radiance as one moves from the longest wavelengths towards the peak at relatively shorter wavelengths. Secondly, though, at shorter wavelengths more energy is needed to reach the threshold level to occupy each mode: the more energy needed to excite the mode, the lower the probability that this mode will be occupied. As the wavelength decreases, the probability of exciting the mode becomes exceedingly small, leading to fewer of these modes being occupied: this accounts for the decrease in spectral radiance at very short wavelengths, left of the peak. Combined, they give the characteristic graph.

Calculating the blackbody curve was a major challenge in theoretical physics during the late nineteenth century. The problem was solved in 1901 by Max Planck in the formalism now known as Planck&#x27;s law of blackbody radiation. By making changes to Wien&#x27;s radiation law (not to be confused with Wien&#x27;s displacement law) consistent with thermodynamics and electromagnetism, he found a mathematical expression fitting the experimental data satisfactorily. Planck had to assume that the energy of the oscillators in the cavity was quantized, which is to say that it existed in integer multiples of some quantity. Einstein built on this idea and proposed the quantization of electromagnetic radiation itself in 1905 to explain the photoelectric effect. These theoretical advances eventually resulted in the superseding of classical electromagnetism by quantum electrodynamics. These quanta were called photons and the blackbody cavity was thought of as containing a gas of photons. In addition, it led to the development of quantum probability distributions, called Fermi–Dirac statistics and Bose–Einstein statistics, each applicable to a different class of particles, fermions and bosons.

The wavelength at which the radiation is strongest is given by Wien&#x27;s displacement law, and the overall power emitted per unit area is given by the Stefan–Boltzmann law. So, as temperature increases, the glow color changes from red to yellow to white to blue. Even as the peak wavelength moves into the ultra-violet, enough radiation continues to be emitted in the blue wavelengths that the body will continue to appear blue. It will never become invisible—indeed, the radiation of visible light increases monotonically with temperature. The Stefan–Boltzmann law also says that the total radiant heat energy emitted from a surface is proportional to the fourth power of its absolute temperature. The law was formulated by Josef Stefan in 1879 and later derived by Ludwig Boltzmann. The formula is given, where &quot;E&quot; is the radiant heat emitted from a unit of area per unit time, &quot;T&quot; is the absolute temperature, and is the Stefan–Boltzmann constant.

==Equations==

===Planck&#x27;s law of blackbody radiation===

Planck&#x27;s law states that
formula_4
where

For a black body surface, the spectral radiance density (defined per unit of area normal to the propagation) is independent of the angle formula_5 of emission with respect to the normal. However, this means that, following Lambert&#x27;s cosine law, formula_6 is the radiance density per unit area of emitting surface as the surface area involved in generating the radiance is increased by a factor formula_7 with respect to an area normal to the propagation direction. At oblique angles, the solid angle spans involved do get smaller, resulting in lower aggregate intensities.

The emitted energy flux density or irradiance formula_8, is related to the photon flux density formula_9 through
formula_10

===Wien&#x27;s displacement law===

Wien&#x27;s displacement law shows how the spectrum of blackbody radiation at any temperature is related to the spectrum at any other temperature. If we know the shape of the spectrum at one temperature, we can calculate the shape at any other temperature. Spectral intensity can be expressed as a function of wavelength or of frequency.

A consequence of Wien&#x27;s displacement law is that the wavelength at which the intensity &quot;per unit wavelength&quot; of the radiation produced by a black body has a local maximum or peak, formula_11, is a function only of the temperature:
formula_12
where the constant &quot;b&quot;, known as Wien&#x27;s displacement constant, is equal to formula_13 . formula_14 is the Lambert W function. So formula_11 is approximately 2898 μm/T, with the temperature given in kelvins. At a typical room temperature of 293 K (20 °C), the maximum intensity is at .

Planck&#x27;s law was also stated above as a function of frequency. The intensity maximum for this is given by
formula_16
In unitless form, the maximum occurs when where The approximate numerical solution is formula_17. At a typical room temperature of 293 K (20 °C), the maximum intensity is for .

===Stefan–Boltzmann law===
By integrating formula_18 over the frequency the radiance formula_19 (units: power / [area × solid angle] ) is
formula_20
by using formula_21 with formula_22 and with formula_23 being the Stefan–Boltzmann constant.

On a side note, at a distance d, the intensity formula_24 per area formula_25 of radiating surface is the useful expression
formula_26
when the receiving surface is perpendicular to the radiation.

By subsequently integrating formula_19 over the solid angle formula_28 for all azimuthal angle (0 to formula_29) and polar angle formula_5 from 0 to formula_31, we arrive at the Stefan–Boltzmann law: the power emitted per unit area of the surface of a black body is directly proportional to the fourth power of its absolute temperature:
formula_32
We used
formula_33

==Applications==

===Human-body emission===

The human body radiates energy as infrared light. The net power radiated is the difference between the power emitted and the power absorbed:
formula_34
Applying the Stefan–Boltzmann law,
formula_35
where and are the body surface area and temperature, formula_36 is the emissivity, and is the ambient temperature.

The total surface area of an adult is about , and the mid- and far-infrared emissivity of skin and most clothing is near unity, as it is for most nonmetallic surfaces. Skin temperature is about 33 °C, but clothing reduces the surface temperature to about 28 °C when the ambient temperature is 20 °C. Hence, the net radiative heat loss is about
formula_37
The total energy radiated in one day is about 8 MJ, or 2000 kcal (food calories). Basal metabolic rate for a 40-year-old male is about 35 kcal/(m2·h), which is equivalent to 1700 kcal per day, assuming the same 2 m2 area. However, the mean metabolic rate of sedentary adults is about 50% to 70% greater than their basal rate.

There are other important thermal loss mechanisms, including convection and evaporation. Conduction is negligible – the Nusselt number is much greater than unity. Evaporation by perspiration is only required if radiation and convection are insufficient to maintain a steady-state temperature (but evaporation from the lungs occurs regardless). Free-convection rates are comparable, albeit somewhat lower, than radiative rates. Thus, radiation accounts for about two-thirds of thermal energy loss in cool, still air. Given the approximate nature of many of the assumptions, this can only be taken as a crude estimate. Ambient air motion, causing forced convection, or evaporation reduces the relative importance of radiation as a thermal-loss mechanism.

Application of Wien&#x27;s law to human-body emission results in a peak wavelength of
formula_38
For this reason, thermal imaging devices for human subjects are most sensitive in the 7–14 micrometer range.

===Temperature relation between a planet and its star===
The blackbody law may be used to estimate the temperature of a planet orbiting the Sun.
The temperature of a planet depends on several factors:
*Incident radiation from its star
*Emitted radiation of the planet (for example, Earth&#x27;s infrared glow)
*The albedo effect causing a fraction of light to be reflected by the planet
*The greenhouse effect for planets with an atmosphere
*Energy generated internally by a planet itself due to radioactive decay, tidal heating, and adiabatic contraction due to cooling.

The analysis only considers the Sun&#x27;s heat for a planet in a Solar System.

The Stefan–Boltzmann law gives the total power (energy/second) that the Sun emits:

where 

The Sun emits that power equally in all directions. Because of this, the planet is hit with only a tiny fraction of it. The power from the Sun that strikes the planet (at the top of the atmosphere) is:

where 

Because of its high temperature, the Sun emits to a large extent in the ultraviolet and visible (UV-Vis) frequency range. In this frequency range, the planet reflects a fraction formula_39 of this energy where formula_39 is the albedo or reflectance of the planet in the UV-Vis range. In other words, the planet absorbs a fraction formula_41 of the Sun&#x27;s light, and reflects the rest. The power absorbed by the planet and its atmosphere is then:
Even though the planet only absorbs as a circular area formula_42, it emits in all directions; the spherical surface area being formula_43. If the planet were a perfect black body, it would emit according to the Stefan–Boltzmann law

where formula_44 is the temperature of the planet. This temperature, calculated for the case of the planet acting as a black body by setting formula_45, is known as the effective temperature. The actual temperature of the planet will likely be different, depending on its surface and atmospheric properties. Ignoring the atmosphere and greenhouse effect, the planet, since it is at a much lower temperature than the Sun, emits mostly in the infrared (IR) portion of the spectrum. In this frequency range, it emits formula_46 of the radiation that a black body would emit where formula_46 is the average emissivity in the IR range. The power emitted by the planet is then:
For a body in radiative exchange equilibrium with its surroundings, the rate at which it emits radiant energy is equal to the rate at which it absorbs it:
Substituting the expressions for solar and planet power in equations 1–6 and simplifying yields the estimated temperature of the planet, ignoring greenhouse effect, :
}}{2D}} &lt;/math&gt;|}}

In other words, given the assumptions made, the temperature of a planet depends only on the surface temperature of the Sun, the radius of the Sun, the distance between the planet and the Sun, the albedo and the IR emissivity of the planet.

Notice that a gray (flat spectrum) ball where formula_48 comes to the same temperature as a black body no matter how dark or light gray.

Substituting the measured values for the Sun and Earth yields:
*formula_49
*formula_50
*formula_51
*formula_52

With the average emissivity formula_53 set to unity, the effective temperature of the Earth is:
formula_54
or −18.8 °C.

This is the temperature of the Earth if it radiated as a perfect black body in the infrared, assuming an unchanging albedo and ignoring greenhouse effects (which can raise the surface temperature of a body above what it would be if it were a perfect black body in all spectrums). The Earth in fact radiates not quite as a perfect black body in the infrared which will raise the estimated temperature a few degrees above the effective temperature. If we wish to estimate what the temperature of the Earth would be if it had no atmosphere, then we could take the albedo and emissivity of the Moon as a good estimate. The albedo and emissivity of the Moon are about 0.1054 and 0.95 respectively, yielding an estimated temperature of about 1.36 °C.

Estimates of the Earth&#x27;s average albedo vary in the range 0.3–0.4, resulting in different estimated effective temperatures. Estimates are often based on the solar constant (total insolation power density) rather than the temperature, size, and distance of the Sun. For example, using 0.4 for albedo, and an insolation of 1400 W m−2, one obtains an effective temperature of about 245 K.
Similarly using albedo 0.3 and solar constant of 1372 W m−2, one obtains an effective temperature of 255 K.

===Cosmology===

The cosmic microwave background radiation observed today is the most perfect blackbody radiation ever observed in nature, with a temperature of about 2.7 K. It is a &quot;snapshot&quot; of the radiation at the time of decoupling between matter and radiation in the early universe. Prior to this time, most matter in the universe was in the form of an ionized plasma in thermal, though not full thermodynamic, equilibrium with radiation.

According to Kondepudi and Prigogine, at very high temperatures (above 1010 K; such temperatures existed in the very early universe), where the thermal motion separates protons and neutrons in spite of the strong nuclear forces, electron-positron pairs appear and disappear spontaneously and are in thermal equilibrium with electromagnetic radiation. These particles form a part of the black body spectrum, in addition to the electromagnetic radiation.

A black body at room temperature () radiates mostly in the infrared spectrum, which cannot be perceived by the human eye, but can be sensed by some reptiles. As the object increases in temperature to about , the emission spectrum gets stronger and extends into the human visual range, and the object appears dull red. As its temperature increases further, it emits more and more orange, yellow, green, and then blue light (and ultimately beyond violet, ultraviolet).

===Light bulb===
Tungsten filament lights have a continuous black body spectrum with a cooler colour temperature, around , which also emits considerable energy in the infrared range. Modern-day fluorescent and LED lights, which are more efficient, do not have a continuous black body emission spectrum, rather emitting directly, or using combinations of phosphors that emit multiple narrow spectrums.
==History==
In query 6 of Isaac Newton&#x27;s &quot;Opticks&quot;, he states that &quot;Do not black Bodies conceive heat more easily from Light than those of other Colours do, by reason that the Light falling on them is not reflected outwards, but enters into the Bodies, and is often reflected and refracted within them, until it be stifled and lost?&quot;, thereby introducing the notion of a black body. In his first memoir, Augustin-Jean Fresnel (1788–1827) responded to a view he extracted from a French translation of Newton&#x27;s &quot;Opticks&quot;. He says that Newton imagined particles of light traversing space uninhibited by the caloric medium filling it, and refutes this view (never actually held by Newton) by saying that a black body under illumination would increase indefinitely in heat.

===Balfour Stewart===
In 1858, Balfour Stewart described his experiments on the thermal radiative emissive and absorptive powers of polished plates of various substances, compared with the powers of lamp-black surfaces, at the same temperature. Stewart chose lamp-black surfaces as his reference because of various previous experimental findings, especially those of Pierre Prevost and of John Leslie. He wrote, &quot;Lamp-black, which absorbs all the rays that fall upon it, and therefore possesses the greatest possible absorbing power, will possess also the greatest possible radiating power.&quot; Stewart&#x27;s statement assumed a general principle: that there exists a body or surface that has the greatest possible absorbing and radiative power for every wavelength and equilibrium temperature.

Stewart was concerned with selective thermal radiation, which he investigated using plates which selectively radiated and absorbed different wavelengths. He discussed the experiments in terms of rays which could be reflected and refracted, and which obeyed the Stokes-Helmholtz reciprocity principle. His research did not consider that properties of rays are dependent on wavelength, and he did not use tools such as prisms or diffraction gratings. His work was quantitative within these constraints. He made his measurements in a room temperature environment, and quickly so as to catch his bodies in a condition near the thermal equilibrium in which they had been prepared. 

===Gustav Kirchhoff===
In 1859, Gustav Robert Kirchhoff reported the coincidence of the wavelengths of spectrally resolved lines of absorption and emission of visible light. Importantly for thermal physics, he also observed that bright lines or dark lines were apparent depending on the temperature difference between emitter and absorber.

Kirchhoff then went on to consider some bodies that emit and absorb heat radiation, in an opaque enclosure or cavity, in equilibrium at a temperature .

Here is used a notation different from Kirchhoff&#x27;s. Here, the emitting power denotes a dimensioned quantity, the total radiation emitted by a body labeled by index at temperature . The total absorption ratio of that body is dimensionless, the ratio of absorbed to incident radiation in the cavity at temperature . (In contrast with Balfour Stewart&#x27;s, Kirchhoff&#x27;s definition of his absorption ratio did not refer in particular to a lamp-black surface as the source of the incident radiation.) Thus the ratio of emitting power to absorptivity is a dimensioned quantity, with the dimensions of emitting power, because is dimensionless. Also here the wavelength-specific emitting power of the body at temperature is denoted by and the wavelength-specific absorption ratio by . Again, the ratio of emitting power to absorptivity is a dimensioned quantity, with the dimensions of emitting power.

In a second report made in 1859, Kirchhoff announced a new general principle or law for which he offered a theoretical and mathematical proof, though he did not offer quantitative measurements of radiation powers. His theoretical proof was and still is considered by some writers to be invalid. His principle, however, has endured: it was that for heat rays of the same wavelength, in equilibrium at a given temperature, the wavelength-specific ratio of emitting power to absorptivity has one and the same common value for all bodies that emit and absorb at that wavelength. In symbols, the law stated that the wavelength-specific ratio has one and the same value for all bodies. In this report there was no mention of black bodies.

In 1860, still not knowing of Stewart&#x27;s measurements for selected qualities of radiation, Kirchhoff pointed out that it was long established experimentally that for total heat radiation emitted and absorbed by a body in equilibrium, the dimensioned total radiation ratio has one and the same value common to all bodies. Again without measurements of radiative powers or other new experimental data, Kirchhoff then offered a fresh theoretical proof of his new principle of the universality of the value of the wavelength-specific ratio at thermal equilibrium. His fresh theoretical proof was and still is considered by some writers to be invalid.

But more importantly, it relied on a new theoretical postulate of &quot;perfectly black bodies,&quot; which is the reason why one speaks of Kirchhoff&#x27;s law. Such black bodies showed complete absorption in their infinitely thin most superficial surface. They correspond to Balfour Stewart&#x27;s reference bodies, with internal radiation, coated with lamp-black. They were not the more realistic perfectly black bodies later considered by Planck. Planck&#x27;s black bodies radiated and absorbed only by the material in their interiors; their interfaces with contiguous media were only mathematical surfaces, capable neither of absorption nor emission, but only of reflecting and transmitting with refraction.

Kirchhoff&#x27;s proof considered an arbitrary non-ideal body labeled as well as various perfect black bodies labeled . It required that the bodies be kept in a cavity in thermal equilibrium at temperature . His proof intended to show that the ratio was independent of the nature of the non-ideal body, however partly transparent or partly reflective it was.

His proof first argued that for wavelength and at temperature , at thermal equilibrium, all perfectly black bodies of the same size and shape have the one and the same common value of emissive power , with the dimensions of power. His proof noted that the dimensionless wavelength-specific absorptivity of a perfectly black body is by definition exactly 1. Then for a perfectly black body, the wavelength-specific ratio of emissive power to absorptivity is again just , with the dimensions of power. Kirchhoff considered thermal equilibrium with the arbitrary non-ideal body, and with a perfectly black body of the same size and shape, in place in his cavity in equilibrium at temperature . He argued that the flows of heat radiation must be the same in each case. Thus he argued that at thermal equilibrium the ratio was equal to , which may now be denoted . is a continuous function, dependent only on at fixed temperature , and an increasing function of at fixed wavelength . It vanishes at low temperatures for visible wavelengths, which does not depend on the nature of the arbitrary non-ideal body (Geometrical factors, taken into detailed account by Kirchhoff, have been ignored in the foregoing).

Thus Kirchhoff&#x27;s law of thermal radiation can be stated: &quot;For any material at all, radiating and absorbing in thermodynamic equilibrium at any given temperature , for every wavelength , the ratio of emissive power to absorptivity has one universal value, which is characteristic of a perfect black body, and is an emissive power which we here represent by .&quot; (For our notation , Kirchhoff&#x27;s original notation was simply .)

Kirchhoff announced that the determination of the function was a problem of the highest importance, though he recognized that there would be experimental difficulties to be overcome. He supposed that like other functions that do not depend on the properties of individual bodies, it would be a simple function. Occasionally by historians that function has been called &quot;Kirchhoff&#x27;s (emission, universal) function,&quot; though its precise mathematical form would not be known for another forty years, till it was discovered by Planck in 1900. The theoretical proof for Kirchhoff&#x27;s universality principle was worked on and debated by various physicists over the same time, and later. Kirchhoff stated later in 1860 that his theoretical proof was better than Balfour Stewart&#x27;s, and in some respects it was so. Kirchhoff&#x27;s 1860 paper did not mention the second law of thermodynamics, and of course did not mention the concept of entropy which had not at that time been established. In a more considered account in a book in 1862, Kirchhoff mentioned the connection of his law with Carnot&#x27;s principle, which is a form of the second law.

According to Helge Kragh, &quot;Quantum theory owes its origin to the study of thermal radiation, in particular to the &quot;blackbody&quot; radiation that Robert Kirchhoff had first defined in 1859–1860.&quot;

==Doppler effect==

The relativistic Doppler effect causes a shift in the frequency &quot;f&quot; of light originating from a source that is moving in relation to the observer, so that the wave is observed to have frequency &quot;f&quot;&#x27;:
formula_55
where &quot;v&quot; is the velocity of the source in the observer&#x27;s rest frame, &quot;θ&quot; is the angle between the velocity vector and the observer-source direction measured in the reference frame of the source, and &quot;c&quot; is the speed of light. This can be simplified for the special cases of objects moving directly towards (&quot;θ&quot; = π) or away (&quot;θ&quot; = 0) from the observer, and for speeds much less than &quot;c&quot;.

Through Planck&#x27;s law the temperature spectrum of a black body is proportionally related to the frequency of light and one may substitute the temperature (&quot;T&quot;) for the frequency in this equation.

For the case of a source moving directly towards or away from the observer, this reduces to
formula_56
Here &quot;v&quot; &gt; 0 indicates a receding source, and &quot;v&quot; &lt; 0 indicates an approaching source.

This is an important effect in astronomy, where the velocities of stars and galaxies can reach significant fractions of &quot;c&quot;. An example is found in the cosmic microwave background radiation, which exhibits a dipole anisotropy from the Earth&#x27;s motion relative to this blackbody radiation field.

<doc id="726761" wikidata="Q810773" url="?curid=726761" title="Bath &amp; Body Works">
<text>Bath &amp; Body Works, LLC. is an American retail store chain that sells soaps, lotions, fragrances, and candles. It was founded in 1990 in New Albany, Ohio and has since expanded across six continents. In 1997, it became the largest bath shop chain in the United States.

==History==
Bath &amp; Body Works was founded in 1990 in New Albany, Ohio as the beauty line for Express, Inc. The company&#x27;s first store opened in a Cambridge, Massachusetts mall in September 1990. In 1991, the Body Shop sued Bath &amp; Body Works, resulting in Bath &amp; Body Works rebranding itself. The brand created a mascot named Kate who serves as a founding figure, with the store layout being modeled as her country house. In 1997, a secondary brand known as Bath &amp; Body Works at Home was launched. Two years later, the company launched the White Barn Candle Company, a division specializing in the sale of scented candles.

Bath &amp; Body Works launched both a seasonal catalog and a website in 2006. In November 2006, the company launched its first television commercial advertisement. Net sales as of January 28, 2006 were $2.3 billion, significantly higher than all other L Brands companies other than Victoria&#x27;s Secret.

In July 2008, the company announced that it was opening six locations in Canada. With the company acquiring Canadian-based La Senza, they felt it was the opportunity to move into a growing Canadian market, with The Body Shop being its main competition.

Bath &amp; Body Works operates more than 1,900 stores. In October 2010, it opened its first stores outside of North America in Kuwait, by the franchise giant M. H. Alshaya Co.

<text>The Clarion River is a tributary of the Allegheny River, approximately 110 mi (177 km) long, in west central Pennsylvania in the United States. It drains a rugged area of the Allegheny Plateau in the Ohio River watershed, flowing through narrow serpentine valleys and hardwood forests.

== Course ==

The river is formed at Johnsonburg in central Elk County by the confluence of its East and West Branches. The East Branch, approximately 15 mi (24 km) long, rises in northeastern Elk County and flows southwest through East Branch Clarion River Lake to join the West Branch. The river flows generally west-southwest across western Pennsylvania in a tight meandering course past Ridgway and Clarion. It joins the Allegheny from the east in western Clarion County approximately 5 mi (8 km) south of Emlenton.

The Clarion is a designated part of the National Wild and Scenic River program.

==Discharges==

== History ==
Before 1817, the Clarion River was more commonly called &quot;Tobeco,&quot; likely a corruption of &quot;Tuppeek-hanne&quot;, meaning the stream that flows from a large spring. The French explorers named the river Rivière au Fiel. Settlers called it the Toby or Stump Creek as early as 1809. The name Clarion was given by surveyor Daniel Stanard in 1817, who said the water sounded like a distant clarion.

At the end of the 19th century and into the beginning of the 20th century, much of what is now the Allegheny National Forest and surrounding areas were deforested, in part to make way for the oil boom that followed Edwin Drake&#x27;s discovery of oil near Titusville on August 27, 1859, but also for wood chemicals. Bark was in especially high demand for local tanneries that produced prodigious amounts of leather. This deforestation significantly degraded the watershed of the upper Allegheny in general, leading to floods downstream (particularly in Pittsburgh), and eventually to the declaration of the national forest in 1923, but in the case of the Clarion River, run-off from tanneries compounded the problem, as did acid mine drainage. 
 The Clarion was an important part of the timber industry, allowing timber to be transported downstream to the Allegheny, then the Ohio, and ultimately the Mississippi. The Clarion River came to be Pennsylvania&#x27;s most polluted waterway.

The regrowth of the forest did much to help restore the Clarion River, as well as a major cleaning effort in the 1980s. Today, the river is used for fishing, canoeing, and other recreational activities, and runs through extensive wildlife and forest areas, including a inventoried roadless area that has been proposed as a national wilderness area. In 1996, a stretch of the Clarion River was designated a National Wild &amp; Scenic River. The bridge at Cooksburg is in Clarion County in its western portion, passes through a narrow spike of Forest County in its middle, and is in Jefferson County at its east end.

USS Clarion River (LSM(R)-409) was an LSM(R)-401-class medium-type landing ship (LSM) built for the United States Navy during World War II.

<doc id="726765" wikidata="Q585222" url="?curid=726765" title="Very (Pet Shop Boys album)">
<text>Very is the fifth studio album by English synth-pop duo Pet Shop Boys, released on 27 September 1993 by Parlophone, nearly three years after the duo&#x27;s previous studio album, &quot;Behaviour&quot;, and following the compilation album &quot;&quot;. It is the only Pet Shop Boys album to reach number one on the UK Albums Chart, and it produced two top ten singles, &quot;Can You Forgive Her?&quot; and &quot;Go West&quot;. &quot;Very&quot; exhibits one of many turning points the Pet Shop Boys would make to their music, shifting from the subdued electronic pop of &quot;Behaviour&quot; to richly instrumented dance arrangements. The content and lyrics led to &quot;Very&quot; being called their &quot;coming-out&quot; album, since it was during this time that Neil Tennant had publicly discussed his long-rumoured homosexuality.

==Background and release==

Pet Shop Boys made &quot;Very&quot; in reaction to their previous album &quot;Behaviour&quot;, which was critically well-received but not as commercially successful as their earlier releases. In particular, &quot;Being Boring&quot;, which the duo had considered one of their strongest tracks, was their least successful single at the time, peaking at number 20 on the UK charts. In the United States, their 1991 Performance Tour initially received mixed reviews and did not improve the ranking of &quot;Behaviour&quot;, which only reached 45 on the US Billboard 200. Journalist and close friend of the duo Chris Heath documented the American leg of the tour in his book &quot;Pet Shop Boys Versus America&quot;, noting Chris Lowe&#x27;s comment, &quot;We should write another good dance album, write &quot;Behaviour&quot; off as a tax loss&quot;.

After taking a break in 1992, Pet Shop Boys set out to make an uplifting, dance-pop album in contrast to the style of &quot;Behaviour&quot;. They worked on songs at Lowe&#x27;s home studio and finished them at Sarm West. Pet Shop Boys produced &quot;Very&quot; themselves, with mixing and additional production by Stephen Hague. The title was meant to convey that the album was &#x27;very Pet Shop Boys&#x27;, but a different Pet Shop Boys. EMI representative Tony Wadsworth recalled in the 2006 documentary &quot;Pet Shop Boys: A Life In Pop&quot; that when the record label first heard the songs on &quot;Very&quot;, &quot;the smiles lit up the room because it was so obviously commercial yet still very high quality&quot;. 

To promote &quot;Very&quot;, the duo shed their naturalistic image and adopted a new look, creating an artificial, cartoonish world with visuals designed by David Fielding. This idea was a reaction against the grunge movement of the time, and it incorporated the growing popularity of video games. They wore surreal costumes, like the orange jumpsuits with tall dunce caps for &quot;Can You Forgive Her?&quot;, and their music videos, directed by Howard Greenhalgh, made use of the CGI available at the time.

To date, &quot;Very&quot; is the Pet Shop Boys&#x27; most commercially successful album in the UK; it reached number one on the UK Albums Chart shortly after its release. In addition, all singles released from the album entered the top 20 of the UK Singles Chart, including &quot;Go West&quot;, which remains one of the duo&#x27;s highest-charting singles. In the United States, &quot;Very&quot; debuted at number 20 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 album chart, an improvement on &quot;Behaviour&quot;. The singles failed to chart on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 but performed better on the dance charts. This was seen partly as a result of the rise of grunge and alternative rock on American radio.

===&quot;Very Relentless&quot;===
A limited-edition double album, &quot;Very Relentless&quot;, was released simultaneously. The bonus disc, &quot;Relentless&quot;, contains six tracks that are more experimental and instrumental. There were plans to expand upon &quot;Relentless&quot; in 1994 by releasing the six tracks along with others, making a full dance album, but this evolved into &quot;Disco 2&quot;. The six tracks were not released elsewhere until &quot;Relentless&quot; was remastered and reissued as a standalone EP in 2023, though the original version of &quot;Forever in Love&quot; is found on &quot;Very: Further Listening 1992–1994&quot;. &quot;Forever in Love&quot; uses the same sample as &quot;One Love&quot; by The Prodigy, &quot;Arabic Chant (Allah)&quot; from the Zero-G sample library compilation &quot;Datafile One&quot;.

===Other releases===
&quot;Very&quot; was re-released on 3 July 2001 as &quot;Very: Further Listening 1992–1994&quot;. The reissue was digitally remastered and includes a second disc featuring B-sides and previously unreleased material. A remastered single-disc edition of &quot;Very&quot;, containing only the 12 original tracks, was released in 2009. In 2018, a newly remastered edition of &quot;Very: Further Listening 1992–1994&quot; was released, with the same contents as the 2001 edition.

===Packaging===
The original release of &quot;Very&quot; was packaged in a unique orange jewel case with raised bumps (sometimes unofficially described as the Lego case), designed by Daniel Weil of Pentagram in London. &quot;Very Relentless&quot; was similarly unique, with the two CDs housed in card sleeves (&quot;Very&quot; in orange and &quot;Relentless&quot; in pink) with both of these housed in a translucent rubber case with raised bumps.

The case for &quot;Very&quot; was featured in the 1995 Museum of Modern Art (MoMA) exhibition &quot;Mutant Materials in Contemporary Design.&quot;

The album was reissued in 1996 in a standard jewel case with a new sleeve showing an image of the original case.

==Critical reception==
Writing for &quot;NME&quot;, David Quantick deemed &quot;Very&quot; &quot;brilliant from start to finish&quot; and &quot;as moving and moved as any other Pet Shop Boys album, just more obviously so&quot;, noting a shift from the &quot;melancholy&quot; of &quot;Behaviour&quot; towards &quot;a sense of, gulp, happiness.&quot; In &quot;Select&quot;, Stuart Maconie speculated that the album&#x27;s &quot;more lively&quot; musical direction may have been motivated by the &quot;muted&quot; reception to &quot;Behaviour&quot;, and commented that &quot;&quot;Very&quot;″s beauty lies in the formidable yet effortless plate-spinning trick that lets gorgeous and vibrant pop tunes co-exist with rich, strange and complex conceits.&quot; David Bennun of &quot;Melody Maker&quot; noted that, after the &quot;muted&quot; and &quot;distressingly grown up&quot; sound of &quot;Behaviour&quot;, &quot;Very&quot; contains &quot;track after track, dizzy with strings and brass, of the purest, most intelligent and, crucially, poppiest pop.&quot; Mat Snow of &quot;Q&quot;, meanwhile, wrote that &quot;Very&quot; confirms the Pet Shop Boys as &quot;a group so tightly focused on its strengths to the exclusion of any meaningful experiment that it drives a coach and horses through the First Commandment of Pop, namely &#x27;Thou Shalt Explore a New Direction on Every Album&#x27;.&quot;

&quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; critic Greg Kot opined that &quot;&quot;Very&quot; qualifies as terrific pop on the strength of its music alone&quot;, and that &quot;as its gay worldview unfolds—unapologetic yet unassuming, humorous yet touching, political yet personal—&quot;Very&quot; takes on the dimensions of a classic.&quot; J. D. Considine, reviewing &quot;Very&quot; for &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, highlighted the social commentary and &quot;mixed emotions&quot; in its songs, concluding that &quot;it&#x27;s that sort of depth that makes &quot;Very&quot; worth hearing again and again.&quot; &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot;″s Greg Sandow considered the album &quot;very understated musically&quot; but also &quot;very deeply felt&quot;, while &quot;The Village Voice&quot;″s Robert Christgau found that Tennant&#x27;s lyrics showed a newfound romantic sincerity: &quot;Convinced cornballs may still find his emotions attenuated, but I say the production values suit the tumult in his heart and the melodies the sweetness in his soul.&quot; Less impressed was Dennis Hunt of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;, who said that &quot;Very&quot; &quot;is listenable and danceable, but overall it sounds as if their creativity has petered out—they&#x27;re recycling these days rather than creating.&quot;

In the 2004 &quot;Rolling Stone Album Guide&quot;, Tom Hull noted that &quot;Very&quot; was released to more uniformly positive reviews from critics than &quot;Behaviour&quot;, which he attributed to its more uptempo sound and &quot;unusually direct&quot; love songs, &quot;with most making more sense gay than not.&quot; AllMusic&#x27;s Stephen Thomas Erlewine stated in retrospect that &quot;&quot;Very&quot; is one of their very best records, expertly weaving between the tongue-in-cheek humor of &#x27;I Wouldn&#x27;t Normally Do This Kind of Thing,&#x27; the quietly shocking &#x27;Can You Forgive Her?,&#x27; and the bizarrely moving cover of the Village People&#x27;s &#x27;Go West.&#x27;&quot;

In June 2000, &quot;Q&quot; placed &quot;Very&quot; at number 91 on its list of &quot;The 100 Greatest British Albums Ever&quot;. The album was also included in the book &quot;1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die&quot;.

<doc id="726770" wikidata="Q7614956" url="?curid=726770" title="Steven Lang (character)">
<text>Steven Lang (sometimes spelled Stephen Lang) is a supervillain appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. He is a manufacturer of the mutant-hunting Sentinels. He first appeared in &quot;The X-Men&quot; #96 (December 1975).

==Fictional character biography==
Dr. Steven Lang is a pioneer in the field of robotics and genetic mutation who hates mutants. An employee of the U.S. government, he is placed in charge of a federal investigation into the origin of genetic mutation. He plans to use his talents to create an army of mutant hunting robots to kill all mutants. To this end, he seeks to get the government to endorse and financially support his operations.

Lang begins by targeting mutant criminals, such as Mesmero. He claims possession of Bolivar Trask&#x27;s wrecked Sentinel base&#x27;s resources, and is backed by Ned Buckman and the &quot;Council of the Chosen&quot;, the secret group in control of the New York Branch of the Hellfire Club prior to Sebastian Shaw&#x27;s takeover.

Lang desires to defeat his main targets, the X-Men, so he creates the &quot;X-Sentinels&quot;, android doubles of Professor X and the original X-Men. However, his androids manage only inferior imitations of the X-Men&#x27;s powers, and are easily defeated by the real X-Men. Jean Grey then telekinetically forces Lang to crash his mini-gunship into a wall-screen. He is left in a coma with severe brain damage. 

Afterwards, Lang&#x27;s brain is used as a template for the minds of two Sentinels, Master Mold and Conscience, both of whom are destroyed in an attempt to release a virus which would have killed all mutants and roughly 97% of normal humans on Earth.

Years later, Lang returns as a member of the Phalanx, a group of humans who had been transformed into techno-organic human-alien hybrids. The transformation process restores Lang&#x27;s mind, and he becomes the Phalanx&#x27;s leader. Lang is the only one within the Phalanx to retain his individual human identity, possibly due to the brain damage. While he is ardent in his desire to see mutants eradicated, he comes to realize the Phalanx are a danger to humans as well. He conspires with the X-Men to destroy the Phalanx citadel on Earth, following which he is dragged to his apparent death by his lieutenant Cameron Hodge.

Lang&#x27;s corpse is exhumed by the Purifiers and reanimated by Bastion using Technarch. He joins a group formed by the foremost anti-mutant leaders under Bastion&#x27;s control. During the &quot;Second Coming&quot; storyline, Lang and Graydon Creed are killed by Hope Summers.

==Powers and abilities==
As a normal human being, Stephen Lang had no superhuman powers. However, he was a genius and pioneer in the field of robotics, with adequate financial resources to fund his operations.

As a member of the Phalanx, he had all of the characteristics of a techno-organic life form: enhanced strength, durability, and agility, ability to re-shape corporeal form at will, and to infect other beings with the techno-organic virus and control infected beings.

==Other versions==
In the 2009-2010 miniseries &quot;X-Men Noir&quot;, Lang is a fictional character and lead for Bolivar Trask&#x27;s pulp sci-fi series, &quot;The Sentinels&quot;, who seeks to protect humanity from mutants.

==In other media==
General William Kincaid (a character similar to Steven Lang) appears in &quot;X-Men Legends&quot;, voiced by John DiMaggio. Under his campaign &quot;Operation Vigilance&quot;, he planned to use the Graviton metal to crash Asteroid M into New York to blame the deaths and destruction on mutants for revenge. He later utilized his &quot;Master Mold Armor&quot; hidden inside Asteroid M but was defeated and arrested.

<doc id="726773" wikidata="Q472537" url="?curid=726773" title="Togiola Tulafono">
<text>Togiola Talalelei A. Tulafono (born February 28, 1947) is an American Samoan politician and lawyer who served as the sixth governor of American Samoa. He is a member of the Democratic Party. He had previously served as the seventh lieutenant governor.

Tulafono was lieutenant governor when, on March 26, 2003, Governor Tauese Pita Fiti Sunia died. He then became acting governor and officially became governor on April 7, 2003. He was elected to a full 4-year term in the November 2004 gubernatorial elections and was re-elected in the November 2008 gubernatorial election.

Tulafono did not run for governor in 2012 as he was term-limited and could not seek a third consecutive term. He was an unsuccessful candidate for American Samoa&#x27;s at-large congressional district in 2014.

== Biography ==
===Early life===
Togiola T. A. Tulafono was born on February 28, 1947, in Aunu&#x27;u Island, American Samoa.

Tulafono was educated in Samoa, attending elementary school in Autu&#x27;u and Samoana High School.
He attended Chadron State College in the United States, where he earned bachelor&#x27;s degrees in both political science and sociology in 1970. He received a doctor of laws degree from the Washburn University School of Law in Topeka, Kansas, in 1975.

Tulafono has served as a deacon of the Congregational Christian Church in Sa&#x27;ilele, American Samoa, for over 25 years.

=== Career ===

After college, Tulafono worked as a legal assistant at American Samoa&#x27;s Attorney General&#x27;s Office and as an administrative assistant for the Secretary of Samoan Affairs. He spent two years each working as a private practice attorney and as a vice president for South Pacific Island Airways during the late 1970s.

Tulafono was appointed as a district court judge in 1978 and then to the American Samoa Senate in 1980. After serving one term in the upper house for Sa&#x27;Ole County, he reentered law practice, but then ran again successfully for a Senate seat in 1989. However, he was later elected to the American Samoa Senate for Sua County for eight years. He also chaired the board of directors for the American Samoa Power Authority and was the first chairman of the Board of Higher Education.

Tulafono further co-chaired the South Pacific Mini Games committee in 1997 when American Samoa hosted the games. He later co-chaired the American Samoa Centennial Committee in 2000, which was formed to commemorate the 100th anniversary of American Samoa becoming a territorial possession of the United States.

Tulafono presently serves as vice chairman of the territorial church general assembly of American Samoa as of 2008.

After his term as governor ended, Tulafono ran for U.S. Delegate for American Samoa&#x27;s at-large congressional district for the 2014 elections, but he lost at third place with 11% of the vote.

== Governor of American Samoa ==
Tulafono was sworn in as the Lieutenant Governor of American Samoa under Governor Tauese Sunia on January 3, 1997. Sunia and Tulafono were re-elected in 2000 and sworn into their second terms in office on January 3, 2001.

Tulafono remained lieutenant governor until Sunia&#x27;s sudden death from a heart attack on March 26, 2003. Tulafono became acting governor until he was formally sworn into office as Governor of American Samoa on April 7, 2003.

In the first round of elections on November 2, 2004, Tulafono received 48.4% of the vote. In the second round on November 16, Tulafono defeated Afoa Moega Lutu, who had run against him for the position of lieutenant governor in 2000, by a vote of 56%-44%. As governor, Tulafano is a member of the National Governors Association and the Democratic Governors Association.

Tulafono took part in endorsing Senator Hillary Clinton for President of the United States during the 2008 presidential primaries and the American Samoa Democratic caucuses, 2008 and became the national co-chair of Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders for Hillary.

It was under Tulafono&#x27;s leadership that American Samoa became, in November 2011, a founding member of the Polynesian Leaders Group, a regional grouping intended to cooperate on a variety of issues including culture and language, education, responses to climate change, and trade and investment.

===The dispute with Hawaiian Airlines===
In July 2006, Governor Tulafono issued a mandate to Hawaiian Airlines, giving the airline ninety days to cease service to Pago Pago International Airport in Pago Pago. The carrier, which offers the only service to American Samoa (beside commuter flights to Apia, in the country of Samoa), from its hub in Honolulu, was accused of predatory pricing practices and ethnic harassment by the governor.

In August 2006, the FAA stated in an official letter to the governor that the territory must continue to allow Hawaiian Airlines to fly the Honolulu-Pago Pago route or risk losing U.S. financial assistance.

=== 2008 gubernatorial election ===
Governor Togiola Tulafono and Lieutenant Governor Ipulasi Aitofele Sunia announced their joint reelection campaign on May 10, 2008, at the Tradewinds Hotel in Tafuna. The 2008 American Samoa gubernatorial election took place on November 4, 2008. Governor Tulafono and Lieutenant Governor Sunia received 41.1% of the vote, challengers Utu Abe Malae and Nua Mailo Saoluaga received 31.4%, and Afoa Leulumoega Lutu and Velega Savali received 26.8 percent. Because no candidate exceeded 50% of the vote, a runoff election was held between the top two candidates, Tulafono and Utu Abe Malae on November 18, 2008, which Tulafono won.

===Independence discussion===

In 2012, both the Governor and American Samoa&#x27;s delegate to the US Congress called for the populace to consider a move towards autonomy if not independence, to a mixed response.

<text>Tauese Tuailemafua Pita Fiti Sunia (August 29, 1941 – March 26, 2003) was an American Samoan politician who served as the fifth governor of American Samoa from 1997 until his death in 2003. He was the second governor of American Samoa to die in office; Warren Terhune was the first.

==Career==
Sunia&#x27;s career in public service began in the education sector, where he held various administrative roles, including Deputy Director of the American Samoa Department of Education from 1972 to 1974. In 1974, he became the first vice president of the newly established American Samoa Community College, and later served as the Director of the Department of Education from 1984 to 1988. His political career began in 1992 when he was elected as Lieutenant Governor on the Democratic ticket alongside A. P. Lutali.

Sunia was a member of the Democratic Party. He won the election of 1996 in a close runoff with Lealaifuaneva Peter Reid (51%-48%). The runoff was caused by a split in the Democratic Party in American Samoa between Sunia and incumbent governor Lutali Aifili Paulo Lauvao, who received third place, with no candidate gaining a majority. Sunia won another close victory against Reid in the 2000 election, 50%–48%, with no runoff. The results were contested by his opponent, Peter Reid, but were eventually upheld by the courts.

During Sunia&#x27;s term of office a protest was issued against Samoa, formerly named Western Samoa, for changing its official name to the shorter form. The official view in American Samoa is that such a form detracts from the Samoan identity of American Samoa, and public officials and documents from American Samoa still refer to Samoa as &quot;Western Samoa&quot;.

In 1997, he was awarded an honorary doctorate of humane letters by Golden Gate University.

== Personal life ==
Sunia married Fagaoalii Satele Sunia in 1969. They moved back to American Samoa in 1981 after living in Hawaii and settled in Leone, American Samoa.

Tauese Sunia graduated from Samoana High School and attended Kearney State Teachers&#x27; College in Nebraska, where he later taught. Returning to American Samoa in 1965, he taught Government and History at Leone High School and on television. In 1967, he was hired by the American Samoa Department of Education. From 1969-1970, he served one term in the American Samoa House of Representatives, representing the first district. In 1974, he assisted the President of the American Samoa Community College with its relocation from Utulei to Mapusagafou. In 1980, Sunia earned a master&#x27;s degree from the University of Hawai&#x27;i. He returned to American Samoa to support A. P. Lutali&#x27;s gubernatorial campaign and was subsequently appointed Director of Education by Governor Lutali. In 1992, he joined Lutali’s administration as Lieutenant Governor of American Samoa in 1993. Sunia was awarded the High Orator title Tauese of the village of Taʻū in 1984. He also served as chairman of the Annual General Assembly of the Christian Congregational Church in 1996, 1998, and 2000.

== Death ==
Sunia died during his second term, on March 26, 2003, while on a flight to Hawaii to receive medical treatment, becoming only the second governor of American Samoa (after Warren Terhune), and the first civilian one, to die in office. In 2012, the Utulei Convention Center was remodeled and renamed for Sunia. His wife, Fagaoalii Satele Sunia, died on September 5, 2015.

<doc id="726788" wikidata="Q2818903" url="?curid=726788" title="A. P. Lutali">
<text>Aifili Paulo Lauvao (December 24, 1919 – August 1, 2002), was twice governor of American Samoa (1985–1989, 1993–1997). The founder of the U.S territory&#x27;s Democratic Party, he had a long career in the legislature and the judiciary in American Samoa.

Governor Lutali was a preservationist who wanted to preserve large areas of the territory&#x27;s nature. Lutali also worked to preserve American Samoa&#x27;s ancient sites and historical buildings. He revitalized the Historic Preservation Office.

Lutali maintained a leading role in the American Samoa Democratic Party through the years.

==Biography==

===Education===
From 1951 to 1954, Lutali served as administrative supervisor for public schools. He was chairman of the Samoan Culture Curriculum Committee from 1952 to 1954, a member of the Board of Education from 1955 to 1958, and chairman of the first American Samoa Board of Higher Education, which established the American Samoa Community College, Mapusaga, in 1974. He was admitted to practice in the High Court of American Samoa in 1954 and was one of the founders of the American Samoa Bar Association in 1972. He was appointed a permanent judge of the high court in 1972, and later as chief judge of the Lands and Titles Division.

===Political career===
Lutali was elected to the American Samoa House of Representatives in 1955 and served as its speaker in 1955–58. He was a member of the 1966 Constitutional Convention and was American Samoa&#x27;s Delegate to Congress from 1975 to 1979. He was elected to the American Samoa Senate in 1977 and was elected its president in his first year, serving in the senate concurrent to his four-year term as delegate. He ran unsuccessfully for Governor in the 1977 American Samoan gubernatorial election, losing to Peter Tali Coleman. In 1978 he announced he would not seek another term as delegate.

He was first elected governor of American Samoa in 1984 and lost his bid for a second term in 1988. In 1989, he was returned by his district (Sa&#x27;ole) to the Senate where he served as chairman of the Committee on Government Operations until he was again elected governor in 1992. Lutali played a key role in working with Samoan chiefs and the U.S. Congress to create the 50th national park of the United States in American Samoa. He lost his bid for a third term as governor in the 1996 elections.

===Death===
Lutali suffered a stroke and was admitted to LBJ Medical Center. He died on August 1, 2002.

===Legacy===
Lutali&#x27;s political career began in 1953 when he was elected to the Saʻole County seat in the first ever elected American Samoa House of Representatives (3rd Legislature). He was a signatory of the first American Samoa Constitution in 1960 and later chaired the 1966 Constitutional Convention, which produced the current 1967 Revised Constitution. His administration is remembered for its initiatives in public health, youth development, and environmental protection, including his strong opposition to nuclear testing in the Pacific region. As Governor, he initiated several private self-help business programs. He was instrumental in establishing Samoana High School, the first high school in American Samoa, in 1946. His commitment to education extended to higher learning; he chaired the first American Samoa Board of Higher Education, leading to the creation of the American Samoa Community College in 1974. Two years later, in 1976, he founded the American Samoa Democratic Party.

He was involved in the establishment of the American Samoa Power Authority (ASPA) and played a significant role in the creation of the National Park of American Samoa. His efforts contributed to the modernization of public services and the preservation of the territory&#x27;s natural resources. He was a founding member of the American Samoa Bar Association. After his defeat in the 1996 gubernatorial election, Lutali continued to serve in the American Samoa Senate, where he was involved in various community projects, including the construction of the Senior Citizen Center that now bears his name. In recognition of his lifelong service, he received an Outstanding Achievement Award from the government in 1997.

The A. P. Lutali Elementary School on the island of Aunu&#x27;u is named in his honor. The A P Lutali Executive Office Building in Utulei is also named after him.

<doc id="726795" wikidata="Q1641580" url="?curid=726795" title="H. Rex Lee">
<text>Hyrum Rex Lee (April 8, 1910 – July 26, 2001) was an American government employee and diplomat who was the last unelected governor of American Samoa. Lee served as governor from 1961 to 1967, and again briefly from 1977 to 1978. Governor Lee&#x27;s administration from 1961 to 1967 saw the establishment of schools, a new airport, roads, Rainmaker Hotel, an educational television system, new harbor facilities, and a fisheries cannery. Tourism boomed and there was an increasing acceptance of Western institutions, lifestyles, and ideas. Many residents relocated to California and Hawai&#x27;i or joined the U.S. Armed Forces.

Born in Rigby, Idaho, Lee studied agricultural science before working as an economist with the Resettlement Administration. He was then employed by the War Relocation Authority and became assistant chief of the Office of Territories in 1946, until 1950. That year he was appointed as associate (later becoming deputy) commissioner of the Bureau of Indian Affairs, where he was noted for his skills as a congressional liaison. In 1961, he was appointed as Governor of American Samoa as part of the incoming Kennedy administration, serving until 1967.

Lee was seen as a successful administrator by both the Kennedy and Johnson administrations. Following his service in American Samoa, he was appointed to the Federal Communications Commission, where he promoted educational television. He retired in 1973, continuing to promote educational television, but served another term as Governor of American Samoa until the first-ever elected governor assumed office in January 1978.

== Early life and education ==
Lee was born in Rigby on April 8, 1910. His parents had lived in Rigby for their whole lives. He attended the public schools of Jefferson County, Idaho, before studying a bachelor&#x27;s degree in agricultural science at the University of Idaho, graduating in 1936. In 1964, the university gave him an honorary law degree.

== Early career ==
Lee&#x27;s entered public service after finishing his degree, and from June 1936 to July 1937, he worked as an economist with the United States Department of Agriculture&#x27;s Resettlement Administration in Moscow, Idaho. He then joined the University of Idaho Extension Service and served a year as a county assistant agent in Pocatello. From November 1938 to June 1946, he worked in the War Relocation Authority that oversaw the internment of Japanese Americans during World War II. Many Japanese Americans lived on the West Coast at this time. His service included overseeing the Division of Relocation and Evacuee Property. As the internment period began to end in 1945, Lee&#x27;s job was largely to find temporary housing for Japanese Americans, as many of the soldiers&#x27; families had moved to California towards the end of the war, resulting in a lack of available accommodation.

In 1946, Lee transferred to the United States Department of the Interior as assistant chief of the Office of Territories. During his time there, he played a key role in arranging the transfer of American Samoa from Navy to civilian jurisdiction. Lee was a consultant on loan to the United Nations in 1949, and spent three months travelling in the Near East conferring with Arab and Israeli leaders to assist refugees displaced by the Arab–Israeli conflict. Dillon S. Myer, the former director of the War Relocation Authority, had been placed in charge of the Arab Refugee program, and had asked that Lee was assigned to assist him. Lee went on a number of field trips to visit refugee centers in Trans-Jordan, for example in Jericho, Amman, and Jerash.

As Myer was appointed as commissioner of the Department of the Interior&#x27;s Bureau of Indian Affairs in the spring of 1950, the same day he began work, it was agreed that Lee would move from the Office of Territories to become associate commissioner of the Bureau, replacing William Zimmerman. Lee had worked closely with Congressional committees in his role at the Office of Territories, and so was a valuable asset. The day after Myers&#x27; appointment, Lee was able to dissuade Senator Hugh A. Butler of Nebraska from campaigning against his appointment.

Lee was later described as being &quot;better known, probably, than almost anybody else in the Bureau on the Hill, in the Interior Committees, and was rather highly regarded up there by the chairman of the committees&quot;. He was also known for having a good working relationship with Wayne N. Aspinall, the chair of the House Committee on Interior and Insular Affairs. In the transition from Dwight D. Eisenhower&#x27;s administration to John F. Kennedy&#x27;s administration, Lee was effectively in charge of the Bureau, working with John A. Carver Jr., the Assistant Secretary of the Interior for Public Lands Management. This arrangement lasted for several months until Philleo Nash was confirmed as director of the bureau.

== Governorship and later career ==

=== American Samoa ===
It was Carver who suggested a method of selecting the next Governor of American Samoa that avoided accusations of political bias. A panel of three, including Lee, was chosen. Delma H. Nucker was vetoed as a suggestion for being &quot;too Eisenhower&quot;, Hillary A. Tolson, the deputy director of the Park Service, turned it down, and it was only after &quot;much arm twisting&quot; that Lee accepted the role. Lee&#x27;s first term as governor was from May 24, 1961, to July 31, 1967. Concurrently in 1961, US Air Force Major Eric J. Scanlan, a native Samoan, was appointed as government secretary, a role similar to lieutenant governor. Owen Aspinall, the deputy district attorney of Mesa County, Colorado, and son of Lee&#x27;s friend Wayne Aspinall, was appointed as Lee&#x27;s attorney general of American Samoa. By 1963, Aspinall had replaced Scanlan as government secretary, and later succeeded Lee as governor.

Stewart Udall, the United States Secretary of the Interior, said that Lee was appointed as Governor due to his &quot;unique experience and long familiarity in helping to solve&quot; socio-economic problems similar to the ones American Samoa faced. On June 21, 1963, Paramount Chief Tuli Le’iato of Faga’itua was sworn in and installed as the first Secretary of Samoan Affairs by Lee. Under Lee, there were a number of new efforts and programs that took place. He created a cooperative where local Samoans had a share in a new hotel, developed a fishing enterprise that employed local Samoans, increased tourism, by establishing a new airport, harbor facilities, roads and luxury hotels, and also cleaned up the island. Most notably, Lee also launched an educational TV business which was entirely his own conception and execution. Carver described it as &quot;the kind of thing which only Rex Lee could have done&quot;.

The program was funded by $15 million that Michael J. Kirwan, the chairman of the Appropriations Committee for Public Works, had authorized. The main television station that was built was named the Michael J. Kirwan Educational Television Center in his honor. George P. Miller, chairman of the House Committee on Science and Astronautics at the time, expressed some concerns with the program. He said that &quot;they had a hard time getting teachers as it is very expensive to bring teachers from the mainland to Samoa, and having them out in the small communities living with the natives was pretty hard for them&quot;. He noted, however, that the program &quot;became highly successful&quot;.

Lee received the President&#x27;s Award for Distinguished Federal Civilian Service from Lyndon B. Johnson in 1966 who also credited him with turning American Samoa from a &quot;Pacific Slum&quot; to a &quot;showplace for progress&quot;. Udall later said that Lee &quot;turned out to be one of our very best appointments, in my view. He was a bit authoritarian, but I think he did a very good job at Samoa and was really our star performer&quot;. He was the last non-elected governor of the territory. He was instrumental in successfully bringing American Samoa&#x27;s plight to the attention of Congress, and in reforming the infrastructure and educational system.

=== Federal Communications Commission ===
After his term ended in 1967, Lee became the assistant administrator of the US foreign aid program of the United States Department of State. Just over a year later, President Johnson appointed Lee to a seven-year term as a commissioner on the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), which began on October 28, 1968. He served as the commission&#x27;s education commissioner and was also a member of the Telephone and Telegraph Committee. His main focus was exploiting the full potential of telecommunications to improve the educational system in the United States. He has been characterized as a &quot;quiet member&quot; of the FCC who was &quot;rarely flamboyant or controversial&quot;. During his time on the commission, he frequently joined Nicholas Johnson in voting against station purchases in order to avoid media concentration. Alongside Johnson, he was considered on the &quot;liberal wing&quot; of the FCC by &quot;The New York Times&quot;. He retired 18 months before his term expired on December 31, 1973, from &quot;a desire to retire from career service to try something new.&quot; His resignation followed a week after Johnson&#x27;s.

=== Retirement ===
Lee became a visiting professor at San Diego State University following his retirement from the FCC. In 1975, he became founding chairman of the Public Service Satellite Consortium. In his retirement, he helped to establish educational television in South America. On May 28, 1977, Lee was re-appointed as Governor of American Samoa on an interim basis until the first elected governor, Peter Tali Coleman, assumed office in January 1978.

== Personal life ==
Lee died at his home in La Jolla, San Diego, California, on July 26, 2001, at the age of 91. He had five children (three daughters and two sons). He was a friend of entertainment mogul Walt Disney, who visited the Lee family and stayed at their home. His wife, Lillian Lee, died in April 2010 at the age of 97.

In 1963, William C. Brown Jr. (“Puka Bill”) was arrested for threatening to kill Governor Lee and detained for over 48 hours without being informed of the specific charges. Ultimately, the case was dismissed because the government failed to provide due process.

=== Legacy ===
Lee&#x27;s name is memorialized at the Governor H. Rex Lee Auditorium.

<doc id="726796" wikidata="Q3613591" url="?curid=726796" title="Amanda Sefton">
<text>Amanda Sefton (real name Jimaine Szardos) is a fictional character appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. Created by Chris Claremont and Dave Cockrum, the character first appeared in &quot;X-Men&quot; #98 (April 1976). The character has also been known as Daytripper and Magik at various points in her history. She is the foster sister and former lover of superhero Kurt Wagner / Nightcrawler of the X-Men.

==Publication history==
Amanda Sefton debuted in the ninety-eighth issue of the 1976 &quot;X-Men&quot; series, created by Chris Claremont and Dave Cockrum. She later appeared in the 1981 &quot;Uncanny X-Men&quot; series. She appeared in the 1998 &quot;Excalibur&quot; series. She appeared in the 2000 &quot;X-Men: Magik&quot; series, her first solo comic book series, by Dan Abnett, Andy Lanning, and Liam Sharp.

==Fictional character biography==
Jimaine and her mother Margali are &quot;Manouche&quot; witches. When Nightcrawler joined the X-Men, Jimaine eventually followed him to the US, assumed the identity of Amanda Sefton, took a job as a flight attendant, and became Nightcrawler&#x27;s girlfriend. When Margali attacked the X-Men, believing Nightcrawler to have been responsible for the death of Stefan Szardos (her son; Jimaine&#x27;s brother), &quot;Amanda&quot; revealed herself as Jimaine, convinced her mother to let Kurt live, and resumed her on-and-off relationship with him. Their relationship broke apart when Kurt suffered a severe case of self-doubt following an encounter with the Beyonder upon the latter&#x27;s arrival on Earth.

===Daytripper===

Much later, and in need of her magical abilities, Nightcrawler called his former girlfriend Amanda Sefton to aid Excalibur. For dramatic reasons she chose to adopt the codename Daytripper, playing on Kurt&#x27;s codename, and presented herself in a new costume. Once familiarized with the problem at hand, Amanda did the best she could to help Meggan and Rachel Summers locate the lost Captain Britain in the time-stream, but as they made contact, they only achieved to exchange Captain Britain for Rachel, who entered the time-stream in his place to emerge in some distant future.

Following this incident, Kurt and Amanda traveled to Germany, where her mother Margali had been taken captive by D&#x27;Spayre. As Kurt wondered how such a powerful sorceress could be held captive against her will, Daytripper explained that the Winding Way is not only a mystic discipline, but also it functions like a journey with ups and downs. Margali was at a low point and powerless, otherwise D&#x27;Spayre would never have been able to defeat her. The pair rescued their mother and Amanda returned with Kurt to Excalibur.
Back on Muir Island, Amanda was the only one who recognized that the team&#x27;s scientist Rory Campbell was the man destined to become the future mutant hunter Ahab, but she promised him to keep her knowledge secret and offered to be there for him whenever the need would arise.

Around this time she suffered a mystical/telepathic attack on a plane while working a shift under her air hostess job. It involved the fate of the Black Queen.

After Excalibur had been attacked by opposing sorcerers trying to acquire the Soulsword of the deceased Illyana Rasputin, Amanda convinced Shadowcat to give her Magik&#x27;s Soul Sword for safe-keeping. Amanda thought it best to hand the sword over to her mother. Only when it was too late, Amanda realized that she was tricked by her own mother who wanted the Soulsword to kill all those ahead of her on the Winding Path.

Even at her most powerful, Margali wanted more, and she covertly joined the London Hellfire Club, acting as their red Queen. She planned to destroy London and take over Britain. Shortly after helping to defeat her mother and the Hellfire Club, Amanda left Excalibur without even telling Nightcrawler.

It is later revealed it was not Amanda who made that decision, but Margali who had taken over her body. Upon her defeat among the Hellfire Club, Margali was captured by the villain sorcerer Belasco and was tortured in his realm. From his realm, she secretly switched minds with her daughter so that she could win back her freedom. Eventually, Margali, using Amanda&#x27;s body, made her way back to Limbo, where the mother and daughter pair switched back and defeated Belasco with Nightcrawler&#x27;s help. Margali apologized for exposing her daughter to such danger, but then quickly left. Amanda realized that without her mother or Belasco, she was the only person able to take over as Limbo&#x27;s new ruler. It was too dangerous to leave the dimension unguarded, given that several demons could have used it to invade Earth.

===Magik===
At this moment, Amanda thrwarted Belasco N&#x27;Garai’s takeover of Limbo and Earth. She was forced to conceal her identity until of the end of the battle. Those who had not figured out that her new alias was Illyana were informed of this at the end of the battle. Following that, Amanda rallied together the rulers of all other dimensions of Hell to unite them in a common goal: The preservation of Hell.

Amanda has also mastered the ability to magically control the stepping discs of Limbo, just like Belasco did before her, and practiced to wield the Soulsword. During one of Nightcrawler&#x27;s trips to Limbo, Amanda secretly hid the powerful Soulsword in Kurt&#x27;s body, thinking it was safe there since his soul was the purest that she could find. There was a shift in the cosmic balance and powerful forces at work. They were in search of the Soulsword, and shortly after, Amanda was attacked and overpowered by Nightmare. She was rescued by the timely arrival of her Margali. Together, they discovered that Nightmare had been manipulated into attacking them by someone else. Amanda and Margali immediately sought out Nightcrawler to warn him, but upon their arrival, the demon Hive revealed himself and took over the body of Nightcrawler&#x27;s teammate, Wolverine.

Gradually, the demon&#x27;s essence was disrupted by the Soulsword, though not before he revealed that there is a major war coming, and that the entire Szardos family factors very importantly into it.

===Driven out of Limbo===
Amanda resurfaced in &quot;New X-Men&quot; when she plunged out of a dimensional portal in a blast of flaming energy and landed in a small German village. She pleaded, &quot;Help me...someone please...He&#x27;s back.&quot; Amanda was driven out of Limbo after being overwhelmed by an invasion led by Belasco; although she had fought and defeated him in the past, Belasco now appeared more powerful and, without the Soulsword, Amanda was no match.

She assisted New X-Men Hellion and Surge as well as O*N*E Sentinel operative (and former mutant) Lex in finding students who were kidnapped by Belasco. The students were saved due to Illyana Rasputin usurping control of Limbo. Once the heroes were teleported back to Xavier&#x27;s school though, Amanda found Limbo to be sealed off.

While Pixie has stated that she has been approached by both Amanda and Doctor Strange about furthering her magical tutelage when she comes of age, Amanda&#x27;s whereabouts remained unknown for some time, but she was recently mentioned by Cyclops in the aftermath of Second Coming when he was writing her a letter of condolence over the death of Nightcrawler.

===Family reunion===
After Nightcrawler&#x27;s resurrection and some period of readjustment, he sought out Amanda for a romantic reunion, but then Amanda was almost kidnapped by a villain called Trimega. After Nightcrawler and his Bamfs subdued Trimega, he chose to grant Amanda and Margali sanctuary in the Jean Grey School for Higher Learning; but then an army of Trimegas descended upon the school. During the battle, it turned out that Margali was actually Trimega&#x27;s creator and had orchestrated the attack in order to gain knowledge of how to cross into the Afterlife. Armed with that knowledge, Margali opened a portal, whose existence would endanger reality. In order to stop her scheme, Nightcrawler and Amanda attempted to pass the gate, but Nightcrawler&#x27;s voluntary exile from Heaven barred him from entry, stranding Amanda alone in the Void. They met again when Nightcrawler, fatally stabbed in combat by the Crimson Pirates, was intercepted by Amanda at an &quot;interim station&quot; between life and death, who successfully encouraged him—with some assistance from Wolverine and Phoenix—to return to the land of the living.

==Powers and abilities==
Amanda is a sorceress following the path of the Winding Way. Her power changes in its levels, waxing and waning over time, allowing her to summon such powers as teleportation, illusions casting, shape changing, mystical force bolts, hypnotism, and the manipulation of other complex mystical forces.

When she became the Sorceress Supreme of Limbo, Amanda began wielding the powerful Soulsword. While she couldn&#x27;t access the full power of the sword, she could still create and control teleportation energies in the form of &quot;stepping discs&quot;. This allows her to absorb souls of others either permanently or to simply store and transfer, to place and store the sword in absolute nothingness and to retrieve it from whence it came with ease. Like Illyana Rasputin, the more Amanda used the Soulsword, the more mystical Eldritch armor appeared on her body in addition to demonic features such as horns and hooves. The armor deflects or limits attacks, both physical and magical. However, on Earth, Amanda&#x27;s abilities are limited to a different capacity. She has since lost these abilities when Limbo was sealed to her and resumed her normal display of powers.

== Reception ==

=== Critical reception ===
Deirdre Kaye of &quot;Scary Mommy&quot; called Amanda Sefton a &quot;role model&quot; and a &quot;truly heroic&quot; female character. Nitish Vashishtha of &quot;Sportskeeda&quot; ranked Amanda Sefton 7th in their &quot;10 Strongest Marvel Witches&quot; list. Darren Franich of &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; ranked Amanda Sefton 65th in their &quot;Let&#x27;s rank every X-Man ever&quot; list.

&quot;Screen Rant&quot; included Amanda Sefton in their &quot;15 Most Powerful Marvel Magic Users (Who Aren’t Doctor Strange)&quot; list, and in their &quot;10 Best Magical Or Supernatural Heroes Not Yet In The MCU&quot; list. &quot;Comic Book Resources&quot; ranked Amanda Sefton 6th in their &quot;20 Fan-Favorite X-Men Who Aren&#x27;t Even Mutants&quot; list.

The plot twist revealing that Amanda Sefton is really Nightcrawler&#x27;s sister, Jimaine Szardos, received mixed reactions. &quot;Book Riot&quot; described the twist as &quot;the crowning moment of creepy&quot; in their article &quot;The X-Men&#x27;s Love Lives are Messed Up You Guys.&quot;

<doc id="726807" wikidata="Q906107" url="?curid=726807" title="Disco 2">
<text>Disco 2 is the second remix album by English synth-pop duo Pet Shop Boys, released on 12 September 1994 by Parlophone. It consists of remixes of songs from the duo&#x27;s albums &quot;Behaviour&quot; (1990) and &quot;Very&quot; (1993), as well as B-sides from the time.

A &quot;club-ready sequel&quot; to &quot;Disco&quot; (1986), as well as a &quot;companion of sorts&quot; to the &quot;Very/Relentless&quot; set of 1993, &quot;Disco 2&quot; was released to mixed reviews. It reached number six on the UK Albums Chart.

==Background and composition==
The tracks on the CD were mixed into one long continuous megamix by DJ Danny Rampling. As a result, most of the tracks are in edited versions, having been cut off mid-way through in a crossfade into the following tracks (as a DJ might do while mixing music live). Some of the tracks were reduced by more than half of their original lengths in this way. In addition, some tracks were sped up or slowed down, in order to match the overall tempo of the mix.

A limited edition of the album was released in the United States which contained a second CD with B-sides and additional mixes.

Though the album is a DJ mix by Rampling, mention of this only appears on the inner sleeve. Considered one of EMI&#x27;s autumn 1994 highlights, &quot;Disco 2&quot; was promoted from its September release through to Christmas. An earlier remix album, also titled &quot;Disco 2&quot;, was due for release in 1988 following the release of &quot;Actually&quot; (1987) and was to contain extended versions of Pet Shop Boys songs. The duo cancelled the album in protest at EMI including their cover of &quot;Always on My Mind&quot; – intended for inclusion on &quot;Disco 2&quot; – on &quot;Now That&#x27;s What I Call Music 11&quot;, against the duo&#x27;s wishes.

==Critical reception==
In his review of &quot;Disco 2&quot;, Johnny Dee of &quot;NME&quot; wrote that it &quot;works as a party album, an album you can leave on for an hour of comedy dances, trancing and Italo house-style raving while you and your mates get drunk&quot;, and considered it passable as a budget-priced remix album. However, he believed it to be disappointing as a follow-up to &quot;Very&quot;, criticising how many of the tracks &quot;endlessly repeat one stuttering phrase&quot;, and also considered the interspersed samples of &quot;Absolutely Fabulous&quot; characters Edina Monsoon and Patsy Stone to be &quot;very poor&quot;. Believing that the Pet Shop Boys were the only popular pop act to treat their dancefloor remixes as &quot;more than just something to stick on those CD2-out-next-Tuedsay things&quot;, Andrew Harrison of &quot;Select&quot; commented on the high expectations for &quot;Disco 2&quot; – built by the first &quot;Disco&quot; album and &quot;Introspective&quot; (1988). Nonetheless, he deemed it more like a Pet Shop Boys edition of the &quot;Journeys by DJ&quot; mixtape series, and believed that Rampling had lost the drama and humour of the original tracks, as well as &quot;the songs, which PSB remixes never normally fully abandon&quot;. He recommended that readers buy the &quot;Very&quot; twelve-inch singles instead.

Douglas Wolk of &quot;CMJ New Music Monthly&quot; wrote that, on release, &quot;Disco 2&quot; was the highest-profile DJ-centred mix CD available. He believed that the album&#x27;s lengthy flow of &quot;mixes and dubs&quot; is &quot;almost too smooth and clean to bear. You may move your hips, but you won&#x27;t feel the urge to grind them into anything.&quot; &quot;Music Week&quot; called it both a &quot;belated follow-up&quot; to &quot;Disco&quot; and a &quot;47-minute megamix&quot; which should sell well. A reviewer for &quot;Accrington Observer&quot; called it the &quot;second stomping disco album from the kings of the remixes&quot; and believed that the Pet Shop Boys&#x27; distinctive sound had been reworked for a &quot;must buy&quot; set. Reviewing &quot;Disco 2&quot; for &quot;St. Louis Post-Dispatch&quot;, J.D. Considine enjoyed the inclusion of two songs unavailable of otherwise, and praised how the remixes are &quot;more like re-inventions&quot; than mere repackages of the original versions, &quot;sometimes just changing the original&#x27;s mood, sometimes reducing the whole to a few essential hooks&quot;. Though believing those who favour Tennant&#x27;s dry tenor would feel let down, as his voice is wholly absent from some tracks, he concluded that the album&#x27;s &quot;beat-savvy production and disco-ready megamix format make it a party unto itself.&quot;

In &quot;The Herald-Sun&quot;, Howard Cohen said the album&#x27;s lengthy mix of &quot;techno, Eurodisco and house&quot; remixes was &quot;perfect for clubs but can be stultifying at home&quot;, adding that some remixes rendered the original versions unrecognisable. Ultimately, he wrote that &quot;Disco 2&quot; is &quot;fine for the young and energetic who can keep up with the mega-beats-per-minute mixes&quot;. &quot;The Leader-Telegram&quot; reviewer Chuck Campbell opines that it proves the duo&#x27;s &quot;post-&#x27;88 viality and their adaptability to change with fashion&quot;, and commented on how DJs could play the album and &quot;take a 47 minute break&quot;, due to the lack of segues. However, he believed some fans may be &quot;overwhelmed by Tennant&#x27;s nasal singing&quot; over such a length. In a short review, Jonathan Takiff of &quot;The Philadelphia Daily News&quot; included &quot;Disco 2&quot; in a list of albums to ignore and quipped: &quot;Don&#x27;t quit your night job, boys.&quot; Reviewing the &quot;Yesterday I Was Mad at You&quot; single, released to promote the remix album, &quot;Hitmakers&quot; described &quot;Disco 2&quot; as &quot;ultra hip&quot; and added that Junior Vasquez&#x27; remix is &quot;on fire,&quot; while the Jam &amp; Spoon mix is &quot;totally cool&quot;.

In a retrospective review, AllMusic&#x27;s Stephen Thomas Erlewine described &quot;Disco 2&quot; as &quot;more long-winded&quot; than the first &quot;Disco&quot; album, &quot;suffering not only from too many pointless remixes, but a surprising lack of cohesiveness, making it for devoted fans only.&quot; In a review of its follow-up &quot;Disco 3&quot; (2003), &quot;Drowned in Sound&quot; Mark Reed dismissed &quot;Disco 2&quot; as an &quot;unimaginatively-titled medley&quot; of techno remixes. Martin C. Strong, writing in &quot;The Great Rock Discography&quot; (2006), commented that &quot;Disco 2&quot; and the B-sides collection &quot;Alternative&quot; (1995) mark period in which the duo kept a &quot;fairly low profile&quot; following the release of &quot;Very&quot;. He rated &quot;Disco 2&quot; five out of ten, the same as &quot;Disco&quot; and higher than &quot;Disco 3&quot;. In &quot;Christgau&#x27;s Consumer Guide: Albums of the &#x27;90s&quot; (2000), Robert Christgau rated the album a &quot;dud&quot;.

<text>The Wet Mountain Valley is a high elevation mountain valley mostly located in Custer County but extending southward into Huerfano County in south-central Colorado. Westcliffe and Silver Cliff are the two towns in the valley which is mostly devoted to cattle ranching. 

==Geography==
The Wet Mountain Valley is nestled beneath the Wet Mountains on the east, and the Sangre de Cristo Range that parallels the valley on the west. Both mountain ranges are in the Sangre de Cristo Mountains system of the Southern Rocky Mountains. The valley is approximately long from north to south and wide with elevations of between and . 

The two towns in the valley are Westcliffe and Silver Cliff which are located side by side at an elevation of just under . According to the U.S. census for 2020, Westcliffe has a population of 435 and Silver Cliff has a population of 609. DeWeese Reservoir is near the two towns. The valley is known for its historic ranches. Conservation easements preserve some of the ranches from sub-division and development. Silver mining attracted early settlers. The sparse remains of two former mining towns, Rosita and Querida, are east of Westcliffe. Both had a population of more than 1,000 people in 1880. 
The valley is drained by two major creeks, both of which rise in the Sangre de Cristos. Grape Creek begins in the south of Custer County near Music Pass and flows north into DeWeese Reservoir; from there it enters a narrow gorge before reaching the Arkansas River. Texas Creek begins northwest of Westcliffe and flows to the northeast meeting the Arkansas River at US Highway 50. A small part of the valley drains southward into the Huerfano River.

In 2015, Westcliff and Silver Cliff became an International Dark Sky Community, the first in Colorado, the ninth in the world, and at the highest elevation of all dark sky communities. The designation as a dark sky community requires a local effort to limit light pollution. An observatory in Westcliffe welcomes tourists.

===Climate===
The Wet Mountain Valley has a Dfb climate (humid continental with warm summers and cold winters) in the Köppen Classification system and DCblo (humid continental with mild summers and cold winters) in the Trewartha climate classification system. At Westcliffe from 1948 to 2005, the warmest month was July with an average temperature of and the coldest month was January with an average temperature is . Precipitation was annually with the majority in the summer. Snowfall averaged annually. The highest elevations of the valley may have a Dfc (continental subarctic) climate. The surrounding mountains have an ET (arctic tundra) climate at elevations above about in elevation.

<text>Peter Tali Coleman (December 8, 1919 – April 28, 1997) was an American Samoan politician and lawyer. Coleman was the first and only person of Samoan descent to be appointed governor of American Samoa between 1956 and 1961 and later became the territory&#x27;s first and third popularly elected governor from 1978 to 1985 and 1989 to 1993, serving a total of three elected terms. In between, he had served in different administrative positions for Pacific islands.

Born to an American navy officer and a native mother in American Samoa, he grew up there and in Hawaii and participated in World War II, before becoming a lawyer and then returning to American Samoa to practice law there. In 1955 he was briefly appointed by the Republican federal government as the first Attorney General of American Samoa and then became governor in 1956. During his first administration, Coleman chaired the convention that drafted the Constitution of American Samoa, containing the bill of rights and providing protection for Samoans against alienation of their lands and loss of their culture. His administration also laid the foundation for the American Samoa Fono legislature and produced the official seal and flag of American Samoa. When the Democrats overtook the federal government, he was replaced and appointed to different administrative positions for Pacific islands.

He came back to American Samoa once more in 1977 to run for the first gubernatorial election of the territory. After American Samoans had finally approved electing their own governor in that year, he was elected the first and third governor in 1977, 1980, and 1988 over his Democratic rival A. P. Lutali each time, losing against him in 1992. He also was the founding chairman of the territory&#x27;s Republican Party, serving from 1985 to 1988. To this date he has been the only Republican governor ever of American Samoa.

Coleman&#x27;s career spanned over the entire second half of the 20th century. He is the only governor in the United States whose service spanned five decades and one of the longest-serving governors of any jurisdiction in American history. He was a recipient of the 1997 American Samoan Governor&#x27;s Humanitarian Award and gained the chiefly title Uifa’atali from his home village of Pago Pago. The Peter Tali Coleman Lecture on Pacific Public Policy has been a part of the Pacific Islands Project at Georgetown University, where Coleman received his degree. In 1978, he received an Honorary Doctorate from Chaminade University of Honolulu and in 1970 one from the University of Guam.

==Background==
===Early life and career===
Born and raised in Pago Pago, American Samoa, Coleman attended the &quot;faifeau&quot; and Marist schools, before graduating from Saint Louis School in Honolulu, Hawaii. His parents were Navyman Patrick Dyke Coleman from Washington, DC, and Amata Auma from the Uifaatali family. His family title, Uifaatali, was bestowed on him in 1977. Coleman later joined the U.S. Army, rising to the rank of captain during World War II. He returned to the Samoan Islands in the early 1950s and practiced law in Pago Pago and in Apia. He received his law degree from Georgetown University in 1951 and was the first person of Samoan ancestry to receive a law degree from an American university or from any university. He served in American Samoa both as a public defender and as the territory&#x27;s attorney general.

Coleman was appointed governor of American Samoa in 1956 by President Dwight Eisenhower. At the conclusion of his term, he served a variety of positions in the Pacific Islands, including district administrator for the Marshall Islands, district administrator for the Marianas Islands, and deputy high commissioner of the Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands, where he also served as acting high commissioner for one year.

When the Republican Party lost the White House in 1960, Coleman was assigned as deputy high commissioner of the U.S. Trust Territories. He served 17 years in that post, returning in 1977 to run in the first gubernatorial election. Coleman was the first Samoan to become Governor in 1956 and the only one who served by appointment. In 1977, he also became the first elected Governor in American Samoa. He was reelected in 1980, lost the 1984 election, and was reelected once again in 1988.

Coleman became the first popularly elected Samoan governor after defeating Democrat A. P. Lutali with 60% of the votes in a special runoff election held on November 22, 1977. The election was described by the &quot;New York Times&quot; as “a major step toward self-determination by island’s residents.” After having turned down the proposal to elect their own Governor in three plebiscites, American Samoans in 1977 had also overwhelmingly approved the measure which allowed them to elect that official.

===Death and legacy===
Peter Coleman and Nora Stewart of Honolulu were married in 1941. They had thirteen children, twenty-three grandchildren, and eight great-grandchildren. In 2014, his daughter Aumua Amata Radewagen was elected Delegate to represent American Samoa in the United States House of Representatives. She is the first woman to represent American Samoa in Congress.

Coleman died in 1997 in Honolulu after a two-year struggle with liver cancer.

Coleman&#x27;s legacy includes the effort to incorporate American Samoa in the Social Security system and the recognition and promotion of tourism as an economic development strategy. He began to rebuild and expand the Tafuna Airstrip to take jet planes. The policy for local autonomy moved further during his years as Governor.

At the conclusion of Coleman&#x27;s three-year term, Coleman cited some of the achievements that made him proud. These included changes to the judiciary system with the addition of the district and village courts, the start of the Teacher Corps program, the addition of renal dialysis at LBJ Hospital, and the completion of the Aua-Top Mle and Aoa-Amouli roads.

Coleman was responsible for the territory&#x27;s membership in the National Governors Association (NGA) and the Regional Western Governors Association.

<doc id="726830" wikidata="Q313730" url="?curid=726830" title="Electronic viewfinder">
<text>An electronic viewfinder (EVF) is a camera viewfinder where the image captured by the lens is displayed on a small screen (usually LCD or OLED) which the photographer can look through when composing their shot. It differs from a live preview screen in being smaller and shaded from ambient light, and may also use less power. The sensor records the view through the lens, the view is processed, and finally projected on a miniature display which is viewable through the eyepiece.

Digital viewfinders are used in digital still cameras and in video cameras. Some cameras (such as Panasonic, Sony, Fujifilm) have an automatic eye sensor which switches the display from screen to EVF when the viewfinder is near the eye. More modest cameras use a button to switch the display. Some have no button at all.

While many cameras come with a built-in EVF, this is fixed in place and can only be used while holding the camera to the user&#x27;s eye, which may not be convenient. Other cameras don&#x27;t come with an EVF at all, or come with a low quality one. It is sometimes possible to get a separate, attachable EVF to use in these cases. In certain higher end models such as the Alexa Series by ARRI, an external viewfinder is the default way of monitoring what is being shot.

==Comparison with optical viewfinders==
Whereas EVFs use a digital screen to display a representation of the scene captured by a camera, an optical viewfinder (OVF) typically uses a prism and mirror to direct the image coming through the camera&#x27;s lens to the viewfinder. An EVF enables the user to view previously taken photographs and use the camera&#x27;s menu system while looking through the viewfinder, which is not possible with an OVF. It also allows the use of features such as focus peaking (colourful lines displayed on screen to indicate which parts of the scene are in focus which helps with focussing and composing a shot) and zebras (which help with setting exposure by indicating on screen when a part of the image will be overexposed with the current camera settings). The digital preview shown in an EVF incorporates the camera&#x27;s settings (including exposure, white balance, etc.) and so the image seen can be an exact preview of what the taken photograph will look like, which is not possible with an OVF.

OVFs may be better suited to use in low light or situations with very big differences in brightness due to the dynamic range limitations of an electronic screen. There is also no time lag with an OVF, whereas an EVF might take a bit of time to process the image and update the display (particularly when using longer exposure times).

To get the advantage of both optical and digital viewfinders some cameras have hybrid viewfinders. These display the image in an optical eyepiece viewfinder, or digitally on an LCD screen. Examples include some Fujifilm X-series cameras.

<doc id="726835" wikidata="Q2063380" url="?curid=726835" title="Sloulin Field International Airport">
<text>Sloulin Field International Airport was an airport serving Williston, a city in North Dakota. It was two miles north of downtown and was owned and operated by the city. Built in 1947, the airport faced expansion constraints, design issues, and the need for runway refurbishment. For these reasons, as well as the rise in air traffic amid the North Dakota oil boom, officials decided to build Williston Basin International Airport. Sloulin Field Airport closed to the public on October 10, 2019.

==History==
The first airport to serve Williston, North Dakota, was east of the city near Little Muddy Creek. The environment was unsuitable, and operations shifted to a new airport in 1936. The site became too small, so Sloulin Field International Airport was built in 1947. ISN covered 740 acres (299 ha) of land.

Sloulin Field Airport faced various problems as the city grew. The 2004 master plan noted limited room for expansion because of the surrounding terrain and buildings, design issues that conflicted with the Federal Aviation Administration&#x27;s standards, and the need to refurbish the runway. Runway improvements had also been recommended in the 1993 master plan.

A $4 million renovation project included the construction of a new terminal that opened in October 2006. When Delta Air Lines and United Airlines announced plans to serve Williston in 2012, airport officials decided to add a mobile home trailer to provide additional capacity for the terminal.

In light of the issues highlighted in the 2004 master plan and increased air service to Williston amid the North Dakota oil boom, plans either to renovate Sloulin Field Airport or to construct a new airport surfaced in 2011. Officials ultimately decided to build Williston Basin International Airport because of cost considerations. Sloulin Field Airport has been decommissioned, and the land will be sold.

==Infrastructure==
===Runway===
The airport had two asphalt runways. Runway 11/29 was , and Runway 2/20 was .

===Terminal===
Sloulin Field Airport had a terminal with a mobile home trailer that provides extra seating capacity. The terminal had one gate and vending machines for passengers.

==Airlines and destinations==
At the time of its closure, the airport had daily passenger service to Minneapolis on Delta Connection and to Denver on United Express. The airlines together offered five flights per day to Sloulin Field. The airport saw eleven flights per day, including nonstop service to Houston, at the height of the oil boom.

==Statistics==
Sloulin Field International Airport had experienced great growth in air traffic amid the oil boom in the state. Passenger enplanements went from 27,860 in 2011 to a peak of 119,069 in 2014, a roughly 327% increase over three years.

In 2015 the airport had 43,014 aircraft operations, average 118 per day: 82% general aviation, 8% air taxi, 8% airline, 2% Air Cargo and &lt;1% military. Forty-nine aircraft were then based at this airport: 86% single-engine, 10% multi-engine, and 4% helicopter.

<doc id="726836" wikidata="Q283735" url="?curid=726836" title="Bilingual (album)">
<text>Bilingual is the sixth studio album by English synth-pop duo Pet Shop Boys, released in the United Kingdom on 2 September 1996 by Parlophone and in the United States on 10 September 1996 by Atlantic Records. The album reached number four on the UK Albums Chart, lower than their previous five studio albums which had all reached the top three. It yielded five successful singles, with three of them—&quot;Before&quot;, &quot;Se a vida é (That&#x27;s the Way Life Is)&quot; and &quot;A Red Letter Day&quot;—reaching the UK top 10; the fourth one, the English/Spanish-language composition &quot;Single-Bilingual&quot;, peaked within the top 20.

==Background and recording==
&quot;Bilingual&quot; continues the heavily instrumented arrangements and backing vocals Pet Shop Boys began adding to their music with the album &quot;Very&quot;. As the title suggests, the songs on the album have worldwide influences, particularly from Latin America. After the release of their &quot;Very&quot; album, Pet Shop Boys toured South America and were influenced by the beats and rhythms associated with Latin American music. Three of the songs on the album have bilingual lyrics, mixing the English language with Spanish and Portuguese.

&quot;Bilingual&quot; was recorded between 1995 and 1996 at Bunk Junk &amp; Genius, Sarm West and Sarm Hook End in London, at Axis and Bass Hit in New York City, and at the State House of Broadcasting and Sound Recording in Moscow. The album was produced by Pet Shop Boys, Chris Porter, Danny Tenaglia and K-Klass.

==Release and promotion==
Early in 1996, prior to the album&#x27;s release, the Pet Shop Boys collaborated with David Bowie on the song &quot;Hallo Spaceboy&quot;, which reached #12 in the UK Singles Chart in February 1996.

In late 1995, the band ended their contract with the American branch of EMI and signed with Atlantic Records. A renewed marketing campaign was launched to promote the band in the United States via both radio airplay and club play. Already in May 1996, Atlantic supplied 200 clubs with import copies of &quot;Before&quot; ahead of the single&#x27;s stateside release on 17 June.

In late 1996 the song &quot;Up Against It&quot; became a radio hit in Sweden and some other countries but never had a release as a CD single.

On 15 December 1996, Tennant appeared with Suede at the Roundhouse in London, singing &quot;Saturday Night&quot; as a duet with Suede&#x27;s lead singer Brett Anderson. The live recording, together with &quot;Rent&quot; Tennant performed on the same evening accompanied by Suede, would later be released as B-sides to Suede&#x27;s single &quot;Filmstar&quot;.

By February 1997, the album is said to have sold 1.5 million copies worldwide.

In 1997, Pet Shop Boys decided to perform a series of concerts at the Savoy Theatre in London. To promote the concerts they released a cover version of &quot;Somewhere&quot; from &quot;West Side Story&quot; and called their residency &quot;Pet Shop Boys Somewhere&quot;. The single reached the UK top 10 and &quot;Bilingual&quot; was re-released in a &quot;Special Edition&quot;, including the new single and a bonus CD of remixes and B-sides.

In 2001, Pet Shop Boys reissued their first six studio albums; &quot;Bilingual&quot; was re-released as &quot;Bilingual/Further Listening 1995–1997&quot;. The reissue was not only digitally remastered, but included a second disc of B-sides and previously unreleased material from around the time of the album&#x27;s original release.

Yet another re-release followed on 9 February 2009, under the title of &quot;Bilingual: Remastered&quot;. This version contains only the 12 tracks of the original. With the 2009 re-release, the 2001 double-disc re-release was discontinued.

===Singles===
&quot;Before&quot; was released on 22 April 1996 as the lead single from &quot;Bilingual&quot; and reached number #7 in the UK top 40. It was co-produced with Danny Tenaglia and featured Barbara Tucker, Carole Sylvan and Karen Bernod on backing vocals. The B-sides were &quot;Hit and Miss&quot;, &quot;The Truck Driver and His Mate&quot; and the 1995 version of &quot;In the Night&quot;.

In the United States, Atlantic&#x27;s gay marketing division promoted &quot;Before&quot; with a series of parties at gay nightclubs in cities where the band had previous commercial success. Several hundred clubs received import promotional 12&quot; singles and the subsequent domestic 12&quot; and CD maxi-single releases were focused entirely on remixes. Promotion was also targeted at Top 40, alternative, and college radio formats.

The album&#x27;s second single, &quot;Se a vida é (That&#x27;s the Way Life Is)&quot;, was co-produced with Chris Porter and featured drums by Glasgow group SheBoom. Remixes were done by Mark Picchiotti, Deep Dish and Pink Noise. The B-sides were &quot;Betrayed&quot; and &quot;How I Learned to Hate Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roll&quot;. The video for the song was shot by Bruce Weber and set mainly in a water park located in South Florida featuring youthful models frolicking in the water, evoking imagery of the 1990 single &quot;Being Boring&quot;. The single had a great deal of radio play on release, and during the summer of 1996 spent five weeks in the UK top 40 peaking at #8 making it the last legit UK hit single in the duos discography. It was eventually released in the US in April 1997 as a double A-side single with &quot;To Step Aside&quot;. To promote the package, thirteen mixes of &quot;To Step Aside&quot; were commissioned, most of them released promotionally only and unreleased in the UK. &quot;To Step Aside&quot; was nominated for a Grammy Award for Best Dance Recording in 1998.

The third single to be released was &quot;Single&quot;. It was renamed &quot;Single-Bilingual&quot; as Everything but the Girl had recently released a different song also called &quot;Single&quot;. Produced by Pet Shop Boys with drums by SheBoom, the single included remixes of &quot;Single-Bilingual&quot; and a new mix of &quot;Discoteca&quot;. The B-sides were &quot;Confidential&quot; (a demo for Tina Turner) and &quot;The Calm Before the Storm&quot;. It peaked at #14 in the UK top 40 on November 1996 and was performed live alongside &quot;Se a Vida e&quot; with &quot;SheBoom&quot; in the UK on popular &quot;Channel 4&quot; Show &quot;TFI Friday&quot; hosted by Chris Evans.

A new version of &quot;A Red Letter Day&quot;, featuring additional production by Steve Rodway, was released as the fourth single from &quot;Bilingual&quot;. It features Barbara Tucker, Carole Sylvan and Karen Bernod on backing vocals along with the Choral Academy of Moscow. The B-sides were &quot;The Boy Who Couldn&#x27;t Keep His Clothes On&quot; and &quot;Delusions of Grandeur&quot;. It was also the only Top of the Pops studio performance of any single released from &quot;Bilingual&quot;. The previous singles had been promoted on the hit music show by the official promotional videos. The performance of &quot;A Red Letter Day&quot; in March 1997 was the first TOTP studio performance by Neil and Chris as a duo since a July 1995 episode in which they performed &quot;Paninaro 95&quot; and since appearing as a trio alongside David Bowie for &quot;Hallo Spaceboy&quot; in February 1996. A Red Letter Day entered the UK top 40 at #9 only to crash out of the top 40 after only one week.

During this era, an additional single not part of the original &quot;Bilingual&quot; package, &quot;Somewhere&quot;, was released to promote the duo&#x27;s residency at the Savoy Theatre in London and a reissue of &quot;Bilingual&quot;. A performance of &quot;Somewhere&quot; was recorded at the Savoy Theatre for &quot;Top of the Pops&quot;. In the UK The single charted at #9. In the US, it was released as a double A-side with &quot;A Red Letter Day&quot;. For the UK release, the B-sides were &quot;Disco Potential&quot; and &quot;The View from Your Balcony&quot;.

<doc id="726837" wikidata="Q6249609" url="?curid=726837" title="John Mosier">
<text>John Mosier is an American academic known for his work in English, film, and history. Mosier was formerly a professor of English at Loyola University New Orleans.

Mosier received his Ph.D. in 1968, from Tulane University. He completed his dissertation on the links between poetry and historiography.

Mosier is probably best known for his revisionist military history books. These books &quot;The Myth of the Great War: A New Military History of World War I &quot; and &quot;The Blitzkrieg Myth: How Hitler and the Allies Misread the Strategic Realities of World War II&quot;. In each of these books, Mosier challenges the current views held in regard to these conflicts. In &quot;The Myth of the Great War&quot;, Mosier argues that Germany was winning World War I, and only the arrival of the United States spared the Allies from military defeat and a negotiated peace with the Germans. In &quot;The Blitzkrieg Myth&quot;, Mosier argues that the supposedly revolutionary concept of blitzkrieg has been overrated and that most of the victories on both sides were the result of conventional military tactics. Both of these books and their theses remain controversial. In his 2010 book &quot;Deathride: Hitler vs. Stalin - The Eastern Front, 1941-1945,&quot; he posits that the Germans would surely have defeated the Soviets if not for the Allies, and that one of the Russians&#x27; problems is that they were &quot;pathological liars&quot;.&quot;&quot;

He also published a military biography of Ulysses S. Grant. The book was revisionist in method; however, his thesis focused on the more traditional view that Grant was a genius. This deviates from Mosier&#x27;s previous revisionist tendencies.

In addition to his books on military history, Mosier is a former film critic and serves on Cannes Film Festival committees. He also works as writer and editor for publications such as the journal of the Organization of American States.

== Criticism ==
Mosier has come under criticism, with some scholars calling his work &quot;deeply flawed&quot; and &quot;dreadful&quot;. &quot;The Myth of the Great War: A New Military History of World War I&quot; has been said to have a &quot;contempt for history,&quot; and overlooks huge parts of history that debunk the narrative being created. He has been criticized for drawing too heavily on secondary sources and his list of sources has similarly been referred to as &quot;limited&quot;. Mitchell Yockelson has this to say:Even though historians on both sides of the Atlantic have proven this

study unreliable, including a reviewer in this journal, Mosier believes Win-

ter&#x27;s claim that &quot;the American archives, like the British, were rifled.&quot; It is

hard to take such a statement seriously when no evidence exists that Mosier

conducted any research in the primary AEF and BEF records. He defends his

lack of primary research by suggesting: &quot;Historians operate under the con-

viction that archival research is the be all and end all of their profession.&quot;Yockelson does still acknowledge that Mosier&#x27;s work does help fuel scholarly debate, even though there are inaccuracies. Spencer C. Tucker similarly acknowledges that though &quot;The Myth of the Great War: A New Military History of World War I&quot; has its errors, it is nonetheless thought-provoking.

<doc id="726841" wikidata="Q2738882" url="?curid=726841" title="Psycho Mantis">
<text>, born Tretij Rebenok, is a fictional boss character in Konami&#x27;s &quot;Metal Gear&quot; video game series. Psycho Mantis first appears in &quot;Metal Gear Solid&quot;, where he helps main antagonist Liquid Snake in his attempt to capture Shadow Moses Island. In a battle with the game&#x27;s protagonist, Psycho Mantis uses his psychic powers to talk directly to the player of the game in a way that crosses the fourth wall of the game screen, playing tricks with the game&#x27;s memory card and controller. Psycho Mantis goes on to reappear in several later games in the series. In English, he is voiced by Doug Stone, while in Japanese he is voiced by Kazuyuki Sogabe.

Game critics have praised Psycho Mantis and his fourth-wall-breaking interactions, calling the scene one of the most memorable moments in video games. Further commentary has analyzed the scene for its impact on the player&#x27;s experience, including in the form of the player&#x27;s relationship with the on-screen protagonist, Solid Snake. 

== Appearances ==
Psycho Mantis is a psychic and an antagonist in the game &quot;Metal Gear Solid.&quot; He appears halfway through the game in a dialog and battle sequence. Protagonist Solid Snake receives romantic advances from his ally Meryl Silverburgh, only to discover that she is being psychically controlled by Psycho Mantis. Snake is unfazed, and after knocking Meryl out, Psycho Mantis reveals himself. Psycho Mantis seeks to prove his psychic powers to Snake, and to do so, talks directly to the player of the game in a way that crosses the fourth wall of the game screen. He first reads &quot;Metal Gear Solid&quot;&#x27;s metadata about the player&#x27;s actions in order to make a judge of their personality, before then reading the system&#x27;s memory card to read what other games the player is a fan of. If the player has a DualShock vibrating controller, Mantis will instruct the player to place it on the ground, at which point he will activate the controller&#x27;s rumble effect. He then causes the console to appear to disconnect before transitioning into battle, in which he can seemingly read all of the player&#x27;s movements. Following advice from in-game hints, players can shift their controller from the first controller port to the second controller port, which will render Mantis unable to read their movements. Mantis is killed by Snake during the battle.

In-game dialogue reveals that his mother had died while giving birth to him. His father hated him as a result. Mantis discovers this while reading his father&#x27;s mind, causing Mantis to burn his village to the ground out of fear. Mantis joined the KGB later in his life, and afterward joined the CIA, using his psychic powers to delve into the minds of suspected criminals. After delving too deep into the mind of a serial killer, Mantis went insane. According to Mantis, he joined with Liquid Snake, the game&#x27;s main antagonist in order to &quot;kill as many people as he could&quot; as he had grown disgusted with the human race.

Mantis briefly re-appears in &quot;Metal Gear Solid 4: Guns of the Patriots&quot;, where his ghost appears to control the deceased body of the boss enemy Screaming Mantis. Mantis tries and fails to repeat the same display of his powers from &quot;Metal Gear Solid&quot; due to the PlayStation 3&#x27;s lack of memory card. If the player is using a DualShock vibrating controller, he will become excited by the fact he is still able to manipulate the controller. Psycho Mantis later appears as a cameo in &quot;Metal Gear Solid V: Ground Zeroes&quot;.

A younger version of Psycho Mantis appears in &quot;Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain&quot;, where he is a child under the name Tretij Rebenok. He is manipulated by the game&#x27;s main antagonist, Skull Face, who uses Rebenok to control a Metal Gear robot with the goal of killing all English-speaking people in the world. Rebenok is later influenced by the rage of protagonist Venom Snake&#x27;s ally, Eli, who earns Rebenok&#x27;s allegiance. This allows Eli to gain control over the robot.

A commercial advertising the Ford Focus aired in 2016, which parodied the scene where Mantis reads Snake&#x27;s mind. Psycho Mantis&#x27;s English voice actor, Doug Stone, reprised his role as Mantis for the commercial. A statuette of Psycho Mantis was also released in 2018. Psycho Mantis additionally made a cameo appearance in the 2024 game &quot;Astro Bot&quot;.

== Development ==
&quot;Metal Gear&quot; series designer Hideo Kojima was inspired to create Psycho Mantis after watching the 1978 film &quot;The Fury&quot;, leading the team use the film&#x27;s depiction of psychic power as a reference. Kojima stated that when developing Mantis, he wished to harness the concept of masters telling their students to clear their minds. The only method he could think of to reflect this was to switch the controller ports, which was controversial among younger members of the team. Mantis was designed by character artist Yoji Shinkawa. Psycho Mantis has been portrayed in voice by Doug Stone in English and by Kazuyuki Sogabe in Japanese.

Later adaptations of the game had to re-imagine interactions with Psycho Mantis that were designed for the PlayStation hardware. In PC ports of the game, the player must use the keyboard to trick Mantis, while later PlayStation console ports require players to go to the settings and switch their controller connection to Player 2. In the novelization of the game, the boss fight is adapted into a series of hallucinations where Snake reckons with deeper realizations about his character. The comic adaptation of the game had Mantis appear on a cliffhanger, threatening to use his powers to make Meryl shoot herself, before seemingly being defeated by Snake&#x27;s ally Master Miller. Miller is revealed to be an illusion of Mantis&#x27;s, and Snake proceeds to defeat Mantis in battle. Additionally, in &quot;Metal Gear Solid Master Collection Vol.1,&quot; which contains a remake of &quot;Metal Gear Solid&quot;, an option exists to allow players to curate their save data, allowing them to select what games Mantis will reference during his boss battle.

== Reception and analysis ==

=== Critical reception ===
Despite Psycho Mantis&#x27;s brief appearance in &quot;Metal Gear Solid&quot;, his role in the game has been consistently received as one of the most iconic and celebrated scenes in video games. In the book &quot;100 Greatest Video Game Characters&quot;, Nicholas David Bowman described how Psycho Mantis&#x27;s boss battle crosses into direct engagement with the player, explaining that &quot;Rarely has a game character violated so many assumptions about the rules of engagement—stretching the conflict from the television screen to the player&#x27;s own mind.&quot; In &quot;IGN&quot;&#x27;s ranking of gaming&#x27;s greatest villains, the publication stated that Mantis &quot;attacked players on all fronts,&quot; with his manipulation of Meryl preying on the feelings players developed for her at that point in the game. &quot;A Brief History of Video Games&quot; noted how breaking the fourth wall was both varied and unique, making the battle &quot;a bravura performance rather than a mere novelty&quot; Hideo Kojima later stated that Psycho Mantis was his favorite character in the series. Filmmaker and director Guillermo del Toro additionally praised the Psycho Mantis scene for being able to transcend the video game medium.

Andy Kelly of &quot;TheGamer&quot; praised the character as part of what made &quot;Metal Gear Solid&quot; so iconic, describing how the Mantis battle utilized the video game medium in unique and inventive ways. Manon Hume of &quot;Game Informer&quot; also praised the battle as inventive, describing how it makes the player question their control over the game. Brendan Main of &quot;The Escapist&quot; posited that Mantis&#x27;s ability to unnerve the player with their save data was an experience that was not replicable outside of &quot;Metal Gear Solid&quot; itself. This caused an uncertainty in the minds of players about their ability to properly control the game, and further emphasized how decisions in the game were made by the will of the player, and not that of protagonist Solid Snake. Mantis&#x27;s ability to influence the framework of the game was described by the book &quot;Once Upon a Pixel: Storytelling and Worldbuilding in Video Games&quot; as amplifying the tension of the encounter. The book &quot;Metagames: Games About Games&quot; highlighted how Psycho Mantis became far more powerful by breaking the fourth wall, using his control over the player&#x27;s input to make them feel more vulnerable. Chad Concelmo of &quot;Destructoid&quot; stated that Psycho Mantis&#x27;s manipulation of the fourth wall was revolutionary for the time and was able to maintain its weight even long after the game&#x27;s release, more than other scenes with greater emotional weight. His dissonance from other bosses in the game was highlighted by the book &quot;50 Years of Boss Fights: Video Game Legends&quot;, as unlike prior bosses, players had to think outside of the box in order to defeat Psycho Mantis.

=== Analysis ===
Psycho Mantis&#x27;s ability to directly interact with players received significant analysis. The book &quot;The Encyclopedia of Computer Graphics and Games&quot; analyzed how Psycho Mantis&#x27;s ability to dodge controller inputs exploited the player&#x27;s comfort with the game, describing how it &quot;defamiliarizes players&quot; from the game&#x27;s controls and mechanics. The book &quot;Hideo Kojima: Progressive Game Design&quot; describes how the Mantis boss sequence gave the game developers control beyond just the game, but also to the video game medium itself. His self-awareness was additionally described by the book &quot;Framing Uncertainty: Computer Game Epistemologies&quot; as allowing Mantis to cross a &quot;border&quot; between the game&#x27;s world and the real world, causing a deep level of uncertainty in players. The book &quot;Once Upon a Pixel: Storytelling and Worldbuilding in Video Games&quot; additionally stated that this ability made Mantis more terrifying as an opponent. &quot;The International Journal of Transmedia Literacy&quot; analyzed how Psycho Mantis shifts his attention from Snake to the player, emphasizing the player&#x27;s importance in the game narrative, and requiring them to take action in the real world in order to save the game&#x27;s protagonist.

&quot;Once Upon a Pixel: Storytelling and Worldbuilding in Video Games&quot; described how the sequence was able to remind players of the fact that the world of &quot;Metal Gear Solid&quot; was in a video game, and that while they controlled Snake, they themselves would never amount to actually being Snake. This created conflicting feelings of identification and alienation, with Mantis&#x27;s actions pushing the player out of the normal game flow they were experiencing as Snake. The book &quot;Performativity in Art, Literature, and Videogames&quot; also described a &quot;feedback loop&quot; caused by the player&#x27;s involvement with Psycho Mantis&#x27;s fourth-wall breaking, stating that the battle caused confusion between &quot;human physiological processes and computational processes&quot;. Other academics additionally noted the metanarrative impact of the boss sequence, describing how it made the game more immersive by requiring the player to interact directly with the game console.

<text>Jamestown Regional Airport is two miles northeast of Jamestown, in Stutsman County, North Dakota, United States. It is owned by the Jamestown Regional Airport Authority, and was formerly Jamestown Municipal Airport. It is used for general aviation and sees one airline, with flights twice each weekday and once on Saturdays and Sundays. Scheduled passenger service is subsidized by the Essential Air Service program.

Federal Aviation Administration records say the airport had 2,769 passenger boardings (enplanements) in calendar year 2008, 3,471 in 2009 and 4,434 in 2010. The National Plan of Integrated Airport Systems for 2011-2015 categorized it as a &quot;non-primary commercial service&quot; airport (between 2,500 and 10,000 enplanements per year).

== Facilities==
The airport covers 1,500 acres (607 ha) at an elevation of 1,500 feet (457 m). It has two asphalt runways: 13/31 is 6,502 by 100 feet (1,982 x 30 m) and 4/22 is 5,750 by 75 feet (1,753 x 23 m).

In 2019 the airport had 11,916 aircraft operations, average 33 per day: 75% general aviation, 6% air taxi, 18% airline and &lt;1% military. 36 aircraft were then based at this airport: 33 single-engine, 1 multi-engine, and 2 helicopter.

== Airline and destinations ==


United Express flies CRJ200s operated by SkyWest Airlines to Denver.

== Historical airline service ==
Northwest Airlines began flying to Jamestown in 1947 as one of many stops along a transcontinental route originating in either Seattle or Portland and terminating at either New York or Washington D.C. Northwest began its first scheduled jets in 1968 with the Boeing 727. Service ended in 1979 with airline deregulation and a series of smaller commuter airlines then served Jamestown.

Jamestown Aviation, Inc. began five day a week service on May 17, 1978, between Jamestown and Minneapolis, Minnesota with one daily round trip on a six-passenger twin-engine aircraft. This was in response to a Northwest pilot&#x27;s strike that started on April 30, 1978, and the cancellation of Crystal Shamrock Airlines service on a route from Minneapolis, Fargo, Jamestown and Bismarck, North Dakota.

Air Wisconsin served Jamestown from 1979 through 1981 followed by Big Sky Airlines from 1981 through 1983.

Mesaba Airlines started service in late 1983 and began code sharing with Northwest Airlines as Northwest Airlink in 1985.

Great Lakes Airlines replaced Mesaba in 1991. Great Lakes operated as United Express on behalf of United Airlines from 1992 through 2002 then back under their own branding through 2003.

Mesaba returned as Northwest Airlink from 2003 through 2012 and became Delta Connection in 2010 upon the merger of Northwest Airlines into Delta Air Lines.

Great lakes returned under their own branding from 2012 through 2013 replacing Mesaba/Delta Connection.

SkyWest Airlines, operating as United Express, began their service in 2014 using Bombardier CRJ100/200 regional jets on flights to Denver. Up until this time, all previous carriers flew to Minneapolis/St. Paul with many flights making one or two stops enroute.

<doc id="726852" wikidata="Q357635" url="?curid=726852" title="Hi-MD">
<text>Hi-MD is a magneto-optical disc-based data storage format. It was a further development of the MiniDisc. With its release in late 2004, came the ability to use newly developed, high-capacity 1 gigabyte Hi-MD discs, in the same dimensions as MiniDisc. The last recorder and player was discontinued in 2011. Blank discs stopped production in September 2012.

== Overview ==

Hi-MD has several Walkman-selectable audio recording codecs, in order of quality: PCM, Hi-SP, and Hi-LP. Hi-MD Walkmans are backward compatible with MiniDisc playback and most can record. Hi-MD can store computer files and audio data. A bus-powered Hi-MD Walkman is seen as standard USB Mass Storage device with a FAT filesystem.

Since the release of Sony&#x27;s music management program, SonicStage 3.4, virtually all digital rights management was removed for compatible Hi-MD machines.

In 2005, Sony released its second-generation Hi-MD devices offering native MP3 support.

In 2005, Sony announced Hi-MD Photo. The Sony MZ-DH10P Walkman was released to showcase the format with a 1.3 megapixel digital camera.

In March 2006, Sony released the MZ-RH1 Hi-MD Walkman in Japan, which was later followed in other regions. With this unit, Sony enabled faster-than-real time transfers from MiniDisc to computers. Sony made tangible speed improvements to the device over previous generations of Hi-MD recorders. The result being that the transfer times to and from computer are—under certain circumstances—cut in half over previous models, but still noticeably slower than flash memory and hard drive-based portables, because of the nature of the Hi-MD magneto-optical system.

== Marketing ==
In 2006, Sony positioned Hi-MD as a Digital Audio Tape (DAT) alternative after discontinuing the format the year before, placing the MZ-RH1 Hi-MD Walkman under the Pro Audio section of its &quot;Broadcast &amp; Business Solutions Company&quot; website, alongside its flash memory-based recorder, the PCM-D1. DAT is a high-quality digital tape format that found a niche with musicians and studios. DAT portables have commonly been used for field recording, but have gradually been replaced by solid-state and hard drive-based units like the Aaton Cantar, the Zaxcom Deva, and similar units from Fostex and Sound Devices.

The MZ-M200 Walkman is Sony&#x27;s MZ-RH1 with a stereo microphone included. The MZ-RH1 was targeted to a more general customer on Sony&#x27;s consumer electronics sites and comes with no microphone bundle. The microphone was included to enable Hi-MD as a field recorder, and the higher price reflects the added value of the microphone.

MD had success in Asia (particularly in Japan and Hong Kong), but North America and Europe leaned toward either flash or hard drive-based systems. For professional recording, many offer features such as professional XLR microphone inputs, among other pro-centric features. These units were typically significantly larger and heavier than a Hi-MD Walkman, often with reduced battery life and higher prices. Hi-MD and MiniDisc recorders are no longer being manufactured, but their role has been taken over by relatively inexpensive flash memory based portable field recorders such as the Edirol R-09HR and the Olympus LS-10.

<doc id="726854" wikidata="Q7111965" url="?curid=726854" title="Outer Circle railway line">
<text>The Outer Circle Railway was opened in stages in 1890 and 1891, as a steam-era suburban railway line, in Melbourne, Australia. It traversed much of the modern City of Boroondara, including the suburbs of (from north to south) Kew East, Camberwell, Burwood, Ashburton, and Malvern East. At its longest, it ran from Fairfield station, on what is today the Hurstbridge line, to Oakleigh station, on the current Gippsland line.

==History==
The Outer Circle railway was first advocated in 1867, by a group known as the Upper Yarra Railway League, who suggested that the Gippsland railway line could be brought into Melbourne via the outer suburbs. However, the term itself was coined in 1873 by Engineer-in-Chief of the Victorian Railways, Thomas Higinbotham, who suggested an &quot;outer circle route&quot;.

Construction of the Gippsland line was authorised in 1873, but the line, which was to be operated by the Victorian Railways, could not be brought into Melbourne by the direct route used today because the privately owned Melbourne &amp; Hobson&#x27;s Bay United Railway Company (M&amp;HBUR) controlled the line from Flinders Street to South Yarra, and there was no connection between the privately run Flinders Street station and the Victorian Railways station at Spencer Street. That problem was solved when the M&amp;HBUR was purchased by the government in 1878, and the direct rail line from South Yarra to Oakleigh was opened the next year.

Agitation for the Outer Circle line was then taken over by politicians and land speculators. It was included in the 1882 Railway Construction Act, and was authorised by the 1884 Railway Construction Act, passed on 12 December 1884. The act also authorised the construction of a viaduct connecting Flinders Street and Spencer Street stations. By 1885, two of the parliamentarians who had helped gain approval for the line, F.E. Beaver and James Munro, had purchased half the land adjoining the new railway.

Construction commenced in 1888 and was completed in 1891. The Outer Circle connected Camberwell station (on the modern Belgrave and Lilydale lines) with Oakleigh station to the south, via Riversdale on what is now the Alamein line. The northern section ran from Riversdale to Fairfield station (then called Fairfield Park).

There was also a branch line from the closed Waverley Road station (near the modern East Malvern station) to Darling and Burnley. That was the first section of what later became the Glen Waverley line, and was opened a few weeks before the Outer Circle.

When opened the line was in length, and had 11 stations, all provided with twin platforms and crossing loops. Provision was made for double track, and heavier-duty per yard rails were used. Despite that, the line never carried Gippsland traffic, and the severe economic depression of the early 1890s meant that suburban development along the line ceased.

==Services==

The first section of the Outer Circle opened was on 24 March 1890, from Oakleigh to Waverley Road, and on to Burnley. It was followed by the line from Waverley Road to Camberwell on 24 March 1890, and the Riversdale to Fairfield Park section on 24 March 1891. From this time the line was operated as three different passenger services:
* Oakleigh to Burnley, change at Waverley Road for,
* Waverley Road to Camberwell, change at Riversdale for,
* Riversdale to Fairfield Park.

Lack of passengers led to service cuts, and the Riversdale to Fairfield Park section was closed completely from 12 April 1893, being replaced by a horse bus service. The Oakleigh to Ashburton and Darling section closed on 9 December 1895, and the last section, from Camberwell to Ashburton, closed on 1 May 1897. Camberwell to Ashburton was reopened 4 July 1898 as the Ashburton line.

=== Station histories ===
== Today ==


Today, the southern section of the line from Camberwell to Alamein is part of the Melbourne suburban railway network as the Alamein line. The northern section of the line, starting at East Camberwell, has been converted into the Outer Circle Trail, a walking and bicycle path. All of the closed stations have since been demolished, as has the railway infrastructure of the line, but some road overbridges and underbridges remain. The rail bridge over the Yarra River was converted into a road bridge as part of the Chandler Highway sometime after 1919. The track between Fairfield station and the northern bank of the Yarra River came into use from 1919 as the APM Siding, serving a paper mill built on the site.

Proposals for re-opening the line are regularly canvassed online.

==Media==
In 2014, a documentary, &quot;Melbourne&#x27;s Forgotten Railway – The Outer Circle&quot;, was produced by a Melbourne-based media production team, led by Ron Killeen and Andrew McColm. It documented the line and included &quot;historians, an urban planning expert, as well as people who actually remember seeing and riding on the train&quot;.

<text>Alfred Blalock (April 5, 1899 – September 15, 1964) was an American surgeon most noted for his work on the medical condition of shock as well as tetralogy of Fallot – commonly known as blue baby syndrome. He created, with assistance from his research and laboratory assistant Vivien Thomas and pediatric cardiologist Helen Taussig, the Blalock–Thomas–Taussig shunt, a surgical procedure to relieve the cyanosis from tetralogy of Fallot. This operation ushered in the modern era of cardiac surgery. He worked at both Vanderbilt University and Johns Hopkins University, where he studied medicine and later served as chief of surgery. He is known as a medical pioneer who won various awards, including Albert Lasker Clinical Medical Research Award. Blalock was also nominated several times for the Nobel Prize in Medicine.

==Early life and education==
Blalock was born in Culloden, Georgia, the son of Martha &quot;Mattie&quot; (Davis) and George Zadock Blalock, a merchant. At the age of 14, he entered as a senior at Georgia Military College, a preparatory school for the University of Georgia.

Shortly after, Blalock attended the University of Georgia as a sophomore undergraduate, skipping his freshman year. While in college, Blalock was heavily involved in the university social life and athletics. He played tennis and golf, was a member of the Delta chapter of the Sigma Chi fraternity, and was secretary and treasurer of his senior class.

=== Medical education ===

After graduating with an A.B. in 1918 at the age of 19, Blalock entered Johns Hopkins School of Medicine, where he roomed with and began a lifelong friendship with Tinsley Harrison, a student who would go on to specialize in cardiovascular medicine. At Johns Hopkins, his record was not considered &quot;outstanding,” given that he graduated near the middle of his class.” Nevertheless, Blalock excelled in surgical courses while he was a student at Hopkins, and this made him come to the realization that he wanted to be a surgeon. In medical school, Blalock was known by his friends and classmates as a &quot;ladies man&quot; due to his frequent trips to Goucher College, a women&#x27;s school located nearby.

Blalock earned his medical degree at Johns Hopkins in 1922, hoping to gain appointment to a surgical residency at Johns Hopkins due to his admiration of William S. Halsted. Because of this, Blalock decided to remain in Baltimore for the next three years. However, he was denied a surgical residency with Halsted because of his average academic record. Instead, Blalock decided to complete an internship in urology, in which he performed exceptionally well. He also completed one year of an assistant residency on the general surgical service (his contract was not renewed), and an externship in otorhinolaryngology.

==Vanderbilt University School of Medicine==
In September 1925, Blalock joined Tinsley Harrison at Vanderbilt University in Nashville to complete his residency under Barney Brooks, Vanderbilt University School of Medicine’s first Professor and Chief of Surgery. During his Vanderbilt years, Blalock spent much of his time in the surgical research laboratory, which he found both challenging and exciting. While at Vanderbilt, Blalock became interested and began studying the nature and treatment of hemorrhagic and traumatic shock. At Vanderbilt, in 1938, Blalock conducted an experiment where the left subclavian artery was connected to the left pulmonary artery. The experiment was meant to induce pulmonary hypertension, but it ended up failing. By conducting his research and mainly experimenting on dogs, Blalock discovered that surgical shock resulted from the loss of blood, which led him to encourage the use of blood plasma or whole blood products to prevent. Blalock&#x27;s innovative research resulted in the saving of many lives on the battlefield during World War II. Unfortunately, Blalock had frequent bouts of tuberculosis, which developed during his later years at Vanderbilt.

=== Working with Vivien Thomas ===
While working in Vanderbilt in 1930, Blalock became increasingly busy and had several obligations that kept him from spending much time in the laboratory. Because of this, Blalock began searching for a new lab assistant that he would be able to count on to carry out all of his experiments. He ended up hiring Vivien Thomas, a young black carpenter, as his lab assistant. Although Blalock hired Thomas as a lab assistant, he was officially titled a janitor. From Blalock&#x27;s perspective, Thomas quickly learned how to perform surgical procedures, carry out experiments, and record data for Blalock&#x27;s research. As they got to know each other, Blalock granted Thomas increased independence in the laboratory, something that was very uncommon, especially for someone black at that time. Blalock and Thomas carried out various experiments relating to shock and cardiac output, as well as developing a technique for adrenal transplantation. Together, they developed innovative, unheard of techniques such as the transplantation of the kidney to the neck in order to remove the kidney&#x27;s nerve supply and study the effect on “Goldblatt hypertension”. Blalock and Thomas built a strong, though unequal, relationship over the years, somewhat marred toward the end by Blalock&#x27;s unwillingness to give Thomas full credit for his contribution to their collaboration.

==Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine==
In 1941 Blalock was asked to return to Johns Hopkins Hospital to work as chief of surgery, professor, and director of the department of surgery of the medical school. When Blalock was offered this position, he immediately requested that his assistant Vivien Thomas come with him. While working together at Hopkins, Blalock and Thomas developed a shunt technique to bypass coarctation of the aorta. Simultaneously, Helen Taussig, a cardiologist, presented to Blalock the problem of the blue baby syndrome - a congenital heart defect known as Tetralogy of Fallot which results in inadequate oxygenation of the blood.

=== The blue baby operation ===

In 1944 Blalock, with Thomas by his side, performed the first &quot;blue baby&quot; operation on Eileen Saxon, a 15-month-old baby. The operation was successful, although the baby died a few months later. After the innovative first completion of the surgery, Blalock became comfortable with the procedure and performed it on thousands of children, often with Thomas by his side. The new operation not only directly saved thousands of lives, it marked the start of the modern era of cardiac surgery, as it was the first successful surgery on the human heart of the modern medical era.

During his later years at Hopkins, Blalock continued his research on the heart and vascular surgery. With Edwards Park, he developed a bypass operation in 1944, and in 1948, with Rollins Hanlon, a cardiac surgeon, he created a technique for overcoming the transposition of the great blood vessels of the heart.

By the 1950s, Blalock had performed over 1,000 surgeries to correct congenital heart defects.

=== Blalock as a mentor ===

In teaching and in research, Blalock paved the way for a new generation of surgeons. Students of Blalock appreciated his unique ability to bring out the best of them. As chief of surgery at Hopkins, Blalock trained 38 chief residents, as well as 9 chairmen of departments, 10 division chiefs, and many others. Many of Blalock&#x27;s students went on to become cardiovascular surgeons themselves and rose to high levels of importance in the surgical world. His colleague and lifelong friend Tinsley Harrison spoke about Blalock&#x27;s ability to teach saying, &quot;A teacher is an individual who has the capacity to influence the horizons of his pupils. Al has had that capacity all of his life.&quot;

In 1955, Blalock became chairman of the medical board of Johns Hopkins Hospital and held that position until his retirement in 1964. Upon retirement, Blalock held the title of professor and surgeon-in-chief emeritus.

Blalock retired from Hopkins in 1964 due to health problems. His retirement was just two and a half months before his death.

==Personal life and death==
Blalock married Mary Chambers O&#x27;Bryan in October 1930. The two had met while Blalock was at Vanderbilt and she worked for the Vanderbilt admissions office. Together they had three children: William Rice Blalock, Mary Elizabeth Blalock and Alfred Dandy Blalock. Together, they lived a happy marriage for 28 years until her death in 1958. A year later, he married Alice Waters, who was a close neighbor that Blalock had known for many years.

Blalock was known for having an appreciation of sports and the outdoors. He enjoyed playing tennis, golfing, fishing, and boating.

In Blalock&#x27;s later years he developed several health problems and eventually died in 1964 from metastatic urothelial carcinoma of the ureter.

==Awards and recognition==
In 1955, Blalock was elected chairman of the medical board of Johns Hopkins Hospital. When he retired in 1964, he was named a Professor Emeritus of Surgery, as well as a Surgeon-in-Chief Emeritus for Johns Hopkins School of Medicine and Johns Hopkins Hospital.

Blalock published more than 200 articles along with a book titled &quot;Principles of Surgery, Shock and Other Problems. &quot;He also delivered more than 40 honorary lectures, and was awarded honorary degrees from nine universities.

Blalock also belonged to 43 medical societies in the United States and other countries. These included the American Philosophical Society, the National Academy of Sciences and Royal Society of Medicine.

In 1954 Blalock received (with Robert Gross and Helen Taussig) the Albert Lasker Clinical Medical Research Award &quot;For distinguished contributions to cardiovascular surgery and knowledge.&quot;

Blalock also received the &quot;Chevalier de la Légion d&#x27;honneur&quot;, the Passano Award, the Matas Award, and the Henry Jacob Bigelow medal.

The Alfred Blalock Clinical Sciences Building at Hopkins Hospital was named after him.

Blalock was also honored with the Baltimore &quot;Man of the Year&quot; award in 1948.

In 2012 a modified Blalock clamp was described by prof. Francesco Petrella (Milan, Italy) for clamping the pulmonary artery during lung cancer resection.

== Films about Blalock and Thomas ==
In 2003, the PBS series &quot;American Experience&quot; premiered the Spark Media documentary &quot;Partners of the Heart&quot;, which was about the collaboration between Blalock and Vivien Thomas at Vanderbilt and Johns Hopkins University. The documentary was directed by Andrea Kalin and written by Kalin and Lou Potter, with re-creations directed by Bill Duke and narration by Morgan Freeman. The &quot;Partners of the Heart&quot; went on to win the Organization of American Historians&#x27; Erik Barnouw Award for Best History Documentary in 2004.

In the 2004 HBO film &quot;Something the Lord Made&quot; about the Blalock-Thomas collaboration, based on Katie McCabe&#x27;s National Magazine Award winning Washingtonian magazine article of the same name, Blalock was portrayed by Alan Rickman and Thomas by Mos Def. Robert Cort produced the film, which went on to win three Emmy Awards for Outstanding Cinematography for a Miniseries or Movie, Outstanding Single-Camera Picture Editing for a Miniseries, Movie or a Special and Outstanding Made for Television Movie.

Greg Germann portrayed Blalock in the 2019 Netflix variety special Kevin Hart&#x27;s Guide to Black History a guide to African-American history through re-enactments with a family sitcom set-up and archival footage.

<text>The Spirituali were members of a reform movement within the Catholic Church, which existed from the 1530s to the 1560s. The movement is sometimes also called evangelism.

The ranks of the Spirituali included Cardinal Gasparo Contarini (1483–1542), Cardinal Jacopo Sadoleto (1477–1547), Cardinal Reginald Pole (1500–1558), Italian poet Vittoria Colonna, and her friend, the artist Michelangelo (1475–1564), who painted the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel and the very controversial &quot;Last Judgement&quot;. These &quot;Italian evangelicals&quot; proposed to reform the Church through a spiritual renewal and internalization of faith by each individual, viewing the intense study of scripture and justification by faith as means to that end. &quot;Central [to the &quot;Spirituali&quot;] was a renewed emphasis on the grace which God sent through faith,&quot; writes Church Historian Diarmaid MacCulloch, &quot;together with a consistent urge to reveal the Holy Spirit as the force conveying this grace – to that associates of the movement were soon characterized as &quot;Spirituali&quot;.&quot;

The Spirituali took many of their ideas from older Catholic texts, but certainly found inspiration in the Protestant Reformation, especially Calvinism, although they wanted peaceful internal reform, not a split. Had the movement become successful, the face of Europe could have changed, perhaps allowing for greater understanding between Catholics and Protestants, if not even reconciliation; it could have changed the political and social reasons leading to the Thirty Years&#x27; War. Benedictine monk Benedetto Fontanini wrote the first version of the most notable expression of Spirituali doctrine, the &quot;Beneficio di Cristo&quot; (The Benefit of Christ&#x27;s Death), in 1543, attempting to prove that salvation comes through Sola fide, or &#x27;faith [in Christ] alone&#x27; (as Protestants insisted on), not through works or the Church; later the poet and humanist Marcantonio Flaminio revised it. The group printed forty thousand copies of the book, which was soon declared heretical and placed on the Index Librorum Prohibitorum.

Although Spirituali occupied positions of high power within the ecclesiastical hierarchy, and may have even held the sympathy of Pope Paul III, they failed to achieve much change, and more conservative &quot;fundamentalist&quot; &quot;zelanti&quot; currents set the Church on a course of confrontation with the Protestants at the Council of Trent (1545–1563), lumping them in with them. The Spirituali&#x27;s lack of success stemmed from inadequate support by the Church hierarchy, and the movement was doomed when Cardinal Pole, who was the choice of Pope Paul III, lost the papal election in 1549–1550 by one vote, after which their position made them suspect to both Protestants and conservative Catholics, allowing them to be outmaneuvered and defeated. Cardinal Pole&#x27;s archenemy Cardinal Carafa, who would later become Pope Paul IV (r. 1555–1559), acted to suppress the Spirituali before and after attaining the papacy, and under him many went on trial before the Inquisition, speedily exterminating the movement and ending all hope of a Protestant-like reform from within Catholicism. Cardinal Pole fled to England, while Paul IV tried unsuccessfully to have him brought back before the Catholic Inquisition.

<text>The Amazing Spider-Man and Captain America in Dr. Doom&#x27;s Revenge! is a side-scrolling video game starring Marvel Comics&#x27; superheroes Spider-Man and Captain America battling a host of supervillains led by Doctor Doom. The player alternately controls Spider-Man and Captain America; the character being controlled switches after each battle.

==Characters==
The game featured an assortment of Marvel Comics supervillains through the course of the game, many of whom are relatively minor characters in the comic books: Eduardo Lobo, Grey Gargoyle, Machete, Boomerang, Oddball, Electro, Hobgoblin, Rhino, Batroc the Leaper, Zaran, Rattan (who was created specifically for the game), and finally Doctor Doom himself. Among the bosses included is also the Hulk (later revealed to be an illusion by Mysterio). The game&#x27;s manual provided biographies on each character in a style similar to the &quot;Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe&quot;, and information about each character was used as a form of copy protection.

==Plot==
After his defeat by Spider-Man, Doctor Doom begins a nefarious revenge plot. Hiring several criminals to become his army, he tracks down and attacks Spider-Man. Spider-Man gets the help of Captain America and sets off to confront Doom, though their mission will be very perilous.
==Reception==
&quot;Computer Gaming World&quot; gave &quot;Doctor Doom&#x27;s Revenge&quot; a mixed review, praising the graphics but noting the game loaded and played very slowly. The review also noted the game was extremely linear, and the controls were unresponsive. &quot;Compute!&quot; liked the PC version&#x27;s graphics and sound card audio, but the reviewer—a fan of Marvel Comics—stated that the story was not as thought-provoking as the source material. The magazine described the Commodore 64 version as &quot;a perfect example of a great idea that just doesn&#x27;t cut it ... the comics are more complex and thus more interesting&quot;, calling fights &quot;disappointing&quot; despite the &quot;great&quot; graphics.

In 1996, &quot;Computer Gaming World&quot; declared &quot;Spiderman/Captain America vs. Doctor Doom&quot; the 27th-worst computer game ever released.

==Development==

Marvel Comics also released a comic book that was only available in the game package. It illustrated the plot leading up to Spider-Man and Captain America&#x27;s mission to stop Dr. Doom.

<doc id="726873" wikidata="Q4786749" url="?curid=726873" title="Archie Meets the Punisher">
<text>Archie Meets the Punisher or The Punisher Meets Archie is a one-shot comic book and intercompany crossover written by Batton Lash with art by Stan Goldberg, John Buscema, and Tom Palmer. It was published jointly by Archie Comics and Marvel Comics in June 1994. In the story, the murderous vigilante Punisher mistakes all-American teenager Archie Andrews for a criminal that he is hunting. When he realizes his error, he works with Archie to rescue Archie&#x27;s girlfriend Veronica Lodge, who has been kidnapped by the criminal. Despite being a humorous intercompany crossover, the comic was said to take place in the mainstream Marvel Universe by &quot;The Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe&quot;.

Lash developed the plot based on a suggestion from Archie editor Victor Gorelick. The script was written with the intention of remaining true to the spirit of both characters rather than focus only on Archie&#x27;s humor or the Punisher&#x27;s action. Gorelick submitted the proposal to Marvel editors for review, and they agreed to move forward with the project. To help preserve the different tones, Archie artist Goldberg and Marvel artist Buscema worked together on the pencil artwork with each only drawing characters and settings for their respective company. Palmer provided inks for both artists to help smooth the differences between their styles. The comic book was kept secret inside both companies until it was announced at a press function shortly before its publication. Two versions were printed, one by each company. The versions had different cover art and the publishing company put the name of their character first in the title.

Although news outlets and critics initially believed the announcement was a joke, &quot;Archie Meets the Punisher&quot; received mostly positive responses. Many critics praised the odd pairing as an interesting narrative hook. Because of its success, Marvel participated in more crossovers with other publishing companies and Archie began a tradition of meeting unexpected guest stars such as Kiss, Sharknado, and the Predator.

==Publication history==
===Background===
All-American teenager Archie Andrews first appeared in a backup feature in the adventure comic &quot;Pep Comics&quot; #22, published by MLJ Magazines in December 1941. Archie was popular enough to receive a dedicated monthly comic series less than a year after his debut. This started a trend of teen humor comic books and the publisher renamed itself after the character in 1947. By the early 1950s, the character&#x27;s appeal warranted seven concurrent monthly comic titles. Over the next four decades, Archie Comics Publications rarely published material outside the teen humor genre, and most of its attempts to do so were short-lived and commercially unsuccessful. By the 1990s, Archie had a strong presence in magazine outlets such as supermarkets, but was struggling in comic specialty shops where the clientele was more interested in adventure stories.

The murderous vigilante the Punisher first appeared as an antagonist in &quot;The Amazing Spider-Man&quot; #129, published by Marvel Comics in February 1974. Fans found the character interesting and he continued to guest star in other Marvel comics. In 1987, Marvel gave him an ongoing series, &quot;The Punisher&quot;, which became one of Marvel&#x27;s biggest successes of the decade. By the mid-1990s, Punisher had become one of Marvel&#x27;s most popular characters and was appearing in three concurrent monthly comic titles.

===Development===

During the 1990s, intercompany crossovers were a popular trend in the American comic book industry and management at Archie Comics wanted to participate to raise its visibility in specialty comic shops and boost sales. During a lunch in San Diego, top Archie editor Victor Gorelick discussed possibilities with writers Batton Lash and David Scroggy. After considering crossovers with Superman&#x27;s friend Jimmy Olsen or Spider-Man, Gorelick mentioned the Punisher as a joke. Lash immediately saw potential in the idea and gave a rough explanation for how it would work. Gorelick liked the pitch and asked for a formal proposal. Lash did not think Gorelick&#x27;s interest was sincere and forgot about it until he received a follow-up phone call sometime later asking if the proposal was ready.

The origin of the concept is unclear. In 1994, &quot;Hero Illustrated&quot; reported the idea was first proposed by a fan at San Diego Comic-Con. Other sources, such as the 2013 book &quot;Icons of the American Comic Book&quot;, have said it was inspired by a gag on the cover of an issue of the trade publication &quot;The Comics Journal&quot;. &quot;Comic Book Resources&quot; calls this a legend and claims a meeting between Archie and Punisher was a long-running joke between Gorelick and his friend Tom DeFalco, Marvel&#x27;s editor-in-chief. In his introduction to the comic book, Gorelick claims to have pitched a different version of the story to Archie publishers Richard Goldwater and Michael Skilberkleit prior to mentioning the idea to Lash. Reed Tucker wrote in his 2017 book &quot;Slugfest&quot; that it was conceived by Gorelick and &quot;Punisher&quot; editor Dan Daley. Lash gives credit for the idea solely to Gorelick.
Lash&#x27;s original outline was about one page long. Prior to this comic book, Lash had not written either character, and was not a fan of the Punisher. He modeled it on the 1948 film &quot;Abbott and Costello Meet Frankenstein&quot;, which he felt was true to the spirit of both the comedy team and the horror monsters that it featured. Gorelick sent the proposal to DeFalco, who shared it with Daley and Mark Gruenwald, another editor. It was Marvel&#x27;s first intercompany crossover in years. Fearing the project might be derailed if too many people learned about it, only seven people at Marvel were told about the crossover, which was referred to internally as &quot;Project A&quot;. It was formally announced at a press function at the Empire Diner in New York City shortly before publication. The novelty of the unlikely crossover drew attention from general news media, and NPR aired an interview between &quot;Weekend Edition&quot; host Scott Simon and Lash on Saturday, July 9, 1994 discussing the project.

The artwork was split between regular &quot;Archie&quot; penciller Stan Goldberg and longtime Marvel artist John Buscema. Each artist was responsible for drawing the characters and backgrounds associated with their company&#x27;s intellectual property, ensuring the characters&#x27; appearances remained true to their traditional styles. Tom Palmer did the inking for both artists to prevent the two styles from clashing. Goldberg liked the art arrangement because he had always been a fan of Buscema. The only editorial interference came from Gorelick, who objected to the Punisher shooting a thug during a school dance. The scene was changed to have the Punisher hit the thug with a cake instead.

===Publication===
In June 1994, two versions of the comic book were published with an August 1994 cover date. One was published by Archie with cover copy reading &quot;Archie Meets the Punisher&quot; and a $2.95 retail price (with an accompanying $3.75 edition distributed on Canadian newsstands). The other, published by Marvel, was titled &quot;The Punisher Meets Archie&quot;. The Marvel version featured a cover enhanced with a die-cut window and a design that paid homage to the cover of &quot;Amazing Spider-Man&quot; #129. It had a retail price of $3.95. Both versions contained the same 48-page interior story and were ad-free except for two subscription offers, one from each company. The Marvel edition also included the pencil artwork for the Archie edition and a bonus pin-up image of the Punisher and Archie.

==Plot==
When a drug smuggler known as &quot;Red&quot; becomes a fugitive after agreeing to turn state&#x27;s evidence to the United States government, the government asks the Punisher to locate and return him alive. Red escapes from the Punisher in New York City, fleeing to Riverdale, where he adopts a new alias and uses his legitimate business interests to take shelter at the home of wealthy industrialist Hiram Lodge, who is unaware of Red&#x27;s criminal history. Red draws the attention of Hiram&#x27;s teenage daughter Veronica because his appearance is very similar to her frequent suitor, Archie Andrews. To get back at Archie for accidentally ruining their date to the school dance that night, Veronica asks Red to take her instead.

Meanwhile, the Punisher and his partner Microchip track Red to Riverdale and are cynical about the town&#x27;s innocent demeanor. They see Archie with his friend Jughead Jones in an ice cream shop and believe him to be Red. While they are observing him, some thugs from New York arrive and make the same mistake. The thugs know about Red&#x27;s deal with the government and intend to kill him before he can testify. They abduct Archie and Jughead, prompting a car chase as the Punisher attempts to rescue &quot;Red&quot;. After a car wreck, the Punisher quickly realizes his error and lets Archie go. The Punisher and Microchip continue to secretly monitor Archie, hoping the remaining thugs will make the same mistake and come into the open.

As Red and Veronica arrive at the school dance, Red is recognized by a stage worker and low-level drug dealer who, hoping to improve his standing among the cartel, calls them and tells them where to find Red. The Punisher and Microchip, who have been monitoring the cartel, also head for the dance. Meanwhile, Archie is told Veronica went to the dance with someone who looks like him, and realizing that she is with a criminal, he too goes to the dance.

The Punisher sneaks into the school and realizes Riverdale truly is as innocent as it appears. Determined to prevent it from being corrupted by Red or other forces, he disguises himself as a chaperone and, while looking for Red, identifies the thugs, who have dressed up as caterers. As Archie arrives, the thugs mistake him for Red again and move in to kill him. The Punisher uses non-lethal methods to disarm and incapacitate them and clears the misunderstanding with Archie, but Red escapes with Veronica as a hostage.

Red forces Veronica to call her father for ransom, but she takes the opportunity to use code words to let Archie know that she&#x27;s being held in a specific warehouse. Archie and his friends accompany the Punisher to rescue her. At the warehouse, the Punisher reveals to Red that the informant who called the cartel to the dance has agreed to testify and Red is no longer needed alive. During the subsequent scuffle, Red accidentally triggers the automatic doors that open the warehouse roof and gets his foot tangled in a rope attached to a large parade balloon. As the balloon floats away with Red attached, the Punisher considers killing him, but does not. Before leaving Riverdale for Gotham City the next morning, the Punisher and Microchip say goodbye to Archie and his friends.

==Critical reception==
Many people thought the crossover was a joke when it was first announced, but it was surprisingly successful. Most critics cited contrasting characters as an appealing element, with &quot;Pop Matters&quot; calling the combination a &quot;captivating storytelling device&quot; that made for a &quot;remarkable Punisher story and a fitting Archie story&quot;. That sentiment was shared by &quot;Hero Illustrated&quot; and &quot;Comic Book Resources&quot;, with the latter going on to call the portrayal of Riverdale as a &quot;bastion of innocence&quot; that needed the Punisher&#x27;s non-lethal protection &quot;brilliant&quot;. The combination of artwork by Goldberg and Buscema heightened &quot;the clashing sensibilities and themes&quot; for &quot;Pop Matters&quot;, concluding its review by calling &quot;Archie Meets the Punisher&quot; &quot;the best crossover in the history of the comic medium&quot;. &quot;Critical Blast&quot; found some parts of the story to be &quot;surprisingly serious&quot;, but &quot;Comic Book Resources&quot; thought the constant slapstick comedy prevented the comic from being anything but a novelty.

===Legacy===
Since &quot;Archie Meets the Punisher&quot;, the Archie characters have had a tradition of team-ups with characters from other fictional universes, such as &quot;Archie Meets KISS&quot; (2012), &quot;Archie Meets Glee&quot; (2013), and &quot;Archie vs. Sharknado&quot; (2015). &quot;Geek.com&quot; felt that &quot;Archie Meets the Punisher&quot; was the gold standard for unlikely crossovers until being replaced by &quot;Archie vs. Predator&quot; in 2015. Marvel also continued with intercompany crossovers, starting with a meeting between the Punisher and the DC Comics character Batman in August 1994. In 2017, Tucker said that &quot;Archie Meets the Punisher&quot; remained one of Marvel&#x27;s most left-field books.

The comic continued to surprise readers decades after it was published. As late as 2015, young fans and fans new to comics would still ask Lash if the comic really existed.

<text>USS &quot;John L. Hall&quot; (FFG-32), twenty-sixth ship of the &quot;Oliver Hazard Perry&quot; class of guided-missile frigates, was named for Admiral John L. Hall, Jr. (1891–1978). Her mission is to provide in-depth protection for military and merchant shipping, amphibious task forces, and underway replenishment groups.

Ordered from Bath Iron Works, Bath, Maine, on 23 January 1978 as part of the FY78 program, &quot;John L. Hall&quot; was laid down on 5 January 1981, launched on 24 July 1981, and commissioned on 26 June 1982.

On 20 June 1989, &quot;John L. Hall&quot; got underway with for a transit of the Atlantic Ocean to participate in Anti-Submarine Warfare Operations (Operation ROJO) in the north and east Atlantic Ocean. Operation ROJO lasted 41 days. While underway, the ships were under the command of Destroyer Squadron 32. Both ships held contact on two Soviet submarines for an extended period of time.

On 8 March 1990, &quot;John L. Hall&quot; deployed to the Mediterranean Sea. Noteworthy operations included Operation Fox Chase and Operation World Cup in which the ship successfully tracked a Soviet Victor I-class submarine for extended periods of time on both occasions. On 7 August 1990, during deployment Med 2-90 and serving with the &quot;Eisenhower&quot; Battle Group as part of the United States Sixth Fleet, USS &quot;John L. Hall&quot;, under the command of Commander Bruce P. McClure, sortied from Haifa Bay for Port Said. With Iraq&#x27;s invasion of Kuwait, &quot;John L. Hall&quot; was called to transit the Suez Canal along with , , USNS &quot;Neosho&quot;, and in support of Operation Desert Shield. &quot;John L. Hall&quot;″s participation included &quot;gate guard&quot; duties to support the United Nations sanctions against Iraq and anti-air coverage for U.S. Navy assets. The ship also escorted USNS &quot;Neosho&quot; through the Straits of Bab-el-Mandeb to Djibouti for her shore bunkering before returning through the Strait to refuel the &quot;Eisenhower&quot; Battle Group in the Red Sea. During the deployment, USS &quot;John L. Hall&quot; held over 200 hours of contact time with submerged submarines using the SQR 19 towed array sonar, and over 800 hours of flight time with the LAMPS MK III SH-60B helicopter detachment from HSL-46.

On 28 August 2005, under the command of Commander David Geisler, she sailed from her home port, NS Pascagoula, Mississippi, along with sister ship &quot;Stephen W. Groves&quot; under threat from Hurricane Katrina.

In 2007, she remained active, commanded by Commander Augustus P. Bennet, assigned to Destroyer Squadron 14, and homeported at Naval Station Mayport. In August 2008, while underway to avoid Tropical Storm Fay, the scheduled change of command occurred with Commander Derek Lavan assuming command of the vessel.

21 April 2010, the &quot;John L. Hall&quot; was seen docked in Sevastopol (UA).

On 22 June 2010, then CO Commander Herman Pfaeffle was relieved of command after striking a pier on 16 April 2010 in Batumi in the republic of Georgia

On 9 March 2012, the &quot;John L. Hall&quot; was decommissioned at Naval Station Mayport and moved to the Naval Inactive Ship Maintenance Facility in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, where it was laid up. It was subsequently sold to International Shipbreaking Ltd. of Brownsville, Texas and departed under tow to the scrappers on 6 December 2022, arriving on 19 December 2022.

<text>Alternative worship is &quot;what happens when people create worship for themselves,&quot; according to Steve Collins. As a phenomenon it began mainly in Europe, Australia and New Zealand in the late 1980s and early 1990s. It is practiced by Christians across the age-range, although has a particular following amongst adults in their 20s and 30s.

Alternative Worship usually refers to an approach to Christian worship and worship planning that emphasizes decentralized leadership, congregational participation, multi-sensory experience, ritual and narrative form. It is often discussed in contrast to Contemporary worship or &quot;Youth&quot; services. In fact it is (arguably) in part a reaction &quot;against&quot;, or a development beyond evangelical or charismatic forms of worship. It tends to use popular (secular) music forms in place of Christian worship songs, and more casual talks in place of the traditional sermon. Alternative Worship often does not have an obvious leader or stage, and may not involve singing or lecture-style presentations at all.

Alternative worship services often feature elements from ancient Christian spirituality and liturgy, such as a labyrinth, a kyrie, candle lighting and the sacraments in combination with very new elements, like projected images or video and/or electronic music.

Terms that are more appropriate to the approach used in these services would be Holistic Worship, Multisensory worship or Creative Worship.

Alternative worship is often associated with the Emerging Church.
