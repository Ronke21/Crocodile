<text>Industria de Diseño Textil, S.A. (Inditex; , ; ) is a Spanish multinational clothing company headquartered in Arteixo, Galicia, Spain. Inditex, the biggest fast fashion group in the world, operates over 7,200 stores in 93 markets worldwide. The company&#x27;s flagship brand is Zara, but it also owns a number of other brands including Zara Home, Bershka, Massimo Dutti, Oysho, Pull&amp;Bear, Stradivarius, Uterqüe and Lefties. The majority of its stores are corporate-owned, while franchises are mainly conceded in countries where corporate properties cannot be foreign-owned.

Inditex&#x27;s business is centred around one simple premise – to be quick at responding to the market. Whereas it would take almost a year for a traditional fashion company to get its products out, from conception to runway to stores, for Inditex, this process takes less than two months to replenish stores with new and different products weekly and respond quickly. In Zara stores, it can take a new garment as little as 15 days to go from design and production to store shelves.

The Uyghur Rights Monitor, Sheffield Hallam University, and the Uyghur Center for Democracy and Human Rights have accused the company of using Uyghur forced labour through the Chinese based textile supplier Beijing Guanghua textile group.

==History==

===1960s and 1970s===
In the early 1960s Amancio Ortega started his own business in the clothing industry while working for a local shirt maker in A Coruña, Spain. Ortega began developing his designs and he and his wife Rosalia Mera started making clothes in their home. Amancio had saved up enough money to open a small factory and sold garments to his former employer, amongst others.

In 1975, the couple opened their first store, Zara, which produced popular fashion at low prices. The following year, Zara was incorporated and began opening more stores and factories in Spain. Later that year, after noticing the growing importance of computers, Ortega hired a local professor, José María Castellano, to develop the company&#x27;s computing power.

===1980–2000===
In the 1980s, the company implemented a new design and distribution method that drastically reduced the time between design, production, and arrival at retail sites. The system was designed by Castellano, who became the company&#x27;s CEO in 1984. In 1985, Industria de Diseño Textil S.A. or Inditex was created as a holding company for Zara and its manufacturing plants. In 1988, the company began expanding internationally with the opening of a Zara store in Porto, Portugal. In 1990, the company-owned footwear collection, Tempe, populated in the children&#x27;s section of Zara stores. In 1991, Inditex created the company Pull and Bear, a casual menswear company. Later that year, the company also acquired a 65 per cent share in the upscale Massimo Dutti brand. Inditex created Lefties in 1993; the name is taken from the term leftovers and it was created to sell old Zara clothing. In 1995, Inditex purchased the remaining Massimo Dutti shares and began expanding the brand to include a women&#x27;s line. In 1998, Inditex launched the Bershka brand that was aimed at urban hip fashion. The company bought Stradivarius in 1999, a youthful female fashion brand.

===2001–present===
Inditex had its initial public offering (IPO) in 2001, on the Bolsa de Madrid. The IPO sold 26 per cent of the company to public investors, the company was valued at €9 billion. The same year, the company launched the lingerie and women&#x27;s clothing store Oysho.

In 2003, Inditex launched the Zara Home brand, which offers bedding, cutlery, glassware and other home decoration accessories. In 2004, with the opening of store number 2,000 in Hong Kong, Inditex had established its presence in 56 countries.

In 2005, CEO Jose Maria Castellano stepped down from the position to oversee expansion plans, he was replaced by Pablo Isla. Inditex launched Uterque in the summer of 2008, the brand specializes in women&#x27;s accessories. During the same year, the company opened its 4,000th store in Tokyo after doubling in size within four years. In 2011, Ortega, the founder of the business and majority shareholder, stepped down as deputy chairman and CEO Isla handles day-to-day operations. Later that year, the company opened a store in Australia, a move that would put the company on five continents and in 77 countries. After the 2013 Savar building collapse, Inditex was one of the thirty-eight companies who signed the Accord on Factory and Building Safety in Bangladesh.

As of 2019, Inditex is the biggest fashion retailer in the world by revenue.

The company&#x27;s revenue fell by 18% to $1.85 billion in the final quarter of 2020, primarily due to the fall in retail sales as a result of the coronavirus pandemic. Inditex&#x27;s stocks fell by 12% over the year.

In May 2021, Inditex said that all its stores in Venezuela would close as it will review its agreement with its local partner Phoenix World Trade.

In the three months to 30 April 2023, the group reported a 13% increase in sales to £6.54 billion and a 14% rise in profit to £3.96 billion.

==International presence==
In 1989, a year after entering Portugal, the company entered the U.S. market and expanded into France in 1990. Expansion continued to Mexico in 1992 and Greece in 1993. In 1994, Inditex opened stores in Belgium and Sweden. By 1997, the company had expanded to Malta, Cyprus, Norway and Israel. In 1998, expansion continued to the UK, Turkey, Argentina, Venezuela, the Middle East and Japan. Canada, Germany, Poland, Saudi Arabia and several South American countries received stores in 1999.

The company opened stores in Italy, Luxembourg and Jordan in 2001. In 2003, Inditex opened stores in Russia, Slovakia and Malaysia. The following year Latvia, Hungary, and Panama amongst other countries where stores opened, including the 2,000th store in Hong Kong. By 2006, the company had expanded into mainland China. In 2010, the company opened their 5,000th location in Rome and its first in India. The first stores in Australia and South Africa opened in 2011. The company&#x27;s expansion continued to the Serbia, North Macedonia, Armenia, Ecuador, Georgia and Bosnia-Herzegovina in 2012. In 2014, Inditex opened stores in Albania. In 2016, Inditex announced that they planned to open stores in Vietnam, New Zealand, Paraguay, Aruba and Nicaragua.

==Online sales==
In 2007, Inditex launched the Zara Home online retail store. Zara joined the e-commerce marketplace in September 2010, launching websites in Spain, the UK, Portugal, Italy, Germany and France. In November 2010, Zara&#x27;s online presence grew to include Austria, Ireland, the Netherlands, Belgium and Luxembourg. In September 2011, Inditex brought Zara&#x27;s e-commerce platform to the U.S., as well as adding the brands Pull and Bear, Massimo Dutti, Bershka, Stadivarius, Oysho and Uterqüe to the e-commerce space. As of February 2016, Inditex operates e-commerce sites in 28 markets and plans to add 12 more by April. In September 2018, Inditex announced to sell all its brands online by 2020, even in places where it does not own any stores.

==Marketing strategy==
Inditex avoids magazine advertising, with print campaigns only occurring on billboards in certain regions like U.S. and in-store. Endorsements for celebrities to wear its labels are budgeted instead. The company also invests heavily in a prime commercial location with fashion-forward window displays for optimum high street visibility and product turnaround.

==Plagiarism==
Zara has been accused of copying artwork.

In 2017, Zara Home Belgium was convicted of plagiarism by a Brussels Court, which was claimed to have been the first plagiarism conviction of a fast retailer.

==Brands==
Under the Inditex umbrella are several brands that offer a variety of products aimed at different markets.

<doc id="725770" wikidata="Q1045864" url="?curid=725770" title="Justin S. Morrill">
<text>Justin Smith Morrill (April 14, 1810December 28, 1898) was an American politician and entrepreneur who represented Vermont in the United States House of Representatives (1855–1867) and United States Senate (1867–1898). He is most widely remembered for Morrill Land-Grant Acts that provided federal funding for establishing many of the United States&#x27; public colleges and universities following a movement led by Jonathan Baldwin Turner. He is also remembered for the Morrill Tariff. Originally a Whig, after that party became defunct Morrill was one of the founders of the Republican Party.

A native of Strafford, Vermont, Morrill was educated in the schools of Strafford, Thetford Academy and Randolph Academy. He worked as a merchant&#x27;s clerk in Maine and Vermont, then embarked on a business career. In partnership with Jedediah H. Harris, Morrill owned and operated several stores in towns throughout Vermont. The success of his stores enabled Morrill to invest profitably in a farm, banks, railroads, and real estate.

Morrill was active in politics as a Whig, and was elected to Congress in 1854. The party became defunct soon afterwards, and Morrill was a founder of the new Republican Party. He won reelection to the U.S. House every two years from 1856 to 1864, and he served from March 1857 to March 1867. During his House service, Morrill served as chairman of the Ways and Means Committee and the House Republican Conference.

In 1866, Morrill was elected to the U.S. Senate, and he served from March 1867 until his death. During his Senate career, Morrill was chairman of the Senate Finance Committee and the Joint Committee on Public Buildings. Morrill died in Washington, D.C., on December 28, 1898. He was buried at Strafford Cemetery.

==Early life==
Morrill was born in Strafford, Vermont, on April 14, 1810, the son of Mary Hunt (Proctor) Morrill and Nathaniel Morrill, a farmer, blacksmith, and militia leader who attained the rank of colonel. Morrill attended the common schools of Strafford, Thetford Academy and Randolph Academy. He then trained for a business career by working as a merchant&#x27;s clerk in Strafford and Portland, Maine. He then was a merchant in Strafford, and the partnership in which he participated with Judge Jedediah H. Harris grew to own and operate four stores throughout the state. Morrill also served in local offices including Town Auditor and Justice of the Peace.

One of Judge Harris&#x27;s daughters married Portus Baxter, who also served in Congress. Baxter and Morrill became close friends as a result of the connection to Judge Harris, with Morrill referring to Baxter as &quot;one of nature&#x27;s noblemen&quot; and Baxter consciously patterning his business and political career on Morrill&#x27;s.

Morrill invested in several successful ventures, including banks, railroads, and real estate. By the late 1840s he was financially secure enough to retire, and he became a gentleman farmer.

In addition to farming, Morrill became active in the Whig Party, including serving as chairman of the Orange County Whig Committee, a member of the Vermont State Whig Committee, and a Delegate to the 1852 Whig National Convention.

==Congressional career==

In 1854 Morrill was elected to the Thirty-fourth Congress as a Whig. He was a founder of the Republican Party, and won reelection five times as a Republican, serving from March 4, 1855, to March 3, 1867. He served as chairman of the Committee on Ways and Means in the Thirty-ninth Congress. He also served on the Joint Committee on Reconstruction, which drafted the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution.

In 1866 Morrill was elected to the U.S. Senate as a Union Republican. He was reelected as a Republican in 1872, 1878, 1884, 1890, and 1896, and served from March 4, 1867, until his death, almost thirty-one years. He served as chairman of the Committee on Public Buildings and Grounds (Forty-first through Forty-fourth Congresses) where he played a vital role in obtaining the current Library of Congress main building through his work on the Joint Select Committee on Additional Accommodations for the Library. He also served as chairman of the Committee on Finance (Forty-fifth, Forty-seventh through Fifty-second, Fifty-fourth and Fifty-fifth Congresses). In addition, Morrill was a regent of the Smithsonian Institution from 1883 to 1898 and a trustee of the University of Vermont from 1865 to 1898.

==Legislation==

The Morrill Tariff of 1861 was a protective tariff law adopted on March 2, 1861. Passed after anti-tariff southerners had left Congress during the process of secession, Morrill designed it with the advice of Pennsylvania economist Henry C. Carey. It was one of the last acts signed into law by James Buchanan, and replaced the Tariff of 1857. Additional tariffs Morrill sponsored were passed to raise revenue during the American Civil War.

Morrill is best known for sponsoring the Morrill Act, also known as the Land Grant College Act. This act was signed into law by Abraham Lincoln in 1862, and established federal funding for higher education in every state of the country. In his own words:

He also authored the Morrill Anti-Bigamy Act of 1862, which targeted the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, based on the then-existing practice of plural marriage (polygamy). It imposed a five-hundred dollar fine and up to five years imprisonment for the crime of polygamy. On January 6, 1879, in &quot;Reynolds v. United States&quot; the Supreme Court, upheld the Anti-Bigamy Act&#x27;s ban on plural marriage.

While serving in the U.S. House, Morrill secured passage of legislation to establish the National Statuary Hall Collection inside the United States Capitol. Under the provisions of this 1864 law, each state is permitted to provide two statues of noteworthy citizens for display inside the Capitol.

A second Land Grant College Act in 1890 targeted the former Confederate states and led to the creation of several historically black colleges and universities.

The Land Grant College Acts ultimately led to the founding of 106 colleges including many state universities, polytechnic colleges, and agricultural and mechanical colleges.

==Personal Life==

In 1851, Morrill married Ruth Barrell Swan (1822–1898) of Easton, Massachusetts. They had two children. Justin Harris Morrill (1853–1855) died in childhood. James Swan Morrill (1857–1910) graduated from the University of Vermont in 1880 and Columbian College Law School in 1882. He was a lawyer and farmer and served in a variety of offices including as a member of the Vermont House of Representatives. He wrote &quot;Self-Consciousness of Noted Persons&quot;, published in 1886.

Morrill died in Washington, D.C. on December 28, 1898. He was buried at Strafford Cemetery.

At the time of Morrill&#x27;s death his 43 years and 299 days of continuous Congressional service was the longest in U.S. history. He has since been surpassed, but still ranks 31st as of the end of the 118th Congress (December 2024).
==Legacy==

The Justin Smith Morrill Homestead in Strafford is a National Historic Landmark.

Many colleges established under the Morrill Act created a &#x27;Morrill Hall&#x27; in his honor.

Morrill was initiated into the Delta Upsilon fraternity as an honorary member in 1864. He received honorary degrees from the University of Vermont, University of Pennsylvania, Dartmouth College, and many other institutions.

Justin Morrill College at Michigan State University was named for him.

In 1962, the U.S. Postal Service issued a 4 cent postage stamp to celebrate the centennial of the Morrill Land-Grant College Act. In 1999, the Postal Service issued a 55 cent Great Americans series postage stamp of Morrill to honor his role in establishing the land grant colleges.

In 1967 Ohio State University opened two residence halls on its campus. Named for Morrill and Abraham Lincoln, they are also known as The Towers. They are the tallest buildings on the OSU campus, and among the tallest in Columbus Ohio.

<text>Avtozavodskaya (, lit. &quot;auto factory&quot;) is a station on the Zamoskvoretskaya line of the Moscow Metro. It is named for the nearby Zavod Imeni Likhacheva where ZIS and ZIL limousines were built. The train station was opened in 1943, a few months before Novokuznetskaya and Paveletskaya. The architect was Alexey Dushkin. From 1943 to 1969 when Kakhovskaya opened, it was the southern terminus of the line. The station has entrances to Avtozavodskaya and Masterkov streets.

==History==
When the station was opened in 1943, it was named Zavod imeni Stalina after the factory at the site. As part of the destalinization process, the factory&#x27;s name changed to Zavod Imeni Likhacheva in 1956 and the station became Avtozavodskaya. Parts of the former factory have been demolished to accommodate the construction of a residential complex; however, the name remains in place.

Both the tall pillars and walls are faced with pinkish Oraktuoy marble. Additionally, Avtozavodskaya is decorated with eight mosaics depicting events of the Great Patriotic War.

On February 6, 2004, a suicide bomber set off an explosion between Avtozavodskaya and Paveletskaya in which 41 people were killed and 250 were injured.

<doc id="725787" wikidata="Q14746852" url="?curid=725787" title="Journey of the Magi">
<text>&quot;Journey of the Magi&quot; is a 43-line poem written in 1927 by T. S. Eliot (1888–1965). It is one of five poems that Eliot contributed for a series of 38 pamphlets by several authors collectively titled the Ariel Poems and released by the British publishing house Faber and Gwyer (later Faber and Faber). Published in August 1927, &quot;Journey of the Magi&quot; was the eighth in the series and was accompanied by illustrations drawn by American-born avant garde artist Edward McKnight Kauffer (1890–1954). The poems, including &quot;Journey of the Magi&quot;, were later published in both editions of Eliot&#x27;s collected poems in 1936 and 1963.

In the previous year, Eliot had converted to Anglo-Catholicism and his poetry, starting with the &quot;Ariel Poems&quot; (1927–1931) and &quot;Ash Wednesday&quot; (1930), took on a decidedly religious character. In the poem, Eliot retells the story of the biblical Magi who travelled to Bethlehem to visit the newborn Jesus according to the Gospel of Matthew. It is a narrative, told from the point of view of one of the magi, that expresses themes of alienation, regret and a feeling of powerlessness in a world that has changed. The poem&#x27;s dramatic monologue incorporates quotations and literary allusions to works by earlier writers Lancelot Andrewes and Matthew Arnold.

==Writing and publication==

In 1925, Eliot became a poetry editor at the London publishing firm of Faber and Gwyer, Ltd., after a career in banking, and subsequent to the success of his earlier poems, including &quot;The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock&quot; (1915), &quot;Gerontion&quot; (1920) and &quot;The Waste Land&quot; (1922). In these years, Eliot gravitated away from his Unitarian upbringing and began to embrace the Church of England. He was baptised into the Anglican faith on 29 June 1927 at Finstock, in Oxfordshire, and was confirmed the following day in the private chapel of Thomas Banks Strong, Bishop of Oxford. Eliot converted in private, but subsequently declared in his 1927 preface to a collection of essays titled &quot;For Lancelot Andrewes&quot; that he considered himself a classicist in literature, a royalist in politics, and an Anglo-Catholic in religion. When his conversion became known, it was &quot;an understandable choice to those around him&quot; given his intellectual convictions, and that &quot;he could not have done anything less than seek what he regarded as the most ancient, most sacramental, and highest expression of the Christian faith that forms the indisputable basis for the culture and civilization of modern Europe&quot;. Eliot&#x27;s conversion and his adherence to Anglo-Catholicism informed and influenced his later poetry.

Critical reviews of Eliot&#x27;s poems shifted as well, with some critics asserting that Eliot&#x27;s work suffered with the addition of Christian themes. One critic, Morton D. Zabel said that this &quot;deprived his art of its once incomparable distinction in style and tone&quot;. Other critics thought Eliot&#x27;s exploration of Christian themes was a positive development in his poetry, including Gordon Symes, who recognised it as &quot;an evaluation of old age, an elucidation of its special grace, and an appreciation of its special function in the progress of the soul&quot;.

In 1927, Eliot was asked by his employer, Geoffrey Faber, one of the partners in Faber &amp; Gwyer, to write one poem each year for a series of illustrated pamphlets with holiday themes to be sent to the firm&#x27;s clients and business acquaintances as Christmas greetings. This series, called the &quot;Ariel Series&quot;, would release 38 pamphlets from a selection of English writers and poets from 1927 through 1931. The first poem that Eliot wrote, &quot;Journey of the Magi&quot;, was released as the eighth in the series in August 1927. Eliot would follow with four more poems: &quot;A Song for Simeon&quot; in August 1928, &quot;Animula&quot; in October 1929, &quot;Marina&quot; in September 1930, and &quot;Triumphal March&quot; in October 1931. Four of Eliot&#x27;s five &quot;Ariel&quot; poems, including &quot;Journey of the Magi&quot;, were accompanied by illustrations by American-born avant garde artist, E. McKnight Kauffer.

Faber &amp; Gwyer, Ltd., printed the &quot;Journey of the Magi&quot; in a 7¼&quot; × 4 ¾&quot;, Octavo (8vo) pamphlet &quot;line block in black with brown and grey; casing, thin card covered with yellow laid paper.&quot; The font of the cover and poem text was &quot;Imprint&quot; created by Gerard Meynell &amp; J. H. Mason in 1913 for the printing trade magazine &quot;The Imprint&quot;. The poem was printed on two pages, accompanied a colour images by Kauffer, and included one page of advertisements. Faber &amp; Gwyer contracted with the Curwen Press in Plaistow to print 5,000 copies. There was a limited edition of 350 copies that was printed &quot;on Zanders&#x27; hand-made paper&quot;. According to Gilmour, the edition was printed &quot;in batches of eight.&quot; A yellow cover was used for Eliot&#x27;s poem after Curwen&#x27;s designer Paul Nash objected for its use in the seventh Ariel pamphlet, Siegfried Sassoon&#x27;s &quot;Nativity&quot;.

In 1936, Faber &amp; Faber, the successor firm to Faber &amp; Gwyer, collected &quot;Journey of the Magi&quot; and three of the other poems under the heading &quot;Ariel Poems&quot; for an edition of Eliot&#x27;s collected poems. (&quot;Triumphal March&quot; appears as Section 1 of &quot;Coriolan&quot; in the &quot;Unfinished Poems&quot; section.) When Faber released another series in 1954, Eliot included a sixth poem, &quot;The Cultivation of Christmas Trees&quot;, illustrated by artist and poet David Jones, which was added to Faber&#x27;s 1963 edition of his collected poems. Both editions of collected poems were published in the United States by Harcourt, Brace &amp; Company.

All six poems were published together as a separate publication for the first time by Faber &amp; Faber in 2014. This publication included the original illustrations.

==Interpretation and analysis==
The poem is an account of the journey from the point of view of one of the biblical Magi. The events are narrated in the first person, by an eyewitness with experience of the tale. The poem picks up Eliot&#x27;s consistent theme of alienation, regret and a feeling of powerlessness in a world that has changed. In this regard, with a speaker who laments outliving his world, the poem recalls Arnold&#x27;s &quot;Dover Beach&quot;, as well as a number of Eliot&#x27;s own works. Instead of a celebration of the wonders of the journey, the poem is largely a complaint about a journey that was painful and tedious. It begins with five lines adapted from a passage in the &quot;Nativity Sermon&quot; preached by Lancelot Andrewes, the Bishop of Winchester, before James I on Christmas Day 1622. Andrewes&#x27; original text reads &quot;A cold coming they had of it at this time of the year, just the worst time of the year to take a journey, and specially a long journey. The ways deep, the weather sharp, the days short, the sun farthest off, &quot;in solsitio brumali&quot;, the very dead of winter.&quot; This opening recollection by the magus sets off the reflections which follow. The speaker says that a voice was always whispering in their ears as they went that &quot;this was all folly&quot;. The magus seems generally unimpressed by the infant, and yet realizes that the Incarnation has changed everything. He asks,

:&quot;. . . were we led all that way for
:Birth or Death?&quot;

The birth of Christ was the death of the world of magic, astrology, and paganism (cf Colossians 2:20). The speaker, recalling his journey in old age, suggests that after that birth his world had died, and he had little to do but wait for his own death.

The poem maintains Eliot&#x27;s long habit of using the dramatic monologue – a form he inherited and adapted from Robert Browning. The speaker of the poem is in agitation and speaks to the reader directly. His revelations are accidental and born out of his emotional distress. As with other works, Eliot chooses an elderly speaker – someone who is world-weary, reflective, and sad (cf. &quot;The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock&quot;, &quot;Gerontion&quot;, the Tiresias narrator of &quot;The Waste Land&quot;, and possibly the narrator of &quot;The Hollow Men&quot;). His narrator in this poem is a witness to historical change who seeks to rise above his historical moment, a man who, despite material wealth and prestige, has lost his spiritual bearings.

The poem has a number of symbolist elements, where an entire philosophical position is summed up by the manifestation of a single image. For example, the narrator says that on the journey they saw &quot;three trees against a low sky&quot;; the image suggesting the historical and spiritual future of the crucifixion (the skies lowered and heaven opened).

<text>A dashboard (also called dash, instrument panel or IP, or fascia) is a control panel set within the central console of a vehicle, boat, or cockpit of an aircraft or spacecraft. Usually located directly ahead of the driver (or pilot), it displays instrumentation and controls for the vehicle&#x27;s operation. An electronic equivalent may be called an electronic instrument cluster, digital instrument panel, digital dash, digital speedometer or digital instrument cluster&quot;.&quot; By analogy, a succinct display of various types of related visual data in one place is also called a dashboard.

==Etymology==
Originally, the word &quot;dashboard&quot; applied to a barrier of wood or leather fixed at the front of a horse-drawn carriage or sleigh to protect the driver from mud or other debris &quot;dashed up&quot; (thrown up) by the horses&#x27; hooves. The first known use of the term (hyphenated as &quot;dash-board&quot;, and applied to sleighs) dates from 1847. Commonly these boards did not perform any additional function other than providing a convenient handhold for ascending into the driver&#x27;s seat, or a small clip with which to secure the reins when not in use.

When the first &quot;horseless carriages&quot; were constructed in the late 19th century, with engines mounted beneath the driver such as the Daimler Stahlradwagen, the simple dashboard was retained to protect occupants from debris thrown up by the cars&#x27; front wheels. However, as car design evolved to position the motor in front of the driver, the dashboard became a panel that protected vehicle occupants from the heat and oil of the engine. With gradually increasing mechanical complexity, this panel formed a convenient location for the placement of gauges and minor controls, and from this evolved the modern instrument panel, although retaining its archaic common name.

The first mass-produced automobile, the Oldsmobile Curved Dash, got its name from its dashboard, which was curved like that of a sleigh.

== Dashboard features==
Where the dashboard originally included an array of simple controls (e.g., the steering wheel) and instrumentation to show speed, fuel level and oil pressure, the modern dashboard may accommodate a broad array of gauges, and controls as well as information, climate control and entertainment systems.

Contemporary dashboards may include the speedometer, tachometer, odometer, engine coolant temperature gauge, and fuel gauge, turn indicators, gearshift position indicator, seat belt warning light, parking-brake warning light, and engine-malfunction lights. Heavy vehicles that feature air brakes, such as trucks and buses will also have gauges to indicate the available air pressure in the braking system. Other features may include a gauge for alternator voltage, indicators for low fuel, low oil pressure, low tire pressure and faults in the airbag (SRS) systems, glove compartment, ashtray and a cigarette lighter or power outletas well as heating and ventilation systems, lighting controls, safety systems, entertainment equipment and information systems, e.g., navigation systems.

==Padding and safety==
In 1937, Chrysler, Dodge, DeSoto, and Plymouth cars came with a safety dashboard that was flat, raised above knee height, and had all the controls mounted flush.

Padded dashboards were advocated in the 1930s by car safety pioneer Claire L. Straith. In 1948, the Tucker 48 became the first car with a padded dashboard.

One of the safety enhancements of the 1970s was the widespread adoption of padded dashboards. The padding is commonly polyurethane foam, while the surface is commonly either polyvinyl chloride (PVC) or leather in the case of luxury models.

In the early and mid-1990s, airbags became a standard feature of steering wheels and dashboards.

==Fashion in instrumentation==

In the 1940s through the 1960s, American car manufacturers and their imitators designed aesthetically shaped instruments on a dashboard accented with chrome and transparent plastic, which could be less readable, but was often thought to be more stylish. Sunlight could cause a bright glare on the chrome, particularly for a convertible. On North American vehicles in particular, this trend lingered on until the late-1980s, which still featured dashboards with wood and fake chrome embellishment along with square instruments – long after European and Japanese manufacturers had long embraced a plainer, more functional and austere approach for dashboard and instrument panel design.

With the advent of the VFD, LED and LCD in consumer electronics, some manufacturers used instruments with digital readouts to make their cars appear more up to date. Some cars use a head-up display to project the speed of the car onto the windscreen in imitation of fighter aircraft, but in a far less complex display.

In recent years, spurred on by the growing aftermarket use of dash kits, many automakers have taken the initiative to add more stylistic elements to their dashboards. One prominent example of this is the Chevrolet Sonic which offers both exterior (e.g., a custom graphics package) and interior cosmetic upgrades. In addition to OEM dashboard trim and upgrades a number of companies offer domed polyurethane or vinyl applique dash trim accent kits or &quot;dash kits&quot;.

Manufacturers such as BMW, Honda, Toyota and Mercedes-Benz have included fuel-economy gauges in some instrument clusters, showing fuel mileage in real time, which was limited mainly to luxury vehicles and later, hybrids. Following a focus on increasing fuel economy in the late 2000s along with increased technology, most vehicles in the 2010s now come with either real-time or average mileage readouts on their dashboards. The ammeter was the gauge of choice for monitoring the state of the charging system until the 1970s. Later it was replaced by the voltmeter. Today most family vehicles have warning lights instead of voltmeters or oil pressure gauges in their dashboard instrument clusters, though sports cars often have proper gauges for performance purposes and driver appeasement along with larger trucks, mainly to monitor system function during heavy usage such as towing or off-road usage.

==Electronic instrument cluster==


In an automobile, an electronic instrument cluster, digital instrument panel or &quot;digital dash&quot; for short, is a set of instrumentation, including the speedometer, that is displayed with a digital readout rather than with the traditional analog gauges. Many refer to it either simply as a &quot;digital speedometer&quot; or a &quot;digital instrument cluster.&quot;

===History===

The first application of an electronic instrument cluster, in a production automobile, was in the 1976 Aston Martin Lagonda. The first American manufacturer application was the 1978 Cadillac Seville with available Cadillac Trip Computer. In the United States they were an option in many motor vehicles manufactured in the 1980s and 1990s, and were standard on some luxury vehicles at times, including some models made by Cadillac, Chrysler and Lincoln. They included not only a speedometer with a digital readout, but also a trip computer that displayed factors like the outdoor temperature, travel direction, fuel economy and distance to empty (DTE). In 1983, the Renault 11 Electronic was the first European hatchback to have a digital dashboard. Many vehicles made today have an analog speedometer paired with the latter in digital form. In the late 1980s into the early 1990s, General Motors had touch-screen CRTs with features such as date books and hands-free cell phone integration built into cars such as the Oldsmobile Toronado, Buick Riviera and Buick Reatta.

===Advantages and drawbacks ===
When accelerating, digital speedometers generally step through a freeze frame of whole numbers at a constant sample rate. It is as precise as the number displaced, whereas a gauged speedometer pointer could sweep through an infinite range between its major markings at 10 mph or 20 km/h intervals. The latter provides a sense of continuous acceleration albeit with less precision: a gauge reading could only be estimated to the pointer&#x27;s nearest halfway point between the markings.

The first digital instrument clusters were considered to be unpopular during the years when they were widely produced, and were heavily criticized by reviewers in automotive magazines. Some of the criticism they received was as follows:
*They were hard to see in the strong sunlight or other bright light
*They took away the sense of continuous acceleration that is provided by an analog speedometer. 
*They were expensive to repair in the event of a malfunction

As a result of these issues, digital instrument panels were phased out of vehicles throughout the 1990s, and have been replaced with traditional analog gauges in most vehicles (with notable exceptions from French manufacturers Renault and Citroën), including those from luxury divisions. However, many vehicles are made today with a standard or optional trip computer located independently from the speedometer.

Digital units received information from a variety of sensors installed throughout the engine and transmission, while traditional analog units were attached to a cable that provided information from the transmission. Modern analog displays receive information in the same manner as the digital units, with very few manufacturers still using the speedometer cable method.

In the 2000s, digital speedometers were produced in some hybrid vehicles, including the Toyota Prius and Honda Insight.

Most digital speedometers have had green numbers displayed on a dark green or black background. The 8th and 9th generation Honda Civic have a &quot;two-tier&quot; instrument panel. The upper digital dashboard with white numbers against a blue screen (the latter of which changes to green according to driving habits), digital fuel and temperature gauges. The lower dashboard has an analog tachometer and digital odometer. The 10th and present generation saw the two-tier design replaced with a single instrument panel, which in higher tiers is a fully digital and partially customizable design.

Since the mid-2010s and early 2020s, fully customizable digital instrument clusters have become popular. The modern implementation allows the driver to choose which information to project where and how in the instrument cluster, such as navigation aid, connected phone information and blind spot camera view. The customization can also reduce distraction for the driver and allow the manufacturer to use the same hardware in different models while retaining differentiation between models.

Automotive head-up displays have seen applications in several cars, augmenting analog gauges with a digital readout on the windshield glass.

==== LCDs ====
Vehicle instruments have been augmented by software-powered display panels conveying information on display panels. Digital instruments present data in the form of numeric parameters, textual messages, or graphical gauges. Unlike the electro-mechanical instrument clusters of the past, these interactive displays are much more versatile and flexible.

Many modern motorcycles are now equipped with digital speedometers, most often these are sports bikes.

Toyota is using electronic instruments for showing the cars parameters for its Yaris/Vitz model, the car employs a vacuum fluorescent display to indicate the speed, RPM, fuel level, odometer, etc.

For the 2011 model year, Chrysler began using a common dashboard across their model line that has an integrated trip computer in addition to the analog gauges. This trip computer can also be used to show a digital speedometer, making these hybrid digital-analog dashboards. the speedometer needle to be too wide, they are relying on the digital speedometer more than the analog gauge.

The French manufacturer Citroën, is using digital indicators as speedometer for many models in its range, including the C2, C3, C4 and C6.

;High resolution displays
The 2007 Lamborghini Reventon introduced one of the first high resolution LCD displays used on a production vehicle. A trend setter that would be taken seriously by mainstream manufacturers on years to come and become a selling point of consideration during the next following decade.

The 2009 Lexus LFA was one of the first cars to use a modern LCD screen. Lexus claimed a digital speedometer was required since an analogue tachometer wouldn&#x27;t be able to keep up with the rev changes of the car&#x27;s engine. This statement however was mainly marketing-driven; there is no technical reason why an analog needle would not keep up with the (far heavier) engine itself.

The third generation Range Rover (L322) also introduced the first use and largest TFT LCD displays used on a production luxury SUV for the facelifted 2010, and end of the cycle model. A trend setter that would follow further adaptation from other manufacturers.

In 2014, Audi launched its &#x27;virtual cockpit&#x27; on Audi TT, and has later introduced it to several other models. The technology has been developed together with the Finnish company Rightware, using its Kanzi software suite.

=== Railway applications ===
Electronic instrument clusters are being increasingly common features on railway vehicles, in which individual instruments are replaced by various forms of digital readouts. Early uses of instrument clusters often employed LEDs to display analog-type or numeric readings for pressure gauges, electrical gauges, and other displays. They have been increasingly integrated with various cab signalling systems and together with the installation of multi-function displays, have simplified the cab layout and improved user interaction with the engineer.

<doc id="725810" wikidata="Q7741877" url="?curid=725810" title="The Indian in the Cupboard">
<text>The Indian in the Cupboard is a low fantasy children&#x27;s novel by the British writer Lynne Reid Banks. It was published in 1980 with illustrations by Robin Jacques (UK) and Brock Cole (US). It was later adapted as a 1995 children&#x27;s film of the same name. Later books in the series were illustrated by Piers Sanford.

The original book was followed by four sequels: &quot;The Return of the Indian&quot; (1985); &quot;The Secret of the Indian&quot; (1989); &quot;The Mystery of the Cupboard&quot; (1993); and &quot;The Key to the Indian&quot; (1998). All were published by Doubleday Books in hardcover, then by Avon Books, now HarperCollins, in paperback. There have been multiple reprints in various formats, including movie tie-in editions. The publisher recommended reading level is age nine and up.

All the books revolve around a young boy, Omri, who discovers the powers of a magical cupboard. When plastic toys are locked in the cupboard, they become real, living beings, resulting in Omri befriending an 18th-century Iroquois (Haudenosaunee) chief named Little Bear (Little Bull in some editions). As the series progresses, Omri and his friend Patrick learn more about the cupboard&#x27;s powers, including its ability to transport people to and fro through history.

The book has received numerous awards and been both critiqued and praised on its literary merit, and had once been recommended reading in school curriculum. In a review of the first book of the series, Kirkus Reviews observed, &quot;The first book had a fine balance between childish desire to play with the tiny figures and awareness that, though small, they were real people who ought not to be so manipulated.&quot; The book was reviewed in the 1981 &quot;New York Times&quot; article &quot;BOOKS: Best For Children&quot; where it was called &quot;the best novel of the year&quot;. At one time, classrooms and libraries widely accepted the book, to the point that it was part of the teaching curricula for children at the novel&#x27;s recommend reading level. In 2003 and 2004, HarperTrophy reprinted the original book, along with the other four novels in the series, and commissioned Michael Koelsch to illustrate new cover artworks.

==Plot summary==
On Omri&#x27;s ninth birthday, his best friend Patrick gives him the disappointing gift of a small plastic Indian figurine. Omri also receives a white metal medicine cupboard from his brother. The only key in the house that fits the cupboard&#x27;s lock is the key to Omri&#x27;s great-grandmother&#x27;s jewellery box. Omri puts the plastic figurine in the cupboard and locks it with the key, only to discover the following morning that the figurine has come to life as a three-inch-tall Iroquois Indian man.

Though the tiny man, whose name is Little Bear (Little Bull in some editions), initially believes that Omri is a god, he quickly realizes that Omri is only an ordinary, albeit giant, boy, and proceeds to boss him around. Little Bear explores the house and garden, while Omri provides for Little Bear&#x27;s needs. Little Bear&#x27;s rejection of the gift of a tipi (as Iroquois live in longhouses) leads Omri to research more about the Iroquois people, causing him to rethink some of his stereotypical views of American Indians and to realize that Little Bear is a real person with a history and culture. Omri is particularly affected when a plastic figure of an elderly Native American chief dies of shock upon being brought to life. Little Bear, however, claims the old chief&#x27;s headdress, as he is the only one around to take the title, and becomes more demanding than ever.

Patrick offers Omri a gift of a plastic cowboy so that Omri can play properly with his toy Indian. Omri rejects the gift, which leads to letting Patrick in on the secret. Overwhelmed with excitement, Patrick urges Omri to bring loads of plastic people to life, while Omri protests that the people would be real, not toys to be played with. Nevertheless, Patrick uses the cupboard without Omri&#x27;s knowledge, bringing to life the plastic cowboy, who turns out to be a man named Boone from an entirely different place and time as Little Bear. Over Omri&#x27;s objections, Patrick introduces Boone to Little Bear. The two tiny men mistrust one another from the start, with Boone deriding Little Bear as &quot;savage&quot; and &quot;dirty.&quot; The antagonism comes to a head when Omri and Patrick introduce the duo to television; when Boone cheers the slaughter of Native Americans in an old Western, Little Bear shoots him in the chest with an arrow.

Little Bear is immediately guilty, but does not know enough medicine to save Boone, while the boys are far too large to help. Omri brings to life the figure of a World War I medic, who turns out to be a man named Tommy Atkins from the trenches of France. Tommy, believing that this is a strange dream, saves Boone&#x27;s life before being transported back through the cupboard. Little Bear continues to treat Boone&#x27;s injuries, and the two gradually come to trust one another. This incident finally impresses upon Patrick that the tiny people are not toys. Though both boys have become attached to Boone and Little Bear, they agree to return everyone to their own time.

As chief, Little Bear demands a bride. Little Bear chooses from an array of plastic Native American figurines and Omri brings to life an Iroquois woman called Bright Stars (Twin Stars in some editions). The two boys and the tiny people have a final celebration, during which Boone becomes Little Bear&#x27;s blood brother as does Omri, before the miniature people are sent home through the cupboard. Each boy keeps the now-plastic image of their friend as a memento, and Omri gives the cupboard&#x27;s key back to his mother so that he will not be tempted to bring them back.

==Reception==
&quot;The New York Times&quot;″ 1981 review &quot;BOOKS: Best for Children&quot; called it the &quot;best novel of the year&quot;. Kirkus Reviews observed, &quot;The first book had a fine balance between childish desire to play with the tiny figures and awareness that, though small, they were real people who ought not to be so manipulated.&quot; Advocates for book praise the novel on aspects of convincing characters, reader captivation and enchantment, and keeping in touch with young readers, among other things.

=== Awards ===
&quot;The Indian in the Cupboard&quot; has received several literary awards across the years and is becoming regarded as a classic in children&#x27;s literature. A list of the awards received is as follows:

=== Criticism ===
The novel has been criticised for its portrayal and representation of Native Americans. At the 1991 American Library Association national conference, Naomi Caldwell-Wood and Lisa A. Mitten (former presidents of the American Indian Library Association) listed the book and its sequels under &quot;Titles to avoid&quot;, calling them &quot;classic examples of highly acclaimed books riddled with horrendous stereotypes of Native Americans. Banks has created her &#x27;Indian&#x27; character from the mixed bag of harmful cliches so common among British authors&quot;. Similarly, Rhonda Harris Taylor explains that one aspect of controversy surrounding this novel is the &quot;fact that the book&#x27;s portrayal of Native Americans is seen as acceptable, implying its representations of American Indians as savages are the way American Indians are viewed in the mainstream,&quot; and that the role of Omri reinforces ideas of white paternalism. According to Freedom to Read, the book was challenged by a school board in Kamloops, British Columbia, and was temporarily removed from public libraries on the basis of the &quot;potentially offensive treatment of native peoples.&quot; The book was reintroduced into libraries, but the title was placed on the list of challenged materials for teacher information. In 1992, Doris Seale, a Santee Dakota, Abenaki and Cree librarian, wrote, &quot;My heart aches for the Native child unfortunate enough to stumble across, and read, these books. How could she, reading this, fail to be damaged? How could a white child fail to believe that he is far superior to the bloodthirsty, subhuman monsters portrayed here?&quot;

==Sequels==
===&quot;The Return of the Indian&quot; (1985)===
The second book in the series was published in paperback by Avon books, now an imprint of HarperCollins Publishers. It was a &quot;New York Times&quot; Notable Book. It was illustrated by Bill Geldart, William Coldart (UK), and Piers Sanford (US).

Omri and Patrick intervene aggressively in Little Bear&#x27;s home world, &quot;Kirkus&quot; observed in contrast to the first book, noting &quot;Feisty, likable characters and the precise logic by which Banks evolves events from her premises make this one of the better recent fantasies. Readers, enjoying the action and adventure, may also ponder its moral dilemmas.&quot;

====Plot summary====
A year after the events of the previous book, Omri wins first prize in a story-writing competition for his tale &quot;The Plastic Indian&quot;, which is actually a recounting of his real adventures with the cupboard; everyone else assumes that Omri&#x27;s story is fictional. Wanting to share his good news, Omri brings Little Bear and Bright Stars through the magic cupboard. Little Bear returns badly injured by the French soldiers he has been fighting in his own time. Omri attempts to bring back Tommy, the WWI field medic from the first book, but receives only Tommy&#x27;s neatly folded uniform and medical bag, causing him to realize that Tommy was killed in the war.

Omri goes to Patrick for help. At first Patrick seems to have banished the memory of the tiny people from his mind, but then reluctantly shows Omri that he still carries the plastic figure of Boone in his pocket. Patrick&#x27;s cousin Tamsin recently received a set of plastic medical figurines as a birthday gift, and the boys plan to borrow it and bring the whole group to life in the cupboard; however, Tamsin catches them taking the miniatures. Omri is able to slip one figure, a nurse, into his pocket.

Omri and Patrick put the nurse in the cupboard and bring her to life. The nurse, called Matron, believing she has dozed off while on duty, saves Little Bear&#x27;s life. Matron also announces that Bright Stars is pregnant, and the boys decide that it would be safer to keep Bright Stars with them until after the baby is born, rather than return her to her war-torn village.

Patrick brings the cowboy Boone back to life through the cupboard in order to help Bright Stars care for Little Bear. Little Bear tells Boone about the troubles his people are suffering during their war with the French, and Boone wishes that he could somehow supply his friend with the &quot;modern&quot; six-shooters that are common in Boone&#x27;s late-19th-century timeline. Patrick gets the idea to take plastic soldiers (with 20th century weaponry) back through the cupboard to Little Bear&#x27;s time. Little Bear likes the idea of modern weapons, but refuses to bring English soldiers back to his village. Omri is reluctant, believing this amounts to meddling with history, but is won over by his desire to save Little Bear&#x27;s people. The boys buy several more plastic Iroquois figures from the local shops and bring them all to life with the cupboard to serve as Little Bear&#x27;s army. They also buy plastic miniatures of modern guns to give to the Iroquois, as well as a miniature Royal Marine figurine (who turns out to be a British corporal named Fickits) to instruct the Iroquois in their use.

After Little Bear and his troops are sent back, a casual comment by Boone prompts Omri and Patrick to wonder if it is the key which is magical, rather than the cupboard. Omri climbs into a large empty chest while holding Little Bear&#x27;s plastic tipi and has Patrick turn the key. Omri finds himself looking through the eyes of one of the tipi&#x27;s painted decorations, where he witnesses a group of Algonquins attacking Little Bear&#x27;s village. The tipi is set on fire, but Patrick brings him back in the nick of time, only to find half Omri&#x27;s hair singed off and his face blistered. Both Patrick and Omri are shaken, both by Omri&#x27;s injuries and by the brutal reminder than Little Bear&#x27;s time is real and dangerous.

That night, Patrick brings back the Iroquois army, only to find that they were completely unprepared for the use of modern weapons; their unfamiliarity with the power of the weapons results in them surrounding their enemies and shooting without realising how far the shots would travel, with some of them being shot by their own side by accident. Matron is able to save several lives but many are dead or dying. Little Bear feels ashamed of leading his troops into death, but Bright Stars is able to comfort him by showing off their newborn son, whom he names Tall Bear.

Later that night, while Patrick and Omri have the house to themselves, a trio of skinheads breaks in the house to burgle the family. Patrick and Omri bring back their Marine friend Fickits, along with a complement of troops, and set them loose on the skinheads, who are peppered by tiny machine-gun fire, causing them to flee. Omri&#x27;s parents return and scold the boys for taking care of the burglars themselves rather than calling the police (Omri is also scolded for &quot;playing with fire&quot; and burning his face).

Before returning Little Bear and Bright Stars to their own time, Omri finally tells Little Bear about the prize-winning story, which was the reason Omri wanted to see Little Bear all along. Little Bear reflects that his son will be proud to know that his father will live on in Omri&#x27;s story long after his death.

===&quot;The Secret of the Indian&quot; (1989)===
The third book in the series was illustrated at least by Graham Philpot (UK), Ted Lewin (US), and Piers Sanford (later).

====Plot summary====

Omri&#x27;s school headmaster confronts Omri about his prize-winning story, believing that it might be true, as he had previously been shocked by these same &quot;tiny people&quot; on a day when Omri brought Little Bear to see his school. The headmaster threatens to get to the bottom of the mystery, causing Omri to fear that adults will learn the secret and use it to manipulate history.

Patrick agrees with Omri that it has become too dangerous to continue using the magic, but before they stop forever, Patrick deeply wants to travel back to Boone&#x27;s time, just as Omri traveled to Little Bear&#x27;s time in the previous book. Omri has grown ever more reluctant about using the key&#x27;s magic powers to meddle with history, but he finally agrees to &quot;hide&quot; Patrick&#x27;s true whereabouts in the large chest he has in his room. However, Patrick mistakenly keeps Boone&#x27;s plastic figure in his pocket as Omri sends him into the past, causing Boone&#x27;s real-life body to be knocked unconscious while Boone is now &quot;brought forward&quot; in his miniature form. Trapped in Patrick&#x27;s pocket, Boone nearly smothers before Omri, with Matron&#x27;s help, revives him.

Patrick arrives in the Wild West miniaturized and trapped inside Boone&#x27;s pocket, while the now full-sized Boone is sprawled unconscious and alone on the open prairie. Patrick manages to &quot;ride&quot; Boone&#x27;s giant horse to a nearby town, where the horse stops out of habit at a local saloon. Tiny Patrick flags the attention of a dancing girl named Ruby Lou, who is curious but unafraid of the tiny boy, and who also happens to be a close friend of Boone&#x27;s. With Patrick&#x27;s help, she and the saloon piano player carry Boone back to town and deliver him to the local doctor, who simply believes Boone is drunk. However, they are all in danger when a sudden storm spawns a tornado that tears apart the doctor&#x27;s office.

After the battle in the last book, many tiny injured Iroquois remain in Omri&#x27;s room under Matron&#x27;s care. Matron is exhausted and at the end of her skills and strength. Boone is also badly injured. Omri decides to make a second attempt to steal Tamsin&#x27;s plastic medical set, but is caught by Tamsin&#x27;s sister Emma. Omri is forced to tell her about the key&#x27;s magic power and the desperate situation in his bedroom. Emma agrees to borrow the medical set for him and to keep silent about the magic, on the condition that she be allowed to bring to life a plastic person of her own. By chance, the figurine she selects is that of Ruby Lou. Thanks to the toys Emma provides, Matron is able to get a surgical team that saves the Iroquois and Boone.

Omri uses the trunk to bring Patrick back to the present and at the same time return the Iroquois to the past, but returning Patrick inadvertently drags the tornado back to Omri&#x27;s room, destroying part of the house and neighborhood. In the chaos, the cupboard is damaged and the key lost. Omri&#x27;s headmaster, who has been lurking outside the house hoping to catch evidence of Omri&#x27;s secret, is struck on the head by debris, meaning that no one believes any of his ramblings about &quot;tiny people.&quot;

Boone and Ruby Lou realize they are stranded as tiny people in the far future, unable to return home without the key. They attempt to make a life with one another, eventually confessing their love. They are resigned to their fate, but long to return home and be properly married.

Omri&#x27;s father repairs the cupboard and returns it to his son, while Omri, by sheer luck, finds the key in a hedge. He uses the magic to summon all of the group&#x27;s tiny friends for Boone and Ruby Lou&#x27;s wedding before sending everyone home for what he promises will be the final time. Afterwards Omri asks his parents for a safe-deposit box, into which he puts the key, the cupboard, the figurines of Little Bear and his family, and a copy of his story, leaving them for his children to find.

===&quot;The Mystery of the Cupboard&quot; (1993)===
This book was illustrated by Piers Sanford (UK) and Tom Newsom (US). HarperCollins recommends its 2004 edition for ages 8 to 12. &quot;Kirkus Reviews&quot; recommended it for ages 10 to 13 in 1993, concluding, &quot;Not the best Cupboard book, but fans won&#x27;t want to miss it; with a first printing of 75,000 they won&#x27;t have to.&quot;

&quot;Kirkus&quot; observed that &quot;Banks plots expertly&quot; and develops the relationship between Omri and his father. &quot;There&#x27;s not much chance to stereotype Native Americans here, as Banks was charged with earlier, but Jessica Charlotte is certainly a caricature of a music-hall singer; one wonders whether it&#x27;s reasonable, or merely foolish, to deplore such shorthand in popular fiction.&quot;

====Plot summary====

With their house in ruins after the freak tornado in the previous book, Omri and family move temporarily to rural Dorset, where they have inherited a house from the family of Jessica Charlotte Driscoll, Omri&#x27;s &quot;wicked&quot; great-great aunt, who became the family black sheep by being a charlatan fortune-teller, a scandalous dance-hall girl, and a thief. While the cottage&#x27;s roof is being rethatched, the workmen discover a metal box and give it to Omri, telling him that the previous owners of old cottages frequently hid their deedboxes in thatched roofs.

Along with the deedbox is a journal called &quot;The Account,&quot; written by Jessica Charlotte herself as she was dying of a fatal illness. Jessica possesses a power called the Gift, which she uses to read the future by pouring lead into water and interpreting the shapes it makes. After her sister, scandalized by Jessica&#x27;s lifestyle, forbids her from ever seeing her precious niece Lottie (Omri&#x27;s maternal grandmother who was killed in the Blitz during World War II), Jessica takes revenge by stealing her sister&#x27;s valuable earrings. To do so she makes a duplicate of the jewel-case key out of lead, but accidentally imbues it with magical power through her own Gift. This allows the Key to open any lock. Lottie is accused of stealing the earrings and runs out into the street where her father follows her, resulting in him being killed by a passing carriage.

At this point in the Account, Jessica grows too weak to continue. Omri&#x27;s great-uncle Fredrick takes over. Fredrick was a toymaker who created miniatures from metal and who detested the cheap, ugly plastic toys that had come to replace old-fashioned metal toys. He also possessed some of Jessica&#x27;s magical abilities. Jessica had him create the cupboard, which he imbues with his hatred of plastic toys. This caused the cupboard to only bring plastic toys to life, which is why no other materials ever worked when Omri tried them in the cupboard.

Omri meets one of the thatchers who worked on the roof when Jessica was dying, a man named Tom, and learns from him that Jessica let him in on the secret. She also gave him a little person to care for, a servant girl named Jenny from the 1800s who sought to escape her home life after she lost her position. After having lived as a little person for thirty years, she had died a few months before.

Omri suspects that the stolen earrings are in the deedbox he found with the Account and realises that the magic key could open it. He returns to his old town, telling his parents that he wants to visit Patrick, but really to retrieve the key from the safe-deposit box. Omri opens the deedbox and finds five wrapped bundles, four of whom are people brought to life by the magic key. The people turn out to be Elsie, a widowed shop owner; Bert, a thief from Elsie&#x27;s time; and Ted, a retired policeman. The final person, Sergeant Charlie Ellis, was a naval officer killed at the Battle of Trafalgar; his bundle contains only his uniform. These new people reveal that Jessica knew of the power of the key and the cupboard but only found out when she accidentally brought them to life for the first time. She brought them back and forth many times, just as Omri did with Little Bear. Just before she died, she told them all that they were being sent back for the final time and wished them goodbye. Jenny, however, lived such a wretched life in the past that she begged to be allowed to remain. Jessica entrusted Jenny&#x27;s care to Tom.

Omri learns that Bert is the thief who stole his great-grandmother&#x27;s jewellery box after her husband had died, leaving her destitute. Bert had no idea that he was robbing a woman of her only valuables and promises Omri that he will return the jewellery box in the past in hopes of changing the future for the better. Omri then sends them one final time through the cupboard.

Omri believes that the final bundle must contain the missing earrings, but in fact, it contains another tiny person, fast asleep. Before he can investigate further, he is called to Tom&#x27;s home. Tom has fallen from the roof and is on the verge of death, but asked for Omri to tell him the final secret: before she died, Jessica had him search for a plastic figure of herself. He bought dozens of figurines before finally finding the right one. Jessica kept the figure of herself but told him to take care of the other plastic figures, saying, &quot;This is me, but everyone is someone.&quot;

Omri and his father head home, bringing Patrick along. Omri explains that he&#x27;s figured out the identity of the final person he brought to life: Jessica Charlotte herself, just after creating the key. Omri wants to convince her to not to take the earrings, but Patrick tells him that doing so could change his own family history and possibly result in Omri never being born. Remembering that he convinced Bert to return the jewellery case, Omri worries that it will cause him to cease to exist. Omri and Patrick convince the newly woken tiny Jessica that this is all a dream before returning her to her own past.

Omri asks his mother how she originally came by the key. She tells him that key came from her great-grandmother&#x27;s jewellery box, which was stolen and returned empty. Omri realizes that Bert only said he would return the &quot;jewel-case&quot; without specifying that the jewels would still be in it. This is the same story his mother told him about the key when she first gave it to him, and Omri realizes this means history has not been changed.

A week later Omri attends Tom&#x27;s funeral, where he meets Tom&#x27;s daughter, who is wearing the long-lost earrings. Omri realizes that Jessica gave the earrings to Tom, who gave them to his daughter without knowing they were stolen. Having solved the mystery, he decides not to tell Tom&#x27;s daughter the story of the earrings.

Omri returns home to find that his father, while rebuilding Omri&#x27;s bedroom, found the key, the cupboard, and the plastic figure of Little Bear and locked the toy in the cupboard, where he was shocked when Little Bear came to life. He has since been too frightened to open the cupboard while Little Bear called for Omri from inside. Realizing that his father must be let in on the secret, the story ends with Omri opening the cupboard to introduce Little Bear to his father.

===&quot;The Key to the Indian&quot; (1998)===
This book was illustrated by Piers Sanford (UK) and James Watling (US). HarperCollins recommends its 2004 edition for ages 8 to 12.

====Plot summary====
Omri and his father learn that Little Bear needs their help as American colonists are starting to head into his people&#x27;s land. The two realise that they must travel back in time and lend their aid but need to figure out how to do it. They have the key but they need something big enough to hold them. Omri&#x27;s chest that he and Patrick used before was destroyed in the tornado they accidentally brought back and it isn&#x27;t big enough to hold them. Omri&#x27;s dad decides to use the car as the time machine and comes up with an elaborate plan to pretend to go on a camping trip as a cover for their time travel, but they realise that the key won&#x27;t work in the car and start to despair. Omri tells his father everything about what he learned and shows him the Account.

After reading that, Omri&#x27;s dad figures out that Jessica Charlotte could possibly create them a magical copy of the car key so they can travel back in time. The two also figure out that Omri has inherited some of her psychic power and that&#x27;s most likely why he can tell when one of his friends from the past needs his help. It gives Omri the power to sense various things, like being able to figure out what&#x27;s going on with Jessica in her time even though she was so weak at this point when she wrote the Account that only a few words can be made out: she&#x27;s learned that her brother-in law has died and is going to try to drown herself. The two feel that they must bring her forward no matter what. Omri later brings her, initially planning on waiting, but his psychic gift senses her in trouble and causes him to bring her forward. She&#x27;s drowned herself and isn&#x27;t breathing so Omri summons Matron, who manages to revive her. He tries to comfort her about what happened and when she hears that he&#x27;s Lottie&#x27;s grandson she agrees to make a magical copy of the car key. He brings his father and they give her the key and send her back. That night they summon Little Bear to get something of his to use to travel back, and he gives them his wampum belt. He also agrees to have Bright Stars make toys for them to travel into when they journey to the past.

The next day Omri&#x27;s father summons Jessica Charlotte without him and she returns the original car key and gives them the copy, but unfortunately the scale difference means that the key is too small to see, and hence is useless to them. They decide to go camping anyway and bring Gillon along, but Omri has an ivory elephant from India and Gillon is leaning against a knapsack from that time also and they suddenly find themselves in India about 90 years before. Omri figures out that Jessica Charlote&#x27;s attempt to create the magical copy of the car key where she bent her entire will on it probably caused the original car key to become magical. He figures his father will realise what happened and bring them back by shutting off the car. During the trip Omri and Gillon are marionettes – Gillon, embarrassingly enough, is a female figure—and a couple of children spot them moving on their own and try to show them off. Feeling bad for the children Omri goes along with it but when the children&#x27;s mother shows up both Omri and Gillon are dropped and Gillon hits his head. Thankfully before they can get hurt further they&#x27;re pulled back to their time where Omri finds they never left the house as the father got pulled back to Little Bear&#x27;s time due to the wampum belt being in his pocket and were pulled back when Omri&#x27;s mother found them and shut off the car fearing they were dead. Omri&#x27;s father ended up in a faceless doll but Little Bear promised that next time the dolls would have faces.

The two decide to pretend to go camping but head to the top of a nearby hill and time travel from there. They summon Patrick to send them there and back but Patrick is unhappy he won&#x27;t be going until he realises that he has the cupboard and can call any of their friends back. He sends them back and they meet up with Little Bear. The two eventually advise Little Bear to take his tribe to Canada but are attacked by two settlers. They set fire to the longhouse and start killing Indians. Old Clan Woman, the oldest and wisest member of the tribe manages to scare them off with Omri and his father&#x27;s help, but she is killed by the two retreating men. Little Bear and his tribe escape and start the trek to Canada but Omri and his father are forgotten in the rush. They escape outside but are trapped in the stockade and the two men return and go to kill them. Before they can succeed Little Bear returns, having remembered them after hearing of their heroic actions earlier, and kills the two men and rescues them. He also retrieves a false face mask from the longhouse. He apologises to them for leaving them behind and is ashamed as Omri is his blood brother. He tells Omri he is no longer a boy: Omri is now a warrior. He leaves the two a moccasin to use as a shelter until Patrick brings them back in the morning, and leaves after saying a final goodbye.

The next morning they are returned to their time by a frantic Patrick who explains that he brought Boone and Ruby Lou but lost them. They eventually find them in a septic tank and rescue and clean them up. Patrick also reveals that he planned to bring Little Bear to the present while they were away but Sergeant Fickits convinced him not to. A couple of weeks later Omri&#x27;s mother brings him the wampum belt and he realises that she knows the truth. She reveals that she, like Omri, has inherited some of Jessica Charlotte&#x27;s psychic powers and, seeming to read his mind, explains that she&#x27;s known the truth since the beginning but has kept it to herself. Omri&#x27;s brothers have no idea and never will. They both agree that it is time to end the adventures for good. Omri closes his figures and the magical car key in the cashbox and decides to give the magic key back to his mother so he will no longer have the temptation to use it to bring the others back again. He first sends the wampum belt back and senses through his psychic powers that Little Bear and his tribe have successfully and safely reached Canada and reveals this to his father along with the fact that his mother knows the truth. However an apparently psychic dream indicates that perhaps he will still have further adventures.

<doc id="725817" wikidata="Q221947" url="?curid=725817" title="The Jungle Book 2">
<text>The Jungle Book 2 is a 2003 animated adventure film produced by the Australian office at DisneyToon Studios and released by Walt Disney Pictures and Buena Vista Distribution. The film was released in France on February 5, 2003, and released in the United States on February 14.

The film is a sequel to Walt Disney&#x27;s 1967 film &quot;The Jungle Book&quot;, and stars Haley Joel Osment as the voice of Mowgli and John Goodman as the voice of Baloo.

The film was originally produced as a direct-to-video film, but was released theatrically first, similar to the &quot;Peter Pan&quot; sequel &quot;Return to Never Land&quot;. It is the fourth animated Disney sequel to have a theatrical release rather than going direct-to-video after &quot;The Rescuers Down Under&quot; (1990), &quot;Fantasia 2000&quot; (1999), and &quot;Return to Never Land&quot; (2002) and the last one until &quot;Ralph Breaks the Internet&quot; (2018). The film is not based on &quot;The Second Jungle Book&quot;, but they do have several characters in common.

The film received negative reviews criticizing the animation and plot, but it was a box office success, grossing $135.7 million against a $20 million budget.

==Plot==
Following the events of the previous film, Mowgli now resides in the &quot;Man-Village&quot; with Shanti, the girl who lured him into the village, having been being adopted by the village leader, who has a wife named Messua and a son named Ranjan. However, wanting to return to the exciting life of the jungle, Mowgli nearly leads the other children in the village into the jungle. Mowgli is punished by the village leader for disobeying him by leaving the village and putting the other children in danger.

Meanwhile in the jungle, Baloo starts to feel lonely and misses Mowgli. He goes to the Man-Village to get Mowgli, but Bagheera alongside Colonel Hathi and his herd tries to keep him away from there. Shere Khan has returned to Baloo and Bagheera&#x27;s part of the jungle, seeking revenge on Mowgli for defeating him in the first film much to the vultures surprise along with their new member Lucky.

Later that night Baloo gets to the Man-Village and takes Mowgli back into the jungle; unbeknownst to them, Shere Khan had also entered the village looking for Mowgli, only to be attacked by the villagers. In the ensuing chase, Shanti and Ranjan sneak into the jungle to rescue Mowgli, believing that Baloo is a rabid animal who has kidnapped him. Kaa attempts to eat Shanti (after another attempt to eat Mowgli as he was with Baloo) only to be hit with a stick by Ranjan.

Bagheera learns of Mowgli&#x27;s escape from the village when the humans search the jungle for him (which causes many animals including Hathi and his herd to be scared) and immediately suspects Baloo. Mowgli instructs Baloo to scare off Shanti should she appear, and bemoans about his boring life in the Man-Village. Baloo and Mowgli journey to King Louie&#x27;s old temple (King Louie is mentioned to have moved out), for a party. When the jungle animals mock Shanti and other aspects of Mowgli&#x27;s life in the Man-Village, Mowgli angrily leaves. He finds Shanti and Ranjan, but Baloo scares Shanti. When the truth comes out that Mowgli ordered Baloo to scare her, Shanti and Ranjan run away, abandoning Mowgli.

Baloo realizes that Mowgli misses his village life, but when Mowgli tries to make amends with his human friends, they are cornered by Shere Khan. The tiger chases Mowgli and Shanti to an abandoned temple built above a lake of lava. Baloo instructs Bagheera to protect Ranjan while he goes to save Mowgli and Shanti. After confusing Shere Khan by banging several different gongs, Shanti&#x27;s presence is revealed to Shere Khan. Baloo tackles Shere Khan to the ground, allowing Mowgli and Shanti enough time to escape, but the tiger chases them to a statue across a pit of lava. Shere Khan is trapped within the statue&#x27;s mouth, and it plummets onto a large stone in the lava below.

With Shere Khan finally thwarted, Baloo decides to let Mowgli return to the Man-Village with Shanti and Ranjan, and Bagheera proudly compliments Baloo for making a wise decision. Upon returning to the Man-Village, Mowgli reconciles with the village leader, who apologizes to Mowgli for failing to understand that the jungle was part of his identity. Mowgli embraces his new life in the Man-Village, and the children return daily to visit Baloo and Bagheera in the jungle.

==Voice cast==
As four decades past since the release of the first film, a new cast came in to play the characters. This film was the last film that Tony Jay voiced Shere Khan after playing the character following George Sanders&#x27; death. As King Louie does not appear in the film due to legal issues with Louis Prima&#x27;s estate, Jim Cummings does not voice the character but voices Kaa, and Colonel Hathi in the film.
* Haley Joel Osment as Mowgli, a young boy raised in the jungle, who wants to return there. He was voiced by Bruce Reitherman in the original film, who in turn replaced David Bailey. Jake Thomas auditioned for the role prior to Osment&#x27;s casting.
* John Goodman as Baloo, a fun-loving sloth bear who is Mowgli&#x27;s best friend. He was voiced by Phil Harris in the original film.
* Mae Whitman as Shanti, a young girl who is Mowgli&#x27;s love interest. Darleen Carr provided her singing voice at the end of the original film, and she was also unnamed.
* Bob Joles as Bagheera, a black panther and Mowgli&#x27;s friend, who is determined to stop Baloo from getting Mowgli out of his village. He was voiced by Sebastian Cabot in the original film.
* Tony Jay as Shere Khan, a man-eating Bengal tiger who wants revenge on Mowgli. He was voiced by George Sanders in the original film. Having previously voiced the role numerous times in the 1990s after he replaced George Sanders, this was Jay&#x27;s final reprisal as the character before his death in 2006.
* Phil Collins as Lucky, a slow-witted vulture who mocks Shere Khan.
* John Rhys-Davies as the Village Leader, the stern yet responsible ruler of the Man-Village who serves as Mowgli&#x27;s adoptive father.
* Veena Bidasha as Messua, the Village Leader&#x27;s wife who serves as Mowgli&#x27;s adoptive mother.
* Connor Funk as Ranjan, the son of Messua and the Village Leader who serves as Mowgli&#x27;s adoptive brother.
* Jim Cummings as Kaa / Colonel Hathi / M.C. Monkey. In the original film, Kaa was voiced by Sterling Holloway, Hathi was voiced by J. Pat O&#x27;Malley and M.C. Monkey was voiced by Leo De Lyon and known as Flunkey. Cummings reprises his role as Kaa from the TV series, &quot;Jungle Cubs&quot;.
* Jimmy Bennett as Hathi Jr. He was voiced by Clint Howard in the original film.
* Jeff Glen Bennett as Buzzie. Hathi&#x27;s voice actor in the original film, O&#x27;Malley, voiced Buzzie in the original film as well.
* Brian Cummings as Flaps. He was voiced by Chad Stuart in the original film.
* Jess Harnell as Dizzy and Ziggy. In the original film, Lord Tim Hudson voiced Dizzy, while Digby Wolfe voiced Ziggy.

Additional voices are provided by an uncredited J. Grant Albrecht, Jeff Bennett, Brian Cummings, Baron Davis, Jess Harnell, and Devika Parikh.

==Songs==
Songs from the first film were composed by Terry Gilkyson and Richard M. and Robert B. Sherman with new songs by Lorraine Feather, Paul Grabowsky, and Joel McNeely. Marty Stuart reportedly submitted songs for the film during production.

# &quot;I Wan&#x27;na Be like You&quot; – Smash Mouth
# &quot;Jungle Rhythm&quot; – Mowgli, Shanti, Ranjan
# &quot;The Bare Necessities&quot; – Baloo
# &quot;Colonel Hathi&#x27;s March&quot;
# &quot;The Bare Necessities&quot; – Baloo, Mowgli
# &quot;W-I-L-D&quot; – Baloo
# &quot;Jungle Rhythm (Reprise)&quot; – Mowgli
# &quot;The Bear Necessities (Reprise)&quot; – Baloo, Mowgli, Shanti
# &quot;Right Where I Belong&quot; – Windy Wagner

==Production==
In the 1990s, screenwriting duo Bob Hilgenberg and Rob Muir submitted a &quot;Jungle Book 2&quot; screenplay in which Baloo ventured to save his romantic interest from a poacher. Disney ultimately went in a different direction for the sequel.

John Goodman recorded his voice work in New Orleans while Haley Joel Osment recorded his in California. Due to a legal dispute, the character of King Louie from the original &quot;Jungle Book&quot; could not be included in this film. However, he makes a non-physical appearance as a shadow puppet in the beginning of the film and is briefly mentioned in the middle of the film. The decision was made to keep Shere Khan in shadow during the beginning of the film to &quot;reflect his &#x27;wounded pride&#x27;&quot;.

The film was originally intended to be released straight-to-video but in February 2002, Disney announced that the film, as well as &quot;Piglet&#x27;s Big Movie&quot; would be released theatrically. The film was given a theatrical release in all territories except in Japan.

==Reception==
===Critical reception===
&quot;The Jungle Book 2&quot; received generally negative reviews from critics. On review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the film received an approval rating of 19% based on 91 reviews, with an average rating of 4.4/10. The site&#x27;s critical consensus reads: &quot;This inferior rehash of &quot;The Jungle Book&quot; should have gone straight to video&quot;. On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 38 out of 100 based on 24 critics, indicating &quot;generally unfavorable reviews&quot;. Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of &quot;A−&quot; on an A+ to F scale.

===Box office===
The film was released on February 14, 2003 and opened at #4 in its 4-day opening weekend with $14,109,797. At the end of its run, the film grossed $47,901,582 in the United States and $87,802,017 in foreign countries totaling $135,703,599 worldwide. It could be considered a box office success, based on its $20 million budget.

===Home media=== 
&quot;The Jungle Book 2&quot; was released on both VHS and DVD on June 10, 2003. The bonus features included the behind-the-scenes, some music videos, &quot;W-I-L-D&quot;, &quot;I Wan&#x27;na Be like You&quot; and &quot;Jungle Rhythm&quot;, and deleted scenes. It was rereleased on June 17, 2008 as a &quot;Special Edition&quot; DVD with additional bonus features. In the United States, the 2008 DVD release sold 126,593 units and grossed in two weeks. The film was first released on Blu-ray on March 18, 2014; a Blu-ray release was also included as part of the Disney Legacy Animated Film Collection on November 14, 2023. As of 2024, an unlimited DVD/Blu-ray release of this film has yet to be announced.

==Cancelled sequel and TV series==
In 2003, a third installment to &quot;The Jungle Book&quot; was planned. It would have been about Baloo and Shere Khan being captured and sold off to a Russian circus, and Mowgli, Shanti, Ranjan, and Bagheera deciding to save them both. Over the course of the film, Shere Khan regrets his hatred against humanity after the events of the previous two films because of his capture, and eventually reforms after Mowgli and his friends rescued them. The project was never materialized and has yet to be reinstated due to Tony Jay&#x27;s death in 2006. Before the movie was released a TV series taking place after the movie was pitched by John Fountain and was called &quot;Mowgli and Baloo&#x27;s Jungle Jams&quot; which was to be shown in the style of the comic strip &quot;Calvin and Hobbes&quot; but it was never accepted.

<text>In mathematics education, precalculus is a course, or a set of courses, that includes algebra and trigonometry at a level which is designed to prepare students for the study of calculus, thus the name precalculus. Schools often distinguish between algebra and trigonometry as two separate parts of the coursework.

==Concept==
For students to succeed at finding the derivatives and antiderivatives with calculus, they will need facility with algebraic expressions, particularly in modification and transformation of such expressions. Leonhard Euler wrote the first precalculus book in 1748 called &quot;Introductio in analysin infinitorum&quot; (Latin: Introduction to the Analysis of the Infinite), which &quot;was meant as a survey of concepts and methods in analysis and analytic geometry preliminary to the study of differential and integral calculus.&quot; He began with the fundamental concepts of variables and functions. His innovation is noted for its use of exponentiation to introduce the transcendental functions. The general logarithm, to an arbitrary positive base, Euler presents as the inverse of an exponential function.

Then the natural logarithm is obtained by taking as base &quot;the number for which the hyperbolic logarithm is one&quot;, sometimes called Euler&#x27;s number, and written formula_1. This appropriation of the significant number from Grégoire de Saint-Vincent’s calculus suffices to establish the natural logarithm. This part of precalculus prepares the student for integration of the monomial formula_2 in the instance of formula_3.

Today&#x27;s precalculus text computes formula_1 as the limit formula_5. An exposition on compound interest in financial mathematics may motivate this limit. Another difference in the modern text is avoidance of complex numbers, except as they may arise as roots of a quadratic equation with a negative discriminant, or in Euler&#x27;s formula as application of trigonometry. Euler used not only complex numbers but also infinite series in his precalculus. Today&#x27;s course may cover arithmetic and geometric sequences and series, but not the application by Saint-Vincent to gain his hyperbolic logarithm, which Euler used to finesse his precalculus.

==Variable content==
Precalculus prepares students for calculus somewhat differently from the way that pre-algebra prepares students for algebra. While pre-algebra often has extensive coverage of basic algebraic concepts, precalculus courses might see only small amounts of calculus concepts, if at all, and often involves covering algebraic topics that might not have been given attention in earlier algebra courses. Some precalculus courses might differ with others in terms of content. For example, an honors-level course might spend more time on conic sections, Euclidean vectors, and other topics needed for calculus, used in fields such as medicine or engineering. A college preparatory/regular class might focus on topics used in business-related careers, such as matrices, or power functions.

A standard course considers functions, function composition, and inverse functions, often in connection with sets and real numbers. In particular, polynomials and rational functions are developed. Algebraic skills are exercised with trigonometric functions and trigonometric identities. The binomial theorem, polar coordinates, parametric equations, and the limits of sequences and series are other common topics of precalculus. Sometimes the mathematical induction method of proof for propositions dependent upon a natural number may be demonstrated, but generally coursework involves exercises rather than theory.

<doc id="725824" wikidata="Q864194" url="?curid=725824" title="SkyCity Entertainment Group">
<text>SkyCity Entertainment Group is a gambling and entertainment company based in Auckland, New Zealand. It owns and operates five casino properties in New Zealand and Australia, which include restaurants and bars, three hotels, a convention centre and Auckland&#x27;s Sky Tower.

The group was established in 1996 as the owner of the SkyCity Auckland complex. In 1998 it took over operations of the complex from Harrah&#x27;s Entertainment.

The company&#x27;s shares are traded on both the Australian and New Zealand stock exchanges.

==History==

Since opening its original Auckland casino on 2 February 1996, SkyCity has expanded its operations to several New Zealand and Australian cities.

In June 2000, it bought the Adelaide Casino. It added another casino to its portfolio when it opened SkyCity Queenstown in the alpine resort of Queenstown.

In 2001, SkyCity bought a half share in cinema operator Force Corporation for $19.4 million and rebranded it as SkyCity Leisure.

In June 2004, the group acquired a 41% stake in the Christchurch Casino when it bought Aspinal Limited. Although the deal was opposed by Skyline Enterprises, the other owner of 41% stake, it was approved by the Casino Control Authority and the Commerce Commission. However, in 2012 SkyCity sold its shares to Skyline for $80 million and bought Skyline&#x27;s 40% stake in Queenstown Casino for $5 million.

In July 2004, SkyCity bought the Darwin Casino and Hotel from MGM Mirage and rebranded it as SkyCity Darwin.

In February 2010, the group sold its cinema operating business to Australian firm Amalgamated Holdings Limited (now Event Hospitality and Entertainment).

In October 2017, the group acquired NPT Limited&#x27;s interest in AA Centre in Auckland for NZ$47 million.

In November 2018, SkyCity sold the Darwin Casino to American company Delaware North for $188 million.

In June 2019, SkyCity obtained governmental permission to buy a 1.01-hectare parcel of land in Queenstown to develop a new hotel.

In August 2019, SkyCity launched its online gambling website, SkyCity Online Casino. The website is operated by Malta-based Gaming Innovation Group (GiG) on behalf of SkyCity&#x27;s Maltese subsidiary.

SkyCity casinos often depend to a large degree on several hundred high-stakes gamblers, often from East Asia, who may gamble hundreds of thousands of dollars in one visit to a casino. Reported net profit after tax (NPAT) was $128.7 million, with the Group seeing revenue exceed $1 billion for the first time in the company&#x27;s history .

As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, SkyCity announced 200 job losses in New Zealand on 3 April 2020, and a further 700 redundancies a month later, on 11 May. In 2020, SkyCity planned to raise new equity of $230 million as part of its pandemic recovery plan.

=== Management ===
Evan Davies was the founding Chief Executive, before leaving the group in 2008. During Davies&#x27; 11 years, the company grew from a single site to having business operations throughout New Zealand, South Australia and the Northern Territory. In April 2016, longtime CEO Nigel Morrison stepped down as managing director and chief Executive. Graeme Stephens was appointed as SkyCity&#x27;s chief Executive from May 2017 to December 2020, with chief Operating Officer Michael Ahearne stepping in as the new CEO from January 2021. Ahearne announced his resignation in October 2023 to take effect from March 2024.

In February 2024, a significant shift in the company&#x27;s leadership was announced. Callum Mallett, the then Chief Operating Officer of the New Zealand division, was set to step into the role of Interim CEO following the departure of Michael Ahearne in March 2024. Concurrently, Julian Cook, who was serving as the Board Chairman, decided to take on a more hands-on role in the company. He assumed the position of Executive Chairman, pledging to maintain this active involvement until a permanent CEO was appointed.

== Properties ==
The SkyCity group owns five casinos in Australia and New Zealand: SkyCity Auckland, SkyCity Hamilton, SkyCity Queenstown, SkyCity Wharf Casino and SkyCity Adelaide.

=== SkyCity Adelaide ===

Adelaide Casino was bought by SkyCity Entertainment Group in June 2000. Back then it had 767 gambling machines and 72 table games. Currently it has 990 gambling machines and 90 gambling tables. It has the only table gambling licence issued by the South Australian Government, giving it a monopoly over the gambling business in the state. In 2011 SkyCity financed a $339 million expansion project to make the casino closer to the city&#x27;s riverfront.

=== SkyCity Auckland ===

SkyCity Auckland is New Zealand&#x27;s largest casino. Located in Central Auckland, it provides table and slot machine gambling, with 1647 gambling machines and 110 gambling tables. The facility includes the Sky Tower, two hotels, convention centre, a 700-seat theatre, and more than 20 restaurants and bars with regular live bands, DJs and other entertainment. It opened on 2 February 1996.

SkyCity Hotel, Auckland is a four-star casino hotel. It is one of New Zealand&#x27;s busiest hotels and is located inside the main Auckland complex. It serves mainly families, business people and casino customers. It has 323 rooms.

SkyCity Grand Hotel is a five-star hotel and was officially opened by the Prime Minister, Helen Clark in April 2005. It is not located inside the main complex but is adjacent and is connected by a sky bridge. The Grand has 21 floors and 316 rooms.

In 2013, through a deal with the Government, SkyCity pledged to build a new convention centre catering for up to 3,500 guests and costing $NZ402 million, in exchange, it will get more gambling concessions. However, the construction was delayed due to cost increase, and on 22 October 2019 the building caught fire while still under construction.

=== SkyCity Hamilton ===
SkyCity Hamilton is a casino in Hamilton, New Zealand, that opened in September 2002. The casino is authorised to offer a maximum of 339 gambling machines and 23 tables. It has a restaurant and a bar, with live music and other performers on Friday and Saturday nights. It is part of the Riverside Centre on the Waikato River, which includes bars, restaurants and ten-pin bowling all operated by SkyCity Hamilton.

=== SkyCity Queenstown and SkyCity Wharf Casino ===
Queenstown is New Zealand&#x27;s only region that has two casinos, both are owned and operated by SkyCity. The two casinos are SkyCity Queenstown, opened in December 2000, with 86 gambling machines and 12 gambling tables, and the nearby SkyCity Wharf Casino, situated in the Steamer Wharf complex, with 74 gambling machines and 6 gambling tables. In 2018, the two relatively small casinos contributed only 1% of the company&#x27;s nearly $1 billion turnover.

==Former properties==

=== SkyCity Darwin ===
SkyCity Darwin, previously known as the MGM Grand Darwin, was the only casino in Darwin, the capital of the Northern Territory, Australia. SkyCity bought the casino, including a 5 star hotel, from MGM Mirage on 23 June 2004 for US$140 million. SkyCity Darwin housed 700 gambling machines and 40 gambling tables.

SkyCity sold the Darwin property to American company Delaware North in November 2018 for $188 million and it was subsequently renamed as Mindil Beach Casino &amp; Resort.

== Digital operations ==

=== SkyCity Online Casino ===
On 21 May 2019, SkyCity announced a long-term agreement with Malta-based Gaming Innovation Group (GiG) to supply technology for SkyCity&#x27;s new real-money online casino. SkyCity Online Casino, which operates using GiG&#x27;s Malta Gaming Authority online gambling licence, was launched in August 2019.

In December 2021, SkyCity invested NZ$42 million in GiG, making it its largest single shareholder with a stake of about 11 percent.

=== LetsPlay.Live ===
SkyCity entered the esports market in October 2017 when it formed a joint venture with Let&#x27;s Play Live Media (LPLM). SkyCity acquired a 40% stake in LPLM and built an esports broadcasting studio in the Sky Tower which opened in February 2018. Since July 2019, SkyCity has had full ownership of LPLM.

==Controversies==

=== COVID Wage Subsidies ===
Alongside other eligible New Zealand businesses, SkyCity Entertainment Group received significant financial support in the form of wage subsidies from the government as part of a widespread economic stimulus programme following the COVID-19 outbreak. After initially receiving NZ$21.6 million in taxpayer-funded assistance, the company received an additional tranche of NZ$9.4 million from the central government in July 2020. In all, SkyCity Entertainment Group received over $30 million from New Zealand taxpayers in 2020. Despite then subsequently posting a profit of over NZ$66.3 million, SkyCity steadfastly refused to repay the funds in spite of its bumper profits, a move which was widely condemned across the New Zealand political spectrum and identified as an example of the &quot;waste&quot; and &quot;fraud&quot; treasury had earlier warned of.

=== Financial Crime Allegations ===

==== Australia ====
On first week of June 2021, Australian Transaction Reports and Analysis Centre (AUSTRAC), the Australian financial crime watchdog, intimated SkyCity Entertainment Group along with Crown Resorts and Star Entertainment Group about &quot;potentially serious breaches&quot; of anti-money laundering regulations at their casinos in Adelaide, Perth and Sydney. AUSTRAC alleged that SkyCity Adelaide had contravened the Australian Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorism Financing Act (AML/CTF Act), and released a statement of claim against

In February 2024, SkyCity Entertainment Group announced to the market that an agreement was reached with AUSTRAC. SkyCity Entertainment Group and AUSTRAC jointly notified the Federal Court of Australia the agreement, and the company also announced an accounting provision of A$73 million in relation to the civil penalty and associated legal costs.

==== New Zealand ====
In December 2023, SkyCity Entertainment Group found itself under scrutiny in New Zealand when the Department of Internal Affairs (DIA), its regulatory body, initiated civil penalty proceedings. The proceedings were against SkyCity Casino Management Limited, a subsidiary of the group, for alleged violations of the New Zealand Anti-Money Laundering and Countering Financing of Terrorism Act 2009 (AML/CFT Act). The company, in conjunction with DIA, estimated that the maximum liability in relation to the claims would be NZ$8 million, although the case is ongoing.

=== Host Responsibility Allegations ===
In New Zealand and South Australia, casinos are required to adhere to a set of guidelines known as &quot;Host Responsibility&quot;. This involves a commitment to customer care, with a focus on preventing and minimizing harm related to gambling.

==== New Zealand ====
In September 2023, SkyCity Entertainment Group announced that the DIA had submitted an application to the Gambling Commission to temporarily suspend the license of SkyCity Casino Management Limited. The case is currently under review by the Gambling Commission, with a decision pending. Should the Commission rule in favor of suspension, it could result in a halt of operations at the company&#x27;s New Zealand casinos for a period of up to ten days.

In July 2024, SkyCity Auckland agreed to a five-day closure of its casino following an investigation by the Department of Internal Affairs, which found breaches of host responsibility requirements. The investigation, prompted by a complaint from a gambler who lost over $1 million, revealed 23 incidents of undetected continuous gambling between 2017 and 2021. The Department of Internal Affairs initially applied for a 10-day suspension of the casino&#x27;s license but settled on the five-day closure after SkyCity admitted its failings.

<text>Lilla Karlsö is a small Swedish island in the Baltic Sea, situated about off the west coast of Gotland and from Stora Karlsö; it is part of Eksta socken. During summer there are tour boats from Djupvik south of Klintehamn.

==Environment==
The island has an area of about and is high. Most of the island consists of a limestone plateau. Parts of the shoreline are bordered by steep cliffs. The island is mostly covered by alvar. There are several caves and up to high limestone pillars.

===Flora and fauna===
Since 1954, the island has been owned by the Swedish Society for Nature Conservation and it is now a nature reserve. It is mostly known for its rich flora and birdlife. There is some old broadleaf forest, which is unique for Gotland, and several rare plants for Sweden such as &quot;Lactuca quercina&quot; (called &#x27;Karlsösallat&#x27; in Swedish), hart&#x27;s-tongue fern and &quot;Petrorhagia prolifera&quot;. There are also colonies of several thousand pairs of guillemots and razorbills. Along with neighbouring Stora Karlsö, the island has been designated an Important Bird Area (IBA) by BirdLife International.

<doc id="725836" wikidata="Q2660736" url="?curid=725836" title="Magma (comics)">
<text>Magma (Amara Juliana Olivians Aquilla) is a character appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. Created by writer Chris Claremont, and artists Sal Buscema, Glynis Wein, and Bob McLeod, the character first appeared in &quot;The New Mutants&quot; #8 (October 1983). Amara Aquilla belongs to the subspecies of humans called mutants, who are born with superhuman abilities. She is known under the codenames Allison Crestmere and Magma. She was originally depicted as a young mutant aspiring to become a hero.

==Publication history==
Amara Aquilla debuted in &quot;The New Mutants&quot; #8 (October 1983), and appeared in that title regularly, until &quot;The New Mutants&quot; #57 (November 1987) when she departs the titular super-group to join their rivals, the Hellions. Along with the other New Mutants, she appeared as an occasional supporting character in &quot;Uncanny X-Men&quot;, with issue #189 (1985) as a salient issue featuring her conflict with Selene at the Hellfire Club. After her being dropped from the regular cast, &quot;The New Mutants&quot; featured two Magma solo stories, occupying the entirety of &quot;The New Mutants&quot; #62 (April 1988) and &quot;The New Mutants&quot; #81 (Nov. 1989). The latter was a fill-in issue written while she was still a regular cast member.

Magma appeared infrequently during the 1990s, but did take part in the &quot;Child&#x27;s Play&quot; crossover through &quot;X-Force&quot; #32-33 and &quot;The New Warriors&quot; #45-46 (1994). In &quot;X-Force&quot; #87-90 (1997), Magma appeared as an antagonist to her former teammates, but her villainous personality was short-lived as she returned to her affiliation with the X-Men in semi-regular publication in &quot;New Mutants&quot; Vol. 2 #3-4, #7-8, #11 and #13 (2003-2004) and as a team member in &quot;X-Treme X-Men&quot; #34-46 (2004). Magma then featured prominently as a member of the 198 remaining mutants on earth in the limited series &quot;X-Men: The 198&quot; #1-5 (2006) and then in &quot;Young X-Men&quot; #1-6 (2008) until returning to regular monthly publication in &quot;New Mutants&quot; Vol. 3 #1 (2009) wherein she remained as a regular character through issue #50 (2012).

==Fictional character biography==

===Early life===
Magma (Amara Juliana Olivians Aquilla) hails from the fictional country of Nova Roma (&quot;New Rome&quot;), a colony of the Roman Republic reportedly founded shortly after the death of Julius Caesar in 44 BC. The colony is hidden in the Amazon Rainforests of modern Brazil, and was ruled until recently by the immortal witch Selene. Amara is the daughter of Lucius Antonius Aquilla. He was presumably a member of the historical gens Antonia which claimed descent from Anton, son of Hercules. Growing up in Nova Roma, she had curly blonde hair, and wore a traditional white Roman toga.

Caught up in a deadly power struggle between Selene and her father, she disguises herself as an indigenous Brazilian and is captured by the New Mutants, who soon discovers her true ethnicity. Her powers manifest after she is abducted by Selene, who throws her into a lava pool. Amara is defeated by Selene, but later rescued by the New Mutants and adopts the name &#x27;Magma&#x27; as her heroic identity. At her father&#x27;s urging, she leaves Nova Roma, in the company of the New Mutants, to be taught by Charles Xavier.

===New Mutants===
After the New Mutants visit Nova Roma, Magma officially enters Xavier&#x27;s school and joins the New Mutants. She invades the Hellfire Club&#x27;s New York headquarters to battle Selene. She is fooled into joining a gladiatorial competition run by the insane Shadow King. She partners with Sunspot. Eventually, the efforts of her other friends free her and Sunspot from the cult-like control of the games.

Mistaking the New Mutants for the X-Men, the Enchantress kidnaps them during their Greek vacation and takes them to Asgard. The teleportation spell created by her teammate Magik goes awry when blocked by the Enchantress&#x27;s power. Thrown through time and space, Magma ends up in the elven realm. They trick her into eating and drinking, thus making her one of their own, body and mind. She participates in a raid on the Asgardian dwarves, where she is defeated by Cannonball. The dwarves, grateful to Cannonball, restore Magma&#x27;s mind, but they cannot restore her body. This becomes moot when the team is sent back home, with all magical alterations reversed. Some time later, she encounters Hercules, discovering he is one of the gods she worshiped.

After a time, Magma recognizes her grandmother, &quot;many times removed&quot; in a statue depicting the ancient lunar deity Selene. The witch Selene approaches her to claim having been both the model for the statue and the ancestor in question. Magma and the New Mutants clash with Emma Frost and her super-powered teens, the Hellions on multiple occasions. Despite the cruelties displayed by the Hellion Empath, Magma develops an attraction towards him. She recognizes this and is distressed by her feelings. Soon after, Magma leaves the New Mutants and joins the Hellions.

===Hellions===
She trains with the Hellions, and returns to South America with Empath. She later reveals to the New Mutants that her father arranged her engagement to a South American prince. She is captured by the High Evolutionary&#x27;s agents Dr. Stack and Purge, but is rescued by the New Mutants.

It is later revealed that Nova Roma is not Roman, but was created by Selene using mind control on British citizens to recreate Rome, and that Magma&#x27;s real name is Allison Crestmere. While still under the influence of the &quot;Allison&quot; persona, she briefly resurfaces as a member of the New Hellions.

===Return and going===
Later, she is one of the mutants who appears crucified on the X-Men&#x27;s lawn. While she is saved by a transfusion of Archangel&#x27;s blood, when she goes to sleep, she lapses into a deep coma. She is forcibly revived by Elixir, a traumatic event which prompts her to destroy the infirmary and flee in a rage. Further telepathic contact with Magma is rebuffed.

===Rejoining the X-Men===
When she eventually arrives in Los Angeles, as Amara once more, she meets up with Cannonball, who had joined a splinter team of X-Men. She aids this team for a time, and when the &quot;Allison Crestmere&quot; identity is brought up by Cannonball, Magma reveals that Elixir&#x27;s healing had removed the &quot;Allison&quot; personality, she now realizes that it was, in fact, a deception.

Amara returns to the school for a while. When her friend Wolfsbane had to leave, Magma takes over her advisory role, becoming the leader of the Paragons.

Magma is part of the X-Treme Sanctions Executive, although she is never seen as taking part of any missions on-panel.

===Post M-Day===
Due to the events of House of M and the Decimation of mutants, Magma loses her boyfriend while the two are exploring the inside of a volcano at the exact moment that the depowering wave of the Scarlet Witch runs across Earth. His death temporarily drives her insane causing her to make the volcano erupt and attack a nearby town. She is later apprehended by Empath and brought to the Xavier Institute where she shares a tent with Skids and Outlaw. She then falls victim to being manipulated by the mutant Johnny Dee who is infatuated with her. Because of previous experience with being emotionally controlled, she incorrectly blames Empath who denies her accusations.

===Young X-Men===
Along with former New Mutants, Danielle Moonstar, Cannonball, and Sunspot, Magma appeared to be a member of the newest incarnation of the Brotherhood of Mutants, as claimed by Cyclops. She is one of the first members targeted by the new team of X-Men, composed primarily of former Xavier Institute students. During the battle, Amara turns Dust into glass by superheating her sand form, shatters Rockslide (who later reforms), and is eventually taken out by Wolf Cub. She is held in a holding cell in the custody of Cyclops. It is eventually revealed that &quot;Cyclops&quot; is in reality Donald Pierce, the former White King of the Hellfire Club, who is posing as the X-Men leader using an image inducer. Pierce&#x27;s reasons for recruiting these &quot;X-Men&quot; is currently unknown, but it was revealed that Pierce utilized the ruse that Magma and her allies formed a new Brotherhood in order to convince the former students to attack their former teachers and allies. She later helps to capture him and then relocates to San Francisco.

===Reforming the New Mutants===
After receiving an anonymous tip in Colorado about a young mutant endangering a small town, Dani and Shan are sent to investigate and calm the locals. During their mission, Magik reappears back at the X-Men&#x27;s base in San Francisco after teleporting off into the future after the events of &quot;X-Infernus&quot;. Upon her return, Magik informs Sam and Roberto that Shan and Dani are in trouble, a situation that will result in their deaths. Amara is visiting with Empath in his cell when she is called away by Sam. Amara questions as to whether Illyana is the real Illyana. Sam assembles a team of X-Men consisting of himself, Sunspot, Magma, and Magik to go find Dani and Shan. While en route, Illyana asks Magma why she visits Empath in his cell since he tried to kill her friends and asks if she still loves him. Magma stumbles to answer and Magik accuses her of still having feelings for Empath. Magik then tells Magma that she will help cure Empath if Magma wishes and will keep the whole thing a secret from the others.

While searching for Shan and Dani in Colorado, the girls split up and Sam and Roberto come across a tied up and unconscious Shan in the back of a bar, while Magik and Magma are tricked into freeing Legion from a box. The personalities in Legion&#x27;s mind want to kill Dani because she can help Legion get them under control. Legion locates Dani in a jail cell and is about to kill her when Sam stops him. Legion is forced outside where he distracts Sam and Sunspot while again trying to kill Dani, only to be stopped by Magma and Magik. After Legion takes out Sunspot, Magma attacks Legion, who manages to counter her attacks by making her feel extremely cold, taking her out of the fight.

===Utopia===
Magma is mentioned by Pixie as one of the first mutants being teleported to Utopia, the X-Men&#x27;s new island home. She is later seen alongside Match during the final fight against Norman Osborn&#x27;s forces, throwing fire at Venom, as well as lighting a small area on fire around Colossus during his fight with Venom.

===Necrosha===
Magma is targeted by Selene, who wants her dead. Selene sends Magma&#x27;s former teammate Cypher to kill her. After breaking into her room, he surprises Amara, viciously beating her unconscious and dragging her body to the kitchen for Amara&#x27;s teammates to see before he engages them in battle. During the fight, the deceased Hellions show up to reclaim Doug while the New Mutants teleport away. The New Mutants split up, with Dani and Sunspot taking Amara to Utopia&#x27;s medical lab. On the way they are attacked by Feral, who is quickly taken out by Sunspot and Dani. Upon arriving at the lab, Doctor Nemesis injects Amara with a serum which activates her powers and heals most of her wounds.

While she is still recovering from her wounds, Doug arrives to apologize. At first Amara tells him to leave, but he convinces Amara to hear him out by communicating with her in a special language he designed for her. She then thanks him and welcomes him back.

===Second Coming===
When Cable and Hope Summers arrive back from the future, Bastion and his Purifiers attempt to kill them. The New Mutants are sent to gather intel on weapons being produced by Cameron Hodge in St. Louis. After arriving back on Utopia, Amara hears a series of explosions, and she, Namor, and X-23 find that Donald Pierce has destroyed the X-Men&#x27;s hangar. Amara then goes with a team of X-Men to help out in San Francisco when the city is surrounded by a giant, impenetrable dome. Upon discovering a giant sphere on the Golden Gate Bridge, the X-Men investigate, and several Nimrod Sentinels emerge. After defeating the first fleet of Nimrods, Amara stands guard with several other X-Men, awaiting more.

===Fall of the New Mutants===
After the events of the &quot;Second Coming&quot; storyline, the New Mutants take a vacation, which is interrupted when Magik discovers that Pixie has been kidnapped by a mysterious military faction known as Project Purgatory. After traveling to Limbo for days searching for her, the New Mutants are attacked by the mutant babies gathered during &quot;Inferno&quot;, now adults working with Project Purgatory. During the fight, Amara is the last to be captured after Trista uses Face to knock her out. Amara is then held captive along with Sunspot. Eventually, Illyana is placed in their cell and after being asked by Roberto how Amara dies, Illyana tells him she does not love him like he loves her and to listen carefully.

===Rise of the New Mutants===
After Magik, Pixie and Karma escape back to Utopia, Amara remains a captive of Project Purgatory along with the remaining New Mutants in Limbo. She is eventually freed by Dani and upon exiting the compound, sees that Project Purgatory have summoned the Elder Gods and torn a hole right through to Earth. Amara sees the past version of Magik who helped reform the New Mutants and tries to warn her about what&#x27;s to come but is stopped by Roberto. He reveals that if she goes by herself to warn Illyana, she will die. Working together, Sunspot holds off a horde while Amara goes to Illyana. Three days later, Amara is seen tending to Roberto in the infirmary.

===Unfinished Business===
After Dani Moonstar learns Cyclops is still keeping the New Mutants together to settle some of the X-Men&#x27;s unfinished business; several members leave due to injury or personal issues. Magma remains on the team alongside Dani Moonstar, Cypher, Warlock and Sunspot. Their first mission is to track down X-Man, who had been kidnapped by Sugar Man.

=== Fear Itself ===
After Dani is summoned to Hel by Hela during an attack by the Draumar, Amara and the rest of the New Mutants go looking for her. They seek help from Magik, who points them to a spell that can get the team to Hel. Cypher performs the spell but accidentally transports the team to Mephisto&#x27;s hell. While there, Mephisto takes a special interest in Amara. Sunspot attempts to attack him when he won&#x27;t leave the team alone, but Amara intervenes. Impressed by Amara&#x27;s display of power, Mephisto apologizes and offers to help the team in exchange for a single date with her. The other members of the team advise against the deal, but Amara accepts. With a flick of his wrist, the team are teleported to Hel.

Arriving in Hel, Sunspot is upset Amara made a deal with the devil when they come across a battle outside Hela&#x27;s palace between the undead and the Draumar. After finding Dani and Hela, the New Mutants drive back the Draumar and Hela transports the team back to Utopia.

===Regenesis and dating Mephisto===
Following the events of X-Men: Schism, Amara is seen discussing the idea of going to Westchester with Sunspot. Bobby brings up the idea of getting a place together in San Francisco, but she turns him down. Later she moves in with the rest of the New Mutants when they decide to get a place together in the city. Amara later takes part in a mission to locate Blink and uses her abilities to stop an earthquake. During the mission, she makes it clear to Bobby that she is not interested in him anymore.

Around this time, Mephisto comes to collect on his debt and escorts Magma on their date. Taking Amara to the third circle of hell, he goes overboard trying to impress her, but Amara becomes overwhelmed; revealing she is too fearful to enjoy the date in case he tries to trick her into another deal. Mephisto shocks Amara by revealing that despite being the personification of evil, he feels human emotions and just wants to have a normal date. Returning to San Francisco to continue their date, they end up having a good time with Mephisto asking if he can call her again.

Sometime later, Cypher experiences a nightmare regarding the Ani-Mator; the team head back to Paradise Island to find it has changed dramatically. They locate Bird-Brain who attacks and infects the squad with a virus. During the mission, Bobby makes several passive-aggressive remarks about Amara&#x27;s relationship with Mephisto. Bobby eventually collapses from exhaustion and Amara cares for him. The pair are partially assimilated into the Ani-Mator&#x27;s new body but are freed thanks to Cypher and Warlock.

Blink eventually returns to visit the team and whisks them to Madripoor for a vacation. During the trip, Amara reveals to Clarice she has still been seeing Mephisto and asks her not to tell anyone. Eventually Mephisto&#x27;s relationship with Magma collapses after she uncovered his dealings with the Disir, which caused her to call off any chance of furthering their relationship, much to his displeasure.

===Fearless Defenders===
After the New Mutants disband, Dani joins a new female incarnation of the Defenders. During a moment of downtime, Dani invites Amara to New Amazonia where she comments it reminds her of Nova Roma. During her stay, Hippolyta explains that she has been charged by the Death-Lords to rebuild the ranks of the Amazons in exchange for her resurrection. The following morning, New Amazonia is attacked by Aradnea, Echidna, and Echidna&#x27;s sea-monsters on-orders from Caroline Le Fey. Amara powers up and goes straight for the &quot;big one&quot;. After the monsters are defeated, Caroline reveals that the attack was a test and offers to become the Amazons&#x27; queen.

===X-Men: Gold===
In the wake of the conflict between mutants and Inhumans, anti-mutant activist Lydia Nance hired Mesmero to assemble a new Brotherhood of Evil Mutants, whose acts of terrorism she used to propel her platform. Magma is revealed to be one of the members when they attack the United Nations and are confronted by Kitty Pryde&#x27;s squad of X-Men. Magma and the Brotherhood eventually escape and kidnap the mayor of New York City, Bill de Blasio. It was also discovered by the X-Men that Mesmero had used his powers to brainwash the members of his Brotherhood to join the team and force them to carry out those attacks. Once his control was broken, Mesmero&#x27;s Brotherhood was dissolved, and except for Amara, the rest of the team were handed over to S.H.I.E.L.D., ultimately leading to its disbandment. Following the ordeal, Amara decides to stay with the X-Men to recuperate.

Later when Rachel Summers is injured on a mission, Amara is seen watching over her in the medical bay with Cecilia Reyes, showing great concern over her condition. She is later called back into the medical bay when Rachel&#x27;s hound marks reappear on her face.

Mesmero eventually escapes from the Box, a prison designed to hold mutants and persuades the new Pyro and Avalanche to help him get revenge on Lydia Nance by attacking her at a fundraiser. Magma demands to join the mission, but Kitty expresses concern about having her along, fearing she might be emotionally compromised. Kitty orders Nightcrawler to keep an eye on her and they teleport to the yacht; Amara ignores orders and goes straight for Mesmero who knocks her out. Kurt teleports her unconscious body back to the mansion and she is not present when the rest of the X-Men are arrested and imprisoned.

After she recovers, Amara joins Iceman&#x27;s squad of interim X-Men consisting of Rogue, Ink, Armor, Magik and the new Pyro, Simon Lasker. Their first mission as a team is to stop the Shredded Man. Once the mission is over, they head to Paris, France to stop Scythian. They team up with Captain Britain and Meggan while Magik goes to fetch the imprisoned X-Men. Working together, they manage to send him to Limbo.

=== X-Men Disassembled ===
Magma was one of the many mutants that opposed the crazed X-Man from remaking the world in his image. When X-Man realized that his vision of the world would never come about with the X-Men around, X-Man made his enemies vanish in an instant, including Magma.

=== House of X ===
Magma later became a resident of the mutant nation of Krakoa during the &quot;House of X&quot;. While there she joined the New Mutants on a mission to bring some mutants from her home town of Nova Roma to Krakoa and to save a young mutant from Carnelia who could not control her powers. She also attempted to cause a volcanic eruption to help free the mutants who were wrongfully imprisoned in the Pit of Exile.

==Powers and abilities==

Magma is a mutant with geothermal powers. These grant her control over tectonic plates, even to the extent of causing seismic upheaval. Amara&#x27;s powers allow her to be so in-tune with the Earth, she is able to sense seismic activity and prevent earthquakes before they happen. She can also call forth molten rock from the Earth&#x27;s core, producing projectiles composed of lava, or miniature volcanoes.

When using her powers, Magma typically assumes an energized form that emits intense light and heat. While in this form, Amara can increase the temperature around her to the point where anything around her will melt like metal weapons will melt before inflicting her with any damage. On another occasion, she has demonstrated this ability without assuming her energized form by heating up the room at a Hellfire Club party causing everyone in the room to sweat to the point of dehydration and blacking out. She can also create orbs of a fire-like substance and use them as projectiles or a source of light. Although Magma has triggered small earth tremors without taking on her energized form, she has never been seen to use her power to control lava while in her ordinary human appearance. On M-Day, she traveled within the heated gases of an active volcano, and demonstrates an immunity to volcanic gases, heat, and flame.

In addition, Amara possesses certain regenerative powers when in contact with the ground. Even when she was once affected by Selene&#x27;s life-draining touch, she recovered quickly enough to aid the New Mutants in battle. If she is not in contact with the ground or the physical shock to her system from a single injury is too great, the regenerative power is no longer in effect and she may die. Dr. Nemesis discovered that Magma is also able to recover from laceration wounds in her human form by changing to her energized form, the intense heat cauterizing and sealing any wounds. Since the late 2000s, Amara has also displayed the power of flight. However, this power has been inconsistently portrayed as in some of her recent appearances in &quot;X-Men: Gold&quot; show Magma flying but also being carried around by Rogue and Captain Britain.

Due to her Nova Roman heritage, Magma is well versed in Roman culture, including the Latin language, and is a skilled swordswoman.

==Reception==
In 2014, &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; ranked Magma 79th in their &quot;Let&#x27;s rank every X-Man ever&quot; list.

Chase Magnett of &quot;ComicBook.com&quot; described Magma as a &quot;charming firebrand, both literally and figuratively,&quot; writing, &quot;Creators ought to ignore whatever parts of her past that confuse the character and focus on a personality that warms up a room even more than her powers might.&quot;

==Other versions==
===Age of Apocalypse===
In the &quot;Age of Apocalypse&quot;, Amara, like many other young mutants, is recruited by Apocalypse and became one of his assassins. Fanatical and in total control of her powers, Magma is sent to London to eliminate the leadership of the Human High Council. The attack is foiled by Weapon X (Logan), who kills Amara. The assassination attempt is actually a provocation on Apocalypse&#x27;s behalf, who wants the Human High Council to amass its fleets, making them more vulnerable to be destroyed.

===Age of X-Man===
In the &quot;Age of X-Man&quot; series, Magma and the others were transported to another plane of existence by X-Man created in an attempt at a utopia where they and all other mutants would be at peace, altering their memories so they would not resist. Magma became the main stunt coordinator of all the movies that are filmed at Studio X, which mainly featured actors Nightcrawler and Meggan Puceanu.

Amara flirted with Kurt and asked him about going to the fan dinner, which annoyed Meggan because she liked him as well. Later at the dinner, Amara defended the Stepford Cuckoos, saying that the Studio wouldn&#x27;t be running as smoothly if the girls were not around, after a group were disgusted by how the sisters flaunted their familial relationship.

While not observed, Magma was presumably returned to the real world when X-Man decided to release the mutants he forced to live in his plane of existence.

===Days of Future Past===
In an alternate version of the &quot;Days of Future Past&quot; future, a war between mutants and baseline humans, started by the latter, results in a mutant victory thanks to an alliance between Xavier&#x27;s Institute and the Hellfire Club. Magma and Sunspot become the Chief Arbitrators of the Lords Cardinal, and create an idyllic state for mutants, while regular humans are left to fend for themselves. Mutants born to baseline humans are taken from their parents and those who oppose Magma and Sunspot are brainwashed by the Hellfire Club&#x27;s agents.

===X-Men: The End===
In &quot;X-Men: The End&quot;, Magma is seen fighting alongside the other X-Men against the Warskrulls who invade the mansion.

===Ultimate Marvel===
Ultimate Magma is featured as a former mutant prisoner of Camp: Angel and joined Kitty Pryde&#x27;s resistance in the Ultimate Marvel title, &quot;Ultimate Comics: X-Men&quot;. She is later seen as part of a re-formed X-Men team, looking to leave Manhattan because Galactus is attacking. However, the entire X-Men team is recruited by S.H.I.E.L.D. who need mainly Kitty, Magma is seen later defending Utopia against militia members.

<doc id="725839" wikidata="Q163995" url="?curid=725839" title="Emirates Stadium">
<text>The Emirates Stadium (known as Arsenal Stadium for UEFA competitions) is a football stadium in Holloway, London, England. It has been the home stadium of Arsenal Football Club since its completion in 2006. Arsenal&#x27;s women&#x27;s team made the stadium their home in 2024. It has a current seated capacity of 60,704, making it one of the largest football stadiums in England by capacity.

In 1997, Arsenal explored the possibility of relocating to a new stadium, having been denied planning permission by Islington Council to expand its home stadium, Highbury. After considering various options (including purchasing Wembley Stadium), the club bought an industrial and waste disposal estate in Ashburton Grove in 2000. A year later, they received the council&#x27;s approval to build a stadium on the site; manager Arsène Wenger described this as the &quot;biggest decision in Arsenal&#x27;s history&quot; since the board appointed Herbert Chapman in the 1920s. Relocation plans began in 2002, but financial difficulties delayed work until 2004. Emirates was later announced as the main sponsor for the stadium. The entire stadium project was completed in 2006 at a cost of £390 million. The club&#x27;s former stadium was redeveloped as Highbury Square, an apartment complex.

The quality of Arsenal&#x27;s pitch and groundsmanship have been recognised internationally and lead to it being nicknamed &quot;the Carpet&quot; by matchgoing fans and the wider sports media. Since 2009, the stadium has undergone a process of &quot;Arsenalisation&quot; with an aim of restoring visible links to Arsenal&#x27;s history. The stadium hosts international football fixtures (including often acting as a de facto ground of the Brazil national team in Europe), as well as hosting international music acts on a regular basis.

==History==
===Background===
Spectator safety at football grounds was a major concern during the 1980s, following incidents of hooliganism, and disasters such as the Bradford City stadium fire and the Heysel Stadium disaster in 1985, and the Hillsborough disaster in 1989. The Taylor Report into the Hillsborough tragedy was finalised in January 1990 and recommended the removal of terraces (standing areas) in favour of seating.

Under the amended Football Spectators Act 1989, it became compulsory for first and second tier English clubs to have their stadia all-seated in time for the 1994–95 season. Arsenal, like many other clubs, experienced difficulty raising income for converted terraced areas. At the end of the 1990–91 season, the club introduced a bond scheme which offered supporters the right to purchase a season ticket at its renovated North Bank stand of Highbury. The board felt this was the only viable option after considering other proposals; they did not want to compromise on traditions nor curb manager George Graham&#x27;s transfer dealings. At a price of between £1,000 to £1,500, the 150-year bond was criticised by supporters, who argued it potentially blocked the participation of those less well-off from supporting Arsenal. A campaign directed by the Independent Arsenal Supporters&#x27; Association brought relative success as only a third of all bonds were sold.

The North Bank was the final stand to be refurbished. It opened in August 1993 at a cost of £20 million. The rework significantly reduced the stadium&#x27;s capacity, from 57,000 at the beginning of the decade to under 40,000. High ticket prices to serve the club&#x27;s existing debts and low attendance figures forced Arsenal to explore the possibility of building a larger stadium in 1997. The club wanted to attract an evergrowing fanbase and financially compete with the biggest clubs in England. By comparison, Manchester United enjoyed a rise in gate receipts; the club went from £43.9 million in 1994 to £87.9 million in 1997 because of Old Trafford&#x27;s expansion.

Arsenal&#x27;s initial proposal to rebuild Highbury was met with disapproval from local residents, as it required the demolition of 25 neighbouring houses. It later became problematic once the East Stand of the stadium was granted Grade II listing in July 1997. After much consultation, the club abandoned its plan, deciding a capacity of 48,000 was not large enough. Arsenal then investigated the possibility of relocating to Wembley Stadium and in March 1998 made an official bid to purchase the ground. The Football Association (FA) and the English National Stadium Trust opposed Arsenal&#x27;s offer, claiming it harmed England&#x27;s bid for the 2006 FIFA World Cup, which FIFA itself denied. In April 1998, Arsenal withdrew its bid and Wembley was purchased by the English National Stadium Trust. The club however was given permission to host its UEFA Champions League home ties at Wembley for the 1998–99 and 1999–2000 seasons. Although Arsenal&#x27;s time in the competition was brief, twice exiting the group stages, the club set its record home attendance (73,707 against Lens) and earned record gate income in the 1998–99 season, highlighting potential profitability.

===Site selection and development proposals===
In November 1999, Arsenal examined the feasibility of building a new stadium in Ashburton Grove. Anthony Spencer, estate agent and club property adviser, recommended the area to director Danny Fiszman and vice-chairman David Dein having scoured over North London for potential areas. The land, from Highbury was composed of a rubbish processing plant and industrial estate, 80% owned to varying levels by Islington Council, Railtrack and Sainsbury&#x27;s. After passing the first significant milestone at Islington Council&#x27;s planning committee, Arsenal submitted a planning application for a new-build 60,000 seater stadium in November 2000. This included a redevelopment project at Drayton Park, converting the existing ground Highbury to flats and building a new waste station in Lough Road. As part of the scheme, Arsenal intended to create 1,800 new jobs for the community and 2,300 new homes. Improvements to three railway stations, Holloway Road, Drayton Park and Finsbury Park, were included to cope with the increased capacity requirements from matchday crowds.

Islington Stadium Communities Alliance (ISCA) – an alliance of 16 groups representing local residents and businesses, was set up in January 2000 as a body against the redevelopment. Alison Carmichael, a spokeswoman for the group, said of the move, &quot;It may look like Arsenal are doing great things for the area, but in its detail the plan is awful. We blame the council; the football club just wants to expand to make more money.&quot; Tom Lamb, an ISCA member, was concerned about as air pollution and growing traffic, adding &quot;that is a consequence which most Arsenal fans would never see, because they are in Islington only for about thirty days a year.&quot;

Seven months after the planning application was submitted, a poll showed that 75% of respondents (2,133 residents) were against the scheme. By October 2001, the club asserted that a poll of Islington residents found that 70% were in favour, and received the backing from the then Mayor of London, Ken Livingstone. The club launched a campaign to aid the project in the run up to Christmas and planted the slogan &quot;Let Arsenal support Islington&quot; on advertising hoardings and in the backdrop of manager Arsène Wenger&#x27;s press conferences.

Islington Council approved Arsenal&#x27;s planning application on 10 December 2001, voting in favour of the Ashburton Grove development. The council also consented to the transfer of the existing waste recycling plant in Ashburton Grove to Lough Road. Livingstone approved the plans a month later, and it was then motioned to then-Transport Secretary Stephen Byers, who initially delayed making a final decision. He had considered whether to refer the scheme to a public inquiry, but eventually decided not to. Planning permission was granted by Islington Council in May 2002, but local residents and ISCA launched a late challenge to the High Court, arguing the plans were against the law. Duncan Ouseley dismissed the case in July 2002, paving the way for Arsenal to start work.

The club succeeded in a further legal challenge bought by small firms in January 2005 as the High Court upheld a decision by then-Deputy Prime Minister John Prescott to grant a compulsory purchase order in support of the scheme. The stadium later became issue in the local elections in May 2006. The Metropolitan Police restricted supporters&#x27; coaches to being parked in the nearby Sobel Sports Centre rather than in the underground stadium car park, and restricted access to 14 streets on match days. These police restrictions were conditions of the stadiums&#x27; health and safety certificate which the stadium requires to operate and open. The road closures were passed at a council meeting in July 2005.

===Finance and naming===
Securing finance for the stadium project proved a challenge as Arsenal received no public subsidy from the government. Whereas Wenger claimed French clubs &quot;pay nothing at all for their stadium, nothing at all for their maintenance&quot;, and &quot;Bayern Munich paid one euro for their ground&quot;, Arsenal were required to buy the site outright in one of London&#x27;s most expensive areas. The club therefore sought other ways of generating income, such as making a profit on player trading. Arsenal recouped over £50 million from transfers involving Nicolas Anelka to Real Madrid, and Marc Overmars and Emmanuel Petit to Barcelona. The transfer of Anelka partly funded the club&#x27;s new training ground, in London Colney, which opened in October 1999.
The club also agreed new sponsorship deals. In September 2000, Granada Media Group purchased a 5% stake in Arsenal for £47 million. As part of the acquisition, Granada became the premier media agent for Arsenal, handling advertising, sponsorship, merchandising, publishing and licensing agreements. The club&#x27;s managing director Keith Edelman confirmed in a statement that the investment would be used directly to fund for the new stadium. The collapse of ITV Digital (part-owned by Granada) in April 2002 coincided with news that the company was tied in to pay £30 million once arrangements for the new stadium were finalised.

In September 2002, Arsenal formulated plans to reduce its players&#x27; wage bill after making a pre-tax loss of £22.3 million for the 2001–02 financial year. The club appointed N M Rothschild &amp; Sons to examine its financial situation and advise whether it was feasible for construction to press ahead at the end of March 2003. Although Arsenal secured a £260 million loan from a group of banks led by the Royal Bank of Scotland, the club suspended work on Ashburton Grove in April 2003, saying, &quot;We have experienced a number of delays in arrangements for our new stadium project in recent months across a range of issues. The impact of these delays is that we will now be unable to deliver a stadium opening for the start of the 2005–06 season.&quot; The cost of building the stadium, forecasted at £400 million, had risen by £100 million during that period.

Throughout the summer of 2003, Arsenal gave fans the opportunity to register their interest in a relaunched bond scheme. The club planned to issue 3,000 bonds for between £3,500 and £5,000 each for a season ticket at Highbury, then at Ashburton Grove. Supporters reacted negatively to the news; AISA chairman Steven Powell said in a statement: &quot;We are disappointed that the club has not consulted supporters before announcing a new bond scheme.&quot; Though Arsenal never stated how many bonds were sold, they did raise several million pounds through the scheme. The club also extended its contract with sportswear provider Nike, in a deal worth £55 million over seven years. Nike paid a minimum of £1 million each year as a royalty payment, contingent on sales.

Funding for the stadium was secured in February 2004. Later in the year Emirates bought naming rights for the stadium, in a 15-year deal estimated at £100 million that also included a 7-year shirt sponsorship, starting in the 2006–07 season. Emirates and Arsenal agreed to a new deal worth £150 million in November 2012, and shirt-sponsorship was extended to five years while naming rights were extended to 2028; a further extension of the shirt sponsorship rights was announced in August 2023, also taking that deal through 2028.

The stadium name is colloquially shortened from &quot;Emirates Stadium&quot; to &quot;The Emirates&quot;, although some supporters continue to use the former name &quot;Ashburton Grove&quot; or &quot;The Grove&quot; to refer to the stadium, particularly by those who object to the concept of corporate sponsorship of stadium names. Due to UEFA regulations on stadium sponsors, the ground is referred to as Arsenal Stadium for European matches, which was also the official name of Highbury.

===Construction and opening===
Actual construction of the stadium began once Arsenal secured funding. The club appointed Sir Robert McAlpine in January 2002 to carry out building work and the stadium was designed by Populous, who were the architects for Stadium Australia (home of the 2000 Olympics and the South Sydney Rabbitohs NRL club) and the redevelopment of Ascot Racecourse. Construction consultants Arcadis and engineering firm Buro Happold were also involved in the process.

The first phase of demolition was completed by March 2004, and two months later, stand pilings on the West, East and North stands had been concluded. Two bridges over the Northern City railway line connecting the stadium to Drayton Park were also built; these were completed in August 2004. The stadium topped out in August 2005 and external glazing, power and water tank installation was completed by December 2005. The first seat in the new stadium was ceremonially installed on 13 March 2006 by Arsenal midfielder Abou Diaby. DD GrassMaster was selected as the pitch installer and Hewitt Sportsturf was contracted to design and construct the playing field. Floodlights were successfully tested for the first time on 25 June 2006, and a day later, the goalposts were erected.

In order to obtain the licences needed to open, the Emirates Stadium hosted three non-full capacity events. The first &quot;ramp-up&quot; event was a shareholder open day on 18 July 2006, the second an open training session for 20,000 selected club members held two days later. The third event was Dennis Bergkamp&#x27;s testimonial match against Ajax on 22 July 2006. The Emirates Stadium was officially opened by Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh on 26 October 2006; his wife Queen Elizabeth II had suffered a back injury and was unable to carry out her duty. Prince Philip quipped to the crowd, &quot;Well, you may not have my wife, but you&#x27;ve got the &quot;second&quot;-most experienced plaque unveiler in the world.&quot; The royal visit echoed the attendance of the Queen&#x27;s uncle, the Prince of Wales (later King Edward VIII) at the official opening of Highbury&#x27;s West Stand in 1932. As a result of the change of plan, the Queen extended to the club the honour of inviting the chairman, manager and first team to join her for afternoon tea at Buckingham Palace. Held on 15 February 2007, the engagement marked the first time a football club had been invited to the palace for such an event.

===Loan repayments===
Interest on the £260 million debt was set at a commercial fixed rate over a 14-year period. To refinance the cost, Arsenal planned to convert the money into a 30-year bond financed by banks.
The proposed bond issue went ahead in July 2006. Arsenal issued £210 million worth of 13.5-year bonds with a spread of 52 basis points over government bonds and £50 million of 7.1-year bonds with a spread of 22 basis points over LIBOR. It was the first publicly marketed, asset-backed bond issue by a European football club. The effective interest rate on these bonds is 5.14% and 5.97%, respectively, and are due to be paid back over a 25-year period; the move to bonds has reduced the club&#x27;s annual debt service cost to approximately £20 million a year. In September 2010, Arsenal announced that the Highbury Square development – one of the main sources of income to reduce the stadium debt – was now debt free and making revenue.

When Arsenal moved to the Emirates Stadium, the club prioritised repaying the loans over strengthening the playing squad. Arsenal&#x27;s self-sustaining model relied heavily on qualifying for the UEFA Champions League; as Wenger recalled in 2016: &quot;We had to be three years in the Champions League out of five and have an average of 54,000 people, and we didn&#x27;t know we would be capable of that.&quot; The club sold several experienced players throughout the late 2000s and early 2010s and raised ticket prices, upsetting supporters who have called for change. Wenger took umbrage over criticism and revealed the bank loans were contingent on his commitment to the club: &quot;The banks wanted the technical consistency to guarantee that we have a chance to pay [them] back. I did commit and I stayed and under very difficult circumstances. So for me to come back and on top of that [critics] reproach me for not having won the championship during that period it is a bit overboard.&quot; Wenger later described the stadium move as the toughest period of his life because of the restricted finances in place.

===Arsenalisation===

In August 2009, Arsenal began a programme of &quot;Arsenalisation&quot; of the Emirates Stadium after listening to feedback from supporters in a forum. The intention was to turn the stadium into a &quot;visible stronghold of all things Arsenal through a variety of artistic and creative means&quot;, led by Arsenal chief executive Ivan Gazidis.

Among the first changes were white seats installed in the pattern of the club&#x27;s trademark cannon, located in the lower level stands opposite the entrance tunnel. &quot;The Spirit of Highbury&quot;, a shrine depicting every player to have played for Arsenal during its 93-year residence, was erected in late 2009 outside the stadium at the south end. Eight large murals on the exterior of the stadium were installed, each depicting four Arsenal legends linking arms, such that the effect of the completed design is 32 legends in a huddle embracing the stadium:

Around the lower concourse of the stadium are additional murals depicting 12 &quot;greatest moments&quot; in Arsenal history, voted for by a poll on the club&#x27;s website. Prior to the start of the 2010–11 season, Arsenal renamed the coloured seating quadrants of the ground as the East Stand, West Stand, North Bank, and Clock End. Akin to Highbury, this involved the installation of a clock above the newly renamed Clock End which was unveiled in a league match against Blackpool. In April 2011, Arsenal renamed two bridges near the stadium in honour of club directors Ken Friar and Danny Fiszman. As part of the club&#x27;s 125 anniversary celebrations in December 2011, Arsenal unveiled three statues of former captain Tony Adams, record goalscorer Thierry Henry and manager Herbert Chapman outside of the stadium.
Before Arsenal&#x27;s match against Sunderland in February 2014, the club unveiled a statue of former striker Dennis Bergkamp, outside the west stand of Emirates Stadium.

Banners and flags, often designed by supporters group REDaction, are hung around the ground. A large &quot;49&quot; flag, representing the record run of 49 unbeaten league games, is passed around the lower tier before kick off.

==Structure and facilities==

Described as &quot;beautiful&quot; and &quot;intimidating&quot; by architect Christopher Lee of Populous, the Emirates Stadium is a four-tiered bowl with translucent polycarbonate roofing over the stands, but not over the pitch. The underside is clad with metallic panels and the roof is supported by four triangular trusses, made of welded tubular steel. Two trusses span in a north–south direction while a further two span an east–west direction. The trusses are supported by the stadium&#x27;s vertical concrete cores, eight of which connected to them by steel tripods. They in turn each house four stairways, a passenger lift as well as service access. Façades are either glazed or woven between the cores which allows visitors on the podium to see inside the stadium. The glass and steel construction was devised by Populous to give an impression that the stadium sparkles in sunlight and glows in the night.

The upper and lower parts of the stadium feature standard seating. The stadium has two levels below ground that house its support facilities such as commercial kitchens, changing rooms and press and education centres. The main middle tier, known as the &quot;Club Level&quot;, is premium priced and also includes the director&#x27;s box. There are 7,139 seats at this level, which are sold on licences lasting from one to four years. Immediately above the club tier there is a small circle consisting of 150 boxes of 10, 12 and 15 seats. The total number of spectators at this level is 2,222. The high demand for tickets, as well as the relative wealth of their London fans, means revenue from premium seating and corporate boxes is nearly as high as the revenue from the entire stadium at Highbury.

The upper tier is contoured to leave open space in the corners of the ground, and the roof is significantly canted inwards. Both of these features are meant to provide as much airflow and sunlight to the pitch as possible. Supporters in the upper tier on one side of the ground are unable to see supporters in the upper tier opposite. As part of a deal with Sony, the stadium was the first in the world to incorporate HDTV streaming. In the north-west and south-east corners of the stadium are two giant screens suspended from the roof.

The pitch is in size and the total grass area at Emirates is . Like Highbury, it runs north–south, with the players&#x27; tunnel and the dugouts on the west side of the pitch underneath the main TV camera. The quality of Arsenal&#x27;s pitch and groundsmanship has been recognised internationally by bodies such as the Institute of Groundsmanship, and have led to the ground sometimes being referred to by players and fans as &quot;The Carpet.&quot;

The away fans are found in the south-east corner of the lower tier. The away supporter configuration can be expanded from 1,500 seats to 4,500 seats behind the south goal in the lower tier, and a further 4,500 seats can be made available also in the upper tier, bringing the total to 9,000 supporters (the regulation 15% required for domestic cup competitions such as the FA Cup and EFL Cup). In total, the current seated capacity is 60,704, with future facilities in place which may allow future expansion of seats pending approval from regulatory bodies such as the Islington Council.

The stadium additionally has facilities for fans with disabilities including a Guide Dog Toilet facility, a Disabled Supporters Match Day Lounge, Changing Places Toilet facilities which includes a hoist and changing table. In September 2017, Arsenal opened a sensory room at the stadium for the fans. There are 241 wheelchair accessible seats within the Emirates Stadium.

The Emirates Stadium pays tribute to Arsenal&#x27;s former home, Highbury. The club&#x27;s offices are officially called Highbury House, located north-east of Emirates Stadium, and house the bust of Herbert Chapman that used to reside at Highbury. Three other busts that used to reside at Highbury of Claude Ferrier (architect of Highbury&#x27;s East stand), Denis Hill-Wood (former Arsenal chairman) and manager Arsène Wenger have also been moved to Emirates Stadium and are in display in the entrance of the Diamond Club. Additionally, the clock that gave its name to the old Clock End has been resited on the new clock end which features a newer, larger replica of the clock. The Arsenal club museum, which was formerly held in the North Bank Stand, opened in October 2006 and is located to the north of the stadium, within the Northern Triangle building. It houses the marble statues that were once held in the marble halls of Highbury.

==Future==
As of 2008, Arsenal&#x27;s season ticket waiting list stood at 40,000 people. There has also been discussion on the implementation of safe standing.

In February 2022, the club announced major renovation plans to improve the Emirates Stadium. The first phase of renovations include installing new video boards, turnstile ticket readers, and refurbishing the stadium roof and wrap. Future renovation plans include completely overhauling the PA system and improving mobile connectivity within the stadium.

On 11 January 2023, Arsenal unveiled eight new pieces of artwork that would adorn the exterior of Emirates Stadium: &quot;Victoria Concordia Crescit&quot;, &quot;Remember Who You Are&quot;, &quot;Invincible&quot;, &quot;Come To See The Arsenal&quot;, &quot;Eighteen Eighty-Six&quot;, &quot;We All Follow The Arsenal&quot;, &quot;Future Brilliance&quot;, and &quot;Found a Place Where We Belong&quot;.

==Other uses==
Aside from sporting uses, the Emirates Stadium operates as a conference centre. On 27 March 2008, it played host to a summit between British Prime Minister Gordon Brown and French President Nicolas Sarkozy, in part because the stadium was regarded as &quot;a shining example of Anglo–French co-operation&quot;. The stadium has been used as a location for the audition stage of reality shows &quot;The X Factor&quot;, &quot;Britain&#x27;s Got Talent&quot; and &quot;Big Brother&quot;. In 2016, the Emirates was a venue for &quot;Celebrity Masterchef&quot;, where contestants prepare meals for club staff members.

Aside from sporting uses, the Emirates has been used as a music venue which increases the maximum capacity to 72,000. Bruce Springsteen and the E Street Band became the first band to play a concert at the stadium on 30 May 2008. They played a second gig the following night. British band Coldplay played three concerts at the Emirates in the June 2012, having sold out the first two dates within 30 minutes of going on sale. They were the first band to sell out the stadium for music purposes. Green Day set a gig attendance record when performing at the Emirates in June 2013. The Killers played 2 exclusive sold-out concerts at the Emirates for their Imploding the Mirage Tour on 3 &amp; 4 June 2022.

===International football matches===
The stadium has also been used for a number of international friendly matches all of which have featured the Brazil national football team. The first match was against Argentina on 3 September 2006 which ended in a 3–0 victory for Brazil.




=== Rugby League ===
The Emirates was the only London venue for the 2021 Men&#x27;s Rugby League World Cup. On 12 November 2022, the stadium hosted the second semi final between England &amp; Samoa.
==Records==
It is difficult to get accurate attendance figures as Arsenal do not release these, but choose to use tickets sold. The average attendance for competitive first-team fixtures in the stadium&#x27;s first season, 2006–07, was 59,837, with a Premier League average attendance of 60,045. By the 2016–17 season, the reported average home league attendance was 59,957. The attendances that Arsenal reported to the Metropolitan Police for the 2015–16 season show an average home match attendance of 54,918, ranging from a high of 60,007 against Aston Villa to a low of 44,878 against West Bromwich Albion. The highest attendance for an Arsenal match at the Emirates Stadium as of December 2022 is 60,383, for a Premier League match against Wolverhampton Wanderers on 2 November 2019. The lowest attendance at the ground is believed to be 25,909 for a match against FC BATE Borisov in the UEFA Europa League on 7 December 2017, however the official attendance for the game is recorded as 54,648.

The first player to score at the Emirates in a competitive fixture was Aston Villa defender Olof Mellberg after 53 minutes. In the same match Gilberto Silva scored Arsenal&#x27;s first competitive goal at the ground. Jay Simpson was the first Arsenal player to score a hat trick at the Emirates Stadium against Cardiff City in February 2007, while Emmanuel Adebayor recorded Arsenal&#x27;s 100th goal at the ground in January 2008 against Newcastle United. Arsenal&#x27;s biggest margin of victory at the Emirates Stadium was by seven goals, achieved with a 7–0 win over Slavia Prague in the group stages of the UEFA Champions League on 23 October 2007. Their biggest margin of defeat at the ground was by four goals, when they were beaten 5–1 by Bayern Munich in the Champions League round of 16, second leg on 7 March 2017. Robin van Persie has scored the most goals at the Emirates Stadium with 64.

==Transport and access==

The Emirates Stadium is served by a number of London Underground stations and bus routes. Arsenal station is the closest for the northern portion of the stadium accessed via the Ken Friar bridge, with Highbury &amp; Islington station servicing the southern end. While Holloway Road station is the closest to the southern portion, it is entry-only before matches and exit-only afterwards to prevent overcrowding. Drayton Park station, adjacent to the Danny fiszman Bridge is shut on matchdays as the rail services to this station do not operate at weekends nor after 10 pm. £7.6 million was set aside in the planning permission for upgrading Drayton Park and Holloway Road; however Transport for London decided not to upgrade either station, in favour of improvement works at the interchanges at Highbury &amp; Islington and Finsbury Park stations, both of which are served by Underground and National Rail services and are approximately a ten-minute walk away. The Emirates Stadium is the only football stadium that stands beside the East Coast Main Line between London and Edinburgh and is just over 2 miles from London King&#x27;s Cross.

Driving to the Emirates Stadium is strongly discouraged as there are strict matchday parking restrictions in operation around the stadium. An hour before kick-off to one hour after the final whistle there is a complete ban on vehicle movement on a number of the surrounding roads, except for Islington residents and businesses with a road closure access permit. The parking restrictions mean that the stadium is highly dependent on the Underground service, particularly when there is no overground service in operation.

The stadium opens to ticket holders two hours before kick-off. The main club shop, named &#x27;The Armoury&#x27;, and ticket offices are located near the West Stand, with other an additional store at the base of the North Bank Bridge, named &#x27;All Arsenal&#x27; and the &#x27;Arsenal Store&#x27; next to Finsbury Park station. Arsenal operates an electronic ticketing system where members of &#x27;The Arsenal&#x27; (the club&#x27;s fan membership scheme) use their membership cards to enter the stadium, thus removing the need for turnstile operators. Non-members are issued with one-off paper tickets embedded with an RFID tag allowing them to enter the stadium.

<doc id="725842" wikidata="Q3087523" url="?curid=725842" title="Valencian Union">
<text>Valencian Union (; ; UV) was a regionalist political party in the Valencian Community, Spain.

The party had not been represented in the Valencian autonomous parliament since 1999. It scored 0.95% of the total votes in the 2007 elections, well below the 5% threshold for representation. The party had councillors on several local councils, obtaining its best results in the Valencia province.

The party was closely associated with the blaverist part of Valencianist movement by claiming that the Valencian language is different from the Catalan language and opposing the concept of &quot;Països Catalans&quot; and Catalan nationalism in the Valencian Community. The party also held right-wing stances on issues such as economics. It formed an electoral alliance with the larger right wing Partido Popular (PP) in the General elections of 1982 and 2004, and the Elections for the Autonomous Parliament in 1983.

==History==
===Early years and prime (1982–1991)===
It was formed on 30 August 1982 with the stated purpose of &quot;defending Valencian identity&quot; and ran for the first time in the Spanish general election, 1982. It participated as part of the larger Spain-wide right-wing block Alianza Popular and won a seat held by Miguel Ramón Izquierdo. This coalition was kept for the 1983 elections to the Valencian autonomous Parliament.

UV took part by itself in the 1986 general election. Miguel Ramón Izquierdo retained his seat in the &quot;Cortes Generales&quot;. In 1987, it entered the &quot;Corts Valencianes&quot; (Valencian regional parliament), winning six of the 89 seats in the parliament. It then doubled its presence at the &quot;Cortes Generales&quot; when two of its candidates won in the 1989 general election. One of the seats was won by its founder, Vicente González Lizondo.

UV reached its height in the Valencian regional elections of 1991, when it became the third largest party in the Valencian Community, overtaking the traditional third party in the territory (Esquerra Unida del País Valencià). This election elevated UV to its all-time record, 10.5% of the total votes, with this figure remarkably higher in its electoral stronghold, the Valencian speaking areas in the Valencia province.

===Death of González Lizondo and decline (1995–2008)===

The turning point of UV&#x27;s history took place in the regional elections of 1995. At those elections, UV achieved 7.1% of the total votes and fell back to fourth place among the parties with representation in the Corts Valencianes. But, despite having had remarkably worse results than those of their high point in 1991, UV gained an unprecedented influence at the center of the Valencian political scene, because the results of this election deprived the Spanish Socialist Workers&#x27; Party (PSOE) of an absolute majority. The new situation allowed both opposition parties, the Partido Popular (PP), which was short of a majority, and UV to agree on a coalition government to oust the PSOE from regional rule after the latter had served 12 consecutive years in office.

From 1995 through to the next regional elections in 1999, a rising PP manoeuvered to ideologically absorb its smaller government partner UV. At the same time, the party received a fatal blow when leader Vicente González Lizondo died in 1997 after suffering a heart attack while on duty at the &quot;Corts&quot;. With UV being primarily based on a reactive idea such as blaverism rather than on a consistent ideological set of policies, the loss of its founder and leader was a setback from which it has not recovered.

Also during these years, a number of medium and prominent UV ranks defected from the party and joined the PP.

Then, in 1999 – at the first elections after UV&#x27;s support had been crucial in forming a government – the party suffered a serious blow when its vote share of 4.76% (down from 7.1%) was just short of the 5% threshold necessary to win seats at the &quot;Corts&quot;. In those elections, the PP, which had received the lion&#x27;s share of former UV votes, achieved an absolute majority in the &quot;Corts&quot;, thus completing its electoral strategy for hegemony in the Valencian Community.

UV&#x27;s vote share further declined in the 2003 and 2007 regional elections. For the 2004 general election, the party revived its electoral pact with the Partido Popular and obtained a seat in the Spanish Senate held by José María Chiquillo.

Simultaneously, UV was plagued by a number of schisms of small groups of members who left to form their own parties such as &quot;Opció Nacionalista Valenciana&quot;, &quot;Unió de Progrés per la Comunitat Valenciana&quot;, &quot;Iniciativa de Progrés per la Comunitat Valenciana&quot;, &quot;Identidad del Reino de Valencia&quot;, &quot;Renovació Valencianista&quot; or &quot;Partido Regional de la Comunidad Valenciana&quot;. Some of these, given their very small numbers, have either been readmitted in UV or, alternatively, have joined the PP. The rest went on to form Coalició Valenciana, a party assuming the staunch rightwing image which UV has tried to depart from during the 2000s. Coalició Valenciana reached 0.72% of the total votes at the 2007 regional elections, well below the 5% threshold to enter the regional parliament, but a narrow gap when compared to UV&#x27;s own 0.95%.

Following acrimonious internal elections, Chiquillo quit the party and went on to join the PP, thus generating a severe internal crisis which weakened the party still further. Joaquín Ballester Sanz, a councillor for the town of Paterna succeeded Chiquillo as the Party leader. At the end of April 2006, Ballester Sanz resigned and in the leadership election in May the mayor of Náquera, José Manuel Miralles became the new leader.

At the 2007 elections to the Corts Valencianes, UV achieved 0.95% of the total votes. The party announced that it would not run –neither by itself, nor repeating an electoral pact with the PP– for the 2008 general election. This decision was dubbed by its proponents as &quot;hard, but necessary for UVs survival as a political party&quot;; the party also said at that time that it was conducting an internal restructuring with the aim of being in better shape for the 2011 regional election.

===2011 and possible merger with PP===
In 2011, the party announced that it would not contest either the regional or local elections due to a lack of funds and activists. This was the first time since its foundation that UV had not taken part in local or regional elections. On 10 April 2011, party leader Miralles and Valencian President Francisco Camps appeared together and announced the merger of the projects of UV and the PP, with Miralles urging UV supporters to vote for the PP in the May elections. In response, UV&#x27;s Secretary General, Luís Melero announced that he would attempt to expel Miralles from the party to prevent it from being absorbed by the PP. Other members and supporters of UV decided to stand in the lists of other parties, mainly Units per València, which absorbed the UV branches of Carcaixent, Torrent and others, while Melero himself stood as part of the Units list in Silla.

The party made a late attempt to contest the 2011 Spanish General Election but failed to secure the 0.1% of signatures necessary to appear on the ballot paper.

<doc id="725851" wikidata="Q503218" url="?curid=725851" title="International Football Association Board">
<text>The International Football Association Board (IFAB) is an international self-regulatory body of association football that is known for determining the Laws of the Game, the regulations for the gameplay of football. It was founded in 1886 in order to establish standardised regulations or &quot;Laws&quot; for the gameplay of international competition, and has since acted as the primary maintainer (&quot;Guardian&quot;) of these Laws. FIFA, a prominent governing body for football, has recognised IFAB&#x27;s jurisdiction over its Laws since its establishment in 1904.

IFAB is a distinct body from FIFA, although FIFA is represented on the board and holds 50% of the voting power. The founding football associations of IFAB, England, Scotland, Northern Ireland and Wales each have permanent seats on the organisation. Amendments to the Laws mandate a three-quarter supermajority vote, meaning that FIFA&#x27;s support is necessary but not sufficient for a motion to pass.

==History==
===Establishment===

Although the rules of football had largely been standardised by the early 1880s, England&#x27;s Football Association (The FA), the Scottish Football Association (SFA), the Football Association of Wales (FAW) and the Irish Football Association (IFA) had conflicting rules. When international matches were played, the rules of the home team&#x27;s national association were used. While this solution was technically feasible, it was impractical. To remedy this, the FAs initialised a meeting on 6 December 1882 in Queen’s Hotel, Manchester in order to systematise a set of rules that could be applied uniformly to matches between the UK football associations&#x27; national teams. This was later named the “International Football Conference”.

In the summer of 1885, the English FA declared that it legalised professionalism. The Scottish FA responded that it would refuse to allow professionals in its own national team, and would refuse to play international matches against an England team containing professionals. The Irish FA attempted to arbitrate by proposing that &quot;an international conference should be held each year, say, in August, to be called in turn by each national association to deal with the laws of the game, and discuss other matters of interest to Association football, and at which international disputes could be adjusted&quot;.

===Inaugural meeting and FIFA’s integration===

The initial meeting of IFAB took place at The FA&#x27;s offices at Holborn Viaduct in London on 2 June 1886. The FA, SFA, FAW and IFA each had equal voting rights. It was chaired by Sir Francis Marindin, and attended by Charles W. Alcock acting as Secretary. The meeting was notable for Marindin’s proposal, which outlined &quot;That no player shall wear any kind of projection on the soles of heels of his boots with the exception of flat leather bars of an approved pattern&quot;.

During IFAB’s annual general meeting (AGM) on 8 June 1912, the secretary, J.K. McDowall, scrutinised a letter that was attributed to the recently established FIFA, requesting that IFAB would invite a member of FIFA to sit on the Board. The petition was analysed, and IFAB concluded that it wasn’t the right time to establish FIFA as a member, and McDowall proceeded to write a response to the organisation explaining the consensus. At a special meeting held on 25 January 1913 in Wrexham, IFAB approved FIFA’s request after a proposition by The FA was made proposing that two members from FIFA should attend the board, making FIFA the fifth member of IFAB.

===Post-war===

For the first four post-war IFAB meetings (1920, 1921, 1922, and 1923), FIFA was once again excluded, on account of a dispute between FIFA and the home nations regarding payments to amateur players. From 1924, the dispute had been reconciled, and FIFA resumed attendance of IFAB meetings. In 1958, the Board agreed on a voting system that would be used to this day.

Since Irish partition in 1921, the IFA has evolved to become the organising body for football in Northern Ireland, with football in the Republic of Ireland being organised by the FAI. A request for the FAI to become a member of IFAB was denied at the 1923 annual general meeting.

==Operations==
===Membership===
The IFAB is made up of representatives from England&#x27;s Football Association (The FA), the Scottish Football Association (SFA), the Football Association of Wales (FAW) and Northern Ireland&#x27;s Irish Football Association (IFA)—and the &quot;Fédération Internationale de Football Association&quot; (FIFA, the International Federation of Association Football), the international governing body for football. Each British association has one vote and FIFA has four. IFAB deliberations must be approved by three-quarters of the vote, or at least six of the eight votes. Thus, FIFA&#x27;s approval is necessary for any IFAB decision, but FIFA alone cannot change the Laws of the Game—they need to be agreed by at least two of the UK members. As of 2016, all members must be present for a binding vote to proceed.

===Meetings of the board===
The Board meets twice a year, once to decide on possible changes to the rules governing the game of Football (the Annual General Meeting (AGM)) and once to deliberate on its internal affairs (the Annual Business Meeting (ABM)). In FIFA World Cup years, the AGM is held at FIFA&#x27;s offices; otherwise, it rotates between Northern Ireland, Wales, England and Scotland in that order. Four weeks before the AGM, the member associations must send their written proposals to the secretary of the host association. FIFA then prints a list of suggestions that are distributed to all other associations for examination. The AGM is held either in February or March and the ABM is held between September and October. In cases of necessity, the Board can meet in a Special Meeting in addition to the two ordinary annual meetings. As of December 2012, the last Special Meeting was hosted by FIFA in Zürich on 5 July 2012.

The decisions of each year&#x27;s Annual General Meeting of the Board regarding changes to the Laws of the Game enter into force from 1 July (and are binding on FIFA and on the other members of the Board, and, given that FIFA&#x27;s Statutes establish that FIFA and its member associations and affiliates adhere to the Laws of the Game laid down by IFAB, those changes bind also FIFA&#x27;s other member associations, FIFA&#x27;s continental confederations of member associations, and the subnational entities of the national associations) but confederations, member associations and other bodies whose current season has not ended by 1 July may delay the introduction of the adopted alterations to the Laws of the Game in their competitions until the beginning of their next season. As well as permanent changes to the Laws, IFAB also authorises trials of potential amendments.

<doc id="725860" wikidata="Q2452573" url="?curid=725860" title="Cypher (Marvel Comics)">
<text>Cypher (Douglas &quot;Doug&quot; Aaron Ramsey) is a superhero appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. The character appears usually in the X-Men family of books, in particular those featuring the New Mutants, of which Cypher has been a member. He is a mutant with the ability to easily understand any language, whether spoken or written.

The character is not related to the female cyborg of the same name who first appeared in &quot;Sabretooth and Mystique&quot; #1 and is a member of A.I.M.

==Publication history==
Created by writer Chris Claremont and artist Sal Buscema, the character first appeared in &quot;The New Mutants&quot; #13 (March 1984). Initially used as a supporting cast member, he was assimilated into the titular superteam in &quot;The New Mutants&quot; #21 (1984). During his run as a member of the team, Cypher was the least popular of the New Mutants, as series writer Louise Simonson recounted: &quot;He wasn&#x27;t fun to draw. He just stood around and hid behind a tree during a fight... Every artist who ever did him said &#x27;Can&#x27;t we kill this guy?&#x27; We would get letters from fans about how much they hated him. We never got any letters from people saying they liked him until he was dead.&quot;

Cypher was killed in &quot;The New Mutants&quot; #60 (1988). The story was acclaimed as one of the most touching moments in the series, and sparked a surge in popularity for the character. Following his death, Cypher was frequently referenced, and even had a solo story in &quot;The New Mutants&quot; Annual #6 (1990), appearing as a ghost. His tombstone appears as one of Magneto&#x27;s most traumatic memories when psychically assaulted by Professor X and Jean Grey. After the events of the Phalanx Covenant, a techno-organic being known as &quot;Douglock&quot; takes Cypher&#x27;s form in &quot;Excalibur&quot; #78 (1994), but this being turns out to be Warlock infused with some of Cypher&#x27;s memories.

The character was brought back to life during the 2009-2010 &quot;Necrosha&quot; storyline and appeared regularly between &quot;The New Mutants&quot; vol. 3 #5 (2009) through &quot;The New Mutants&quot; vol. 3 #50 (2012) and again in &quot;All-New X-Factor&quot; (2014-2015).

==Fictional character biography==
Doug Ramsey was born to Philip and Sheila Ramsey. Doug became friends with Kitty Pryde, whom he met after she moved to Westchester County to join Charles Xavier&#x27;s School for Gifted Youngsters, and with whom he shares an interest in video games, computers and computer technology. Kitty&#x27;s talent for building hardware complements Doug&#x27;s skill at writing software.

Professor X suspected Doug possessed a mutant power, probably connected with communications, but did not approach him to join the school, perhaps feeling a passive power might go unnoticed. Subsequently, Doug was offered a scholarship to attend Emma Frost&#x27;s Massachusetts Academy. He did not know at the time that Emma Frost was one of the X-Men&#x27;s adversaries. When Kitty Pryde accompanied him on his first trip to the Massachusetts Academy, she was captured, and later rescued by the New Mutants. Though Doug&#x27;s memory of the mutant related events was wiped by Frost, he does not accept the scholarship for reasons not elaborated on.
Doug became a member of the New Mutants after the arrival of the techno-organic alien Warlock, whose inability to communicate with the children requires them to seek out Doug to use his linguistic abilities. In so doing, it is revealed to Doug that both he and they are mutants, and superheroes. With Doug&#x27;s predisposition for technology, and being more readily able to understand Warlock than most others, the two of them became fast friends. Whereas Warlock referred to his teammates with the prefix &quot;selfriend&quot;, eventually, after Doug saves his life by offering to share some of his own life energy with Warlock, Warlock gives Doug the unique identifier of &quot;Selfsoulfriend&quot;.

Doug&#x27;s mutant power is the ability to intuitively understand and translate any form of communication, be it written, spoken or non-verbal, and regardless of whether the origin of the language is human, computer or even completely alien. His power is not related to his intellect, but it often allows him to make leaps of comprehension that he cannot explain to anyone else, but which are invariably accurate. He was, for instance, able to translate the language of a long-dead species, without any common terms of reference, within a matter of hours. An established hacker, he becomes the team&#x27;s computer expert and researcher, writing programs for the X-Men&#x27;s Danger Room.

Doug was the only one of the original New Mutants who never told his parents he was a mutant, as he fears rejection.

Despite being instrumental in many of his team&#x27;s successful missions, including those involving saving lives, Doug suffered from occasional feelings of inadequacy. These feelings were driven by his lack of action-oriented powers and the way Warlock often encapsulated him to provide defense in times of danger. This was illustrated during a journey to Asgard, where he was defeated in combat by a serving maid.

Later, Warlock explained to Doug that they can perform a &quot;self-merge&quot; in which they merge the substance of their bodies to create a being with Doug&#x27;s form but Warlock&#x27;s techno-organic surface texture. This allowed them full access to both their powers, but ran a severe risk of irreversibly infecting Doug with the Transmode virus and turning him into a techno-organic being like Warlock.

Cypher used his abilities to discover a means of saving Lila Cheney&#x27;s Dyson Sphere homebase from destruction.

===Romances and death===
When introduced, Doug was already close friends with Kitty Pryde. Kitty was having issues both with the divorce of her parents and with her uncertain relationship with Piotr Rasputin, and Doug was there for her. He was interested in pursuing a romantic relationship with her as evidenced by the illusion Emma Frost created to distract him, but Kitty was uncertain and eventually they decided to remain friends.

Cypher helped rescue Betsy Braddock from Mojo. This involved venturing deep into Braddock&#x27;s mind and rescuing her psyche from being torn apart by Mojo&#x27;s servant, Spiral. The shared experience created a deep emotional bond between the two, though their different ages created awkward feelings between them. Later, Doug entered a relationship with teammate Rahne Sinclair, Wolfsbane, which was cut short by his death not long thereafter.

Alongside the other New Mutants, Doug temporarily joined the Hellions. When the Magus attacked, Doug reprogrammed the Magus into an infant state.

After the team rescued a humanoid bird creature named Bird-Brain, Doug was initially jealous of Rahne&#x27;s affection for him, but after Doug managed to understand and translate the creature&#x27;s language, he and Rahne bonded with Bird-Brain. When Bird-Brain set out to free the other mutants enslaved by the Ani-Mator, a geneticist working for Cameron Hodge, the New Mutants followed him. Though the Ani-Mator was defeated, he fatally shot Doug, who took a bullet intended for Rahne.

Magneto, leader of the New Mutants at the time, explained Doug&#x27;s death to his parents as a &#x27;hunting accident&#x27;. A grief-stricken Warlock tried to steal Doug&#x27;s body in a confused attempt to reanimate it, but his teammates convinced him to return the body. Doug&#x27;s ghost later appeared to Wolfsbane when she visited his grave in the cemetery. He later appeared in a fantasy staged by Captain Britain&#x27;s patron Merlyn to aid Excalibur in exposing and battling the vengeful spirit of the late X-Men member Changeling.

===Douglock===
Warlock was subsequently murdered by Cameron Hodge during the &quot;X-Tinction Agenda&quot; storyline, and his ashes were scattered on Doug&#x27;s grave at the request of Wolfsbane. Later the alien Phalanx, a corrupt subset of the more powerful alien race known as the Technarchy (Warlock&#x27;s native race), resurrected Warlock with Doug&#x27;s memories and appearance, intending to use him as a &quot;Trojan horse&quot; to infiltrate the X-Men. This gestalt entity, called Douglock, broke free of the Phalanx&#x27;s programming, and joins Excalibur for a time. Unaware of his real identity as Warlock, &quot;Douglock&quot; believed himself to be a new entity based on the &quot;genetic and mental engrams&quot; of Cypher and Warlock. This new entity had another relationship with Wolfsbane. He became a valued part of Excalibur, and a mentor to Meggan, who needed further basic schooling.

After Excalibur disbanded, Warlock&#x27;s personality resurfaced, but exhibited more human speech patterns and appearance. Warlock manifested Doug&#x27;s translation powers and maintained a copy of Doug&#x27;s memory, but his personality was not active.

===Necrosha and resurrection===
Cypher was resurrected via the Transmode Virus by Selene and Eli Bard. After Selene tasks him to kill Magma, he clubbed Magma. He was confronted by his teammates, during which he displayed a greatly enhanced ability to read body language and anticipate actions, but was dispatched by his teammates. Warlock attempted to restore Cypher&#x27;s true personality, but was incapacitated by a trojan programming code, after which Cypher decapitated him. Cypher was then kidnapped by the Hellions, who wished to reprogram him, but was rescued by his teammates, who severed his connection to Selene, restoring his original personality and free will.

The transmode virus which rebuilt his body was still present, but Cypher reprogrammed it to be in permanent remission.

===Second Coming===
In the 2010 &quot;Second Coming&quot; storyline, Doug analyzed a fight between the New Mutants and Cameron Hodge and concluded the New Mutants would be killed. He therefore convinced Warlock to kill and absorb Hodge and several of his men. Later, Doug joined X-Force on a time-travelling mission to stop an invasion of advanced Sentinels from the future. Cable and Cypher infiltrate a Master Mold installation and attempt to hack into the grid, but the Master Mold discovered Cypher and tried to assimilate him to add his linguistic skills to its own. However, in doing so, it allowed Cypher access to its programming. He subsequently overrode the Master Mold and deactivated all the Nimrods invading Utopia.

===Regenesis===
Following the schism of the X-Men, Cypher, with most of the New Mutants, decided to move to San Francisco. While maintaining a sense of independence from both Cyclops&#x27; and Wolverine&#x27;s sides of the X-Men, they still reported to Cyclops, cleaning up &quot;unfinished business.&quot; 

Cypher played a key role in defeating a future version of himself called Truefriend, which had taken over the world by splicing Warlock&#x27;s tech into people under the guise of helping them. With the help of Doctor Strange, Truefriend was prevented from coming into existence.

===All-New X-Factor===
Cypher appeared as a regular member of All-New X-Factor, along with Gambit, Polaris, Danger, Quicksilver, and Warlock. He nearly died after having contact with a girl whose power is to drain life from living organisms. He also had sex with Danger, supposedly in an attempt to help the sentient female robot understand human behavior.

===Hunt for Wolverine===
Cypher isolated himself to focus on decoding the entire Internet. However, his powers would not allow him to stop once he began, causing him to develop an addiction to Internet use. He became a hermit, living in a dilapidated shack in New Jersey. During the &quot;Hunt for Wolverine&quot; storyline, Cypher was approached by Daredevil, Misty Knight, and Nur for help in finding Wolverine after his corpse disappeared from his grave. Initially unresponsive and hostile when Nur cut off his Internet access, Cypher eventually calmed down and agreed to assist, though abstaining from Internet use affected him negatively. When the investigation took them to Saskatchewan, Cypher, while alone, was attacked by Wolverine&#x27;s cyborg clone Albert, who slashed his throat. Cypher barely survived this injury and was healed by the medical suite on Nur&#x27;s Inhuman ship. Following leads to a facility owned by a corporation named Soteria, Cypher was able to recover data that Soteria operatives had begun deleting. At the investigation&#x27;s conclusion, Cypher admitted his addiction and turned to Daredevil for help. His Internet addiction subsequently stabilized.

Cypher also worked alongside Daredevil to bring down Kingpin, who had taken over from Matt Murdock as Mayor of New York.

===Dawn of X===
As part of Moira MacTaggert&#x27;s plan to safeguard the future of mutants, Cypher traveled to Krakoa with Professor Xavier and contacted the sentient island with his powers. He also helped to terraform the island and establish it as a mutant homeland. Cypher sat on the Quiet Council and acted as the voice of Krakoa. In addition to his Quiet Council duties, Cypher participated in the New Mutants&#x27; space mission to visit Cannonball, missions to help Nightcrawler and Storm, and was one of Krakoa&#x27;s representatives in the X of Swords tournament. 

During the X of Swords tournament, Cypher was slated to face off with Bei the Blood Moon, a member of the opposing team from Arakko. However, rather than fight, Saturnyne forced the two to marry, earning each of their teams a point for completing the ceremony. Though they were largely strangers to each other, Cypher was fascinated by Bei due to his inability to understand her (a result of her psionic powers conflicting with his own). During the subsequent invasion of Krakoa, Cypher convinced his new wife to betray Arakko and help the Krakoans fight off the invading forces of Annihilation. 

Despite the circumstances of their marriage and their communication barrier, Cypher and Bei remained married after the tournament and lived together happily on Krakoa.

After the Quiet Council was revealed to potentially be under the influence of Mr. Sinister, the council voted to disband. Krakoa quickly swallowed Cypher into the ground and trapped him in its subterranean prison, the Pit. Hope Summers, using her powers to duplicate Cypher&#x27;s, attempted to convince the island to release him to no avail. Distraught by the disappearance of her beloved husband, Bei employed numerous scent trackers and telepaths to locate him, but none could detect his presence on Krakoa.

Cypher was eventually released during the X-Men&#x27;s counteroffensive against the terrorist group Orchis and helped deactivate Orchis&#x27; Sentinels. He later assisted in remerging the fractured Krakoa.

===Heir of Apocalypse===
After the fall of Krakoa, Apocalypse conceded that his methods had become outdated and began to search for an heir. He held a tournament in which twelve chosen participants, including Cypher, would compete to be his successor. Ultimately, Cypher won the tournament. Transformed by Celestial technology into Revelation, the new heir committed himself to evolving Apocalypse&#x27;s legacy and protecting mutantkind on Earth.

==Powers and abilities==
Cypher is a mutant who possesses a superhuman intuitive facility for translating languages, spoken or written, human or alien in origin. His superhuman skill is extended to his great facility in deciphering codes and computer languages, and he is also able to read inflection and body language which allows him to understand the vast subtext of a conversation. Rather than working the problem out step by step in his conscious mind, he instead subconsciously solves the problem. Hence, he can reach the correct solution by means that appear to be leaps of logic, and he himself may not be consciously aware of the entire process by which he reaches the right answer.

Since his resurrection by Selene&#x27;s use of a modified techno-organic virus, Cypher&#x27;s powers have evolved to the point where he can read all aspects of &quot;language.&quot; He is able to read his opponents&#x27; body language and the patterns of their combat moves to counter the attacks of several opponents attacking him at once. By considering the exercise of combat skills to be a form of language, he proved a match for the entire New Mutant team. He is able to &quot;read&quot; architectural structure and integrity to ascertain a building&#x27;s weaknesses. He also appears capable of &quot;speaking&quot; binary; giving verbal commands in machine code that can reprogram the machine.

Cypher is an expert in translating and designing computer software. He took university-level courses in languages and computer science. He can hack some of the most protected computers.

Cypher has been infected by techno-organic viruses on multiple occasions. The presence of the virus has allowed him at times to cheat death and to demonstrate techno-organic shapeshifting, transmode infection, and life-absorption abilities.

Cypher was taught by an imprisoned Magik how to cast a mystical teleportation spell which allows him to transport himself and others to either Hell or Hel.

Cypher is the only mutant who can communicate with the island Krakoa and interpret the island&#x27;s sentiments. 

Cypher&#x27;s powers render him unable to understand any being who communicates without language. For example, Bei the Blood Moon&#x27;s Doom Note is a sound and not a language, thus Cypher is incapable of understanding it, regardless of the Doom Note&#x27;s psionic translation of itself to be understood by all who hear it.

Cypher gained additional powers after being greatly enhanced by Celestial technology and transformed into Revelation.

==Reception==
* In 2014, &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; ranked Cypher/Doug Ramsay/Douglock/Warlock 48th in their &quot;Let&#x27;s rank every X-Man ever&quot; list.

==Other versions==

===Fear the Future/Fight the Future===
In the &quot;Fear the Future&quot; and &quot;Fight the Future&quot; storylines, a future version of Cypher called Truefriend took over the world by splicing Warlock&#x27;s tech into people. This version was prevented from coming into existence by Doctor Strange.

===Age of Apocalypse===
In the alternate world of the Age of Apocalypse crossover, Doug Ramsey is the adopted son of Destiny and lives in Avalon. His &quot;translation field&quot; allows everyone in Avalon to understand each other, no matter what language they speak (a much broader power than he had ever displayed in the main timeline at this time). He is killed when he jumps in front of Destiny to protect her from the Shadow King&#x27;s last desperate attack, a course of action that convinces his adoptive mother to become involved in defeating Apocalypse.

===Age of X===
In the &quot;Age of X&quot; reality, Douglas Ramsey was captured fairly easily and kept in a limited security prison on the Pacific Coast. Around this same time, Doug&#x27;s father agreed to undergo voluntary sterilization as an X-Gene carrier, but his mother committed suicide a year later. Despite being pegged as a low risk, Doug was able to escape by subverting one of the guards, Eileen Haloke. She was part-Navajo, and Ramsey forged some sort of emotional bond with her by speaking to her in the Navajo tongue. She freed him from his cell and then accompanied him when he escaped from the compound. She was sighted with him on numerous occasions thereafter.

Haloke was not with Ramsey in the Finger Lakes area of New York State a year later when he was at ground zero for a meteor strike. First forces arriving on the scene found Ramsey apparently infected by some sort of carbon/silicon alien matter. This alien matter was able to replicate in a quasi-viral manner, and it spread through Ramsey&#x27;s whole system in the space of minutes.

The units on site were waiting for the arrival of Hazmat teams so that they could apprehend Ramsey without risk of infection, but they suffered simultaneous failure of all electronic systems. Survivors of the incident reported seeing Ramsey &quot;speaking in tongues&quot;. Moments after Ramsey began speaking in an indecipherable, the Exonim units turned on each other, discharging all their weapons in a three-second exchange of fire which caused a forty-meter wide crater.

Ramsey survived the ordeal seemingly unharmed. He later joined Magneto&#x27;s forces in Fortress X.

===Days of Future Present===
In the &quot;Days of Future Present&quot; annual crossover, which showed aspects of the alternate future known as &quot;Days of Future Past&quot;, a new incarnation of the New Mutants was seen, whose membership included Doug Ramsey. This revived version of Doug was human looking on his right side, but his left side was techno-organic and constantly shifted into battle configurations with weapons bristling all over. Aggressive and violent, he was described as being nigh insane when angered. He also only responded to the name &quot;Magus&quot;, seemingly confirming Warlock&#x27;s fears that if infected by the transmode virus after merging into Douglock one time too many, Doug might take on the warlike aspects of the Technarch species.

===Exiles===
The reality-hopping Exiles once visited a world where Doug Ramsey was infected by the Legacy Virus. Trying to save Ramsey&#x27;s life, Warlock bonded with him, combining their life forces into one. Once the virus was introduced to Warlock&#x27;s unique physiology, it mutated and became even more contagious. With over half the world infected by this new technological virus (called Vi-Locks), Doug Ramsey was kept in stasis. He was killed by one of the infected, once it found out the Exiles were trying to create a cure based on Ramsey&#x27;s original strain of the virus.

===Geshem===
In Peter David&#x27;s one-shot graphic novel &quot;Rahne of Terra&quot; there exists a sword and sorcery version of the New Mutants and X-Men, with the likes of Sam &quot;Cannonball&quot; Guthrie being a knight who uses seven league boots to fly (and a rifle called &quot;Cannonball&quot; as a weapon). Here, Rain (an alt-version of Rahne &quot;Wolfsbane&quot; Sinclair) is the Princess of the realm of Geshem, and Doug is a commoner, a nobody whose mother is a washerwoman. However, he loves Rahne from afar, and it is partly through his unexpected courage and a magic spell that the mainstream Rahne Sinclair, who has replaced Rain, survives. The thought of Doug being killed again is enough to trigger her use of the magic of Geshem and her mutant powers to protect him. The story ends with Rain now restored to her own world, and noticing Doug for the first time, clearly being attracted to him.

In the sequel one-shot graphic novel, &quot;Knight of Terra&quot;, Rahne pays a return visit to Geshem, and discovers that in that world, Doug and Rain are now married and expecting their first child. However, after an attack by a sorcerer who used animated suits of armor, Doug was injured and had been healed by replacing at least one of his arms with some of the magically animated armor, a reference to Douglock, the part-Phalanx being who was a member of Excalibur.

===House of M===
Ramsey appears alive and well and older in the Scarlet Witch&#x27;s reality warp known as the &quot;House of M&quot;. He was a staff member alongside Karma and Sean Garrison at the New Mutant Leadership Institute who were training young mutants. Both he and Karma discover Garrison and his daughter Wallflower&#x27;s secret affiliations with S.H.I.E.L.D. and Emperor Sunfire. Garrison corners them and subdues Doug and Karma with fear pheromones and plans to kill them until Tag stops him with his powers and unintentionally causes him to commit suicide.

===Marvel Zombies===
Cypher appears as a non-combatant zombie in &quot;Deadpool: Merc with a Mouth&quot; issue #9. He is lured by zombie Deadpool into a lab to be tested on for a cure of the Zombie virus.

===Shattershot===
During the Shattershot Annual crossover, an alternate future is shown, where Warlock renamed himself Cyberlock. He retained all his memories but had a very serious, emotionless personality. He was part of an X-Force team that helped Shatterstar back to his home dimension and then helped him become a sort of benevolent dictator, replacing Mojo V as Cable wished. To this end, a new X-Force team, consisting of Cannonball, Siryn, Warlock, Darkchild (Illyana Rasputin), Sunspot, and Powerpax (Francine Power) returned to Shatterstar&#x27;s dimension. Assisted by the spineless ones and the geneticist, Arize, they overthrow Shatterstar, who had begun doing what Mojos I through V had done, creating a world based on the entertainment of killing the opposite race. Shatterstar, who had been having doubts concerning his leadership, joined in the overthrowing of his own dimension, and, apparently, joined the bipeds and spineless ones in peace. X-Force apparently returned to Earth.

===Ultimate Marvel===
In the Ultimate Marvel imprint, Doug Ramsey is a super-intelligent, slightly geeky but amicable computer programmer who gains national prominence by winning 74 consecutive games on the TV game show &quot;Jeopardy!&quot; He is not a mutant, but is a student at Emma Frost&#x27;s Academy of Tomorrow, which does not distinguish between different varieties of &quot;gifted&quot;.

Douglas is instrumental in helping free Lorna Dane from prison. Traffic camera footage of Dane&#x27;s apparent magnetically induced murder of several people had been reviewed time and again to no avail. Doug decides to review the tapes from three days ago and gains the information to clear Lorna&#x27;s name. He also appears in a short story in the back of &quot;Ultimate X-Men&quot; #75.

He, along with the rest of the Academy of Tomorrow, is killed by Madrox during the &quot;Ultimatum&quot; storyline.

===What If?===
In an issue that asks &quot;What If the X-Men Had Stayed in Asgard,&quot; Cypher devoted himself to studying long-forgotten texts and lore, written in languages forgotten to the Asgardians, gaining respect as a scholar amongst the population for doing so. He later became Storm&#x27;s vizier after she is crowned Queen of Asgard, helping bring a new renaissance to Asgard by using the forgotten wisdom of Asgard&#x27;s past that he had translated to shape its future.

<doc id="725861" wikidata="Q273228" url="?curid=725861" title="Amintore Fanfani">
<text>Amintore Fanfani (; 6 February 1908 – 20 November 1999) was an Italian politician and statesman, who served as 32nd prime minister of Italy for five separate terms. He was one of the best-known Italian politicians after the Second World War and a historical figure of the left-wing faction of Christian Democracy. He is also considered one of the founders of the modern Italian centre-left.

Beginning as a protégé of Alcide De Gasperi, Fanfani achieved cabinet rank at a young age and occupied all the major offices of state over the course of a forty-year political career. In foreign policy, he was one of the most vocal supporters of European integration and established closer relations with the Arab world. In domestic policy, he was known for his cooperation with the Italian Socialist Party, which brought to an alliance that radically changed the country, by such measures as the nationalization of Enel, the extension of compulsory education, and the introduction of a more progressive tax system.

Fanfani served in numerous ministerial positions, including Minister of the Interior, Minister of Foreign Affairs, Minister of Labour, Minister of Agriculture and Minister of Budget and Economic Planning. He served also as President of the Italian Senate for three terms between 1968 and 1987. He was appointed senator for life in 1972. Six years later, after the resignation of Giovanni Leone, he provisionally assumed the functions of President of the Republic as chairman of the upper house of the Italian Parliament, until the election of Sandro Pertini. Despite his long political experience and personal prestige, Fanfani never succeeded in being elected head of state.

Fanfani and the long-time liberal leader Giovanni Giolitti still hold the record as the only statesmen to have served as prime minister of Italy in five non-consecutive periods of office. He was sometimes nicknamed &quot;Cavallo di Razza&quot; (&quot;Purebred Horse&quot;), thanks to his innate political ability; however, his detractors simply called him &quot;Pony&quot; due to his small size.

==Early life==
Fanfani was born in Pieve Santo Stefano, in the province of Arezzo, Tuscany, in a middle-class family. His father, Giuseppe Fanfani (1878–1943), was a carpenter&#x27;s son who succeeded in studying and graduating in law, starting the profession of lawyer and notary; while his mother Annita Leo (1884–1968) was a housewife. Fanfani, who was the first of nine children, grew up in an observant Catholic family. Fanfani was named after Amintore Galli, who composed the socialist anthem the &quot;Workers&#x27; Hymn&quot;; Fanfani&#x27;s siblings were similarly named with eclectic or unusual names.

In 1920, at only 12 years old, Fanfani joined Catholic Action (AC), of which he became a local leader after a few years. After attending the scientific lyceum of Arezzo, he graduated in political and economic sciences in 1930 at the Catholic University in Milan, with the thesis &quot;Economic Repercussions and Effects of the English Schism&quot;. He was the author of a number of important works on economic history dealing with religion and the development of capitalism in the Renaissance and Reformation in Europe. His thesis was published in Italian and then in English as &quot;Catholicism, Capitalism and Protestantism&quot; in 1935.

Under the regime of Benito Mussolini, he joined the National Fascist Party (PNF) supporting the corporatist ideas of the regime promoting collaboration between the classes, which he defended in many articles. &quot;Some day&quot;, he once wrote, &quot;the European continent will be organized into a vast supranational area guided by Italy and Germany. Those areas will take authoritarian governments and synchronize their constitutions with Fascist principles.&quot;

He also wrote for the official magazine of racism in Fascist Italy, &quot;The Defence of the Race&quot; (Italian: &quot;La difesa della razza&quot;). In 1938, he was among the 330 that signed the antisemitic Manifesto of Race (Italian: &quot;Manifesto della razza&quot;) – culminating in laws that stripped the Italian Jews of any position in the government, university or professions which many previously had. Fanfani also became a professor at the School of Fascist Mysticism in Milan.

On 22 April 1939, Fanfani married Biancarosa Provasoli, a 25-year-old lady who grew up in a bourgeois family from Milan. The couple had two sons and five daughters, born between 1940 and 1955.

During the years he spent in Milan, he knew Giuseppe Dossetti and Giorgio La Pira. They formed a group known as the &quot;little professors&quot; who lived ascetically in monastery cells and walked barefoot. 
They formed the nucleus of Democratic Initiative, an intensely Catholic but economically reformist wing of the post-war Christian Democratic Party, holding meetings to discuss Catholicism and society.

In Milan, Fanfani wrote &quot;Catholicism and Protestantism in the historical development of Capitalism&quot;, in which he proposed a bold interpretation of the phenomena of capitalism, with particular reference to the conditioning of the religious factors and fundamentally disagree with the thesis of Max Weber. This work brought him to the forefront among US Catholics. After the surrender of Italy to the Allied armed forces on 8 September 1943, the group disbanded. Until the Liberation in April 1945, Fanfani fled to Switzerland dodging military service, and organized university courses for Italian refugees.

==Early political career==

Upon his return to Italy, he joined the newly founded Christian Democracy (DC), of which his friend Dossetti was serving as deputy secretary. He was as one of the youngest party leaders and a protégé of Alcide De Gasperi, the undisputed leader of the party for the following decade. Fanfani represented a particular ideological position, that of conservative Catholics who favoured socio-economic interventionism, which was very influential in the 1950s and 1960s but which gradually lost its appeal. &quot;Capitalism requires such a dread of loss,&quot; he once wrote, &quot;such a forgetfulness of human brotherhood, such a certainty that a man&#x27;s neighbour is merely a customer to be gained or a rival to be overthrown, and all these are inconceivable in the Catholic conception [...] There is an unbridgeable gulf between the Catholic and the capitalist conception of life.&quot; Private economic initiative, in his view, was justifiable only if harnessed to the common good.

In the 1946 election, he was elected to the Constituent Assembly for the constituency of Siena–Arezzo–Grosseto, which would remain his political stronghold for all his career. As a constituent, he was appointed in the Commission that drafted the text of the new Republican Constitution. The first article of the new constitution reflected Fanfani&#x27;s philosophy. He proposed an article, which read: &quot;Italy is a democratic republic founded on labor.&quot; After two years, in the 1948 general election, he was elected to the Italian Chamber of Deputies, with more than 35,000 votes.

Under De Gasperi, Fanfani took on a succession of ministries. From June 1947 until January 1950, he served as Minister of Labour; while from July 1951 to July 1953, he was Minister of Agriculture, and from July 1953 to January 1954 he served as Minister of the Interior in the caretaker government of Giuseppe Pella. As Minister of Labour, he developed the so-called &quot;Fanfani house&quot; program for government-built workers&#x27; homes and put 200,000 of Italy&#x27;s unemployed to work on a reforestation program. As Minister of Agriculture, he set in motion much of the Christian Democrats&#x27; land reform program. On 28 February 1949, Fanfani launched a seven-year plan for popular housing to increase the stock of economic housing by means of construction or purchase of economic accommodation. The law also established a special housing fund, the so-called &quot;INA-Casa&quot;, within the National Institute for Insurance (Istituto Nazionale delle Assicurazioni, or INA).

&quot;He can keep going for 36 hours on catnaps, apples and a few sips of water,&quot; according to a news report in &quot;Time&quot; magazine. Once, when someone proposed Fanfani for yet another ministry, De Gasperi refused. &quot;If I keep on appointing Fanfani to various ministries,&quot; he said, &quot;I am sure that one of these days I will open the door to my study and find Fanfani sitting at my desk.&quot;

==Leader of the party and prime minister==
===First government===
On 12 January 1954, after only 5 months in power, Prime Minister Giuseppe Pella was forced to resign, after a strong confrontation with many members of DC, regarding the appointment of Salvatore Aldisio as new Minister of Agriculture. Fanfani was then appointed by President Luigi Einaudi as new head of the government. Fanfani formed a one-party government composed only by members of the Christian Democracy. He chose, among others, Giulio Andreotti, another protégé of De Gasperi, as Minister of the Interior, Adone Zoli as Minister of Finance and Paolo Emilio Taviani as Minister of Defence.

However, the cabinet lasted only 23 days when it failed to win approval in the Parliament, being rejected by the Chamber of Deputies with 260 votes in favor, 303 votes against and 12 abstentions out of 563 present. On 10 February 1954, Mario Scelba sworn in as new prime minister. Fanfani&#x27;s first government was the shortest-lived cabinet in the history of the Italian Republic.
Since De Gasperi&#x27;s retirement in 1953 Fanfani emerged as the most probable successor, a role confirmed by his appointment as party secretary in June 1954, a position that he would held until March 1959.

===Secretary of the Christian Democracy===

As secretary, he reorganized and rejuvenated the national party organization of the Christian Democrats, decreasing its strong dependence on the Catholic Church and the national government which had typified the De Gasperi period. During his tenure, he built a close relation with Enrico Mattei, the CEO of Eni. They remained key allies until Mattei&#x27;s death in October 1962.

However, his activist and sometimes authoritarian style, as well as his reputation as an economic reformer, ensured that the moderate and the right-wingers within the DC, who opposed the state&#x27;s intrusion into the country&#x27;s economic life, regarded him with distrust. His indefatigable energy and his passion for efficiency carried him far in politics, but he was rarely able to exploit fully the opportunities that he created. As an anonymous Christian Democrat bigwig once remarked: &quot;Fanfani has colleagues, associates, acquaintances and subordinates, but I have never heard much about his friends.&quot;

In May 1955, Einaudi&#x27;s term as president of the Italian Republic came to an end, and Parliament had to choose his successor. Fanfani was promoting for the office the liberal Cesare Merzagora, who was then President of the Senate. However the right-wing of the party, led by Giuseppe Pella and Giulio Andreotti, organized an internal coup to get the Christian Democrat Giovanni Gronchi elected instead. The move received the surprising support of the Italian Communist Party (PCI) and Italian Socialist Party (PSI), and also of the Monarchist National Party (PNM) and the neo-fascist Italian Social Movement (MSI). After a bitter battle and the final crumbling of the centrist front, on 29 April 1955 Gronchi was elected President of the Republic with 658 votes out of 883.

During his secretariat, he built good relations both with United States President Dwight D. Eisenhower and Secretary of State John Foster Dulles, culminated to a state visit to Washington D.C. in August 1956. The brutal suppression of 1956 Hungarian Revolution, saw him coordinating a strong anti-communist propaganda in the country.

===General election in 1958 and second government===
In the 1958 general election, Fanfani ran as secretary of the Christian Democrats and main candidate to become the next prime minister. The electoral result was similar to the one of five years before. The Christian Democrats gained 42.4% of votes, nearly doubling Palmiro Togliatti&#x27;s Communist Party, which came second. However, the poor results of the other small centrist and secular parties meant the continuation of the same problems of political instability within the centrist coalition that had characterised the previous legislature.

The Christian Democracy resulted even more polarized between Fanfani&#x27;s leftist faction and the opposite one which urged for a rightist policy; Fanfani relaunched his reformist agenda, advocating for a dialogue with the Italian Socialist Party (PSI), which had stopped its ties with the communists after the Hungarian Revolution. However, a government between DC and PSI was probably too premature due to the strong opposition of DC&#x27;s right-wing, so, on 2 July 1958, Fanfani was sworn in as new prime minister at the head of a coalition government with the Italian Democratic Socialist Party (PSDI), and a case-by-case support of the Italian Republican Party (PRI).

He then decided not to resign immediately as secretary of the DC, wanting to bring the party behind him, at least until a new congress. He started an active foreign policy, along the lines of the so-called &quot;neo-atlantism&quot;, implementing a more autonomous foreign policy from the United States, presenting Italy as the main regional power of the Mediterranean Basin, trying to avoid the increase of Soviet Union&#x27;s sphere of influence over the Arab countries. However, he failed to leave a mark in domestic politics, despite his ambitious proposal of a 10-year plan for the development of public school, which was approved by the Parliament but not implemented. His economic policy was characterized by an increasing public spending.

The unprecedented concentration of power that he had achieved was also the main reason of his second government&#x27;s decline. The outraged conservative opposition resulted in a progressive breakdown of the internal majority faction, &quot;Democratic Initiative&quot;. In January 1959, a conspicuous group of Christian Democrats started voting against their own government, forcing Fanfani to resign on 26 January 1959, after only six months in power. On 16 February 1959, Antonio Segni sworn in as new prime minister. In March 1959, Fanfani resigned as party&#x27;s secretary too, and Aldo Moro became the new leader. After few weeks, he founded a new faction, known as &quot;Nuove Cronache&quot; (&quot;New Chronicles&quot;).

In party&#x27;s congress in October 1959, Moro was slightly confirmed secretary, after a thought battle with Fanfani, who was defeated thanks to the decisive vote of the right-wing faction of Mario Scelba and Giulio Andreotti.

When the Italian Liberal Party (PLI) withdrew its support to Segni&#x27;s government, Fanfani cooperated with Moro, attempting to establish a new centre-left government, with a case-by-case socialist support. However, this pact was strongly opposed by ecclesiastical hierarchies as well as the usual opposition of the DC&#x27;s right-wing. After Fanfani&#x27;s failure, Fernando Tambroni was appointed new prime minister. Tambroni, a right-wing conservative, received a decisive vote of confidence by the neo-fascist Italian Social Movement (MSI). The MSI had been banned by any type of political power since its birth under the theory of the &quot;Constitutional Arch&quot;, which stated that any government or party which had voted the Italian Constitution, had to refuse any relationship with fascist and monarchist forces, seen as anti-constitutional groups. Strikes and revolts causing some casualties erupted through the country, and Tambroni had to resign within few months. On 26 July 1960, Fanfani returned to the premiership, this time with an openly centre-left program supported by the PSI abstention.

===Third and fourth government===
His third government was formed only by DC ministers, and included also members of the party&#x27;s right-wing, like Giulio Andreotti, Giuseppe Pella, Mario Scelba and Guido Gonella, who served respectively as ministers of Defence, Budget Interior and Justice. The cabinet was externally supported by PSDI, PRI and PLI. With Fanfani as prime minister and Moro as secretary of the party, the so-called Organic Centre-left period officially began.
In February 1962, after the national congress of the Christian Democracy, Fanfani reorganised his cabinet and gained the benign abstention of the socialist leader Pietro Nenni.

During this term as prime minister, Fanfani carried out a number of reforms in areas such as health, education, and social security. On 8 April 1962 the cabinet introduced broad provisions covering building areas. Local governments were obliged to provide plans of areas suitable for economic housing, while strict price controls for building areas were introduced to prevent speculation.

On 31 December 1962, the Parliament approved a law that extended compulsory education to the age of 14 and introduced a single unified curriculum, lasting for a 3-year period after primary education. On 12 August 1962, Fanfani introduced a supplementary pension payment, equal to one-twelfth of the annual amount of pension minima, while also introducing child supplements for pensioners. Moreover, on 5 March 1963, he introduced a voluntary pension insurance scheme for housewives.

On 19 January 1963, the government proposed a bill that extended the insurance against occupational diseases to artisans, while general improvements to cash benefits were carried out: all pensions were to be adjusted every third year to the minimum contractual wage in the respective industrial sector, while earnings-replacement rates were raised to correspond to contractual disability rates. In February 1963, improved health benefits for agricultural workers, with the introduction of free pharmaceutical assistance and the flat-rate sickness indemnity replaced by an earnings-related indemnity equal to 50% of minimum contractual pay (in each province) for a maximum of 180 days.

In his three years rule, thanks to the key support of the PSI, Fanfani approved the nationalization of Enel, the national electric company and the establishment of middle school, the introduction of share taxation. Only the implementation of the ordinary statute regions and the urban reform remained uncompleted, due to a strong internal opposition within the DC. Moreover, the new international balance of power marked by the presidency of John F. Kennedy, influenced Western politics in favor of reformism, as the best alternative to defeat communism. During his premiership, Fanfani built up a good relation with President Kennedy. The two leaders met the first time during 1956 Democratic National Convention in Chicago, and in 1963, Fanfani was invited at the White House. Some analysts reported that Kennedy considered Fanfani an example of Catholic reformism. During the Cuban Missile Crisis, according to Ettore Bernabei, it was Fanfani who proposed the withdrawal of medium-range US missiles from Apulia, which than resulted in a peaceful ending of the crisis.

===General election in 1963 and resignation===
Despite a good approval in public opinion, his reformist policy produced a significant mistrust of the Italian industrial class and the right-wing of the Christian Democracy; multinational potentates opposed the opening to the Arab countries led by Fanfani&#x27;s ally Enrico Mattei, founder of Eni.

In the 1963 general election, the Christian Democrats lost almost one million votes, gaining nearly 38%, while the PCI arrived second with 25%. However the liberals surged to 7%, their best results ever, receiving many votes from former Christian Democratic supporters, who were against Fanfani&#x27;s centre-left policies. With the decline of electoral support, on 22 June 1963, the majority of DC members decided to replace Fanfani with a provisional government led by impartial President of the Chamber of Deputies, Giovanni Leone; however in autumn, when the congress of the Socialist Party authorized a full engagement of the party into the government, Leone resigned and Aldo Moro, secretary of the DC and leader of the more leftist wing of the party, became the new prime minister and ruled Italy for more than four years.

==Minister and president of the Senate==

In August 1964, President Antonio Segni suffered a serious cerebral hemorrhage while he was working at the presidential palace; he only partially recovered and decided to resign. Fanfani tried to be elected president, running against DC&#x27;s official candidate, Giovanni Leone. However, neither Fanfani nor Leone succeeded in being elected, in fact, during the 1964 presidential election, the social-democratic leader Giuseppe Saragat succeeded in gaining the majority of votes. Fanfani&#x27;s reckless action against Leone caused him even more enmities.

In March 1965, Fanfani was appointed Minister of Foreign Affairs, during the second government of Aldo Moro. In December 1965, he was forced to resign after the publication of an unauthorized interview, in which he harshly criticised the government and the United States. However, after only two months, he returned to the office in Moro&#x27;s third cabinet. During his ministry, he implemented a strong pro-European politics, advocating a strengthen of the European Economic Community (EEC). Moreover, he was a vocal opponent of US bombing on civilians during the Vietnam War. Fanfani also continued implementing his pro-Arab policies in the Mediterranean Sea, and tried to build a closer relation with China. From 1965 to 1966, he also served as President of the United Nations General Assembly, becoming the only Italian to have held this office.

In the 1968 general election, Fanfani ran for the Senate of the Republic, being elected in the constituency of Arezzo, with 41,070 votes. On 5 June 1968, he was elected President of the Senate and remained in office until 26 June 1973.

On 26 September 1968, Fanfani lost his wife, Biancarosa, who died of cerebral venous thrombosis, at only 54-year-old.
In March 1970, after the fall of Mariano Rumor&#x27;s second cabinet, President Saragat gave Fanfani the task of forming a new center-left government, but his proposal to bring in the cabinet, all the parties&#x27; secretaries was not accepted, because was seen as an excessive way to strengthen the government, in contrast to the particracy which dominated Italian politics. On 27 March 1970, Rumor was sworn in as prime minister again.

In the 1971 presidential election, Fanfani was proposed as Christian Democracy&#x27;s candidate for the Presidency of the Republic. Once again the move failed, being weakened by the divisions within his own party and the candidacy of the socialist Francesco De Martino, who received votes from PCI, PSI and some PSDI members. Fanfani retired after several unsuccessful ballots and, at the twenty-third round, Giovanni Leone, who was Fanfani&#x27;s rival in the 1964 election, was finally elected with a centre-right majority. On 10 March 1972, Leone appointed Fanfani Senator for life.

===Second term as secretary===
In June 1973 Fanfani was elected secretary of the Christian Democracy for a second term, replacing his former protégé Arnaldo Forlani, who was now a supporter of centrist policies. As such, he led the campaign for the referendum on repealing the law allowing divorce, which was approved by the parliament in 1970. Those voting &quot;yes&quot; wanted to outlaw divorce as had been the case before the law came into effect, and those voting &quot;no&quot; wanted to retain the law and their newly gained right to divorce. The voting method caused significant confusion with many people not understanding that they had to vote &quot;no&quot; to be able to divorce or vote &quot;yes&quot; to outlaw divorce.

The DC and the neo-fascist MSI intensely campaigned for a yes vote to abolish the law and make divorce illegal again. Their main themes were the safeguarding of the traditional nuclear family model and the Roman Catechism; while most left-wing political forces, including PCI and PSI, supported the &quot;no&quot; faction. Fanfani thought that a &quot;no&quot; victory could have given him the control of in his own party again; in fact other key figures like Moro, Rumor, Emilio Colombo and Francesco Cossiga, who believed in the defeat at the referendum, kept a low profile during the campaign.

Despite Fanfani&#x27;s activism, the &quot;no&quot; front was defeated by margin of 59.3% to 40.7% on a voter turnout of 87.7%, thus allowing the divorce laws to remain in force. The soundly defeat in the divorce referendum forced his resignation as party secretary in July 1975. The new secretary of the party was Benigno Zaccagnini, a Christian leftist who was initially supported by Fanfani, but after his ideas of starting a cooperation with the Communist Party, Fanfani, Andreotti and Flaminio Piccoli, tried to forced Zaccagnini to resignation, but they failed.

On 3 August 1975, Fanfani married his second wife, Maria Pia Vecchi (née Tavazzani), a widow and strong-willed woman engaged in multiple voluntary activities, nationally and internationally.

On 5 July 1976, Fanfani was elected President of the Senate for a second term, a position that he held until 1 December 1982. In that new political phase he had to significantly reduce his ambitions of holding an active political role, acting like sober and low-profile statesman. Meanwhile, on 30 July 1976, Moro reached an agreement with the Communist leader, Enrico Berlinguer, to start a government composed only by Christian Democrats but with the abstention of the PCI. The cabinet, who was led by Andreotti, was nicknamed &quot;Government of the non-no-confidence&quot;.

===Kidnapping of Aldo Moro===
In January 1978, Andreotti&#x27;s government fell due to the withdrawal of support from the PCI, which wanted to be directly involved in the government, an hypothesis however rejected by the Christian Democracy.

In March 1978, the political crisis was overcome by the intervention of Aldo Moro, who proposed a new cabinet, again formed only by Christian Democratic politicians, but with positive confidence votes from the other parties, including Berlinguer&#x27;s PCI. This cabinet was formed on 16 March 1978, the day on which Aldo Moro was kidnapped by the left wing terrorist group known as Red Brigades (BR). The dramatic situation which followed brought PCI to vote for Andreotti&#x27;s cabinet for the sake of what was called &quot;national solidarity&quot;, despite its refusal to accept several previous requests.

During the kidnapping of his long-time friend but also rival, despite Andreotti and Cossiga&#x27;s positions, Fanfani did not refuse every possibility of negotiations with the terrorists. Moro was killed by the Red Brigades in May 1978. Fanfani was the only Christian Democratic leader to be allowed by Moro&#x27;s family to participate to the funeral.

==Last terms as prime minister==
In June 1981, Giovanni Spadolini, a member of the Republican Party, was appointed prime minister, becoming the first non-Christian Democrat to hold the office since the foundation of the republic.

In November 1982, Spadolini was forced to resign due to the so-called &quot;godmothers&#x27; quarrel&quot;, a political conflict between ministers Beniamino Andreatta and Rino Formica about the separation between Ministry of Treasury and Bank of Italy. Fanfani, who was still serving as President of the Senate, received the task from President Sandro Pertini of forming a new government and sworn in on 1 December 1982. The cabinet was composed by members of DC, PSI, PSDI, and PLI. Fanfani resigned on 29 April 1983, when, after months of tense relations in the majority, the central committee of the Socialist Party, meeting on 22 April, decided the withdrew its support to the government, calling for new elections.
The 1983 general election resulted in a big loss for DC and its new secretary, Ciriaco De Mita. The Christian Democrats in fact lost more than five percentage points from the previous election, while the PSI gained ground. On 4 August 1983, the socialist leader Bettino Craxi succeeded Fanfani at the head of the government. De Mita accused Fanfani for the electoral defeat and did not candidate him as President of the Senate, preferring Francesco Cossiga. After this fact, it was even clearer how Fanfani had by then lost much of his political power and control over the party.

In the 1985 presidential election, Cossiga was elected as president with 752 votes out of 977. His candidacy was endorsed by the DC, but supported also by communists, socialists, social democrats, liberals and republicans. This was the first time an Italian presidential candidate had won the election on the first ballot, where a two-thirds majority is necessary. On 9 July 1985, Fanfani was re-elected President of the Senate, for a third term.

In April 1987, De Mita decided to drop his support for Craxi&#x27;s government. This caused the immediate fall of the cabinet and the formation of a new government led again by Fanfani. Even though he was a close friend of Craxi, the socialist leader did not participate in the swearing in ceremony, sending the Undersecretary to the Presidency of the Council Giuliano Amato, to protest against De Mita&#x27;s decision. Fanfani&#x27;s sixth government, composed only of DC ministers with some independent ministers, did not gain the confidence in the Chamber of Deputies, following a surreal vote: it gained the confidence from PSI, PSDI and Radicals, that were excluded from the government, while the Christian Democrats abstained. Fanfani presented his resignation after only 11 days as head of government, causing the early dissolution of the houses. He would remain in office until 29 July 1987, when after a general election, a new government was formed with Giovanni Goria at its head.

==After the premiership==
In Goria&#x27;s cabinet, Fanfani was appointed Minister of the Interior, however the government fell in April 1988, after the PSI withdrew its support in opposition to the reopening of the Montalto di Castro nuclear power plant, decided by the government.

Ciriaco De Mita became the new prime minister and Fanfani held the office of Minister of Budget and Economic Planning. However, tensions between Christian Democrats and Socialists continued growing and De Mita was forced to resign in July 1989.

In 1992, Fanfani was elected to the prestigious office of chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee of the Senate and held the role until 1994. In January 1994, he supported the dissolution of the Christian Democracy, which had been overwhelmed by &quot;Tangentopoli&quot; corruption scandal, and the formation of the Italian People&#x27;s Party (PPI).

==Death and legacy==

Fanfani died in Rome on 20 November 1999, at the age 91.

Fanfani is still a controversial figure in Italian politics. Admirers emphasize his reformist agenda and his ambition to cooperate with socialists, laying the groundwork for the birth of the modern centre-left, of which he is widely considered one of the main founding fathers. Critics condemn his centralized and often authoritarian political style, which was probably the main reason for his decline.

He had always believed in the corporate state, considering Fascism only as a &quot;temporary aberration&quot; of corporatism. He never tried to hide his fascist past, but unlike many Italians, he freely admitted that he was wrong.

Fanfani held all positions and offices that a politician could possibly aspire to, except the one he craved most, the presidency of the Republic. His authoritarian nature and factionalism within the Christian Democracy turned out to be the biggest obstacles to the emergence of &quot;Fanfanism&quot;, the Italian version of Gaullism, and one by one he lost all his offices.

In an obituary for &quot;La Stampa&quot;, journalist reflected that Fanfani&#x27;s commitment to public service inspired the values of the state broadcaster RAI, which matured during his political career.

<text>Hollywood Boulevard is a major east–west street in Los Angeles, California. It runs through the Hollywood, East Hollywood, Little Armenia, Thai Town, and Los Feliz districts. Its western terminus is at Sunset Plaza Drive in the Hollywood Hills and its eastern terminus is at Sunset Boulevard in Los Feliz. Hollywood Boulevard is famous for running through the tourist areas in central Hollywood, including attractions such as the Hollywood Walk of Fame and the Ovation Hollywood shopping and entertainment complex.

==Route description==
Hollywood Boulevard&#x27;s western terminus is at Sunset Plaza Drive in the Hollywood Hills. It then runs as a winding residential street down to Laurel Canyon Boulevard. The boulevard then proceeds due east as a major thoroughfare through Hollywood and its popular tourist areas. Part of this segment has been listed in the U.S. National Register of Historic Places as part of Hollywood Boulevard Commercial and Entertainment District. The fifteen blocks between La Brea Avenue east to Gower Street is part of the Hollywood Walk of Fame. The Ovation Hollywood shopping and entertainment complex, the home of the Dolby Theatre, is located at the corner of Hollywood Boulevard and Highland Avenue. And the intersection with Vine Street was once a symbol of Hollywood itself.

East of Gower Street, Hollywood Boulevard crosses the Hollywood Freeway (US 101) before running through East Hollywood. The portion of the boulevard between the Hollywood Freeway and Vermont Avenue forms the northern boundary of Little Armenia, while the portion between Western Avenue and Sunset Boulevard forms part of the southern boundary of Los Feliz. Thai Town is centered along the six blocks of Hollywood Boulevard between Western and Normandie Avenues. After crossing Vermont Avenue, Hollywood Boulevard heads southeast to its eastern terminus at Sunset Boulevard.

Three B (Red) Line Metro Rail stations are located on Hollywood Boulevard: Hollywood/Highland station, Hollywood/Vine station, and Hollywood/Western station.

== History ==

===1890s to 1910===
Part of today&#x27;s Hollywood Boulevard was called Prospect Avenue, a dusty road that ran through Hollywood towards the neighboring city of Los Angeles. In December 1899, a new railroad construction began to connect Hollywood with Los Angeles in a project that was led by Peter Beveridge, H.J. Whitley, and Griffith J. Griffith.

In May 1900, the railroad connecting Hollywood and Los Angeles was completed, and another one was under construction. In 1901, the Town of Hollywood opened the new macadamized road surface with electric railway that ran down its center between Laurel Canyon and Western. Eventually, the road was widened from 20 feet wide to almost 100 feet wide in some areas.

In 1903, Hollywood became a municipality, and Prospect Avenue became sometimes called as the Boulevard of Hollywood, albeit unofficially.

In 1910, the town of Hollywood was incorporated into Los Angeles, and Prospect Avenue was officially renamed Hollywood Boulevard.

===1920s===
In the early 1920s, real estate developer Charles E. Toberman (the &quot;Father of Hollywood&quot;) envisioned a thriving Hollywood theater district. Toberman was involved in 36 real estate development projects while building the Max Factor Salon, Hollywood Roosevelt Hotel and the Hollywood Masonic Temple. He partnered with Sid Grauman, and they opened the three themed theaters: Egyptian, El Capitan (&quot;The Captain&quot;) (1926), and Chinese.

====Regional shopping district====
Starting around 1920, the boulevard and adjacent streets became a major regional shopping district, both for everyday needs and appliances, but increasingly also for high-end clothing and accessories, in part because of the nearby film studios. Chains that opened includes Schwab&#x27;s in 1921, Mullen &amp; Bluett in 1922, I. Magnin in 1923, Myer Siegel in 1925, F. W. Grand and Newberry&#x27;s (dime stores) in 1926–8, and Roos Brothers in 1929. The independent Robertson&#x27;s department store, at and 4 stories tall, opened in 1923. In 1922, stock was sold to finance construction of a much larger department store at Hollywood and Vine, originally to have been a Boadway Bros. When Boadway&#x27;s went out of business the next year, B. H. Dyas, a Downtown Los Angeles–based department store, opened in the building in March 1928, then sold their lease to The Broadway in 1931 – the building still a landmark today, known as the Broadway Hollywood Building. By 1930 the shopping district consisted of over 300 stores. The area would later face competition from areas along Wilshire Boulevard: the easternmost around Bullocks Wilshire which opened in 1929, second the Miracle Mile, and finally, the shopping district of Beverly Hills, where Saks Fifth Avenue opened a store in 1938.

===== Map of businesses in the shopping district at its peak c.1925–8 =====

The following diagram, based on an artistic map by the Hollywood Boulevard Association, and on newspaper advertisements shows the major businesses along Hollywood Boulevard, from the intersection with Vine Street to the intersection with La Brea Avenue, in 1927 or 1928. There are a few relevant notes about major buildings added after 1928. Numbers from 6100–7200 are addresses on Hollywood Boulevard. Dates indicate years of opening, except dates with an asterisk indicate that the establishment was in operation that year according to the source document consulted.

===1940s to 1960s===
In 1946, Gene Autry, while riding his horse in the Hollywood Christmas Parade — which passes down Hollywood Boulevard each year on the Sunday after Thanksgiving — heard young parade watchers yelling, &quot;Here comes Santa Claus, here comes Santa Claus!&quot; and was inspired to write &quot;Here Comes Santa Claus&quot; with Oakley Haldeman.

In 1958, the Hollywood Walk of Fame, which runs from La Brea Avenue east to Gower Street (and an additional three blocks on Vine Street), was created as a tribute to artists working in the entertainment industry.

===Decline===
In the 1970s, the street became very seedy and was frequented by many odd characters as shown in pictures by photographer Ave Pildas.

===Revitalization===
In 1984, a portion of Hollywood Boulevard was listed in the National Register of Historic Places as part of the Hollywood Boulevard Commercial and Entertainment District.

In 1992, the street was paved with glittery asphalt between Vine Street and La Brea Boulevard.

The El Capitan Theatre was refurbished in 1991 then damaged in the 1994 Northridge earthquake. The full El Capitan building was fully restored and upgraded in . The Hollywood Entertainment District, a self-taxing business improvement district, was formed for the properties from La Brea to McCadden on the boulevard.

The Hollywood extension of the Metro Red Line subway was opened in June 1999, running from Downtown Los Angeles to the San Fernando Valley. Stops on Hollywood Boulevard are located at Western Avenue, Vine Street, and Highland Avenue. Metro Local lines 180 and 217 also serve Hollywood Boulevard. A light rail extension station is proposed at the Hollywood Blvd. and Highland Ave. intersection connection the boulevard with West Hollywood, Central LA and LAX.

An anti-cruising ordinance prohibits driving on parts of the boulevard more than twice in four hours.

Beginning in 1995, then Los Angeles City Council member Jackie Goldberg initiated efforts to clean up Hollywood Boulevard and reverse its decades-long slide into disrepute. Central to these efforts was the construction of the Hollywood and Highland Center and adjacent Dolby Theatre (originally known as the Kodak Theatre) in 2001.

In the summer of 2005, the city made revamping plans on Hollywood Boulevard for future tourists. The three-part plan was to exchange the original streetlights with red stars into two-headed old-fashioned streetlights, put in new palm trees, and put in new stoplights. The renovations were completed in late 2005.

In the few years leading up to 2007, more than $2 billion was spent on projects in the neighborhood, including mixed-use retail and apartment complexes and new schools and museums.
In 2021, the &quot;Vogue Theatre&quot;, on Hollywood Boulevard, at Las Palmas, reopened as the &quot;Vogue Multicultural Museum&quot;.

Renovations of the Hollywood and Highland Center began in 2020. The renovated complex was renamed Ovation Hollywood in 2022.

In 2022, for the return of the LA Pride parade to the boulevard, the city installed multi colored lighting to more than 100 trees to illuminate for special events.

====Heart of Hollywood / Walk of Fame Master Plan====
Advocates promote the idea of closing Hollywood Boulevard to traffic and create a Pedestrian zone from La Brea Avenue to Highland Avenue citing an increase in pedestrian traffic including tourism, weekly movie premiers and award shows closures, including 10 days for the Academy Award ceremony at the Dolby Theatre. Similar to other cities in the US, like Third Street Promenade, Fremont Street in Las Vegas, Market St. in San Francisco or the closure in Times Squares Pedestrian Plaza&#x27;s created in 2015.

In June 2019, The City of Los Angeles commissioned Gensler architects to provide a master plan for a $4 million renovation to improve and &quot;update the streetscape concept&quot; for the Walk of Fame between the Pantages Theater (Gower Avenue) at the east and The Emerson Theatre (La Brea Avenue) at the west end of the boulevard. Los Angeles City Councilmember Mitch O&#x27;Farrell released the draft master plan designed by Gensler and Studio-MLA in January 2020. The city&#x27;s Bureau of Engineers proposed a three phase approach to implement the changes. This included adding bike lanes, new landscaping, removing lanes of car traffic, sidewalk widening by removing street parking and art-deco designed street pavers to beautify the boulevard. They also proposed a street mechanism to able to temporarily close the boulevard on pedestrian high capacity days or events where a street closure was approved. Creating public plazas and car free zones. Phase three would disallow east-west travel thru the boulevard but still allow north-south travel along its major intersections, Highland Avenue, Cahuanga Boulevard and Vine Street. The approved phase one was completed and removed parking lanes between Orange Drive and Gower Street in 2022. New district council member for Hollywood, Hugo Soto-Martinez continued with the revitalization plan after defeating O&#x27;Farrell in the 2022 election cycle. A motion was filed June 30, 2023 to implement a tax district to continue funding the master plans phase two and three.
In early March 2024, council member Hugo Soto-Martinez announced &quot;Access to Hollywood&quot; plan. Commencing phase two of the proposed redevelopment. They announced the addition of bus only lanes, bikes lanes and the removal of additional street parking to add sidewalk space for pedestrians. Restructure of lanes to be completed by 2025. Phase three build out has not been announced, pending funding.

Also in East Hollywood area, another plan for boulevard revitalization is planned. LA DOT announced &quot;Vision Zero&quot; in August 2023, a pedestrian friendly streetscaping redesign. LADOT&#x27;s plan focuses on the eastern section of Hollywood Boulevard between Gower Street and east past Vermont Avenue. Plans are to add safety instruments, continental crosswalks and pedestrian friendly alert striping.

A popular event that takes place on the Boulevard is the complete transformation of the street to a Christmas theme. Shops and department stores attract customers by lighting their stores and the entire street with decorated Christmas trees and Christmas lights. The street essentially becomes &quot;Santa Claus Lane.&quot; The route of Hollywood Christmas Parade partially follows Hollywood Boulevard.

<doc id="725885" wikidata="Q746628" url="?curid=725885" title="Studio">
<text>A studio is an artist or worker&#x27;s workroom. This can be for the purpose of acting, architecture, painting, pottery (ceramics), sculpture, origami, woodworking, scrapbooking, photography, graphic design, filmmaking, animation, industrial design, radio or television production broadcasting or the making of music and financial services administration. The term is also used for the workroom of dancers, often specified to dance studio.

The word &quot;studio&quot; is derived from the , from , from &quot;studere&quot;, meaning to or zeal.

The French term for studio, &quot;atelier&quot;, in addition to designating an artist&#x27;s studio is used to characterize the studio of a fashion designer.

&quot;Studio&quot; is also a metonym for the group of people who work within a particular studio.

==Types==
=== Art ===

The studio of any artist, especially from the 15th to the 19th centuries, characterized all the assistants, thus the designation of paintings as &quot;from the workshop of...&quot; or &quot;studio of...&quot;

An art studio is sometimes called an &quot;atelier&quot;, especially in earlier eras. In contemporary, English language use, &quot;atelier&quot; can also refer to the Atelier Method, a training method for artists that usually takes place in a professional artist&#x27;s studio.

The above-mentioned &quot;method&quot; calls upon that zeal for study to play a significant role in the production which occurs in a studio space. A studio is more or less artful to the degree that the artist who occupies it is committed to the continuing education in his or her formal discipline. Academic curricula categorize studio classes in order to prepare students for the rigors of building sets of skills which require a continuity of practice in order to achieve growth and mastery of their artistic expression. A versatile and creative mind will embrace the opportunity of such practice to innovate and experiment, which develops uniquely individual qualities of each artist&#x27;s expression. Thus the method raises and maintains an art studio space above the level of a mere production facility or workshop.

Safety is or may be a concern in studios, with some painting materials required to be handled, stored, or used properly to prevent poisoning, chemical burns, or fire.

===Dance Studio===

=== Educational ===
In educational studios, students learn to develop skills related to design, ranging from architecture to product design. In specific, educational studios are studio settings where large numbers of students learn to draft and design with instructional help at a college. Educational studios are colloquially referred to as &quot;studio&quot; by students, who are known for staying up late hours into the night doing projects and socializing.

The studio environment is characterized by two types in education:
# The workspace where students do usually visually-centered work in an open environment. This time and space is beyond that of instructional time and faculty guidance is not available. It allows for students to engage each other, help each other, and inspire each other while working.
# A type of class that takes the above-mentioned workshop space, and recreates its core component of an open working environment. It differentiates itself based on a topic of instruction, isolated space, instructor led/included, and an added focus of directed criticism.

=== Pottery ===
Studio pottery is made by an individual potter working on his own in his studio, rather than in a ceramics factory (although there may be a design studio within a larger manufacturing site).

=== Production ===
Production studios are those studios which act as centres for the production in any of the arts; alternatively they can also be the financial and commercial entity behind such endeavours. In radio and television production studio is the place where programs and radio commercial and television advertising are recorded for further emission.

=== Animation ===
Animation studios, like movie studios, may be production facilities, or financial entities. In some cases, especially in anime, they continue the tradition of a studio where a master or group of talented individuals oversee the work of lesser artists and crafts persons in realising their vision. Animation studios are a fast rising entity and they include established firms such as Walt Disney and Pixar.

=== Comics===
A comics studio is a workroom or entertainment company that makes comics. Comics creators, employ small studios of staff to assist in the creation of a comic strip, comic book or graphic novel.

In the early days of &quot;Dan Dare&quot;, Frank Hampson employed a number of staff at his studio to help with the production of the strip. Eddie Campbell is another creator who has assembled a small studio of colleagues to help him in his art, and the comic book industry in the United States has based its production methods upon the studio system employed at its beginnings.

Another type of studio, common for instance in Spain, would produce work for-hire on license, with prospective buyers bringing in their own franchises for artwork and occasionally new stories.

=== Instructional ===

Many universities are creating studio settings for courses outside the artist&#x27;s realm. There are several different projects along these lines, most notably the SCALE-UP (Student-Centered Active Learning Environment for Undergraduate Programs) initiated at NC State.

=== Mastering ===
In audio, a mastering studio is a facility specialised in audio mastering. Tasks may include but not be limited to audio restoration, corrective and tone-shaping EQ, dynamic control, stereo or 5.1 surround editing, vinyl and tape transfers, vinyl cutting, and CD compilation. Depending on the quality of the original mix, the mastering engineer&#x27;s role can change from small corrections to improving the overall sound of a mix drastically. Typically studios contain a combination of high-end analogue equipment with low-noise circuitry and digital hardware and plug-ins. Some may contain tape machines and disc cutting lathes. They may also contain full-range monitoring systems and be acoustically tuned to provide an accurate reproduction of the sound information contained in the original medium. The mastering engineer must prepare the file for its intended destination, which may be radio, CD, vinyl or digital distribution.

In video production, a mastering studio is a facility specialized in the post-production of video recordings. Tasks may include but not be limited to: video editing, colour grading correction, mixing, DVD authoring and audio mastering. The mastering engineer must prepare the file for its intended destination, which may be broadcast, DVD or digital distribution.

=== Acting ===

An &quot;acting studio&quot; is an institution or workspace (similar to a dance studio) in which actors rehearse and refine their craft. The Neighborhood Playhouse and Actors Studio are legendary acting studios in New York.

=== Movie ===
A movie studio is a company which develops, equips and maintains a controlled environment for filmmaking. This environment may be interior (sound stage), exterior (backlot) or both.

=== Photographic ===
A photographic studio is both a workspace and a corporate body. As a workspace it provides space to take, develop, print and duplicate photographs.

=== Radio ===
A radio studio is a room in which a radio program or show is produced, either for live broadcast or for recording for a later broadcast. The room is soundproofed to avoid unwanted noise being mixed into the broadcast.

=== Recording ===
A recording studio is a facility for sound recording which generally consists of at least two rooms: the studio or live room, and the control room, where the sound from the studio is recorded and manipulated. They are designed so that they have good acoustics and so that there is good isolation between the rooms.

=== Television ===
A television studio is an installation in which television or video productions take place, for live television, for recording video tape, or for the acquisition of raw footage for post-production. The design of a studio is similar to, and derived from, movie studios, with a few amendments for the special requirements of television production. A professional television studio generally has several rooms, which are kept separate for noise and practicality reasons.

=== Zen, Yoga and martial arts ===
Many healing arts and activities such as zen, yoga, judo and karate are &quot;studied&quot; in a studio. It is widespread to see yoga studios and martial arts studios established in settings that might previously have been for other uses, described as studios. These are not recreational centers or gyms in the traditional sense, but places where students of these activities practice or study their art.

<text>Carla Venita Thomas (born December 21, 1942) is an American singer, who is often referred to as the Queen of Memphis Soul. She is best known for her 1960s recordings for Atlantic and Stax including the hits &quot;Gee Whiz (Look at His Eyes)&quot; (1960), &quot;B-A-B-Y&quot; (1966) and &quot;Tramp&quot; (1967), a duet with Otis Redding. She is the daughter of Rufus Thomas.

==Biography==
===Childhood===
Thomas was born and raised in the Foote Homes Projects in Memphis, Tennessee, United States. Along with her siblings, Marvell and Vaneese, she was one of three musical children of Rufus and Lorene Thomas. Despite growing up in the projects, the Thomas family lived near the Palace Theater on Beale Street, as Rufus was the theater&#x27;s Master of Ceremonies (MC) for their amateur shows. This access not only gave Thomas her first taste of the music world but it also provided a springboard for her transformation into the Queen of the Memphis Sound.

===Teen Town Singers===
In Memphis, the African-American-centered WDIA radio station sponsored a rotating musical group of high school students called the Teen Town Singers; notable alumni include Anita Louis and Isaac Hayes. Although the requirements to join the Teen Town Singers stated that the person should be of high school age, Thomas became a member in 1952 at the age of 10. She was able to sneak into their ranks thanks to the fact that her father Rufus was an on-air personality for the radio station. This opportunity with the Teen Town Singers did not come without its drawbacks though.

As a 10-year-old student, Thomas was responsible for not only attending classes and completing her schoolwork, but she also had to attend rehearsals on Wednesdays and Fridays after school and then perform at the station on Saturday. Despite the grueling schedule, she enjoyed the experience: &quot;It was a lot of fun, it really was.&quot; She remained with the Teen Town Singers until the end of her senior year.

===1960s===

Thomas is best known for the work she completed for both Atlantic Records and most notably, Stax Records in the 1960s. Her first record, &quot;&#x27;Cause I Love You&quot; (1960), was a duet with her father, with brother Marvell on keyboards, that was released by Satellite Records, which eventually became Stax Records. Recorded when Thomas was still attending Hamilton High School in Memphis, the record drew enough local attention to catch the interest of Jerry Wexler of Atlantic Records.

He signed a deal with the owners of Satellite Records, Jim Stewart and Estelle Axton, to distribute &quot;Cause I Love You&quot; and thus paved the way for Thomas’ most famous single, &quot;Gee Whiz (Look at His Eyes)&quot;, reaching number 10 on the pop chart and number 5 on the R&amp;B chart. While she continued to have success on the R&amp;B charts throughout the 1960s, her only other solo top 40 pop hit was &quot;B-A-B-Y&quot;, reaching number 14 in 1966. Her duet, &quot;Tramp&quot;, with Otis Redding reached number 26 on the pop chart the following year.and her album of duets with Otis Redding, &quot;King &amp; Queen&quot;, was a number 18 hit in the UK Albums Chart.

====&quot;Gee Whiz (Look at His Eyes)&quot;====
Although this single would eventually chart within the Top 10 on the pop chart and within the top 5 on the R&amp;B chart, it had an inauspicious beginning. Initially recorded at the Thomas family home, Rufus shopped the song to Vee-Jay Records in Chicago. Vee-Jay never followed through or actively pursued securing the distribution rights. Because of his belief in the song&#x27;s potential, Rufus returned to Memphis and in the summer of 1960, Thomas would cut the teen love song that she wrote when she was only 15 years old. The song was released by Rufus and Carla in October 1960, to not much fanfare. By February 1961, thanks to a distribution deal between Satellite and Atlantic Records, the song was being distributed nationally through Atlantic just as Thomas was in the midst of her first year at Tennessee A&amp;I University in Nashville. The success of the single also propelled Thomas into the spotlight, as she performed on &quot;American Bandstand&quot;. According to Thomas, &quot;The record was young-sounding, romantic and it expressed what a lot of people wanted to say at that age, but still, I was surprised at how well it did&quot;. Not only did this song provide a launching pad for Thomas&#x27; first album, but it also gave Stax Records national exposure and label recognition.

===1970s–present===
After her last Stax recording in 1971, &quot;Love Means...&quot;, and an appearance in &quot;Wattstax&quot; in 1972, Thomas slipped into relative obscurity when compared to her 1960s musical heyday. She featured in a number of modern-day projects, including a 1994 compilation of her greatest hits, a 2002 live recording of a Memphis performance and the 2007 release &quot;Live at the Bohemian Caverns&quot; in Washington, D.C., a long lost live recording of Thomas in 1967. She would also occasionally tour during the 1980s and became heavily involved in the “Artists in the Schools” program that provided Memphis schoolchildren with access to successful artists. These workshops were organized to talk to teenagers about music, performing arts and drug abuse. In 1991, she appeared with her father at the Porretta Terme Soul Festival. In 1993, Thomas was awarded the prestigious Pioneer Award, along with such musical heavyweights as James Brown and Solomon Burke, from the Rhythm &amp; Blues Foundation in honor of her career achievements. She was also featured in the 2003 documentary &quot;Only the Strong Survive&quot;, that was shown at the Cannes Film Festival and showcased important Stax recording artists. In 2021, Thomas featured on Valerie June&#x27;s single &quot;Call Me a Fool&quot;, which received a GRAMMY nomination for Best American Roots Song.

==Artistry==
===Influences===
Carla&#x27;s biggest influence was her father, Rufus. Besides accompanying him during his &#x27;MC&#x27; days at the Palace Theater, Rufus also encouraged and believed in his daughter&#x27;s ability. According to Carla, “My dad probably discovered I could sing before I did”. He was also instrumental in setting the stage for her Teen Town Singers gig and for actively pursuing and promoting her breakthrough single, &quot;Gee Whiz&quot;.

Musically, Thomas was inspired by Jackie Wilson and Brenda Lee.

<doc id="725892" wikidata="Q1121256" url="?curid=725892" title="Young Adam (film)">
<text>Young Adam is a 2003 British erotic drama film written and directed by David Mackenzie and starring Ewan McGregor, Tilda Swinton, Peter Mullan, Ewan Stewart and Emily Mortimer. The film is based on the 1954 novel of the same name by Alexander Trocchi.

==Plot==
The film is set in Scotland in 1954. Shiftless young drifter Joe Taylor works on a barge which operates from Glasgow, on the River Clyde, along the Forth and Clyde and Union Canals to Edinburgh. He shares the cramped on-board living quarters with its operators, Les and Ella Gault, and their young son Jim. One day Joe and Les pull the body of a young woman, Cathie Dimly, naked except for a petticoat, from the water. Via flashbacks, we learn Joe knew her, and scenes involving his relationship with Cathie are juxtaposed with those set in the present time.

After finding Cathie&#x27;s body, Joe and Les go to a local pub to play darts. Joe leaves Les behind and returns to the barge, where Ella succumbs to his advances. Not wanting to disturb the sleeping Jim, the two engage in sex on the towpath. It proves to be the first of many such encounters they enjoy whenever they can find a few moments away from Les.

In the past, Joe meets Cathie, an office worker, on a beach and the two soon are living together. He aspires to be a writer and spends his days banging on a battered typewriter while she works to support them. Joe begins to suffer from chronic writer&#x27;s block and Cathie, unhappy with his lack of productivity, accuses him of taking advantage of her. In violent reply to her words, Joe humiliates Cathie, beats and rapes her. He packs his meager belongings and moves out. After tossing his typewriter in a canal, he meets Les, who offers him a job on the barge.

Les eventually becomes aware of Ella and Joe&#x27;s affair and moves out of the barge, which belongs to her, and Ella and Joe drift into a more serious relationship. When she receives word her brother-in-law has died, she and Joe visit her sister Gwen and invite her to spend a couple of weeks with them. One evening, on the pretext Gwen would like to see a movie, she and Joe leave the barge and go to a pub. After a few drinks, the two have sex in an alleyway.

Eventually, Ella&#x27;s desire to settle in the suburbs and her no-nonsense supervision of the barge&#x27;s daily commercial activities put a dampener on the unbridled passion in her relationship with Joe, and he packs and leaves.

In the past, Joe and Cathie reunite on the waterfront and have sex beneath a parked truck. She reveals she is two months pregnant with his child, and when Joe nonchalantly begins to walk away, she runs after him, trips, and falls into the water while dressed only in her petticoat. Joe makes no move to rescue her and, when she fails to surface, he panics and runs away.

Past and present converge. Daniel Gordon, a plumber whom Cathie was casually seeing, is arrested and tried for her murder, and Joe spends a few days in the courtroom listening to testimony. Guilt-stricken, he writes an anonymous note absolving Daniel of the crime and leaves it where a courthouse clerk can find it but it has no effect on the trial, and Daniel is found guilty and sentenced to be hanged. Unwilling to risk his life, Joe opts not to confess how Cathie really died and leaves the area.

==Cast==
==Production==
The film was shot on location in Gullane in East Lothian, along the Union Canals from Edinburgh to Falkirk, on the Forth and Clyde and in Clydebank, Dumbarton, Renton in West Dunbartonshire, Grangemouth and Perth and Kinross.

The film was scored by David Byrne and the soundtrack was released under the title &quot;Lead Us Not into Temptation&quot;.

Talking about the rough sex scene with Ewan McGregor, Emily Mortimer said, &quot;There&#x27;s something really liberating about letting it rip and just going for it. There&#x27;s no way in real life you&#x27;ll ever be allowed to get up to all that - I mean, unless you were really into kinky stuff.&quot;

== Release ==
The film was screened in the Un Certain Regard section at the 2003 Cannes Film Festival. It was also shown at the Moscow Film Festival, the Edinburgh Film Festival, the Telluride Film Festival, the Toronto International Film Festival and the Athens Film Festival before going into theatrical release in the UK on 26 September 2003. It earned $1,135,673 in the United Kingdom and $2,561,820 worldwide.

When the film was released in the United States, the Motion Picture Association of America rated it NC-17 for &quot;some explicit sexual content,&quot; notably a 14-second scene depicting oral sex.

==Critical reception==
&quot;Young Adam&quot; holds a approval rating on review aggregate Rotten Tomatoes, based on reviews, with an average rating of . The critical consensus states that the film is &quot;A grim mood piece with good performances from the leads.&quot; On Metacritic, the film has a score of 67 out of 100 based on 32 critics, indicating &quot;generally favorable reviews&quot;.

Philip French of &quot;The Guardian&quot; called it &quot;a cleverly constructed film that holds the attention throughout its economical 95 minutes. The naturalistic acting has considerable power, with Tilda Swinton giving a characteristically unself-regarding performance and Ewan McGregor steering clear of easy charm. But it is a depressing film exuding hopelessness and inviting us to pity the characters rather than share in their tragic condition.&quot;

A.O. Scott of the &quot;New York Times&quot; observed, &quot;The storytelling is deliberately disjointed, jumping back and forth in time without warning, so that the meaning of events and the connections among them emerge retrospectively. This creates a mood of unease and dislocation, a noirish dread that persists even after certain crucial mysteries are solved. The narrative scheme, the brooding period atmosphere, the understated score (by David Byrne) and the precision of the acting also make the story seem more interesting than it is. Joe, though in some ways fairly passive, is sexually voracious as well as sexually irresistible . . . In the end, Joe&#x27;s sexuality, while exhibited with quite a bit more explicitness than the old movies would permit, is also what makes &quot;Young Adam&quot; feel most dated. Its view of male narcissism, as expressed through erotic need, is not only uncritical but also pretentious. The film follows the novel (and many others like it) in assuming, rather than proving, that its hero&#x27;s selfishness and failure offer clues to the human condition, rather than evidence of individual limitation.&quot;

Manohla Dargis of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; observed, &quot;Unlike the novel, which is written in the first person . . . the film assumes a markedly less claustrophobic, less personal point of view. Everything happens more or less through Joe&#x27;s eyes, but Mackenzie, having rejected a voice-over narration, never gets inside the character the way Martin Scorsese gets inside Travis Bickle in &quot;Taxi Driver&quot; . . . While the novel turns Joe into a question mark, Mackenzie takes a more palatable, less ambiguous approach to the character. The casting of McGregor also softens Joe. Even tamped down and without his easy smile, the actor conveys so much natural charm he&#x27;s a sorry excuse for a moral void. These changes compromise the adaptation but generally improve the story since Trocchi&#x27;s existentialism has neither the heft of Jean-Paul Sartre nor the pulp pleasures of James M. Cain. Mackenzie may have realized the shortcomings in Trocchi&#x27;s prose or decided he didn&#x27;t want to condemn his film commercially. Whichever the case, he has greatly tempered the story&#x27;s brutality the old-fashioned way: He puts an appealing, sympathetic star at the center and surrounds him with beautiful visuals, with a darkly contrasting color palette of bruising black and blue.&quot;

Carla Meyer of the &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot; thought Tilda Swinton&#x27;s &quot;rich, compelling performance is reason enough to see this uneven picture, which devolves from a riveting romantic triangle to a morality tale without a moral center . . . McGregor has trouble negotiating the role of a man playing at life. He excels at showing the writer&#x27;s vanity (in captain&#x27;s hat and jacket, McGregor looks like a rent boy), but not what makes him tick.&quot;

Mike Clark of &quot;USA Today&quot; noted, &quot;This movie is so much the opposite of uplifting that you think Gary Oldman ought to be in it. But it&#x27;s honestly made, and its second half does linger in the memory.&quot;

Derek Elley of &quot;Variety&quot; called the film &quot;strongly cast&quot; and &quot;a resonant, beautifully modulated relationships drama&quot; that &quot;establishes Mackenzie as an accessible stylist within mid-range [contemporary] British cinema.

==Awards and nominations==

<doc id="725893" wikidata="Q259059" url="?curid=725893" title="Household">
<text>A household consists of one or more persons who live in the same dwelling. It may be of a single family or another type of person group. The household is the basic unit of analysis in many social, microeconomic and government models, and is important to economics and inheritance.

Household models include families, blended families, shared housing, group homes, boarding houses, houses of multiple occupancy (UK), and single room occupancy (US). In feudal societies, the royal household and medieval households of the wealthy included servants and other retainers.

==Government definitions==
For statistical purposes in the United Kingdom, a household is defined as &quot;one person or a group of people who have the accommodation as their only or main residence and for a group, either share at least one meal a day or share the living accommodation, that is, a living room or sitting room&quot;. The introduction of legislation to control houses of multiple occupations in the UK Housing Act (2004) required a tighter definition of a single household. People can be considered a household if they are related: full- or half-blood, foster, step-parent/child, in-laws (and equivalent for unmarried couples), a married couple or unmarried but &quot;living as ...&quot; (same- or different-sex couples).

The United States Census definition also hinges on &quot;separate living quarters&quot;: &quot;those in which the occupants live and eat separately from any other persons in the building.&quot; According to the U.S. census, a householder is the &quot;person (or one of the people) in whose name the housing unit is owned or rented (maintained)&quot;; if no person qualifies, any adult resident of a housing unit is considered a householder. The U.S. government formerly used &quot;head of the household&quot; and &quot;head of the family&quot;, but those terms were replaced with &quot;householder&quot; in 1980. In the census definition of a household, it
On July 15, 1998, Statistics Canada said: &quot;A household is generally defined as being composed of a person or group of persons who co-reside in, or occupy, a dwelling.&quot;

==Economic definition==

Although a one-income-stream economic theory simplifies modeling, it does not necessarily reflect reality. Many, if not most, households have several income-earning members. Most economic models do not equate households and traditional families, and there is not always a one-to-one relationship between households and families.

==Social definitions==
In social work, a household is defined similarly: a residential group in which housework is divided and performed by householders. Care may be delivered by one householder to another, depending upon their respective needs, abilities, and (perhaps) disabilities. Household composition may affect life and health expectations and outcomes for its members. Eligibility for community services and welfare benefits may depend upon household composition.

In sociology, household work strategy (a term coined by Ray Pahl in his 1984 book, &quot;Divisions of Labour&quot;) is the division of labour among members of a household. Household work strategies vary over the life cycle as household members age, or with the economic environment; they may be imposed by one person, or be decided collectively.

Feminism examines how gender roles affect the division of labour in households. In &quot;The Second Shift&quot; and &quot;The Time Bind&quot;, sociologist Arlie Russell Hochschild presents evidence that in two-career couples men and women spend about equal amounts of time working; however, women spend more time on housework. Cathy Young (another feminist writer) says that in some cases, women may prevent the equal participation of men in housework and parenting.

==Models==

Household models in the English-speaking world include traditional and blended families, shared housing, and group homes for people with support needs. Other models which may meet definitions of a household include boarding houses, houses in multiple occupation (UK), and single room occupancy (US).

==History==

In feudal or aristocratic societies, a household may include servants or retainers who derive their income from the household&#x27;s principal income.

==Housing statistics==
















== Housing conditions ==

A 1948 law permitted gradual, long-term rent increases for existing flats on the condition that part of the money was spent on repairs. According to John Ardagh, the law, &quot;vigorously applied, was partly successful in its twofold aim: to encourage both repairs and new building.&quot; In 1974 an estimated 17% of the French population lived in a detached house, while 2% lived in an attached house, 78% in an apartment or flat, and 3% in other types of homes (trailers, mobile homes, etc.).

=== United Kingdom ===

After World War II, a large percentage of British housing was single-family housing. Seventy-eight percent of housing in 1961 consisted of single-family homes, compared to 56 percent in the Netherlands, 49 percent in West Germany and 32 percent in France. In England and Wales in 1964, 6.6 percent of housing units had two or fewer rooms; 5.8 percent had seven or more rooms, 15.2 percent had six rooms, 35.1 percent had five rooms, 26.3 percent had four rooms, and 11.1 percent had three rooms. These figures included kitchens when they were used for eating meals. Fifty percent of 1964 housing had three bedrooms; 1.9 percent had five or more bedrooms, 6.2 percent had four bedrooms, 10.5 percent had one bedroom or none, and 31.3 percent had two bedrooms. A 1960 social survey estimated that 0.6 percent of households in England and Wales exceeded the statutory overcrowding standard; the 1964 percentage was 0.5 percent. In 1964, 6.9 of all households exceeded one person per room. The 1960 figure was 11 percent, with 1.75 percent having two or more bedrooms below the standard and 9.25 percent having one bedroom below the standard. This declined slightly by 1964 to 9.4 percent of households below the standard, with 8.1 percent having one bedroom below the standard and 1.3 percent having two bedrooms or more below the standard. According to local authorities in 1965, five percent of the housing stock in England and Wales was unfit for habitation. In 1974 an estimated 23% of the population of the UK lived in a detached house, while 50% lived in an attached house, 23% in an apartment or flat, and 4% in other types of homes (trailers, mobile homes, etc.).

In Canada from 1951 to 1971, the percentage of dwellings with a bath or shower increased from 60.8 to 93.4 percent; the percentage of dwellings with hot and cold running water increased from 56.9 to 93.5 percent. In the United States from 1950 to 1974, the percentage of housing without full plumbing fell from 34 to three percent; during that period, the percentage of housing stock considered dilapidated fell from nine percent to less than four. In 1976, an estimated 64% of the population of the U.S. lived in a detached house, while 4% lived in an attached house, 28% in an apartment or flat, and 4% in other types of homes (trailers, mobile homes, etc.). In terms of amenities, in 1975 an estimated 2% of all houses in the U.S. were without a flush toilet, 1% without electric lighting, 3% without a fixed bath or shower and 1% without piped water. In 1977 an estimated 59% of the population of Canada lived in a detached house, while 8% lived in an attached house, and 33% in an apartment or flat.

<text>The Commission for Racial Equality (CRE) was a non-departmental public body in the United Kingdom which aimed to address racial discrimination and promote racial equality. The commission was established in 1976, and disbanded in 2007 when its functions were taken over by the newly created Equality and Human Rights Commission.

== History ==
The Commission was established by the Race Relations Act 1976, under James Callaghan&#x27;s Labour government. Its first Chairman was former Conservative MP, David Lane. It was formed through the amalgamation of the Race Relations Board and the Community Relations Commission.

The Race Relations Act, which has now been superseded by the Equality Act 2010, applied in England, Wales and Scotland. It did not apply in Northern Ireland, where the Race Relations (NI) Order 1997 applies. The CRE&#x27;s work covered all the areas where people were protected against discrimination under the Race Relations Act.

The mission statement of the commission was: &quot;We work for a just and integrated society, where diversity is valued. We use persuasion and our powers under the law to give everyone an equal chance to live free from fear of discrimination, prejudice and racism&quot;.

The main goals of the CRE were:
* To encourage greater integration and better relations between people from different ethnic groups.
* To use its legal powers to help eradicate racial discrimination and harassment.
* To work with government and public authorities to promote racial equality in all public services.
* To support local and regional organisations, and employers in all sectors, in their efforts to ensure equality of opportunity and good race relations.
* To raise public awareness of racial discrimination and injustice, and to win support for efforts to create a fairer and more equal society.

The CRE organised the annual Race in the Media Awards (RIMA), launched in 1992, to encourage more informed coverage of race relations, diversity and multiculturalism as well as acknowledging excellence in the coverage of race issues by the UK media. In 2005, the Media Personality of the Year award was won by footballer Thierry Henry &quot;for his strong stance against racism in football, most notably by initiating Nike&#x27;s &#x27;Stand Up, Speak Up&#x27; campaign&quot;.

When the CRE ceased to exist as a separate entity, its library was acquired by the Ahmed Iqbal Ullah Race Relations Resource Centre at the University of Manchester.

==Issues==
* In October 2004, the Commission was to be merged into a new single Great Britain equalities body, the Equality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC). However, the CRE proposed a new non-governmental public body to work alongside the CEHR to guide, advise and mediate on community relations, civic engagement and citizenship.
* Segregation. On 22 September 2005, in the aftermath of the July bombings in London, Trevor Phillips gave a speech, &quot;Sleepwalking to Segregation&quot;, warning that the UK was in danger of becoming a segregated nation.
* National identity cards. In its January 2005 report, the CRE raised concerns over the potential effects of the Identity Cards Bill on ethnic minority and vulnerable groups in society.

==Commissioners==
&quot;See also :Category:Commissioners for Racial Equality&quot;

The CRE was run by up to 15 commissioners (including the chair), who were appointed by the Home Secretary. At January 2007 the commissioners were:
* Kay Hampton (Chair)
* Khurshid Ahmed
* Yaseen Ahmed
* Mohammed Aziz
* Sir Colin Budd
* Julia Chain
* Jane Codona
* Rev Aled Edwards
* Dilwar Hussain
* Sir Dexter Hutt
* Uzo Iwobi
* Sir Digby Jones
* Gloria Mills
* Cherry Short

==Controversy==
When it was first established, there was much judicial and governmental unrest about the scope of the Commission&#x27;s investigatory powers. In one particular case, Lord Denning MR went so far as to compare the use by the CRE of its investigative powers to &quot;the days of the inquisition&quot;, and to suggest that it had in consequence created racial discord. Subsequent House of Lords decisions made clear that the Commission had no power to launch investigations into employers&#x27; affairs where there had been no allegation of discrimination.

<text>Francesc Cambó i Batlle (; 2 September 1876 – 30 April 1947) was a conservative Spanish politician from Catalonia, founder and leader of the autonomist party &quot;Lliga Regionalista&quot;. He was a minister in several Spanish governments. He supported a number of artistic and cultural endeavours, especially, the translation of Greek and Latin classical texts to Catalan.

==Biography==
Francesc (Francisco de Asís) Cambó y Batlle, as his full name was, was born in Verges in the comarca of Baix Empordà, Catalonia, Spain. on September 2, 1876.

=== Bismarck or Bolívar ===

He was the most influential figure of the so-called “regenerationist catalanism” in the first third of the 20th century Spain. Since his youth he was active in regionalist organizations, some of which he had co-founded. In 1901 he founded a new political party, the Lliga Regionalista de Catalunya, being elected that same year as municipal councilor in the city of Barcelona. At that time, a speech pronounced before King Alfonso XIII in official visit in Barcelona, in which Cambó defended the need of a solution to the &quot;Catalan problem&quot; but &quot;in Spain&quot; and, of course, within the monarchy&quot; unleashed the wrath of his party rivals, (as well described in the movie &quot;The burned city&quot;). As the Catalan political movement split in 1904 Cambó, who promoted a more conservative and possibilist approach to the issue of identity and regional political power, along with Enric Prat de la Riba, became the undisputed leader of the conservative branch of the Catalan movement. In 1906, and supported by almost all Catalan political and social sectors, Cambó drove the movement &quot;Solidaritat Catalana&quot; or Catalan Solidarity, in response to a most controversial “law of jurisdictions” approved by the central Government. As electoral platform, that movement took hold dramatically and obtained 41 deputies in the Cortes (Spanish Parliament) in the elections of 1907. With this political potential, Cambó tried to impose his theses defending the conservative project, in harmony with Spanish politics. Strongly criticized by the more nationalistic and radical sectors - he had survived a shooting by a gunman during the 1907 election campaign-, the project ended up failing at the ballot box in 1908. Still, from his seat in Parliament, Cambó continued advocating both for Catalan interventionism in the policy of the Government in Madrid, and for a strong autonomy in his Region. This combination of political positions led him to being sometimes considered as a disguised independentist in Madrid, and as a traitor in Barcelona. “You cannot be at the same time Catalonia’s Simon Bolívar and Spain’s Bismarck”, he was famously told once during a parliamentary debate by Nicelo Alcalá Zamora on December 10, 1918. Cambó was appointed Spanish Minister twice by the King, in the context of larger political agreements that reserved a seat to Catalan representatives in the Council of Ministers. In 1918 he was appointed Minister of Development and Public Investment (Ministerio de Fomento); in 1921 he was appointed Minister of Finance.

The Coup d’État of General Primo de Rivera made him depart from active politics, and focus in business and the publication of several works, mostly of political reflection: his vision of the Middle East; considerations about Italian Fascism; and more generally, about dictatorships. In 1930 he wrote &quot;Per la Concòrdia&quot; (“In favor of Harmony”), which sought to reconcile the monarchy and autonomy of Catalonia. In a last political effort in the already tense Catalan and Spanish political environment that would lead to the fall of the Spanish Monarchy, Cambó founded in March 1931 a new party, the “Constitutional Center”, hoping in vain that he could stem the Republican tide. After the proclamation of the Second Spanish Republic in 1932, Cambó moved to France returning shortly afterwards. In February 1933 he changed the name of his older party, now renamed as Liga Catalana or Catalan League, and in that year November&#x27;s elections he was elected to Parliament for the last time.

=== The Civil War and final years ===
When General Francisco Franco and his Nationalist forces revolted against the Republic in July 1936, Cambó was outside the country. Cambó provided financial support to the “Nationals” during the Civil War that followed the &quot;Alzamiento&quot; or uprising. Cambó would write later in his Memoirs: “having to choose between idiots and criminals, I chose the idiots”. In his view, the success of the Republicans in the war would have put the whole of Spain under the control of Moscow and Communism. Francesc Cambó never returned to live in Spain after the Civil War, which he passed in exile with his family in Paris and Montreux (Switzerland). In 1942, after two years living in New York, he moved to Buenos Aires, where he died in 1947. He was survived by his daughter, Helena, born in 1929 from his relationship with Mercedes Mallol, whom he would marry several years later. In 1976, only months after the death of the Dictator, his corpse was returned among public acclamation to be buried at the Montjuïc Cemetery in Barcelona.

=== The collector and patron ===
While mostly known as a politician, Cambó had other relevant activities along his life. As a young lawyer, he once had Nijinsky, the dancer, as client, saving him from ending in jail at the request of his lover and impresario Diaghilev. In 1918 Cambó made an important fortune, as a result of several business operations related to the international distribution and supply of electricity. From that moment on, while using part of that money to live by very high standards, he became one of the most important art private collectors and cultural donors in the history of his country. During his life he promoted many social and cultural initiatives, on his own or supporting others, as for example the educational projects for women of Francesca Bonnemaison. Several of these projects were addressed to the consolidation of the Catalan language, such as the Collection Bernat Metge, a monumental translation into Catalan of all Greek classic writers, or the funding of the most important Catalan Dictionary by the most respected linguist Pompeu Fabra, or the financing of a new modern translation of the Bible into Catalan language. He bequeathed almost all his artworks to the public in state museums in Madrid, at the Prado Museum and in Barcelona (today, the Cambó Bequest can be visited at the MNAC).

=== Assessment ===
Cambó has remained a controversial figure up to this day. On the one side, historians remain interested in the most conflictive aspects of his life, such as Cambó&#x27;s financial support during the Civil War or his possible connections to corrupted politicians in Argentina during the last years of his life. On the other, his political position in favor of a “strong Catalonia in a Great Spain” remains active in the public conversation as the source of inspiration for unionist political leaders, while also being the object of criticism by independence supporters.

<text>The Olive Tree () was a denomination used for several successive centre-left political and electoral alliances of Italian political parties from 1995 to 2007.

The historical leader and ideologue of these coalitions was Romano Prodi, Professor of Economics and former leftist Christian Democrat, who invented the name and the symbol of The Olive Tree with Arturo Parisi in 1995. For the 2006 general election The Olive Tree was largely supplanted by a wider Prodi-led alliance called The Union, while The Olive Tree remained a smaller federation of parties which merged to form the Democratic Party in October 2007, which continues to be the lead party of an unnamed centre-left coalition.

==History==

===The Olive Tree coalition===

====In government with Prodi (1996–1998)====
On 21 April 1996, The Olive Tree won 1996 general election in alliance with the Communist Refoundation Party (PRC), making Romano Prodi the Prime Minister of Italy. It was the first time since 1946 that the Communists, now gathered in the Democratic Party of the Left, took part in the government of the country and one of their leaders, Walter Veltroni, who ran in ticket with Prodi in a long electoral campaign, was Deputy Prime Minister.

In 1996 the coalition was formed by the following parties:

Besides the external support of PRC, the coalition received the support also of some minor parties: the Italian Republican Party (PRI, social-liberal), The Network (social-liberal), the South Tyrolean People&#x27;s Party (regionalist) and some other minor parties which later merged with PDS.

====From D&#x27;Alema to Rutelli (1998–2004)====
On 9 October 1998, the Prodi I Cabinet fell when PRC left the alliance. Since 21 October 1998 The Olive Tree was the core of the governments led by Massimo D&#x27;Alema (I and II Cabinet, 1998–2000) and by Giuliano Amato (II Cabinet, 2000–2001). When D&#x27;Alema became Prime Minister, it was the first time ever in Italy and in Europe that an heir of the communist tradition came to lead a government.

On 13 May 2001, led by Francesco Rutelli, who ran in ticket with Piero Fassino, the coalition lost the general elections against Silvio Berlusconi and his House of Freedoms centre-right coalition. In the 2001 general election, the coalition was composed of six parties:

===The Olive Tree list and federation===
On 12 June 2004, The Olive Tree, as United in the Olive Tree (&quot;Uniti nell&#x27;Ulivo&quot;), ran in the European Parliament election gaining 31.1% of popular votes. The Olive Tree of 2004 was a tighter alliance of only four parties:
On 13 September 2004, The Olive Tree was transformed in the Federation of The Olive Tree, consisting of same four parties that campaigned together in the European elections that summer. Romano Prodi, who came back to politics in that year, after five years of President of the European Commission, was elected President of the federation, which was to become the core of a larger centre-left coalition.
On 10 February 2005, the name and logo of that larger electoral coalition was presented. Its name was The Union (&quot;L&#x27;Unione&quot;). It comprised the Federation of The Olive Tree, the Communist Refoundation Party (PRC), the Party of Italian Communists (PdCI), Italy of Values (IdV), the Federation of the Greens and other minor parties.

===Democratic Party===
The Democrats of the Left (DS), Democracy is Freedom – The Daisy (DL) and the European Republicans Movement (MRE) decided to form a joint electoral list for the 2006 Italian general election. Also the Italian Democratic Socialist Party (a different party from SDI) and The Italian Socialists had candidates in the list. The Italian Democratic Socialists (SDI), which were part of the federation and fight the 2004 European and the 2005 regional elections within it, decided not to take part of the joint electoral list for the 2006 general election and, otherwise, to form a common list with the Italian Radicals called Rose in the Fist within The Union coalition.

DS and DL were heavily involved in the foundation of a new unitary centre-left party, the Democratic Party, a project strongly supported by Romano Prodi since his entrance into politics in 1995. This party was founded on 14 October 2007 and Walter Veltroni was elected party leader by voters in an open primary.

<text>Salim Rubaya Ali (; 17 June 1934 – 26 June 1978), commonly known by his nickname Salemin (), was a Yemeni Maoist politician and revolutionary who served as the second head of state of the People&#x27;s Democratic Republic of Yemen (South Yemen) from 22 June 1969 until his execution on 26 June 1978.

Ali led the left-wing faction of the National Front for the Liberation of South Yemen (NLF), which forced the British to withdraw from southern Yemen on 29 November 1967. Ali&#x27;s radical Marxist faction gained dominance over the more moderate President Qahtan al-Shaabi&#x27;s elements, allowing Ali to seize power; he retained the title of Chairman of the Presidential Council throughout his term, even as the NLF changed the name of the country from the People&#x27;s Republic of South Yemen to the People&#x27;s Democratic Republic of Yemen in 1970. 

Ali&#x27;s National Front joined with other parties in 1975, creating the United Political Organisation NF (التنظيم السياسي الموحد الجبهة القومية), all rival parties having been outlawed earlier. He opposed the idea of the Yemeni Socialist Party&#x27;s (YSP) future creation promoted by Abdul Fattah Ismail. He appointed Muhammad Ali Haitham as his Prime Minister when he became chairman. Haitham served until August 1971, when he was replaced by Ali Nasir Muhammad. In 1978, the collective leadership of the YSP led by Abdul Fattah Ismail overthrew and executed Ali.

<text>Sir George Paget Thomson (; 3 May 189210 September 1975) was an English physicist who shared the 1937 Nobel Prize in Physics with Clinton Davisson for his discovery of the wave properties of the electron by electron diffraction.

==Education and early life==
Thomson was born in Cambridge, England, the son of physicist and Nobel laureate J. J. Thomson and Rose Elisabeth Paget, daughter of George Edward Paget. Thomson went to The Perse School, Cambridge before going on to read mathematics and physics at Trinity College, Cambridge, until the outbreak of World War I in 1914, when he was commissioned into the Queen&#x27;s Royal West Surrey Regiment. After brief service in France, he transferred to the Royal Flying Corps in 1915 to undertake research on aerodynamics at the Royal Aircraft Establishment at Farnborough and elsewhere. He resigned his commission as a captain in 1920.

==Career==
After the war, Thomson became a Fellow at Cambridge and then moved to the University of Aberdeen. He was jointly awarded the Nobel Prize for Physics in 1937 for his work at Aberdeen in discovering the wave-like properties of the electron. The prize was shared with the American physicist Clinton Davisson who had made the same discovery independently. Whereas Thomson’s father Joseph (who won the 1906 Nobel Prize) had seen the electron as a particle, the son demonstrated that the electron could be diffracted like a wave. By scattering electrons through thin metallic films (3 × 10−6 cm thick) with known crystal structures, such as aluminium, gold and platinum, Thomson found the dimensions of the observed diffraction patterns. In each case, his observed diffractions were within 5 per cent of the predicted values given by de Broglie&#x27;s wave theory. This discovery provided further evidence for the principle of wave–particle duality which had first been posited by Louis-Victor de Broglie in the 1920s as what is often dubbed the de Broglie hypothesis.

Between 1929 and 1930, Thomson was a Non-Resident Lecturer at Cornell University, Ithaca, New York. In 1930 he was appointed Professor at Imperial College London in the chair of the late Hugh Longbourne Callendar. In the late 1930s and during the Second World War, he specialised in nuclear physics, concentrating on practical military applications. In particular, he was the chairman of the crucial MAUD Committee in 1940–1941 that concluded that an atomic bomb was feasible. In later life he continued this work on nuclear energy but also wrote works on aerodynamics and the value of science in society.

Thomson stayed at Imperial College until 1952, when he became Master of Corpus Christi College, Cambridge. In 1964, the college honoured his tenure with the George Thomson Building, a work of modernist architecture on the college&#x27;s Leckhampton campus.

==Awards and honours==
In addition to winning the Nobel Prize in Physics, Thomson was knighted in 1943. He gave the address &quot;Two aspects of science&quot; as president of the British Association for 1959–1960.

==Personal life==
In 1924, Thomson married Kathleen Buchanan Smith, daughter of the Very Rev. Sir George Adam Smith, the Principal of the University of Aberdeen. They had two sons and two daughters. Kathleen died in 1941.

Thomson died on 10 September 1975, at Cambridge, aged 83, and is buried with his wife in Grantchester parish churchyard to the south of Cambridge.

One of their sons, Sir John Thomson (1927–2018), became a senior diplomat who served as High Commissioner to India (1977–82) and Permanent Representative to the United Nations (1982–87). Their grandson Sir Adam Thomson (born 1955) also became a senior diplomat, serving as High Commissioner to Pakistan (2010–2013) and as Permanent Representative to NATO (2014–2016). One daughter, Lillian Clare Thomson, married the South African economist and mountaineer Johannes de Villiers Graaff.

<text>Janice Rand is a fictional character in the American science fiction television series &quot;Star Trek: The Original Series&quot; during its first season, as well as three of the &quot;Star Trek&quot; films. She is the Captain&#x27;s yeoman on board the USS &quot;Enterprise&quot; (NCC-1701), and first appeared in the episode &quot;The Man Trap&quot;. She had significant roles in the episodes &quot;The Enemy Within&quot;, where she fights off an evil version of Captain James T. Kirk; &quot;Charlie X&quot; where a young man with god-like powers falls in love with her; and &quot;Miri&quot; where she is infected with a deadly disease while on an away mission and is kidnapped by jealous children.

Rand was portrayed by American actress Grace Lee Whitney, who had previously worked with &quot;Star Trek&quot; creator Gene Roddenberry in a pilot for a show he created called &quot;Police Story&quot;.

Whitney as Rand was involved in promoting &quot;Star Trek&quot; before it aired, but did not appear in the first two pilots. Roddenberry set out the role of Rand to Whitney, saying that she and Kirk were meant to have feelings for one another but should never act on them. Part way through the first season, Whitney was released from her contract. The official explanation was that the production team wanted to free up Kirk to have relationships with other women, but it was necessitated because of her substance abuse. It is unclear who suggested that her contract should be terminated or who made the final decision. Roddenberry later blamed NBC for her release and said he regretted it.

After Whitney was reintroduced to &quot;Star Trek&quot; through conventions, she came back into contact with Roddenberry, who wanted to include her in the new series in development at the time, &quot;Star Trek: Phase II&quot;. This was subsequently cancelled, but Rand did reappear in &quot;Star Trek: The Motion Picture&quot;. Whitney made further appearances as Rand in &quot;Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home&quot; and &quot;Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country&quot;, as well as scenes in the &quot;Star Trek: Voyager&quot; episode &quot;Flashback&quot; set during the events of the latter film. Whitney made further appearances as Rand in the fan series &quot;Star Trek: New Voyages&quot; and &quot;Star Trek: Of Gods and Men&quot;, and Rand was also portrayed by Meghan King Johnson in &quot;New Voyages&quot;.

Prior to the start of &quot;The Original Series&quot;, Whitney promoted the series and was popular with the media. Critics later called the character a stereotype in her initial appearances, but the expansion of the role in &quot;Flashback&quot; was praised.

==Concept and development==
Gene Roddenberry&#x27;s original pitch for &quot;Star Trek&quot; featured a female Captain&#x27;s Yeoman named &quot;Colt&quot;. She was described as &quot;blonde and with a shape that even a uniform could not hide.&quot; In this first version of &quot;Star Trek&quot;, she worked as Captain Robert April&#x27;s &quot;secretary, reporter, bookkeeper, and undoubtedly wishes she could serve him in more personal departments.&quot; Roddenberry&#x27;s description of her ended with &quot;She is not dumb; she is very female, disturbingly so.&quot; This character was cast for the first pilot of the series, &quot;The Cage&quot;, with Laurel Goodwin cast in that role. A similar character was created for the second pilot, &quot;Where No Man Has Gone Before&quot;, this time called &quot;Smith&quot;, and she was played by model Andrea Dromm.

However, during discussions with the casting director on &quot;Star Trek&quot;, Roddenberry stood up in the casting process for three women he had worked with before – Majel Barrett, Nichelle Nichols and Grace Lee Whitney. Whitney had previously appeared in Roddenberry&#x27;s unsold pilot &quot;Police Story&quot; where she played Police Lieutenant Lily Monroe. She was available to appear in the series and was promptly cast in the role, being paid $750 per episode and being guaranteed to appear in seven episodes out of the first thirteen. The casting led to rumours that she and Roddenberry had been previously involved romantically, something she strenuously denied later saying that &quot;I never had a romantic relationship with Gene Roddenberry before &quot;Star Trek&quot;, during &quot;Star Trek&quot;, or after &quot;Star Trek&quot;.&quot; She admitted that he had made numerous passes at her, but she wanted their relationship to remain professional only.

Roddenberry explained to Whitney that he wanted Rand to be Captain Kirk&#x27;s confidante but never wanted them to express their affection for one another; instead he wanted it to be played as an ongoing undercurrent. In the early publicity photos, Whitney was dressed in the same manner that the women had been in the two pilots – a loose gold colored tunic and black trousers. She complained to Roddenberry about them hiding her &quot;dancer&#x27;s legs&quot;, so he had William Ware Theiss design a short skirt and tunic for her to wear, a uniform which was adopted by the other female characters on the series. She said the outfit was &quot;sensational&quot; and that &quot;it stopped traffic&quot;. Despite the outfit being designed specifically for Whitney, Theiss was concerned and would tell her to lose weight. She was subsequently prescribed amphetamines by her doctor for the purpose of weight loss. Whitney stated that this was the start of her addiction to them, and in order to come down off them at night, she began drinking in the evening to take away the &quot;edginess&quot;.

He also developed her hair styles for the series, which Roddenberry insisted must be unique and futuristic so that the viewers could believe they were seeing the future on television. She originally appeared with straight hair in promotion photos, but this was changed to a beehive, which was so solid looking that Bob Justman joked that &quot;You could hit it with a sledgehammer and never make a dent.&quot; It was created by weaving two Max Factor wigs into a mesh cone. Whitney described the application of the wig, saying &quot;they nailed it to my head every morning.&quot; It was created by placing a cone on her head and then weaving the blonde hair from two separate wigs together resulting in such an unusual look that Whitney said she was unrecognizable without it. In the press, she explained that on the show, Rand would have stuck her head in a machine which would have made up her hair instantly. The wig was later stolen from the Desilu lot after Whitney was no longer on the series; it was never recovered.

When interviewed by the media at the time, Whitney expressed enthusiasm in the role and about science fiction in general. She described Rand&#x27;s role on board the &quot;Enterprise&quot; as &quot;She&#x27;s in charge of the other women aboard the space ship. She&#x27;s Miss Efficiency.&quot; She also added that the character did not go into space &quot;to catch a man.&quot; At the time, the media described Rand&#x27;s position on the &quot;Enterprise&quot; as &quot;chief female executive officer&quot; and her image was used to promote the series before it began to air. Whitney enjoyed several of the episodes she appeared in, and found it hard to choose between &quot;The Enemy Within&quot;, &quot;Charlie X&quot; and &quot;Miri&quot;.

She was particularly affectionate toward the latter because it allowed her to appear on camera with her two children, and said it was her favorite. Certain elements of Rand&#x27;s characterization were developed by Whitney and Shatner; Whitney would go to Shatner&#x27;s side when their characters were put in danger – in response, Shatner would put his arms around her, such as in &quot;Balance of Terror&quot;. The character was written out of the episode &quot;Dagger of the Mind&quot;, which Whitney attributed to the romantic liaison that Kirk has with the female lead in that episode being so overt that it would have caused issues for later plots. This was because the script had Kirk and the female lead sleep with each other. Although Whitney found it difficult to watch as her character had been removed from the episode, she understood why. Part of her outfit was dictated by attempting to increase the duties of the Captain&#x27;s Yeoman on screen. In order to provide support while part of an away team on a planet, Roddenberry suggested that she could wear a device on an over-the-shoulder strap which she could use as an electronic camera. He also suggested immediately that it could be expanded in order to be sold as a toy for young girls. This was part of the development process that led to the creation of the tricorder.

===Departure===
Grace Lee Whitney was released during the filming of the first season. The official reason given for Whitney&#x27;s departure from the show was that her character limited romantic possibilities for Captain Kirk. This idea was supported by Whitney, saying: &quot;They didn&#x27;t want to give the fans the idea [Kirk] was in love with Janice Rand. That would limit him. They wanted him to go out and fool around. So, I was axed.&quot;

But the real reason was that the production had financial issues, with the acquisition of new crew members and the increase in popularity of Doctor Leonard McCoy meaning that those salaries needed to come out of the original budget. In Justman and Herb Solow&#x27;s 1996 book &quot;Inside Star Trek&quot;, they stated that following a discussion between Roddenberry, Solow and Bernie Weitzman in which they discussed her contract, they decided to terminate it because of Whitney&#x27;s limited appearances and the financial issues that the series was having. The decision was attributed elsewhere in David Alexander&#x27;s 1995 authorized biography of Gene Roddenberry, &quot;Star Trek Creator&quot;, which said that during the first batch of episodes, casting director Joseph D&#x27;Agosta reviewed the contracts for the main actors due to rising costs.

At the time Whitney was guaranteed to appear in seven of the first 13 episodes, and contracted for four days work on each. However, she was used for nine additional days, leading D&#x27;Agosta to suggest to Roddenberry that if guest stars instead played the similar role but with different characters then they &quot;would cost less and hold as much value&quot;. He added that they should instead look to using Whitney on a free-lance basis instead of under permanent contract. By September 8, 1966, Whitney&#x27;s agent had been informed that her contract had been terminated, which was around a week prior to the shoot of her penultimate episode, &quot;The Conscience of the King&quot;. Roddenberry told Whitney that he did not want to lose Rand as he wanted her relationship with Kirk to continue. In a memo to Gene Coon on October 27, 1966, Roddenberry suggested bringing Whitney back as Rand, albeit with a different hairstyle similar to the way she wore it in &quot;Police Story&quot; as this &quot;made her look much younger and softer&quot;, but she was never invited back to the series.

Because of Whitney&#x27;s termination, drafts of the episode &quot;The Galileo Seven&quot; were revised to replace Rand with a new yeoman, Mears. Writer Paul Schneider was not informed of Whitney&#x27;s departure when he submitted his first draft of &quot;The Squire of Gothos&quot; in early October 1966, so another character, Yeoman Ross, was then subsequently created for that episode. And Robert Hamner&#x27;s September 1966 outlines for &quot;A Taste of Armageddon&quot; also included Rand; that part was then given to another new character, Tamura.

In Solow and Justman&#x27;s book, there was also a reference to a &quot;rift&quot; between Whitney and Roddenberry that occurred just prior to her departure and was expected to ensure that she never returned to the series. In her autobiography, Whitney states that an unnamed television executive sexually assaulted her on August 26, 1966, while working on the episode &quot;Miri&quot;, and she draws a link between this and her sacking a few days later. Whitney&#x27;s departure was around the time when she was an alcoholic. In an interview in 1988, Whitney blamed her alcoholism and anorexia at the time for being released by the series. She later explained in an interview with &quot;Starlog&quot; magazine to promote &quot;Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home&quot;, that due to being adopted, she had a fear of rejection when she was younger which stemmed from her mother giving her away, and linked this to &quot;Star Trek&quot; saying &quot;when I was let go from &quot;Star Trek&quot;, it was a psychic pain which pushed me into alcoholism. I couldn&#x27;t stand the pain, so I drank to get away from it.&quot;

===Return===

Whitney returned to the set on several occasions during the production of the series, and was also invited to come back for cast parties. But over time these visits decreased gradually as she found it painful to be on set with her friends, but not able to appear on the show. She was continuing to take amphetamines and had developed a drinking problem. Despite this, and despite Whitney being let go from the show, Harlan Ellison wrote the character into his original script for &quot;The City on the Edge of Forever&quot;. Roddenberry rewrote the script, resulting in a feud between the writers – but the writer was also very disappointed in general that Rand had been removed from the series. After Whitney had left &quot;Star Trek&quot;, she dated Ellison for a time.

Whitney had no further involvement with &quot;Star Trek&quot; until 1976, when she happened to meet DeForest Kelley at an unemployment office in Van Nuys, Los Angeles. He informed her about a &quot;Star Trek&quot; convention coming up that was organised by Bjo and John Trimble called Equicon. She received such a reception upon making an appearance there that she was inspired to think more about the series and wanted to appear at more events. In 1977, after reading the back cover of the book &quot;Letters to Star Trek&quot; by Susan Sackett and finding that &quot;Whatever happened to Grace Lee Whitney?&quot; was one of the ten most frequently asked queries, Whitney got in touch with Sackett and was invited to meet at Roddenberry&#x27;s office at Paramount. When he entered, he was happy and excited to see her and immediately offered to bring back Rand for the new television series &quot;Star Trek: Phase II&quot;. Roddenberry told her that removing Rand was the biggest mistake he had made, saying that the character should have stayed so that &quot;when Captain Kirk came back from having affairs with all these other women on all these other planets – he&#x27;d have to deal with [Rand]. What a great plot-thickener that would have been!&quot; Instead, he blamed the decision on executives at NBC, but apologized for it to Whitney.

When &quot;Phase II&quot; was discussed in the media, the return of Whitney as Rand was one of the things highlighted. Two weeks before the series was about to shoot, it was cancelled by Paramount executives. Instead there was going to be a film. Whitney returned for &quot;Star Trek: The Motion Picture&quot;, with Roddenberry bringing her back as Rand who was now the transporter chief on board the &quot;Enterprise&quot;. The film reunited the entire main cast of &quot;Star Trek&quot;. She did not appear in &quot;Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan&quot;, and was not in the script for &quot;Star Trek III: The Search for Spock&quot;. But for the latter film, Nimoy, who was directing the movie, gave Whitney a cameo as another character who was looking out of a window in spacedock watching the return of the damaged &quot;Enterprise&quot; at the start of the production. As he was also directing &quot;The Voyage Home&quot;, he was looking to give Whitney a larger role. By this time, she had hoped that Rand had moved over to become a counselor – an idea originally suggested by a fan. Alongside Majel Barrett as Christine Chapel, the duo were given four pages of dialogue initially which was trimmed down to one scene in the final film. Following the reappearance, Whitney was enthusiastic about returning as Rand, saying &quot;I think Janice Rand is going to be around for a long time, as long as they don&#x27;t kill our characters off, we have a chance of constantly coming back.&quot;

After a further appearance as Rand in &quot;Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country&quot;, Whitney returned for a final official appearance in the &quot;Star Trek: Voyager&quot; episode &quot;Flashback&quot;. She praised the &quot;incredible experience&quot; and enjoyed working with Kate Mulgrew and Tim Russ. Following the appearance in &quot;Voyager&quot;, Whitney was supportive of a new &quot;Star Trek&quot; series focused on the adventures of the &quot;Excelsior&quot; with Rand appearing once more alongside George Takei as Captain Hikaru Sulu.

Following the relaunch of &quot;Star Trek&quot; in 2009 with a new cast playing those roles seen in &quot;The Original Series&quot;, there was commentary online about the lack of female characters and whether Rand might be appearing in future installments. While the sequel, &quot;Star Trek Into Darkness&quot;, was in production, Rand was one of five characters who was stated not to be appearing in the film by writer Roberto Orci. But there was still speculation at the time of the broadcast of the first trailer about who Alice Eve was portraying in the film. The options given by Tor.com was that it was either Janice Rand or Carol Marcus. &quot;Daily Variety&quot; reported that she was cast as someone new to the franchise, but she was actually cast as Marcus.

==Appearances==
Rand&#x27;s first filmed appearance is in the episode &quot;The Corbomite Maneuver&quot;, wherein Captain James T. Kirk is annoyed that he has been assigned a pretty female yeoman and discusses this with McCoy. After Kirk is split into two beings in &quot;The Enemy Within&quot;, the evil version of the Captain heads to Rand&#x27;s quarters and reveals his attraction to her. He kisses her forcefully, but she fights back and scratches him across the face. Crewman Fisher intervenes and fights him off – the duo later explain that it was Kirk who attacked her to a surprised good version of the Captain, along with Spock and Doctor McCoy. In &quot;The Man Trap&quot;, she becomes friends with Sulu while refusing the advances of Crewman Green. Kirk admits his feelings for Rand while under the influence of an affliction in &quot;The Naked Time&quot;.

When Charlie Evans is brought on board the &quot;Enterprise&quot; in the episode &quot;Charlie X&quot;, he falls for Rand. She is older than the adolescent boy and attempts to dissuade his affections by introducing him to Yeoman Tina Lawton. But he declares his feelings for Rand. Concerned, Rand seeks the advice of the Captain who intervenes and involves Evans in some sparring practice. After he falls over, he reveals his powers to make people disappear when one of the other sparring partners laughs at him. Charlie takes control of the ship, and goes to Rand&#x27;s quarters with a rose. She refuses his approach; Spock and Kirk arrive but Charlie attacks them, and Rand slaps the boy. In response, he makes her vanish. It is only after a Thasian vessel appears that the &quot;Enterprise&quot; and Rand are returned to normal, as Charlie is taken away by the aliens.

Rand joins the landing party in the episode &quot;Miri&quot;, and is infected by the disease that wiped out all of the adults on the planet. She finds comfort in the arms of Kirk, causing Miri to become jealous and the girl kidnaps the Yeoman to attract the attention of the Captain. Kirk convinces Miri to take him to Rand, but the other children attack him. They realise what they&#x27;re doing is wrong and allow Kirk and Rand to return to the rest of the landing party – where McCoy has synthesized a cure for the disease. Rand&#x27;s second to last appearance in &quot;The Original Series&quot; was in &quot;The Conscience of the King&quot;, where she has no lines but shoots a jealous look at a woman Kirk is attracted to. Her final appearance in the original TV series was on the episode Balance of Terror.

She next appeared in the 1979 film &quot;Star Trek: The Motion Picture&quot; as the chief transporter operator and non-commissioned officer on board the &quot;Enterprise&quot;. During the events of &quot;The Voyage Home&quot;, Rand was stationed in San Francisco as a communications officer, but was reunited with the other former members of the &quot;Enterprise&quot; when they are court-martialed at the end of the film. She subsequently served as a communications officer aboard the USS &quot;Excelsior&quot; during the events of &quot;The Undiscovered Country&quot;. The character&#x27;s final appearance on screen was as part of Tuvok&#x27;s memories of the events of that final film, as part of the &quot;Voyager&quot; episode &quot;Flashback&quot;. Afterwards, Whitney remained hopeful that a new Captain Sulu based series would be created, allowing her to return to the role of Rand once more.

===Non-canon appearances===
Whitney made a further two appearances in &quot;Star Trek&quot; fan productions as Rand. These included the &quot;Star Trek: New Voyages&quot; episode &quot;World Enough and Time&quot;, where Rand was once again on the bridge of the &quot;Excelsior&quot; alongside Takei&#x27;s Sulu. Despite being fan produced, the episode was nominated for the Hugo Award for Best Dramatic Presentation. She also returned as Rand in the film &quot;Star Trek: Of Gods and Men&quot;. It was directed by Tim Russ, who she had worked with on &quot;Voyager&quot;, and featured a number of other former &quot;Star Trek&quot; actors. It was produced in association with &quot;New Voyages&quot;.

Rand was also portrayed by Meghan King Johnson in &quot;New Voyages&quot;. She was initially going to work on a film with producer Jack Marshall, but when that fell through, he suggested she worked on the &quot;Star Trek&quot; production. Johnson was first hired to portray Christine Chapel, with Andrea Ajemian playing Rand. However, Ajemian was re-cast to play Onabi in the pilot &quot;Come What May&quot;, Johnson was moved to play Rand and Shannon Giles recruited to play Chapel. Johnson said that highlights of the role included taking the conn in the pilot, and later working around her pregnancy in the episode &quot;In Harm&#x27;s Way&quot;.

In print media, Vonda N. McIntyre&#x27;s non-canon novel &quot;&quot; expanded on Rand&#x27;s early history saying that she was originally a refugee, before being sold into slavery and enlisting in Starfleet. But in order to do so, she also had to lie about her age. Once on the &quot;Enterprise&quot;, she is teased by her new colleagues until her friendship with Uhura helps her to settle in and become the Yeoman that appeared on the television series. During the production of &quot;The Original Series&quot;, Janice Rand still appeared in the first draft of the script for the episode &quot;The Galileo Seven&quot;, but was replaced by Yeoman Mears in later versions. When the comic book series by IDW Publishing based on the 2009 film revisited the events of that episode, this was changed to allow Rand to appear.

==Reception and commentary==
In the initial previews for &quot;Star Trek&quot; when reporting on Rand, the media discussed Whitney&#x27;s looks. The &quot;Independent Press-Telegram&quot; went as far as printing her bust/waist/hip measurements. Other newspapers were also complimentary of how Whitney looked, calling her attractive and shapely. Whitney said that she was popular with the media at the time because she was &quot;very glib and very eager&quot;, but felt that she may have been seen to be overshadowing other members of the cast with her appearances. Her hairstyle was placed fifth in a list of unforgettable hairstyles in science fiction on Tor.com. It was suggested that when &quot;you think of the 60s and science fiction hairstyles, the first image is probably Rand&#x27;s beehive hair&quot;.

Rand&#x27;s role is described within Terry J. Erdmann and Paula M. Block&#x27;s &quot;Star Trek 101&quot; as attending to Kirk, and bringing him reports, meals and coffee as well as having developed a crush on him. Jan Johnson-Smith, in her book &quot;American Science Fiction TV: Star Trek, Stargate and Beyond&quot;, said that Rand was one of a number of &quot;recognisable stereotypes&quot; of women who appeared in &quot;Star Trek&quot;. This was despite an initially progressive agenda towards women in authority by the appearance of Number One in &quot;The Cage&quot;, which was rejected by NBC. Johnson-Smith described Rand&#x27;s position as being a typical example of a female character who was only intended to be a romantic interest for a male lead.

Zack Handlen, while writing for &quot;The A.V. Club&quot; in 2009, said that Whitney was a &quot;competent actress&quot;, but that Rand &quot;represents some of &quot;Trek&quot;″s most egregious offenses against feminism&quot;. He criticized her role within the show, and specifically in &quot;Charlie X&quot; when Charlie slaps her bottom and none of the characters can explain why he should not do that. Michelle Erica Green praised the &quot;substantial&quot; role given to Rand in &quot;Flashback&quot; while writing for TrekNation, adding that this was the first time such a role had been given to the character in the franchise. However, she criticized Rand&#x27;s being written out part way through the episode as she felt that the character could have had more to contribute to the plot.

In 2015, SyFy rated Yeoman Rand as among the top 21 most interesting supporting characters of &quot;Star Trek&quot;. In 2019, she was listed as one of the underrated characters of the &quot;Star Trek&quot; universe by CBS.

<doc id="725923" wikidata="Q2934727" url="?curid=725923" title="Hydration system">
<text>A hydration system is an apparatus used in recreation and other sustained outdoor activities. It is intended to help its user carry liquid, to support the physical effort involved in the activity, without the need to use one&#x27;s hands or take off the pack. Such systems for consumers were first sold to cyclists, and by the 1990s had also found a substantial market among hikers. Familiar commercial models can also be recognized occasionally worn by western military personnel in southwest Asia.

In practice, such a system is almost always a commercially manufactured unit that features at least
* a flexible bladder of one or a few liters&#x27; (quarts&#x27;) capacity with some means, usually a screwtop, to fill and then reliably seal it,
* a light hose to convey the beverage to the user&#x27;s mouth, and
* a bite valve that starts and stops the flow through the hose with minimal effort.
Also common are designs that include specific hands-free means to comfortably carry the hydration system.

== History ==
The plastic bladders from box wine were repurposed as an inexpensive way to store water when hiking in Australia in the late 1960s but were prone to breakage and leakage. Hydration systems first appeared commercially in the late 1980s or early 1990s, at backpacking stores. They were adopted by US special operations troops in the early 1990s, and became standard issue for all US troops in the later 1990s.
The concept of the hydration system appeared in Robert A. Heinlein&#x27;s 1955 novel, &quot;Tunnel in the Sky&quot;, where the main character has &quot;a belt canteen of flexible synthetic divided into half-liter pockets. The weight was taken by shoulder straps and a tube ran up the left suspender, ending in a nipple near his mouth, so that he might drink without taking it off.&quot;

== Hardware ==

=== Bladder designs ===
The overall geometry of the bladder is nearly universal:
* The largest dimension is the vertical one, taking advantage of the long vertical dimension of the human torso.
* The hose joins the bladder very near the bottom of the bladder, to maximize the amount of accessible liquid.
* The bladder&#x27;s change in volume as it is gradually emptied is reflected in the decrease of its smallest dimension (); this lets the vertical and side-to-side dimensions stay fixed, thereby limiting the shifting of it and any items next to it, and minimizes the flexing of the bladder walls.

=== Packaging ===
Typical commercial hydration systems are available with three fundamental approaches:
* A &quot;bare bladder&quot;, intended to be carried in a matching pocket of a &quot;hydration-system compatible&quot; backpack. (Such a pack will usually also feature a hole through the pack, near the upper anchoring point of the pack&#x27;s shoulder straps, sized for the hose and bite valve to pass through it, and often covered by a flap that prevents rain entering the pack through it.)
* As part of an integrated design incorporating both a backpack and the hydration system (usually sold together as a hydration pack), usually with at least a few pockets-worth of storage space for other items. (Such a combination is likely to have a channel inside one or both shoulder straps, for the hose to pass through, preventing the hose from tangling with other gear or the environment, and ameliorating the annoyance of the liquid warming up while waiting in the hose to be drunk next, or the problem of it freezing.)
* A basic hydration system in a protective fabric shell, so that the bladder is unlikely to be damaged by other gear that it shares the interior of an ordinary pack with. (The CamelBak brand products of this kind are trademarked as &quot;The Unbottle&quot;, for instance, and each looks a lot like a very small pack, with a hand-carrying strap at the top and four D-rings that could facilitate attaching it to the outside of a pack. However, they completely lack shoulder or waist straps.)

=== Accessories ===
Some manufacturers offer parts for replacement or customization, whether compatible only with their own hydration systems, or usable also with others&#x27;.

=== Plumbing ===

====Shut-off valves====
Especially while a hydration system is being carried in a vehicle, there is some danger of the bite valve being squeezed, opening it to leakage or a steady flow; this can be guarded against with an additional valve, usually installed between the bite valve and the hose, that stays open or closed according to the position of a lever.

====Elbows====
The bite valve may be installed with a right-angle extension between it and the hose, to achieve a preferred positioning and angle of the valve relative to the user&#x27;s mouth.

====Hose anchors====
Position and angle may also be adjusted by clips that clip usually to a pack strap and (for instance by clipping to the hose, or looping around it and snapping to themselves to close the loop) control the hose&#x27;s path

=== Insulation ===

====Hose====
Plastic foam surrounding the hose can be used to reduce heat transfer between the environment and liquid in the hose: keeping a cold liquid cool longer in summer and slows a liquid freezing in winter.

====Bite valve====
At least one manufacturer offers a tethered, slip-off, foam cowl that slows freezing of the liquid in the bite valve, and also reduces contamination of the bite valve.

===Filters===
At least one manufacturer, MSR, offers a in-line ceramic based filter, allowing use of local water supplies for refill. Ceramic filters can be cleaned at home by back flushing with clean water so no replacements are needed.

=== Between fillings ===

====Scrubbing systems====
Sets of cylindrical brushes (e.g., a large one for the inside of the bladder, and a thin one with a flexible handle long enough to run at least halfway through the hose) permit mechanical removal of biofilm that will grow on the surface inside the system.

====Drying systems====
Means of holding the bladder walls apart to encourage drying between uses are available, such as a plastic frame that collapses to pass through the fill opening, but expands inside the bladder to hold the sides apart even near the corners.

== Techniques ==
Various specialized practices may be applied in using a hydration system.

* Depending on the size of the opening for filling the bladder, it may be convenient to include, in hot weather, ice cubes or crushed ice when filling it. In theory too much ice means running out of liquid water while the bladder still has ice occupying space that could have been filled by more water (so it helps to take account of how temperature and humidity affect the balance between consumption rate and melting rate), but it helps that most people&#x27;s tendency seems to be to put in less ice than would last through the hike.
* The use of liquids that provide calories (usually in combination with flavoring and perhaps rehydration salts) increases the cleaning burden by nourishing bacteria, and if the user neglects to empty and rinse the bladder, judging the cleanliness of the bladder at a later date involves more effort than with containers that are more transparent and in some cases more accessible. Some users carry plain water, with or without ice, in a bladder, but drink something else from Nalgene-style bottles during rests.
* On trips over a day, or in especially hot conditions, need for more water than is carried may require purification of local water.
** Attention to mechanical compatibility of a filtration system with the bladder, or with a Nalgene-style bottle that may be carried to fill the bladder, can be worthwhile.
** Use of chemical purification systems raises issues both of staining of the bladder and the possibility of weakening its material. Besides the aesthetic discomfort of drinking from a perfectly sterile but &quot;dirty looking&quot; bladder, staining can also interfere with judging later the cleanliness of a bladder.
* Another way to ensure the bladder does not start a breakout of microbes is to let out as much water as possible from it, and freeze it as soon as possible. This technique makes use of the property that microbes cannot propagate under freezing conditions.

===Clearing the hose between drinks===
Two views exist on the practice of blowing air back through the bite valve, to force the liquid out of the hose and back into the bladder.
* Advocates point out that liquid in the hose (where it is all within of the air) warms or cools relatively rapidly toward the ambient temperature, and value the reduction of this when nearly all the liquid is in the bladder. There it is as much as several inches (10 cm) from the bladder surface, and it may be still further insulated by a pack and its other contents. When the air temperature is below freezing if the hose isn&#x27;t cleared it can rapidly freeze blocking the hose. This often occurs skiing where high wind speed and low temperatures are combined.
* Detractors believe that blowing into the hose increases the amount of bacteria inside the bladder, and requires more frequent scrubbing to keep the flavor and odor of the contents acceptable.
* Because the hose attaches to the bottom of the bladder, in order to let the last of the liquid into the hose, air that reaches the opening bubbles to the top of the bladder, and is trapped there until the liquid is nearly drained. Each time more air is blown into the bladder than the amount of liquid contained inside the hose, the pressure inside the bladder increases, and the more effort blowing back involves. Therefore, the technique profits from enough attention to develop a sense of when the hose is nearly full of air.

<text>Una Chin-Riley, commonly and originally only known as Number One, is a fictional character in the science-fiction franchise &quot;Star Trek&quot;. She is Christopher Pike&#x27;s second-in-command during his captaincy of the starship &quot;Enterprise&quot;.

She first appeared, portrayed by Majel Barrett in &quot;The Cage&quot;, the initial 1965 pilot episode of the original series. The pilot was rejected and most of its characters, including Number One, were omitted from the second pilot and the subsequent series (the relationship between Spock and Kirk would emulate that of Number One and Pike). Footage from &quot;The Cage&quot; featuring the character was reused in the two-part story &quot;The Menagerie&quot; in 1966, establishing Pike and Number One as members of a previous crew of the &quot;Enterprise&quot; and part of the &quot;Star Trek&quot; canon; Barrett herself, who would become the wife of &quot;Star Trek&quot; creator Gene Roddenberry, would portray a number of unrelated characters in the franchise from 1966 to 2009, such as Nurse Christine Chapel in the original series, Lwaxana Troi in Star Trek: The Next Generation, and the voice of the &quot;Enterprise&quot; computer for both series.

In 2019, the second season of &quot;Star Trek: Discovery&quot;, set during Pike&#x27;s tenure as captain of the &quot;Enterprise&quot;, featured Number One&#x27;s first on-screen appearance in 53 years, now played by Rebecca Romijn. Romijn reprised her role in two episodes of &quot;Star Trek: Short Treks&quot; the same year, and, beginning in 2022, as a series regular in &quot;Star Trek: Strange New Worlds&quot;, which is centered on the adventures of Pike&#x27;s crew.

==Appearances==

The character debuted in &quot;The Menagerie&quot; in 1966, and also in &quot;The Cage&quot;, which was not broadcast until 1988. The character was not seen in live-action &quot;Star Trek&quot; again until 2019, when she was made a recurring character in the second season of the CBS All Access web series &quot;Star Trek: Discovery&quot;.

Although not shown on-screen, it is implied that Number One briefly takes command of the &quot;Enterprise&quot; when Captain Pike and his landing party first beam down to Talos IV. She later beams down to the planet several times herself. During &quot;The Cage&quot;, Number One proves to her alien captors that humans would rather die than be slaves.

Her official biography notes that she is secretly attracted to Pike.

Number One appears in three episodes of the second season of &quot;Star Trek: Discovery&quot;, starting with the episode &quot;An Obol for Charon&quot;, where she visits Pike on the USS &quot;Discovery&quot;. She briefs Pike on the repairs being made to the &quot;Enterprise&quot; and also provides him with information regarding the whereabouts of Lieutenant Spock. Number One is said to be a very resourceful individual (Pike wryly points out that &quot;people have a tendency to end up owing her favors&quot;) and has a predilection for spicy food – in the mess hall scene with Pike, she orders a cheeseburger with habanero sauce.

The second-season finale of &quot;Discovery&quot;, &quot;Such Sweet Sorrow&quot;, reveals that the character&#x27;s first name is Una, while the third episode of &quot;Strange New Worlds&quot;, &quot;Ghosts of Illyria&quot;, gives the character&#x27;s full name as &quot;Una Chin-Riley&quot;, and reveals that she is Illyrian rather than Human. &quot;Una&quot; is an Irish name, perhaps derived from a word meaning &#x27;lamb&#x27;; the word &quot;una&quot; also means &#x27;one&#x27; in Latin, and &#x27;first&#x27; in Tagalog.

Number One appears in two installments of the series of short films &quot;Star Trek: Short Treks&quot;.

==Controversy==
During the development of the first pilot for &quot;Star Trek: The Original Series&quot; (&quot;The Cage&quot;), Roddenberry wrote the part of Number One specifically for Barrett. There was reluctance from the NBC executives to agree to an actress who was almost unknown. Roddenberry did see other actresses for the part, but no one else was considered.

According to Gene Roddenberry and Stephen Whitfield, the prominence of a woman among the crew of a starship was one of the reasons the original &quot;Star Trek&quot; pilot was rejected by NBC, who, in addition to calling the pilot &quot;too cerebral,&quot; felt the alien Spock and a female senior officer would be rejected by audiences. Roddenberry related the tale of how women of the era had difficulty accepting her as well. Executive producer Herb Solow attempted to sell NBC executives on the idea that a fresh face would bring believability to the part, but they were aware that she was Roddenberry&#x27;s girlfriend. Despite this, they agreed to her casting, not wanting to upset Roddenberry at this point in the production. After the pilot was rejected, a second pilot was produced. While it was generally explained that the network disliked a female character as the second-in-command of the &quot;Enterprise&quot;, Solow had a different opinion of events; he explained, &quot;no one liked her acting... she was a nice woman, but the reality was, she couldn&#x27;t act.&quot; In his book &quot;Inside Star Trek: The Real Story&quot;, Solow suggests the network had no problem with the character, but was infuriated when a relatively unknown actress was cast simply because she was having an affair with Roddenberry. Because of NBC&#x27;s rare order of a second pilot, Roddenberry compromised by eliminating Number One, but aspects of her character—specifically, her cool demeanor and logical nature—were merged into Spock (who does appear in &quot;The Cage&quot;) during the regular run of the series.

==Influence==
On the series &quot;Star Trek: The Next Generation&quot;, Commander William Riker is usually (and informally) called &quot;Number One&quot; by Captain Picard, because of his position as first officer on the USS &quot;Enterprise&quot;. On the series &quot;Star Trek: Discovery&quot;, set in 2256 (two years after the events of &quot;The Cage&quot;), female Commander Michael Burnham is referred to as &quot;Number One&quot; by Captain Georgiou, because of her position as first officer on the USS &quot;Shenzhou&quot;. Series creator Bryan Fuller had originally intended only to refer to the character as Number One, in honor of Majel Barrett&#x27;s character, but the name Burnham was instead revealed during the first episode. In &quot;Star Trek: Picard&quot;, retired Admiral Picard owns a pit bull called &quot;Number One&quot;.

Number One was first referred to as &quot;Una&quot; in the non-canonical 2016 novel trilogy &quot;Star Trek: Legacies&quot;, which was published by Pocket Books to mark the original series&#x27;s 50th anniversary. Authors Greg Cox, David Mack, Dayton Ward, and Kevin Dilmore gave her a first name because she had a central role in the novels. It has been suggested through several sources that this was done in honor of fellow &quot;Star Trek&quot; author Una McCormack. The name &#x27;Una&#x27; became canon with its use in &quot;Star Trek: Discovery&#x27;s &quot;second season finale.

==Reception==
Barrett&#x27;s role as Number One in the first pilot led to her being cast as Nurse Chapel in the original &quot;Star Trek&quot; television series. Much of &quot;The Cage&quot; pilot footage, including scenes with Barrett as Number One, was incorporated in the 1966 episode &quot;The Menagerie&quot;. In 2017, Space.com ranked &quot;The Menagerie&quot; the third best episode of all &quot;Star Trek&quot; television. &quot;The Cage&quot; was supplied to NBC in 1965, but it was not released on VHS until 1986, and not broadcast until 1988. Accordingly, &quot;The Menagerie&quot; was the first public broadcast of this character on television.

In 2016, Number One was ranked as the 57th most important character in Starfleet within the &quot;Star Trek&quot; science fiction universe by &quot;Wired&quot;, out of 100 characters.

In 2017, &quot;CBR&quot; ranked Number One the ninth &quot;fiercest&quot; female character of the &quot;Star Trek&quot; universe.

In 2018, actress Rebecca Romijn was cast as the character Number One for &quot;Star Trek: Discovery&quot; season 2, and said that she was &quot;honored to play such an iconic character.&quot; Romijn&#x27;s performance was met with positive reception. The producers announced plans to bring back Romijn as Number One for two episodes &quot;Star Trek: Short Treks&quot; and subsequently as a main character on &quot;Star Trek: Strange New Worlds&quot;.

<doc id="725929" wikidata="Q1131978" url="?curid=725929" title="Lucania">
<text>Lucania was a historical region of Southern Italy, corresponding to the modern-day region of Basilicata. It was the land of the Lucani, an Oscan people. It extended from the Tyrrhenian Sea to the Gulf of Taranto. It bordered with Samnium and Campania in the north, Apulia in the east, and Bruttium in the south-west, and was at the tip of the peninsula which is now called Calabria. It comprised almost all the modern region of Basilicata, the southern part of the Province of Salerno (the Cilento area), the western part of Province of Taranto and a northern portion of the Province of Cosenza. 

The precise limits were the river Silarus in the north-west, which separated it from Campania, and the Gravina (river) which flows into the Gulf of Taranto in the east. The lower tract of the river Laus, which flows from a ridge of the Apennine Mountains to the Tyrrhenian Sea in an east-west direction, marked part of the border with Bruttium.

==Geography==
Almost the whole area is occupied by the Apennine Mountains, which here are an irregular group of lofty masses. The main ridge approaches the western sea and continues from the lofty knot of mountains on the frontiers of Samnium, in a mostly southerly direction, to within a few miles of the Gulf of Policastro. From then on it is separated from the sea by only a narrow interval until it enters Bruttium. 

Just within the frontier of Lucania rises Monte Pollino, , the highest peak in the southern Apennines. The mountains descend in a much more gradual slope to the coastal plain of the Gulf of Taranto. Thus the rivers which flow to the Tyrrhenian Sea are of little importance compared with those that descend towards the Gulf of Tarentum. Of these the most important are the Bradanus (Bradano), the Casuentus (Basento), the Aciris (Agri), and the Siris (Sinni). 

The Crathis, which forms at its mouth the southern limit of the province, belongs almost wholly to the territory of the Bruttii, but it receives a tributary, the Sybaris (Coscile), from the mountains of Lucania. The only considerable stream on the western side is the Silarus (Sele), which constitutes the northern boundary, and has two important tributaries in the Calor (Calore Lucano or Calore Salernitano) and the Tanager (Tanagro or Negro) which joins it from the south.

==Etymology==
Historians at University of Naples Eastern Studies concluded that the root of the name Lucania is derived from &quot;luc&quot;, the Osco-Sabellic peoples word for light, which has the same meaning in the Latin idiom. The people that moved from the Osco-Sabellic tribes to occupy the land east of the Sillaro River, which was an area associated with the morning star, Lucifer (Latin for bringer of light). Therefore, Lucania means eastern land or land from which there is light. The study also explains why it is not Greek in origin. As noted in the History section on this page, the Greeks referred to this region of Italy as Oenotria.

==History==

===Antiquity===

The district of Lucania was so called from the people bearing the name Lucani (Lucanians) by whom it was conquered about the middle of the 5th century BC. Before that period it was included under the general name of Oenotria, which was applied by the Greeks to the southernmost portion of Italy. 

The mountainous interior was occupied by the tribes known as Oenotrians and Choni, while the coasts on both sides were occupied by powerful Greek colonies which doubtless exercised a protectorate over the interior (see Magna Graecia). The Lucanians were a southern branch of the Samnite or Sabellic people, who spoke the Oscan language. They had a democratic constitution save in time of war, when a dictator was chosen from among the regular magistrates. 

A few Oscan inscriptions survive, mostly in Greek characters from the 4th or 3rd century BC, and some coins with Oscan legends of the 3rd century. The Lucanians gradually conquered the whole country (with the exception of the Greek towns on the coast) from the borders of Samnium and Campania to the southern extremity of Italy. Subsequently the inhabitants of the peninsula, now known as Calabria, broke into insurrection, and under the name of Bruttians established their independence, after which the Lucanians became confined within the limits already described. 

After this we find them engaged in hostilities with the Tarentines, and with Alexander, king of Epirus, who was called in by that people to their assistance, 334 BC. In 298 BC (Livy x. II seq.) they made alliance with Rome, and Roman influence was extended by the colonies of Venusia (291 BC), Paestum (273), and above all Tarentum (272). 

Subsequently they were sometimes in alliance, but more frequently engaged in hostilities, during the Samnite wars. On the landing of Pyrrhus in Italy (281 BC) they were among the first to declare in his favor, and found themselves exposed to the resentment of Rome when the departure of Pyrrhus left his allies at the mercy of the Romans. After several campaigns they were reduced to subjection (272 BC). Notwithstanding this they espoused the cause of Hannibal during the Second Punic War (216 BC), and their territory during several campaigns was ravaged by both armies. The country never recovered from these disasters, and under the Roman government fell into decay, to which the Social War, in which the Lucanians took part with the Samnites against Rome (90–88 BC) gave the finishing stroke. 

In the time of Strabo the Greek cities on the coast had fallen into insignificance, and owing to the decrease of population and cultivation malaria began to obtain the upper hand. The few towns of the interior were of no importance. A large part of the province was given up to pasture, and the mountains were covered with forests, which abounded in wild boars, bears and wolves. There were some fifteen independent communities, but none of great importance.

For administrative purposes under the Roman Empire, Lucania was always united with the district of the Bruttii, a practice continued by Theodoric. The two together constituted the third region of Augustus.

===Middle Ages===

After the fall of the Western Roman Empire in 476 CE, Lucania fell to Odoacer and became part of the Kingdom of Italy before being turned into the Kingdom of the Ostrogoths in 493 CE. Ostrogothic rule in the region was short lived due to Justinian’s reconquest of Italy in the mid-Sixth century. The Byzantine conquest reintroduced Greeks and Greek culture to the region.
In the early 7th, Byzantine rule was cut short as another Germanic people, the Lombards conquered Lucania from the Byzantines and became part of the Kingdom of the Lombards. In 774, after the Frankish invasion, Lucania became a part of the independent Duchy of Benevento and later, under Holy Roman Emperor Louis II, part of the Duchy was turned into the independent Principality of Salerno in 851.

In the late 10th century the Byzantines began to re-enter the region of Lucania forming the Catapanate of Italy with Salerno being granted autonomy. By the early 11th century the Byzantine revival in Lucania came with both a process of Hellenization and significant Greek migrations from southern and central Calabria and Salento, into regions such as Cilento. Lucania would remain largely Greek till the 12th century when a gradual process of Latinization would occur. By the 14th century, there were few Greek inhabitants as the majority had been assimilated.

In the mid-11th century, Lucania was conquered by the Normans first becoming the County of Apulia and Calabria then becoming part of the Kingdom of Sicily in 1130. In 1194, Lucania would become part of the Holy Roman Empire under the Hohenstaufen dynasty. After that the Angevins would take control of Lucania in the mid-13th century before being part of the Kingdom of Aragon in the 14th century after the War of the Sicilian Vespers.

==Cities and towns==

The towns on the east coast were Metapontum, a few miles south of the Bradanus; Heraclea, at the mouth of the Aciris; and Sins, on the river of the same name. 

Close to its southern frontier stood Sybaris, which was destroyed in 510 BC, but subsequently replaced by Thurii. On the west coast stood Posidonia, known under the Roman government as Paestum; below that came Elea (Velia under the Romans), Pyxus, called by the Romans Buxentum, and Laüs, near the frontier of the province towards Bruttium. 

Of the towns of the interior the most considerable was Potentia, still called Potenza. To the north, near the frontier of Apulia, was Bantia (Aceruntia belonged more properly to Apulia); while due south from Potentia was Grumentum, and still farther in that direction were Nerulum and Muranum. 

In the upland valley of the Tanagrus were Atina, Forum Popilii and Consilinum (near Sala Consilina); Eburi (Eboli) and Volceii (Buccino), though to the north of the Silarus, were also included in Lucania. 

The Via Popilia traversed the district from north to south, entering it at the northwestern extremity; the , coming southwards from the Via Appia and passing through Potentia and Grumentum, joined the Via Popilia near the southwestern edge of the district: while another nameless road followed the east coast and other roads of less importance ran west from Potentia to the Via Popilia, northeast to the Via Appia and east from Grumentum to the coast at Heraclea.

==Later use==

The modern name Basilicata originates from the 10th century AD, when the area was under Byzantine control. During the early 19th century, during the Carbonari revolution of 1820–21, the region was renamed and divided into Eastern and Western Lucania (&quot;Lucania Orientale&quot; and &quot;Lucania Occidentale&quot;). From the latter half of the 19th century some residents campaigned to reinstate that name. 

In 1932 the Fascist regime changed the name to Lucania, as part of its appropriation of symbols from the Roman Empire. After the end of the war and Italy&#x27;s defeat, the new government restored the name of Basilicata to the province in 1947. In the late 20th century, Lucania was still in vernacular use as a synonym to Basilicata.

<text>Raymond Edward Brown (May 22, 1928 – August 8, 1998) was an American Sulpician priest and prominent biblical scholar. He was a specialist on the hypothetical Johannine community, which he speculated contributed to the authorship of the Gospel of John, and he also wrote studies on the birth and death of Jesus. 

Brown was professor emeritus at Union Theological Seminary (UTS) in New York City, where he taught for 29 years. He was the first Catholic professor to gain tenure there, where he earned a reputation as a superior lecturer.

==Life==
Born in New York City, the son of Robert H. and Loretta Brown, Raymond studied at the Catholic University of America in Washington, D.C., where he received a bachelor&#x27;s degree in 1948 and a Master of Arts degree in 1949 as a Basselin scholar. In 1953, he was ordained a Catholic priest for the Diocese of St. Augustine. In 1955, he joined the Society of Saint-Sulpice following his reception of a doctorate in Sacred Theology from St. Mary&#x27;s Seminary in Baltimore. He earned a second doctorate in Semitic languages in 1958 from Johns Hopkins University, where one of his advisors was William F. Albright.

Following his studies, Brown taught at his &quot;alma mater&quot;, St. Mary&#x27;s Seminary, until 1971. During this period, he was a research fellow at the American Schools of Oriental Research in Jerusalem, where he worked on a concordance of the Dead Sea Scrolls. In 1963, he served as an expert adviser, known as a &quot;peritus&quot;, to Joseph P. Hurley, the Bishop of St. Augustine, at the Second Vatican Council.

Brown was appointed in 1972 to the Pontifical Biblical Commission and again in 1996. He was the Auburn Distinguished Professor of Biblical Studies at the Union Theological Seminary in New York City, where he taught from 1971 until 1990, when he retired with the title of professor emeritus. He served as the President of the Catholic Biblical Association, the Society of Biblical Literature (1976–77), and the Society of New Testament Studies (1986–87). Brown was awarded 24 honorary doctoral degrees by universities in the United States and Europe, including many from Protestant institutions.

Brown died at Saint Patrick&#x27;s Seminary and University in Menlo Park, California. The Archbishop of Los Angeles, Cardinal Roger Mahony hailed him as &quot;the most distinguished and renowned Catholic biblical scholar to emerge in this country ever&quot; and his death, the cardinal said, was &quot;a great loss to the Church.&quot;

==Scholarly views==
Brown was one of the first Catholic scholars in the United States to use the historical-critical method to study the Bible.

In 1943, reversing the approach that had existed since Pope Leo XIII&#x27;s encyclical &quot;Providentissimus Deus&quot; 50 years earlier, Pope Pius XII&#x27;s encyclical &quot;Divino afflante Spiritu&quot; expressed approval of historical-critical methods. For Brown, this was a &quot;Magna Carta for biblical progress.&quot; In 1965, at the Second Vatican Council, the Church moved further in this direction, adopting the Dogmatic constitution on Divine Revelation, known as &quot;Dei verbum&quot;, which superseded the conservative schema, &quot;On the Sources of Revelation&quot;, that originally had been submitted. While it stated that Scripture teaches &quot;solidly, faithfully and without error that truth which God wanted put into sacred writings for the sake of salvation,&quot; Brown pointed out the ambiguity of this statement, which opened the way for a new interpretation of inerrancy by shifting from a literal interpretation of the text towards a focus on &quot;the extent to which it conforms to the salvific purpose of God.&quot; Brown saw this as the Catholic Church &quot;turning the corner&quot; on inerrancy, saying, &quot;the Roman Catholic Church does not change her official stance in a blunt way. Past statements are not rejected but are requoted with praise and then reinterpreted at the same time...What was really going on was an attempt gracefully to retain what was salvageable from the past and to move in a new direction at the same time.&quot;

===New Testament Christology===
In a detailed 1965 article in the journal &quot;Theological Studies&quot; examining whether Jesus was ever called &quot;God&quot; in the New Testament, Brown wrote, &quot;Even the fourth Gospel never portrays Jesus as saying specifically that he is God&quot; and &quot;there is no reason to think that Jesus was called God in the earliest layers of New Testament tradition.&quot; He wrote that, &quot;Gradually, in the development of Christian thought God was understood to be a broader term. It was seen that God had revealed so much of Himself in Jesus that God had to be able to include both Father and Son.&quot;

Thirty years later, Brown revisited the issue in an introductory text for the general public, writing, &quot;three reasonably clear instances in the NT (Hebrews 1:8–9, John 1:1, 20:28) and in five instances that have probability, Jesus is called God,&quot; a usage Brown regarded as a natural development of early references to Jesus as &quot;Lord&quot;.

===Gospel of John===
Brown analyzed the Gospel of John and divided it into two sections, which he labelled the Book of Signs and the Book of Glory. The Book of Signs recounts Jesus&#x27; public miracles, which are called signs. The Book of Glory features Jesus&#x27; private teachings to his disciples, his crucifixion, and his resurrection.

Brown identified three layers of text in John: 1) an initial version Brown considers based on personal experience of Jesus; 2) a structured literary creation by the evangelist which draws upon additional sources; and 3) the edited version that readers of the Bible know today.

==Reactions==
===Support===
Brown has been described as &quot;the premier Johannine scholar in the English-speaking world.&quot; Terrence T. Prendergast stated that “for nearly 40 years Father Brown caught the entire church up into the excitement and new possibilities of scriptural scholarship.&quot; Much of Brown&#x27;s work was given a &quot;nihil obstat&quot; and an &quot;imprimatur.&quot; The &quot;nihil obstat&quot; is a statement by an official reviewer, appointed by a bishop, that &quot;nothing stands in the way&quot; of a book being given an imprimatur; the &quot;imprimatur&quot;, which must normally be issued by a bishop of the diocese of publication, is the official endorsement &quot;let it be printed&quot; that a book contains nothing damaging to Catholic faith and morals. Brown was the expert appointed to review and provide the &quot;nihil obstat&quot; for &quot;The Jerome Biblical Commentary&quot; and &quot;The New Jerome Biblical Commentary&quot;, the standard basic reference book for Catholic Biblical studies, and he served as one of its editors and authors along with dozens of other Catholic scholars.

Joseph Ratzinger, later Pope Benedict XVI, complimented Brown saying that he &quot;would be very happy if we had many exegetes like Father Brown&quot;.
Later on however, Ratzinger would critique the overuse of historical criticism and parts of Brown&#x27;s scholarship, saying that &quot;we need a self-criticism of the historical method&quot;.

===Criticism===
Brown&#x27;s scholarship was controversial for questioning the inerrancy of the whole of scripture and casting doubt on the historical accuracy of numerous articles of the Catholic faith. He was regarded as occupying the center ground in the field of biblical studies, opposing literalism found among many fundamentalist Christians but not carrying his conclusions as far as many other scholars. His critics included Cardinal Lawrence Shehan, Father Richard W. Gilsdorf, and George A. Kelly. Gilsdorf defined Brown&#x27;s work as &quot;a major contribution to the befogged wasteland of an &#x27;American Church&#x27; progressively alienated from its divinely constituted center.&quot; George A. Kelly found fault with Brown&#x27;s questioning of whether the Virgin birth of Jesus could be proven historically.

Other writers, critical of historical Christian claims about Jesus, criticized Brown for excessive caution, arguing that he was unwilling to acknowledge the radical implications of the critical methods he was using. Literary critic Frank Kermode, in his review of &quot;The Birth of the Messiah&quot;, accused Brown of being too eager to secure the &quot;imprimatur&quot; of the Catholic Church. The Hebraic Jesus scholar Géza Vermes, speaking of the Nativity narratives, has described Brown&#x27;s coverage as &quot;the primary example of the position of having your cake and eating it.&quot; In his obituary for &quot;The New York Times&quot;, Gustav Niebuhr wrote: &quot;Father Brown was regarded as a centrist, with a reputation as a man of the church and a rigorous, exacting scholar whose work had to be reckoned with.&quot;

<doc id="725933" wikidata="Q307252" url="?curid=725933" title="Abdul Karim Abdullah al-Arashi">
<text>Abdul Karim Abdullah al-Arashi (22 July 1929 – 10 June 2006) (), was a Yemeni politician who served as the interim President of the Yemen Arab Republic briefly from 24 June to 18 July 1978. He was preceded by Ahmed Al-Ghashmi and succeeded by Ali Abdullah Saleh. He also served as Vice President of Yemen Arab Republic, from 1978 to 1990, and the Speaker of the Constituent People&#x27;s Assembly (Parliament) from 1978 to 1988, and the president of the Shura Council from 1988 to 1990.

A statement by the president&#x27;s office noted that Al-Arashi played an important role in the 1962 Yemeni revolution and in defending its goals. “Throughout the various positions he held, he proved to be steadfast and highly competent,” the statement indicated.

He died on June 10, 2006, in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia aged 71.

== Early life ==
Born in 1934 in Sana’a city North Yemen, Al-Arashi received his basic education in Sana’a and completed his studies at the Scientific School. He then embarked upon judiciary and administrative work while he was young. After the September 26 revolution, he became more prominent at the political level, as he participated in various military campaigns in defence of the revolution.

== Career ==
Al-Arashi held numerous prominent positions, being appointed Minister of Finance twice, during which he established the state&#x27;s first budget. He also was appointed Minister of Local Administration whereupon he reformulated the Local Governance Law.

Following President Ahmed Al-Ghashmi&#x27;s assassination, He was appointed Chairman of the Presidential Council of the former Yemen Arab Republic (also known as North Yemen) from June 24 to July 18, 1978. Shortly thereafter, he was elected chairman of the People&#x27;s Council (Parliament) as well as vice president in the same year.

In 1988, Al-Arashi unanimously was elected Shura Council president. Two years later, namely on the occasion of reunification, he was elected a member of the Presidential Council. In 1997, he was appointed a consultant to the president.

<text>The Westminster Foundation for Democracy (WFD) is a United Kingdom non-departmental public body set up to support democratic institutions overseas. It was established on 26 February 1992 and registered as a company limited by guarantee in the UK. It receives funding from the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office (FCDO).

Former diplomat Anthony Smith has been CEO since August 2014.

== History ==
Established on 26 February 1992, not long after the fall of the Berlin wall, WFD initially focused on providing support to political parties in Eastern European countries as they transition to democracy. By the 2000s, WFD became well known as an organisation with specialty in strengthening parliamentary capacity through their programmes.

== Objectives ==
WFD works to achieve sustainable political change in emerging democracies. Working with and through partner organisations, WFD seeks to strengthen the institutions of democracy through capacity building initiatives, technical support, and research projects that involve principally political parties (through the work of the UK political parties), parliaments, and the range of institutions that make up civil society, which includes non-governmental organisations (NGOs), trade unions, and the free press, among others.

== Funding ==
In 2016, WFD had a budget of about £7 million, of which about £2.5 million was spent through the major UK political parties. WFD accounts are presented to the UK parliament annually. In 2021, its budget had doubled to over £14 million which included funds received from the FCDO, the Conflict, Stability and Security Fund (CSSF), the European Union (EU), and others.

== Offices ==
WFD is headquartered in London. As of September 2021, WFD operates in 25 countries grouped into several regional groupings: Asia, Europe &amp; Central Asia, Middle East &amp; North Africa, Sub-Saharan Africa, and Latin America.

<doc id="725940" wikidata="Q1368590" url="?curid=725940" title="Francis X. Bushman">
<text>Francis Xavier Bushman (January 10, 1883 – August 23, 1966) was an American film actor and director. His career as a matinee idol started in 1911 in the silent film &quot;His Friend&#x27;s Wife.&quot; He gained a large female following and was one of the biggest stars of the 1910s and early 1920s.

Bushman, like many of his contemporaries, broke into the moving picture business via the stage. He rose to fame at Essanay Studios in Chicago, where he was first noticed for his muscular, sculpted frame. He appeared in nearly 200 feature film roles—more than 175 films before 1920, and 27 in his screen debut year of 1911 alone. He also worked for the Vitagraph studio before signing with Metro in 1915. He later went into radio and television.

==Biography==

Bushman was born in Baltimore, Maryland. As a young man he joined the Maryland Athletic Club and began a body building regimen that would give him his famous film physique. He cited Eugen Sandow as one of his body building influences. In New York City, he worked as a sculptor&#x27;s model, often posing in the nude in sessions. In 1902, he married seamstress Josephine Louisa Fladung. By the launch of his film career, the couple had five children. After appearing in theater, Bushman was hired by Essanay Studios in Chicago in 1911, launching his film career and stardom. Over the next five years he appeared generally as the leading man in over a hundred silent films for the studio. The studio’s publicity department kept secret his marriage from his fans, who sent him thousands of letters, including marriage proposals.

In 1918, he was the subject of a national scandal as his affair with longtime costar Beverly Bayne became public. Three days after his divorce with Josephine was final, Bushman and Bayne were married; they would eventually have a son. Bushman and his studios had kept his marriage secret for fear of losing popularity. He was married four times. In late 1919 and 1920, Bushman and Bayne co-starred in the stage play &quot;The Master Thief&quot;, from a story by Richard Washburn Child, which successfully toured the country.
Bushman eventually retained the services of Harry Reichenbach as his agent. When Bushman noted that he would be well-suited to starring in an upcoming 1925 film, &quot;Ben-Hur&quot;, Reichenbach had a plan to increase his client&#x27;s marketability. From a railway station, Reichenbach took Bushman to see studio executives, while dropping pennies to the street from his pocket. Many people followed the two, picking up the coins along the way. The crowd gave the studio executives the impression that Bushman was very popular, and they cast him as Messala. Bushman was concerned that playing a villain would affect his career, so he asked the advice of William S. Hart, who had played the part on stage for years. &quot;Take it,&quot; Hart advised. &quot;It&#x27;s the best part in the play!&quot; Unlike Ramon Novarro, the star of the picture, Bushman knew how to drive a team of horses and a chariot without getting severely injured or killed in the process. When &quot;Ben Hur&quot; was remade in 1959, Charlton Heston had to learn the technique and quipped: &quot;The only man in Hollywood who can drive a chariot is Francis X. Bushman — and he&#x27;s too old!&quot;
Bushman was paid large salaries during his screen career, and donated the land upon which Sid Grauman erected his famous Chinese Theater. But his fortune was wiped out in the Wall Street Crash of 1929, and his career as a movie star had had its run. After his film career had waned, Bushman made his broadcasting mark on the CBS Radio network&#x27;s long-running dramatic serial entitled &quot;Those We Love&quot;. In the soap opera, which ran from 1938 to 1945, he played the role of John Marshall, father of twins played by Richard Cromwell and Nan Grey. Robert Cummings rounded out the cast. Bushman took small roles in pictures, appearing perhaps most prominently as a business tycoon in Billy Wilder&#x27;s 1954 film Sabrina, and attempted to run a few small businesses, all of which lost money. On viewing one of his early films, Bushman is said to have remarked, &quot;My God, look at that! I&#x27;m putting all my emotion into my &quot;chin&quot;!&quot;

In later years, Bushman made guest appearances on American television in the 1950s and 1960s. On February 6, 1958, he and his wife Iva Millicent Richardson appeared on the quiz show &quot;You Bet Your Life&quot; with Groucho Marx and won $1,000 by successfully answering questions in a geography quiz. He also performed on weekly sitcoms and television dramas, including &quot;Burns and Allen&quot;, &quot;Peter Gunn&quot;, &quot;Make Room for Daddy&quot;, &quot;The Many Loves of Dobie Gillis&quot;, &quot;Perry Mason&quot;, &quot;The Adventures of Ozzie and Harriet&quot;, and &quot;Dr. Kildare&quot;. Bushman guest-starred as well in 1966 on a two-part episode of &quot;Batman&quot;. Both Bushman and Neil Hamilton, his co-star in &quot;The Grip of the Yukon&quot;, appeared in the &quot;Batman&quot; episode—their first reunion acting together in 38 years. Bushman&#x27;s role as a wealthy collector of silent pictures and promoter of a silent film festival (&quot;Batman&quot; episodes 31 &amp; 32) was his last appearance on camera.

Bushman is mentioned numerous times by the character Pearl Bodine in the first season of &quot;The Beverly Hillbillies&quot;. In the episode entitled &quot;No Place Like Home,&quot; Pearl has written a song which she plays when the silent version of &quot;Ben-Hur&quot; is shown in the Clampetts&#x27; hometown. In a later episode, when Pearl visits the Clampetts in Los Angeles, she speaks about hoping to meet Bushman. In the episode &quot;Jed&#x27;s Dilemma,&quot; Jed takes the family on a sightseeing tour of Beverly Hills. When passing a fancy home, Pearl wonders if it could be the home of a movie star, possibly Francis X. Bushman. Jed tells her it cannot be Bushman&#x27;s home because he got a good look in the yard and did not see room for horses or a chariot.

Bushman suffered a heart attack and died at his home in Pacific Palisades, California, on August 23, 1966. He was interred at Forest Lawn Memorial Park Cemetery in Glendale, California.

==Legacy==
His son Ralph Everly Bushman (1903–1978) had a film career from the 1920s through the 1940s. Tall (6&#x27;4&quot;) and good-looking, he was in over 40 films, often playing stuffy upper-class types or menacing gangsters. In &quot;Brown of Harvard&quot; (1926) he was cast against William Haines and Jack Pickford. He was often billed as &quot;Francis X. Bushman Jr.&quot;

Francis Bushman&#x27;s granddaughter, Barbara Bushman Quine (1925–2013), married actor Harry Morgan. A grandson, Pat Conway (1931–1981), the son of film director Jack Conway and Bushman&#x27;s daughter, Virginia, starred on the ABC western television series &quot;Tombstone Territory&quot;.

For his contributions to the film industry, Bushman was inducted into the Hollywood Walk of Fame in 1960 with a motion pictures star located at 1651 Vine Street.

<text>The Strategic Rail Authority (SRA) was a non-departmental public body in the United Kingdom set up under the Transport Act 2000 to provide strategic direction for the railway industry. Its motto was &#x27;Britain&#x27;s railway, properly delivered&#x27;. It was abolished by the Railways (Abolition of the Strategic Rail Authority) Order 2006, its functions being absorbed by the Department for Transport or the Office of Rail Regulation (now the Office of Rail and Road).

==Establishment==

The Shadow SRA was established in 1999 following the election of the Labour government in 1997 in an attempt to increase public interest regulation of the fragmented railway network following the privatisation of British Rail. It incorporated the former Conservative government&#x27;s Director of Passenger Rail Franchising. Its main function was awarding and ensuring compliance with passenger rail franchises – contracts between the state and private sector operators under which the operators committed to provide certain levels of service in return for public subsidies; some franchises were cash-positive, which meant that the operator paid the SRA for the right to provide the services. The SRA&#x27;s other functions were concerned with the financial support of other unviable services, such as the giving of grants to support marginal rail freight services and the building of freight facilities.

The SRA was placed on a formal legal basis by the Transport Act 2000 and came into existence on 1 February 2001.

The government wanted the SRA to take a more interventionist role with Railtrack and its successor Network Rail, but never gave it the legal powers to do so. Those powers rested with - and were jealously guarded by - the Rail Regulator, who frequently clashed with the SRA when he believed that it was over-reaching its jurisdiction.

The SRA operated under directions and guidance from the Secretary of State for Transport, also in Scotland from the Scottish Minister for Transport and in Greater London from the Mayor of London.

In Scotland the budget of the SRA was devolved to the Scottish Parliament under the terms of the Barnett Formula.

The SRA&#x27;s first chairman was Sir Alastair Morton, from February 1999 until October 2001. Its first chief executive was Mike Grant. Its second chairman (and also chief executive) was Richard Bowker, who served between October 2001 and September 2004. Its third chairman was David Quarmby, and third chief executive Nick Newton, from September 2004 to abolition.

==Abolition==
On 15 July 2004 the Secretary of State for Transport, Alistair Darling MP, announced that the SRA was to be abolished within the next 12–18 months. Following the passing of the Railways Act 2005 it was wound up on 1 December 2006, and its functions transferred to the Department for Transport Rail Group, to the Network Rail and to the Office of Rail Regulation. The Scottish Executive, the Welsh Assembly Government and the Greater London Authority were given some input in their areas.

<doc id="725942" wikidata="Q401266" url="?curid=725942" title="Ahmad al-Ghashmi">
<text>Ahmad bin Hussein al-Ghashmi (21 August 1935 – 24 June 1978) () was a Yemeni military officer who served as the fourth President of the Yemen Arab Republic (North Yemen) from 11 October 1977 until his assassination eight months later. Al-Ghashmi had assumed power when his predecessor, Ibrahim al-Hamdi, was assassinated.

==Early life and career==
Ahmed al-Ghashmi was born on 21 August 1935 in Hamdan District, Sanaa Governorate, North Yemen. According to some sources he was born in 1938, but according to others he was born in 1941.

After the coup d&#x27;état of September 26, 1962 and the subsequent outbreak of the North Yemen Civil War (1962-1970) began. Al-Gashmi defected to the republican side of Abdullah al-Sallal against the royalists under Muhammad al-Badr.

By the time Ibrahim al-Hamdi was president of North Yemen, al-Gashmi was vice president of the Leadership Council and Chief of Staff of the Armed Forces.

On 11 October 1977, al-Hamdi was assassinated and al-Gashmi took over the country. A man believed to be a Saudi agent was accused of assassinating the president. Al-Gashmi himself was also suspected.

== Activities as President ==
President al-Ghashmi reinstated the 1970 Constitution, which had previously been suspended by al-Hamdi, the country&#x27;s previous President, in 1974. However, an important body such as the Consultative Council was not reinstated, and at the same time the office of the President was introduced.

He appointed Ali Abdullah Saleh as military governor in Taiz, who became the next president.

== Death ==
His assassination occurred on 24 June 1978 when he was meeting an envoy sent by People&#x27;s Democratic Republic of Yemen President, Salim Rubai Ali. A briefcase, reportedly containing a secret message, exploded, killing both al-Ghashmi and the envoy. It is not conclusively known who set off the explosion.

Coincidentally, Rubai Ali died in a coup three days after this event.

<doc id="725945" wikidata="Q597154" url="?curid=725945" title="Mercury Seven">
<text>The Mercury Seven were the group of seven astronauts selected to fly spacecraft for Project Mercury. They are also referred to as the Original Seven and Astronaut Group 1. Their names were publicly announced by NASA on April 9, 1959: Scott Carpenter, Gordon Cooper, John Glenn, Gus Grissom, Wally Schirra, Alan Shepard, and Deke Slayton. The Mercury Seven created a new profession in the United States, and established the image of the American astronaut for decades to come.

All of the Mercury Seven eventually flew in space. They piloted the six spaceflights of the Mercury program that had an astronaut on board from May 1961 to May 1963, and members of the group flew on all of the NASA human spaceflight programs of the 20th centuryMercury, Gemini, Apollo, and the Space Shuttle.

Shepard became the first American to enter space in 1961, and walked on the Moon on Apollo 14 in 1971. Grissom flew the first crewed Gemini mission in 1965, but died in 1967 in the Apollo 1 fire; the others all survived past retirement from service. Schirra flew Apollo 7 in 1968, the first crewed Apollo mission, in Grissom&#x27;s place, and became the only astronaut to fly Mercury, Gemini and Apollo missions. Cooper piloted the last Mercury spaceflight, Mercury-Atlas 9, in 1963, and in 1965 became the first astronaut to make a second orbital flight when he flew as command pilot of Gemini 5. Carpenter flew Mercury-Atlas 7 in 1962. He later took leave of absence to join the U.S. Navy SEALAB project as an aquanaut, but in training suffered injuries that made him unavailable for further spaceflights. 

Slayton, grounded with an atrial fibrillation, ultimately flew on the Apollo–Soyuz Test Project in 1975. The first American in orbit in 1962, Glenn flew on the in 1998 to become, at age 77, the oldest person to fly in space at the time. He was the oldest member of the Mercury Seven, and the last living member of the group when he died in 2016 at age 95.

== Background ==
The launch of the Sputnik 1 satellite by the Soviet Union on October 4, 1957, started a Cold War technological and ideological competition with the United States known as the Space Race. The demonstration of American technological inferiority came as a profound shock to the American public. The Soviets followed up with Sputnik 2, which carried Laika, a Soviet space dog. American intelligence analysts assessed that the Soviets planned to put a man into orbit, which caused the United States Air Force (USAF) and the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics (NACA) to strengthen their efforts to achieve that goal.

The USAF launched a spaceflight project called Man in Space Soonest (MISS), for which it obtained approval from the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and requested $133 million in funding. MISS encountered technical challenges, which in turn caused funding difficulties. This generated conflict with the two agencies that should have been supporting it, NACA and the Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA). The core of the problem was the USAF&#x27;s inability to articulate a clear military purpose for MISS.

Meanwhile, in response to the Sputnik crisis, the President of the United States, Dwight D. Eisenhower, decided to create a new civilian agency, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), which would absorb NACA and be responsible for the overall direction of the American space program. In September 1958, the USAF agreed to transfer responsibility for MISS to NASA, which was established on October 1, 1958. On November 5, the Space Task Group (STG) was established at the NASA Langley Research Center in Hampton, Virginia, with Robert R. Gilruth as its director. On November 26, 1958, NASA Administrator T. Keith Glennan and his deputy, Hugh Dryden, adopted a suggestion by Abe Silverstein, the director of Space Flight Development at STG, that the human spaceflight project be called Project Mercury. The name was publicly announced by Glennan on December 17, 1958, the 55th anniversary of the Wright Brothers&#x27; first flight. The objective of Project Mercury was to launch a man into Earth orbit, return him safely to the Earth, and evaluate his capabilities in space.

== Selection criteria ==
The STG had to decide on a name for the people who would fly into space. A brainstorming session was held on December 1, 1958. By analogy with &quot;aeronaut&quot; (air traveler), someone came up with the term &quot;astronaut&quot;, which meant &quot;star traveler&quot;, although Project Mercury&#x27;s ambitions were far more limited. They thought that they had coined a new word, but the term had been used in science fiction since the 1920s. A three-man panel consisting of Charles J. Donlan, Warren J. North and Allen O. Gamble drew up a civil service job specification for astronauts. The panel proposed that astronauts be in civil service grades 12 to 15, depending on qualifications and experience, with an annual salary of $8,330 to $12,770 (equivalent to $ to $ in ). It described the duties of an astronaut:

Although the panel considered that many people might possess the required skills – aircraft pilots, submariners, deep sea divers and mountain climbers were all considered likely prospects – it decided that they could be best met by military test pilots. Accepting only military test pilots would simplify the selection process, and would also satisfy security requirements, as the role would almost certainly involve the handling of classified information. The decision to restrict selection to military test pilots was taken by Glennan, Dryden and Gilruth in the last week of December 1958, but the irony of using military test pilots in a civilian program was not overlooked, and in view of the President&#x27;s express preference for a space program outside the military, Glennan thought it best to run the decision past Eisenhower. A meeting was arranged with the President, who was convinced by the arguments.

The panel also drew up selection criteria. Astronauts had to be:
# Less than 40 years old;
# Less than tall;
# In excellent physical condition;
# With a bachelor&#x27;s degree or equivalent;
# A graduate of test pilot school;
# With a minimum of 1,500 hours total flying time; and
# A qualified jet pilot.

The height limit was a function of the design of the Mercury spacecraft, which could not accommodate someone taller. It was still uncertain as to whether piloting in the conventional sense would ever be possible in a spacecraft, but from the beginning the spacecraft design provided for some degree of manual control.

== Selection process ==

The first step in the selection process was to obtain the service records of test pilot school graduates from the United States Department of Defense. All services agreed to cooperate fully, and handed over their records. There were 508 military test pilots in total, of whom 225 were Air Force, 225 Navy, 23 Marine Corps and 35 Army. Donlan, North, Gamble and psychologist Robert B. Voas then went through the records in January 1959, and identified 110 pilots – five Marines, 47 from the Navy, and 58 from the Air Force – who met the rest of the minimum standards. The 110 were then split into three groups, with the most promising in the first group.

Sixty-nine candidates were brought to the Pentagon in Washington, DC, in two groups. The first group of 35 assembled there on February 2, 1959. The Navy and Marine Corps officers were welcomed by the Chief of Naval Operations, Admiral Arleigh Burke, while the Air Force officers were addressed by the Chief of Staff of the United States Air Force, General Thomas D. White. Both pledged their support to the space program, and promised that the careers of volunteers would not be adversely affected. NASA officials then briefed the candidates on Project Mercury. The officials conceded that it would be a hazardous undertaking, but emphasized that it was of great national importance.

The candidates were given three briefings by NASA officials. The first was about NASA and Project Mercury; the second concerned the role of the pilot in the project; and the third was about the proposed astronaut training syllabus. In the afternoon candidates had short individual meetings with the NASA selection committee. It was emphasized that participation was entirely voluntary, that candidates were free to decline, and that there would be no career repercussions if they did so. Several candidates declined at this point.

The rest reported to NASA Headquarters in Washington, DC, the following day for further screening. Voas gave them a series of standardized tests: the Miller Analogies Test to measure IQ; the Minnesota Engineering Analogies Test to measure engineering aptitude; and the Doppelt Mathematical Reasoning Test to measure mathematical aptitude. Donlan, North and Gamble conducted interviews in which they asked technical questions, and queried candidates about their motivations for applying to the program. Candidates were evaluated by two USAF psychiatrists, George E. Ruff and Edwin Z. Levy. A USAF flight surgeon, William S. Augerson, went over the candidates&#x27; medical records. Some were found to be over the height limit, and were eliminated at this juncture.

The process was repeated with a second group of 34 candidates a week later. Of the 69, six were found to be over the height limit, 15 were eliminated for other reasons, and 16 declined. This left NASA with 32 candidates: 15 from the Navy, 15 from the Air Force and two from the Marine Corps. Since this was more than expected, NASA decided not to bother with the remaining 41 candidates, as 32 candidates seemed a more than adequate number from which to select 12 astronauts as planned. The degree of interest also indicated that far fewer would drop out during training than anticipated, which would result in training astronauts who would not be required to fly Project Mercury missions. It was therefore decided to cut the number of astronauts selected to just six.

Then came a grueling series of physical and psychological tests at the Lovelace Clinic and the Wright Aerospace Medical Laboratory from January to March, under the direction of Albert H. Schwichtenberg, a retired USAF brigadier general. The tests included spending hours on treadmills and tilt tables, submerging their feet in ice water, three doses of castor oil, and five enemas. Only one candidate, Jim Lovell, was eliminated on medical grounds at this stage, a diagnosis that was later found to be in error; thirteen others were recommended with reservations. Gilruth found himself unable to select only six from the remaining eighteen, and ultimately seven were chosen.

Despite their rejection from the first group of astronauts, many of the 25 finalists who were passed over still had successful military careers. Three eventually became astronauts: Pete Conrad and Jim Lovell, who were selected with the next group in 1962; and Edward Givens, who was selected with the fifth group in 1966. Others achieved high rank: Lawrence Heyworth Jr. became a rear admiral, Robert B. Baldwin and William P. Lawrence became vice admirals, and Thomas B. Hayward became an admiral. He commanded the Seventh Fleet and the Pacific Fleet, and was Chief of Naval Operations. Three of the finalists later died in aircraft accidents: Halvor M. Ekeren, Jr., on April 8, 1959; Jack B. Mayo on January 11, 1961; and Hal R. Crandall on July 24, 1963. Finalist Robert G. Bell died in the May 16, 1965, explosion of multiple aircraft at Bien Hoa Air Base, Vietnam.

== Eligibility ==
The seven original American astronauts were Navy Lieutenant Scott Carpenter, Air Force Captain Gordon Cooper, Marine Lieutenant Colonel John Glenn, Air Force Captain Gus Grissom, Navy Lieutenant Commander Wally Schirra, Navy Lieutenant Commander Alan Shepard, and Air Force Captain Deke Slayton.
All were male and white. Women were not yet accepted into the military test pilot schools, and the first African American to graduate from the USAF Experimental Test Pilot School, John L. Whitehead Jr., did so only in January 1958, and was not one of the finalists. Yet the Mercury Seven were similar beyond what was a simple result of the selection criteria. Four were their fathers&#x27; namesakes. All were the eldest or only sons in their families. All were born in the United States, and were raised in small towns. All were married with children, and all were Protestants.

Their ages at the time of selection ranged from 32 (Cooper) to 37 (Glenn). Shepard was the tallest, at the maximum height of ; Grissom, the shortest at . Weight was not a firm criterion like height, as losing weight was always possible, but the Mercury spacecraft set a limit of . Cooper was the lightest, at , while Glenn was at the maximum weight of , and Schirra was slightly overweight at , and had to lose weight to be accepted. Both had to watch their weight carefully while they were in the space program. IQs ranged from 135 to 147.

All seven had attended post-secondary institutions in the 1940s. Of the five astronauts who had completed undergraduate degrees before being selected, two (Shepard and Schirra) were graduates of the United States Naval Academy at Annapolis, Maryland, in 1944 and 1945, respectively. Following a decade of intermittent studies, Cooper completed his bachelor&#x27;s degree in aerospace engineering at the Air Force Institute of Technology (AFIT) in 1956. Grissom earned a bachelor&#x27;s degree in mechanical engineering from Purdue University in 1950, and a second bachelor&#x27;s degree, in aeromechanics, from the AFIT in 1956. Slayton graduated from the University of Minnesota with a bachelor&#x27;s degree in aeronautical engineering in 1949. Average flying hours were 3,500, of which 1,700 was in jets. Most were fighter pilots except Carpenter, who flew multi-engine patrol planes for most of his career.

Glenn and Carpenter did not meet all of their schools&#x27; degree requirements; Glenn had not completed his senior year in residence or his final proficiency exam, and Carpenter had not finished his final course in heat transfer. Both were admitted on the basis of professional equivalency, and were ultimately awarded their bachelor&#x27;s degrees after their 1962 space flights—Glenn in engineering from Muskingum College and Carpenter in aeronautical engineering from the University of Colorado at Boulder.

Despite the extensive physical examinations, Slayton had an undiagnosed atrial fibrillation, which resulted in his grounding two months prior to what would have been his first space flight, and the second orbital mission.

== NASA introduction ==
NASA introduced the astronauts in Washington, DC, on April 9, 1959. Although the agency viewed Project Mercury&#x27;s purpose as an experiment to determine whether humans could survive space travel, the seven men immediately became national heroes and were compared by &quot;Time&quot; magazine to &quot;Columbus, Magellan, Daniel Boone, and the Wright brothers.&quot; Two hundred reporters overflowed the room used for the announcement and alarmed the astronauts, who were unused to such a large audience.

Because they wore civilian clothes, the audience did not see them as military test pilots but &quot;mature, middle-class Americans, average in height and visage, family men all.&quot; To the astronauts&#x27; surprise, the reporters asked questions about their personal lives instead of their war records or flight experience, or details about Project Mercury. After Glenn responded by speaking eloquently &quot;on God, country, and family,&quot; the others followed his example, and were applauded by the reporters.

Test pilots accepted that their jobs were dangerous; during Glenn&#x27;s three years serving as one for the Navy, 12 had died. When asked about how their families thought about their taking on such a dangerous job, most of the seven were surprised, as they had never considered this before. Glenn replied that he &quot;didn&#x27;t think that any of us could really go on with something like this if we didn&#x27;t have pretty good backing at home. My wife&#x27;s attitude towards this has been the same as it has been all along through my flying. If it is what I want to do, she is behind it, and the kids are too, one hundred percent.&quot; Carpenter received even more applause when he noted that he was at sea when NASA had phoned to inform him that he had been chosen, and his wife Rene had accepted on his behalf. His selection had also tested the Navy&#x27;s commitment to Project Mercury when the skipper of his ship, the , refused to release him, and Burke had to personally intervene.

Cooper&#x27;s wife Trudy had left him in January 1959 after he had an affair with another officer&#x27;s wife, and had moved to San Diego. During the selection interviews, he had been asked about his domestic relationship, and had lied, saying that he and Trudy had a good, stable marriage. Aware that NASA wanted to project an image of its astronauts as loving family men, and that his story would not stand up to scrutiny, he drove down to San Diego to see Trudy at the first opportunity. Lured by the prospect of a great adventure for herself and her daughters, she agreed to go along with the charade and pretend that they were a happily married couple.

== Influence ==
The Mercury spacecraft was less finished than the astronauts&#x27; previous vehicles. After watching an Atlas rocket explode during launch on May 18, 1959, they publicly joked &quot;I&#x27;m glad they got that out of the way&quot;typical gallows humor that test pilots used to cope with dangerbut privately calculated that one of the seven would die during Project Mercury. The astronauts participated in the project&#x27;s design and planning, dividing the work between them. Carpenter had training in airborne electronics and celestial navigation, so he assumed responsibility for the spacecraft&#x27;s communications and navigation systems. Grissom had a degree in mechanical engineering, so he became responsible for the attitude control systems. Glenn had experience flying many types of aircraft, so he oversaw the cockpit layout. Schirra drew responsibility for the life support systems and the pressure suits. Drawing on his experience as a Naval officer, Shepard looked after the tracking network and liaised with the Navy on recovery operations. Cooper and Slayton were Air Force officers with engineering backgrounds, so they dealt with the Redstone Arsenal and Convair, who built the Redstone and Atlas boosters used by Project Mercury. The astronauts affected the design of the Mercury spacecraft in significant ways, insisting that a window be installed, and pressing for a greater degree of astronaut autonomy in flying the spacecraft.

The astronauts remained on active duty as military officers, and were paid according to their rank. To supplement their travel, they were provided a $9 &quot;per diem&quot; () for day trips, and a $12 &quot;per diem&quot; () for overnight trips, which did not cover the cost of hotels and restaurant meals. As a result, astronauts avoided spending money while traveling, as they were personally responsible for costs over their allotted &quot;per diem&quot;. An important component of their income was monthly flight pay, which ranged from $190 to $245 (equivalent to $ to $ in ).

The astronauts traveled to frequent meetings around the country on commercial flights, which forced them to earn their flight pay on weekends. Grissom and Slayton regularly drove to Langley Air Force Base, and attempted to fly the required four hours a month, but had to compete for T-33 aircraft with colonels and generals. Cooper traveled to McGhee Tyson Air National Guard Base in Tennessee, where a friend let him fly higher-performance F-104B jets. This came up when Cooper had lunch with William Hines, a reporter for &quot;The Washington Star&quot;, and was duly reported in the paper. Cooper then discussed the issue with Congressman James G. Fulton. The matter was taken up by the House Committee on Science and Astronautics. Within weeks the astronauts were given priority access to USAF T-33s, F-102s and F-106s at Langley. In 1962, NASA acquired a fleet of T-38s for their use.
After General Motors executive Ed Cole presented Shepard with a brand-new Chevrolet Corvette, Jim Rathmann, a race car driver who won the Indianapolis 500 in 1960 and who was a Chevrolet dealer in Melbourne, Florida, convinced Cole to turn this into an ongoing marketing campaign. Henceforth, astronauts were able to lease new Corvettes for a dollar a year. All of the Mercury Seven but Glenn took up the offer. Cooper, Grissom and Shepard were soon racing their Corvettes around Cape Canaveral, with the military and local police ignoring their exploits. From a marketing perspective, it was very successful, and helped the highly priced Corvette become established as a desirable brand.

The Mercury astronauts established the style and appearance of astronauts. &quot;I soon learned&quot;, Gene Kranz later recalled, &quot;if you saw someone wearing a short-sleeved Ban-Lon shirt and aviator sunglasses, you were looking at an astronaut.&quot; While busy with the intense training for their flights, they also drank and partied. Some had affairs with the female groupies that flocked around them. NASA actively sought to protect the astronauts and the agency from negative publicity and maintain an image of &quot;clean-cut, all-American boy[s].&quot; The seven Mercury astronauts agreed to share equally any proceeds from interviews regardless of who flew first.

They were forbidden from being compensated for radio or television appearances, or endorsing commercial products, but were allowed to sell their personal stories. In August 1959, they hired an agent, C. Leo DeOrsey, and he negotiated an exclusive contract with &quot;Life&quot; magazine on behalf of the astronauts for $500,000 () in exchange for exclusive access to their private lives, homes, and families. The money was used as life insurance. Between August, 1959, and May 15, 1963, they each received $71,428.71 (). Their official spokesman from 1959 to 1963 was NASA&#x27;s public affairs officer, USAF Lieutenant Colonel John &quot;Shorty&quot; Powers, who as a result became known in the press as the &quot;eighth astronaut&quot;.

As additional groups of astronauts were selected in the 1960s, the Mercury Seven remained in control of management decisions. The Astronaut Office, which was headed by Shepard, was one of three divisions in the Directorate of Flight Crew Operations, which was headed by Slayton. Since twenty-six of the first thirty astronauts were military personnel, the Astronaut Office had a military character, although few of the astronauts wore their uniforms even as much as once a year. There was a bi-weekly military-style pilots&#x27; meeting at which activities planned for the upcoming two weeks would be discussed. A &quot;captain&#x27;s mast&quot; was held afterwards to adjudicate disputes.

Shepard ran the Astronaut Office on a &quot;rank has its privileges&quot; basis. The Mercury and 1962 astronauts had their own allocated parking spaces outside Building 4 at Johnson Space Center, while astronauts from later groups had to compete for the remaining spaces allotted to astronauts. While Shepard prohibited junior astronauts from receiving gifts and consulting or teaching part-time, he remained vice president and part owner of the Baytown National Bank in Houston, and devoted much of his time to it.

Training was always ungraded; the Mercury astronauts had nothing to gain and much to lose from being objectively compared to the newer classes, as it could threaten their privileged status, managerial control, and priority for flight assignments. The astronaut&#x27;s attendance at their training events was voluntary. The character of the Astronaut Office would only change after Mercury astronauts retired in the 1970s, and control passed to George Abbey.

The Mercury Seven wrote first-hand accounts of their selection and preparation for the Mercury missions in the 1962 book &quot;We Seven&quot;. In 1979 Tom Wolfe published a less sanitized version of their story in &quot;The Right Stuff&quot;. Wolfe&#x27;s book was the basis for the 1983 film of the same name directed by Philip Kaufman, and the 2020 TV series of the same name.

Together with Betty Grissom, Gus Grissom&#x27;s widow, in 1984 the Mercury astronauts founded the Mercury Seven Foundation, which raises money to provide college scholarships to science and engineering students. It was renamed the Astronaut Scholarship Foundation in 1995. Shepard was elected its first president and chairman, positions which he held until October 1997, when he was succeeded by Jim Lovell. 

Glenn became the first American in orbit in 1962. In 1998 (while a sitting U.S. senator) he flew on the , and became the oldest person to fly in space at the time, aged 77. He was the last living member of the Mercury Seven when he died in 2016 at the age of 95.

Scott, Virgil, Gordon, John, and Alan Tracy from Gerry Anderson&#x27;s television series &quot;Thunderbirds&quot; were named in honor of the astronauts Carpenter, Grissom, Cooper, Glenn, and Shepherd.

== Awards and honors ==
The Mercury 7 group won the Society of Experimental Test Pilots&#x27; Iven C. Kincheloe Award in 1963. President John F. Kennedy presented the astronaut group the 1962 Collier Trophy at the White House &quot;for pioneering manned space flight in the United States&quot;. The Mercury 7 monument at Launch Complex 14, where the four Mercury-Atlas launches took place, was dedicated on November 10, 1964. A time capsule containing reports, photographs and a movie is buried beneath the monument, to be opened in 2464.

<text>Dave D. Taylor is an American game programmer, best known as a former id Software employee and noted for his work promoting Linux gaming.

==Early life==
He graduated from the University of Texas at Austin with a Bachelor of Science degree in electrical engineering in 1993. Prior to working for id, he was a member of The Kernel Group, which worked on Unix kernel debugging.

==id Software==
Taylor worked for id Software between 1993 and 1996, and was during the time involved with the development of &quot;Doom&quot; and &quot;Quake&quot;. He created ports of both games to IRIX, AIX, Solaris and Linux, and helped program the Atari Jaguar ports of &quot;Doom&quot; and &quot;Wolfenstein 3D&quot;. He also considers himself to have been the &quot;spackle coder&quot; on &quot;Doom&quot;, for adding things such as the status bar, sound library integration, the automap, level transitions, cheat codes, and the network chat system. On &quot;Quake&quot;, he wrote the original sound engine, the DOS TCP/IP network library, and added VESA 2.0 support. One of the musical themes in &quot;Doom II,&quot; &quot;The Dave D. Taylor Blues&quot;, was named after him by Robert Prince.

The 2003 book &quot;Masters of Doom: How Two Guys Created an Empire and Transformed Pop Culture&quot; mentions his habit of passing out from motion sickness after prolonged playing of &quot;Doom&quot;, and how the other employees would, after such incidents, sketch a body outline of his unconscious form with masking tape. After the success of the game, they bought him a couch to pass out on. His attempts to &quot;talk up&quot; &quot;Quake&quot; on-line, his purchase of an Acura NSX with &quot;Doom&quot; money, his friendship with American McGee, and his eventual departure from the company are also mentioned.

==After id==
Taylor founded a small game company called Crack dot Com from 1996 to 1998. Crack dot Com released only one game, &quot;Abuse&quot;, a PC platform shooter. In a 1997 interview, he claimed that he wasn&#x27;t particularly proud of &quot;Abuse&quot;, and that &quot;he set out to prove that a person could sell 50,000 copies of a so-so game.&quot; He then led the effort to build &quot;Golgotha&quot;, a first-person shooter / real-time strategy hybrid, but the company folded before its completion.

Between 1998 and 2001 he worked for Transmeta. He was president of Carbon6 from 2001 to 2002, there also working as lead designer and producer for the Game Boy Advance game &quot;Spy Kids Challenger&quot;. Since 2002 he has been vice president of Naked Sky Entertainment and since 2003 also an advisor and freelance game designer. He is also willing to act as a Linux game porter for pay projects.

In 2009, he produced &quot;Abuse Classic&quot; for the Apple iPhone and &quot;Beakiez&quot; for the PC.

<doc id="725949" wikidata="Q6510146" url="?curid=725949" title="Learning and Skills Council">
<text>The Learning and Skills Council (LSC) was a non-departmental public body jointly sponsored by the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills (BIS) and the Department for Children, Schools and Families (DCSF) in England. It closed on 31 March 2010 and was replaced by the Skills Funding Agency and the Young People&#x27;s Learning Agency.

==History==
The LSC was established in April 2001, under the Learning and Skills Act 2000. It replaced the 72 training and enterprise councils and the Further Education Funding Council for England. In 2006 it had an annual budget of £10.4 billion. It was described as Britain&#x27;s largest Quango.

Until June 2007, it was sponsored by the former Department for Education and Skills (DfES).

===Economic mismanagement in college re-building===
In July 2009, the Public Accounts Committee described the LSC&#x27;s handling of its college building programme as &#x27;catastrophic mismanagement&#x27;. It resulted in a £2.7 billion debt, with 144 college building contracts having to be terminated abruptly, and leaving many colleges with huge financial penalties for breach of contract with civil engineering companies. 23 colleges have debts of more than 40% of their annual income, with some facing possible financial collapse. The re-building programme had renovated over half of England&#x27;s colleges since 2001.

===Abolition===
On 17 March 2008 the abolition of the LSC was announced; funding responsibilities for 16- to 19-year-old learners were to transfer to Education Funding Agency and the Skills Funding Agency, which was created to distribute funding for apprentices and learners in further education colleges.

The Machinery of Government announcement heralded the end of the LSC, to make way for the Young Peoples Learning Agency and the Skills Funding Agency, reporting to DCSF and BIS respectively. These changes started in April 2009 and were completed by March 2010.

===Mark Haysom&#x27;s resignation===
Mark Haysom CBE, the second chief executive of the LSC, announced that he was stepping down from his role on 23 March 2009 - taking accountability as Chief Executive for difficulties that the LSC had encountered with a college (PFI) rebuilding programme. He was replaced by Geoff Russell, formerly of accountants KPMG.

==Function==
The LSC was responsible for planning and funding further education (post-16 education and training other than higher education) in England.

===Initiatives===
* Train to Gain in September 2006

==Organisation==
===National office===
The LSC had a national office in Cheylesmore House, Cheylesmore, Coventry, nine regional offices and 47 local Learning and Skills Council offices. The LSC&#x27;s national office was not a typical headquarters – its main role was to produce guidelines and targets for its 47 local offices.

It was announced in 2005 that the LSC&#x27;s organisation structure would change as part of the Agenda for Change programme, creating a streamlined configuration with more focus on the regional dimension. Although management and administration has been restructured on regional lines, the 47 local Learning and Skills councils were retained.

===Redundancies===
Around 1,300 jobs were lost, 500 from the Coventry headquarters, the remainder from local offices. The restructuring process was challenged by the PCS Union, with a strike that took place on 28 April 2006, and a work-to-rule commencing in May 2006. The work-to-rule ceased on 26 June 2006 after PCS and LSC representatives reached agreement.

===Staff===

During its lifetime the LSC had three chief executives: John Harwood, Mark Haysom and Geoff Russell.

===Regions===
There were nine regions.
* East of England - Ipswich
* East Midlands - Meridian Business Park (M1/M69 junction), Leicester
* London - five offices in Stratford (East), Hounslow (West), Croydon (South), Palmers Green (North), and Centre Point on New Oxford Street (Central)
* North East - Team Valley, Gateshead
* North West - Arndale Centre, Manchester
* South East - Brighton and Reading
* South West - Bristol
* West Midlands - Birmingham
* Yorkshire and the Humber - Bradford

== Criticism ==

Former leader of the CBI, Sir Digby Jones, was critical of the LSC during his time as the UK government&#x27;s skills envoy. Speaking of the LSC management and outcomes, he said: &quot;It is what I call the British Leyland model - you put a lot of money in at the top and an Austin Allegro comes out at the bottom. The money has not been spent in the right way and it is not delivering what the employers want.&quot;

There has also been significant press criticism for its handling of EMAs, capital, adult funding and numerous other areas of work especially by its own staff over its handling of various restructures and more recently its closure and transfer of powers to the 2/3 successor bodies and 150 local authorities.

==Similar organisations==
The equivalent body in Wales was ELWa. In Scotland, colleges are funded by the Scottish Funding Council.

Also in England, until 2006, there was the Learning and Skills Development Agency, which split into the Quality Improvement Agency and Learning and Skills Network in March 2006.

<text>La Pobla de Segur () is a municipality located in the comarca of Pallars Jussà, province of Lleida, Catalonia, in northern Spain. According to the 2013 census (INE), the town has a population of 3,073 inhabitants. It is situated at the confluence of the Flamicell and Noguera Pallaresa rivers in the north of the &quot;comarca&quot;, above the Sant Antoni reservoir. It is an important local service centre, which has allowed it to escape the depopulation which has affected many municipalities in northwestern Catalonia. The village is served by the C-13 road between Tremp and Sort, the N-260 road to Pont de Suert and by a railway station on a railway line to Lleida.

Famous people from La Pobla de Segur include FC Barcelona player Carles Puyol and current High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy Josep Borrell. It is a designated book town, due to the high number of bookshops in the vicinity.

== History ==
The earliest settlement in the area was to the north of the present town, known as &quot;El Pui de Segur&quot;. It was incorporated into the county of Pallars after Count Guillaume I of Toulouse conquered the region from the Moors in the ninth century. The town was transferred to its current location in the middle of the thirteenth century, and came under the control of Pere VII el Donzell, Viscount of Vilamur, in 1355. His son Pere VIII granted the first charter to the town in 1363. Control would later pass to the Dukes of Cardona.

The &quot;Comú de Particulars&quot; is a local cooperative, established in 1834 to manage a flour mill given to the town by the Duke of Cardona; open to natives of the town or their spouses, it is now a cultural organisation managing the income from the local hydroelectric power station. The &quot;Torre Maure&quot; is a notable group of &quot;modernista&quot; buildings from the start of the twentieth century.

<text>Operation Tannenbaum (&quot;Fir Tree&quot;), known earlier as Operation Grün (&quot;Green&quot;), was a planned invasion of Switzerland and Liechtenstein by the Axis Powers during World War II.

==Background==
Before the outbreak of the Second World War, Adolf Hitler made repeated assurances that Germany would respect Swiss neutrality in the event of a conflict in Europe. In February 1937, he assured the Swiss Federal Councillor Edmund Schulthess that &quot;at all times, whatever happens, we will respect the inviolability and neutrality of Switzerland&quot;, reiterating this promise shortly before the German invasion of Poland. These were, however, purely political maneuvers intended to guarantee Switzerland&#x27;s passivity. Nazi Germany planned to end Switzerland&#x27;s independence after it had defeated its enemies on the continent.

===Nazi attitudes towards Switzerland===
In a meeting held with Fascist Italy&#x27;s leader, Benito Mussolini, and foreign minister, Galeazzo Ciano, in June 1941, Hitler stated his opinion on Switzerland quite plainly:

In a later discussion, the German Foreign Minister Joachim von Ribbentrop directly alluded to the possibility of dividing Switzerland between the two Axis powers:

In August 1942, Hitler further described Switzerland as &quot;a pimple on the face of Europe&quot; and as a state that no longer had a right to exist, denouncing the Swiss people as &quot;a misbegotten branch of our &quot;Volk&quot;.&quot; From a Nazi viewpoint, Switzerland, as a small, multilingual, decentralized democracy where German-speakers felt more of an affinity with their French-speaking fellow Swiss citizens than towards the German speaking people living across the border, was the antithesis of the racially homogeneous and collectivised &quot;Führer State&quot;. Hitler also believed that the independent Swiss state had come into existence at a time of temporary weakness of the Holy Roman Empire, and now that German power had been re-established after the National Socialist takeover, the independent country of Switzerland had become obsolete.

Although Hitler despised the democratically minded German Swiss as the &quot;wayward branch of the German people&quot;, he still acknowledged their status as Germans. Furthermore, the openly pan-German political aims of the Nazi party called for the unification of all Germans into a Greater Germany, which included the Swiss people. The first goal of the 25-point National Socialist Program stated that &quot;We [the National Socialist Party] demand the unification of all Germans in the Greater Germany on the basis of the people&#x27;s right to self-determination.&quot;

In their maps of Greater Germany, German textbooks included the Netherlands, Belgium, Austria, Bohemia-Moravia, the German-speaking parts of Switzerland, and western Poland from Danzig (Gdańsk in Polish) to Krakau (Kraków). Ignoring Switzerland&#x27;s status as a sovereign state, these maps frequently showed its territory as a German &quot;Gau&quot;. The author of one of these textbooks, Ewald Banse, explained &quot;Quite naturally we count you Swiss as offshoots of the German nation, along with the Dutch, the Flemings, the Lorrainers, the Alsatians, the Austrians and the Bohemians ... One day we will group ourselves around a single banner, and whosoever shall wish to separate us, we will exterminate!&quot; Various Nazis were vocal about the German intent to &quot;expand Germany&#x27;s boundaries to the farthest limits of the old Holy Roman Empire, and even beyond.&quot;

Although the geopolitician Karl Haushofer was not politically aligned with the Nazis, his ideas offered them ideological support. In his work, he advocated for the partition of Switzerland among its surrounding countries, such that the Romandy (&quot;Welschland&quot;) would be awarded to Vichy France, Ticino to Italy, and Northern, Central, and Eastern Switzerland to Germany.

=== Nazi attitudes toward Liechtenstein ===
Shortly after the Anschluss of Austria, the Volksdeutsche Mittelstelle, in connection with the German National Movement in Liechtenstein (VDBL), a Nazi organization in Liechtenstein, planned for the VBDL to be democratically elected into power via funding from Germany, then it would end the customs union with Switzerland and align towards Germany, leading to an eventual annexation of Liechtenstein into Germany. The plans were reportedly supported by Joseph Goebbels. However, it was personally blocked by Adolf Hitler himself on 18 March 1938 as he did not want to complicate relations with Switzerland.

In March 1939, Franz Joseph II, Prince of Liechtenstein along with Josef Hoop and his government paid an official visit to Berlin where they met Hitler and Ribbentrop to discuss safeguarding Liechtenstein&#x27;s independence and ensuring good relations. Franz Joseph later reminisced on the visit and stated that Hitler showed little interest in them and that it only took place in order to &quot;flatter Hitler&#x27;s ego&quot;.

However, in the same month the VBDL staged a coup attempt in which it was planned for VBDL members to march on Vaduz and seize control of the government, which was hoped to cause clashes between them and the government. German troops from Feldkirch would then move into Liechtenstein after a call for help and incorporate the country into Germany. However, this plan failed as the marchers were stopped by opposing parties before they could reach Vaduz and Hitler blocked any invasion into Liechtenstein following intervention by Alois Vogt.

Despite this, the coup was only prevented by Hitler due to his desire to avoid provoking a war with Switzerland, as Switzerland and Liechtenstein had been in a customs union since 1924. Liechtenstein was intended to be invaded alongside Switzerland and be included in the partitioning, where Liechtenstein would be annexed into Germany.

==Military preparations==
The Swiss government approved an increase in defense spending, with a first instalment of 15 million Swiss francs (out of a total multi-year budget of 100 million francs) to go toward modernization of the armed forces. With Hitler&#x27;s renunciation of the Treaty of Versailles in 1935, this spending jumped to 90 million francs. The K31 became the standard-issue infantry rifle in 1933, and was superior to the German Kar98 in ease of use, accuracy, and weight. By the end of World War II, nearly 350,000 would be produced. 

Switzerland has a unique form of generalship. In peacetime, there is no officer with a rank higher than that of &quot;Korpskommandant&quot; (3-star-general). However, in times of war and in &#x27;need&#x27;, the &quot;Bundesversammlung&quot; elects a &quot;General&quot; to command the army and air force. On 30 August 1939, Henri Guisan was elected &quot;General&quot;, with 204 votes out of 227 cast. He immediately began preparations for war.

When, two days after his election, the &quot;Wehrmacht&quot; invaded Poland and World War II began, Guisan called for a general mobilisation and issued &quot;Operationsbefehl&quot; Nr. 1, the first of what was to become a series of evolving defensive plans. This first plan assigned the existing three army corps to the east, north, and west of Switzerland, with reserves in the centre and south of the country. Guisan reported to the Federal Council on September 7 that by the time Britain declared war on Germany, &quot;our entire army had been in its operational positions for ten minutes.&quot; He also had his Chief of the General Staff increase the upper service eligibility age from 48 to 60 years (men of these ages would form the rear-echelon &quot;Landsturm&quot; units), and ordered the formation of an entirely new army corps of 100,000 men.

Germany started planning the invasion of Switzerland on 25 June 1940, the day that France surrendered. At this point, the German army in France consisted of three groups with two million soldiers in 102 divisions. Recognizing that Switzerland and Liechtenstein were surrounded by Occupied France and the Axis Powers, Guisan issued &quot;Operationsbefehl&quot; Nr. 10, a complete overhaul of existing Swiss defensive plans. In this plan, the Fortress Saint-Maurice, the Gotthard Pass in the south, and the Fortress Sargans in the northeast would serve as the defence line. The Alps would be their fortress. The Swiss 2nd, 3rd, and 4th Army Corps were to stage delaying actions at the border, while all who were able were to retreat to the Alpine refuge known as the &quot;Réduit national&quot;. The population centres were, however, all located in the flat plains in the north of the country. They would have to be abandoned to the German forces in order for the rest of the country to survive.

After the armistice with France, Hitler demanded to see plans for the invasion of Switzerland. Franz Halder, the head of the &quot;Oberkommando des Heeres&quot; (OKH), recalled: &quot;I was constantly hearing of outbursts of Hitler&#x27;s fury against Switzerland, which, given his mentality, might have led at any minute to military activities for the army.&quot; Captain Otto-Wilhelm Kurt von Menges in OKH submitted a draft plan for the invasion. &quot;Generaloberst&quot; Wilhelm Ritter von Leeb&#x27;s &quot;Heeresgruppe &#x27;C&quot; (HGr. C), led by &quot;Generalleutnant&quot; Wilhelm List and the 12th Army would conduct the attack. Leeb himself personally reconnoitered the terrain, studying the most promising invasion routes and paths of least resistance. Menges noted in his plan that Swiss resistance was unlikely and that a nonviolent &quot;Anschluss&quot; was the most likely result. With &quot;the current political situation in Switzerland,&quot; he wrote, &quot;it might accede to ultimatum demands in a peaceful manner, so that after a warlike border crossing a rapid transition to a peaceful invasion must be assured.&quot;

The German plan continued to undergo revision until October, when the 12th Army submitted its fourth draft, now called Operation Tannenbaum. The original plan had called for 21 German divisions, but that figure was downsized to 11 by the OKH. Halder himself had studied the border areas, and concluded that the &quot;Jura frontier offers no favorable base for an attack. Switzerland rises, in successive waves of forest-covered terrain across the axis of an attack. The crossing points on the river Doubs and the border are few; the Swiss frontier position is strong.&quot; He decided on an infantry feint in the Jura in order to draw out the Swiss Army and then cut it off in the rear, as had been done in France. With the 11 German divisions and roughly 15 more Italian divisions prepared to enter from the south, the Axis plans were to invade Switzerland with somewhere between 300,000 and 500,000 men.

For reasons that are still uncertain, Hitler never ordered the invasion. One theory is that a neutral Switzerland would have been useful to hide Nazi gold and to serve as a refuge for war criminals in case of defeat. This may also explain Germany&#x27;s continued recognition of Switzerland&#x27;s neutrality. One simpler explanation is that there would have been little strategic gain in conquering Switzerland, while a drawn-out and costly alpine war might well have ensued. Another is that Nazi Germany was too preoccupied with other military matters. Although the &quot;Wehrmacht&quot; feigned moves against Switzerland in its offensives, it never attempted to invade. After D-Day, Operation Tannenbaum was put on hold.

==German plans for Nazi rule in Switzerland==
Germany&#x27;s political objective in the expected conquest of Switzerland was to regain the bulk of the &quot;racially suitable&quot; Swiss population for the German people, and aimed at direct annexation into the German Reich of at least its ethnic German parts.

With this purpose in mind, Heinrich Himmler in September 1941 discussed with his subordinate, Gottlob Berger, the suitability of various people for the position of &quot;Reichskommissar&quot; for the &#x27;reunion&#x27; of Switzerland with Germany. This yet-to-be-chosen official would have had the task of facilitating the total amalgamation (&quot;Zusammenwachsen&quot;) of the Swiss and German populations. Himmler further attempted to expand the SS into Switzerland, with the formation of the &quot;Germanische SS Schweiz&quot; in 1942.

A document named &quot;Aktion S&quot;, found in the Himmler files, detailed at length the planned process for the establishment of Nazi rule in Switzerland from its initial conquest by the &quot;Wehrmacht&quot; up to its complete consolidation as a German province. It is not known whether this plan was endorsed by any high-level members of the German government.

After the Second Armistice at Compiègne in June 1940, the German Interior Ministry produced a memorandum on the annexation of a strip of eastern France from the mouth of the Somme river to Lake Geneva, intended as a reserve for post-war German colonisation. The planned dissection of Switzerland would have accorded with this new French-German border, annexing the French-speaking region of Romandy into the Reich despite the linguistic difference.

===Italian involvement===
Germany&#x27;s wartime ally Italy, under the rule of Benito Mussolini, desired the Italian-speaking areas of Switzerland as part of its irredentist claims in Europe, particularly the Swiss cantons of Ticino and Grisons. In a tour of the Italian alpine regions, Mussolini stated to his entourage that &quot;the New Europe ... could not have more than four or five large states; the small ones [would] have no further &quot;raison d&#x27;être&quot; and [would] have to disappear&quot;.

Switzerland&#x27;s future in an Axis-dominated Europe was further discussed in a 1940 round-table conference between Italian foreign minister Galeazzo Ciano and German foreign minister Joachim von Ribbentrop, also attended by Hitler. Ciano proposed that in the event of Switzerland&#x27;s dissolution, it should be divided along the central chain of the Western Alps, since Italy desired the areas to the south of this demarcation line as part of its own war aims. This would have left Italy in control of Ticino, Valais, and Graubünden.

<doc id="725961" wikidata="Q6961530" url="?curid=725961" title="Name mangling">
<text>In compiler construction, name mangling (also called name decoration) is a technique used to solve various problems caused by the need to resolve unique names for programming entities in many modern programming languages.

It provides means to encode added information in the name of a function, structure, class or another data type, to pass more semantic information from the compiler to the linker.

The need for name mangling arises where a language allows different entities to be named with the same identifier as long as they occupy a different namespace (typically defined by a module, class, or explicit &quot;namespace&quot; directive) or have different type signatures (such as in function overloading). It is required in these uses because each signature might require different, specialized calling convention in the machine code.

Any object code produced by compilers is usually linked with other pieces of object code (produced by the same or another compiler) by a type of program called a linker. The linker needs a great deal of information on each program entity. For example, to correctly link a function it needs its name, the number of arguments and their types, and so on.

The simple programming languages of the 1970s, like C, only distinguished subroutines by their name, ignoring other information including parameter and return types.
Later languages, like C++, defined stricter requirements for routines to be considered &quot;equal&quot;, such as the parameter types, return type, and calling convention of a function. These requirements enable method overloading and detection of some bugs (such as using different definitions of a function when compiling different source code files).
These stricter requirements needed to work with extant programming tools and conventions. Thus, added requirements were encoded in the name of the symbol, since that was the only information a traditional linker had about a symbol.

== Examples ==
=== C ===
Although name mangling is not generally required or used by languages that do not support function overloading, like C and classic Pascal, they use it in some cases to provide added information about a function.
For example, compilers targeted at Microsoft Windows platforms support a variety of calling conventions, which determine the manner in which parameters are sent to subroutines and results are returned. Because the different calling conventions are incompatible with one another, compilers mangle symbols with codes detailing which convention should be used to call the specific routine.

The mangling scheme for Windows was established by Microsoft and has been informally followed by other compilers including Digital Mars, Borland, and GNU Compiler Collection (GCC) when compiling code for the Windows platforms. The scheme even applies to other languages, such as Pascal, D, Delphi, Fortran, and C#. This allows subroutines written in those languages to call, or be called by, extant Windows libraries using a calling convention different from their default.

When compiling the following C examples:

int _cdecl f (int x) { return 0; }
int _stdcall g (int y) { return 0; }
int _fastcall h (int z) { return 0; }
32-bit compilers emit, respectively:

 _f
 _g@4
 @h@4

In the and mangling schemes, the function is encoded as codice_1 and codice_2 respectively, where is the number of bytes, in decimal, of the argument(s) in the parameter list (including those passed in registers, for fastcall). In the case of , the function name is merely prefixed by an underscore.

The 64-bit convention on Windows (Microsoft C) has no leading underscore. This difference may in some rare cases lead to unresolved externals when porting such code to 64 bits. For example, Fortran code can use &#x27;alias&#x27; to link against a C method by name as follows:
SUBROUTINE f()
!DEC$ ATTRIBUTES C, ALIAS:&#x27;_f&#x27; :: f
END SUBROUTINE
This will compile and link fine under 32 bits, but generate an unresolved external codice_3 under 64 bits. One workaround for this is not to use &#x27;alias&#x27; at all (in which the method names typically need to be capitalized in C and Fortran). Another is to use the BIND option:
SUBROUTINE f() BIND(C,NAME=&quot;f&quot;)
END SUBROUTINE

In C, most compilers also mangle static functions and variables (and in C++ functions and variables declared static or put in the anonymous namespace) in translation units using the same mangling rules as for their non-static versions. If functions with the same name (and parameters for C++) are also defined and used in different translation units, it will also mangle to the same name, potentially leading to a clash. However, they will not be equivalent if they are called in their respective translation units. Compilers are usually free to emit arbitrary mangling for these functions, because it is illegal to access these from other translation units directly, so they will never need linking between different object code (linking of them is never needed). To prevent linking conflicts, compilers will use standard mangling, but will use so-called &#x27;local&#x27; symbols. When linking many such translation units there might be multiple definitions of a function with the same name, but resulting code will only call one or another depending on which translation unit it came from. This is usually done using the relocation mechanism.

=== C++ ===

C++ compilers are the most widespread users of name mangling. The first C++ compilers were implemented as translators to C source code, which would then be compiled by a C compiler to object code; because of this, symbol names had to conform to C identifier rules. Even later, with the emergence of compilers that produced machine code or assembly directly, the system&#x27;s linker generally did not support C++ symbols, and mangling was still required.

The C++ language does not define a standard decoration scheme, so each compiler uses its own. C++ also has complex language features, such as classes, templates, namespaces, and operator overloading, that alter the meaning of specific symbols based on context or usage. Meta-data about these features can be disambiguated by mangling (decorating) the name of a symbol. Because the name-mangling systems for such features are not standardized across compilers, few linkers can link object code that was produced by different compilers.

====Simple example====
A single C++ translation unit might define two functions named :
int f () { return 1; }
int f (int) { return 0; }
void g () { int i = f(), j = f(0); }
These are distinct functions, with no relation to each other apart from the name. The C++ compiler will therefore encode the type information in the symbol name, the result being something resembling:
int __f_v () { return 1; }
int __f_i (int) { return 0; } 
void __g_v () { int i = __f_v(), j = __f_i(0); }
Even though its name is unique, is still mangled: name mangling applies to &quot;all&quot; C++ symbols (except for those in an extern &quot;C&quot;{} block).

====Complex example====
The mangled symbols in this example, in the comments below the respective identifier name, are those produced by the GNU GCC 3.x compilers, according to the IA-64 (Itanium) ABI:
namespace wikipedia 
 class article 
 public:
 std::string format (); // = _ZN9wikipedia7article6formatEv

 bool print_to (std::ostream&amp;); // = _ZN9wikipedia7article8print_toERSo

 class wikilink 
 public:
 wikilink (std::string const&amp; name); // = _ZN9wikipedia7article8wikilinkC1ERKSs
 };


All mangled symbols begin with (note that an identifier beginning with an underscore followed by a capital letter is a reserved identifier in C, so conflict with user identifiers is avoided); for nested names (including both namespaces and classes), this is followed by , then a series of &lt;length, id&gt; pairs (the length being the length of the next identifier), and finally . For example, becomes:

 _ZN9wikipedia7article6formatE

For functions, this is then followed by the type information; as is a function, this is simply ; hence:

 _ZN9wikipedia7article6formatEv

For , the standard type (which is a for ) is used, which has the special alias ; a reference to this type is therefore , with the complete name for the function being:

 _ZN9wikipedia7article8print_toERSo

====How different compilers mangle the same functions====
There isn&#x27;t a standardized scheme by which even trivial C++ identifiers are mangled, and consequently different compilers (or even different versions of the same compiler, or the same compiler on different platforms) mangle public symbols in radically different (and thus totally incompatible) ways. Consider how different C++ compilers mangle the same functions:
Notes:
*The Compaq C++ compiler on OpenVMS VAX and Alpha (but not IA-64) and Tru64 UNIX has two name mangling schemes. The original, pre-standard scheme is known as the ARM model, and is based on the name mangling described in the C++ Annotated Reference Manual (ARM). With the advent of new features in standard C++, particularly templates, the ARM scheme became more and more unsuitable – it could not encode certain function types, or produced identically mangled names for different functions. It was therefore replaced by the newer &quot;American National Standards Institute&quot; (ANSI) model, which supported all ANSI template features, but was not backward compatible.
*On IA-64, a standard application binary interface (ABI) exists (see external links), which defines (among other things) a standard name-mangling scheme, and which is used by all the IA-64 compilers. GNU GCC 3.&quot;x&quot; has further adopted the name mangling scheme defined in this standard for use on other, non-Intel platforms.
*The Visual Studio and Windows SDK include the program which prints the C-style function prototype for a given mangled name.
*On Microsoft Windows, the Intel compiler and Clang uses the Visual C++ name mangling for compatibility.

====Handling of C symbols when linking from C++====
The job of the common C++ idiom:
#ifdef __cplusplus 
extern &quot;C&quot; {
#endif
#ifdef __cplusplus
#endif
is to ensure that the symbols within are &quot;unmangled&quot; – that the compiler emits a binary file with their names undecorated, as a C compiler would do. As C language definitions are unmangled, the C++ compiler needs to avoid mangling references to these identifiers.

For example, the standard strings library, , usually contains something resembling:
#ifdef __cplusplus
extern &quot;C&quot; {
#endif

void *memset (void *, int, size_t);
char *strcat (char *, const char *);
int strcmp (const char *, const char *);
char *strcpy (char *, const char *);

#ifdef __cplusplus
#endif
Thus, code such as:
if (strcmp(argv[1], &quot;-x&quot;) == 0) 
 strcpy(a, argv[2]);
else 
 memset (a, 0, sizeof(a));
uses the correct, unmangled and . If the had not been used, the (SunPro) C++ compiler would produce code equivalent to:
if (__1cGstrcmp6Fpkc1_i_(argv[1], &quot;-x&quot;) == 0) 
 __1cGstrcpy6Fpcpkc_0_(a, argv[2]);
else 
 __1cGmemset6FpviI_0_ (a, 0, sizeof(a));
Since those symbols do not exist in the C runtime library (&quot;e.g.&quot; libc), link errors would result.

====Standardized name mangling in C++====
It would seem that standardized name mangling in the C++ language would lead to greater interoperability between compiler implementations. However, such a standardization by itself would not suffice to guarantee C++ compiler interoperability and it might even create a false impression that interoperability is possible and safe when it isn&#x27;t. Name mangling is only one of several application binary interface (ABI) details that need to be decided and observed by a C++ implementation. Other ABI aspects like exception handling, virtual table layout, structure, and stack frame padding also cause differing C++ implementations to be incompatible. Further, requiring a particular form of mangling would cause issues for systems where implementation limits (e.g., length of symbols) dictate a particular mangling scheme. A standardized &quot;requirement&quot; for name mangling would also prevent an implementation where mangling was not required at all – for example, a linker that understood the C++ language.

The C++ standard therefore does not attempt to standardize name mangling. On the contrary, the &quot;Annotated C++ Reference Manual&quot; (also known as &quot;ARM&quot;, , section 7.2.1c) actively encourages the use of different mangling schemes to prevent linking when other aspects of the ABI are incompatible.

Nevertheless, as detailed in the section above, on some platforms the full C++ ABI has been standardized, including name mangling.

====Real-world effects of C++ name mangling====
Because C++ symbols are routinely exported from DLL and shared object files, the name mangling scheme is not merely a compiler-internal matter. Different compilers (or different versions of the same compiler, in many cases) produce such binaries under different name decoration schemes, meaning that symbols are frequently unresolved if the compilers used to create the library and the program using it employed different schemes. For example, if a system with multiple C++ compilers installed (e.g., GNU GCC and the OS vendor&#x27;s compiler) wished to install the Boost C++ Libraries, it would have to be compiled multiple times (once for GCC and once for the vendor compiler).

It is good for safety purposes that compilers producing incompatible object codes (codes based on different ABIs, regarding e.g., classes and exceptions) use different name mangling schemes. This guarantees that these incompatibilities are detected at the linking phase, not when executing the software (which could lead to obscure bugs and serious stability issues).

For this reason, name decoration is an important aspect of any C++-related ABI.

There are instances, particularly in large, complex code bases, where it can be difficult or impractical to map the mangled name emitted within a linker error message back to the particular corresponding token/variable-name in the source. This problem can make identifying the relevant source file(s) very difficult for build or test engineers even if only one compiler and linker are in use. Demanglers (including those within the linker error reporting mechanisms) sometimes help but the mangling mechanism itself may discard critical disambiguating information.

====Demangle via c++filt====

$ c++filt -n _ZNK3MapI10StringName3RefI8GDScriptE10ComparatorIS0_E16DefaultAllocatorE3hasERKS0_
Map&lt;StringName, Ref&lt;GDScript&gt;, Comparator&lt;StringName&gt;, DefaultAllocator&gt;::has(StringName const&amp;) const
====Demangle via builtin GCC ABI====

#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
#include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;
#include &lt;cxxabi.h&gt;

int main() {
 const char *mangled_name = &quot;_ZNK3MapI10StringName3RefI8GDScriptE10ComparatorIS0_E16DefaultAllocatorE3hasERKS0_&quot;;
 int status = -1;
 char *demangled_name = abi::__cxa_demangle(mangled_name, NULL, NULL, &amp;status);
 printf(&quot;Demangled: %s\n&quot;, demangled_name);
 free(demangled_name);
 return 0;


Output: 

=== Java ===
In Java, the &quot;signature&quot; of a method or a class contains its name and the types of its method arguments and return value, where applicable. The format of signatures is documented, as the language, compiler, and .class file format were all designed together (and had object-orientation and universal interoperability in mind from the start).

====Creating unique names for inner and anonymous classes====
The scope of anonymous classes is confined to their parent class, so the compiler must produce a &quot;qualified&quot; public name for the inner class, to avoid conflict where other classes with the same name (inner or not) exist in the same namespace. Similarly, anonymous classes must have &quot;fake&quot; public names generated for them (as the concept of anonymous classes only exists in the compiler, not the runtime). So, compiling the following Java program:
public class foo {
 class bar {
 public int x;

 public void zark () {
 Object f = new Object () {
 public String toString() {
 return &quot;hello&quot;;
 };
}
will produce three .class files:
* foo.class, containing the main (outer) class &quot;foo&quot;
* foo$bar.class, containing the named inner class &quot;foo.bar&quot;
* foo$1.class, containing the anonymous inner class (local to method &quot;foo.zark&quot;)

All of these class names are valid (as $ symbols are permitted in the JVM specification) and these names are &quot;safe&quot; for the compiler to generate, as the Java language definition advises not to use $ symbols in normal java class definitions.

Name resolution in Java is further complicated at runtime, as fully qualified names for classes are unique only inside a specific classloader instance. Classloaders are ordered hierarchically and each Thread in the JVM has a so-called context class loader, so in cases where two different classloader instances contain classes with the same name, the system first tries to load the class using the root (or system) classloader and then goes down the hierarchy to the context class loader.

====Java Native Interface====
Java Native Interface, Java&#x27;s native method support, allows Java language programs to call out to programs written in another language (usually C or C++). There are two name-resolution concerns here, neither of which is implemented in a standardized manner:

* JVM to native name translation - this seems to be more stable, since Oracle makes its scheme public.
* Normal C++ name mangling - see above.

=== Python ===
In Python, mangling is used for class attributes that one does not want subclasses to use which are designated as such by giving them a name with two or more leading underscores and no more than one trailing underscore. For example, will be mangled, as will and , but and will not. Python&#x27;s runtime does not restrict access to such attributes, the mangling only prevents name collisions if a derived class defines an attribute with the same name.

On encountering name mangled attributes, Python transforms these names by prepending a single underscore and the name of the enclosing class, for example:
»&gt; class Test:
... def __mangled_name(self):
... pass
... def normal_name(self):
... pass
»&gt; t = Test()
»&gt; [attr for attr in dir(t) if &quot;name&quot; in attr]
[&#x27;_Test__mangled_name&#x27;, &#x27;normal_name&#x27;]
=== Pascal ===

====Turbo Pascal, Delphi====

To avoid name mangling in Pascal, use:
exports
 myFunc name &#x27;myFunc&#x27;,
 myProc name &#x27;myProc&#x27;;
====Free Pascal====
Free Pascal supports function and operator overloading, thus it also uses name mangling to support these features. On the other hand, Free Pascal is capable of calling symbols defined in external modules created with another language and exporting its own symbols to be called by another language. For further information, consult Chapter 6.2 and 7.1 of Free Pascal Programmer&#x27;s Guide.

=== Fortran ===
Name mangling is also necessary in Fortran compilers, originally because the language is case insensitive. Further mangling requirements were imposed later in the evolution of the language because of the addition of modules and other features in the Fortran 90 standard. The case mangling, especially, is a common issue that must be dealt with to call Fortran libraries, such as LAPACK, from other languages, such as C.

Because of the case insensitivity, the name of a subroutine or function must be converted to a standardized case and format by the compiler so that it will be linked in the same way regardless of case. Different compilers have implemented this in various ways, and no standardization has occurred. The AIX and HP-UX Fortran compilers convert all identifiers to lower case , while the Cray and Unicos Fortran compilers converted identifiers to all upper case . The GNU g77 compiler converts identifiers to lower case plus an underscore , except that identifiers already containing an underscore have two underscores appended , following a convention established by f2c. Many other compilers, including Silicon Graphics&#x27;s (SGI) IRIX compilers, GNU Fortran, and Intel&#x27;s Fortran compiler (except on Microsoft Windows), convert all identifiers to lower case plus an underscore ( and , respectively). On Microsoft Windows, the Intel Fortran compiler defaults to uppercase without an underscore.

Identifiers in Fortran 90 modules must be further mangled, because the same procedure name may occur in different modules. Since the Fortran 2003 Standard requires that module procedure names not conflict with other external symbols, compilers tend to use the module name and the procedure name, with a distinct marker in between. For example:
module m 
contains
 integer function five()
 five = 5
 end function five
end module m
In this module, the name of the function will be mangled as (e.g., GNU Fortran), (e.g., Intel&#x27;s ifort), (e.g., Oracle&#x27;s sun95), etc. Since Fortran does not allow overloading the name of a procedure, but uses generic interface blocks and generic type-bound procedures instead, the mangled names do not need to incorporate clues about the arguments.

The Fortran 2003 BIND option overrides any name mangling done by the compiler, as shown above.

=== Rust ===

Function names are mangled by default in Rust. However, this can be disabled by the function attribute. This attribute can be used to export functions to C, C++, or Objective-C. Further, along with the function attribute or the crate attribute, it allows the user to define a C-style entry point for the program.

Rust has used many versions of symbol mangling schemes that can be selected at compile time with an option. The following manglers are defined:

* A C++ style mangling based on the Itanium IA-64 C++ ABI. Symbols begin with , and filename hashes are used for disambiguation. Used since Rust 1.9.
* An improved version of the legacy scheme, with changes for Rust. Symbols begin with . Polymorphism can be encoded. Functions don&#x27;t have return types encoded (Rust does not have overloading). Unicode names use modified punycode. Compression (backreference) use byte-based addressing. Used since Rust 1.37.

Examples are provided in the Rust tests.

=== Objective-C ===
Essentially two forms of method exist in Objective-C, the class (&quot;static&quot;) method, and the instance method. A method declaration in Objective-C is of the following form:

 + (&quot;return-type&quot;) &quot;name&quot;0:&quot;parameter&quot;0 &quot;name&quot;1:&quot;parameter&quot;1 ...
 – (&quot;return-type&quot;) &quot;name&quot;0:&quot;parameter&quot;0 &quot;name&quot;1:&quot;parameter&quot;1 ...

Class methods are signified by +, instance methods use -. A typical class method declaration may then look like:
+ (id) initWithX: (int) number andY: (int) number;
+ (id) new;
With instance methods looking like this:
- (id) value;
- (id) setValue: (id) new_value;
Each of these method declarations have a specific internal representation. When compiled, each method is named according to the following scheme for class methods:

 _c_&quot;Class&quot;_&quot;name&quot;0_&quot;name&quot;1_ ...

and this for instance methods:

 _i_&quot;Class&quot;_&quot;name&quot;0_&quot;name&quot;1_ ...

The colons in the Objective-C syntax are translated to underscores. So, the Objective-C class method , if belonging to the class would translate as , and the instance method (belonging to the same class) would translate to .

Each of the methods of a class are labeled in this way. However, to look up a method that a class may respond to would be tedious if all methods are represented in this fashion. Each of the methods is assigned a unique symbol (such as an integer). Such a symbol is known as a &quot;selector&quot;. In Objective-C, one can manage selectors directly – they have a specific type in Objective-C – .

During compiling, a table is built that maps the textual representation, such as , to selectors (which are given a type ). Managing selectors is more efficient than manipulating the text representation of a method. Note that a selector only matches a method&#x27;s name, not the class it belongs to: different classes can have different implementations of a method with the same name. Because of this, implementations of a method are given a specific identifier too, these are known as implementation pointers, and are also given a type, .

Message sends are encoded by the compiler as calls to the function, or one of its cousins, where is the receiver of the message, and determines the method to call. Each class has its own table that maps selectors to their implementations – the implementation pointer specifies where in memory the implementation of the method resides. There are separate tables for class and instance methods. Apart from being stored in the to lookup tables, the functions are essentially anonymous.

The value for a selector does not vary between classes. This enables polymorphism.

The Objective-C runtime maintains information about the argument and return types of methods. However, this information is not part of the name of the method, and can vary from class to class.

Since Objective-C does not support namespaces, there is no need for the mangling of class names (that do appear as symbols in generated binaries).

=== Swift ===
Swift keeps metadata about functions (and more) in the mangled symbols referring to them. This metadata includes the function&#x27;s name, attributes, module name, parameter types, return type, and more. For example:

The mangled name for a method of a class in module is , for 2014 Swift. The components and their meanings are as follows:

* : The prefix for all Swift symbols. Everything will start with this.
* : Non-curried function.
* : Function of a class, i.e. a method
* : Module name, prefixed with its length.
* : Name of class the function belongs to, prefixed with its length.
* : Function name, prefixed with its length.
* : The function attribute. In this case ‘f’, which means a normal function.
* : Designates the type of the first parameter (namely the class instance) as the first in the type stack (here is not nested and thus has index 0).
* : This begins the type list for the parameter tuple of the function.
* : External name of first parameter of the function.
* : Indicates builtin Swift type Swift.Int for the first parameter.
* : The return type: again Swift.Int.

Mangling for versions since Swift 4.0 is documented officially. It retains some similarity to Itanium.

<doc id="725962" wikidata="Q2295246" url="?curid=725962" title="Hellions (Marvel Comics)">
<text>Several fictional groups of mutants have used the name the Hellions in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. The Hellions have always been portrayed as rivals of various teams of younger mutant heroes in the X-Men franchise, initially as actual villains and later on a team that was more of a school rival than actual enemies of the X-Men.

The first and most notable incarnation of the Hellions were students of Emma Frost and the Hellfire Club&#x27;s Massachusetts Academy, and were rivals of the New Mutants. The original Hellions first appeared in &quot;New Mutants&quot; #16 (June 1984), created by writer Chris Claremont and artist Sal Buscema. This version of the Hellions ended after an attack by Trevor Fitzroy and a squadron of Sentinels that killed several Hellions.

Two later groups known as the Hellions or New Hellions both fought against various X groups such as Generation X and X-Force. In &quot;New X-Men: Academy X&quot; (2004), a new group of Hellions were introduced. This time they were a part of the Xavier Institute for Higher Learning – the Hellions were one of several factions that the students were divided into including the New Mutants, with whom they had a rivalry. The Hellions were also the focus of a miniseries titled &quot;New X-Men: Hellions&quot; (2005). After the majority of mutants lost their powers in the &quot;Decimation&quot; storyline, the students were combined into one squad as the number of mutants was greatly reduced.

During the Krakoan Age, as part of the &quot;Dawn of X&quot; publishing initiative, a new ongoing series titled &quot;Hellions&quot; launched in March 2020 which focused on the most dangerous mutant outcasts. It ended with issue #18 in December 2021 during the &quot;Reign of X&quot; publishing initiative.

==Hellions (Massachusetts Academy)==
The original group of Hellions were apprentices of the Hellfire Club and students of its White Queen (Emma Frost). While attending classes at Frost&#x27;s Massachusetts Academy, these young mutants secretly trained in the use of their powers in an underground complex beneath the school. They were longtime rivals of Professor Charles Xavier&#x27;s students, the New Mutants, and once held their own against the X-Men. The original Hellions were:

* Catseye (Sharon Smith), an American girl who could transform her body into a purple feline or semi-feline state and shift her size between that of a house cat or a panther. This granted her razor sharp claws, enhanced senses and physical attributes, plus a prehensile tail. Catseye originally believed she was a cat with the ability to transform into a human.
* Empath (Manuel de la Rocha); a handsome, yet cruel and arrogant young Spanish man with the ability to sense and manipulate the emotions of others. 
* Jetstream (Haroum ibn Sallah al-Rashid), from Morocco, could generate bio-thermal energy that allowed him to propel himself through the air and move at superhuman speeds. Aided in flight by bionically implanted jets that focus his energies and a cybernetic guidance system.
* Roulette (Jennifer Stavros), an American girl from Atlantic City who could psionically influence probabilities, usually through colored disks of energy she generated and threw towards her targets: white disks for good luck, black disks for bad.
* Tarot (Mari-Ange Colbert), a good-natured girl from Lyons, France who had the ability to see past and future events of other people due to a combination of her mutant powers and her tarot cards. She could also materialize and animate tangible images of the 2-D avatars/images on her tarot cards. Once materialized they were completely under her mental control and could do her bidding, including aiding her in battle and flight. 
* Thunderbird (James Proudstar), the younger brother of deceased X-Man John Proudstar (the original Thunderbird), who possessed similar superhuman physical attributes, senses, and a healing ability. He reformed and has served on the several X-Men teams under the codename Warpath, and is currently a member of the X-Men.

White Queen Emma Frost had another potential Hellion in Firestar (Angelica Jones), but kept the girl from joining the team on field missions while grooming her to be Frost&#x27;s personal assassin. Firestar eventually learned of Frost&#x27;s plans and left the Massachusetts Academy.

After suffering a severe trauma at the hands of the Beyonder, a number of the New Mutants were transferred to the Massachusetts Academy by Magneto (then headmaster of Xavier&#x27;s School for Gifted Youngsters), due to their apparent need for psychic therapy from Emma Frost. While at the academy, the transferred New Mutants — Cannonball, Wolfsbane, Karma, Cypher, Magik, and Magma — were inducted into the Hellions. They soon returned to Xavier&#x27;s School after their recovery and the revelation that the White Queen had employed Empath to coerce Magneto into allowing the transfer. After an alliance between the X-Men and the Hellfire Club and Magneto&#x27;s ascension to the Inner Circle as its White King, relations between the Hellions and the New Mutants improved.

Magma, realizing that she held feelings for Empath, eventually returned to the Hellions and the Massachusetts Academy; the two would later leave the team to travel to her home in Nova Roma. James Proudstar also left the Hellions, re-emerging with Cable and the remnants of the New Mutants in X-Force.

Superstrong and durable Beef (Buford Wilson) and bioelectricity-projecting Bevatron (Fabian Marechal-Julbin) were later additions to the group. They were present when the Hellions unsuccessfully challenged the New Warriors over the allegiance of their former member, Firestar.

The original Hellions, however, came to an end when Trevor Fitzroy and a squadron of Sentinels attacked a Hellfire Club function; Jetstream and Beef were killed immediately, while Tarot, the rest of the Hellions and many guests that were erroneously believed to be unnamed Hellions were captured and drained of their life energies by Fitzroy. Emma Frost&#x27;s guilt over her students&#x27; deaths led to her eventual reform.
These Hellions were some of the many deceased mutants resurrected via the Transmode Virus by Selene and Eli Bard during the &quot;Necrosha&quot; storyline running through &quot;New Mutants&quot;, &quot;X-Force&quot; and &quot;X-Men: Legacy&quot;. They survived and are once again acting as a team.

With the establishing of the new sovereign mutant nation of Krakoa, the original Hellions and Bevatron, now free of the Transmode Virus, have all taken up residence there.
==Emplate&#x27;s Hellions==
The next group of Hellions was organized by the parasitic Emplate to attack Generation X, the new class of Emma Frost&#x27;s students. This group appeared twice, in &quot;Generation X&quot; (1994) #11–12 and 57, with slightly different members:

* Bulwark (Oswald Boeglin) - Bulwark could expand his muscle mass. He would reappear alongside Emplate, but was later captured and killed by the revamped Weapon X program. He was only a member during the team&#x27;s first appearance.
* D.O.A. (George Baker) - D.O.A. is an energy vampire much like Emplate and his skin is invulnerable to most damage.
* Lady Gayle Edgerton - Edgerton was a psychic vampire. She is a former girlfriend of Generation X&#x27;s Chamber. Emplate took her powers back when she switched sides after she helped capture Chamber. She was only on the team during its first appearance.
* Murmur (Allan Rennie) - Murmur could open teleportation portals within his line of sight. Depowered.
* Nocturne (Bridget Warner) - Nocturne controls an ebon energy. She was part of Emplate&#x27;s second team.
* Vincente (Vincente Cimetta) - Vincente can change his body from solid to liquid or gas. He can make his gas state poisonous to inhale. An alternate version had previously appeared as a member of the Age of Apocalypse&#x27;s Generation Next.
* Wrap (Nick Bisley) - Wrap possesses super strength. He is an energy being whose bandages hold him together. He was part of Emplate&#x27;s second team.

==The New Hellions==
A group of self-proclaimed &quot;New Hellions&quot; emerged to fight X-Force, in &quot;X-Force&quot; #87–90, whose members included some from the team&#x27;s past:

* Bedlam (Jesse Aaronson) - Bedlam can produce a bioelectrical field that disrupts electrical systems. He briefly defected from X-Force to join his brother and the New Hellions.
* Feral (Maria Callasantos) - Feral possesses superhuman speed, agility, reflexes and senses. She has a limited healing factor, claws and a tail. A former member of X-Force, she was killed by Sabretooth after being depowered. After her death she was given the chance to return as a ghost under the service of deities and demons. 
* King Bedlam (Christopher Aaronson) - evil Jesse Aaronson&#x27;s older brother, with whom he shares the same kind of disruption powers. 
* Magma (Amara Juliana Olvians Aquilla) - Magma could control fire, heat, magma and tectonic plates. She needs to be in her magma form to use these abilities to their full potential. She is a former New Mutant.
* Paradigm - Paradigm was a mutant infused with techno-organic material extracted from the alien Phalanx. His head is shown being used to infiltrate the Beast&#x27;s files. Cyclops destroyed it.
* Switch (Devon Alomar) - Switch is able to switch minds with an individual in order to possess their body.
* Tarot (Mari-Ange Colbert) - Tarot is an original Hellion inexplicably resurrected; Tarot&#x27;s life was somehow joined to King Bedlam. When he was depowered, she died again.

==Xavier Institute==

After the reopening of the Xavier Institute for Higher Learning various training squads are formed. One such group of students, under the tutelage of headmistress Emma Frost, is dubbed &quot;the Hellions&quot;. They have an intense rivalry with another such group, the New Mutants, echoing the relationship between the two original groups of the same names. Membership consists of:

* Dust (Sooraya Qadir) - can convert her body into a malleable cloud of dust that she can manipulate at will and which grants immunity to magic. She was one of the 27 students at the Xavier Institute to retain her powers after M-Day. Dust is a member of the X-Men and a student at the Jean Grey School for Higher Learning. 
* Hellion (Julian Keller) - the leader of the Hellions; possesses high-level telekinesis. He was one of the 27 students at the Xavier Institute to retain his powers after M-Day. He is currently a student at the Jean Grey School for Higher Learning and a member of the X-Men. 
* Icarus (Joshua Guthrie) - has the power of flight, a limited healing factor, and the ability to mimic any sound he hears. He is shot by William Stryker.
* Mercury (Cessily Kincaid) - body is composed of non-toxic inorganic liquid mercury that she can mold into any shape at will, stick to walls with and become protected from magical attacks. She is one of the 27 students at the Xavier Institute to retain her powers after M-Day. She is currently a student at the Jean Grey School for Higher Learning and a member of the X-Men.
* Rockslide (Santo Vaccarro) - forms animated rock bodies for himself that grants him superhuman strength, durability and endurance. In addition, Rockslide is able to violently detonate his entire body at will and then reform on command. Santo is one of the 27 students at the Xavier Institute to retain his powers after M-Day. He is currently a student at the Jean Grey School for Higher Learning and a member of the X-Men.
* Specter (Dallas Gibson) - could merge with his shadow to increase his strength, speed and durability. In this shadow form, he could see in darkness and was immune to darkness-based attacks. Shortly after the squads are formed, he was transferred twice, ending up on the Corsairs squad. He was depowered during M-Day and living with his grandparents. He is currently dating Graymalkin.
* Tag (Brian Cruz) - could place a psionic imprint upon himself or others that attracted or repelled other people. He was depowered during M-Day. Brian dies on the bus that is bombed by William Stryker. 
* Wither (Kevin Ford) - decays organic matter by his &quot;death touch&quot;. He is one of the 27 students at the Xavier Institute to retain his powers after M-Day. After this, he comes under the influence of Selene and is killed by Elixir.

The four issue miniseries &quot;New X-Men: Hellions&quot; (2005), by writers Nunzio DeFilippis and Christina Weir with art by Clayton Henry, focused on the Hellions spending the summer in California. In a review of the &quot;New X-Men Academy X – The Complete Collection&quot; trade paperback, Eric Alex Cline of &quot;AIPT&quot; thought the Hellions were the only characters to &quot;show promise&quot; and that the Hellions limited series in the collection was &quot;easily the best part of the book&quot;. On the limited series, Cline commented that &quot;while the actual villain of the series is rather bland, he helps set the stage for the Hellions to get some solid character development. Some of the most interesting conflicts take place between the mutant teens and their human parents who sometimes fail to protect their children, and who even show prejudice toward them. It&#x27;s a cool situation to see handled on the page, especially since the mutant metaphor doesn&#x27;t always stretch that far&quot;.

After M-Day, the cataclysmic event that decimated the world&#x27;s mutant population, only 27 of the 182 students enrolled at the Xavier Institute retain their powers, and the remaining students are folded into a single training squad, the New X-Men. For the Hellions, only Tag and Specter were depowered.
==All-New Hellions (Hellfire Academy)==

After the events of Avengers vs. X-Men, the new Black King of the Hellfire Club, Kade Kilgore, creates the Hellfire Academy, a school for training mutants to be villains. Kilgore recruits for his school some former students of the X-Men and creates a new team of Hellions.

==Krakoan Hellions==

A &quot;Hellions&quot; title was launched March 2020 as part of the &quot;Dawn of X&quot; publishing initiative during the Krakoan Age. Written by Zeb Wells, and drawn by Stephen Segovia, the initial cast comprised Empath, Havok, Mister Sinister, Nanny, Orphan-Maker, Psylocke, Greycrow, and Wild Child. For the majority of the series, Segovia was the lead artist &quot;but key chapters were also illustrated by Carmen Carnero, Ze Carlos, and Roge Antonio, among others&quot;. On the setup of the series, Wells commented:I wanted to pick at some of the complicated issues that were caused by the mutant society coming together. I really like what [Jonathan Hickman] had done, where as long as you&#x27;re a mutant you can come live on this island because it was going to be a utopia. But there are some very weird characters who have done some very terrible things. I didn&#x27;t want it to seem like that would be brushed under the carpet, I wanted to dig into that. We could play with the larger issues of what a society does with the people who can&#x27;t fit in, or don&#x27;t want to fit in.The series was cancelled in 2021 with issue #18 (December 2021) as its last. &quot;Hellions&quot; established some of the groundwork for Hickman&#x27;s &quot;Inferno&quot; (September 2021 – January 2022) event. &quot;CBR&quot; noted that the series retired Greycrow&#x27;s &quot;racist&quot; Scalphunter codename, which debuted during the 1986 Mutant Massacre storyline, in the second issue of the series and that Greycrow had major &quot;character development&quot; with a shift towards redemption and heroics during this series. In January 2021, Wells highlighted that Greycrow &quot;carries the themes of the book most explicitly&quot;. The character jumped out to Wells during the series &quot;earliest brainstorming stages&quot; – Wells stated, &quot;I see a character who came from pain and violence and then repeated the cycle again and again and never stopped to ask if that is who he really wants to be. And now he&#x27;s seeing the world change around him, but not sure if &quot;he&quot; can change&quot;.

&quot;Hellions&quot; was #6 on &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot;&#x27;s &quot;The 10 best comics of 2021&quot; list — Christian Holub opined that since the Krakoan Age relaunch, &quot;the most compelling&quot; X-Men series &quot;was definitely &quot;Hellions&quot;, which assembled the weirdest, most misfit mutants [...] and tried to find a place for them in paradise. From team leader Mr. Sinister&#x27;s constant backstabbing to Psylocke&#x27;s psychic swordplay, &quot;Hellions&quot; delivered one entertaining story after another until this month&#x27;s 18th and final issue, which managed to wrap up all of its plot threads and put a cathartic capper on its various characters&#x27; quests for redemption&quot;. Following issue #18, Lia Williamson of &quot;AIPT&quot; noted that &quot;&quot;Hellions&quot; ends the series just as it began: it&#x27;s emotional, it&#x27;s weird, and it&#x27;s delightful&quot; with the final scene focused on a &quot;touching moment between Kwannon and Greycrow, the emotional backbone of this series&quot;, which &quot;ends the series on a hopeful note and quite frankly, a happy one&quot;. Williamson viewed the series as &quot;both the underdog and sleeper hit of the X-Men relaunch&quot; – &quot;now that the series has reached its conclusion, it&#x27;s safe to say that it&#x27;s the closest to perfect an X-Men series has been in the Krakoa era&quot;. 

Brandon Zachary for &quot;CBR&quot; commented that &quot;each of the Hellions is arguably in a better place emotionally and mentally than where they were at the beginning of the series, even if some of their personal situations have become worse. [...] The Hellions represented the possibility that mutants could grow from their darker impulses and tendencies, and become better people. And while the team as it was constructed might be done, the concept was clearly a success&quot;. In a retrospective at the end of the Krakoan Age, Scott Redmond for &quot;ComicsXF&quot; highlighted the &quot;Hellions&quot; as a stand out title. Redmond commented that the series &quot;looked at how those that are broken, outcast, wrapped in darkness, fit into a so-called paradise. It was one of the first titles to really start to poke holes in the Krakoan system, that still was employing methods of punishment and control similar to the world they left behind. This series took characters that we should not want to even glance at and made them empathetic, funny, relatable, and came with heartbreak&quot;.

<text>Mohsin Ahmad Alaini (; 20 October 1932 – 25 August 2021) was a Yemeni politician who served as the prime minister of the Yemen Arab Republic five times between 1967 and 1975.

==Biography==
In 1947, Alaini was selected among other students to do a scholarship in Beirut, he then studied law at the Cairo University in 1952–59, and Sorbonne in 1956–57. In 1957, he published a book, &quot;Battles and Conspiracies Against the Yemeni Issue&quot; (Arabic: معارك ومؤامرات ضد قضية اليمن). He started his career as a teacher in Aden, where he was involved in the anti-colonial trade union movement from 1960 onwards against British rule. Expelled from Aden by the British in 1961, he returned to Egypt as a delegate of the trade union federation. In Cairo, he joined the Ba&#x27;ath Party and allied himself with the moderate Nasserists.

Following the Civil War and the overthrow of the monarchy, he was appointed the first foreign minister of the Yemen Arab Republic.

He subsequently served four terms as prime minister under President Abdul Rahman al-Iryani. They were:
# 5 November 1967 to 21 December 1967
# 29 July 1969 to 2 September 1969
# 5 February 1970 to 26 February 1971
# 18 September 1971 to 30 December 1972

The fifth and final term was served under Ibrahim al-Hamdi. It was from 22 June 1974 to 16 January 1975.

Between and after these terms he was appointed foreign minister (1962, 1965, 1970–71, 1971–72, 1974), and sent as ambassador to the United Nations (1962–65, 1965–66, 1967–68, 1979–81), the Soviet Union (1968–70), France (1971, 1975–76), the United Kingdom (1973–74), West Germany (1981–84) and United States (1963–66, 1984–97). Back in Yemen he was nominated for the &quot;Shura&quot; council of elder statesmen.

Alaini died on 25 August 2021, aged 88.

==Personal life==
In 1962, al-Aini married Aziza Abulahom (Abu Luhum), with whom he had two sons, two daughters and thirteen grandchildren. His brother-in-law and important supporter, Sinan Abu Luhum, was governor of the port city of Al Hudaydah for many years.

<text>The Union Canal was a towpath canal that existed in southeastern Pennsylvania in the United States during the 19th century. First proposed in 1690 to connect Philadelphia with the Susquehanna River, it ran approximately 82 mi from Middletown on the Susquehanna below Harrisburg to Reading on the Schuylkill River.

==History==
===18th century===

Construction began in 1792 during George Washington&#x27;s administration, but financial difficulties delayed its completion until 1828. Called the &quot;Golden Link,&quot; it provided a critical early transportation route for shipping anthracite coal and lumber eastward to Philadelphia. Closed in the 1880s, remnants of the canal remain, most notably the Union Canal Tunnel, a hand-built engineering marvel that is the oldest existing transportation tunnel in the United States. The tunnel is a National Historic Landmark.

The idea of uniting the Schuylkill and Susquehanna rivers by a canal was first proposed and discussed by William Penn in 1690. Penn&#x27;s plan, conceived a few years after he had founded Philadelphia was to make &quot;a second settlement&quot; on the Susquehanna river, similar in size to that of Philadelphia itself. He made this plan, titled &quot;Some Proposals for a Second Settlement in the Province of Pennsylvania&quot; public in England in 1690. The route envisioned by Penn was a road up the west bank of the Schuylkill to the mouth of French Creek near present-day Phoenixville heading west to the Susquehanna via present day Lancaster and a Susquehanna tributary, Conestoga Creek. Although Penn first proposed the project of continuous water transportation from the Delaware to the Susquehanna, he did not call for the building of a canal.

The canal scheme was first proposed by the Society for the Improvement of Roads and Inland Navigation organized in 1789 with preeminent, wartime financier Robert Morris as president, David Rittenhouse, William Smith and John Nicolson. In 1791, the Society presented proposals to the State of Pennsylvania proposing to connect the Atlantic seaboard with Lake Erie. This Pennsylvania plan was before the creation of New York&#x27;s Western and Northern Inland Lock Navigation Companies in 1792. The New York plan took the first steps to improve navigation on the Mohawk River by constructing a canal between the Mohawk and Lake Ontario but that effort with private financing was insufficient. In the Pennsylvania plan, the Society proposed a canal route, 426 miles in length connecting Philadelphia with Pittsburgh by a canal. One part of this project was a canal segment up to the Schuylkill River to Tulpehocken Creek to a summit-level canal near Lebanon and thence by way of the Quitapahilla and Swatara creeks to the Susquehanna River.

This action resulted in the formation of the Schuylkill and Susquehanna Navigation Company incorporated on September 29, 1791, to open a communication between the Schuylkill and Susquehanna rivers from Reading on the Schuylkill to Middletown on the Susquehanna with Robert Morris as the president of companies.

The original engineering concept developed by the Society as well as the navigation company&#x27;s charter had been to build a canal up to the Schuylkill Valley to Norristown, improving the Schuylkill river from there to Reading; while from Reading a canal was to extend to the Susquehanna, via Lebanon. This would have required a four-mile summit crossing between Tulpehocken and the Quitipahilla with an artificial waterway connecting two separate river valleys; namely the Susquehanna and the Schuylkill watersheds. Its successful completion would have made the middle reach, the first summit-level canal in the United States. The term refers to a canal that rises then falls, as opposed to a lateral canal, which has a continuous fall only. In this case, the proposed canal at 80 miles in length would rise 192 feet over 42 miles from the west at the Susquehanna river to the summit and then fall 311 feet over 34 miles to the Schuylkill river to the east. It was to be the &quot;golden link&quot; between Philadelphia and the vast interior of Pennsylvania and beyond.

This proposed summit crossing offered a severe test of 18th-century engineering skills, materials and construction techniques. For both designing and operating a water-conveyance transportation system through an area where sinkholes are common, and surface water is scarce. Ultimately, the 1794 engineering concept was flawed as the water supply for the summit crossing was inadequate and the technology for minimizing supply losses was still another several decades into the future. By 1796, however, the navigation company&#x27;s project was a commercial failure. The result was that with the onset of the Erie canal still some thirty years into the future, Philadelphia lost the early initiative in water transportation.

Despite the termination of construction in 1796, the company managed to forestall foreclosure on its property and constructed works.

In 1802, the company had to fend off such an attempt and was only successful in holding onto its property and water rights through the sale of excess property, often whole farms were sold. Although originally set to expire in 1801, the company&#x27;s corporate charter was extended in 1806 to 1820. In 1807, Charles Gottfried Paleske (1758-1816) was elected to the Board of Directors of the company and working with James Milnor, Robert Brooke, Isaac Roberdeau, and John Scott walked &quot;... the line of the Schuylkill &amp; Susquehanna Navigation Company from Kruitzer&#x27;s plantation where the canal ends to the end of the summit near Kucher&#x27;s mill, about 9 miles; find the work in good condition including the five locks at Ley&#x27;s, and the bridges decayed or collapsed ...&quot;

In 1808, Paleske was elected president and Joseph S. Lewis as treasurer. In 1809, the company&#x27;s directors appointed a committee to draft articles for a merger with the Delaware and Schuylkill Canal company which was submitted to the State legislature. In 1810, William John Duane, writing as &quot;Franklin&quot; advocates for reviving the Schuylkill and Susquehanna Navigation company as part of a scheme for a canal route to Lake Erie instead of the Ohio Valley in a series of letters in his Aurora and in his published letters, &quot;To the People of Pennsylvania Respecting the Internal Improvement of the Commonwealth by Means of Roads and Canals.&quot;

With the establishment of constitutional government in 1789 following the American Revolutionary War, the financial condition of the country improved. While credit was more plentiful than it had been for a half-century and the population growing ...&quot;came increasing and insistent demands for ... improved transportation facilities.&quot; Regular tax revenues to the State were insufficient and could only be remedied by what seemed like at the time to be &quot;abnormal increases in taxation.&quot; One remedy that had been used in the past was that of authorizing lotteries to raise funds, but only, for &quot;important public purposes&quot;. In 1795, the State had authorized $400,000 for the Union canal&#x27;s predecessor corporation, the Schuylkill &amp; Susquehanna Navigation and Delaware and Schuylkill Canal companies. While there were numerous abuses of the lottery system in terms of complaints but the biggest problem was that of numerous &quot;foreign&quot; lotteries.

Until the passage of the act for the &quot;entire abolition of lotteries&quot; by the State of Pennsylvania in 1833, &quot;(F)oreign advertisements were to be found in nearly every issue of the county and city newspapers. They were especially evident after 1820, 324 Lotteries in Pennsylvania Prior to 1833. when it was not unusual to find four or more different foreign lottery advertisements in a single issue of a paper. During the entire period they were probably three times as numerous as those of lotteries chartered by the Legislature of Pennsylvania. In a single issue of the &quot;Greensburgh Gazette,&quot; on May 12, 1826, advertisements for the Connecticut State Lottery, The New York Literature Lottery, Maryland University Lottery, Mr. Jefferson&#x27;s Lottery, The Grand Consolidated Lottery (New York), and only one Pennsylvania lottery, The Union Canal Lottery. Similar illustrations from papers throughout the state might be given. Many brokers in nearby states ran advertisements regularly in the county papers in Pennsylvania.&quot;
But most importantly, the result was that &quot;...many Pennsylvania authorized lotteries remained uncompleted or underfunded for years.&quot; 
:&quot;The most striking illustration of this ...(problem with foreign lotteries) ... was the case of the lottery chartered in 1795 to raise $400,000 to aid in the completion of the ...(Schuylkill &amp; Susquehanna and Delaware and Schuylkill Canals). After sixteen years, during which this lottery had schemes almost constantly before the public, only $60,000 of the $400,000 had been raised, due to the inability of the managers to sell their tickets.&quot;

The most important single lottery in terms of number of tickets and in the value of prizes in the early history of state lotteries was the Union Canal Lottery authorized in 1811 but it was to be managed by the Lehigh Coal &amp; Navigation Company and the Union Canal Company, respectively. The 1811 acts of authorization prohibited the use of any of the lottery funds as dividends paid to stockholders. 
The Union canal&#x27;s incorporation permitted it to raise by means of a lottery $340,000, the exact amount that was left uncompleted by the predecessor companies in 1795.

Between 1811 and 1821, even with this lottery effort, the company was unable to attract sufficient capital to complete the proposed canals and to keep them in repairs. In 1821, the legislature permitted the company to continue to raise by lottery for twenty-five years sufficient funds to enable the company to pay six percent dividends to stockholders.

Between 1811 and December 31, 1833, the company conducted about fifty different lottery schemes and awarded in prizes more than $33,000,000. In 1832, the lottery paid $5,216,240.100. It was not a success for the company though as the lottery had been planned to provide a 15% return, in reality, it was below 5%. Throughout the entire period it was authorized, the lotteries were to be found in nearly every issue of the city and county papers of Pennsylvania as well as throughout the United States. The State lottery to funds the canal construction is &quot;... one of the best-known lotteries in the history of this country.&quot;

The largest cities on the East Coast were experiencing an energy crisis with large stands of forest were no longer available near enough to the cities to practically bring in wood for fuel and charcoal production. Cities were beginning to import smoky, sooty bituminous coal from England and Virginia and a new source of energy was needed. The project was given a new push by industrialists in New Jersey and Philadelphia. Josiah White, an industrialist, discovered how to properly burn anthracite in 1808. Large deposits of anthracite were found within 100 miles of Philadelphia over a decade earlier, but overland transportation by mule train of bulk commodities was extremely costly. Local rivers were rapids strewn and ran fast, not shallow and well behaved. By the end of the War of 1812, industrialists were getting desperate for fuels—mills and manufacturies were sometimes forced into going quiet for days. White and others pushed for canal funding, applied for rights to improve navigations on the Schuylkill, and eventually split off when he disagreed with other investors as the best way to proceed.

Construction resumed in 1821, probably in response to the successful improvements along the Lehigh Canal designed by White and the Lehigh Coal &amp; Navigation Company, which was founded in 1818 to regularly deliver growing amounts of anthracite coal from Summit Hill, Pennsylvania to the fuel starved coastal cities. One of the principal challenges was the construction of a tunnel through the ridge separating the headwaters of Quittapahilla Creek and Clarks Run. The drilling of the tunnel was by hand, using gunpowder to blast though argillaceous slate with veins of hard flinty limestone 80 feet (24 m) below the summit of the ridge. The progress of the tunnel was approximately 15 ft (4.5 m) per week, requiring over two years to complete. Another engineering difficulty was the lack of a sufficient continual supply of water at the summit level, a task that was compounded by leakage and required an elaborate pumping mechanism.

Although the initial design called for the construction of a canal from the Susquehanna to the Delaware, the 1825 opening of the rival Schuylkill Navigation from Reading to Philadelphia prompted the Union Canal Company to focus solely on the Middletown-Reading portion of the canal, which when connected would complete the longer conveyance west to the Susquehanna.

The canal was completed in 1828 under the direction of Canvass White, the preeminent canal engineer of the day. Upon its completion it was 8-1/2 ft (2.6 m) wide and had 93 locks. In 1832 a branch canal was constructed northward from the water works along the Swatara Creek to Pine Grove. The branch canal served as feeder for the summit level as well as allowing the transport of anthracite from the mountains, which became the principal revenue source for the canal operation.

The charter of the canal company allowed it to build lateral railroad lines from the canal to reach coal mines. It built a line from the end of the branch canal to Lorberry Junction in 1830, which was operated by horse power. This connected it to the Lorberry Creek Railroad and brought coal traffic to the canal. In 1844, the track was leased to the Swatara Railroad, which extensively refurbished the right-of-way and began to operate it by steam locomotive in about 1850.

By the 1840s, the narrow size of the canal locks prevented the passage of the larger barges that were adopted for use on the Pennsylvania Main Line and Schuylkill Navigation. The existing width restricted barges to . From 1841 to 1858, under the direction of chief engineer Loammi Baldwin Jr., the canal was widened to 17 ft (5.2 m) to allow the passage of the larger boats carrying to . In the process of the rebuilding, the tunnel through the summit ridge was shortened to 600 ft (180 m). The widening of the canal allowed for a brief period of prosperity in the late 1850s and early 1860s.

In June 1862, a flood on Swatara Creek damaged the western portion of the canal, completely destroying the Pine Grove feeder upon which the canal company depended for revenue. The flood prompted costly repairs that were compounded with continual water supply problems. The connecting railroad was leased to the Philadelphia and Reading Railroad on July 26, 1862, and sold outright in January 1866. The completion of the Lebanon Valley Railroad in 1857 from Reading to Harrisburg cut into the canal revenues, forcing its closure in 1881.

====Preservation====
In April 1950, the Union Canal Tunnel was purchased by the Lebanon County Historical Society. The tunnel was placed on the National Register of Historic Places on October 1, 1974. It was designated a National Historic Civil Engineering Landmark by the American Society of Civil Engineers (ASCE) in 1970. On April 19, 1994, the tunnel was designated a National Historic Landmark by the Secretary of the Interior Bruce Babbitt. The tunnel is open to visitors in the Union Canal Tunnel Park.

A restored portion of the canal along Tulpehocken Creek is maintained by the Berks County Parks System at the Union Canal Towpath Park in Wyomissing west of Reading. This portion contains one previously restored lock (Lock 49E) https://www.co.berks.pa.us/Dept/Parks/Pages/Stop6Lock49E.aspx along a towpath now used as a recreational trail. A portion of the canal along Swatara Creek is also preserved at Swatara State Park where there are remains of 7 locks, a towpath bridge, major sections of the towpath, and three dams are still visible in Swatara State Park. The canal was never rebuilt because the railroad soon went into operation on the opposite bank of the Swatara Creek.

<doc id="725977" wikidata="Q7094880" url="?curid=725977" title="Ontario Provincial Confederation of Regions Party">
<text>The Ontario Provincial Confederation of Regions Party is a minor political party in Ontario, Canada, the provincial branch of the now-defunct Confederation of Regions Party of Canada. The party was founded in 1989, around the time the federal CoR was dissolved, and remains the last Confederation of Regions Party in Canada.

The CoR survives only in Ontario, though once a national movement whose original &quot;raison d&#x27;être&quot; was to promote the rights of regions other than Ontario and Quebec, now it advocates for regions within Ontario. It has reinvented itself twice: in the 1990s, first in campaigning across mainly rural regions of Ontario with targeted policies, before in the 2000s finding resonance in Northern Ontario and Northeastern Ontario, where it continues to play a minor role in provincial elections.

== Party platform ==

The party campaigns on the promotion of direct democracy, protection of Canadian heritage and environmental sustainability, while opposing urban sprawl onto farmland, big business and unionization. The party&#x27;s proposed health care plan would &quot;give individuals more responsibility over their own health care&quot;, however, it would not support a two-tier health care system.

If elected, the party would hold a referendum on the &quot;French Language Services Act&quot; and halt all multicultural funding.

== Election results ==
Results of recent elections for the Legislative Assembly of Ontario:
In the 1990 election, CoR candidates in Algoma, Cochrane South, Nickel Belt, Sudbury, Sudbury East and Sault Ste. Marie placed ahead of Ontario Progressive Conservative Party candidates. The party rapidly declined in popularity, receiving about 0.1% with only six candidates province-wide vote in 1995, and then less than 0.01% of the province wide popular vote in the two registered candidate 1999, one registered candidate 2003, two registered candidate 2007, three registered candidate 2011, two registered candidate 2014 and the two registered candidate 2018 elections.

Typical of that 1999-2018 era was the 2014 General Election. The party was only able to field two candidates in the 2014 election. Fauzia Sadiq, the party&#x27;s candidate in Timmins—James Bay campaigned on a platform of eliminating property taxes, cutting government positions and introducing two-year term limits. Sadiq received 61 votes. The party&#x27;s only other candidate was long-time candidate and party president Murray Reid in Renfrew—Nipissing—Pembroke who received 490 votes.

However, heading towards the June 2nd, 2022, General Election in the Province of Ontario, of the province&#x27;s 124 constituencies, the party has three organized constituency associations and all three associations are offering candidates for this 2022 election, according to Elections Ontario. That same election administration body reports that the coming June 2022 will feature 26 registered political parties of which four parties are seen as &quot;major&quot; parties. Thus of the remaining 22 &quot;minor&quot; parties, according to Elections Ontario data, as a &quot;minor&quot; party, CoR is able to maintain more organized constituency associations than 12 of those 22 &quot;minor&quot; parties, thus making CoR a &quot;Top Half&quot; &quot;minor&quot; party, organization-wise, in the province.

The party failed to win any seats in the 2022 Ontario general election.

== Party leaders ==
Dean Wasson has been the party&#x27;s only leader, heading the party in the 1990 election. The party has not fielded a leader in any subsequent election, considering itself to be a grass roots organization, and will choose a leader if the party wins seats. The party&#x27;s one candidate nominated in the 2003 election, Richard Butson, was cited as the &quot;de facto&quot; leader. After Butson&#x27;s death in 2015, Eileen Butson was named as president of the party.
Murray Reid is now referred as the de facto leader of the party and president as of 2018.

<text>Dick Tracy is a 1990 American action crime film based on the 1930s comic strip created by Chester Gould. Warren Beatty produced, directed and starred in the film, whose supporting cast includes Al Pacino, Madonna, Glenne Headly and Charlie Korsmo, with appearances by Dustin Hoffman, James Keane, Charles Durning, William Forsythe, Seymour Cassel, Mandy Patinkin, Catherine O&#x27;Hara, Ed O&#x27;Ross, James Caan, James Tolkan, R. G. Armstrong and Dick Van Dyke. &quot;Dick Tracy&quot; depicts the detective&#x27;s romantic relationships with Breathless Mahoney and Tess Trueheart, as well as his conflicts with crime boss Alphonse &quot;Big Boy&quot; Caprice and his henchmen. Tracy also begins fostering a young street urchin named Kid.

Development of the film began in the early 1980s with Tom Mankiewicz assigned to write the script. The screenplay was written by Jim Cash and Jack Epps Jr. The project also went through directors Steven Spielberg, John Landis, Walter Hill and Richard Benjamin before the arrival of Beatty. It was filmed mainly at Universal Studios. Danny Elfman was hired to compose the score, and the film&#x27;s music was featured on three separate soundtrack albums.

&quot;Dick Tracy&quot; premiered at the Uptown Theater in Washington, D.C. on June 10, 1990, and was released nationwide five days later. Reviews ranged from favorable to mixed, with positive comments on the performances (particularly Pacino and Madonna), production design, make up effects, music, and Beatty&#x27;s direction, but negative ones on the screenplay and characterization. The film was a success at the box office and with several award committees. It garnered seven Academy Award nominations, winning in three of the categories: Best Original Song, Best Makeup and Best Art Direction. &quot;Dick Tracy&quot; is remembered today for its visual style.

==Plot==
In 1938, a young street kid witnesses the massacre of a group of mobsters at the hands of Flattop and Itchy, two hoods on the payroll of Alphonse &quot;Big Boy&quot; Caprice, who leave a bullet-riddled message for police detective Dick Tracy. After catching the Kid in an act of petty theft and rescuing him from a menacing tramp, Tracy temporarily adopts him with the help of his girlfriend, Tess Trueheart.

Meanwhile, Big Boy coerces rival mobster Lips Manlis into signing over the deed to Club Ritz, then kills Lips with a cement overcoat and steals his girlfriend, the sultry singer Breathless Mahoney. Interrogating Flattop, Itchy, and fellow hired gun Mumbles, Tracy arrests Big Boy but the evidence against him proves inconclusive. Big Boy goes free, and District Attorney John Fletcher threatens Tracy&#x27;s job.

Breathless, the only witness to Lips&#x27; murder, is unwilling to testify against Big Boy and unsuccessfully attempts to seduce Tracy. He follows her to the club, where Big Boy presents the city&#x27;s head criminals with a plan to unite them all under his leadership. Mob boss Spud Spaldoni refuses and is killed with a carbomb, and Tracy narrowly escapes. The next day, Big Boy and his henchmen capture Tracy and attempt to bribe him, but he rebuffs them. The criminals leave Tracy to die in a boiler explosion, but he is saved by the Kid, who receives an honorary detective certificate.

The corrupt Fletcher is revealed to be in Big Boy&#x27;s pocket, while Breathless visits Tracy in another attempt to seduce him, and Tess witnesses them kiss. &quot;The Blank&quot;, a mysterious figure with no face, uses the club&#x27;s piano player 88 Keys to bring Big Boy an offer to eliminate Tracy for a cut of Big Boy&#x27;s profits. Tracy leads a seemingly unsuccessful raid on Club Ritz, which is actually a diversion to hide Officer &quot;Bug&quot; Bailey inside with a covert listening device. Listening in on Big Boy&#x27;s criminal activities, Tracy and the police all but wipe out the unified criminal organization.

However, Big Boy discovers the bug and lures Tracy into an ambush, but Tracy rescues Bailey and is himself saved by the Blank. A furious Big Boy accepts the Blank&#x27;s offer, while a heartbroken Tess leaves the city. In love with Tracy, Breathless agrees to testify if he gives in to her advances, but Tracy cannot bring himself to betray Tess, who has a change of heart and returns home. Tess is kidnapped by the Blank, who subdues Tracy and, with the help of 88 Keys, kills Fletcher and frames an unconscious Tracy.

With Tracy behind bars, Big Boy terrorizes the city in a lucrative crime wave. Taken to the city orphanage, the Kid adopts the name &quot;Dick Tracy, Jr.&quot; and reunites with Tracy, who is released by his colleagues on New Year&#x27;s Eve. Interrogating Mumbles again, Tracy and the police surround Club Ritz, where the Blank has left Tess to frame Big Boy for her kidnapping. In the ensuing gun battle, Big Boy&#x27;s men are killed while Big Boy takes Tess hostage and escapes to a drawbridge.

Tying Tess to the gears, Big Boy is confronted by Tracy, and they are held at gunpoint by the Blank, who offers to share the city with Tracy once they kill Big Boy. Distracted by Junior, the Blank is shot by Big Boy before Tracy sends Big Boy falling to his death. Rescuing Tess, Tracy unmasks the Blank to reveal a mortally wounded Breathless, who kisses Tracy before dying. Later, Tracy proposes to Tess but is interrupted by a police dispatch, and leaves her with the ring as he and Junior respond to the call.

==Production==
===Development===
Beatty had a concept for a &quot;Dick Tracy&quot; film in 1975. At the time, the film rights were owned by Michael Laughlin, who gave up his option from Tribune Media Services after he was unsuccessful in pitching &quot;Dick Tracy&quot; to Hollywood studios. Floyd Mutrux and Art Linson purchased the film rights from the Tribune in 1977, and, in 1980, United Artists became interested in financing and distributing &quot;Dick Tracy&quot;. Tom Mankiewicz was under negotiations to write the script, based on his previous success with &quot;Superman&quot; and &quot;Superman II&quot;. The deal fell through when Chester Gould, creator of the &quot;Dick Tracy&quot; comic strip, insisted on strict financial and artistic control.

That same year, Mutrux and Linson eventually took the property to Paramount Pictures, which began developing screenplays, offered Steven Spielberg the director&#x27;s position, and brought in Universal Pictures to co-finance. Universal put John Landis forward as a candidate for director, courted Clint Eastwood for the title role, and commissioned Jim Cash and Jack Epps Jr. to write the screenplay. &quot;Before we were brought on, there were several failed scripts at Universal,&quot; reflected Epps, &quot;then it went dormant, but John Landis was interested in &quot;Dick Tracy&quot;, and he brought us in to write it.&quot; Cash and Epps&#x27; simple orders from Landis were to write the script in a 1930s pulp magazine atmosphere, and center it with Alphonse &quot;Big Boy&quot; Caprice as the primary villain. For research, Epps read every &quot;Dick Tracy&quot; comic strip from 1930 to 1957. The writers wrote two drafts for Landis; Max Allan Collins, then-writer of the &quot;Dick Tracy&quot; comic strip, remembers reading one of them. &quot;It was terrible. The only positive thing about it was a thirties setting and lots of great villains, but the story was paper-thin and it was uncomfortably campy.&quot;

In addition to Beatty and Eastwood, other actors considered for the lead role included Harrison Ford, Richard Gere, Tom Selleck and Mel Gibson. Landis left &quot;Dick Tracy&quot; following the controversial on-set accident on &quot;Twilight Zone: The Movie&quot;, in which three actors were killed. Walter Hill came on board to direct, with Joel Silver as producer. Cash and Epps wrote another draft, and Hill approached Warren Beatty for the title role. Pre-production had progressed as far as set building, but the film was stalled when artistic control issues arose with Beatty, a fan of the &quot;Dick Tracy&quot; comic strip. Hill wanted to make the film violent and realistic, while Beatty envisioned a stylized homage to the 1930s comic strip. The actor also reportedly wanted $5 million, plus fifteen percent of the box-office gross, a deal that Universal refused to accept.

Hill and Beatty left the film, which Paramount began developing as a lower-budget project, with Richard Benjamin directing. Cash and Epps continued to rewrite the script, but Universal was unsatisfied. The film rights eventually reverted to Tribune Media Services in 1985. However, Beatty decided to option the &quot;Dick Tracy&quot; rights for $3 million, along with the Cash/Epps script. When Jeffrey Katzenberg and Michael Eisner moved from Paramount to the Walt Disney Studios, &quot;Dick Tracy&quot; resurfaced, with Beatty as director, producer and leading man. Katzenberg considered hiring Martin Scorsese to direct the film, but changed his mind. &quot;It never occurred to me to direct the movie,&quot; Beatty admitted, &quot;but finally, like most of the movies that I direct, when the time comes to do it, I just do it because it&#x27;s easier than going through what I&#x27;d have to go through to get somebody else to do it.&quot;

Beatty&#x27;s reputation for directorial profligacy, notably with the critically acclaimed &quot;Reds&quot;, did not sit well with Disney. As a result, Beatty and Disney reached a contracted agreement, whereby any budget overruns on &quot;Dick Tracy&quot; would be deducted from Beatty&#x27;s fee as producer, director and star. Beatty and regular collaborator Bo Goldman significantly rewrote the dialogue, but lost a Writers Guild arbitration and did not receive screen credit.

Disney greenlit &quot;Dick Tracy&quot; in 1988 under the condition that Beatty keep the production budget within $25 million. Beatty&#x27;s fee was $7 million, against 15% of the gross (once the distributor&#x27;s gross reached $50 million). Costs began to rise when filming started, and quickly jumped to $30 million. Its total negative cost ended up being $46.5 million ($35.6 million of direct expenditure, $5.3 million in studio overhead and $5.6 million in interest). Disney spent an additional $48.1 million on advertising and publicity, and $5.8 million on prints, resulting in a total of $101 million spent overall. The financing for &quot;Dick Tracy&quot; came from Disney and Silver Screen Partners IV, as well as Beatty&#x27;s own production company, Mulholland Productions. Disney was initially going to release the film under the traditional Walt Disney Pictures banner, but instead chose to release and market the film under the adult-oriented Touchstone Pictures label leading up to the film&#x27;s theatrical debut, because the studio felt it had too many mature themes for a Disney-branded film.

===Casting===
Although Al Pacino was Beatty&#x27;s first choice for the role of Alphonse &quot;Big Boy&quot; Caprice, Robert De Niro was under consideration. Michelle Pfeiffer, Kathleen Turner and Kim Basinger were too expensive to cast as Breathless Mahoney. Sharon Stone auditioned for the role, but she was turned down. Madonna pursued the part of Breathless Mahoney, offering to work for scale. Her resulting paycheck for the film was just $35,000. Sean Young claims she was forced out of the role of Tess Trueheart (which eventually went to Glenne Headly) after rebuffing sexual advances from Beatty. In a 1989 statement, Beatty said, &quot;I made a mistake casting Sean Young in the part and I felt very badly about it.&quot; Mike Mazurki, who had appeared in the earlier &quot;Dick Tracy&quot; film, had a cameo appearance. Beatty approached Gene Hackman to do a cameo in the film, but he declined.

===Filming===

Principal photography for &quot;Dick Tracy&quot; began February 2, 1989. The filmmakers considered shooting the film on location in Chicago, but production designer Richard Sylbert believed &quot;Dick Tracy&quot; would work better using sound stages and backlots at Universal Studios in Universal City, California. Other filming took place at Warner Bros. Studios in Burbank. In total, 53 interior and 25 exterior sets were constructed. Beatty, being a perfectionist, often filmed dozens of takes of every scene.

As filming continued, Disney and Max Allan Collins conflicted over the novelization. The studio rejected his manuscript: &quot;I wound up doing an eleventh hour rewrite that was more faithful to the screenplay, even while I made it much more consistent with the strip,&quot; Collins continued, &quot;and fixed as many plot holes as I could.&quot; Disney did not like this version either, but accepted based on Beatty&#x27;s insistence to incorporate some of Collins&#x27;s writing into the shooting script, which solved the plot hole concerns. Through post-production dubbing, some of Collins&#x27;s dialogue was also incorporated into the film. Principal photography for &quot;Dick Tracy&quot; ended in May 1989. The film&#x27;s production also marks the last known use of the sodium vapor process (occasionally referred to as yellowscreen).

===Design===
Early in the development of &quot;Dick Tracy&quot;, Beatty decided to make the film using a palette limited to just seven colors—primarily red, green, blue and yellow—to evoke the film&#x27;s comic strip origins. Furthermore, each of the colors was to be exactly the same shade. Beatty&#x27;s design team included production designer Richard Sylbert, set decorator Rick Simpson, cinematographer Vittorio Storaro (with whom Beatty had worked on his previous film, &quot;Ishtar,&quot; as producer and lead actor), visual effects supervisors Michael Lloyd and Harrison Ellenshaw, prosthetic makeup designers John Caglione Jr. and Doug Drexler, and costume designer Milena Canonero. Their main intention was to stay close to Chester Gould&#x27;s original drawings from the 1930s. Other influences came from the Art Deco movement and German Expressionism.

For Storaro, the limited color palette was the most challenging aspect of production. &quot;These are not the kind of colors the audience is used to seeing,&quot; he noted. &quot;These are much more dramatic in strength, in saturation. Comic strip art is usually done with very simple and primitive ideas and emotions,&quot; Storaro theorized. &quot;One of the elements is that the story is usually told in vignette, so what we tried to do is never move the camera at all. &quot;Never&quot;. Try to make everything work into the frame.&quot; For the matte paintings, Ellenshaw and Lloyd executed over 57 paintings on glass, which were then optically combined with the live action. For a brief sequence in which The Kid dashes in front of a speeding locomotive, only of real track was laid; the train was a scale model, and the surrounding trainyard a matte painting. The film was one of the last major American studio blockbusters to have no computer-generated imagery.

Caglione and Drexler were recommended for the prosthetic makeup designs by Canonero, with whom they had worked on &quot;The Cotton Club&quot;. The rogues gallery makeup designs were taken directly from Gould&#x27;s drawings, with the exception of Al Pacino (Big Boy Caprice), who improvised his own design, ignoring the rather overweight character of the strip. His makeup took 3½ hours to apply.

===Music===

Beatty hired Danny Elfman to compose the film score based on his previous success with &quot;Batman&quot;. Elfman enlisted the help of Oingo Boingo bandmate Steve Bartek and Shirley Walker to arrange compositions for the orchestra. &quot;In a completely different way,&quot; Elfman commented, &quot;&quot;Dick Tracy&quot; has this unique quality that &quot;Batman&quot; had for me. It gives an incredible sense of non-reality.&quot; In addition, Beatty hired acclaimed songwriter Stephen Sondheim to write five original songs: &quot;Sooner or Later (I Always Get My Man)&quot;, &quot;More&quot;, &quot;Live Alone and Like It&quot;, &quot;Back in Business&quot; and &quot;What Can You Lose?&quot;. &quot;Sooner or Later&quot; and &quot;More&quot; were performed by Madonna, with &quot;What Can You Lose?&quot; being a duet with Mandy Patinkin. Mel Tormé sang &quot;Live Alone and Like It,&quot; and &quot;Back in Business&quot; was performed by Janis Siegel, Cheryl Bentyne and Lorraine Feather. &quot;Back in Business&quot; and &quot;Live Alone and Like It&quot; were both used as background music during montage sequences. &quot;Sooner or Later&quot; and &quot;Back in Business&quot; were featured in the original 1992 production of the Sondheim revue, &quot;Putting It Together&quot;, in Oxford, England, and four of the five Sondheim songs from &quot;Dick Tracy&quot; (the exception being &quot;What Can You Lose?&quot;) were used in the 1999 Broadway production of &quot;Putting It Together&quot;. A short opera sequence in the film was composed by Thomas Pasatieri.

&quot;Dick Tracy&quot; is the first film to use digital audio. In a December 1990 interview with &quot;The New York Times&quot;, Elfman criticized the growing tendency to use digital technology for sound design and dubbing purposes. &quot;I detest contemporary scoring and dubbing in cinema. Film music as an art took a deep plunge when Dolby stereo hit. Stereo has the capacity to make orchestral music sound big and beautiful and more expansive, but it also can make sound effects sound four times as big. That began the era of sound effects over music.&quot;

==Marketing==
Disney modeled its marketing campaign after the 1989 success of &quot;Batman&quot;, which was based on high-concept promotion. This included a McDonald&#x27;s promotional tie-in, and a Warren Beatty interview conducted by Barbara Walters on &quot;20/20&quot;. &quot;I find the media&#x27;s obsession with promotion and demographics upsetting,&quot; Beatty said. &quot;I find all this anti-cultural.&quot; Buena Vista Television aired a half-hour syndicated special beginning June 13, 1990, titled &quot;Dick Tracy: Behind the Badge...Behind the Scenes&quot;, with details about the making of the film.

In attempting to increase awareness for &quot;Dick Tracy&quot;, Disney added a new &quot;Roger Rabbit&quot; cartoon short (&quot;Roller Coaster Rabbit&quot;), and made two specific television advertisements centered on The Kid (Charlie Korsmo). In total, Disney commissioned 28 TV advertisements. Playmates Toys manufactured a line of 14 &quot;Dick Tracy&quot; figures.

It was Madonna&#x27;s idea to include the film as part of her Blond Ambition World Tour. Prior to the June 1990 theatrical release, Disney had already featured &quot;Dick Tracy&quot; in musical theatre stage shows in both Disneyland and the Walt Disney World Resort, using Stephen Sondheim and Danny Elfman&#x27;s music. &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote in June 1990 of Disney Stores &quot;selling nothing but &quot;Tracy&quot;-related merchandise&quot;.

Max Allan Collins lobbied to write the film&#x27;s novelization long before Disney had even greenlighted &quot;Dick Tracy&quot; in 1988. &quot;I hated the idea that anyone else would write a &quot;Tracy&quot; novel,&quot; Collins explained. After much conflict with Disney, leading to seven different printings of the novelization, the book was released in May 1990, published by Bantam Books. It sold almost one million copies prior to the film&#x27;s release. A graphic novel adaptation of the film was also released, written and illustrated by Kyle Baker.

Reruns of &quot;The Dick Tracy Show&quot; began airing to coincide with the release of the film, but stations in Los Angeles and New York pulled and edited the episodes when Asian and Hispanic groups protested the characters Joe Jitsu and Go Go Gomez as offensive stereotypes. A theme park ride for Disneyland, Disney-MGM Studios and Euro Disney Resort called &quot;Dick Tracy&#x27;s Crime Stoppers&quot; was planned but ultimately never built. Another tie-in for the movie was an ingenious plan in which 1,500 movie theaters were shipped t-shirts with the film&#x27;s title art on them, which fans could buy for $12 to $20 and wear to the movie, in lieu of buying tickets at the box office. According to &quot;Jornal do Brasil&quot;, more than 100 companies sold merchandise related to the film, with Macy&#x27;s reporting 1.5 million t-shirts sold, and according to &quot;New York&quot; magazine, it was perhaps McDonald&#x27;s largest promotion up to that point, backed by $40 million in cash and prizes.

==Reception==
===Release===
&quot;Dick Tracy&quot; had a benefit premiere at a small 300-seat theater in Woodstock, Illinois (the hometown of Tracy creator Chester Gould), June 13, 1990, while the production premiere occurred the next day at the Walt Disney World Village&#x27;s Pleasure Island in Lake Buena Vista, Florida. The film was released in the United States in 2,332 theaters June 15, 1990, earning $22.54 million in its opening weekend, including an estimated $1.5 million of t-shirt sales. This was the third-highest opening weekend of 1990, and Disney&#x27;s biggest ever. The film would hold the record for having the largest opening weekend for a live-action Disney film for six years until 1996 when &quot;The Rock&quot; surpassed it. &quot;Dick Tracy&quot; eventually grossed $103.74 million in the United States and Canada, and $59 million elsewhere, coming to a worldwide total of $162.74 million. &quot;Dick Tracy&quot; was also the ninth-highest-grossing film in America in 1990, and number twelve in worldwide totals.

Although Disney was impressed by the opening weekend gross, studio management was expecting the film&#x27;s total earnings to match &quot;Batman&quot;. Prior to its overseas release (and other revenue streams), the film was estimated to have generated a $57 million deficit for Disney. Studio chairman Jeffrey Katzenberg expressed disappointment in a studio memo that noted that &quot;Dick Tracy&quot; had cost about $100 million total to produce, market and promote. &quot;We made demands on our time, talent and treasury that, upon reflection, may not have been worth it,&quot; Katzenberg reported.

When released, it was preceded by the Roger Rabbit short &quot;Roller Coaster Rabbit&quot;.

===Critical response===
On the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 63%, based on 59 reviews, with an average rating of 5.9/10. The site&#x27;s critics&#x27; consensus reads: &quot;&quot;Dick Tracy&quot; is stylish, unique, and an undeniable technical triumph, but it ultimately struggles to rise above its two-dimensional artificiality.&quot; On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 68 out of 100, based on 24 critics, indicating &quot;generally favorable reviews&quot;. Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of &quot;B+&quot; on a scale of A+ to F.

Roger Ebert of the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; gave the film four stars out of four in his review, arguing that Warren Beatty succeeded in creating the perfect tone of nostalgia for the film. Ebert praised mostly the matte paintings, art direction and prosthetic makeup design. &quot;&quot;Dick Tracy&quot; is one of the most original and visionary fantasies I&#x27;ve seen on a screen,&quot; he wrote.

Vincent Canby of &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote, &quot;&quot;Dick Tracy&quot; has just about everything required of an extravaganza: a smashing cast, some great Stephen Sondheim songs, all of the technical wizardry that money can buy, and a screenplay that observes the fine line separating true comedy from lesser camp.&quot;

Owen Gleiberman of &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; gave a mixed review, but was impressed by Madonna&#x27;s performance. &quot;&quot;Dick Tracy&quot; is an honest effort but finally a bit of a folly. It could have used a little less color and a little more flesh and blood,&quot; Gleiberman concluded.

In his heavily negative review for &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, Desson Thomson criticized Disney&#x27;s hyped marketing campaign and the film in general. &quot;&quot;Dick Tracy&quot; is Hollywood&#x27;s annual celebration of everything that&#x27;s wrong with Hollywood,&quot; he stated.

Peter Travers of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; wrote that Warren Beatty, at 52 years old, was too old for the part. He also found similarities with &quot;Batman&quot;, in that both films involve &quot;a loner hero, a grotesque villain, a blond bombshell, a marketable pop soundtrack and a no-mercy merchandising campaign&quot;, Travers continued. &quot;But &quot;Batman&quot; possesses something else: a psychological depth that gives the audience a stake in the characters. &quot;Tracy&quot; sticks to its eye-poppingly brilliant surface. Though the film is a visual knockout, it&#x27;s emotionally impoverished.&quot;

Although Max Allan Collins (then a &quot;Dick Tracy&quot; comic-strip writer) had conflicts with Disney concerning the novelization, he gave the finished film a positive review. He praised Beatty for hiring an elaborate design team, and his decision to mimic the strip&#x27;s limited color palette. Collins also enjoyed Beatty&#x27;s performance, the prosthetic makeup, and characterization of the rogues gallery, as well as the Stephen Sondheim music. However, he believed the filmmakers still sacrificed the storyline in favor of the visual design.

===Accolades===
The film was nominated for seven Academy Awards (winning three). The film is currently tied with &quot;Black Panther&quot; for having the most wins for a comic book or comic strip movie.

===Legacy===
The film is recognized by American Film Institute in these lists:
* 2003: AFI&#x27;s 100 Years...100 Heroes &amp; Villains:
** Dick Tracy – Nominated Hero
* 2004: AFI&#x27;s 100 Years...100 Songs:
** &quot;Sooner or Later (I Always Get My Man)&quot; – Nominated
* 2006: AFI&#x27;s Greatest Movie Musicals – Nominated

Retrospective reviews called the film exceptionally unique. Writers for &quot;Vox&quot; and &quot;The Atlantic&quot; asserted that it was one of the most unique movies ever. Multiple authors contrast it with newer comic book movies. One article calls it a &quot;road not taken&quot; in comic book adaptations. The author praised &quot;Popeye&quot;, &quot;Dick Tracy&quot; and &quot;Hulk&quot; for their use of comic techniques, such as &quot;masking, paneling, and page layout&quot; in ways the DC Extended Universe and Marvel Cinematic Universe do not.

==Home media release==
The film was released on VHS December 18, 1990. It was first released on DVD in Europe in 2000, but domestic release in the U.S. was delayed until April 2, 2002, and without any special features. Shortly after the U.S. DVD release, rumors circulated on the Internet that Warren Beatty had planned to release a director&#x27;s cut under Disney&#x27;s &quot;Vista Series&quot; label; including at least ten extra minutes of footage. As of 1992, &quot;Dick Tracy&quot; sold 1 million copies in the U.S., according to &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot;.

The Blu-ray was released in the U.S. and Canada December 11, 2012. This release lacked special features, save for a digital copy.

==Possible sequel and legal issues==
Disney had hoped &quot;Dick Tracy&quot; would launch a successful franchise, like the &quot;Indiana Jones&quot; series, but Disney halted plans. In addition, executive producers Art Linson and Floyd Mutrux sued Beatty shortly after the release of the film, alleging they were owed profit participation from the film.

Beatty purchased the &quot;Dick Tracy&quot; film and television rights in 1985 from Tribune Media Services. He took the property to Walt Disney Studios, which optioned the rights in 1988. According to Beatty, Tribune attempted to reclaim the rights in 2002, and notified Disney—but not through the process outlined in the 1985 agreement. Beatty, who commented he had &quot;a very good idea&quot; for a sequel, believed Tribune violated various notification procedures that &quot;clouded the title&quot; to the rights, and made it &quot;commercially impossible&quot; for him to produce a sequel. He approached Tribune in 2004 to settle the situation, but the company said it had met the conditions to get back the rights.

Disney, which had no intention of producing a sequel, rejected Tribune&#x27;s claim, and gave back to Beatty most of the rights in May 2005. That same month, Beatty filed a lawsuit in the Los Angeles Superior Court, seeking $30 million in damages against Tribune and a declaration over the rights. Bertram Fields, Beatty&#x27;s lawyer, said the original 1985 agreement with Tribune was negotiated specifically to allow Beatty a chance to make another &quot;Dick Tracy&quot; film. &quot;It was very carefully done, and they just ignored it&quot;, he stated. &quot;Tribune is a big, powerful company, and they think they can just run roughshod over people. They picked the wrong guy.&quot;

Tribune believed the situation would be settled quickly, and was confident enough to begin developing a &quot;Dick Tracy&quot; live-action television series with Lorenzo di Bonaventura, Robert Newmyer and Outlaw Productions. The TV show was to have a contemporary setting, comparable to &quot;Smallville&quot;, and Di Bonaventura commented that if the TV show was successful, a feature film would likely follow. However, an August 2005 ruling by federal judge Dean D. Pregerson cleared the way for Beatty to sue Tribune. The April 2006 hearing ended without a ruling, but in July 2006, a Los Angeles judge ruled that the case could go to trial; Tribune&#x27;s request to end the suit in their favor was rejected. The legal battle between Beatty and Tribune continued. By March 2009, Tribune was in Chapter 11 bankruptcy, and lawyers for the company began to declare their ownership of television and film rights to &quot;Dick Tracy&quot;. &quot;Mr. Beatty&#x27;s conduct and wrongful claims have effectively locked away certain motion picture and television rights to the &quot;Dick Tracy&quot; property&quot;, lawyers for Tribune wrote in a filing. Fields responded that it was &quot;a nuisance lawsuit by a bankrupt company, and they should be ashamed of themselves.&quot;

In 2010, Turner Classic Movies broadcast the &quot;Dick Tracy Special&quot;. Shot in late 2008, Beatty enlisted cinematographer Emmanuel Lubezki and film critic Leonard Maltin to make the 30-minute television special, which featured Beatty as Tracy in a retrospective interview with Maltin. Maltin explicitly asked the fictional Tracy if Warren Beatty planned to make a sequel to the 1990 film, and he responded that he had heard about that, but Maltin needed to ask Beatty himself.

On March 25, 2011, U.S. District Court Judge Dean D. Pregerson granted Beatty&#x27;s request for a summary judgment, and ruled in the actor&#x27;s favor. Judge Pregerson wrote in his order that &quot;Beatty&#x27;s commencement of principal photography of his television special on November 8, 2008 was sufficient for him to retain the Dick Tracy rights.&quot; Beatty&#x27;s lawyer said the court found that Beatty had done everything contractually required of him to keep the rights to the character.

In June 2011, Beatty confirmed his intention to make a sequel to &quot;Dick Tracy&quot;, but he refused to discuss details. He said, &quot;I&#x27;m gonna make another one [but] I think it&#x27;s dumb talking about movies before you make them. I just don&#x27;t do it. It gives you the perfect excuse to avoid making them.&quot; When asked when the sequel would get made, he replied, &quot;I take so long to get around to making a movie that I don&#x27;t know when it starts.&quot;

In April 2016, Beatty again mentioned the possibility of producing a sequel when he attended CinemaCon.

In February 2023, Turner Classic Movies aired &quot;Dick Tracy Special: Tracy Zooms In&quot;, a 30-minute television special similar to the 2010 &quot;Dick Tracy Special&quot;. The special consists mostly of a Zoom interview, featuring Beatty appearing as both Tracy and himself, opposite Ben Mankiewicz and a returning Leonard Maltin. In it, Tracy criticizes aspects of the 1990 film adaptation to Beatty&#x27;s face, and suggests that a younger actor should take over the role of Tracy. It concludes with Beatty and Tracy meeting in person, and suggesting that &quot;Dick Tracy&quot; will return in the future.

Although there have not been any sequels in either television nor motion picture form, there have been sequels in novel form. Shortly after the release of the 1990 film, Max Allan Collins wrote &quot;Dick Tracy Goes to War&quot;. The story is set after the commencement of World War II, and involves Dick Tracy&#x27;s enlistment in the U.S. Navy, working for their Military Intelligence Division (as he did in the comic strip). In the story, Nazi saboteurs Black Pearl and Mrs. Pruneface (Pruneface&#x27;s widow) set up a sabotage/espionage operation out of Caprice&#x27;s old headquarters in Club Ritz. For their activities, they recruit B.B. Eyes, The Mole and Shaky. Their reign of terror, culminating in an attempt to bomb a weapons plant, is averted by Tracy. A year after &quot;War&quot; was released, Collins wrote a third novel, titled &quot;Dick Tracy Meets His Match&quot;, in which Tracy finally follows through on his marriage proposal to Tess Trueheart.

<doc id="725990" wikidata="Q1922133" url="?curid=725990" title="Generation X (comics)">
<text>Generation X is a fictional superhero team appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. A spin-off of the X-Men, the team was created by writer Scott Lobdell and artist Chris Bachalo. Generation X debuted during the 1994 &quot;Phalanx Covenant&quot; storyline, and appeared in their own monthly series in September 1994 with &quot;Generation X&quot; #1 (November 1994).

Generation X consisted of teenage mutants designed to reflect the cynicism and complexity of the series&#x27; namesake demographic. Unlike its predecessor the New Mutants, the team was not mentored by X-Men founder Charles Xavier at his New York estate, but by Banshee and former supervillainess Emma Frost at a splinter school in western Massachusetts.

==The team==

=== Volume 1 ===
Unlike the X-Men and New Mutants, Generation X did not attend Xavier&#x27;s School for Gifted Youngsters in upstate New York or learn from Professor Xavier himself. Instead, they trained at the Massachusetts Academy, located in Berkshire County, Massachusetts, and were mentored by Banshee, an Irish X-Man who possessed a &quot;sonic scream&quot;, and the former villain White Queen, an aristocratic telepath.

Generation X consisted of:
* Chamber (Jonothon &quot;Jono&quot; Starsmore), a British mutant who produced huge blasts of energy from his upper chest. When his powers first manifested, they destroyed the lower half of his face and chest, leaving him with only his limited telepathic powers with which to communicate, and releasing him from any necessity to eat, drink, or breathe. Because of this, he is characteristically sullen and bitter.
* Gaia, formerly the otherworldly Guardian of the Citadel of the Universal Amalgamator, which could potentially be misused to combine all sentient consciousnesses into a single entity. She was freed by Synch and eventually joined the team, but soon left to explore this world.
* Husk (Paige Guthrie), a Kentucky coal miner&#x27;s daughter who could shed her skin, revealing a different substance each time. She is the younger sister of The New Mutants&#x27; Cannonball, and elder sister of Icarus.
* Jubilee (Jubilation Lee), a Chinese-American &quot;mall rat&quot; from Beverly Hills, California who could produce explosive energy. Jubilee had been a junior member of the X-Men in the early 1990s, and joined Generation X to learn more about her powers.
* M (Monet St. Croix), a &quot;perfect&quot; young woman born into a rich family from Monaco who could fly, possessed super strength and had telepathic abilities. Her arrogant manner was an annoyance to her teammates and her habit of going into deep trances or fugue states when deep in thought was a mystery to her teachers. Mysteries surrounding the St. Croix family would play a big part in the series.
* Mondo, a cheerful, laidback Samoan mutant who could take on the texture of objects he touched. Mondo eventually betrayed the team and was apparently killed by Bastion, but it was later revealed that this was a clone. The real Mondo appeared two years later, but as a villain teamed with Juggernaut and Black Tom Cassidy.
* Penance, a silent, childlike and mysterious mutant who possessed diamond hard, red skin and razor-sharp claws. Penance appeared mysteriously at the Massachusetts Academy and at first, little was known about her. According to the Generation X Ashcan, the writers originally intended her to be a girl named Yvette from Yugoslavia. A hint of this can be seen when her mind is read by Emma Frost, revealing Eastern European tanks on the march in her memories. This background was later changed by the following creative team.
* Skin (Angelo Espinosa), a former reluctant teenage gang member on the streets of East Los Angeles who possessed six feet of extra skin. He could stretch his extremities, but mostly considered his mutation, which caused him to have sagging gray skin and painful headaches, a curse.
* Synch (Everett Thomas), an African-American teenager from St. Louis, known for his pleasant, supportive temperament, who could copy the powers of other mutants/superhumans within physical proximity.

=== Volume 2 ===
Following the war between the mutants and Inhumans, Kitty Pryde has Magik teleport X-Haven from Limbo to Central Park and renamed it the Xavier Institute for Mutant Education and Outreach. Jubilee teaches one of the classes consisting of students who are considered liabilities during missions and with personalities ill-fitting of an ambassador.
* Bling! (Roxanne &quot;Roxy&quot; Washington), an openly bisexual student with body made of diamond-hard material.
* Eye-Boy (Trevor Hawkins), one of the new mutants to manifest their powers after the war between the X-Men and Avengers whose body is covered in eyeballs, which gives him expert marksman skills and the ability to see through illusions, track peoples auras, see electrical and magical waves, and spot people&#x27;s weaknesses.
* Hindsight (Nathaniel Carver), a new student who can use psychometry to see someone&#x27;s past through skin contact.
* Kid Omega (Quentin Quire), an Omega level mutant possessing advanced cognitive and telepathic abilities.
* Morph (Benjamin Deeds), an average college student who has the power to shapeshift and chemically induce people into liking him.
* Nature Girl (Lin Li), a quiet student with heightened affinity for the natural world.

==After the series==

===Banshee===
Banshee, distraught and possibly suffering from a breakdown, founds the X-Corps, a group of mutant adventurers who came into conflict with the X-Men over their questionable methodology and membership. Among the group are several former members of the Brotherhood of Mutants. It is revealed that Banshee was having the new Mastermind, the daughter of the deceased original Mastermind, manipulate the Brotherhood&#x27;s members into having them work with him. However, it turns out that Mystique was posing as one of the members, Surge, and she is working with the new Mastermind behind Banshee&#x27;s back. Mystique helps the brainwashed members to revolt; two members of the X-Corps are killed and Mystique stabs Banshee through the throat before being stopped by the X-Men. Banshee survives the attack and recuperates in the hospital.

In 2006&#x27;s &quot;X-Men: Deadly Genesis&quot;, Banshee is killed by Vulcan, Cyclops and Havok&#x27;s long-lost brother, while attempting to rescue an airplane full of innocents. Later, Banshee&#x27;s daughter Siryn takes the title of Banshee in his honor. Sean is latter resurrected by the Apocalypse Twins by the Death Seed as a Horseman of Death.

===Chamber===
Chamber starred a four-issue mini-series, &quot;X-Men Icons: Chamber&quot;, written by Brian K. Vaughan. In it, he went undercover at Empire State University as a student to find out who killed six openly mutant students.

Later, after a reluctant recruitment into the X-Men, Chamber was an active part of the team in battles with long-time X-Men villains Mystique and Vanisher. He subsequently underwent a mission for the X-Men (under the &#x27;guidance&#x27; of Wolverine) to infiltrate Weapon X and learn the truth about the team. During his time there, Chamber had his face and most of his body restored by Weapon X, as an incentive to join them. He later disappeared with the rest of Weapon X when trying to contact Logan about &#x27;Neverland&#x27;.

He subsequently reappeared as an attendee of the Excelsior support group (with his mouth and chest destroyed once more, supposedly in a bar fight) within the &quot;Runaways&quot; series, claiming he was &quot;only there for the free pizza&quot;, despite once again no longer having a mouth with which to eat. It was revealed (to the reader, not to the rest of Excelsior) that he was merely someone posing as Chamber.

A mini-series titled &quot;Generation M&quot; debuted in November 2005, focusing on the after-effects from &quot;House of M&quot;, in which Scarlet Witch uses her hex/mutant powers to wish for &quot;no more mutants&quot;. The first issue revealed a powerless Chamber (on life-support, due to missing the bottom of his face and most of his chest).

Chamber later showed up in &quot;New Excalibur&quot; #9 (September 2006) as a patient at a London Hospital, recounting to a so-called Dr. Hartley the story of how right before his powers burned out on &quot;M-Day&quot; they went supernova, once again destroying his face and chest. They are interrupted by Pete Wisdom, who offers Chamber Excalibur&#x27;s help. As he leaves the two alone for a quick cigarette break, Hartley kidnaps Chamber. Later, Chamber awakes to find himself fully healed, but looking similar to the X-Men villain Apocalypse as a side-effect. He finds himself a guest of the new Clan Akkaba, worshippers of Apocalypse who had originally appeared in the Marvel limited series, &quot;X-Men: Apocalypse vs. Dracula&quot;. In fact, Chamber&#x27;s great-grandfather and Hartley, revealed to be Frederick Slade from the aforementioned limited series, were the only survivors of the original Clan Akkaba. Slade reveals that they are all descendants of Apocalypse and that Apocalypse&#x27;s blood healed Chamber, though he no longer has any powers. Chamber tells them he wants nothing to do with them and is allowed to leave. As he walks outside, he meets Excalibur and tells them in no uncertain words that he doesn&#x27;t want their help or to have anything to do with any X-team.

After investigating the abandoned headquarters of Clan Akkaba, &quot;New Excalibur&quot; discovers that Chamber was lied to, and that he is indeed still empowered. The consequences of this storyline have yet to be resolved. Next, he appeared in &quot;New Warriors&quot;, going under the codename &quot;Decibel&quot;, with Jubilee referring to him as Jono and sporting the same physical appearance given to him by Clan Akkaba. Like most of the team, his new powers are more technological in nature, and it appears he can form solid energy projections or sonic blasts much like Songbird or Banshee. After the Age of X storyline concluded, Chamber appeared at the Jean Grey School with his mutant powers returned and is teaching mutants with physical deformities how to adapt to life with them.

===Emma Frost===
Immediately after &quot;Generation X&quot;&#x27;s cancellation, Emma became a core member of Grant Morrison&#x27;s &quot;New X-Men&quot; team where she demonstrated the secondary mutation of being able to transform her body into diamond. During this time, she also began a romantic relationship with Cyclops. She has remained a central figure in nearly every incarnation of the X-Men since.

===Husk===
Husk, along with Jubilee and M, appeared as part of Banshee&#x27;s X-Corps, dubbed &quot;Banshee&#x27;s Angels&quot;. After Banshee was badly injured by Mystique, Husk returned to the X-Men&#x27;s school in Westchester. She became a regular cast member in &quot;Uncanny X-Men&quot; under writer Chuck Austen, and experienced a brief flirtation with Angel despite being many years younger than him. She later drifted into the background as a supporting X-Men character, but sided with Wolverine in the X-Men&#x27;s &quot;Schism&quot;, where she served as a faculty member at the Jean Grey School for Higher Learning in &quot;Wolverine &amp; the X-Men&quot;. She began to lose control of her powers, and when questioned by Shadowcat, abruptly quit her position.

===Jubilee===
Jubilee made several appearances in &quot;Uncanny X-Men&quot; following the end of &quot;Generation X&quot;, where she appeared first as a member of Banshee&#x27;s X-Corps alongside M and Husk and later as an ancillary character in Chuck Austen&#x27;s run.

She briefly had her own self-titled series, written by Robert Kirkman. While it was originally intended to be an ongoing series aimed at the teen market, launched as part of Marvel Comics&#x27; Tsunami line, it was retroactively dubbed a mini-series and canceled with issue #6, due to disappointing sales.

Jubilee was also depowered during the &quot;Decimation&quot; storyline and was shown lamenting her lost powers, but reluctant to ask Wolverine for help, convincing herself that she needed to grow up and handle it herself. Subsequently, she was briefly shown in issue #2 of &quot;Generation M&quot; and later seen in &quot;Wolverine: Origins&quot; #10. After being injured after a battle with Omega Red, she was taken away for medical attention by S.H.I.E.L.D. She since returned in the second issue of &quot;New Warriors&quot; (vol. 4), in which she is known as Wondra and uses technology to mimic superpowers, in particular gauntlets which enhance her strength to superhuman levels. Recruited by Night Thrasher, she was suspicious of his motivations and his most outspoken critic.

During the &quot;Curse of the Mutants&quot; storyline, Jubilee became a vampire. A subsequent four-issue mini-series, &quot;Wolverine and Jubilee&quot;, detailed her process of coming to terms with this change, and she remains a central cast member in &quot;X-Men&quot;, having found and adopted a baby named Shogo.

===M===
M appeared for a time as part of Banshee&#x27;s X-Corps along with Husk and Jubilee, following which she became an employee of X-Factor Investigations, in &quot;X-Factor&quot; (vol. 3). She was an instrumental part of many of their investigations and, along with Strong Guy, considered the muscle of the group. After being seduced by a dupe of Multiple Man&#x27;s, she developed a romantic interest in him, but his feelings laid with her teammate Siryn, which led to friction within the group. She has since made her peace with both Siryn and Madrox. M is currently appearing as a central character in Magneto&#x27;s &quot;Uncanny X-Men&quot;.

===Penance===
Penance (now renamed &quot;Hollow&quot;) appeared in the limited series &quot;Loners&quot;, where she was held captive by a ring of drug makers in order to harvest her genetics to create MGH. She was accidentally freed by Ricochet. After a battle with a crazed Phil Urich, she left, following him. She re-appeared in late 2011 as a new student at Avengers Academy.

===Skin===
Jubilee and Skin were shown to be living in LA in a story in the anthology series &quot;X-Men Unlimited&quot;, sharing an apartment and attempting to adjust to civilian life. They were both, however, attacked by a mutant hate group in 2003 and Skin died after being crucified on the X-Men&#x27;s front lawn. Writer Chuck Austen mistakenly used an incorrect surname when referring to the character after his death; however, a gravestone with the correct surname was shown in the anthology series &quot;X-Men Unlimited&quot;, where Iceman reminisced about their brief friendship. He has recently been resurrected on Krakoa and currently is not on a team.

=== Synch ===
Having died near the end of Generation X, Synch was one of the first mutants resurrected on Krakoa. He was placed on a team along with Darwin and Wolverine that was sent to the Vault, a pocket dimension with a vastly accelerated flow of time and home to dangerous superhumans, with the intent of gaining information about the mysterious place. While approximately three months had passed in the real world, more than five hundred years passed in the Vault before Synch and the others were able to escape and relay the information back to the X-Men.

===The TV film===
In February 1996, the Fox Network aired a made-for-television Generation X movie, produced by Marvel Entertainment. The film featured Banshee and Emma Frost as the headmasters of Xavier&#x27;s School for Gifted Youngsters and M, Skin, Mondo, Jubilee and two new characters, Buff and Refrax, as students (Chamber, Husk, Synch, and Penance were not written in because the budget didn&#x27;t allow for the special effects their powers required). The team battled a mad scientist who used a machine to develop psychic powers. Plans to develop a syndicated series that would air on the same night as popular sci-fi thriller &quot;The X-Files&quot; were abandoned.

===X-Men &#x27;92===
Issue 8 of the Infinite comic series ended with a version of Generation X appearing as new students under the X-Men. This team will include Jubilee, Chamber, Husk, Skin, and M.
