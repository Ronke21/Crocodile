<text>Occidental Petroleum Corporation (often abbreviated Oxy in reference to its ticker symbol and logo) is an American company engaged in hydrocarbon exploration in the United States and the Middle East as well as petrochemical manufacturing in the United States, Canada, and Chile. It is incorporated under the Delaware General Corporation Law and headquartered in Houston. The company ranked 183rd on the 2021 Fortune 500 based on its 2020 revenues and 670th on the 2021 Forbes Global 2000.

==History==
Occidental Petroleum was founded in Los Angeles, CA in 1920. In 1957, Armand Hammer became the company&#x27;s president and CEO after acquiring a controlling stake. The 1960s marked a period of expansion as Occidental established operations in Peru, Venezuela, Bolivia, Trinidad, and the United Kingdom. In 1961, the company discovered the Lathrop Gas Field in Lathrop, California.

In 1965, Occidental won exploration rights in Libya, where it operated until 1986 when United States economic sanctions led to the suspension of activities. The company diversified in 1968 by entering the chemical business with the acquisition of Hooker Chemical Company, following the Love Canal contamination incident.

In 1971, Occidental received approval to build an oil refinery in Canvey Island in Essex, England, but construction ceased in 1975 due to the 1970s energy crisis. The site remained derelict; the tanks and the chimney were subsequently demolished. Only some concrete foundations and the river jetty remain extant.

In 1973, Occidental negotiated a phosphate-for-natural-gas deal with the Soviet Union, in which the Hammer-controlled firms Occidental Petroleum and Tower International would export to the Soviet Union phosphate, which Occidental mined in northern Florida, in return for the Soviet Union exporting from Odessa and Ventspils through Hammer&#x27;s firms natural gas that would be converted into ammonia, potash, and urea. The total value of this trade was estimated at $20 billion. The construction of Soviet port facilities, designed by Hammer&#x27;s firms, was partially financed by the Export-Import Bank as endorsed by Nixon.

In August 1973, Libya nationalized 51% of Occidental&#x27;s assets in the country. In February 1974, the company announced a 35-year oil exploration agreement with Libya. 81% of the oil extracted by Occidental Petroleum was to go to the Libyan government, with 19% retained by Occidental Petroleum. In 1986, the company suspended operation in the country due to economic sanctions imposed by the United States. In 2005, Occidental and its partner, Liwa, won 8 out of 15 exploration spots on the EPSA-4 auction, making both companies among the first to enter the Libyan market since the United States lifted its embargo on Libya.

The company was one of the first companies to research developing oil shale.

In 1983, Occidental and Ecopetrol, the Colombian state-owned oil company, discovered the giant Caño Limón oilfield in Arauca. In July 1996, the company sold its interest in 3 oilfields in the Congo to the Congolese government for $215 million. The following year, it paid $3.65 billion to acquire the Elk Hills Oil Field.

In 1986, the company formed a joint venture with Church &amp; Dwight, which makes Arm &amp; Hammer products, for a potassium carbonate plant at Muscle Shoals, Alabama.

On July 6, 1988, an explosion and subsequent inferno on the company&#x27;s Piper Alpha platform in the Scottish North Sea, resulted in 167 fatalities in what remains the world&#x27;s most deadly offshore disaster.

In 1990, Armand Hammer died and Ray R. Irani became chairman and chief executive officer of the company. In 1991, Occidental sold its stake in IBP, Inc. In 1993, the company sold its remaining coal operations.

In 2006, the government of Ecuador seized the company&#x27;s interest in block 15 of the Amazon Rainforest, forcing the company to take a $306 million after-tax charge. In 2016, Ecuador agreed to pay $980 million in restitution to the company, down from the original award of $1.77 billion. The agreement was based on a 2012 arbitration award from the International Center for Settlement of Investment Disputes.

In 2007, Occidental&#x27;s compensation policies came under scrutiny after it was announced that Irani received $460 million in compensation in 2006. In May 2011, Irani retired as CEO after CalSTRS and Relational Investors, two major shareholders, objected to the company&#x27;s compensation policies for top executives. President Stephen I. Chazen was named CEO to replace Irani and in 2013, shareholders ousted Irani as chairman. Despite his outlandish compensation, during Irani&#x27;s tenure, the company grew from a collection of unrelated businesses to one that focuses on oil and gas and the market capitalization of the company went from $5.5 billion to $80 billion.

In December 2010, Occidental acquired shale oil properties in the Williston Basin in North Dakota for $1.4 billion. These assets, as well as other assets acquired by Oxy in the Williston Basin, were sold in 2015 for $600 million. The company also sold its proven and probable reserves of in Argentina to Sinopec, a subsidiary of China Petrochemical Corporation, and acquired properties in South Texas and North Dakota for $3.2 billion.

In January 2011, Occidental partnered with Abu Dhabi&#x27;s state oil company in developing the Shah Field, one of the largest natural gas fields in the Middle East, through a joint venture known as Al Hosn Gas. Al Hosn Gas became operational in 2015.

In September 2014, Occidental moved its headquarters to Houston, Texas. In November, the company sold its 50% interest in BridgeTex Pipeline Company, owner of a 300,000 barrel-per-day crude oil pipeline system that extends from Colorado City, Texas to Texas City, Texas, for $1.075 billion. In December 2014, Occidental distributed 80.5% of its shares in California Resources Corporation, the largest producer of oil and natural gas on a gross-operated barrels of oil equivalent basis in California, to Occidental shareholders and distributed its remaining stake to shareholders in March 2016. In June 2017, the company sold land in the Permian Basin for $600 million and used the proceeds to acquire other assets in the area.

In October 2015, Occidental completed the first phase of a $500 million carbon dioxide flooding project in Hobbs, New Mexico. In March 2017, the company and its 50/50 joint venture partner Mexichem began operations of a 1.2-billion-pound per year capacity ethylene cracker at the OxyChem plant in Ingleside, Texas, along with pipelines and storage at Markham, Texas.

In May 2016, Vicki Hollub, who had worked at Occidental since 1981 and joined the board in 2015, became the chief executive officer of the company, the first female to serve as chief executive officer of a major U.S. oil and gas company.

In January 2018, Occidental was found to be partially responsible for the Bayou Corne sinkhole, along with Texas Brine Company and Vulcan Materials Company.

In October 2020, Occidental sold its onshore operations in Colombia to the Carlyle Group for $825 million. The deal included operations and working interests in the Llanos Norte, Middle Magdalena, and Putumayo Basins. Working interest on exploration offshore in Colombia remained under ownership of Oxy in partnership with Ecopetrol, with plans to drill the first well by 2024.

=== Acquisitions ===
In 1981, Occidental acquired IBP, Inc., one of largest producers of beef and pork products in the United States. In 1988, the company acquired Cain Chemical for $2 billion.

In 2005, the company acquired Vintage Petroleum for $3.8 billion. In 2008, it acquired a 10% stake in Plains All American Pipeline. The company also acquired assets from Plains Exploration &amp; Production for $1.3 billion. In October 2009, Occidental acquired Citigroup&#x27;s controversial Phibro energy-trading business, for its net asset value of approximately $250 million. The unit was managed by Andrew J. Hall, who received compensation of approximately $100 million per year in 2007 and 2008. After the acquisition, the division reported its first losses since the 1990s. In 2016, Phibro was wound down and sold.

In August 2019, Occidental acquired Anadarko Petroleum for $57 billion, making the deal the world&#x27;s fourth biggest oil and gas acquisition to date.

In August 2023, Occidental acquired all the outstanding equity of the direct air capture technology company, Carbon Engineering for $1.1 billion. In December, the company acquired a Permian producer, CrownRock, for $12 billion. The acquisition was completed in August 2024.

==Operations==
===Oil and gas===
The company&#x27;s oil and gas operations are concentrated in two geographic areas: the United States and the Middle East, with some ventures in South America. As of December 31, 2020, Occidental had of oil equivalent net proved reserves, of which 51% was petroleum, 19% was natural gas liquids, and 30% was natural gas. In 2020, the company had production of per day.

====United States====
In 2020, the company&#x27;s United States operations produced per day, representing 77% of the company&#x27;s worldwide production, including per day in Permian Basin, where Occidental is the largest operator and oil producer. The company produced per day from unconventional oil directional drilling via Permian Resources and per day using a technique called enhanced oil recovery, whereby carbon dioxide and water are injected into underground formations to extract the oil and gas. The company also produced per day in the Denver Basin.

====Middle East====
The company&#x27;s oil and gas operations in the Middle East are in Oman, Qatar, and the United Arab Emirates and are via production sharing agreements. The region produced per day, representing approximately 19% of 2020 total production. The region also held 28% of the company&#x27;s proved reserves in 2020.

The company is the largest independent oil producer in Oman. In Qatar, the company is the second-largest oil producer offshore and is a partial owner in the Dolphin Gas Project, which delivers gas to Oman and the United Arab Emirates.

====South America====
In Colombia, Anadarko Colombia, a subsidiary of Oxy, and Ecopetrol entered into a joint exploration agreement in May 2022 for offshore exploration in deep waters of the Caribbean, with plans to drill the world&#x27;s deepest offshore oil well by 2024.

In Peru, Anadarko Peru, a subsidiary of Oxy, completed the initial phase of a 3D marine seismic acquisition project in northern Peruvian waters in 2024.

===Chemical===
OxyChem, a wholly-owned subsidiary, manufactures polyvinyl chloride (PVC) resins, chlorine, and sodium hydroxide (caustic soda) used in plastics, pharmaceuticals, and water treatment chemicals. Other products manufactured by the company include caustic potash, chlorinated organics, sodium silicates, chlorinated cyanuric acid (isocyanurate), and calcium chloride. OxyChem has manufacturing facilities in the United States, Canada, and Chile. In a joint venture with Church &amp; Dwight, OxyChem owns Armand Products Company, which sells potassium carbonate and potassium bicarbonate.

=== Decarbonization projects ===
In June 2024, Occidental Petroleum signed a memorandum of understanding with TAE Technologies to explore commercial opportunities for using TAE&#x27;s nuclear fusion technology to provide clean electricity and heat for Occidental&#x27;s direct air capture (DAC) projects. DAC is an energy-intensive process that involves removing from the atmosphere, and the partnership aims to address the energy needs of DAC with low-carbon power solutions. TAE Technologies, known for its advanced nuclear fusion research, plans to have a demonstration project by 2025 and a commercial facility in the 2030s.

==Controversies==
===Lobbying to do business in Libya===
The company began operations in Libya in 1965 and operated there until economic sanctions were imposed in 1986 by the United States. The company was one of the first American companies to resume negotiations in Libya after the sanctions were lifted in 2004. In 2008, the company, along with 5 other oil companies, was criticized for hiring Hogan Lovells to lobby to exempt Libya from a law written by U.S. Senator Frank Lautenberg (D-NJ) to assist American terror victims in seizing assets of countries found culpable in terror attacks, such as the Libyan bombing of Pan Am Flight 103 over Lockerbie in 1988. and to remove a provision in the Dodd–Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act that requires disclosure of payments to foreign governments. In early 2011, the company ceased exploration activities and production operations in Libya due to the growing civil unrest in the country and U.S. sanctions. In June 2011, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and United Kingdom prosecutors requested information from the company, ExxonMobil and ConocoPhillips related to the Libyan Investment Authority (LIA), an investment firm controlled by Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi, to determine if there were any violations of international bribery laws. The Libyan Investment Authority&#x27;s investments were frozen by the U.S. government in early 2011 following the Gaddafi regime&#x27;s attacks on Libyan civilians. In 2016, the company ceased operations in Libya.

===Environmental record===
In 2017, the company was ranked 55th on the Carbon Majors Report, a list of the Top 100 producers and their cumulative greenhouse gas emissions from 1988-2015.

The company has stated that its use of enhanced oil recovery for a portion of its production is one way it helps mitigate its high emissions.

====Cleanup of the Copper Basin====
In 1982, the company acquired land in the Copper Basin in Tennessee, formerly the site of the Burra Burra Mine, where copper and sulfur had been mined in the 1800s. In 2016, Occidental agreed to spend $50 million to clean up the Copper Basin and restore the water quality of its creeks.

====Love Canal====

Since the 1920s, several companies and the United States Armed Forces used the Love Canal as a chemical disposal site. In 1942, Occidental predecessor Hooker Chemical Company began disposing of chemical waste at the site and, in 1947, it became the sole owner and user of the land. In 1952, the site was filled to capacity and closed off. The company leased the land to the local school board in 1953. Later in the 1950s, the school board requested that the company sell the land, and threatened to use eminent domain. The school board intended to build a school on an unused area of the dump.

A school was built on the site, and later a middle-class residential district was built on land adjacent to the site. The construction broke through the clay seal containing the waste. In 1968, Hooker Chemical was purchased by Occidental. In 1978, residents became concerned about unusual health issues in the region, including high rates of cancer and birth defects. This subsequently became a national news story, and in 1980, president Jimmy Carter declared a federal emergency in the area. Residents were eventually relocated, and the company paid $129 million in restitution.

====Oleum spill====
On Saturday, October 11, 2008, oleum was accidentally spilled at a facility in Petrolia, Pennsylvania which belonged to Indspec, an affiliate of Occidental Chemical Corporation. Oleum is a chemical mixture of sulfuric acid and sulfur trioxide. The accident contaminated the ventilation system and caused a cloud of toxic gas. Over 2,000 residents had to be evacuated for the day. The spill was caused by an auxiliary pump power supply which lacked safety interlocks to prevent tank overfilling.

=== Bangladesh ===
On 14 June 1997, an explosion at the Magurchhaqra gas field in Kamalganj Upazila, Moulvibazar District of Bangladesh destroyed large areas of Lawachara National Park and nearby areas. Occidental was drilling at the gas field which was later abandoned. The explosion damaged 28 tea gardens in the area. It was estimated to have caused 90 to 140 billion BDT in damages. The government of Bangladesh claimed compensation from Occidental but it left the country handing over the well to Unocal which later sold the interests to Chevron.

====Colombia====
From 1992 to 2001, the company tried to drill for oil in the territory of the U&#x27;wa people, in northeast Colombia. The locals resisted, concerned about environmental degradation and fears that development would bring strangers and be a target for guerrilla warfare. There also were tribal beliefs that oil is the &quot;blood of the earth&quot; and should not be removed. In 2002, after years of shareholder resolutions, legal battles, protests, and a failed test well, the company abandoned the project. Repsol took over the project.

====Caño Limón====

On December 13, 1998, 17 civilians, including 7 children, were killed when the Colombian Air Force (CAF) dropped a cluster bomb in the hamlet of Santo Domingo, Colombia, after AirScan, Occidental&#x27;s security contractor, misidentified it as a hostile guerrilla target. Groups such as FARC and the National Liberation Army were active in the area. Three employees of AirScan were flying the Skymaster plane from which they provided the Colombian military with the coordinates to drop the bombs. The operation had been planned by the CAF and AirScan at Occidental&#x27;s complex in Caño Limón. In April 2003, Luis Alberto Galvis Mujica, a witness and survivor of the accident, sued Occidental. The courts ruled that Occidental was not liable for the incident.

====&quot;Maynas Carijano v. Occidental Petroleum&quot;====
On May 10, 2007, a group of 25 Achuar Peruvians, a group of Indigenous peoples, filed suit against the company, demanding environmental remediation and reparations for environmental degradation allegedly caused by the company between 1971 and 2000, when it drilled in Block 1-AB in Peru. The plaintiffs claimed that the company violated technical standards and environmental law when it dumped a total of of toxic oil by-products, such as cadmium, lead, and arsenic, in drainage basins used by the Achuar people to fish, drink, and bathe. This environmental damage was alleged to have caused premature deaths and birth defects. A 2006 study by the Ministry of Health of Peru, found that all but 2 of the 199 people tested had levels of cadmium in their blood above safe levels.

The Achuar were represented by EarthRights International and the law firm Schonbrun DeSimone Seplow Harris &amp; Hoffman LLP.

On March 3, 2010, EarthRights International argued to the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit that the case should be litigated in Los Angeles, where the company was headquartered. The court agreed with a trial in the United States, overturning the decision of the lower courts, and, in 2013, the United States Supreme Court refused to hear the company&#x27;s appeal. In March 2015, the company made a settlement for an undisclosed amount, with the funds to be used for health, education, and nutrition projects in five Achuar communities in the Corrientes River basin.

==== Anadarko Petroleum ====
In 2019, Occidental Petroleum acquired Anadarko Petroleum, inheriting a significant legacy of environmental infractions including the largest environmental contamination settlement in American history, involvement with the &quot;Deepwater Horizon&quot; BP disaster and fines under the Clean Water Act.

The deal was clinched as investor and Berkshire Hathaway CEO Warren Buffett pledged $10 billion to finance the deal in exchange for 100,000 shares of cumulative perpetual preferred stock with a value of $100,000 per share. Buffett and Berkshire also received a warrant to purchase up to 80 million more shares at an exercise price of $62.50 a share.

===Political record===
====Contributions====
Occidental has disclosed its contributions to political action committees, lobbyists, and trade associations on its website.

In 2005, the company was among 53 entities which contributed the maximum of $250,000 to the Second inauguration of George W. Bush.

The company also donated between $10,000 and $25,000 to the Clinton Foundation.

====Gore family====
Former CEO Armand Hammer was a long time friend of former U.S. Senator Albert Gore, Sr. and Gore was a member of the board of directors of the company. In September 1972, after he lost an election for the United States Senate in 1970, Gore became the head of Island Creek Coal Company, an Occidental subsidiary. Much of the company&#x27;s coal and phosphate production was in Tennessee, the state Gore represented in the Senate, and Gore owned shares in the company. The company liquidated its coal assets in 1993 after Hammer died.

Former Vice President of the United States Al Gore was criticized by environmentalists when he inherited shares in the company after the death of his father in 1998; however, the shares were immediately sold.

In 1998, the U.S. government sold the Elk Hills Oil Field to Occidental for $3.65 billion after an auction process that involved selling the field in segments and offering it to multiple bidders. However, critics cited the Gore family&#x27;s involvement with the company as evidence of graft.

===Safety record===
In 1999, OxyChem achieved Star Status under OSHA&#x27;s Voluntary Protection Programs as being among the safest work sites in the U.S.

====Piper Alpha====

On July 6, 1988, the company&#x27;s Piper Alpha offshore production platform in the North Sea was destroyed when an out of service gas condensate pump was started with its pressure safety valve removed. The subsequent gas leak, explosion and fire resulted in the deaths of 167 workers in what remains the world&#x27;s deadliest offshore disaster. The subsequent inquiry blamed the accident on inadequate maintenance and safety procedures by Occidental, though no charges were brought.

===Greenmail===
In 1984, billionaire David Murdock owned about 5% of the company and was a member of its board of directors, after the company acquired IBP, Inc., of which Murdock owned 19%. After disagreements between Murdock and then CEO Armand Hammer, the company paid greenmail to buy Murdock&#x27;s shares at $40.09 each, while the market price was $28.75.

=== Price-fixing lawsuit ===
In January 2024, a class action lawsuit was filed by drivers in three US states accusing Occidental, along with seven other oil and gas producers, of an illegal price-fixing scheme to constrain production of shale oil that led to American drivers paying more for gasoline than they would have in a competitive market.

<text>The Place Vendôme (), earlier known as the Place Louis-le-Grand, and also as the Place Internationale, is a square in the 1st arrondissement of Paris, France, located to the north of the Tuileries Gardens and east of the Église de la Madeleine. It is the starting point of the Rue de la Paix. Its regular architecture by Jules Hardouin-Mansart and pedimented screens canted across the corners give the rectangular Place Vendôme the aspect of an octagon. The original Vendôme Column at the centre of the square was erected by Napoleon I to commemorate the Battle of Austerlitz; it was torn down on 16 May 1871, by decree of the Paris Commune, but subsequently re-erected and remains a prominent feature on the square today.

==History==

The Place Vendôme was begun in 1698 as a monument to the glory of the armies of Louis XIV, the Grand Monarque, and called the Place des Conquêtes, to be renamed the Place Louis le Grand, when the conquests proved temporary. An over life-size equestrian statue of the king by François Girardon (1699) was donated by the city authorities and set up in its centre. It is believed to be the first large modern equestrian statue to be cast in a single piece. It was destroyed in the French Revolution; however, there is a small version in the Louvre. This led to the popular joke that while Henri IV dwelled among the people by the Pont Neuf, and Louis XIII among the aristocrats of the Place des Vosges, Louis XIV preferred the company of the tax farmers in the Place Vendôme; each reflecting the group they had favoured in life.

The site of the square was formerly the &quot;hôtel&quot; of César de Bourbon, Duke of Vendôme, the illegitimate son of Henry IV and his mistress Gabrielle d&#x27;Estrées. Hardouin-Mansart bought the building and its gardens, with the idea of converting it into building lots as a profitable speculation. The plan did not materialize, and Louis XIV&#x27;s Minister of Finance, Louvois, purchased the piece of ground, with the object of building a square, modelled on the successful Place des Vosges of the previous century. Louvois came into financial difficulties and nothing came of his project, either. After his death, the king purchased the plot and commissioned Hardouin-Mansart to design a house-front that the buyers of plots round the square would agree to adhere to. When the state finances ran low, the financier John Law took on the project, built himself a residence behind one of the façades, and the square was complete by 1720, just as his paper-money Mississippi bubble burst. Law suffered a major blow when he was forced to pay back taxes amounting to some tens of millions of dollars. With no way to pay such an amount, he was forced to sell the property he owned on the square. The buyers were members of the exiled Condé branch of the House of Bourbon who later returned to the country to reclaim their land in the town of Vendôme itself. Between 1720 and 1797, they acquired much of the square, including a freehold to parts of the site on which the Hôtel Ritz Paris now stands and in which they still maintain apartments. Their intention to restore a family palace on the site was dependent on the possible intentions of the adjacent Justice Ministry to expand its premises.

The Foire Saint-Ovide settled in 1764 on the Place until 1771.

When France established diplomatic relations with the short-lived Republic of Texas, the Texan legation was housed at Hôtel Bataille de Francès in 1 Place Vendôme.

==The Vendôme Column==
===Creation===
The original column was started in 1806 at Napoleon&#x27;s direction and completed in 1810. It was modelled after Trajan&#x27;s Column, to celebrate the victory of Austerlitz; its veneer of 425 spiralling bas-relief bronze plates was made out of cannon taken from the combined armies of Europe, according to his propaganda. (The usual figure given is hugely exaggerated: 180 cannon were actually captured at Austerlitz.) These plates were designed by the sculptor Pierre-Nolasque Bergeret and executed by a team of about 30 sculptors including Jean-Joseph Foucou, Louis-Simon Boizot, François Joseph Bosio, Lorenzo Bartolini, Claude Ramey, François Rude, Corbet, Clodion, Julie Charpentier, and Henri-Joseph Ruxthiel. A statue of Napoleon by Antoine-Denis Chaudet was placed on top of the column. Napoleon is depicted dressed in Roman attire, bare-headed, crowned with laurels, holding a sword in his right hand and a globe surmounted with a statue of Victory (as in &quot;Napoleon as Mars the Peacemaker&quot;) in his left hand.

In 1816, taking advantage of the Allied occupying force, a mob of men and horses had attached a cable to the neck of the statue of Napoleon atop the column, but it had refused to budge – one woman quipped: &quot;If the Emperor is as solid on his throne as this statue is on its column, he&#x27;s nowhere near descending the throne&quot;. After the Bourbon Restoration the statue, though not the column, was pulled down and melted down to provide the bronze for the recast equestrian statue of Henry IV on the Pont Neuf (as was bronze from sculptures on the Column of the Grande Armée at Boulogne-sur-Mer), though the statuette of Victory is still to be seen in the salon Napoléon of the Hôtel des Monnaies (which also contains a model of the column and a likeness of Napoleon&#x27;s face copied from his death mask). A replacement statue of Napoléon in modern dress (a bicorn hat, boots and a redingote), however, was erected by Louis-Philippe, and a better, more augustly classicizing one by Louis-Napoléon (later Napoléon III).

===Demolition during the Paris Commune===
Karl Marx predicted the collapse of the Vendôme Column in his 1852 political pamphlet Le 18 Brumaire de Louis Bonaparte. This pamphlet, sharply critical of the political figure of Napoleon III, ends with the words: &quot;But if the Imperial mantle finally falls on the shoulders of Louis Bonaparte, the bronze statue of Napoleon will fall from the height of the Vendôme Column&quot;.

During the events in the run-up to the founding of the Commune, 22 March 1871 saw disturbances outside the National Guard when demonstrators holding banners declaring them to be &quot;Friends of Peace&quot; were blocked from entering the Place Vendôme by guardsmen who, after being fired on, opened fire on the crowd. At least 12 people were killed and many wounded.

During the Paris Commune in 1871, the painter Gustave Courbet, president of the Federation of Artists and elected member of the Commune, who had previously expressed his dismay that this monument to war was located on the Rue de la Paix, proposed that the column be disassembled and preserved at the Hôtel des Invalides. Courbet argued that:

His project as proposed was not adopted, though on 12 April 1871 legislation was passed authorizing the dismantling of the imperial symbol. When the column was taken down on 16 May its bronze plates were preserved. After employing a series of ropes and quarry workers, observers saw that the statue...

Immediately following the destruction of the column and in repudiation of its perceived glorification of national chauvinism and bellicosity, the Place Vendôme was renamed the Place Internationale in celebration of the Communards&#x27; promotion of international fraternity.

===After the Paris Commune===

After the suppression of the Paris Commune by Adolphe Thiers, the decision was made to rebuild the column with the statue of Napoléon restored at its apex. For his role in the Commune, Courbet was condemned to pay the costs of rebuilding the monument, estimated at 323,000 francs, in yearly installments of 10,000 francs. Unable to pay, Courbet went into self-imposed exile in Switzerland, the French government seized and sold the artist&#x27;s paintings for a minor amount, and Courbet died in exile in December 1877. In 1874 meanwhile, the column was re-erected at the center of the Place Vendôme with a copy of the original statue on top. An inner staircase leading to the top is no longer open to the public.

==Features==
At the centre of the square&#x27;s long sides, Hardouin-Mansart&#x27;s range of Corinthian pilasters breaks forward under a pediment, to create palace-like fronts. The arcading of the formally rusticated ground floors does not provide an arcaded passageway as at the Place des Vosges. The architectural linking of the windows from one floor to the next, and the increasing arch of their windowheads, provide an upward spring to the horizontals formed by ranks of windows. Originally the square was accessible by a single street and preserved an aristocratic quiet, except when the annual fair was held there. Then Napoléon opened the Rue de la Paix, and the 19th century filled the Place Vendôme with traffic. It was only after the opening in 1875 of the Palais Garnier on the other side of the Rue de la Paix that the centre of the Parisian fashionable life started gravitating around the Rue de la Paix and the Place Vendôme.

== &quot;Hôtels particuliers&quot; ==
Hôtels particuliers on the Place Vendôme:

==In popular culture==
The Place Vendôme has been renowned for its fashionable and deluxe hotels such as the Ritz. Many famous dress designers have had their salons in the square. The only two remaining are the shirtmaker Charvet, at number 28, whose store has been on the Place Vendôme since 1877, and the couturier Chéruit, at number 21, reestablished in 2008. Since 1718, the Ministry of Justice, also known as the &quot;Chancellerie&quot;, is located at the Hotel de Bourvallais located at numbers 11 and 13.

<text>Roland Duchâtelet (; born 14 November 1946) is a Belgian businessman and politician. He is the owner of football club Újpest. He is the founder of the social-liberal political party Vivant in Belgium.

== Business ==

In 1990, he became involved in micro-electronics. He founded several multinational corporations, of which semi-conductor producer is the best known. Other corporations include X-Fab, which also produces semi-conductors, Epiq, which produces electronic systems, the online-television channel TVLokaal.com, and the holding company Elex. Through his businesses, Duchâtelet became a multimillionaire.

Duchâtelet used to own a group of football clubs, but remains as the main shareholder of only one presently: Carl Zeiss Jena (Germany, D4). He previously owned Standard Liège which he sold in early 2015, Sint-Truidense, which he sold in 2017, Alcorcón, which he sold in 2019, Charlton Athletic, which he sold in 2020, and Újpest, sold in 2024. He retained ownership of Charlton Athletic&#x27;s stadium, The Valley, and training ground.

In March 2016, Duchâtelet made headlines after a statement appeared on the Charlton Athletic website in which some of the club&#x27;s fans were accused of wanting the club to fail. In the aftermath of this statement, Charlton&#x27;s newly appointed head of communications resigned from her position. The Championship side was then relegated to League One on 19 April 2016. His ownership was met with widespread protests from Charlton supporters, who formed the Coalition Against Roland Duchâtelet (CARD) and Women Against the Regime (WAR). Similar protests from supporters of Standard Liège resulted in Duchâtelet selling the Belgian side.

==Politics==

In 1993, Duchâtelet wrote a book &quot;NV België, verslag aan de aandeelhouders&quot; (&quot;Joint stock company Belgium, a report to the shareholders&quot;), published in early 1994. In his book, he pleaded for economic and political transparency. He emphasized the necessity of sustainable development in a globalized world economy. He also proposed to lower Belgium&#x27;s public expenditure by 30%. A new political party (&quot;Beter Alternatieven Nastreven Als Apathisch Nietsdoen&quot;, or &quot;Better seeking for alternatives than doing nothing in apathy&quot;) used this book as its political program. This party was committed to a basic income and a green tax shift. After the 1995 elections, in which BANAAN obtained 1% of the votes, Duchâtelet founded the Vivant party/political movement which then entered in federal, regional and communal elections. In 1999, Vivant obtained 2,1% of the national votes. Duchâtelet is party chair and has been a candidate in several elections.

In the movie &quot;La vie politique des Belges&quot; (2002) by Jan Bucquoy, Duchâtelet is depicted in Vivant&#x27;s 1999 election campaign.

In 2004, Vivant entered a political alliance with the Flemish Liberals and Democrats (VLD) and Duchâtelet published his second book &quot;De weg naar meer netto binnenlands geluk&quot; (&quot;The road to more net domestic happiness&quot;).

In 2007, his party merged with the VLD, which entered in the next elections as &quot;Open VLD&quot;. He was elected as a member of the Belgian Senate in 2007.

<text>Sololá is a city in Guatemala. It is the capital of the department of Sololá and the administrative seat of Sololá municipality. It is located close to Lake Atitlan.

The name is a Hispanicized form of its pre-Columbian name, one spelling variant of which is Tz&#x27;olojya. The urban center has about 14,000 people, but the municipality also includes four village communities — Los Encuentros, El Tablón, San Jorge la Laguna, and Argueta — as well as 59 smaller rural communities.

Sololá is situated at 2,114 m altitude on a mountainside overlooking Lake Atitlán, some 600 meters below. It is a highland market center and is the headquarters for the Catholic Bishopric encompassing the Sololá and Chimaltenango Departments.

Almost all residents of Sololá are Kaqchikel Maya, except in Argueta, where most are K&#x27;iche&#x27; Maya. A large percentage of both men and women continue to wear traditional Mayan clothing.

Sololá is home to many international organizations including Manna Project International, Friendship Bridge, Mayan Families and Love Futbol.

== Climate ==
The climate is a subtropical highland (Köppen: &quot;Cwb&quot;), very similar to that of the Asian monsoons with months almost without any rain. Most of the precipitation is in the summer and early fall. Temperatures during the year have low fluctuation, with a relatively cold low average in winter (7.4 °C in January) and summers are cool with April the hottest month having a high of 23.2 °C.

<doc id="733497" wikidata="Q421937" url="?curid=733497" title="Hydroxyzine">
<text>Hydroxyzine, sold under the brand names Atarax and Vistaril among others, is an antihistamine medication. It is used in the treatment of itchiness, anxiety, insomnia, and nausea (including that due to motion sickness). It is used either by mouth or injection into a muscle.
Hydroxyzine works by blocking the effects of histamine. It is a first-generation antihistamine in the piperazine family of chemicals. Common side effects include sleepiness, headache, and dry mouth. Serious side effects may include QT prolongation. It is unclear if use during pregnancy or breastfeeding is safe.
It was first made by Union Chimique Belge in 1956 and was approved for sale by Pfizer in the United States later that year. In 2022, it was the 46th most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 13million prescriptions.

==Medical uses==
Hydroxyzine is used in the treatment of itchiness, anxiety, and nausea due to motion sickness.

A systematic review concluded that hydroxyzine outperforms placebo in treating generalized anxiety disorder. Insufficient data were available to compare the drug with benzodiazepines and buspirone.

Hydroxyzine can also be used for the treatment of allergic conditions, such as chronic urticaria, atopic or contact dermatoses, and histamine-mediated pruritus. These have also been confirmed in both recent and past studies to have no adverse effects on the liver, blood, nervous system, or urinary tract.

Use of hydroxyzine for premedication as a sedative has no effects on tropane alkaloids, such as atropine, but may, following general anesthesia, potentiate meperidine and barbiturates, and use in pre-anesthetic adjunctive therapy should be modified depending upon the state of the individual.

Doses of hydroxyzine hydrochloride used for sleep range from 25 to 100 mg. As with other antihistamine sleep aids, hydroxyzine is usually only prescribed for short term or &quot;as-needed&quot; use since tolerance to the central nervous system (CNS) effects of hydroxyzine can develop in as little as a few days. A major systematic review and network meta-analysis of medications for the treatment of insomnia published in 2022 found little evidence to inform the use of hydroxyzine for insomnia. A 2023 meta-review concludes that hydroxyzine is effective for inducing sleep onset but less effective for maintaining sleep for eight hours.

==Contraindications==
Hydroxyzine is contraindicated for subcutaneous or intra-articular administration.

The administration of hydroxyzine in large amounts by ingestion or intramuscular administration during the onset of pregnancy can cause fetal abnormalities. When administered to pregnant rats, mice, and rabbits, hydroxyzine caused abnormalities such as hypogonadism with doses significantly above that of the human therapeutic range.

In humans, a significant dose has not yet been established in studies, and, by default, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has introduced contraindication guidelines regarding hydroxyzine. Use by those at risk for or showing previous signs of hypersensitivity is also contraindicated.

Other contraindications include the administration of hydroxyzine alongside depressants and other compounds that affect the central nervous system; if necessary, it should only be administered concomitantly in small doses. If administered in small doses with other substances, as mentioned, then patients should refrain from using dangerous machinery, motor vehicles, or any other practice requiring absolute concentration, under safety laws.

Studies have also been conducted which show that long-term prescription of hydroxyzine can lead to tardive dyskinesia after years of use, but effects related to dyskinesia have also anecdotally been reported after periods of 7.5 months, such as continual head rolling, lip licking, and other forms of athetoid movement. In certain cases, elderly patients&#x27; previous interactions with phenothiazine derivatives or pre-existing neuroleptic treatment may have contributed to dyskinesia at the administration of hydroxyzine due to hypersensitivity caused by prolonged treatment, and therefore some contraindication is given for short-term administration of hydroxyzine to those with previous phenothiazine use.

==Side effects==
Several reactions have been noted in manufacturer guidelines—deep sleep, incoordination, sedation, and dizziness have been reported in children and adults, as well as others such as hypotension, tinnitus, and headaches. Gastrointestinal effects have also been observed, as well as less serious effects such as dryness of the mouth and constipation caused by the mild antimuscarinic properties of hydroxyzine.

Central nervous system effects such as hallucinations or confusion have been observed in rare cases, attributed mostly to overdosage. Such properties have been attributed to hydroxyzine in several cases, particularly in patients treated for neuropsychological disorders, as well as in cases where overdoses have been observed. While there are reports of hallucinogenic effects from use of hydroxyzine, several clinical data trials have not reported such side effects from the sole consumption of hydroxyzine, but rather, have described its overall calming effect described through the stimulation of areas within the reticular formation. The hallucinogenic or hypnotic properties have been described as being an additional effect from overall central nervous system suppression by other CNS agents, such as lithium or ethanol.

Hydroxyzine exhibits anxiolytic and sedative properties in many psychiatric patients. One study showed that patients reported very high levels of subjective sedation when first taking the drug, but that levels of reported sedation decreased markedly over 5–7 days, likely due to CNS receptor desensitization. Other studies have suggested that hydroxyzine acts as an acute hypnotic, reducing sleep onset latency and increasing sleep duration—also showing that some drowsiness did occur. This was observed more in female patients, who also had greater hypnotic responses. The use of sedating drugs alongside hydroxyzine can cause oversedation and confusion if administered at high doses—any form of hydroxyzine treatment alongside sedatives should be done under the supervision of a doctor.

Because of the potential for more severe side effects, this drug is on the list to avoid in the elderly.

==Pharmacology==

===Pharmacodynamics===
Hydroxyzine&#x27;s predominant mechanism of action is as a potent and selective histamine H1 receptor inverse agonist. This action is responsible for its antihistamine and sedative effects. Unlike many other first-generation antihistamines, hydroxyzine has a lower affinity for the muscarinic acetylcholine receptors, and in accordance, has a lower risk of anticholinergic side effects. In addition to its antihistamine activity, hydroxyzine has also been shown to act more weakly as an antagonist of the serotonin 5-HT2A receptor, the dopamine D2 receptor, and the α1-adrenergic receptor. Similarly to the atypical antipsychotics, the comparably weak antiserotonergic effects of hydroxyzine likely underlie its usefulness as an anxiolytic. Other antihistamines without such properties have not been found to be effective in the treatment of anxiety.

Hydroxyzine crosses the blood–brain barrier easily and exerts effects in the central nervous system. A positron emission tomography (PET) study found that brain occupancy of the H1 receptor was 67.6% for a single 30 mg dose of hydroxyzine. In addition, subjective sleepiness correlated well with the brain H1 receptor occupancy. PET studies with antihistamines have found that brain H1 receptor occupancy of more than 50% is associated with a high prevalence of somnolence and cognitive decline, whereas brain H1 receptor occupancy of less than 20% is considered to be non-sedative.

Hydroxyzine also acts as a functional inhibitor of acid sphingomyelinase.

===Pharmacokinetics===
Hydroxyzine can be administered orally or via intramuscular injection. When given orally, hydroxyzine is rapidly absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract. Hydroxyzine is rapidly absorbed and distributed with oral and intramuscular administration, and is metabolized in the liver; the main metabolite (45%), cetirizine, is formed through oxidation of the alcohol moiety to a carboxylic acid by alcohol dehydrogenase, and overall effects are observed within one hour of administration. Higher concentrations are found in the skin than in the plasma. Cetirizine, although less sedating, is non-dialyzable and possesses similar antihistamine properties. The other metabolites identified include a &quot;N&quot;-dealkylated metabolite, and an &quot;O&quot;-dealkylated 1/16 metabolite with a plasma half-life of 59 hours. These pathways are mediated principally by CYP3A4 and CYP3A5. The N-dealykylated metabolite, norchlorcyclizine, bears some structural similarities to trazodone, but it has not been established whether it is pharmacologically active. In animals, hydroxyzine and its metabolites are excreted in feces primarily through biliary elimination. In rats, less than 2% of the drug is excreted unchanged.

The time to reach maximum concentration (Tmax) of hydroxyzine is about 2.0 hours in both adults and children and its elimination half-life is around 20.0 hours in adults (mean age 29.3 years) and 7.1 hours in children. Its elimination half-life is shorter in children compared to adults. In another study, the elimination half-life of hydroxyzine in elderly adults was 29.3 hours. One study found that the elimination half-life of hydroxyzine in adults was as short as 3 hours, but this may have just been due to methodological limitations. Although hydroxyzine has a long elimination half-life and acts, in-vivo, as an antihistamine for as long as 24 hours, the predominant CNS effects of hydroxyzine and other antihistamines with long half-lives seem to diminish after 8 hours.

Administration in geriatrics differs from the administration of hydroxyzine in younger patients; according to the FDA, there have not been significant studies made (2004), which include population groups over 65, which provide a distinction between elderly aged patients and other younger groups. Hydroxyzine should be administered carefully in the elderly with consideration given to possible reduced elimination.

==Chemistry==
Hydroxyzine is a member of the diphenylmethylpiperazine class of antihistamines.

Hydroxyzine is supplied mainly as a dihydrochloride salt (hydroxyzine hydrochloride) but also to a lesser extent as an embonate salt (hydroxyzine pamoate). The molecular weights of hydroxyzine, hydroxyzine dihydrochloride, and hydroxyzine pamoate are 374.9 g/mol, 447.8 g/mol, and 763.3 g/mol, respectively. Due to their differences in molecular weight, 1 mg hydroxyzine dihydrochloride is equivalent to about 1.7 mg hydroxyzine pamoate.

===Analogues===

Analogues of hydroxyzine include buclizine, cetirizine, cinnarizine, cyclizine, etodroxizine, meclizine, and pipoxizine among others.

==Society and culture==

===Brand names===

Hydroxyzine preparations require a doctor&#x27;s prescription. The drug is available in two formulations, the pamoate and the dihydrochloride or hydrochloride salts. Vistaril, Equipose, Masmoran, and Paxistil are preparations of the pamoate salt, while Atarax, Alamon, Aterax, Durrax, Tran-Q, Orgatrax, Quiess, and Tranquizine are of the hydrochloride salt.

<text>Jacek Jan Kuroń (; 3 March 1934 – 17 June 2004) was one of the democratic leaders of opposition in the People&#x27;s Republic of Poland. He was widely known as the &quot;godfather of the Polish opposition,&quot; not unlike Václav Havel in Czechoslovakia. Kuroń was a prominent Polish social and political figure known for his efforts at reforming societies under the control of the Soviet Union. As an educator and historian, he first postulated the concept of a de-centered movement that would question the totalitarian system and its personality cult. Kuroń started out as an activist of the Polish Scouting Association trying to educate young people that would take charge of the future; he later co-founded with Antoni Macierewicz the Workers&#x27; Defence Committee or KOR, a major dissident organization that was superseded by Solidarity in August 1980. After the changes in independent Poland, he ran for president supported by the likes of Jan Karski and served twice as Minister of Labour and Social Policy. Kuroń was the father of chef Maciej Kuroń.

==Biography==
Kuroń was born in 1934, in Lwów (now Lviv, Ukraine), into a family that supported the Polish Socialist Party (PPS). In 1949, he became a member of the Communist Association of the Polish Youth (ZMP). From 1952, he worked as a full-time employee in the capital scout section affiliated with the Association of the Polish Youth. The same year, he joined the Polish United Workers&#x27; Party (PZPR). Then, he engaged in social movements making attempts to introduce more rights for the workers. After the political transformation and introduction of democracy to Poland, Kuroń became a Minister of Labor and Social Policy. 

Kuroń died on 17 June 2004. A heavy drinker and smoker, he suffered from numerous health issues, including a stroke in 1998, throat cancer, atrial fibrillation and kidney failure. 

His funeral was held on 26 June 2004. He was buried in the Avenue of the Meritious in the Powązki Cemetery in Warsaw. The ceremony was attended by close friends, supporters, Polish youth and children. Although Kuroń was an atheist, representatives of all major religious communities came to display their respect to the renowned humanitarian.

==Early social and political activities==
In 1955 the Crooked Circle Club was established. Jacek Kuroń and Karol Modzelewski were among the most prominent members of the club. 
In 1957 Kuroń graduated from the Faculty of History at the University of Warsaw. In 1964, together with Karol Modzelewski, he wrote the &quot;Open Letter to the Party&quot;. In this letter he criticized a new ruling and bureaucratic class. He suggested replacing the existing system with workers&#x27; democracy, including organizing a referendum according to which major decisions concerning a distribution of national income would be made. The immediate aim was to have a consent of all workers to make decisions on economic plans. Kuroń&#x27;s critique was closely related to the ideas of Marxism and Trotskyism. In 1965, he was sentenced to three years in prison for writing &quot;The Open Letter to the Party&quot;. Kuroń defiantly sang &quot;The Internationale&quot; in court. Imprisoned in Wronki Prison, he was released in 1967, and soon arrested again. In 1968 Kuroń was sentenced to three and a half years in prison for organizing student strikes during March Events. In 1975, he helped to organize a protest against the passage of amendments to the Constitution of the People&#x27;s Republic of Poland. Following a government crackdown on strikes, and the jailing of striking workers, in June 1976, Kuroń co-founded with Antoni Macierewicz KOR, a worker&#x27;s defense committee and civil organization that helped pave the way for Solidarność (). The Coastal Free Trade Union WZZ, the cradle of Solidarity, was established on April 29, 1978 after Krzysztof Wyszkowski convinced Kuroń that workers needed their own voice.

During the strikes of July and August 1980, Kuroń organized an information network for workers across the country. Soon after the Gdansk shipyard occupation began in August 1980, Kuroń was imprisoned again, but released with other dissidents, including Adam Michnik, before the signing of the Gdansk agreement of 31 August 1980, conceding the right to form independent unions. In September 1980, he became an adviser for the Founding Committee of the &quot;Solidarność&quot;. By this time he had changed from the ideas in &quot;An Open Letter to the Party&quot; of revolution and worker&#x27;s organization taking over society to one of &#x27;self limiting revolution.&#x27; On 13 December 1981 the Martial Law was introduced in Poland, and his activities were curtailed. In 1982, accused of attempts to destroy the political system, Kuroń was arrested. Two years later he was pardoned and released from prison.

As a member of the opposition Kuroń used pseudonyms – Maciej Gajka and Elżbieta Grażyna Borucka, or EGB.

==Transformation and politics in the 1990s==
By 1988 the authorities began serious talks with the opposition. Polish Round Table Talks took place in Warsaw, Poland from 6 February to 4 April 1989. The opposition representation included Jacek Kuroń. The election of 4 June 1989 brought a landslide victory to Solidarność: 99% of the seats in the Senate and allowable maximum number of seats in Sejm (35% of the total). The 65-35 division was soon abolished as well, which allowed the first truly free Sejm elections.
In 1989-1990 and 1992-1993 Kuroń was a Minister of Labor and Social Policy. From 1989 to 2001 he was a member of the Polish Parliament. He belonged to the following parties: Citizen Parliamentary Club (OKP), Union of Democracy (UD), Union of Freedom (UW). In the 1995 elections Kuroń ran for the office of president of the Republic of Poland. With support of 9.2%, Kuroń came third.

==Awards==
Kuroń&#x27;s work was recognized not only in Poland but also in a number of other European countries. In 1998 he was awarded a Polish Order of the White Eagle, French Legion of Honour, German Federal Cross of Merit, Ukrainian Order of Yaroslav the Wise, Lithuanian Order of the Lithuanian Grand Duke Gediminas. On 4 April, 2001 Kuroń became the 645th Knight of the Order of the Smile. This award is given to honorable adults who made a considerable contribution to children&#x27;s happiness and wellbeing. The same award was given to the 14th Dalai Lama, a friend of Jacek Kuroń.

==Social engagement==

In 2000, Kuroń and his wife, Danuta, founded the Jan Józef Lipski Common University in Teremiski. He subsequently became the first dean of the informal university.

In the last years of his life Kuroń became very critical about the social and economical results of the 1989 transformation. Among other books and press articles, two of his papers are worthy of attention: &quot;Action&quot; and &quot;Republic for my Grandchildren&quot;. In the latter, Kuroń highly criticized neoliberalism, which deepens social divisions and alienation of the political class. 

Kuroń opted for social movements and education. His last public speech in April 2004 was addressed to alterglobalists, who were protesting against the World Economic Forum held in Warsaw. He said, &quot;It is you, my Dear Friends, who have to perform the actions which contemporary political elites cannot perform: who have to create new concepts of social cooperation, implement ideals of freedom, equality, and social justice.&quot;

==Anecdotes==
The Polish unemployment benefit is colloquially referred to by Poles as the &quot;kuroniówka&quot; (literally &quot;Kuroń&#x27;s soup&quot;) in tribute to Jacek Kuroń&#x27;s legacy as Minister for Social Policy.

Jacek Kuroń was a proud owner of a yellow thermos bottle. Many people speculated about its content. Some claimed it contained whisky. They reached this conclusion, because Kuroń, unlike other politicians, used to be very straightforward and sincere. The riddle of the yellow thermos was uncovered in the book &quot;Urban Legends&quot; by Mark Barber and Wojciech Orliński. Orliński happened to have an opportunity to taste the content of the thermos. To his great surprise, the liquid to which Kuroń was addicted was not an alcoholic beverage, but an extremely strong tea. The yellow thermos accompanied Kuroń on his last journey.

<text>Hou Yuon (, 1930 – August 1975 (or later) was a veteran of the communist movement in Cambodia. A member of the Communist Party of Kampuchea, also known as the Khmer Rouge, he served in several ministerial posts during the 1960s (as a member of the non-communist government of Prince Norodom Sihanouk) and 1970s.

Yuon, who repeatedly clashed with other members of the Khmer Rouge leadership on policy issues, disappeared after 1975. Reports vary concerning the circumstances of his death.

==Early career==

Hou Yuon was born in Kampong Cham in 1930 to a family of Sino-Khmer descent. In common with several other future members of the Khmer Rouge, he studied at the &quot;Lycee Sisowath&quot;, though unlike the majority of his colleagues at that school, he was from a poor background: his father was a peasant who grew rice and tobacco.

He went on to study economics and law, earning a doctorate from the University of Paris. The doctoral dissertation he wrote expressed basic themes that were later to become the cornerstones of economic policies adopted by Democratic Kampuchea. The central role of the peasants in national development was espoused in his 1955 thesis, &quot;The Cambodian Peasants and Their Prospects for Modernization&quot; (), which challenged the conventional view that urbanization and industrialization are necessary precursors of development.

Yuon, who enjoyed great personal popularity - he was described as having &quot;truly astounding physical and intellectual strength&quot; - became an important figure in the community of radical Cambodian expatriates in Paris. He was a unanimous choice as head of the Khmer Students&#x27; Association (KSA). In 1952, along with Saloth Sar, Ieng Sary, and other leftists, Yuon gained notoriety by sending an open letter to the then-King Norodom Sihanouk calling him the &quot;strangler of infant democracy.&quot; After the French authorities closed down the KSA, Yuon and Khieu Samphan helped to establish a new group, the Khmer Students&#x27; Union, in 1956.

After returning to Cambodia, Hou Yuon became a teacher of French at a new private high school, the &quot;Lycée Kambuboth&quot;, which he helped establish.

==In Cambodian domestic politics 1958-67==

Sihanouk, by now Prime Minister of an independent Cambodia, invited a number of prominent leftists, including Hou Yuon, into his Sangkum party and government to provide a balance to the right-wing. Yuon was to serve in several ministries between 1958 and 1963. He was eventually forced to resign after losing a vote of no-confidence in the National Assembly; he was considered to have committed lèse majesté by not following Sihanouk&#x27;s demands closely enough. However, despite his open public disagreements with Sihanouk - he once accused Sihanouk of using scarce electric power to light his own street, and was the target of Sihanouk&#x27;s most furious personal tirades - he approved of the Sangkum policies of nationalisation implemented after 1964.

In 1964, Yuon was also to publish a revision of his 1956 book &quot;The Co-Operative Question&quot;, which now formally proposed an alliance between socialists and Sihanouk&#x27;s regime. It contained an in-depth study of how co-operative organisation might help poorer farmers and peasants, particularly in avoiding the need to use unscrupulous money-lenders, and redress the urban &quot;oppression&quot; of rural areas: though contrary to the line later adopted by the Khmer Rouge, Yuon identified that city workers or landowning peasants did not themselves oppress the poor peasantry.

In the 1966 National Assembly elections, Sihanouk abandoned his previous policy of nominating one candidate for each electoral district. Most leftist Sangkum deputies now had to compete with members of the traditional elite: only Hou Yuon, Hu Nim and Khieu Samphan chose to stand, their task made harder by Sihanouk actively campaigning against them: nevertheless, Yuon won by a large margin in his constituency, receiving 78% of the vote. Later that year he was briefly made part of a &quot;counter-government&quot; set up by Sihanouk to balance the right-wing cabinet of Prime Minister Lon Nol. However, after the Samlaut Uprising of 1967, Yuon was accused by Sihanouk of stirring up unrest, and threatened with arrest and possible execution: he fled to join the communist &quot;maquis&quot;, led by Saloth Sar (Pol Pot), Ieng Sary and Son Sen, in the forests.

==In the GRUNK==

After the Cambodian coup of 1970 in which Sihanouk was ousted by Lon Nol, Yuon became a part of the GRUNK, the Beijing-based government-in-exile that was formed as a coalition between Sihanouk and the communists. Yuon was made Minister for Cooperatives, and caused serious rifts between himself and other members of the Khmer Rouge leadership by protesting at the speed with which collectivisation was being carried out in the &#x27;liberated&#x27; areas. As early as 1970, he had publicly criticised Pol Pot, complaining that the Party was using his name as a &quot;screen&quot; by making him a &quot;puppet minister&quot;. He also argued against the abolition of markets, allegedly warning Pol Pot and Nuon Chea &quot;If you go on like this, I give your regime three years. Then it will collapse&quot;.

Yuon&#x27;s outspoken criticisms of Khmer Rouge policy led to him spending a brief period in a &#x27;re-education&#x27; camp, K6, in 1974. However his personal friendship with Pol Pot and his general popularity, both with the peasantry and with expatriate Cambodian intellectuals, led to a period of reinstatement in the Party leadership during 1975.

==Death==

Yuon&#x27;s death is thought to have been ordered by his fellow-members of the Khmer Rouge sometime after they seized power in 1975. His previous tendency to openly criticise the regime&#x27;s excesses appears to have continued unabated: when entering Phnom Penh, which had been divided into several sectors each run by the administration of a different zone of the country, he is reported to have remarked &quot;It&#x27;s Berlin!&quot;. Several accounts exist of his death, the most common of which is related to the controversial order to evacuate Phnom Penh given after the communist victory, which Yuon is known to have opposed. In one version, related by a CPK cadre from Kampong Cham, Yuon was said to have been shot in August 1975 by a group of Khmer Rouge soldiers after he sympathetically addressed a group of evacuees at Prek Por, Srey Santhor District, and his body thrown into the Mekong.

Other witnesses claim that Yuon was seen at a camp in Stung Treng late in 1976, and most probably either died of disease, or committed suicide, while being held in the camp system. Another Khmer Rouge source claimed that Yuon was mistakenly shot by a bodyguard after being recalled to Phnom Penh.

It has been noted that in Khmer Rouge discourse after 1978, Yuon was referred to in terms indicating that he had been posthumously rehabilitated.

<text>The Austrian State Treaty ( ) or Austrian Independence Treaty established Austria as a sovereign state. It was signed on 15 May 1955 in Vienna, at the Schloss Belvedere among the Allied occupying powers (France, the United Kingdom, the United States, and the Soviet Union) and the Austrian government. The neighbouring Federal People&#x27;s Republic of Yugoslavia acceded to the treaty subsequently. It officially came into force on 27 July 1955.

Its full title is &quot;Treaty for the re-establishment of an independent and democratic Austria, signed in Vienna on 15 May 1955&quot; ().

==Generalities and structure==
The treaty re-established a free, sovereign and democratic Austria. The basis for the treaty was the Moscow Declaration of 30 October 1943. The agreement and its annexes provided for Soviet oilfield concessions and property rights of oil refineries in Eastern Austria and the transfer of the assets of the Danube Shipping Company to the USSR.

===Treaty signatories===
*Allied foreign ministers:
**Vyacheslav Molotov (Soviet Union), 
**John Foster Dulles (United States), 
**Harold Macmillan (United Kingdom) 
** Antoine Pinay (France)
*High commissioners of the occupying powers: 
**Ivan I. Ilitchov (Soviet Union)
**Geoffrey Wallinger (United Kingdom)
**Llewellyn E. Thompson Jr. (United States)
**Roger Lalouette (France).
*Austrian foreign minister:
**Leopold Figl

===Nine parts of the treaty===
* Preamble
* Political and territorial provisions
* Military and air travel provisions
* Reparations
* Ownership, Law and Interests
* Economic relations
* Rules for disputes
* Economic provisions
* Final provisions

==Development==
After the &quot;Anschluss&quot; in 1938, Austria had generally been recognized as part of Nazi Germany. In 1943, however, the Allies agreed in the Declaration of Moscow that Austria would instead be regarded as the first victim of Nazi aggression—without denying Austria&#x27;s role in Nazi crimes—and treated as a liberated and independent country after the war.

In the immediate aftermath of World War II, the Allied occupation of Austria started on 27 April 1945 when Austria under Allied control claimed independence from Germany as a result of the Vienna Offensive. Austria was divided into four zones and jointly occupied by the United Kingdom, the Soviet Union, the United States, and France. Vienna was similarly subdivided, but the central district was collectively administered by the Allied Control Council.

Whereas Germany was divided into East and West Germany in 1949, Austria remained under joint occupation of the Western Allies and the Soviet Union until 1955; its status became a controversial subject in the Cold War. First attempts to negotiate a treaty were made by the first post-war government. However, they failed because the Allies wanted to see a peace treaty with Germany first. A treaty became less likely with the development of the Cold War. However, Austria successfully held its part of Carinthia against the demands of a resurgent Federal People&#x27;s Republic of Yugoslavia, even though the issue of potential reunification with South Tyrol, annexed by Italy from Austria-Hungary in 1919, was not addressed. 

The climate for negotiations improved with Joseph Stalin&#x27;s death in 1953 and the warming of relations known as the Khrushchev Thaw. Negotiations with the Soviet foreign minister, Molotov, secured the breakthrough in February 1955.

After Austrian promises of perpetual neutrality, Austria was accorded full independence on 15 May 1955, and the last occupation troops left on 25 October that year.

==Important points in the treaty==

As well as general regulations and recognition of the Austrian state, the minority rights of the Slovene and Croat minorities were also expressly detailed. Anschluss (Austria&#x27;s political union with Germany), as had happened in 1938, was forbidden (German recognition of Austria&#x27;s sovereignty and independence and renunciation by Germany of territorial claims over Austria were later covered in general terms in the 1990 Treaty on the Final Settlement with Respect to Germany about existing borders, but not specifically). Nazi and fascist organisations were prohibited.

Austrian neutrality is actually not in the original text of the treaty but was declared by parliament on 26 October 1955, after the last Allied troops were to leave Austria according to the treaty.

==Result==
As a result of the treaty the Allies left Austrian territory on 25 October 1955. 26 October came to be celebrated as a national holiday (called the Day of the Flag until 1965). It is sometimes thought to commemorate the withdrawal of Allied troops, but in fact celebrates Austria&#x27;s Declaration of Neutrality, which was passed on 26 October 1955.

<text>Mägo de Oz (Spanish for &quot;Wizard of Oz&quot;, with a metal umlaut) are a Spanish folk metal band from Begoña, Madrid formed in mid-1988 by drummer Txus di Fellatio.
The band became well known for the strong Celtic feel to their music strengthened through their consistent usage of a violinist and flautist. The name for the band was chosen, according to founding member Txus, because &quot;life is a yellow brick road, on which we walk in the company of others searching for our dreams.&quot; On the 26th of October, 2018, the band played a special concert to celebrate their 30th anniversary, playing with a symphony orchestra at the WiZink Center in Madrid.

==History==
===Early stages===
The band was founded in 1988 by the drummer Txus di Fellatio, who slowly recruited the rest of the members for the band, finalising the line-up by 1992. Originally, the band was called &quot;Transilvania&quot; (&quot;Transylvania&quot; in Spanish), named after an instrumental piece by Iron Maiden, a heavy influence on the band. In 1992, the band members were Txus (drums and backing vocals), Mohamed (violin), Charlie (lead guitar), Chema (rhythm guitar), Salva (bass), and Juanma (lead vocals, backup drums). They recorded several demos: &quot;Y qué más da&quot; (in 1989), &quot;Canción de cuna para un bohemio&quot; (1990), and &quot;Con la cabeza bien alta&quot;, in 1992. Their music had a wide range of styles and influences, but was primarily based around folk metal and Celtic music.

In 1992, the band was a finalist in the &quot;Concurso Villa de Madrid&quot;, and in 1994, the band released their debut album, produced by Txus and Alberto Plaza under the name Mago de Oz. This album found very little success and people were barely aware of the band&#x27;s existence. During this time, Mago de Oz went through a period of turbulence and substantial line-up changes, before the line-up that has persisted almost until the present time was formed in 1996. At this point, the lineup consisted of Txus (drums and backing vocals), Mohamed (violin and backing vocals), Carlitos (lead Guitar and backing vocals), Frank (rhythm Guitar, acoustic guitar, and backing vocals), Salva (bass and backing vocals), and José Andrëa (lead Vocals, keyboards).

===&quot;Jesús de Chamberí&quot; and &quot;La leyenda de La Mancha&quot;===
The same year, the band began recording their rock opera album, &quot;Jesús de Chamberí&quot;, produced by Alberto Plaza and the band themselves, which told a story of Jesus returning to the Madrid neighbourhood of Chamberí. The album was edited and released on the label Locomotive Music. Mago de Oz saw a huge surge in popularity across Spain following the release of the album, which was promoted with the &quot;Via Crucis Tour&quot;. In 1997, the band decided to re-record five songs from their debut album with the new singer. The resulting EP was officially self-titled, but it referred to by many fans as &quot;La Bruja&quot; (&quot;The Witch&quot; in Spanish), as the album cover features a witch playing a violin with a moon backdrop. The name has now become as a de facto name for the EP and even the official website now refers to the EP as &quot;La Bruja&quot;. &quot;La Bruja&quot; surpassed the success of &quot;Jesús de Chamberí&quot;, further raised Mägo de Oz&#x27;s profile, and led to more festival appearances.

Clearly fans of concept albums and rock operas, Mägo de Oz released their third album, &quot;La Leyenda de La Mancha&quot;, a modern retelling of Miguel de Cervantes&#x27; &quot;Don Quixote&quot;. Rock opera has been a feature of all of their albums from &quot;Jesús de Chamberí&quot; onwards. Mägo de Oz embarked on &quot;The Riiiichal Tour&quot;, which consisted of 115 dates, their longest to that point. To mark the success of &quot;La leyenda de La Mancha&quot;, and to mark their tenth anniversary, the band released a documentary about themselves entitled &quot;Resacosix en Hispania&quot;, in 1999, later released on DVD in 2004.
===Conceptual phase===
Towards the end of 1999 Mägo de Oz started writing and recording a double album named &quot;Finisterra&quot;, released in 2000. For this album they added Sergio &quot;Kiskilla&quot; on keyboards and accordion and Fernando on flute. This album was the most folk of their albums, while still rooted in heavy metal. The live tour supporting this album featured more elaborate stage production, with more sophisticated sets, pyrotechnics, and lights. Around this time bassist Salva left the band, to be replaced by Sergio. In 2002, the band released their first live album, &quot;Fölktergeist&quot;, a compilation of songs played at various shows on the tour.

In 2003, Mägo de Oz released &quot;Gaia&quot;, the first album in a trilogy which would be completed in 2010. The album was a concept album with two main themes: the Spanish conquest of America and the ecological damage wrought by mankind on Earth (Gaia). The CD liner notes detail the plot of the concept album. The album, with a Celtic rock sound, features flutes and violins, and met with a mixed reception. Around this time, Mägo de Oz started performing concerts in Latin America.

In 2004, Mägo de Oz returned to the studio to record &quot;Belfast&quot; named after the city in Northern Ireland and the numerous sectarian conflicts that have taken place there. Many of the songs on the album are simply re-recordings of songs on previous albums. The band recorded a metal version of &quot;La Rosa de los Vientos&quot; as well as adding some orchestral parts to certain earlier songs. They also added a third guitarist, Jorge Salán, and the bassist, Sergio, left the band.

===Change of label===
In 2005, Mägo de Oz released two albums. The first one, was a second live album called &quot;Madrid - Las Ventas&quot;, recorded in Madrid&#x27;s bullfighting arena, Las Ventas. There were some contractual complications with this album, since Locomotive Music had released the album, and Mägo de Oz had now signed with a new label, and therefore, Locomotive Music did not have the consent of the band. The second disc, &quot;Gaia II: La Voz Dormida&quot;, on the new label, Warner Dro, was the second album in the Gaia trilogy and contained the single &quot;La Posada de los Muertos&quot;. For this album, they recruited another bassist, Pedro &quot;Peri&quot;. After &quot;La Posada de los Muertos&quot; came the &quot;Hoy Toca Ser Feliz&quot; and &quot;Diabulus in Musica&quot;. &quot;Hoy Toca Ser Feliz&quot; was accompanied by a video with the members of the band dressed as the characters from &quot;The Wizard of Oz&quot;, Txus drumming in costume as Glinda the Good Witch, with giant wings. During the tour for &quot;Gaia II&quot;, Txus temporarily left the band due to extreme exhaustion and personal problems. His substitute for a month and a half period was Joaquín Arellano. On 8 September 2006, Txus returned to the drums.

On 5 December 2006, Mägo de Oz released their first greatest hits album &quot;Rock n&#x27; Oz&quot;, including a re-recording of the songs &quot;Molinos de Viento, &quot;Jesús de Chamberí&quot;, &quot;Hasta que tu Muerte nos Separe&quot;, and &quot;El Cantar de la luna Oscura&quot;. The album is a double album; the first disc contains singles and the second non-singles. A special edition of &quot;Rock n&#x27; Oz&quot;, entitled &quot;The Best Oz&quot; came in a box set with the original two discs and an extra disc of rare recordings, including old recordings of songs never before released with the first singer Juanma still in the lineup. It also contains a DVD documenting their American tour.

On 10 October 2007, the video for their single &quot;Y ahora voy a salir&quot; (&quot;And now I&#x27;m going to leave&quot;) was uploaded to the band&#x27;s website. The single was released on 16 October 2007 and was the first from their album &quot;La Ciudad de los Árboles&quot; (The city of trees), which was released on 6 November. On 10 November 2008, Jorge Salán announced on the band&#x27;s website that he was leaving the band to focus on his own music. Salán would continue recording and touring with the band on special occasions.

On April 6, 2010, the band released &quot;Gaia III: Atlantia&quot;, the final part of the Gaia trilogy. That same year they released &quot;Gaia - Epílogo&quot;, an extra album connected to the trilogy featuring songs that were not included on any of the original releases.

===Departure of José Andrea===
In late 2011, lead vocalist and keyboardist José Andrëa left Mägo de Oz, citing personal problems and differences with the band. Asked why he had left, he replied: &quot;Because I don&#x27;t feel the group as I did before. The moment the love itself shatters, it&#x27;s better to end it before living a farce. But we still are more than brothers. I guess the breaking point was noticing that I wasn&#x27;t motivated, a band like Mägo de Oz doesn&#x27;t deserve a front man that only gives a 50%. The moment of conversing with my fellow band members was somewhat tranquil, I explained how I felt we hugged it out and shed a tear or two.&quot; Fans and Spanish media speculated that Andrëa had left the band because the length of the band&#x27;s shows had exhausted his voice, which Andrea denied. After the end of the tour on 30 December, Mägo de Oz decided to take a break to look for a new vocalist, and Andrëa started work on a new project &quot;José Andrëa y Uróboros&quot;.

In 2013, Mägo de Oz released &quot;Hechizos, pócimas y brujería&quot; in double vinyl and digibook formats, featuring new vocalist Zeta. A two-disc compilation entitled &quot;Celtic Land&quot; was released on 13 November 2013 to celebrate the 25th anniversary of the creation of the group. The first disc consists of the band&#x27;s hits sung in English by renowned artists from Europe, such as Jonne Järvelä of Korpiklaani, Damnagoras of Elvenking, Eric Martin from Mr. Big, Ralf Scheepers from Primal Fear, and Paul Shortino from King Kobra. The second disc contains several of their hits with Jose Andrëa and Zeta and some remastered tracks performed by artists such as Leo Jimenez, Víctor García, and Cristian Bertonceli. The album was released internationally in countries where the band was previously unknown such as England, Italy, and Japan.

Their next album was &quot;Ilussia&quot;, released on 21 October 2014. The concept of the album revolves around a bloody circus, abandoned in a forest, that comes alive. The album features a symphony orchestra with soprano and falsetto choruses and choirs, incorporating Power Metal and Folk.

For the 15th anniversary of their album &quot;Finisterra&quot;, Mägo de Oz re-recorded the album in the band&#x27;s current style, featuring numerous collaborations. The album, &quot;Finisterra Opera Rock&quot;, was released in November 2015. New albums &quot;Ira Dei&quot; and &quot;Bandera Negra&quot; followed in 2019 and 2021. Their album &quot;Alicia en el Metalverso&quot; (2024) with new singer Rafa Blas (former winner of the Spanish version of &quot;The Voice&quot;) earned them a Latin Grammy nomination.

<text>The Panax (ginseng) genus belongs to the &quot;Araliaceae&quot; (ivy) family. &quot;Panax&quot; species are characterized by the presence of ginsenosides and gintonin. &quot;Panax&quot; is one of approximately 60 plant genera with a classical disjunct east Asian and east North American distribution. Furthermore, this disjunct distribution is asymmetric as only two of the ~18 species in genus are native to North America.

==Etymology==

The name &quot;Panax&quot;, meaning &quot;all-healing&quot; in Greek, shares the same origin as &quot;panacea&quot; and was used for this genus because Carl Linnaeus was aware of its wide use in Chinese medicine.

<doc id="733529" wikidata="Q885644" url="?curid=733529" title="Totonicapán Department">
<text>Totonicapán is one of the 22 departments of Guatemala. The capital is the city of Totonicapán.

==History==
Historical chronicler Francisco Antonio de Fuentes y Guzmán, described the municipalities of Totonicapán in his 1689 “Recordación Florida.” This record confirms the area&#x27;s pre-Columbian origins.

In July, 1820, the indigenous residents of Totonicapán revolted against the government in response to excessive tributes imposed by the Spanish King Ferdinand VII. The Totonicapán Uprising of 1820 was led by Atanasio Tzul and Lucas Aguilar. After toppling the local government, Tzul declared himself king of the breakaway province, with Aguilar as president. The mayor of neighboring Quetzaltenango, Prudencio Cózar, along with hundreds of armed men, led an invasion to put down the rebellion. The rebel government lasted about 20 days. The rebels were captured, whipped, and imprisoned.

The rebellion is widely celebrated in Guatemala as the opening volley in the independence struggle, though more recent scholarship on the rebellion has suggested that its leaders were less concerned with breaking from the Spanish Crown than they were concerned with the unfair demands of the American born Spanish elite, or &quot;criollos&quot;.

== Geography ==
Totonicapán has an area of 1,061 km2 located in the western highlands. Its territory is crossed by ramifications of the Sierra Madre, and includes mountains as Cuxniquel, Campanabaj, and Cerro de Coxóm. 
Important rivers in Totonicapaán include the Samalá, Pachac, Las Palmeras, Sajcocolaj, Patzotzil, Huacol and Pajá.

The department is widely recognized in Central America for its extensive highland oak-pine forests with also fir and cypress stands, these hold some of the largest stands of the threatened Guatemalan fir, &quot;Abies guatemalensis&quot;, known locally as the pinabete. The forests cover extensive portions of the Sierra Madre, especially in the &quot;municipios&quot; of San Francisco el Alto and Totonicapán, and are held in a variety of communal arrangements, including village, clan (&quot;parcialidad&quot;) and &quot;municipio&quot;-wide ownership.

==Demographics==
===Population===
The National Institute of Statistics of Guatemala estimated the population of Totonicapán to be 418,569 in 2018, down from 506,537 in 2013.

The male/female ratio of the department is 47.7/52.3, and as is true for Guatemala as a whole, Totonicapán has a relatively young population, with a median age of 16 (nationally it is only 17).

===Ethnicity===
Approximately 97% of the population of Totonicapán identify as indigenous (primarily Kʼicheʼ Maya), compared to only about 40% nationwide. The remaining 3% identifying as non-indigenous are primarily Ladino.

===Language===
Many of the Mayan inhabitants of Totonicapán speak Kʼicheʼ, though Spanish is also used throughout the department.

==Government==

=== Municipalities ===

# Momostenango
# San Andrés Xecul
# San Bartolo
# San Cristóbal Totonicapán
# San Francisco El Alto
# Santa Lucía La Reforma
# Santa María Chiquimula

==Economy==

As of 1850, the department produced wheat, maize, sugar, fruits, and vegetables. Livestock is raised the area.

==Transportation==
Cuatro Caminos (&quot;four roads&quot;) is a well-known intersection of roads that go to Quetzaltenango, Guatemala City, Huehuetenango and Totonicapán.

<text>The Crüxshadows is an American dark wave and synthpop band currently based in Jacksonville, Florida, United States. They made their debut with the album &quot;...Night Crawls In&quot; (1993), and have since released such albums as &quot;Telemetry of a Fallen Angel&quot; (1996), &quot;DreamCypher&quot; (2007), &quot;As the Dark Against My Halo&quot; (2012), and &quot;Astromythology&quot; (2017 &amp; 2018). The band has an international fanbase and has toured North America, Europe, and Asia.

==History==

The band was originally formed in 1992 by Rogue, Sean Flanagan and Tim Curry, in Tallahassee, Florida. Rogue served as songwriter and lead vocalist, and also played drum machines and electric violins; Flanagan also played drum machines and provided sound synthesis and computer programming; and Curry also provided computer programming, as well as equipment and guitar work. They self-released their debut album, &quot;...Night Crawls In&quot;, in 1993, initially only as a cassette.

In 1994, the Crüxshadows recorded and released a cover of T. Rex&#x27;s &quot;Ballrooms of Mars&quot; on Old School Records, and re-recorded &quot;Bloodline&quot; from their debut release.

In 1996, the band released their second album, &quot;Telemetry of a Fallen Angel&quot;. Initially it was simply a self released CD, but it was acquired and released by Nesak International/Kato Records, and later released and distributed by Dancing Ferret Discs. Years later it would be acquired by Rogue&#x27;s own label Wishfire Records.

In 1997, both Sean Flanagan and Tim Curry left the band shortly after signing a record deal with Nesak International/KATO Records. Rogue absorbed their interest in the band as well as their commitments under the new contract, and became the only member of Crüxshadows for a time. Determined not to be dragged down by the comings and goings of other members, Rogue learned to use synthesizers and computers himself to maintain Crüxshadows&#x27; musical direction.

Rogue started working on new material for the band&#x27;s third album in 1998. He recruited several new players including Chris Brantley, Kevin Page, Rachel McDonnell, and Trevor Brown. The band resumed touring nationally and finished work on their third studio album. During this period the Crüxshadows signed an ill-fated deal with New England–based Mere Mortal Records to release &quot;The Mystery of the Whisper&quot;. A few months prior to putting out the disc, Mere Mortal was forced out of business due in part to its acquisition of a debt-heavy distributor. With a new album, but no label, the Crüxshadows eventually partnered with Patrick Rodgers&#x27; startup label Dancing Ferret Discs. The Crüxshadows would spend a little more than a decade signed to Dancing Ferret.

In 1999, with their new label and a new lineup, the band released &quot;The Mystery of the Whisper&quot;, &quot;Until the Voices Fade...&quot;, and &quot;Paradox Addendum.&quot; By this time &quot;Marilyn My Bitterness&quot; and &quot;Monsters&quot; had become staples on the dance floors of a re-invigorated American Gothic-Industrial club scene. Capitalizing on the success of these songs, the band toured the United States relentlessly over the years that followed. The band&#x27;s song &quot;Eurydice&quot; occupied the top position in the category of New Wave for several months on the charts of digital music pioneer MP3.com.

In 2000, the band contributed a song titled &quot;Deception&quot; to &quot;Music from the Succubus Club&quot;, released by Dancing Ferret as an accompanying soundtrack album for the tabletop role-playing game &quot;&quot;. This song was also released in a German language version titled &quot;Täuschung&quot;. Although &quot;Deception&quot; never charted, it became one of the band&#x27;s most popular and enduring tracks.

They played their first tour of Europe in 2001 and released a tour CD for their European live shows called &quot;Intercontinental Drift&quot;, later released as &quot;Echoes and Artifacts&quot;.

In 2002, the EP &quot;Tears&quot; debuted at No. 5 in the Deutsche Alternative Charts. The full length album &quot;Wishfire&quot; also placed at No. 2 on the DAC. The Crüxshadows toured both North America and Europe in support of their new album.

&quot;Ethernaut&quot; was released in 2003 featuring another fan favorite song &quot;Winterborn&quot; which also landed at No. 2 on the Deutsch Alternative Charts in Germany. The Crüxshadows continued touring both in the U.S. and throughout Europe.

The Crüxshadows released a remix disc in 2004 based on the material on the &quot;Ethernaut&quot; CD called &quot;Fortress in Flames&quot; and followed it up with yet another tour of the United States and Europe.

In 2005, the release of &quot;Shadowbox&quot;, a live DVD/CD-EP, followed the Crüxshadows on their tour of Europe and featured their headlining performance at the Wave Gothic Treffen in Leipzig Germany.

In 2006 the single release of &quot;Sophia&quot; saw its debut land at No. 1 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot Dance Singles Sales chart and at No. 7 on the Hot 100 Singles Sales chart. This was a major breakthrough according to Rogue. Its release coincided with the band&#x27;s performance at 2006&#x27;s Dragon Con, where the Rogue gave credit to the support of their SciFi fans in attendance for helping them reach the No. 1 position, unseating the mainstream artist Beyonce from the top position. Jen Jawidzik joined the Crüxshadows, taking over keyboards. The Crüxshadows recorded the song &quot;Wake the White Queen&quot; for the Dancing Ferret-released album &quot;Where&#x27;s Neil When You Need Him?&quot;, a tribute album to author Neil Gaiman.

In 2007, the full-length concept album &quot;Dreamcypher&quot; was released. The single &quot;Birthday&quot; debuted at No. 1 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Dance Singles Sales Chart. The band spent almost the entirety of 2007 touring. Their travels took them to China where they played the MIDI Modern Music Festival, one of China&#x27;s largest Rock music events taking place in Beijing, China in May. Following a year long DreamCypher tour, Rachel McDonnell, George Bikos, and Sarah Poulos all left the group as 2007 drew to a close, and Rogue soon replaced them with guitarist Valerie Gentile, violinist JoHanna Moresco, and violinist David Russel Wood, as well as dancer Sarah Stewart (aka Sarah Kilgore).

In 2008, the EP &quot;Immortal&quot; was released in July on Rogue&#x27;s birthday, and became the band&#x27;s third consecutive single to chart on &quot;Billboard&quot;, coming in at No. 2 in the United States and landing in the top 5 in Germany.

In 2009, Valerie Gentile was briefly replaced by Cassandra Luger before guitarist Mike Perez took over guitar duties in early 2010 The Crüxshadows would continue to play to bigger audiences in Europe, but 2009 marked the last tour in the United States until several US mini-tours in 2018 and 2019. The EP &quot;Quicksilver&quot; debuted at No. 32 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; U.S. Hot 100 Singles Sales chart before eventually peaking at the No. 2 position on the &quot;Billboard&quot; singles chart, and the No. 1 position on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Dance Chart.

During 2010–2011, the Crüxshadows performed a tour of Europe, but took a year off in 2011 as frontman Rogue and his wife Jessica gave birth to their daughter, Anmi. 2011 Dragon Con was the one and only performance of the band that year. During this time the band had relocated to Jacksonville from Tallahassee, Florida, and Rogue and his crew focused on producing another new album.

The Crüxshadows returned to the road in 2012 and &quot;As the Dark Against My Halo&quot; became the first Crüxshadows disc to earn a number one position on the German Alternative Charts.

In 2013, Rogue acquired control of the Crüxshadows&#x27; artistic works and transferred them to his own label, Wishfire Records. Dancing Ferret and the Crüxshadows released a joint statement notifying the public that the long-time allies were going separate ways. The band toured Europe in support of &quot;As the Dark Against My Halo&quot;.

During 2014 to 2018, Rogue teamed up with Fansation in Germany, a label that released its acts through its partnership with Universal Music, and began working with notable German producer Henning Verlage. During this time, Rogue traveled back and forth to Germany writing, recording, and producing The Crüxshadows&#x27; new album. The band performed a very limited number of shows but played several high-profile concerts and festivals including several performances supporting notable label bandmates Unheilig as part of their farewell concerts, including two sold-out outdoor concerts in Leipzig in front of the massive Völkerschlachtdenkmal War Memorial. Their single &quot;Helios&quot; peaked on the &quot;Billboard&quot; singles chart at the No. 11 position in the U.S. and later in 2017 the single dominated the German Alternative Charts, camping out at the No. 1 position for months.

In 2017, following its lead single &quot;Helios&quot;, the Crüxshadows released a new concept album called &quot;Astromythology&quot;, which tells the story of an astronaut escaping the destruction of the solar system. Every song represents a planetary body, and the album as a whole becomes an allegory of life changing realities. The album became the Crüxshadows&#x27; most popular German release and its first two singles reached number one on the DAC as well as top 10 showings in the mainstream charts.
Despite the success of Astromythology, in the wake of declining record sales throughout the industry, the administrators of Fansation and its related companies returned the Crüxshadows rights to Rogue and parted ways.

In 2018, the Crüxshadows released &quot;Astromythology&quot; in Europe through the album&#x27;s previous distributor, Timezone Records, and in the rest of the world through their own Wishfire Records imprint. &quot;Home&quot;, a ballad about lost love, reached the No. 2 position on the German charts and features the Crüxshadows&#x27; highest-budget video to date.

On July 3, 2022, the Crüxshadows released a new single, &quot;All the White Horses (Into the Mirror Darkly)&quot; available for download through their website. In September 2022, after a three-year hiatus from performing at Dragon Con, the Crüxshadows returned to play at the 2022 Dragon Con.

==Labels==
The Crüxshadows initially self-released two albums under the imprint name Black Widow Music between 1992 and 1996. Those titles were &quot;...Night Crawls In&quot; and &quot;Telemetry of a Fallen Angel&quot;. In 1997, they signed a deal with Nesak International/Kado Records to give &quot;Telemetry of a Fallen Angel&quot; a full commercial release, as well as an option for a future album. Nesak eventually sold their rights to Dancing Ferret Discs and Mere Mortal Records. Mere Mortal Records went out of business prior to releasing any albums by the Crüxshadows. Dancing Ferret Discs released a number of the Crüxshadows titles over the following ten years. In July 2008, Dancing Ferret Discs announced that it was becoming a catalog label and while existing titles would remain in print, the label would not be releasing new albums. Rather than sign a deal with another label, The Crüxshadows started their own label in mid-2009, in cooperation with several established labels and distributors in different markets worldwide. Their new label was named Wishfire Records and their first release was &quot;Quicksilver&quot;, which hit the shelves in the USA on September 8, 2009. The song became their fourth consecutive single to reach the top 10 on the Billboard Hot Dance Singles Charts, and their third to occupy the No. 1 position.

==Touring==
From 1993 to 1997, the Crüxshadows toured the Eastern portion of the United States. From 1998 until 2008 The band played shows throughout the entirety of the United States and made several trips into Mexico and Canada. In 2001, the Crüxshadows began touring Europe on a regular basis. They also played in various festivals with bands like Bella Morte, Noctivagus, The Ghost of Lemora for example.

In 2007, they were invited to play at the Midi Music Festival in Beijing, China.

In 2009, 2010, &amp; 2015 the band performed on the Gothic Cruise.

Through much of their history, the band has toured the festival circuit in Europe. After The Immortal Tour, from 2008 to 2018, the band played only a very limited number of shows North America, however they have performed annually without fail in Atlanta at DragonCon from 1997-2019, only pausing for the Coronavirus outbreak, and played only the occasional appearance or festival in the United States otherwise, until 2018, when they began performing shows in support of their Astromythology Album.

<text>Arm &amp; Hammer is a brand of baking soda-based consumer products marketed by Church &amp; Dwight, a major American manufacturer of household products. The logo of the brand depicts the ancient symbol of a muscular arm holding a hammer inside a red circle with the brand name and slogan. Originally associated solely with baking soda and washing soda, the company began to expand the brand to other products in the 1970s by using baking soda as a deodorizing ingredient. The new products included toothpaste, laundry detergent, underarm deodorant, and cat litter.

==History==
=== Name and logo ===
The original Arm and hammer logo usage dates back to the 1860s. James A. Church, son of Dr. Austin Church, ran a spice business known as Vulcan Spice Mills. According to the company, the Arm and Hammer logo represents Vulcan, the Roman god of fire and metalworking.

It is often claimed that the brand name originated with tycoon Armand Hammer; however, the Arm &amp; Hammer brand was in use 31 years before Hammer was born. Hammer was often asked about the Church &amp; Dwight brand when he attempted to buy the company. While unsuccessful, Hammer&#x27;s Occidental Petroleum acquired enough stock for him to join the Church &amp; Dwight board of directors in 1986. Hammer remained one of the owners of Arm &amp; Hammer until his death in 1990.

=== Baking soda ===

Arm and Hammer started as John Dwight and Company in 1846 when John Dwight and Austin Church used their sodium bicarbonate in their kitchen. They formerly made the Cow Brand trademark on their baking soda. In 1886, Austin retired and his two sons succeeded in selling Arm and Hammer Baking Soda through their name &quot;Church and Co&quot; as a competing company to the John Dwight Company which continued selling Cow Brand baking soda. The Church &amp; Dwight Company was formed when the two were merged.

===Odor control===

In 1972, Arm &amp; Hammer launched an advertising campaign promoting the idea that a box of baking soda in the refrigerator could control odors. The campaign is considered a classic of marketing, leading within a year to more than half of American refrigerators containing a box of baking soda. This claim has often been repeated since then. However, there is little evidence that it is effective in this application. Arm &amp; Hammer further claims that the box must be replaced monthly.

== Armex ==
In 1986, Arm &amp; Hammer created the Armex brand, a line of soda blasting agents originally used to aid in the conservation-restoration of the Statue of Liberty.

<text>The election of MEPs representing Latvia constituency for the 2004–2009 term of the European Parliament was held on 12 June 2004. It was part of the wider 2004 European election.

There were lists of candidates from 16 political parties. with a total of 1019 candidates. The voter turnout was 41.20%, with 574,674 voters casting votes. It was significantly lower than the usual turnout for Latvian parliamentary elections (which has been between 71% and 73% for previous three elections) but higher than the turnout in most of other countries which joined EU together with Latvia in 2004.

The election was conducted according to party-list proportional representation system, with at least 5% of votes necessary to gain seats in the parliament. Out of 16 parties, five won seats in the European Parliament. Several parties narrowly missed the 5% threshold.

==Results==
The elections were a major loss for the coalition government in power, as the three coalition parties together won only 14.2% of popular vote. &quot;Tautas Partija&quot; was the only coalition party to win a seat.

The winning party &quot;Tēvzemei un Brīvībai/LNNK&quot; had most votes in 22 of 26 counties and 5 of 7 cities. The exception was Southeast Latvia (Daugavpils, Krāslava and Rezekne districts and cities of Daugavpils and Rēzekne) which were won by the &quot;Par Cilvēka Tiesībām Vienotā Latvijā&quot; party and Ludza district won by Socialist Party of Latvia, due to large percentage of ethnically Russian voters in this area.

<doc id="733544" wikidata="Q2278063" url="?curid=733544" title="Bomba (Puerto Rico)">
<text>Bomba is an umbrella term that refers to a variety of musical styles and associated dances originating in Puerto Rico. It was developed by enslaved Africans and their descendants in sugar plantations along coastal towns, most notably Loiza, Mayagüez, Ponce, and San Juan, during the 17th century. It is the island&#x27;s oldest musical tradition.

Bomba reflects a syncretism of Puerto Rico’s many cultural groups. It incorporates Taíno instruments such as the maraca; characteristics from traditional European dances like rigadoons, quadrilles and mazurkas; and drum ensembles and drummer/dancer interactions that bear close resemblance to a number of West African musical styles. The music also evolved through contact between enslaved populations from different Caribbean colonies and regions, including the Dutch colonies, Cuba, Dominican Republic, and Haiti, and it has notable roots in Congolose and Afro-French cultural expressions.

After slavery was abolished, Bomba was commercialized in the mid-20th century and incorporated into the island’s folklore. In the 90’s, the Bomba &amp; Plena group Hermanos Emmanueli Náter brought the genre to the streets for public consumption in the form of “Bombazos” that were designed for communal participation.

== History ==

Bomba was developed in Puerto Rico during the early European colonial period. The first documentation of bomba dates back to 1797: botanist André Pierre Ledru described his impressions of local inhabitants dancing and singing popular bombas in &quot;Voyage aux îles de Ténériffe, la Trinité, Saint-Thomas, Sainte-Croix et Porto Ricco&quot;.

These dances were developed by West African slaves and their descendants in sugar plantations. Cane workers used them to release feelings of sadness, anger, and resistance; they were also used to communicate and plan rebellions and integrated into baptism and marriage celebrations. The roots of the bomba tradition can be traced back to the Ashanti people of Ghana. The etymology of the word “bomba” comes from the Akan and Bantu languages in Africa.

These slaves came from different regions of Africa so they could not easily communicate with each other, but they found common ground in music. With the migration of these slaves to different regions of the island bomba was practiced in different regions of the island, each giving their personal twist to bomba music, for example in the region of Ponce they play with larger drums than other regions that are played by placing the drum completely horizontal. 

Bomba was also significantly shaped by the dissemination of Haitian culture. French, Corsican, and Spanish landowners brought slaves to Puerto Rico while fleeing the Haitian Revolution in 1791. Specifically, this influence contributed to the yubá rhythm of Bomba in Mayagüez.

=== 20th Century ===
Up until the 1940s and 1950s, bomba was heavily racialized and associated as premodern and Black. bomba had been a marginalized music genre until musical artists like Rafael Cortijo and Ismael Rivera popularized bomba by taking it to various parts of the Americas and the world. On an international level bomba was fused with various national and regional musical genres creating a hybridization of bomba. On the Island of Puerto Rico however, bomba did not unfold in the same manner, it remained true to its folk tradition and geographically confined to parts of the island where there was a majority of Black Puerto Ricans in towns such as Loíza, Ponce, Mayagüez, and Guayama.

==Characteristics of bomba==

Bomba is described as a secular, recreational style of music, characterized by a challenge/connection between the drummer and the dancer, a call and response. The dancer produces a series of gestures to which the primo o subidor drummer provides a rhythmic pattern, while the buleador (second) maintains the rhythm. Therefore, it is the drummer who attempts to follow the dancer, and not the more traditional form of the dancer following the drummer. When there is nobody dancing, the primo improvises.

Bomba also is composed by three or more singers and a solo singer. The singing has a dynamic similar to the &quot;Son&quot; where the lead singer sings a chorus and the other responds. In between choruses the lead singer will improvise a verse. Most bomba songs are sung in Spanish and deal with topics of immediate community and everyday life. In the case of a certain song called &quot;Palo e Bandera&quot;, the lyrics discuss a love triangle between a female dancer, a female singer and the singer&#x27;s husband, the &quot;primo&quot; player. The wife realizes her husband is cheating on her with the dancer and decides to teach her a lesson on the dance floor. Older bombas include words and expressions from former colonial African languages and older Caribbean dialects.

=== Regional distinctions ===
In the northern part of the island, the melody can be interpreted by both men and women. In the south, only women sing. To reinforce regional distinctions, bomba is divided into two main rhythms: sones (south) and seises (north). Sub variations are characterized by hand position on the drum and what part of the drum is played.

Bomba dancers and musicians typically appropriate small spaces in popular areas to “make culture” (“hacer cultura”). This phrase is repeated by musicians when they’re asked about their motivation to play bomba.

===Dance===

In the Batey (sugar workers&#x27; town) or a Sobera&#x27;o (circle or dance area), the Subidor will score sounds for the steps that the dancer makes, and the Buleador or Follower, follows the rhythm that is constantly played until the “Cantador/a” (singer) says so. The dancer enters the Batey to stroll around, showing off, marking their territory. The dancer greets the Primo Barrel and starts doing “Piquetes” (improvised bomba steps). 

=== Rhythmic dialogue ===
The dancer challenges the Primo Barrel Player (“Tocador/a”), engaging in a rhythmic dialogue and making it difficult to follow them. When the dancer finishes providing the “Piquetes”, they bow again to the Primo Barrel and the next dancer repeats the process. The “Piquetes” must have &quot;elegance, firmness and shape.&quot; Depending on the rhythm, the dancer then has to raise the intensity of the music by increasingly complicating their steps to gradually escalate the challenge directed to the lead drummer. Experienced dancers finish the challenge at the highest peak of intensity they can achieve before getting tired or losing rhythm.

During the dance, sometimes the audience shouts &quot;Speak!&quot; This is because the dancer is having a musical conversation with the bomba drum (Primo) through their “Piquetes” (bomba steps). In this conversation, any dance must be markable by the Primo, and anything the Primo plays must be danceable.

=== Dancer attire ===
Traditionally, “Bailadores” (male dancers) perform their “Piquetes” with their body and the “Bailadoras” (female dancers) perform with the body and / or skirt with the petticoat. The bomba traditional dress for men is white hat, white shirt and black or white pants. The women wear turbans, white shirt and skirts with petticoats. Petticoats are handmade to show them off in a flirtatious way for men and to create envy among other female dancers. The way skirts are used and held in bomba dancing is unique.

== Instruments ==
The main instruments of bomba are barriles de bombas (drums), maracas (shaken, single body gourds with handles), and cuás (solid idiophones made of bamboo). Maracas contain internal strikers rather than seeds or small stones. The güiro was, at one time, used in Loiza in place of maracas, but that is no longer common.

The traditional barriles de bombas are built from rum barrels and goatskin. Bomba ensembles must have at least two barriles of slightly different diameters. The smaller, higher, drum will typically be a solo drum, playing the subidor/primo part. The larger, lower, drum(s) will typically support the basic rhythm by playing the accompanying buleador/segundo part.

The drum called &quot;Primo&quot; replicates every single move of the dancer. This is called &quot;Repique.&quot;

== Rhythmic Styles ==
There are 10 rhythmic styles of bomba, some with their own sub-styles.

*Sicá: the most common and widespread style; based on 3-3-2 rhythm pattern found throughout Latin American music. Its sub-style, Danué, is believed to be the transliteration of the French term ‘Danois’ or Danish, possibly relating to Denmark’s control over the French Caribbean Island colony of St. Croix from 1733-1917.

*Cunyá: played in a moderately slow tempo, this rhythm’s name is similar to the name of the wooden peg used to fasten drumheads (cunya).

*Belén: this southern style is the slowest and sparsest of all bomba styles. Its name may be a transformation of the French Caribbean term “belé”.

*Calindá: The name of this style is connected to rhythmic patterns found in the Spanish, English, and French Caribbean. Its sub-style, Hoyo Mula, is associated with Santurce performer and teacher, Jesús Cepeda. Hoyo Mula was an old neighborhood east of Santurce that was later incorporated into the municipality of Carolina. This sub-style is characterized by a high/low pulsation similar to Brazilian Samba.

*Cuembé/Güembé: The most common style after Sicá. This rhythm has two sub-styles: Balancé and Gracimá. Balancé is a moderate tempo sub-style that closely resembles the cuembé, but its first low stroke is played closer to the center of the drum. Gracimá is played in a moderate to fast tempo, and its name is allegedly a colloquial derivative of the French word “gracieusment”.

*Seis Corrido: The rapid-fire style of the Loíza tradition. Corrido signifies fast-paced playing. Drummers often vary the first pattern of this style by adding subtle “ghost” notes that are played more quietly, giving the impression that the pattern has continuous sixteenth notes. Its sub-style, Bambulé, commonly spelled bamboula or bamboulaé, was found in New Orleans, Haiti, Cuba, and other Caribbean French and Spanish colonies. Bambulé was one of the main sub-styles adapted by Rafael Cortijo.

*Yubá: the most common rhythm of bomba, played at a moderately fast tempo. Its compound meter makes it more challenging for musicians and dancers. It has three main sub-styles: Yubá corrido, which is played at a faster tempo, Yubá cuembé, a variant of Yubá Corrido, and Leró del sur, a slow style common in Ponce and surrounding areas. The word ‘Leró’ in the name is believed to be a contraction of the French “le rose”, a circle dance formation. In Santurce, there is a variant known as Leró Cangrejero, referring to the town’s former name, San Mateo de Cangrejos. In Loíza, the yubá is called corvé and its played consistently at a fast tempo. Also associated with Loíza is the Roulé, a variant that gets its name from the popular song “Roulé Sondá”.

*Holandés: The name Holandés means “from Holland”, suggesting a connection to Dutch slave cultures in the southern sugar cane plantations. This sole style is characterized by syncopation and persistent off-beat accents. There is an holandés rhythm in that barely resembles the original style and is more akin to a yubá sub-style.

*Clave Tres: Devised by percussionist Raúl Berríos Sánchez, this is the most recent rhythm to be adopted into the bomba repertoire. Berríos Sánchez has adapted the main concept of this rhythm for other forms of music such as salsa and Latin jazz.

*Mariandá: A pattern associated with an inland mountain style known as “jíbaro” music. It is argued that this style is related to the seemingly distant Aguinaldo, a style of Christmas jíbaro music. 

==Performers==

Today there are many groups playing bomba both as a traditional style and as a fusion with some other style. The most well-known traditional players are the Cepeda Family who have been playing bomba for generations and the Ayala family, who are a family with a tradition of arts and crafts as well as bomba music. Rafael Cepeda, the Cepeda family’s patriarch, is known for creating an ensemble in the 1940’s to perform Bomba on the radio. He later developed a stage version of bomba and presented it in San Juan’s major hotels.

Los Pleneros de la 21 are bomba / plena musicians who travelled to Hawaii to perform for the Puerto Rican diaspora in Hawaii. Founded in South Bronx, this group of musicians and dancers have produced five albums, and they are also known to provide workshops for all ages in the community of El Barrio in Manhattan.

Willie Colón adds occasional bomba breaks to his songs, most particularly in sections of his biggest solo hit, &quot;El gran varón&quot;. Ricky Martin also mixes a bit of authentic bomba rhythm with other Latino influences in his aptly named song &quot;La Bomba&quot;. In California, it has been popularized by Maestros de Bomba en la Bahía at La Peña Cultural Center.

In 1998, &quot;Son del Batey&quot; was founded in San Juan, Puerto Rico, by a group of college students at the University of Puerto Rico in Mayagüez. 1998 marked the 100-year anniversary of the United States invasion of Puerto Rico, and a time when popular discourse focused around national identity and colonialism throughout the island.

In Puerto Rico, knowledge about bomba is present in the oral cultures of protected family spaces, mainly the Cepedas (Santurce) and the Ayalas (Loiza). These families are largely responsible for bomba’s institutional recognition on a national and international level. Other families include the Alduén (Mayagüez), Negrón and Pizarro (Cataño), Mangual and Nadal (Mayagüez), Archeval (Ponce), and Brothers Emmanuelli Náter (José, Jorge and Victor, students and friends of the Cepeda). They created the center for Cultural Research of Eternal Roots (Centro de Investigación Cultural Raíces Eternas) (CICRE in Spanish) in Puerto Rico during the 90s’ so-called &quot;Bombazos&quot;. They were devoted to “get down” the bomba from the high stage, so that the Puerto Ricans and everybody else had more participation and learning in this folklore music. Thanks to this, today there are “Bombazos” in many parts of Puerto Rico and the United States.

<doc id="733546" wikidata="Q780784" url="?curid=733546" title="Zacapa Department">
<text>Zacapa () is one of the 22 departments of Guatemala. It lies in eastern Guatemala with its capital in the city of Zacapa, approximately 112 kilometers (70 miles) from Guatemala City.

==Geography==
To the north lie the departments of Alta Verapaz and Izabal; to the east is the border with the Republic of Honduras; on the south are Chiquimula and Jalapa and to the west is El Progreso.

The northern half of the department is mountainous, crossed from west to east by the Sierra de las Minas. The southern part of the department has small chains of mountains and isolated hills that are separated by fairly deep ravines. The central part of the department is formed by the riverbed and surroundings of the Motagua River. The river forms a huge valley and depending on the topographic configuration, narrows or widens, giving rise to very fertile valleys and large plains. This is a benefit to the department and helps in the harvest of products such as sugar cane, tomatoes, good quality tobacco, and other plants.

==Etymology==
Historian and poet, Capitán Don Francisco Antonio De Fuentes y Guzmán noted that the name &quot;Zacapa&quot; derived from Nahuatl &quot;zacatl&quot; meaning grass or weed, and &quot;apan&quot; meaning in the river, a word which in turn is from &quot;atl&quot; meaning water. Zacapa means on the river of grass.

==History==
Zacapa department was created on 10 November 1871, as a much larger department. Since then, portions have become other departments, such as the creation of part of El Progreso Department from western Zacapa in 1908.

==Population==
The population for the whole department of Zacapa is 245,374 (2018 census).

==Climate==
The climate as in almost the whole region of Zacapa, excluding inhabited highlands, is semi-arid chaparral. This is due to the shadow effect the Sierra de las Minas has over the following land to the south. The average maximum average temperature oscillates between 30° and 40 °C throughout the whole year, with highs of 45 °C reached during the &quot;Semana Santa&quot; (Holy Week) and Summer (March, April, May), though there have been instances where the maximum capped at 25 °C for the day. The minimum might go from some 15 °C in cases of &quot;extreme&quot; conditions over some cold spell north winds, to 25 °C. The previous almost never happens, the latter is considered hot, and the usual hovers around 20 °C. There is a pronounced dry season, often marked by more than two months without rain, which worsens the air quality of the region tremendously. The region&#x27;s flat areas are known for their loud insects, called chicharras, which chirp in the fields and along the roads during the dry season.

==Economy==

Zacapa is mainly a rural area that contains a large amount of flat land used mostly to grow cantaloupe, tobacco and roma tomatoes. Bordering the Zacapa valley is the Sierra de las Minas, which harbors fine hardwood forests, and contains marble mines and coffee plantations. Some of the world&#x27;s finest jade is also found in this area.

<doc id="733548" wikidata="Q3825427" url="?curid=733548" title="Fire lookout">
<text>A fire lookout (sometimes also called a fire watcher) is a person assigned the duty to look for fire from atop a building known as a fire lookout tower. These towers are used in remote areas, normally on mountain tops with high elevation and a good view of the surrounding terrain, to spot smoke caused by a wildfire.

Once a possible fire is spotted, &quot;Smoke Reports&quot;, or &quot;Lookout Shots&quot; are relayed to the local Emergency Communications Center (ECC), often by radio or phone. A fire lookout can use a device known as an Osborne Fire Finder to obtain the radial in degrees off the tower, and the estimated distance from the tower to the fire.

Part of the lookout&#x27;s duties include taking weather readings and reporting the findings to the Emergency Communications Center throughout the day. Often several lookouts will overlap in coverage areas and each will “cross” the same smoke, allowing the ECC to use triangulation from the radials to achieve an accurate location of the fire.

Once ground crews and fire suppression aircraft are active in fire suppression, the lookout personnel continue to search for new smoke plumes which may indicate spotting and alterations that pose risks to ground crews.

Working in a fire lookout tower in the middle of a wilderness area takes a hardy type of person, one who can work with no supervision, and is able to survive without any other human interaction. Some towers are accessible by automobile, but others are so remote a lookout must hike in, or be lifted in by helicopter. In many locations, even modern fire lookout towers do not have electricity or running water.

Most fire lookout jobs are seasonal through the fire season. Fire lookouts can be paid staff or volunteer staff. Some volunteer organizations in the United States have started to rebuild, restore and operate aging fire lookout towers.

Although it was considered as “man’s work” in the United States, women have been doing the job almost from its beginnings.

<text>Harvey Job Matusow (October 3, 1926 – January 17, 2002) was an American communist who became an informer for the Federal Bureau of Investigation and subsequently a paid witness for a variety of anti-subversion bodies, including the House Un-American Activities Committee, before eventually recanting the bulk of his testimony. These activities led to his own perjury conviction and a prison sentence. His McCarthy era activities overshadowed his later work as an artist, actor and producer.

==Background==
Harvey Matusow was born on October 3, 1926, in the Bronx, the son of Russian immigrants.

==Career==
Matusow served in the U.S. Army during World War II. On returning to New York he worked in various creative fields, including journalism and stage and radio acting. He became a member of the Communist Party USA in 1947.

===HUAC===
In 1950, Matusow, a young and low-ranking party member employed as a clerk in the Communist Party bookstore in Manhattan, walked in to the FBI and offered his services as a paid informant. During a 1950 summer road trip to the West Coast, he made a prolonged stop at the San Cristobal Valley Ranch, a resort near Taos, New Mexico, directed by musician Jenny Vincent and her husband and favored by progressives, and filed detailed reports with the Albuquerque office of the FBI there, which paid him $75 a month; he listed the license plate numbers of cars in the resort&#x27;s parking lot and noted the comings and goings of people he recognized as party members or he alleged were members. Notable visitors to the ranch during his stay included Jessica Mitford and Virginia Durr, but he does not appear to have identified them in his reports. In December, Matusow was abruptly summoned to New York and expelled from the party; soon afterward, the FBI, deciding that he was of no further use, dropped him from the rolls of its paid informants.

Matusow, freed from FBI supervision, went, on his own initiative, to HUAC and offered to testify in upcoming trials and hearings as a paid expert witness by providing information on his former Communist Party comrades and people he claimed to have known or met in party circles. He also became an editor of the anticommunist bulletin &quot;Counterattack&quot; and worked as a campaign aide to Joseph McCarthy. While working as an informant, Matusow provided information against folksingers associated with People&#x27;s Songs, where he had briefly worked, including Pete Seeger, and later claimed to know that 126 communists worked for the Sunday &quot;New York Times&quot; even though the total number of employees was alleged to be 100. Matusow also claimed that he had known Clinton Jencks, an officer of the Mine, Mill &amp; Smelter Workers Union to be a member of the American Communist Party; that resulted in Jencks being sent to prison for perjury for having signed, as a union official, a required affidavit of nonmembership in the Communist Party under the Taft-Hartley Act.

Seeger&#x27;s band, The Weavers, went from a hit record with &quot;Wimoweh&quot; to being blacklisted and finding no work. Seeger was later sentenced to one year in prison for contempt of Congress after he was subpoenaed to appear before HUAC and refused to testify, citing the First Amendment&#x27;s guarantee of freedom of speech as his justification (the sentence was vacated on technical grounds); Seeger eventually forgave Matusow for his youthful mistakes and noted that Matusow never did more than cost Seeger a few jobs.

Harvey Matusow met fellow FBI informer, Elizabeth Bentley, on October 3, 1952, at the offices of her publisher. Matusow later claimed that he began a relationship with Bentley, and that she was self-medicating for depression and anxiety: &quot;She used alcoholism to ease her pain and she had a lot of pain.&quot; At the end of the evening, he would take her home and &quot;pour&quot; her into bed. Every couple of weeks, they would sleep together, but usually, she was too drunk. Matusow claimed that she was upset at her &quot;frivolous treatment&quot; in the press. &quot;She didn&#x27;t understand the hostility... She never got to the point where she could handle it.&quot; Bentley complained about the way she had been treated by the FBI: &quot;She felt that she&#x27;d been used and abused.&quot; Matusow also said: Contrary to what Miss Bentley thinks and says, I did have dinner with her on October 3, 1952, and she did cry in her beer and say she did not have new information. She said she did not have any new information. She is a liar, and she admitted so in substance that night. 

Bentley denied this allegation. Two men who joined Matusow and Bentley at dinner, Llewellyn Watts and Earl Henry, supported Bentley&#x27;s account: Henry told the FBI that Bentley said very little as Matusow &quot;monopolized the conversation,&quot; while Watts recalled that &quot;&#x27;Matusow was continuously interrupting to tell about his [Communist Party activities].&#x27;&quot;
===&quot;False Witness&quot;===
In 1955, he came clean with a book, &quot;False Witness&quot;, in which he disclosed that he had been an FBI informant and was paid to give information about members of the Communist Party. He also claimed in the book that McCarthy and Roy Cohn had encouraged him to lie. Because of the book, Matusow was found guilty of perjury and sentenced to five years in prison, of which he served 44 months, and was ultimately blacklisted.

===Exile===
After leaving prison Matusow sought, through a variety of artistic and cultural projects, to put the past behind him. However, having alienated people across the political spectrum (some hated him for his McCarthyite activities, some for his subsequent recantation), he found it impossible to move on. The breaking point came when, having painstakingly compiled a record of more than 200,000 works of art created under the Federal Art Project, he was told by a charitable trust that publishing funds would be made available only if he would withdraw from the project. Matusow responded by dumping all his research material in the Hudson River. Shortly afterwards, he went to live in England, where he was based from 1966 to 1973, living first in London then in the Essex village of Ingatestone.

During his time in England, he was involved with the London Film Makers Cooperative and worked with the composer Annea Lockwood, who appeared on record under the name Anna Lockwood. In 1972, he produced a festival of contemporary music called the International Carnival of Experimental Sound. The event&#x27;s highlights included performances by Charlotte Moorman (in the Roundhouse and in the Richard Demarco Gallery in Edinburgh) and John Cage&#x27;s &quot;HPSCHD&quot;, for eight harpsichords and projections of the American space program. A train was hired to take participants and public to Edinburgh, to link with the Edinburgh Festival; Charlotte Moorman performed Nam June Paik&#x27;s &quot;TV Bra&quot; in the Richard Demarco Gallery.

Matusow&#x27;s activities also included managing the experimental band Naked Software, attempting to market a toy called the Stringless Yo-yo, making records as part of Harvey Matusow&#x27;s Jews Harp Band, and broadcasting occasionally for BBC radio.

During his period in England, he donated his papers to the University of Sussex. The donation has since been organised into two archives, one dealing with Matusow&#x27;s adventures in McCarthyism, the other dealing with his various artistic activities.

===International Society for the Abolition of Data Processing Machines===
Matusow founded the International Society for the Abolition of Data Processing Machines, which claimed 1500 members in 1969. He stated, &quot;The computer has a healthy and conservative function in mathematics and other sciences,&quot; but &quot;when the uses involve business or government, and the individual is tyrannized, then we make our stand.&quot;

===Magic Mouse===
Matusow returned to the United States in 1973 and, on the advice of attorney Paul Marshall, attached himself to the large Renaissance Community commune in Turners Falls, Massachusetts, and marrying the ex-wife of the commune&#x27;s spiritual advisor, the Aquarian Age mystic Elwood Babbitt. He eventually settled in Tucson, Arizona, where, working with the Magic Mouse Theatre, he developed a clown persona named Cockyboo for stage and television. Matusow began Magic Mouse as a radio show in Tucson, Arizona, and slowly it grew into a traveling theater troupe, and in 1979, became the television program &quot;Magic Mouse Magazine&quot;. This led to the creation of &quot;The Babysitter&#x27;s Magic Mouse Storybook&quot;, a self-published book done in collaboration with Hilda Terry, creator of the popular newspaper strip &quot;Teena&quot;. &quot;Some people wanted to revive the Magic Mouse stories,&quot; said Terry, &quot;and he wanted me to illustrate them with my teenagers, from when young girls were more innocent. Teena started as a babysitter during WW2.&quot;

===Conversion===
Later, Matusow converted to the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints and moved to Glenwood, Utah, to start the state&#x27;s first Public-access television cable television program. For a time in the 1980s, after his conversion, he was known as &quot;Job Matusow&quot; and lived with his wife, Emily, in Warwick, Massachusetts. Job and Emily sparked controversy when they allowed members of the Unification Church to live on their land. He made chimes out of melted ammunition and bomb shells during this time and also became involved in collecting clothes for the Rosebud Sioux Reservation in South Dakota.

==Later life and death==
In 2001, Matusow moved to Claremont, New Hampshire, to run the town&#x27;s public-access television studio. On January 2, 2002, he was involved in a car accident, and died from complications of the resulting injuries at his home on January 17, at the age of 75.

==Personal life==
Matusow was married &quot;around a dozen&quot; times, according to his obituary in &quot;The New York Times&quot;. His first wife was Arvilla Peterson Bentley, a McCarthy supporter, and his last wife was Irene Gibson, who he married in the fall of 2001. He had a daughter.

==Legacy==

&quot;The Trials of Harvey Matusow&quot; is a one-man play by Robert Cohen, premiered by its author at the 2010 Brighton Fringe. Based on a year&#x27;s research in the Matusow archives at the University of Sussex, the play depicts Matusow during his seven-year period of self-imposed exile in England, pursuing a variety of artistic activities while looking back on the McCarthy years.

<doc id="733552" wikidata="Q7316776" url="?curid=733552" title="Rinso">
<text>Rinso is a brand name of laundry soap and detergent marketed by Unilever. The brand was created by Robert Spear Hudson and originally branded Hudson&#x27;s Soap, which was sold to Lever Brothers of Port Sunlight, England, in 1908. It was introduced in the United States by Lever Brothers Company in 1918.

==History==

Rinso was one of the first mass-marketed soap powders. It was advertised widely on United States radio, being the sponsor of many radio programs such as the popular daytime soap opera &quot;Big Sister&quot; from 1936 to 1946, the dramatic anthology &quot;Grand Central Station&quot; from 1940 to 1942, the night-time programs &quot;Big Town&quot; from 1937 to 1942, &quot;Mayor of the Town&quot; from 1942 to 1943, and most notably &quot;The Amos &#x27;n&#x27; Andy Show&quot; from 1943 to 1950. During this time the product&#x27;s advertisements happily chanted the slogan &quot;Rinso white, Rinso bright&quot; and boasted that Rinso contained &quot;Solium, the sunlight ingredient&quot;. In 1936 the sponsored show &quot;Rinso Music Hall&quot; was recorded in London and broadcast on Radio Luxembourg and Radio Normandie, followed from 1937 to 1939 by the popular &quot;Rinso Radio Revue&quot;. 

The product&#x27;s claim to better rinsing was due to its incorporation of sodium silicate as a buffer rather than, or in addition to, the more commonly used sodium carbonate. The hard water calcium precipitate formed with metasilicate tends to be finer and hence less likely to be trapped in cloth than the chalky calcium carbonate.

In the 1950s, sales plummeted when a new detergent, Tide, manufactured by rival Procter &amp; Gamble, proved to be much more popular. Rinso was revamped in the early 1950s as a detergent with added bluing agent, and was branded and distinctively packaged as Rinso Blue, to differentiate it from the still available Rinso White soap powder. By the mid-1960s the soap product was discontinued. The detergent was again reformulated, and given a new name, Sunshine Rinso. The justification for the name change was that the new and improved Rinso now had &quot;sunshine whiteners&quot;. There was heavy ad backing (for example, a heavily played commercial during this time period was a pop version of a Sunshine Rinso jingle, set to &quot;You Are My Sunshine&quot;). Sales did not improve appreciably, and Rinso eventually disappeared from store shelves by the mid-1970s, although the liquid detergent Rinso Blue could still be seen on American shelves as recently as the late 1980s.

In 1953 it was the first laundry soap brand introduced in Brazil. Despite being out of production in the country for decades, &quot;Rinso&quot; is still slang for &quot;laundry soap&quot; in some areas in the south of Brazil.

In 1992, the Southern California-based 99 Cents Only Stores purchased the rights to the name &quot;Rinso&quot; from Unilever for use in the United States. Rinso brand cleaning supplies were prominently displayed in their stores.

The Rinso brand was replaced by Unilever with Surf in its four major markets. However, Rinso is still made by Unilever for the Turkish, Asian, and Central American markets. In September 1970, Rinso was launched in Indonesia as the nation&#x27;s first detergent brand. As of 2013, Rinso leads the Indonesian detergent market.

<doc id="733555" wikidata="Q756775" url="?curid=733555" title="2003 Atlantic hurricane season">
<text>The 2003 Atlantic hurricane season was a very active season with tropical cyclogenesis occurring before and after the official bounds of the season—the first such occurrence since the 1970 season. The season produced 21 tropical cyclones, of which 16 developed into named storms; seven of those attained hurricane status, of which three reached major hurricane status. The strongest hurricane of the season was Hurricane Isabel, which reached Category 5 status on the Saffir–Simpson hurricane scale northeast of the Lesser Antilles; Isabel later struck North Carolina as a Category 2 hurricane, causing $3.6 billion in damage (2003 USD) and a total of 51 deaths across the Mid-Atlantic region of the United States.

Although the bounds of the season are typically from June 1 to November 30, the season began early with the formation of Subtropical Storm Ana on April 20, and it ended relatively late on December 11 with the dissipation of Tropical Storm Peter. In early September, Hurricane Fabian struck Bermuda as a Category 3 hurricane, where it was the worst hurricane since 1926; on the island it caused four deaths and $300 million in damage (2003 USD). Hurricane Juan caused considerable destruction to Nova Scotia, particularly Halifax, as a Category 2 hurricane, the first hurricane of significant strength to hit the province since 1893. Additionally, Hurricanes Claudette and Erika struck Texas and Mexico, respectively, as minimal hurricanes. In December, Tropical Storm Odette struck the Dominican Republic, and Tropical Storm Peter formed in the eastern portion of the basin.

==Seasonal forecasts==
===Pre-season outlook===
On May 19, prior to the start of the season, NOAA forecasters issued a 55% probability of above normal activity. The forecasters predicted 11–15 tropical storms, 6–9 of those becoming hurricanes, and 2–4 of those hurricanes reaching at least Category 3 strength on the Saffir–Simpson hurricane scale. The above normal activity predicted was due to the likelihood of La Niña developing in the season.

Noted hurricane expert Dr. William M. Gray on April 4 predicted twelve named storms, with eight reaching hurricane strength and three of the eight reaching Category 3 strength. The prediction issued on May 30 was similar, increasing the named storms to fourteen. The synoptic pattern of the season prior to June 1 resembled other previous seasons, with the 1952, 1954, 1964, 1966, and 1998 seasons considered the best analogs for the season. The prediction also included a 68% probability for a hurricane landfall along the United States.

===Mid-season outlook===
On August 6, Dr. Gray announced he had maintained his previous prediction; with an active start of the season, the rest of the season was forecast to have been only slightly above average, due to an anticipated overall less favorable environment across the Atlantic Ocean. A day later, NOAA released an updated prediction as well, with a 60% probability of above normal activity, with 12–15 named storms, 7–9 hurricanes, and 3–4 major hurricanes expected.

A normal season, as defined by NOAA, has 6–14 tropical storms, 4–8 of which reach hurricane strength, and 1–3 of those reaching Category 3 strength.

==Seasonal summary==

The official beginning of the season was on June 1, 2003, though Subtropical Storm Ana formed on April 20, well before the start to the season. Starting at the official start of the season, the National Hurricane Center began issuing five-day forecasts, extending from the three-day forecasts issued since 1964. Officials conducted tests during the previous two seasons, indicating the new five-day forecasts would be as accurate as the three-day forecasts were 15 years earlier. The tropics were active and well ahead of climatology in the early portion of the season, with the seventh tropical depression forming by the end of July. The season officially ended on November 30, 2003, although tropical storms Odette and Peter developed in early December.

The season is one of only six with a storm before and after the official bounds of the season; the others are 1887, 1951, 1953, 1954, 1970 and 2007. When Tropical Storm Peter formed on December 7, the season became the second on record with two December storms. The 235 days between the development of the first storm, Tropical Storm Ana, and the dissipation of the last storm, Peter, made the 2003 season the longest season since 1952.

Overall, the season&#x27;s activity was reflected with a high cumulative accumulated cyclone energy (ACE) rating of 176. ACE is, broadly speaking, a measure of the power of the hurricane multiplied by the length of time it existed, so storms that last a long time, as well as particularly strong hurricanes, like Isabel and Fabian, have high ACEs. ACE is only calculated for full advisories on tropical systems at or exceeding 34 knots ( or tropical storm strength. Subtropical cyclones are excluded from the total.

No cyclones in the season had a significant impact on South America or Central America. However, a total of eight tropical cyclones made landfall on Mexico from either the Atlantic or the Pacific Ocean, which was the greatest total since the record of nine in 1971. A total of seven deaths occurred in Mexico from Atlantic hurricanes. Much of the Caribbean did not receive significant impact from tropical cyclones during the season.
Six tropical cyclones made landfall along the coast of the United States during the season, including two hurricanes. The first, Claudette, caused locally heavy damage in southeastern Texas in July; two deaths were reported in the state, while earlier in its duration it caused an indirect death from rough waves in Florida. In September, Hurricane Isabel caused deaths and damage from North Carolina through southern Canada. The worst damage from the hurricane occurred in Virginia, where it was the costliest disaster in the history of the state; there, damage totaled over $1.85 billion (2003 USD), and there were 32 fatalities, ten of which were caused directly by the hurricane. Hurricane Isabel caused deaths in seven states and one Canadian province, and about 6 million people were left without power as a result of the storm.

Several cyclones impacted Bermuda during the season, most significantly Hurricane Fabian. On the island, its passage proved to be the costliest and resulted in the first death since a hurricane in 1926. The hurricane killed four on the island when its strong waves and storm surge washed two cars off the causeway between St. George&#x27;s Parish and St. David&#x27;s Island. Damage from the hurricane totaled $300 million (2003 USD). Elsewhere, Hurricane Juan was considered among the most damaging in the history of Halifax, Nova Scotia, where strong winds downed thousands of trees and left low-lying areas flooded from a record storm surge to the city. The hurricane caused a total of eight deaths and damage estimated at $200 million (2003 CAD, $150 million 2003 USD).

==Systems==
===Tropical Storm Ana===
A non-tropical low-pressure area developed about south-southwest of Bermuda on April 18 through the interaction of an upper-level trough and a surface frontal trough. It tracked northwestward at first, then turned to the southeast. After developing centralized convection, the system developed into Subtropical Storm Ana on April 20 to the west of Bermuda. It tracked east-southeastward and organized, and on April 21 it transitioned into a tropical cyclone with peak winds of , after developing an upper-level warm core. Increased wind shear caused fluctuations in intensity and a steady weakening trend, and on April 24 the center of Ana merged with an approaching cold front, thus signaling the completion of extratropical transition. The extratropical remnants continued east-northeastward, and on April 27 the gale was absorbed within the cold front.

The cyclone is most notable for being the only Atlantic tropical cyclone in the month of April, until Tropical Storm Arlene in 2017. When Ana became a subtropical storm, it became the second subtropical cyclone on record in the month, after a storm in 1992. Ana dropped of rainfall in Bermuda over a period of several days. Increased swells from the storm caused two drowning deaths in southeastern Florida when a boat capsized. The remnants of the storm brought light rainfall to the Azores and the United Kingdom, though no significant damage was reported.
===Tropical Depression Two===

A tropical wave moved off the coast of Africa on June 6. Tracking westward at a low latitude, a disturbance along the wave axis became better organized on June 9, with reasonable favorable environmental conditions for that time of year. Initially lacking a well-defined low-level circulation, convection increased markedly on June 10. The system was declared Tropical Depression Two early on June 11 in the central tropical Atlantic Ocean. The depression was at the time the third tropical cyclone on record to develop in the month of June to the east of the Lesser Antilles; the others were Tropical Depression Two in 2000, Ana in 1979, and a storm in 1933. The next such system to accomplish this would be Bret in 2017.

Initially, the depression was forecast to attain tropical storm status, maintaining good outflow and some banding features around the system. Around 09:00 UTC on June 11, satellite-based intensity estimates indicated the depression was near tropical storm status. However, the convection subsequently diminished and became displaced to the northeast of the center, and late on June 11 the depression degenerated into an open tropical wave about east-southeast of Barbados. The tropical wave remained well defined with a well-defined low-level vorticity, though strong wind shear prevented tropical redevelopment. On June 13 its remnants passed through the Windward Islands and subsequently entered the Caribbean.
===Tropical Storm Bill===
Tropical Storm Bill developed from a tropical wave on June 29 to the north of the Yucatán Peninsula. It slowly organized as it moved northward, and reached a peak of shortly before making landfall west of Chauvin, Louisiana. Bill quickly weakened over land, and as it accelerated to the northeast, moisture from the storm, combined with cold air from an approaching cold front, produced an outbreak of 34 tornadoes. Bill became extratropical on July 2, and was absorbed by the cold front later that day.

Upon making landfall on Louisiana, the storm produced a moderate storm surge, causing tidal flooding. In a city in the northeastern portion of the state, the surge breached a levee, which flooded many homes in the town. Moderate winds combined with wet soil knocked down trees, which then hit a few houses and power lines, and left hundreds of thousands without electric power. Further inland, tornadoes from the storm produced localized moderate damage. Throughout its path, Tropical Storm Bill caused around $50 million in damage (2003 USD) and four deaths.
===Hurricane Claudette===
A well-organized tropical wave tracked quickly through the Lesser Antilles on July 7, producing tropical storm force winds but failing to attain a low-level circulation. After organizing in the Caribbean, it developed into Tropical Storm Claudette to the south of the Dominican Republic on July 8. Its intensity fluctuated over the subsequent days, attaining hurricane status briefly on July 10 before weakening and hitting Puerto Morelos on the Yucatán Peninsula on July 11 as a tropical storm. The storm remained disorganized due to moderate wind shear, though after turning west-northwestward into an area of lighter shear, it re-attained hurricane status on July 15 off the coast of Texas; it intensified quickly and made landfall on Matagorda Island with peak winds of . It slowly weakened after moving ashore, tracking across northern Tamaulipas before dissipating in northwestern Chihuahua.

The precursor cyclone caused light damage in the Lesser Antilles, and waves from the hurricane caused an indirect death off of Florida. Widespread flooding and gusty winds destroyed or severely damaged 412 buildings in southeast Texas, with a further 1,346 buildings suffering lighter impact. The hurricane caused locally severe beach erosion along the coast. High winds downed many trees along the coast, causing one direct and one indirect death. Damage was estimated at $180 million (2003 USD).
===Hurricane Danny===
A tropical wave moved off the coast of Africa on July 9. The northern portion of the wave tracked to the west-northwest, and on July 13 an area of convection developed along the wave axis. The system slowly organized, and after a closed low-level circulation developed, the system was classified as Tropical Depression Five about east of Bermuda. It quickly organized, becoming Tropical Storm Danny a day after forming. Tracking around the periphery of an anticyclone, the storm moved northwestward before turning north and later northeastward. Despite being located at a high latitude, Danny continued to strengthen due to unusually warm water temperatures, and on July 19 it attained hurricane status about south of St. John&#x27;s, Newfoundland and Labrador, despite having an unusually high minimum pressure for a storm of its intensity.

Wind shear increased the next day as the hurricane turned eastward, causing a steady weakening trend that was accelerated after crossing into an area of cooler water temperatures. By July 20 the cyclone had turned to the southeast and weakened to tropical depression status, and on July 21 it degenerated into a remnant low-pressure area. The remnants of Danny tracked erratically southwestward before dissipating on July 27 about east of where it originally developed. There were no reports of damages or casualties associated with Danny.
===Tropical Depression Six===

A tropical wave moved westward off the coast of Africa on July 14. After tracking steadily westward, an area of thunderstorms became more concentrated as its upper-level environment became more favorable, and late on July 19 the National Hurricane Center classified it as Tropical Depression Six while it was located about east of the Lesser Antilles. Upon being classified as a tropical cyclone, the depression maintained two ill-defined hooking bands to its north and south, and was originally forecast to attain hurricane status before passing through the Lesser Antilles. With warm waters and very light wind shear forecast, its environmental conditions met four out of five parameters for rapid intensification. Subsequently, convection diminished as the result of cold air inflow and instability from a disturbance to its southeast.

With a fast forward speed, confirmation of a low-level circulation on July 20 became difficult. Convection increased in curvature on July 21, and several islands in the Lesser Antilles issued tropical storm warnings and watches. After it passed north of Barbados, a Hurricane hunters flight failed to report a closed low-level circulation, and it is estimated the depression degenerated into an open tropical wave late on July 21. The remnants brought a few showers to the Lesser Antilles, and after tracking into the Caribbean redevelopment was prevented by increased wind shear. The northern portion of the wave axis split and developed into Tropical Depression Seven.

===Tropical Depression Seven===

A tropical wave interacted with an upper-level low to develop an area of deep convection near Hispaniola on July 23. A mid- to lower-level circulation developed within the system at it tracked generally north-northwestward, and based on surface and satellite observations, it is estimated the system developed into Tropical Depression Seven at 1200 UTC on July 25 about east of Daytona Beach, Florida. The system was embedded in an environment characterized by high surface pressures. Tracking through an area of cool water temperatures, as well as unfavorable upper-level winds, the depression failed to achieve winds greater than .

Early on July 26 it moved ashore on St. Catherines Island, Georgia, and after steadily weakening over land it dissipated on July 27. As the storm was never forecast to attain tropical storm status, no tropical storm warnings or watches were issued. However, flood watches were posted for much of Georgia and South Carolina. The depression dropped light to moderate rainfall from Florida to the coast of North Carolina, peaking at in Savannah, Georgia. Mostly, rainfall totals between were common. There were no reports of damage or casualties associated with this depression.
===Hurricane Erika===
The precursor system to Hurricane Erika was first noted as a non-tropical low on August 9 about east of Bermuda. It tracked quickly southwestward then westward in tandem with an upper-level low, which prevented tropical development. On August 13 an area of convection increased as it passed through the Bahamas, and while crossing Florida a circulation built toward the surface; it is estimated the system developed into Tropical Storm Erika on August 14 about west-southwest of Fort Myers, Florida. A strong ridge caused the storm to continue quickly westward, and the system gradually strengthened and organized. By August 15 its forward motion slowed, allowing the convection to organize into curved rainbands, and late in the day an eye feature began developing. Tropical Storm Erika attained hurricane status at around 1030 UTC as it was moving ashore in northeastern Tamaulipas; operationally it was not classified as a hurricane, due to lack of data. The winds rapidly decreased as it tracked across the mountainous terrain of northeastern Mexico, and early on August 17 the cyclone dissipated.

The hurricane dropped light to moderate rainfall along its path, which caused some flooding; in Montemorelos in Nuevo León, two people died after being swept away by floodwaters. Several mudslides were reported, which left numerous highways blocked or impassable. In southern Texas, the hurricane caused light winds and minor damage, with no reports of deaths or injuries in the United States.
===Tropical Depression Nine===

A strong tropical wave moved off the coast of Africa on August 14, and after tracking steadily westward an area of convection began to become better organized on August 18. After it tracked through the Lesser Antilles, it developed into Tropical Depression Nine on August 21 to the south of Puerto Rico. The depression quickly showed signs of organization, and forecasters predicted the depression to intensify to a strong tropical storm. However, strong southwesterly wind shear unexpectedly became established over the system, and the depression degenerated into a tropical wave late on August 22 to the south of the eastern tip of the Dominican Republic.

The depression caused moderate rainfall in Puerto Rico, where of precipitation were recorded. The flooding from the rainfall entered 10 houses and left some streets impassable. A mudslide was reported in the eastern portion of the island. A river in northeastern Puerto Rico surpassed its banks from flooding, though it returned to normal levels within hours. Damage in Puerto Rico totaled $20,000 (2003 USD$,  USD). The remnants of the depression dropped light to moderate precipitation in the Dominican Republic, which caused flooding and overflowing rivers. More than 100 houses were flooded, and some crop damage was reported. The rainfall was welcome in the country, as conditions were dry in the preceding months. Flooding was also reported in eastern Jamaica, though damage there, if any, is unknown.
=== Hurricane Fabian ===
On August 25, a tropical wave emerged off the coast of Africa, and two days later developed enough organized convection to develop into Tropical Depression Ten. Tracking through warm waters and low vertical shear, the depression was named Tropical Storm Fabian on August 28. On August 30, the storm intensified into a hurricane, and it quickly strengthened to attain major hurricane status late that day; on September 1 Fabian reached its peak intensity of . The hurricane turned to the north and gradually weakened before passing west of Bermuda on September 5 with winds of . The cyclone accelerated northeastward into an environment of unfavorable conditions, becoming an extratropical cyclone on September 8; two days later it merged with another extratropical storm between southern Greenland and Iceland.

Strong waves caused extensive damage to the Bermuda coastline, destroying 10 nests of the endangered Bermuda petrel. The storm surge from the hurricane stranded one vehicle with three police officers and another with a resident on the causeway between St. George&#x27;s Parish and St. David&#x27;s Island, later washing both vehicles into Castle Harbour; all four were killed. Strong winds left about 25,000 people without power on the island, and also caused severe damage to vegetation. The strong winds damaged or destroyed the roofs of numerous buildings on Bermuda, Damage on the island totaled $300 million (2003 USD). Elsewhere, strong waves from the hurricane killed a surfer in North Carolina and caused three deaths off of Newfoundland when a fishing vessel sank.
===Tropical Storm Grace===
A strong tropical wave accompanied with a low-pressure system moved off the coast of Africa on August 19. It moved quickly westward, failing to organize significantly, and developed a surface low-pressure area on August 29 in the Gulf of Mexico. Convection continued to organize, and the tropical wave developed into Tropical Depression Eleven on August 30 while located east-southeast of Corpus Christi, Texas. The depression quickly intensified to become Tropical Storm Grace, though further intensification was limited due to a nearby upper-level low. On August 31, Grace moved ashore on Galveston Island, Texas, and it quickly weakened over land. The storm turned northeastward and was absorbed by a cold front over extreme eastern Oklahoma on September 2.

The storm produced light to moderate precipitation from Texas through the eastern United States, peaking at in eastern Texas. Near where it made landfall, Grace produced flooding of low-lying areas and light beach erosion. In Oklahoma and southern Missouri, the remnants of the storm caused localized flooding. No deaths were reported, and damage was minimal.

===Tropical Storm Henri===
On August 22, a tropical wave moved off the coast of Africa, and it remained disorganized until reaching the eastern Gulf of Mexico on September 1. A tropical disturbance developed into Tropical Depression Twelve on September 3 about west of Tampa, Florida. It moved eastward and strengthened into Tropical Storm Henri on September 5, and despite strong wind shear it intensified to reach peak winds of later that day. Subsequently, it quickly weakened, and it struck the western Florida coast as a tropical depression. On September 8 it degenerated into a remnant low-pressure area off the coast of North Carolina, and after moving ashore near Cape Hatteras, it crossed the Mid-Atlantic states and dissipated on September 17 over New England.

Henri was responsible for locally heavy rainfall across Florida, but damage was minimal. The remnants of Henri caused heavy precipitation in Delaware and Pennsylvania, causing $19.6 million in damage (2003 USD). In Delaware, the rainfall caused record-breaking river flooding, with part of the Red Clay Creek experiencing a 500-year flood, and the system left 109,000 residents without power in Pennsylvania. The impacts of the storm were severely compounded the following week by Hurricane Isabel across the region.
===Hurricane Isabel===

A tropical wave moved off the coast of Africa on September 1, which developed into Tropical Depression Thirteen early on September 6 to the southwest of the Cape Verde islands. It quickly intensified into Tropical Storm Isabel, and it continued to gradually intensify within an area of light wind shear and warm waters. Isabel strengthened to a hurricane on September 7, and the following day it attained major hurricane status. Its intensity fluctuated over the subsequent days as it passed north of the Lesser Antilles, and it attained peak winds of on September 11, a Category 5 hurricane on the Saffir–Simpson scale. The hurricane oscillated between Category 4 and Category 5 status over the following four days, before weakening due to wind shear. On September 18 Isabel made landfall between Cape Lookout and Ocracoke Island in North Carolina with winds of . It continued northwestward, becoming extratropical over western Pennsylvania before being absorbed by a larger storm over Ontario on September 19.

Strong winds from Isabel extended from North Carolina to New England and westward to West Virginia. The winds, combined with previous rainfall which moistened the soil, downed many trees and power lines across its path, leaving about 6 million electricity customers without power at some point. Coastal areas suffered from waves and its powerful storm surge, with areas in eastern North Carolina and southeast Virginia reporting severe damage from both winds and the storm surge. Throughout its path, Isabel resulted in $3.6 billion in damage (2003 USD) and 47 deaths, of which 16 were directly related to the storm&#x27;s effects.

The governors of Pennsylvania, West Virginia, Maryland, New Jersey, and Delaware declared states of emergencies. Isabel was the first major hurricane to threaten the Mid-Atlantic states and the South since Hurricane Floyd in September 1999. Isabel&#x27;s greatest impact was due to flood damage, the worst in some areas of Virginia since 1972&#x27;s Hurricane Agnes. More than 60 million people were affected to some degree — a similar number to Floyd but more than any other hurricane in recent memory.
===Tropical Depression Fourteen===

A strong tropical wave moved off the coast of Africa on September 6, and almost immediately it became associated with a broad surface circulation. With favorable upper-level winds the system quickly became better organized, and on September 8, it possessed enough organization to be classified as Tropical Depression Fourteen while located about southeast of the southernmost Cape Verde islands. Initially the depression failed to maintain an inner core of deep convection, and despite its occurrence with nearby dry air, the depression was forecast to intensify to hurricane status due to anticipated favorable conditions.

In the hours subsequent to formation, the convection near the center decreased as the banding features dissipated. Dry air greatly increased over the depression, and by September 9 the system was not forecast to intensify past minimal tropical storm status. Later that day an upper-level low tracked southward to the west of the depression, which increased wind shear and caused a steady north-northwest motion for the depression. The circulation became elongated and separated from the convection as it passed just west of the Cape Verde Islands, where it brought heavy rainfall, and on September 10 the depression dissipated.
===Hurricane Juan===
A large tropical wave moved off the coast of Africa on September 14, and due to unfavorable wind shear it initially remained disorganized. An area of convection increased in association with an upper-level low, and it developed into Tropical Depression Fifteen on September 24 to the southeast of Bermuda. It steadily organized as it tracked northward, intensifying into Tropical Storm Juan on September 25 and attaining hurricane status on September 26. With warm waters and light wind shear, Juan reached peak winds of on September 27 about south of Halifax, Nova Scotia. It accelerated northward, weakening only slightly before moving ashore near Halifax on September 29 with winds of . It quickly weakened while crossing the southern Canadian Maritimes before being absorbed by a large extratropical cyclone over the Gulf of Saint Lawrence.

The eyewall of Hurricane Juan was the first to directly cross over Halifax since a hurricane in August of 1893; the cyclone became one of the most damaging tropical cyclones in modern history for the city. The hurricane produced a record storm surge of , which resulted in extensive flooding of the Halifax and Dartmouth waterfront properties. Strong winds caused widespread occurrences of falling trees, downed power lines, and damaged houses, and the hurricane was responsible for four direct deaths and four indirect deaths. More than 800,000 people were left without power. Nearly all wind-related damage occurred to the east of the storm track, and damage amounted to about $200 million (2003 CAD; $150 million 2003 USD).
===Hurricane Kate===

On September 21, a tropical wave exited the west coast of Africa and continued westward, passing near the Cape Verde islands two days later. A low-level circulation developed amid an area of convection, organizing into Tropical Depression Sixteen on September 25. The NHC anticipated steady strengthening to reach within 48 hours, the depression failed to intensify due to wind shear. On September 27, convection increased near the center, and the depression strengthened into Tropical Storm Kate. The storm turned to the northeast, steered by a trough to its north. Despite the wind shear, Kate continued strengthening as it developed an eye, and the storm attained hurricane status for about 12 hours early on September 29, while located southwest of the Azores. Later that day, Kate weakened and lost its organization as it slowed, curving westward around a mid-level circulation. By October 1, the storm was moving west-southwestward in an area of warmer waters and lighter wind shear. That day, Kate regained hurricane status, and a well-defined eye developed by October 2. On the next day it strengthened to attain major hurricane status, and on October 4 Hurricane Kate reached a peak intensity of while located east of Bermuda. Around that time, Kate had a nearly-solid ring of convection around a well-defined eye.

After reaching its peak intensity, Kate started weakening as it slowed and turned northward, having reached the western periphery of the subtropical ridge. An approaching trough accelerated the northward movement, while also increasing wind shear. The eye re-appeared occasionally on satellite imagery until early on October 7, when Kate moved over cooler waters, and it weakened to tropical storm status. After passing east of Newfoundland, Kate transitioned an extratropical cyclone early on October 8. It remained a powerful cyclone, reattaining hurricane-force winds while passing southeast of Greenland. The cyclone turned eastward, passing a short distance south of Iceland, and later merged with another extratropical storm near Scandinavia on October 10.

The interaction between Kate and a high pressure area to its north produced waves along the coast of North Carolina and New England. In Atlantic Canada, which was hit by Hurricane Juan weeks prior, officials advised residents to prepare by cleaning debris and securing loose objects. A cruise ship was redirected to avoid the storm. The Newfoundland and Maritimes Weather Center issued a storm warning for Newfoundland, while the Canadian Hurricane Centre issued a hurricane-force wind warning. Due to the expected combination of moisture from Kate and a cold front, the Canadian Hurricane Centre also issued a heavy rainfall warning for southeastern Newfoundland. The strongest winds of Kate remained away from any landmasses, though the large circulation produced sustained winds of up to at Cape Race, Newfoundland. The storm also generated strong swells and surf along the southern portion of the Avalon Peninsula, reaching heights of . Rainfall in southeastern Newfoundland reached over . St. John&#x27;s reported on October 6, a record for the date, but not enough to cause flooding. The extratropical remnant of Hurricane Kate produced winds of up to in northern Scotland.
===Tropical Storm Larry===
A tropical wave moved off the coast of Africa on September 17, which developed a low-pressure area on September 27 in the western Caribbean. It moved ashore along the Yucatán Peninsula on September 29 and developed into an extratropical cyclone as it interacted with a stationary cold front. Deep convection increased, and it transitioned into Tropical Storm Larry by October 1. The storm drifted generally southward, and after reaching peak winds of it made landfall in the Mexican state of Tabasco on October 5, the first landfall in the region since Hurricane Brenda in 1973. The remnants of Larry crossed the Isthmus of Tehuantepec, degenerating into a remnant low-pressure area before dissipating on October 7 in the eastern Pacific Ocean.

The storm caused flooding and mudslides throughout the region, and coincided with the landfall in southwestern Mexico of two Pacific tropical cyclones, Nora and Olaf, adding to the damage. Overall, the storm resulted in five deaths and $53.4 million in damage (2003 USD).
===Tropical Storm Mindy===

A tropical wave exited the coast of Africa on October 1 and moved westward. On October 8, thunderstorms spread across the Lesser Antilles, and the wave slowly organized. Rainfall reached in Christiansted in Saint Croix, and near Ponce, Puerto Rico. Strong winds left around 29,000 people without power in northeastern Puerto Rico. The rainfall wrecked bridges in Las Piedras and Guayama, and led to flooded streams, downed trees, and rockslides that closed four roads. One car was swept away, and a few houses were flooded. The damage total was at least $46,000 (2003 USD).

It turned northwestward through a weakness in the subtropical ridge, and despite strong wind shear developed into Tropical Storm Mindy late on October 10 over eastern Dominican Republic, with peak winds of . It produced of rain in Santiago Rodríguez, which caused flooding and damaged 320 houses. Although forecast to intensify to winds, the storm weakened due to the wind shear. The center passed near the Turks and Caicos Islands on October 11, and winds reached only at Grand Turk Island. On October 12, Mindy weakened to a tropical depression, and later turned eastward due to an approaching short-wave trough. Devoid of deep convection, the circulation dissipated on October 14 about south-southwest of Bermuda. Mindy produced swells along the U.S. Atlantic coast from Florida through North Carolina.
===Tropical Storm Nicholas===

A tropical wave moved off the coast of Africa on October 9. It moved westward and developed a broad area of low pressure along the wave on October 10. After the circulation became well-defined near its thunderstorms, a tropical depression formed on October 13 while located west-southwest of the Cape Verde islands. Located within an area of moderate southwesterly wind shear, the depression was slow to organize, strengthening into Tropical Storm Nicholas on October 14. Despite the wind shear, the storm continued to strengthen as it moved to the west-northwest, steered by a ridge to its north. On October 16, Nicholas became a more organized system after the shear diminished, with banding features and improvement in its convective pattern. Nicholas attained a peak intensity of on October 17 while located east of the Leeward Islands. Shortly after peaking in strength, Nicholas weakened due to increasing southwesterly wind shear, and the center of circulation briefly became exposed from the deep convection. In response to a break in the subtropical ridge, the storm turned to the north on October 18. After falling to minimal tropical storm status on October 20, Nicholas briefly restrengthened, only to weaken again, falling to tropical depression status on October 23. A day later, it transitioned into an extratropical cyclone about 580 mi (935 km) southeast of Bermuda.
After becoming post-tropical, the remnants of Nicholas executed a large anticyclonic loop, resulting in a westward motion and a brief re-intensification into an extratropical storm on October 29. The storm continued to the west along a warm front associated with a non-tropical low to its southwest, and executed a second anticyclonic loop to the south. On October 30, convection increased over the low-level circulation of what was left to Nicholas, and the National Hurricane Center indicated a potential for tropical or subtropical development as it moved towards warmer waters. The system executed a small cyclonic loop, and on October 31 the system organized into a tropical low. It turned westward towards a non-tropical low, and on November 1 the remnants of Nicholas was absorbed by the low. The system moved across Florida two days later. Gusty winds from the low produced heavy surf and rip currents along the east and west coast of Florida, and a wind gust of was recorded in Cape Canaveral as a rainband from the system moved ashore. The low also resulted in two to four foot (0.6 to 1.2 m) swells along the East Coast of the United States. The system later crossed the Gulf of Mexico and eventually moved into Louisiana on November 4.
===Tropical Storm Odette===
Odette was a rare December tropical storm, the first since Hurricane Lili in 1984, that formed on December 4 in the southwest Caribbean Sea. It became the second December tropical storm on record to form in the Caribbean Sea, after a hurricane in 1822. Odette strengthened and made landfall near Cabo Falso in the Dominican Republic on December 6 as a moderately strong tropical storm. A day later, Odette became extratropical, and eventually merged with a cold front.

Eight deaths were directly attributed to this tropical storm in the Dominican Republic due to mudslides or flash flooding. In addition, two deaths were indirectly caused by the storm. Approximately 35% of the nation&#x27;s banana crop was destroyed. Light to moderate rainfall was reported in Puerto Rico.
===Tropical Storm Peter===
By December 5, an extratropical cyclone developed and was moving southward, isolated from the westerlies. Convection developed near the center, and the system organized into a subtropical storm late on December 7, about south-southwest of the Azores. The system moved southwestward over warmer waters, and deep convection continued to organize over the center. Banding features also increased, and the National Hurricane Center declared the system as Tropical Storm Peter on December 9, about northwest of the Cape Verde islands. With the development of Peter and Odette, 2003 became the first year since 1887 that two storms were active in the month of December.

Initially, the National Hurricane Center did not anticipate strengthening; however, Peter intensified to winds of late on December 9, after an eye feature developed. Usually that would indicate hurricane intensity, but as the eye was short-lived, Peter remained a tropical storm. It turned northward ahead of the same frontal system that absorbed Tropical Storm Odette, and the combination of strong upper-level winds and cooler water temperatures caused quick weakening. By December 10, Peter degenerated into a tropical depression, and after turning northeastward it was absorbed by the cold front the next day.
==Storm names==

The following list of names was used for named storms that formed in the North Atlantic in 2003. This is the same list used for the 1997 season. Storms were named &quot;Larry&quot;, &quot;Mindy&quot;, &quot;Nicholas&quot;, &quot;Odette&quot;, and &quot;Peter&quot; for the first time in 2003.

===Retirement===

In the spring of 2004, The World Meteorological Organization retired &quot;Fabian&quot;, &quot;Isabel&quot;, and &quot;Juan&quot; from the Atlantic hurricane name lists. They were replaced with &quot;Fred&quot;, &quot;Ida&quot;, and &quot;Joaquin&quot;, respectively, for the 2009 season.

==Season effects==
This is a table of all of the storms that formed in the 2003 Atlantic hurricane season. It includes their name, duration, peak classification and intensities, areas affected, damage, and death totals. Deaths in parentheses are additional and indirect (an example of an indirect death would be a traffic accident), but were still related to that storm. Damage and deaths include totals while the storm was extratropical, a wave, or a low, and all of the damage figures are in 2003 USD.

<text>Church &amp; Dwight Co., Inc. is an American consumer goods company focusing on personal care, household products, and specialty products. The company was founded in 1847 and is headquartered in Ewing, New Jersey. It is the parent company of well-known brands such as Arm &amp; Hammer, Trojan, OxiClean, and First Response. In 2022, Church &amp; Dwight reported annual revenue of $5.4 billion. The company&#x27;s products and services include a wide range of consumer goods, including laundry detergent, air fresheners, baking soda, condoms, pregnancy tests, and oral hygiene products.

== History ==

The company was founded in 1847 to unify two companies created by John Dwight of Massachusetts and his brother-in-law, Austin Church of Connecticut. Their partnership had begun in 1846 with the two founders selling sodium bicarbonate (also known as baking soda) that they refined in Dwight&#x27;s kitchen.

The Arm &amp; Hammer name and logo, which dates back to the 1860s, is often incorrectly claimed to have originated with tycoon Armand Hammer. Hammer was so often asked about the Church &amp; Dwight brand that he attempted to buy the company. While this attempt was unsuccessful, Hammer&#x27;s Occidental Petroleum in 1986 acquired enough stock for him to join the Church &amp; Dwight board of directors until he died in 1990.

In 1970, the Arm &amp; Hammer brand introduced the market&#x27;s first nationally distributed, phosphate-free detergent: Arm &amp; Hammer Powder Laundry Detergent.

===2000s===
In 2001, Church &amp; Dwight acquired the consumer product line of Carter-Wallace, and MedPointe bought the diagnostics and drug businesses. The same year, Church &amp; Dwight expanded its business into laundry detergent products by acquiring small detergent company USA Detergents, the original owner of Xtra detergent.

In 2003, Church &amp; Dwight bought the U.S. and Canadian rights to Unilever&#x27;s oral health business, which includes Pepsodent, Mentadent, Close-Up, and Aim. Unilever still owns the brands outside of North America.

In 2006, Church &amp; Dwight expanded its household brand portfolio with the acquisition of Denver-based Orange Glo International, which included such brands as OxiClean in the laundry pre-wash additive category, Kaboom bathroom cleaners, and Orange Glo household cleaning products.

In 2008, Church &amp; Dwight acquired the Orajel business from Del Labs, including pain relievers for toothache, mouth sore, teething, and non-fluoride toothpaste.

===2010s===
Church &amp; Dwight was ranked 723 in the Fortune 500 listing of companies in 2010. The same year, Church &amp; Dwight acquired Simply Saline and Feline Pine.

In 2016, Church &amp; Dwight acquired Spencer Forrest, Inc., the maker of Toppik hair care products.

In 2017, MidOcean Partners agreed to sell Water Pik to Church &amp; Dwight for $1 billion. At the time of the sale announcement, it was reported that Water Pik had &quot;$265 million of revenue in the fiscal year ended June 30, about 70% of which came from its water flosser products&quot;.

====2020s====
In December 2021, the company acquired TheraBreath for a reported amount of $580 million.

<text>Zagato is a coachbuilding company founded by Ugo Zagato in 1919. The design center of the company is located in Terrazzano, a village near Rho, Lombardy, Italy.

==History==

===The 1910s: Aeronautics===
Ugo Zagato was an Italian automotive designer and builder. He was born in Gavello near Rovigo on June 25, 1890. He began his coach-building career in 1919 when he left &quot;Officine Aeronautica Pomilio&quot; to set up his own business in Milan. He intended to transfer various construction techniques from aeronautics to the automotive sector. Cars of the time were often bulky and heavy; Zagato envisioned them as lightweight structures with a frame in sheet aluminum; similar to an aircraft fuselage.

===The 1920s: Classic models===
During the 1920s, Zagato&#x27;s focus was on designing race cars. At the beginning of the decade, he was asked by Alfa Romeo to design bodies for some of its G1, RL, and RM models. In 1925 Vittorio Jano, Alfa Romeo&#x27;s Chief Engineer, asked him to create a body for the Alfa Romeo P2&#x27;s heir, the Alfa 6C 1500. Zagato, using his knowledge of aeronautics, designed a sleek, light body for the car. It scored second place overall at the 1927 Mille Miglia and won the 1928 edition. The 1500&#x27;s technical qualities were improved upon with the Alfa Romeo 6C 1750, introduced in 1927 with several body styles (Turismo, Sport, Gran Turismo, Super Sport, and Gran Sport). The 1750 would go on to achieve overall victories in the 1929 and 1930 Mille Miglia (Taking the first four spots in the latter date). In 1929, Enzo Ferrari, at the time a racing driver for Alfa Romeo, founded Scuderia Ferrari as the official team for Alfa Romeo&#x27;s race cars.

===The 1930s: Aerodynamic models===
Zagato continued to build a variety of aerodynamic cars, adopting inclined windscreens, more aerodynamic headlights, and convex boot lids. He also favored perforated disc wheels that improved brake cooling. All Alfa Romeo 8Cs received coachwork from Zagato. In January 1932, Zagato-bodied cars also began to be built by Carrozzeria Brianza. Bianchi, Fiat, Isotta Fraschini, Lancia, Maserati, and OM all experimented with lightweight and aerodynamic Zagato bodies, especially for race cars. The list of victories includes eight Mille Miglia, four Targa Florio, four Le Mans, and four Spa Francorchamps OA victories. In the 1930s, Zagato-bodied models began to compete and dominate in different classes and categories. Thirty-six Zagato-bodied cars entered the 1938 Mille Miglia, making up one-third of the participants.

===The 1940s: Panoramic models===
At the outbreak of the Second World War, Zagato left Milan and fled to Lake Maggiore. On 13 August 1943, an RAF bombing raid destroyed his coachworks on Corso Sempione road. He found new premises at Saronno alongside the Isotta Fraschini works, on behalf of which he constructed trucks, military vehicles, and a futuristic 8C Monterosa. He returned to Milan at the end of the war and re-established his company at Via Giorgini 16, close to the Alfa Romeo historic home at Portello.

Zagato wanted to design more spacious and comfortable greenhouse-style cars characterized by airiness and good visibility. Incorporating large, glazed areas made of plexiglass, a lightweight material that replaced heavier traditional glass, the &quot;Panoramic&quot; body style, an invention of Vieri Rapi, chief Zagato stylist at that time, would mark the rebirth of his coachwork. Alfa Romeo, Fiat, Lancia, Maserati, and MG employed this innovative body design. In 1949, he built a Panoramic body for the Ferrari 166 Mille Miglia belonging to Antonio Stagnoli, the first Ferrari coupé for a client.

===The 1950s: Gran Turismo models===
In 1947, Elio Zagato, Ugo&#x27;s first-born son, received an open-top sports car based on a Fiat 500 B chassis as a gift for his graduation from Bocconi University of Milan. This car represented the beginning of his career as a driver, earning 83 podium spots in 160 races. The birth of the Gran Turismo category, conceived in 1949 by Count Giovanni Lurani, journalist Giovanni Canestrini, and Elio himself revolutionized the world of automotive competition. The category comprised cars with sports coachwork and a production chassis or bodyshell. AC, Alfa Romeo, Abarth, Aston Martin, Bristol, Ferrari, Fiat, Fraser Nash, Maserati, Jaguar, Osca, Porsche, and Renault wore Zagato GT bodies. In 1955, Elio Zagato scored a victory in the International Gran Turismo Championship at the Avus circuit, driving a Fiat 8V GT Zagato.

===The 1960s: Fuoriserie models===
The increasing demand for specialized bodies required a change from a handcrafted to an industrial production methods. Elio Zagato found a larger location at 30 Via Arese in Terrazzano (northwest of Milan), close to Arese where Alfa Romeo would soon choose to establish new plants. 

In this period, Zagato&#x27;s mission was to design special bodies to be assembled in series and fitted with mechanical parts and interiors supplied by major constructors. Under the partnership with Alfa Romeo, the Giulia SZ, TZ, TZ2, 2600 SZ, 1750 4R, and the Junior Zagato were born. 

In partnership with Lancia, Zagato continued the “Sport” series with the Lancia Appia Sport, the Flaminia Sport and Super Sport, the Flavia Sport and Super Sport, and the Fulvia Sport and Sport Spider. 

In addition to these, some designs were commissioned by special customers, including Bristol, Fiat, Ford, Lamborghini, Honda, Osca, Rover, and Volvo vehicles. In 1960 Ugo Zagato was awarded the Compasso d&#x27;Oro for the design of the Abarth 1000 Bialbero.

===The 1970s: Geometric models===

In response to the Oil Crisis and in contrast to the anti-functionalist trends of the era, Zagato proposed the production of electric cars such as the Zagato Zele two-seater. In 1971, a new Ferrari Zagato, the 3Z, came to life thanks to Luigi Chinetti, who financed the decidedly angular spider. In the same year, it was introduced at the Turin Motor Show and signaled the definitive departure from the SZ, TZ, Lancia Flaminia and Appia&#x27;s curvy lines to embrace the squared design of the Lancia Fulvia Sport and Alfa Romeo Junior Z. Chinetti himself made a further special order. 

In the 1970s, Zagato also started a new project for a mid-engine concept which became the Cadillac N.A.R.T., a luxurious, sophisticated, high-performance four-seater. The front-wheel-drive powertrain of a Cadillac Eldorado was relocated to create a mid-engine layout. Zagato was asked to build the prototype from the drawings and a clay model that was conceived in GM&#x27;s studios. Other notable projects from this time include the Fiat Aster (Based on the 132) and the Volvo GTZ. The Zagato facility in Terrazzano also saw the assembly of the Lancia Beta Sport Spider, which established Lancia&#x27;s name in America and Australia, as well as the Bristol 412 Targa, whose design was very similar to the Lancia&#x27;s.

===The 1980s: Limited Edition models===
During the early 1980s, Zagato introduced several concept cars, including the Fiat Chicane, the Lancia Thema Station Wagon, the Alfa Romeo Sprint 6, Zeta 6, Alfetta, and 33 Tempo Libero, also available as a 4x4 hybrid. At the same time, the growing demand for exclusive spiders and coupes led Zagato to produce limited, numbered editions. The Aston Martin Vantage (50 units) and Volante Zagato (33 units) were the highest expression of this economic and commercial climate. Furthermore, the Milanese coachbuilder bodied the Maserati Spyder and Maserati Karif. The Alfa Romeo SZ (1989) and RZ roadster (1991) were assembled here for Alfa Romeo, both designed by the first application of the CAD process to automobiles. The SZ was an experimental, rear-wheel drive coupé that recalled Alfa Romeo&#x27;s sporting pedigree established by previous Alfa–Zagato collaborations, including the 1900 SSZ, Giulietta SZ, Alfa Romeo Giulia TZ, Alfa Romeo Giulia TZ2, 2600 SZ, Junior Z, and the Alfa Romeo Zeta 6.

===The 1990s: V-Max models===
To keep up with the new demands of an evolving market, Zagato organized a one-make race series for Alfa Romeo SZ and RZ starting in 1993. The company soon transformed from a coachbuilder for sports cars into a transportation design studio. The company began to create designs for railways and industrial vehicles as well as prototypes and show cars on behalf of car manufacturers.

In 1991 and 1993, the Design Zagato division introduced two Ferrari V-Max models based on the 348 (348 Zagato Elaborazione) and the Testarossa (FZ93). In 1992, as a tribute to the Lancia Delta Integrale victories, the Hyena concept was created, with 24 examples being built. Zagato built the Raptor and the Lamborghini Canto concepts, both powered by a Lamborghini V12 at the request of Mike Kimberley, Lamborghini&#x27;s CEO. Voted &quot;Best Concept&quot; at the 1996 Geneva Motor Show, the Raptor was produced in less than 4 months, thanks to the use of integrated technology applied to the CAD/CAM/CAE system that allowed the intermediate styling buck phase to be eliminated. In 1998, Zagato was commissioned by Fiat to design and produce three V-Max prototypes with low fuel consumption (3 liters/100 kilometers). The Fiat Ecobasic, developed in collaboration with Centro Stile Fiat, was judged to be the best research V-Max concept.

===The 2000s: Custom-built models===
Special projects created for Aston Martin, Bentley, Ferrari, Maserati, Spyker, Diatto, and Alfa Romeo consolidate the brand&#x27;s business in making custom-built models, which are almost exclusively coupés with two seats.

===The 2010s: Centennial models===
The Alfa Romeo TZ3 Corsa, a race model with a carbon fiber mono-shell chassis, tubular frame, and lightweight aluminum body, and the TZ3 Stradale, a street-legal model based on the Viper ACR chassis with a carbon fiber body, were notable developments. Due to the joint venture between the Fiat and the Chrysler groups, the TZ3 Stradale became the first American Alfa Romeo. Following the Fiat 500 Coupé Zagato and AC 378 GTZ, Zagato consolidated its special relationship with Aston Martin by designing the Centennial V-Max models (as a tribute to AML&#x27;s 100 years), the Vanquish Family, and, for the &quot;Cento&quot; years from Zagato&#x27;s foundation, the Pair and the Twins collections. Porsche liaison was also revamped with the family of Zagato Carreras, as well as Lamborghini, Maserati, and BMW connection with the 575, the Mostro, and the BMW Twins collections. Since 2017, Zagato has been a partner in the resurrection of the Italian luxury sport brand Iso Rivolta. 

2019 marked 100 years since Zagato&#x27;s founding.

===The 2020s: Own models===
In the 2020s, Zagato has focused its commitment to production of its own cars, a movement started in 2015 with the Mostro; in 2022, it released a barchetta version of the Mostro, limited to 5 units, and in 2024, announced the AGTZ Twin Tail, based on the Alpine A110, limited to 19 units.

<doc id="733584" wikidata="Q1759775" url="?curid=733584" title="Tartiflette">
<text>Tartiflette () is a dish from Savoy in the French Alps. It is made with potatoes, reblochon cheese, lardons and onions. A splash of white wine can be added too.

The word &quot;tartiflette&quot; is probably derived from the Arpitan word for potato (&quot;tartiflâ&quot;) or from the Savoyard &quot;tartifles&quot;, a term also found in Provençal and Gallo-Italian. This modern recipe was inspired by a traditional dish called péla: a gratin cooked in a long-handled pan called a &quot;pelagic&quot; (shovel).

Often served as an après-ski meal, tartiflette conveys an image of Alpine authenticity and conviviality.

== History ==

As with many traditional dishes in the region, the potato is a staple ingredient. Savoy was historically part of the Holy Roman Empire, and the Savoyards were exposed to potato tubers earlier than the French. Tartiflette was first mentioned in a 1705 book, &quot;Le Cuisinier Royal et Bourgeois&quot;, written by François Massialot and his assistant cook B. Mathieu.

In its modern form, tartiflette began to appear on the menus of restaurants in the ski resorts in the 1980s. Its popularity is partly thanks to the promotional effort by &quot;Le Syndicat Interprofessionnel du Reblochon&quot; to boost the sales of reblochon, as is confirmed also by Christian Millau (of the Gault-Millau Guide) in his gastronomic dictionary.

== Variations ==
A common related dish found throughout the region is the &quot;croziflette&quot;. Its preparation resembles that of the original dish in everything but the use of potatoes, in place of which minuscule squares of locally produced pasta are used. These are known as crozets de Savoie (which are usually made from buckwheat, but sometimes durum), hence the name of this dish, which is a blend of &quot;crozet&quot; and &quot;tartiflette&quot;.

Another related dish is the &quot;morbiflette&quot; prepared with the Morbier cheese in place of the Reblochon.

<doc id="733585" wikidata="Q2849115" url="?curid=733585" title="Andy Flower">
<text>Andrew Flower (born 28 April 1968) is a Zimbabwean cricket coach and a former cricketer. As a cricketer, he captained the Zimbabwe national cricket team and is widely regarded as the greatest Zimbabwean cricketer ever and one of the greatest wicket-keeper-batters of all time. He was Zimbabwe&#x27;s wicket-keeper for more than 10 years and is, statistically, the greatest batsman the country has produced. His highest score in ODI cricket which was his 145 he made against India in the 2002 ICC Champions Trophy is also the highest score made by a Zimbabwe player at any tournaments. During his peak from October to December 2001, Flower was ranked as the best Test batsman in the world. He was widely acknowledged as the only Zimbabwe batsman of proper test quality in any conditions. After retirement, he served as the coach of the English cricket team from 2009 to 2014. Under his coaching, England won the 2010 ICC World Twenty20. Flower became the second foreign coach in the team&#x27;s history. Currently, he is the head coach of Trent Rockets in The Hundred and Royal Challengers Bangalore in the Indian Premier League. 

Under his tenure, Flower led the Multan Sultans to their first playoffs in the 2020 season. The Sultans finished first in the league stage but ultimately lost in the preliminaries. Similarly, he led the Zouks to their first finals appearance in the CPL. Flower served as assistant coach to Kings XI Punjab (now Punjab Kings) for IPL 2020 and 2021 before joining Lucknow Super Giants as the head coach. In June 2021, he was inducted to the ICC Cricket Hall of Fame and became the first Zimbabwean to be inducted into ICC Hall of Fame. In August 2023, he was appointed as the head coach of Royal Challengers Bangalore after his term ended with Lucknow Super Giants.

==Playing career==
Flower was born in Cape Town, South Africa, and starting from his high school days at Oriel Boys&#x27; High School and Vainona High School played most of his career alongside his younger brother Grant Flower. He is considered to be one of the best wicket-keeper batsmen of all time, alongside players such as MS Dhoni, Adam Gilchrist, Kumar Sangakkara and Jeff Dujon. Flower made his international debut in a One Day International against Sri Lanka at New Plymouth, New Zealand, in the 1992 Cricket World Cup. A good player of spin, he made 550 runs in a Test series against India in 2000/01. This tally came in just four innings and he was only dismissed twice. He is one of the few players to score a century on ODI debut and became the first player ever to score a century on ODI debut in a World Cup match.

Flower played 63 Test matches for Zimbabwe, scoring 4,794 runs at an average of 51.54 and taking 151 catches and 9 stumpings, and 213 One Day Internationals, scoring 6,786 runs at an average of 35.34 and taking 141 catches and 32 stumpings. He holds the Zimbabwean records for the most Test career runs, the highest Test batting average, and most ODI career runs. 

His aggregate score of 341 in the first Test against South Africa in 2001 is the second highest ever by a batsman on the losing side.

Andy Flower is also the only player to score an ODI hundred on debut in a world cup match. He also has the record for the most matches (149) to score his second ODI ton after scoring a century on debut, when he did it in only in his 150th ODI.

He also holds the record for the highest ever test score posted by a wicketkeeper batsman in an innings of a test (232*). He is also the first and only wicketkeeper batsman to have a batting average of 50 in test cricket. He along with Heath Streak set the record for the highest 7th wicket partnership for Zimbabwe in ODIs (130)

===Black armband===

Towards the end of his career, Flower achieved international recognition when he and teammate Henry Olonga wore black armbands during the 2003 Cricket World Cup match against Namibia to protest against Robert Mugabe&#x27;s policies. He and Olonga released a statement on 10 February, stating in part:

This act led to pressure from Zimbabwe&#x27;s government, Flower&#x27;s retirement from Zimbabwean cricket and exile from Zimbabwe itself, only briefly returning in 2023 as a commentator during the 2023 Cricket World Cup Qualifier. He later played an English county cricket season for Essex and an Australian domestic season for South Australia.

==Coaching career==

On 7 May 2007, Flower was appointed Assistant Coach of the England team, replacing Matthew Maynard. The Zimbabwean joined up with Peter Moores and the rest of the squad for the first Test match against the West Indies at Lord&#x27;s on 17 May 2007. Upon his appointment to this role with the ECB, Flower, having not played that season due to injury, ended his playing spell at Essex, bringing his playing career to a close.

On 15 April 2009, following England&#x27;s Caribbean tour, for which he was installed as interim team director following the departure of Peter Moores, he was appointed full-time team director. In the Summer of 2009, during his tenure as team director, England won The Ashes, beating Australia by two Test matches to one. In May 2010, they won the 2010 ICC World Twenty20 tournament in the West Indies. In November–January 2010/2011 England won the Ashes in Australia by three Test matches to one.

Flower was appointed Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) in the 2011 Birthday Honours for services to sport.

On 13 August 2011, Flower led the England cricket team to become the number one ranked team in terms of test playing countries. On 22 December 2011, he was awarded the 2011 Coach of the Year in the BBC Sports Personality of the Year awards.

He also successfully led England to Ashes victory in July–August 2013 winning the test series 3–0.
A major blip in his coaching career was the 5–0 drubbing by Australia in November–January 2013 – 2014 Ashes series. On 31 January 2014, Flower stepped down as head coach, a position he had held for five years. From March 2014, he continued his employment with the England and Wales Cricket Board as its &#x27;Technical Director of Elite Coaching&#x27;, a role that has involved mentoring English county coaches and looking at best practice in coaching and performance in other organisations. Since July 2014, this role has also encompassed him being head coach of the England Lions team, most recently leading the side on an ODI tour of the UAE in January 2016. Later in 2016, he was appointed as a batting coach of Peshawar Zalmi.

In 2020, he was appointed as head coach for Multan Sultans, St Lucia Zouks and as Assistant coach for Kings XI Punjab in the IPL. In 2021 he was appointed as the head coach for Lucknow Super Giants.

In July 2022, He was appointed as head coach for Gulf Giants in International League T20. On 4 August 2023, He was appointed as head coach for Royal Challengers Bangalore in Indian Premier League.

==Charity==
In September 2007, Flower became an Ambassador for the children&#x27;s charity, &quot;Hope for Children&quot;, and has assisted in raising thousands of pounds for needy children in Zimbabwe and around the world.
In July 2011, Flower became an Ambassador for the malignant melanoma support group, Melanoma UK, having suffered from the illness himself. He underwent surgery to remove a melanoma from his right eye in 2010. In the summer of 2012, Andy agreed to undertake another term as Ambassador to &quot;Melanoma UK&quot;. Having run the marathon in April 2012 Andy said &quot;It wasn&#x27;t a hard decision for me to continue in my role as Ambassador to &quot;Melanoma UK&quot;. They do an excellent job in patient support, fundraising and raising awareness of the dangers of the sun. I wish them continued success in the coming years and who knows, another marathon might be on the cards!&quot;

==Personal life==
Flower met his wife Rebecca, who is English, when playing in England. They have three children. He has spoken about the adverse impact of time away from his family due to his cricket career.

The &quot;Daily Mirror&quot; reported in 2013 that Flower had become a British citizen.

<text>Ferodo is a British brake company based in Chapel-en-le-Frith in High Peak, Derbyshire.

==History==

It was founded in 1897 by Herbert Frood (1864–1931), with manufacturing starting in Gorton in 1901 and moving to Chapel-en-le-Frith in 1902. Ferodo was the first company to use asbestos for brake linings and developed the first modern brake friction materials.

Ferodo UK became part of Turner &amp; Newall in 1926. It had a factory at Chapel-en-le-Frith and in 1964 opened another at Caernarfon.

In 1998 Turner &amp; Newall was acquired by the huge automotive group Federal-Mogul. It is now part of Federal-Mogul Aftermarket UK Limited. In 2012 £13m was invested in new floors, insulation, low energy heating and new process machines.

On 21 November 1958, Philip, Duke of Edinburgh opened the £750,000 research centre, later visiting Chesterfield College of Technology.

Federal-Mogul got into financial difficulties and filed for Chapter 11 protection as a result of asbestosis claims. In the United Kingdom the business went into administration in October 2001, leaving a pension fund deficit estimated at £400 million.

The T&amp;N Subfund of the Federal-Mogul Asbestos Trust was organized to pay all valid Asbestos Trust claims for which the T&amp;N Entities have legal responsibility. The Trust was created December 27, 2007 as a result of the confirmation of The Federal-Mogul Chapter 11 Joint Plan of Reorganization.

For claimants whose principal exposure to asbestos was in the United Kingdom or one of several other non-US countries, a UK Asbestos Trust was established to provide for the payment of asbestos claims in addition to the US-focused Asbestos Trust described above. This includes posthumous payments to families of Ferodo factory workers.

==Advertising==
Ferodo is famous in Britain for advertising by having the Ferodo brand name painted on railway bridges over main roads.

<text>James Thomas Northrup (November 24, 1939 – June 8, 2011), nicknamed &quot;the Silver Fox&quot; due to his prematurely graying hair, was an American Major League Baseball outfielder and left-handed batter who played for the Detroit Tigers (1964–74), Montreal Expos (1974) and Baltimore Orioles (1974–75).

==Career overview==
Northrup was a good outfielder who played significant percentages of his time in all three outfield positions. Northrup&#x27;s versatility allowed then-manager Mayo Smith to make him the Tigers&#x27; center fielder in the 1968 World Series, as Smith famously moved regular center fielder Mickey Stanley to shortstop to replace the weak-hitting Ray Oyler.

An excellent streak hitter and catalyst for Detroit during the 1960s, Northrup was a power hitter who had good strike-zone judgment and a short, quick stroke. In the field, he had a decent arm, a quick release and good accuracy.

Northrup is best remembered for his contributions to the 1968 Detroit Tigers World Series Championship team. Northrup led the 1968 Tigers in hits and RBIs, hit five grand slams, broke up three no-hitters, and had the game-winning triple off Bob Gibson in Game 7 of the 1968 World Series.

In his 12-year major league career Northrup batted .267 (1254-for-4692), with 153 home runs, 610 RBIs, 603 runs, 218 doubles, 42 triples, 39 stolen bases and 449 bases on balls in 1392 games. Defensively, he recorded a .981 fielding percentage playing at all three outfield positions and first base. In 12 postseason games, he batted .286 (12-for-42) with 4 runs, 1 triple, 2 home runs, 9 RBI and 3 walks.

==Early years==
Northrup was born in Breckenridge, Michigan, a small farm town 25 miles west of Saginaw. Northrup grew up on his grandfather&#x27;s farm. Even after the family moved six miles away to St. Louis, Northrup spent his summers and weekends during the winter at his grandparents&#x27; farm.

Once a year, Northrup and his father would make a seven-hour drive (before the expressways) to Detroit when the Boston Red Sox came to town. Ted Williams was Northrup&#x27;s idol, the &quot;only idol I&#x27;ve ever had.&quot; Northrup, however, never saw a complete game as a boy. Rather than pay full price, his father would &quot;wait until the sixth or seventh inning, because then you could give the guy outside a buck or two and you could go out there and watch Ted play.&quot;

After graduating from the St. Louis High School, Northrup stayed close to home for college, attending Alma College, five miles from St. Louis. At Alma, Northrup was a five-sport star. He was quarterback of the football team, and was named a small college All-American. He was a forward on the basketball team, ran track, and golfed, but Northrup&#x27;s great love was baseball. &quot;I was born to play baseball&quot;, said Northrup.

Northrup reportedly turned down offers from the Chicago Bears and the New York Titans and signed with the Tigers in 1961. Northrup spent four years in the minor leagues (1961–1964), playing for the Duluth–Superior Dukes, Decatur Commodores, Tennessee Smokies, and Syracuse Chiefs. He was the International League Rookie of the Year in 1964, as he hit .312 with 18 home runs and 92 RBIs.

==Detroit Tigers (1964–74)==

===1964-67===
Northrup was called up to the Tigers during the last week of the 1964 season, getting one hit in 12 at-bats. In 1965, Northrup had a .205 batting average as he appeared in 54 games in the Detroit outfield, competing for playing time with Al Kaline, Don Demeter, Gates Brown, and fellow rookie Willie Horton. In 1966, Northrup won a spot as the Tigers starting right fielder, as Kaline moved to center field. Northrup finally showed his abilities as a batter, as he hit 24 doubles, 16 home runs, and ended the season with a .465 slugging percentage. In 1967, competition for a spot in the Detroit outfield intensified as Mickey Stanley proved to be an exceptional defensive player. Northrup played 143 games in the outfield, playing 65 games in left, 94 games in center, and 39 games in right.

===1968===

Northrup had his most satisfying season in 1968 as he played a key role in the Tigers&#x27; World Series Championship. Northrup played 151 games at all three spots in the Detroit outfield in 1968, including 103 games in right field, many in place of the injured Al Kaline. Northrup had a range factor of 2.17 – well above the league average of 1.80.

But Northrup&#x27;s principal value was as a batter. In a year marked by dominant pitching throughout the league, Northrup hit 21 home runs and led the 1968 Tigers in hits (153) and RBIs (90). He was among the American League leaders with 90 RBIs (3rd in the AL), 57 extra base hits (4th in the AL), 259 total bases (5th in the AL), and 29 doubles (5th in the AL).

Northrup played in a rotation of four players at the three outfield positions, with Willie Horton, Mickey Stanley, and Al Kaline being the others. However, for the World Series, Detroit manager Mayo Smith decided to bring Stanley in from the outfield to play shortstop, giving the Tigers a firm outfield of Horton (left field), Northrup (center field), and Kaline (right field) in all seven of the games.

Northrup also hit five grand slams during the 1968 season, four in the regular season. The first came in May. Then, on June 24, 1968, Northrup hit grand slams on consecutive pitches in consecutive at bats in the 5th and 6th innings. This made him one of only 13 players (through July 28, 2009) to have hit 2 grand slams in one game, and the second to do so in consecutive at-bats (the first was Jim Gentile in 1961). Five days later, Northrup hit another grand slam, becoming the first major league player to hit three grand slams in a single week. Larry Parrish later accomplished the same feat in 1982, however, Northrup hit his three slams in only 14 plate appearances, setting a record that still stands Northrup&#x27;s fifth grand slam came in Game 6 of the 1968 World Series, fueling a 13-1 blowout win for Detroit.

In addition to his grand slam in Game 6, Northrup had the key hit in Game 7 off St. Louis Cardinals ace Bob Gibson. After striking out 17 batters in Game 1, and pitching a complete game victory in Game 4, Gibson held the Tigers scoreless through the first six innings of Game 7. Northrup, who had a solo home run against Gibson in Game 4 to account for the Tigers only run off the ace thus far in the Series, came to bat with two men on and two outs in the 7th inning. Northrup hit a triple over center fielder Curt Flood&#x27;s head, as Norm Cash and Willie Horton both scored. Bill Freehan followed with a double to score Northrup, and the Tigers won Game 7 to become World Series Champions.

Curt Flood, normally a superb defensive outfielder, was tagged a &quot;goat&quot; for having misplayed Northrup&#x27;s Game 7 triple. But Northrup defended Flood: &quot;He slipped a little, but it still went 40 feet over his head. . . . He never had a chance to catch it.&quot;

Northrup played all 7 games of the 1968 World Series, with a .536 slugging percentage, 8 RBIs, 7 hits, 4 runs scored, and 2 home runs. In a 2001 interview, Northrup concluded: &quot;Winning the World Series had to be the highlight of my baseball career.&quot; Northrup placed 13th in the 1968 American League Most Valuable Player voting.

===1969–74===

Northrup had another solid season for the Tigers in 1969, as he raised his batting average to .295 (9th in the AL) and had career highs with 25 home runs and 31 doubles (6th in the AL). On August 28, 1969, Northrup became the first Tiger since Ty Cobb to hit 6-for-6, finishing the game with a 13th-inning game-winning home run over the Tiger Stadium roof.

In 1970, the Tigers dropped to 4th place in their last season under manager Mayo Smith. The Tigers were an aging squad when Billy Martin took over, and Martin sought to light a fire under them. Though Martin turned the Tigers back into contenders in 1971 and 1972, Northrup chafed at Martin&#x27;s tactics. Northrup noted: &quot;We got sick and tired of reading Martin say in the papers, &#x27;I manage good, and they play bad.&#x27; &#x27;I&#x27;d like to bunt, but my players can&#x27;t do it.&#x27; . . . It was all, &#x27;I, I, I,&#x27; and &#x27;Me, me, me.&#x27; I did not respect him in any way . . .&quot;

In the decisive 5th game of the 1972 American League Championship Series, the mutual dislike between Martin and Northrup may have affected Martin&#x27;s judgment. In the 9th inning, the Tigers were trailing 2–1, and Norm Cash was on base. Northrup had one hit already off Vida Blue, but Martin used Mickey Stanley to pinch-hit for Northrup. Stanley hit into a fielder&#x27;s choice, and the Tigers lost the ALCS. Northrup remained bitter about Martin&#x27;s decision: &quot;Who knows why Martin did what he did? I will say this: Billy Martin put most of us in a frame of mind where he took the fun out of the game.&quot;

In 1973, a 33-year-old Northrup hit .307 –- the highest batting average of his career. Despite his solid hitting, Martin kept Northup on the bench for part of the year. Northrup had played in at least 130 games for the Tigers for 7 straight years, but in 1973 he played in only 119 games. Martin was fired by the Tigers before the 1973 season was over, but Northrup&#x27;s time with the Tigers was also nearing an end.

==Montreal Expos and Baltimore Orioles (1974–75)==

In August 1974, the Tigers sold Northrup to the Montreal Expos. Northrup played in only 21 games for the Expos before being traded to the Baltimore Orioles in September. Northrup finished his career in 1975 hitting .274 in 84 games for the Orioles. Northrup retired after the 1975 season. He later noted: &quot;I&#x27;d had enough. I&#x27;d been away from home too much, and I wasn&#x27;t with my kids enough. So that was the end of it.&quot;

Northrup earned $76,000 a year with the Tigers in 1973. Northrup calculated that he earned $418,000 in his 12-year career in the major leagues.

==Life after the Major Leagues==

After retiring from baseball, Northrup signed with the Detroit Caesars, a professional softball team, and played two seasons (1977–1978). The Caesars played in the American Professional Slow Pitch Softball League (APSPL), winning league titles in both seasons with Northrup. The team was owned by Mike Ilitch who would later become the owner of the Detroit Tigers. The Caesars had extensive talent from the amateur softball leagues and both Northrup and fellow former-Tiger Norm Cash played part-time and promotional roles.

From 1985 to 1994, Northrup was a color analyst for the Tigers on the PASS Sports cable television service. He was the CEO of Jim Northrup and Associates, a manufacturer&#x27;s representative firm in Southfield, Michigan. He was inducted in the Michigan Sports Hall of Fame (2000), and also has been a supporter of many college activities.

==Death==

Northrup died on June 8, 2011, from a seizure. Longtime friend Bill Wischman said Northrup had been recently admitted to an assisted living facility in Holly, Michigan, 20 miles from his home in Highland. Northrup had been in poor health for some time and had been at the home for about a month because of Alzheimer&#x27;s disease. In addition to having Alzheimer&#x27;s, Northrup also battled rheumatoid arthritis for many years, Wischman said. &quot;As ill as he was, he never complained&quot;, the friend said. Northrup was survived by his wife Patty; children Kamil, Azaria, Jim, Paige and Kate; and seven grandchildren.

<text>The Colonial Revival architectural style seeks to revive elements of American colonial architecture.

The beginnings of the Colonial Revival style are often attributed to the Centennial Exhibition of 1876, which reawakened Americans to the architectural traditions of their colonial past. Fairly small numbers of Colonial Revival homes were built –1910, a period when Queen Anne-style architecture was dominant in the United States. From 1910–1930, the Colonial Revival movement was ascendant, with about 40% of U.S. homes built in the Colonial Revival style. In the immediate post-war period (–early 1960s), Colonial Revival homes continued to be constructed, but in simplified form. In the present-day, many New Traditional homes draw from Colonial Revival styles.

Although associated with the architectural movement, &quot;Colonial Revival&quot; also refers to historic preservation, landscape architecture and garden design, and decorative arts movements that emulate or draw inspiration from colonial forms.

== Characteristics ==
While the dominant influences in Colonial Revival style are Georgian and Federal architecture, Colonial Revival homes also draw, to a lesser extent, from the Dutch Colonial style and post-medieval English styles. Colonial Revival homes are often eclectic in style, combining aspects from several of these previous styles.

Since Colonial Revival architecture pulls structural and decorative elements from other styles, there is not one single combination of elements that defines the style. However, some commonly found characteristics of Colonial Revival buildings include:

* Gabled, hipped, or gambrel roofs
* Broken pediments
* Symmetrical facades
* Double hung windows and shutters
* Fanlights and sidelights

Cyril M. Harris&#x27;s &quot;American Architecture: An Illustrated Book&quot; noted that &quot;Colonial Revival houses are usually the result of a rather free interpretation of their prototypes; they tend to be larger, may differ significantly from the houses they seek to emulate, and often exaggerate architectural details.&quot;

<doc id="733609" wikidata="Q1752675" url="?curid=733609" title="Harlan County, USA">
<text>Harlan County USA (variously written with and without a comma) is a 1976 American documentary film covering the &quot;Brookside Strike&quot;, a 1973 effort of 180 coal miners and their wives against the Duke Power Company-owned Eastover Coal Company&#x27;s Brookside Mine and Prep Plant in Harlan County, southeast Kentucky. It won the Academy Award for Best Documentary at the 49th Academy Awards.

It was directed and produced by filmmaker Barbara Kopple, then early in her filmmaking career. A former VISTA volunteer, she had worked on other documentaries, especially as an advocate of workers&#x27; rights.

==Synopsis==
Kopple initially intended to make a film about Kenzie, Miners for Democracy and the attempt to unseat Tony Boyle as president of the UMWA. When miners at the Brookside Mine in Harlan County, Kentucky, went on strike against Duke Power Company in June 1973, Kopple went there to film the strike, which the UMWA had helped to organize. She decided it was the more compelling subject, so switched the focus of her film. In all, she worked on the film for four years, including preparation and editing.

When Kopple and her cameraman Hart Perry showed up on the picket line, the locals were suspicious of their intentions. Rumors flew that a &quot;hippie crew from New York&quot; was sniffing around the strike. When she confronted a striker who told people not to talk to her, she was told: &quot;Girl, you gotta tell people here what you&#x27;re doin&#x27;.&quot;

Kopple and her crew spent years with the families depicted in the film, documenting the dire straits they encountered while striking for safer working conditions, fair labor practices, and decent wages. She followed them to picket in front of the Stock Exchange in New York City, filming interviews with people affected by black lung disease, and miners being shot at while striking.

The company insisted on having a no-strike clause in the proposed new contract. The miners were concerned that accepting such a provision would limit their ability to influence local working conditions. This sticking point became moot when, a few years after the strike, the UMWA folded the agreement won by this group of workers into a global contract.

Rather than using narration to tell the story, Kopple chose to film the words and actions of the people themselves. For example, when the strike breakers and others hired by the company show up early in the film—the strikers call them &quot;gun thugs&quot;—the company people tried to keep their guns hidden from the camera. As the strike dragged on for nearly a year, both sides eventually openly brandished their weapons. Kopple felt it was important to continue filming (or pretend to, even when they were out of film) because the presence of the crew and staff support seemed to help keep the violence down.

Kopple did provide facts and statistics about the companies and the workers. She notes that Duke Power Company&#x27;s profits increased 170 percent in a single year. Meanwhile, the striking miners, many of whom are living in squalid conditions without utilities or running water, were offered a 4% pay increase, at a time when the estimated cost of living increase was 7% for that same year.

Joseph Yablonski was a passionate, populistic union representative who was loved by many of the miners. Yablonski had challenged W.A. &quot;Tony&quot; Boyle for the presidency of the UMWA in 1969, but lost in an election widely viewed as corrupt. Later that year, Yablonski and his family were found murdered in their home. Early in the film, Boyle is shown in good health. Later, after he was convicted of giving $20,000 to another union executive council member to hire the killers of Yablonski and his wife, Boyle appears frail, sickly and using a wheelchair; he was carried up the courthouse steps to face sentencing.

Almost a full year into the strike, miner Lawrence Jones was fatally shot during a scuffle. Jones was young, well liked, had a 16-year-old wife, and an infant baby. In the documentary, his mother can be seen breaking down during his funeral, wailing and being carried away by male attendees. The strikers and management finally agreed to come to the bargaining table after his death.

Lois Scott, a leading woman in the mining community, is shown playing a major role in galvanizing the people in support of the strike. Several times, she is seen publicly chastising those she feels have been absent from the picket lines. In one scene, Scott pulls a pistol from her bra.

* &quot;They&#x27;ll Never Keep Us Down&quot;, written and sung by Hazel Dickens, accompanied by Lamar Grier, John Katarakis, John Otsuka, and Gary Henderson

==Reception==

===Critical response===
Gary Arnold of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; praised the film, saying that Kopple &quot;has emerged with a stirring, revealing testament to the courage, tenacity and dignity of Appalachian men and women whose livelihood depends on coal mining. At their best Kopple and photographer Hart Perry bear unassuming, expressive witness to the experiences, aspirations and abiding grievances of the Brookside miners and their wives, who organized auxiliary strike actions.&quot;

When the film was re-released in 2006, critic Roger Ebert praised the film, writing &quot;The film retains all of its power, in the story of a miners&#x27; strike in Kentucky where the company employed armed goons to escort scabs into the mines, and the most effective picketers were the miners&#x27; wives -- articulate, indomitable, courageous. It contains a famous scene where guns are fired at the strikers in the darkness before dawn, and Kopple and her cameraman are knocked down and beaten.&quot;

Film critic Dennis Schwartz liked the documentary, yet found flaw in it providing only one point of view. He described the film as &quot;One of the better and more rousing labor strike films that calls attention to class war in America, though it doesn&#x27;t offer enough analysis or balance on the issues (it sees the struggle solely through the miners&#x27; eyes)...The film does a good job chronicling the plight of the miners and telling their personal stories in a moving way, and the meaningful catchy coal mining songs add to the emotional impact of the historical event. Hazel Dickens&#x27;s folk song lyrics of &#x27;United we stand, divided we fall&#x27; and Florence Reece&#x27;s lyrics for &quot;Which Side Are You On?&quot; give one the full-flavor of the miners&#x27; mood and the union fervor sweeping the mining community in the black mountains of Appalachia.&quot;

The film received a 100% rating on &quot;Rotten Tomatoes,&quot; the aggregator site.

===Awards===
;Wins
* Academy Awards: Academy Award for Best Documentary Feature, 1976
* Los Angeles Film Critics Association: Special Award, 1977
* Belgian Film Critics Association: Grand Prix, 1979

===Other distinctions===
* In 1990, the film was selected for the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant.&quot;
* In 2014, &quot;Sight and Sound&quot; published a list of Greatest Documentaries of All Time, and &quot;Harlan County, USA&quot; was ranked 24th, tied with two other movies.

==Preservation==
&quot;Harlan County, USA&quot; was preserved by the Academy Film Archive, in conjunction with New York Women in Film &amp; Television, in 2004.

==Extras on Criterion Collection==
In the film&#x27;s 2004 Criterion Collection special feature, &quot;The Making of Harlan County, USA&quot;, associate director Anne Lewis compares Scott to Women&#x27;s Liberation activists. Jerry Johnson, one of the striking Eastover miners, attributes the conclusion of the strike to the presence of Kopple and her film crew: &quot;The cameras probably saved a bunch of shooting. I don&#x27;t think we&#x27;d have won it without the film crew. If the film crew hadn&#x27;t been sympathetic to our cause, we would&#x27;ve lost. Thank God for them; thank God they&#x27;re on our side.&quot;

==Notes==
In a 2015 interview with &quot;Variety&quot;, Kopple was asked if she was in danger while working on this film. She reveals that the head strikebreaker, Basil Collins, wanted to hire someone to shoot her; however, the most dangerous incidents were the acts of violence by the mine owners against the miners. She said that the mine owners would hire &quot;local prisoners to beat people up, [shoot] at houses. The people had to line their walls with mattresses.&quot;

<text>Owen Lattimore (July 29, 1900 – May 31, 1989) was an American Orientalist and writer. He was an influential scholar of China and Central Asia, especially Mongolia. Although he never earned a college degree, in the 1930s he was editor of &quot;Pacific Affairs&quot;, a journal published by the Institute of Pacific Relations, and taught at Johns Hopkins University from 1938 to 1963. He was director of the Walter Hines Page School of International Relations from 1939 to 1953. During World War II, he was an advisor to Chiang Kai-shek and the American government and contributed extensively to the public debate on U.S. policy toward Asia. From 1963 to 1970, Lattimore was the first Professor of Chinese Studies at the University of Leeds in England.

In the early post-war period of McCarthyism and the Red Scare, American wartime &quot;China Hands&quot; were accused of being agents of the Soviet Union or under the influence of Marxism. In 1950, Senator Joseph McCarthy accused Lattimore in particular of being &quot;the top Russian espionage agent in the United States.&quot; The accusations led to years of Congressional hearings that did not substantiate the charge that Lattimore had been a spy. Soviet Venona cables, decoded during WWII and declassified decades later, did not refer to Lattimore as one of the Soviet agents active in the US. The hearings did document Lattimore&#x27;s sympathetic statements about Stalin and the Soviet Union, however. In 1988 Chen Han-shen, a member of the Sorge spy ring, mentioned in his memoirs that Lattimore placed a request for a Chinese assistant through Comintern channels. Chen’s superiors dispatched him to the United States in 1936 to serve as Lattimore’s coeditor at Pacific Affairs, a position Chen used to carry out espionage activities in New York, with the help of another agent, Rao Shu-shi. The controversy put an end to Lattimore&#x27;s role as a consultant of the U.S. State Department and eventually to his academic career. He died in 1989 in Providence, Rhode Island, having resided in his later years in Pawtucket.

Lattimore&#x27;s &quot;lifetime intellectual project&quot;, notes one recent scholar, was to &quot;develop a &#x27;scientific&#x27; model of the way human societies form, evolve, grow, decline, mutate and interact with one another along &#x27;frontiers&#x27;.&quot; He eclectically absorbed and often abandoned influential theories of his day that dealt with the great themes of history. These included the ecological determinism of Ellsworth Huntington; biological racism, though only to the extent of seeing characteristics which grew out of ecology; the economic geography and location theory; and some aspects of Marxist modes of production and stages of history, especially through the influence of Karl August Wittfogel. The most important and lasting influence, however, was Arnold J. Toynbee and his treatment of the great civilizations as organic wholes which were born, matured, grew old, and died. Lattimore&#x27;s most influential book, &quot;The Inner Asian Frontiers of China&quot; (1940), used these theories to explain the history of East Asia not as the history of China and its influence on its neighbors, but as the interaction between two types of civilizations, settled farming and pastoral, each of which had its role in changing the other.

==Early life and travel==
Born in the United States, Lattimore was raised in Tianjin, China, where his parents, David and Margaret Lattimore, were English teachers at a Chinese university. (His brother was the poet and classics scholar and translator Richmond Lattimore. One of his sisters was author Eleanor Frances Lattimore.)

After being schooled at home by his mother, he left China at the age of twelve and attended Collège Classique Cantonal near Lausanne, Switzerland. After war broke out in 1914, he was sent to England, where he was enrolled at St Bees School, Cumbria, England (1915–1919). He pursued literary interests, especially poetry, and briefly converted to Catholicism. He did well on the entrance exams for Oxford University, but returned to China in 1919 when it turned out that he would not have enough funds for attending university.

He worked first for a newspaper and then for a British import/export related business. This gave him the opportunity to travel extensively in China and time to study Chinese with an old-fashioned Confucian scholar. His commercial travels also gave him a feel for the realities of life and the economy. A turning point was negotiating the passage of a trainload of wool through the lines of two battling warlords early in 1925, an experience which led him the next year to follow the caravans across Inner Mongolia to the end of the line in Xinjiang.

The managers of his firm saw no advantage in subsidizing his travels but did send him to spend a final year of employment with them in Beijing as government liaison. During this year in Beijing before departing on his expedition, he met his wife, Eleanor Holgate. For their honeymoon they planned to travel from Beijing to India, he overland, she by rail across Siberia, a mammoth feat in the first half of the 20th century. In the event, the plans were disrupted and she had to travel alone by horse-drawn sled for in February to find him. She described her journey in &quot;Turkestan Reunion&quot; (1934), he in &quot;The Desert Road to Turkestan&quot; (1928) and &quot;High Tartary&quot; (1930). This trip laid the ground for his lifelong interest in all matters related to the Mongols and other peoples of the Silk Road.

Upon his return to America in 1928, he received a fellowship from the Social Science Research Council for further travel in Manchuria, then for the academic year 1928/1929 as a student at Harvard University. He did not, however, enroll in a doctoral program, but returned to China 1930–1933 with fellowships from the Harvard–Yenching Institute and the John Simon Guggenheim Memorial Foundation.

He was awarded the Patron&#x27;s Medal by the British Royal Geographical Society in 1942 for his travels in Central Asia. In 1943, he was elected to the American Philosophical Society.

==&quot;Pacific Affairs&quot; and the Institute of Pacific Relations==

In 1934, on the recommendation of treaty port journalist H.G.E. Woodhead, Lattimore was appointed editor of &quot;Pacific Affairs&quot;, published by the Institute of Pacific Relations, which he edited from Beijing. Rather than have bland official statements, he made it his policy to make the journal a &quot;forum of controversy&quot;. As he later recalled, he was &quot;continually in hot water, especially with the Japan Council, which thought I was too anti-imperialist, and the Soviet Council, which thought that its own anti-imperialist line was the only permissible one...&quot; As explained below, others later accused him of motives which were less scholarly than political. Lattimore sought articles from a wide range of perspectives and made the journal a forum for new ideas, especially from the social sciences and social philosophy. Scholars and writers of all persuasions were contributors, including Pearl S. Buck, some Chinese literary figures, and dedicated Marxists.

IPR secretary Edward Carter was eager to solicit the participation of Soviet scholars, and insisted that Lattimore meet him in Moscow on his way back to the States. Lattimore had never been to the Soviet Union, having been denied a visa, and felt eager to obtain contributions from Soviet scholars, who had a distinguished tradition in Central Asian studies. But he was also wary because of the attacks Soviet scholars had made on him – Lattimore&#x27;s &quot;scholasticism is similar to Hamlet&#x27;s madness&quot; – and for publishing an article by Harold Isaacs, who they considered a Trotskyite. The Lattimores spent two weeks on the Trans-Siberian Railroad with their five-year-old son before arriving in Moscow for a two-week stay toward the end of March 1936. Soviet officials coldly demanded that the IPR and its journal support collective security arrangements against Japan. Lattimore responded that &quot;Pacific Affairs&quot; had the obligation to serve all the national councils, even the Japanese, and could not take political sides. Lattimore&#x27;s request to visit the Mongolian People&#x27;s Republic was denied on the grounds that &quot;Mongolia now is constantly ready for war and conditions are very unstable.&quot; And in the end, Soviet scholars sent only one article to &quot;Pacific Affairs&quot;.

After sojourns in New York and London, the Lattimores returned to Beijing in 1937. Owen visited the Communist headquarters at Yan&#x27;an to act as translator for T. A. Bisson and Philip Jaffé, who were gathering material for &quot;Amerasia&quot;, an activist journal of political commentary. There he met Mao Zedong and Zhou Enlai. He was impressed with their candor, but had a less favorable experience on his visit to the party school for national minorities. When he spoke to the Mongols in Mongolian, his Chinese hosts broke off the session.

The Lattimores left China in 1938. Owen spent six months in Berkeley, California, writing a draft of the &quot;Inner Asian Frontiers of China&quot; and continuing as editor of &quot;Pacific Affairs&quot;. As editor, he then made what Robert Newman, a sympathetic biographer, called &quot;the most serious error of his career.&quot; Lattimore published an article by a pro-Soviet writer, whom Lattimore did not know, praising Stalin&#x27;s purge trials because they strengthened the Soviet Union for the coming battle against Germany and Japan. Lattimore famously stated that the show trials &quot;sound to me like democracy&quot;. Lattimore&#x27;s misjudgment of the purge trials was undoubtedly influenced by his generally favorable evaluation of Soviet foreign policy, which emphasized international cooperation against Japan and Germany and his judgment that the Soviets had been supportive of Mongol autonomy. He was &quot;nonetheless wrong,&quot; Newman concluded.

He also soon wrote prominently against allowing Soviet expansion into China. As editor of &quot;Pacific Affairs&quot; he was expected to maintain a balance, but writing in another journal in the spring of 1940 he urged that &quot;Above all, while we want to get Japan out of China, we do not want to let Russia in. Nor do we want to &#x27;drive Japan into the arms of Russia.&#x27;&quot; He continued: &quot;the savagery of the Japanese assault is doing more to spread Communism than the teaching of the Chinese Communists themselves or the influences of Russia. It supplies the pressure under which the detonative ideas can work. At the same time it destroys Chinese wealth of every kindcapital, trade, revenue from agricultural rentthus weakening that side of Chinese society which is most antagonistic to Communism.&quot;

The &quot;Middlesboro Daily News&quot; ran an article by Owen Lattimore which reported on Japan&#x27;s planned offensive into a Hui Muslim region of China in 1938, which predicted that the Japanese would suffer a massive crushing defeat at the hands of the Muslims. In 1940, the Japanese were crushed and routed by the Muslims at the Battle of West Suiyuan. The Japanese planned to invade Ningxia from Suiyuan in 1939 and create a Hui Muslim puppet state. The following year in 1940, the Japanese were defeated militarily by the Kuomintang Muslim General Ma Hongbin, who caused the plan to collapse. Ma Hongbin&#x27;s Hui Muslim troops launched further attacks against Japan in the Battle of West Suiyuan. In Suiyuan 300 Mongol collaborators serving the Japanese were fought off by a single Muslim who held the rank of Major at the Battle of Wulan Obo in 1939 April.

==World War II==
Following the German invasion of the Soviet Union in June 1941, President Franklin D. Roosevelt appointed Lattimore to serve as US advisor to Chinese Nationalist leader Chiang Kai-shek for one and a half years. Lattimore advocated on behalf of the ethnic minorities in China, arguing that China should adopt a cultural autonomy policy based on the Soviet Union&#x27;s minority policy, which he regarded as &quot;one of the most successful Soviet policies.&quot; His advice was mostly disregarded by Chiang&#x27;s officials, as defense secretary Wang Ch&#x27;ung-hui suspected Lattimore of understating Soviet interference in Xinjiang and Outer Mongolia. 

In 1944, Lattimore was placed in charge of the Pacific area for the Office of War Information. By this time, Lattimore&#x27;s political activities and associations had been under scrutiny for the last two years by the FBI, which recommended Lattimore be put under &quot;Custodial Detention in case of National Emergency&quot;.

At President Roosevelt&#x27;s request, he accompanied U.S. Vice-President Henry A. Wallace on a mission to Siberia, China, and Mongolia in 1944 for the U.S. Office of War Information. The trip had been arranged by Lauchlin Currie, who recommended to FDR that Lattimore accompany Wallace. During this visit, which overlapped the D-Day landings, Wallace and his delegates stayed 25 days in Siberia and were given a tour of the Soviet Union&#x27;s Magadan Gulag camp at Kolyma. In a travelogue for &quot;National Geographic&quot;, Lattimore described what little he saw as a combination of the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company and the Tennessee Valley Authority, remarking on how strong and well-fed the inmates were and ascribing to camp commandant Ivan Nikishov &quot;a trained and sensitive interest in art and music and also a deep sense of civic responsibility&quot;. In a letter written to the &quot;New Statesman&quot; in 1968, Lattimore justified himself by arguing his role had not been one to &quot;snoop on his hosts.&quot; (In contrast, camp commander Naftaly Frenkel explained: &quot;We have to squeeze everything out of a prisoner in the first three months – after that we don&#x27;t need him anymore.&quot; The system of hard labor and minimal or no food reduced most prisoners to helpless &quot;goners&quot; (&quot;dokhodyaga&quot;, in Russian). Conditions varied depending on the state of the country.)

During the 1940s, Lattimore came into increasing conflict with another member of the IPR&#x27;s board, Alfred Kohlberg, a manufacturer with long experience in the China trade whose visit to China in 1943 convinced him that stories of Chiang Kai-shek&#x27;s corruption were false. He accused Lattimore of being hostile to Chiang and too sympathetic towards the Chinese Communist Party. 

In 1944, relations between Kohlberg and Lattimore became so bad that Kohlberg left the IPR and founded a new journal, &quot;Plain Talk&quot;, in which he attempted to rebut the claims made in &quot;Pacific Affairs&quot;. By the late 1940s, Lattimore had become a particular target of Kohlberg and other members of the China Lobby. Kohlberg was later to become an advisor to Senator Joseph McCarthy, and it is possible that McCarthy first learned of Lattimore&#x27;s communist tendencies through Kohlberg.

==Accused of espionage==
Meanwhile, accusations were made, which later became public. On 14 December 1948, Alexander Barmine, former &quot;chargé d&#x27;affaires&quot; at the Soviet Embassy in Athens, Greece, advised Federal Bureau of Investigation agents that Soviet GRU Director Yan Karlovich Berzin had informed him prior to Barmine&#x27;s 1937 defection that Lattimore was a Soviet agent, an allegation Barmine would repeat under oath before the Senate McCarran Committee in 1951.

==Congressional investigation==

In March 1950, in executive session of the Tydings Committee, Senator Joseph McCarthy accused Lattimore of being the top Soviet agent, either in the US, in the State Department, or both. The committee, chaired by Senator Millard Tydings, was investigating McCarthy&#x27;s claims of widespread Soviet infiltration of the State Department. When the accusation was leaked to the press, McCarthy backed off from the charge that Lattimore was a spy but continued the attack in public session of the committee and in speeches.

Lattimore, he said, &quot;in view of his position of tremendous power at the State Department&quot; was the &quot;&#x27;architect&#x27; of our Far Eastern policy&quot; and asked whether Lattimore&#x27;s &quot;aims are American aims or whether they coincide with the aims of Soviet Russia.&quot; At the time, Lattimore was in Kabul, Afghanistan, on a cultural mission for the United Nations. Lattimore dismissed the charges against him as &quot;moonshine&quot; and hurried back to the United States to testify before the Tydings Committee.

McCarthy, who had no evidence of specific acts of espionage and only weak evidence that Lattimore was a concealed Communist, in April 1950 persuaded Louis F. Budenz, the now-anticommunist former editor of the Communist Party organ &quot;Daily Worker,&quot; to testify. Budenz had no first-hand knowledge of Lattimore&#x27;s Communist allegiance and had never previously identified him as a Communist in his extensive FBI interviews. In addition, Budenz had in 1947 told a State Department investigator that he &quot;did not recall any instances&quot; that suggested that Lattimore was a Communist and had also told his editor at &quot;Collier&#x27;s&quot; magazine in 1949 that Lattimore had never &quot;acted as a Communist in any way.&quot;

Now, however, Budenz testified that Lattimore was a secret Communist but not a Soviet agent; he was a person of influence who often assisted Soviet foreign policy. Budenz said his party superiors had told him that Lattimore&#x27;s &quot;great value lay in the fact that he could bring the emphasis in support of Soviet policy in non-Soviet language.&quot; The majority report of the Tydings committee cleared Lattimore of all charges against him; the minority report accepted Budenz&#x27;s charges.

In February 1952, Lattimore was called to testify before the Senate Internal Security Subcommittee (SISS), headed by McCarthy&#x27;s ally, Senator Pat McCarran. Before Lattimore was called as witness, investigators for the SISS had seized all of the records of the Institute of Pacific Relations (IPR). The twelve days of testimony were marked by shouting matches, which pitted McCarran and McCarthy on one side against Lattimore on the other. Lattimore took three days to deliver his opening statement: the delays were caused by frequent interruptions as McCarran challenged Lattimore point by point. McCarran then used the records from the IPR to ask questions that often taxed Lattimore&#x27;s memory. Budenz again testified, but this time claimed that Lattimore was both a Communist and a Soviet agent.

The subcommittee also summoned scholars. Nicholas Poppe, a Russian émigré and a scholar of Mongolia and Tibet, resisted the committee&#x27;s invitation to label Lattimore a Communist but found some of his writings superficial and uncritical. The most damaging testimony came from Karl August Wittfogel, supported by his colleague from the University of Washington, George Taylor. Wittfogel, a former Communist, said that at the time Lattimore edited the journal &quot;Pacific Affairs&quot;, Lattimore knew of his Communist background; even though they had not exchanged words on the matter, Lattimore had given Wittfogel a &quot;knowing smile.&quot;

Lattimore acknowledged that Wittfogel&#x27;s thought had been tremendously influential but said that if there had been a smile, it was a &quot;non-Communist smile&quot;. Wittfogel and Taylor charged that Lattimore had done &quot;great harm to the free world&quot; in disregarding the need to defeat world Communism as a first priority. John K. Fairbank, in his memoirs, suggests that Wittfogel may have said this because he had been made to leave Germany for having views unacceptable to the powers that be, and he did not want to make the same mistake twice. They also asserted that the influence of Marxism on Lattimore was shown by his use of the word &quot;feudal.&quot; Lattimore replied that he did not think that Marxists had a &quot;patent&quot; on that word.

In 1952, after 17 months of study and hearing, involving 66 witnesses and thousands of documents, the McCarran Committee issued its 226-page, unanimous final report. This report stated that &quot;Owen Lattimore was, from some time beginning in the 1930s, a conscious articulate instrument of the Soviet conspiracy,&quot; and that on &quot;at least five separate matters,&quot; Lattimore had not told the whole truth. One example: &quot;The evidence... shows conclusively that Lattimore knew Frederick V. Field to be a Communist; that he collaborated with Field after he possessed this knowledge; and that he did not tell the truth before the subcommittee about this association with Field...&quot;

On December 16, 1952, Lattimore was indicted for perjury on seven counts. Six of the counts related to various discrepancies between Lattimore&#x27;s testimony and the IPR records; the seventh accused Lattimore of seeking to deliberately deceive the SISS. Lattimore&#x27;s defenders, such as his lawyer Abe Fortas, claimed that the discrepancies were caused by McCarran deliberately asking questions about arcane and obscure matters that took place in the 1930s.

Within three years, federal judge Luther Youngdahl dismissed the perjury charges on technical grounds. United States v. Lattimore, 127 F. Supp. 405 (D.D.C. 1955).

Four of the charges were dismissed as insubstantial and not judicable; denying that he was sympathetic to communism was too vague to be fairly answered; and the other counts were matters of little concern, those for which a jury would be unlikely to convict on matters of political judgment. In his book &quot;Ordeal by Slander&quot;, Lattimore gives his own account of these events up until 1950.

In his 1979 memoir, former FBI agent William C. Sullivan said that, despite Hoover&#x27;s relentless efforts, the FBI never found &quot;anything substantial&quot; and that the accusations against Lattimore were &quot;ridiculous.&quot;

==Legacy==
In 1963, he was recruited from Johns Hopkins University to establish the Department of Chinese Studies (now East Asian Studies) at the University of Leeds. In addition to setting up Chinese Studies, he promoted Mongolian Studies, building good relations between Leeds and Mongolia and establishing a programme in Mongolian Studies in 1968. He remained at Leeds until he retired as Emeritus Professor in 1970.

In 1984 the University of Leeds conferred the degree of Doctor of Letters (DLitt) on Emeritus Professor Lattimore honoris causa.

Lattimore had a lifelong dedication to establishing research centres to further the study of Mongolian history and culture. In 1979 he became the first Westerner to be awarded the Order of the Polar Star, the highest award that the Mongolian state gives to foreigners. The State Museum in Ulaanbaatar named a newly discovered dinosaur after him in 1986.

The American Centre for Mongolian Studies, together with the International Association of Mongolian Studies and the National University of Mongolia School of Foreign Service, organized a conference entitled &quot;Owen Lattimore: The Past, Present, and Future of Inner Asian Studies&quot; in Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia, on August 20 and 21, 2008.

Prominent figures in the anti-Communist American political left offered mixed evaluations of Lattimore&#x27;s legacy in foreign policy. Arthur Schlesinger, Jr. thought that while Lattimore was not a Soviet spy, he may have been a fellow traveler who was deeply committed to communist ideals, and Sidney Hook similarly proclaimed Latimore &quot;a devious and skillful follower of the Communist Party line on Asian affairs”.

===Theory===
Historian Peter Perdue wrote that &quot;Modern historians, anthropologists, and archaeologists have revised many of Lattimore&#x27;s arguments, but they still rely on his insights. All of the themes addressed by Lattimore continue to inspire world historians today.&quot;

In &quot;An Inner Asian Approach to the Historical Geography of China&quot; (1947), Lattimore explored the system through which humanity affects the environment and is changed by it, and concluded that civilization is molded by its own impact on the environment. He lists the following pattern:

# A primitive society pursues some agricultural activities, but is aware that it has many limitations.
# Growing and evolving, the society begins to change the environment. For example, depleting its game supply and wild crops, it begins to domesticate animals and plants. It deforests land to create room for these activities.
# The environment changes, offering new opportunities. For example, it becomes grasslands.
# Society changes in response, and reacts to the new opportunities as a new society. For example, the once-nomads build permanent settlements and shift from a hunter-gatherer mentality to a farming society culture.
# The reciprocal process continues, offering new variations.

<text>Problems of the following type, and their solution techniques, were first studied in the 18th century, and the general topic became known as geometric probability.

* (Buffon&#x27;s needle) What is the chance that a needle dropped randomly onto a floor marked with equally spaced parallel lines will cross one of the lines?
* What is the mean length of a random chord of a unit circle? (cf. Bertrand&#x27;s paradox).
* What is the chance that three random points in the plane form an acute (rather than obtuse) triangle?
* What is the mean area of the polygonal regions formed when randomly oriented lines are spread over the plane?

For mathematical development see the concise monograph by Solomon.

Since the late 20th century, the topic has split into two topics with different emphases. Integral geometry sprang from the principle that the mathematically natural probability models are those that are invariant under certain transformation groups. This topic emphasises systematic development of formulas for calculating expected values associated with the geometric 
objects derived from random points, and can in part be viewed as a sophisticated branch of multivariate calculus. Stochastic geometry emphasises the random geometrical objects themselves. For instance: different models for random lines or for random tessellations of the plane; random sets formed by making points of a spatial Poisson process be (say) centers of discs.

<text>In Memoriam A.H.H. (1850) by Alfred, Lord Tennyson, is an elegy for his Cambridge friend Arthur Henry Hallam, who died of cerebral haemorrhage at the age of twenty-two years, in Vienna in 1833. As a sustained exercise in tetrametric lyrical verse, Tennyson&#x27;s poetical reflections extend beyond the meaning of the death of Hallam, thus, &quot;In Memoriam&quot; also explores the random cruelty of Nature seen from the conflicting perspectives of materialist science and declining Christian faith in the Victorian era (1837–1901), the poem thus is an elegy, a requiem, and a dirge for a friend, a time, and a place.

==History==
&quot;In Memoriam A.H.H.&quot; (1850) is an elegiac, narrative poem in 2,916 lines of iambic tetrameter, composed in 133 cantos, each canto headed with a Roman numeral, and organised in three parts: (i) the prologue, (ii) the poem, and (iii) the epilogue. After seventeen years of composing, writing, and editing, from 1833 to 1850, Tennyson anonymously published the poem under the Latin title &quot;In Memoriam A.H.H. Obiit MDCCCXXXIII&quot; (In Memoriam A.H.H. 1833). Moreover, upon the literary, artistic, and commercial success of the poetry, Tennyson further developed the poem and added Canto LIX: &#x27;O Sorrow, wilt thou live with me&#x27; to the 1851 edition; and then added Canto XXXIX: &#x27;Old warder of these buried bones&#x27; to the 1871 edition. The epilogue concludes &quot;In Memoriam&quot; with an epithalamium, a nuptial poem for the poet&#x27;s sister, Cecilia Tennyson, on her wedding to the academic Edmund Law Lushington, in 1842.

==The poem==
===Metrical form===

Written in iambic tetrameter (four-line ABBA stanzas), the poetical metre of &quot;In Memoriam A.H.H.&quot; creates the tonal effects of the sounds of grief and mourning. In 133 cantos, including the prologue and the epilogue, Tennyson uses the stylistic beats of tetrameter to address the subjects of spiritual loss and themes of nostalgia, philosophic speculation, and Romantic fantasy in service to mourning the death of his friend, the poet A. H. Hallam; thus, in Canto IX, Tennyson describes the return of the corpse to England: &quot;Fair ship, that from the Italian shore / Saileth the placid ocean-plains / With my lost Arthur&#x27;s remains, / Spread thy full wings and waft him o&#x27;er&quot;.

===Themes===
As a man of the Victorian age (1837–1901) and as a poet, Tennyson addressed the intellectual matters of his day, such as the theory of the transmutation of species presented in the anonymously published book &quot;Vestiges of the Natural History of Creation&quot; (1844), a speculative natural history about the negative theological implications of Nature functioning without divine direction. Moreover, 19th-century Evangelicalism required belief in literal interpretations of &quot;The Holy Bible&quot; against the theory of human evolution; thus, in Canto CXXIX, Tennyson alludes to &quot;the truths that never can be proved&quot; – the Victorian belief that reason and intellect would reconcile science with religion.

In Canto LV, the poet asks:


In Canto LVI, the poet queries Nature about the existential circumstance of Man on planet Earth:

Moreover, although Tennyson published &quot;In Memoriam A.H.H.&quot; (1850) nine years before Charles Darwin published the book &quot;On the Origin of Species&quot; (1859), contemporary advocates for the theory of natural selection had adopted the poetical phrase &quot;Nature, red in tooth and claw&quot; (Canto LVI) to support their humanist arguments for the theory of human evolution.

In Canto CXXII, Tennyson addresses the conflict between conscience and theology:

The conclusion of the poem reaffirmed Tennyson&#x27;s religiosity, his progress from doubt-and-despair to faith-and-hope, which he realised by mourning the death of his friend, Arthur Henry Hallam (1811–1833).

===Personal themes===
The literary scholar Christopher Ricks relates the following lines, from canto XCIX, to the end of Tennyson&#x27;s boyhood at the Somersby Rectory, Lincolnshire, especially the boy&#x27;s leaving Somersby upon the death of his father.

In Canto XCIX, the poet writes:

==Quotations==
The poem has yielded many literary quotations:

In Canto XXVII:

In Canto LIV:

In Canto LVI:

In Canto CXXIII:

Concerning the natural science of the time, in Canto CXXIII, Tennyson reports that &quot;The hills are shadows, and they flow / From form to form, and nothing stands&quot; in reference to the then-recent discovery, in the 19th century, that planet Earth was geologically active and far older than believed a century earlier.

==Legacy==

=== Queen Victoria ===
&quot;In Memoriam&quot; was a favourite poem of Queen Victoria, who after the death of her husband, the Prince Consort Albert, was &quot;soothed &amp; pleased&quot; by the feelings explored in Tennyson&#x27;s poem. In 1862 and in 1883, Queen Victoria met Tennyson to tell him she much liked his poetry.

=== Novels ===
In the novel &quot;The Tragedy of the Korosko&quot; (1898), by Arthur Conan Doyle, characters quote the poem by citing Canto LIV of &quot;In Memoriam&quot;: &quot;Oh yet we trust that somehow good / will be the final goal of ill&quot;; and by citing Canto LV: I falter where I firmly trod&quot;; whilst another character says that Lord Tennyson&#x27;s &quot;In Memoriam&quot; is &quot;the grandest and the deepest and the most inspired [poem] in our language&quot;.

Alan Hollinghurst, in his novel &quot;The Stranger&#x27;s Child&quot; (2011), has his central character, the doomed Cecil Valance, quote from Canto CI, in which appear the lines &quot;And year by year the landscape grow / Familiar to the stranger&#x27;s child&quot;.

Alice Winn&#x27;s novel &quot;In Memoriam&quot; (2023) mentions &quot;In Memoriam&quot; throughout the novel, with the principal characters discussing writing their own &quot;In Memoriam&quot; poems for each other if they die in World War I.

<text>The Cathedral Church of Saint Philip, also called the Birmingham Cathedral, is a Church of England cathedral and the seat of the Bishop of Birmingham. Built as a parish church in the Baroque style by Thomas Archer, it was consecrated in 1715. Located on Colmore Row in central Birmingham, St Philip&#x27;s became the cathedral of the newly formed Diocese of Birmingham in 1905. The cathedral is a Grade I listed building.

==History==
===Founding===
St Philip&#x27;s Church was planned when the nearby medieval church of St Martin in the Bull Ring became insufficient to house its congregation because of the growing population of Birmingham. The land, previously named the &quot;Barley Close&quot;, was donated by Robert Philips in 1710. It is one of the highest points in the district and is said to be at the same level as the cross on St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral in London. Following an Act of Parliament, construction commenced in 1711, to the design of Thomas Archer, and was ready for consecration in 1715, when it was dedicated to the Apostle Philip as a tribute to the benefactor Robert Philips. It appears to have been Archer&#x27;s first church, apart from a rebuilt chancel at Chicheley attributed to him. Construction was estimated to cost £20,000, but the final figure was only £5,012. (equivalent to £ in ). This was because many of the materials were donated and transported to the site at no cost. St Philip&#x27;s served as a Parish church from 1715 to 1905.

The church contained St. Philip&#x27;s Parish Library, which was bequeathed to the church by William Higgs. In 1792 a library room was constructed next to the parsonage house by Spencer Madan and was named the Parochial Library.

===Cathedral===

With the growth of industrial towns in the 18th and 19th centuries, there was a consequent growth in the number of parishes, and a need for new administrative centres. Birmingham became a city in 1889. While the cities of Liverpool and Truro constructed new cathedrals, in a number of other cities existing churches and ancient abbeys were raised to the administrative status of cathedrals. Through the actions of the statesman Joseph Chamberlain and the Bishop of Worcester, Charles Gore, St Philip&#x27;s became the Cathedral of Birmingham in 1905, with Charles Gore as its first bishop.

===World War II===
During World War II, the cathedral was bombed and gutted on the 7 November 1940. Its most significant treasures, several windows by Edward Burne-Jones, had been removed in the early stages of the war by Birmingham Civic Society, and were replaced, unharmed, when the building was restored in 1948.

==Architecture==


St Philip&#x27;s was designed by Thomas Archer and constructed between 1711 and 1715. The tower was complete by 1725, and the urns on the parapet were added in 1756. Archer had visited Rome and his design, in the Baroque style, is influenced by the churches of Borromini, being rather more Italianate than churches by Christopher Wren. The rectangular hall church interior has aisles separated from the nave by fluted pillars of classical form with Tuscan capitals supporting an arcade surmounted by a heavily projecting cornice. Wooden galleries are stretched between the pillars in a manner typical of English Baroque churches.

Outside the cathedral, tall windows are interspaced by pilasters in low relief, supporting a balustrade at roof level with an urn rising above each pilaster. The western end is marked by a single tower which rises in stages and is surmounted by a lead-covered dome and a delicate lantern. The building is of brick and is faced with stone quarried on Archer&#x27;s estate at Umberslade.

The original shallow eastern apse was extended in 1884–88 by J. A. Chatwin into a much larger chancel, articulated by strongly projecting Corinthian columns. This bold design is made richer by the marbled surfaces of the columns and pilasters, the gilding of capitals and cornice and the ornately coffered ceiling. Chatwin also refaced the exterior of the building because the stone from the original quarry was very soft. The tower was refaced in 1958–59.

Edward Burne-Jones, who was born in nearby Bennett&#x27;s Hill and baptised in the church, added to the enhancement of St Philips by the donation of several windows, of which three are at the eastern end. The west window, also by Burne-Jones, was dedicated in memory of Henry Bowlby in 1897.

Six of the monuments have heritage listings, including one commemorating two men who died during the construction of Birmingham Town Hall and a memorial to the victims of 1974&#x27;s Birmingham pub bombings. Thomas Stirling Lee&#x27;s statue of Charles Gore, vested in convocation robes with his right hand raised in blessing, is located at the West entrance. 

==Grounds==

Outside the Cathedral, a large Portland stone obelisk commemorates Frederick Gustavus Burnaby. Besides Burnaby&#x27;s bust, in relief, it carries only the word &quot;Burnaby&quot;, and the dated place names &quot;Khiva 1875&quot; and &quot;Abu Klea 1885&quot;. These refer to the Khanate of Khiva and Battle of Abu Klea, respectively; he was killed at the latter. The obelisk was unveiled by Lord Charles Beresford on 13 November 1885. An earlier red marble was erected in 1857 to commemorate the life and death of Lieutenant-Colonel Thomas Unett, who died leading his men during the Siege of Sevastopol. Upon completion of the Burnaby building, it was decided to prohibit monuments from being added to the interior.

The grounds are known colloquially as &quot;Pigeon Park&quot;.

==Dean and chapter==
As of 30 November 2020:
*Dean – Matt Thompson (since 30 September 2017 installation)
*Canon Precentor – Josephine Houghton (since 11 May 2019 installation)
*Canon Missioner – Andy Delmege (since 26 July 2020 installation)

==Music==
===Organ===

The organ, originally built by Thomas Swarbrick, still dates in part from 1715. It underwent repairs during the late 19th century and was moved from its original position in the gallery. It has been restored, enlarged and modernised several times, most recently by Nicholson&#x27;s in 1993. Details of the organ can be found at the National Pipe Organ Register.

===Organists===

Directors of Music and assistant organists at St Philip&#x27;s Cathedral, Birmingham, have included composers Charles John Blood Meacham, Richard Yates Mander and Rupert Jeffcoat. Until 2018 the Director of Music was Marcus Huxley, and the Head of Music is now David Hardie with Ashley Wagner as the Assistant Head of Music.

==Bells==
Following the completion of the tower in 1725 Joseph Smith of Edgbaston provided a ring of eight bells which were subsequently augmented to ten, the tenor weighing approximately 26 cwt (1,320 kg). These bells were to prove unsatisfactory for in 1751 the vestry resolved to have them recast by Thomas Lester of the Whitechapel Bell Foundry in London. The new bells were slightly larger than the previous, with a tenor weighing in the key of D—a total weight of , and hung in a wooden frame.

Throughout the late 18th and 19th centuries the bells were well used, however from 1906 the bells had become unringable, due in part to concerns about the safety of the tower. Ringing was briefly revived in 1921 but when the Coronation of 1937 provided the impetus to restore the bells they had been unringable again for several years.

The 1937 restoration was carried out by the Croydon bell founders, Gillett &amp; Johnston, the bells being recast and hung in a cast-iron frame at the base of the large louvre windows. The same foundry cast two additional treble bells in 1949, given by Frank B Yates, to complete the ring of twelve bells that exists today. The tenor bell weighs and is in the key of D.

In 2004, the Whitechapel Bell Foundry carried out rehanging and refurbishment of the frame and fittings, including further strengthening work to the upper frame and the installation of a viewing gallery, accessed from the original belfry doorway. Brian Yates, grandson of the above Frank Yates, was the principal donor for this project.

<text>Krishnamachari &quot;Kris&quot; Srikkanth (; ; born 21 December 1959), also known as Cheeka, is a former Indian cricketer and coach. He also serves as a cricket commentator. He was a hard-hitting opening batter and an occasional right arm offbreak bowler. He has served as a captain of the Indian cricket team and chairman of the men&#x27;s selection committee later.

He has two siblings, brother Krishnamachari Srinath and sister Srekala Bharath. He did his schooling from Vidya Mandir and completed his pre-university from Ramakrishna Mission Vivekananda College. He graduated as an electrical engineer from College of Engineering, Guindy. Srikkanth married Vidya on 30 March 1983. They have two sons Adityaa and Anirudha, both of them are cricketers themselves.

== Early career==
Srikkanth represented Tamil Nadu and South zone in Indian domestic cricket. He made his first class debut during the 1978–79 season. He was the captain of the first ever youth test played by the India national under-19 cricket team in the 1978–79 season.

== International career ==
=== Debut and early years ===
Srikkanth made his One Day International (ODI) debut at the age of 21, against England in Ahmedabad on 25 November 1981. Opening the batting with Sunil Gavaskar, 
and India lost by 5 wickets. He made his Test debut two days later against England at Bombay.

=== 1983 World cup and rise ===
Srikkanth was part of the Indian cricket team that won the 1983 Cricket World Cup. He opened the batting and scored 156 runs in the tournament. In the final against West Indies, he top-scored with 38 runs. He was also part of the Indian team that won the 1985 World Championship of Cricket. He was the top scorer in the tournament with 238 runs. India won the final after beating Pakistan where he top scored with 67 runs from 77 balls and won the Man of the match award.

=== Middle years ===
Srikkanth has his most prolific years in terms of runs from 1986 to 1988 when he scored two centuries in tests and four centuries in ODIs. Srikkanth scored his first century in test cricket in the third test against Australia at Sydney on 2 January 1986. He scored his second and last test century against the visiting Pakistan at his home ground at M. A. Chidambaram Stadium, Chennai in February 1987.

He served as the captain of the test team for four matches during the India&#x27;s tour of Pakistan in 1990 and drew all the matches.

He was named as part of the Indian team that competed in the 1992 Cricket World Cup and holds the unusual record of scoring the only run ever scored in international cricket at Ray Mitchell Oval, in Mackay, Australia when the only international match ever hosted at the venue was washed out after two deliveries. He retired from international cricket in March 1992 after the world cup with his last match coming against South Africa at Adelaide.

== Playing style ==
Srikkanth was an opening batsman, noted for his aggressive play and attacking cricketing strokes. He was known for his super-quick reflexes and scored majority of his runs through pulling and hooking or driving the ball. Though his batting style was in stark contrast to his long time opening partner Sunil Gavaskar, who was known for his reserved approach, Gavaskar himself has said that Srikkanth&#x27;s batting liberated him to play his natural game. He targeted the new ball when it is hard and often scored his runs in the later years with hits over the infield when the fielding restrictions are in place during the initial overs. He is considered as one of the pioneers of pinch hitting in men&#x27;s cricket, nearly a decade before Ian Botham and Mark Greatbatch tried it in the 1992 Cricket World Cup and Sanath Jayasuriya popularized it during the 1996 Cricket World Cup. He was described by cricketers and commentators as one of the most entertaining batters of his era.

<text>The Sisters of Perpetual Indulgence (SPI), also called Order of Perpetual Indulgence (OPI), is a charitable, protest, and street performance movement that uses drag and religious imagery to satirize issues of sex, gender, and morality (particularly Christian perspectives on these topics) and fundraise for charity. In 1979, a small group of gay men in San Francisco began wearing the attire of Catholic nuns in visible situations using camp to promote various social and political causes in the Castro District.

From the original organization in San Francisco, the Sisters have grown throughout the U.S., Canada, Australia, Europe, and South America, and are now an international network of autonomous orders. These orders are mostly registered as non-profit charity organizations that raise money for AIDS, LGBT-related causes, and mainstream community service organizations, while promoting safer sex and educating others about the harmful effects of drug use and other high risk behaviors. They have also protested many Christian, and specifically Catholic, events perceived as anti-LGBT, including the visit of Pope John Paul II to the United States.

Throughout the movement&#x27;s history there have been a number of conflicts with Christian communities. The group has been characterized by several Catholic clergy, organizations and laypeople (such as the Catholic League for Religious and Civil Rights) as anti-Catholic and a hate-group for impersonating and mocking Catholic practices and beliefs, including religious sisters.

==Inception==

The Sisters of Perpetual Indulgence made their first appearance on Castro Street in San Francisco in 1979. Their approach and appearance was not new or extraordinary for the place or time. Starting in the 1960s, the Castro District began transitioning from a working class Irish Catholic district going through significant economic decline. A gay bar opened on Market Street and gradually, gay men began to migrate to the neighborhood. By 1977, between 100,000 and 200,000 had moved to San Francisco from all over the United States, changing the political and cultural profile of the city. The Castro was also known for the outrageous characters who were 1970s mainstays, such as &quot;Jesus Christ Satan&quot; and &quot;The Cosmic Lady&quot;, who endeared themselves to local residents with their unique perspectives, particularly during street events such as the Castro Street Fair and Halloween in the Castro. At the same time, religious participation in politics appeared in the late 1970s with the activism of Anita Bryant, and Jerry Falwell&#x27;s establishment of the Moral Majority. The Castro District had been publicized nationally as a major gay neighborhood and was targeted by evangelists who took weekly trips to loudly preach to the residents about the immorality of homosexuality.

On April 14, 1979 (Saturday of Easter weekend), three men (Ken Bunch, Fred Brungard, and a friend) dressed as nuns with habits, that Bunch had acquired several years before, walked through the Castro. Later Bunch and Burngard with a different friend, Agnes de Garron a.k.a. Edmund Garron, appeared at a gay softball game in habit and with pom poms. At the annual Castro Street Fair on August 19, 1979, Sister Adhanarisvara (Bunch) and Sister Missionary Position (Brungard) along with Sister Solicitation (de Garron) and Reverend Mother, the Abbess (Bill Graham) announced the order and started recruiting. Later that year de Garron designed habits for the members while the group discussed what to do. Initially they made postcards and greeting cards depicting them in their habits which they handed out with a requested donation to cover costs. Either at the end of 1979 or beginning of 1980, the group decided on a name, Sisters of Perpetual Indulgence. Their first protest as an official order was joining an anti-nuclear march in March 1980 with habits and pom poms and reciting their &quot;Rosary in Time of Nuclear Peril&quot;. 
In August 1980 they confronted the evangelists, a dozen men dressed in 14th century Belgian nun&#x27;s robes and habits, and according to one participant, Sister Missionary Position, &quot;a teensy bit of make-up so as not to be dowdy on a Friday night&quot;, met the evangelists at Harvey Milk Plaza. One recited a litany asking among other things for &quot;mercy on the self-righteous who take away our liberty&quot;. The evangelist left but then returned in a larger group to be met by the sisters dancing and reciting the litany. The next day at a larger evangelical event including a Christian band the sisters joined in the dancing and flirted with the evangelists.

In October 1980, the dozen or so Sisters held their first fundraiser, a bingo game and a disco and salsa dance that was well-attended in large part because of the write-up in &quot;The San Francisco Chronicle&quot; by Herb Caen the same day, who printed their organization name, the Sisters of Perpetual Indulgence. The benefit was for San Francisco&#x27;s Metropolitan Community Church gay Cuban refugee program, and it netted $1,500 ($ in 2022).

==Structure and methods==
Members of the Sisters of Perpetual Indulgence include people who identify with a variety of sexual orientations and genders, although the majority are gay men. Joining an order mirrors the steps for joining an actual order of nuns. Potential members are encouraged to attend organizational meetings as aspirants, and told that if they are not intending to make a lifelong commitment they should seriously reconsider. After showing intent and being approved by the order, an aspirant is promoted to a postulant and is expected to learn about the history of the organization and continue to work behind the scenes for at least six months. Postulants are not allowed to wear nun&#x27;s attire, but may instead dress in &quot;festive garb that fits in with Order&quot;, according to the Sisters&#x27; website. If the members approve of the postulant, a fully indoctrinated member may act as a sponsor and the postulant is promoted to a novice. Novices are allowed to wear white veils and whiteface make-up. This phase lasts another six months during which the novice is expected to work within the organization and plan an event. If three-fourths of the order agrees, the novice is promoted to a full member of the group.

After their inception, the Sisters soon spread to other cities within the U.S. as a loosely connected network of mostly autonomous houses. There are thirteen houses and six missions in various cities across the U.S. Globally, 600 members work for established houses or missions in Australia, Canada, Colombia, France, Germany, Switzerland, the United Kingdom, and Uruguay. Chapters founded outside the United States would also become involved in local issues. Whilst the United Kingdom chapter was involved in protests against police hostility towards the lesbian and gay community and safe-sex education, the chapter was also involved in campaigning unrelated to LGBT+ issues, such as protests against Poll Tax, the Gulf War, and the 1984–85 UK miners&#x27; strike.
The San Francisco Founding House anchors much of the activities and continues to be the largest and most well-funded. The San Francisco House (SPI, Inc.) also holds the registered trademarks for &quot;Sisters of Perpetual Indulgence&quot; and the &quot;laughing nun head&quot; logo.

Only in San Francisco could the Sisters of Perpetual Indulgence not only make their first appearance, but become interwoven in the cultural and political fabric of the city, according to scholar Cathy Glenn in the journal &quot;Theory and Event&quot;. Glenn uses the examples of San Francisco as a society of hyperpluralism, where all the groups who have called the city their home have successfully maintained their individual identities, creating a culture defined by counterculture and at times marked by political violence. The Sisters use Catholic imagery as simultaneous inspiration and fodder for parody through camp. They choose names based on the process of renaming women inducted into Catholic orders, but that suggest sexual promiscuity or that are based in absurdity: Sister Anita Blowjob, Sister GladAss of the Joyous Reserectum, Sister Hellena Handbasket, Sister Sensible Shoes, and Sister Homo Celestial, among others. They wear wimples, habits, and robes of nuns, but accessorize them with baubles, beads, and whiteface make-up. Sister Phyllis Stein, the Fragrant Mistress of Sistory, asserts that there is a clear distinction between drag queens and members of the Sisters of Perpetual Indulgence: &quot;We&#x27;re not dressed as girls, we&#x27;re dressed as nuns... We definitely minister to the spiritual needs of our community, while drag queens sort of focus on camp and fun within our communities. We&#x27;re very different communities. A lot of people refer to us as drag queens, but we say we&#x27;re in nun drag. We are nuns.&quot;

Sister Irma Geddon of the Portland, Oregon-based Order of Benevolent Bliss offered her view of the efficacy of using nun&#x27;s clothing and drag: &quot;The lightness of everything, in addition to the whiteface and the nun&#x27;s habits, are a mechanism to reach out to people. When we&#x27;re dressed up like that, kind of like sacred clowns, it allows people to interact with us.&quot;

==Activism==

===AIDS education===

The organization of the Sisters of Perpetual Indulgence occurred at the same time HIV/AIDS began appearing in the Castro District and New York City. Safe havens during the AIDS crisis came in the form of bars such as Maud&#x27;s and Amelia&#x27;s, but these were shut down, as at the time many people believed bars were places were everyone had AIDS or could get it very easily. Some of the earliest attempts to bring attention to the new disease were staged by the Sisters, both in and out of costume. During the pandemic, the Sisters tried to fill the supportive role for the LGBTQ community that churches, the government, and families had repudiated. The Sisters staged one of the earliest fundraisers for HIV/AIDS in June 1982, and continued to raise money through the 1980s for AIDS victims. 

==== Play Fair! ====
In 1982, Sister Florence Nightmare, RN (early AIDS activist and registered nurse Bobbi Campbell) and Sister Roz Erection (Baruch Golden, a registered nurse) joined with a team of Sisters and medical professionals to create &quot;Play Fair!&quot;, the first safer sex pamphlet to use plain language, practical advice and humor. A founder of the Sisters considered &quot;Play Fair!&quot; to be &quot;one of the Order&#x27;s greatest achievements in community education and support&quot;. The zine was illustrated with comics of nuns, colored in black, white, and pink, and was one of the few campaigns at the time to use humor, rather than rules and sex negativity, to talk about AIDS and STIs. The pamphlet included a section on Kaposi’s sarcoma and pneumocystis pneumonia, two symptoms of what would later be described as AIDS, explaining them as part of a host of severe immune system problems that had started to affect some gay men in large cities over the previous two years. The pamphlet also explained gonorrhea, syphilis, herpes, hepatitis, venereal warts, scabies, crabs, and intestinal parasites. One notable inclusion in its STI list was the psychological impact of &quot;guilt.&quot; The pamphlet explained guilt&#x27;s symptoms as &quot;feeling bad after a trip to the baths, bushes, or tearooms; low self-esteem. Seldom asymptomatic&quot; with the cure: &quot;respect and love yourself and others.&quot;

During the 1980s, other chapters of the Sisters adapted &quot;Play Fair!&quot; and created new safer sex outreach materials. The Toronto chapter produced two &quot;Cum Clean&quot; STI pamphlets, with comic cover images of the nuns, as well as &quot;Perpetually Indulgent Rainchecks&quot; to destigmatize discussing STI checkups and safer sex while waiting for results. In 1999, for the Sisters&#x27; 20th anniversary the &quot;Play Fair!&quot; pamphlet was revised. The Sisters worldwide continue to raise awareness of sexual health; many Orders regularly pass out condoms and participate in events to educate people on sexual health issues.

==== AIDS Memorials ====
Campbell appeared on the cover of &quot;Newsweek&quot; declaring himself to be the &quot;AIDS poster boy&quot; in 1983. He was active in AIDS education and prevention and split his appearances as himself and Sister Florence Nightmare until his death in 1984. He and three other Castro residents started the AIDS Candlelight Memorial. Losing several members to AIDS in the early 1980s, the Sisters were present at the 1986 Castro Street Fair with less than a dozen members, who sponsored a fund-raising and safer sex education booth that featured pie throwing with the slogan &quot;Cream yer Sister, not yer lover!&quot;

Members of the Sisters of Perpetual Indulgence who have died are referred by the Sisters as &quot;Nuns of the Above&quot;. Specific losses due to AIDS are recorded in the folk art NAMES Project AIDS Memorial Quilt. Created in the 1985 the quilt has made history several times. It was featured at the 1996 NAMES quilt display in Washington, D.C., in front of the U.S. House of Representatives and was among the first quilts viewed by then Vice President Al Gore and his wife Tipper Gore and later featured in the NAMES Projects&#x27; calendar worldwide. The Nuns of The Above quilt itself has been flown around the United States and is in high demand for local displays. While in town for the AIDS Memorial Quilt display the Sisters led an exorcism of homophobia, classism, and racism on the steps of the United States House of Representatives, and assisted with the AIDS Coalition to Unleash Power (ACT-UP) death march and protest, to the gates of the White House where ashes of people who had died from AIDS were illegally spread on the lawn.

===Political activism, protest, and religious parodies===

Once founded in 1979, the Sisters of Perpetual Indulgence attracted local attention by attending major LGBT events in the Castro District dressed as Catholic nuns.

In 1982, Jack Fertig, known as Sister Boom Boom, ran for San Francisco Board of Supervisors earning over 23,000 votes with her occupation listed as &quot;Nun of the Above&quot;. San Francisco passed a law soon after, commonly called the &quot;Sister Boom Boom Law&quot;, that all people running for office had to do so with their legal name.

The same year the Sisters attended a Mass at Cathedral of Saint Mary, after which the local Catholic newspaper &quot;The Monitor&quot; stated the group was degrading towards Catholic nuns, citing Sister Boom Boom&#x27;s name, and Sister Hysterectoria&#x27;s. In response to the Sisters&#x27; presence in St. Mary&#x27;s Cathedral, the Archbishop of San Francisco John R. Quinn issued a pastoral letter, stating that the Church condemns homosexual activity, but that homosexual people have to be provided &quot;sound pastoral care&quot; and are ultimately &quot;no different than other Christians&quot;, that it was a Christian duty to &quot;stand up against violence directed toward gays and to protect gay civil rights&quot;, and that harassment or persecution of homosexual people is incompatible with the Gospel. Some activists praised the letter or considered it &quot;an encouraging sign&quot;, while others were critical of it; the Bay Area Reporter criticized it for upholding the traditional church line and suggested that despite a seemingly supportive letter, Quinn still condemned homosexuality in the hope of receiving a &quot;major papal appointment&quot;.

Outlined as one of the Sisters&#x27; missions &quot;to promulgate universal joy and to expiate stigmatic guilt&quot;, the Sisters of Perpetual Indulgence have a history of bringing attention to conservative movements that attempt to shame members of the LGBT community or people with HIV/AIDS. Sisters performed a public exorcism of anti-feminist Phyllis Schlafly that was deliberately timed to take place at Union Square during the 1984 Democratic National Convention, taking place in San Francisco. A Sister dressed as Schlafly was held down as another spoke to the crowd, and other Sisters pulled out rubber snakes from the mock-Schlafly&#x27;s clothing. Also taking place was Jerry Falwell&#x27;s Family Forum, hosted by the Moral Majority whose major planks focused on condemning homosexuality, pornography, and abortion. A Sister dressed as Falwell was undressed during the performance to reveal fishnet stockings and a corset in front of an audience of 2,000.

The same year, the Sisters held another mock exorcism, this time of Pope John Paul II, coinciding with his visit to San Francisco, calling it the &quot;Official San Francisco Papal Welcoming Committee&quot;. The Sisters claim the action, also taking place in Union Square, earned the organization a spot on the Papal List of Heretics. At the time of the papal visit, the relations between the Catholic and LGBT communities of San Francisco were strained because of a letter by the Dicastery for the Doctrine of the Faith, often called &quot;Ratzinger Letter&quot; in reference to Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger (later Pope Benedict XVI). The letter was considered an attack on the LGBT community, with LGBT newspaper Bay Area Reporter mocking the letter with a headline &quot;Pope to Gays: &#x27;Drop Dead.&quot; Some critics claimed that the letter implied that the LGBT community itself is responsible for violence against it, and that homosexual people were responsible for the AIDS crisis. The outrage grasped the entirety of the local LGBT community, with the city&#x27;s newspapers and activist groups ridiculing the pope and publishing mocking cartoons. Massive protests were planned for the date of the papal visit - a petition named &quot;Pope, Stay Home!&quot; was started by gay civil rights groups, and civil suits were filed in attempt to prevent the visit. Amidst these tensions, the &quot;Papal Welcoming Committee&quot; by the Sisters drew huge attention and sparked controversy.

The Archbishop of San Francisco, John R. Quinn, published a clarification to the Ratzinger Letter, stating that the letter was not meant to be an attack on the LGBT community and disputing claims that the letter blamed homophobic violence on homosexuals themselves. Quinn wrote that too much focus was placed on possibly negative aspects of the letter, with many misconceptions emerging as a result. The Archbishop concluded that the letter &quot;affirms the spiritual and human dignity of the homosexual person while placing a negative moral judgment on homosexual acts and a negative philosophical judgment on the homosexual inclination or orientation, which it clearly states is not a sin or moral evil&quot;. The archdiocese also started negotiating with the local gay community in order to prevent possible violence during the papal visit; after these negotiations, a press conference was held where the archdiocese was joined by several gay groups such as DignityUSA, where both sides pledged to commit themselves to non-violence. As a result, the threat of massive demonstrations never materialized, and the papal visit was considered a huge success. According to Jeffrey M. Burns, &quot;even the Sisters of Perpetual Indulgence protest went largely unnoticed&quot;. Many gay activists as well as gay Catholics attended papal events. The pope visited AIDS patients, and delivered a sermon that was considered an olive branch to the LGBT community, and was received well even by hitherto critical LGBT newspapers. In the sermon, John Paul II said: &quot;the all embracing love of God ... God loves you all, without distinction, without limit... He loves those of you who are sick, those who are suffering from AIDS and from AIDS-related complex. He loves the relatives and friends of the sick and those who care for them. He loves us all with an unconditional and ever lasting love ... he loves us in our human condition, with our weaknesses and our needs. Nothing else can explain the mystery of the cross ... The love of Christ is more powerful than sin and death.&quot;

Starting in 1995, the Sisters began a Castro Crawl on Easter Sunday to celebrate their anniversary. The event features a 13-stop pub crawl that parodies Stations of the Cross. At each station in front of a gay bar or gay organization, the Sisters call out &quot;We adore thee, O Christ&quot; to be answered by their traveling audience in &quot;Luvya, mean it, let&#x27;s do brunch&quot;. Actors portray the Virgin Mary, Mary Magdalene, and other people integral to Easter traditions, and the Sisters continue to educate for safer sex by passing out condoms, ending the event with a toast of vanilla wafers and Jägermeister.

In 1999, some of the city&#x27;s Catholic community criticized San Francisco Supervisor Tom Ammiano after the Board of Supervisors, at Ammiano&#x27;s request, granted the Sisters a permit to close a block of Castro Street for their 20th anniversary celebration on Easter Sunday, which included a &quot;Hunky Jesus&quot; contest among other activities. San Francisco&#x27;s Catholic archdiocese requested the event be moved to another day. The city&#x27;s Interfaith Council suggested the following Sunday, which was the Eastern Orthodox Easter. An Archdiocese newspaper compared the Sisters&#x27; event to neo-Nazis celebrating on the Jewish holiday of Passover. The controversy sparked a number of responses in &quot;The San Francisco Chronicle&quot; letters to the editor, both supporting and disputing the accuracy of the comparison; leaders of the San Francisco Anti-Defamation League chapter wrote in reply that such a characterization was offensive and &quot;trivializes the horrific actions of hate groups&quot;. The resulting attention ensured a crowd of 5,000 attendees and what the Sisters claimed to be a million dollars of free publicity. The event raised about $13,000 for the Tenderloin AIDS Resource Center and the San Francisco LGBT Community Center, among various groups. In 2011, gay Catholic writer Andrew Sullivan criticized the organization for hosting its annual &quot;Hunky Jesus&quot; contest on Easter Sunday and described the group as &quot;smug liberal bigots&quot;. He also said it empowers prejudices against the LGBT community.

In August 1999, the Sisters were invited to be parade grand marshals at Reno&#x27;s first Pride Parade. Nevada&#x27;s Republican governor Kenny Guinn, who had signed a bill in May outlawing discrimination against gays and lesbians in Nevada, refused to sign a proclamation in support of the parade, saying the group &quot;tends to cross the line of decency and appropriateness and would conduct themselves in a manner that would offend people of different religious groups&quot;.

Members of the San Diego Order have made a presence at a Christian fundamentalist youth revival meeting called Teen Mania Ministries from 2006 to 2008. Sisters Iona Dubble-Wyde and Freeda Sole stood outside Cox Arena in full regalia to intercept pastors and attendees. The responses from the children and adolescents were varied. While some told the Sisters they were going to hell, others asked questions and offered thanks and hugs; the event was generally reported as positive.

The Sisters were featured in a 2008 book titled &quot;Catholic and Queer&quot; where they explained that their mode of dress was meant not only to employ the &quot;fabulous attire&quot; that had been forsaken by Catholic non-cloistered orders, but that their dedication to community service is an attempt to &quot;honor and emulate [the] unstinting devotion&quot; of Roman Catholic nuns who work within their neighborhoods.

In 2023, the Los Angeles Sisters of Perpetual Indulgence were scheduled to receive a &quot;Community Hero Award&quot; from the Los Angeles Dodgers for their charity and activism on the Dodgers&#x27; annual &quot;Pride Night&quot;. On May 18, after US senator Marco Rubio, Catholic Vote, the Catholic League and other religious groups criticized the honoring, the team initially rescinded the invitation. The Los Angeles LGBT Center, ACLU, LA county supervisor Lindsey Horvath, city councilmember Eunisses Hernandez, state senator Scott Wiener, and US representative Robert Garcia called to reverse the disinvitation or cancel Pride Night if it would not feature the Sisters. L.A. Pride, the partner organization helping the Dodgers host the event, pulled out in protest, and the Los Angeles LGBT Center called for a boycott. On May 20, the mayor of Anaheim invited the Sisters to participate in the Los Angeles Angels&#x27; Pride Night instead, which they did on June 7.
On May 22, the Dodgers apologized and re-invited the Sisters, who accepted. In response, Catholic bishop Robert Barron called the Sisters an anti-Catholic hate group and called on people to boycott the Dodgers. 
Dodgers players Clayton Kershaw and Blake Treinen criticized the inclusion of the Sisters, saying their parodies were offensive. 
On the afternoon of Dodger Pride Night, June 17, 2023, thousands of Catholics and supporters protested in the parking lot.

===Halloween===

Celebrated even when the Castro was predominantly an Irish Catholic family neighborhood, as the demographics transformed, Halloween in the Castro became a major city event, described by author David Skal as &quot;gay high holy day&quot;, attracting thousands of outsiders. On October 31, 1989, two weeks after San Francisco was devastated by the 6.9 MW Loma Prieta earthquake, the Sisters used donation buckets to collect thousands of dollars for the mayor&#x27;s Earthquake Relief Fund from the Halloween crowds that poured into the Castro neighborhood for the massive street party.

The next year, the Sisters, with the San Francisco Gay Men&#x27;s Chorus and a group named Community United against Violence, took over the organization of the event for the next five years, drawing larger crowds and collecting for AIDS charities. By 1994 between 300,000 and 400,000 people attended the event. Controlling excesses became too difficult. Violence escalated, claimed by Dahn Van Laarz (Sister Dana van Iquity) to be the result of inebriated onlookers motivated by homophobia. When the police confiscated an AK-47 from a reveler trying to gain access to Castro Street, and they reported that 50 to 60 people had been arrested, the Sisters decided to move the celebration and Halloween in the Castro ended. The next year, the Sisters hosted a costume-mandatory dance named HallowQueen in a South of Market gay nightclub, which raised over $6,000 for charity.

A decade later the city was still struggling to manage the Halloween event. In 2006 nine people were wounded when a gunman opened fire at the celebration; it was canceled in 2007. The Sisters continued to organize private and safe events, raising money every year for charity.

===Community involvement===

The Sisters have been involved in various causes, including the promotion of safer sex, raising money for HIV/AIDS and breast cancer research, the Gay Games, Haight Ashbury Free Clinics, and raising the &quot;first legal $1000&quot; for a city proposition to legalize medical marijuana. Sister Roma organized a &quot;Stop the Violence&quot; campaign in the Castro where the Sisters distributed placards in homes and businesses to signify which were safe places to go, and whistles to be used to alert those nearby in case of attack. They have sponsored dances for LGBT youth, and given to or worked for a variety of similar objectives.

According to Jessi Knippel, the Sisters also engage in &quot;missionary&quot; and care work for the LGBT community, participating in &quot;bar missions&quot; in which the members of the organisation share care bags and pamphlets. The self-declared goal of the Sisters is to assist the LGBT community and offer it &quot;absolution from guilt&quot;.

==&quot;Saints&quot; and &quot;angels&quot;==
Over the years the Sisters have named as saints hundreds of people who have helped on various projects behind the scenes organizing, coordinating actions or projects, performing at events as an artist or emcee or even serving the greater LGBT community. Rarely but sometimes they canonize community heroes who have recently died. It is customary for the Sisters to award sainthood with the addition of an elaborate &quot;saint name&quot;. Notable saints include:
* Assassinated San Francisco Supervisor Harvey Milk

<text>Innocenti () was an Italian machinery works, originally established by Ferdinando Innocenti in 1933 in Lambrate, a neighborhood on the eastern outskirts of Milan. Over the years, they produced Lambretta scooters as well as a range of automobiles, mainly of British Leyland origins. The brand was retired in 1996, six years after being acquired by Fiat.

== History ==
After World War II, the company was famous for many years for Lambretta scooters models such as the Lambretta 48, LI125, LI150, TV175, TV200, SX125, SX150, SX200, GP125, GP150 and GP200.

From 1961 to 1976, Innocenti built under licence the BMC (later the British Leyland Motor Corporation / BLMC) Mini, with 848, 998 cc and 1,275 cc engines, followed by other models, including, from 1973, the Regent (Allegro), with engines up to 1,485 cc. The company of this era is commonly called Leyland Innocenti. The Innocenti Spyder (1961–70) was a re-bodied version of the Austin-Healey MKII Sprite (styling by Ghia). The car was produced by OSI, near Milan. In 1972, BLMC took over control of the company.

In 1972, the company&#x27;s land, buildings and equipment were purchased by British Leyland in a deal involving approximately £3 million. The British company had high hopes for its newly acquired subsidiary at a time when, they reported to the UK press, Italian Innocenti sales were second only to those of Fiat and ahead of Volkswagen and Renault: there was talk of further increasing annual production from 56,452 in 1971 to 100,000. However, the peak production under BLMC was 62,834 in 1972, in spite of exports increasing from one car in 1971 to more than 17,000 in 1974. Demonstrating their ambitions, the British company installed as managing director one of their youngest UK based senior executives, the 32-year-old former financial controller Geoffrey Robinson. Three years later, BLMC ran out of money and was nationalised by the UK government.
In February 1976, the company passed to Alejandro de Tomaso and was reorganised by the De Tomaso Group under the name &quot;Nuova Innocenti&quot;. Benelli had a share and British Leyland retained five percent with De Tomaso owning forty-four percent with the aid of a rescue plan from GEPI (an Italian public agency intended to provide investment for troubled corporations). Management was entirely De Tomaso&#x27;s responsibility, however, and later in 1976, GEPI and De Tomaso combined their 95% of Innocenti (and all of Maserati) into one new holding company.

However, with the loss of the original Mini, the Austin I5 and the (slow-selling) Regent, sales were in free fall. Production was nearly halved in 1975 and was down to about a fifth of the 1974 levels in 1976. After this crisis, the new Bertone-bodied Mini began selling more strongly and production climbed to a steady 40,000 per annum by the end of the 1970s. The first models had Bertone-designed five-seater bodywork and was available with Leyland&#x27;s 998 cc and 1,275 cc engines.

Exports, which had been carried out mainly by British Leyland&#x27;s local concessionaires, began drying up in the early eighties as BL did not want to see internal competition from the Innocenti Mini. Sales to France (Innocenti&#x27;s biggest export market) ended in 1980, with German sales coming to a halt in 1982. Around the same time, the engine deal with Leyland ended and production soon dropped into the low twenty thousands. Having lost their engine supply as well as their entire export dealer net, Innocenti found themselves without a product and the means of selling it.

However, Daihatsu of Japan were in need of a European partner. In addition to providing drivetrains, Daihatsu gave Innocenti access to their burgeoning sales network, entering France, Belgium and Switzerland at first. Daihatsu gained access to the Italian market, and a means of entry into other European nations with steep barriers for Japanese-made cars. That Innocenti, like Daihatsu, was a small-car specialist only made the marriage even more suitable. And so it was that, from model year 1983 on, the Innocenti was completely re-engineered, now using the Daihatsu Charade&#x27;s 993 cc three-cylinder engine and an entirely new suspension. The appearance did not change in the least, in spite of it being, in essence, a new car. De Tomaso developed a turbocharged version of this engine for Daihatsu which found use in both Innocenti and Daihatsu cars.

In addition to building their own cars, De Tomaso also had Innocenti use their factory capacity in producing bodywork for and providing final assembly of the Maserati Biturbo, Quattroporte and the Chrysler TC by Maserati. As production kept decreasing, and prices vis-à-vis competing Fiat products increased, Innocenti attempted to stay relevant by adding ever higher and more individual equipment. Innocenti kept building their own cars until early 1993. Beginning in 1990, when Fiat took over, Innocenti also sold Yugo&#x27;s Koral and Brazilian-sourced versions of the Fiat Uno (Elba station wagon and Uno Mille) in the Italian market. These rebadged models were the last Innocentis; in February 1996 it was announced that sales of the marque would be halted at the end of June 1997.

== 2018 Relaunch ==
The Lambretta scooter was relaunched once again at the EICMA Milan Motorcycle Expo in November 2017. After the purchase of the Lambretta brand by Innocenti SA, now a Swiss consortium, a new scooter model was designed and launched. This was the V-special, available in 50 to 125 to 200cc engine sizes, and designed to meet Euro 4 standards. The scooter was designed in Austria by Austrian firm Kiska but produced in Asia. It saw exports to Australia, Philippines, Europe, the US and the UK. The company plans to reintroduce classic models at a later date. Lambretta is developing production facilities in India, teaming up with Lohia Auto of Noida and the Bird Group of New Delhi. There are plans to launch an electric scooter in 2020.

<doc id="733629" wikidata="Q2885195" url="?curid=733629" title="Battle of Toulouse (1814)">
<text>The Battle of Toulouse took place on April 10, 1814, just four days after Napoleon&#x27;s surrender of the French Empire to the Sixth Coalition, marking one of the final conflicts of the Napoleonic Wars. Having pushed the demoralised and disintegrating French Imperial armies out of Spain in a difficult campaign the previous autumn, the Allied British-Portuguese and Spanish army under the Duke of Wellington pursued the war into southern France in the spring of 1814.

The city of Toulouse, the regional capital, put up a fierce resistance under the command of Marshal Soult, who defended it tenaciously. One British and two Spanish divisions were badly mauled in bloody fighting on 10 April, with Allied losses exceeding French casualties by 3,000. Marshal Soult retreated from Toulouse, leaving behind 1600 wounded soldiers including three generals.

Wellington&#x27;s entry on the morning of 12 April was acclaimed by a great number of French Royalists, validating Soult&#x27;s earlier fears of potential fifth column elements within the city. That afternoon, the official word of Napoleon&#x27;s abdication and the end of the war reached Wellington. Soult agreed to an armistice on 17 April.

==Prelude==
Following their successful invasion of France earlier in the year, an allied army of the Sixth Coalition, composed of British, Portuguese and Spanish troops under the supreme command of the Field Marshal Arthur Wellesley, Marquess of Wellington, laid siege to the city of Toulouse, one of the few remaining urban centres in France still loyal to Napoleon.

The city of Toulouse was garrisoned by around 42,000 French troops, under the command of Marshal Jean-de-Dieu Soult, Duke of Dalmatia. Imperial forces across southern France were greatly demoralised by fighting the Anglo-Allied forces in their own country, and were further shaken by news of repeated Coalition victories in northern and eastern France. Allied campaigning had gradually pushed French forces out of Spain during 1813, after endless guerrilla wars which had resulted in more than 300,000 French casualties between 1808 and late 1813. The French suffered greater losses in manpower in southern France, as Napoleon diverted many southern forces to bolster his troops facing the Coalition armies invading northern and eastern France after an allied victory at Leipzig in October 1813.

==Preliminary operations==

===Orthez===
After Soult&#x27;s defeat by Wellington at the Battle of Orthez in late February 1814, the French Marshal retreated north behind the river Adour to Saint-Sever. Soult was on the horns of a dilemma. He could defend Bordeaux to the north-west or Toulouse to the east, but he could not protect both. The French army would have difficulty obtaining food near Bordeaux and it would place the river Garonne in their rear. Therefore, Soult elected to base himself on Toulouse.

===Bordeaux===
With Soult moving east, Wellington sent Beresford and two divisions to seize Bordeaux, the third-largest city of France. To make up for this subtraction of strength, the British general called up 8000 Spanish infantry and the British heavy cavalry as reinforcements. Fearful that the Spanish would plunder the French countryside and incite a guerrilla war, Wellington put his allies on the British payroll and supply system. Meanwhile, the British-Portuguese-Spanish army pushed the French out of Aire-sur-l&#x27;Adour on 2 March in a skirmish. Soult pulled back to Plaisance and Maubourguet, facing west. A ten-day lull followed, during which time Wellington&#x27;s reinforcements began to arrive.

On 12 March, Beresford captured Bordeaux without resistance. Leaving the 7th Division as a garrison, he rushed back to join Wellington with the 4th Division. Meanwhile, on 17–18 March, in a raid with 100 French cavalrymen, Captain Dauma circled the Allied army&#x27;s south flank and attacked Saint-Sever where he captured 100 men. At the same time, Wellington launched his offensive, hoping to ensnare Soult&#x27;s army. By rapidly marching east to Saint-Gaudens and north-east to Toulouse, the French avoided the British flanking columns. Reaching Toulouse, Soult placed his soldiers behind the city&#x27;s walls and fortifications.

===Initial moves===
On 4April, Wellington&#x27;s engineers threw a pontoon bridge across the flooding Garonne north of the French city. After 19,000 Anglo-Allies crossed, the bridge gave way, trapping the men for three days. But Soult failed to take advantage of his opportunity to defeat Wellington&#x27;s army in detail. On 8April, in a fine charge, the British 18th Hussars under Lieutenant-colonel Sir Henry Murray seized the bridge at Croix d&#x27;Orade on the Hers. Meanwhile, on 7April at midnight, the official couriers left Paris with news that Napoleon had abdicated and that the war was over.

===French defences===

Toulouse lies on the Garonne, which runs into the city from the south-west, then turns and exits to the north-west. Just east of the Garonne, the smaller Hers-Mort (Hers) runs past the city from the south-east to the north-east, forming a narrow corridor. To attack the city from the north, Wellington&#x27;s main force would have to cross to the east bank of the Garonne, then drive south-east down the corridor between the two rivers.

West of the Garonne lies the fortified suburb of St-Cyprien. Marshall Soult&#x27;s defensive perimeter was anchored on the Languedoc Canal to the north, with three strategic bridgeheads at Pont Jumeaux (northwest), Pont des Minimes (north) and Pont de Matabiau (north-east). Each bridge was heavily fortified with a robust redoubt, providing a strong defensive anchor. The Heights of Calvinet (also known as Mont Rave) situated east of the city and west of the Hers River, were fortified with multiple redoubts, forming a formidable defensive stronghold. Marshall Soult&#x27;s forces were deployed strategically across the city. One division held the suburb of St-Cyprien while another defended the canal line. Jean-Pierre Travot&#x27;s conscripts manned the city walls, and Jean Darmagnac&#x27;s division stood between the Heights and the canal. The divisions of Jean Isidore Harispe and Eugene-Casimir Vilatte defended the Heights, with Eloi Taupin&#x27;s division in reserve. Meanwhile, Pierre Soult&#x27;s cavalry screened the eastern and southern approaches. The battlefield, now urbanized, lies within the modern city of Toulouse.

==Battle==
Wellington began his attack on Easter Sunday, 10 April. Hoping to divert some of Soult&#x27;s forces, the British general sent Hill with the 12,600 men of the 2nd Division and Portuguese Division to attack St-Cyprien. The rest of the Anglo-Allied army (36,000) operated east of the Garonne and north of the city. The 3rd Division faced the north-west canal line with the Light Division to the east. Wellington planned to make his major effort against the Heights of Calvinet. Beresford would take the 4th and 6th Divisions and the Hussar brigades down the west bank of the Hers. Once he reached a point east of the city, Beresford would veer west and attack the Heights with the Hussars protecting his south flank. At the same time, Freire would assault the northern end of the Heights with his two Spanish divisions. Two heavy dragoon brigades waited in reserve.

===Initial attacks===
In the western sector, General Hill&#x27;s troops successfully pushed back the French outposts, engaging in a relatively minor skirmish that resulted in approximately 80 casualties for his forces. Exceeding his orders, Thomas Picton mounted a full-scale attack on the Pont Jumeaux with his 3rd Division and was repulsed with 400 casualties. Meanwhile, Beresford&#x27;s men encountered muddy fields and fell behind schedule. Unable to move his artillery, he ordered the cannons to take a position near the northern end of the Heights and open fire. Freire, thinking this was the signal for the combined attack, sent his men to assault the Heights. The Spanish infantry forged uphill and gained a momentary foothold in a road cut, but they were counter-attacked by a cloud of French skirmishers and soon sent fleeing. Covered by the Light Division, the Spanish foot soldiers rallied, then attacked and were defeated a second time.

===Taking the heights===
At last, Beresford&#x27;s two Anglo-Portuguese divisions reached their jumping off positions, with the 6th Division leading. A French division counter-attacked, but was easily driven uphill. &quot;A shower of Congreve rockets at very close range threw the French into disorder; Rey&#x27;s Brigade was routed and this, in turn, caused Gasquet&#x27;s Brigade to fall back in disorder&quot; The Allied divisions began to advance up the slope. They fought their way to the top of the Heights despite bitter resistance, then paused to drag up some cannon. Swinging to the north, they began rolling up the French defences. Beresford&#x27;s men captured two redoubts, lost them to a counterattack and finally seized them again after bringing the 4th Division forward. The heights being lost, Soult withdrew his soldiers behind the city&#x27;s fortifications.

==Aftermath==
Soult maintained control of Toulouse throughout the day on April 11, but upon observing Allied cavalry advancing along the Toulouse-Carcassonne road, he made the strategic decision to withdraw his forces from the city. At 9 pm that evening, the French withdrew out of Toulouse by the Carcassonne road.

On the morning of 12 April, a delegation of city officials handed over the city to the Allied army. That afternoon, Wellington got news via Bordeaux from Frederick Ponsonby of Napoleon&#x27;s abdication. A few hours later in the evening, this was confirmed when the official couriers arrived from Paris. Wellington sent them on at once to Soult.

===Casualties===
The Allied army suffered 4,558 casualties, including 1,900 from Freire&#x27;s divisions and 1,500 from the 6th Division. Brigade commanders Denis Pack, James Douglas, and Thomas Brisbane were wounded. French casualties numbered 231 officers and 3,005 privates, including Taupin killed.

===Armistice===
On 13 April, while on his march from Villefranche to Castelnaudary, the Marshal was caught up by the officers from Paris. They were met with a rebuff – Soult declared himself not convinced of the authenticity of their credentials. He stubbornly refused to recognize the provisional government until he had received what he considered conclusive proof of its legitimacy. Upon receiving Soult&#x27;s refusal to recognize the Provisional Government, Wellington responded on April 14, stating that no armistice would be granted until Soult submitted to the new authority. Wellington&#x27;s message implied that he suspected Soult of seeking to maintain control over his army for potential Napoleonic machinations. By 15 April, Marshal Suchet at Perpignan had accepted the evidence, placed himself at the disposition of the new government and asked Wellington for an armistice.

The last major action of the war occurred on 14 April at the Battle of Bayonne, when the French commander Thouvenot led a &quot;sortie&quot; from the besieged city against the Allied lines.

On 17 April, Soult at last received a dispatch from Berthier which formally announced the Emperor&#x27;s abdication and consequent cessation of hostilities in all quarters. There was nothing more to be done and, the same day, his chief of staff went to Toulouse to sign an armistice, ending the fight in the south. The city was briefly placed under Coalition control during the summer of 1814, with the withdrawal of allied troops in September.

==Commentary==
Both British and French historians claimed victory in the Battle of Toulouse, with differing perspectives on the outcome. The French argued that they had achieved a strategic success, as Wellington failed to trap and defeat the French army, and Soult&#x27;s intention was only to delay the British while planning to unite with Marshal Suchet&#x27;s forces and launch a counterattack. From the French viewpoint, the capture of Toulouse was a hollow triumph, as their army remained intact despite ceding ground, and Wellington&#x27;s forces suffered significant casualties and depleted their supplies. The British claimed victory because Toulouse ended up in their hands and the French were forced to give up ground. In addition, the British took one gun on the heights and the French abandoned others when they left Toulouse (the taking or loss of guns being often taken by contemporaries as a sign of victory or defeat).

<text>Peng () or Dapeng () is a giant bird that transforms from a Kun () giant fish in Chinese mythology.

==Names==
The Chinese logograms for &quot;peng&quot; and &quot;kun&quot; exemplify common radical-phonetic characters. &quot;Peng&quot; (鵬) combines the &quot;bird radical&quot; () with a &quot;peng&quot; ( &quot;friend&quot;) phonetic, and &quot;kun&quot; (鯤; 鲲) combines the &quot;fish radical&quot; () with a &quot;kun&quot; ( &quot;progeny; insect&quot;) phonetic.

Both the mythic Chinese &quot;Peng&quot; and &quot;Kun&quot; names involve word play. &quot;Peng&quot; () was anciently a variant Chinese character for &quot;feng&quot; () in &quot;fenghuang&quot; (鳳凰 &quot;Chinese phoenix&quot; ca. 100 CE &quot;Shuowen Jiezi&quot;); &quot;Kun&quot; originally meant &quot;fish roe; fry; spawn&quot; (ca. 200 BCE &quot;Erya&quot;).

Synonyms of Peng include Dapeng (大鵬 &quot;Big Peng&quot;, &quot;Great Peng&quot;) and Dapengniao (大鵬鳥 &quot;Great Peng Bird&quot;). Dapeng is also a place name for a few places in greater China, most notably in Shenzhen and Taiwan.

After recent fossil discoveries in northeast China, Chinese paleontologists used Peng to name the enantiornithine bird &quot;Pengornis&quot; and the wukongopterid pterosaur &quot;Kunpengopterus&quot;.

==Literature==

=== Zhuangzi ===
In Chinese literature, the Daoist classic &quot;Zhuangzi&quot; has the oldest record of the Kun Peng myth. The first chapter (&quot;Free and Easy Wandering&quot; 逍遙遊 pinyin &quot;xiāoyáoyóu&quot;) begins with three versions of this parable; the lead paragraph, a quote from the &quot;Qixie&quot; (齊諧 &quot;Universal Harmony&quot;, probably invented by Zhuangzi), and a quote from the &quot;Tang zhi wen Ji&quot; (湯之問棘 &quot;Questions of Tang to Ji&quot;, cf. &quot;Liezi&quot; chapter 5, &quot;Tang wen&quot; 湯問). The first account contrasts the giant Peng bird with a small &quot;tiao&quot; (蜩 &quot;cicada&quot;) and &quot;jiu&quot; (鳩 &quot;pigeon; turtledove&quot;) and the third with a &quot;yan&quot; (鴳 or 鷃 &quot;quail&quot;). The Peng fish-bird transformation is not only the beginning myth in &quot;Zhuangzi&quot;, but Robert Allinson claims, &quot;the central myth&quot;.
=== Analysis and interpretations ===
Many &quot;Zhuangzi&quot; scholars have debated the Peng story. Lian Xinda calls it &quot;arguably the most controversial image in the text, which has been inviting conflicting interpretations for the past seventeen centuries.&quot;

In traditional Chinese scholarship, the standard Peng interpretation was the &quot;equality theory&quot; of Guo Xiang (d. 312 CE), who redacted and annotated the received &quot;Zhuangzi&quot; text. Guo&#x27;s commentary said,

Some Chinese scholars gave alternate interpretations. The Buddhist monk Zhi Dun (314-366 CE) associated the Peng&#x27;s flight with the highest satisfaction achieved by the &quot;zhiren&quot; (至人 &quot;perfect person; sage; saint&quot;, cf. &quot;zhenren&quot;).

The Chan Buddhist master Hanshan Deqing (憨山德清, 1546–1623) also declares the Peng is the image of the Daoist sage, and suggests the bird&#x27;s flight does not result from the piling up of wind but from the deep piling up of &quot;de&quot; &quot;virtue; power&quot;.

In modern scholarship, some scholars reject Guo&#x27;s &quot;equality theory&quot; construal. Lian differentiates contemporary interpretations between whether Zhuangzi was a radical skeptic and/or a relativist.

Julian Pas concurs that &quot;the true sage is compared to the enormous bird.&quot; Angus Charles Graham sees the Peng as &quot;soaring above the restricted viewpoints of the worldly.&quot; Allinson finds it &quot;very clear and very explicit that the standpoint of the big bird and the standpoint of the cicada and the dove are not seen as possessing equal value.&quot; Karen Carr and Philip J. Ivanhoe find &quot;positive ideals&quot; in the Peng symbolizing the &quot;mythical creature that rises above the more mundane concerns of the word. Brian Lundberg says Zhuangzi uses the image to urge us to &quot;go beyond restricted &quot;small&quot; points of views.&quot; Eric Schwitzgebel interprets, &quot;Being small creatures, we cannot understand great things like the Peng (and the rest of the &quot;Zhuangzi&quot;?).&quot; Steve Coutinho describes the Peng as a &quot;recluse who wanders beyond the realm of the recognizable&quot;, in contrast the tiny birds that &quot;cannot begin to understand what lies so utterly beyond the confines of their mundane experience.&quot; Scott Cook writes, &quot;We are, at first, led by Zhuangzi almost imperceptibly into an unreflective infatuation with the bird.&quot; Lian concludes the Peng is &quot;An inspiring example of soaring up and going beyond, the image is used to broaden the outlook of the small mind; its function is thus more therapeutic than instructional.&quot; Bryan W. Van Norden suggests, &quot;The likely effect of this passage on the reader is a combination of awe and disorientation.&quot;

Zhuangzi&#x27;s Peng bird became a famous literary metaphor. Two early examples were the &quot;Shen yi jing&quot; (神異經 &quot;Classic of Divine Marvels&quot;) by Dongfang Shuo (154 BCE – 93 CE) and the &quot;Commentary on the Water Classic&quot; (水經注).

=== Comparisons ===
In comparative mythology of giant creatures, Peng is similar to the Roc or Garuda and Kun to the Leviathan.

==Notable people named Peng (鵬/鹏)==
&quot;Peng&quot; linguistically symbolizes &quot;greatness; great promise; great accomplishments&quot;; for instance, the idiom &quot;péng chéng wàn lǐ&quot; (鵬程萬里, literally, the Peng journeys 10,000 &quot;li&quot;) means &quot;have a bright/unlimited future&quot;. This character is commonly used in Chinese given names and several important mainland Chinese, Hong Kong and Taiwanese politicians have &quot;Peng&quot; in their given names. In contrast, the character &quot;Kun&quot; (鯤/鲲) is seldom used.

<text>Baja California Sur is a state in Northwest Mexico divided into five municipalities. According to the 2020 Mexican census, Baja California Sur is the second least populous state with inhabitants and the 11th largest by land area, spanning .

Municipalities in Baja California Sur are administratively autonomous of the state according to the 115th article of the 1917 Constitution of Mexico. Every three years, citizens elect a municipal president (Spanish: &quot;presidente municipal&quot;) by a plurality voting system who heads a concurrently elected municipal council (&quot;ayuntamiento&quot;) responsible for providing all the public services for their constituents. The municipal council consists of a variable number of trustees and councillors (&quot;regidores y síndicos&quot;). Municipalities are responsible for public services (such as water and sewerage), street lighting, public safety, traffic, and the maintenance of public parks, gardens and cemeteries. They may also assist the state and federal governments in education, emergency fire and medical services, environmental protection and maintenance of monuments and historical landmarks. Since 1984, they have had the power to collect property taxes and user fees, although more funds are obtained from the state and federal governments than from their own income.

The largest municipality by population in Baja California Sur is Los Cabos, with 351,111 residents, and the smallest is Loreto with 18,052 residents. The largest municipality by area in Baja California Sur and second largest in Mexico is Mulegé, which spans , while Los Cabos is the smallest at . The first municipality to incorporate was Loreto on , and the newest municipality is Los Cabos which incorporated .

<text>Surf (known as Sunil in the Netherlands) is a British brand of laundry detergent manufactured and marketed around the world by Unilever, except in the United States, Canada and Puerto Rico, where it has been owned by Sun Products (now Henkel North American Consumer Goods) since 2008.

The brand was introduced in 1952 by Crosfields of Warrington, a subsidiary company of Lever Brothers in the United Kingdom. Surf was introduced in the United States in 1959 after Rinso, which had been Lever Brothers Company&#x27;s lead laundry brand, had declined in sales and market share.

Between 1994 and 2001, &quot;Birds of a Feather&quot; stars Pauline Quirke and Linda Robson appeared in a series of adverts which saw them in a variety of different scenarios. 

In 1998, January Isaac played Lumen in their &#x27;Wais&#x27; commercials series in the Philippines; other characters were Lola Obang (Nina Medina) and her son Lando (Nap Miranda) and their twins Ana and Maria (played by Charice and Charlotte Hermoso from 2004 to 2007).

Present in the Brazilian market since 2003, soap powder is currently sold in the following fragrances: Rosas and Flor de Lis; Hydrangeas and White Flowers; Passion Flower and Daisy; and Cherry Blossom and Lavender. It is also available in the form of liquid soap, in the version Jasmine do Oriente and Flor de Lotus. The Tablet version (Bar) was no longer manufactured in July 2010.

In Portugal and the UK, the powder is currently marketed with the &quot;Tropical Lilies &amp; Ylang Ylang&quot; fragrances. In both countries it is also available in pre-dosed &quot;capsules&quot;.

<text>The Mercury Tracer is a compact car that was marketed by Mercury from the 1987 to 1999 model years. The replacement for the Mercury Lynx, the Tracer was also sold as a three-door and five-door hatchback and a five-door station wagon; a four-door sedan was introduced for the second generation. Three generations of the model line were produced, with the second two serving as the counterpart of the Ford Escort. 

The first Mercury-brand vehicle since 1960 without a direct Ford counterpart in North America, the first-generation Tracer was developed by Mazda. For its entire production, the model line (including two generations of the Escort) was derived from the Mazda 323/Protegé. 

Mercury discontinued sales of the Tracer following the 1999 model year, as Ford began to replace the Escort with the Ford Focus for 2000. With no counterpart of the Focus, Mercury exited the compact segment. A fourth-generation of the model line was initially developed for a 2012 launch, but the project was stillborn following the 2010 closure of the Mercury brand. 


==First generation (1987–1989)==

For 1987, Mercury introduced the Tracer to replace the Mercury Lynx as its subcompact model range. The first Mercury since its 1960 full-size range to not share any commonality with Ford in North America, the Tracer was derived from the Ford Laser (itself, a variant of the Mazda 323); sold in Asia-Pacific markets in place of the Ford Escort, the Laser had been redesigned in 1985. The first Tracers went on sale in Canada in early October 1986. In the United States, the model line went on sale in March 1987 and would be sold alongside the Lynx until the end of the model year. 

The first Mercury assembled outside of North America, all Canadian examples of the Tracer (three-door and five-door hatchbacks) were sourced from Ford Lio Ho in Taiwan. Vehicles for the United States (three-door and five-door hatchbacks, along with the station wagon) were sourced from Hermosillo Stamping &amp; Assembly in Mexico. The Tracer had nearly no United States parts content and as such did not count towards lowering Ford&#x27;s Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE). 

The first-generation Tracer was sold through the 1989 model year, coinciding with the model cycle of its Laser counterpart. Mexican assembly ended in August 1989, with late examples sold as &quot;89 1/2&quot; models into calendar year 1990; in spite of the cancellation, Tracer sales in the United States actually picked up in model year 1989. In Canada, Tracer imports ended during 1989, with sales slowing to a trickle by the end of the year. 5,489 Tracers were sold in Canada in calendar year 1988, followed by 1,775 cars in 1989. 

=== Chassis ===
The Mercury Tracer is an American counterpart of the Australian-market Ford Laser KE, also sold in Japan, Asia, and South Africa. While sharing a slightly different body, the Laser shared a common chassis with the front-wheel drive Mazda 323, designated the Mazda BF platform. 

A 1.6-litre B6 inline-four from the 323 was offered with the Tracer. For Canadian-market examples, a 71-hp carbureted engine was offered, with an 84-hp fuel-injected engine offered in the United States. A 5-speed manual was standard, with a 3-speed automatic offered as an option.

=== Body ===
In line with its Lynx predecessor, the Tracer was offered as in 3-door and 5-door hatchback configurations. For the United States, a five-door station wagon was introduced for 1988. 

The Tracer shared its exterior with the Ford Laser, distinguished by a Mercury grille, badging, and wheel covers. Along with the use of clear-lens front marker lights, slight revisions were made to the hatchback and station wagon liftgate (the station wagon, sharing nearly identical sheetmetal with the 323 wagon). 

In line with the previous Lynx (along with the larger Topaz, Sable, and Grand Marquis), the Tracer offered GS and LS trims (in addition to a base L trim). 

==Second generation (1991–1996)==
After skipping the 1990 model year altogether, Lincoln-Mercury released the second-generation Mercury Tracer in early 1990 as an early 1991 model. In a major change, the American Ford Escort also adopted the design of the Ford Laser alongside the Tracer, with all three model lines now derived from the Mazda 323 and the renamed Mazda Protegé. The new generation grew in size, moving to the compact-car segment. 

Again sold in the United States and Canada (the latter, from 1991 to 1993), all assembly of the model line was initially consolidated at Hermosillo Stamping, with Wayne Stamping &amp; Assembly in Michigan added in 1991. North American parts content was considerably higher than for the preceding generation. 

The Mercury Tracer LTS was named to &quot;Car and Driver&quot; magazine&#x27;s Ten Best list for 1991. 

=== Chassis ===
The second-generation Tracer is derived from the front-wheel drive Mazda BG platform (officially designated the Ford CT120 platform), sharing a 98.4-inch wheelbase with the Escort and Protegé. 

An 1.9-liter CVH inline-four is the standard engine (shared with the Escort). From 1991 to 1994, a 127-hp 1.8-liter Mazda BP inline-four (shared with the Ford Escort GT and Mazda Protegé LX) was offered. A 5-speed manual was standard with both engines, with a 4-speed automatic offered with the 1.9L engine. 

===Body===
The second-generation Tracer was offered in two configurations: a four-door sedan and a five-door station wagon; though offered by Ford for the Escort, the two hatchbacks were discontinued for the Tracer (a station wagon was not offered by Mazda). Sharing almost no body panels with the Protegé (aside from visibly shared door stampings), the Tracer shared a large degree of commonality with the Laser and Escort, differing primarily in the design of its grille, clear-lens parking lamps, and full-width taillamps (in the style of the Cougar and Grand Marquis). 

Throughout the second-generation Tracer&#x27;s production run, only two trim levels were available: an unnamed base model sedan and wagon, and the LTS (Luxury Touring Sedan), which served as the flagship of the model range. Largely the counterpart of the Ford Escort LX-E (the four-door equivalent to the Ford Escort GT), the LTS was powered by a Mazda 1.8-liter engine; the LTS was produced through the 1996 model year. For 1994, a &quot;Trio&quot; package became available on the base Tracer sedan and wagon. The Trio package featured a leather-wrapped steering wheel, 7-spoke aluminum wheels (Shared with the Ford Escort LX Sport) and a &quot;Trio&quot; decal on each fender; Tracer sedans with the Trio package also featured rear decklid spoilers. The package continued to be available through 1996. 

During its production, the second-generation Tracer saw few external changes. For 1991, the base model Tracer sedan and wagon were styled with a body-color front grille, while the LTS featured a light-bar grille; the base model received the LTS&#x27;s grille for 1993. For 1994, the Tracer was given a drivers&#x27; side airbag as a passive restraint; for 1995, the passenger airbag was added, requiring a redesign of the dashboard, however, the automatic seat belts retained through 1996.

==Third generation (1997–1999)==

For 1997, the third-generation Mercury Tracer was released, sharing its redesign alongside the third-generation Ford Escort. Retaining the same Mazda-based chassis underpinnings from the previous generation, the body was all-new with substantial revisions to the powertrain. No longer related to the Ford Laser (which had followed the design updates of the Mazda Protegé since 1994), the third-generation Tracer was derived solely from the Ford Escort. 

This generation is the only version to be assembled entirely in the United States, with all assembly consolidated at Wayne Stamping &amp; Assembly in Wayne, Michigan. Following the 1999 model year, the Tracer was withdrawn (along with the Escort station wagon). For 1999, 23,146 examples were sold. The final Mercury Tracer rolled off the assembly line on July 2, 1999. 

=== Chassis ===
The third-generation Tracer is derived from the front-wheel drive Ford CT120 platform, used again by Ford, sharing the same 98.4-inch wheelbase as the previous generation. The sole engine is a 2.0-litre CVH Split-Port Induction (SPI) inline-four, paired with either a 5-speed manual or a 4-speed automatic transmission. 

=== Body ===
The third-generation Tracer again was offered in four-door sedan and five-door station wagon configurations; hatchbacks had been withdrawn entirely. The Ford Escort ZX2 two-door coupe bodystyle (sharing the chassis, but no body panels of the sedan/wagon) was not offered as a Mercury Tracer. As with the previous generation, the model line was distinguished from its Ford counterpart by its front fascia design, taillamps, and model-specific wheelcovers. The station wagon shared much of its bodyshell from the previous generation (from the windshield rearward), with updates concentrated on the front fascia, sideview mirrors, door handles, interior dashboard, and exterior badging. 

As with previous generations, the third-generation Tracer was sold in GS and LS trims, with Mercury also offering a Trio appearance package for the GS. The LS trim was distinguished by alloy wheels, leather interior, keyless entry, power windows and door locks, and tachometer. 

== Proposed 2011 revival ==
Shortly before the closure of the Mercury division, Ford had been working on a revival of the Mercury Tracer model line. In early 2010, Ford confirmed its 2012 model lines with its dealers that year, with Mercury adding a compact sedan derived from the redesigned 2012 Ford Focus. Slotted below the Mercury Milan in size, the Focus-derived Mercury was unofficially confirmed to have the Mercury Tracer nameplate (ending a 13-year hiatus). The new compact would have allowed Mercury to retain two sedan lines for 2012; at the time, the Mercury Grand Marquis was intended for discontinuation after 2011.

In the summer of 2010, the model line development ended as Ford announced the closure of the Mercury division at the end of the calendar year.

<text>In geometry, the mean width is a measure of the &quot;size&quot; of a body; see Hadwiger&#x27;s theorem for more about the available measures of bodies. In formula_1 dimensions, one has to consider formula_2-dimensional hyperplanes perpendicular to a given direction formula_3 in formula_4, where formula_5 is the n-sphere (the surface of a formula_6-dimensional sphere).
The &quot;width&quot; of a body in a given direction formula_3 is the distance between the closest pair of such planes, such that the body is entirely in between the two hyper planes (the planes only intersect 
with the boundary of the body). The mean width is the average of this &quot;width&quot; over all formula_3 in formula_4.

More formally, define a compact body B as being equivalent to set of points in its interior plus the points on the boundary (here, points denote elements of formula_10). The support function of body B is defined as

: formula_11

where formula_1 is a direction and formula_13 denotes the usual inner product on formula_10. The mean width is then

: formula_15

where formula_16 is the formula_2-dimensional volume of formula_4.
Note, that the mean width can be defined for any body (that is compact), but it is most
useful for convex bodies (that is bodies, whose corresponding set is a convex set).

==Mean widths of convex bodies in low dimensions==
===One dimension===
The mean width of a line segment &quot;L&quot; is the length (1-volume) of &quot;L&quot;.

===Two dimensions===
The mean width &quot;w&quot; of any compact shape &quot;S&quot; in two dimensions is &quot;p&quot;/π, where &quot;p&quot; is the perimeter of the convex hull of &quot;S&quot;. So &quot;w&quot; is the diameter of a circle with the same perimeter as the convex hull.

===Three dimensions===
For convex bodies &quot;K&quot; in three dimensions, the mean width of &quot;K&quot; is related to the average of the mean curvature, &quot;H&quot;, over the whole surface of &quot;K&quot;. In fact,

: formula_19

where formula_20 is the boundary of the convex body formula_21 and formula_22
a surface integral element, formula_23 is the mean curvature at the corresponding position
on formula_20. Similar relations can be given between the other measures 
and the generalizations of the mean curvature, also for other dimensions 
As the integral over the mean curvature is typically much easier to calculate
than the mean width, this is a very useful result.

*Curve of constant width

==Further reading==

The mean width is usually mentioned in any good reference on convex geometry, for instance, &quot;Selected topics in convex geometry&quot; by Maria Moszyńska (Birkhäuser, Boston 2006). The relation between the mean width and the mean curvature is also derived in that reference.

The application of the mean width as one of the measures featuring in Hadwiger&#x27;s theorem
is discussed in Beifang Chen in &quot;A simplified elementary proof of Hadwiger&#x27;s volume theorem.&quot; &quot;Geom. Dedicata&quot; 105 (2004), 107—120.</text><links>

<text>Superfast is a studio album by the rock band Dynamite Hack, released in 2000.

The album peaked at No. 84 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200.

==Production==
The album was produced by David Eaton. A remixed version of the &quot;Boyz-N-The-Hood&quot; cover appears on the album, after Dr. Dre asked the band to remove certain words.

==Critical reception==
&quot;The Austin Chronicle&quot; called the album &quot;supersheeny corporate punk.&quot; The &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; wrote: &quot;Call ‘em Blink-91—a cut-rate, half-price take on Blink-182’s melodic power-punk, minus the puerile wit and deceptively smart commentary (in other words, the character).&quot; &quot;Texas Monthly&quot; deemed the album &quot;the smartest power pop to break out of Texas in years.&quot; &quot;Style Weekly&quot; wrote that &quot;bubble-gum punk, pseudo-rap, and watered-down &#x27;alternative&#x27; rock are all present.&quot; &quot;The Morning Call&quot; considered it &quot;slightly above-average pop-punk that plays with dynamics more than usual, though not enough to transcend the overdone and tired genre.&quot;

&quot;The Village Voice&quot; chose the band&#x27;s cover of &quot;Boyz-N-The-Hood&quot; as the 46th worst song of the 2000s.

<doc id="733657" wikidata="Q1674806" url="?curid=733657" title="Carry On Cleo">
<text>Carry On Cleo is a 1964 British historical comedy film, the tenth in the series of 31 &quot;Carry On&quot; films (1958–1992). Regulars Sid James, Kenneth Williams, Kenneth Connor, Charles Hawtrey, and Jim Dale are present and Connor made his last appearance until his return in &quot;Carry On Up the Jungle&quot; six years later. Joan Sims returned to the series for the first time since &quot;Carry On Regardless&quot; three years earlier. Sims would now appear in every &quot;Carry On&quot; up to &quot;Carry On Emmannuelle&quot; in 1978, making her the most prolific actress in the series. Jon Pertwee makes the first of his four appearances in the series. The title role is played by Amanda Barrie in her second and last Carry On. Along with &quot;Carry On Sergeant&quot; and &quot;Carry On Screaming!&quot;, its original posters were reproduced by the Royal Mail on stamps to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the &quot;Carry On&quot; series in June 2008. The film was followed by &quot;Carry On Cowboy&quot; (1965).

It is often regarded as the best in the series.
==Plot==

The film opens during Caesar&#x27;s invasions of Britain, with Mark Antony (Sid James) struggling to lead his armies through miserable weather. At a nearby village, cavemen Horsa (Jim Dale) and Hengist Pod (Kenneth Connor) attempt to alert Boudica to the invasion, but are captured by the Romans.

Once in Rome, Horsa is sold by the slave-trading firm Marcus et Spencius, and Hengist is destined to be thrown to the lions when no-one agrees to buy him. Horsa and Hengist escape and take refuge in the Temple of Vesta. Whilst hiding there, Julius Caesar (Kenneth Williams) arrives to consult the Vestal Virgins, but an attempt is made on his life by his bodyguard, Bilius (David Davenport). In the melee, Horsa kills Bilius and escapes, leaving Hengist to take the credit for saving Caesar&#x27;s life and to be made Caesar&#x27;s new bodyguard.

When a power struggle emerges in Egypt, Mark Antony is sent to force Cleopatra (Amanda Barrie) to abdicate in favour of Ptolemy. However, Mark Antony becomes besotted with her, and instead kills Ptolemy off-screen to win her favour. Cleopatra convinces Mark Antony to kill Caesar and become ruler of Rome himself so that they may rule a powerful Roman-Egyptian alliance together. After seducing one another, Mark Antony agrees, and plots to kill Caesar.

Caesar and Hengist travel to Egypt on a galley, along with Agrippa (Francis de Wolff), whom Mark Antony has convinced to kill Caesar. However, Horsa has been re-captured and is now a slave on Caesar&#x27;s galley. After killing the galley-master (Peter Gilmore), Horsa and the galley slaves kill Agrippa and his fellow assassins and swim to Egypt. Hengist, who had been sent out to fight Agrippa and was unaware of Horsa&#x27;s presence on board, again takes the credit.

Once at Cleopatra&#x27;s palace, an Egyptian soothsayer (Jon Pertwee) warns Caesar of the plot to kill him, but Mark Anthony convinces Caesar not to flee. Instead, Caesar convinces Hengist to change places with him, since Cleopatra and Caesar have never met. On meeting, Cleopatra lures Hengist, who accidentally exposes both Cleopatra and Mark Anthony as would-be assassins. He and Caesar then ally with Horsa, and after defeating Cleopatra&#x27;s bodyguard Sosages (Tom Clegg) in combat, Hengist and the party flee Egypt. Caesar is returned to Rome, only to be assassinated on the Ides of March. Horsa and Hengist return to Britain, and Mark Antony is left in Egypt to live &quot;one long Saturday night&quot; with Cleopatra.

==Background notes==

The costumes and sets used in the film were originally intended for &quot;Cleopatra&quot; (1963) at Pinewood Studios before that production moved to Rome and rebuilt new sets there. &quot;Carry On Cleo&quot; was filmed between 13 July and 28 August 1964.

The original poster and publicity artwork by Tom Chantrell were withdrawn from circulation after 20th Century Fox successfully brought a copyright infringement case against distributor Anglo Amalgamated, which found the design was based on a painting by Howard Terpning for which Fox owned the copyright and was used to promote the Cleopatra film.

==Reception==
The film premiered at London&#x27;s Warner cinema on 10 December 1964 and went on to become one of the 12 most popular movies at the British box office in 1965.

Colin McCabe, Professor of English at the University of Exeter, labelled this film (together with &quot;Carry On Up the Khyber&quot;) as one of the best films of all time.

In 2007, the pun &quot;Infamy, infamy, they&#x27;ve all got it in for me&quot;, spoken by Kenneth Williams, was voted the funniest one-line joke in film history. The line was not written by Rothwell but borrowed with permission from a &quot;Take It from Here&quot; script written by Frank Muir and Denis Norden.

In a 2018 retrospective on the series, the British Film Institute named &quot;Carry On Cleo&quot; as one of the series&#x27; five best films, alongside &quot;Carry On Screaming&quot; (1966), &quot;Carry On Up the Khyber&quot; (1968), &quot;Carry On Camping&quot; (1969), and &quot;Carry On Matron&quot; (1972).

She has performed in both plays and musicals in London&#x27;s theatre scene, and her Broadway debut in &quot;Entertaining Mr. Sloane&quot; (1966) earned her a Tony Award nomination for Best Lead Actress in a Play. 

She won a Laurence Olivier Award for Best Performance in a Supporting Role in a Musical for her role in &quot;Cabaret&quot; (2007) and was nominated at the Laurence Olivier Awards five other times for her work in &quot;Annie&quot; (1978), &quot;Sweeney Todd&quot; (1980), &quot;The Winter&#x27;s Tale&quot; (1982), &quot;Prin&quot; (1989) and &quot;Sister Act&quot; (2010).

In film and television, her credits include &quot;Carry On Cleo&quot; (1964), &quot;The Wildcats of St Trinian&#x27;s&quot; (1980), &quot;Buster&quot; (1988), &quot;Three Men and a Little Lady&quot; (1990), &quot;The Boy in the Striped Pyjamas&quot; (2008) and &quot;Edie&quot; (2017). She was twice nominated for the British Academy Television Award for Best Actress for &quot;The Russian Bride&quot; (2001) and &quot;Bedtime&quot; (2002). 

==Early life and education ==
Sheila Cameron Hancock was born on 22 February 1933 in Blackgang on the Isle of Wight, the daughter of Enrico Cameron Hancock and Ivy Louise (née Woodward). Her sister Billie was seven years older. After Enrico and Ivy left the hospitality industry in 1938, the Hancocks moved to a semi-detached house in Latham Road, Bexleyheath, which Hancock considered dull compared to &quot;the rough and tumble&quot; of King&#x27;s Cross. She later recalled that there was a sense that &quot;we had definitely gone up in the world... became lower-middle-class&quot;.

Hancock was educated at St Etheldreda&#x27;s Convent at Ely Place, Holborn, then at Upton Road Junior School and Upland Junior School. After wartime evacuation to Wallingford, Oxfordshire (at that time in Berkshire) and to Crewkerne, Somerset, Hancock attended Dartford County Grammar School.

Hancock furthered her acting education at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art (RADA), graduating in 1952 with an Acting (RADA Diploma).

== Theatre ==
Hancock worked in repertory during the 1950s and made her West End debut in 1958, replacing Joan Sims in the play &quot;Breath of Spring&quot;. She then appeared in Joan Littlewood&#x27;s Theatre Workshop production of &quot;Make Me An Offer&quot; in 1959, and her other early West End appearances included Peter Cook&#x27;s revue &quot;One Over the Eight&quot; with Kenneth Williams in 1961, and starring in &quot;Rattle of a Simple Man&quot; in 1962. She recalled that in &quot;One over the Eight&quot; she had been egged on by Irving Davies&#x27;s exhortation as dance captain, &quot;Eyes, teeth, and tits, darlings – and sparkle, sparkle, sparkle!&quot;

In 1965, Hancock made her Broadway debut in &quot;Entertaining Mr Sloane&quot;. In 1978, she played Miss Hannigan in the original London cast of the musical &quot;Annie&quot; at the Victoria Palace Theatre and two years later, she played Mrs Lovett in the original London production of the musical &quot;Sweeney Todd&quot; at the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane; her portrayal was described as having &quot;caught the love-story element perfectly.&quot;

Hancock has appeared in &quot;The Winter&#x27;s Tale&quot;, &quot;Titus Andronicus&quot; and &quot;A Delicate Balance&quot; for the Royal Shakespeare Company (RSC). At the National Theatre she has appeared in Neil Bartlett&#x27;s &quot;In Extremis/ De Profundis&quot;, &quot;The Cherry Orchard&quot; and &quot;The Duchess of Malfi&quot;. She was also the first woman director of the RSC touring company, directing &quot;A Midsummer Night&#x27;s Dream&quot; and was the first woman to direct in the Olivier Theatre at the National Theatre with &quot;The Critic&quot;. She was also associate artistic director of the Cambridge Theatre Company.

Hancock took the role of Rose in the West Yorkshire Playhouse&#x27;s 1993 production of &quot;Gypsy&quot;; a reviewer commented that she &quot;certainly had the measure of Rose... &#x27;Everything&#x27;s coming up roses&#x27; brought the first hint of true pathos into the show&quot;, while in the final scene &quot;her wild fluctuations between self-belief and self-doubt ended in tear-jerking self-awareness&quot;.

In 2006, Hancock played the role of Fräulein Schneider in the West End revival of the musical &quot;Cabaret&quot; at the Lyric Theatre. She won the Laurence Olivier Award, and the Clarence Derwent Award, for Best Performance in a Supporting Role in a Musical.

<text>The standard 52-card deck of French-suited playing cards is the most common pack of playing cards used today. The main feature of most playing card decks that empower their use in diverse games and other activities is their double-sided design, where one side, usually bearing a colourful or complex pattern, is exactly identical on all playing cards, thus ensuring the anonymity and fungibility of the cards when their value is to be kept secret, and a second side, that, when apparent, is unique to every individual card in a deck, usually bearing a suit as well as an alphanumerical value, which may be used to distinguish the card in game mechanics. In English-speaking countries it is the only traditional pack used for playing cards; in many countries, however, it is used alongside other traditional, often older, standard packs with different suit systems such as those with German-, Italian-, Spanish- or Swiss suits. The most common pattern of French-suited cards worldwide and the only one commonly available in English-speaking countries is the English pattern pack. The second most common is the Belgian-Genoese pattern, designed in France, but whose use spread to Spain, Italy, the Ottoman Empire, the Balkans and much of North Africa and the Middle East. In addition to those, there are other major international and regional patterns including standard 52-card packs, for example, in Italy that use Italian-suited cards. In other regions, such as Spain and Switzerland, the traditional standard pack comprises 36, 40 or 48 cards. 

== Composition ==
A standard 52-card French-suited deck comprises 13 ranks in each of the four suits: clubs (), diamonds (), hearts () and spades (). Each suit includes three court cards (face cards), King, Queen and Jack, with reversible (i.e. double headed) images. Each suit also includes ten numeral cards or pip cards, from one (Ace) to ten. The card with one pip is known as an Ace. Each pip card displays the number of pips (symbols of the suit) corresponding to its number, as well as the appropriate numeral (except &quot;A&quot; for the Ace) in at least two corners.

In addition, commercial decks often include from one to six Jokers; most commonly two or three since the mid-20th century. The Jokers are often distinguishable from one another, either in design or colour, as some card games require these extra cards. The Jokers can also be used as replacements for lost or damaged cards.

There are exactly 52! or 80,658,175,170,943,878,571,660,636,856,403,766,975,289,505,440,883,277,824,000,000,000,000 (approximately 8) possible arrangements of a standard 52-card deck.

== Design ==
The most popular standard pattern of the French deck is the &quot;English pattern&quot; (pictured above), sometimes referred to as the &quot;International pattern&quot; or &quot;Anglo-American pattern&quot;. The second most common is the Belgian-Genoese pattern, which was designed in France for export and spread to Spain, Italy, the Ottoman Empire, the Balkans and much of North Africa and the Middle East. There are also numerous others such as the &quot;Berlin pattern&quot;, &quot;Nordic pattern&quot;, &quot;Dondorf Rhineland&quot; pattern (pictured right) and the variants of the &quot;European pattern&quot;.

Modern playing cards carry index labels on opposite corners or in all four to facilitate identifying the cards when they overlap and so that they appear identical for players on opposite sides. For the Ace and court cards, this label is the initial letter or letters of the name of that card. In English-speaking countries they are lettered A, K, Q and J for Ace, King, Queen and Jack. In other countries the letters may vary, although the English versions are also sometimes used. Germany uses A, K, D and B (&quot;Ass&quot;, &quot;König&quot;, &quot;Dame&quot; and &quot;Bube&quot;); Russia uses the Cyrillic letters Т, К, Д and В (&quot;Tuz&quot;, &quot;Korol&quot;, &quot;Dama&quot; and &quot;Valet&quot;); Sweden uses E, K, D and Kn (&quot;Ess&quot;, &quot;Kung&quot;, &quot;Dam&quot; and &quot;Knekt&quot;) and France uses 1, R, D, V (&quot;As&quot;, &quot;Roi&quot;, &quot;Dame&quot;, and &quot;Valet&quot;). Finland uses numbers 1-13.

All early playing cards were single headed (also called single ended). During the 19th century, card manufacturers began designing double-headed cards so that the cards could be readily identified whichever way up they were. In the case of court cards, this entailed cutting off the lower half of the image and replacing it with an inverted copy of the top half usually, but not always, with a horizontal or sloping dividing line between the two halves. Today, while single headed patterns of German-suited and Latin-suited cards still exist, modern French-suited cards are invariably double-headed.

Although French-suited, 52-card packs are the most common playing cards used internationally, there are many countries or regions where the traditional pack size is only 36 (Russia, Bavaria) or 32 (north and central Germany, Austria) or where regional cards with smaller packs are preferred for many games. For example, 40- or 48-card Italian-suited packs are common in Italy; 40- and 48-card Spanish-suited packs on the Iberian peninsula; and 36-card German-suited packs are very common in Bavaria and Austria. In addition, tarot cards are required for games such as French Tarot (78 cards), which is widely played in France, and the Tarock family of games (42 or 54 cards) played in countries like Austria and Hungary.

== History ==
The English pattern pack originated in Britain which was importing French playing cards from Rouen and Antwerp by 1480. The earliest cards of the English pattern date to around 1516. But Britain only started manufacturing its own cards towards the end of the 16th century, when card production began in London. These were based on the Rouen pattern, but unlike the traditional French cards, they dropped the names on the court cards. The English pattern evolved, in the process losing &quot;some of its Rouen flavour and elegance and became more and more stylised. The figures took more space in the cards and many details were distorted.&quot;

All early cards of this type were single headed, but around 1860, the double-headed cards, universally used on modern decks, appeared. Corner indices were added around 1880. During the 19th century, the English pattern spread all over the world and is now used almost everywhere, even in countries where traditional patterns and other suits are popular. In America, the English pattern was copied onto wider cards.

The fanciful design and manufacturer&#x27;s logo commonly displayed on the ace of spades began under the reign of James I of England, who passed a law requiring an insignia on that card as proof of payment of a tax on local manufacture of cards. 

Until August 4, 1960, decks of playing cards printed and sold in the United Kingdom were liable for taxable duty and the ace of spades carried an indication of the name of the printer and the fact that taxation had been paid on the cards. The packs were also sealed with a government duty wrapper.

==Card size==

Historically the size of playing cards was down to the printer, but during the 19th century sizes became standardised, initially to a size of 3½ 2½ inches. Today these are often referred to as &quot;wide&quot; cards or &quot;poker-sized&quot; cards. Wider playing cards had advantages: it was harder to cheat and, if packs were unavailable, dog-eared cards could be trimmed smaller. Narrower cards, known as &quot;whist-sized&quot; or &quot;bridge-sized&quot; cards, probably first appeared in Europe and enabled players to handle the larger numbers of cards required for games like bridge. 

However, there is no formal requirement for precise adherence and minor variations are produced by various manufacturers in different countries. In Germany, for example, standard Poker and Rummy packs by ASS Altenburger and Ravensburger measure 92 × 59 mm. Austria&#x27;s Piatnik sells packs marketed for Bridge, Poker and Whist measuring 89 × 58 mm; while Britain&#x27;s Waddingtons produce generic packs sized at 88 × 58 mm.

Other sizes are also available, such as a medium size (usually ) and a miniature size (typically ). These are often intended for playing patience or solitaire games. Larger &#x27;jumbo&#x27; cards are produced for card tricks and those with poor eyesight.

The thickness and weight of modern playing cards are subject to numerous variables related to their purpose of use and associated material design for durability, stiffness, texture and appearance.

== Markings ==

Some decks include additional design elements. Casino blackjack decks may include markings intended for a machine to check the ranks of cards, or shifts in rank location to allow a manual check via an inlaid mirror. Many casino decks and solitaire decks have four indices instead of just two. Some modern decks have bar code markings on the edge of the face to enable them to be sorted by machine (for playing duplicate bridge, especially simultaneous events where the same hands may be played at many different venues). Some decks have large indices for clarity. These are sometimes sold as &#x27;seniors&#x27; cards for older people with limited eyesight, but may also be used in games like stud poker, where being able to read cards from a distance is a benefit and hand sizes are small.

== Four-colour packs ==

The standard French-suited pack uses black for the spades and clubs, and red for the hearts and diamonds. However, some packs use four colours for the suits in order to make it easier to tell them apart. There are several schemes: a common one is the English Poker format with black spades (♠), red hearts (♥), blue diamonds (♦), and green clubs (♣). Another common system is based on the German suits and uses green spades (♠), yellow diamonds (♦), red hearts (♥), and black clubs (♣).

== Nomenclature ==
When giving the full written name of a specific card, the rank is given first followed by the suit, e.g., &quot;Seven of clubs&quot; or &quot;Seven of Clubs&quot;. Shorthand notation may reflect this by listing the rank first, &quot;7♣︎&quot;; this is common usage when discussing poker; but it is equally common in more general sources to find the suit listed first, as in &quot;♠K&quot; for a single card or &quot;♠AKQ&quot; for multiple cards. This is common practice when writing about bridge as it helps differentiate between the card(s) and the contract (e.g. &quot;4♥&quot;, a contract of four hearts). Tens may be either abbreviated to T or written as 10.

== Terminology ==
Common collective and individual terms for playing cards that are relevant, but not exclusive to, the 52-card pack are:
*Face card or court carda jack, queen or king.
*Honour card – a card that attracts a special bonus or payment for being held or captured in play. In bridge, honours are the aces, the court cards and tens (A, K, Q, J, 10); in whist and related games, the aces and courts (A, K, Q, J).
*Wild card card that may be designated by the owner to represent any other card.
*Numerals or pip cards are the cards numbered from 2 to 10.
*&quot;1&quot; cards are usually known as aces.
*&quot;2&quot; cards are also known as deuces.
*&quot;3&quot; cards are also known as treys.

== Nicknames ==
Certain cards have acquired nicknames over time. The following common nicknames for cards of the English pattern pack only. Other patterns are different and may have other nicknames in the countries where they are used:
*One-eyed Jacksthe jack of spades and the jack of hearts are depicted in profile, while the others are shown in full or oblique face.
*One-eyed Royalsare the king of diamonds as well as the one-eyed jacks. The rest of the courts are shown in full or oblique face.
*Suicide KingsThe king of hearts is typically shown with a sword behind his head, making him appear to be stabbing himself. Similarly, the one-eyed king of diamonds is typically shown with an axe behind his head with the blade facing toward him. These depictions, and their blood-red colour, inspired this nickname.
*The king of diamonds is traditionally armed with an axe, while the other three kings are armed with swords; thus, the king of diamonds is sometimes referred to as &quot;the man with the axe&quot;. This is the basis of the trump &quot;one-eyed jacks and the man with the axe&quot;. Poker may be played with wild cards, often &quot;Aces, Jacks, and the King with the Axe&quot;.
*The ace of spades, unique in its large, ornate spade, is sometimes said to be the death card or the picture card, and in some games is used as a trump card.
*The queen of spades usually holds a sceptre and is sometimes known as &quot;the bedpost queen&quot;, though more often she is called the &quot;black lady&quot;. She is the only queen facing right.
*In many decks, the queen of clubs holds a flower. She is thus known as the &quot;flower queen&quot;, though this design element is among the most variable; the Bicycle Poker deck depicts all queens with a flower styled according to their suit.

<text>In American English, produce generally refers to fruits and vegetables intended to be eaten by humans, although other food products such as dairy products or nuts are sometimes included.

In supermarkets, the term is also used to refer to the section of the store where fruit and vegetables are kept. &quot;Produce&quot; is the main product sold by greengrocers (UK, Australia) and farmers&#x27; markets. The term is widely and commonly used in the U.S. and Canada, but is not typically used outside the agricultural sector in other English-speaking countries.

== Packaging ==
Produce may be packaged for transport or sale.

In parts of the world, including the U.S. and Europe, loose pieces of produce, such as apples, may be individually marked with small stickers bearing price look-up codes. These four- or five-digit codes are a standardized system intended to aid checkout and inventory control at places where produce is sold.

== Bacterial contamination ==

Raw sprouts are among the produce most at risk of bacterial infection.

Rinsing is an effective way to reduce the bacteria count on produce, reducing it to about 10 percent of its previous level.

Wastewater used on vegetables can be a source of contamination, due to contamination with fecal matter, salmonella or other bacteria. After Denmark eliminated salmonella in its chickens, attention has turned to vegetables as a source of illness due to feces contamination from other animal sources, such as pigs.

<text>A rotunda () is any roofed building with a circular ground plan, and sometimes covered by a dome. It may also refer to a round room within a building (an example being the one below the dome of the United States Capitol in Washington, D.C.). The Pantheon in Rome is perhaps the most famous, and is the most influential rotunda. A &quot;band rotunda&quot; is a circular bandstand, usually with a dome.

==Classical architecture== 
The terminology of Ancient Greek architecture and Roman architecture distinguishes between two types of rotunda: a tholos is enclosed by a wall, while a monopteros is just a circular colonnade with a roof (like a modern bandstand or park pavilion). It is not clear that any Greek example was actually a Greek temple, but several were Roman temples, though mostly much smaller than the Pantheon, and with very different designs. The Temple of Hercules Victor and Temple of Vesta in Rome, along with the Temple of Vesta, Tivoli, are the best known and best preserved examples. 

The few large Greek &quot;tholoi&quot; had varied functions, not all of which are now clear. Several are at major religious sanctuaries, but seem not to have been conventional temples. At most only the foundations and a few columns remain in place. They include the Tholos of Delphi, the Philippeion at Olympia, a small memorial to the family of Philip of Macedon, and a large building at the Sanctuary of Asclepius, Epidaurus. The largest Greek tholos, of uncertain function, was built in the Samothrace temple complex in the 260s BC. It is often called the Arsinoeum, as a dedication tablet for the Ptolomeic Queen Arsinoe II of Egypt has survived. The sanctuary was a great Hellenistic centre of Greco-Roman mysteries and the building probably played some role in these.

The oldest, the Tholos of Athens, was a large and plain rotunda used as a dining hall, and perhaps more, by the city&#x27;s ruling council.

Later, very large, Roman rotundas include the Castel Sant&#x27;Angelo in Rome, built in the 130s as a mausoleum for the emperor Hadrian, and in the Middle Ages turned into a castle, and the 4th-century Rotunda in Thessaloniki, probably also intended as an imperial mausoleum, but later used as a church and a mosque. The church of Santa Costanza in Rome is a circular funerary chapel of the 4th century, probably built for one or more of the daughters of Constantine the Great, originally placed next to a funerary hall that is now only a ruined wall.

==India==

Some of the earliest free-standing temples in India are thought to have been of a circular type, as the Buddhist Bairat Temple in Bairat, Rajasthan, formed of a central &quot;stupa&quot; surrounded by a circular colonnade and an enclosing wall, built during the time of Emperor Ashoka and near which were found several Minor Rock Edicts. Ashoka also built the Mahabodhi Temple in Bodh Gaya circa 250 BC, possibly also a circular structure, next to the Bodhi tree. Representations of this early temple structure are found on a 100 BCE relief from the &quot;stupa&quot; railing at Bhārhut, as well as in Sanchi. These circular-type temples were also found in later rock-hewn caves such as Tulja Caves or Guntupalli. Circularity in Buddhist architecture was generally to allow a path for &quot;pradakshina&quot; or devotional circling of a round and solid &quot;stupa&quot;. 

It has been suggested that these circular structures with colonnades may have originated with the Greek circular tholos temple, as in the Tholos of Delphi, but circular wooden huts in India are a more likely source of inspiration.

==Medieval and Renaissance Europe==

The Pisa Baptistery is the outstanding late medieval rotunda, taking from 1152 to 1363 to build, and including Romanesque, Gothic and classicizing or Proto-Renaissance elements. There are a number of other round churches. 

The rotunda with columns was revived in one of the most influential buildings in Renaissance architecture, the &quot;Tempietto&quot; in a courtyard of the church of San Pietro in Montorio in Rome. This was designed by Donato Bramante around 1502 in strongly classicizing style. It is a small building whose innovation, as far as Western Europe was concerned, was to use the tholos form as the base for a dome above; this may have reflected a Byzantine structure in Jerusalem over the tomb of Christ. The Roman Temple of Vesta (which has no dome) was probably also an influence. This pairing of tholos, now called a drum or tholobate, and dome became extremely popular raised high above main structures which were often based on the Roman temple.

==Rotunda in Central Europe==
A great number of parochial churches were built in this form in the 9th to 11th centuries CE in Central Europe. These round churches can be found in great number in Hungary, Poland, Slovakia, Croatia (particularly Dalmatia), Austria, Bavaria, Germany, and the Czech Republic. It was thought of as a structure descending from the Roman Pantheon. However, it can be found mainly not on former Roman territories, but in Central Europe. Generally its size was 6–9 meters inner diameter and the apse was directed toward the east. Sometimes three or four apses were attached to the central circle and this type has relatives even in the Caucasus.
===Rotunda in the Carpathian Basin===

Several types of rotundas are found in the Carpathian Basin, within the former boundaries of Kingdom of Hungary. Building of rotundas in Carpathian basin started already in 9th century in Great Moravia. According to the research and radiocarbon dating of plaster, Rotunda of st. George in Nitrianska Blatnica was built sometimes around the year 830, what makes it one of the oldest still standing buildings in the area of Central Europe. Similar rotunda was standing in hillfort Kostolec in Ducové (only foundations remained). The role and form of rotundas developed from gradual enlargements of ancient small village churches. Many of them still stand today, e.g. in Nagytótlak, Kallósd and Kissikátor in Hungary or in Bíňa and Šivetice in Slovakia. Rotunda in Šivetice is the biggest one in Central Europe, with diameter of 11 m. In many places the ancient foundations have been excavated and conserved. The village church of Sárospatak is complete with a simple circular nave and an eastern apse. The church of Alagimajor at Dunakeszi was enlarged toward the apse in the 14th century. More significant enlargement of the central rotunda is seen at Isaszeg where the extension extended toward the East and West; the rotunda foundations can also be seen in the central portion of the nave of the Gothic church. In many cases the rotunda was used as the apse of the village&#x27;s new and larger church (Bagod-Szentpál, Hidegség, Vágkeresztur, Ipolykiskeszi, Herencsény, Szalonna). Such semi-circle apses are preserved all over the Carpathian Basin. Rotundas of six apses, a most interesting form, are found at Karcsa, Kiszombor in Hungary, at Horjany in Ukraine and several places in Armenia (Aragatz, Bagaran, Bagnayr, Botshor, Kiagmis Alti).

==The Caucasus==
There is an interesting connection between Central European and Caucasian rotundas of the 9th to 11th centuries AD. Several Armenian built rotunda churches have sixfold arched central apsis, i.e. at Aragatz, Bagaran, Bagnayr, Botshor, Kiagmis Alti in Armenia. At the same time eightfold arched central buildings (rotunda) are also frequently occurring in Armenia: Ani, Irind, Varzhahan. It was a suggestion (Csemegi J.) that there was not only western European but Eastern Caucasian relation for architects of Hungary in this age of King Stephen I of Hungary.

Good example of Georgian rotunda church is Bana cathedral which is now located on territory of Turkey.

<doc id="733674" wikidata="Q817486" url="?curid=733674" title="Benjamin Franklin Butler (lawyer)">
<text>Benjamin Franklin Butler (December 17, 1795 – November 8, 1858) was a lawyer from the state of New York. A professional and political ally of Martin Van Buren, among the many elective and appointive positions he held were Attorney General of the United States and United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York. He was also a founder of New York University and one of the founders of the Children&#x27;s Village school in New York City.

==Early life==
He was the son of Medad Butler and Hannah Butler (née Tylee) of Kinderhook Landing, in Columbia County, New York. He studied at Hudson Academy in Hudson, New York, and read law with Martin Van Buren, whose son John Van Buren later read law with Butler.

Butler was admitted to the bar in 1817, and became Martin Van Buren&#x27;s partner. In his 1903 book &quot;The Art of Cross-Examination&quot;, author Francis L. Wellman indicated that Butler was regarded during his life as a highly effective trial lawyer, and one of the most successful cross-examiners of his day.

==Political career==
Butler was one of the earliest members of the Albany Regency. When fellow Regency member and Van Buren ally Roger Skinner was appointed Judge of the United States District Court for the Northern District of New York in 1819, he sold his law office to Butler, who took over Skinner&#x27;s clients and pending cases.

Butler began his political career as district attorney of Albany County, serving from 1821 to 1825. He was appointed one of the three commissioners to revise the State statutes in 1825. Butler was a member from Albany County of the New York State Assembly in 1828. In 1833, he served as commissioner for New York to adjust the New Jersey boundary line.

On November 15, 1833, President Andrew Jackson appointed Butler Attorney General, an office he held until 1838. From that year until 1841, and from 1845 to 1848, he was United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York.

He was a prominent participant in the 1844 Democratic National Convention. As one of the leaders of the New York delegation, he supported the candidacy of Martin Van Buren and opposed the 2/3 rule for nominating, but failed in both cases. In the end, he was the one to announce that the New York delegation would switch to eventual winner James K. Polk. Van Buren recommended Butler to Polk for a cabinet position but told Polk that he was loath to leave his lucrative law practice and so would not agree unless offered the office of Secretary of State. Polk ended up offering him Secretary of War, but Butler declined, stating that he would only accept State or Treasury.

He was also at the 1848 Free Soil Convention, where he helped write the party platform.

===Legacy===
Butler was a regent of the University of the State of New York from 1829 to 1832. He was instrumental in founding New York University in 1831 and served in various capacities with the university from its inception. He received the honorary degree of LL.D. from Rutgers University in 1834. He was appointed principal professor of New York University in 1837.

==Personal life==

In 1818, he married Harriet Allen; their children included attorney William Allen Butler, and Lydia Allen Butler, who married Alfred Booth and was the mother of Sir Alfred Allen Booth, 1st Baronet, a director of Alfred Booth and Company and chairman of Cunard.

While visiting Europe in 1858, he died in Paris, France. He was buried at Woodlawn Cemetery in The Bronx. Fort Butler, one of the main forts built for the forced removal of the Cherokee Indians on the Trail of Tears, was named for him.

<doc id="733681" wikidata="Q331953" url="?curid=733681" title="Kazuyoshi Miura">
<text>, nicknamed King Kazu, is a Japanese professional footballer who plays as a forward for Japan Football League club Atletico Suzuka, on loan from J2 League club Yokohama FC. He is the world&#x27;s oldest active player to play and score in a professional match.

He played for the Japan national team from 1990 to 2000, and was the first Japanese recipient of the IFFHS Asia&#x27;s Footballer of the Year award. Miura, whose rise to fame in Japan coincided with the launch of the J.League in 1993, was arguably Japan&#x27;s first superstar in football. He is also known for his trademark &quot;Kazu Feint&quot; and his famous &quot;Kazu dance&quot;, when he scores notable goals or produces such plays.

Miura holds the records for being the oldest active goalscorer in the J-League, the footballer with the world&#x27;s longest professional career, and, as of 2025, is the oldest professional footballer in the world at 58. He also holds the unique distinction of having played professional football in five separate decades (1980s–2020s). His elder brother Yasutoshi is a former professional footballer.

== Club career ==

=== Early career ===
In 1982, Miura left the Shizuoka Gakuen High School after less than a year, and travelled alone to Brazil at the age of fifteen to become a professional footballer there. He signed with the youth squad of São Paulo side Juventus, and in 1986, Miura signed his first professional contract with Santos. He played for several other Brazilian clubs, including Palmeiras and Coritiba, until his return to Japan in 1990.

=== Verdy Kawasaki ===
His time in Brazil elevated him to star status and on his return to Japan, he joined the Japan Soccer League (JSL) side Yomiuri SC, which later spun off from its parent company Yomiuri Shimbun and became Verdy Kawasaki with the launch of the J1 League in 1993. With Yomiuri/Kawasaki, Miura won four consecutive league titles playing alongside fellow Japanese national team regulars Ruy Ramos and Tsuyoshi Kitazawa. Yomiuri won the last two JSL titles in 1991 and 1992, and Verdy Kawasaki won the first two J1 League titles in 1993 and 1994. He was named the first J.League Most Valuable Player in 1993.

==== Loan to Genoa ====
Miura became the first East Asian footballer to play in Serie A, joining the Italian club Genoa in the 1994–95 Serie A season. In his Italian stint, he made 21 appearances for the club and scored one goal, during the Genoa derby against Sampdoria. On 15 January 1995, Miura assisted Antonio Manicone&#x27;s match-winning goal against Padova.

==== Return to Verdy Kawasaki ====
He returned to Verdy Kawasaki for the 1995 season and played with them until the end of the 1998 season.

=== Dinamo Zagreb ===
Miura made another attempt at playing in Europe with Croatia Zagreb in 1999.

=== Return to Japan ===
He returned to Japan, however, following a brief trial with AFC Bournemouth, in the same year, and played with Kyoto Purple Sanga and Vissel Kobe.

=== Yokohama FC ===
In 2005, Miura signed for Yokohama FC. They would be promoted to the J1 League two years later. In 2007, Miura was selected for the 2007 J.League All-Star Soccer for J-East and played exceptionally well. 

In November 2015, Miura signed a new one-year contract with Yokohama FC at the age of 48. In January 2017, Miura signed another new one-year contract with Yokohama, taking his professional career into his fifties.

On 5 March 2017, Miura became the oldest ever player to feature in a professional match when he started in Yokohama&#x27;s 1–1 draw against V-Varen Nagasaki. With 50 years and seven days, he surpassed the previous record held by Stanley Matthews from 1965 by two days. Seven days later, he broke Matthews&#x27; record for oldest goalscorer in professional football when he struck the only goal of a 1–0 win over Thespakusatsu Gunma.

In January 2018, he signed a new contract, and renewed it again in January 2019, January 2020, and January 2021.

On 5 August 2020, he started in a J.League Cup match against Sagan Tosu, becoming the oldest player to take to the pitch in Japan&#x27;s league cup competition, at the age of 53 years, 5 months and 10 days. By doing so, he surpassed the previous record of 42 years, 10 months set in 2017 by Yukio Tsuchiya.

On 23 September 2020, he started in the J1 League match against Kawasaki Frontale and in doing so became the oldest player to take to the pitch in a J1 League match and the oldest player ever in a football match in the highest national division worldwide. Miura played 57 minutes in this match.

In January 2021 he agreed to extend his contract at the age of 53 for his 36th season.

==== Loan to Suzuka Point Getters ====
On 30 December 2021, it was reported that Miura had reached an agreement to join the Suzuka Point Getters in the Japan Football League (JFL), the fourth tier of Japanese football. On 13 March 2022, Miura, at the age of 55, made his debut for the Point Getters in the first round of the Japan Football League with 4,620 spectators watching his debut, which is the highest attendance at a Suzuka home match, breaking their previous record of 1,308 spectators in 2019. His debut also meant that he broke the record of the oldest player to have ever featured in a JFL match at 55 years old, with a 12-year gap to the previous record holder. His presence at the club brought many curious spectators to see him in action, leading to the Point Getters having featured in nine of the ten matches with the highest attendance numbers throughout the 2022 season. This includes a 1–0 win against Criacao Shinjuku on 9 October 2022, which gathered a crowd of 16,218 spectators at the Japan National Stadium, becoming the highest-attended JFL match of all time. On 30 October 2022, Miura became the oldest player to score in the JFL, having converted from the penalty spot in the 85th minute of the match to seal Suzuka&#x27;s 3–1 win against Tiamo Hirakata. He scored again from open play on 12 November 2022 at 55 years and 259 days old, breaking two more records. In total, from 30 October to 12 November, he played three matches and scored two goals.

==== Loan to Oliveirense ====
On 26 January 2023, Portuguese club Oliveirense announced that Miura would be playing for the Liga Portugal 2 club on loan for the rest of the season. Back in November 2022, the owner of Yokohama, Onodera Group, had become a majority shareholder (ownership of 52.5% of the stock) of U.D. Oliveirense. Oliveirense announced that Miura passed the medical tests with flying colors, and launched an official presentation video of him featuring typical Japanese manga aesthetics and style.

At 55 years old, Miura became by a large margin the oldest professional player to ever sign a professional contract for any professional ball sports team in Portugal since volleyball player Miguel Maia renewed his contract with Sporting Clube de Portugal in 2018 at 47 years of age. On 25 March, Miura played his first match for Oliveirense in a friendly match against Liga 3 team Oliveira do Hospital. Two days later he visited the Embassy of Japan in Lisbon where he gifted a signed football shirt of his team to the embassy staff.

On 22 April, Miura made his debut in a Liga Portugal 2 match at the age of 56, when he came on in the 90th minute of a 4–1 win at Academico de Viseu&#x27;s home ground. On 28 May, Miura was awarded the man of the match in the last league game of the season for his team, where Miura played the last 20 minutes of the match as a substitute and Oliveirense won 4–3 against Leixões. Tonel, football commentator of Sport TV, chose Miura for the award as a symbolic homage to his long career, a decision which caused some controversy. Vítor Martins, Leixões&#x27; manager, found it strange and said: &quot;In a game that had seven goals I do not understand how they give the Man of the Match award to Miura. I think it is offensive to give him the award, this is not the way, otherwise this is turned into a circus&quot;.

In July 2023, his loan with Oliveirense was extended for an indefinite period.

==== Loan to Atletico Suzuka ====
In June 2024, Miura returned on loan to Suzuka Point Getters, which had been rebranded to Atletico Suzuka.

On 29 September 2024, Miura broke the record for the oldest player to appear in JFL, at 57 years and 216 days old. He made his first start for the club, his tenth league appearance, in the 0–0 draw with Sony Sendai FC on 26 October, being substituted in the 55th minute.

== International career ==
=== Football ===
In September 1990, Miura was named as part of the Japan squad for the 1990 Asian Games. At this competition, on 26 September, he debuted against Bangladesh. After his debut, he played as a forward until 1997. In 1992, he played at the 1992 Asian Cup, in which he scored the winner in a group stage 1-0 win against Iran. Japan went on to win the tournament, Miura being named the tournament&#x27;s Most Valuable Player. In 1993, in the 1994 World Cup qualification, he played thirteen games and scored thirteen goals. However, Japan failed to qualify for the 1994 World Cup. He also played at the 1994 Asian Games, and the 1995 King Fahd Cup. ￼Miura also played in the 1996 Asian Cup, and he scored one goal, the second goal in a group stage 4-0 win against Uzbekistan.

In 1997, Miura scored fourteen times for Japan during qualification for the 1998 World Cup, leading the &quot;Samurai Blue&quot; to their first ever World Cup appearance. Despite this, Miura was controversially left out of the squad.

In February 2000, Miura played for Japan for the first time in two years. He played his last national team match later that year and finished with the second-most career goals in Japanese national team history with 55 goals in 89 matches.

He is one of only three men for Japan to score more than 50 goals for the teams, along with Kunishige Kamamoto and Shinji Okazaki.

=== Futsal ===
In 2012, and at the age of 45, Miura made his debut for the Japan futsal team in a 3–3 draw against Brazil. He came off the bench and was involved in the buildup for the second goal scored by Nobuya Osodo. In his second appearance with the futsal team, he scored the third goal in a 3–1 win over Ukraine. In the 2012 Futsal World Cup, Miura appeared in all four matches for Japan, but failed to score as the Japanese were knocked out by Ukraine in the round of 16.

== Personal life ==
Since 1993, he has been married to former actress and model Risako Shitara. They have two children, Ryota Miura (born 1997) and Kota Miura.

<text>Raisin Bombers () was the colloquial name given by Berliners to the Western Allied (American and British) transport aircraft which brought in supplies by airlift to West Berlin during the Soviet Berlin Blockade in 1948/1949. In American English they were called Candy Bombers.

==History==

The name came from the fact that some pilots started voluntarily to throw sweets and candy (and, presumably, also raisins) on little tinkered parachutes out of the window to children lined up on the edges of the West Berlin airfields watching the planes. These actions were first attributed to American pilot Gail Halvorsen, nicknamed &quot;Uncle Wiggly Wings&quot;, who began to drop chocolate bars he had attached handkerchiefs to while approaching Tempelhof Airport. Upon comprehensive coverage in the media, drops were ordered expanded by Lt. General William H. Tunner as &quot;Operation Little Vittles&quot;.

As this gesture became well known, it enjoyed considerable support with the US public. Halvorsen and his comrades received large support in form of more and more donations of candy from the confectionery industry while civilian volunteers made the parachutes for the delivery. These actions contributed to the development of post war German-American relations.

Today the name &quot;Rosinenbomber&quot; is commonly applied to several historic types of military aircraft involved in the Berlin Airlift, foremost the four-engined Douglas C-54 Skymaster and the Douglas C-47 Skytrain.

<doc id="733697" wikidata="Q16578" url="?curid=733697" title="Flores Department">
<text>Flores () is a department of Uruguay, positioned in the southwest of the central part of the country. Its capital is Trinidad. It borders Durazno Department to the north and east, Florida Department to the southeast, San José Department to the south and Soriano Department to the west. Its density of population was the lowest during the 2011 census, closely followed by the departments of Durazno and Treinta y Tres.

==History==

The department was formed in 1885 from part of San José Department, during the government of President Máximo Santos. It is named after the former Colorado Party leader, Venancio Flores, who was born in Trinidad in the nineteenth century.

The department has many sites of prehistoric rock art. Such examples of rock art are particularly concentrated at Chamangá (Localidad Rupestre de Chamangá).

Another site of interest is the Palace Cave.

==Economy==

Outside Trinidad, Flores is agricultural, primarily raising cattle for export and sheep for wool and Gauchos, the South American cowboys, can still be seen riding the plains. There are many active ranches (Spanish: &quot;estancias&quot;), some of which can be visited by tourists.

However, Flores keeps its traditions whilst utilising the best of modern technology. For example, horses are frequently used for round-ups, but communications are all digital, and wireless internet is available throughout the department.

==Fauna==

Over 100 species of birds can be found in Flores. For example, rufous horneros, with their oven-like nests, can be seen sitting atop fence posts. Huge colonies of green parrots&#x27; nests hang high in the tall eucalyptus. Southern lapwings, locally known as teros, burrowing owls, and elegant-crested tinamou nest in open fields while long wing harriers, gray eagles, and hawks soar high above. Some of the largest great kiskadees are extremely common as are the guira, a type of cuckoo. Along quiet country lanes giant wood rails, pink spoonbills and kingfishers can be seen, alongside flocks of ibis and white egrets in the pastures. Red headed cardinals, both orange throated and red necked woodpeckers, and scissor-tailed nightjars can be seen in the small stands of trees that dot the countryside. Long, split tailed flycatchers zip above the rich grass around twilight. Glittering-bellied emerald hummingbirds drink from the tall purple flowers that carpet the fields from Spring until Fall.

Tegu lizards, armadillos, fox, skunks, hares, opossums and snakes enjoy the undeveloped pastures which dominate the department.

A nature reserve is maintained in the department&#x27;s capital, Trinidad.

==Demographics==

It is the most sparsely populated of all the Uruguayan departments with a population density of under 5 people per km² and 350,000 head of cattle. Of the total population of 25,050, some 21,430 live in the capital Trinidad.

As of the census of 2011, Flores Department had a population of 25,050 (12,342 male and 12,708 female) and 10,589 households.

<doc id="733700" wikidata="Q2024644" url="?curid=733700" title="Tide (brand)">
<text>Tide is an American brand of laundry detergent manufactured and marketed by Procter &amp; Gamble. Introduced in 1946, it is the highest-selling detergent brand in the world, with an estimated 14.3 percent of the global market.

== Background ==
The household chore of doing the laundry began to change with the introduction of washing powders in the 1880s. These new laundry products were pulverized soap. New cleaning-product marketing successes, such as the 1890s introduction of the N. K. Fairbank Company&#x27;s Gold Dust washing powder (which used a breakthrough hydrogenation process in its formulation), and Hudson&#x27;s heavily advertised product, Rinso, proved that there was a ready market for better cleaning agents. Henkel &amp; Cie&#x27;s &quot;self-activating&quot; (or self bleaching) cleaner, Persil; (introduced in 1907); the early synthetic detergent, BASF&#x27;s Fewa (introduced in 1932); and Procter &amp; Gamble&#x27;s 1933 totally synthetic creation, Dreft (marketed for use on infant-wear) —all indicated significant advances in the laundry cleaning product market.

The detergent business was further revolutionized with the discovery of the alkylbenzene sulfonates, which, when combined with the use of chemical &quot;builders&quot;, made machine washing with hard water possible. This presented Procter and Gamble with the opportunity to create a product such as Tide.

Tide Pod Dry Cleaning is the name of a 24/7 dry cleaning and laundry service with hundreds of locations across Chicago, Philadelphia, Denver, Washington D.C., Boston, Cincinnati, Dallas, Nashville and Charlotte.

== History ==
The original Tide laundry detergent was a synthetic designed specifically for heavy-duty, machine cleaning (an advance over the milder cleaning capabilities of Fewa and Dreft detergent brands). 

Tide was first introduced in U.S. test markets in 1946 as the world&#x27;s first heavy-duty detergent, with nationwide distribution accomplished in 1949. Tide claimed it was &quot;America&#x27;s Washday Favorite&quot;. Authority was quickly gained in the U.S. detergent market, dwarfing the sales of Ivory Snow; and accelerating the demise of two of its main competing products, Rinso and Gold Dust Washing Powder, both then Lever Brothers brands. These other brands came in the more familiar soap-powder and soap-flake forms. Tide, however, came shaped like a white powdered bead. The line was expanded to include an orange-tinted clear liquid form in 1984. Today, most formulations of liquid Tide, both concentrated and regular, are dark blue, with the exception of &quot;Tide Free&quot;, which is clear. 

In 2006, the development of Tide was designated an ACS National Historic Chemical Landmark in recognition of its significance as the first heavy-duty synthetic detergent.

, Tide has more than 30% of the liquid-detergent market, with more than twice as much in sales as the second-most-popular brand Gain, although it costs about 50% more than the average liquid detergent.

For the company&#x27;s national and international experience in sustainable development, and eco-friendly products, the Environment Possibility Award conferred the &quot;Environmental Heroes of the Year&quot; to Tide in 2020.

In some areas, Tide has become such a hot commodity item, that criminals steal it from stores to resell. Police call the detergent &quot;liquid gold&quot; on the black market and it has been known to be traded or sold for illegal drugs.

== Brand ==
In a 2009 survey, consumers ranked Tide among the three brands they would least likely give up during the Great Recession. The Tide trademark is an easily recognized, distinctive orange-and-yellow bulls-eye. This original logo was designed by Donald Deskey, an architect and famous industrial designer. The logo was slightly modified for the product&#x27;s fiftieth anniversary in 1996, and remains in use today.

Tide was the first product to be nationally packaged using Day-Glo colors—strikingly eye-catching when first introduced in 1959.

The Tide brand is on at least six powders and liquid detergents in the United States.

== Product line ==
Tide is marketed under various sub-brands, such as 2× Ultra Tide. In the late 1960s and early 1970s, it was branded as Tide XK (for Xtra Kleaning), but it was rebranded simply as Tide later.

An addition to the Tide family, Tide Coldwater was formulated to remove stains while saving energy because it does not require hot or even warm water. Tide Free is marketed as being free from dyes or perfumes. Tide-To-Go is a product packaged in a pen-like format and intended to remove small stains on the spot, without further laundering.

In Puerto Rico, the Tide formula is marketed under the name Ace.

Since 2012, Tide has sold Tide Pods, a line of laundry detergent pod, making an estimated 15% of sales. In late 2017, an Internet meme was popularized around the concept of eating Tide Pods and, as a result, people attempted the extremely dangerous &quot;Tide Pods Challenge&quot;.

== Sponsorships ==

Tide has sponsored several NASCAR stock cars, notably the Chevrolet &quot;Tide Ride&quot; driven by Darrell Waltrip as #17 for Hendrick Motorsports. The relationship lasted from 1987 to 1990 and won the 1989 Daytona 500. Waltrip left the team to form his own team. 

Tide then sponsored Ricky Rudd in the #5 car after Levi Garrett left Hendrick. Rudd drove for Hendrick until 1993, when he left the racing team, also to form his own team and taking the Tide sponsorship. Rudd Performance Motorsports ran from 1994 to 1999 and won the 4th Brickyard 400 in 1997. After Rudd became winless in his first time in 17 seasons, Tide left Rudd after being lured by Calvin Well&#x27;s new team PPI Motorsports. The new team&#x27;s number was 32, which the sum of 17, 5, and 10. Scott Pruett was the first driver but after DNQing 6 times and no Top 10s, Ricky Craven took over in 2001 and responded with a win at Martinsville Speedway. He went winless in 2002, but one year later, he won the closest race in NASCAR history at Darlington in the Carolina Dodge Dealers 400, rubbing with Kurt Busch for laps and with a margin-of-victory of 0.002 seconds. After no Top 10s halfway through the 2004 season, Craven left PPI and was replaced by Bobby Hamilton Jr. for 2004 and 2005. Travis Kvapil ran for PPI in 2006 but with four DNQs. 

Tide left the sport before it was going to sponsor one of Well&#x27;s proposed Toyota teams in 2007. Tide was on Kevin Harvick&#x27;s truck a few times, but Kroger was also promoting the car. Tide made its Cup series return in September 2016, when it sponsored Matt Kenseth&#x27;s No. 20 car for a Darlington tribute scheme. Tide extended their sponsorship to Joe Gibbs Racing to three races in 2017.

<text>Avondale University is an Australian private university affiliated with the Seventh-day Adventist Church. It is a part of the Seventh-day Adventist education system, the world’s second largest Christian school system. It has two campuses, the Lake Macquarie campus being the primary campus situated in Cooranbong, New South Wales. The other campus is located at Sydney Adventist Hospital in the Sydney suburb of Wahroonga and is the main campus of the nursing school.

It primarily focuses in the areas of teaching, theology, and nursing, but also offers bachelor&#x27;s degrees in business, science and the arts as well as certificate studies in outdoor recreation. The nursing program commences at the Cooranbong campus for one or two semesters and is completed at the Sydney Adventist Hospital with hands-on experience gained in the hospital. Master&#x27;s degrees are offered in theology, education, nursing, ministry, and some business related fields by distance education, including a one-month on-campus component in the winter semester. Research doctoral (PhD) programs are offered in selected areas.

Avondale University runs Avondale Academic Press, a small academic publisher.

Avondale University worked toward full University status from the Australian government for many years. It was granted full University status on 1 July 2021. It is an international affiliate of the Council for Christian Colleges and Universities.

Avondale University is an institution of the South Pacific Division of Seventh-day Adventists. The library on its Lake Macquarie campus houses a local research centre of the Ellen G. White Estate.

==Educational philosophy==
During the 1890s, Ellen White reformed the curriculum to make the Bible the center of study, in place of the classics. This change soon spread to Adventist schools in the United States.

==History==
A small Bible school was commenced in Melbourne in 1892, on the counsel of Ellen G. White. She preferred a rural location, and as a result a search for a rural location was commenced in 1893. A common account is the furrow story, in which Ellen White was reported to have had a vision concerning the land.

Finding land for a college seemed to be an impossible task, as the small church in Australia at the time did not have the finances to support such a project. Eventually the committee searching for the land found a block of land near Cooranbong ( north of Sydney) priced at $3 per acre ($741/km2) because of its &quot;poor, sandy and hungry&quot; land. They asked White to inspect the land, who gave her approval. An agricultural expert from the government who was commissioned to look over the land reported that it was of extremely poor quality. The land was purchased in the Spring of 1895, and the Avondale School for Christian Workers was opened there in 1897. In 1911 its name was changed to Australasian Missionary College. The College was a major influence on later Adventist education.

Shortly after 1951, students could study a Bachelor of Science through the external program of the University of London, and a Bachelor of Arts through Pacific Union College.

===Renamed Avondale College===
In 1964 the institution was renamed to Avondale College and the current men&#x27;s residence, Watson Hall, and first-year women&#x27;s residence, Andre Hall, were completed by the following year. In 1974 it received government accreditation to offer bachelor&#x27;s degrees of its own. Master&#x27;s degrees were first offered in the 1970s, through Andrews University, and from Avondale itself in the 1990s.

===To University Status===
In 2013, the college signed a memorandum of understanding with Charles Sturt University in its bid to attain full university status and, in the academic year 2015, the first students graduated with degrees jointly awarded by both institutions.

In 2019, TEQSA approved Avondale College of Higher Education’s change of category application from &quot;Higher Education Provider&quot; to &quot;Australian University College&quot;.

In 2021, TEQSA approved Avondale University&#x27;s change of category application from &quot;Australian University College&quot; to full Australian University status.

===Adventist Heritage Centre===
Information and records of the Oceania region are kept at the Adventist Heritage Centre, which is located within the library of the University campus.

===Heritage architecture===
There are a number of historic buildings that have been preserved on the Cooranbong campus. These include Bethel Hall and College Hall (which formerly functioned as the College Chapel), both of which are unique multi-storey wooden buildings. The refurbished Chan-Shun Auditorium is based on the original auditorium. Photographs and memorabilia of the College in its early years are housed in the Sunnyside Museum located at the nearby EG White Estate.

===Today===
The Cooranbong shopping district and Freemans Drive now occupy some of the land that was part of the Avondale Estate, creating a disjointed estate. Avondale School, which once shared facilities with the university, and the Cooranbong Aerodrome (which up until 2006 was used as part of the aviation certificate training) are located on one section and the university on the other.

FEE-HELP was introduced to the College in 2005. PhD degrees have been offered since 2006 upon approval from the New South Wales Department of Education and Training.
 In 2010, the college council voted to change its name to &quot;Avondale College of Higher Education&quot; as an interim step to achieving full university status.

For 30 years the college operated a school of aviation, first at Cooranbong and then at Cessnock Airport in the Hunter Valley after Cooranbong Airport closed. In 2008 the school was closed due to concerns over its long-term financial sustainability. Enrollment for the school reopened in January 2009. However, the school was sold during 2010..

The University maintains close links with many colleges and universities within the Seventh-day Adventist education system and international students have an option of spending the semester or year at Avondale. It also has mutual agreements with the University of Newcastle, University of New England and the nearby branch of Charles Sturt University, where students have had the option to do &quot;cross-credit&quot; courses online.

== Student life ==

Avondale University fosters a wide variety of students from varying cultural backgrounds and beliefs. Over the years, the college has hosted students from all continents. The majority of students are from Australia, New Zealand, North America and Pacific Islands. Exchange or transfer students from Adventist tertiary institutions in Europe and Asia make up the bulk of foreign students not from the aforementioned countries.

On campus, social activities form a part of student life outside academics. The auditorium, gym, library, College Hall, and cafeteria all provide meeting places for students. Both Indoor and Outdoor students have ready access to on campus events and services.

In common with the Seventh-day Adventist community, Avondale University ceases secular activities on a Friday afternoon. Over the Sabbath hours students are encouraged, though not required, to attend a variety of religious programs. There student-led Bible study groups and evening worship services open to students and staff alike. The men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s residences also host their own worship services during the weekday.

<doc id="733735" wikidata="Q2899344" url="?curid=733735" title="Berthon Boat">
<text>Berthon Boats are collapsible lifeboats used in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. They have double linings of canvas, sectioned into watertight envelopes that assist buoyancy and give protection from the possibility that the outer canvas could be accidentally torn. The canvas was also coated with &quot;linseed oil, soft soap, and yellow ochre&quot; to make it waterproof.

==History==
When, on the 18 June 1850, the SS &quot;Orion&quot; was wrecked off Portpatrick, the Reverend Clark, a survivor, wrote to the Reverend Edward Lyon Berthon: “Can not you think of a way in which boats, enough for all on board, be stowed on a passenger steamer without inconvenience?”. This led to Berthon&#x27;s development of the Berthon Collapsible Lifeboat.

When the boat was demonstrated to Queen Victoria, the Prince Consort, the Princess Royal and the Prince of Wales, the latter commented that a cannonball would go through it easily. Berthon asked him what a cannonball would not go through, and the Queen was reported to have been greatly amused.

The Prince Consort commended it to the Royal Navy, but the Admiralty complained there was nowhere to mount a gun. Nonetheless, the Royal Navy accepted a perfected design in 1873.

After the sinking of the &quot;Titanic&quot; in 1912, the White Star Line’s owner, J. Bruce Ismay, required that every passenger boat under his control would thereafter be fitted with sufficient lifeboats for all passengers. In his speech at the close of the British Wreck Commissioner’s inquiry into the sinking of the RMS &quot;Titanic&quot;, the Attorney General called for more life saving devices at sea, including lifeboats, and regulations that would ‘apply to the vessels of all countries’ to enforce this request.

==Reverend Edward Lyon Berthon==

In addition to ministering to his parish, the Reverend Edward Lyon Berthon of Romsey, Hampshire, ran a boat building and engineering enterprise. In 1877, he started a company in Romsey, building folding lifeboats and &quot;other floating machines&quot;, which (originally designed as lifeboats) were the mainstay of his business.

The prototype was developed by him at HMS Excellent, Whale Island, Portsmouth, where he was chaplain. A seaman was drowned in an early trial in 1854 after the boat was overloaded with a 13-inch mortar.

Berthon was related to the mid-twentieth century engineer, Peter Berthon, who developed the ERA racing car in the 1930s and the BRM post-war.

The Berthon Boat Company is still operating today on the same site in Lymington that it moved to in 1918 and is still a boat yard with a workforce of 100 skilled craftsmen specialising in the refit and repair of yachts of up to 150 feet. It also has a 280 berth deep water marina and a yacht sales division.

<text>&lt;noinclude&gt;
Chiapas is a state in Southeast Mexico. According to the 2020 Mexican census, it has the eighth largest population of all states with inhabitants and the 10th largest by land area spanning . Chiapas is officially divided into 124 municipalities, although the establishment of municipal authorities in Belisario Domínguez was suspended in 2015 pending the resolution of a territorial dispute between Chiapas and the neighbouring state of Oaxaca. In 2021, the Mexican Supreme Court resolved this dispute in Oaxaca&#x27;s favour, and annulled the 2011 decree that had created Belisario Domínguez.

Municipalities in Chiapas are administratively autonomous of the state according to the 115th article of the 1917 Constitution of Mexico. Every three years, citizens elect a municipal president (Spanish: &quot;presidente municipal&quot;) by a plurality voting system who heads a concurrently elected municipal council (&quot;ayuntamiento&quot;) responsible for providing all the public services for their constituents. The municipal council consists of a variable number of trustees and councillors (&quot;regidores y síndicos&quot;). Municipalities are responsible for public services (such as water and sewerage), street lighting, public safety, traffic, and the maintenance of public parks, gardens and cemeteries. They may also assist the state and federal governments in education, emergency fire and medical services, environmental protection and maintenance of monuments and historical landmarks. Since 1984, they have had the power to collect property taxes and user fees, although more funds are obtained from the state and federal governments than from their own income.

The largest municipality by population is the state capital Tuxtla Gutiérrez, with 604,147 residents while the smallest is Sunuapa with 2,308 residents. The largest municipality by land area is Ocosingo which spans , and the smallest is Santiago el Pinar which spans . The newest municipality is Honduras de la Sierra, incorporated on July 15, 2018.

<text>The Fabrique d&#x27;armes Émile et Léon Nagant, later known as L. Nagant &amp; Cie, Liège, was a Belgian firm established in Liège in 1859 as a manufacturer of firearms and later automobiles.

== History ==
The company was originally founded by brothers Émile (1830–1902) and Léon (1833–1900) as an industrial repair business, which included repairing damaged firearms. In 1867, the Nagant brothers entered the firearms market when their company received a license to produce 5,000 Remington Rolling Block rifles for the Papal Zouaves; they later adapted the rolling-block design to produce double-barreled shotguns under the name &quot;Remington-Nagant&quot;. The company is best known for Émile&#x27;s contribution to the design of the Mosin–Nagant Russian service rifle, adopted in 1891. This introduction to the Tsar&#x27;s military administration led to the adoption, in 1895, of the Nagant M1895 revolver (designed by Léon) as their standard-issue sidearm. The following year, Émile&#x27;s progressive blindness led to his retirement from the firm which was renamed to &quot;L. Nagant &amp; Cie, Liège&quot;, with Léon being joined by his sons Charles and Maurice.

==Car manufacture==

Later, the firm moved to the manufacture of automobiles; Nagant began with building cars under licence of the French firm Gobron-Brillies and later Rochet-Schneider. Nagant cars were made from 1900 to 1928. Overhead-valve engines appeared after World War I, at which point the company was making around 200 cars per year. The firm was purchased by Impéria Automobiles in 1931.

<doc id="733764" wikidata="Q12335414" url="?curid=733764" title="Sinus rhythm">
<text>A sinus rhythm is any cardiac rhythm in which depolarisation of the cardiac muscle begins at the sinus node. It is necessary, but not sufficient, for normal electrical activity within the heart. On the electrocardiogram (ECG), a sinus rhythm is characterised by the presence of P waves that are normal in morphology.

The term normal sinus rhythm (NSR) is sometimes used to denote a specific type of sinus rhythm where all other measurements on the ECG also fall within designated normal limits, giving rise to the characteristic appearance of the ECG when the electrical conduction system of the heart is functioning normally; however, other sinus rhythms can be entirely normal in particular patient groups and clinical contexts, so the term is sometimes considered a misnomer and its use is sometimes discouraged.
Other types of sinus rhythm that can be normal include sinus tachycardia, sinus bradycardia, and sinus arrhythmia. Sinus rhythms may be present together with various other cardiac arrhythmias on the same ECG.

==Characteristics==
In humans, for an ECG to be described as showing a sinus rhythm, the shape of the P wave in each of the 12 standard ECG leads should be consistent with a &quot;typical P vector&quot; of +50° to +80°. This means that the P wave should be:
* always positive in lead I, lead II, and aVF
* always negative in lead aVR
* any of biphasic (–/+), positive or negative in lead aVL
* positive in all chest leads, except for V1 which may be biphasic (+/–)

If the P waves do not meet these criteria, they must be originating from an abnormal site elsewhere in the atria and not from the sinus node; the ECG cannot, therefore, be classed as showing a sinus rhythm.

In general, each P wave in a sinus rhythm is followed by a QRS complex, and the sinus rhythm therefore gives rise to the whole heart&#x27;s depolarization. Exceptions to this include complete heart block and certain ventricular artificial pacemaker rhythms, where the P waves may be completely normal in shape, but ventricular depolarization bears no relation to them; in these cases, the speed of the &quot;sinus rhythm of the atria&quot; and the speed of the ventricular rhythm must be calculated separately.

===Characteristics of normal sinus rhythm===
By convention, the term &quot;normal sinus rhythm&quot; is taken to imply that not only are the P waves (reflecting activity of the sinus node itself) normal in morphology but that all other ECG measurements are also normal. Criteria therefore include:

# Normal heart rate (classically 60 to 100 beats per minute for an adult).
# Regular rhythm, with less than 0.16-second variation in the shortest and longest durations between successive P waves
# The sinus node should pace the heart – therefore, P waves must be round, all the same shape, and present before every QRS complex in a ratio of 1:1.
# Normal P wave axis (0 to +75 degrees)
# Normal PR interval, QRS complex and QT interval.
# QRS complex positive in leads I, II, aVF and V3–V6, and negative in lead aVR.

<doc id="733768" wikidata="Q840712" url="?curid=733768" title="Ica, Peru">
<text>Ica () (Quechua: &quot;Ika&quot;) is a city and the capital of the Department of Ica in southern Peru. While the area was long inhabited by varying cultures of indigenous peoples, the Spanish &quot;conquistador&quot; Jerónimo Luis de Cabrera claimed its founding in 1563.

As of the 2017 census, it had a population of over 282,407. The city suffered extensive damage and loss of life during the 2007 Peru earthquake.

== History ==
In 2007, researchers found the fossil remains of a prehistoric penguin, &quot;Icadyptes salasi&quot;, which inhabited the Atacama Desert about 30 million years ago. Scientists estimate it was about tall, with a beak.

Evidence of prehistoric indigenous civilizations has been found in the nearby deserts, such as that of Paracas. Other cultures include the Chincha and the Inca, the latter of whom ruled this area beginning in the 14th century. Numerous pre-Columbian archeological artifacts are now displayed in the &quot;Museo Regional de Ica&quot;.

The Inca were still in power when the Spanish conquistadors invaded the territory. The Spanish colonial city was founded on 17 June 1563 by Gerónimo Luis de Cabrera as &quot;Villa de Valverde&quot;. It was ruled by Spain under colonial rulers until Peru achieved independence in 1821.

On 15 August 2007, a magnitude 8.0 earthquake occurred off the coast of Peru, severely damaging buildings, houses and infrastructure in Ica. Initially 17 people died and 70 were killed when a church collapsed. Pisco was even more severely damaged and many people were buried under buildings that had collapsed. Some 80% of the city&#x27;s buildings were destroyed.

== Geography ==
The city is located on the Ica River about to the south of Lima, along the desert coast of southern Peru. Further south along the Pan-American Highway lies the city of Nazca.
=== Climate ===

Ica lies on the border of the Atacama desert and has one of the driest climates in the world Köppen &quot;BWh&quot;, with only around 1 centimetre of rainfall for the whole year. Temperatures are hot during the summer months (December – March) and warm through the winter months (June – September).

== Transportation ==
Ica can be reached from Lima by the Pan-American Highway, a journey of .

The Tren de la Costa is planned.

==Tourism==

Ica and surrounding areas are the traditional source of Pisco brandy. Ica is the site of the &quot;Museo Regional de Ica&quot;, a regional museum with exhibits ranging from prehistoric artifacts to the Spanish colonial era. On display are pre-Columbian funerary bundles and mummies. The elongated skulls from the Paracas and pre-Inca cultures suggest ritual deformation, perhaps to mark an elite class. Some skulls also bear evidence of trepanning, a kind of early brain surgery to relieve internal pressure or remove damaged skull matter suffered in battle.

A collection of furniture, paintings and artifacts date from the Spanish colonial era.

The Department of Ica encompasses considerable desert, giving it unique opportunities for tourism. The nearby Huacachina oasis is located in the midst of sand dunes. The city of Ica attracts international travelers, as well as resort seekers from Peru. Some young visitors try sandboarding; others travel the dunes in sand buggies.
== Agriculture ==
The many days of sunshine have made Ica the center of an important agricultural region. Commodity crops are cotton, grapes, asparagus, avocado, mango, olives and other produce. It is known by Peruvians as the &quot;Land of Eternal Sun&quot;.

Although the area has four seasons, the climate is warm and dry. Visitors say that it feels like a northern summer year-round. The climate of the city can help in easing asthma, which is aggravated by damp and humid climates and their associated allergens.

The desert city has drawn water for domestic and agricultural needs from an aquifer fed by glacial melt water. The regional usage is exceeding the inflow of water into the aquifer. Because the aquifer is quickly drying up, activists have called for more efficient irrigation, or adding dams and water diversions.

<doc id="733769" wikidata="Q7674055" url="?curid=733769" title="Tacony–Palmyra Bridge">
<text>The Tacony–Palmyra Bridge is a combination steel tied-arch and double-leaf bascule bridge across the Delaware River that connects New Jersey Route 73 in Palmyra, New Jersey with Pennsylvania Route 73 in the Tacony section of Philadelphia. The bridge, designed by Polish-born architect Ralph Modjeski, has a total length of and spans . After one and a half years of construction, it opened on August 14, 1929, replacing ferry service that had operated between Tacony and Palmyra since May 6, 1922.

Owned and maintained by the Burlington County Bridge Commission of New Jersey, the bridge has a $4 cash toll and $3 E-ZPass toll for northbound (Pennsylvania-bound) traffic. Despite interruptions due to occasional openings for passing shipping traffic (the upper Delaware River is navigable as far north as Van Sciver Lake near Bristol, Pennsylvania), it serves as a lower-cost alternative to the more southerly, six-lane, high-span Betsy Ross Bridge, which charges $5 for the westbound crossing.

Built with four lanes, the bridge was modified in 1997 to have three wider lanestwo northbound towards Philadelphia and one southbound towards New Jersey. A walkway provides access for pedestrian and bicycle traffic.

The bascule draw span is located immediately east of the main, arched span. On October 10, 2013, the bascule span jammed and became stuck in the open position when a roller under the maintenance walkway seized, closing the bridge for approximately eleven hours.

In 2016, work began on rehabilitation and improved traffic controls systems, including barriers and traffic lights.

<doc id="733777" wikidata="Q7125121" url="?curid=733777" title="Pair gain">
<text>In telephony, pair gain is the transmission of multiple plain old telephone service (POTS) channels over the twisted pair local loop traditionally used for a single subscriber line in telephone systems. Pair gain has the effect of creating additional subscriber lines. This is typically used as an expedient way to solve subscriber line shortages at a location by using existing wiring, instead of installing new wires from the central office to the customer premises. The term was invented in the middle 20th century by analogy with earlier use of gain to extend telephone local loops far from the telephone exchange.

A pair gain system consists of concentrators or multiplexers which combine the individual channels into a single signal that is transmitted through the existing copper cable pair. The signals are then separated into individual subscriber lines at the customer premises. The pair gain unit which performs the multiplexing can provide a second telephone connection over a single subscriber line (called an Analog Multi-Line Carrier or AML) in circumstances where a customer wants to add a new phone line for a fax machine or dial-up internet connection. A larger analog pair gain system made by Anaconda in the 1960s provided seven lines. Some pair gain units can expand the number of subscriber lines available over a single copper pair to as many as sixty. Large pair gain units are stored in serving area interfaces or metal cabinets typically resembling small apartment-sized refrigerators alongside or near roadways that overlie communications rights-of-way.

DACS (Digital Access Carrier System) is a form of pair gain used in the United Kingdom. It uses a form of time-division multiple access called ISDN.

Analog pair gain came into disfavor in the 21st century, as it is detrimental to high speed dial-up modem connections, does not support 56k and is incompatible with digital subscriber line (DSL) systems. 20th century Subscriber Loop Carrier systems had similar problems. More recent digital pair gain systems, however, restore 56k and DSL capabilities by performing the functions of a DSLAM at the pair gain device.

More recently, the term pair gain has been used to refer to &quot;any&quot; multiplex/demultiplex unit used between the central office and end users, not just equipment used with copper twisted pair.

Where digital loop carrier (called Remote Integrated Multiplexer in Australia) is installed, broadband Internet subscribers may be disappointed when informed that although initial line checks were successful, high speed connections such as ADSL are unavailable due to infrastructure issues. The problem is that pair gain lines cannot carry high speed data.

<text>The Burlington County Bridge Commission is a public agency responsible for the operation and maintenance of several bridges in Burlington County, New Jersey, United States, across the Delaware River. It now manages eight bridges, including the Tacony-Palmyra Bridge, the Burlington-Bristol Bridge, and the Riverside-Delanco Bridge. Minor bridges operated by the Commission are the Pennsauken Creek Bridge, Pompeston Creek Bridge, Route 73 Overpass, Swede Run Bridge and the Twin Pipe Culvert, all along County Route 543.

Tolls are collected in New Jersey for traffic heading towards Pennsylvania at the Tacony-Palmyra and Burlington-Bristol Bridges. No tolls are collected for traffic crossing into New Jersey. Tolls range from $2.00 for two-axle cars, vans, light pick-up trucks and motorcycles, up to $22.50 for five-axle trucks. E-ZPass is accepted for payment of tolls. Tolls were increased on September 15, 2015. Two-Axle cars are $3.00 with EZPass / $4.00 cash.

A total of $51 million in revenue was generated from the 13.5 million toll-paying trips in 2016 on the Burlington–Bristol and Tacony–Palmyra bridges.

==History==
The Burlington County Board of Chosen Freeholders created the Burlington County Bridge Commission on October 22, 1948, and simultaneously approved the purchase by the Commission of the Burlington-Bristol and Tacony-Palmyra Bridges from a private company.

In 1962, the Commission built a single-span bridge over Route 73 and a multi-span bridge over Pennsauken Creek, on River Road.

In 1966, the Commission became responsible for almost seven miles of roadway on County Route 543 (River Road), from Route 73 in Palmyra to the halfway house in Delran, including the three bridges/structures that crossed over Pompeston Creek, Swede Run and Twin Pipe Culvert. This acquisition also included the movable Riverside-Delanco Bridge across the Rancocas Creek. This arrangement with the County was agreed upon by the Commission because River Road was considered to be a &quot;feeder road&quot; for both the Burlington-Bristol and Tacony-Palmyra Bridges.

Of the eight bridges, the Commission has one each of the three standard types of movable bridges. The Tacony-Palmyra Bridge has a double leaf bascule span, the Burlington-Bristol Bridge has a vertical lift span and the Riverside-Delanco Bridge has a horizontal swing span.

<doc id="733784" wikidata="Q1350700" url="?curid=733784" title="Cardiac stress test">
<text>A cardiac stress test is a cardiological examination that evaluates the cardiovascular system&#x27;s response to external stress within a controlled clinical setting. This stress response can be induced through physical exercise (usually a treadmill) or intravenous pharmacological stimulation of heart rate.

As the heart works progressively harder (stressed) it is monitored using an electrocardiogram (ECG) monitor. This measures the heart&#x27;s electrical rhythms and broader electrophysiology. Pulse rate, blood pressure and symptoms such as chest discomfort or fatigue are simultaneously monitored by attending clinical staff. Clinical staff will question the patient throughout the procedure asking questions that relate to pain and perceived discomfort. Abnormalities in blood pressure, heart rate, ECG or worsening physical symptoms could be indicative of coronary artery disease.

Stress testing does not accurately diagnose all cases of coronary artery disease, and can often indicate that it exists in people who do not have the condition. The test can also detect heart abnormalities such as arrhythmias, and conditions affecting electrical conduction within the heart such as various types of fascicular blocks.

A &quot;normal&quot; stress test does not offer any substantial reassurance that a future unstable coronary plaque will not rupture and block an artery, inducing a heart attack. As with all medical diagnostic procedures, data is only from a moment in time. A primary reason stress testing is not perceived as a robust method of CAD detection is that stress testing generally only detects arteries that are severely narrowed (~70% or more).

== Stress testing and echocardiography ==
A stress test may be accompanied by echocardiography. The echocardiography is performed both before and after the exercise so that structural differences can be compared.

A resting echocardiogram is obtained prior to stress. The ultrasound images obtained are similar to the ones obtained during a full surface echocardiogram, commonly referred to as transthoracic echocardiogram. The patient is subjected to stress in the form of exercise or chemically (often dobutamine). After the target heart rate is achieved, &#x27;stress&#x27; echocardiogram images are obtained. The two echocardiogram images are then compared to assess for any abnormalities in wall motion of the heart. This is used to detect obstructive coronary artery disease.

== Cardiopulmonary exercise stress testing ==
While also measuring breathing gases (e.g., oxygen saturation, maximal oxygen consumption), the test is often referred to as a cardiopulmonary exercise test. Common indications for a cardiopulmonary exercise test include evaluation of shortness of breath, workup before heart transplantation, and prognosis and risk assessment of heart failure patients.

The test is also common in sport science for measuring athletes&#x27; maximal oxygen consumption, V̇O2 max. In 2016, the American Heart Association published an official scientific statement advocating that cardiorespiratory fitness, quantifiable as V̇O2 max and measured during a cardiopulmonary exercise test, be categorized as a clinical vital sign and should be routinely assessed as part of clinical practice.

The CPX test can be done on a treadmill or cycle ergometer. In untrained subjects, V̇O2 max is 10% to 20% lower when using a cycle ergometer compared with a treadmill.

== Stress testing using injected nuclear markers ==
A nuclear stress test uses a gamma camera to image radioisotopes injected into the bloodstream. The best known example is myocardial perfusion imaging. Typically, a radiotracer (Tc-99 sestamibi, Myoview or thallous chloride 201) may be injected during the test. After a suitable waiting period to ensure proper distribution of the radiotracer, scans are acquired with a gamma camera to capture images of the blood flow. Scans acquired before and after exercise are examined to assess the state of the coronary arteries of the patient. By showing the relative amounts of radioisotope within the heart muscle, the nuclear stress tests more accurately identify regional areas of reduced blood flow.

Stress and potential cardiac damage from exercise during the test is a problem in patients with ECG abnormalities at rest or in patients with severe motor disability. Pharmacological stimulation from vasodilators such as dipyridamole or adenosine, or positive chronotropic agents such as dobutamine can be used. Testing personnel can include a cardiac radiologist, a nuclear medicine physician, a nuclear medicine technologist, a cardiology technologist, a cardiologist, and/or a nurse. The typical dose of radiation received during this procedure can range from 9.4 to 40.7 millisieverts.

== Recommended utility of this procedure ==

The American Heart Association recommends ECG treadmill testing as the first choice for patients with medium risk of coronary heart disease according to risk factors of smoking, family history of coronary artery stenosis, hypertension, diabetes and high cholesterol. In 2013, in its &quot;Exercise Standards for Testing and Training&quot;, the AHA indicated that high frequency QRS analysis during ECG treadmill test have useful test performance for detection of coronary heart disease.
* Perfusion stress test (with 99mTc labelled sestamibi) is appropriate for select patients, especially those with an abnormal resting electrocardiogram.
* Intracoronary ultrasound or angiogram can provide more information but is invasive and carries the risk of complications associated with cardiac catheterization procedures.

== Diagnostic value ==
The common approach for stress testing recommended by the American College of Cardiology and the American Heart Association involves several methods to assess cardiac health. These methods provide information for diagnosing and managing heart-related conditions. Two primary stress tests utilized are a treadmill test using ECG/electrophysiology metrics and nuclear testing, each have unique sensitivity and specificity values.

The treadmill test, employing the modified Bruce protocol, demonstrates a sensitivity range of around 73-90% and a specificity range of around 50-74%. Sensitivity refers to the percentage of individuals with the condition correctly identified by the test, while specificity denotes the percentage of individuals without the condition correctly identified as not having it. The nuclear stress test exhibits a sensitivity of 81% and a specificity ranging from 85 to 95%.

To arrive at the patient&#x27;s post test likelihood of disease, the interpretation of the stress test result necessitates the integration of the patient&#x27;s pretest likelihood with the test&#x27;s sensitivity and specificity. This method, initially introduced by Diamond and Forrester in the 1970s, provides an estimate of the patient&#x27;s post-test likelihood of disease. Stress tests have limitations in assessing the significance and nature of cardiac problems, they should be seen in context - as an initial assessment that can lead to a number of other diagnostic approaches in the broader management of cardiac diseases.

According to data from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) common first systems of coronary artery disease is a heart attack. According to the American Heart Association, a significant percentage of individuals, approximately 65% of men and 47% of women, present with a heart attack or sudden cardiac arrest as their first symptom of cardiovascular disease. Consequently, stress tests performed shortly before these events may not be highly relevant for predicting infarction in the majority of individuals tested.

== Contraindications and termination conditions ==
Stress cardiac imaging is not recommended for asymptomatic, low-risk patients as part of their routine care. Some estimates show that such screening accounts for 45% of cardiac stress imaging, and evidence does not show that this results in better outcomes for patients. Unless high-risk markers are present, such as diabetes in patients aged over 40, peripheral arterial disease, or a risk of coronary heart disease greater than 2 percent yearly, most health societies do not recommend the test as a routine procedure.

Absolute contraindications to cardiac stress test include:
* Acute myocardial infarction within 48 hours
* Unstable angina not yet stabilized with medical therapy
* Uncontrolled cardiac arrhythmia, which may have significant hemodynamic responses (e.g. ventricular tachycardia)
* Severe symptomatic aortic stenosis, aortic dissection, pulmonary embolism, and pericarditis
* Multivessel coronary artery diseases that have a high risk of producing an acute myocardial infarction
* Decompensated or inadequately controlled congestive heart failure
* Uncontrolled hypertension (blood pressure &gt; 200/110 mmHg)
* Severe pulmonary hypertension
* Acute aortic dissection
* Acutely ill for any reason

Indications for termination:
A cardiac stress test should be terminated before completion under the following circumstances:

Absolute indications for termination include:
* Systolic blood pressure decreases by more than 10 mmHg with increase in work rate, or drops below baseline in the same position, with other evidence of ischemia.
* Increase in nervous system symptoms: Dizziness, ataxia or near syncope
* Moderate to severe anginal pain (above 3 on standard 4-point scale)
* Signs of poor perfusion, e.g. cyanosis or pallor
* Request of the test subject
* Technical difficulties (e.g. difficulties in measuring blood pressure or EGC)
* ST Segment elevation of more than 1 mm in aVR, V1 or non-Q wave leads
* Sustained ventricular tachycardia

Relative indications for termination include:
* Systolic blood pressure decreases by more than 10 mmHg with increase in work rate, or drops below baseline in the same position, without other evidence of ischemia.
* ST or QRS segment changes, e.g. more than 2 mm horizontal or downsloping ST segment depression in non-Q wave leads, or marked axis shift
* Arrhythmias other than sustained ventricular tachycardia e.g. Premature ventricular contractions, both multifocal or triplet; heart block; supraventricular tachycardia or bradyarrhythmias
* Intraventricular conduction delay or bundle branch block or that cannot be distinguished from ventricular tachycardia
* Increasing chest pain
* Fatigue, shortness of breath, wheezing, claudication or leg cramps
* Hypertensive response (systolic blood pressure &gt; 250 mmHg or diastolic blood pressure &gt; 115 mmHg)

== Adverse effects ==
Side effects from cardiac stress testing may include
* Palpitations, chest pain, myocardial infarction, shortness of breath, headache, nausea or fatigue.
* Adenosine and dipyridamole can cause mild hypotension.
* As the radioactive tracers used for this test are chemically carcinogenic, frequent use of these tests carries a small risk of cancer.

== Use of pharmacological agents to stress the heart ==
Pharmacologic stress testing relies on coronary steal. Vasodilators are used to dilate coronary vessels, which causes increased blood velocity and flow rate in normal vessels and less of a response in stenotic vessels. This difference in response leads to a steal of flow and perfusion defects appear in cardiac nuclear scans or as ST-segment changes.

The choice of pharmacologic stress agents used in the test depends on factors such as potential drug interactions with other treatments and concomitant diseases.

Pharmacologic agents such as adenosine, regadenoson (Lexiscan), or dipyridamole is generally used when a patient cannot achieve adequate work level with treadmill exercise, or has poorly controlled hypertension or left bundle branch block. However, an exercise stress test may provide more information about exercise tolerance than a pharmacologic stress test.

Commonly used agents include:
* Vasodilators acting as adenosine receptor agonists, such as adenosine itself, and dipyridamole (Persantine), which acts indirectly at the receptor.
* Regadenoson (Lexiscan), which acts specifically at the adenosine A2A receptor, thus affecting the heart more than the lung.
* Dobutamine The effects of beta-agonists such as dobutamine can be reversed by administering beta-blockers such as propranolol.

Regadenoson or dobutamine is often used in patients with severe reactive airway disease (asthma or COPD) as adenosine and dipyridamole can cause acute exacerbation of these conditions. If the patient&#x27;s asthma is treated with an inhaler then it should be used as a pre-treatment prior to the injection of the pharmacologic stress agent. In addition, if the patient is actively wheezing then the physician should determine the benefits versus the risk to the patient of performing a stress test especially outside of a hospital setting. Caffeine is usually held 24 hours prior to an adenosine stress test, as it is a competitive antagonist of the A2A adenosine receptor and can attenuate the vasodilatory effects adenosine.

Aminophylline may be used to attenuate severe and/or persistent adverse reactions to adenosine and regadenoson.

==History==
Cardiac stress testing, used since the 1960s, has a history rooted in the diagnostic and prognostic assessment of patients with suspected coronary artery disease. It has evolved to evaluate inducible myocardial ischemia as an indicator of adverse outcomes. The factors influencing mortality risk have changed over time due to decreasing angina symptoms, increasing prevalence of conditions like diabetes and obesity, and the rise in pharmacologic testing for patients unable to exercise during stress tests.

Municipalities in Chihuahua are administratively autonomous of the state according to the 115th article of the 1917 Constitution of Mexico. Every three years, citizens elect a municipal president () by a plurality voting system who heads a concurrently elected municipal council () responsible for providing all the public services for their constituents. The municipal council consists of a variable number of trustees and councillors (). Municipalities are responsible for public services (such as water and sewerage), street lighting, public safety, traffic, and the maintenance of public parks, gardens and cemeteries. They may also assist the state and federal governments in education, emergency fire and medical services, environmental protection and maintenance of monuments and historical landmarks. Since 1984, they have had the power to collect property taxes and user fees, although more funds are obtained from the state and federal governments than from their own income.

The largest municipality by population is Ciudad Juárez, Mexico&#x27;s sixth largest municipality, with 1,512,450 residents or approximately of the state population. The smallest municipality by population is Huejotitán, with 824 residents. The largest municipality by land area is Ahumada, which spans , and the smallest is Santa Bárbara, which spans .

<doc id="733795" wikidata="Q1477859" url="?curid=733795" title="Millennium (TV series)">
<text>Millennium is an American television series created by Chris Carter (creator of &quot;The X-Files&quot;), which aired on Fox from October 25, 1996, to May 21, 1999. The series follows the investigations of ex-FBI agent Frank Black (Lance Henriksen), now a consultant, with the ability to see inside the minds of criminals, working for a mysterious organization known as the Millennium Group.

The series was filmed in Vancouver, British Columbia, though most episodes were ostensibly set in or around Seattle, Washington. The theme music was composed by Mark Snow, who also created the distinctive theme music for &quot;The X-Files&quot;. Although the series premiered with impressive ratings, viewership declined throughout its three-season run, and it was canceled by Fox in early 1999. A seventh-season episode of &quot;The X-Files&quot;, titled &quot;Millennium&quot;, featured the Millennium Group and Frank Black, as a way of giving the show some closure.

In 2018, &quot;Millennium&quot; was ranked #87 in Rotten Tomatoes&#x27;s 100 Best Sci-Fi TV Shows of All Time. That same year, &quot;Millennium After the Millennium&quot;, a documentary based on the show, was released. It features interviews with Carter, Henriksen and other people who worked on the show.

==Series overview==

&quot;Millennium&quot; featured Frank Black, a freelance forensic profiler and former FBI agent with a unique ability to see the world through the eyes of serial killers and murderers, though he says that he is not psychic. Black worked for the mysterious Millennium Group, whose power and sinister agenda were explored throughout the series.

Black lived in Seattle with his wife Catherine and daughter Jordan. Jordan was revealed to have inherited some measure of her father&#x27;s &quot;gift&quot;, suggesting that Frank&#x27;s abilities might be at least partly psychic, since Jordan&#x27;s are clearly natural, not learned.

The first season dealt primarily with Black pursuing various serial killers and other murderers, with only occasional references to the Group&#x27;s true purpose. The second season introduced more supernatural occurrences into the show&#x27;s mythology, with Frank often coming into conflict with forces that appeared to be apocalyptic or demonic in nature. The final season showed Frank returning to Washington, D.C., to work with the FBI following the death of his wife at the hands of the Group. He was joined by a new partner, Emma Hollis. Despite Frank&#x27;s warnings and what she herself observed, Emma ultimately joined the Group. Frank was last seen escaping from Washington, having taken Jordan from school.

After the show&#x27;s cancellation, the crossover episode &quot;Millennium&quot; was made for the television series &quot;The X-Files&quot;, serving as a de facto series finale for Frank Black&#x27;s story.

==Cast and characters==
===Main===
* Lance Henriksen as FBI Special Agent Frank Black (also appeared in &quot;The X-Files&quot; season 7) Frank is an investigator with the unique ability to see through the eyes of a killer. Prior to the series premiere, Black leaves the FBI in order to join a group of private investigators known as the Millennium consortium. Following the death of his wife in season two, Black rejoins the FBI, departing Seattle with his daughter.
* Megan Gallagher as Catherine Black (seasons 1–2, guest season 3) Catherine was a clinical social worker who counseled crime victims and confronted challenging cases. Willing to sacrifice herself, she was infected with a deadly virus mysteriously associated with the Millennium Group. Catherine appears in &quot;The Sound of Snow&quot;, as a figment of her husband&#x27;s imagination. For this appearance, Gallagher was credited as a guest star.
* Klea Scott as FBI Special Agent Emma Hollis (season 3) Hollis is a young FBI special agent who becomes Frank&#x27;s protégé in Virginia. She struggles to understand the criminal mind, and has to deal with her father&#x27;s Alzheimer&#x27;s-like disease. At the close of the series, she joins the Millennium group, much to the chagrin of Frank.

===Recurring===
* Terry O&#x27;Quinn as Peter Watts: A high-ranking member of the Millennium Group who often works with Frank on cases, though their friendship dissolves in season two and he takes on a more antagonistic role in season three.
* Brittany Tiplady as Jordan Black: Daughter of Frank and Catherine, she represents the light in the dark world where Frank works. There are suggestions throughout the series that Jordan has inherited Frank&#x27;s particular gift, which troubles him greatly. Tiplady reprises her role as Jordan in the seventh-season episode of &quot;The X-Files&quot;, titled &quot;Millennium&quot;.
* Bill Smitrovich as Lt. Robert Bletcher (season 1): A homicide detective for the Seattle police, and Frank&#x27;s best friend.
* Stephen J. Lang as Det. Bob Giebelhouse: Seattle detective with a cynical view of humanity and a penchant for gallows humor.
* CCH Pounder as Cheryl Andrews: A forensic pathologist who works for the Millennium Group.
* Sarah-Jane Redmond as Lucy Butler: A woman introduced as the hybristophilic wife of a serial killer pursued by Frank, later revealed to be a demon capable of changing her own appearance. 
* Kristen Cloke as Lara Means (season 2): A Millennium Group initiate like Frank, whose gift manifests itself as visions of angels. Much of her character arc involves being slowly drawn into the Group and its secrets.
* Allan Zinyk as Brian Roedecker (season 2): A computer wizard who was a sarcastic wisecracker created to serve as an occasional foil for the humorless Frank.
* Stephen E. Miller as Andy McClaren (season 3): An assistant director at the FBI and old friend and colleague of Frank&#x27;s from his FBI days and was instrumental in teaming up Emma Hollis with the expert profiler who had returned to the area in mid-1998. He dismissed their suspicions concerning the Millennium Group as paranoia. Miller previously appeared in the pilot episode of the series as (possibly) another character.
* Peter Outerbridge as Barry Baldwin (season 3): An &quot;aloof and arrogant&quot; FBI agent who works with Frank and Emma on several cases.

==Production==

===Development===
After Chris Carter&#x27;s success with &quot;The X-Files&quot;, the Fox Broadcasting Company asked him if he would produce another series for them. He already had an idea for creating a show based around the coming millennium of the year 2000, and it was this idea that he followed up. The Fox executives gave Carter a budget of nearly $1.5 million per episode, and allowed him to create his own &quot;look&quot; for the show. Carter has said he was influenced by the Holy Bible, Dostoyevsky and Mary Shelley in planning the series. Carter pitched &quot;Millennium&quot; to Fox as &quot;&quot;Seven&quot; in Seattle.&quot; The setting of a dark, rain-soaked city and a world-weary detective&#x27;s hunt for a religiously inspired serial killer have clear parallels with the pilot episode. One of the show&#x27;s working titles was &quot;2000&quot;, though &quot;Millennium&quot; was chosen.

For the second season, Glen Morgan and James Wong took on its management, while Carter focused on the fifth season of &quot;The X-Files&quot; and &quot;The X-Files&quot; motion picture. Morgan and Wong were consulting producers for the first season, but took over production, implementing several changes Fox wanted to try to boost ratings, which had declined during the first season. Morgan said that:

For season three, which aired in 1998, Carter took back control of the series; Morgan and Wong left to pursue their own careers. Carter, who had disapproved of the show&#x27;s shift in tone, said he changed direction and tried to connect with the &quot;roots&quot; of the first season. The show&#x27;s production team hoped to make &quot;the stories a little more accessible&quot;, and moved the action from Seattle to Washington D.C.

===Casting===
Not convinced that Lance Henriksen was right for the main role, Fox execs considered William Hurt, until learning that he had no interest in acting for television. Chris Carter sent the screenplay for the &quot;Pilot episode&quot; to Henriksen, who thought it was &quot;great&quot;. When his manager told him that it was a television script, he backed out for a while until he talked to Carter directly. Carter said about casting Henriksen:

Glen Morgan&#x27;s and James Wong&#x27;s changes reduced the emphasis on serial killers and explored government conspiracies and the machinations of the Millennium Group. In an interview with &quot;Fangoria&quot;, Wong stated that, &quot;Our problem with the first season was that the shows felt the same, because the storytelling dealt with serial killers a lot. We wanted [the second] season to have the rotation &quot;X-Files&quot; does, where there are monster shows, there are conspiracy shows, there are weird science shows and then there are more personal shows. Not to copy &quot;X-Files&quot;, but for &quot;Millennium&quot;, we want to do the kind of thing where each week when you turn it on, you&#x27;re not going to be sure what you&#x27;re going to be watching.&quot; They tried to provide a &quot;narrative drive&quot; for Frank Black by breaking up his relationship with his wife. Morgan and Wong introduced new characters, such as Lara Means and computer hacker Brian Roedecker, who was introduced for comic effect; some fans were negative about the effects.

==Broadcast and release==

===Syndication and cancellation===
&quot;Millennium&quot;&#x27;s pilot episode was watched by 17.72 million viewers in the United States. The second season premiere, &quot;The Beginning and the End&quot;, gathered a total viewership of 7.75 million in the United States. Fox decided to rebuild their primetime schedules in 1997 during the second season, airing &quot;Millennium&quot; at 9:00 pm EST on Fridays.

Fox renewed &quot;Millennium&quot; for a third season on May 20, 1998. During that season, the series faced problems with a declining viewership and pessimistic forecasts from industry insiders. Fox benched &quot;Millennium&quot; during its summer run, airing reruns of &quot;Mad TV&quot; in its time slot, without giving any official word on whether it would be renewed for a fourth season. The series was canceled, ending on a cliffhanger.

Frank Black returned in &quot;The X-Files&quot; season seven episode &quot;Millennium&quot;, which featured the final appearances of both Frank Black and his daughter, Jordan.

The FX cable network picked up the off-network rights for &quot;Millennium&quot; after its cancellation for $20–$25 million dollars. NBC Universal&#x27;s horror channel, Chiller, began airing &quot;Millennium&quot; weeknights at 7 pm Eastern (and again at 3 am Eastern the following morning) on Monday, February 4, 2008.

===Home media===

&quot;Millennium&quot; season one was released on DVD in the United States (Region 1) on July 20, 2004, season two on January 4, 2005, and season three on September 6, 2005. &quot;Millennium: The Complete Series&quot; was released on DVD on October 28, 2008. On October 4, 2006, the first, second, and third seasons were released in Region 4. &quot;The Complete Series&quot; was released on October 24, 2006, in Region 4. The show&#x27;s complete soundtrack was released on iTunes in 2003.

===Future===
The release of &quot;Millennium&quot; on DVD prompted Lance Henriksen to propose a continuation of the series. Henriksen speculated that the sales numbers behind the boxed set might be the key to reviving Frank Black. &quot;I wonder if the sales of these will tell us how many people loved the show and whether or not the movie ought to be made,&quot; Henriksen told the Sci-Fi Wire. &quot;I mean, [Frank Black] still is alive. Maybe it&#x27;s a good thing there was no closure for &quot;Millennium&quot; because now, if we did a movie, it would be good closure for me.&quot; Henriksen has gone on to support the Back to Frank Black campaign, a movement dedicated to the return of the character, explaining, &quot;I really think it is a possibility.&quot;

Creator Chris Carter has joined Henriksen in expressing an interest in a film based on &quot;Millennium&quot;. While promoting &quot;The X-Files: I Want to Believe&quot;, Carter commented that he and Henriksen have &quot;talked about that over the years&quot; and that the cast and crew who would need to be involved are interested, adding, &quot;I have ideas about how to do it.&quot; To date, 20th Century Fox has expressed no interest in such a project, even to the extent of publicly commenting on it.

Publishing house Fourth Horseman Press has released &quot;Back to Frank Black&quot; (2012), a book offering in-depth insight into the production of the series. The book features Chris Carter, Frank Spotnitz, Lance Henriksen, Brittany Tiplady and John Kenneth Muir among its writers.

==Impact==

===Critical reception===
Keith Uhlich from &quot;Slant Magazine&quot; was positive to both season one and three of &quot;Millennium&quot;, giving them both four out of five stars and saying of season one: &quot;We are racing toward an apocalypse of our own creation. This is who we are.&quot; Mike Drucker from &quot;IGN&quot; called the second season a combination of the &quot;&quot;X-Files&quot; and the violent paranoia of &quot;Se7en&quot;.&quot; &quot;Variety&quot; reviewer Jeremy Gerard compared the show to &quot;Twin Peaks&quot; and was overall positive to the series, but said &quot;I just wish it were a little more fun, that I didn&#x27;t have this nagging feeling that it wants to hurt me the next time I come around.&quot; Ken Tucker from &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; gave the show a B and said it had &quot;great visuals and a commanding performance by Henriksen.&quot; Justine Elias from &quot;The New York Times&quot; was mostly positive to the series and said &quot;If &quot;The X-Files&quot;, with its offbeat humor and conspiracy theories, wonders about those things that go bump in the night, &quot;Millennium&quot; explores the darkness – and embraces it.&quot; &quot;Daily Nebraskan&quot; said in their review that the show had &quot;a lot of potential: a good lead actor, a solid premise and a feel that will keep audiences glued to their televisions.&quot;

===Awards and nominations===

&quot;Millennium&quot; was nominated for a variety of different awards including two Primetime Emmy Awards, four American Society of Cinematographers Awards, 1 Bram Stoker Awards, three Canadian Society of Cinematographers Awards (three wins), three Golden Globe Awards, one People&#x27;s Choice Awards and five Young Artist Awards (one win). The most nominated episode is &quot;Matryoshka&quot;, Robert McLachlan became the most nominated crew member and Brittany Tiplady became the most nominated actor in the show&#x27;s history. While Lance Henriksen became the only actor from the show to be nominated for a Golden Globe Award.

<text>The Delta Blues Museum in Clarksdale, Mississippi, United States, is a museum dedicated to collecting, preserving, and providing public access to and awareness of the musical genre known as the blues. Along with holdings of significant blues-related memorabilia, the museum also exhibits and collects art portraying the blues tradition, including works by sculptor Floyd Shaman and photographer Birney Imes.

The museum is located in the Yazoo and Mississippi Valley Passenger Depot, also known as Illinois Central Passenger Depot or Clarksdale Passenger Depot, which was built in 1926 and listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1995.

==Museum==
The museum houses many artifacts related to the blues, notably the shack where blues legend Muddy Waters purportedly lived in his youth on Stovall Plantation, near Clarksdale. The shack was restored to structural stability through the intercession of Isaac Tigrett the House of Blues owner and transported from Stovall Plantation on a tour of HoB venues before being returned to Mississippi to the museum and rebuilt inside.

There is a 2003 30-minute documentary of the same name.

In 2013, a marker was placed outside of the museum as part of the Mississippi Blues Trail.

The museum has been visited by many notable artists such as Eric Clapton and Paul Simon. The Texas-based rock band ZZ Top, especially front man Billy Gibbons, have made this museum their pet project and have raised thousands of dollars in support.

The museum also focuses on educating young people interested in learning to play musical instruments.

==Railroad building==
The building was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1995. The museum then moved into the former railroad depot in 1999. The circa 1918 brick building served as the passenger rail depot of the Yazoo and Mississippi Valley Railroad and later the freight depot of Illinois Central Railroad.
