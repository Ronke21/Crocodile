<text>The Zerega Avenue station is a local station on the IRT Pelham Line of the New York City Subway. Located at Zerega Avenue and Westchester Avenue in the Westchester Square neighborhood of the Bronx, it is served by the 6 train at all times except weekdays in the peak direction, when the &lt;6&gt; train takes over.
==History==

This station was built as part of the Pelham Line, which was part of the Dual Contracts, signed on March 19, 1913, and also known as the Dual Subway System. The Pelham Line was proposed to be a branch of the Lexington Avenue Line running northeast via 138th Street, Southern Boulevard and Westchester Avenue to Pelham Bay Park. This station opened on October 24, 1920, with the line&#x27;s extension from East 177th Street to Westchester Square. Service was initially served by a mix of through and shuttle trains during the 1920s.

From July 5, 2014, to April 27, 2015, as part of a $109 million rebuilding project at five Pelham Line stations, this station, along with Buhre Avenue, was closed for station rehabilitation work.

==Station layout==
This elevated station has three tracks and two side platforms. The center track is not used in regular service. The 6 local train serves the station at all times except rush hours in the peak direction, when the &lt;6&gt; express train serves the station instead. The next stop to the south is Castle Hill Avenue, while the next stop to the north is Westchester Square–East Tremont Avenue.

It resembles other elevated stations along the line: it has wood mezzanines and no windscreens along the platform edges.

<text>The Westchester Square–East Tremont Avenue station (formerly Westchester Square station) is a local station on the IRT Pelham Line of the New York City Subway. Located at the intersection of East Tremont and Westchester Avenues in the Westchester Square neighborhood of the Bronx, it is served by the 6 train at all times except weekdays in the peak direction, when the &lt;6&gt; train takes over.
==History==
This station was built as part of the Pelham Line, which was part of the Dual Contracts, signed on March 19, 1913, and also known as the Dual Subway System. The Pelham Line was proposed to be a branch of the Lexington Avenue Line running northeast via 138th Street, Southern Boulevard and Westchester Avenue to Pelham Bay Park. This station opened on October 24, 1920 as the line&#x27;s new terminal with the line&#x27;s extension from East 177th Street. Service was initially served by a mix of through and shuttle trains during the 1920s.

In 1981, the Metropolitan Transportation Authority listed the station among the 69 most deteriorated stations in the subway system.

Under the 2015–2019 MTA Capital Program, the station, along with thirty other New York City Subway stations, was to undergo a complete overhaul and would have been entirely closed for up to 6 months. Updates would have included cellular service, Wi-Fi, charging stations, improved signage, and improved station lighting. However, these renovations were deferred due to a lack of funding. Regardless, the station was closed in one direction for approximately two months (one month per direction) to facilitate ADA accessibility renovations.

As part of a revision to the Capital Program in April 2018, the MTA announced that the station would have elevators installed, making the station ADA-accessible. By February 2021, funding had been committed to accessibility renovations at the station. In December 2021, the MTA awarded a contract for the installation of elevators at eight stations, including the Westchester Square station. The project, which also included structural repairs and restoration of historic features, cost $122.5 million. , the project was scheduled to be completed in May 2024, but the elevators did not open until January 2025.

== Station layout ==
This elevated station has three tracks and two side platforms. The center track is not used in regular service. The 6 local train serves the station at all times except rush hours in the peak direction, when the &lt;6&gt; express train serves the station instead. The next stop to the south is Zerega Avenue, while the next stop to the north is Middletown Road.

As part of the MTA Arts &amp; Design program, the station features a stained glass artwork by Romare Bearden, which is known variously as &quot;City of Light&quot; or &quot;City of Glass&quot;. The artwork, a triptych measuring across, depicts a subway train traveling past a skyline. It was designed in 1982 but not installed until 1993, after Bearden died.

There are glass block tile and &quot;uptown&quot; and &quot;downtown&quot; directional mosaics in the mezzanine. From the northbound platform, there is a good view of the Bronx–Whitestone and Throgs Neck Bridges. Westchester Yard is located railroad north of the station, to the west of the Pelham Line itself. There are no windscreens.

===Exit===
The station&#x27;s only exit is a mezzanine beneath the tracks in Westchester Square. Outside fare control, a stair and an elevator lead to the northeast corner of Westchester Avenue and Lane Avenue.

<text>The Middletown Road station is a local station of the IRT Pelham Line of the New York City Subway. Located at Middletown Road and Westchester Avenue in the Pelham Bay neighborhood of the Bronx, it is served by the 6 train at all times except weekdays in the peak direction, when the &lt;6&gt; train takes over.

== History ==

=== Construction and opening ===
In 1913, New York City, the Brooklyn Rapid Transit Company, and the Interborough Rapid Transit Company (IRT) reached an agreement, known as the Dual Contracts, to dramatically expand subway service across the city. The portion of the agreement between New York City and the IRT was known as Contract 3. As part of this contract, the IRT agreed to construct a branch of the original subway, which opened in 1904, north along Lexington Avenue with branches along Jerome Avenue and a three-track branch running northeast via 138th Street, Southern Boulevard and Westchester Avenue to Pelham Bay Park.

The construction of the Lexington Avenue Line, in conjunction with the construction of the Broadway–Seventh Avenue Line would change the operations of the IRT system. Instead of having trains go via Broadway, turning onto 42nd Street, before finally turning onto Park Avenue, there would be two trunk lines connected by the 42nd Street Shuttle. The system would be changed from looking like a &quot;Z&quot; system on a map to an &quot;H&quot; system. One trunk would run via the new Lexington Avenue Line down Park Avenue, and the other trunk would run via the new Seventh Avenue Line up Broadway.

This station opened on December 20, 1920, as part of the final extension of the Pelham Line from Westchester Square to Pelham Bay Park. Service to Pelham Bay Park was originally provided by a mix of through and shuttle trains during the 1920s.

=== Renovation ===
From October 5, 2013, to May 4, 2014, the station was closed for rehabilitation work. The Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA) was sued for violating the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) by not including elevators in the renovation. The United States Department of Justice joined the lawsuit as a plaintiff in 2018, and a federal judge ruled in 2019 that the MTA had indeed violated the ADA. The MTA announced in December 2024 that elevators at Middletown Road would be installed as part of the agency&#x27;s 2020–2024 capital plan.

==Station layout==
This elevated station has two side platforms and three tracks. The center express track is not used in regular service. South of the station are track leads to Westchester Yard, the main yard for all 6 and &lt;6&gt; trains. The center and Manhattan-bound local tracks rise above these leads. The 6 local train serves the station at all times except rush hours in the peak direction, when the &lt;6&gt; express train serves the station instead. The next stop to the south is Westchester Square–East Tremont Avenue, while the next stop to the north is Buhre Avenue.

Both platforms have beige windscreens and red canopies with green frames and support columns in the center. On either ends are white waist-high steel fences with sodium lampposts at regular intervals. The station name signs are in the standard black plates with white Helvetica lettering.

===Exits===
This station has one wooden elevated mezzanine below the platforms and tracks. Two staircases from the center of each platform go down to the mezzanine, where a turnstile bank provides access to and from the station. Outside fare control, there is a token booth and two street stairs. One goes south down to the triangular corner of Middletown Road and Westchester Avenue and the other to the north side of Westchester Avenue.

<doc id="729088" wikidata="Q7163020" url="?curid=729088" title="Penistone Grammar School">
<text>Penistone Grammar School (PGS) is a large co-educational secondary school with a sixth form located in Penistone, South Yorkshire, England.

Founded in 1392, it is amongst the oldest extant schools in England, with alumni including Nicholas Saunderson, the probable inventor of Bayes theorem, in the 18th century. At various times in its history it has been single-sex and mixed, free and fee-paying, selective and comprehensive, boarding and day. It has undergone several moves and extensions, and today houses around 1,700 pupils from age 11 to 18. PGS&#x27; Ofsted overall rating is grade 2 (&#x27;Good&#x27;), following an inspection in February 2023.

==History==

The school was founded as the Free Grammar School of Penistone (then often spelt &#x27;Peniston&#x27;) in 1392, when it is recorded that a gift of land was made by Thomas Clarel, Lord of the Manor at Penistone, to John Del Rodes &quot;and others&quot;. The land, Kirk Flatt, was situated in the town centre on a site opposite St. John the Baptist Church (a site later rebuilt as the Sheffield Union Bank, which later became an HSBC branch, and is today the Vault restaurant).Penistone Grammar School&#x27;s foundation deed:
Thomas Clarel, Dominus (that is Lord) de Peniston in 1392, granted to John del Rodes and others a piece of land in the Kirk-flatt, sicut se extendit et jacet inter quinque lapides per manus predicti Thomas Clarel pro metis positos, with license to grave turf on the Moors of Penistone.Thomas Clarel was born 28 Edward III 1355, and died by drowning in the River Don, on 1 May 1442. His will was dated 20 November 1441, and he was buried in the friary church, Tickhill, near the family&#x27;s hall. The school was originally an all-boys grammar school, accepting both boarders and day pupils.

In 1443 the Free Grammar School of Penistone received further bequests and in 1547, after the dissolution of the chantries, the school continued as the free school for the children of Penistone. Following further endowments, the school was rebuilt in 1714.

PGS played a role in creating association football. In 1836, headmaster Samuel Sunderland brought a football game to PGS from the University of Cambridge. At that time, most schools has their own ball games but when students at Cambridge wanted to play together they had to agree on one style, which later was published as the Cambridge rules. His PGS student John Charles Shaw took this game to the first two FA clubs, Sheffield F.C. in 1857 and Hallam F.C. in 1860, which first wrote their own Sheffield rules then merged them with Cambridge&#x27;s to create the modern laws of the game in 1863. Another student, John Marsh, founded Sheffield Wednesday F.C. in 1867.

In 1886, the Charities Commission restructured the school, replacing the majority of its trustees with local government representation.

In 1893, the school withdrew from its town centre site to a position about half a mile north-west of the town centre, at Weirfield House. The school remains on this site.

Girls were admitted for the first time in 1907 (though mixed-sex classes were not until 1911). Fulford was the last headmaster to see boarders, with PGS becoming a day school in 1921.

On 28 October 1911, under the tenure of Mr Fulford, the Fulford building opened (though not called that at the time), at a cost of £8,000 (plus £780 for furnishings and equipment). Several other buildings were erected, and in 1974, PGS purchased the former Penistone Union Workhouse, later named &#x27;Netherfields&#x27;, which became the school&#x27;s sixth form.

It became fully comprehensive in 1969, with partial selection (for more distant pupils) from 1957. The school has retained its grammar school name and traditions such as the house system and speech night. 

In 2011 the school entirely demolished all buildings (except Weirfield and its Stables, which were converted into flats) and replaced them with a new modern building.

The school uses a badge based on the coat of arms of the founding family, the Clarels, which shows six martlets, from which the school colors red and black are derived. The school&#x27;s traditional motto is &quot;Disce Aut Discede&quot; (&quot;Learn or leave&quot;) but since 2010 it has used &quot;Never Stop Flying&quot;, a reference to martlets having no feet so always being in flight.

==Present day==
A £35-million school building opened on 2 May 2011, with a complete demolition of the old buildings, except for Fulford, the Stables, and Weirfield. Fulford, erected in 1909, was demolished in 2014 after protest from past students and locals.

In 2017, Penistone Grammar School introduced a controversial, zero tolerance style &#x27;Values Driven Expectations&#x27; behaviour management scheme, under which a pupil could be reprimanded for forgetting a pen or leaving their shirt untucked.

After internal remodelling in 2018, work started on a £4.3 million two-storey extension in 2019, providing an additional 250 places at the school. The building was opened to students in September 2020, and is linked to the main school by a walkway through the science department. The block is home to the modern foreign languages department and several science classrooms.

As of 2022, Penistone Grammar School is the only secondary school in the Metropolitan Borough of Barnsley not to have academy status, remaining under the control of the Local Authority.

The sixth form at Penistone currently has 300 students in attendance. Penistone Grammar School is the only school in the Local Education Authority of Barnsley to have a sixth form alongside its secondary provision.

The school maintains a 30 acre site in the west of Penistone, including extensive playing fields, used mostly for association football, rugby, cricket, and athletics. Facilities include a gym, dance studio, 3G football pitches and tennis courts. It has a theatre and music studios. It has a Combined Cadet Force.

=== Secondary results ===
Penistone Grammar School&#x27;s secondary results are the best of any school in the Barnsley local authority, achieving an above average Progress 8 score of 0.46. In 2023, 83% of pupils passed English and maths, with 66% of pupils achieved a grade 5 (strong pass) or higher.

=== Sixth Form results ===
The sixth form has been within the top 10% of providers nationally for over five consecutive years. The majority (55%) of grades secured are A* or A, and in 2022, the average result was an A-.

== Penistone Grammar School Foundation ==
The Penistone Grammar School Foundation is a charity (number 529458) established in January 1957, but registered in 1965. It owns much of the school&#x27;s old Kirk Flatt site and its current estate, which generates income for the school.

== Houses ==
The school maintains a house system, with each being named after locally significant people and its former buildings. Prefects remain members of their original house but join an additional group known as &quot;Clarels&quot; and wear red.

<doc id="729090" wikidata="Q2617642" url="?curid=729090" title="Buhre Avenue station">
<text>The Buhre Avenue station (, rhyming with &quot;pure&quot;) is a local station on the IRT Pelham Line of the New York City Subway. Located at the intersection of Buhre and Westchester Avenues in the Pelham Bay neighborhood of the Bronx, it is served by the train at all times except weekdays in the peak direction, when the &lt;6&gt; train takes over.
== History ==
This station opened on December 20, 1920 with the extension of the Pelham Line from Westchester Square to Pelham Bay Park. Service was originally provided by a mix of through and shuttle trains during the 1920s.

From July 5, 2014, to April 27, 2015, as part of a $109 million rebuilding project at five Pelham Line stations, this station, along with Zerega Avenue, was closed for station rehabilitation work.

==Station layout==

There are three tracks and two side platforms. The center track is not used in regular service. The 6 local train serves the station at all times except rush hours in the peak direction, when the &lt;6&gt; express train serves the station instead. The next stop to the south is Middletown Road, while the next stop to the north is Pelham Bay Park. It resembles other elevated stations along the line in that it has a wood mezzanine and no windscreens along the platform edges.

The platform lights are sodium vapor, but the wood mezzanine only has old-style lights that are quite dim. There are non-working old lights on the platform, covered old signs, and two extra exits from the fare control area. Holding lights have been added in two places along the uptown platform, so that trains can be kept at this station when the two tracks at the Pelham Bay Park terminal are occupied.

===Exits===
The station&#x27;s only exit is a mezzanine beneath the tracks. Outside fare control, stairs lead to the northern, western, and southern corners of the seven-pointed intersection of Westchester, Buhre, Crosby, and Edison Avenues.

<text>Ulrich Inderbinen (3 December 1900 in Zermatt, Valais – 14 June 2004) was a Swiss mountain guide famous for his longevity and love for mountain climbing. He had been on the top of Matterhorn over 370 times and made his last ascent of it when he was 90. Though he was not the first to summit the Matterhorn, he may have done it the best. His fame laid not in conquering mountains but safely guiding visitors to the top.

He took up ski-racing for the first time at the age of 82 when he discovered that he was the only competitor in his age group for the local annual ski guides&#x27; race.

<doc id="729094" wikidata="Q2225717" url="?curid=729094" title="Pelham Bay Park station">
<text>The Pelham Bay Park station is the northern terminal station of the IRT Pelham Line of the New York City Subway. Located across from Pelham Bay Park, at the intersection of the Bruckner Expressway and Westchester Avenue in the Pelham Bay neighborhood of the Bronx, it is served by the 6 train at all times, except weekdays in the peak direction, when the &lt;6&gt; serves it.

== History ==
In 1913, New York City, the Brooklyn Rapid Transit Company, and the Interborough Rapid Transit Company (IRT) reached an agreement, known as the Dual Contracts, to drastically expand subway service across New York City. As part of Contract 3 of the agreement, between New York City and the IRT, the original subway opened by the IRT in 1904 to City Hall, was to be extended north from Grand Central along Lexington Avenue into the Bronx, with a branch running northeast via 138th Street, Southern Boulevard and Westchester Avenue to Pelham Bay Park. The IRT Lexington Avenue Line opened on July 17, 1918, and the first section of the IRT Pelham Line opened to Third Avenue–138th Street on August 1, 1918.

On January 7, 1919, the Pelham Line was extended to Hunts Point Avenue. The extension was originally supposed to be finished by the end of 1918, but due to the difficulty in acquiring materials, the opening was delayed. In January 1919, the New York State Public Service Commission was acquiring property for a subway yard at Pelham Bay Park. On May 30, 1920, the Pelham Line was extended to East 177th Street. Service between Hunts Point Avenue and East 177th Street was originally served by a shuttle service operating with elevated cars. On October 24 of the same year, it was extended to Westchester Square. The line was completed to Pelham Bay Park station on December 20, which became the new terminal of the line. Service to Pelham Bay Park was served by a mix of through and shuttle trains during the 1920s.

===Renovations===
As part of the 1968 Program for Action, the Pelham Line would have been extended to a modern terminal nearby in the Co-op City housing complex, and the Pelham Line would have been converted to B Division standards so lettered trains could use the line. As part of the plan, this station would no longer be the line&#x27;s terminal. Because of the 1975 New York City fiscal crisis, most of the remaining projects did not have funding, so they were declined. If built, the extension would have been completed by the mid-1970s or early 1980s.

In 1981, the Metropolitan Transportation Authority listed the station among the 69 most deteriorated stations in the subway system.

The station&#x27;s elevators were installed in December 1989, making the station one of the earliest to comply with the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990. The elevators were renovated from June 8, 2015 to April 2016, three months after work was expected to be completed.

==Station layout==


This is an elevated station which has two tracks, one island platform and two disused side platforms. The tracks end at bumper blocks at the north end of the platforms. The station was formerly set up as a Spanish solution with alighting passengers using the side platforms and boarding passengers using the island platform. Now all passengers use the island platform. The 6 local train serves the station at all times except rush hours in the peak direction, when the &lt;6&gt; express train serves the station instead. The station is the northern terminus for all service; the next stop to the south is Buhre Avenue.

During 2005, rooms were located on the side platforms for temporary crew use while the crew quarters at the north end of the station was rebuilt. At the south end is a staff-only crossover bridge between the center and west side platform. It also used to connect to the east side platform but that portion has been removed. There is also a tower and crew facilities at the south end. There are old style signs which are covered over on the main platform.

Pelham Bay Park is the only New York City Subway terminal that does not use numerical track labels, but rather track labels based on compass directions (i.e. East track, West track). Punch boxes exist, however, at the south end of the island platform where the corresponding track numbers (Track 1 and 2) are used.

===Exits===
Fare control is in the mezzanine below the platforms. There are two staircases, an escalator, and an elevator that lead to Westchester Avenue. There is also a pedestrian bridge from the station entrance that crosses the Bruckner Expressway and leads to Pelham Bay Park.

==&quot;The Taking of Pelham One Two Three&quot; superstition==
In the novel &quot;The Taking of Pelham One Two Three&quot; by Morton Freedgood and its film adaptations (the 1974 original and the 1998 and 2009 remakes), the train that&#x27;s hijacked leaves the Pelham Bay Park station at 1:23 pm, whence the callsign. After the 1974 film&#x27;s release, the New York City Transit Authority banned any schedule of a train leaving this station at 1:23 am or 1:23 pm, realizing that it would become too much of a reminder to the public. Eventually this policy was rescinded, but due to the superstitions involved, dispatchers have continued to avoid scheduling a Manhattan-bound train to leave at 1:23.

<text>Superhero League of Hoboken is an adventure and role-playing video game developed and published by Legend Entertainment. Designed by Steve Meretzky, the game combines the superhero, comedy and post-apocalypse genres. It was available on both floppy disk and CD-ROM. It uses 256 color 2D graphics. It was re-released in 2019 with support for Windows, macOS, and Linux.

==Setting==
In the future, the world is ravaged by wars, nuclear disasters and pollution. Mutations become common, resulting to individuals and creatures with mutant superpowers who unite in crime and become supervillains. However other individuals decide to unite their powers for the common good and become superheroes.

The game is set in the post-apocalyptic New Jersey-New York-Pennsylvania Tri-state area, where the player controls a team of off-beat and often useless superheroes who battle a number of strange enemies, most notably the evil Dr. Entropy, a human jack-in-the-box with plans to bring chaos in the world.

The missions in the game were typically bizarre and often satirised present-day society.

==Characters==
Anytime the player can choose their team from a retinue of off-beat characters. The protagonist is the Crimson Tape, whose power is to make organizational charts. His companions are the Iron Tummy, who can eat any amount of spicy food without suffering intestinal distress, Treader Man who is a fantastic swimmer, the Tropical Oil Man, who defeats villains by giving them high cholesterol, the Oxide Man who can damage mechanical enemies such as robots etc.

Every character has three stats which help him in battle: Brawn stat determines weapon damage, Brains affects the effectiveness of super powers, and Toughness is the character&#x27;s defense.

Each character can be taught or achieve secondary superpowers by drinking colored liquids bought or found anywhere in the game. Superpowers mostly are used in combat, although the superpowers of some characters are just a part of the plot (e.g. for solving certain puzzles).

==Development==
Due to designer Steve Meretzky&#x27;s heavy freelance workload during development of &quot;Superhero League of Hoboken&quot;, he contracted a friend to help with the game&#x27;s programming in the last months of 1993.

==Reception==
According to game designer Meretzky, &quot;Superhero League of Hoboken&quot; sold only 20,000-25,000 copies, which he considered &quot;pretty disappointing.&quot; 

&quot;Computer Gaming World&quot;″s August 1994 preview of the game stated that &quot;Legend has gone beyond the boundaries of graphic adventures and interbred their traditional fare with elements of computer role-playing&quot;. Two month later in the October issue, Scorpia wrote, &quot;[&quot;Superhero League of Hoboken&quot;] is lightweight fare, and as such, may disappoint those looking for challenging puzzles. On the other hand, this zany melange makes up what is the first true comedy CRPG ever, and that alone is worth the price of admission.&quot; 

In the October 1994 edition of &quot;PC Gamer US&quot; (Issue 5) Trent Ward called the game &quot;an exciting mix of adventure and role-playing, perfect for the gamer who&#x27;s more concerned with game play than graphics.&quot; He stated that it &quot;isn&#x27;t a game that will change the face of entertainment for years to come, but in the end it really is pretty good fun.&quot;

In the October 1994 edition of &quot;PC Gamer UK&quot; (Issue 11), James Leach summarized &quot;Superhero League of Hoboken&quot; as &quot;good&quot;, but he believed that those who &quot;don&#x27;t like the surrealism ... will soon get bored.&quot;

In the May 1995 edition of &quot;Dragon&quot; (Issue 217), Lester Smith admitted that &quot;Some people may find a few aspects of the game tasteless.&quot; But he thought those elements were minor, and that the game &quot;provides quite a bit of entertainment. Its unique characters, captivating missions, overarching story line, and engaging details of play result in a satisfying sense of role-playing.&quot; 

===Awards===
The game was nominated for &quot;Computer Gaming World&quot;″s 1994 &quot;Role-Playing Game of the Year&quot; award. The editors remarked that &quot;Superhero League of Hoboken&quot; &quot;broke most of the rules&quot;, and that its &quot;goofy dialogue and storyline, and well-balanced gameplay, make for a wild ride through designer Steve Meretzky&#x27;s left-of-center imagination.&quot;

<text>Questprobe is a trilogy of graphic adventure video games featuring Marvel Comics characters. The three games are &quot;Questprobe featuring The Hulk&quot;, &quot;Questprobe featuring Spider-Man&quot; and &quot;&quot;.

==History==
In 1983, Marvel Comics searched for a licensee for use of its characters in a home computer game, and approached Adventure International; its founder and CEO Scott Adams was interested in the venture as an avid reader of Marvel since his childhood, and the two parties agreed to a contract on December 1, 1983. Marvel&#x27;s ten-year license for Adventure&#x27;s use of its characters was Marvel&#x27;s first long-term license, as well as Adventure&#x27;s first use of licensed characters. Adams, given unlimited freedom in creating the games, spent an afternoon coordinating a rough overview of the series with Marvel writer John Byrne, and Bob Budiansky would oversee the entire project. The series title came from Adams&#x27;s attempt to formulate a title that would indicate the player&#x27;s involvement in a search. The Hulk was selected as the star of the first installment because of his widespread recognition among general audiences, and the game would be the Hulk&#x27;s first appearance within the medium. &quot;Questprobe featuring The Hulk&quot; was released on May 1, 1984, for the Acorn Electron, Apple II, Atari 8-bit computers, BBC Micro, Commodore 64, Dragon 32, IBM PC compatibles, and ZX Spectrum. The game&#x27;s release was accompanied by a comic similarly titled &quot;Questprobe&quot;, with the first issue centering on the Hulk being tricked into saving a doomed planet. Because wholesalers had no provisions for distributing comics, Adventure International decided to reduce the size of subsequent issues in order to package the comics along with the games.

In January 1985, Adams revealed that he was developing a second &quot;Questprobe&quot; game with Al Milgrom based on Spider-Man, and disclosed plans to release a new game every three to five months, with a projected total of twelve or thirteen games. Subsequent games involving Human Torch and Captain America were planned at the time, as were potential games showcasing Iron Man and a villain character.

==Cancelled X-Men game==
The fourth title in the series was to include the X-Men. This game was partly coded by Scott Adams but never saw the light of day as a published game, as Adventure International became bankrupt during its development in 1986.

==Comic book tie-ins==
A &quot;Questprobe&quot; comic book tie-in was also released. Originally intended as a 12-issue miniseries, this series was canceled after issue #3 (November 1985) due to Adventure International&#x27;s bankruptcy. The story intended for issue #4, featuring the X-Men, was published in &quot;Marvel Fanfare&quot; #33 (July 1987).
The events of the &quot;Questprobe&quot; comic book were later followed up on in the &quot;Quasar&quot; series. The Chief Examiner from the game and comics received an entry in the &quot;Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe Deluxe Edition&quot; #2 (January 1986).

== Fee and allowances payable ==
Fee and allowances payable to the law officers (including Attorney General of India, Solicitor General of India and the Additional Solicitors General) of the Government of India are as under:

In addition to the above fee payable for cases, a retainer fee is paid to the attorney general of India, Solicitor General of India and the Additional Solicitors General at the rate of ₹50,000, ₹40,000 and ₹30,000 per month, respectively. Moreover, the attorney general of India is also paid a sumptuary allowance of Rs. 4,000 per month, except during the period of his leave.

== Politicisation of the Attorney General ==

It has evolved into a customary practice for the Attorney General to submit their resignation upon the inception of a new government. As the appointee of the government, the Attorney General serves as its advocate, implying a lack of complete neutrality. Nevertheless, holding a constitutional mandate, the Attorney General&#x27;s viewpoints are subject to public scrutiny. Nonetheless, instances have arisen where the Attorney General&#x27;s positions appear to have been notably influenced by political considerations.

During some of the AG tenures, it has been felt that the attorney general has gone too far. Niren De during Indira Gandhi replied to a question by Hans Raj Khanna stating that even the right to life can be suspended during emergency.

Similarly, in 2005, when the UPA government was planning a possible coalition with Mayawati, Milon K. Banerjee&#x27;s opinion absolving Mayawati in the Taj corridor case was ignored by the Supreme Court. In a direct condemnation of the government which asked the CBI to heed attorney general Milon Banerjee&#x27;s opinion and close the case against Mayawati, the Supreme Court told the agency not to go solely on the AG&#x27;s opinion and place all evidence before it.

In 2009, Milon K. Banerjee&#x27;s opinion absolving Ottavio Quattrocchi in the Bofors scandal has also been viewed as &quot;devaluing and eroding the Attorney General&#x27;s position&quot;.

During the UPA-II government (2009–2014), the conduct of Attorney General Goolam Vahanvati was criticised in a number of cases. In 2G spectrum case, he became the first attorney general in India&#x27;s history who had to testify as a witness in a corruption case in a trial court. In late April 2013, in coal-gate scandal, Vahanvati was accused of misrepresenting facts in the top-most court of India. Again in the same case, Vahanvati&#x27;s role came under scrutiny after allegations of impropriety and coercion emerged from his junior law officer, Harin P. Raval, who resigned from the post of Additional Solicitor General as a result.

<doc id="729141" wikidata="Q59549" url="?curid=729141" title="Krzysztof Piesiewicz">
<text>Krzysztof Marek Piesiewicz (; born 25 October 1945 in Warsaw, Poland) is a Polish lawyer, screenwriter, and politician. From 1991 to 1993 and from 1997 to 2011 he was a member of Polish Senate. He was the head of the Social Movement (RS) or Social Movement Party.

==Life==

Piesiewicz studied law at Warsaw University and began practicing in 1973. Through the late 1970s he became increasingly involved in political cases, defending opponents of the Communist regime, serving as a legal advisor for Solidarity, and assisting in the successful prosecution of the murderers of Jerzy Popiełuszko.

In 1982, he met the film director Krzysztof Kieślowski, who was planning to direct a documentary on political show trials in Poland under martial law. Piesiewicz agreed to help, though he doubted whether an accurate film could be made within the constraints of the judicial system; indeed, the filmmakers found that their presence in court seemed to be affecting the outcomes of cases, often improving the prospects of the accused, but making it hard to capture judicial abuses.

Kieślowski decided to explore the issue through fiction instead, and the two collaborated for the first time as writers on the feature film &quot;No End&quot;, released in 1984.

Piesewicz returned to his law career, but remained in touch with Kieślowski and three years later persuaded him to create a series of films based on the Ten Commandments. This series, &quot;Dekalog&quot;, explored the filmmakers&#x27; mutual interest in moral and ethical dilemmas in contemporary social and political life, and achieved (belated) critical acclaim around the world.

Their later collaborations, &quot;The Double Life of Véronique&quot; and &quot;Three Colours&quot; (&quot;Blue&quot;, &quot;White&quot;, &quot;Red&quot;), focused on metaphysical questions of personal choice and appeared relatively apolitical, though the latter series was based on Piesiewicz&#x27;s idea of dramatizing the French political ideals of liberty, equality, and fraternity in the same way they had previously dramatized the Ten Commandments.

Piesiewicz was credited as co-writer on all of Kieślowski&#x27;s projects after &quot;No End&quot;, the last of which was &quot;Nadzieja&quot;, directed by Stanislaw Mucha after Kieślowski&#x27;s death. He has begun writing a new series of films, &quot;The Stigmatised&quot;; the first of these, &quot;Silence&quot;, was directed by Michał Rosa and released in 2002.

==Career in politics==

Piesiewicz&#x27;s career in electoral politics began in 1989, when he began working in the Social Movement for Solidarity Electoral Action (RS AWS) party, originally the political wing of the Solidarity union and the leading party in the center-right AWS coalition. In 1991 he was elected to the Polish Senate, served for two years, then returned in 1997. In 2002, RS AWS changed its name to RS and elected Piesiewicz as its leader; he officiated until the dissolution of the party in 2004. From 2005 to 2009, Piesiewicz belonged to Platforma Obywatelska&#x27;s club in the Senate, but did not belong to the party itself. In 2011 he did not run for reelection.

He has been described as having &quot;lobbied hard against capital punishment, writing countless articles in the Polish press&quot;.

==Personal life==

He is divorced from his ex-wife Maria. He is Roman Catholic.

<doc id="729142" wikidata="Q665708" url="?curid=729142" title="Beechcraft King Air">
<text>The Beechcraft King Air is a line of American utility aircraft produced by Beechcraft. The King Air line comprises a number of twin-turboprop models that have been divided into two families. The Model 90 and 100 series developed in the 1960s are known as King Airs, while the later T-tail Model 200 and 300 series were originally marketed as Super King Airs, with the name &quot;Super&quot; being dropped by Beechcraft in 1996 (although it is still often used to differentiate the 200 and 300 series King Airs from their smaller stablemates).

The King Air was the first aircraft in its class and was produced continuously from 1964 to 2021. It outsold all of its turboprop competitors combined. It has recently faced competition from light jet aircraft such as the Embraer Phenom 100, Honda HA-420 HondaJet and Cessna Citation Mustang; as well as from newer turboprop aircraft including the Piaggio P180 Avanti, and single-engine Piper Malibu Meridian, Pilatus PC-12, and Socata TBM.

==Development==


===Model 90 series===

The Model 90 King Air was conceived as the Model 120 in 1961. In its original planned configuration, the Model 120 was to have been powered by two Turbomeca Bastan VI engines. On May 15, 1963, Beechcraft began test flights of the proof-of-concept Model 87, a modified Queen Air with Pratt &amp; Whitney Canada PT6A-6 engines. On July 14, Beech announced a new type, and a month later began accepting orders for the &quot;King Air&quot;, with deliveries to commence in Autumn 1964. On January 24, 1964, the first definitive prototype, by now designated Model 65-90 and also fitted with PT6A-6 engines, flew for the first time. After 10 months of test flying, in 1964 the Model 87 was delivered to the United States Army as the NU-8F. The first production aircraft was delivered on October 8, and by the end of the month, 152 aircraft had been ordered; by year&#x27;s end, seven had been built.

In 1966, after 112 65-90s were completed, production switched to the Model 65-A90 with PT6A-20 engines. As a measure of the type&#x27;s popularity, 206 65-A90s were built in less than two years when production switched to the Model B90, the first of these rolling off the production line in 1968. Military versions built during these years included the 65-A90-1, 65-A90-2, 65-A90-3, and 65-A90-4, all being unpressurised models based on the Model 87. These were produced for the US Army which designated them U-21s of various sub-models; many were fitted out for electronic battlefield surveillance. A total of 162 of these were built between 1967 and 1971.

A total of 184 B90 models were produced before the Model C90 was introduced in 1971, with wingspan increased over earlier models by to 50 ft 3 in (15.32 m), Maximum Take-Off Weight (MTOW) increased by to 9,650 lb (4,378 kg), and PT6A-20A engines. The broadly similar Model E90 was introduced the following year, with PT6A-28 engines; the two were produced in parallel. Further refinement of the 90 series resulted in the Model F90 and follow-on Model F90-1. The F-models featured the T-tail of the Model 200 mated to the fuselage and wings of the E90, with PT6A-135 engines of 750 shp (560 kW) driving four-bladed propellers. The F90 prototype flew on January 16, 1978, and 203 production versions followed between 1979 and 1983, when the F90 was superseded by the F90-1. The F90 prototype was re-engined with Garrett AiResearch TPE-331 engines to test the feasibility of a Model G90, but this model was not put into production.

The Model C90-1 entered production in 1982 after 507 C90s and 347 E90s had been built, and featured PT6A-21 engines and improvements to the pressurization system. 54 were built. The following year the F90-1 was put into production with redesigned engine cowlings, upgraded PT6A-135A engines, hydraulic landing gear, and triple-fed electrical bus; only 33 were built by the time production terminated in 1985. The C90-1 was soon followed by the Model C90A, which featured the redesigned engine cowlings of the F90-1. The C90A received an increase in MTOW in 1987, being certified to 10,100 lb (4,580 kg). The C90A model was in production until 1992, by which time 235 had been built, all but 74 with the increased MTOW.

Only two C90As were built in 1992, the Model C90B followed that year with airframe improvements, four-bladed propellers, and propeller synchrophasing, all in an effort to reduce cabin noise. This model also had PT6A-21s; the first production C90B was fitted with the 10,000th PT6 engine delivered to Beechcraft. In 1994 a cheaper version was introduced as the C90SE (Special Edition), with three-bladed propellers, standardised interior and mechanical instruments instead of the Electronic Flight Instrument System (EFIS) fitted to the C90B. A total of 456 C90Bs and C90SEs were delivered by the time production of these models ended in late 2005.

In July 2005, during the Oshkosh Airshow, Beechcraft introduced the C90GT. The C90GT was fitted with PT6A-135As, flat rated to the same as the earlier King Airs. This engine change increased performance due to lower operating temperatures, improving both cruise speed and climb rate. With a 275 kt (509 km/h, 316 mph) cruise speed, the C90GT was highly competitive with the new generation of Very Light Jets over short to medium distances, while providing a larger and more luxurious cabin. C90GT deliveries commenced at the beginning of 2006. On May 21, 2007, during the 7th Annual European Business Aviation Convention &amp; Exhibition in Geneva, Beechcraft announced the Model C90GTi updated version of the C90GT, featuring the Rockwell Collins Proline 21 avionics package previously only offered for the B200 and B300 King Airs. Deliveries commenced in 2008 after 97 C90GTs were delivered to customers over the previous two years. In 2015, the C90GTx was introduced with additional upgrades. In 2019, the C90 unit cost was US$2.75M, and $4.2M (~$ in ) for the C90GTi.

In March 2021, Beechcraft discontinued the C90GTx, thus ending the Model 90 production run. Textron, Beechcraft&#x27;s parent company, stated that it intends to support the existing 90 series fleet indefinitely given the large number of aircraft being actively operated.

On 2 July 2024, SmartSky announced the issuance of an FAA Supplemental Type Certificate for their SmartSky LITE inflight WiFi system on the King Air 350i aircraft. This certificate allows for the installation of the WiFi system across various King Air models, encompassing over 2,000 aircraft currently in operation.

===Model 100 series===
The Model 100 is a stretched derivative of the Model 90 featuring five cabin windows instead of the Model 90&#x27;s three; MTOW increased by 1,300 lb (590 kg) over the 90, to 10,600 lb (4,810 kg). The 100 used the wings, tail, and engines (two PT6A-28 engines, although rated at 680 shp) from the Model 99 airliner, itself a development of the Queen Air (as was the Model 90).

The Model 100 was flown for the first time on March 17, 1969, and unveiled to the public in May. A total of 89 Model 100s were built before it was superseded by the Model A100 in 1972, with a further increase in MTOW to 11,500 lb (5,220 kg), fuel capacity increased by , and four-bladed propellers. A total of 157 A100s were built by the time production of this model ceased in 1979. The next in the series was the B100, which featured Garrett AiResearch TPE-331 engines as an alternative to the Pratt &amp; Whitneys offered on other King Airs, and another increase in MTOW to 11,800 lb (5,350 kg). The B100 was introduced in 1976 and was produced concurrently with the A100 for several years; manufacture ceased in 1983 after 137 were built. The Model 200 Super King Air was developed from the Model 100, with the same fuselage design being used for both models (with some differences, mainly associated with the different tails). The Model 200 had different wings and a T-tail and entered service in 1974.

===Military King Air versions===
====Japan====
The Japan Maritime Self-Defense Force (JMSDF) has operated a total of 40 C90 and C90A King Airs, with deliveries beginning in 1973. These have been given various designations by the JMSDF and consist of 34 TC-90 trainers, five LC-90 transports, and a single UC-90 which is configured for photographic aerial survey. The TC-90s and the UC-90 are operated by the 202nd Naval Air Training Squadron (JMSDF) based at Tokushima Air Base, while the LC-90s are attached to various Lockheed P-3 &quot;Kokutai&quot; (Squadrons) and Air Transport Squadron 61 as liaison aircraft. In late 2005, the JMSDF marked 500,000 accident-free flying hours of the TC-90 trainer fleet. Philippine maintenance staff will also be trained.

The JMSDF made plans to lease at least five TC-90 aircraft to the Philippines to conduct maritime patrols. Two aircraft were transferred free of charge in March 2017. From November 2016 to November 2017, six Philippine Navy pilots were trained to fly the aircraft at Tokushima Airport. Maintenance staff are also being trained. There are plans to transfer three more aircraft.

====United States====
The U.S. military has used King Air 90s in various roles, primarily VIP and liaison transport, with designations including the VC-6A, the T-44 Pegasus, and the U-21 Ute. The U-21 Ute used by the US Army was the most common version.

Most U-21s were unpressurized Model 87 derivatives, but there were also five U-21Fs based on the A100 King Air; and three U-21Js, which Beechcraft designated Model A100-1, but were actually the first three production Model 200 Super King Airs (C/Ns BB-3, BB-4 and BB-5, after prototypes C/N BB-1 and BB-2 had been built). The majority of U-21s were delivered as U-21As (102 65-A90-1s), but there were also four RU-21As (65-A90-1s), three RU-21Bs (65-A90-2s), two RU-21Cs (65-A90-3s), 18 RU-21Ds (65-A90-1s), 16 RU-21Es (65-A90-4s), and 17 RU-21Gs (65-A90-1s). The RU-21Es (except one written off) were later converted to U-21Hs and RU-21Hs, with two U-21Hs and an RU-21H being further converted to JU-21Hs. In 1993, the three surviving RU-21As that remained in military service were retired and sent to JW Duff Aircraft Salvage in Denver. On November 14, 2015, one of aircraft, (67-18113) was donated by Dynamic Aviation to the 138th Aviation Company Memorial to restore the aircraft to be displayed at Orlando International Airport. The majority of the U-21 series were retired in the second half of the 1990s and most are now owned by Dynamic Aviation of Bridgewater, Virginia. Some have been modified as spraying aircraft and are used on insect control work.

The T-44A Pegasus is a trainer version, designated the Model H90 by Beechcraft, used to train United States Navy, Marine Corps, Coast Guard, and Air Force (USAF) pilots to fly multi-engine aircraft. A total of 61 were delivered to the US Navy between 1977 and 1980. In August 2006, the Navy announced that after 29 years of operation, the T-44A fleet would be upgraded with modernized avionics systems, and redesignated T-44Cs.

Two VC-6A aircraft were operated by the US military. One was a Model 65-A90 operated by the US Army and serialled 66-15361, the other a B90, designated as a VC-6A (66-7943), was operated by the USAF and used by President Lyndon Johnson.

=====Air Force One=====
During the administration of Lyndon Johnson, the USAF acquired a commercial off-the-shelf Model B90 King Air. With the military designation VC-6A, the aircraft, serialled 66-7943, was used to transport President Johnson between Bergstrom Air Force Base (near Austin) and the Johnson family ranch near Johnson City, Texas. When Johnson was aboard, the aircraft used the callsign Air Force One. After Johnson left office, the aircraft continued to serve in the 89th Military Airlift Wing as a VIP transport until its retirement in 1985. This aircraft is now on display, with other presidential aircraft, at the National Museum of the United States Air Force at Wright Patterson Air Force Base near Dayton.

===Modification and upgrade programs===
A number of aftermarket modifications and upgrades are available for 90 and 100 Series King Airs. An engine upgrade involves earlier-build 90 Series aircraft being re-engined with the PT6A-135A engines of the C90GT. A more radical re-engining program involves the replacement of the PT6s in C90 and E90 King Airs with TPE-331s.
Among the numerous airframe modifications available: a cargo conversion for the 90 model, the CargoLiner, which replaces the rear door with a large pallet accessible cargo door, a heavy duty floor structure and cabin cargo liner, also a crew hatch for cockpit access for the crew in the 90, 100, and 200; a Wing Front Spar Reinforcement Kit for both 90 and 100 Series aircraft, a modification for the entire King Air line that entails reworking and extending the nose to house a baggage compartment as well as the avionics normally found in the noses of King Air aircraft. Modifications available for the King Air 100 include a belly cargo pod similar to those fitted to the Beech 99 and the Model 1300 version of the King Air 200 series.

==Operators==
In addition to its use by military and government users, the King Air is also used by many non-governmental organizations, as well as by corporate and private users. This includes commercial use by air-taxi and air charter companies.

The Royal Flying Doctor Service of Australia previously operated a large number of 90 Series King Airs, but retired the last example in 2006, standardizing on the King Air 200 Series and the Pilatus PC-12 for its fleet requirements.

==Accidents and incidents==
* On November 19, 1996, a Beechcraft King Air collided on a runway with a United Express 1900C at Quincy Regional Airport in Illinois, killing all 14 people on board both aircraft.
* On October 25, 2002, a Beechcraft A100 King Air crashed in Minnesota, killing U.S. Senator Paul Wellstone and 7 others.
* On January 19, 2017, a Beechcraft C90GT King Air crashed in Paraty, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, killing Teori Zavascki, the Minister of the Supreme Court of Brazil and 4 other people.
* On June 28, 2018, a Beechcraft King Air C90 crashed in a suburb of Mumbai, India, killing all four aboard and one on the ground; three people sustained injuries.
* On November 5, 2021, a Beechcraft C90A King Air crashed in Caratinga, Minas Gerais, Brazil, killing 3 passengers and 2 crew members, including Brazilian singer Marília Mendonça.
* On February 7, 2025, a Beechcraft F90 King Air crashed in São Paulo, São Paulo State, Brazil, killing the owner and the pilot.

<text>Gustaf Gründgens (; 22 December 1899 – 7 October 1963), born Gustav Heinrich Arnold Gründgens, was one of Germany&#x27;s most famous and influential actors of the 20th century, and artistic director of theatres in Berlin, Düsseldorf, and Hamburg. His career continued unimpeded through the years of the Nazi regime; the extent to which this can be considered as deliberate collaboration with the Nazis is hotly disputed.

His best-known roles were that of Mephistopheles in Goethe&#x27;s &quot;Faust&quot; in 1960, and as &quot;Der Schränker&quot; (The Safecracker) who is the chief judge of the kangaroo court presiding over Hans Beckert (Peter Lorre) in Fritz Lang&#x27;s &quot;M&quot;.

==Early life==
Born in Düsseldorf, Gründgens attended the drama school of the Düsseldorfer Schauspielhaus after World War I and started his career at smaller theaters in Halberstadt, Kiel, and Berlin.

==Career==
In 1923, he joined the &quot;Kammerspiele&quot; in Hamburg, where he changed his first name to Gustaf and appeared as a director for the first time. In 1925, Gründgens wrote to Klaus Mann to propose a Hamburg production of Mann’s play &quot;Anja and Esther&quot;. Mann agreed, and &quot;Anja and Esther&quot; was performed in Hamburg with Gründgens directing and playing the role of Jakob. Mann played the role of Kaspar, while his sister Erika and his fiancée Pamela Wedekind played the lead roles of Anja and Esther. The play marked the beginning of Gründgens’ collaborations with the Mann siblings and Wedekind, as well as the beginning of his romantic relationship with Klaus Mann.

In 1928, he moved back to Berlin to join the renowned ensemble of the Deutsches Theater under the director Max Reinhardt. Apart from spoken theatre, Gründgens also worked with Otto Klemperer at the Kroll Opera, as a cabaret artist and as a screen actor, most notably in Fritz Lang&#x27;s 1931 film &quot;M&quot;, which significantly increased his popularity. From 1932 he was a member of the Prussian State Theatre ensemble, in which he first stood out in the role of Mephistopheles.

Gründgens&#x27; career continued after the Nazi party came to power. In October 1934, he became the &quot;Intendant&quot;, or artistic director, of the Prussian State Theatre and, on 6 May 1936, Prussian Minister President Hermann Göring appointed him to the recently reconstituted Prussian State Council. He also became a member of the Presidential Council of the &quot;Reichstheaterkammer&quot; (Theatre Chamber of the Reich), which was an institution of the &quot;Reichskulturkammer&quot; (Reich Chamber of Culture). In 1941, Gründgens starred (against his will and unpaid) in the propaganda film &quot;Ohm Krüger&quot;; he also played the title role in the fictional biographical film &quot;Friedemann Bach&quot;, which he also produced.

After Goebbels&#x27;s total war speech on 18 February 1943, Gründgens volunteered for the Wehrmacht but was again recalled by Göring, who had his name added to the Gottbegnadeten list (Important Artist Exempt List).

==Post-war life==
Imprisoned by the Soviet NKVD for 9 months in 1945 – 1946, Gründgens was released due to the intercession of the Communist actor Ernst Busch, whom Gründgens himself had saved from execution by the Nazis in 1943. During the denazification process, his statements helped to exonerate acting colleagues, including Göring’s widow, Emmy, and Veit Harlan, director of the film &quot;Jud Süß&quot;.

Gründgens returned to the Deutsches Theater, later became &quot;Intendant&quot; of the Düsseldorfer Schauspielhaus, and from 1955 directed the Deutsches Schauspielhaus in Hamburg. He again performed as Mephistopheles; the 1960 film &quot;Faust&quot; by Peter Gorski was made with the Deutsches Schauspielhaus ensemble.

==Personal life==
Gründgens became romantically involved with Klaus Mann while the two of them were performing in the Hamburg production of Mann’s play &quot;Anja and Esther&quot;. In 1926, while in a relationship with Klaus, Gründgens married Erika Mann, who was herself in a relationship with Klaus’s fiancée Pamela Wedekind. By 1927, Erika and Gründgens were separated. They officially divorced in 1929, around the time that Gründgens’s relationship with Klaus ended. Gründgens eventually became the basis of several characters in Klaus Mann’s fiction, including the character of Gregor Gregori in &quot;Treffpunkt im Unendlichen&quot; and the character of Hendrik Höfgen in the infamous novel &quot;Mephisto&quot;.

From 1936 to 1946, Gründgens was married to the famous German actress Marianne Hoppe. He had a son with her, Benedikt Johann Percy Gründgens, born in 1946. Despite these lavender marriages, Gründgens was widely known as homosexual. While other homosexuals were persecuted and sent to concentration camps during the Third Reich, Gründgens was tolerated by the Nazi elites because of his high reputation as an actor.

==Death==

On 7 October 1963, while traveling around the world, Gründgens died in Manila of an internal hemorrhage. It has never been ascertained whether or not he committed suicide by an overdose of sleeping pills. His last words, written on an envelope, were, &quot;I believe that I took too many sleeping pills. I feel a little strange. Let me sleep long.&quot; He is buried at the Ohlsdorf Cemetery in Hamburg.

==&quot;Mephisto&quot; judgment==
Posthumously, Gründgens was involved in one of the more famous literary cases in 20th-century Germany as the subject of the novel &quot;Mephisto&quot; by his former lover Klaus Mann, who had died in 1949. The novel, a thinly veiled account of Gründgens&#x27;s life, portrayed its main character Hendrik Höfgen as having shady connections with the Nazi regime. Gründgens&#x27; adopted son and heir Peter Gorski, who had directed &quot;Faust&quot;, successfully sued the publisher on his late father&#x27;s behalf in 1966. The judgment was upheld by the Federal Court of Justice in 1968.

In the time-consuming lawsuit, the controversy over libel and the freedom of fiction from censorship was finally decided by the Federal Constitutional Court in 1971. It ruled that Gründgens&#x27; post-mortem personality rights prevailed and upheld the prohibition imposed on the publisher. However, the novel met with no further protests when it was published again in 1981 by Rowohlt.

In 1981, the novel was made into the film &quot;Mephisto&quot;, directed by István Szabó, with Klaus Maria Brandauer in the role of Hendrik Höfgen. The film was a huge commercial and critical success, and won the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film in 1981.

<text>A mobile virtual network operator (MVNO) is a wireless communications services provider that does not own the wireless network infrastructure over which it provides services to its customers. An MVNO enters into a business agreement with a mobile network operator (MNO) to obtain bulk access to network services at wholesale rates, then sets retail prices independently. An MVNO may use its own customer service, billing support systems, marketing, and sales personnel, or it could employ the services of a mobile virtual network enabler (MVNE).

==History==
MVNO agreements with network operators date back to the 1990s, when the European and Australian telecom markets saw market liberalization, new regulatory frameworks, better 2G network technology, and a subsequent jump in wireless subscriber numbers. Though the new 2G networks more efficiently managed the limited frequency bands allocated to wireless service, new mobile entrants were still limited by their ability to access frequency bands in a restricted spectrum.

In 1997 Vodafone Australia and TotalTel launched FastFone, the world&#x27;s first true prepaid MVNO utilising the worlds first fully MNO integrated MVNE platform supplied by Isoton (formerly Steadycom). FastFone&#x27;s MVNO model was very successful, attracting more than 300,000 subscribers in 18 months. Vodafone purchased the business in 1999.

With European markets newly open to competition and new technology enabling better service and cheaper handsets, there was a massive surge in demand for cellular phones. In the midst of this swell, Sense Communications fought for access to MNO spectrum in Scandinavia in 1997. Sense was able to establish an MVNO agreement with Sonera in Finland, but it failed to persuade MNOs in Sweden, Denmark, and Norway. Sense then appealed to EU regulators, citing provisions that required certain MNOs to allow new entrants interconnection. While Sense&#x27;s claim was denied, in November 1999, the company signed a service provider agreement with Telia/Telenor Mobile for GSM network capacity access, allowing Sense to offer services to its own customers in Sweden and Norway.

Despite Sense&#x27;s initial failure, the regulator in Denmark saw the promise in the MVNO model as a cost-effective route for telecom companies to enter the market and in May 2000, legislation passed that required network operators with significant market power to open up access to their infrastructure. By August of that same year, the MNO SONOFON had solidified the first viable MVNO agreement with Tele2. This agreement provided Tele2 with access to SONOFON&#x27;s network for both mobile and roaming services, the latter of which had been requested by (and denied to) Sense Communications. With the new regulations in place, MVNOs in Scandinavia eventually grew to a market share of above 10%.

By 2008, US wireless subscribers had a choice between around 40 MVNOs. According to the FCC, approximately 7% of all U.S. mobile subscribers were served by resellers, including MVNOs, and analysts found that the 15.1 million wireless subscribers served by resellers by the end of 2006 had increased by 1.6 million over the previous year.

==Types==
MVNOs are distinguished by their commitment to owning and managing the operational components of the MVNO business model, consisting of: 
* Access to basic network infrastructure, like base stations, transceivers, home location registers, and switching centres. 
* Service packaging, pricing, and billing systems, including value-added services like voicemail and missed call notifications.
* Consumer-facing aspects like sales, marketing, and customer relationship management activities like customer care and dispute resolution.

Because MVNOs are effectively defined by their lack of spectrum licenses, an MVNO necessarily will need to have agreements in place to access the network of at least one MNO. The type of MVNO is determined by how &quot;thick&quot; or &quot;thin&quot; a technological layer an MVNO adds over its access to its host MNO&#x27;s network.

=== Branded reseller ===
Sometimes referred to as a &quot;Skinny MVNO&quot; or Reseller. A Branded Reseller, will either operate under its own brand or co-branded with the mobile network operator (MNO). In most cases, the branded reseller brings a brand, distribution channels and/or a large existing customer base to the table, from which it can leverage its sales. It is often the easiest MVNO type for a host network operator (HNO) to accept, as the HNO stays in control over most of the processes. The Reseller MVNO, possesses no core elements and only holds the means that ensure the contact and relationship with the customers.

=== Thin MVNO ===
Sometimes referred to as a &quot;Light MVNO&quot; or &quot;Service provider MVNO&quot;. The Thin MVNO, provides its own brand and is normally responsible for the customer support, billing processes, tariffs, bundles and promotion packages, costs of marketing, sales and distribution, as well as the OPEX and CAPEX associated with these.

=== Medium MVNO ===
Sometimes referred to as a &quot;Enhanced Service Provider&quot;. The Medium MVNO, operates under its own brand with its own SIM cards, marketing, sales, distribution, and can in some countries obtain its own numbering range/mobile network code. The Medium MVNO has the ability to set tariff bundles and packages independently from the retail prices set by the host network operator (MNO). It can add its own value added services (VAS) platform to upsell or differentiate from the competition, on apps, data, and content services.

=== Full MVNO ===
The Full MVNO is responsible for, and has full control over all the services and products it offers in the market, as well as flexibility in designing and deploying new services, either to end-users or for Internet of Things (IoT) / Machine-to-machine (M2M). It operates technically, in a similar way to a mobile network operator, but without spectrum and radio access network (RAN), which it still leases access to from a mobile network operator (MNO).

The Full MVNO has a switching and transmission infrastructure allowing the management of its traffic. It can administer numbering resources, customer service, VAS, Roaming, SIM and device management and other services required for the provision of mobile services.

==Around the world==
As of June 2014, 943 MVNOs and 255 MNO sub-brands were active worldwide. This represents a total of almost 1,200 mobile service providers worldwide hosted by MNOs, up from 1,036 in 2012,

According to GSMA Intelligence, between June 2010 and June 2015, the number of MVNOs worldwide increased by 70 percent, reaching 1,017 in June 2015.

As of December 2018, there were 1,300 active MVNOs operating in 80 countries, representing more than 220 million mobile connections—approximately 2.46% of the total 8.9 billion mobile connections in the world. The eight countries with the largest number of active MVNOs in 2018 were: the US with 139 MVNOs (4.7% market share), Germany with 135 (19.5% market share), Japan 83 (10.6%), UK 77 (15.9%), Australia 66 (13.1%), Spain 63 (11.5%), France 53 (11.2%) and Denmark 49 (34.6%).

In addition to traditional cellular voice and messaging services, in 2014, 120 MVNOs also were offering mobile broadband services. In Africa, Uganda has registered three MVNOs so far, some having their own network infrastructure within major cities, but acting as an MVNO out of these cities.

In 2015, one of the &quot;big five&quot; banks in South Africa, FNB, created an MVNO named FNB Connect providing voice, SMS and data services. As of 31 December 2019, FNB Connect had around 670,000 subscribers. The service makes use of Cell C network infrastructure. The move came not necessarily to compete in the telecommunications market, but to offer a greater value to customers of the banking division. There have been several banks in South Africa making this move, like Standard Bank&#x27;s SB Mobile established in 2019.

MVNOs target both the consumer and enterprise markets. The majority of MVNOs are consumer-focused and most have a focus on price as their selling point; on average, customers of major carriers spend about 3.4 times as much on their service as MVNO customers.

At the end of year 2022, there were 1,986 active MVNOs globally, more than double the amount of traditional telecom network operators. Europe lead in terms of most active MVNOs in operation with 1,012, representing half of the total global MVNO market. It is followed by Americas with 379 MVNOs, Asia with 322, International with 131, Oceania with 84, Africa with 54 and Middle East with 5.

=== Multinational MVNOs ===
Some MVNOs have a presence in multiple countries, either as subsidiaries, joint ventures, or through brand licensing agreements with local partners, including Lycamobile in 60 countries, Virgin Mobile in 14 countries, Lebara in 10 countries, CMLink in five countries, Tesco Mobile in four countries, Line Mobile in three countries, Aldi Talk in six countries, Kogan.com Mobile in two countries, and L-Mobi Mobile in two countries.

===Japan===
Japan has about 80 MVNO brands, and the market share of MVNOs is 12.2% in 2019. The total number of contractors is 22.3 million.

===United States===

The three US national carriers have partial or full ownership of several large MVNO brands, such as Cricket Wireless (AT&amp;T), TracFone Wireless (Verizon) and Metro by T-Mobile (T-Mobile).

===United Kingdom===
The UK had 77 active MVNOs as of December 2018. The MVNOs combined market share was 15.9% of the total UK mobile market, representing 15.3 million connections.

=== Ireland ===
Ireland has seven active MVNO brands as of February 2021, and the market share of MVNOs in 2022 is 13.4%.

=== Vietnam ===
As of May 2024, Vietnam had five MVNO providers using the networks of the two mobile network operators VinaPhone and MobiFone. The five MVNOs are: iTel, Wintel, myLocal, VNSKY and FPT SIM.

==Regulation==
In 2003, the European Commission issued a recommendation to national telecom regulators to examine the competitiveness of the market for wholesale access and call origination on public mobile telephone networks. The study resulted in new regulations from regulators in several countries, including Ireland and France forcing operators to open up their networks to MVNOs.

Jordan&#x27;s top watchdog issued its first MVNO regulations in 2008, facilitating the creation of the first MVNO in the Arab world in 2010.

The Saudi government is making preparations to permit MVNO services in the country.

In Brazil, MVNOs are regulated by Anatel, the Brazilian Agency of Telecommunications, in November 2010. As of September 2014 the combined market share of all Brazilian MVNOs was just 0.04%.

In Thailand, five MVNOs were given a Type II license to operate on the 2100 MHz 3G network of state telecom service TOT Public Company Limited (TOT) in 2009. As of January 2017, two of the original five MVNOs are still in service. As of December 2018, the National Broadcasting and Telecommunications Commission (NBTC) had issued 58 MVNO licenses in Thailand, a total of nine have launched, four remain active.

In India, the Telecom Department under the Ministry of Communications and Information Technology, accepted a recommendation from the national telecom regulator, Telecom Regulatory Authority of India, to permit VNOs in the country, and announced the grant of a unified license for Virtual Network Operators on 31 May 2016. VNOs have formed an association to represent current regulatory issues impacting their MVNO business viability.

In Nigeria, the licensing of telecommunications operators is overseen by the Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC). As part of its regulatory framework, the NCC reclassified telecommunications licences into class and individual licences. This regulatory structure ensures that all telecom service providers, including MVNOs, comply with national guidelines and operate within the appropriate legal framework for their respective services.

<text>Richard José Hidalgo (born June 28, 1975) is a former professional outfielder. He played with the Houston Astros (1997–2004), New York Mets (2004), and the Texas Rangers (2005) of Major League Baseball (MLB). He batted and threw right-handed.

==Career==
Hidalgo was signed as a 16-year-old by the Houston Astros from its Venezuela academy.

After hitting .306 and .303 in his first two seasons, his numbers came down with a .227 average, although he showed some power with 15 home runs in 383 at-bats. He required season-ending surgery to treat a congenital knee condition.

Hidalgo blossomed in 2000, when he hit .314 with 44 home runs and 122 RBIs. That season Hidalgo set the Astros&#x27; extra-base hit streak record, matched in 2017 by Alex Bregman, at 10 games. In September 2000 Hidalgo set an Astros record of .476 average that was surpassed by Jose Altuve in 2018. He signed a 4-year $32 million contract after that season.

On November 22, 2002, Hidalgo was shot in the left forearm during a carjacking in Venezuela. In 2003, he returned to good form both at the plate and in the field. He posted numbers of .309, 28, 88, collected three homers in a game, and led the majors outfielders in assists with 22, while committing only four errors. 

Despite being named National League player of the month for April 2004, Hidalgo struggled at the plate and was benched by manager, Jimy Williams, by May. The Astros then traded him to the New York Mets for David Weathers and Jeremy Griffiths. He set a Mets record by homering in 5 consecutive games. Hidalgo hit .239 with 25 homers and 82 RBIs for the season.

Hidalgo, a free agent, signed with the Texas Rangers for the 2005 season.

In 2006, he signed a minor league contract with the Baltimore Orioles, but left the team before the season started, when his wife became ill. Hidalgo requested to be released from his contract, allowing to him to go to Japan where he would have a starting role. In the 2006 off-season, the Boston Red Sox and Chicago Cubs reportedly showed interest in signing Hidalgo.

In January 2007, the Astros signed him again, this time to a minor league contract. This second tenure was short-lived, as Hidalgo was released by the Astros on March 25, 2007, after refusing a minor league assignment.

Hidalgo was a Major League .269 lifetime hitter with 171 home runs and 560 RBIs in 987 games. Defensively, he recorded a .987 fielding percentage playing at all three outfield positions.

On April 10, 2007, Hidalgo joined the Long Island Ducks. Before spring training, however, he announced his retirement from professional baseball. On July 8, 2008, Hidalgo signed with the Ducks again but left the team during the last week of August.

In early 2008, Hidalgo&#x27;s attempt to create a so-called &quot;field of dreams&quot; on his Florida property was voted down by residents of his neighborhood. Hidalgo has three sons who live with his wife in Florida.

<text>Resistance Records was a Canadian record label owned by Resistance LLC which was closely connected to the organization National Alliance. It produced and sold music by neo-Nazi and white separatist musicians, primarily through its website. Advertising itself as &quot;The Soundtrack for White Revolution&quot;, Resistance LLC also published a magazine called &quot;Resistance&quot;, with Erich Gliebe becoming the editor in 1999. The label is listed as a hate group by the Southern Poverty Law Center. As of 2011, the label was headquartered in Lufkin, Texas, US.

==History==
The label was founded in Windsor, Ontario in December 1993 by white supremacist George Burdi. George Burdi went by the name &quot;George Eric Hawthorne&quot; at that time. In January 1994, this music label was also incorporated in Detroit, Michigan. With the launch of a new music label came the new magazine &quot;Resistance&quot;. The magazine boasted a circulation of over 13,000 in 1995. This magazine is still published and distributed by the National Alliance. 
Among the acts signed to Resistance was Burdi&#x27;s own RAHOWA (short for &quot;Racial Holy War&quot;), which disbanded after Burdi renounced neo-Nazism.

Burdi was involved in a white supremacist street march in May 1993, during which he kicked a female anti-racist protester in the face. Burdi was charged for assault causing bodily harm in 1995, and given a 12-month sentence. He was arrested after losing appeals and served time for the assault in 1997. Burdi&#x27;s Canadian business partners, Jason Snow and Joe Talic, had taken control and ownership of Resistance in 1996. American manager Mark Wilson was later replaced by Eric Davidson, former editor of the North American edition of the UK network Blood &amp; Honour, who had relocated from California to Michigan in January 1997.

In April 1997, Resistance Records was temporarily put out of business by a tax dispute and a prosecution for distributing materials that promoted hatred in Canada. The inventory was in the United States at that time, at a rented house in Milford, Michigan where the operations were run. The Federal Marshals, under the direction of the Internal Revenue Service, seized the company records and the entire inventory. Eventually a small fine was paid for failure to properly pay state sales tax, and the business records and inventory was returned. The label never again operated in Canada because of violations of Canadian hate speech laws. After his 1997 sentence, George Burdi renounced racism and formed an ethnically diverse band, Novacosm.

In 1998, Resistance Records was sold by its Canadian owners to Willis Carto and was incorporated in Washington, D.C., with Carto&#x27;s agent Todd Blodgett in charge of operations. Eric Davidson gave notice after the sale and would later relocate to Minnesota to help found Panzerfaust Records. For a brief time, Resistance Records operated from California. Blodgett and William Luther Pierce, head of the National Alliance had bought partial ownership. In 1999, Carto and Blodgett later sold their shares of the company to Pierce. Pierce fired Blodgett and moved the entire operation to his property in Hillsboro, West Virginia. Also in 1999, Resistance Records bought Swedish white power label Nordland Records, doubling its roster. 
In 2000, it was made into an LLC in West Virginia.

==Subsidiaries==
Resistance Records owns several smaller labels, most notably black metal labels Cymophane Records (also known as Cymophane Productions) and Unholy Records. It is a front for Cymophane Records, which was purchased by the National Alliance, mainly to gain the rights to distribute Burzum albums in the United States. The label has also released albums by Nocturnal Fear and Nachtmystium, which are not National Socialist black metal (NSBM) bands. The label is managed by Ymir G. Winter, who plays guitar in Grom, a New York-based NSBM band.

At one time, Resistance Records operated a web-based radio station, Resistance Radio, which streamed white power music across the Internet 24 hours a day.

==Merchandise==
Resistance Records maintained an online store that sold over 1,000 CDs, as well as clothes, flags and two computer games they developed, &quot;Ethnic Cleansing&quot; and &quot;White Law&quot;, which were only available for purchase from their website.

In &quot;Ethnic Cleansing&quot;, the player can choose to play as either a Nazi skinhead or a Klansman who runs through a ghetto killing Africans and mestizos, before descending into a subway system to murder Jews. Eventually the player reaches a &quot;Jewish Control Center&quot;, where Ariel Sharon, the former prime minister of Israel, is directing plans for Jewish world domination. The player must kill Sharon to win the game. The game has several music tracks to choose from, and there is a small video loop of William Luther Pierce&#x27;s speech displayed in the game. The game was largely ignored by the gaming community and the specialized press.

In the sequel, &quot;White Law&quot;, the player is an ex-police officer, dismissed because of his political views. The player runs through several buildings, killing people such as police officers, a child pornographer and journalists. The player must kill the police chief to win the game.

<doc id="729163" wikidata="Q5336424" url="?curid=729163" title="Eddie Pérez (baseball)">
<text>Eduardo Rafael Pérez (born May 4, 1968) is a Venezuelan-American former professional baseball catcher. Since 2007, he has served as a coach for the Atlanta Braves. He played in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the Braves, Cleveland Indians, and Milwaukee Brewers. During his tenure with the Braves, Pérez was notable for being the personal catcher for Baseball Hall of Fame pitcher Greg Maddux and for being named the Most Valuable Player of the 1999 National League Championship Series.

==Baseball playing career==
Born in Ciudad Ojeda, Venezuela, Pérez was signed by the Atlanta Braves as an amateur free agent in 1986. He spent eight seasons in the Braves&#x27; minor league system, eventually progressing to their Triple-A affiliate, the Richmond Braves. In , he was named the Most Valuable Player of the Venezuelan Winter League. He posted a .265 batting average with 19 doubles and 40 runs batted in with Richmond in , earning a late season call up to Atlanta. Pérez made his major league debut with the Braves at the age of 27 on September 10, 1995. In his first game as a starting player on September 15, he hit a home run for his first major league hit. Pérez made the post-season roster, but didn&#x27;t get to play as the Braves went on to win the 1995 World Series.

Pérez served as the Braves&#x27; back up catcher behind Javy López, but by June 1996, he had taken on the role of personal catcher for Greg Maddux, a job previously held by Charlie O&#x27;Brien who had been granted free agency during the off-season. The Braves went on to win the National League pennant before losing to the New York Yankees in the 1996 World Series.

On September 17, 1997, Pérez hit a grand slam home run against the San Francisco Giants, enabling the Braves to tie a major league team record with 11 grand slams in one season. With Pérez as his catcher, Maddux ended the year with a 2.20 earned run average, second best in the National League, as the Braves once again clinched the National League East Division crown. The Braves swept the Houston Astros in three games in the 1997 National League Division Series before losing to the eventual world champion Florida Marlins in the 1997 National League Championship Series.

Pérez had his best year in 1998 when he posted a .336 batting average along with a .404 on-base percentage in 61 games. He committed only 1 error in 305 total chances for a .997 fielding percentage. His working relationship with Maddux continued to improve with Maddux leading the National League with 5 shutouts, and a 2.22 earned run average. The Braves once again claimed the National League East Division crown and defeated the Chicago Cubs in three games in the 1998 National League Division Series. Pérez hit an eighth-inning grand slam home run in the decisive Game 3 of the series. However, the Braves&#x27; season ended when they lost to the San Diego Padres in the 1998 National League Championship Series.

In 1999, Pérez was thrust into a starting role when Javy López suffered an injury to a ligament in his right knee in late July and was lost for the season. He stepped in with a .249 batting average along with 7 home runs, 30 runs batted in, and finished fourth in the league in fielding percentage and in range factor. The Braves won their fifth consecutive National League East Division title and then defeated the Houston Astros in four games in the 1999 National League Division Series.

In the 1999 National League Championship Series against the New York Mets, Pérez, normally known for his defensive skills, became an offensive standout. He hit a home run in Game 1 to help the Braves win 4–2. He followed with a two-run, sixth-inning home run in Game 2 that broke a 2–2 tie. Pérez contributed a two-run single in the deciding Game 6 as the Braves won 10–9 in 11 innings. He totaled 10 hits in 20 at bats for a .500 batting average along with 2 home runs and 5 runs batted in to earn him the League Championship Series Most Valuable Player Award. After an emotionally draining National League Championship series, the Braves were swept by the New York Yankees in four games in the 1999 World Series.

In May 2000, Pérez suffered a torn rotator cuff and missed the entire season. He re-injured the same shoulder in March of 2001 and only appeared in 5 games that season. In March 2002, Pérez was traded to the Cleveland Indians who were in need of a backup catcher. Pérez became expendable after the Braves acquired catcher Henry Blanco.

Pérez spent the 2002 season as backup to Einar Diaz and was granted free agency at the end of the year. In January 2003, he signed a contract to play for the Milwaukee Brewers. Pérez was in a platoon system alongside Keith Osik in which he started three out of every five games. He was hitting for a .315 batting average by mid-season, but tapered off to finish the season with a .271 average along with career-highs in home runs (11) and runs batted in (45).

In December 2003, Pérez signed a contract to return to play for the Braves. He served as a backup catcher to Johnny Estrada in 2004 and 2005. On May 18, 2004, he was the last out of Randy Johnson&#x27;s perfect game, being called upon to pinch-hit for pitcher Mike Hampton because of excellent career numbers against Johnson (6 hits in 13 at-bats). Nonetheless, he struck out to end the perfect game. He suffered tendinitis in his right shoulder during the 2005 season and was placed on the disabled list for most of the season. While on the disabled list, Perez&#x27;s duties as catcher were taken over by Brian McCann who eventually took over as the Braves&#x27; starting catcher. He returned to make one final major league appearance as a pinch hitter on September 27, at the age of 37.

==Career statistics==
In an eleven-year major league career, Pérez played in 564 games, accumulating 386 hits in 1,525 at bats for a .253 career batting average along with 40 home runs, 172 runs batted in and a .297 on-base percentage. He ended his career with a .991 fielding percentage.

==Coaching career==

In , Pérez was a player-coach for the Double-A Mississippi Braves. Atlanta Braves manager Bobby Cox named Pérez as his bullpen coach for the 2007 season. When Fredi Gonzalez was named the Braves manager for the 2011 season, he retained Pérez as his bullpen coach. After the Braves fired Gonzalez he was moved to be the current first base coach for the new manager Brian Snitker.

Pérez was hired as the manager for the Águilas del Zulia of the Venezuelan Winter League for two seasons, 2008-2010. He rejoined the team in the 2014 season. In 2015, Pérez managed the Tigres de Aragua.

==Personal life==
On August 13, 2014, Pérez, his wife, and his daughter became naturalized U.S. citizens. Pérez, who will retain his Venezuelan citizenship, has lived in the Atlanta area since 1994.

His son Andres was drafted in the 36th round of the 2016 Major League Baseball draft. Andres declined the draft offer and attended college instead. He will enter the draft again in 2021.

<doc id="729189" wikidata="Q4660281" url="?curid=729189" title="A Treatise on Electricity and Magnetism">
<text>A Treatise on Electricity and Magnetism is a two-volume treatise on electromagnetism written by James Clerk Maxwell in 1873. Maxwell was revising the &quot;Treatise&quot; for a second edition when he died in 1879. The revision was completed by William Davidson Niven for publication in 1881. A third edition was prepared by J. J. Thomson for publication in 1892.

The treatise is said to be notoriously hard to read, containing plenty of ideas but lacking both the clear focus and orderliness that may have allowed it catch on more easily. It was noted by one historian of science that Maxwell&#x27;s attempt at a comprehensive treatise on all of electrical science tended to bury the important results of his work under &quot;long accounts of miscellaneous phenomena discussed from several points of view.&quot; He goes on to say that, outside the treatment of the Faraday effect, Maxwell failed to expound on his earlier work, especially the generation of electromagnetic waves and the derivation of the laws governing reflection and refraction.

Maxwell introduced the use of vector fields, and his labels have been perpetuated:
: A (vector potential), B (magnetic induction), C (electric current), D (displacement), E (electric field – Maxwell&#x27;s electromotive intensity), F (mechanical force), H (magnetic field – Maxwell&#x27;s magnetic force).

Maxwell&#x27;s work is considered an exemplar of rhetoric of science:
:Lagrange&#x27;s equations appear in the &quot;Treatise&quot; as the culmination of a long series of rhetorical moves, including (among others) Green&#x27;s theorem, Gauss&#x27;s potential theory and Faraday&#x27;s lines of force – all of which have prepared the reader for the Lagrangian vision of a natural world that is whole and connected: a veritable sea change from Newton&#x27;s vision.

==Reception==

=== Reviews ===
On April 24, 1873, Nature announced the publication with an extensive description and much praise. When the second edition was published in 1881, George Chrystal wrote the review for &quot;Nature&quot;.

Pierre Duhem published a critical essay outlining mistakes he found in Maxwell&#x27;s &quot;Treatise&quot;. Duhem&#x27;s book was reviewed in &quot;Nature&quot;.

===Comments===
Hermann von Helmholtz (1881): &quot;Now that the mathematical interpretations of Faraday&#x27;s conceptions regarding the nature of electric and magnetic force has been given by Clerk Maxwell, we see how great a degree of exactness and precision was really hidden behind Faraday&#x27;s words…it is astonishing in the highest to see what a large number of general theories, the mechanical deduction of which requires the highest powers of mathematical analysis, he has found by a kind of intuition, with the security of instinct, without the help of a single mathematical formula.&quot;

Oliver Heaviside (1893):”What is Maxwell&#x27;s theory? The first approximation is to say: There is Maxwell&#x27;s book as he wrote it; there is his text, and there are his equations: together they make his theory. But when we come to examine it closely, we find that this answer is unsatisfactory. To begin with, it is sufficient to refer to papers by physicists, written say during the first twelve years following the first publication of Maxwell&#x27;s treatise to see that there may be much difference of opinion as to what his theory is. It may be, and has been, differently interpreted by different men, which is a sign that is not set forth in a perfectly clear and unmistakable form. There are many obscurities and some inconsistencies. Speaking for myself, it was only by changing its form of presentation that I was able to see it clearly, and so as to avoid the inconsistencies. Now there is no finality in a growing science. It is, therefore, impossible to adhere strictly to Maxwell&#x27;s theory as he gave it to the world, if only on account of its inconvenient form.

Alexander Macfarlane (1902): &quot;This work has served as the starting point of many advances made in recent years. Maxwell is the scientific ancestor of Hertz, Hertz of Marconi and all other workers at wireless telegraphy.

Oliver Lodge (1907) &quot;Then comes Maxwell, with his keen penetration and great grasp of thought, combined with mathematical subtlety and power of expression; he assimilates the facts, sympathizes with the philosophic but untutored modes of expression invented by Faraday, links the theorems of Green and Stokes and Thomson to the facts of Faraday, and from the union rears the young modern science of electricity...&quot;

E. T. Whittaker (1910): &quot;In this celebrated work is comprehended almost every branch of electric and magnetic theory, but the intention of the writer was to discuss the whole from a single point of view, namely, that of Faraday, so that little or no account was given of the hypotheses that had been propounded in the two preceding decades by the great German electricians...The doctrines peculiar to Maxwell ... were not introduced in the first volume, or in the first half of the second.&quot;

Albert Einstein (1931): &quot;Before Maxwell people conceived of physical reality – in so far as it is supposed to represent events in nature – as material points, whose changes consist exclusively of motions, which are subject to total differential equations. After Maxwell they conceived physical reality as represented by continuous fields, not mechanically explicable, which are subject to partial differential equations. This change in the conception of reality is the most profound and fruitful one that has come to physics since Newton; but it has at the same time to be admitted that the program has by no means been completely carried out yet.&quot;

Richard P. Feynman (1964): &quot;From a long view of the history of mankind—seen from, say, ten thousand years from now—there can be little doubt that the most significant event of the 19th century will be judged as Maxwell&#x27;s discovery of the laws of electrodynamics. The American Civil War will pale into provincial insignificance in comparison with this important scientific event of the same decade.&quot;

L. Pearce Williams (1991): &quot;In 1873, James Clerk Maxwell published a rambling and difficult two-volume &quot;Treatise on Electricity and Magnetism&quot; that was destined to change the orthodox picture of physical reality. This treatise did for electromagnetism what Newton&#x27;s &quot;Principia&quot; had done for classical mechanics. It not only provided the mathematical tools for the investigation and representation of the whole of electromagnetic theory, but it altered the very framework of both theoretical and experimental physics. Although the process had been going on throughout the nineteenth century, it was this work that finally displaced action at a distance physics and substituted the physics of the field.&quot;

Mark P. Silverman (1998) &quot;I studied the principles on my own – in this case with Maxwell&#x27;s &quot;Treatise&quot; as both my inspiration and textbook. This is not an experience that I would necessarily recommend to others. For all his legendary gentleness, Maxwell is a demanding teacher, and his magnum opus is anything but coffee-table reading...At the same time, the experience was greatly rewarding in that I had come to understand, as I realized much later, aspects of electromagnetism that are rarely taught at any level today and that reflect the unique physical insight of their creator.

Andrew Warwick (2003): &quot;In developing the mathematical theory of electricity and magnetism in the &quot;Treatise&quot;, Maxwell made a number of errors, and for students with only a tenuous grasp of the physical concepts of basic electromagnetic theory and the specific techniques to solve some problems, it was extremely difficult to discriminate between cases where Maxwell made an error and cases where they simply failed to follow the physical or mathematical reasoning.&quot;

<text>The election of MEPs representing Germany constituency for the 2004–2009 term of the European Parliament was held on 13 June 2004.

The elections saw a heavy defeat for the ruling Social Democratic Party, which polled its lowest share of the vote since World War II. More than half of this loss, however, went to other parties of the left, particularly the Greens. The votes of the opposition conservative parties, the Christian Democratic Union and the Christian Social Union, also fell, though not as sharply as the SPD&#x27;s. The liberal Free Democratic Party improved its vote and gained representation.

<doc id="729193" wikidata="Q1921511" url="?curid=729193" title="Mercury-Redstone 1">
<text>Mercury-Redstone 1 (MR-1) was the first Mercury-Redstone uncrewed flight test in Project Mercury and the first attempt to launch a Mercury spacecraft with the Mercury-Redstone Launch Vehicle. Intended to be an uncrewed sub-orbital spaceflight, it was launched on November 21, 1960 from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station, Florida. The launch failed in an abnormal fashion: immediately after the Mercury-Redstone rocket started to move, it shut itself down and settled back on the pad, after which the capsule jettisoned its escape rocket and deployed its recovery parachutes. The failure has been referred to as the &quot;four-inch flight&quot;, for the approximate distance traveled by the launch vehicle.

==Test background and launch failure==

The purpose of the MR-1 flight was to qualify the Mercury spacecraft and the Mercury-Redstone launch vehicle for the sub-orbital Mercury mission. It would also qualify the spacecraft&#x27;s automated flight control and recovery systems, as well as the launch, tracking, and recovery operations on the ground. The flight would also test the Mercury-Redstone&#x27;s automatic inflight abort sensing system, which would be operating in &quot;open-loop&quot; mode. This meant that the abort sensing system could report a condition requiring an abort, but it would be unable to actually trigger an abort itself. Since the flight did not have a living passenger, this would not pose a safety problem, and it would prevent a faulty abort signal from prematurely ending the flight.

The test used Mercury spacecraft #2 together with Redstone MR-1; its launch location was Cape Canaveral Air Force Station&#x27;s Launch Complex 5. An early launch attempt on November 7 was canceled due to last-minute problems with the capsule, so launching was rescheduled for November 21.

On that day, following a normal countdown, the Mercury-Redstone&#x27;s engine ignited on schedule at 9:00 a.m. Eastern Standard Time (14:00 GMT). However, the engine shut down immediately after lift-off from the launch pad. The rocket only rose about before settling back onto the pad. Alarms were immediately sounded at LC-5, but the Redstone didn&#x27;t explode. Instead it merely sat in place on the launch pad, after which an unusual sequence of events happened.

Immediately after the Redstone&#x27;s engine shut down, the Mercury capsule&#x27;s escape rocket jettisoned itself, leaving the capsule attached to the Redstone booster. The escape rocket rose to an altitude of and landed about away. Three seconds after the escape rocket fired, the capsule deployed its drogue parachute; it then deployed the main and reserve parachutes, ejecting the radio antenna fairing in the process.

In the end, all that had been launched was the escape rocket. However, the fully fueled and powered-up Redstone was now sitting on LC-5 with nothing securing it to the pad. Various other dangers existed as well, such as the capsule&#x27;s retrorocket package and the range safety destruct charges. Furthermore, the capsule&#x27;s main and reserve parachutes were hanging down the side of the rocket, threatening to tip it over if they caught enough wind; this did not occur, however, as the weather conditions were favorable. Amid the panicked atmosphere in the control room, the launch team was unable to come up with quick and viable options to rectify the situation. Flight director Chris Kraft rejected several unsafe interventions, including using a rifle to shoot holes in the booster&#x27;s propellant tanks to depressurize them. He eventually took the advice of one of the test engineers to simply wait out the battery discharge and let the oxidizer boil off. This early test failure and subsequent panic led Kraft to declare &quot;That is the first rule of flight control. If you don&#x27;t know what to do, don&#x27;t do anything.&quot; Technicians therefore waited until the next morning, when the flight batteries in the rocket and capsule had drained and the Redstone&#x27;s liquid oxygen had boiled off, before they could work on the rocket and render it safe.

==Causes of the failure==

Investigation revealed that the Redstone&#x27;s engine shutdown was caused by two of its electrical cables separating in the wrong order. These cables were a control cable, which provided various control signals, and a power cable, which provided electrical power and grounding. Both cables were plugged into the rocket at the bottom edge of one of its tail fins and would separate at liftoff. The control cable was supposed to separate first, followed by the power cable. However, for this launch, the control cable was longer than expected—it was one designed for the military PGM-11 Redstone missile rather than the shorter cable designed for Mercury-Redstone. This control cable had been clamped to compensate for its greater length, but when the vehicle lifted off, the clamping did not work as planned and the control cable separation was delayed, eventually occurring about 29 milliseconds &quot;after&quot; the power cable had separated.

During this brief interval, the lack of electrical grounding caused a substantial current to flow through an electrical relay which was supposed to trigger normal engine cut-off at the end of powered flight. This relay tripped, causing the Redstone to shut off its engine and send a &quot;normal cut-off&quot; signal to the capsule. Under normal circumstances, when the capsule received this signal during a flight, it would do two things: it would jettison its escape rocket, which was no longer of any use, and after the escape rocket had flown clear, fire the explosive bolts holding it to the booster for separation. In the case of MR-1, the capsule did jettison the escape rocket as it was designed to, but the separation sequence did not occur. The capsule was designed to suspend this separation until the vehicle&#x27;s acceleration had almost ceased, so that the capsule would not be hit by a still-accelerating launch vehicle. This would happen when the capsule&#x27;s acceleration sensors detected an acceleration approaching 0 g, which it would normally experience after the Redstone had shut down and was entering free fall. However, in MR-1, the Redstone was not in free fall but rather sitting supported on the ground. Thus the capsule sensors detected the effect of their own supported weight, which they read as a constant &quot;acceleration&quot; of 1 g. Because of this apparent acceleration, capsule separation was disabled.

The jettison of the escape rocket activated the capsule&#x27;s parachute recovery system. Since the altitude was below , this system was triggered by its atmospheric pressure sensors and followed its usual sequence, with the drogue parachute deploying first, followed by the main parachute. But because the main parachute was not supporting the capsule&#x27;s weight, the parachute system did not detect any load on this chute, so it acted as if the chute had failed and deployed the reserve parachute.

Since the Redstone&#x27;s automatic inflight abort sensing system was running in open-loop mode, the engine shutdown did not trigger an abort. However, the system did report an abort condition, so it did function properly.

== Aftermath ==
The Redstone had suffered some minor damage from falling back on the pad, but it could still be used after refurbishment, so it was returned to Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville, Alabama, and was held in reserve. A new test flight was scheduled, Mercury-Redstone 1A (MR-1A), which would use a new Mercury-Redstone rocket, numbered MR-3. MR-1&#x27;s Mercury spacecraft, #2, was undamaged, so it was reused for MR-1A, together with the escape rocket from spacecraft #8 and the antenna fairing from spacecraft #10.

To prevent a failure like MR-1&#x27;s from recurring, subsequent Mercury-Redstones added a grounding strap about long to electrically connect the rocket to the launch pad. This strap was designed to separate from the rocket well after all other electrical connections to the ground had been severed.

Mercury engineers were also concerned that MR-1&#x27;s failure had allowed a &quot;normal cutoff&quot; signal to reach the capsule and trigger the premature jettisoning of the escape rocket, since in an actual emergency this would remove the only escape mechanism for the astronaut. Had MR-1 been a crewed mission, the normal contingency would have been a pad abort, lifting the Mercury capsule off the booster and to safety via the escape rocket. Since the escape rocket had instead jettisoned itself from the capsule the astronaut would have been left in a very precarious situation, stuck inside the Mercury capsule atop a fully fueled, fully independently powered, yet completely untethered and partially damaged Redstone booster. To prevent a situation like this, the Mercury-Redstone was altered so that it could not send a &quot;normal cutoff&quot; signal to the capsule until 129.5 seconds after liftoff, about 10 seconds before the expected time of the Redstone&#x27;s actual engine cutoff.

MR-1 was never used for another flight after its return to Huntsville. It was eventually put on display at the Space Orientation Center of Marshall Space Flight Center.

==Current location==
Mercury spacecraft #2, used in both the Mercury-Redstone 1 and Mercury-Redstone 1A flights, was displayed at the NASA Ames Exploration Center, Moffett Federal Airfield, near Mountain View, California. As of July 13, 2022, it is now on display at the Cradle of Aviation Museum in Garden City, New York. Other Mercury-Redstone rockets are on display at the U.S. Space &amp; Rocket Center in Huntsville and elsewhere.

<doc id="729204" wikidata="Q7763104" url="?curid=729204" title="The Secret Storm">
<text>The Secret Storm is an American television soap opera that aired on CBS from February 1, 1954, to February 8, 1974. It was created by Roy Winsor, who also created the long-running soap operas &quot;Search for Tomorrow&quot; and &quot;Love of Life&quot;. Gloria Monty, of &quot;General Hospital&quot; fame, was a longtime director of the series.

Like most CBS soap operas of the time, such as &quot;Guiding Light&quot; and &quot;As the World Turns&quot;, &quot;The Secret Storm&quot; was broadcast live, and later taped, in New York at the CBS Broadcast Center on West 57th Street. At some point in the 1970s up until cancellation, it was taped at CBS Studio 54 at 221 West 26th Street in the Chelsea section of Manhattan.

==Plot==
The story follows the Ames family, a prominent clan in the fictional Northeastern United States town of Woodbridge (eventually identified as being located in New York). The Ames family initially consisted of Peter, his wife Ellen, and their three children: Susan, Jerry, and Amy. However, Ellen was killed in the first episode and subsequent stories focused on Peter raising his three children. Lending a hand, however dubiously, was Peter&#x27;s sister-in-law, as well as his former fiancée Pauline Rysdale (Haila Stoddard).

Despite Susan&#x27;s and Pauline&#x27;s efforts to derail any new romances in Peter&#x27;s life, he eventually remarried twice. His first remarriage was to Myra Lake (June Graham), one of Amy&#x27;s teachers, but that ended in divorce. His second and more successful remarriage was to divorcee Valerie Hill (Lori March), to whom he was married until his death.

Later, the villainous Belle Clemens (Marla Adams) was the main source of trouble for Woodbridge, taking over from Aunt Pauline, the show&#x27;s original villain. When Belle&#x27;s daughter Robin drowned in an accident, Belle blamed Amy for the death.

==Development==
Amy was allowed to age in real time rather than suddenly aging as many younger soap characters did. Jada Rowland played the character with a few breaks for the duration of the program. Other actresses in the role included Beverly Lunsford, June Carter and Lynne Adams.

Actress/writer Stephanie Braxton and actor Dan Hamilton met while performing on the show, and later married. Lori March, who played Valerie Hill Ames for many years, later played the wife of her real-life husband Alexander Scourby. Actress Diana Muldaur also married co-star James Vickery.

Some performers who appeared on &quot;The Secret Storm&quot; and later achieved greater fame include Warren Berlinger, James Broderick, John Colicos, Christina Crawford, Jennifer Darling, Cliff DeYoung, Joan Hotchkis, Barnard Hughes, Don Galloway, Audrey Landers, Ken Kercheval, Ed Kemmer, Terry Kiser, Diane Ladd, Laurence Luckinbill, Biff McGuire, Kim Milford, Donna Mills, Robert Morse, George Reinholt, Jane Rose, Gary Sandy, Roy Scheider, Robin Strasser, Frank Sutton and Edward Winter.

Other well-known performers who appeared on the show include Joan Crawford (substituting for her daughter), Troy Donahue, Marjorie Gateson, Margaret Hamilton, Jeffrey Lynn, Alexander Scourby, Madeleine Sherwood and Frances Sternhagen.

Actress Bethel Leslie was at one time co-head writer. Other noted head writers include Jane and Ira Avery, and its final head writer Gabrielle Upton.

===Joan Crawford===
In 1968, Oscar-winning actress Joan Crawford, at the time over 60 years old, filled in for her ailing daughter, Christina, who portrayed Joan Borman Kane, a character aged just 24. The episodes were broadcast on October 25, 28, 29 and 30. Although no full shows with Crawford are known to exist, clips have appeared on YouTube. The 1981 film &quot;Mommie Dearest&quot; portrayed Crawford&#x27;s appearance without specifying the name of the series.

==Broadcast history==
CBS first placed &quot;The Secret Storm&quot; at 4:15 pm (3:15 Central) as a 15-minute program, sandwiched between &quot;The Brighter Day&quot; and &quot;On Your Account&quot; (later &quot;The Edge of Night&quot;). Beginning in 1957, it competed against ABC&#x27;s &quot;American Bandstand&quot;, then a weekday show (the latter show was reduced to Saturdays-only in 1963).

On June 18, 1962, CBS extended &quot;The Secret Storm&quot; to 30 minutes, and &quot;The Brighter Day&quot; was moved to an early-morning time slot. &quot;The Secret Storm&quot; took over the 4:00 pm time slot, where it ran for six years and mainly competed against NBC&#x27;s &quot;Match Game&quot;. However, in 1966, the Gothic soap opera &quot;Dark Shadows&quot; premiered on ABC, and that (later the &quot;Dating Game&quot;) prompted CBS to move &quot;The Secret Storm&quot; back an hour to 3:00 pm Eastern (2:00 Central) on September 9, 1968, facing NBC&#x27;s fast-rising &quot;Another World&quot; &amp; ABC&#x27;s &quot;General Hospital&quot;.

&quot;The Secret Storm&quot; moved from black and white to color broadcasts on September 11, 1967.

After four years of mediocre ratings, CBS changed the show&#x27;s timeslot to 3:30 Eastern on September 11, 1972, as part of a major overhaul of its daytime line-up. &quot;The Secret Storm&quot; followed &quot;Love is a Many Splendored Thing&quot;; the latter show was cancelled in 1973. CBS eventually returned &quot;The Secret Storm&quot; to its previous 4:00 pm time on March 26, 1973. However, its audience share and ratings failed to keep it afloat in an increasingly cost-competitive network daytime scene.

Finally, as a result of pre-emptions mounting from key affiliates such as KPIX in San Francisco, and an economic recession causing a decline in ad revenues, CBS decided to cancel the serial in 1974 and replace it with a less-expensive game show, &quot;Tattletales&quot;. This had also been the reason for the cancellations of &quot;Where the Heart Is&quot; and &quot;Love Is a Many Splendored Thing&quot; the previous year.

In all the turmoil of its later years, the main reason for the show&#x27;s demise may have been CBS&#x27;s choice to buy the show from the original sponsor/packager, American Home Products, in 1969. After CBS purchased the show, it suffered from numerous head writer and producer changes. AHP&#x27;s primary task after reacquiring the rights to the show in 1974, the year CBS cancelled the show, was to continue the series by syndicating it elsewhere. However, NBC executive Lin Bolen rejected the show in favor of her own project, &quot;How to Survive a Marriage&quot; (which ran for one year and three months on that network), and ABC chose to use its daytime budget to buy out Agnes Nixon&#x27;s soaps. Thus, American Home Products decided not to continue the show even in syndication, due to the lack of clearances among affiliates in the largest markets to justify continued production. The 5,195th and final episode was shown one week after the show&#x27;s 20th anniversary.

===Title sequences===
The series had two distinctive opening visuals. The first was an illustration of a tree with windblown branches, used from the first episode until around 1960. The second was a live-action film clip of an ocean surf at high tide, crashing against the rocks.

For a brief period in 1967, &quot;The Secret Storm&quot;, in its first color days, featured shots of a town meant to represent the community Woodbridge. The opening was similar to that of the primetime drama &quot;Peyton Place&quot;.

For the last few years of the show, the theme song was the theme from the second movement of the &quot;Double Concerto&quot; by Johannes Brahms. The in-house organist was Charles Paul, later replaced (as Paul was at &quot;Love of Life&quot;) by Eddie Layton. Carey Gold provided a more contemporary sound with synthesizer and piano during the show&#x27;s later years. Paul returned as &quot;Love of Life&#x27;s&quot; final musical director.

==Characters==

===Amy Ames===

Amy Kincaid (&quot;née&quot; Ames, previously Rysdale and Britton) was the main heroine on &quot;The Secret Storm&quot; and was mostly played by Jada Rowland, who grew up in the role, a rarity for any soap opera character. During a break, Beverly Lunsford replaced Rowland in the part.

Amy was the youngest child of Peter and Ellen Ames of the fictional community of Woodbridge, New York. On the first episode, her mother was injured in an automobile accident and died. This sent her father and her older brother and sister, Jerry Ames and Susan Ames Dunbar into grief. The oldest daughter, Susan, became the mother figure, and tended to be very bossy; Jerry went after the driver who caused his mother&#x27;s death and tried to kill him, but was sent to reform school for this. Amy became worried and everyone was working overtime to make sure her needs were met, because of her young age. During her father&#x27;s short-lived marriage to Myra Lake (who was one of her teachers), she considered her a mother figure.

Her first marriage was to Kip Rysdale, the son of Arthur Rysdale who had married her aunt Pauline Rysdale. Kip had been with a girl named Nina DeFrancisco, the daughter of his Spanish instructor. When she died, the road opened for them to marry. Then she discovered that she was pregnant by her college professor, Paul Britton. She divorced Kip and married Paul, and from this union, they had a daughter, Lisa. Kip eventually went out with a nasty woman named Janet Hill (Bibi Besch), who had become Amy&#x27;s stepsister, due to her mother, Valerie marrying Peter, Amy&#x27;s father. In a classic episode from the mid-sixties, Amy and Janet squared off over Kip.

Meanwhile, Amy had been on a boat with Belle Clemmens&#x27; illegitimate daughter, Robin, when there was an accident. Robin drowned, and Belle, totally furious, intended to make Amy&#x27;s life miserable, which she did with great glee.

Belle stole Paul Britton from Amy, which sent her into a nervous breakdown. She had been helped by a Dr. Ian Northcote, who had married her stepmother, Valerie Hill Ames. She met a man named Kevin Kincaid, and later on, married him. Conniving Belle had married his father, Dan, after using Paul and throwing him away.

Amy and Kevin divorced, and she was artificially inseminated by a Dr. Brian Neeves. A nurse named Martha Ann Ashley (Audre Johnson), who was a cohort of Belle&#x27;s told her what was going on, and Belle used this as a blackmailing tactic against Amy to keep her lover stocked in racing cars. However, this backfired in Belle&#x27;s face when her lover, Robert, began to see her former ward, Joanna Morrison.

Amy gave birth to Danielle (her child that was artificially inseminated) and found out that Kevin had returned to Woodbridge. He had wanted to divorce Amy in London, (he had been shot and left paralyzed from the waist down) but he was in the middle of the living room in Valerie&#x27;s house. He attempted to walk to Amy, but missed the mark by a few inches, he fell to the floor. Amy fell to the floor as well, joined by her daughters Lisa and Danielle. Valerie came into the room and saw the love that her stepdaughter had for her husband, and they never parted again.

===Ellen Ames===
Ellen Ames (&quot;née&quot; Tyrell) was played by Ellen Cobb-Hill.

Ellen, the youngest daughter of Judge J.T. Tyrell and Grace Tyrell, was also the younger sister of Pauline Rysdale, and was married to her sister&#x27;s ex-fiancé, Peter Ames. Peter and Ellen eloped, to the shock of Pauline, who had always loved him. From this union came three children: Susan Ames Dunbar, the oldest, Jerry Ames, the sole son, and Amy Ames, the youngest. In the first episode of series Ellen was involved in a car accident and was taken to Woodbridge Hospital in Woodbridge, New York. She died of her injuries, and the family spiraled out of control.

Jerry was furious and was intent exacting revenge on the drunk driver who took his mother&#x27;s life. He beat him violently and Jerry wound up in reform school. Susan took over as the mother figure of the family, and became quite bossy.

===Peter Ames===
Peter Ames was the lead male character. Although played by other actors, Peter Hobbs was the actor most identified in the role.

Peter was the father of three children who had suddenly lost his wife, Ellen, in a car crash. She died of her injuries at Woodbridge (New York) Hospital. He tried his hardest to be both mother and father to his three children. His oldest, Susan Ames Dunbar, became the mother figure, and also became somewhat bossy; his son, Jerry was so angry with the driver who took his mother&#x27;s life that he nearly killed him, and landed in reform school. Amy, the youngest, was worried, and was the focus, as everyone tried to make sure she was all right.

He had always been loved by Pauline Rysdale, his former sister-in-law, whom he had been engaged to before eventually eloping with Ellen. Pauline and Susan worked overtime to deflect the attention of any women who were interested in Peter. He did remarry a woman named Myra Lake (June Graham), who was one of Amy&#x27;s teachers, but the marriage dissolved because the two families didn&#x27;t like each other, although Amy considered her a mother figure.

His third and most successful marriage was with widow Valerie Hill Ames. They were happy for quite a number of years until he succumbed to a heart attack while he was on a business trip.

===Valerie Hill Ames===
Valerie Northcote was played from 1961 until the show&#x27;s end in 1974, by the actress Lori March.

Valerie was the divorced woman who became the third wife of widower Peter Ames. Although her daughter, Janet Hill Porter (Bibi Besch) disapproved of her mother remarrying, she eventually was forced to accept him. However, Janet still caused a lot of problems for the family. Valerie married Peter and for several years, was the shelter for the Ames family. She and Peter were happy for several years until a heart attack while on a business trip, killed Peter. Valerie grieved for a respectful amount of time, until she met a psychiatrist who was treating her stepdaughter, Amy Ames. His name was Dr. Ian Northcote (who was first played by Gordon Rigsby, and then by Lori March&#x27;s real-life husband, Alexander Scourby).

Despite her remarriage, she stayed in the Ames family&#x27;s lives, notably Amy, who looked to Valerie as a mother figure, up until the show&#x27;s end.

===Belle Clemens===
Belle Clemens was played from 1968 to 1974 by the actress Marla Adams.

Belle and her daughter were first befriended by the Ames family. Belle was estranged from her father, newspaper editor Charlie Clemons, and her sister.

Beautiful but vindictive Belle had lost her illegitimate daughter Robin, in a boating accident and blamed Amy, her former friend, for it. She simply enjoyed making life miserable for Amy, and proved to be good at it.

She stole Amy&#x27;s second husband, Paul Britton, driving Amy into a nervous breakdown. The character of Dr. Ian Northcote and his family were introduced when Amy had her mental problems. Belle&#x27;s life was later complicated when a former flame R. B. Keefer (played by Troy Donahue) came to Woodbridge and was later murdered, a crime for which Belle Britton would be arrested, tried, and later cleared.

After using Paul and then throwing him away, she married a man named Dan Kincaid (played by Bernard Barrow) who she thought would become the state&#x27;s next governor, but he lost. In a forced kinship, Amy married Dan&#x27;s son, Kevin, making them in-laws, but they still hated each other, and would do so until the end of the show. Belle, while married to Dan, was having an affair with his illegitimate son Robert Landers (Dan Hamiliton), a racecar driver.

When Amy was artificially inseminated by Dr. Brian Neeves, Belle found out about it from a nurse named Martha Ann Ashley (Audre Johnson), who was one of her cohorts. He used this information to extract blackmail money from Amy to keep her new lover full of racing cars.

At the show&#x27;s end, she left her husband, Dan, and, keeping true to her selfish nature, and having made Amy&#x27;s life completely miserable, went on to a glamorous singing career.

Belle&#x27;s full name was Belle Clemens Britton Kincaid.

===Susan Ames Dunbar===
Susan was the eldest daughter of Peter Ames and his wife, Ellen. After her mother&#x27;s death in a car accident, she became the new mother figure in the family. She was usually responsible for the well being of her younger siblings, Jerry Ames, and her youngest sister, Amy. She also resented any plans of her father to remarry, a situation shared by her maternal aunt, Pauline Rysdale. Despite all her plans, though, he did eventually remarry, first to Myra Lake, whom she outright despised, and then to Valerie, whom she somewhat got along with.

At some times, Susan had a lot of anger and animosity towards her father and his constant belief of principles, especially during his marriage to Myra. She had a tendency to back people of very little or no principle and their causes, such as businessman Frank Bennett, whom her husband had worked for, but resigned from his job, due to his unethical means (he had been involved in a school land swindle that Peter was trying to stop) as well as backing her Aunt Pauline&#x27;s divorce and backing an embezzler named Bryan Fuller, who was also enamored of Aunt Pauline.

She was married to a man named Alan Dunbar, (James Vickery) a former golf pro who was involved in a drug ring. He slowly broke away from that life, and married Susan. She also had his son named Peter, named after her father, Peter. Susan and Alan were happy, despite some storms, especially dealing with his fellow newspaper reporter Ann Wicker, who was seducing Alan. He almost succumbed to temptation, but still remained a good husband, until he was presumed dead in Vietnam.

Thinking that he was dead, Susan married a man named Frank Carver. Alan, now played by Liam Sullivan, turned up alive, and his war experiences made him psychotic. He also re-established his Mafia connections by joining a drug ring headed by Dan Kincaid. Alan was later murdered and Susan was prosecuted for his murder by District Attorney Ursula Winthrop (Jacqueline Brookes), who bore a grudge against the Ames family.

Susan Ames Dunbar Carver was played by several different actresses. Jean Mowry originated the role in 1954 and departed in 1956, going on to play Pat Cunningham on &quot;As the World Turns&quot; from 1957-1959 until retiring from acting to marry. Rachel Taylor then took on the role until 1957. The actress Tori Darnay temporarily played Susan. Norma Moore stepped into the role from 1957, then was replaced by Mary Foskett in 1958 who successfully carried on Susan&#x27;s role until 1964 when Frances Helm took on the role for a few months before she was replaced in 1965 by Judy Lewis. Lewis left the show and Diana Van der Vlis temporarily replaced her. Van der Vlis was replaced by Mary McGregor who was in turn replaced by Lewis when she returned to the show in 1969 and played the role until January 1972.

===Pauline Rysdale===
Pauline Rysdale, (&quot;née&quot; Tyrell, previously Harris) known more familiarly as &quot;Aunt Pauline&quot;, was played by the actress Haila Stoddard.

Pauline was the daughter of Judge J.T. and Grace Tyrell, who owned Tyrell&#x27;s Department Store. The Tyrell family was one of the oldest and richest families in town. She and Peter Ames were engaged to be married, but was shocked to discover that he eloped with her younger sister, Ellen Ames. One day later, Ellen was in a car accident and was killed. She helped her grieving brother in-law, and his three children, but she had some ulterior motives. She was still in love with Peter and was angling to still marry him.

After several affairs, Pauline eventually married a man named Arthur Rysdale. She was interested in nearly destroying any relationship that Peter would have. He was intent on marrying Jane Edwards, the recently hired housekeeper, but Pauline found Jane&#x27;s presumably dead husband, Bruce, and the two reconciled. With her own marriage to Arthur Rysdale, she was not always causing any more trouble. Arthur&#x27;s son, Kip, eventually married, then divorced Pauline&#x27;s niece, Amy Ames.

During the battle with Jane, Pauline had help from her oldest niece, Susan Ames Dunbar. She was as against her father remarrying as Aunt Pauline was.

However, by the 1970s, Aunt Pauline had mellowed a great deal and was not as malevolent as in the 1950s. She had been relegated to the background, but it was presumed that she was still living in Woodbridge.

<text>&quot;A Japanese Harmony of Art, Culture, and the Simple Life&quot; (1906) by Okakura Kakuzō (1906) is a long essay linking the role of &quot;chadō&quot; (&quot;teaism&quot;) to the aesthetic and cultural aspects of Japanese life and protesting Western caricatures of &quot;the East&quot;.

==Content==
Addressed to a Western audience, it was originally written in English and is one of the great English tea classics. Okakura had been taught at a young age to speak English and was proficient at communicating his thoughts to the Western mind. In his book, he discusses such topics as Zen and Taoism, but also the secular aspects of tea and Japanese life. The book emphasizes how Teaism taught the Japanese many things, the most important of which were simplicity and humility:It (Teaism) inculcates purity and harmony, the mystery of mutual charity, the romanticism of the social order. It is essentially a worship of the Imperfect, as it is a tender attempt to accomplish something possible in this impossible thing we know as life.This, Okakura believed, was an aesthetic that should inform everything from the arts and architecture to daily life and was already informing them in Japan. 

In his &quot;sleek complacency&quot;, however, the Westerner tended to see in the tea ceremony only &quot;another instance of the thousand and one oddities which constitute the quaintness and childishness of the East to him&quot;. Writing in the aftermath of the Russo-Japanese War, Kakuzō commented that the Westerner regarded Japan as &quot;barbarous while she indulged in the gentle arts of peace&quot;, and began to call her civilized only when &quot;she began to commit wholesale slaughter on the Manchurian battlefields&quot;.

In the book, Kakuzō states that Teaism, in itself, is one of the profound universal remedies in which conflicting parties might find reconciliation. He ends the book with a chapter on Tea Masters and spends some time talking about Sen no Rikyū and his contribution to the Japanese tea ceremony.

According to Tomonobu Imamichi, Heidegger&#x27;s concept of &quot;Dasein&quot; in &quot;Sein und Zeit&quot; was inspired – although Heidegger remained silent on this – by Okakura Kakuzō&#x27;s concept of (being-in-the-worldness) expressed in &quot;The Book of Tea&quot; to describe Zhuangzi&#x27;s philosophy, which Imamichi&#x27;s professor Ito Kichinosuke had offered to Heidegger in 1919, after having followed private lessons with him the year before:Ito Kichinosuke, one of my teachers at university, studied in Germany in 1918 immediately after the First World War and hired Heidegger as a private tutor. Before moving back to Japan at the end of his studies, Professor Ito handed Heidegger a copy of Das Buch vom Tee, the German translation of Okakura Kakuzo&#x27;s &quot;The Book of Tea&quot;, as a token of his appreciation. That was in 1919. Sein und Zeit (Being and Time) was published in 1927 and made Heidegger famous. Mr. Ito was surprised and indignant that Heidegger used Zhuangzi&#x27;s concept without giving him credit. Years later in 1945, Professor Ito reminisced with me and, speaking in his Shonai dialect, said, &quot;Heidegger did a lot for me, but I should&#x27;ve laid into him for stealing&quot;. There are other indications that Heidegger was inspired by Eastern writings, but let&#x27;s leave this topic here. I have heard many stories of this kind from Professor Ito and checked their veracity. I recounted this story at a reception held after a series of lectures I gave in 1968 at the University of Heidelberg at the invitation of Hans-Georg Gadamer. Japanese exchange students attended these lectures, and I explained that there were many other elements of classical Eastern thought in Heidegger&#x27;s philosophy and gave some examples. I must have said too much and may even have said that Heidegger was a plagiarist (Plagiator). Gadamer was Heidegger&#x27;s favorite student, and we ended up not speaking to each other for 4 or 5 years because he was so angry with me.&quot;The Book of Tea&quot; has been cited as an important influence on the work of Frank Lloyd Wright, Arthur Wesley Dow, and Georgia O&#x27;Keeffe.

<text>Juan Carlos Valerón Santana (born 17 June 1975) is a Spanish former professional footballer who played as an attacking midfielder.

Over 15 seasons, he amassed La Liga totals of 390 matches and 29 goals with Mallorca, Atlético Madrid and Deportivo, spending 13 years with the latter club. He started and finished his 22-year senior career with Las Palmas. 

Valerón represented Spain in the 2002 World Cup and two European Championships, earning 46 caps.

==Playing career==
===Club===
====Early years====
Born in Arguineguín, Gran Canaria, Valerón started playing with hometown&#x27;s Las Palmas, but switched to the Balearic Islands in the 1997–98 season, representing Mallorca and making his La Liga debut on 31 August 1997 by playing ten minutes in a 2–1 home win over Valencia.

He was an instrumental figure in the club&#x27;s qualification for the UEFA Cup Winners&#x27; Cup, with the team also finishing fifth in the league and reaching the final of the Copa del Rey, lost to eventual champions Barcelona in a penalty shoot-out.

====Atlético and Deportivo====
In the next two years, Valerón played for Atlético Madrid where he was an undisputed starter but, following the side&#x27;s relegation in 2000, he joined Deportivo de La Coruña, sharing club and position with equally talented Brazilian Djalminha. He gradually would become first choice, signing a contract to eventually see off the remainder of his career with the Galicians in February 2004.

In January 2006, however, Valerón started a bad run with injuries. He suffered a knee injury which relapsed in July and early 2007 (with him only managing two league appearances in the process), leading to another surgery. Consequently, he did not reappear until midway through the 2007–08 campaign.

On 27 January 2008, Valerón returned to the bench in Deportivo&#x27;s 3–1 home win against Real Valladolid, coming on as a substitute for Andrés Guardado for the final 15 minutes – his first match for over a year. In 2008–09, aged 33, he eventually became an important first-team fixture again, both on domestic and European fronts.

The 36-year-old Valerón was an undisputed starter for Depor in the 2011–12 season, scoring a career-best five goals in nearly 3,000 minutes of action in Segunda División as his team returned to the top flight after one year out, as champions. Even though he had a contract until 2015, he chose to leave in June 2013, having taken part in 422 games in all competitions (32 goals).

====Return to Las Palmas====
On 14 July 2013, following another Deportivo relegation, Valerón returned to his first club Las Palmas after 16 years, signing a one-year contract with an option for a second. He continued to be an important first-team member during his tenure, achieving promotion to the top flight in 2015.

In summer 2015, Valerón renewed his contract with the &quot;Amarillos&quot; for a further year. On 26 September, he first appeared with the club in the top flight, featuring 22 minutes in a 1–2 away loss to Barcelona in what was his first game in the competition in 847 days, and becoming the fifth oldest player to play there at the age of 40 years and 101 days; he climbed one position on 12 December after coming on as substitute against Real Betis, surpassing former Deportivo teammate Donato.

On 1 March 2016, after being featured in a 4–0 home win against Getafe, Valerón appeared in his 400th game in the Spanish top tier. On 7 May, he announced his retirement.

===International===
A Spain international since 18 November 1998 in a 2–2 friendly draw with Italy in Salerno, Valerón appeared with the national side at UEFA Euro 2000, the 2002 FIFA World Cup (where he scored in a 3–1 win against Slovenia) and Euro 2004, netting immediately after coming from the bench in a 1–0 victory over Russia in the latter competition.

He made his last appearance for his country on 26 March 2005, a 3–0 defeat of China. In late July 2019, he was hired by the Canarian Football Federation to be responsible for the several teams in the region that took part in the corresponding competitions.

==Coaching career==
Shortly after retiring, Valerón began working as a manager after completing the UEFA B course. He was appointed youth coach at Las Palmas and, ahead of the 2017–18 season, was named assistant to Manolo Márquez in the first team; the latter left his position three months later, however, and the former returned to the academy.

On 24 January 2018, Valerón agreed to join Juan Manuel Rodríguez&#x27;s staff at Las Palmas B, the reserve team. He resigned from his post in June for personal reasons, but the following January resumed his work with the youth sides.

Valerón returned to his former club Deportivo in June 2020, being appointed manager of the reserves in Tercera División.

==Player profile==
===Style of play===
A talented and creative attacking midfielder with an eye for goal, Valerón was known for his vision and technical abilities, especially his passing skills and ball control, but was also injury-prone and inconsistent. 

===Reception===

Valerón was widely regarded as one of the most respected players in Spain, and as an important figure for Deportivo. Andrés Iniesta said he would pay to watch him play, whilst manager Juan Antonio Anquela called him a reference for Spanish football and fellow coach Vicente del Bosque admitted that he would always fit in the national team. His Las Palmas teammate, Javi Castellano, praised him for his honesty and modesty.

Miguel Ángel Ramírez, Las Palmas president, said in 2015 he was trying to persuade Valerón to play another season so that he would be able to say goodbye to all the stadia in Spain where he was consistently cheered– this was exemplified by his last game at the Camp Nou, with former national teammate Luis Enrique and coach of the opposing team applauding as he took the pitch. Former Dutch internationals Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink and Roy Makaay claimed he was the best player they had ever played with.

Ahead of his return to the Estadio Riazor in April 2016, Deportivo manager Víctor Sánchez said that Valerón would have won the Ballon d&#x27;Or had he played for a more fashionable club.

==Personal life==
Valerón&#x27;s older brother, Miguel Ángel, was also a footballer and a midfielder; having represented Las Palmas and Mallorca B, his career was also curtailed by injuries. Later, together with another sibling, Pedro, they created a football club/school named Abrisajac, from biblical characters Abraham, Isaac and Jacob, and Juan Carlos still played there one year before retiring for good.

Valerón was a close friend of fellow Canarian Manuel Pablo, who also played for Las Palmas, Deportivo and Spain. He was also known for his devotion to God, but admitted that he and his family did not follow any religion.

Valerón&#x27;s nephew, Manu, also played youth football for Las Palmas.

<text>The Wisconsin Maritime Museum is a maritime museum in the Lake Michigan port and shipbuilding city of Manitowoc, Wisconsin, U.S.. It preserves and teaches about the maritime history of the Great Lakes and Wisconsin.

== History ==
The museum was founded in 1969 as the Manitowoc Submarine Memorial Association. The &quot;USS Cobia&quot; arrived in Manitowoc and was initially restored in 1970, and in 1986 became part of the museum as well as becoming a National Historic Landmark and joining the National Register of Historic Places. The submarine has been restored and has one of the oldest operational radar systems in the world.

The &quot;Cobia&quot; was dry docked in 1996, and in 2022 the museum received a $500,000 grant to dry dock the &quot;Cobia&quot; again for regular maintenance and repairs.

== Exhibits ==
The museum offers guided tours of the &quot;Cobia&quot; as well as overnight stays on the submarine. In addition to the &quot;Cobia&quot;, the museum displays the 65-ton &quot;Chief Wawatam&quot; steam engine and exhibits on shipbuilding and shipwrecks in Wisconsin, a model ship gallery, children&#x27;s play exhibits and a temporary exhibit gallery.

<doc id="729237" wikidata="Q1074013" url="?curid=729237" title="A Dynamical Theory of the Electromagnetic Field">
<text>&quot;A Dynamical Theory of the Electromagnetic Field&quot; is a paper by James Clerk Maxwell on electromagnetism, published in 1865. Physicist Freeman Dyson called the publishing of the paper the &quot;most important event of the nineteenth century in the history of the physical sciences&quot;.

The paper was key in establishing the classical theory of electromagnetism. Maxwell derives an electromagnetic wave equation with a velocity for light in close agreement with measurements made by experiment, and also deduces that light is an electromagnetic wave.

==Publication==
Following standard procedure for the time, the paper was first read to the Royal Society on 8 December 1864, having been sent by Maxwell to the society on 27 October. It then underwent peer review, being sent to William Thomson (later Lord Kelvin) on 24 December 1864. It was then sent to George Gabriel Stokes, the Society&#x27;s physical sciences secretary, on 23 March 1865. It was approved for publication in the &quot;Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society&quot; on 15 June 1865, by the Committee of Papers (essentially the society&#x27;s governing council) and sent to the printer the following day (16 June). During this period, &quot;Philosophical Transactions&quot; was only published as a bound volume once a year, and would have been prepared for the society&#x27;s anniversary day on 30 November (the exact date is not recorded). However, the printer would have prepared and delivered to Maxwell offprints, for the author to distribute as he wished, soon after 16 June.

==Maxwell&#x27;s original equations==
In part III of the paper, which is entitled &quot;General Equations of the Electromagnetic Field&quot;, Maxwell formulated twenty equations which were to become known as Maxwell&#x27;s equations, until this term became applied instead to a vectorized set of four equations selected in 1884, which had all appeared in his 1861 paper &quot;On Physical Lines of Force&quot;.

Heaviside&#x27;s versions of Maxwell&#x27;s equations are distinct by virtue of the fact that they are written in modern vector notation. They actually only contain one of the original eight—equation &quot;G&quot; (Gauss&#x27;s Law). Another of Heaviside&#x27;s four equations is an amalgamation of Maxwell&#x27;s law of total currents (equation &quot;A&quot;) with Ampère&#x27;s circuital law (equation &quot;C&quot;). This amalgamation, which Maxwell himself had actually originally made at equation (112) in &quot;On Physical Lines of Force&quot;, is the one that modifies Ampère&#x27;s Circuital Law to include Maxwell&#x27;s displacement current.

===Heaviside&#x27;s equations===
Eighteen of Maxwell&#x27;s twenty original equations can be vectorized into six equations, labeled (A) to (F) below, each of which represents a group of three original equations in component form. The 19th and 20th of Maxwell&#x27;s component equations appear as (G) and (H) below, making a total of eight vector equations. These are listed below in Maxwell&#x27;s original order, designated by the letters that Maxwell assigned to them in his 1865 paper.

;(A) The law of total currents

formula_1 formula_2 formula_3

;(B) Definition of the magnetic potential

formula_4

;(C) Ampère&#x27;s circuital law

formula_5

;(D) The Lorentz force and Faraday&#x27;s law of induction

formula_6

;(E) The electric elasticity equation

formula_7

;(F) Ohm&#x27;s law

formula_8

;(G) Gauss&#x27;s law

formula_9

;(H) Equation of continuity of charge

formula_10.
;Notation

: formula_11 is the magnetic field, which Maxwell called the &quot;&quot;magnetic intensity&quot;.
: formula_12 is the electric current density (with formula_13 being the total current density including displacement current).
: formula_14 is the displacement field (called the &quot;electric displacement&quot; by Maxwell).
: formula_15 is the free charge density (called the &quot;quantity of free electricity&quot; by Maxwell).
: formula_16 is the magnetic potential (called the &quot;angular impulse&quot; by Maxwell).
: formula_17 is the force per unit charge (called the &quot;electromotive force&quot; by Maxwell, not to be confused with the scalar quantity that is now called electromotive force; see below).
: formula_18 is the electric potential (which Maxwell also called &quot;electric potential&quot;).
: formula_19 is the electrical conductivity (Maxwell called the inverse of conductivity the &quot;specific resistance&quot;&quot;, what is now called the resistivity).
: formula_20 is the vector operator &quot;del&quot;.
Clarifications

Maxwell did not consider completely general materials; his initial formulation used linear, isotropic, nondispersive media with permittivity &quot;ϵ&quot; and permeability &quot;μ&quot;, although he also discussed the possibility of anisotropic materials.

Gauss&#x27;s law for magnetism () is not included in the above list, but follows directly from equation (B) by taking divergences (because the divergence of the curl is zero).

Substituting (A) into (C) yields the familiar differential form of the Maxwell-Ampère law.

Equation (D) implicitly contains the Lorentz force law and the differential form of Faraday&#x27;s law of induction. For a &quot;static&quot; magnetic field, formula_21 vanishes, and the electric field becomes conservative and is given by , so that (D) reduces to
formula_22.
This is simply the Lorentz force law on a per-unit-charge basis — although Maxwell&#x27;s equation (D) first appeared at equation (77) in &quot;On Physical Lines of Force&quot; in 1861, 34 years before Lorentz derived his force law, which is now usually presented as a supplement to the four &quot;Maxwell&#x27;s equations&quot;. The cross-product term in the Lorentz force law is the source of the so-called &quot;motional emf&quot; in electric generators (see also &quot;Moving magnet and conductor problem&quot;). Where there is no motion through the magnetic field — e.g., in transformers — we can drop the cross-product term, and the force per unit charge (called ) reduces to the electric field , so that Maxwell&#x27;s equation (D) reduces to
formula_23.
Taking curls, noting that the curl of a gradient is zero, we obtain
formula_24
which is the differential form of Faraday&#x27;s law. Thus the three terms on the right side of equation (D) may be described, from left to right, as the motional term, the transformer term, and the conservative term.

In deriving the electromagnetic wave equation, Maxwell considers the situation only from the rest frame of the medium, and accordingly drops the cross-product term. But he still works from equation (D), in contrast to modern textbooks which tend to work from Faraday&#x27;s law (see below).

The constitutive equations (E) and (F) are now usually written in the rest frame of the medium as and .

Maxwell&#x27;s equation (G), as printed in the 1865 paper, requires his to mean &quot;minus&quot; the charge density (if his are the components of), whereas his equation (H) requires his to mean &quot;plus&quot; the charge density (if his are the components of). John W. Arthur concludes that the sign of in (G) is wrong, and observes that this sign is corrected in Maxwell&#x27;s subsequent &quot;Treatise&quot;. Arthur speculates that the sign confusion may have arisen from the analogy between momentum and the magnetic vector potential (Maxwell&#x27;s &quot;electromagnetic momentum&quot;), in which positive mass corresponds to &quot;negative&quot; charge. Arthur also lists some corresponding equations from Maxwell&#x27;s earlier paper of 1861-2, and notes that the signs do not always match the later ones. The earlier signs (1861-2) are correct if are the components of while are the components of.

== Maxwell – electromagnetic light wave ==

In part VI of &quot;A Dynamical Theory of the Electromagnetic Field&quot;, subtitled &quot;Electromagnetic theory of light&quot;, Maxwell uses the correction to Ampère&#x27;s Circuital Law made in part III of his 1862 paper, &quot;On Physical Lines of Force&quot;, which is defined as displacement current, to derive the electromagnetic wave equation.

He obtained a wave equation with a speed in close agreement to experimental determinations of the speed of light. He commented,

Maxwell&#x27;s derivation of the electromagnetic wave equation has been replaced in modern physics by a much less cumbersome method which combines the corrected version of Ampère&#x27;s Circuital Law with Faraday&#x27;s law of electromagnetic induction.

===Modern equation methods===
To obtain the electromagnetic wave equation in a vacuum using the modern method, we begin with the modern &#x27;Heaviside&#x27; form of Maxwell&#x27;s equations. Using (SI units) in a vacuum, these equations are

If we take the curl of the curl equations we obtain

formula_25

formula_26

If we note the vector identity
formula_27
where formula_28 is any vector function of space, we recover the wave equations
formula_29

formula_30
where
formula_31 meters per second
is the speed of light in free space.

==Legacy and impact==
Of this paper and Maxwell&#x27;s related works, fellow physicist Richard Feynman said: &quot;From the long view of this history of mankind – seen from, say, 10,000 years from now – there can be little doubt that the most significant event of the 19th century will be judged as Maxwell&#x27;s discovery of the laws of electromagnetism.&quot;

Albert Einstein used Maxwell&#x27;s equations as the starting point for his special theory of relativity, presented in &quot;The Electrodynamics of Moving Bodies&quot;, one of Einstein&#x27;s 1905 &quot;Annus Mirabilis&quot; papers. In it is stated:

: the same laws of electrodynamics and optics will be valid for all frames of reference for which the equations of mechanics hold good

and

: Any ray of light moves in the &quot;stationary&quot; system of co-ordinates with the determined velocity c, whether the ray be emitted by a stationary or by a moving body.

Maxwell&#x27;s equations can also be derived by extending general relativity into five physical dimensions.

<text>Homer Samuel Ferguson (February 25, 1889December 17, 1982) was an American attorney, professor, judge, United States senator from Michigan, Ambassador to the Philippines, and later a judge on the United States Court of Military Appeals.

==Education and early career==
Ferguson attended public schools and the University of Pittsburgh. He graduated from the University of Michigan at Ann Arbor in 1913, was admitted to the bar the same year and commenced practice in Detroit. He was judge of the circuit court for Wayne County, Michigan, from 1929 to 1942 and also professor of law at Detroit College of Law (now part of Michigan State University) from 1929 to 1939.

==Senator==
Elected as a Republican to the United States Senate in 1942 and was reelected in 1948, serving from January 3, 1943, to January 3, 1955. Ferguson successfully was re-elected in 1948 over Democrat Frank E. Hook in a year dominated by the Democratic party&#x27;s upset wins. The election was contested by Hook, who alleged fraud; a subcommittee uncovered unethical practices in the election cycle, though it exonerated Ferguson, who was seated.

He unsuccessfully ran for reelection to a third-term in 1954, defeated by Democrat Patrick V. McNamara.

While in the Senate, he served as chairman of the Republican Policy Committee in the 83rd United States Congress.

In 1943, Ferguson was one of 12 senators who sponsored or co-sponsored the Rescue Resolution, which would have declared that Congress &quot;recommends and urges the creation by the President of a commission of diplomatic, economic, and military experts to formulate and effectuate a plan of immediate action designed to save the surviving Jewish people of Europe from extinction at the hands of Nazi Germany.&quot;

In 1948, he served as chairman of the Investigations Subcommittee of the Committee on Expenditures in Executive Departments, which held hearings on such matters as export control violations, for which Soviet spy William Remington was called in to testify; the trial of Nazi war criminal Ilse Koch; and the Mississippi Democratic Party&#x27;s sale of postal jobs, which Mississippians from rural areas attested to purchasing. On July 30, 1948, his committee heard testimony from ex-Soviet spy Elizabeth Bentley. Bentley testified before the House Un-American Activities Committee the next day, followed by Whittaker Chambers a few days later – setting off the Hiss Case, used by both Richard Nixon and Joseph McCarthy for their own political agendas.

Ferguson sponsored an anti-lynching bill, which was approved by the Senate Judiciary Committee in June 1949. The House of Representatives had approved several anti-lynching bills. Due to opposition from Southern Democrats, no anti-lynching bill was ever approved by the full Senate.

He introduced the Senate version of the bill that inserted &quot;under God&quot; into the Pledge of Allegiance in 1954. Michigan&#x27;s 17th congressional district United States House of Representatives Republican Charles G. Oakman had previously introduced a House version. The bill became law on Flag Day, June 14, 1954.

Also in 1954, Ferguson proposed several amendments to the Bricker Amendment.

==Later life==
Ferguson served as United States Ambassador to the Philippines from 1955 to 1956 and was judge of the United States Court of Military Appeals in Washington, D.C., from 1956 to until his retirement 1971. He served as senior judge on the United States Court of Military Appeals from 1971 to 1976.

In 1976, he retired and moved back to Michigan and resided in Grosse Pointe until his death in 1982.

Ferguson&#x27;s involvement behind the scenes in influencing the failed investigation, trial, and slander of Preston Tucker by the Securities and Exchange Commission has long been speculated. Lloyd Bridges portrayed Ferguson in the 1988 film &quot;&quot; in which Tucker was played by the elder actor&#x27;s son Jeff Bridges.

<doc id="729240" wikidata="Q2612161" url="?curid=729240" title="Woodlawn station (IRT Jerome Avenue Line)">
<text>The Woodlawn station (sometimes called Woodlawn–Jerome Avenue station) is the northern terminal of the New York City Subway&#x27;s IRT Jerome Avenue Line. The station is located at the intersection of Bainbridge and Jerome Avenues, outside Woodlawn Cemetery. Despite the station name, this intersection is in the Norwood neighborhood of the Bronx, and not in Woodlawn. It is served by the 4 train at all times. This station was constructed by the Interborough Rapid Transit Company as part of the Dual Contracts and opened in 1918.

Its opening helped spur the development of the area that had begun with the opening of nearby Woodlawn Cemetery. Following renovations in 2005, it was listed on the National Register of Historic Places for its use of ornamental concrete. A public art display of stained glass called &quot;Children at Play&quot; was also installed.

==History==
===Background===
In the 1840s, the Harlem Railroad made the first rail connection between Manhattan and what became the Woodlawn neighborhood, a connection that still exists via the Woodlawn station on what is now Metro-North Railroad&#x27;s Harlem Line. At that time, like much of the western Bronx, it was still rural and heavily farmed. Residential development did not start until after the opening of Woodlawn Cemetery in 1863. As a rural cemetery, at the time of its opening, it was as much a park as a burial ground, a popular place to visit for strolls and picnics. By the 1890s the surrounding neighborhood was well-populated with working-class Irish and Italian immigrants. Those residents had regularly been lobbying for a subway connection, which was constructed the Interborough Rapid Transit Company (IRT) was expanded via the Dual Contracts.

===Construction and opening===
The Dual Contracts, which were signed on March 19, 1913, were contracts for the construction and/or rehabilitation and operation of rapid transit lines in the City of New York. The contracts were &quot;dual&quot; in that they were signed between the City and two separate private companies (the Interborough Rapid Transit Company and the Brooklyn Rapid Transit Company), all working together to make the construction of the Dual Contracts possible. The Dual Contracts promised the construction of several lines in the Bronx. As part of Contract 3, the IRT agreed to build an elevated line along Jerome Avenue in the Bronx.

The first part of the line opened on June 2, 1917 as a shuttle service between Kingsbridge Road and 149th Street, in advance of through service to the IRT Lexington Avenue Line, which began on July 17, 1918. Woodlawn station opened on April 15, 1918 as part of the final extension of the IRT Jerome Avenue Line from Kingsbridge Road. This section was initially served by shuttle service, with passengers transferring at 167th Street. The construction of the line encouraged development along Jerome Avenue, and made surrounding areas desirable places for commuters to live, leading to their growth.

The station was named after Woodlawn Road, the former name of Bainbridge Avenue, but is most often associated with Woodlawn Cemetery, whose main entrance is just up the street. Woodlawn Road was renamed years ago, but the old name persists to this day on some signs. Woodlawn, though, became even more densely populated after the station opened. The cemetery, which had lobbied for a stop nearby, benefited as well. It opened a sales office to deal with the demand for burial plots. The subway&#x27;s connection to Harlem led to many Harlem Renaissance figures such as Duke Ellington and W. C. Handy being buried at Woodlawn. The city government took over the IRT&#x27;s operations on June 12, 1940.

===Later years===
The 1991 death of John McNalley at the station triggered an investigation into whether it could have been prevented. McNalley, in his 50s, had been reported as having difficulties as the train passed the Burnside Avenue station, six stops south. The train continued north; transit police were notified of the situation at Fordham Road. By the time paramedics were able to reach McNalley he had died from cardiac arrest. Transit police officers claimed that their calls to the Metropolitan Transportation Authority command center urging the train to be stopped were ignored. Their union president called for police to be given the authority to order a train stopped in an emergency.

In the mid-2000s, the station was renovated, as were others on the line. The second story was added above the mezzanine. Inside, the newsstand was restored. The station was listed on the National Register of Historic Places after it was renovated.

Albright&#x27;s work was installed in two stages. Albright, a Queens College graduate and city native who has been commissioned to do several public artworks in the city, is primarily a painter and muralist who focuses on everyday members of the community. &quot;Children at Play&quot; was her first work in glass, and she spent time at a Philadelphia glass fabricator to understand the process. She took much of her inspiration from watching her son and his friends play, and also visited the station&#x27;s vicinity extensively.

==Station layout==

The station has two tracks, one center island platform and two disused side platforms extending south, ending a short distance north of 213th Street. The tracks end at bumper blocks at the north end of the platforms. The station was formerly set up as a Spanish solution with alighting passengers using the side platforms and boarding passengers using the island platform in a style similar to the other Bronx IRT terminals. Now all passengers use the island platform. The 4 stops here at all times.

The station is located above Jerome Avenue just south of its oblique intersection with Bainbridge Avenue at that street&#x27;s northern end. Woodlawn Cemetery is on the east side of the street, and its main entrance and gatehouse are a block to the north of the station.

===Exterior===
Squire J. Vickers, the chief architect for the subway system, designed the station in 1917. The use of ornamental concrete was in keeping with his dictum that, in any location where an elevated subway line intersected a major boulevard or was close to a scenic asset such as a parkway, the structure should be sheathed in concrete. As a result, it serves as a visual focal point for the area and connects the commercial areas on either side of the street. Its interior is also decorated with the ceramic tilework that characterizes many of his stations above and below ground.

The Woodlawn station is built of steel frame faced in ornamental concrete, with a large headhouse at the northern end. Three large steel arches over Jerome Avenue support the mezzanine level. The tracks above them are supported by through girders with four half-inch () expansion joints at their intersection with the supporting members in order to mitigate stress to the concrete caused by vibrations from passing trains. Burlap coated in coal tar atop the girders provides a waterproof track floor.

The concrete surface of the platforms is smooth, in contrast to the rough bush-hammered finish preferred elsewhere on the IRT Dual System stations. Corrugated metal windscreens are located along the length of the side platforms, which have also been enclosed in plywood. The west side has been partially enclosed to serve as station rooms. They are covered in steel frame canopies with truss supports and wooden-slat gabled roofs and lit by fluorescent fixtures.

At the south end the platforms are open and lit by modern double lampposts. Just south of the island platform&#x27;s end is a pyramid-roofed original signal tower. There are other signal towers and service rooms, faced in corrugated metal, south of the other platforms. A flagman&#x27;s structure is beneath the north end of the island platform canopy.

===Interior===
The entrances are at the base of the stair towers. They are openings sheltered by a bracketed metal portico that echoes the station&#x27;s roof-line. Pedestrian traffic on the sidewalks can continue through.

Stairs lead up to the mezzanine, its interior faced in cream-colored brick. Fifteen stained glass panels in the five windows, depicting children playing against swirling, colorful backgrounds, comprise a work called &quot;Children at Play&quot; by Josie Gonzalez Albright. There is a newsstand and restrooms here.

Three separate flights of stairs lead up to the platform. Here, there is a dispatcher&#x27;s office and crew quarters in the tops of the stair towers. There is a turnstile bank and MetroCard machines.

===Exits===

The station&#x27;s only exits are at the very north end of all of the platforms, where the head house is. Two cubical concrete stair towers with corner piers are at either end of the head house, going down to either side of Jerome Avenue at Bainbridge Avenue. The symmetrical windows on the west end are original nine-light casement windows; those on the east have been covered over or replaced. All are flanked with a narrow, wide-silled window similar to those on the north facade. Piers are at the corners. Murals with patriotic themes have been painted on the sides. At the top, below the gently pitched gabled roof in standing-seam metal, is a polychrome mosaic frieze above three recessed panels.

Between the towers is a two-story span. Its lower level, the mezzanine, is faced in concrete and divided into three sections divided by square pilasters. All have a recessed triple casement window; that in the central portion is flanked by two similar double windows. Traffic lights are mounted on the west side and western portion of the central section below window level. At the top of each pilaster is a mosaic tile. A smooth metal strip runs across the top. Above it is an apparent second story, sided in the vertical plywood that shelters the platform. It is recessed slightly from the mezzanine, with its fenestration echoing that below.

<text>The Mosholu Parkway station is a local station on the IRT Jerome Avenue Line of the New York City Subway. Located at the intersection of Mosholu Parkway and Jerome Avenue in the Bedford Park and Norwood neighborhoods of the Bronx, it is served by the 4 train at all times.

This station was constructed by the Interborough Rapid Transit Company as part of the Dual Contracts and opened in 1918. It was renovated between 2006 and 2007, and further renovations are planned to add elevators, making the station compliant with the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990.

==History==
===Construction and opening===

The Dual Contracts, which were signed on March 19, 1913, were contracts for the construction and/or rehabilitation and operation of rapid transit lines in the City of New York. The contracts were &quot;dual&quot; in that they were signed between the City and two separate private companies (the Interborough Rapid Transit Company and the Brooklyn Rapid Transit Company), all working together to make the construction of the Dual Contracts possible. The Dual Contracts promised the construction of several lines in the Bronx. As part of Contract 3, the IRT agreed to build an elevated line along Jerome Avenue in the Bronx.

The first part of the line opened on June 2, 1917 as a shuttle service between Kingsbridge Road and 149th Street, in advance of through service to the IRT Lexington Avenue Line, which began on July 17, 1918. Mosholu Parkway station opened on April 15, 1918 as part of the final extension of the IRT Jerome Avenue Line from Kingsbridge Road to Woodlawn. This section was initially served by shuttle service, with passengers transferring at 167th Street. The construction of the line encouraged development along Jerome Avenue, and led to the growth of the surrounding communities. The city government took over the IRT&#x27;s operations on June 12, 1940. On October 23, 1952, a motorman died when his empty train collided with another empty train at the station.

===Later years===
In 2006, work began on a $55 million contract to renovate five stops on the line to bring them into a state of good repair. As part of the project, station mezzanines were refurbished, electrical upgrades were completed, and platform floors, canopy roofs, and windscreens were replaced. In addition, fluorescent lighting was installed. Work on the project was completed in phases so as to reduce inconveniences to riders. On October 30, 2006, the northbound platform at Mosholu Parkway closed for three months to be renovated. Work on the southbound platform was to begin in summer 2007. As part of the project, the southern entrance to the station was reopened.

From June 8, 2009 to June 26, 2009, four morning rush-hour trains operated express in the southbound direction in a pilot program by New York City Transit, stopping at Burnside Avenue and 149th Street–Grand Concourse before resuming the normal express route at 125th Street. Although Mosholu Parkway is not designed as an express station, the trains used a switch for the express track south of the station. From October 26, 2009 to December 11, 2009, a second pilot program had five southbound 4 trains running express in the AM rush hour.

In May 2018, New York City Transit Authority President Andy Byford announced his plan subway and bus modernization plan, known as Fast Forward, which included making an additional 50 stations compliant with the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 during the 2020–2024 Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA) Capital Program to allow most riders to have an accessible station every two or three stops. The draft 2020–2024 Capital Program released in September 2019, included 66 stations that would receive ADA improvements, including Mosholu Parkway. In November 2022, the MTA announced that it would award a $965 million contract for the installation of 21 elevators across eight stations, including Mosholu Parkway which will receive 2 brand new elevators (1 street-to-mezzanine-to-northbound platform outside fare control and 1 mezzanine-to-southbound platform inside fare control). A joint venture of ASTM and Halmar International would construct the elevators under a public-private partnership.

==Station layout==
This elevated station has three tracks and two side platforms. The 4 stops here at all times. The middle track, which starts just north of the station, is generally not used in revenue service. South of this station is a track connection from Jerome Yard to all three tracks in the southbound direction only. A renovation removed two mosaics on each platform and opened the portion of the station&#x27;s walls that span the parkway.

===Exits===
The station has two mezzanines located underneath the platforms, on the north and south sides of Mosholu Parkway between its service roadways. The mezzanines are made of brick. Station exits from each mezzanine lead to either side of Jerome Avenue.

<doc id="729245" wikidata="Q312176" url="?curid=729245" title="Johann Vogel (footballer)">
<text>Johann Louis François Vogel (born 8 March 1977) is a Swiss former professional footballer who played as a midfielder. He spent much of his professional career with Grasshopper Club Zürich and PSV. In his later career, he played for A.C. Milan, Betis, and Blackburn Rovers before returning to Grasshoppers. At international level, he amassed 94 caps scoring twice for the Switzerland national team.

==Club career==

===Early career===
Born in Geneva, to German father, and Swiss mother, Vogel joined Swiss amateur club FC Meyrin in his youth, but made the cut into professional football by joining Grasshopper Club Zürich. In his time at Grasshoppers, he usually played central defence or rightback although on occasion, he could be called to feature in a central defensive midfield role.

In his role as a defensive midfield player, in which he uses his ability to pass accurately and to effectively retain possession of the ball, Vogel can be counted on to add depth to either defence or attack.

===PSV and AC Milan===
Dutch club PSV sought his services in 1999 and he became a prominent member of the team until he decided to leave to join A.C. Milan at the end of the 2004–05 season. In his final season with PSV, he was noted for forming a formidable midfield partnership with Mark van Bommel and Phillip Cocu where the club managed to reach the semi-finals of the Champions League tournament.

===Real Betis===
On 31 August 2006, he joined Real Betis in an exchange deal for Ricardo Oliveira. Vogel made his Betis debut against Athletic Bilbao on 10 September 2006 at the Manuel Ruiz de Lopera, which Betis won 3–0.

Vogel made his last La Liga appearance for Betis on 19 May 2007 against Tarragona. On 27 December 2007, he agreed to leave Betis after suing them.

Everton confirmed they were in talks to sign the player after being told he could leave his then club Real Betis in July 2007. However the deal hit problems due to Real Betis wanting payment for him.

===Blackburn Rovers===
On 18 March 2008, he agreed a two-and-a-half-year contract (with Blackburn having an option for a further year) with Mark Hughes&#x27; Blackburn Rovers. Vogel joined fellow Swiss footballers Stéphane Henchoz and Bruno Berner at Ewood Park, as well as his former PSV-colleague André Ooijer. After receiving International clearance to play for Blackburn Rovers on 25 March, he was given the number 8 shirt by Mark Hughes, the shirt vacated by Robbie Savage after his move to Derby County.

Vogel made his debut for Rovers on 5 April against Tottenham Hotspur.

However, in the 2008–09 season, Vogel found himself frozen out at Ewood Park. He came on as a substitute in a 3–1 defeat by Liverpool.

On 7 April 2009, his contract was terminated by Blackburn Rovers with immediate effect and by mutual consent.
After that, he announced his retirement from professional football.

===Grasshoppers comeback===
Two and a half years after his retirement, Vogel decided to return to the field again. He made comeback with Grasshoppers where he made his professional debut and appeared in the starting line-up against FC Thun on 5 February 2012. After appearing in another two league matches, he retired for the second time.

==International career==
Vogel made his debut for Switzerland on 8 March 1995 in a 1–1 draw against Greece. Vogel has played in Euro 1996, Euro 2004, 2006 World Cup and has made 94 appearances in total for his country. He scored his first goal on 10 March 1999 in a friendly against Austria.

Until 8 March 2007, he was the captain of Switzerland.

<text>Pterophyllum altum, also referred to as the altum angelfish, deep angelfish, or Orinoco angelfish, occurs strictly in the Orinoco River Basin and the Upper Rio Negro watershed in Southern Venezuela, Southeastern Colombia and extreme Northern Brazil.

==Description==
The species is the largest member in its genus and specimens may have a height (from tip of dorsal to tip of anal fin) of as much as . Its natural base color is silver but with three brownish/red vertical stripes and red striations into the fins. The species may show red spotting and a blueish green dorsal overcast when mature and when aroused exhibits a black operculum spot. Characteristic of this species is an acute incision or notch above the nares (supraorbital indention). All true Orinoco altum specimens show this trait. The true wildcaught Orinoco altum is very difficult to breed in captivity. Most altum angelfish are more frequently found in the well oxygenated, extremely soft waters of Upper and Middle Orinoco tributaries shed from the Guiana Shield Highlands, preferring a pH range between 4.5 and 5.8. These are very transparent blackwaters with almost nil conductivity. Temperature range in these waters is between . They are also found in the Atabapo River and Inirida River floodplain, down the Casiquiare and Guainía floodplain where the Rio Negro is born, before entering Brazilian territory. Unlike &quot;P. scalare&quot; which prefer to spawn on the submerged leaves of plants and trees in the flooded rainforest, &quot;P. altum&quot; prefers to spawn on submerged roots and tree branches in a moderate water current. This species is recommended for intermediate to advanced aquarists due to the detailed maintenance it requires for proper health.

True Orinoco Altums are usually only available in aquarium shops from late summer until early winter due to the fact that their native river system&#x27;s water level is only low enough to allow for successful fishing from July to October.

<text>Pterophyllum leopoldi, also referred to as the teardrop angelfish, Leopold&#x27;s angelfish dwarf angelfish, or roman-nosed angelfish, is an angelfish species native to the Amazon River (between Manacapuru and Santarém), Essequibo River and Rupununi River.

It is distinguished from other members of the genus &quot;Pterophyllum&quot; by the absence of a pre-dorsal notch, and by the presence of a black blotch at the dorsal insertion on the 4th vertical bar.

The species is frequently misidentified as &quot;P. dumerilii&quot; when it is imported in the aquarium trade. &quot;P. leopoldi&quot; is the smallest of the angelfish species, reaching a length of SL and a height of SL.

The specific name honours King Leopold III of Belgium, who sponsored the expedition to the Amazon that collected the type of this species.

<text>The Bedford Park Boulevard–Lehman College station (formerly Bedford Park Boulevard–200th Street station) is a local station on the IRT Jerome Avenue Line of the New York City Subway. Located at the intersection of Bedford Park Boulevard (formerly 200th Street) immediately west of Jerome Avenue in the Bedford Park neighborhood of the Bronx, it is served by the 4 train at all times. It is also the only station on the Jerome Avenue Line north of 170th Street that is not located above Jerome Avenue. This station was constructed by the Interborough Rapid Transit Company as part of the Dual Contracts and opened in 1918.

== History ==

===Construction and opening===

The Dual Contracts, which were signed on March 19, 1913, were contracts for the construction and/or rehabilitation and operation of rapid transit lines in the City of New York. The contracts were &quot;dual&quot; in that they were signed between the City and two separate private companies (the Interborough Rapid Transit Company and the Brooklyn Rapid Transit Company), all working together to make the construction of the Dual Contracts possible. The Dual Contracts promised the construction of several lines in the Bronx. As part of Contract 3, the IRT agreed to build an elevated line along Jerome Avenue in the Bronx. In April 1915, the New York Public Service Commission voted to change the planned name of the station from 200th Street to Bedford Park Boulevard.

The first part of the line opened on June 2, 1917 as a shuttle service between Kingsbridge Road and 149th Street, in advance of through service to the IRT Lexington Avenue Line, which began on July 17, 1918. Bedford Park Boulevard–200th Street station opened on April 15, 1918 as part of the final extension of the IRT Jerome Avenue Line from Kingsbridge Road to Woodlawn. This section was initially served by shuttle service, with passengers transferring at 167th Street. The construction of the line encouraged development along Jerome Avenue, and led to the growth of the surrounding communities. The city government took over the IRT&#x27;s operations on June 12, 1940.

===Later years===
This station was renovated in the Summer–Fall 2006. During this time, the street level mezzanine area and the platforms were renovated. The platforms had yellow tactile edge warning strips installed, and the IRT directional tablets inside fare control have been preserved. Until the 2006 renovation, the downtown platform had several old small 200 signs behind a chain-link fence toward the front of the platform; however, they were removed.

Until renovations in 2006, it was the only station in the entire subway system and along the IRT Jerome Avenue Line to have a barbed wire fence on a platform–the Manhattan bound platform. This was added in an earlier renovation from the 1980s with the intent of preventing graffiti artists from tagging the 4 train. The barbed wire fence was completely removed from the Manhattan-bound platform during renovations.

From October 26, 2009 to December 11, 2009, a pilot program had five southbound 4 trains running express in the AM rush hour. Although Bedford Park Boulevard is not designed as an express station, the trains used a switch for the express track south of the station.

==Station layout==
The elevated station has three tracks and two side platforms. The 4 stops here at all times.

The middle track is generally not used in revenue service. The Jerome Yard/Concourse Yard complex is located on the west of the station. The track connections to Jerome Yard are at the north end. Concourse Yard has a single track connected to the southbound local; south of the station. The Concourse Yard serves as one of the few interconnections between the IRT and IND divisions.

===Exits===
The station building is at street level with the tracks above the building due to the street layout. The station has a brick mezzanine and stairway walls with &quot;BPB&quot; and restroom mosaics in the station house. A storeroom is located on the landing of the stairs to the platforms. Walking to the east connects to the New York Botanical Garden and a Metro-North Railroad station of the same name, and walking to the west around the yard complex connects to Lehman College and the Bronx High School of Science.

Kingsbridge Road station opened as the northern terminal of the initial section of the line on June 2, 1917. Service was initially operated as a shuttle between Kingsbridge Road and 149th Street, and only the southbound platform was in use at this station. Through service to the IRT Lexington Avenue Line began on July 17, 1918. This station ceased to be the terminal of the line with the opening of the final extension to Woodlawn on April 15, 1918.

===Later years===
In May 2018, New York City Transit Authority President Andy Byford announced his plan subway and bus modernization plan, known as Fast Forward, which included making an additional 50 stations compliant with the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 during the 2020–2024 Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA) Capital Program to allow most riders to have an accessible station every two or three stops. The draft 2020–2024 Capital Program released in September 2019 included 66 stations that would receive ADA improvements. In December, the MTA announced that an additional twenty stations, including Kingsbridge Road, would be made ADA-accessible as part of the Capital Program. In May 2024, the Federal Transit Administration awarded the MTA $157 million for accessibility renovations at five stations, including Kingsbridge Road. The funds would be used to add elevators, signs, and public-announcement systems, as well as repair platforms and stairs, at each station.

==Station layout==

The station has three tracks and two side platforms. The 4 stops here at all times. The middle track is generally not used in revenue service. It is a typical IRT elevated station. The Kingsbridge Armory rises immediately to the west of the station.

===Exits===
The station has a wooden mezzanine under the tracks. Exit stairs go to both northern corners of Jerome Avenue and Kingsbridge Road. There are two stairs to the northeast corner and two to the northwest.

<text>The Culinary Institute of America (CIA) is a private culinary school with its main campus in Hyde Park, New York, and branch campuses in St. Helena and Napa, California; San Antonio, Texas; and Singapore. The college, which was the first to teach culinary arts in the United States, offers associate, bachelor&#x27;s, and master&#x27;s degrees, and has the largest staff of American Culinary Federation Certified Master Chefs. The CIA also offers continuing education for professionals in the hospitality industry as well as conferences and consulting services. The college additionally offers recreational classes for non-professionals. The college operates student-run restaurants on its four U.S. campuses.

The school was founded in 1946 in New Haven, Connecticut, as a vocational institute for returning veterans of World War II. With a growing student body, the school purchased a former Jesuit novitiate in Hyde Park in 1970, which remains its central campus. The school began awarding associate degrees in 1971, bachelor&#x27;s degrees in 1993, and master&#x27;s degrees in 2018. Additional campuses were opened in the following years: St. Helena in 1995, Texas in 2008, Singapore in 2010, and Napa in 2016.

== History ==
The New Haven Restaurant Institute was founded by New Haven attorney Frances Roth and Katharine Angell on May 22, 1946 in New Haven, Connecticut as a vocational training school for returning World War II veterans. It was the first culinary college in the United States. With assistance from Yale University, the school purchased the Davies mansion in New Haven&#x27;s Prospect Hill neighborhood. The first class consisted of sixteen students and the faculty included a dietitian, a baker, and a chef. In 1947 the school was renamed the Restaurant Institute of Connecticut to reflect its growing repute; the school&#x27;s name was changed again to the Culinary Institute of America in 1951.

Enrollment grew to approximately 1,000 students by 1969, beyond the capacity of its original campus, so the school purchased the St. Andrew-on-Hudson Jesuit novitiate in Hyde Park, New York in 1970. In 1971, the college began awarding associate degrees, and opened its doors in Hyde Park in the following year. From 1974 to 1979, the school built three residence halls, a culinary library, a career planning center, and a learning resources center. From 1982 to 1984, the American Bounty and Caterina de&#x27; Medici Restaurants and St. Andrew&#x27;s Café opened. In 1984, the school&#x27;s continuing education center (later named the J. Willard Marriott Education Center) opened, and the school improved its teaching kitchens and constructed an experimental kitchen and food laboratory. In 1990, the school opened a baking and pastry facility, named two years later as the Shunsuke Takaki School of Baking and Pastry. In 1993, the school opened its Conrad N. Hilton Library and began offering bachelor&#x27;s degree programs. In 1995, the school&#x27;s first branch campus opened, the Culinary Institute of America at Greystone in St. Helena, California. In 1998, the Student Recreation Center was opened.The Apple Pie Bakery Café opened in 2000, and the Colavita Center opened the following year. More residence halls were built at the school&#x27;s Hyde Park campus in 2004. In 2005, Anton Plaza opened in Hyde Park while the Ventura Center for Menu Research and Development opened in St. Helena. The school&#x27;s third campus opened in 2008 in San Antonio. Two years later, the CIA opened a campus in Singapore consisting of a facility on the campus of Temasek Polytechnic.

In the course of the controversy, the school prevented the campus newspaper, &quot;La Papillote&quot;, from writing about the issue, which prompted its editor to resign. Administrators later apologized and reportedly allowed a full report in the paper&#x27;s next issue.

<doc id="729255" wikidata="Q313610" url="?curid=729255" title="Marcus Allbäck">
<text>Marcus Christian Allbäck (; born 5 July 1973) is a Swedish former professional footballer who played as a striker. He was known for his sharp finishing ability and represented clubs in Sweden, Denmark, Italy, the Netherlands, England, and Germany during a career that spanned between 1992 and 2009. A full international between 1999 and 2008, he won 74 caps for the Sweden national team and scored 30 goals. He represented Sweden at three UEFA European Championships (2000, 2004, and 2008) as well as two FIFA World Cups (2002 and 2006).

After his playing career he served as an assistant coach for the Sweden national team between 2009 and 2016.

==Club career==

=== Early career ===
Born in Gothenburg, Allbäck started his professional career with Örgryte IS. He then proceeded to have two modest loan stints abroad, with Lyngby Boldklub and A.S. Bari of Serie A, before rejoining his first club.

In 2000, he joined SC Heerenveen of the Eredivisie, before moving to Aston Villa for £2 million in 2002. He was not a regular for the Premier League club, due to Darius Vassell and Juan Pablo Ángel. At the end of his contract, he joined Hansa Rostock in the summer of 2004.

=== F.C. Copenhagen ===
In the summer of 2005, aged 32, Allbäck signed with F.C. Copenhagen. On 1 November 2006, he scored the winning goal in a 1–0 UEFA Champions League group stage game against Manchester United. In that match, he was also awarded the fans&#x27; Man of the Match award. 20 days later he also scored against S.L. Benfica at Estádio da Luz – a match lost 3–1. Allbäck scored again in the last group stage match against Celtic at Parken in a 3–1 win. After the final home game of the Danish Superliga 2006–07 season, he was presented with the fans&#x27; Player of the Year award, as the side emerged back-to-back champions, and the striker netted 11 league goals.

In August 2007, Allbäck scored a late away equaliser against Beitar Jerusalem in the second leg of the second round Champions League qualifier in extra time, to keep Copenhagen&#x27;s group stage dreams alive, although the side would eventually bow out to Benfica in the next round.

=== Return to Sweden and retirement ===
On 1 July 2008, Allbäck returned to Sweden and Örgryte, his third spell at the club.

On 14 December 2009, after Örgryte IS was relegated from Allsvenskan, Allbäck announced his retirement from football.

After Sweden&#x27;s victory against the Netherlands, it was official that Allbäck would participate in Örgryte&#x27;s next home game against Motala, He came on in the 69th minute but could not affect the game.

==International career==
Allbäck made his debut for the national side on 27 November 1999 in a friendly against South Africa.
He was selected for Sweden&#x27;s Euro 2000 squad, but was the only outfield player who did not play for Sweden in the tournament. By the 2002 FIFA World Cup, Allbäck had established himself in the starting line-up after an impressive display in the qualification. However, he had a disappointing tournament with no goals. At Euro 2004, the 2006 World Cup, and Euro 2008, Allbäck was mostly used as a substitute. 

On 20 June 2006, during the 2006 World Cup, Allbäck helped Sweden earn a 2–2 draw against England by netting their first goal. This goal by Allbäck was the 2000th goal scored in the history of the World Cup. On 6 September, he scored twice to help propel Sweden past visitors Liechtenstein 3–1 in the second of their 2008 European Championship qualifying matches.

On 6 June 2007, during Euro 2008 qualifiers, Allbäck scored a highly surreal goal against Iceland when an opponent, Ívar Ingimarsson, gave him the ball incorrectly thinking a free kick had been awarded.

After Sweden&#x27;s group stage exit from Euro 2008 (in which he played as a second-half substitute against Russia in Innsbruck), Allbäck announced that he would retire from the national team, ending his international career with 74 caps with 30 goals. 

Allbäck worked for SVT as a commentator during the FIFA Confederations Cup 2009 in South Africa.

==Post-playing career==
On 7 November 2009, Allbäck was named as the new assistant coach of the Sweden men&#x27;s national football team. He stepped down from this position in 2016, following Sweden&#x27;s disappointing Euro 2016 campaign. He started his career as a football agent later the same year.

<text>The Fordham Road station is a local station on the IRT Jerome Avenue Line of the New York City Subway. Located at the intersection of Fordham Road and Jerome Avenue in the University Heights and Fordham Heights neighborhoods of the Bronx, it is served by the 4 train at all times. This station was constructed by the Interborough Rapid Transit Company as part of the Dual Contracts and opened in 1917.

== History ==
The Dual Contracts, which were signed on March 19, 1913, were contracts for the construction and/or rehabilitation and operation of rapid transit lines in the City of New York. The contracts were &quot;dual&quot; in that they were signed between the city and two separate private companies (the Interborough Rapid Transit Company and the Brooklyn Rapid Transit Company), all working together to make the construction of the Dual Contracts possible. The Dual Contracts promised the construction of several lines in the Bronx. As part of Contract 3, the IRT agreed to build an elevated line along Jerome Avenue in the Bronx.

Fordham Road station opened as part of the initial section of the line to Kingsbridge Road on June 2, 1917. Service was initially operated as a shuttle between Kingsbridge Road and 149th Street. Through service to the IRT Lexington Avenue Line began on July 17, 1918. The line was completed with a final extension to Woodlawn on April 15, 1918. This section was initially served by shuttle service, with passengers transferring at 167th Street. The construction of the line encouraged development along Jerome Avenue, and led to the growth of the surrounding communities. The city government took over the IRT&#x27;s operations on June 12, 1940.

On July 5, 2004, this station, 170th Street, and 176th Street closed for four months so they could be renovated. As part of the project, new canopy roofs, walls, lighting, staircases, floors, and a public address system would be installed at each station.

==Station layout==

The station has three tracks and two side platforms. The middle track is generally not used in revenue service. The 4 stops here at all times.

The station has old style signs painted over and covered up with new style signs, and features new fare control railings as a crossunder.

===Exits===
The station has a wooden mezzanine under the tracks. Exit stairs go to all four corners of Jerome Avenue and Fordham Road. In addition, the station is ADA-accessible via an elevator at the southeast corner of the intersection.

<text>The 183rd Street station is a local station on the elevated IRT Jerome Avenue Line of the New York City Subway. Located at the intersection of 183rd Street and Jerome Avenue in the University Heights and Fordham Heights neighborhoods of the Bronx, it is served by the 4 train at all times. This station was constructed by the Interborough Rapid Transit Company as part of the Dual Contracts and opened in 1917.

==History==
===Construction and opening===

The Dual Contracts, which were signed on March 19, 1913, were contracts for the construction and/or rehabilitation and operation of rapid transit lines in the City of New York. The contracts were &quot;dual&quot; in that they were signed between the City and two separate private companies (the Interborough Rapid Transit Company and the Brooklyn Rapid Transit Company), all working together to make the construction of the Dual Contracts possible. The Dual Contracts promised the construction of several lines in the Bronx. As part of Contract 3, the IRT agreed to build an elevated line along Jerome Avenue in the Bronx.

183rd Street station opened as part of the initial section of the line to Kingsbridge Road on June 2, 1917. Service was initially operated as a shuttle between Kingsbridge Road and 149th Street. Through service to the IRT Lexington Avenue Line began on July 17, 1918. The line was completed with a final extension to Woodlawn on April 15, 1918. This section was initially served by shuttle service, with passengers transferring at 167th Street. The construction of the line encouraged development along Jerome Avenue, and led to the growth of the surrounding communities. The city government took over the IRT&#x27;s operations on June 12, 1940.

===Later years===
In 1995, as a result of budget crisis, the Metropolitan Transportation Authority considered a package of service reductions, including permanently closing the 183rd Street station, as well as two or three other stations citywide, due to its proximity to other stations.

Beginning on March 5, 2007, 183rd Street and Kingsbridge Road were closed for renovation as part of a $55 million contract to renovate five stops on the IRT Jerome Avenue Line. The other three stops in the contract (Burnside Avenue, Mosholu Parkway, and Bedford Park Boulevard) were already renovated before then. This work was completed in twelve weeks on May 21, about eight weeks ahead of schedule.

==Station layout==

The station has three tracks and two side platforms. The middle track is generally not used in revenue service. The 4 stops here at all times.

There are old style signs painted over and covered up with new style signs, and a crossunder exists within fare control.

The 2008 artwork here is called &quot;Many Trails&quot; by Jose Ortiz. It features laminated glass windows in the mezzanine of the western station house, depicting the cultural history of University Heights.

===Exits===
The station has a wooden mezzanine under the tracks. Outside of fare control, exits go to the northwest, southwest, and southeast corner of the staggered intersection of Jerome Avenue and 183rd Street.

<text>Mount Adams, elevation above sea level, is a mountain in New Hampshire, the second highest peak in the Northeast United States after its nearby neighbor, Mount Washington. Located in the northern Presidential Range, Mount Adams was named after John Adams, the second President of the United States. It was given this name on July 31, 1820. To the northeast is Mount Madison and to the southwest is Mount Jefferson. From the summit, Mount Washington can be seen directly to the south.

There are two major subsidiary peaks of Mount Adams: Mount Sam Adams and Mount Quincy Adams, named after John Adams&#x27; cousin, Revolutionary leader Samuel Adams, and son, President John Quincy Adams, respectively, and two minor sub-peaks, Abigail Adams (named for John Adams&#x27; wife Abigail) and Adams 5. The northern side of the mountain ridge is located in Low and Burbank&#x27;s Grant, and the end of Durand Ridge, and King Ravine, on the north side of Mount Adams are in the town of Randolph (formerly Durand). The entire south side of the mountain ridge is in Thompson and Meserve&#x27;s Purchase.

The Appalachian Trail traverses the col between Mount Adams and Mount Sam Adams on the Gulfside Trail. The Randolph Mountain Club (RMC) maintains the trails and several huts and shelters high on Mount Adams&#x27; north side, including &quot;The Perch&quot;, &quot;Crag Camp&quot;, &quot;The Log Cabin&quot;, and &quot;Gray Knob&quot;. A large network of hiking and climbing paths lead south to the huts and ridges from several parking areas located on U.S. Highway 2.

The Aetherius Society claims that Mount Adams is one of 19 &quot;holy mountains&quot; around the world.

==Climbing and recreation==
Mount Adams is a popular hiking and climbing destination for experienced and novice mountaineers alike. The mountain is climbed in all four seasons, although it is more often climbed from late spring through early fall. The peak is known to have dangerously erratic weather, especially in winter. There is a prominent sign just prior to the most exposed section of Mount Adams urging hikers to turn around at the first sign of inclement weather. 
Winter hiking anywhere in the White Mountains requires specialized equipment and skills, as severe storms can develop suddenly. High winds and low temperatures can combine to make winter conditions on Mount Adams approximately equal to the worst reported from Antarctica.

There are numerous direct routes to the summit of Mount Adams. All routes are considered either Class 1 or Class 2, involve about to each way, and gain approximately in elevation. 
One popular route on Adams year-round is the Valley Way, which connects with the Gulfside Trail and Lowe&#x27;s Path. The Air Line is considered the standard winter route on Mount Adams, as it is perhaps the most direct route to the summit. The route gains about in elevation over about from trailhead to summit. The last 1,000 feet of this route are extremely exposed, leaving mountaineers vulnerable to the storms known to frequent mountains in the Presidential Range.

Due to their relative proximity, Mount Adams and nearby Mount Madison are frequently climbed on the same day by mountaineers. A hike to both summits includes a round trip of about and cumulative elevation gain of more than . The route begins on the Valley Way, which brings hikers to the Madison Hut. From the Madison Hut, hikers can then access the summits of both Mount Madison and Mount Adams.

<text>Marek Heinz (born 4 August 1977) is a Czech former professional footballer who played as a striker.

==Career==

===Early career===
Heinz started his football career in his native Czech Republic, where he played for Lázně Bohdaneč and Sigma Olomouc before moving to Germany in 2000.

===Germany and international call-up===
Heinz headed to German side Hamburger SV in 2000, the same year making his first appearance for the senior team of the Czech Republic. A surplus to requirement under Kurt Jara midway through the 2002–03 season he joined Arminia Bielefeld for the remainder of the campaign. Heinz could not make himself a regular at Bielefeld, watching his side slumping to relegation from the Bundesliga. Having not been signed by Bielefeld and released by Hamburg, he returned to the Czech Republic in 2003.

===Return to the Czech Republic and Euro 2004===
Baník Ostrava signed Heinz in 2003 and the player enjoyed a fantastic run during 2003–04, leading Baník to the Czech title and ending up as top scorer of the Czech league himself, scoring 19 goals. He went on to play in Euro 2004, where the Czech Republic reached the semi-finals.

===Back to Germany===
Heinz moved back to Germany when Borussia Mönchengladbach signed him in August 2004, but he only stayed at Mönchengladbach for just over a year, as he headed to Turkish side Galatasaray in 2005.

In 2005, Heinz scored two crucial goals for his country and club. He first helped Galatasaray to a 4–1 win over rivals Trabzonspor in October, before he scored the all-important third goal against Finland which sent the Czechs into the 2006 World Cup held in Germany.

===France===
In September 2006, he signed a one-year contract with French side Saint-Étienne after being released by Galatasaray, hoping to finally making an impact at club level outside the Czech Republic. In August 2007, he signed with Nantes. On 30 September 2008, he moved to 1. FC Brno. After only one season Heinz left Brno, and on 29 June 2009 it was announced that he signed a one-year contract with Kapfenberger SV.

===Return to Olomouc===
Heinz returned to Olomouc in 2011, signing a two-year contract with the club. Despite playing 20 matches in his first season, Heinz played just seventeen minutes in one substitute appearance in the first half of his second season. In November 2012 manager Roman Pivarník announced Heinz was surplus to requirements and free to find another club. He joined second league 1. SC Znojmo on loan in January 2013 for the rest of the season.

<doc id="729269" wikidata="Q2195401" url="?curid=729269" title="Burnside Avenue station">
<text>The Burnside Avenue station is an express station on the IRT Jerome Avenue Line of the New York City Subway. Located at the intersection of Burnside and Jerome Avenues in the Morris Heights and University Heights neighborhoods of the Bronx, it is served by the 4 train at all times. It also serves as a rush hour short turn northern terminal for select 4 trains from Crown Heights–Utica Avenue.

This station was constructed by the Interborough Rapid Transit Company as part of the Dual Contracts and opened in 1917.

==History==
===Construction and opening===

The Dual Contracts, which were signed on March 19, 1913, were contracts for the construction and/or rehabilitation and operation of rapid transit lines in the City of New York. The contracts were &quot;dual&quot; in that they were signed between the City and two separate private companies (the Interborough Rapid Transit Company and the Brooklyn Rapid Transit Company), all working together to make the construction of the Dual Contracts possible. The Dual Contracts promised the construction of several lines in the Bronx. As part of Contract 3, the IRT agreed to build an elevated line along Jerome Avenue in the Bronx.

Burnside Avenue first opened as Burnside Avenue–New York University on June 2, 1917 as part of the initial section of the line to Kingsbridge Road on June 2, 1917. Service was initially operated as a shuttle between Kingsbridge Road and 149th Street. Through service to the IRT Lexington Avenue Line began on July 17, 1918. The line was completed with a final extension to Woodlawn on April 15, 1918. This section was initially served by shuttle service, with passengers transferring at 167th Street. The construction of the line encouraged development along Jerome Avenue, and led to the growth of the surrounding communities. The city government took over the IRT&#x27;s operations on June 12, 1940.

===Station renovations===
In 1973, New York University sold its Bronx campus located northwest of the station to the City University of New York in 1973. A year after the acquisition, in 1974, the station was renamed to Burnside Avenue–180th Street because 180th Street was used as another name for Burnside Avenue at the time. It would further be renamed Burnside Avenue in 1979.

In 1981, the Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA) listed the station as one of 69 stations in dire need of renovation. A renovation of the Burnside Avenue station was funded as part of the MTA&#x27;s 1980–1984 capital plan. The MTA received a $106 million grant from the Urban Mass Transit Administration in October 1983; most of the grant would fund the renovation of eleven stations, including Burnside Avenue. Among the things that were done to the station during that time included a painted orange platform edge in addition to the yellow platform edge that was originally on each platform. New, corrugated signposts were installed and spaced evenly on the platform; these bore the station name in white lettering against a black metal sign (the font used for the signs was Akzidenz-Grotesk; it was first used as the agency&#x27;s font prior to renovation).

The fencing around the entrances to the platforms from the mezzanine were painted black while the rest of the platforms, including a few mushroom shaped incandescent lampposts that were installed during the renovation and the fences around each of the four entrances, were painted red; most of the lampposts bore the 180th Street name. The original hand rails, as well as the original iron maidens were also painted yellow. Two fences that were at the south end of each platform retained their paint color; the one on the Woodlawn bound platform would later be replaced with a second Communication Room.

As early as 1996, the 180th Street name began to be retired on the uncovered parts of each platform by replacing the mushroom shaped incandescent lampposts with unpainted sodium vapor lampposts. By 1999, all of the lights in those areas were replaced with sodium vapor lampposts.
This station was renovated a second time from June 17 to October 16, 2006 as part of a $55 million project to renovate five stations (183rd Street, Kingsbridge Road, Bedford Park Boulevard and Mosholu Parkway being the other four) on the IRT Jerome Avenue Line, bringing them to a state of good repair. During this time, the mezzanine area and staircases received a facelift, while both platform canopies and the structural beams that hold each canopy were replaced and yellow tactile edge warning strips were installed. Also, the token booth in the mezzanine was reduced in size and relocated from directly facing the main turnstiles from the unpaid side of fare control to facing the Manhattan-bound stairs from behind the Woodlawn-bound stairs, also from the unpaid side of fare control.

In May 2018, New York City Transit Authority President Andy Byford announced his plan subway and bus modernization plan, known as Fast Forward, which included making an additional 50 stations compliant with the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 during the 2020–2024 MTA Capital Program to allow most riders to have an accessible station every two or three stops. The draft 2020–2024 Capital Program released in September 2019 included 66 stations that would receive ADA improvements. In December, the MTA announced that an additional twenty stations, including Burnside Avenue, would be made ADA-accessible as part of the Capital Program. The MTA received $254 million from the Federal Transit Administration in 2023 for accessibility upgrades to four subway stations, including the Burnside Avenue station. Work on new elevators began in December 2024.

<text>The 176th Street station is a local station on the IRT Jerome Avenue Line of the New York City Subway. Located at the intersection of 176th Street and Jerome Avenue in the Morris Heights neighborhood of the Bronx, it is served by the 4 train at all times. This station was constructed by the Interborough Rapid Transit Company as part of the Dual Contracts and opened in 1917.

== History ==

The Dual Contracts, which were signed on March 19, 1913, were contracts for the construction and/or rehabilitation and operation of rapid transit lines in the City of New York. The contracts were &quot;dual&quot; in that they were signed between the City and two separate private companies (the Interborough Rapid Transit Company and the Brooklyn Rapid Transit Company), all working together to make the construction of the Dual Contracts possible. The Dual Contracts promised the construction of several lines in the Bronx. As part of Contract 3, the IRT agreed to build an elevated line along Jerome Avenue in the Bronx.

176th Street station opened as part of the initial section of the line to Kingsbridge Road on June 2, 1917. Service was initially operated as a shuttle between Kingsbridge Road and 149th Street. Through service to the IRT Lexington Avenue Line began on July 17, 1918. The line was completed with a final extension to Woodlawn on April 15, 1918. This section was initially served by shuttle service, with passengers transferring at 167th Street. The construction of the line encouraged development along Jerome Avenue, and led to the growth of the surrounding communities. The city government took over the IRT&#x27;s operations on June 12, 1940.

On July 5, 2004, this station, 170th Street, and Fordham Road closed for four months so they could be renovated. As part of the project, new canopy roofs, walls, lighting, staircases, floors, and a public address system would be installed at each station.

==Station layout==

This elevated station has three tracks with two side platforms. The 4 stops here at all times.

The station has old style signs painted over and covered up with new style signs, and features new fare control railings as a crossunder.

The 2006 artwork here is called &quot;Reaching Out For Each Other&quot; by Juan Sánchez. It features stained glass windows on the platform windscreens and station house that each feature a hand as a central element to depict their use as a universal language.

===Exits===
The fare control is in a mezzanine below the tracks. Outside fare control, stairs lead to either southwest corner of Jerome Avenue and 176th Street.

<doc id="729277" wikidata="Q217038" url="?curid=729277" title="Māris Verpakovskis">
<text>Māris Verpakovskis (born 15 October 1979), is a Latvian retired professional footballer who played as a striker. He played for the Latvia national team at UEFA Euro 2004 and is the only Latvian player to score at the end stage of a major international football tournament.

==Club career==

===Latvia===
Born in Liepāja, Latvia, Verpakovskis started his career in hometown club FK Liepājas Metalurgs, for which he played from 1995 till 2001 and scored ten goals in 59 appearances. In 2001 Verpakovskis joined another Latvian side, Skonto Riga, where he scored 41 goals in 77 appearances. This period of time is known for being the peak of Verpakovskis&#x27;s career. His performances were being recognized by many top European clubs, and in the late 2003 he signed a contract with the Ukrainian top team Dynamo Kyiv.

===Dynamo Kyiv===
Soon after joining, Verpakovskis quickly earned his spot in starting 11, scoring five goals in 11 appearances. He scored his first UEFA Champions League goal against the Turkish club Trabzonspor, which helped Dynamo Kyiv qualify for the next round and later Verpakovskis also scored a goal against Real Madrid in the group stage, helping to earn a 2–2 draw in Kyiv. Verpakovskis scored a total of three goals in the Champions League. After being honored as the Dynamo Kyiv&#x27;s best player of 2004 by team fans his career slowly started to decline, majorly due to a conflict with Dynamo&#x27;s former coach Yozhef Sabo. From that time Verpakovkis had been loaned out for several onsecutive seasons, as his contract with Dynamo was still active.

===Loans===
In 2007 Verpakovskis made a promising move to Spain, after he was signed on a loan deal by Getafe. Amid high competition for a place in the starting line-up, Verpakovskis scored one goal in 13 appearances. Right after returning from Spain, Verpakovskis was loaned to HNK Hajduk Split from Croatia, along with his Dynamo team-mates Florin Cernat and Goran Sablić. Verpakovskis had a good season in Hajduk, scoring five goals in 18 appearances and played the key role in team&#x27;s victories. In early 2008 he suffered an injury and did not play for the remaining time of his loan at Hajduk Split. He made a short comeback to Kyiv during the summer of 2008. Verpakovskis was on a loan term with Spanish side Celta de Vigo for the 2008–09 season, playing eight league matches and scoring no goals. In 2009, Verpakovskis had to extend his contract with Dynamo Kyiv for two years and the Greek Super League club Ergotelis signed him on a two-year loan. During those two years Verpakovskis played 46 league games and scored seven goals for the club. After the season, in 2011, his loan spell ended and he returned to Kyiv.

===FK Baku===
In 2011 Verpakovskis signed a contract with Azerbaijan Premier League club FC Baku for one season with an option to extend it for another one alongside his international team-mate Deniss Ivanovs. In his first season there Verpakovskis scored three goals in 19 league matches and it was decided by the club&#x27;s board that the contract would be extended for another season. Verpakovskis renewed his contract in June 2012. The next season was not successful for the Latvian international as he saw himself lose the place in the starting eleven, making only eight league appearances and scoring no goals. Despite scoring two goals and helping Baku grab a 3–1 victory over Sumgayit FK in the 1/8 finals of the Azerbaijan Cup on 28 November 2012, Verpakovskis left the club in January 2013.

===Ergotelis===
On 30 January 2013, rumours in the Greek and Latvian media appeared that Verpakovskis could rejoin the Greek Football League club Ergotelis. This information was officially confirmed by the club and the player one day later - on 31 January 2013. Verpakovskis made his return debut for the club on 20 February 2013 in a league match against Doxa Drama. On 29 April 2013, Verpakovskis scored both goals in his club&#x27;s 2–0 league victory over Olympiacos Volou. Verpakovskis then scored in the last match of the season on 26 May 2013 to secure a 1–1 draw against Niki Volos. This goal and point secured Ergotelis a return to the Super League Greece. Verpakovskis made his Super League return debut on 26 August 2013 in a 2–0 victory over Levadiakos. He scored his first goal since return to the Superliga on 2 November 2013 in a 2–1 loss to P.A.O.K. On 10 November 2013, Verpakovskis scored for the second consecutive Superliga match, helping Ergotelis secure a 3–1 victory over Panthrakikos. In mid-season, January 2014, Verpakovskis informed Ergotelis that he was planning to retire in order to return to Latvia and jointly participate in establishment of a new football club in his local city Liepāja after the city&#x27;s former club Liepājas Metalurgs had been dissolved. On 27 January 2014, he played his last match for Ergotelis as the club lost 1–0 to Panetolikos with Verpakovskis coming on as a late match substitute. After the game Verpakovskis was honoured by his teammates and the club&#x27;s staff with the president Giannis Daskalakis handing him a special &quot;Verpakovskis&quot; jersey of Ergotelis and stating that &quot;Ergotelis will be Verpakovskis&#x27; team for life and Heraklion is the place where Māris can always find his second family.&quot; Over one and a half season in Greece Verpakovskis had participated in 28 league matches and scored five goals. In a later interview Verpakovskis revealed that he had wished to finish the season in Greece but due to the limited time for establishment of a club he was forced to return to Latvia as soon as possible.

===FK Liepāja===
On 23 January 2014, the establishment of the newly founded Latvian Higher League club FK Liepāja was officially announced, and following his return from Greece Verpakovkis took office as the club&#x27;s president. Besides the administrative work he still retains an active player&#x27;s status. During the 2014 season Verpakovskis appeared in nine league matches and scored one goal. He left the club in November 2018.

===FK RFS===
A few days after leaving FK Liepāja, Verpakovskis was hired as director of football at FK RFS. It was confirmed on 25 November 2018.

On 31 May 2019, Verpakovskis played a game for FC Caramba Riga, playing 45 minutes and scoring a goal in a 4–0 victory, helping the team to reach the second leg of the Latvian Cup.

==International career==
Verpakovskis made his debut for the Latvia national team on 9 September 1999 in a 2–1 victory over Greece, scoring in that match. He rose to international prominence as the highest goalscorer for Latvia in their successful UEFA Euro 2004 qualification campaign, with six goals in ten matches. He scored once for Latvia in Euro 2004 and nearly scored what could have been a candidate for goal of the tournament against Germany, dribbling on a weaving run from the halfway line and beating four German players.

Verpakovskis was Latvia&#x27;s top scorer in FIFA World Cup 2006 qualification, UEFA Euro 2008 qualification, as well as the FIFA World Cup 2010 qualification. In September 2013, Verpakovskis won his 100th cap for the Latvia national team in a 1–0 World Cup qualifying defeat to Greece. On 29 May 2014, Verpakovskis played his last international match as Latvia beat Estonia in the semi-finals of the 2014 Baltic Cup. He was symbolically substituted by Edgars Gauračs just 13 minutes into the game and honoured by his teammates, national team&#x27;s staff and supporters. After his retirement the national team&#x27;s manager Marians Pahars referred to Verpakovskis as &quot;a national team legend&quot;. All in all, internationally Verpakovskis has been capped 104 times for Latvia, scoring 29 goals. He is Latvia&#x27;s all-time best scorer.

<text>The 170th Street station is a local station on the IRT Jerome Avenue Line of the New York City Subway. Located at the intersection of 170th Street and Jerome Avenue in the Highbridge neighborhood of the Bronx, it is served by the 4 train at all times. This station was constructed by the Interborough Rapid Transit Company as part of the Dual Contracts and opened in 1917.

== History ==
===Construction and opening===
The Dual Contracts, which were signed on March 19, 1913, were contracts for the construction and/or rehabilitation and operation of rapid transit lines in the City of New York. The contracts were &quot;dual&quot; in that they were signed between the city and two separate private companies (the Interborough Rapid Transit Company and the Brooklyn Rapid Transit Company), all working together to make the construction of the Dual Contracts possible. The Dual Contracts promised the construction of several lines in the Bronx. As part of Contract 3, the IRT agreed to build an elevated line along Jerome Avenue in the Bronx.

170th Street station opened as part of the initial section of the line to Kingsbridge Road on June 2, 1917. Service was initially operated as a shuttle between Kingsbridge Road and 149th Street. Through service to the IRT Lexington Avenue Line began on July 17, 1918. The line was completed with a final extension to Woodlawn on April 15, 1918. This section was initially served by shuttle service, with passengers transferring at 167th Street. The construction of the line encouraged development along Jerome Avenue, and led to the growth of the surrounding communities. The city government took over the IRT&#x27;s operations on June 12, 1940.

===Station renovations===
On July 5, 2004, this station, 176th Street, and Fordham Road closed for four months so they could be renovated. As part of the project, new canopy roofs, walls, lighting, staircases, floors, and a public address system would be installed at each station.

As part of the 2015–2019 Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA) Capital Program, elevators were installed at the original entrance between the street and the mezzanine, as well as between the mezzanine and the platforms. The elevators make the station fully compliant with accessibility guidelines under the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990. Construction began in July 2020 and was completed in January 2022.

==Station layout==
This elevated station has three tracks and two side platforms. The 4 stops here at all times.

Both platforms have beige windscreens, mesh fences, and red canopies with green frames and support columns in the center, and white steel waist-level fences at either ends with white lampposts at regular intervals.

The 2005 artwork here is called &quot;Views from Above&quot; by Dina Bursztyn. It features stained glass windows on the platform windscreens and station house based on Bursztyn&#x27;s experience on riding elevated trains.

===Exits===
The station&#x27;s main entrance/exit is an elevated station house beneath the tracks. Inside the fare control area, it has two staircases to each platform at the center and a waiting area that allows a free transfer between directions. Outside fare control, it has a turnstile bank, a token booth, and three street stairs going down to either side of Jerome Avenue between 170th Street and Elliot Place, two to the east side and one to the west. The elevator goes to the east side of Jerome Avenue.

Each platform has a secondary fare control area leading to either northern corner of 170th Street and Jerome Avenue, with one staircase from the southbound platform going to the northwestern corner, and the other from the northbound platform going to the northeastern corner. The staircase from the southbound platform opened in January 2021, while the staircase from the northbound platform opened in April 2021.

<text>The Michigan State University College of Law (Michigan State Law or MSU Law) is the law school of Michigan State University, a public research university in East Lansing, Michigan. Established in 1891 as the Detroit College of Law, it was the first law school in the Detroit, Michigan area and the second in the state of Michigan. In October 2018, the college began a process to fully integrate into Michigan State University, changing from a private to a public law school. The integration with Michigan State University was finalized on August 17, 2020.

The college is nationally ranked tied for No.108 by &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot; out of 196 ABA approved schools. In the 2024, Washington &amp; Lee School of Law ranking of law reviews, the &quot;Michigan State Law Review&quot; was ranked 59th among “flagship” print American law journals with a score of 18.11 out of 100 and, per W&amp;L Law, the journal is ranked 68th among all student-edited, print, English law journals,

For the class entering in 2023, the school had a 39.37% acceptance rate, 35.37% of those accepted enrolled, and entering students had a median LSAT score of 159 and a median undergraduate GPA of 3.55.

For the 2023 graduating class, 69.59% of graduates obtained full-time, long-term bar-passage-required employment (&quot;i.e.,&quot; employment as attorneys), and 13.92% were not employed part- or full-time in any capacity, within 10 months after graduation.

Notable alumni include current Governor of Michigan Gretchen Whitmer, current Michigan Supreme Court Chief Justice Elizabeth T. Clement, former Michigan Supreme Court Justice and former mayor of Detroit Dennis Archer, former Michigan Supreme Court Justice and former United States federal judge George Clifton Edwards Jr., former Michigan gubernatorial candidate Geoffrey Fieger, former Michigan Senate majority leader and former U.S. Representative Mike Bishop, and former mayor of East Lansing Mark Meadows.

==History==
=== Detroit College of Law ===
Detroit College of Law opened in 1891 with 69 students and was incorporated in 1893. Among the first class of students to graduate were a future circuit judge and an ambassador. It was the oldest continuously operating independent law school in the United States until it was assimilated by MSU in 1995. The college was affiliated with the Detroit Young Men&#x27;s Christian Association (YMCA).

In 1937, the school broke ground and relocated to a new building at 130 East Elizabeth Street in Detroit, where it stayed until 1997. The Building was designed by architect George DeWitt Mason. It had been located at the former Detroit College of Medicine building on St. Antoine Street from 1892 to 1913; and the Detroit &quot;YMCA&quot; building from 1913 to 1924; the ground on which the building stood was under a 99-year lease from the YMCA. The last location of the Detroit College of Law in Downtown Detroit is commemorated by a plaque at Comerica Park, the home stadium of the Detroit Tigers baseball team, which now occupies the site.

=== Affiliation with Michigan State University===
The college became affiliated with Michigan State University in 1995. It relocated to East Lansing in 1997, when its 99-year lease with the Detroit YMCA expired, and the original building was demolished to make way for Comerica Park. The newly located college was called &quot;Detroit College of Law at Michigan State University&quot;. In April 2004, the school changed its name to the MSU College of Law, becoming more closely aligned academically with MSU. MSU Law is currently fully integrated as a constituent college of the university: academically, financially, and structurally.
Joan Howarth began her deanship at Michigan State University College of Law on July 1, 2008 and was the first female dean in MSU Law&#x27;s 117-year history. Beforehand, she was a professor at the William S. Boyd School of Law at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas, since 2001. She retired at the end of the 2015-16 school year. Lawrence Ponoroff became the Dean in the fall of 2016, and he served in that role until the end of December 2019. On October 26, 2018, MSU&#x27;s board of directors voted to fully integrate the College of Law into the University, thereby completing its transition from a private, independent institution to a public law school. The full integration was undertaken in order to facilitate collaboration between the law school and other divisions of MSU.

Melanie B. Jacobs, professor of law, was then appointed as the law college&#x27;s interim dean, beginning in January 2020 and under her tenure, the integration of the College of Law into the University was completed on August 17, 2020. On June 1, 2021, Linda Sheryl Greene became Dean and MSU Foundation Professor of Law, and was the Inaugural Dean of the College of Law. Dean Greene (a leading scholar in sports law) was previously the Evjue-Bascom Professor of Law at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. Dean Greene stepped down as dean in January 2024, since which Michael Sant&#x27;Ambrogio has served as interim dean.

==Admissions==
For the class entering in 2023, MSU Law accepted 39.37% of applicants, with 35.37% of those accepted enrolling. The average enrollee had a 159 LSAT score and 3.55 undergraduate GPA.

== Academic programs ==

MSU Law also houses the Center for Law, Technology &amp; Innovation (CLTI), formerly named the ReInvent Law Program, and LegalRnD; the Indigenous Law &amp; Policy Center (ILPC); the Geoffrey N. Fieger Trial Practice Institute (TPI); and The Indigenous Law Program.

==Academic journals and publications==
Law journals at the law school are nationally ranked and include: 
* &quot;Michigan State Law Review&quot;, the school&#x27;s flagship journal, ranked 99th among American law school journals with a score of 14.55 out of 100 as ranked by Washington and Lee University School of Law in 2022.
* &quot;Michigan State International Law Review&quot; 
* &quot;Animal and Natural Resource Law Review&quot;

Additionally, the school also publishes &quot;Spartan Lawyer&quot;, the law college&#x27;s bi-annual magazine. Formerly, the school published the &quot;Journal of Business &amp; Securities Law&quot;.

==Bar examination passage==
In 2022, the overall bar examination passage rate for the law school’s first-time examination takers was 77.46%. The Ultimate Bar Pass Rate, which the ABA defines as the passage rate for graduates who sat for bar examinations within two years of graduating, was 88.26% for the class of 2020.

==Employment==

<doc id="729282" wikidata="Q107076" url="?curid=729282" title="Torsten Frings">
<text>Torsten Klaus Frings (born 22 November 1976) is a German former footballer and manager, who last managed SV Meppen.

A former midfielder, throughout his career he played for several German clubs, namely Alemannia Aachen, Werder Bremen, Borussia Dortmund, and Bayern Munich, before ending his career with Canadian MLS side Toronto FC. At international level, he played 79 matches for the Germany national team since his debut in 2001, and represented his nation at two European Championships and two FIFA World Cups.

==Club career==
===Early career===
His professional career began at third division Alemannia Aachen before a move to Werder Bremen in 1996–97, helping the Weserstadion outfit to a German Cup final defeat of Bayern Munich in 1999 and tallying more than 160 Bundesliga appearances and 15 goals over five and a half seasons. He also helped them win the 1998 UEFA Intertoto Cup, scoring the decisive goal in the final against FK Vojvodina.

===Borussia Dortmund===
In 2002, a number of Europe&#x27;s leading clubs were on Frings&#x27;s trail prior to the World Cup but he opted for a four-year deal with Borussia Dortmund for a reported fee of €10 million, penning the contract two games into the competition. A regular in his first term at the Westfalenstadion, Frings also played 12 times in the UEFA Champions League, scoring home and away against Lokomotiv Moscow.

Frings&#x27;s 2003–04 season only began on 30 January when he played against Schalke 04, his first game since damaging his knee against VfL Bochum in July. He took over from Tomáš Rosický in the playmaking role and scored four times in 16 games before signing a three-year contract with Dortmund&#x27;s rivals, Bayern Munich.

===Bayern Munich===
Despite winning the domestic double with Bayern and making 29 Bundesliga and ten Champions League appearances, Frings never really enjoyed his football in Munich, and was played out of position by coach Felix Magath.

===Werder Bremen===

In June 2005, he rejoined Bremen for an undisclosed fee on a three-year deal, helping them past FC Basel into the Champions League group stage.

===Toronto FC and retirement===

On 29 June 2011, it was announced that Frings had reached an agreement to join Major League Soccer team Toronto FC as a designated player. During the press conference in which Frings was presented to the Toronto media, the club also announced the signing of Danny Koevermans. Frings made his debut for Toronto on 20 July 2011 in a 1–0 home defeat to FC Dallas. On 29 July 2011, Frings made his CONCACAF Champions League debut against Real Estelí in which he was given the honour of wearing the captain&#x27;s armband for Toronto. Frings became the permanent captain of the club following Maicon Santos&#x27;s transfer to Dallas.

On 27 June 2012, Frings scored his first MLS goal in a 3–0 away victory over Montreal Impact, blasting a free kick in the 52nd minute from 22 yards out.

Frings missed the latter portion of the 2012 season after sustaining a hip injury which required arthroscopic surgery. Frings’ subsequent recovery progressed slower than expected, ultimately leading to his decision to retire from football in February 2013.

Club president, Kevin Payne indicated that the team wanted to maintain a relationship with Frings &quot;not just for next season, but for seasons to come.&quot; Frings himself said he wanted to return to the game as a coach.

==International career==
Frings represented Germany at the 2002 FIFA World Cup in Japan and South Korea, where the German team reached the final, only to be defeated 2–0 by Brazil. During the tournament, he was part of a controversial call when he prevented a goal with his hand on the goal line in the quarter-final match against the United States; the referee deemed the handball involuntary, however. Frings also took part at UEFA Euro 2004 and at the 2005 FIFA Confederations Cup on home soil, winning a bronze medal in the latter tournament.

Frings was later also called up to Germany&#x27;s squad for the 2006 FIFA World Cup on home soil. On 9 June 2006, Frings scored Germany&#x27;s fourth goal in a 4–2 win against Costa Rica in the opening match of the World Cup, with a powerful drive from more than 30 yards.

Following Germany&#x27;s penalty shootout victory over Argentina on 30 June 2006, Frings was fined and suspended by FIFA for two games (one of which is subject to a six-month probationary period) for his role in the brawl that broke out between the Argentine and German teams after the match. After reviewing video footage of the brawl, FIFA&#x27;s Disciplinary Committee determined that Frings had punched Argentine forward Julio Cruz and levelled punishment accordingly, even though Cruz himself had denied that Frings punched him; the second game of the suspension was made probationary due to the Committee&#x27;s determination that Frings had been provoked into fighting. This suspension decision, announced by FIFA only the day before Germany&#x27;s semi-final versus Italy on 4 July 2006, rendered Frings unavailable for the important match – which Germany subsequently lost; Germany finished the tournament in third place after defeating Portugal in the bronze medal match.

The controversy of the decision was also sparked by the fact that Frings&#x27; role in the brawl had been widely accentuated in the Italian media after FIFA had already announced it closed its investigations against German players. Frings answered to the accusations in an interview: &quot;This is all politics. The Argentinians attack us, I defend myself and the Italians get worked up. With this suspension, FIFA just wanted to show that Germany doesn&#x27;t get special treatment as the World Cup hosts.&quot;

Frings was also called up to Germany&#x27;s Euro 2008 squad, which reached the final of the tournament only to be defeated by Spain, but was later not included in the team for the 2010 World Cup by German coach Joachim Löw. He played his last international match on 11 February 2009 in a 0–1 home defeat against Norway. In total, he earned 79 caps for Germany.

==Style of play==
Frings was an all-action, well-rounded and versatile midfielder. He was capable of playing anywhere across the midfield, although he was most comfortable in the centre, running deep from his own team&#x27;s box to the opposition&#x27;s box, due to his work-rate, vision, solid first touch and passing with either foot, despite his lack of notable pace. He was usually deployed as defensive midfielder, however, where he excelled due to his tough tackling playing style. A large, tenacious and physically strong player, and a vocal presence on the pitch, he also excelled in the air and was capable of playing as a defender, as a centre-back or sweeper, due to his organisational abilities, knowledge of the game, and fighting spirit on the pitch. In addition to his defensive attributes, Frings was also known for his leadership on the pitch, as well as his explosive, powerful shot from distance.

==Coaching career==
===Werder Bremen===
After ending his playing career, Frings became a youth coach at Werder Bremen. Werder Bremen Ex-CEO Klaus Allofs stated that &quot;he can learn the coaching profession for us from the bottom up.&quot; On 25 October 2014, after Werder Bremen fired head coach Robin Dutt, Bremen youth coach Viktor Skrypnyk was appointed as the head coach with Florian Kohfeldt, Christian Vander, and Frings all amongst Skripnik&#x27;s coaching staff. He received a coaching license from the German FA after a 10-month coaching course in March 2015.

<text>The 167th Street station is a local station on the IRT Jerome Avenue Line of the New York City Subway. Located at the intersection of 167th Street and River Avenue in the Highbridge neighborhood of the Bronx, it is served by the 4 train at all times. This station was constructed by the Interborough Rapid Transit Company as part of the Dual Contracts and opened in 1917.

==History==

The Dual Contracts, which were signed on March 19, 1913, were contracts for the construction and/or rehabilitation and operation of rapid transit lines in the City of New York. The contracts were &quot;dual&quot; in that they were signed between the City and two separate private companies (the Interborough Rapid Transit Company and the Brooklyn Rapid Transit Company), all working together to make the construction of the Dual Contracts possible. The Dual Contracts promised the construction of several lines in the Bronx. As part of Contract 3, the IRT agreed to build an elevated line along Jerome Avenue in the Bronx.

167th Street station opened as part of the initial section of the line to Kingsbridge Road on June 2, 1917. Service was initially operated as a shuttle between Kingsbridge Road and 149th Street.

On July 1, 1918, trains on the Ninth Avenue El began stopping here, as they were extended from 155th Street, entering the Bronx via the Putnam Bridge, a now-demolished swing bridge immediately north of the Macombs Dam Bridge, to connect with the Jerome Avenue line between 161st Street and 167th Street.

Through service to the IRT Lexington Avenue Line began on July 17, 1918. The line was completed with a final extension to Woodlawn on April 15, 1918. This section was initially served by shuttle service, with passengers transferring at this station. The construction of the line encouraged development along Jerome Avenue, and led to the growth of the surrounding communities.

A new high exit turnstile entrance from the southern end of the northbound platform opened on October 6, 1931.

The city government took over the IRT&#x27;s operations on June 12, 1940. Also in 1940, the New York City Board of Transportation proposed that the IRT Ninth Avenue Line should be connected to the IRT Lenox Avenue Line near the current Harlem–148th Street station. However, the tunnel from Sedgwick Avenue to Anderson–Jerome Avenues was built to elevated-railway standards, whose &quot;open&quot; third rails were shorter than the subway&#x27;s &quot;covered&quot; third rails, as the &quot;open&quot; rails did not have any protective covers on top. This incompatibility prevented the connection from being built. Another issue was that the Ninth Avenue Line could not carry subway cars, it was only strong enough to carry the lighter elevated cars.

From 1940 to 1958, 167th Street served as a terminal for the last remnant of the Ninth Avenue Elevated operating from 155th Street (Polo Grounds) to 167th Street. On reaching 167th Street, trains would switch to the center track, change direction, and return to 155th Street on the downtown track. Service was eventually reduced to a single two-car train operating in both directions on the uptown track. In 1958, service was discontinued after the New York Giants left for San Francisco. From the southern end of the station, the ramps leading to the Ninth Avenue line structure can still be seen. These ramps end south of the southwest corner of River Avenue and 164th Street, between Gate 8 and the 164th Street parking garage at Yankee Stadium.

This station was rehabilitated in 2004.

==Station layout==
This elevated station has three tracks with two side platforms. The 4 stops here at all times.

This station has old-style signs that have been painted over and covered up with new-style signs. It also features new fare control railings as a crossunder.

===Exits===
Fare control is situated in the mezzanine under the tracks. Outside of the fare control area, exit stairs go to all corners of River Avenue and 167th Street.

<text>Mount Adams is a mountain located in Essex County of New York. Atop the mountain is the Mount Adams Fire Observation Station, added to the National Register of Historic Places in 2006.

==History==
The first fire lookout structure built on the mountain was a wooden tower that was built by the Conservation Commission in 1912. In 1917, the Conservation Commission replaced it with a steel Aermotor LS40 tower. The tower was ceased fire lookout operations at the end of the 1971 season.

In 2003, the Outdoor Space Institute (OSI) purchased about of land from NL Industries, known as the Tahawus Tract. Within this area is the fire tower, observer&#x27;s cabin and other out buildings. It was planned that a large portion of this property would be transferred to the State of New York and subsequently become part of the High Peaks Wilderness Area, requiring that the tower and related structures be removed. After considerable pressure, the OSI and the DEC agreed that the surrounding lands would be transferred to the State with the exception of the tower and cabin sites. The tower and cabin would be retained by OSI so that historic preservation and restoration work could be done. Restoration work began on the tower by the DEC through AmeriCorp volunteers of the Student Conservation Association. In early April 2006, the Adirondack Park Agency gave final approval to the plan for the Tahawus Tract.

The observers cabin on Adams, which was built in 1922, is the oldest surviving in the state and one of the first of a standard design established by the Conservation Commission that same year. In September 2007, a friends group from ADKHighPeaks.com began a restoration project on the tower. Mount Adams fire tower now appears on the National Historic Lookout Register.

<doc id="729308" wikidata="Q1500322" url="?curid=729308" title="Navigation light">
<text>A navigation light, also known as a running or position light, is a source of illumination on a watercraft, aircraft or spacecraft, meant to give information on the craft&#x27;s position, heading, or status. Some navigation lights are colour-coded red and green to aid traffic control by identifying the craft&#x27;s orientation. Their placement is mandated by international conventions or civil authorities such as the International Maritime Organization (IMO).

A common misconception is that marine or aircraft navigation lights indicate which of two approaching vessels has the &quot;right of way&quot; as in ground traffic; this is never true. However, the red and green colours are chosen to indicate which vessel has the duty to &quot;give way&quot; or &quot;stand on&quot; (obligation to hold course and speed). Consistent with the ground traffic convention, the rightmost of the two vehicles is usually given stand-on status and the leftmost must give way. Therefore a red light is used on the (left (port)) side to indicate &quot;you must give way&quot;; and a green light on the (right (starboard)) side indicates &quot;I will give way; you must stand on&quot;. In case of two power-driven vessels approaching head-on, both are required to give way.

==Marine navigation==
In 1838 the United States passed an act requiring steamboats running between sunset and sunrise to carry one or more signal lights; colour, visibility and location were not specified.

In 1846 the United Kingdom passed the Steam Navigation Act 1846 (9 &amp; 10 Vict. c. 100) enabling the Lord High Admiral to publish regulations requiring all sea-going steam vessels to carry lights. The admiralty exercised these powers in 1848 and required steam vessels to display red and green sidelights as well as a white masthead light whilst under way and a single white light when at anchor.

In 1849 the U.S. Congress extended the light requirements to sailing vessels.

In 1889 the United States convened the first International Maritime Conference to consider regulations for preventing collisions. The resulting Washington Conference Rules were adopted by the U.S. in 1890 and became effective internationally in 1897. Within these rules was the requirement for steamships to carry a second mast head light.

The international 1948 Safety of Life at Sea Conference recommended a mandatory second masthead light solely for power-driven vessels over in length and a fixed sternlight for almost all vessels. The regulations have changed little since then.

The International Regulations for Preventing Collisions at Sea (COLREGs) established in 1972 stipulates the requirements for navigation lights required on a vessel.

===Basic lighting===
Watercraft navigation lights must permit other vessels to determine the type and relative angle of a vessel, and thus decide if there is a danger of collision. In general, sailing vessels are required to carry a green light that shines from dead ahead to 2 points (°) abaft the beam on the starboard side (the right side from the perspective of someone on board facing forward), a red light from dead ahead to two points abaft the beam on the port side (left side) and a white light that shines from astern to two points abaft the beam on both sides. Power driven vessels in addition to these lights, must carry either one or two (depending on length) white masthead lights that shine from ahead to two points abaft the beam on both sides. If two masthead lights are carried then the aft one must be higher than the forward one.

Small power-driven vessels (under ) may carry a single all-round white light in place of the two or three white lights carried by larger vessels, they must also carry red and green navigation lights. Vessels under with a maximum speed of less than are not required to carry navigation lights, but must be capable of showing a white light. Hovercraft at all times and some boats operating in crowded areas may also carry a yellow flashing beacon for added visibility during day or night.

===Lights of special significance===

In addition to red, white and green running lights, a combination of red, white and green mast lights placed on a mast higher than all the running lights, and viewable from all directions, may be used to indicate the type of craft or the service it is performing. See &quot;User Guide&quot; in external links.

*Ships at anchor display one or two white anchor lights (depending on the vessel&#x27;s length) that can be seen from all directions. If two lights are shown then the forward light is higher than the aft one.
*Boats classed as &quot;small&quot; are not compelled to carry navigation lights and may make use of a hand-held flashlight.

==Aviation navigation==

Aircraft are fitted with external navigational lights similar in purpose to those required on watercraft. These are used to signal actions such as entering an active runway or starting up an engine. Historically, incandescent bulbs have been used to provide light; however, recently light-emitting diodes have been used.

Aircraft navigation lights follow the convention of marine vessels established a half-century earlier, with a red navigation light located on the left wingtip leading edge and a green light on the right wingtip leading edge. A white navigation light is as far aft as possible on the tail or each wing tip. High-intensity strobe lights are located on the aircraft to aid in collision avoidance. Anti-collision lights are flashing lights on the top and bottom of the fuselage, wingtips and tail tip. Their purpose is to alert others when something is happening that ground crew and other aircraft need to be aware of, such as running engines or entering active runways.

In civil aviation, pilots must keep navigation lights on from sunset to sunrise, even after engine shutdown when at the gate. High-intensity white strobe lights are part of the anti-collision light system, as well as the red flashing beacon.

All aircraft built after 11 March 1996 must have an anti-collision light system (strobe lights or rotating beacon) turned on for all flight activities in poor visibility. The anti-collision system is recommended in good visibility, where only strobes and beacon are required can use white (clear) lights to increase conspicuity during the daytime. For example, just before pushback, the pilot must keep the beacon lights on to notify ground crews that the engines are about to start. These beacon lights stay on for the duration of the flight. While taxiing, the taxi lights are on. When coming onto the runway, the taxi lights go off and the landing lights and strobes go on. When passing 10,000 feet, the landing lights are no longer required, and the pilot can elect to turn them off. The same cycle in reverse order applies when landing. Landing lights are bright white, forward and downward facing lights on the front of an aircraft. Their purpose is to allow the pilot to see the landing area, and to allow ground crew to see the approaching aircraft.

Civilian commercial airliners also have other non-navigational lights. These include logo lights, which illuminate the company logo on the tail fin. These lights are optional to turn on, though most pilots switch them on at night to increase visibility from other aircraft. Modern airliners also have a wing light. These are positioned on the outer side just in front of the engine cowlings on the fuselage. These are not required to be on, but in some cases pilots turn these lights on for engine checks and also while passengers board the aircraft for better visibility of the ground near the aircraft. While seldom seen, the International Code of Signals allows for the exclusive use of flashing blue lights (60 to 100 flashes/minute), visible from as many directions as possible, by medical aircraft to signal their identity.

==Spacecraft navigation==
In 2011, ORBITEC developed the first light-emitting diode (LED) system for use as running lights on spacecraft. Currently, Cygnus spacecraft, which are uncrewed transport vessels designed for cargo transport to the International Space Station, utilize a navigational lighting system consisting of five flashing high power LED lights. The Cygnus displays a flashing red light on the port side of the vessel, a flashing green on the starboard side of the vessel, two flashing white lights on the top and one flashing yellow on the bottom side of the fuselage.

The SpaceX Dragon and Dragon 2 spacecraft also feature a flashing strobe along with red and green lights.

<doc id="729310" wikidata="Q1821857" url="?curid=729310" title="138th Street–Grand Concourse station">
<text>The 138th Street–Grand Concourse station, also signed as 138th Street–Mott Haven or simply as Mott Haven on station signage, is a local station on the IRT Jerome Avenue Line of the New York City Subway, located at the T-intersection of East 138th Street and the Grand Concourse in the Mott Haven neighborhood of the Bronx. It is served by the 4 train at all times except during rush hours in the peak direction, and the 5 train at all times except late nights.

== History ==
The station opened on July 17, 1918, as Mott Haven Avenue station, as a southbound extension of the Jerome Avenue Line into the Upper East Side extension of the IRT Lexington Avenue Line. As such, it is the newest station on the line. The segment north of Kingsbridge Road to Woodlawn opened three months earlier. The city government took over the IRT&#x27;s operations on June 12, 1940. The station was built with tablets displaying &quot;Mott Haven&quot; and others displaying &quot;138th Street–Mott Haven.&quot; The ones with &quot;138th Street&quot; were painted over with text reading &quot;138th Street–Grand Concourse&quot;, but all were eventually covered with black plates reading &quot;138 Street&quot; in white Standard (Akzidenz-Grotesk) lettering. During the station&#x27;s renovation in the late 2010s, most of the tablets were restored.

In 1956, the New York City Transit Authority announced plans to add fluorescent lighting to the station. The fluorescent lights were installed along the edges of the station&#x27;s platforms.

The walls of both platforms retain their original mosaic trim line with &quot;MH&quot; tablets on it – a relic of the station&#x27;s former name. The platforms were extended at both ends in the 1950s; the design of these platform extensions are in contrast from the original portions, as they have a blue trim with &quot;138TH ST&quot; in white lettering. Blue i-beam columns run along both platforms at regular intervals with alternating ones having the standard black number plates in white lettering.

Until 1972, the station had a connection to the New York Central Railroad&#x27;s 138th Street Station, which served trains on the railroad&#x27;s Harlem and Hudson Divisions.

In 2011, the advocacy group Transportation Alternatives took a poll of subway riders to vote for the smelliest subway station in the system, as part of its &quot;rank the stank&quot; contest. This station was ranked the smelliest of four nominated stations, receiving 35% of the votes.

From November 18, 2019, to March 30, 2020, the northbound platform was temporarily closed for renovations. From April 27, 2020, to July 27, 2020, the southbound platform was temporarily closed for renovations.

==Station layout==

The 138th Street–Grand Concourse station has two side platforms and three tracks, and is one of only two on the IRT Jerome Avenue Line to be built underground. The 4 train skips this station during rush hours in the peak direction. It is the southernmost station on the IRT Jerome Avenue Line. To the south, the line crosses the Harlem River to the next stop, the 125th Street station in East Harlem, Manhattan. The three tracks merge into two and then merge with the IRT Pelham Line to form the four-track IRT Lexington Avenue Line. To the north, the local tracks split into two: an inner set that continues north to the Jerome Avenue Line&#x27;s 149th Street–Grand Concourse station, and an outer set that descends to a lower level and makes a sharp turn to merge with the IRT White Plains Road Line directly west of that line&#x27;s 149th Street–Grand Concourse station. The 5 train uses these tracks during daytime hours.

Both platform walls have their original mosaic trim line with &quot;MH&quot; tablets on it, a relic of Mott Haven Avenue, the former name of the station. At either ends of the platform, where they were extended in the 1950s, the walls have a blue trim with &quot;138TH ST&quot; in white lettering. Blue i-beam columns run along both platforms at regular intervals with alternating ones having the standard black number plates in white lettering.

The station was built with tablets displaying &quot;Mott Haven&quot; and others displaying &quot;138th Street–Mott Haven.&quot; The ones with &quot;138th Street&quot; were painted over with text reading &quot;138th Street–Grand Concourse&quot;, but all were eventually covered with black plates reading &quot;138 Street&quot; in white Standard (Akzidenz-Grotesk) lettering. During the station&#x27;s renovation in the late 2010s, most of the tablets were restored.

Until 1972, the station had a connection to the 138th Street Station which served both the Harlem and Hudson Divisions of the New York Central Railroad.

===Exits===
This station has one mezzanine above the center of the platforms and tracks. Two staircases from each platform go up to a waiting area/crossover, where a turnstile bank provides access to and from the station. Outside fare control, there is a token booth and two staircases going up to the northern corners of East 138th Street and the Grand Concourse. The mezzanine has its original &quot;Uptown Trains&quot; and &quot;Downtown Trains&quot; mosaic tablets and trim line.

<doc id="729317" wikidata="Q525512" url="?curid=729317" title="Pathogen transmission">
<text>In medicine, public health, and biology, transmission is the passing of a pathogen causing communicable disease from an infected host individual or group to a particular individual or group, regardless of whether the other individual was previously infected. The term strictly refers to the transmission of microorganisms directly from one individual to another by one or more of the following means:
* airborne transmission – very small dry and wet particles that stay in the air for long periods of time allowing airborne contamination even after the departure of the host. Particle size &lt; 5 μm.
* droplet transmission – small and usually wet particles that stay in the air for a short period of time. Contamination usually occurs in the presence of the host. Particle size &gt; 5 μm.
* direct physical contact – touching an infected individual, including sexual contact
* indirect physical contact – usually by touching a contaminated surface, including soil (fomite)
* fecal–oral transmission – usually from unwashed hands, contaminated food or water sources due to lack of sanitation and hygiene, an important transmission route in pediatrics, veterinary medicine and developing countries.
* via contaminated hypodermic needles or blood products

Transmission can also be indirect, via another organism, either a vector (e.g. a mosquito or fly) or an intermediate host (e.g. tapeworm in pigs can be transmitted to humans who ingest improperly cooked pork). Indirect transmission could involve zoonoses or, more typically, larger pathogens like macroparasites with more complex life cycles. Transmissions can be autochthonous (i.e. between two individuals in the same place) or may involve travel of the microorganism or the affected hosts.

A 2024 World Health Organization report standardized the terminology for the transmission modes of all respiratory pathogens in alignment with particle physics: airborne transmission; inhalation; direct deposition; and contact. But these newly standardized terms have yet to be translated to policy, including infection control policy or the pandemic accords or updated International Health Regulations.

==Definition and related terms==
An infectious disease agent can be transmitted in two ways: as disease agent transmission from one individual to another in the same generation (peers in the same age group) by either direct contact (licking, touching, biting), or indirect contact through air – cough or sneeze (vectors or fomites that allow the transmission of the agent causing the disease without physical contact)
or by vertical disease transmission, passing the agent causing the disease from parent to offspring, such as in prenatal or perinatal transmission.

The term infectivity describes the ability of an organism to enter, survive and multiply in the host, while the &quot;infectiousness&quot; of a disease agent indicates the comparative ease with which the disease agent is transmitted to other hosts. Transmission of pathogens can occur by direct contact, through contaminated food, body fluids or objects, by airborne inhalation or through vector organisms.

Transmissibility is the probability of an infection, given a contact between an infected host and a noninfected host.

Community transmission means that the source of infection for the spread of an illness is unknown or a link in terms of contacts between patients and other people is missing. It refers to the difficulty in grasping the epidemiological link in the community beyond confirmed cases.

Local transmission means that the source of the infection has been identified within the reporting location (such as within a country, region or city).

==Routes of transmission==

The route of transmission is important to epidemiologists because patterns of contact vary between different populations and different groups of populations depending on socio-economic, cultural and other features. For example, low personal and food hygiene due to the lack of a clean water supply may result in increased transmission of diseases by the fecal-oral route, such as cholera. Differences in incidence of such diseases between different groups can also throw light on the routes of transmission of the disease. For example, if it is noted that polio is more common in cities in underdeveloped countries, without a clean water supply, than in cities with a good plumbing system, we might advance the theory that polio is spread by the fecal-oral route. Two routes are considered to be airborne: Airborne infections and droplet infections.

===Airborne infection===

&quot;Airborne transmission refers to infectious agents that are spread via droplet nuclei (residue from evaporated droplets) containing infective microorganisms. These organisms can survive outside the body and remain suspended in the air for long periods of time. They infect others via the upper and lower respiratory tracts.&quot; The size of the particles for airborne infections need to be &lt; 5 μm. It includes both dry and wet aerosols and thus requires usually higher levels of isolation since it can stay suspended in the air for longer periods of time. i.e., separate ventilation systems or negative pressure environments are needed to avoid general contamination. e.g., tuberculosis, chickenpox, measles.

=== infection===

A common form of transmission is by way of respiratory droplets, generated by coughing, sneezing, or talking. Respiratory droplet transmission is the usual route for respiratory infections. Transmission can occur when respiratory droplets reach susceptible mucosal surfaces, such as in the eyes, nose or mouth. This can also happen indirectly via contact with contaminated surfaces when hands then touch the face. Before drying, respiratory droplets are large and cannot remain suspended in the air for long, and are usually dispersed over short distances. The size of the particles for droplet infections are &gt; 5 μm.

Organisms spread by droplet transmission include respiratory viruses such as influenza virus, parainfluenza virus, adenoviruses, rhinovirus, respiratory syncytial virus, human metapneumovirus, &quot;Bordetella pertussis&quot;, pneumococci, streptococcus pyogenes, diphtheria, rubella, and coronaviruses. Spread of respiratory droplets from the wearer can be reduced through wearing of a surgical mask.

===Direct contact===

Direct contact occurs through skin-to-skin contact, kissing, and sexual intercourse. Direct contact also refers to contact with soil or vegetation harboring infectious organisms. Additionally, while fecal–oral transmission is primarily considered an indirect contact route, direct contact can also result in transmission through feces.

Diseases that can be transmitted by direct contact are called contagious (contagious is not the same as infectious; although all contagious diseases are infectious, not all infectious diseases are contagious). These diseases can also be transmitted by sharing a towel (where the towel is rubbed vigorously on both bodies) or items of clothing in close contact with the body (socks, for example) if they are not washed thoroughly between uses. For this reason, contagious diseases often break out in schools, where towels are shared and personal items of clothing accidentally swapped in the changing rooms.

Some diseases that are transmissible by direct contact include athlete&#x27;s foot, impetigo, syphilis, warts, and conjunctivitis.

====Sexual====

This refers to any infection that can be caught during sexual activity with another person, including vaginal or anal sex, less commonly through oral sex (see below) and rarely through manual sex (see below). Transmission is either directly between surfaces in contact during intercourse (the usual route for bacterial infections and those infections causing sores) or from secretions (semen or the fluid secreted by the excited female) which carry infectious agents that get into the partner&#x27;s blood stream through tiny tears in the penis, vagina or rectum (this is a more usual route for viruses). In this second case, anal sex is considerably more hazardous since the penis opens more tears in the rectum than the vagina, as the vagina is more elastic and more accommodating.

Some infections transmissible by the sexual route include HIV/AIDS, chlamydia, genital warts, gonorrhea, hepatitis B, syphilis, herpes, and trichomoniasis.

====Oral sex====
Sexually transmitted infections such as HIV and hepatitis B are thought to not normally be transmitted through mouth-to-mouth contact, although it is possible to transmit some STIs between the genitals and the mouth, during oral sex. In the case of HIV, this possibility has been established. It is also responsible for the increased incidence of herpes simplex virus 1 (which is usually responsible for oral infections) in genital infections and the increased incidence of the type 2 virus (more common genitally) in oral infections.

====Manual sex====
While rare in regards to this sexual practice, some infections that can spread via manual sex include HPV, chlamydia, and syphilis.

====Oral====
Infections that are transmitted primarily by oral means may be caught through direct oral contact such as kissing, or by indirect contact such as by sharing a drinking glass or a cigarette. Infections that are known to be transmissible by kissing or by other direct or indirect oral contact include all of the infections transmissible by droplet contact and (at least) all forms of herpes viruses, namely Cytomegalovirus infections herpes simplex virus (especially HSV-1) and infectious mononucleosis. 

====Mother-to-child transmission====
This is from mother to child (more rarely father to child), often &quot;in utero&quot;, during childbirth (also referred to as perinatal infection) or during postnatal physical contact between parents and offspring. In mammals, including humans, it occurs also via breast milk (transmammary transmission). Infectious diseases that can be transmitted in this way include: HIV, hepatitis B and syphilis. Many mutualistic organisms are transmitted vertically.

====Iatrogenic====
Transmission due to medical procedures, such as touching a wound, the use of contaminated medical equipment, or an injection or transplantation of infected material. Some diseases that can be transmitted iatrogenically include Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease, HIV, and many more.

==== Needle sharing ====
This is the practice of intravenous drug-users by which a needle or syringe is shared by multiple individuals to administer intravenous drugs such as heroin, steroids, and hormones. This can act as a vector for blood-borne diseases, such as Hepatitis C (HCV) and HIV.

=== Indirect contact ===
Indirect contact transmission, also known as vehicle-borne transmission, involves transmission through contamination of inanimate objects. Vehicles that may indirectly transmit an infectious agent include food, water, biologic products such as blood, and fomites such as handkerchiefs, bedding, or surgical scalpels. A vehicle may passively carry a pathogen, as in the case of food or water may carrying hepatitis A virus. Alternatively, the vehicle may provide an environment in which the agent grows, multiplies, or produces toxin, such as improperly canned foods provide an environment that supports production of botulinum toxin by &quot;Clostridium botulinum&quot;.

===Transmission by other organisms===

A &quot;vector&quot; is an organism that does not cause disease itself but that transmits infection by conveying pathogens from one host to another.

Vectors may be mechanical or biological. A mechanical vector picks up an infectious agent on the outside of its body and transmits it in a passive manner. An example of a mechanical vector is a housefly, which lands on cow dung, contaminating its appendages with bacteria from the feces, and then lands on food prior to consumption. The pathogen never enters the body of the fly. In contrast, biological vectors harbor pathogens within their bodies and deliver pathogens to new hosts in an active manner, usually a bite. Biological vectors are often responsible for serious blood-borne diseases, such as malaria, viral encephalitis, Chagas disease, Lyme disease and African sleeping sickness. Biological vectors are usually, though not exclusively, arthropods, such as mosquitoes, ticks, fleas and lice. Vectors are often required in the life cycle of a pathogen. A common strategy used to control vector-borne infectious diseases is to interrupt the life cycle of a pathogen by killing the vector.

===Fecal–oral===
In the fecal-oral route, pathogens in fecal particles pass from one person to the mouth of another person. Although it is usually discussed as a route of transmission, it is actually a specification of the entry and exit portals of the pathogen, and can operate across several of the other routes of transmission. Fecal–oral transmission is primarily considered as an indirect contact route through contaminated food or water. However, it can also operate through direct contact with feces or contaminated body parts, such as through anal sex. It can also operate through droplet or airborne transmission through the toilet plume from contaminated toilets.

Main causes of fecal–oral disease transmission include lack of adequate sanitation and poor hygiene practices - which can take various forms. Fecal oral transmission can be via foodstuffs or water that has become contaminated. This can happen when people do not adequately wash their hands after using the toilet and before preparing food or tending to patients.

The fecal-oral route of transmission can be a public health risk for people in developing countries who live in urban slums without access to adequate sanitation. Here, excreta or untreated sewage can pollute drinking water sources (groundwater or surface water). The people who drink the polluted water can become infected. Another problem in some developing countries, is open defecation which leads to disease transmission via the fecal-oral route.

Even in developed countries there are periodic system failures resulting in a sanitary sewer overflow. This is the typical mode of transmission for infectious agents such as cholera, hepatitis A, polio, Rotavirus, &quot;Salmonella&quot;, and parasites (e.g. &quot;Ascaris lumbricoides&quot;).

==Tracking==

Tracking the transmission of infectious diseases is called disease surveillance. Surveillance of infectious diseases in the public realm traditionally has been the responsibility of public health agencies, on an international, national, or local level. Public health staff relies on health care workers and microbiology laboratories to report cases of reportable diseases to them. The analysis of aggregate data can show the spread of a disease and is at the core of the specialty of epidemiology.
To understand the spread of the vast majority of non-notifiable diseases, data either need to be collected in a particular study, or existing data collections can be mined, such as insurance company data or antimicrobial drug sales for example.

For diseases transmitted within an institution, such as a hospital, prison, nursing home, boarding school, orphanage, refugee camp, etc., infection control specialists are employed, who will review medical records to analyze transmission as part of a hospital epidemiology program, for example.

Because these traditional methods are slow, time-consuming, and labor-intensive, proxies of transmission have been sought. One proxy in the case of influenza is tracking of influenza-like illness at certain sentinel sites of health care practitioners within a state, for example. Tools have been developed to help track influenza epidemics by finding patterns in certain web search query activity. It was found that the frequency of influenza-related web searches as a whole rises as the number of people sick with influenza rises. Examining space-time relationships of web queries has been shown to approximate the spread of influenza and dengue.

Computer simulations of infectious disease spread have been used.
Human aggregation can drive transmission, seasonal variation and outbreaks of infectious diseases, such as the annual start of school, bootcamp, the annual Hajj etc. Most recently, data from cell phones have been shown to be able to capture population movements well enough to predict the transmission of certain infectious diseases, like rubella.

==Relationship with virulence and survival==

Pathogens must have a way to be transmitted from one host to another to ensure their species&#x27; survival. Infectious agents are generally specialized for a particular method of transmission. Taking an example from the respiratory route, from an evolutionary perspective viruses or bacteria that cause their host to develop coughing and sneezing symptoms have a great survival advantage, as they are much more likely to be ejected from one host and carried to another. This is also the reason that many microorganisms cause diarrhea.

The relationship between virulence and transmission is complex and has important consequences for the long term evolution of a pathogen. Since it takes many generations for a microbe and a new host species to co-evolve, an emerging pathogen may hit its earliest victims especially hard. It is usually in the first wave of a new disease that death rates are highest. If a disease is rapidly fatal, the host may die before the microbe can be passed along to another host. However, this cost may be overwhelmed by the short-term benefit of higher infectiousness if transmission is linked to virulence, as it is for instance in the case of cholera (the explosive diarrhea aids the bacterium in finding new hosts) or many respiratory infections (sneezing and coughing create infectious aerosols).

Anything that reduces the rate of transmission of an infection carries positive externalities, which are benefits to society that are not reflected in a price to a consumer. This is recognized implicitly when vaccines are offered for free or at a cost to the patient less than the purchase price.

==Beneficial microorganisms==

The mode of transmission is also an important aspect of the biology of beneficial microbial symbionts, such as coral-associated dinoflagellates or human microbiota. Organisms can form symbioses with microbes transmitted from their parents, from the environment or unrelated individuals, or both.

===Vertical transmission===

Vertical transmission refers to acquisition of symbionts from parents (usually mothers). Vertical transmission can be intracellular (e.g. transovarial), or extracellular (for example through post-embryonic contact between parents and offspring). Both intracellular and extracellular vertical transmission can be considered a form of non-genetic inheritance or parental effect. It has been argued that most organisms experience some form of vertical transmission of symbionts. Canonical examples of vertically transmitted symbionts include the nutritional symbiont Buchnera in aphids (transovarially transmitted intracellular symbiont) and some components of the human microbiota (transmitted during passage of infants through the birth canal and also through breastfeeding).

===Horizontal transmission===

Some beneficial symbionts are acquired horizontally, from the environment or unrelated individuals. This requires that host and symbiont have some method of recognizing each other or each other&#x27;s products or services. Often, horizontally acquired symbionts are relevant to secondary rather than primary metabolism, for example for use in defense against pathogens, but some primary nutritional symbionts are also horizontally (environmentally) acquired. Additional examples of horizontally transmitted beneficial symbionts include bioluminescent bacteria associated with bobtail squid and nitrogen-fixing bacteria in plants.

===Mixed-mode transmission===

Many microbial symbionts, including human microbiota, can be transmitted both vertically and horizontally. Mixed-mode transmission can allow symbionts to have the &quot;best of both worlds&quot; – they can vertically infect host offspring when host density is low, and horizontally infect diverse additional hosts when a number of additional hosts are available. Mixed-mode transmission make the outcome (degree of harm or benefit) of the relationship more difficult to predict, because the evolutionary success of the symbiont is sometimes but not always tied to the success of the host.

<text>Edward John Mason (born 8 May 1912 in Birmingham, England, died 3 February 1971) was a scriptwriter for radio, television and movies for both the BBC and its rival Radio Luxembourg.

==Career==
Edward J. Mason had his first major success in 1947 as a script writer when the BBC Home Service radio network began airing his British detective serial &quot;Dick Barton&quot; which he created with co-writer Geoffrey Webb. This was the first serial to air on the BBC and it continued to be aired until 1951. The BBC replaced &quot;Dick Barton&quot; with &quot;The Archers&quot;, originally another creation of the Mason-Webb team, today &quot;The Archers&quot; remains the world&#x27;s longest-running soap opera on radio.

In 1950 and prior to &quot;The Archers&quot;, Mason also created the radio serials &quot;The Lady Craved Excitement&quot; and &quot;What the Butler Saw,&quot; both of which were filmed in that year by Hammer Films (&quot;The Lady Craved Excitement,&quot; &quot;What the Butler Saw&quot;).

In 1954, he wrote the 6-part serial thriller &quot;Red For Danger&quot;, which was broadcast on the BBC Midlands service. In 1955, Edward J. Mason created another mystery series called &quot;Shadow Man&quot; for the BBC&#x27;s English language commercial rival Radio Luxembourg. &quot;Shadow Man&quot; was sponsored by Stork Margarine and it ran on &quot;208&quot; at 8:30 pm on Tuesday evenings.

That same year Mason also worked on scripts for two television series: &quot;Unheimliche Begegnungen&quot; and a year later (1956) on &quot;I&#x27;m Not Bothered&quot;.

In 1960, Mason wrote for the TV mini-series &quot;The Days of Vengeance&quot; and in 1961 &quot;Flower of Evil&quot;. In 1962 his TV work included &quot;Outbreak of Murder&quot; followed in 1964 by &quot;How to be an Alien&quot;.

Mason also created a string of panel game shows with producer Tony Shryane and these included &quot;Guilty Party&quot;, &quot;My Word!&quot;, and &quot;My Music&quot;.

==Personal life==
His son Jeremy Mason, an actor who played Roger Travers-Macy in &quot;The Archers&quot;, married the actress Carolyn Jones. Jones played Ursula Titchener in &quot;The Archers&quot; from 2016 to 2018, at the end of her career. His other son was musician and songwriter Laurence &#x27;Lol&#x27; Mason, the former lead singer of late 1970s rock band City Boy and 1980s one hit wonders The Maisonettes.

<doc id="729330" wikidata="Q6623630" url="?curid=729330" title="List of hospitals in Massachusetts">
<text>This is a list of current and former hospitals in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, U.S. By default, the list is sorted alphabetically by name. This table also provides the hospital network of each hospital (if applicable), the city and county where it is located, whether or not it has an emergency department, when it was opened and closed, its current status, type, and former names.

*Name: The most recent name of the hospital. Former names will be listed in the last column.
*City, Town, or Neighborhood: The lowest level census designation of the hospital&#x27;s most recent location.
*Network: The parent organization or government agency in charge of the hospital. For closed hospitals, the network will retain its name at the time of closure and will not be updated if the network changes its name (such as Union Hospital, listed as a Partners Healthcare hospital even though the network changed its name to Mass General Brigham after the hospital closed). Text will be italicized if the hospital is independent or if it is owned or operated by a public entity.
*Emergency Department: Indicates the presence of an emergency department, along with trauma designation if applicable. &quot;Former&quot; if the hospital used to have one.
*EMS Region: As defined by the Massachusetts Office of Emergency Medical Services. Will be filled even for facilities which predate region designations.
*Opened-Closed: The years of operation.
**Opened, when possible, specifically refers to the date on which the facility admitted its first patient.
*Status / Type / Notes:
**Status is in italics and is generally in reference to a hospital&#x27;s inpatient operations: Active, Succeeded, or Closed. Marked &quot;Fate Unknown&quot; if the hospital is no longer in operation but it cannot be determined if it was closed or acquired.
**Hospital type, when available, comes after Status. When applicable, the type will always reference data from the Massachusetts Center for Health Information and Analysis. As CHIA was formed in 2012, any hospitals which either closed before data was collected or which do not fall under its purview (such as federal facilities) will be given the most appropriate typing.
**Notes will encompass all other appropriate information, including former names.

Note: Closures and opening dates, in the case where a hospital is acquired or merges with another, will be designated depending on how substantial the change is. For example, single hospitals purchased by a new entity will generally not be considered to have closed (such as Kindred Hospital Park View, originally Springfield Municipal Hospital, is considered for this list to have been open consistently since 1931), however simultaneous mergers of multiple hospitals may be considered as a closure of the old hospitals and opening of a new facility (such as Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, considered for this list to have &quot;opened&quot; when its predecessors, Beth Israel Hospital and New England Deaconess Hospital, &quot;closed&quot; and merged in 1996). Additionally, a facility which is still in business is considered &quot;closed&quot; if a change in operation leads to the facility no longer meeting an arguable definition of &quot;hospital&quot; (example: Burbank Hospital &quot;closed&quot; when inpatient care ended, although the location still exists as an outpatient campus of another hospital).

<doc id="729331" wikidata="Q2183775" url="?curid=729331" title="Wall Street station (IRT Lexington Avenue Line)">
<text>The Wall Street station is a station on the IRT Lexington Avenue Line of the New York City Subway. The station is located at the intersection of Broadway and Wall Street in the Financial District of Lower Manhattan. It is served by the 4 train at all times and the 5 train at all times except late nights.

The Wall Street station was constructed for the Interborough Rapid Transit Company (IRT) as part of the city&#x27;s first subway line, which was approved in 1900. Construction of the tunnel around the Wall Street station was complicated by the shallow foundations of the nearby Trinity Church, as well as the need to avoid disrupting the street surface of Broadway. The station opened on June 12, 1905, as an extension of the original line. The station&#x27;s platforms were lengthened in the late 1950s, and it was renovated in the 1970s and 2000s.

The Wall Street station contains two side platforms and two tracks, and it was built with tile and mosaic decorations. The platforms contain exits to Broadway&#x27;s intersections with Wall and Rector Streets, outside Trinity Church, and into the basements of several buildings. An additional passageway extends east to an out-of-system connection with the Broad Street station and the basement of 28 Liberty Street. The original station interior is a New York City designated landmark and listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

== History ==

=== Construction and opening ===
Planning for a subway line in New York City dates to 1864. However, development of what would become the city&#x27;s first subway line did not start until 1894, when the New York State Legislature passed the Rapid Transit Act. The subway plans were drawn up by a team of engineers led by William Barclay Parsons, the Rapid Transit Commission&#x27;s chief engineer. The Rapid Transit Construction Company, organized by John B. McDonald and funded by August Belmont Jr., signed the initial Contract 1 with the Rapid Transit Commission in February 1900, in which it would construct the subway and maintain a 50-year operating lease from the opening of the line. In 1901, the firm of Heins &amp; LaFarge was hired to design the underground stations. Belmont incorporated the Interborough Rapid Transit Company (IRT) in April 1902 to operate the subway.

Several days after Contract 1 was signed, the Board of Rapid Transit Railroad Commissioners instructed Parsons to evaluate the feasibility of extending the subway south to South Ferry, and then to Brooklyn. On January 24, 1901, the Board adopted a route that would extend the subway from City Hall to the Long Island Rail Road (LIRR)&#x27;s Flatbush Avenue terminal station (now known as Atlantic Terminal) in Brooklyn, via the Joralemon Street Tunnel under the East River. Contract 2, which gave the IRT a 35-year lease,was executed between the commission and the Rapid Transit Construction Company on September 11, 1902. Construction began at State Street in Manhattan on November 8, 1902. The section of the Contract 2 subway tunnel under the southernmost section of Broadway, between Battery Park and City Hall, was contracted to Degnon-McLean Contracting Company.

Contract 2 specified that traffic upon the streets of lower Manhattan not be disrupted. At its shallowest, the tunnel would be only below the bottoms of the street car conduits along Broadway. Accordingly, the contractor proposed replacing the pavement with a planked roadway and excavating beneath this temporary surface. To address concerns that leakage from the gas mains beneath the roadway and within the excavation would produce a devastating explosion, the contractor moved the pipes to above the street. Furthermore, precautionary measures had to be undertaken during the construction of the tunnel in front of Trinity Church, adjacent to the Wall Street station. The spire of the church rested upon a shallow masonry foundation built upon a deep layer of fine sand. The spire&#x27;s foundation was behind the subway tunnel&#x27;s exterior wall, and the bottom of the spire foundation was below street level, much shallower than the subway&#x27;s foundation. Accordingly, the tunnel nearest the spire&#x27;s foundation was constructed in three sections, and steel channels were used as sheet piling around the subway excavation. After the excavation was completed, these steel channels were left in place to prevent the soil from settling. No &quot;measurable or movement of the spire&quot; occurred during or after construction.

By the beginning of June 1905, the station was expected to open on June 17. The Wall Street station opened on June 12, 1905, as a one-stop extension of the original subway from Fulton Street. A switch was added south of Rector Street to allow trains to terminate at the Wall Street station. The station&#x27;s opening contributed to the growth of Wall Street, which had become the center of Manhattan&#x27;s Financial District at the beginning of the 20th century.

=== 1900s to 1940s ===

To address overcrowding, in 1909, the New York Public Service Commission proposed lengthening the platforms at stations along the original IRT subway. As part of a modification to the IRT&#x27;s construction contracts made on January 18, 1910, the company was to lengthen station platforms to accommodate ten-car express and six-car local trains. In addition to $1.5 million (equivalent to $ million in ) spent on platform lengthening, $500,000 (equivalent to $ million in ) was spent on building additional entrances and exits. It was anticipated that these improvements would increase capacity by 25 percent. The northbound platform at the Wall Street station was extended to the south, while the southbound platform was extended to the north. The southbound platform extension required installing new girders and columns at Trinity Church, while the northbound platform extension abutted the basements of adjacent properties. On January 23, 1911, ten-car express trains began running on the East Side Line, and the next day, ten-car express trains began running on the West Side Line.

In 1910, the IRT reported that a passageway would be constructed to the basement of the planned Equitable Office Building, on the east side of Broadway, just north of the Wall Street station. That office building was proposed in 1908 on the site of the Equitable Life Building, which ultimately burned down in 1912. An agreement was signed between the IRT, the Equitable Building Corporation, and the city in January 1915, providing for a passageway from the building&#x27;s basement to the northern ends of both platforms. Construction of the passageways started in October 1915. The entrance to the Equitable Building, as well as others to 7 Wall Street and 65 Broadway, opened in 1917. One block south of the Equitable Building, the Irving Trust Company started developing a skyscraper at 1 Wall Street, at the southwest corner of Broadway and Wall Street, in 1930. That March, Irving Trust signed an agreement with the IRT to build three new entrances to the Wall Street station on Broadway and another entrance in 1 Wall Street&#x27;s basement. Two entrances to the northbound platform opened in March 1931, after 1 Wall Street was completed. One entrance led to the building&#x27;s basement, while another led to New Street through a passageway in the building.

=== 1940s to 1980s ===
The city government took over the IRT&#x27;s operations on June 12, 1940. The New York City Transit Authority (NYCTA) announced plans in 1956 to add fluorescent lights above the edges of the station&#x27;s platforms. The lights were installed the next year. In late 1959, contracts were awarded to extend the platforms at , Wall Street, Canal Street, , , , , , and to . In April 1960, work began on a $3,509,000 project (equivalent to $ million in ) to lengthen platforms at seven of these stations to accommodate ten-car trains. To accommodate the project, the Trinity Building entrance at 111 Broadway was closed from July 1960 to July 1962. The entire platform-lengthening project was substantially completed by November 1965.

In 1979, the New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission designated the space within the boundaries of the original station, excluding expansions made after 1904, as a city landmark. The station was designated along with eleven others on the original IRT. During the late 1970s and early 1980s, the station was renovated; much of the original wall surface on the northbound platform was covered by glossy dark blue tiles about thick. The renovation preserved the station name plaques and mosaics. The Wall Street station&#x27;s renovation was the first of six projects under the Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA)&#x27;s Adopt-a-Station program. Fundraising efforts were led by the Downtown Lower Manhattan Association, which enlisted support from the Chase Manhattan Bank and American Express, two companies whose buildings were directly served by the station.

=== 1990s to present ===
On January 6, 1994, Automated Fare Collection turnstiles went into service at this station and at the Whitehall Street station. In 1995, as a result of service reductions, the MTA was considering permanently closing one of the two Wall Street stations, as well as two other stations citywide, due to their proximity to each other. Either the IRT Broadway–Seventh Avenue Line station or the IRT Lexington Avenue Line station would have been closed. Following the September 11 attacks in 2001, the Wall Street station was closed for nine days.

The original interiors were listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2004. The next year, the MTA provided funding for a renovation of the station as part of its 2005–2009 capital program. The MTA commenced a project to renovate the station and restore its original appearance in 2006. During this renovation, the blue tiles were removed, and the original tiles were restored. Some of the panels and beams on the ceiling were installed improperly, causing trains to scrape against them.

==Station layout==

Wall Street has two tracks and two side platforms. The 4 train stops here at all times, while the 5 train stops here at all times except late nights. The station is between to the north and to the south. The platforms were originally long, like at other Contract 2 stations, but were lengthened during the 1959 expansion of the station. The northbound platform was extended southward and became long, while the southbound platform was extended northward and became long. There are two underpasses between the platforms, one each at the northern and southern ends of the southbound platform, which lead respectively to a passageway and to the center of the northbound platform.

===Design===

As with other stations built as part of the original IRT, the station was constructed using a cut-and-cover method. The tunnel is covered by a U-shaped trough that contains utility pipes and wires. The bottom of this trough contains a foundation of concrete no less than thick. Each platform consists of concrete slabs, beneath which are drainage basins. The original platforms contain circular, cast-iron Doric-style columns away from the platform edge, spaced every , while the platform extensions contain I-beam columns near the platform edge. Additional columns between the tracks, spaced every , support the jack-arched concrete station roofs. The ceiling height varies based on whether there are utilities in the ceiling. There is a gap between the trough wall and the platform walls, which are made of -thick brick covered over by a tiled finish.

The fare control areas are at platform level. The walls along the platforms near the fare control areas consist of a pink marble wainscoting on the lowest part of the wall, with bronze air vents along the wainscoting, and white glass tiles above. The platform walls are divided at intervals by pink marble pilasters, or vertical bands. In the original portion of the station, each pilaster is topped by blue-and-green tile plaques, which contain the letter &quot;W&quot; surrounded by a Greek key carving. Above these &quot;W&quot; plaques are faience mosaics that depict a step-gabled house in New Amsterdam with the palisade wall in front of it, a reference to the namesake of Wall Street. These mosaics are topped by blue faience swags and are connected by a faience cornice with scrolled and foliate detail. This decorative design is extended to the fare control areas adjacent to the original portions of the station. White-on-blue tile plaques with the words &quot;Wall Street&quot; and floral motifs are also placed on the walls. The platform extensions contain similar decorative elements. The ceilings contain plaster molding.

On the southbound platform is a disused oak token booth, the last of its kind in the New York City Subway system, which is just south of the stairs leading to Wall Street. The booth is separated into panels that are slightly chamfered, or angled away from each other. Above the panels are windows, some with brass scrollwork screens. A ticket chopper is north of the token booth. Beneath the street stairs leading to Wall Street are wooden doorways that formerly led to men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s restrooms, with corresponding marble lintels.

Also on the platforms are &quot;Lariat Tapers&quot;, which are bronze loops attached to the columns to serve as seating. These were designed by James Garvey in 2011, as a follow-up to his &quot;Lariat Seat Loops&quot; at 33rd Street, commissioned in 1997.

===Exits===
The exits for the southbound platform are on the west side of Broadway. At the southern end of the platform, two stairs are built into the facade of 71 Broadway, south of Rector Street, with one stair on either side of that building&#x27;s main entrance. These staircases combine into one wide stairway that leads down to platform level. Another exit just north of Rector Street leads to two street stairs, which ascend to the western side of Broadway at Wall Street, outside the Trinity Churchyard fence. These street stairs retain cast-iron hoods with leaf patterns, which are part of the original design; the Wall Street station is one of two stations to retain such hoods, the other being the Borough Hall station in Brooklyn. At the north end of the station a street exit is built into the side of the Trinity Building at 111 Broadway. It has an opulent brass-toned banner proclaiming &quot;Subway Entrance&quot; atop the entrance, which is half a flight below ground. The exit had a Subway restaurant outside fare control.

There are numerous closed exits along the southbound platform. Within the fare control area at the south end of the station, a passageway led to the American Express Building at 65 Broadway, adjacent to the stair to 71 Broadway. At the extreme southern end of the platform was a passageway to the Adams Express Building at 61 Broadway, which opened along with that building in 1915 and was closed after 1944. At the extreme northern end, next to the 111 Broadway entrance, another exit extended to the United States Realty Building at 115 Broadway, though this exit was closed sometime after 1947.

On the northbound side, three staircases lead to the east side of Broadway near Rector Street. Here, a closed-off passageway led to the basement of 1 Wall Street. These street staircases contain relatively simple, modern steel railings like those seen at most New York City Subway stations. The north end of the platform leads to a tunnel which connects on the left to a crossunder, and on the right to a passageway exiting fare control. The passageway outside fare control leads into the basement of the Equitable Building and continues to a street staircase at Cedar and Nassau Streets (28 Liberty Street) on the left. There is a connection to the Broad Street station () and the Wall Street/William Street station () on the right.

<doc id="729333" wikidata="Q331785" url="?curid=729333" title="Zarya (ISS module)">
<text>Zarya (), also known as the Functional Cargo Block (), is the inaugural component of the International Space Station (ISS). Launched on 20 November 1998 atop a Proton-K rocket, the module would serve as the ISS&#x27;s primary source of power, propulsion, and guidance during its early years. As the station has grown, &quot;Zarya&quot;″s role has transitioned primarily to storage, both internally and in its external fuel tanks. A descendant of the TKS spacecraft used in the &quot;Salyut&quot; programme, &quot;Zarya&quot; was built in Russia but its construction was financed by the United States. Its name, meaning &quot;sunrise,&quot; symbolizes the beginning of a new era of international space cooperation.

== Construction ==
The Zarya design was originally intended as a module for the Russian &quot;Mir&quot; space station, but was not flown as of the end of the Mir program. A FGB cargo block was incorporated as an upper stage engine into the Polyus spacecraft, flown (unsuccessfully) on the first Energia launch. With the end of the Mir program, the design was adapted to use for the International Space Station.

The &quot;Zarya&quot; module is capable of station keeping and provides sizable battery power; it was suggested to have initially been built to both power and control the recoil from a further derivation of the then classified Skif laser system/Polyus satellite. Commentators in the West thought that the &quot;Zarya&quot; module was constructed more cheaply and lifted to orbit faster than should have been possible in the post-Soviet era, and that the FGB might have been largely constructed from hardware from the Skif laser program (which had been canceled after the failed 1987 Polyus launch).

The research and development of a similar design was paid for by Russia and the Soviet Union; the design of the module and all systems are Soviet/Russian. The United States funded &quot;Zarya&quot; through the U.S. prime contracts in the 1990s as the first module for ISS, and it was built from December 1994 to January 1998 in Russia at the Khrunichev State Research and Production Space Center (KhSC) in Moscow. The module was included as part of NASA&#x27;s plan for the International Space Station (ISS) instead of Lockheed Martin&#x27;s &quot;Bus-1&quot; option because it was significantly cheaper (US$220 million vs. $450 million). As part of the contract, Khrunichev constructed much of an identical module (referred to as &quot;FGB-2&quot;) for contingency purposes. FGB-2 was proposed to be used for a variety of projects; it has been used to construct the Russian Multipurpose Laboratory Module &quot;Nauka&quot;.
== Design ==
&quot;Zarya&quot; has a mass of , is long and wide at its widest point.

The module has three docking ports: one axially on the front end at the docking sphere, one on the Earth-facing side (nadir) of the docking sphere and one axially on the aft end.
Attached to the forward port is the Pressurized Mating Adapter &quot;PMA-1&quot;, which in turn is connected to the &quot;Unity&quot; Module – this is the connection
between the Russian Orbital Segment (ROS) and the US Orbital Segment (USOS).
Attached to the aft port is the &quot;Zvezda&quot; Service Module. The lower port (nadir) was initially used by visiting Soyuz spacecraft and Progress spacecraft to dock to the ROS; The &quot;Rassvet&quot; module is now docked semipermanently on the nadir port of &quot;Zarya&quot;, and visiting spacecraft use &quot;Rassvet&quot; nadir docking port instead. It was planned to install another zenith docking port in the docking sphere, however, after the design was changed, a spherical cover was welded in its place.

&quot;Zarya&quot; has two solar arrays measuring and six nickel-cadmium batteries that can provide an average of of power – the solar arrays have been however partially retracted so the P1/S1 radiators of the Integrated Truss Structure could deploy. They are still generating some power, but not the average of power, they once provided when they were fully unfurled. &quot;Zarya&quot; has 16 external fuel tanks that can hold up to of propellant (this requirement was mandated by NASA in early 1997 over concerns that the &quot;Zvezda&quot; Service Module would be further delayed, hence the FGB had to be capable of independent propellant storage and transfer from Progress spacecraft even without &quot;Zvezda&quot; ). &quot;Zarya&quot; also has 24 large steering jets, 12 small steering jets, and two large engines that were used for reboost and major orbital changes; with the docking of &quot;Zvezda&quot; these are now permanently disabled. Since they are no longer needed for &quot;Zarya&quot; engines, Zarya&#x27;s propellant tanks are now used to store additional fuel for &quot;Zvezda&quot;.

== Launch and flight ==

&quot;Zarya&quot; was launched on 20 November 1998 on a Russian Proton rocket from Baikonur Cosmodrome Site 81 in Kazakhstan to a high orbit with a designed lifetime of at least 15 years. After &quot;Zarya&quot; reached orbit, STS-88 launched on 4 December 1998 to attach the &quot;Unity&quot; module.

Although only designed to fly autonomously for six to eight months, &quot;Zarya&quot; was required to do so for almost two years due to delays to the Russian Service Module, &quot;Zvezda&quot;. &quot;Zvezda&quot; was finally launched on 12 July 2000, docking with &quot;Zarya&quot; on 26 July 2000.

&quot;Zarya&quot; passed the 50,000-orbit mark at 15:17 UTC on 14 August 2007 during the STS-118 mission to the International Space Station.

<doc id="729334" wikidata="Q3529959" url="?curid=729334" title="Jardin de Tivoli, Paris">
<text>The Tivoli gardens of Paris were amusement parks located near the current site of the Saint-Lazare station, named after the gardens of the Villa d&#x27;Este in Tivoli near Rome. There were several such gardens in succession between 1795 and 1842, none of which remain today.

== &quot;Folie-Boutin&quot; or Grand Tivoli (1795-1810) ==
In 1766, Simon Gabriel Boutin (1720-1794), a son of the wealthy farmer-general Boutin, had several houses built in a park of eight hectares, resplendent with rare plants, English, Italian, and Dutch gardens, a bowling green, and follies including false ruins, rocky promontories, and a waterfall. He named the ensemble &quot;Tivoli&quot; in honor of the gardens of the Villa d&#x27;Este in Rome, and the &quot;Folie Boutin&quot;, as it was often called, quickly became known for its splendid gardens. Its main entrance was located rue de Clichy, with a secondary entrance on rue Saint-Lazare. Two principal buildings were at n°102, la rue Saint-Lazare, and at n°27, la rue de Clichy. A pavilion, attributed to architect François Dominique Barreau de Chefdeville (1725-1765), housed a mineralogical collection. There on Thursdays Boutin received his friends, including painter Hubert Robert and architect Alexandre-Théodore Brongniart.

Boutin was guillotined on July 17, 1794, during the Reign of Terror, and the park put under sequestration. In 1795, the &quot;Folie Boutin&quot; opened to the public, formally taking the name of Tivoli and becoming the ancestor of amusement parks. During its time as a public garden, it was a favorite entertainment spot for Parisian high society, with amusements including panoramas, marionnettes, and magic lantern shows. Madame Saqui made her triumphany Parisian depute at the site, walking the tightrope accompanied by firework in 1806. 

From 1796 to 1797 a counter-revolutionary society, called &quot;Clichy&quot;, occupied the site, but Boutin&#x27;s heirs recovered Tivoli by a lawsuit in 1797. In 1799, a bath opened on the site (&quot;Les eaux thermales et minérales de Tivoli&quot;). Following the damage caused by the bivouacking of Napoleon&#x27;s troops before their departure for Spain, the garden was closed on August 30, 1810.

== &quot;Folie-Richelieu&quot; or Second Tivoli (1810-1826) ==

After the first Tivoli closed, the musician Baneux reopened it in more modest surroundings as the &quot;Folie-Richelieu&quot; or Second Tivoli, located on grounds between n°s 18 and 38 of the Rue de Clichy, extending to the Rue Blanche, on a site first created in 1730 by Marshal Richelieu for his own entertainment, and subsequently belonging to . In 1812, it was reintegrated with the Grand Tivoli site. Part of the land was sold to banker Pierre-Laurent Hainguerlot and subsequently the Spanish legation. The Second Tivoli disappeared in 1825, after an evening party given for Charles X&#x27;s coronation on 7 June. On February 2, 1826, the Boutin heirs sold the land to Jonas-Philip Hagerman and Sylvain Mignon, when it became the &quot;&quot;.

== &quot;Folie-Bouxière&quot; or New Tivoli (1826-1842) ==
Étienne-Gaspard Robert opened the third Tivoli in 1826, which survived until 1842 when the rue Ballu and other streets were constructed. This was a true amusement park with roller coasters, pantomimes, labyrinths, and fireworks prepared by the master artificer Claude Ruggierri. Pigeon shooting, imported from England in 1831, resulted in the death of over 300,000 pigeons.

<doc id="729339" wikidata="Q1351693" url="?curid=729339" title="Snow blower">
<text>A snow blower or snowblower or snow thrower is a machine for removing snow from an area where it is problematic, such as a driveway, sidewalk, roadway, railroad track, ice rink, or runway. The commonly used term &quot;snow blower&quot; is a misnomer, as the snow is moved using an auger or impeller instead of being blown (by air). It can use either electric power (line power or battery) or a gasoline or diesel engine to throw snow to another location or into a truck to be hauled away. This is in contrast with the action of snow plows, which push snow to the front or side. Typically, the snow is discharged to one side, but most snow throwers have a movable chute that can direct snow across the full 180 degrees of motion in front of the appliance.

Snow blowers range from the very small, capable of removing only a few inches (a few more cm) of light snow in an path, to the very large, mounted onto heavy-duty winter service vehicles and capable of moving wide, or wider, swaths of heavy snow up to deep. 

Snow blowers can generally be divided into two classes: single-stage and two-stage. On a single-stage snow blower, the auger (the paddle mechanism visible from the front) pulls snow into the machine and directs it out of a discharge chute. The auger contacts the ground, making single-stage snow blowers unsuitable for use on unpaved surfaces. On a two-stage snow blower, the auger pulls snow into the machine and feeds it into a high-speed impeller, which in turn directs it out of a discharge chute. Two-stage snow blowers can generally handle deeper snow depths than single-stage ones, and because their augers don&#x27;t touch the ground, they can be used on unpaved surfaces.

Depending on the design, snowblowers can be pressed into service throwing other things, such as water.

== History ==

Robert Carr Harris of Maple Green, New Brunswick patented a &quot;Railway Screw Snow Excavator&quot; in 1870. In 1923, Robert E. Cole patented a snowplow that operated by using cutters and a fan to blow snow from a surface. Various other innovations also occurred. However, it is (1876–1946) who is generally credited as the inventor of the first practical snow blower. In 1925 Sicard completed his first prototype, based on a concept he described in 1894. He founded Sicard Industries in Sainte-Thérèse, Quebec and by 1927 his vehicles were in use removing snow from the roadways of the town of Outremont, now a borough of Montreal. His company is now a division of SMI-Snowblast, Inc. of Watertown, New York.

== Safety issues ==

The U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission estimates that each year there are approximately 5,740 snowblower related injuries in the United States which require medical attention. One problem with the design of the snow blower is that snow can build up in the auger, jamming it and stalling the motor. This is complicated by the fact that the auger could deform before applying enough resistance to the motor to turn it off. If the jam is cleared by hand, it is possible for the auger to return to its natural shape suddenly and with great force, possibly injuring the operator. Snow blowers are a leading cause of traumatic hand and finger amputations. The correct procedure is to turn off the engine, disengage the clutch and then clear the jam with a broom handle or other long object. In an effort to improve safety, many manufacturers now include a plastic tool to be used to clear jams, often mounted directly to the snow blower.

Most modern machines mitigate this problem by including a dead man&#x27;s switch to prevent the mechanism from rotating when the operator is not at the controls; these may be mandatory in some jurisdictions.

== Jet-engine snow blowers ==

Jet engines and other gas turbines are used for large scale propelling and melting of snow over rails and roads. These blowers first were used in Russia and Canada in the 1960s, and were later introduced into the U.S. by the Boston Transportation Authority.

The jet engine both melts and blows the snow, clearing the tracks faster than other methods. While offering considerably greater power in a relatively lightweight machine, this method is much more expensive than traditional snow removing methods. In Russia, the high cost is partially offset by utilizing retired military jet engines, such as the Klimov VK-1.

<doc id="729340" wikidata="Q645153" url="?curid=729340" title="Ancaster—Dundas—Flamborough—Westdale (federal electoral district)">
<text>Ancaster—Dundas—Flamborough—Westdale was a federal electoral district in Ontario, Canada, that has been represented in the House of Commons of Canada from 2004 until the electoral boundaries were redrawn for the 2015 election.

The district included the western half of the amalgamated city of Hamilton but did not include any of the city centre. It did, however, include McMaster University, Redeemer University College and many of the neighbourhoods surrounding it.

==History==
The electoral district was created in 2003. 82.9% of the riding came from its predecessor riding, Ancaster—Dundas—Flamborough—Aldershot and 17.1% from Hamilton West. Conversely, Ancaster—Dundas—Flamborough—Aldershot was carved out of Hamilton—Wentworth in 1996. Hamilton—Wentworth was created in 1968 from parts of Wentworth and Hamilton South.

Hamilton—Wentworth initially consisted of:

(a) the eastern part of the City of Hamilton (east of a line drawn from north to south along Parkdale Avenue, west along the Canadian National Railway line, south along Strathearne Avenue, west along Roxborough Avenue, south along Kenilworth Avenue, the brow of the Mountain and Mountain Brow Boulevard, east along Mud Street to the east limit of the City of Hamilton);

(b) the Townships of Ancaster, Binbrook and Saltfleet and the southern part of the Township of Glanford (south of County Suburban Road No. 22)

In 1976, it was redefined to consist of the Townships of Flamborough and Glanbrook, the Towns of Ancaster and Dundas, and the southern part of the City of Hamilton (lying south of a line drawn from west to east along Limeridge Road, south along Mountain Brow Boulevard, north along Red Hill Creek, east along the brow of the Mountain to the east city limit.

In 1987, it was redefined to consist of the towns of Ancaster, Dundas and Flamborough, the township of Glanbrook, and the southern part of the City of Hamilton (lying south of a line drawn from east to west along the brow of the Niagara Escarpment, south along Redhill Creek, north along Mountain Brow Boulevard, west along Limeridge Road to St. Jerome School, west to Garth Street, south along Garth Street, and west along the proposed Mountain Freeway to the west city limit.)

Hamilton—Wentworth was abolished in 1996 when much of the riding became the new Wentworth—Burlington riding, with some parts going to Hamilton Mountain, Hamilton West and Stoney Creek.

Ancaster—Dundas—Flamborough—Aldershot consisted of the now former towns of Ancaster, Dundas and Flamborough plus that part of Burlington contained in the community of Aldershot (which it gained from Halton. Upon the 2003 redistribution, the riding lost Aldershot but gained the Ainslie Wood and Westdale neighbourhoods of Hamilton.

Following the 2012 Redistribution Order, the riding will be dissolved and split between Flamborough—Glanbrook and Hamilton West-Ancaster-Dundas.

<text>The Center for Wooden Boats (CWB) is a museum dedicated to preserving and documenting the maritime history of the Pacific Northwest area of the United States. CWB was founded by Dick Wagner in Seattle in the 1970s and has grown to include three sites; the South Lake Union campus in Lake Union Park, the Northlake Workshop &amp; Warehouse at the north end of Lake Union, and The Center for Wooden Boats at Cama Beach State Park on Camano Island.

== Collection ==

The CWB collection includes more than 170 vessels, mostly small sailboats and rowboats. The boats are divided into a number of sections. The livery fleet includes daysailers, rowboats, and two pedal boats.

The Blanchard Junior Knockabout is the mainstay of CWB&#x27;s rental fleet. These boats were designed and built at the Blanchard Boat Company on Lake Union. They have eight, which are used for teaching and rentals.

<text>The Bowling Green station is a station on the IRT Lexington Avenue Line of the New York City Subway, located at Broadway and Battery Place (at Bowling Green), in the Financial District of Manhattan. It is served by the 4 train at all times and the 5 train at all times except late nights. It is the southern terminal for the 5 train on weekends.

The station opened in 1905 as an extension of the Interborough Rapid Transit (IRT)&#x27;s original subway line to South Ferry. At the time, there was a single island platform with one exit at Battery Park and another in Bowling Green. When the Lexington Avenue Line was expanded to Brooklyn in 1908, some trains continued going to South Ferry, resulting in the creation of a short island platform at the Bowling Green station for the Bowling Green–South Ferry shuttle. The shuttle operated until 1977. During the 1970s, the station was completely renovated, a new exit was built, and a third, side platform was created for northbound trains.

The Bowling Green station contains two island platforms and one side platform. The westernmost island platform, formerly used by the shuttle, has been closed since 1977. The station retains its original head house in Battery Park, which is listed on the National Register of Historic Places and a New York City designated landmark. There are two other exits to Bowling Green, one of which contains an elevator that makes the station compliant with the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990.

== History ==

=== Construction and opening ===

Planning for a subway line in New York City dates to 1864. However, development of what would become the city&#x27;s first subway line did not start until 1894, when the New York State Legislature passed the Rapid Transit Act. The subway plans were drawn up by a team of engineers led by William Barclay Parsons, the Rapid Transit Commission&#x27;s chief engineer. The Rapid Transit Construction Company, organized by John B. McDonald and funded by August Belmont Jr., signed the initial Contract 1 with the Rapid Transit Commission in February 1900, in which it would construct the subway and maintain a 50-year operating lease from the opening of the line. In 1901, the firm of Heins &amp; LaFarge was hired to design the underground stations. Belmont incorporated the Interborough Rapid Transit Company (IRT) in April 1902 to operate the subway.

Several days after Contract 1 was signed, the Board of Rapid Transit Railroad Commissioners instructed Parsons to evaluate the feasibility of extending the subway south to South Ferry, and then to Brooklyn. On January 24, 1901, the Board adopted a route that would extend the subway from City Hall to the Long Island Rail Road (LIRR)&#x27;s Flatbush Avenue terminal station (now known as Atlantic Terminal) in Brooklyn, via the Joralemon Street Tunnel under the East River. Contract 2, which gave the IRT a 35-year lease,was executed between the commission and the Rapid Transit Construction Company on September 11, 1902. Construction of the Joralemon Street Tunnel began at State Street in Manhattan on November 8, 1902. There was to be a station at Bowling Green. South of the station, the main line would slope down to the Joralemon Street Tunnel, while a loop underneath Battery Park would allow southbound trains to serve the South Ferry station and rejoin the northbound track. &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote that the installation of the switches between the loop and the main line presented &quot;an engineering problem of great difficulty&quot;.

Work on the section of line from Ann Street (just south of City Hall) to Bowling Green had not started by September 1903, and McDonald blamed Parsons for the delays. The dispute was quickly resolved, as neither man had realized that the other did not want the project to disturb daytime traffic along Broadway; work started shortly thereafter. During the Bowling Green station&#x27;s construction, workers uncovered and removed some of the original lampposts that had illuminated Bowling Green Park. The tunnel between Ann Street and Bowling Green was nearly complete by July 1904. The Bowling Green station opened on July 10, 1905. The station was originally built with a single island platform; a station head house at the south end, in Battery Park; and a secondary entrance at the northern end of the platform, adjacent to Bowling Green Park. There was as yet no IRT service to Brooklyn, and all Lexington Avenue trains terminated at South Ferry&#x27;s outer-loop platform.

=== Early modifications ===

After the Joralemon Street Tunnel opened in 1908, ticket sales increased at Bowling Green and the IRT&#x27;s other subway stations in Lower Manhattan. Some trains continued to terminate at South Ferry, even during rush hours, while others went to Brooklyn. This service pattern was soon found to be inadequate for the high volume of Brooklyn riders. As a result, in 1908, the New York State Public Service Commission applied for authority to build a second, shorter platform and a third track to the west of the existing island platform. Three months after the Joralemon Street Tunnel opened, construction began on the third track and the western island platform at Bowling Green. Once they were completed in 1909, all rush-hour trains were sent to Brooklyn, with a two-car Bowling Green–South Ferry shuttle train providing service to South Ferry during those times. Even after the IRT Broadway–Seventh Avenue Line local service () began to South Ferry in 1918, the shuttle remained in operation until it was discontinued in 1977 due to budget cuts.

To address overcrowding, in 1909, the New York Public Service Commission proposed lengthening the platforms at stations along the original IRT subway. As part of a modification to the IRT&#x27;s construction contracts made on January 18, 1910, the company was to lengthen station platforms to accommodate ten-car express and six-car local trains. In addition to $1.5 million (equivalent to $ million in ) spent on platform lengthening, $500,000 (equivalent to $ million in ) was spent on building additional entrances and exits. It was anticipated that these improvements would increase capacity by 25 percent. The main island platform at the Bowling Green station was extended to the north. On January 23, 1911, ten-car express trains began running on the East Side Line, and the next day, ten-car express trains began running on the West Side Line. The Lexington Avenue Line north of Grand Central–42nd Street opened on August 1, 1918, and all Joralemon Street Tunnel services were sent via the Lexington Avenue Line.

In Fiscal Year 1937, the platform was extended to the north. This avoided the need to install gap fillers on the curve at the south end of the platform. The city government took over the IRT&#x27;s operations on June 12, 1940. On September 8, 1952, the New York City Board of Transportation made the entrance kiosk at Battery Place and State Street entrance-only instead of exit-only in order to relieve congestion at the station during the evening rush hour. A fare box was installed at the top of the stairway to accommodate the change. The New York City Transit Authority (NYCTA) announced plans in 1956 to add fluorescent lights above the edges of the station&#x27;s platforms. The lights were installed the next year.

NYCTA architect Harold Sandifer prepared plans in the late 1950s for a modern-style station house within Bowling Green Park, which would contain a brick-and-aluminum facade, along with planters containing dwarf Japanese yew trees. The NYCTA approved the project in February 1958, awarding the construction contract to the Lenmar Construction Company at a cost of $87,200. The next year, the new station house in Bowling Green Park was completed, with new stairways to the platform. Later in 1959, contracts were awarded to extend the platforms at Bowling Green, Wall Street, Fulton Street, Canal Street, Spring Street, Bleecker Street, Astor Place, Grand Central, 86th Street and 125th Street to to accommodate ten-car trains. The NYCTA approved a proposal in September 1960 to install an experimental token-vending machine, which would dispense advertisements along with tokens, at the Bowling Green station. Work on the platform extension was still underway in 1962, and the project was substantially completed by November 1965.

=== 1970s renovation ===
As early as the mid-1960s, local civic group Downtown-Local Manhattan Association had raised concerns that the Bowling Green station was severely overcrowded during rush hours. The association commissioned a study of the neighborhood, which recommended that the station&#x27;s platform be extended and that its entrances be widened. In 1970, the New York City Planning Commission considered transferring the Custom House&#x27;s unused air rights to 1 Broadway, where the Walter Kidde Company planned to build a 50-story skyscraper. In exchange, the Walter Kidde Company would have been required to pay for numerous improvements to the surrounding area. Local civic groups also proposed connecting the station to the basements of skyscrapers in the area, as well as to the then-separate South Ferry and Whitehall Street stations and a planned terminal for the Second Avenue Subway. By the early 1970s, the station had 14 million passengers per year.

On March 5, 1972, the Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA) announced that the station would be renovated and expanded, doubling the capacity of the station. The work was done in conjunction with the renovation of Bowling Green Park, which was rebuilt to conform with its appearance in the late 18th century. A new northbound side platform was built to alleviate congestion on the narrow island platform, which would then only be used by downtown trains. Stairs and a new mezzanine were built below track level, and a new exit with modern escalators was installed just south of Bowling Green. The street at the southern end of Bowling Green, in front of the Custom House, was converted into a pedestrian plaza. The new mezzanine, excavated under Bowling Green Park using a cut-and-cover method, was connected to the platform and street levels with ten new escalators. The existing subway entrance at the west gate of the park was removed, providing more open space in the park. These capacity improvements were made to accommodate increased ridership resulting from the construction of additional office buildings in Lower Manhattan, including the World Trade Center. The station lost its original mosaic tiles, which were replaced with bright red tiles, similar to those at 49th Street and the under-construction stations on the 63rd Street lines and Archer Avenue lines. In addition, the station&#x27;s token booths were renovated.

Work was initially set to be finished in 1974. In July 1975, it was announced that the project&#x27;s completion had been delayed to March 1976. In December 1976, a spokesperson for the New York City Transit Authority (NYCTA) said that work on the project would not be completed until early 1977. The southern headhouse entrance was closed for six months beginning in April 1978 as it was being rehabilitated. The renovation was completed in 1978 at a cost of $16.8 million. Funding for the project was provided from the NYCTA&#x27;s capital budget. The Bowling Green station&#x27;s renovation was supposed to be the first of numerous large-scale station reconstructions in the New York City Subway system.

At midnight on February 13, 1977, service on the Bowling Green–South Ferry shuttle was discontinued, and the platform and the track used by the shuttle were abandoned. The service was discontinued as part of a three-phase cut in service that the NYCTA had begun in 1975 to reduce its operating deficits. Despite the discontinuation of the service, the shuttle platform was renovated, receiving new tiling, signage, and refinished flooring. Some time after 1983, a fence was installed on the eastern edge of the island platform, which had been used to board trains prior to the opening of the side platform in 1978.

=== Subsequent changes ===
In June 1999, MetroCard vending machines were installed in this station as part of the second batch of the fare-payment technology&#x27;s installation. Following the September 11 attacks in 2001, members of the public expressed concerns that the station could be difficult to evacuate in emergencies due to its convoluted layout.

In early 2006, work began to make the station fully compliant with the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990. The cobblestones around the station entrance near Bowling Green were replaced with granite pavers, an ADA-compliant path was constructed to Bowling Green Park, and a new glass canopy was installed over this entrance. The canopy, which was designed by Dattner Architects in 2003, consists of a curved steel and glass with stainless steel ribs, and is supported by a granite base. The unused shuttle platform was also walled off between 2001 and 2002. Work to install the canopy was scheduled to begin in late October 2006. In May 2007, the replacement of the cobblestones and installation of the glass canopy were completed. The elevators opened to the public on July 9, 2007, and a formal opening ceremony was hosted the following day.

The MTA added a hearing induction loop for passengers on the northbound platform, the first such installation in the subway system, during a pilot program in 2020. The MTA announced in December 2021 that it would install wide-aisle fare gates for disabled passengers at five subway stations, including Bowling Green, by mid-2022. The implementation of these fare gates was delayed; none of the wide-aisle fare gates had been installed by early 2023. The MTA announced in 2024 that it would replace the station&#x27;s existing waist-high turnstiles with taller, wide-aisle turnstiles. According to a study conducted by New York University researchers and published in 2024, the Bowling Green station had some of the highest particulate matter pollution levels of any subway station in New York City.

==Station layout==
The station, located at Broadway and Battery Place, is served by the 4 train at all times and by the 5 train at all times except late nights. The station is between to the north and in Brooklyn to the south; it is the southern terminus for the during weekends and mid-weekday evenings. The Bowling Green station has three tracks and three platforms, of which two tracks and two platforms are in service. The center island platform serves southbound and terminating trains, and a slightly offset side platform to the east serves northbound trains. A fence is located along the eastern edge of the island platform, preventing northbound trains from releasing passengers onto the island platform. The side platform and the wall facing the downtown track have orange brick tiles. Both platforms have circular platform columns painted in beige. The platforms also have cooling fans.

An abandoned and walled-off island platform and track on the west side of the station were formerly used by the Bowling Green–South Ferry shuttle, which traveled to the inner platform at South Ferry. This platform was connected to the island platform with an underpass at its northern end.

Escalators and stairs connect both platforms to the mezzanine below track level, where free transfers can be made between the two platforms. On the uptown platform, pairs of escalators and staircases lead to the mezzanine, while on the downtown platform, alternating staircases and escalators descend to the mezzanine. The Bowling Green station is fully wheelchair-accessible under the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 and contains two elevators. One connects street level, the main northbound fare control, and the southbound fare control area below the platforms and tracks. The other connects the Brooklyn-bound platform with the fare control area below the tracks.

There are two banks of turnstiles on the north and south sides of the mezzanine, which is outside fare control. A pair of escalators and a staircase leads from the eastern end of the mezzanine to an upper mezzanine, which contains the token booth, and a bank of turnstiles, which leads directly onto the uptown side platform.

=== Track layout ===
South of the station, the tracks diverge into two sets. One set (the inner tracks) enters the Joralemon Street Tunnel to travel to Brooklyn, sloping down at a gradient of just over three percent. This route is used by the 4 train at all times and the 5 train on weekdays until 8:45 pm. The outer tracks continue to the closed South Ferry inner loop station, which is used by the 5 train when it short turns at this station during weekends and mid-weekday evenings.

==Exits==

The station has three street stairs, an elevator, a set of escalators, and an original control house (also known as the head house). These exits are clustered in three separate locations.

The eastern end of the upper mezzanine, toward the center of the station, leads to a pair of staircases and an up escalator that leads to Bowling Green plaza. There is a glass-canopied stairs-and-escalator entrance in front of the Alexander Hamilton U.S. Custom House, just around the corner from two entrances to the Whitehall Street–South Ferry station on the BMT Broadway Line (which are set into the building&#x27;s eastern elevation).

At the eastern end of the lower mezzanine, a pair of escalators and a staircase lead to an intermediate level. This, in turn, leads to a pair of staircases on the north side of Battery Place between Greenwich Street and Broadway, outside 1 Broadway.

A staircase, at the southern end of the island platform, leads to a fare control area in the restored control house. which consists of a pair of low turnstiles at the south end, and two high entry/exit turnstiles flanking the staircase down to the platform.

=== Control house===
At the south end of the station is the original head house, known as the Bowling Green IRT Control House or Battery Park Control House, on the west side of State Street south of Broadway. This subway entrance was designed by Heins &amp; LaFarge and built in 1905 on the west side of State Street, across from the Alexander Hamilton U.S. Custom House. It was built as one of several station houses on the original IRT; similar station houses were built at 72nd, 96th, 103rd, and 116th Streets. The control house is listed on the National Register of Historic Places and is a New York City designated landmark. Although most of the original subway&#x27;s entry points had steel and glass kiosks (such as at Astor Place), important stations like Bowling Green were marked with a brick and stone control house, so called because they helped control the passenger flow.

The facade is made of yellow brick, with limestone banding and triglyphs at its tops, a base of granite, and a gable roof. The doorways to the control house are located on the north and south of the structure; the northern doorway has an elaborate pediment above it, and the southern doorway has been extended with three exit doors. Inside, the control house has turnstiles at street level and a single stair down to the extreme southern end of the island platform.

The Bowling Green station has lightboxes with rotating content. Since 2018, the exhibition has been &quot;Daily Voyage&quot;, featuring pictures taken by Glen DiCrocco of regular commuters on the Staten Island Ferry. Some of these photos can be seen on the MTA&#x27;s Flickr account as well.

<doc id="729369" wikidata="Q5163308" url="?curid=729369" title="Consolidated Works">
<text>Consolidated Works was a &quot;multi-disciplinary contemporary arts center&quot; located successively in two former warehouses in the South Lake Union neighborhood of Seattle, Washington, USA, just west of what would be considered the Cascade neighborhood within South Lake Union. It incorporated an art gallery, theater, cinema, and music/dance/lecture hall, as well as studio spaces for artists and a bar and lounge.

==Opening and temporary premises==
The center was founded in 1997 by Matthew Richter. Richter had previously worked at Seattle&#x27;s alternative newspaper &quot;The Stranger&quot; as theatre editor. Funding came from grants, donations, and corporate sponsorship, and &quot;The Stranger&quot; also agreed to provide advertising for events at ConWorks in exchange for storage space at its warehouse. Richter became the center&#x27;s Executive Director, with Meg Shiffler becoming Director of Visual Art until 2003.

The center opened in 1999, working from temporary premises on Terry Avenue for three years. ConWorks&#x27; renovated facility at 500 Boren Avenue North opened on 13 September 2002. The refit of the warehouse, built in 1948, cost almost half a million dollars.

==Mission statement==
Consolidated Works&#x27; aim was to give all the art forms equal billing - to be &quot;neither a theater with art in the lobby nor a gallery with a stage in back. It is not supposed to be a cinema that plays music or a music hall that shows films&quot;. To this end, the billing of Consolidated Works focuses on high-profile artists like Andy Warhol alongside emerging talent, primarily from the Pacific Northwest. 
Consolidated Works has a policy of encouraging young creative professionals, including an Artist-in-Residence program.

As well as mounting its own productions and exhibitions, the center also hosted touring events - for example, the &quot;Curiously Strong&quot; contemporary art program (sponsored by Altoids) and the popular &quot;14/48&quot; theater show (where 14 short plays are written and produced in 48 hours, begun in 1997). Richter&#x27;s vision was one of experimentalism, and he argued that &quot;if the quality of the programming was always of a strong finished caliber, then we weren&#x27;t doing our job right&quot;.

==Restructuring in 2005==
On February 8, 2005, the board of Consolidated Works dismissed Richter, the co-founder and executive director. The president of the board, Robb Krieg, did not reveal the reasons for the firing.

Richter&#x27;s dismissal caused consternation in the Seattle arts community. A 36-signature petition was presented to the board, signed by senior figures in other local institutions, and all of ConWorks&#x27; creative staff resigned.

In September 2005 the board announced that Corey Pearlstein, a producer with a performing arts background had been named to the position. At the time of this writing, the company was preparing to open a major world premiere by Seattle-based, internationally known kinetic sculptor Trimpin.

From &quot;The Stranger&quot;, July 29: &quot;[Conworks] announced that it would not renew its lease with Vulcan, Inc. because (a) the building requires seismic improvements and (b) Vulcan &#x27;will require a nine-month exit clause to permit it to develop our South Lake Union lot if an opportunity arises.&#x27; ConWorks has begun looking for new accommodations.&quot;

==Closure in 2006==
On December 7, 2006, the &quot;Seattle Times&quot; reported that ConWorks would close by the end of the year.

<doc id="729379" wikidata="Q792607" url="?curid=729379" title="Axon hillock">
<text>The axon hillock is a specialized part of the cell body (or soma) of a neuron that connects to the axon. It can be identified using light microscopy from its appearance and location in a neuron and from its sparse distribution of Nissl substance.

The axon hillock is the last site in the soma where membrane potentials propagated from synaptic inputs are summated before being transmitted to the axon. For many years, it was believed that the axon hillock was the usual site of initiation of action potentials—the trigger zone. It is now thought that the earliest site of action potential initiation is at the axonal initial segment: just between the peak of the axon hillock and the initial (unmyelinated) segment of the axon. However, the positive point, at which the action potential starts, varies between cells. It can also be altered by hormonal stimulation of the neuron, or by second messenger effects of neurotransmitters.

The axon hillock also delineates separate membrane domains between the cell body and axon.
This allows for localization of membrane proteins to either the axonal or somal side of the cell.

==Structure==
The axon hillock and initial segment have a number of specialized properties that make them capable of action potential generation, including adjacency to the axon and a much higher density of voltage-gated ion channels than is found in the rest of the cell body.
In dorsal root ganglion cells, the cell body is thought to have approximately 1 voltage-gated sodium channel per square micrometre, while the axon hillock and initial segment of the axon have about ~100–200 voltage-gated sodium channels per square micrometre; in comparison, the nodes of Ranvier along the axon are thought to have ~1000–2000 such channels per square micrometre.
This clustering of voltage-gated ion channels is a consequence of plasma-membrane and cytoskeletal associating proteins such as ankyrin.

In electrophysiological models, the axon hillock is included with the initial segment of the axon where membrane potentials propagated from synaptic inputs to the dendrites or cell body are summed.

==Function==

Both inhibitory postsynaptic potentials (IPSPs) and excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EPSPs) are summed in the axon hillock and once a triggering threshold is exceeded, an action potential propagates through the rest of the axon (and &quot;backwards&quot; towards the dendrites as seen in neural backpropagation). The triggering is due to positive feedback between highly crowded voltage-gated sodium channels, which are present at the critical density at the axon hillock (and nodes of ranvier) but not in the soma.

In its resting state, a neuron is polarized, with its inside at about −70 mV relative to its surroundings. When an excitatory neurotransmitter is released by the presynaptic neuron and binds to the postsynaptic dendritic spines, ligand-gated ion channels open, allowing sodium ions to enter the cell. This may make the postsynaptic membrane depolarized (less negative). This depolarization will travel towards the axon hillock, diminishing exponentially with time and distance. If several such events occur in a short time, the axon hillock may become sufficiently depolarized for the voltage-gated sodium channels to open. This initiates an action potential that then propagates down the axon.

As sodium enters the cell, the cell membrane potential becomes more positive, which activates even more sodium channels in the membrane. The sodium influx eventually overtakes the potassium efflux (via the two-pore-domain potassium channels or &quot;leak channels&quot;, initiating a positive feedback loop (rising phase). At around +40 mV, the voltage-gated sodium channels begin to close (peak phase) and the voltage-gated potassium channels begin to open, moving potassium down its electrochemical gradient and out of the cell (falling phase).

The potassium channels exhibit a delayed reaction to the membrane repolarisation, and, even after the resting potential is achieved, some potassium continues to flow out, resulting in an intracellular fluid that is more negative than the resting potential, and during which no action potential can begin (undershoot phase/refractory period). This undershoot phase ensures that the action potential propagates down the axon and not back up it.

Once this initial action potential is initiated, principally at the axon hillock, it propagates down the length of the axon. Under normal conditions, the action potential would attenuate very quickly due to the porous nature of the cell membrane. To ensure faster and more efficient propagation of action potentials, the axon is myelinated. Myelin, a derivative of cholesterol, acts as an insulating sheath and ensures that the signal cannot escape through the ion or leak channels. There are, nevertheless, gaps in the insulation (nodes of Ranvier), which boost the signal strength. As the action potential reaches a node of Ranvier, it depolarises the cell membrane. As the cell membrane is depolarised, the voltage-gated sodium channels open and sodium rushes in, triggering a fresh new action potential.

<text>The Nevins Street station is an express station on the IRT Eastern Parkway Line of the New York City Subway. Located at the intersection of Nevins Street, Flatbush Avenue, and Fulton Street in Downtown Brooklyn, it is served by the 2 and 4 trains at all times, the 3 train all times except late nights, and the 5 train on weekdays only.

== History ==

=== Construction and opening ===
Planning for a subway line in New York City dates to 1864. However, development of what would become the city&#x27;s first subway line did not start until 1894, when the New York State Legislature passed the Rapid Transit Act. The subway plans were drawn up by a team of engineers led by William Barclay Parsons, the Rapid Transit Commission&#x27;s chief engineer. The Rapid Transit Construction Company, organized by John B. McDonald and funded by August Belmont Jr., signed the initial Contract 1 with the Rapid Transit Commission in February 1900, in which it would construct the subway and maintain a 50-year operating lease from the opening of the line. In 1901, the firm of Heins &amp; LaFarge was hired to design the underground stations. Belmont incorporated the Interborough Rapid Transit Company (IRT) in April 1902 to operate the subway.

Several days after Contract 1 was signed, the Board of Rapid Transit Railroad Commissioners instructed Parsons to evaluate the feasibility of extending the subway south to South Ferry, and then to Brooklyn. On January 24, 1901, the Board adopted a route that would extend the subway from City Hall to the Long Island Rail Road (LIRR)&#x27;s Flatbush Avenue terminal station (now known as Atlantic Terminal) in Brooklyn, via the Joralemon Street Tunnel under the East River. Contract 2, which gave the IRT a 35-year lease,was executed between the commission and the Rapid Transit Construction Company on September 11, 1902. Work under Fulton Street and Flatbush Avenue in Brooklyn commenced in April 1904.

The IRT line in Brooklyn had been proposed as a two-track line under Fulton Street, expanding to three tracks under Flatbush Avenue. Belmont submitted a revised proposal to the Rapid Transit Commission in April 1905 to widen the line to four tracks. The station at Flatbush Avenue and Fulton Street (now the Nevins Street station) would be redesigned as a two-level station with express and local trains on separate levels. Work was halted until October 1905, at which point two tracks had been added, making four under Fulton Street and five under Flatbush Avenue. The additional trackways were added outside the trackways already set in place. Under the 1905 redesign, numerous provisions were made for connections to future routes, including spurs via Lafayette Avenue, Fourth Avenue, and the Manhattan Bridge. In the area around the Nevins Street station, which was partially constructed as a local station on a three track subway, a new lower level was added underpinning the structure that had been built. The lower level had one trackway and platform in the station, with two connections on each side, all built at great cost under existing work, but none of it was ever used.

The Joralemon Street Tunnel opened in January 1908 along with the Borough Hall station, the first underground subway station in Brooklyn. The Nevins Street station opened when the line was extended three stops to Atlantic Avenue on May 1, 1908. The stations&#x27; opening was marked with a parade and a poem praising Belmont. The extension relieved congestion at the overcrowded Borough Hall station, though trains from Atlantic Avenue were already crowded by the time they reached Borough Hall. According to &quot;The New York Times&quot;, the extension was &quot;regarded as of the utmost importance&quot; because it connected the IRT with the LIRR for the first time. Initially, the station was served by express trains along both the West Side (now the Broadway–Seventh Avenue Line to Van Cortlandt Park–242nd Street) and East Side (now the Lenox Avenue Line). Lenox local trains to 145th Street served the station during late nights.

=== Later years ===
As part of the Dual Contracts, approved in 1913, the New York City Public Service Commission planned to split the original IRT system into three segments: two north-south lines, carrying through trains over the Lexington Avenue and Broadway–Seventh Avenue Lines, and an east–west shuttle under 42nd Street. This would form a roughly H-shaped system. The Broadway–Seventh Avenue Line would split into two branches south of Chambers Street, one of which would turn eastward through Lower Manhattan, run under the East River via a new Clark Street Tunnel, and connect with the existing Contract 2 IRT Brooklyn Line at Borough Hall. The Lexington Avenue Line north of Grand Central–42nd Street opened on August 1, 1918, and all Brooklyn Line services were sent via the Lexington Avenue Line. This was followed by the Clark Street Tunnel on April 15, 1919, which doubled the number of IRT trains that could travel between Manhattan and Brooklyn.

When the Eastern Parkway Line was extended east of Atlantic Avenue in 1920, the Joralemon Street Tunnel services became express services, while the Broadway–Seventh Avenue Line services ran local on the Eastern Parkway Line. Although the Eastern Parkway Line&#x27;s express tracks already existed, they previously had been used only for storage. The tracks were reconfigured so that Eastern Parkway express trains could no longer stop at the Hoyt Street station, the next stop west. Also in 1920, a project to extend the platforms at the Nevins Street station from to to accommodate ten-car trains was completed.

The New York City Board of Transportation announced plans in November 1949 to extend platforms at several IRT stations, including Nevins Street, to accommodate all doors on ten-car trains. Although ten-car trains already operated on the line, the rear car could not open its doors at the station because the platforms were so short. Funding for the platform extensions was included in the city&#x27;s 1950 capital budget. The New York City Transit Authority (NYCTA) announced plans in 1956 to add fluorescent lights above the edges of the station&#x27;s platforms.

In 1981, the Metropolitan Transportation Authority listed the station among the 69 most deteriorated stations in the subway system. In April 1993, the New York State Legislature agreed to give the MTA $9.6 billion for capital improvements. Some of the funds would be used to renovate nearly one hundred New York City Subway stations, including Nevins Street.

== Station layout ==

The station has two island platforms, situated between the express and local tracks in each direction. The and stop here at all times; the stops here at all times except late nights, and the stops here only on weekdays during the day. The 2 and 3 run on the local tracks, while the 4 and 5 run on the express tracks. The next stop to the north is Hoyt Street for local trains and Borough Hall for express trains. The next stop to the south for all service is Atlantic Avenue–Barclays Center. There are switches between this station and Atlantic Avenue used by the 4 at night when it runs local.

A fifth track once existed between the two express tracks. The fifth track was removed in 1956. Original plans called for this to be a local station on a three-track line, but before it opened, the two outer local tracks were added. Fare control is in an upper mezzanine, with a crossunder via part of an unused lower-level platform. Next to this platform is a single unused trackway under the southbound local track.

The underpass between the main platforms is the only portion of the lower level that has ever been used. Because the station was designed as a local station with side platforms, it is too close to street level for a mezzanine over the tracks. The stairs up lead to two separate fare control mezzanines located over the platforms only, with stairs up to the street. The only way between platforms inside the station is the underpass.

In the station is a &quot;Nevins St.&quot; mosaic. The mezzanine walls feature a mosaic frieze by Anton von Dalen, installed in 1997 and entitled &quot;Work &amp; Nature&quot;. The mosaic is 14 inches by 83 feet along both walls of the mezzanine. The work is in the tones of soft blue, green, and ochre, like the original platform mosaics. It features stenciled silhouettes in black of a woman operating a sewing machine, a mother taking care of a child, a man planting a tree, an architect reading a blueprint, a female executive addressing a meeting, and famous musician Furry Lewis. All of these characters symbolize, according to the artist, &quot;pride, dignity, and beauty surrounding all work&quot;.

===Exits===
The station has two exits to each side of Flatbush Avenue east of Nevins Street. The northeastern side&#x27;s entrances lead to the northbound platform while the southwestern side&#x27;s entrances lead to the southbound platform.

===Provisions for other lines===
This unused trackway was part of several plans for connecting the line to other proposed lines. At its north end, this trackway splits from the southbound local track just south of Hoyt Street, and starts heading downgrade. The track was never laid. At the curve in the subway from Fulton Street to Flatbush Avenue, the trackway curves under the southbound local track, and is joined by another unused trackway heading north along Flatbush Avenue for a proposed Manhattan Bridge connection (which was later built for the BMT, though this connection may have still been planned when that line was built, as the DeKalb Avenue station was designed to allow for it). After the lower Nevins Street platform, a trackway splits to the east for a subway under Lafayette Avenue; this was later built as part of the IND Fulton Street and Crosstown Lines. Just beyond this split, at Lafayette Avenue, the trackway was cut by the IND when the IND was built from 1929 to 1937. On the other side, it rises again to merge with the southbound local track in the midst of the complicated switch layout just north of Atlantic Avenue – Barclays Center. Between this merge and Atlantic Avenue is another unused trackway, splitting from the local track towards a subway under Fourth Avenue (later built as the BMT Fourth Avenue Line). This trackway and another trackway (both built for the same proposed subway) end at the same level, under Fourth Avenue, just west of the Pacific Street station on the current BMT Fourth Avenue Line and a few feet higher.

On the northbound side, the connection provided by the lower level trackway would have been along the northbound local track (which was not in the original plans). The trackway on this side begins by curving from Fourth Avenue under the line. The place it used to rise is covered, as the trackway beyond that point is now used for the northbound local track. The ramp was covered in July 1963, and was made into a level trackway. This ramp was supposed to be northbound trackway of the proposed IRT Fourth Avenue Subway (before the BRT/BMT was built). The northbound local and express tracks were rearranged by November 1963.

Before Nevins Street, there is a bellmouth for the proposed Lafayette Avenue subway that merges into the northbound local track. After Nevins Street, at the curve, there is a short section of wall with no columns, that could be opened up. This was also a proposed connection to the Manhattan Bridge.

Just north of Atlantic Avenue – Barclays Center is another unused trackway, merging into the northbound local track from the LIRR&#x27;s Atlantic Terminal. A trackway from the southbound tracks existed until 1911, when the platforms at Atlantic Avenue were lengthened.

For a time in the early 1960s, a false wall was installed to seal the ramp to the Nevins Street lower level. The false wall was taken down at a later date for unknown reasons. The Nevins Street lower-level platform had, over the years, become a storage area for various work projects, and until Nevins Street was renovated, the rest of the lower platform was visible from the crossunder. A permanent tile wall now blocks off the lower platform, access to which is via a cellar-type door at the north end of each platform, as well as doors from the crossunder.

<doc id="729384" wikidata="Q880670" url="?curid=729384" title="Marcus Morton">
<text>Marcus Morton (1784 – February 6, 1864) was an American lawyer, jurist, and politician from Taunton, Massachusetts. He served two terms as the governor of Massachusetts and several months as Acting Governor following the death in 1825 of William Eustis. He served for 15 years as an associate justice of the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court, all the while running unsuccessfully as a Democrat for governor. He finally won the 1839 election, acquiring exactly the number of votes required for a majority win over Edward Everett. After losing the 1840 and 1841 elections, he was elected in a narrow victory in 1842.

The Massachusetts Democratic Party was highly factionalized, which contributed to Morton&#x27;s long string of defeats. His brief periods of ascendancy, however, resulted in no substantive Democratic-supported reforms, since the dominant Whigs reversed most of the changes enacted during his terms. An opponent of the extension of slavery, he split with longtime friend John C. Calhoun over that issue, and eventually left the party for the Free Soil movement. He was considered by Martin Van Buren as a potential vice presidential running mate in 1848.

==Early years==
Morton was born in East Freetown, Massachusetts in 1784, the only son of Nathaniel and Mary (Cary) Morton. Sources report his day of birth to be either February 19 or December 19. Morton&#x27;s gravestone uses the February 19 date. His father was a farmer who was politically active, serving for a time on the Governor&#x27;s Council. Morton received his early education at home, and was placed at age fourteen in the academy of Reverend Calvin Chaddock at Rochester, Massachusetts.

In 1801 Morton was admitted to Brown University with the sophomore class, and graduated in 1804. During his time at Brown he came to adopt Jeffersonian ideas, making an outspoken anti-Federalist speech at his commencement. He then read law at Taunton for a year in the office of Judge Seth Padelford, after which he entered Tapping Reeve&#x27;s law school in Litchfield, Connecticut. There he was a schoolmate of John C. Calhoun, who served as a mentor and friend for many years. Moving back to Taunton, he was admitted to the Norfolk County bar in 1807 and opened a practice. In December of that year he married Charlotte Hodges, with whom he had twelve children. He later received honorary law degrees from Brown (1826), and Harvard (1840).

==Entry into politics==
Morton honed his partisan skills in Taunton, frequently speaking out against Federalism, which dominated Massachusetts politics. In 1808 Governor James Sullivan offered him the post of district attorney for Bristol County, but he demurred because the office was still held by his teacher, Judge Padelford. He did, however, accept the post when it was offered to him in 1811 by Elbridge Gerry.

Morton was nominated by the Democratic-Republicans to run for Congress in 1814, but lost by a wide margin to Laban Wheaton in what was then seen as a strongly Federalist district. Two years later he was, to some surprise, victorious in a rematch with Wheaton despite Federalist strength in other races. Morton was reelected in 1818, but narrowly lost to Francis Baylies in 1820. In Congress he supported Andrew Jackson, whose actions in the Seminole Wars were being scrutinized, and opposed the Missouri Compromise. Morton was personally opposed to slavery, but did not often let it inform his political decisions until later in life; he preferred instead to focus his efforts on other priorities. Despite this, his written statements on slavery were to become a matter of contentious debate when party factions within the Democratic Party sought to use them against him in the 1840s. In these early years he was also a proponent of free trade; like many Massachusetts politicians, he later adopted a strong protectionist stance, calling the early period &quot;the lamest ... of my life&quot;.

==Supreme Judicial Court and runs for governor==

In 1823 Morton was elected to the Massachusetts Governor&#x27;s Council, and the following year was elected Lieutenant Governor, serving under Republican Governor William Eustis. When Eustis died in office in February 1825, Morton served as acting governor until the election a few months later. Since the 1824 election had virtually eliminated the Federalist Party as a force in the state, Federalists and wealthy Republicans were coalescing into what became known as the National Republican Party (predecessor to the Whigs). Morton disagreed with this trend (calling the National Republicans &quot;aristocratic&quot;), preferring Jacksonian-style Democracy instead, and refused to stand for election as governor in 1825. He was, however, prevailed to run again for lieutenant governor, and he won the post, serving under Levi Lincoln Jr., who had been nominated by both the Republicans and a rump Federalist coalition. Morton was unhappy with what he termed Whig elitism (he accused Lincoln in 1830 of being a &quot;tool of monied aristocracy&quot;), and resigned the lieutenant governorship. Lincoln promptly appointed Morton as an associate justice of the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court (SJC), a post he would hold until 1840.

===Jurisprudence===

Morton was the only Democrat on the SJC, all the other justices having been appointed by Federalists. Despite this, Morton wrote a few notable decisions. He wrote the court&#x27;s decision in &quot;Charles River Bridge v. Warren Bridge&quot;, a case that eventually went to the United States Supreme Court. The plaintiffs were proprietors of the Charles River Bridge, a toll bridge constructed between Boston and Charlestown in 1786, and the defendants were proprietors of a competing bridge to which the state had issued a charter in 1828. The plaintiffs argued that the defendant&#x27;s charter infringed on their charter, in which they claimed the state granted them an exclusive right to control the crossing. The SJC split 2–2, and dismissed the case so that it could be heard by the Supreme Court. Morton wrote the decision favoring the defendants, pointing out that if the state was going to grant an exclusive right, it had to do so explicitly, and it had not done so in this case. This reasoning was upheld in 1837 by the Taney Supreme Court.

In 1838 Morton was the lone dissenter in &quot;Commonwealth v. Kneeland&quot;, the last time in the nation that someone was convicted of blasphemy. Abner Kneeland, a vitriolic former Universalist minister turned pantheist, had made statements Christians found offensive. Convicted by the trial court, Kneeland had appealed, and two more highly politicized trials ended in hung juries before the conviction was upheld in appeals. The full SJC took up the case in March 1836. Kneeland, representing himself, argued that the statements he made did not rise to level specified by the statute, and argued that the statute violated the First Amendment to the United States Constitution. Chief Justice Lemuel Shaw, writing for the court majority, found that Kneeland&#x27;s speech satisfied the legal definition of blasphemy, and by narrow construction found that the law did not violate the state constitution&#x27;s protections of free speech and religion. In his dissent Morton argued for a more liberal reading of the Article 2 of the state constitution (which addressed religious freedoms), and argued that every person &quot;has a constitutional right to discuss the subject of God, to affirm or deny his existence. I cannot agree that a man may be punished for wilfully doing what he has a legal right to do.&quot; Governor Edward Everett refused to pardon Kneeland, who served sixty days in prison. The case is now one of the most frequently cited American cases on blasphemy.

===Perennial candidate for governor===
The political situation in the late 1820s and 1830s was quite fluid. The Democrats were highly factionalized, with three major groups vying with one another for control of the party apparatus. Morton&#x27;s support base consisted mainly of farmers, industrial and shipyard laborers, and recent immigrants. A second faction, dominated by Theodore Lyman, consisted of merchants and wealthy coastal interests opposed to Whig interests. The third faction, which successfully controlled the party apparatus in its early years, was headed by David Henshaw, who had split from the John Quincy Adams camp over political aspects of the bridge controversy. Henshaw was the principal party organizing force, while Morton became a perennial gubernatorial candidate, running for the office each year from 1828 to 1843. The party was supported in its organizing efforts by Morton&#x27;s friend John Calhoun, who served as Vice President under Adams and Jackson. Morton generally did no overt campaigning, sensitive to maintaining the appearance of neutrality as a judge.
Morton was never able to make significant electoral inroads on Lincoln&#x27;s majorities in the years the latter held the governor&#x27;s seat (1825–1834). This was principally because opposition to the National Republicans was fragmented, exemplified by the Free Bridge Party and the Anti-Masonic Party, the latter of which in particular siphoned off significant numbers of Democratic votes in the 1832 election. Despite attempts by both the National Republicans and the Democrats to woo the Anti-Masons into their fold, neither was able to. Morton was mildly anti-Mason, but Henshaw was a Freemason, and Morton apparently did not recognize the potential power of the Anti-Masons despite their significant electoral showing. As a result, the Democrats lacked the voting strength to unseat the National Republicans. The Democrats were also splintered in 1832 and 1833, when the Working Men&#x27;s Party drew support by attacking both of the larger parties for their lack of attention to labor issues. Morton was sufficiently disheartened by his repeated failures that he considered abandoning his quest for the governorship in 1832; Henshaw convinced him to soldier on. In 1831 Morton broke ranks with his friend John Calhoun over the latter&#x27;s support for nullification, which Morton believed was based on his support for slavery. This also caused fractures in the Massachusetts Democratic Party, with Henshaw siding with Calhoun and the southern Democrats.

The closest Morton came to victory before 1839 was in the 1833 election, when Lincoln stepped down. In a four-way race involving Worcester Congressman John Davis (running as a National Republican) and John Quincy Adams (running as an Anti-Mason) as his principal opponents (along with a Working Men&#x27;s candidate), none of the candidates received the required majority. The state legislature chose Davis, the largest vote-getter, after Adams withdrew in Davis&#x27;s favor.
By the late 1830s activists for the abolition of slavery had grown into a potent political force in the state. Both Whigs and Democrats (including Morton) had avoided the issue in pursuit of other political objectives, but abolitionists began regularly requesting formal statements from candidates for office on the subject. Morton was known to be personally opposed to slavery, and this gained him votes in the 1837 and 1838 elections despite the vacillating answers he gave to such requests. His opponent in those elections, Edward Everett, was also opposed to slavery, but had in 1826 made a speech sympathetic to the rights of slaveholders, which was used against him. Morton&#x27;s faction within the Democratic Party also gained strength due to the organizational skill of historian George Bancroft, and successful moves spearheaded by Morton to change the methods by which lower-level party leaders were chosen. David Henshaw resigned from the politically important post as the collector of the Port of Boston in 1837, starting a struggle within the party for this valuable patronage plum. Morton was one of several potential recipients, but eventually dropped out, suggesting it go instead to George Bancroft. Bancroft, from the western part of the state, attracted support from the Working Men into the Democratic fold.

==Governor==

In the 1839 election, an unrelated issue came up that finally gave Morton a victory. The Whig legislature had passed a bill promoted by temperance activists that banned the sale of liquor in quantities less than ; this effectively outlawed service over a bar. The bill was seen by many as an instance of class elitism by the Whigs. The vote was so close that a recount was performed, and ballots were carefully scrutinized. One ballot counted for Morton contained the scrawl &quot;Maccus Mattoon&quot;; despite efforts by Whig partisans to deny that the writer intended to vote for Morton, no person with that name was found anywhere in the state. Everett graciously refused to persist in contesting the balloting, and Morton was certified the winner with 51,034 votes (exactly one more vote than half of all votes cast) to 50,725 for Everett with another 307 votes being scattered.
With a hostile Whig-dominated legislature, Morton&#x27;s reform agenda went nowhere. Proposals such as reductions in the poll tax and the number of capital crimes were defeated, but the Democrats were able to introduce some fiscal discipline and produced the first budget surplus in some years. The Whigs attacked his proposals as poor economic policy, and regrouped to focus on defeating him in 1840. They convinced John Davis to return from the U.S. Senate to run against him, and Morton went down to defeat by a wide margin. He made some gains in the 1841 rematch. In 1842 the candidate of the upstart Liberty Party, an abolitionist party, secured enough votes to send the election to the state legislature. Because of the third party there were also a large number of vacancies in the state senate which was to choose the winner. The Liberty Party hoped to use its position in the balance of power to control the outcome, but a single Whig defector in the vote to fill the senate led to a Democratic majority in the chamber. The senate then went on to choose Morton as governor.

Morton once again called for a series of reforms, repeating those from 1840, and including a proposal to transfer the tax burden from real to personal property. He was criticized by the Whigs for omitting any mention of slavery in his inaugural address. During his term the leaders of the various Democratic factions squabbled over executive and party appointments, and the death of President William Henry Harrison shortly after taking office brought on further party divisions as potential presidential nominees canvassed the state for support. As a consequence, much of the reform agenda was either not implemented at all, or only minimally, despite a nominally working Democratic-Liberty coalition majority in the legislature. George Bancroft bemoaned the lost opportunity: &quot;Never had a party a better opening than we have in Massachusetts, if all would but profit by our position. But they will not.&quot;

In the 1843 election Morton was set against George N. Briggs, a Whig lawyer from rural Berkshire County, who was chosen to counter Morton&#x27;s appeal to rural voters. The Liberty candidate again won enough votes to deny either Briggs (who won a 3,000 vote plurality) or Morton a majority, and the election was sent to the legislature. The legislature had been returned to Whig control, and thus elected Briggs. The Whigs promptly undid most of the few reforms that were enacted during Morton&#x27;s term.

==Later years==
Following his 1843 defeat, Morton finally decided to stop running for governor, yielding the nomination in 1844 to George Bancroft. In September 1844 he traveled to neighboring Rhode Island, where he agitated for the release of Thomas Wilson Dorr, the leader of Dorr&#x27;s Rebellion who had been sentenced to hard labor. Democratic sympathies for Dorr were used as ammunition against them by the Whigs in subsequent elections.
In 1845 President James K. Polk appointed Morton collector of the port of Boston; he served four years. Approval of his nomination in the U.S. Senate became somewhat controversial, with southern Senators objecting to him because of earlier statements he had made in opposition to slavery. Even before his appointment was approved, he began using the politically important post in an effort to bring the state party membership more in line with his vision, but only succeeded in widening the already existing fractures in the party organization. The divide resulted in a delay of his confirmation due to political intrigues by the Henshaw faction, and caused a permanent break in political relations between Morton and Bancroft. After an acrimonious state convention in 1847 (in which the Henshaw faction refused to allow platform items opposing slavery), Morton quit the party for the burgeoning Free Soil movement. Morton would refuse to support the Democrat-Free Soil coalition that in 1850 saw the election of Democrat George S. Boutwell as governor and Free Soiler Charles Sumner as U.S. Senator.

In 1848 Morton was invited by Martin Van Buren to run as the vice presidential nominee on the Free Soil ticket. Morton refused, arguing that Van Buren (a New Yorker) needed geographic diversity. Van Buren finally chose Wisconsin&#x27;s Henry Dodge, but the party convention chose Massachusetts&#x27;s Charles Francis Adams. Morton campaigned for Van Buren, who ended up polling third.

Morton was a delegate to the Massachusetts Constitutional Convention of 1853, and was elected on the Free Soil ticket to the Massachusetts House of Representatives in 1858, serving one term.

==Death and legacy==
Morton died at his home in Taunton in 1864, nearly 80 years old, and was buried in its Mount Pleasant Cemetery. His home in Taunton later became the original building of Morton Hospital and Medical Center. It was demolished in the 1960s during hospital expansion.

His son, also named Marcus, followed him onto the state&#x27;s supreme court, eventually serving as its chief justice. His daughter, Frances, was the mother of novelist Octave Thanet, and another daughter Lydia Mason Lee née Morton was wife of Henry Washington Lee, bishop of Iowa.

<text>The Bergen Street station is a local station on the IRT Eastern Parkway Line of the New York City Subway, located at Bergen Street and Flatbush Avenue in Park Slope, Brooklyn. It is served by the 2 train at all times, the 3 train at all times except late nights, and the 4 train during late nights.

== History ==
After the Interborough Rapid Transit Company (IRT)&#x27;s original line opened as far as Atlantic Avenue in Brooklyn, the New York City government began planning new lines. As early as 1903, William Barclay Parsons, chief engineer of the Rapid Transit Commission, had proposed constructing a four-track extension of the IRT line under Flatbush Avenue, running southeast from Atlantic Avenue to Grand Army Plaza. From there, two branches would have extended south to Flatbush and east to Brownsville. This plan did not progress for a decade due to various disputes over the original subway. In 1913, New York City, the Brooklyn Rapid Transit Company (BRT), and the IRT reached an agreement, known as the Dual Contracts, to drastically expand subway service across New York City. As part of the Dual Contracts, two lines under Flatbush Avenue, one each operated by the BRT and IRT, were approved. The IRT was authorized to extend its four-track Brooklyn line under Flatbush Avenue and Eastern Parkway, while the BRT would construct a parallel two-track extension of the Brighton Line.

Groundbreaking for the IRT extension took place on May 23, 1914. The Bergen Street station was to be one of the stations on the IRT extension.

Service on the IRT Eastern Parkway Line had been extended from Atlantic Avenue to Utica Avenue in August 1920, but the Bergen Street, Grand Army Plaza, and Eastern Parkway–Brooklyn Museum stations were not ready to open with the rest of the line. The contractor responsible for completing the three stations had gone bankrupt in the middle of the project. The stations opened on October 9, 1920. The BMT Brighton Line was already in use at the time but used trackage that is now part of the Franklin Avenue Shuttle; the opening of the subway line beneath Flatbush Avenue provided a more direct route to Downtown Brooklyn and, eventually, Manhattan.

During the 1964–1965 fiscal year, the platforms at Bergen Street, along with those at four other stations on the Eastern Parkway Line, were lengthened to to accommodate a ten-car train of IRT cars. The work was performed by the Arthur A. Johnson Corporation.

== Station layout ==
The station contains six tracks and two side platforms: the outermost tracks are used by the IRT local trains. To the inside are the IRT express tracks, which slant upward to the inside of the outer local tracks. In between the express tracks are the BMT Brighton Line tracks. Those routes were built at the same time as the tracks at this station as part of the Dual Contracts. A full curtain wall separates the local from the express tracks, though a gap exists in the curtain wall at the northern end of the station.

The 2 train stops here at all times, while the 3 train stops here at all times except late nights. The 4 train serves the station only during late nights. The next station to the north is Atlantic Avenue–Barclays Center, while the next station to the south is Grand Army Plaza.

Both platforms have their original mosaics. The name tablets read &quot;BERGEN ST.&quot; in gold serif font on a blue background and multi-layered green border. The trim line is green with &quot;B&quot; tablets on them on a blue background at regular intervals. At either ends of both platforms, where they were extended in 1964–1965, there are cinderblock tiles with signs reading &quot;BERGEN ST&quot; in sans serif font on a maroon background.

The platforms only have columns at the fare control areas and they are i-beam columns painted green.

===Exits===
Each platform has one same-level fare control area at the center and there are no crossovers or crossunders. The southbound platform has an unstaffed fare control area containing a bank of three regular turnstiles, two exit-only turnstiles, and two High Entry/Exit Turnstiles. Outside fare control are two staircases going up to the southwestern corner of Flatbush Avenue and Bergen Street and a passage leading to another staircase going up to the northwestern corner. The Manhattan-bound platform has a full-time turnstile bank and token booth. Outside fare control are and two staircases going up to either eastern corners of Bergen Street and Flatbush Avenue, as well as a closed and sealed stair to the southwestern corner of Sixth Avenue and Bergen Street.

<text>The Grand Army Plaza station is a local station on the IRT Eastern Parkway Line of the New York City Subway. It is located in Park Slope, Brooklyn, underneath Flatbush Avenue at its intersection with Plaza Street West and St. Johns Place, on the northwest side of Grand Army Plaza. It is served by the 2 train at all times, the 3 train at all times except late nights, and the 4 train during late nights.

== History ==

=== Construction and opening ===
After the Interborough Rapid Transit Company (IRT)&#x27;s original line opened as far as Atlantic Avenue in Brooklyn, the New York City government began planning new lines. As early as 1903, William Barclay Parsons, chief engineer of the Rapid Transit Commission, had proposed constructing a four-track extension of the IRT line under Flatbush Avenue, running southeast from Atlantic Avenue to Grand Army Plaza. From there, two branches would have extended south to Flatbush and east to Brownsville. This plan did not progress for a decade due to various disputes over the original subway. In 1913, New York City, the Brooklyn Rapid Transit Company (BRT), and the IRT reached an agreement, known as the Dual Contracts, to drastically expand subway service across New York City. As part of the Dual Contracts, two lines under Flatbush Avenue, one each operated by the BRT and IRT, were approved. The IRT was authorized to extend its four-track Brooklyn line under Flatbush Avenue and Eastern Parkway, while the BRT would construct a parallel two-track extension of the Brighton Line.

Groundbreaking for the IRT extension took place on May 23, 1914. The Prospect Park Plaza station, at Grand Army Plaza was to be one of the stations on the IRT extension. The Grand Army Plaza station was built as part of section 1A of the Eastern Parkway Line, stretching between the plaza and St. Mark&#x27;s Avenue. The Cranford Company received a construction contract for this section in March 1914 after making a low bid of about $2.2 million. The project involved digging under Grand Army Plaza, near the Soldiers&#x27; and Sailors&#x27; Arch.

Service on the IRT Eastern Parkway Line had been extended from Atlantic Avenue to Utica Avenue in August 1920, but the Bergen Street, Grand Army Plaza, and Eastern Parkway–Brooklyn Museum stations were not ready to open with the rest of the line. The contractor responsible for completing the three stations had gone bankrupt in the middle of the project. The stations opened on October 9, 1920. The BMT Brighton Line was already in use at the time but used trackage that is now part of the Franklin Avenue Shuttle; the opening of the subway line beneath Flatbush Avenue provided a more direct route to Downtown Brooklyn and, eventually, Manhattan. The station was originally known as the Prospect Park Plaza station, but it was renamed in 1926 when the plaza itself was rededicated as Grand Army Plaza.

=== Later years ===
The construction of the station and tunnels resulted in the removal of Frederic W. Darlington&#x27;s 1897 Electric Fountain from the center of Grand Army Plaza, which was dug up for the cut-and-cover construction and replaced with a grass oval. Planning for a new fountain, known as the Bailey Fountain, began in 1928, and it was completed in 1932.

During the 1964–1965 fiscal year, the platforms at Grand Army Plaza, along with those at four other stations on the Eastern Parkway Line, were lengthened to to accommodate a ten-car train of IRT cars. The work was performed by the Arthur A. Johnson Corporation. In April 1993, the New York State Legislature agreed to give the MTA $9.6 billion for capital improvements. Some of the funds would be used to renovate nearly one hundred New York City Subway stations, including Grand Army Plaza. The renovation was completed in 1996.

== Station layout ==


At platform level, Grand Army Plaza has a simple island platform layout with two tracks. The 2 train stops here at all times, while the 3 train stops here at all times except late nights. The 4 train serves the station only during late nights. The next station to the north is Bergen Street, while the next station to the south is Eastern Parkway–Brooklyn Museum.

Southbound (eastern Brooklyn-bound) trains use track E1 while northbound (Manhattan-bound) trains use track E4. Underneath the platform are four tracks, the center two, A4 (north) and A3 (south) carrying the BMT Brighton Line with tracks E2 and E3 carrying southbound and northbound express IRT Eastern Parkway Line trains on either side of the Brighton Line tracks, respectively. These track designations are only displayed on small emergency placards on either end of the platform for use by train and emergency personnel; they are not used in everyday conversation.

The only mosaic in the Grand Army Plaza station is a small &quot;P&quot;. A permanent art installation in the station&#x27;s entrances and mezzanine entitled &quot;Wings for the IRT: The Irresistible Romance of Travel&quot; was created in 1995 by Jane Greengold, who used the station regularly when she lived in Park Slope. The bronze and terra cotta pieces of art are modeled on the original Interborough Rapid Transit Company logo, and alludes to the Soldiers&#x27; and Sailors&#x27; Arch in the plaza above with its Winged Victories. The MTA&#x27;s Arts for Transit program held an opening ceremony for the artwork on June 19, 1997.

===Exits===
The station has four entrances and exits, all of which are staircases:
* 2 on the northeast corner of Flatbush Avenue and Plaza Street East
* 1 on the southwest corner of Flatbush Avenue and Plaza Street West
* 1 on the southeast corner of Flatbush Avenue and Plaza Street West

<text>Williams Electric Trains was an American model railroad manufacturer, based in Columbia, Maryland. Williams was sold to Kader via their subsidiary Bachmann Industries in October 2007, and is now identified as &quot;Williams by Bachmann.&quot;

It was founded in 1971 by Jerry Williams as a maker of reproductions of vintage Lionel and Ives Standard gauge trains. Williams had acquired some of the original tooling from the original Lionel Corporation after it sold the rights to the name to General Mills in 1969. In the 1980s Williams acquired tooling that had once belonged to Kusan, an obscure Lionel competitor from the 1950s, and its product line shifted to O scale. Williams eventually discontinued its tinplate offerings, selling the old Lionel tooling to the company that later became MTH Electric Trains.

Although today Williams is often considered a maker of reproduction 1950s-era Lionel equipment, Williams&#x27; offerings are distinguishable from the Lionel originals because Williams sometimes adds details that were not possible using 1950s manufacturing methods.

Unlike most other O scale manufacturers, Williams never added electronics such as Trainmaster Command Control or Digital Command System to its locomotives. This decision gained Williams a small but devoted following among those hobbyists who want a more &quot;traditional&quot; train layout reminiscent of the 1950s but who want to buy modern equipment. However, this decision has also allowed companies such as MTH and K-Line to eclipse it in size in spite of being an older company.

Before construction on Eastern Parkway even began, Brooklyn park commissioner Raymond Ingersoll recommended that the plans be modified to avoid damaging trees on Eastern Parkway. As a result, plans for the line were changed in October 1914. Under the revised plan, the four-track tunnel under Eastern Parkway was to be double-decked, except at the Franklin Avenue station, where all tracks would be on the same level. In April 1915, nineteen companies submitted bids to construct the section of line between Grand Army Plaza and Nostrand Avenue, including the Institute Park, Franklin Avenue, and Nostrand Avenue stations. The low bidder for this contract was the Inter-Continental Company. which bid $2.7 million; the contract was confirmed that May.

The tunnel between Grand Army Plaza and Nostrand Avenue was built using the cut-and-cover method, with two steam shovels excavating an estimated . Dirt from the excavation of the tunnel was used to infill the old Brighton Beach Race Course. Just before the Institute Park station was to open, the IRT received a petition from Brooklyn Institute of Arts and Sciences to change the name of the station to &quot;Brooklyn Museum&quot; to provide an adequate guide for the station&#x27;s location. As a result, an order was issued on March 3, 1920, changing the name of the station to &quot;Eastern Parkway–Brooklyn Museum&quot;. New signs and tiles had to be installed while the station finish work was already underway.

Service on the IRT Eastern Parkway Line had been extended from Atlantic Avenue to Utica Avenue in August 1920, but the Bergen Street, Grand Army Plaza, and Eastern Parkway–Brooklyn Museum stations were not ready to open with the rest of the line. The contractor responsible for completing the three stations had gone bankrupt in the middle of the project. The stations opened on October 9, 1920.

=== Later years ===
During the 1964–1965 fiscal year, the platforms at Eastern Parkway, along with those at four other stations on the Eastern Parkway Line, were lengthened to 525 feet to accommodate a ten-car train of 51-foot IRT cars. The work was performed by the Arthur A. Johnson Corporation.

In 1981, the MTA announced the creation of its Culture Stations program to install public art in the subway. The Culture Stations program was started to deter graffiti, and was inspired by legislation in the New York City Council that mandated that 1% of the cost of constructing public buildings be used for art. The program was modeled on the Louvre – Rivoli station on the Paris Métro, which featured reproductions of the artwork on display in the Louvre. Four stations, namely Eastern Parkway–Brooklyn Museum, Astor Place, 66th Street–Lincoln Center, and Fifth Avenue/53rd Street, were selected for the program due to their proximity to cultural institutions. These would be among the first stations in the MTA&#x27;s new station refurbishment program, which began in 1982. Initially, there was funding only for the Astor Place and Fifth Avenue/53rd Street stations. The Eastern Parkway and 66th Street stations had still not been renovated by 1986, even though the Astor Place and Fifth Avenue/53rd Street projects had been completed by then.

In 2002, it was announced that Eastern Parkway would be one of ten subway stations citywide to receive renovations. The station subsequently underwent a renovation that lasted between 13 and 15 months; the project was expedited in advance of the museum&#x27;s anniversary. The project, finished in April 2004, cost $12 million to $14 million to complete. The Brooklyn Museum donated some architectural decorations, which were installed within the station. A new exit was also built, leading to the Brooklyn Museum&#x27;s new main-entrance pavilion.

As part of the 2015–2019 MTA Capital Program, elevators were added to the platforms and street, which made the station fully compliant with accessibility guidelines under the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990. A contract for the elevators&#x27; construction was awarded in August 2018. Substantial completion was projected for October 2020, but the elevators opened two months later. Designed by Urbahn Architects and constructed by Gramercy Group, the project cost $25.8 million and included three elevators and a rebuilt staircase.

== Station layout ==
There are two local tracks with two side platforms. The express tracks pass underneath the station and are not visible from the platforms. The 2 train stops here at all times, while the 3 train stops here at all times except late nights. The 4 train serves the station only during late nights. The next station to the north is Grand Army Plaza, while the next station to the south is Franklin Avenue–Medgar Evers College. A large mosaic on the walls displays Eastern Parkway and &quot;Brooklyn Museum&quot;.

In the eastern mezzanine are architectural ornaments from the Brooklyn Museum collection, installed during the 2003 renovation of the station. The station contains 78 ornaments, which include cornices and statues salvaged from demolished buildings. The platforms and the eastern mezzanine formerly displayed abstract art paintings created in 1991 by artist Pat Steir, collectively called the &quot;Brueghel Series&quot;.

There is an emergency exit from the express level at the south end of each platform. There is a closed western mezzanine blocked by a tiled wall and a door on the west ends of both platforms; the entrances to this mezzanine have been covered with metal hatches on street level.

===Exits===

The only two exits to this station are from the east mezzanine. One exit is on the south side of Eastern Parkway, in front of the Brooklyn Museum; the elevator is located by this entrance. The other is in the pedestrian mall on the north side of Eastern Parkway, across the street from the Brooklyn Museum.

<doc id="729431" wikidata="Q2568913" url="?curid=729431" title="Blue baby syndrome">
<text>Blue baby syndrome can refer to conditions that cause cyanosis, or blueness of the skin, in babies as a result of low oxygen levels in the blood. This term has traditionally been applied to cyanosis as a result of:.

#Cyanotic heart disease, which is a category of congenital heart defect that results in low levels of oxygen in the blood. This can be caused by either reduced blood flow to the lungs or mixing of oxygenated and deoxygenated blood.
#Methemoglobinemia, which is a disease defined by high levels of methemoglobin in the blood. Increased levels of methemoglobin prevent oxygen from being released into the tissues and result in hypoxemia.
Although these are the most common causes of cyanosis, there are other potential factors that can cause a blue tint to a baby&#x27;s skin or mucous membranes. These factors include hypoventilation, perfusion or ventilation differences in the lungs, and poor cardiac output of oxygenated blood, among others. The blue baby syndrome or cyanosis occurs when absolute amount of deoxygenated hemoglobin &gt; 3g/dL which is typically reflected with an O2 saturation of &lt; 85 %.

Both of these conditions cause cyanosis, or a bluish discoloration of skin or mucous membranes. Normally, oxygenated blood appears red and deoxygenated blood has more of a blue appearance. In babies with low levels of oxygen or mixing of oxygenated and deoxygenated blood, the blood can have a blue or purple color, causing cyanosis.

== Signs and symptoms ==
The main sign of blue baby syndrome is cyanosis. Depending on the underlying cause of the cyanosis, additional symptoms may be:

* Failure to thrive
* Lethargy
* Nasal flaring
* Rapid heartbeat
* Rapid respiratory rate 
* Seizures
* Shortness of breath

==Causes==
Blue baby syndrome has been attributed to cyanotic congenital heart diseases and methemoglobinemia, however there are additional causes that could result in a baby becoming cyanotic, such as:

* Airway obstruction
* Decreased blood perfusion
* Disordered control of breathing (ex: cyanotic breath-holding spells, seizures)
* Pulmonary/lung disorders (ex: pulmonary hypertension, cystic fibrosis)
* Respiratory distress syndrome

== Mechanism ==

=== Cyanotic heart disease ===
Specific types of congenital heart defects that cause blood to pass directly from the right side of the heart to the left side result in cyanosis. In these defects, some of the blood that is pumped to the body has not been oxygenated by the lungs and therefore will appear more blue. Infants with these types of heart defects may have a constant bluish tint to their skin, or they may have temporary episodes of cyanosis. The degree of cyanosis is dependent on how much deoxygenated blood is mixed with oxygenated blood before being pumped to the body.

Cardiac conditions in which there is decreased blood flow to the lungs such as, tetralogy of Fallot or pulmonary valve atresia, result in less blood becoming oxygenated. There are also cardiac conditions such as transposition of the great arteries or truncus arteriosus, that results in an overall increase in blood flow to the lungs but with limited flow of the oxygenated blood to the rest of the body. Conditions in which there is poor blood flow to the systemic circulation, such as coarctation of the aorta suggests that the body does not receive the oxygenated blood it requires with resultant cyanosis.

The five most common cyanotic heart defects that may result in Blue Baby Syndrome include the following:
===Methemoglobinemia ===

Methemoglobinemia can be acquired or congenital. It occurs when the iron in hemoglobin is oxidized from Fe2+ to Fe3+, leading to poor binding of oxygen. Additionally, the oxygen that is already bound is held more tightly to the hemoglobin due to a higher affinity, resulting in less oxygen delivery. A methemoglobin level &gt; 1.5 g/dL causes cyanosis. The most common congenital cause is a deficiency in the enzyme cytochrome b5 reductase which reduces methemoglobin in the blood.

However, in infants the most common cause of methemoglobinemia is acquired through the ingestion of nitrates () through well water or foods. Nitrites () produced by the microbial reduction of nitrate (directly in the drinkwater, or after ingestion by the infant, in his digestive system) are more powerful oxidizers than nitrates and are the chemical agent really responsible of the oxidation of Fe2+ into Fe3+ in the tetrapyrrole heme of hemoglobin. Infants younger than 4 months are at greater risk given that they drink more water per body weight, they have a lower NADH- cytochrome b5 reductase activity, and they have a higher level of fetal hemoglobin which converts more easily to methemoglobin. Additionally, infants are at an increased risk after an episode of gastroenteritis due to the production of nitrites by bacteria. The sources of nitrate can include fertilizers used in agricultural lands, waste dumps or pit latrines. For example, nitrate levels are subject to monitoring to comply with drinking water quality standards in the United States and other countries. The link between blue baby syndrome and nitrates in drinking water is widely accepted, but as of 2006 some studies indicated that other contaminants or dietary nitrate sources, might also play a role in the syndrome.

== Diagnosis ==
When diagnosing blue baby syndrome, it is important to perform a thorough history and physical exam. When obtaining the history, it is important to determine the timing of symptoms and to ask about risk factors/exposures, such as prenatal history or access to well-water.

On physical exam it is important to visualize where the cyanosis is present to differentiate between peripheral and central cyanosis. Central cyanosis is typically visible as a blueish discoloration over the entire body and mucous membranes. In contrast, peripheral cyanosis typically has a blueish discoloration over the extremities. Cyanosis can be noted in babies around the lips, tongue, and sublingual area, where the skin is thinnest. In addition, it is important to observe the infant for signs of respiratory distress, visualized as nasal flaring, subcostal retractions, etc. Examination should include a respiratory and cardiac assessment.

One of the key tools in diagnosing is a pulse oximeter to determine oxygen saturation. While severe cyanosis can be easily noticed, an oxygen saturation as low as 80 % causes only mild clinical cyanosis that is difficult to see. Additionally an arterial blood gas is useful, for example in the case of methemoglobinemia the PO2 can be expected to be normal even with a low oxygen saturation. Additional work up includes a complete blood count, blood glucose, blood culture, chest X-ray, and an echocardiography.

Babies with cyanosis due to congenital heart disease usually present with symptoms hours to days after birth. In addition to cyanosis, they often show signs of tachypnea (fast breathing), a heart murmur, and decreased peripheral pulses. If congenital heart disease is suspected in a newborn, doctors will likely perform several tests to evaluate the heart, including a chest x-ray, echocardiogram, and electrocardiogram. In tetralogy of Fallot, episodes in which infants become cyanotic are called tet spells, typically occurring during feeding or crying. When older, children may squat to feel relief since this increases the systemic vascular resistance causing more blood to go towards the lungs, resulting in increased oxygenation.

Babies with cyanosis due to methemoglobinemia also usually present with cyanosis in the neonatal period, but pulse oximetry may be falsely elevated and does not always reveal low blood oxygen saturation. A CO-oximeter can be used to detect levels of methemoglobin in the blood if methemoglobinemia is suspected, by seeing the difference between oxygen saturation on an arterial blood gas and the measurement on a co-oximeter. Additionally, a direct methemoglobin level can be obtained.

== Prevention/Screening ==
As of 22 May 2007, the United States Environmental Protection Agency has established a maximum contaminant level of 10 mg/L for nitrate and 1 mg/L for nitrite in drinking water due to the potential harmful effects in infants.

A screening tool has been developed to screen for critical cardiac defects, which refers to cardiac lesions that require surgery or intervention in the 1st year of life. Screening for critical congenital heart defects should be done on all newborns after 24hours or shortly before discharge. Oxygen saturation is measured in the right hand and either foot.

A screening is considered positive if:

* Oxygen saturation &lt; 90 % in either extremity,
* Oxygen saturation 90-94 % in both extremities on 3 measurements separated by an hour each,
* Oxygen saturation difference &gt; 3 % between both extremities on 3 measurements separated by an hour each.

== Management ==
Treatment for blue baby syndrome will depend on the underlying cause.

When evaluating a patient for cyanosis or respiratory distress, vital signs should be monitored, especially the patient&#x27;s heart rate and oxygen saturation. It is beneficial to have vascular access established. In newborns, the pulse oximeter is typically placed on the right hand to determine pre-ductal oxygenation, referring to oxygenation before the ductus arteriosus (connection between aorta and pulmonary artery). This gives the oxygenation level the heart and brain receive. Traditionally, supplemental oxygen is given in an escalating manner beginning with free-flowing oxygen, progressing to positive pressure ventilation or continuous positive airway pressure, and ending with mechanical intubation. The goal oxygen saturation is between 85 and 95 %. If an infant requires supplemental oxygen for a prolonged time it should be heated and humidified to avoid heat loss.

===Cyanotic heart disease===
Some babies born with cyanotic heart disease are treated with prostaglandin E1 after birth to keep the ductus arteriosus open and allow for more oxygenated blood to be pumped to the body. Many also receive oxygen therapy to increase the percentage of oxygen in the blood. Most of these babies will require surgery during infancy to correct their structural heart defect.

===Severe methemoglobinemia===
The first-line treatment for severe methemoglobinemia is methylene blue, a medication that will reduce methemoglobin in the blood. This is possible because methylene blue oxidizes NADPH, which in turn can convert methemoglobin back to hemoglobin.

== Epidemiology ==
Out of all the babies born with congenital heart defects, about 25 % have cyanosis as a result. Tetralogy of Fallot is the most common cyanotic cardiac heart defect.

Methemoglobinemia is considered to be rare, with acquired methemoglobinemia encountered more than the congenital form.

== Outcomes ==
In the case of cyanotic causing heart defects, about 75 % of infants survive to 1 year of age and 69 % survive to 18 years of age. These individuals have an increased risk of developmental delay, heart failure, or heart rhythm disorders.

Methemoglobinemia responds well to treatment, its prognosis is associated with the level of methemoglobinemia and the degree of end organ damage it can cause. Death can occur when levels reach 70 %.

== History ==
The first successful operation to treat blue baby syndrome caused by tetralogy of Fallot occurred at Johns Hopkins University in 1944. Through a collaboration between pediatric cardiologist Helen Taussig, surgeon Alfred Blalock, and surgical technician Vivien Thomas, the Blalock-Thomas-Taussig shunt was created. Dr. Taussig had recognized that children with Tetralogy of Fallot who also had a patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) typically lived longer, so the trio tried to create the same effect as a PDA by joining the subclavian artery to the pulmonary artery, relieving the child&#x27;s cyanosis. The operation was published in the Journal of the American Medical Association in 1945 and impacted management of blue babies around the world.

Anna was the name of the dog who was the first survivor of the surgery, considered an experimental procedure at the time. Anna survived the first pulmonary bypass after having been operated on twice. The second operation was required to replace the original stitches with flexible ones. After their success with Anna, Blalock and Thomas had the courage to perform the very first open heart surgery on Eileen Saxon in 1944. In 1950, Anna&#x27;s story was made into a movie, and the film has been shown to various schools and other groups.

<text>Juan Francisco Velasco Alvarado (June 16, 1910 – December 24, 1977) was a Peruvian general who served as the President of Peru after a successful coup d&#x27;état against Fernando Belaúnde&#x27;s presidency in 1968. Under his presidency, nationalism, as well as left-leaning policies that addressed indigenous Peruvians, such as nationalization or agrarian reform were adopted. These policies were reversed after another coup d&#x27;état in 1975 led by his Prime Minister, Francisco Morales Bermúdez.

Velasco had a confrontational foreign policy towards the United States, as he pushed for renegotiation of treaties and criticized what he perceived as a pernicious dependence of Latin American states on the United States. While he strengthened Peruvian relations with the Soviet Union, Velasco was firmly anti-communist. His foreign policy has been described as &quot;third way.&quot;

== Early life ==
Juan Velasco was born in Castilla, a city near Piura on Peru&#x27;s north coast. He was the son of Manuel José Velasco, a medical assistant, and Clara Luz Alvarado, who had 11 children. Velasco described his youth as one of &quot;dignified poverty, working as a shoeshine boy in Piura.&quot;

In 1929, he stowed away on a ship to Lima, Peru, falsified his age, and tried to enlist as an officer in the Peruvian Army. However, he arrived late to the exam, so he joined as a private on April 5, 1929. A year later, he took a competitive exam for entrance into the &quot;Escuela Militar de Chorrillos&quot;, and got the highest score of all applicants. In 1934, he graduated with high honors and at the head of his class.

He married Consuelo Gonzales Posada in 1940, with whom he had several children.

== Coup d&#x27;etat against President Fernando Belaunde ==

During the Fernando Belaúnde&#x27;s administration (1963–1968), political disputes became a norm as he held no majority in Congress. Serious arguments between President Belaúnde and Congress, dominated by the APRA-UNO (Unión Nacional Odríista) coalition, and even between the President and his own &quot;Acción Popular&quot; (Popular Action) party were common. Congress went on to censure several cabinets of the Belaunde administration, and a general political instability was perceived.

Also, between 1964 and 1965 the army had been sent to deal with two military uprisings inspired by the Cuban Revolution. Through the use of guerrilla tactics, both the National Liberation Army (ELN) commanded by Héctor Béjar and Javier Heraud, and the Revolutionary Left Movement (MIR), led by an APRA militant, Luis de la Puente Uceda, and Guillermo Lobatón, tried to instigate a revolution, being unsuccessful. Nevertheless, these conflicts led several military officers to the most impoverished parts of the country, and after witnessing the reality of the country-side and studying the reasons which led to the uprisings, they began to consider social inequality and poverty as a danger to national security.

A dispute with the International Petroleum Company over licenses to the &quot;La Brea y Pariñas&quot; oil fields in northern Peru sparked a national scandal when a key page of a contract (the 11th) was found missing. The Armed Forces, fearing that this scandal might lead to another uprising or a takeover from the APRA party, seized absolute power and close down Congress, almost all of whose members were briefly incarcerated. General Velasco seized power on October 3, 1968, in a bloodless military coup, deposing the democratically elected administration of Fernando Belaúnde, under which he served as Commander of the Armed Forces. President Belaúnde was sent into exile. Initial reaction against the coup evaporated after five days when on October 8, 1968, the oil fields in dispute were taken over by the Army.

== Military dictatorship (1968–1975) ==
The coup leaders named their administration the Revolutionary Government of the Armed Forces, with Velasco at its helm as President. Velasco&#x27;s administration articulated a desire to give justice to the poor through a regime of nationalization known as &quot;Peruanismo&quot;. Velasco&#x27;s rule was characterized by broadly social democratic, developmentalist, and independent nationalist policies, which aimed to create a strong national industry to increase the international independence of Peru. To that end, he nationalised entire industries, expropriated companies in a wide range of activities from fisheries to mining to telecommunications to power production and consolidated them into single industry-centric government-run entities, and increased government control over economic activity by enforcing those entities as monopolies and disincentivized private activity in those sectors. Most reforms were planned by leftist intellectuals of the time.

A root and branch education reform was implemented, seeking to promote inclusivity among all Peruvians and move them towards to a new national way of thinking and feeling; the poor and the most excluded were prioritized in this system. The &quot;Día del Indio&quot; or &quot;Peruvian Indian&#x27;s day&quot; became &quot;Día del Campesino&quot; or &quot;Peruvian Peasant&#x27;s day.&quot; This holiday fell on June 24, a traditional holiday of the land, since it was the day of winter solstice.

The education reform of 1972 provided for bilingual education for the indigenous people of the Andes and the Amazon, which consisted nearly half of the population. In 1975, the Velasco government enacted a law making Quechua an official language of Peru equal to Spanish. However, this law was never enforced and ceased to be valid when the 1979 constitution became effective, according to which Quechua and Aymara are official only where they predominate, as mandated by law – a law that was never enacted.

A cornerstone of Velasco&#x27;s political and economic strategy was the implementation by dictate of an agrarian reform program to expropriate farms and diversify land ownership. In its first ten years in power, the Revolutionary Government expropriated 15,000 properties (totaling nine million hectares) and benefited some 300,000 families. Peru&#x27;s agrarian reform under Velasco was the second-largest Land reform in Latin American history, after Cuba. The former landlords who opposed this program believed that they did not receive adequate compensation for their confiscated assets and lamented that the state officials and peasant beneficiaries mismanaged their properties after the expropriation. The owners who opposed his program also claimed that the expropriation was more akin to confiscation, as they were paid in agrarian reform bonds, a sovereign debt obligation of which the government defaulted payment due to the hyperinflationary period that affected Peru&#x27;s economy in the late 1980s, leaving the current value of the bonds up for debate and resulting in a decade-long lawsuit against the Peruvian government.

The deposed Belaúnde administration had attempted to implement a milder agrarian reform program, but it was defeated in Congress by the APRA-UNO coalition with support of the major landowners. Within this framework, the Velasco administration engaged in a program of import substitution industrialization, imposing tight foreign exchange and trade controls. 

The success of the Velasco administration&#x27;s economic policies is still debated today. As the Peruvian military government ran deeper into debt, it was forced to devalue the currency and run inflationary policies. This however, was in part due to the 1970s energy crisis, which also affected Peru and made it impossible for the Velasco administration to fund some of its most ambitious reforms. Economic growth under the administration was steady if unremarkable - real per capita GDP (constant 2000 US$) increased 3.2% per year from 1968 to 1975.

In 1971, Velasco described the economic policy as one aimed at overcoming capitalism in Peru, stating that

In a 1975 speech Velasco described his revolution as one that rejected both capitalism and communism, stating that

==Foreign and military policies==

In foreign policy, in contrast with his 1970s Latin American contemporaries, which were mostly right-wing military dictatorships, he pursued a partnership with the Soviet bloc, tightening relations with Cuba and Fidel Castro and undertaking major purchases of Soviet military hardware.

Relations between the United States and Peru were tense and even hostile, as soon as General Velasco and his junta took power. This was due to the government&#x27;s socialist-leaning policies, but also because of a belief on the part of the Peruvian public that the U.S. generally favored other nations first, such as Chile in the context of their territorial dispute (in spite of its support of Peru over the Tarata dispute), or Colombia, in the context of the United States&#x27; mediation in favor of the Salomon-Lozano Treaty in order to compensate the country for its loss of Panama.

Just five days after Velasco seized power in 1968, the General began the nationalization of the Peruvian economy with the expropriation and nationalization of the American International Petroleum Company (IPC) oil fields located in the northern Peruvian oil port and refinery of Talara, Piura, near the Peruvian border with Ecuador, Piura being the region where Velasco was born. The IPC expropriation was one of the first foreign policy crises for the new American administration of President Richard Nixon. John N. Irwin II was appointed special Ambassador to negotiate a solution and recommended against formal application of sanctions required by U.S. law. Eventually, the dispute was resolved in the context of a broader claims agreement so formulated as to permit Peru to maintain the position that it had not agreed to compensate IPC.

US–Peru disagreements continued over a broad range of issues including even Peru&#x27;s claim to a 200-mile fishing limit that resulted in the seizure of several US commercial fishing boats and the expropriation of the American copper mining company Cerro de Pasco Corporation. However, in spite of these provocations, the U.S. responded immediately with humanitarian aid in 1970, when an earthquake killed about 50,000 people and left over 600,000 homeless.

===Chile===
Another main goal of the Velasco administration, besides the nationalization of the main areas of the Peruvian economy and the agrarian reforms, was a military strengthening of Peru. Despite Chilean fears that Velasco planned on reconquering the lands lost by Peru to Chile in the War of the Pacific, such claims have been since disputed. It is estimated that from 1970 to 1975 Peru spent up to US$2 billion (roughly US$25 billion in 2021 dollars) on Soviet armament. According to various sources Velasco&#x27;s government bought between 600 and 1200 T-55 Main Battle Tanks, APCs, 60 to 90 Sukhoi 22 warplanes, 500,000 assault rifles, and even considered the purchase of the British light fleet carrier .

The enormous amount of weaponry purchased by Peru caused a meeting between former US Secretary of State Henry Kissinger and Chilean US-backed dictator General Augusto Pinochet in 1976. In 1999, Pinochet claimed that if Peru had attacked Chile during 1973 or even 1978, Peruvian forces could have penetrated deep south into Chilean territory, possibly militarily taking the Chilean city of Copiapó located half way on the way to Santiago. The Chilean Armed Forces considered launching a preventive war to defend itself. However, Pinochet&#x27;s Chilean Air Force General Fernando Matthei opposed a preventive war and responded that &quot;I can guarantee that the Peruvians would destroy the Chilean Air Force in the first five minutes of the war&quot;. Some analysts believe the fear of attack by Chilean and US officials as largely unjustified but logical for them to experience, considering the Pinochet dictatorship had come into power with a coup against democratically elected president Salvador Allende. According to sources, the alleged invasion scheme could be seen from the Chilean&#x27;s military regime perspective as a plan for some kind of leftist counterattack. While acknowledging the Peruvian plans were revisionistic, scholar Kalevi J. Holsti claim more important issues behind were the &quot;ideological incompatibility&quot; between the regimes of Velasco Alvarado and Pinochet and that Peru would have been concerned about Pinochet&#x27;s geopolitical views on Chile&#x27;s need of naval hegemony in the Southeastern Pacific.
== Overthrow ==
Economic difficulties such as inflation, unemployment, food shortages and increased political opposition after the 1974 crackdown on the press ultimately increased pressures on the Velasco administration and led to its downfall. On August 29, 1975, a number of prominent military commanders initiated a coup in the southern city of Tacna, nicknamed the &quot;Tacnazo&quot;.

The military commanders of the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th, and 5th military regions declared that Velasco had not achieved most of what the &quot;Peruvian Revolution&quot; had stood for and was unable to continue in his functions. Prime Minister Francisco Morales Bermúdez was then appointed president, by unanimous decision of the new military junta.

Prior to being deposed, Velasco had been seriously ill for at least a year. He had lost a leg to an embolism, and his cognitive abilities and personality were rumoured to have been affected by related circulatory problems. At the time of the coup, he was convalescing in the presidential winter residence at Chaclacayo, countryside 20 kilometers east of Lima. He immediately called for a meeting with his council of ministers, at Government Palace in downtown Lima, where he discovered that there was little or nothing to do. He made a last speech to the nation on the evening of August 29, 1975, announcing his decision not to resist the coup because &quot;Peruvians cannot fight against each other&quot;.

==Death and legacy==

General Velasco kept a low profile in Peruvian politics until his death in 1977. His funeral was attended by a large amount of sympathizers to the point where the government had to release a communiqué requesting order during the event.

Due to the international market moving away from Peruvian exports in the 1970s, efforts by Velasco to solidify industries of typical exports were fruitless and resulted with a debt burden. Furthermore, his government is partly responsible for the centralization of the country. After the agrarian reform, urbanization began occurring across the country, as people moved into Lima and other coastal cities. The Velasco government&#x27;s failure to adequately manage the influx of people, as well as the indifference of subsequent governments to the issue, contributed to the creation of slums around Peru&#x27;s cities.

In 1974, a then relatively unknown Hugo Chávez and around one dozen fellow cadets and soldiers, all youths, traveled to Ayacucho, Peru to celebrate the 150th anniversary of the eponymous battle. There, they were personally greeted by General Velasco. Velasco gave each of them a miniature pocket edition of &quot;La Revolución Nacional Peruana&quot; (&quot;The Peruvian National Revolution&quot;). The cadets also noted Velasco&#x27;s perceived close relationship with both the Peruvian masses and the rank and file of the Peruvian military. Chávez became attached to this book and would study its contents and constantly carry it on his person. However, Chávez later lost it after his arrest for leading the 1992 Venezuelan coup attempt. Twenty-five years later, as president, Chávez ordered the printing of millions of copies of his government&#x27;s new Bolivarian Constitution only in the form of miniature blue booklets, a partial tribute to Velasco&#x27;s gift.

<text>The Nostrand Avenue station is a local station on the IRT Eastern Parkway Line of the New York City Subway. Located at the intersection of Nostrand Avenue and Eastern Parkway in Crown Heights, Brooklyn, it is served by the 3 train at all times except late nights and the 4 train during late nights. There is also limited rush hour 2 and 5 services here.

The station opened on August 23, 1920, as part of an extension of the IRT Eastern Parkway Line by the Interborough Rapid Transit Company. The station&#x27;s platforms were extended in the 1964—1965 fiscal year so they could accommodate ten-car trains.

== History ==
=== Background ===
Nostrand Avenue station was constructed as part of the Eastern Parkway Line. The line&#x27;s section to Atlantic Avenue was part of Contract 2 of the Interborough Rapid Transit Company (IRT)&#x27;s plan to construct an extension of the original subway, Contract 1. Contract 2 extended the original line from City Hall in Manhattan to Atlantic Avenue in Brooklyn. The Board of Rapid Transit Commissioners approved the route on September 27, 1900, and the contract was signed on September 11, 1902. Construction commenced on Contract 2 on March 4, 1903. The first section opened on January 9, 1908, extending the subway from Bowling Green to Borough Hall. On April 28, 1908, the IRT formally applied with the New York Public Service Commission for permission to open the final section of the Contract 2 line from Borough Hall to Atlantic Avenue near the Flatbush Avenue LIRR station. The application was approved, and the IRT extension opened on May 1, 1908.

On March 19, 1913, New York City, the Brooklyn Rapid Transit Company, and the IRT reached an agreement, known as the Dual Contracts, to drastically expand subway service across New York City. As part of Contract 3 of the agreement, between New York City and the IRT, the original subway opened by the IRT in 1904 to City Hall, and extended to Atlantic Avenue in 1908, was to be extended eastward into Brooklyn. The line was to be extended along Flatbush Avenue and Eastern Parkway to Buffalo Street as a four-track subway line, and then along East 98th Street and Livonia Avenue to New Lots Avenue as an elevated two-track line, with provisions for the addition of a third track. In addition, a two-track branch line along Nostrand Avenue branching off east of the Franklin Avenue station was to be constructed. The underground portion of the line became known as the Eastern Parkway Line, or Route 12, while the elevated portion became known as the New Lots Line.

=== Construction and opening ===
The IRT Eastern Parkway Line was built as part of Route 12 from 1915 to 1918. On August 23, 1920, the Eastern Parkway Line was extended from Atlantic Avenue to Crown Heights–Utica Avenue, with the Nostrand Avenue station opening at this time. The new trains would be served by trains from Seventh Avenue.

=== Later years ===
During the 1964–1965 fiscal year, the platforms at Kingston Avenue, along with those at four other stations on the Eastern Parkway Line, were lengthened to to accommodate a ten-car train of IRT cars. The work was performed by the Arthur A. Johnson Corporation.

As part of its 2025–2029 Capital Program, the MTA has proposed making the station wheelchair-accessible in compliance with the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990. 

==Station layout==

This underground local station has two levels. The upper level serves New Lots Avenue-bound trains while the lower level serves Manhattan-bound trains. From north to south, each level has an express track, a local track, and one side platform. 3 trains stop here at all times except late nights and 4 trains stop here during late nights. Other times, 4 trains as well as limited rush hour 5 trains run on the express track to the north of the local track on each level to bypass the station. Limited rush hour 2 trains in the reverse-peak direction and one weekday morning northbound 5 train also serve this station. The station is between Franklin Avenue–Medgar Evers College to the west (railroad north) and Kingston Avenue to the east (railroad south).

Both platforms have their original Dual Contracts-era IRT trim line and name tablets. The trim line has a tan-yellow center, brown border, and a spec of blue in-between. &quot;N&quot; tablets on a blue background and brown border run along the trim line at regular intervals. The name tablets read &quot;NOSTRAND AVE.&quot; in serif font in gold lettering on a blue and brown background, a gold center, and brown border.

The platform extensions at either end have signs reading &quot;NOSTRAND AVE&quot; in white sans serif lettering on a brown border. The center of the platforms has green I-beam columns at regular intervals with alternating ones having the standard black station name plate in white lettering.

West of this station (railroad north), the perpendicular IRT Nostrand Avenue Line merges with the IRT Eastern Parkway Line at the Rogers Avenue Junction. President Street–Medgar Evers College on that line is two blocks to the south.

=== Exits ===
The upper level has one fare control at the center with two staircases going down to the lower level. It has a turnstile bank, token booth, and two staircases going up to the south side mall of Eastern Parkway (between the main and service roads) and Nostrand Avenue. One staircase goes to the southeast corner while the other goes to the southwest corner.

<text>The Crown Heights–Utica Avenue station (signed as Utica Avenue) is an express station on the IRT Eastern Parkway Line of the New York City Subway. Located under Eastern Parkway near Utica Avenue in Crown Heights, Brooklyn, it is served by the 4 train at all times and the 3 train at all times except late nights. There is also limited rush hour 2 and 5 services here.

Despite its name, this station has no exit to the corner of Utica Avenue and Eastern Parkway. It is actually located between Schenectady and Utica Avenues and the two exits lead to the middle of the block, several feet from the actual cross street.

The station opened on August 23, 1920, as part of an extension of the IRT Eastern Parkway Line by the Interborough Rapid Transit Company.

== History ==

=== Background ===
Crown Heights—Utica Avenue station was constructed as part of the Eastern Parkway Line. The line&#x27;s section to Atlantic Avenue was part of Contract 2 of the Interborough Rapid Transit Company (IRT)&#x27;s plan to construct an extension of the original subway, Contract 1. Contract 2 extended the original line from City Hall in Manhattan to Atlantic Avenue in Brooklyn. The Board of Rapid Transit Commissioners approved the route on September 27, 1900, and the contract was signed on September 11, 1902. Construction commenced on Contract 2 on March 4, 1903. The first section opened on January 9, 1908, extending the subway from Bowling Green to Borough Hall. On April 28, 1908, the IRT formally applied with the New York Public Service Commission for permission to open the final section of the Contract 2 line from Borough Hall to Atlantic Avenue near the Flatbush Avenue LIRR station. The application was approved, and the IRT extension opened on May 1, 1908.

On March 19, 1913, New York City, the Brooklyn Rapid Transit Company, and the IRT reached an agreement, known as the Dual Contracts, to drastically expand subway service across New York City. As part of Contract 3 of the agreement, between New York City and the IRT, the original subway opened by the IRT in 1904 to City Hall, and extended to Atlantic Avenue in 1908, was to be extended eastward into Brooklyn. The line was to be extended along Flatbush Avenue and Eastern Parkway to Buffalo Street as a four-track subway line, and then along East 98th Street and Livonia Avenue to New Lots Avenue as an elevated two-track line, with provisions for the addition of a third track. In addition, a two-track branch line along Nostrand Avenue branching off east of the Franklin Avenue station was to be constructed. The underground portion of the line became known as the Eastern Parkway Line, or Route 12, while the elevated portion became known as the New Lots Line.

=== Construction and opening ===
The IRT Eastern Parkway Line was built as part of Route 12 from 1915 to 1918. On August 23, 1920, the Eastern Parkway Line was extended from Atlantic Avenue to Crown Heights–Utica Avenue, with the Utica Avenue station opening at this time. The new trains would be served by trains from Seventh Avenue.

On November 22, 1920, the first portion of the IRT New Lots Line opened between Utica Avenue and Junius Street opened on November 22, 1920, with shuttle trains operating over this route.

===Later years===
The New York City Board of Transportation announced plans in November 1949 to extend platforms at several IRT stations, including Utica Avenue, to accommodate all doors on ten-car trains. Although ten-car trains already operated on the line, the rear car could not open its doors at the station because the platforms were so short. Funding for the platform extensions was included in the city&#x27;s 1950 capital budget.

In 1981, the Metropolitan Transportation Authority listed the station among the 69 most deteriorated stations in the subway system. A renovation of the Utica Avenue station was funded as part of the MTA&#x27;s 1980–1984 capital plan. The MTA received a $106 million grant from the Urban Mass Transit Administration in October 1983; most of the grant would fund the renovation of eleven stations, including Utica Avenue.

In April 1993, the New York State Legislature agreed to give the MTA $9.6 billion for capital improvements. Some of the funds would be used to renovate nearly one hundred New York City Subway stations, including Utica Avenue. The MTA announced in 2024 that it would replace the station&#x27;s existing waist-high turnstiles with taller, wide-aisle turnstiles.

==Station layout==


The Crown Heights–Utica Avenue station, signed as Utica Avenue station, is an express station configured in a two level layout, with southbound trains on the upper level and northbound trains on the lower one, each consisting of an island platform with the local tracks to the west and the express tracks to the east. The station is served by the train at all times and by the train at all times except late nights. During rush hours, limited and trains also serve the station. 2, 3 and nighttime 4 trains run on the local tracks along with two weekday a.m. northbound 5 trains, while most daytime 4 and limited rush hour 5 trains run on the express tracks. Southbound 4 and 5 express trains both discharge all passengers on the upper level before reversing direction and returning northbound on the lower level to recruit passengers.

The next stop to the west (railroad north) is Kingston Avenue for local trains and Franklin Avenue–Medgar Evers College for express trains. The next stop for all service to the east (railroad south), with the exception of the aforementioned most daytime 4 and limited rush hour 5 trains that originate and terminate here, is Sutter Avenue–Rutland Road.

This is the easternmost underground and four-track subway station on the Eastern Parkway Line; to the east (railroad south) of here, the local tracks rises to an elevated structure and become the IRT New Lots Line, while the express tracks end at bumper blocks just under Ralph Avenue. Diamond crossover tracks exist west (railroad north) of the station for northbound trains and east for southbound trains. Another diamond crossover, east of here, connects the southbound express track to a ramp down to the lower level. Trains descending the ramp can access either the local or express track.

There is an active tower at the south end of the platform while a closed one exists on the east of the lower level.

===Exits===
The station&#x27;s two exits are located at either end. The one on the west (railroad north) is staffed weekdays only and accessed via a wide staircase in place of the end wall of the New Lots Avenue-bound platform. This staircase leads up to a small mezzanine where there is a token booth and turnstiles. When the booth and turnstile bank are closed, three HEET turnstiles and one exit-only turnstile provide access to/from the entrance. The two street staircases lead out to the two malls on either side of the main road of Eastern Parkway on the west side of Schenectady Avenue.

The station&#x27;s full-time exit is at the east end (railroad south) of the platforms. Two narrow staircases and one elevator connect both platforms to a small upper level mezzanine that has two public restrooms (one for men and the other for women) and leads to a bank of turnstiles. The two street stairs here lead to either mall of Eastern Parkway west of Utica Avenue. Another elevator from the south mall leads to fare control.

===Design===

On the New Lots Avenue-bound platform, the track walls have a section of yellow-orange tiles beneath the trim-line and another line of yellow tiles on the bottom of the tiled portions. The I-beams and other steel work along the track walls are painted in dark blue. The Manhattan-bound platform has its metalwork painted in golden yellow and the tiles beneath the trim line in dark blue. In the station, there are ornate doors in the tile walls which serve as vent chambers.

The 2004 artwork here is part of a series called &quot;Good Morning and Good Night&quot;. It consists of ceramic tiles of the sun and moon on the platform walls.
==Provisions for expansion==
Extensions of the IRT subway east or south of the station have been proposed since the line&#x27;s planning in the 1910s, which included terminating the line at Buffalo Avenue just east of the station, or extending the line down Utica Avenue towards Flatbush Avenue and Avenue U near Kings Plaza. The Utica Avenue extension in particular has been proposed several times as part of the New York City Transit Authority&#x27;s 1968 expansion proposals, in older pre-unification plans, and in the competing pre-unification expansion plans of the Independent Subway System (IND). Just east of this station, a bellmouth splits away from the local track on both levels, and curves south. This was built into the station as a provision for the proposed Utica Avenue Line, which is why the station itself has no exits to Utica Avenue. In 2015, New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio announced his proposal for an extension of the 3 and 4 trains down Utica Avenue.

<text>Lynn Flewelling (born Lynn Elizabeth Beaulieu on October 20, 1958) is an American fantasy fiction author.

==Biography==
Born at Presque Isle, Flewelling grew up in northern Maine, United States. She has worked as a teacher, a house painter, a necropsy technician, and a freelance editor and journalist. She has been married to Douglas Flewelling since 1981, and has two sons. She currently lives in Redlands, California, where she continues to write, and offers lectures and creative writing workshops at the University of Redlands. Flewelling is a convert to Thiền Buddhism, having taken her vows with Engaged Buddhist monk Thich Nhat Hanh, and is a practitioner of Buddhist meditation. Flewelling&#x27;s writings promote feminism and LGBT causes, having said in relation to these topics, &quot;I’ve always believed that people are people, and it’s wrong to discriminate against them just because of what gender or group they fall into.&quot;

==Writings==
Her first Nightrunner novel, &quot;Luck in the Shadows&quot;, was a &quot;Locus&quot; Editor&#x27;s Pick for Best First Novel and a finalist for the Compton Crook Award. Her novels &quot;Traitor&#x27;s Moon&quot; (2000) and &quot;Hidden Warrior&quot; (2004) were both finalists for the Spectrum Award. Her novels are currently published in 13 countries, and in 2005, the first volume of the Japanese-language version of &quot;Luck in the Shadows&quot; was published. Flewelling is accessible to readers through her website, her LiveJournal blog, her Yahoo! group, and numerous guest appearances at conventions including Comic-Con and Smith College&#x27;s ConBust. Her work has been praised by other fantasy authors, including George R. R. Martin, Orson Scott Card, Elizabeth Hand, Robin Hobb, and Katherine Kurtz. Independent film company Csquared Pictures has acquired film rights to the first three books in the Nightrunner series, but they have not yet started production.

Flewelling has cited a number of authors as being major influences on her work, including Ray Bradbury, William Faulkner, T. S. Eliot, Homer, Stephen King, Joyce Carol Oates, William Shakespeare, Ernest Hemingway, Mary Renault, Anne Rice, and Arthur Conan Doyle, and has also expressed her admiration for works by additional authors, including Isaac Asimov, William Kotzwinkle, Ellen Kushner, C. S. Lewis, Toni Morrison, Shirley Jackson, E. B. White, J. M. Barrie, and Michael Moorcock.

Flewelling&#x27;s work has frequently promoted LGBT themes as well as topics related to gender. The protagonists of the Nightrunner books are both bisexual, and Flewelling has stated their creation was in response to the near-absence of LGBT characters in the genre and marginalization of existing ones. The Tamir Triad, combining elements of psychological drama with ghost story horror, features a protagonist who transforms from one sex and gender to the other. Flewelling&#x27;s works have drawn academic attention in relation to these themes.

<text>The Sutter Avenue–Rutland Road station is a station on the IRT New Lots Line of the New York City Subway, located at the intersection of Sutter Avenue, Rutland Road, and East 98th Street at the border of East Flatbush and Brownsville, Brooklyn. It is served by the 3 train at all times except late nights, when the 4 train takes over service. During rush hours, occasional 2, 4 and 5 trains also stop here.

==History==
The New Lots Line was built as a part of Contract 3 of the Dual Contracts between New York City and the Interborough Rapid Transit Company, including this station. It was built as an elevated line because the ground in this area is right above the water table, and as a result the construction of a subway would have been prohibitively expensive. The first portion of the line between Utica Avenue and Junius Street, including this station, opened on November 22, 1920, with shuttle trains operating over this route. The line was completed to New Lots Avenue on October 16, 1922, with a two-car train running on the northbound track. On October 31, 1924, through service to New Lots Avenue began.

The New York City Board of Transportation announced plans in November 1949 to extend platforms at several IRT stations, including Sutter Avenue, to accommodate all doors on ten-car trains. Although ten-car trains already operated on the line, the rear car could not open its doors at the station because the platforms were so short. Funding for the platform extensions was included in the city&#x27;s 1950 capital budget.

From October 5, 2016, to June 19, 2017, this station and Junius Street were closed for renovations.

==Station layout==

This elevated station has two side platforms and two tracks with space for a center track that was never added. The stops here at all times except late nights, when the takes over. During rush hours, limited , 4 and trains also stop here. The station is between Crown Heights–Utica Avenue to the north and Saratoga Avenue to the south. The middle third of both platforms have beige windscreens and brown canopies supported by green frames and support columns. The remaining two-thirds have black, waist-high steel fences with lampposts at regular intervals. The station signs are in the standard black name plates in white lettering.

This is the northernmost station on the IRT New Lots Line. North of the station, the line curves west under Eastern Parkway and ramps down underground to become the IRT Eastern Parkway Line. The Manhattan-bound track goes underneath the New Lots Avenue-bound track on the south side of the IRT Eastern Parkway Line. A center track begins at a bumper block near the tunnel portal and merges with the two express tracks of the Eastern Parkway line south of Utica Avenue. South of the station, the line curves east above Livonia Avenue and continues along that route with six more stops.

===Exits===
This station has one elevated station house beneath the platforms and tracks. Two staircases from the center of each platform go down to a waiting area/crossunder, where a turnstile bank provides access to/from the station. Outside fare control, there is a token booth and two staircases facing in opposite directions going down to the east side of East 98th Street at the T-intersection of Rutland Road. The north staircase is near the southern corner of the T-intersection of Sutter Avenue and East 98th Street. A third staircase goes down to the northwest corner of East 98th Street and Rutland Road.

<text>The Saratoga Avenue station is a station on the IRT New Lots Line of the New York City Subway. Located at the intersection of Saratoga Avenue and Livonia Avenue in Brownsville, Brooklyn, it is served by the 3 train at all times except late nights, when the 4 train takes over service. During rush hours, occasional 2, 4 and 5 trains also stop here.

==History==
The New Lots Line was built as a part of Contract 3 of the Dual Contracts between New York City and the Interborough Rapid Transit Company, including this station. It was built as an elevated line because the ground in this area is right above the water table, and as a result the construction of a subway would have been prohibitively expensive. The first portion of the line between Utica Avenue and Junius Street, including this station, opened on November 22, 1920, with shuttle trains operating over this route. The line was completed to New Lots Avenue on October 16, 1922, with a two-car train running on the northbound track. On October 31, 1924, through service to New Lots Avenue was begun.

From April 11, 2016 until September 19, 2016, Saratoga Avenue and Pennsylvania Avenue were closed for renovation. As part of its 2025–2029 Capital Program, the MTA has proposed making the station wheelchair-accessible in compliance with the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990. 

==Station layout==
This elevated station has two side platforms and two tracks with space for a center track that was never installed. Both platforms are longer than the standard IRT train length of and have beige windscreens and brown and red canopies with green canopies with green frames and support columns for their entire length except for a small section at the west (railroad north) end. Here, they have waist-high black steel fences with two lampposts and one standard black station sign in white lettering in-between them. The windscreens and canopy frames also have black and white station signs.

The station house had several enamel white-on-navy blue &quot;To Street&quot; porcelain signs directing passengers to the street stairs, one of which also had porcelain signs of the same style at the bottom of the canopy that said, &quot;Interborough Rapid Transit Company: To All Trains.&quot; These signs were removed during the 2016 renovation.

===Exits===
The station&#x27;s only entrance/exit is an elevated station house beneath the tracks at the extreme east (railroad south) end. Inside fare control, it has a waiting area that allows a free transfer between directions, one staircase to the Manhattan-bound platform and two to the New Lots Avenue-bound one. One of those staircases is built adjacent to the platform instead of directly on it and connected to the station house with a wooden elevated passageway. Outside fare control, there is a turnstile bank, token booth, and three staircases going down to all corners of Saratoga and Livonia Avenues except the northeast one.

<doc id="729500" wikidata="Q1783924" url="?curid=729500" title="Head and neck cancer">
<text>Head and neck cancer is a general term encompassing multiple cancers that can develop in the head and neck region. These include cancers of the mouth, tongue, gums and lips (oral cancer), voice box (laryngeal), throat (nasopharyngeal, oropharyngeal, hypopharyngeal), salivary glands, nose and sinuses. 

Head and neck cancer can present a wide range of symptoms depending on where the cancer developed. These can include an ulcer in the mouth that does not heal, changes in the voice, difficulty swallowing, red or white patches in the mouth, and a neck lump. 

The majority of head and neck cancer is caused by the use of alcohol or tobacco (including smokeless tobacco). An increasing number of cases are caused by the human papillomavirus (HPV). Other risk factors include the Epstein–Barr virus, chewing betel quid (paan), radiation exposure, poor nutrition and workplace exposure to certain toxic substances. About 90% are pathologically classified as squamous cell cancers. The diagnosis is confirmed by a tissue biopsy. The degree of surrounding tissue invasion and distant spread may be determined by medical imaging and blood tests.
Not using tobacco or alcohol can reduce the risk of head and neck cancer. Regular dental examinations may help to identify signs before the cancer develops. The HPV vaccine helps to prevent HPV-related oropharyngeal cancer. Treatment may include a combination of surgery, radiation therapy, chemotherapy, and targeted therapy. In the early stage head and neck cancers are often curable but 50% of people see their doctor when they already have an advanced disease.

Globally, head and neck cancer accounts for 650,000 new cases of cancer and 330,000 deaths annually on average. In 2018, it was the seventh most common cancer worldwide, with 890,000 new cases documented and 450,000 people dying from the disease. The usual age at diagnosis is between 55 and 65 years old. The average 5-year survival following diagnosis in the developed world is 42–64%.

==Signs and symptoms==
Head and neck cancers can cause a broad range of symptoms, many of which occur together. These can be categorised local (head and neck cancer-specific), general and gastrointestinal symptoms. Local symptoms include changes in taste and voice, inflammation of the mouth or throat (mucositis), dry mouth (xerostomia), and difficulty swallowing (dysphagia). General symptoms include difficulty sleeping, tiredness, depression, nerve damage (peripheral neuropathy). Gastrointestinal symptoms are typically nausea and vomiting.

Symptoms predominantly include a sore on the face or oral cavity that does not heal, trouble swallowing, or a change in voice. In those with advanced disease, there may be unusual bleeding, facial pain, numbness or swelling, and visible lumps on the outside of the neck or oral cavity. Head and neck cancer often begins with benign signs and symptoms of the disease, like an enlarged lymph node on the outside of the neck, a hoarse-sounding voice, or a progressive worsening cough or sore throat. In the case of head and neck cancer, these symptoms will be notably persistent and become chronic. There may be a lump or a sore in the throat or neck that does not heal or go away. There may be difficulty or pain in swallowing. Speaking may become difficult. There may also be a persistent earache.

Other symptoms can include: a lump in the lip, mouth, or gums; ulcers or mouth sores that do not heal; bleeding from the mouth or numbness; bad breath; discolored patches that persist in the mouth; a sore tongue; and slurring of speech if the cancer is affecting the tongue. There may also be congested sinuses, weight loss, and some numbness or paralysis of facial muscles.

===Mouth===

Oral cancer affects the areas of the mouth, including the inner lip, tongue, floor of the mouth, gums, and hard palate. Cancers of the mouth are strongly associated with tobacco use, especially the use of chewing tobacco or dipping tobacco, as well as heavy alcohol use. Cancers of this region, particularly the tongue, are more frequently treated with surgery than other head and neck cancers. Lip and oral cavity cancers are the most commonly encountered types of head and neck cancer.

Surgeries for oral cancers include:
* Maxillectomy (can be done with or without orbital exenteration)
* Mandibulectomy (removal of the lower jaw or part of it)
* Glossectomy (tongue removal; can be total, hemi, or partial)
* Radical neck dissection
* Combinational (e.g., glossectomy and laryngectomy done together).

The defect is typically covered or improved by using another part of the body and/or skin grafts and/or wearing a prosthesis.

===Nose===

Paranasal sinus and nasal cavity cancer affects the nasal cavity and the paranasal sinuses. Most of these cancers are squamous cell carcinomas.

===Nasopharynx===

Nasopharyngeal cancer arises in the nasopharynx, the region in which the nasal cavities and the Eustachian tubes connect with the upper part of the throat. While some nasopharyngeal cancers are biologically similar to the common head and neck cancers, &quot;poorly differentiated&quot; nasopharyngeal carcinoma is lymphoepithelioma, which is distinct in its epidemiology, biology, clinical behavior, and treatment and is treated as a separate disease by many experts.

===Throat===

Most oropharyngeal cancers begin in the oropharynx (throat), the middle part of the throat that includes the soft palate, the base of the tongue, and the tonsils. Cancers of the tonsils are more strongly associated with human papillomavirus infection than are cancers of other regions of the head and neck. HPV-positive oropharyngeal cancer generally has a better outcome than HPV-negative disease, with a 54% better survival rate, but this advantage for HPV-associated cancer applies only to oropharyngeal cancers.

People with oropharyngeal carcinomas are at high risk of developing a second primary head and neck cancer.

===Hypopharynx===

The hypopharynx includes the pyriform sinuses, the posterior pharyngeal wall, and the postcricoid area. Tumors of the hypopharynx frequently have an advanced stage at diagnosis and have the most adverse prognoses of pharyngeal tumors. They tend to metastasize early due to the extensive lymphatic network around the larynx.

===Larynx===

Laryngeal cancer begins in the larynx, or &quot;voice box&quot;, and is the second most common type of head and neck cancer encountered. Cancer may occur on the vocal folds themselves (&quot;glottic&quot; cancer) or on tissues above and below the true cords (&quot;supraglottic&quot; and &quot;subglottic&quot; cancers, respectively). Laryngeal cancer is strongly associated with tobacco smoking.

Surgery can include laser excision of small vocal cord lesions, partial laryngectomy (removal of part of the larynx), or total laryngectomy (removal of the whole larynx). If the whole larynx has been removed, the person is left with a permanent tracheostomy. Voice rehabilitation in such patients can be achieved in three important ways: esophageal speech, tracheoesophageal puncture, or electrolarynx. One would likely require intensive teaching, speech therapy, and/or an electronic device.

===Trachea and salivary glands===
Cancer of the trachea is a rare cancer usually classified as a lung cancer.

Most tumors of the salivary glands differ from the common head and neck cancers in cause, histopathology, clinical presentation, and therapy. Other uncommon tumors arising in the head and neck include teratomas, adenocarcinomas, adenoid cystic carcinomas, and mucoepidermoid carcinomas. Rarer still are melanomas and lymphomas of the upper aerodigestive tract.

==Causes==
===Alcohol and tobacco===

Alcohol and tobacco use are major risk factors for head and neck cancer. 72% of head and neck cancer cases are caused by using both alcohol and tobacco. This rises to 89% when looking specifically at laryngeal cancer.

There is thought to be a dose-dependent relationship between alcohol use and development of head and neck cancer where higher rates of alcohol consumption contribute to an increased risk of developing head and neck cancer. Alcohol use following a diagnosis of head and neck cancer also contributes to other negative outcomes. These include physical effects such as an increased risk of developing a second primary cancer or other malignancies, cancer recurrence, and worse prognosis in addition to an increased chance of having a future feeding tube placed and osteoradionecrosis of the jaw. Negative social factors are also increased with sustained alcohol use after diagnosis including unemployment and work disability.

The way in which alcohol contributes to cancer development is not fully understood. It is thought to be related to permanent damage of DNA strands by a metabolite of alcohol called acetaldehyde. Other suggested mechanisms include nutritional deficiencies and genetic variations.

Tobacco smoking is one of the main risk factors for head and neck cancer. Cigarette smokers have a lifetime increased risk for head and neck cancer that is 5 to 25 times higher than the general population. The ex-smoker&#x27;s risk of developing head and neck cancer begins to approach the risk in the general population 15 years after smoking cessation. In addition, people who smoke have a worse prognosis than those who have never smoked. Furthermore, people who continue to smoke after diagnosis of head and neck cancer have the highest probability of dying compared to those who have never smoked. This effect is seen in patients with HPV-positive head and neck cancer as well. It has also been demonstrated that passive smoking, both at work and at home, increases the risk of head and neck cancer.

A major carcinogenic compound in tobacco smoke is acrylonitrile. Acrylonitrile appears to indirectly cause DNA damage by increasing oxidative stress, leading to increased levels of 8-oxo-2&#x27;-deoxyguanosine (8-oxo-dG) and formamidopyrimidine in DNA. (see image). Both 8-oxo-dG and formamidopyrimidine are mutagenic. DNA glycosylase NEIL1 prevents mutagenesis by 8-oxo-dG and removes formamidopyrimidines from DNA.

Smokeless tobacco (including products where tobacco is chewed) is a cause of oral cancer. Increased risk of oral cancer caused by smokeless tobacco is present in countries such as the United States but particularly prevalent in Southeast Asian countries where the use of smokeless tobacco is common. Smokeless tobacco is associated with a higher risk of developing head and neck cancer due to the presence of the tobacco-specific carcinogen N&#x27;-nitrosonornicotine.

Cigar and pipe smoking are also important risk factors for oral cancer. They have a dose dependent relationship with more consumption leading to higher chances of developing cancer. The use of electronic cigarettes may also lead to the development of head and neck cancers due to the substances like propylene glycol, glycerol, nitrosamines, and metals contained therein, which can cause damage to the airways. Exposure to e-vapour has been shown to reduce cell viability and increase the rate of cell death via apoptosis or necrosis with or without nicotine. This area of study requires more research, however. Similarly, additional research is needed to understand how marijuana possibly promotes head and neck cancers. A 2019 meta-analysis did not conclude that marijuana was associated with head and neck cancer risk. Yet individuals with cannabis use disorder were more likely to be diagnosed with such cancers in a large study published 2024.

===Diet===
Many dietary nutrients are associated with cancer protection and its development. Generally, foods with a protective effect with respect to oral cancer demonstrate antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects such as fruits, vegetables, curcumin and green tea. Conversely, pro-inflammatory food substances such as red meat, processed meat and fried food can increase the risk of developing head and neck cancer. An increased adherence to the Mediterranean diet is also related to a lower risk of cancer mortality and a reduced risk of developing multiple cancers including head and neck cancer. Elevated levels of nitrites in preserved meats and salted fish have been shown to increase the risk of nasopharyngeal cancer. Overall, a poor nutritional intake (often associated with alcoholism) with subsequent vitamin deficiencies is a risk factor for head and neck cancer.

In terms of nutritional supplements, antioxidants such as vitamin E and beta-carotene might reduce the toxic effect of radiotherapy in people with head and neck cancer but they can also increase recurrence rates, especially in smokers.

===Betel nut===
Betel nut chewing is associated with an increased risk of head and neck cancer. When chewed with additional tobacco in its preparation (like in gutka), there is an even higher risk, especially for oral and oropharyngeal cancers.

=== Genetics ===
People who develop head and neck cancer may have a genetic predisposition for the condition. There are seven known genetic variations (loci) which specifically increase the chances of developing oral and pharyngeal cancer. Family history, that is having a first-degree relative with head and neck cancer, is also a risk factor. In addition, genetic variations in pathways involved in alcohol metabolism (for example alcohol dehydrogenase) have been associated with an increased head and neck cancer risk.

=== Radiation ===
It is known that prior exposure to radiation of the head and neck is associated with an increased risk of cancer, particularly thyroid, salivary gland and squamous cell carcinomas, although there is a time-delay of many years and the overall risk is still low.

===Infection===
====Human papillomavirus====
Some head and neck cancers, and in particular oropharyngeal cancer, are caused by the human papillomavirus (HPV), and 70% of all head and neck cancer cases are related to HPV. Risk factors for HPV-positive oropharyngeal cancer include multiple sexual partners, anal and oral sex and a weak immune system.

The incidence of HPV-related head and neck cancer is increasing, especially in the Western world. In the United States, the incidence of HPV-positive oropharyngeal cancer has overtaken HPV-positive cervical cancer as the leading HPV related cancer type. An increased incidence has particularly affected males. As a result, recent changes have resulted in the HPV vaccine being offered to adolescent boys between 12-13 (previously only offered to girls between this age due to cervical cancer risks) and men under 45 who have sex with men in the UK.

Over 20 different high-risk HPV subtypes have been implicated in causing head and neck cancer. In particular, HPV-16 is responsible for up to 90% of oropharyngeal cancer in North America. Approximately 15–25% of head and neck cancers contain genomic DNA from HPV, and the association varies based on the site of the tumor. In the case of HPV-positive oropharyngeal cancer, the highest distribution is in the tonsils, where HPV DNA is found in 45–67% of the cases, and it is less often in the hypopharynx (13–25%), and least often in the oral cavity (12–18%) and larynx (3–7%).

Positive HPV16 status is associated with a improved prognosis over HPV-negative oropharyngeal cancer due to better response to radiotherapy and chemotherapy.

HPV can induce tumors by several mechanisms:
# E6 and E7 oncogenic proteins.
# Disruption of tumor suppressor genes.
# High-level DNA amplifications, for example, oncogenes.
# Generating alternative nonfunctional transcripts.
# Interchromosomal rearrangements.
# Distinct host genome methylation and expression patterns, produced even when the virus is not integrated into the host genome.

There are observed biological differences between HPV-positive and HPV-negative head and neck cancer, for example in terms of mutation patterns. In HPV-negative disease, genes frequently mutated include &quot;TP53, CDKN2A&quot; and &quot;PIK3CA&quot;. In HPV-positive disease, these genes are less frequently mutated, and the tumour suppressor gene p53 and pRb (protein retinoblastoma) are commonly inactivated by HPV oncoproteins E6 and E7 respectively. In addition, viral infections such as HPV can cause aberrant DNA methylation during cancer development. HPV-positive head and neck cancers demonstrate higher levels of such DNA methylation compared to HPV-negative disease.

E6 sequesters p53 to promote p53 degradation, while E7 inhibits pRb. Degradation of p53 results in cells being unable to respond to checkpoint signals that are normally present to activate apoptosis when DNA damage is signalled. Loss of pRb leads to deregulation of cell proliferation and apoptosis. Both mechanisms therefore leave cell proliferation unchecked and increase the chance of carcinogenesis.

====Epstein–Barr virus====
Epstein–Barr virus (EBV) infection is associated with nasopharyngeal cancer. Nasopharyngeal cancer caused by EBV commonly occurs in some countries of the Mediterranean and Asia, where EBV antibody titers can be measured to screen high-risk populations.

===Gastroesophageal reflux disease===
The presence of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) or laryngeal reflux disease can also be a major factor. Stomach acids that flow up through the esophagus can damage its lining and raise susceptibility to throat cancer.

===Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation===
People after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) are at a higher risk for oral cancer. Post-HSCT oral cancer may have more aggressive behavior and a poorer prognosis when compared to oral cancer in non-HSCT patients. This effect is supposed to be due to continuous, lifelong immune suppression and chronic oral graft-versus-host disease.

===Other risk factors===
Several other risk factors have been identified in the development of head and neck cancer. These include occupational environmental carcinogen exposure such as asbestos, wood dust, mineral acid, sulfuric acid mists and metal dusts. In addition, weakened immune systems, age greater than 55 years, poor socioeconomic factors such as lower incomes and occupational status, and low body mass index (&lt;18.5 kg/m2) are also risk factors. Poor oral hygiene and chronic oral cavity inflammation (for example secondary to chronic gum inflammation) are also linked to an increased head and neck cancer risk. The presence of leukoplakia, which is the appearance of white patches or spots in the mouth, can develop into cancer in about 1⁄3 of cases.

==Diagnosis==

A significant proportion of people with head and neck cancer will present to their physicians with an already advanced stage disease. This can either be down to patient factors (delays in seeking medical attention), or physician factors (such as delays in referral from primary care, or non-diagnostic investigation results).

A person usually presents to the physician complaining of one or more of the typical symptoms. These symptoms may be site specific (such as a laryngeal cancer causing hoarse voice), or not site specific (earache can be caused by multiple types of head and neck cancers).

The physician will undertake a thorough history to determine the nature of the symptoms and the presence or absence of any risk factors. The physician will also ask about other illnesses such as heart or lung diseases as they may impact their fitness for potentially curative treatment. Clinical examination will involve examination of the neck for any masses, examining inside the mouth for any abnormalities and assessing the rest of the pharynx and larynx with a nasendoscope.

Further investigations will be directed by the symptoms discussed and any abnormalities identified during the exam.

Neck masses typically undergo assessment with ultrasound and a fine-needle aspiration (FNA, a type of needle biopsy). Concerning lesions that are readily accessible (such as in the mouth) can be biopsied with a local anaesthetic. Lesions less readily available can be biopsied either with the patient awake or under a general anaesthetic depending on local expertise and availability of specialist equipment.

The cancer will also need to be staged (accurately determine its size, association with nearby structures, and spread to distant sites). This is typically done by scanning the patient with a combination of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), computed tomography (CT) and/or positron emission tomography (PET). Exactly which investigations are required will depend on a variety of factors such as the site of concern and the size of the tumour.

Some people will present with a neck lump containing cancer cells (identified by FNA) that have spread from elsewhere, but with no identifiable primary site on initial assessment. In such cases people will undergo additional testing to attempt to find the initial site of cancer, as this has significant implications for their treatment. These patients undergo MRI scanning, PET-CT and then panendoscopy and biopsies of any abnormal areas. If the scans and panendoscopy still do not identify a primary site for the cancer, affected people will undergo a bilateral tonsillectomy and tongue base mucosectomy (as these are the most common subsites of cancer that spread to the neck). This procedure can be done with or without robotic assistance.

Once a diagnosis is confirmed, a multidisciplinary discussion of the optimal treatment strategy will be undertaken between the radiation oncologist, surgical oncologist, and medical oncologist. A histopathologist and a radiologist will also be present to discuss the biopsy and imaging findings. Most (90%) cancers of the head and neck are squamous cell-derived, termed &quot;head-and-neck squamous-cell carcinomas&quot;.

===Histopathology===
Throat cancers are classified according to their histology or cell structure and are commonly referred to by their location in the oral cavity and neck. This is because where the cancer appears in the throat affects the prognosis; some throat cancers are more aggressive than others, depending on their location. The stage at which the cancer is diagnosed is also a critical factor in the prognosis of throat cancer. Treatment guidelines recommend routine testing for the presence of HPV for all oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma tumors.

====Squamous-cell carcinoma====
Squamous-cell carcinoma is a cancer of the squamous cell, a kind of epithelial cell found in both the skin and mucous membranes. It accounts for over 90% of all head and neck cancers, including more than 90% of throat cancer. Squamous cell carcinoma is most likely to appear in males over 40 years of age with a history of heavy alcohol use coupled with smoking.

All squamous cell carcinomas arising from the oropharynx, and all neck node metastases of unknown primary should undergo testing for HPV status. This is essential to adequately stage the tumour and adequately plan treatment. Due to the different biology of HPV positive and negative cancers, differentiating HPV status is also important for ongoing research to determine the best treatments.

Nasopharyngeal carcinomas, or neck node metastases possibly arising from the nasopharynx will also be tested for Ebstein Barr virus.

The tumor marker Cyfra 21-1 may be useful in diagnosing squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (SCCHN).

====Adenocarcinoma====
Adenocarcinoma is a cancer of the epithelial tissue that has glandular characteristics. Several head and neck cancers are adenocarcinomas (either of intestinal or non-intestinal cell types).

==Prevention==
Avoidance of risk factors (such as smoking and alcohol) is the single most effective form of prevention.

Regular dental examinations may identify pre-cancerous lesions in the oral cavity. While screening in the general population does not appear to be useful, screening high-risk groups by examination of the throat might be useful. Head and neck cancer is often curable if it is diagnosed early; however, outcomes are typically poor if it is diagnosed late.

When diagnosed early, oral, head, and neck cancers can be treated more easily, and the chances of survival increase tremendously. The HPV vaccine helps to prevent the development of HPV-related oropharyngeal cancer.

==Management==

Improvements in diagnosis and local management, as well as targeted therapy, have led to improvements in quality of life and survival for people with head and neck cancer.

After a histologic diagnosis has been established and tumor extent determined, such as with the use of PET-CT, the selection of appropriate treatment for a specific cancer depends on a complex array of variables, including tumor site, relative morbidity of various treatment options, concomitant health problems, social and logistic factors, previous primary tumors, and the person&#x27;s preference. Treatment planning generally requires a multidisciplinary approach involving specialist surgeons, medical oncologists, and radiation oncologists. 

Surgical resection and radiation therapy are the mainstays of treatment for most head and neck cancers and remain the standard of care in most cases. For small primary cancers without regional metastases (stage I or II), wide surgical excision alone or curative radiation therapy alone is used. For more extensive primary tumors or those with regional metastases (stage III or IV), planned combinations of pre- or postoperative radiation and complete surgical excision are generally used. More recently, as historical survival and control rates have been recognized as less than satisfactory, there has been an emphasis on the use of various induction or concomitant chemotherapy regimens.

===Surgery===
Surgery as a treatment is frequently used for most types of head and neck cancer. Usually, the goal is to remove the cancerous cells entirely. This can be particularly tricky if the cancer is near the larynx and can result in the person being unable to speak. Surgery is also commonly used to resect (remove) some or all of the cervical lymph nodes to prevent further spread of the disease. Transoral robotic surgery (TORS) is gaining popularity worldwide as the technology and training become more accessible. It now has an established role in the treatment of early stage oropharyngeal cancer. There is also a growing trend worldwide towards TORS for the surgical treatment of laryngeal and hypopharyngeal tumours.

CO2 laser surgery is also another form of treatment. Transoral laser microsurgery allows surgeons to remove tumors from the voice box with no external incisions. It also allows access to tumors that are not reachable with robotic surgery. During the surgery, the surgeon and pathologist work together to assess the adequacy of excision (&quot;margin status&quot;), minimizing the amount of normal tissue removed or damaged. This technique helps give the person as much speech and swallowing function as possible after surgery.

===Radiation therapy===

Radiation therapy is the most common form of treatment. There are different forms of radiation therapy, including 3D conformal radiation therapy, intensity-modulated radiation therapy, particle beam therapy, and brachytherapy, which are commonly used in the treatment of cancers of the head and neck. Most people with head and neck cancer who are treated in the United States and Europe are treated with intensity-modulated radiation therapy using high-energy photons. At higher doses, head and neck radiation is associated with thyroid dysfunction and pituitary axis dysfunction. Radiation therapy for head and neck cancers can also cause acute skin reactions of varying severity, which can be treated and managed with topically applied creams or specialist films.

===Chemotherapy===
Chemotherapy for throat cancer is not generally used to &quot;cure&quot; the cancer as such. Instead, it is used to provide an inhospitable environment for metastases so that they will not establish themselves in other parts of the body. Typical chemotherapy agents are a combination of paclitaxel and carboplatin. Cetuximab is also used in the treatment of throat cancer.

Docetaxel-based chemotherapy has shown a very good response in locally advanced head and neck cancer. Docetaxel is the only taxane approved by the FDA for head and neck cancer, in combination with cisplatin and fluorouracil for the induction treatment of inoperable, locally advanced head and neck cancer.

While not specifically a chemotherapy, amifostine is often administered intravenously by a chemotherapy clinic prior to IMRT radiotherapy sessions. Amifostine protects the gums and salivary glands from the effects of radiation.

There is no evidence that erythropoietin should be routinely given with radiotherapy.

===Photodynamic therapy===
Photodynamic therapy may have promise for treating mucosal dysplasia and small head and neck tumors. Amphinex is showing good results in early clinical trials for the treatment of advanced head and neck cancer.

===Targeted therapy===
Targeted therapy, according to the National Cancer Institute, is &quot;a type of treatment that uses drugs or other substances, such as monoclonal antibodies, to identify and attack specific cancer cells without harming normal cells.&quot; Some targeted therapies used in head and neck cancers include cetuximab, bevacizumab, and erlotinib.

Cetuximab is used for treating people with advanced-stage cancer who cannot be treated with conventional chemotherapy (cisplatin). However, cetuximab&#x27;s efficacy is still under investigation by researchers.

Gendicine is a gene therapy that employs an adenovirus to deliver the tumor suppressor gene p53 to cells. It was approved in China in 2003 for the treatment of head and neck cancer.

The mutational profiles of HPV+ and HPV- head and neck cancer have been reported, further demonstrating that they are fundamentally distinct diseases.
===Immunotherapy===
Immunotherapy is a type of treatment that activates the immune system to fight cancer. One type of immunotherapy, immune checkpoint blockade, binds to and blocks inhibitory signals on immune cells to release their anti-cancer activities.

In 2016, the FDA granted accelerated approval to pembrolizumab for the treatment of people with recurrent or metastatic head and neck cancer with disease progression on or after platinum-containing chemotherapy. Later that year, the FDA approved nivolumab for the treatment of recurrent or metastatic head and neck cancer with disease progression on or after platinum-based chemotherapy. In 2019, the FDA approved pembrolizumab for the first-line treatment of metastatic or unresectable recurrent head and neck cancer.

===Treatment side effects===
Depending on the treatment used, people with head and neck cancer may experience the following symptoms and treatment side effects:

* Eating problems
* Pain associated with lesions
* Mucositis
* Nephrotoxicity and ototoxicity
* Xerostomia
* Gastroesophageal reflux
* Radiation-induced osteonecrosis of the jaw
* Radiation-induced acute skin reactions
=== Psychosocial ===
Programs to support the emotional and social well-being of people who have been diagnosed with head and neck cancer may be offered. There is no clear evidence on the effectiveness of these interventions or any particular type of psychosocial program or length of time that is most helpful for those with head and neck cancer.

==Prognosis==
Although early-stage head and neck cancers (especially laryngeal and oral cavity) have high cure rates, up to 50% of people with head and neck cancer present with advanced disease.
Cure rates decrease in locally advanced cases, whose probability of cure is inversely related to tumor size and even more so to the extent of regional node involvement. HPV-associated oropharyngeal cancer has been shown to respond better to chemoradiation and, subsequently, have a better prognosis compared to non-associated HPV head and neck cancer.

Consensus panels in America (AJCC) and Europe (UICC) have established staging systems for head and neck cancers. These staging systems attempt to standardize clinical trial criteria for research studies and define prognostic categories of disease. Head and neck cancers are staged according to the TNM classification system, where T is the size and configuration of the tumor, N is the presence or absence of lymph node metastases, and M is the presence or absence of distant metastases. The T, N, and M characteristics are combined to produce a &quot;stage&quot; of the cancer, from I to IVB.

===Problem of second primaries===
Survival advantages provided by new treatment modalities have been undermined by the significant percentage of people cured of head and neck cancer who subsequently develop second primary tumors. The incidence of second primary tumors ranges in studies from 9%
to 23%
at 20 years. Second primary tumors are the major threat to long-term survival after successful therapy of early-stage head and neck cancer. Their high incidence results from the same carcinogenic exposure responsible for the initial primary process, called field cancerization.

===Digestive system===
Many people with head and neck cancer are also not able to eat sufficiently. A tumor may impair a person&#x27;s ability to swallow and eat, and throat cancer may affect the digestive system. The difficulty in swallowing can cause a person to choke on their food in the early stages of digestion and interfere with the food&#x27;s smooth travel down into the esophagus and beyond.

The treatments for throat cancer can also be harmful to the digestive system as well as other body systems. Radiation therapy can lead to nausea and vomiting, which can deprive the body of vital fluids (although these may be obtained through intravenous fluids if necessary). Frequent vomiting can lead to an electrolyte imbalance, which has serious consequences for the proper functioning of the heart. Frequent vomiting can also upset the balance of stomach acids, which has a negative impact on the digestive system, especially the lining of the stomach and esophagus.

Enteral feeding, a method that adds nutrients directly into a person&#x27;s stomach using a nasogastric feeding tube or a gastrostomy tube, may be necessary for some people. Further research is required to determine the most effective method of enteral feeding to ensure that people undergoing radiotherapy or chemoradiation treatment are able to stay nourished during their treatment.

=== Mental health ===
Cancer in the head or neck may impact a person&#x27;s mental well-being and can sometimes lead to social isolation. This largely results from a decreased ability or inability to eat, speak, or effectively communicate. Physical appearance is often altered by the cancer itself and/or as a consequence of treatment side effects. Psychological distress may occur, and feelings such as uncertainty and fear may arise. Some people may also have a changed physical appearance, differences in swallowing or breathing, and residual pain to manage.

Caregiver stress

Caregivers for people with head and neck cancer show higher rates of caregiver stress and poorer mental health compared to both the general population and those caring for non-head and neck cancer patients. The high symptom burden patients&#x27; experience necessitates complex caregiver roles, often requiring hospital staff training, which caregivers can find distressing when asked to do so for the first time. It is becoming increasingly apparent that caregivers (most often spouses, children, or close family members) might not be adequately informed about, prepared for, or trained for the tasks and roles they will encounter during the treatment and recovery phases of this unique patient population, which span both technical and emotional support. Of note, caregivers of patients who report lower quality of life demonstrate increased burden and fatigue that extend beyond the treatment phase.

Examples of technically difficult caregiver duties include tube feeding, oral suctioning, wound maintenance, medication delivery safe for tube feeding, and troubleshooting home medical equipment. If the cancer affects the mouth or larynx, caregivers must also find a way to effectively communicate among themselves and with their healthcare team. This is in addition to providing emotional support for the person undergoing cancer therapy.

===Others===
Like any cancer, metastasis affects many areas of the body as the cancer spreads from cell to cell and organ to organ. For example, if it spreads to the bone marrow, it will prevent the body from producing enough red blood cells and affect the proper functioning of the white blood cells and the body&#x27;s immune system; spreading to the circulatory system will prevent oxygen from being transported to all the cells of the body; and throat cancer can throw the nervous system into chaos, making it unable to properly regulate and control the body.

==Epidemiology==

Globally, head and neck cancer accounts for 650,000 new cases of cancer and 330,000 deaths annually on average. In 2018, it was the seventh most common cancer worldwide, with 890,000 new cases documented and 450,000 people dying from the disease. The risk of developing head and neck cancer increases with age, especially after 50 years. Most people who do so are between 50 and 70 years old.

In North America and Europe, the tumors usually arise from the oral cavity, oropharynx, or larynx, whereas nasopharyngeal cancer is more common in the Mediterranean countries and in the Far East. In Southeast China and Taiwan, head and neck cancer, specifically nasopharyngeal cancer, is the most common cause of death in young men.

=== United States ===
In the United States, head and neck cancer makes up 3% of all cancer cases (averaging 53,000 new diagnoses per year) and 1.5% of cancer deaths. The 2017 worldwide figure cites head and neck cancers as representing 5.3% of all cancers (not including non-melanoma skin cancers). Notably, head and neck cancer secondary to chronic alcohol or tobacco use has been steadily declining as less of the population chronically smokes tobacco. However, HPV-associated oropharyngeal cancer is rising, particularly in younger people in westernized nations, which is thought to be reflective of changes in oral sexual practices, specifically with regard to the number of oral sexual partners. This increase since the 1970s has mostly affected wealthier nations and male populations. This is due to evidence suggesting that transmission rates of HPV from women to men are higher than from men to women, as women often have a higher immune response to infection.
* In 2008, there were 22,900 cases of oral cavity cancer, 12,250 cases of laryngeal cancer, and 12,410 cases of pharyngeal cancer in the United States.
* In 2002, 7,400 Americans were projected to die of these cancers.
* More than 70% of throat cancers are at an advanced stage when discovered.
* Men are 89% more likely than women to be diagnosed with these cancers and are almost twice as likely to die of them.
* African Americans are disproportionately affected by head and neck cancer, with younger ages of incidence, increased mortality, and more advanced disease at presentation. Laryngeal cancer incidence is higher in African Americans relative to white, Asian, and Hispanic populations. There is a lower survival rate for similar tumor states in African Americans with head and neck cancer.

==Research==
Immunotherapy with immune checkpoint inhibitors is being investigated in head and neck cancers.

<text>The Junius Street station is a station on the IRT New Lots Line of the New York City Subway. Located at the intersection of Junius Street and Livonia Avenue in Brownsville, Brooklyn, it is served by the 3 train at all times except late nights, when the 4 train takes over service. During rush hours, occasional 2, 4 and 5 trains also stop here.

== History ==
The New Lots Line was built as a part of Contract 3 of the Dual Contracts between New York City and the Interborough Rapid Transit Company, including this station. It was built as an elevated line because the ground in this area is right above the water table, and as a result the construction of a subway would have been prohibitively expensive. This station opened along with the first portion of the line from Utica Avenue on November 22, 1920, with shuttle trains operating over this route. This station ceased to be the line&#x27;s terminal when the line opened one more stop farther to the east to Pennsylvania Avenue on December 24, 1920, using its southbound platform. The line was completed to New Lots Avenue on October 16, 1922, with a two-car train running on the northbound track. On October 31, 1924, through service to New Lots Avenue was begun.

From October 5, 2016, to June 19, 2017, this station and Sutter Avenue–Rutland Road were closed for renovations.

===Transfer with Canarsie Line===

The New Lots Line passes over the Livonia Avenue station on the BMT Canarsie Line () directly to the east of this station. There is a free out-of-system transfer between the stations; passengers must leave one station and use a MetroCard or OMNY to enter the other station. The out-of-system transfer is made via an overpass running parallel to the New Lots Line, which allows pedestrians on Livonia Avenue to cross over the Long Island Rail Road&#x27;s open-cut Bay Ridge Branch.

In 2015, there were proposals to convert the overpass into a free-transfer passage between the two stations, due to increasing ridership and plans for additional housing in the area. Money was allocated in the 2015–2019 Capital Program to build this transfer. Both stations would also have been upgraded to become compliant with mobility accessibility guidelines under the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990. However, in the April 2018 revision to the Capital Program, funding for the project, with the exception of funding already used to design the connection, was removed. A free MetroCard-only transfer between the two stations was also provided during weekends and late nights as part of the reconstruction of the 14th Street Tunnel starting in April 2019 and introduced permanently in February 2020. The 2020–2024 Capital Program added back funding for the project, with an allocation of $38.4 million; by January 2020, only $400,000 of that amount had been spent on &quot;pre-design&quot; activities. In February 2020, the MTA awarded a design–build contract to construct the free transfer and associated elevator upgrades. In November 2022, the MTA announced that it would award a $965 million contract for the installation of 21 elevators across eight stations, including Junius Street. A joint venture of ASTM and Halmar International would construct the elevators under a public-private partnership.

==Station layout==
There are two side platforms and three tracks. It is the only station on the line with a center track, which was installed sometime before 1987. However, it does not have a third rail and thus can only be used by diesel trains or other non-electric equipment. Just west (railroad north) of the station, tracks split from both the northbound and southbound tracks, merging to form the center track; this goes through the station and turns south, crossing the southbound track at grade. The track joins with one from the BMT Canarsie Line and heads to the Linden Shops. Both platforms have beige windscreens and green canopies that run for the entire length.

East of this station, the New Lots Line passes over the BMT Canarsie Line. At Junius Street, a block from the station entrance, an overpass running parallel to the New Lots Line allows pedestrians on Livonia Avenue to cross over the Long Island Rail Road&#x27;s open-cut Bay Ridge Branch. This overpass leads to the main entrance of the Livonia Avenue station on the BMT Canarsie Line.

===Exits===
Despite the station name, there are no actual entrances to this station on Junius Street; they were removed many years ago. The two street stairs to the station&#x27;s only mezzanine are a block away on the south side of Livonia Avenue between Powell and Sackman Streets. The small, elevated mezzanine/station house beneath the tracks has a token booth, turnstile bank, and two staircases to the center of each of the two side platforms.

<text>The Pennsylvania Avenue station is a station on the IRT New Lots Line of the New York City Subway. Located at the intersection of Pennsylvania and Livonia Avenues in East New York, Brooklyn, it is served by the 3 train at all times except late nights, when the 4 train takes over service. During rush hours, occasional 2, 4 and 5 trains also stop here.

== History ==

The New Lots Line was built as a part of Contract 3 of the Dual Contracts between New York City and the Interborough Rapid Transit Company, including this station. It was built as an elevated line because the ground in this area is right above the water table, and as a result the construction of a subway would have been prohibitively expensive. The first portion of the line between Utica Avenue and Junius Street opened on November 22, 1920, with shuttle trains operating over this route. The line opened one more stop farther to the east to Pennsylvania Avenue on December 24, 1920. At that date, only the southbound platform was used.

While work at New Lots Avenue and at Van Siclen Avenue was practically completed in 1921, they could not open yet because trains could not run to the terminal until track work, the signal tower, and the compressor room were in service. Work began on June 19, 1922, and on October 16, 1922, shuttles began operating between this station and New Lots Avenue. A two-car train operated on a single track on the northbound track. On October 31, 1924, through service to New Lots Avenue was begun.

From April 11, 2016 until September 19, 2016, Saratoga Avenue and Pennsylvania Avenue were closed for renovation. A truck accident on October 27, 2016 damaged the station&#x27;s mezzanine, so it was closed again for repairs until March 3, 2017. The platforms and tracks were undamaged in the accident.

==Station layout==
This elevated station has two side platforms and two tracks with space for a center track that was never installed. Both platforms have beige windscreens and brown canopies with green support frames and columns that run along the entire length except for a small section at the extreme west (railroad north) end. Here, there are only waist-high black steel fences. The station name plates are in the standard black with white lettering. The platforms are slightly longer than the standard IRT train length of .

===Exits===
The station&#x27;s only entrance/exit is an elevated station house beneath the tracks. Inside fare control, there is a turnstile bank, waiting area that allows a free transfer between directions, and a single staircase to each platform at their extreme east (railroad south) ends. Outside fare control, there is a token booth and two staircases going down to the northeast and southwest corners of Pennsylvania and Livonia Avenues. The landing on the south side of the station house has an exit-only turnstile to allow passengers on New Lots Avenue-bound trains to exit the station without having to go through the station house. The exterior of the station house, including the staircase canopies, doors, and fences were painted red in July 2009.

On October 31, 1924, through service to New Lots Avenue was begun.

As part of an 18-month capital budget that took effect on January 1, 1963, this station was reconstructed.

In 1968, as part of the proposed Program for Action, the IRT New Lots Line would have been extended southerly through the Livonia Yard to Flatlands Avenue to a modern terminal at Flatlands Avenue and Linwood Street, replacing the New Lots Avenue terminal. This line would have run at ground level and it would have provided better access to the then-growing community of Spring Creek. This extension would have been completed at the cost of $12 million.

In 2019, the MTA announced that this station would become ADA-accessible as part of the agency&#x27;s 2020–2024 Capital Program. A request for proposals was put out on May 18, 2023 for the contract for a project bundle to make 13 stations accessible, including New Lots Avenue. The contract to add one elevator at the station was awarded in December 2023.

==Station layout==
This elevated station has two tracks and one island platform. The station has an active tower and crew quarters at platform level. The platform has a canopy for most of its length.

To the east of the station, the tracks curve into Livonia Yard. Northeast of the station, there is a never-used trackway structure which continues for about . This extension was a provision for the line to continue east on New Lots Avenue.

===Exits===
The station&#x27;s sole exit is two staircases to either western corner of Livonia Avenue and Ashford Street via an elevated, wooden mezzanine/station house under the far eastern end of the platform.
