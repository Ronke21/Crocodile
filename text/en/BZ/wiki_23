<text>Probiotics are live microorganisms promoted with claims that they provide health benefits when consumed, generally by improving or restoring the gut microbiota. Probiotics are considered generally safe to consume, but may cause bacteria-host interactions and unwanted side effects in rare cases. There is some evidence that probiotics are beneficial for some conditions, such as helping to ease some symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). However, many claimed health benefits, such as treating eczema, lack substantial scientific support.

The first discovered probiotic was a certain strain of bacillus in Bulgarian yoghurt, called &quot;Lactobacillus bulgaricus&quot;. The discovery was made in 1905 by Bulgarian physician and microbiologist Stamen Grigorov. The modern-day theory is generally attributed to Russian Nobel Prize laureate Élie Metchnikoff, who postulated around 1907 that yoghurt-consuming Bulgarian peasants lived longer.

A growing probiotics market has led to the need for stricter requirements for scientific substantiation of putative benefits conferred by microorganisms claimed to be probiotic. Although some evidence claimed benefits are marketed towards using probiotic, such as reducing gastrointestinal discomfort, improving immune health, relieving constipation, or avoiding the common cold, such claims are strain-specific and cannot be extrapolated to other strains. As of 2019, numerous applications for approval of health claims by European manufacturers of probiotic dietary supplements have been rejected by the European Food Safety Authority for insufficient evidence of beneficial mechanism or efficacy.

== Definition ==
An October 2001 report by the World Health Organization (WHO) defines probiotics as &quot;live microorganisms which when administered in adequate amounts confer a health benefit on the host.&quot; Following this definition, a working group convened by the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO)/WHO in May 2002 issued the &quot;Guidelines for the Evaluation of Probiotics in Food&quot;. A consensus definition of the term &quot;probiotics&quot;, based on available information and scientific evidence, was adopted after the aforementioned joint expert consultation between the FAO of the United Nations and the WHO. This effort was accompanied by local governmental and supra-governmental regulatory bodies&#x27; requirements to better characterize health claims substantiations.

That first global effort was further developed in 2010; two expert groups of academic scientists and industry representatives made recommendations for the evaluation and validation of probiotic health claims. The same principles emerged from those two groups as were expressed in the &quot;Guidelines&quot; of FAO/WHO in 2002. This definition, though widely adopted, is not acceptable to the European Food Safety Authority because it embeds a health claim that is not measurable.

A group of scientific experts assembled in Canada in October 2013 to discuss the scope and appropriate use of the term &quot;probiotic&quot;, adjusting the definition to be &quot;live microorganisms that, when administered in adequate amounts, confer a health benefit on the host.&quot;

== In food ==
Live probiotic cultures are part of fermented dairy products, other fermented foods, and probiotic-fortified foods.

Lactic acid bacteria (LAB), which are food fermenting bacteria, have the ability to prevent food spoilage and can improve the nutritive value of the foods they inhabit. Acid fermentation (as well as salting), remains one of the most practical methods of preservation of fresh vegetables, cereal gruels, and milk-cereal mixtures due to its low cost and energy requirements.

Fermented products that contain lactic acid bacteria include vegetables such as pickled vegetables, kimchi, pao cai, and sauerkraut; sourdough bread or bread-like products made without wheat or rye flour, amino acid/peptide meat-flavored sauces and pastes produced by fermentation of cereals and legumes; fermented cereal-fish-shrimp mixtures and fermented meats; soy products such as tempeh, miso, and soy sauce; dairy products such as yogurt, kefir, buttermilk; and non-dairy products such as bee pollen.

More precisely, sauerkraut contains the bacteria &quot;Leuconostoc mesenteroides, Lactobacillus plantarum, Pediococcus pentosaceus, Lactobacillus brevis, Leuconostoc citreum, Leuconostoc argentinum, Lactobacillus paraplantarum, Lactobacillus coryniformis&quot;, and&quot; Weissella&quot; spp. Kimchi contains the bacteria &quot;Leuconostoc&quot; spp., &quot;Weissella&quot; spp., and&quot; Lactobacillus&quot; spp. Pao cai contains &quot;L. pentosus, L. plantarum , Leuconostoc mesenteroides , L. brevis, L. lactis&quot;, and &quot;L. fermentum&quot;.
A list of many other bacteria found in several Asian fermented fruits and vegetables also is available. Kefir contains &quot;Lactobacillus acidophilus, Bifidobacterium bifidum, Streptococcus thermophilus, Lactobacillus delbrueckii&quot; subsp. &quot;bulgaricus, Lactobacillus helveticus, Lactobacillus kefiranofaciens, Lactococcus lactis&quot;, and &quot;Leuconostoc &quot;species. Buttermilk contains either &quot;Lactococcus lactis&quot; or &quot;L. bulgaricus&quot;. Other acidic bacteria, said to be probiotic, can be found in kombucha, including &quot;Gluconacetobacter xylinus&quot;,&quot; Zygosaccharomyces&quot; sp.,&quot; Acetobacter pasteurianus, Acetobacter aceti&quot;, and &quot;Gluconobacter oxydans&quot;.

== Dosage ==
It is incorrect to think that a higher colony forming units (CFU) count corresponds to greater efficacy - rather, probiotic efficacy is strain- and disease specific.

== Side effects ==
The manipulation of the gut microbiota is complex and may cause bacteria-host interactions. Though probiotics are considered safe, some have concerns about their safety in certain cases. Some people, such as those with immunodeficiency, short bowel syndrome, central venous catheters, and cardiac valve disease, and premature infants, may be at higher risk for adverse events. In severely ill people with inflammatory bowel disease, a risk exists for the passage of viable bacteria from the gastrointestinal tract to the internal organs (bacterial translocation) as a consequence of bacteremia, which can cause adverse health consequences. Rarely, consumption of probiotics by children with lowered immune system function or who are already critically ill may result in bacteremia or fungemia (i.e., bacteria or fungi in the blood), which can lead to sepsis, a potentially fatal disease.

Probiotic supplements typically contain between one and ten billion colony-forming units (CFUs) per dose. A higher number of CFUs does not provide additional probiotic effects, but may have unintended consequences of causing digestive discomfort, such as bloating, gas, and diarrhea.

&quot;Lactobacillus&quot; species have been suggested to contribute to obesity in humans, but no evidence of this relationship has been found.

==Consumption==
In 2015, the global retail market value for probiotics was US$41 billion, including sales of probiotic supplements, fermented milk products, and yogurt, which alone accounted for 75% of total consumption. Innovation in probiotic products in 2015 was mainly from supplements, which produced US$4 billion and was projected to grow 37% globally by 2020. Consumption of yogurt products in China has increased by 20% per year since 2014.

== Regulation ==
, the European Food Safety Authority has rejected all petitions by commercial manufacturers for health claims on probiotic products in Europe due to insufficient evidence for a cause-and-effect mechanism for benefit, thus inconclusive proof of effectiveness. The European Commission placed a ban on putting the word &quot;probiotic&quot; on the packaging of products because such labeling misleads consumers to believe a health benefit is provided by the product when no scientific proof exists to demonstrate that health effect.

In the United States, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and Federal Trade Commission (FTC) have issued warning letters and imposed punishment on various manufacturers of probiotic products whose labels claim to treat a disease or condition. Food product labeling requires language approved by the FDA, so probiotic manufacturers have received warning letters for making disease or treatment claims. The FTC has taken punitive actions, including a US$21 million fine coordinated by 39 different state governments against a major probiotic manufacturer for deceptive advertising and exaggerated claims of health benefits for yogurt and probiotic dairy drink.

In Vietnam, the Vietnam Food Administration (VFA) under the Ministry of Health, in collaboration with other relevant authorities, oversees and addresses violations related to probiotic products. This includes issuing warnings, imposing administrative penalties, demanding product recalls and coordinating with other agencies.

=== Yogurt labeling ===
The National Yogurt Association (NYA) of the United States gives a &quot;Live &amp; Active Cultures Seal&quot; to refrigerated yogurt products that contain 100 million cells per gram, or frozen yogurt products that contain 10 million cells per gram at the time of manufacture. In 2002, the FDA and WHO recommended that &quot;the minimum viable numbers of each probiotic strain at the end of the shelf-life&quot; be reported on labeling, but most companies that give a number report the viable cell count at the date of manufacture, a number that could be much higher than that which exists at consumption. Because of the variability in storage conditions and time before eating, exactly how many active culture cells remain at the time of consumption is difficult to determine. The survival of probiotics was strongly dependent on the storage temperature and remarkable viability loss occurred in room temperature compared to refrigerated storage.

== History ==
Probiotics have received renewed attention in the 21st century from product manufacturers, research studies, and consumers. Their history can be traced to the first use of cheese and fermented products, which were well-known to the Greeks and Romans who recommended their consumption. The fermentation of dairy foods represents one of the oldest techniques for food preservation.
The original modern hypothesis of the positive role played by certain bacteria was first introduced by Russian scientist and Nobel Prize laureate Élie Metchnikoff, who in 1907 suggested that it would be possible to modify the gut microbiota and to replace harmful microbes with useful microbes. Metchnikoff, at that time a professor at the Pasteur Institute in Paris, proposed the hypothesis that the aging process results from the activity of putrefactive (proteolytic) microbes producing toxic substances in the large bowel. Proteolytic bacteria such as clostridia, which are part of the normal gut microbiota, produce toxic substances including phenols, indols, and ammonia from the digestion of proteins. According to Metchnikoff, these compounds were responsible for what he called &quot;intestinal autointoxication&quot;, which would cause the physical changes associated with old age.

At that time, milk fermented with lactobacillales were known to inhibit the growth of proteolytic bacteria because of the low pH produced by the fermentation of lactose. Metchnikoff had also observed that certain rural populations in Europe, for example in Bulgaria and the Russian steppes, who lived largely on milk fermented by lactic-acid bacteria, were exceptionally long-lived. Based on these observations, Metchnikoff proposed that consumption of fermented milk would &quot;seed&quot; the intestine with harmless lactic-acid bacteria and decrease the intestinal pH, and that this would suppress the growth of proteolytic bacteria. Metchnikoff himself introduced in his diet sour milk fermented with the bacteria he called &quot;Bulgarian Bacillus&quot; and believed his health benefited. Friends in Paris soon followed his example and physicians began prescribing the sour-milk diet for their patients.

Bifidobacteria was first isolated from a breastfed infant by Henry Tissier, who also worked at the Pasteur Institute. The isolated bacterium named &quot;Bacillus bifidus communis&quot; was later renamed to the genus &quot;Bifidobacterium&quot;. Tissier found that bifidobacteria are dominant in the gut microbiota of breast-fed babies and he observed clinical benefits from treating infant diarrhea with bifidobacteria.

During an outbreak of shigellosis in 1917, German professor Alfred Nissle isolated a strain of &quot;Escherichia coli&quot; from the feces of a soldier who was not affected by the disease. Methods of treating infectious diseases were needed at that time when antibiotics were not yet available, and Nissle used the &quot;E. coli&quot; Nissle 1917 strain in acute gastrointestinal infectious salmonellosis and shigellosis.

In 1920, Rettger and Cheplin reported that Metchnikoff&#x27;s &quot;Bulgarian Bacillus&quot;, later called &quot;Lactobacillus delbrueckii &quot;subsp.&quot; bulgaricus&quot;, could not live in the human intestine. They conducted experiments involving rats and humans volunteers, feeding them with &quot;Lactobacillus acidophilus&quot;. They observed the disappearance of the pathogenic protist Balantidium coli as well as of other gas-producing bacteria. Rettger further explored the possibilities of &quot;L. acidophilus&quot;, and reasoned that bacteria originating from the gut were more likely to produce the desired effect in this environment. In 1935, certain strains of &quot;L. acidophilus&quot; were found very active when implanted in the human digestive tract.

Contrasting antibiotics, probiotics were defined as microbially derived factors that stimulate the growth of other microorganisms. In 1989, Roy Fuller suggested a definition of probiotics that have been widely used: &quot;A live microbial feed supplement which beneficially affects the host animal by improving its intestinal microbial balance.&quot; Fuller&#x27;s definition emphasizes the requirement of viability for probiotics and introduces the aspect of a beneficial effect on the host.

The term &quot;probiotic&quot; originally referred to microorganisms that have effects on other microorganisms. The concept of probiotics involved the notion that substances secreted by one microorganism stimulated the growth of another microorganism. The term was used again to describe tissue extracts that stimulated microbial growth. The term probiotics was taken up by Parker, who defined the concept as, &quot;Organisms and substances that have a beneficial effect on the host animal by contributing to its intestinal microbial balance.&quot; Later, the definition was greatly improved by Fuller, whose explanation was very close to the definition used today. Fuller described probiotics as a &quot;live microbial feed supplement which beneficially affects the host animal by improving its intestinal microbial balance.&quot; He stressed two important claims for probiotics: the viable nature of probiotics and the capacity to help with intestinal balance.

In the following decades, intestinal lactic-acid bacterial species with alleged health-beneficial properties were introduced as probiotics, including &quot;Lactobacillus rhamnosus&quot;, &quot;Lactobacillus casei&quot;, and &quot;Lactobacillus johnsonii&quot;.

=== Etymology ===
Some literature gives the word a full Greek etymology, but it appears to be a composite of the Latin preposition &quot;pro&quot;, meaning &#x27;for&#x27;, and the Greek adjective βιωτικός (&quot;biōtikos&quot;), meaning &#x27;fit for life, lively&#x27;, the latter deriving from the noun βίος (&quot;bios&quot;), meaning &#x27;life&#x27;. The term contrasts etymologically with the term &quot;antibiotic&quot;, although it is not a complete antonym. The related term &quot;prebiotic&quot; comes from the Latin &quot;prae&quot;, meaning &#x27;before&#x27;, and refers to a substance that is not digested, but rather may be fermented to promote the growth of beneficial intestinal microorganisms.

== Research ==
As food products or dietary supplements, probiotics are under preliminary research to evaluate if they provide any effect on health. In all cases proposed as health claims to the European Food Safety Authority, the scientific evidence remains insufficient to prove a cause-and-effect relationship between consumption of probiotic products and any health benefit. There is no scientific basis for extrapolating an effect from a tested strain to an untested strain. Improved health through gut flora modulation appears to be directly related to long-term dietary changes. Claims that some lactobacilli may contribute to weight gain in some humans remain controversial.

=== Acute otitis media ===
There is inconsistency in the results of different groups of 3488 children as reported in a Cochrane review. Also, it shows no significant difference regarding the adverse effects between probiotic and the other comparators.

=== Allergies ===
Only limited, low-quality evidence exists to indicate that probiotics are helpful for treating people with milk allergy. A 2015 review showed low-quality evidence that probiotics given directly to infants with eczema, or in infants whose mothers used probiotics during the last trimester of pregnancy and breastfeeding, had lower risk of eczema.

=== Asthma ===
It is unclear whether probiotic supplementation helps with childhood asthma, as the quality of research evidence is low.

=== Antibiotic-associated diarrhea ===
Antibiotics are a common treatment for children, with 11% to 40% of antibiotic-treated children developing diarrhea. Antibiotic-associated diarrhea (AAD) results from an imbalance in the colonic microbiota caused by antibiotic therapy. These microbial community alterations result in changes in carbohydrate metabolism, with decreased short-chain fatty acid absorption and osmotic diarrhea as a result. A 2015 Cochrane review concluded that a protective effect of some probiotics existed for AAD in children. The known risks of using probiotics for treating &quot;Clostridioides difficile&quot; outweighs the uncertain benefits.

Probiotic treatment might reduce the incidence and severity of AAD as indicated in several meta-analyses. For example, treatment with probiotic formulations including &quot;L. rhamnosus&quot; may reduce the risk of AAD, improve stool consistency during antibiotic therapy, and enhance the immune response after vaccination.

The potential efficacy of probiotics to treat AAD depends on the probiotic strains and dosage. One review recommended for children &quot;L. rhamnosus&quot; or &quot;Saccharomyces boulardii&quot; at 5 to 40 billion colony-forming units/day, given the modest number needed to treat and the likelihood that adverse events are very rare. The same review stated that probiotic use should be avoided in pediatric populations at risk for adverse events, such as severely debilitated or immune-compromised children.

=== Bacterial vaginosis ===
Probiotic treatment of bacterial vaginosis is the application or ingestion of bacterial species found in the healthy vagina to cure the infection of bacteria causing bacterial vaginosis. This treatment is based on the observation that 70% of healthy females have a group of bacteria in the genus &quot;Lactobacillus&quot; that dominate the population of organisms in the vagina. Specific strains of lactobacilli inhibit the growth of bacteria causing BV by producing H2O2, lactic acid, and/or bacteriocins, and/or inhibit the adherence of &quot;Gardnerella vaginalis&quot; to the vaginal epithelium, which prevents the infection from occurring in the vagina. Currently, the success of probiotic treatment has been mixed, since the use of probiotics to restore healthy populations of &quot;Lactobacillus&quot; has not been standardized. Often, standard antibiotic treatment is used at the same time that probiotics are being tested. In addition, some groups of women respond to treatment based upon ethnicity, age, number of sexual partners, pregnancy, and the pathogens causing bacterial vaginosis. In 2013, researchers found that administration of hydrogen peroxide-producing strains, such as &quot;L. acidophilus&quot; and &quot;L. rhamnosus&quot;, were able to normalize vaginal pH and rebalance the vaginal microbiota, preventing and alleviating bacterial vaginosis.

=== Blood pressure ===
, only limited evidence indicated any direct link between high blood pressure and gut microbiota.

===Cholesterol===
A 2002 meta-analysis that included five double-blind trials examining the short-term (2–8 weeks) effects of a yogurt with probiotic strains on serum cholesterol levels found little effect of 8.5 mg/dL (0.22 mmol/L) (4% decrease) in total cholesterol concentration, and a decrease of 7.7 mg/dL (0.2 mmol/L) (5% decrease) in serum LDL concentration.

=== Depression and anxiety ===
A 2019 meta-analysis found low-quality evidence for probiotics having a small improvement in depression and anxiety. A 2020 review found probiotics might improve depression, but more studies are needed.

=== Diarrhea ===
Some probiotics are suggested as a possible treatment for various forms of gastroenteritis. As a treatment for infectious diarrhea, probiotics are of no benefit to people who have the condition for more than two days, and there is no evidence they lessen the duration of diarrhea overall.

=== Dermatitis ===
Probiotics are commonly given to breastfeeding mothers and their young children to prevent eczema (dermatitis), but no good evidence shows efficacy for this purpose. There is little evidence to support the use of probiotics to treat atopic dermatitis, and some risk of adverse effects. The American Academy of Dermatology stated: &quot;The use of probiotics/prebiotics for the treatment of patients with established atopic dermatitis is not recommended due to inconsistent evidence&quot;.

=== Glycemic control ===
According to an umbrella review of meta-analyses of randomized controlled trials, probiotics supplementation reduces glucose homeostasis. This can be an effective therapy for lowering high blood sugar levels unless the body becomes hypoglycemic; caution and glucose monitoring are necessary to avoid this. 

=== &quot;Helicobacter pylori&quot; ===
Some strains of lactic acid bacteria (LAB) may affect &quot;Helicobacter pylori&quot; infections (which may cause peptic ulcers) in adults when used in combination with standard medical treatments, but no standard in medical practice or regulatory approval exists for such treatment. The only peer-reviewed treatments for &quot;H. pylori&quot; to date all include various Antibiotic Regimens.

=== Immune function and infections ===
Some strains of LAB may affect pathogens by means of competitive inhibition (i.e., by competing for growth) and some evidence suggests they may improve immune function by increasing the number of IgA-producing plasma cells and increasing or improving phagocytosis, as well as increasing the proportion of T lymphocytes and natural killer cells. LAB products might aid in the treatment of acute diarrhea and possibly affect rotavirus infections in children and travelers&#x27; diarrhea in adults, but no products are approved for such indications. There are weak evidence probiotics might lower the incidence of acute upper respiratory tract infections in adults, they were better than placebo or no treatment.

Probiotics do not appear to change the risk of infection in older people.

=== Inflammatory bowel disease ===
The use of oral probiotic supplements to modify the composition and behavior of the microbiome has been considered as a possible therapy for both induction and maintenance of remission in people with Crohn&#x27;s disease and ulcerative colitis. A Cochrane review in 2020 did not find clear evidence of improved remission likelihood, nor lower adverse events, in people with Crohn&#x27;s disease, following probiotic treatment. 

For ulcerative colitis, there is low-certainty evidence that probiotic supplements may increase the probability of clinical remission. People receiving probiotics were 73% more likely to experience disease remission and over 2x as likely to report improvement in symptoms compared to those receiving a placebo, with no clear difference in minor or serious adverse effects. Although there was no clear evidence of greater remission when probiotic supplements were compared with 5‐aminosalicylic acid treatment as a monotherapy, the likelihood of remission was 22% higher if probiotics were used in combination with 5-aminosalicylic acid therapy. Whereas in people who are already in remission, it is unclear whether probiotics help to prevent future relapse, either as a monotherapy or combination therapy. 

=== Irritable bowel syndrome ===
Probiotics are under study for their potential to affect irritable bowel syndrome, although uncertainty remains around which type of probiotic works best, and around the size of possible effect.

=== Necrotizing enterocolitis ===
Several clinical studies provide evidence for the potential of probiotics to lower the risk of necrotizing enterocolitis and mortality in premature infants. One meta-analysis indicated that probiotics reduce these risks by more than 50% compared with controls but that further, large, high-quality trials were needed to inform policy and practice.

===Pregnancy===
A Cochrane systematic review found no good evidence that probiotics were of benefit in reducing the risk of gestational diabetes, but good evidence that they increased the risk of pre-eclampsia. For this reason, the use of probiotics in pregnancy was advised against.

=== Recurrent abdominal pain ===
A 2017 review based on moderate to low-quality evidence suggests that probiotics may be helpful in relieving pain in the short term in children with recurrent abdominal pain, but the proper strain and dosage are not known.

===Dry eye===
A clinical study investigating the impact of probiotics in relieving the signs and symptoms of dry eye revealed promising results for the ophthalmic formulation of Latilactobacillus sakei, while the oral probiotic demonstrated no discernible benefits.

=== Urinary tract ===
There is limited evidence indicating probiotics are of benefit in the management of infection or inflammation of the urinary tract. One literature review found &quot;Lactobacillus&quot; probiotic supplements appeared to increase vaginal lactobacilli levels, thus reducing the incidence of vaginal infections in otherwise healthy adult women.

== General research ==
=== Formulations ===
Supplements such as tablets, capsules, powders, and sachets containing bacteria have been studied. However, probiotics taken orally can be destroyed by the acidic conditions of the stomach. As of 2010, a number of microencapsulation techniques were being developed to address this problem.

=== Multiple probiotics ===
Preliminary research is evaluating the potential physiological effects of multiple probiotic strains, as opposed to a single strain. As the human gut may contain tens of thousands of microbial species, one theory indicates that this diverse environment may benefit from consuming multiple probiotic strains, an effect that remains scientifically unconfirmed.

=== Strains ===
Only preliminary evidence exists for most probiotic health claims. Even for the most studied probiotic strains, few have been sufficiently developed in basic and clinical research to warrant approval for health claim status by a regulatory agency such as the FDA or EFSA, and , no claims had been approved by those two agencies. Some experts are skeptical about the efficacy of different probiotic strains and believe that not all subjects benefit from probiotics.

===Storage temperature===
Multiple studies have shown that there is a significant difference in the survival rate of Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium under refrigerated (4°C) and room temperature (25°C) storage conditions. At room temperature (25±1°C), the number of  probiotics decreased by 5 to 6 logarithmic units (down to 1/100,000) after 90 days of storage. In contrast, no significant change in the number of probiotics was observed under refrigerated conditions (4 ± 1°C).

== Scientific guidelines for testing ==
First, probiotics must be alive when administered. One of the concerns throughout the scientific literature resides in the viability and reproducibility on a large scale of observed results for specific studies, as well as the viability and stability during use and storage, and finally the ability to survive in stomach acids and then in the intestinal ecosystem.

Second, probiotics must have undergone controlled evaluation to document &quot;health benefits&quot; in the target host. Only products that contain live organisms shown in reproducible human studies to confer a health benefit may claim to be probiotic. The correct definition of health benefit, backed with solid scientific evidence, is a strong element for the proper identification and assessment of the effect of a probiotic. This aspect is a challenge for scientific and industrial investigations because several difficulties arise, such as variability in the site for probiotic use (oral, vaginal, intestinal) and mode of application.

Third, the probiotic candidate must be a taxonomically defined microbe or combination of microbes (genus, species, and strain level). It is commonly admitted that most effects of probiotics are strain-specific and cannot be extended to other probiotics of the same genus or species. This calls for precise identification of the strain, i.e. genotypic and phenotypic characterization of the tested microorganism.

Fourth, probiotics must be safe for their intended use. The 2002 FAO/WHO guidelines recommend that, though bacteria may be generally recognized as safe (GRAS), the safety of the potential probiotic be assessed by the &quot;minimum&quot; required tests: 
* Assessment of certain metabolic activities (e.g. D-lactate production, bile salt deconjugation)
* Assessment of side effects in human studies
* Determination of antibiotic resistance patterns
* Epidemiological surveillance of adverse incidents in consumers (aftermarket)
* If the strain under evaluation belongs to a species known to produce toxins in mammals, it must be tested for toxin production. One possible scheme for testing toxin production has been recommended by the EU Scientific Committee on Animal Nutrition.
* If the strain under evaluation belongs to a species with known hemolytic potential, determination of hemolytic activity is required.

In Europe, EFSA adopted a premarket system for the safety assessment of microbial species used in food and feed productions to set priorities for the need for risk assessment. The assessment is made for certain microorganisms; if the result is favorable, it leads to &quot;Qualified Presumption of Safety&quot; status.

<text>Charles Simonyi (; , ; born September 10, 1948) is a Hungarian-American software architect. 

He introduced the graphical user interface to Bill Gates for the first time who later described it as the first of two revolutionary things he felt in his life.

He started and led Microsoft&#x27;s applications group, where he built the first versions of Microsoft Office.

He co-founded and led Intentional Software (acquired by Microsoft in 2017), with the aim of developing and marketing his concept of intentional programming.

In April 2007, aboard Soyuz TMA-10, he became the fifth space tourist and the second Hungarian in space. In March 2009, aboard Soyuz TMA-14, he made a second trip to the International Space Station.

, Simonyi&#x27;s net worth was US$7.5 billion.

==Biography==

===Early life===
Simonyi was born in Budapest, Hungary. His father, Károly Simonyi, was a Kossuth Prize-winning professor of electrical engineering at the Technical University of Budapest, and created the first Hungarian nuclear particle accelerator. While in secondary school he worked part-time as a night watchman at a computer laboratory in the early 1960s, overseeing a large Soviet Ural II mainframe. He took an interest in computing and learned to program from one of the laboratory&#x27;s engineers. By the time he left school, he had learned to develop compilers and sold one of these to a government department. He presented a demonstration of his compiler to the members of a Danish computer trade delegation. In 2006 he said that when he was young his dream was, &quot;to get out of Hungary, go to the West and be free.&quot;

===Career===
At the age of 17, Simonyi left Hungary on a short-term visa but did not return. He was hired by Denmark&#x27;s A/S Regnecentralen in 1966 where he worked with Per Brinch Hansen and Peter Kraft on the RC 4000 minicomputer&#x27;s Real-time Control System, and with Peter Naur on the GIER ALGOL compiler.

He subsequently moved from Denmark to the United States in 1968 to attend the University of California, Berkeley, where he earned his BS in Engineering Mathematics &amp; Statistics in 1972 under Butler Lampson. He has honorary doctorate degrees from the Juilliard School in New York and from the University of Pecs in Hungary.

Simonyi was recruited to Xerox PARC by Butler Lampson during its most productive period, working alongside Lampson, Alan Kay and Robert Metcalfe on the development of the &quot;Xerox Alto&quot;, one of the first personal computers. He and Lampson developed &quot;Bravo&quot;, the first WYSIWYG document preparation program, which became operational in 1974. During this time he received his PhD in computer science from Stanford University in 1977 with a dissertation on a software project management technique he called meta-programming. This approach sought to defeat Brooks&#x27; law by scaling programming through a formalization of communication among programmers. In the 1992 book &quot;Accidental Empires&quot; (), Robert X. Cringely gave this description:

Simonyi&#x27;s dissertation was an attempt to describe a more efficient method of organizing programmers to write software... the metaprogrammer was the designer, decision maker, and communication controller in a software development group... individual programmers were allowed to make no design decisions about the project. All they did was write the code as described by the metaprogrammer... A programmer with a problem or a question would take it to the metaprogrammer, who could come up with an answer or transfer the question to another programmer...

Simonyi remained at PARC until 1981.

In 1997, Simonyi was elected a member of the National Academy of Engineering for developing widely used desktop productivity software. He also became a member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 2008. Since 1998 Simonyi has served as member of the Board of Trustees of the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton and was its Chairman in 2008. Simonyi received the Golden Plate Award of the American Academy of Achievement in 2000.

===Microsoft===
In 1981, at Metcalfe&#x27;s suggestion, he visited Bill Gates at Microsoft who suggested Simonyi start an applications group at Microsoft with the first application being a WYSIWYG word processor. At Microsoft, Simonyi built the organization and applications of what became its most profitable products, Word and Excel, as well as Excel&#x27;s predecessor Multiplan. For the applications, Simonyi pursued a strategy called the &quot;revenue bomb&quot;, whereby the product ran on a virtual machine that was ported to each platform. The resulting applications were highly portable, although Microsoft&#x27;s focus and IBM&#x27;s standardization on MS-DOS eventually made portability less important. 

In a 2002 news item, &quot;The Age&quot; noted that Simonyi introduced the concept of metaprogramming at Microsoft, turning it into what people sometimes referred to as a software factory, but the metaprogramming concept &quot;did not work out in practice.&quot;

Simonyi introduced to Microsoft the techniques of object-oriented programming that he had learned at Xerox. He developed the Hungarian notation convention for naming variables. These standards were originally part of his doctoral thesis. The Hungarian notation has been widely used inside Microsoft.

===Intentional Software===
Simonyi remained at Microsoft during its rapid rise in the software industry, becoming one of its highest-ranking developers. He left Microsoft in 2002 to co-found, with business partner Gregor Kiczales, a company called Intentional Software. This company markets the intentional programming concepts Simonyi developed at Microsoft Research. In this approach to software, a programmer first builds a language environment specific to a given problem domain (such as life insurance). Domain experts, aided by the programmer, then describe the program&#x27;s intended behavior in a What You See Is What You Get (WYSIWYG)-like manner. An automated system uses the program description and the language to generate the final program. Successive changes are only done at the WYSIWYG level.

In 2004, Simonyi received the Wharton Infosys Business Transformation Award for the industry-wide impact of his innovative work in information technology.

On April 18, 2017, Intentional Software was acquired by Microsoft.

===Patents===
Simonyi currently holds 11 patents:

 
 
 


===Philanthropy===
Simonyi has been an active philanthropist.

He has funded the establishment of three professorships:

* In 1995, the Simonyi Professorship of the Public Understanding of Science at Oxford University, first held by Richard Dawkins (1995-2008), currently by Marcus du Sautoy
* A Simonyi Professorship for Innovation in Teaching endowed chair at Stanford University, held by Eric S. Roberts 1997-2002
* In 2005, as part of $25 million donation, a Simonyi Professorship of Mathematical Physics at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, New Jersey, held by Edward Witten 2005–present.

In 2003 he founded the Charles and Lisa Simonyi Fund for Arts and Sciences, a nonprofit organization based in Seattle. The foundation provides grants to outstanding organization in art, sciences and education. Grant recipients have included the Seattle Symphony ($10 million), and the Seattle Public Library ($3 million), the Metropolitan Opera, the Juilliard School and the Vera C. Rubin Observatory, which will host the Simonyi Survey Telescope. The $100 million foundation closed in 2013.

In February 2017, Simonyi and his wife Lisa gave the University of Washington Computer Science and Engineering (CSE) department $5 million towards the completion of a new building.

===Political activity===
Simonyi was one of few notable early supporters of Donald Trump&#x27;s 2016 presidential campaign when he made the maximum primary donation of $2,700 in 2015. Simonyi went on to contribute $200,000 to Donald Trump&#x27;s 2020 presidential campaign.

OpenSecrets shows Simonyi has contributed to numerous Republican candidates, the Republican National Committee, and several state Republican committees. 

==Personal life==
Simonyi dated Martha Stewart for 15 years until 2008.

Simonyi is married to Lisa Persdotter, the daughter of a Swedish millionaire. She is 32 years his junior. They were married on November 22, 2008 in a private ceremony in Gothenburg, Sweden, attended by their closest friends, among them Bill Gates. The couple went on to have two daughters. 

Simonyi became a United States citizen in 1982.

Simonyi formerly spent six months per year on his custom-built long super yacht named &quot;Skat&quot;. The yacht was sold in 2021. As of 2023 he is instead the owner a yacht named NORN which is 295-foot long (90 m). The yacht was designed by Espen Oeino, and is registered in the Cayman Islands.

His residence in Medina, Washington, &quot;Villa Simonyi&quot;, is a modern house designed by architect Wendell Lovett, where Simonyi displays his collection of paintings by Roy Lichtenstein and Victor Vasarely.

==Spaceflights==
In early 2006, Simonyi expressed interest in becoming a space tourist and signed agreements with the space tourism company, Space Adventures, Ltd., for a ten-day mission to the International Space Station (ISS).

In August 2006, he passed a pre-qualification medical exam by the Russian Federal Space Agency, called the State Medical Commission (GMK). He started training at Star City in September 2006.

He launched on April 7, 2007 (GMT), on board Soyuz TMA-10. He shared a ride with two Russian cosmonauts to the International Space Station, and returned aboard Soyuz TMA-9, landing on April 21, 2007.

Upon arrival to the ISS on April 9, 2007, Simonyi said, &quot;It is amazing how it appears from the blackness of the sky. It was very, very dramatic. It was like a big stage set, a fantastic production of some incredible opera or modern play. That&#x27;s what I was referring to when I said I was blown away.&quot;

Simonyi&#x27;s expected return on April 20, 2007, was delayed by one day due to &#x27;boggy ground&#x27;. He returned to Earth on April 21, 2007 along with an American astronaut and a Russian cosmonaut.

In October 2008, he booked for a second trip to the ISS through Space Adventures on board Soyuz TMA-14. On March 26, 2009 he returned to space aboard Soyuz TMA-14. He returned to Earth on board Soyuz TMA-13. Along with Soyuz Commander Yuri Lonchakov and Michael Fincke, Simonyi landed in Kazakhstan on April 8, 2009.

Simonyi became the second Hungarian astronaut, the fifth space tourist, and the only one in history who went twice to space as a space tourist who paid his own way on spaceflights. Earlier, the Hungarians were the seventh nation to be represented in space, in 1980, by Bertalan Farkas&#x27;s spaceflight, 27 years before Simonyi&#x27;s first one, in 2007. The next Hungarian astronaut will follow Simonyi to the International Space Station by 2025.

===Radio communication while aboard ISS===
Charles Simonyi is a licensed amateur radio operator with the call sign KE7KDP, and planned to contact a number of schools while on his flight on the International Space Station using amateur radio for the communication with those schools. On April 11, 2007 the American Radio Relay League reported that Simonyi was already making ham radio contacts from space.

One of the schools Simonyi contacted was Cedar Point Elementary in Bristow, Virginia. A telebridge conversation was held on Tuesday, April 17, 2007. On board with him were Oleg Kotov and Fyodor Yurchikhin. On March 30, 2009 he held a phone conversation with students at the Girls&#x27; Middle School in Mountain View, California, United States in which he said that one of the most surprising things about traveling to space was that upon returning to Earth the air feels very thick, very heavy, like &quot;breathing Pepto-Bismol.&quot; He also stated that talking with the students from the school &quot;made his day.&quot;

Simonyi used his Hungarian call sign HA5SIK when he contacted 25 radio amateurs from Hungary in a record attempt on April 12. He contacted former and current students of Tivadar Puskás Polytechnic, Budapest on April 13.

Simonyi supports The Museum of Flight in Seattle, funding the Space Gallery housing the NASA Shuttle Trainer and many space artifacts.

==In popular culture==
Simonyi was portrayed by actor Brian Lester in the TV film &quot;Pirates of Silicon Valley&quot;.

<doc id="731746" wikidata="Q421709" url="?curid=731746" title="Nandrolone">
<text>Nandrolone, also known as 19-nortestosterone, is an endogenous androgen. It is also an anabolic steroid (AAS) which is medically used in the form of esters such as nandrolone decanoate (brand name Deca-Durabolin) and nandrolone phenylpropionate (brand name Durabolin). Nandrolone esters are used in the treatment of anemias, cachexia (muscle wasting syndrome), osteoporosis, breast cancer, and for other indications. They are now used by oral administration or instead are given by injection into muscle or fat.
Side effects of nandrolone esters include symptoms of masculinization like acne, increased hair growth, and voice changes. They are synthetic androgens and anabolic steroids and hence are agonists of the androgen receptor (AR), the biological target of androgens like testosterone and dihydrotestosterone (DHT). Nandrolone has strong anabolic effects and weak androgenic effects, which give them a mild side effect profile and make them especially suitable for use in women and children. There are metabolites of Nandrolone that act as long-lasting prodrugs in the body, such as 5α-Dihydronandrolone.
Nandrolone esters were first described and introduced for medical use in the late 1950s. They are among the most widely used anabolic steroid worldwide. In addition to their medical use, nandrolone esters are used to improve physique and performance, and are said to be the most widely used anabolic steroid for such purposes. The drugs are controlled substances in many countries and so non-medical use is generally illicit.

==Medical uses==
Nandrolone esters are used clinically, although increasingly rarely, for people in catabolic states with major burns, cancer, and AIDS, and an ophthalmological formulation was available to support cornea healing.

The positive effects of nandrolone esters include muscle growth, appetite stimulation and increased red blood cell production, and bone density. Clinical studies have shown them to be effective in treating anemia, osteoporosis, and breast cancer.

Nandrolone sulfate has been used in an eye drop formulation as an ophthalmic medication.

==Non-medical uses==
Nandrolone esters are used for physique- and performance-enhancing purposes by competitive athletes, bodybuilders, and powerlifters.

==Side effects==
Side effects of nandrolone esters include masculinization among others. In women, nandrolone and nandrolone esters have been reported to produce increased libido, acne, facial and body hair growth, voice changes, and clitoral enlargement. However, the masculinizing effects of nandrolone and its esters are reported to be slighter than those of testosterone. Nandrolone has also been found to produce penile growth in prepubertal boys. Amenorrhea and menorrhagia have been reported as side effects of nandrolone cypionate.

Nandrolone theoretically may produce erectile dysfunction as a side effect, although there is no clinical evidence to support this notion at present. Side effects of high doses of nandrolone may include cardiovascular toxicity as well as hypogonadism and infertility. Nandrolone may not produce scalp hair loss, although this is also theoretical.

==Pharmacology==

===Pharmacodynamics===
Nandrolone is an agonist of the AR, the biological target of androgens like testosterone and . Unlike testosterone and certain other anabolic steroids, nandrolone is not potentiated in androgenic tissues like the scalp, skin, and prostate, hence deleterious effects in these tissues are lessened. This is because nandrolone is metabolized by 5α-reductase to the much weaker AR ligand 5α-dihydronandrolone (DHN), which has both reduced affinity for the androgen receptor (AR) relative to nandrolone &quot;in vitro&quot; and weaker AR agonistic potency &quot;in vivo&quot;. The lack of alkylation on the 17α-carbon drastically reduces the hepatotoxic potential of nandrolone. Estrogen effects resulting from reaction with aromatase are also reduced due to lessened enzyme interaction, but effects such as gynecomastia and reduced libido may still occur at sufficiently high doses.

In addition to its AR agonistic activity, unlike many other anabolic steroids, nandrolone is also a potent progestogen. It binds to the progesterone receptor with approximately 22% of the affinity of progesterone. The progestogenic activity of nandrolone serves to augment its antigonadotropic effects, as antigonadotropic action is a known property of progestogens.

====Anabolic and androgenic activity====
Nandrolone has a very high ratio of anabolic to androgenic activity. In fact, many nandrolone-like anabolic steroids and even nandrolone itself are said to have among the highest ratio of anabolic to androgenic effect of all anabolic steroids. This is attributed to the fact that whereas testosterone is potentiated via conversion into dihydrotestosterone (DHT) in androgenic tissues, the opposite is true with nandrolone and similar anabolic steroids (i.e., other 19-nortestosterone derivatives). As such, nandrolone-like anabolic steroids, namely nandrolone esters, are the most frequently used anabolic steroids in clinical settings in which anabolic effects are desired; for instance, in the treatment of AIDS-associated cachexia, severe burns, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. However, anabolic steroids with a very high ratio of anabolic to androgenic action like nandrolone still have significant androgenic effects and can produce symptoms of masculinization like hirsutism and voice deepening in women and children with extended use.

===Pharmacokinetics===
The oral activity of nandrolone has been studied. With oral administration of nandrolone in rodents, it had about one-tenth of the potency of subcutaneous injection of nandrolone.

Nandrolone has very low affinity for human serum sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG), about 5% of that of testosterone and 1% of that of DHT. It is metabolized by the enzyme 5α-reductase, among others. Nandrolone is less susceptible to metabolism by 5α-reductase and 17β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase than testosterone. This results in it being transformed less in so-called &quot;androgenic&quot; tissues like the skin, hair follicles, and prostate gland and in the kidneys, respectively. Metabolites of nandrolone include 5α-dihydronandrolone, 19-norandrosterone, and 19-noretiocholanolone, and these metabolites may be detected in urine.

Single intramuscular injections of 100 mg nandrolone phenylpropionate or nandrolone decanoate have been found to produce an anabolic effect for 10 to 14 days and 20 to 25 days, respectively. Conversely, unesterified nandrolone has been used by intramuscular injection once daily.

==Chemistry==

Nandrolone, also known as 19-nortestosterone (19-NT) or as estrenolone, as well as estra-4-en-17β-ol-3-one or 19-norandrost-4-en-17β-ol-3-one, is a naturally occurring estrane (19-norandrostane) steroid and a derivative of testosterone (androst-4-en-17β-ol-3-one). It is specifically the C19 demethylated (nor) analogue of testosterone. Nandrolone is an endogenous intermediate in the production of estradiol from testosterone via aromatase in mammals including humans and is present in the body naturally in trace amounts. It can be detected during pregnancy in women. Nandrolone esters have an ester such as decanoate or phenylpropionate attached at the C17β position.

===Derivatives===

====Esters====
A variety of esters of nandrolone have been marketed and used medically. The most commonly used esters are nandrolone decanoate and to a lesser extent nandrolone phenylpropionate. Examples of other nandrolone esters that have been marketed and used medically include nandrolone cyclohexylpropionate, nandrolone cypionate, nandrolone hexyloxyphenylpropionate, nandrolone laurate, nandrolone sulfate, and nandrolone undecanoate.

====Anabolic steroids====
Nandrolone is the parent compound of a large group of anabolic steroids. Notable examples include the non-17α-alkylated trenbolone and the 17α-alkylated ethylestrenol (ethylnandrol) and metribolone (R-1881), as well as the 17α-alkylated designer steroids norboletone and tetrahydrogestrinone (THG).

Nandrolone, together with ethisterone (17α-ethynyltestosterone), is also the parent compound of a large group of progestins, the norethisterone (17α-ethynyl-19-nortestosterone) derivatives. This family is subdivided into two groups: the estranes and the gonanes. The estranes include norethisterone (norethindrone), norethisterone acetate, norethisterone enanthate, lynestrenol, etynodiol diacetate, and noretynodrel, while the gonanes include norgestrel, levonorgestrel, desogestrel, etonogestrel, gestodene, norgestimate, dienogest (actually a 17α-cyanomethyl-19-nortestosterone derivative), and norelgestromin.

===Synthesis===
The elaboration of a method for the reduction of aromatic rings to the corresponding dihydrobenzenes under controlled conditions by A. J. Birch opened a convenient route to compounds related to the putative 19-norprogesterone.

This reaction, now known as the Birch reduction, is typified by the treatment of the monomethyl ether of estradiol (1) with a solution of lithium metal in liquid ammonia in the presence of alcohol as a proton source. Initial reaction constituents of 1,4-dimetalation of the most electron deficient positions of the aromatic ring–in the case of an estrogen, the 1 and 4-positions. Rxn of the intermediate with the proton source leads to a dihydrobenzene; a special virtue of this sequence in steroids is the fact that the double bind at 2 is in effect becomes an enol ether moiety. Treatment of this product (2) with weak acid, oxalic acid for e.g., leads to the hydrolysis of the enol ether, producing β,γ-unconjugated ketone 3. Hydrolysis under more strenuous conditions (mineral acids) results in migration/conjugation of the olefin to yield nandrolone (4).

====Esters====
* Treatment of 4 with decanoic anhydride and pyridine affords &quot;nandrolone decanoate&quot;.
* Acylation of 4 with phenylpropionyl chloride yields &quot;nandrolone phenpropionate&quot;.

===Detection in body fluids===
Nandrolone use is directly detectable in hair or indirectly detectable in urine by testing for the presence of 19-norandrosterone, a metabolite. The International Olympic Committee has set a limit of 2.0 μg/L of 19-norandrosterone in urine as the upper limit, beyond which an athlete is suspected of doping. In the largest nandrolone study performed on 621 athletes at the 1998 Nagano Olympic Games, no athlete tested over 0.4 μg/L. 19-Norandrosterone was identified as a trace contaminant in commercial preparations of androstenedione, which until 2004 was available without a prescription as a dietary supplement in the U.S.

A number of nandrolone cases in athletics occurred in 1999, which included high-profile athletes such as Merlene Ottey, Dieter Baumann, and Linford Christie. However, the following year the detection method for nandrolone at the time was proved to be faulty. Mark Richardson, a British Olympic relay runner who tested positive for the substance, gave a significant amount of urine samples in a controlled environment and delivered a positive test for the drug, demonstrating that false positives could occur, which led to an overhaul of his competitive ban.

Heavy consumption of the essential amino acid lysine (as indicated in the treatment of cold sores) has allegedly shown false positives in some and was cited by American shotputter C. J. Hunter as the reason for his positive test, though in 2004 he admitted to a federal grand jury that he had injected nandrolone. A possible cause of incorrect urine test results is the presence of metabolites from other anabolic steroids, though modern urinalysis can usually determine the exact anabolic steroid used by analyzing the ratio of the two remaining nandrolone metabolites. As a result of the numerous overturned verdicts, the testing procedure was reviewed by UK Sport. In October 2007, three-time Olympic gold medalist for track and field Marion Jones admitted to use of the drug, and was sentenced to six months in jail for lying to a federal grand jury in 2000.

Mass spectrometry is also used to detect small amounts of nandrolone in urine samples.

==History==
Nandrolone was first synthesized in 1950. It was first introduced, as nandrolone phenylpropionate, in 1959, and then as nandrolone decanoate in 1962, followed by additional esters.

==Society and culture==

===Generic names===
Nandrolone is the generic name of the drug and its , , , and . The formal generic names of nandrolone esters include nandrolone cyclohexylpropionate (), nandrolone cyclotate (), nandrolone decanoate (, , , ), nandrolone laurate (), nandrolone phenpropionate (), and nandrolone phenylpropionate (, ).

===Doping in sports===
Nandrolone was probably among the first anabolic steroids to be used as a doping agent in sports in the 1960s. It has been banned at the Olympics since 1974. There are many known cases of doping in sports with nandrolone esters by professional athletes.

==Research==
Nandrolone esters have been studied in several indications. They were intensively studied for osteoporosis, and increased calcium uptake and decreased bone loss, but caused virilization in about half of the women who took them and were mostly abandoned for this use when better drugs like the bisphosphonates became available. They have also been studied in clinical trials for chronic kidney failure, aplastic anemia, and as male contraceptives.

<doc id="731747" wikidata="Q6291942" url="?curid=731747" title="Mawdryn Undead">
<text>Mawdryn Undead is the third serial of the 20th season of the British science fiction television series &quot;Doctor Who&quot;. It was originally broadcast in four twice weekly parts on BBC1 from 1 to 9 February 1983.

The serial is set in an English boarding school and a spaceship above the Earth in 1977 and 1983. In the serial, the scientist Mawdryn (David Collings), whose people on board the ship have been afflicted by a mutation that constantly causes their bodies to renew themselves, seeks to die using the regenerative abilities of the alien time traveller the Fifth Doctor (Peter Davison) to stop this process and allow them to die.

&quot;Mawdryn Undead&quot; is the first of three loosely connected serials in which the Black Guardian (Valentine Dyall) attempts to compel the alien Vislor Turlough (Mark Strickson) to kill the Doctor, and it introduces Turlough as a regular character. Nicholas Courtney is reintroduced as Brigadier Lethbridge-Stewart, who was last seen in the series in the 1975 serial &quot;Terror of the Zygons&quot;.

==Plot==
In 1983, Vislor Turlough, a stranded alien posing as a human student, is given an offer by the Black Guardian for passage off Earth if he should kill the Fifth Doctor.

Meanwhile, the Doctor, Tegan and Nyssa find the TARDIS stuck in the warp ellipse of a starliner trapped in time. Materialising aboard, they find a transmat device with separate endpoints to Earth in 1977 and 1983 is creating the interference. Turlough arrives from the 1983 transmat, feigning lack of comprehension of the situation. The Doctor instructs Nyssa and Tegan to stay aboard the TARDIS while he returns with Turlough to 1983 to fix that transmat point, hoping it will allow the TARDIS to escape. Instead, the TARDIS materialises in 1977 at Turlough&#x27;s school. Coincidentally the Doctor&#x27;s old friend from UNIT, retired Brigadier Lethbridge-Stewart, is now a maths teacher at the school and is surprised to learn some trauma in the past has made him lose the memories of the last few years; as a result, he does not remember the Doctor at all. However, as the Doctor talks about Tegan, about himself and his former companions, the Brigadier starts regaining some memories.

In 1977, Nyssa and Tegan leave the TARDIS and find a horribly disfigured man in the transmat capsule, who claims to be the Doctor in the midst of a regeneration. They seek out help from the younger Brigadier, and the &quot;Doctor&quot; urges all three to return with him to the starliner via the TARDIS. In 1983, the Doctor detects the TARDIS&#x27; movement, and he, Turlough, and the older Brigadier also return to the starliner via the transmat. The Doctor regroups with his companions; realising two versions of the Brigadier are aboard, he instructs them all to keep the two separated, as, should they touch, it could release a potentially catastrophic energy discharge due to the Blinovitch limitation effect.

The figure posing as the Doctor is forced to reveal himself as Mawdryn, one of several scientists aboard the liner who were trying to discover the Time Lord secret of regeneration. Their experiments failed, and he and his fellow scientists have become immortal in this painful state and seek to die, but the Doctor determines the only way to do so is to give up his remaining regenerations. He attempts to leave with his companions, but finds that Nyssa and Tegan suffer the same affliction as Mawdryn, ageing and de-ageing rapidly once in the Time Vortex, and quickly returns to the ship. The Doctor agrees to give up his regenerations and prepares to transfer this energy, with the Brigadier at the machine controls. Meanwhile, the Brigadier from 1977, having been left alone, bursts in upon them. The two Brigadiers reach out to touch, and the flash of energy occurs just at the right moment before the Doctor gives up his regenerations, ending Mawdryn&#x27;s and his colleagues&#x27; lives as requested, restoring Nyssa and Tegan, and saving the Doctor. The younger Brigadier passes out from shock, and the Doctor suspects this was the trauma that caused him to lose his memory. The TARDIS crew return the Brigadiers to their proper times, and the Doctor accepts Turlough&#x27;s request to join his crew, unaware of the Black Guardian&#x27;s influence.

==Production==

&quot;Mawdryn Undead&quot; was a replacement for an earlier script, &quot;The Song of the Space Whale&quot;, by Pat Mills. That script fell through when Mills and script editor Eric Saward could not agree on certain elements of the story. Instead, Peter Grimwade quickly produced &quot;Mawdryn Undead&quot; to fill the gap in the production schedule. &quot;The Song of the Space Whale&quot; was later renamed &quot;The Song of Megaptera&quot; and made into an audio drama by Big Finish Productions for their &quot;Doctor Who&quot; &quot;The Lost Stories&quot; range.

===Cast notes===
The original intent of the production team was for the character of Ian Chesterton, one of the original regulars from the series&#x27; first two seasons from 1963 to 1965, to return for a guest appearance in this story; hence the school setting, as Chesterton was a science teacher, and the Brigadier&#x27;s being issued with another TARDIS homing device. However, actor William Russell proved to be unavailable. Some consideration was given to using instead the character of Harry Sullivan, who was a regular in the programme for a season in the mid-1970s, before the return of Lethbridge-Stewart was eventually decided upon.

David Collings, who played Mawdryn, also appeared in the Fourth Doctor serials &quot;Revenge of the Cybermen&quot; (1975) as Vorus and &quot;The Robots of Death&quot; (1977) as Poul, and would himself play an alternate Doctor in Big Finish Productions&#x27; &quot;Doctor Who Unbound&quot; audio play, &quot;Full Fathom Five&quot;. Angus MacKay previously played Borusa in &quot;The Deadly Assassin&quot; (1976). John Nathan-Turner felt that Mark Strickson&#x27;s blond hair didn&#x27;t stand out well enough from Peter Davison&#x27;s blond hair. He initially asked Strickson to shave his head, but when Strickson declined, Turner decided that Strickson&#x27;s hair should be dyed red.

<text>CFM International is a Franco-American aircraft engine manufacturer. The company is a joint venture between GE Aerospace and Safran Aircraft Engines (formerly known as Snecma) and is headquartered in Cincinnati, Ohio. It was founded in 1974 to build and support the CFM56 series of turbofan engines. CFM is the world&#x27;s largest commercial aircraft engine manufacturer, with a 39% market share . It has delivered more than 37,500 of its engines to more than 570 operators. The name &quot;CFM&quot; is derived from the two parent companies&#x27; commercial engine designations: GE&#x27;s CF series and Snecma&#x27;s M series.

== History ==

While General Electric&#x27;s military engine business for fighter jets was undeniably booming, the American company&#x27;s ambitions were struggling to materialise in the civil sector. It was not until the late 1950s that GE made its first foray into this market.

On the other side, Snecma has been thinking since the mid-1960s about the best strategy for approaching the civil market with a new engine offering major performance gains in terms of fuel consumption and noise reduction, characteristics increasingly sought after by aircraft manufacturers and airlines.

In 1969, General Electric and Snecma began working together for the first time. Together with the German company MTU (Motoren-und-Turbinen-Union), the two companies produced parts for the CF6-50 engine powering the Airbus A300.

At the same time, and since the mid-1960s, Snecma began conducting a series of thermodynamic, aerodynamic and acoustic studies to establish the main characteristics of the M56 engine. Several objectives were set: low noise level, minimal fuel consumption, reduced maintenance and overall operating costs.

At the same time, the French government drew up its sixth five-year plan, defining the country&#x27;s economic and industrial objectives for the period 1971-1975. The objectives of the French Aerospace Industry Committee converged with those of Snecma. The company and the government were well aware that the successful development of a 10-ton civil jet engine required international cooperation, for three main reasons. First, although Snecma was capable of developing advanced technologies, it lacked experience, particularly in the development of high-pressure turbines. It didn’t master the technology of variable stators, nor that of small fixed and mobile blades, required for the final high-load stages of the high-pressure compressor. Secondly, domestic sources of supply for high-temperature alloys and foundry and machining technologies for cooled high-pressure turbine blades were limited. Finally, as a specialist in military aircraft, Snecma had neither the sales organization nor the international presence needed to compete in the civil sector.

In 1971, Snecma was looking for a partner to develop, manufacture and sell the future CFM56 engine. The difficulties encountered by the Pratt &amp; Whitney and Rolls Royce development programs quickly left General Electric as the only viable partner. A delegation comprising Snecma Chairman Jacques-Edouard Lamy, Sales Director Jean Crépin and Technical Director Michel Garnier travelled to Lynn, Massachusetts, in April 1970 to meet GE representatives. Gerhard Neumann (head of GE&#x27;s Aircraft Engine Business Group) understood the scope of this new strategic opportunity in Europe and agreed to a 50/50 partnership.Safran Group

== Creating CFM International ==
On January 24, 1974, as part of the development of the CFM56, Snecma and General Electric signed the final agreement governing the proposed joint venture. Although the company was already up and running, a number of legal and administrative formalities delayed its legal incorporation until September 1974. Named CFM International, this company under French law, with capital of 400,000 francs, created in equal shares by Snecma and General Electric, was responsible for managing the program and marketing the engines.

CFM&#x27;s first CEO, Jean Sollier, chaired a ten-member board of directors, five from GE and five from Snecma, including two vice-presidents, Neumann and Ravaud. The two companies share design, development and production equally. Final assembly, sales and services are handled by each partner using its own resources.

The logo concept proposed by Jean Sollier, a mix of Snecma&#x27;s red rectangle and GE&#x27;s blue circle, and the engine name, which combines GE&#x27;s civil engine nomenclature (CF for Commercial Fan) and Snecma&#x27;s project name (M56), clearly illustrate the two companies&#x27; desire to work together.

== Initial trials and certification ==
On June 20, 1974, the demonstration engine for the CFM56 program ran for the first time at Evendale on a test bench belonging to General Electric. In the days that followed, and in less than ten hours of operation, it reached its full take-off thrust of 10 tonnes. In November of the same year, the CFM56 carried out its first trial on a test bench at Villaroche.

Boeing was one of the first aircraft manufacturers to realise the full potential of the CFM56 engine. Boeing president Thornton Wilson contacted Neumann and Ravaud in 1977 with a proposal for an agreement to replace the engines of the 707 using the CFM56.

On March 17, 1977, flight testing of the CFM56 began on the Caravelle flying testbench. The first flight took place at Mérignac, near Bordeaux. It lasted just over three hours and was designed to assess the performance of the engine and nacelle. In January 1979, ground and flight tests reached a total of more than 4,000 hours.

Five years after the creation of the company, and eight years after the start of the project, any contract had yet to be signed by aircraft manufacturers. The French government threatened to put the programme on hold if no commercial application was found before spring 1979. In the United States, United Airlines finally decided in March 1979 to choose the CFM56 to replace the engines of the DC-8 cargo aircraft.

On November 8, 1979, the CFM56 was certified for a nominal thrust of 24,000 lb simultaneously by the DGAC (Direction Générale de l&#x27;Aviation Civile) in France and the FAA (Federal Aviation Administration) in the United States. For the first time an engine has been certified jointly by the US agency and a European national agency. The CFM56 can now power commercial transport aircraft.

The CFM56 made its first commercial flight in April 1982 on a DC-8 Super 70 for Delta Airlines, on a route between Atlanta and Savannah, Georgia. In February 1987, Snecma achieved its initial goal of becoming a benchmark engine manufacturer for the new European twinjet, with the maiden flight of the CFM56-5-powered A320. In 1991, the 5,000th CFM56 was delivered to Airbus Industrie. The 10,000th CFM56 was delivered at the 1999 Paris Air Show.

== Engines ==
* CFM International CFM56
* CFM International LEAP
* CFM International RISE (in development)

== Production ==
In 2016 CFM delivered 1,665 CFM56 and 77 LEAP, and booked 2,677 orders : 876 CFM56 and 1,801 LEAP for US$36 billion at list price. The LEAP engine backlog exceeded 12,200 which was valued at more than US$170 billion at list price.

In 2017, CFM delivered 1,900 engines including 459 LEAPs, of which it plans to deliver 1,200 in 2018, 1,800 in 2019 and more than 2,000 in 2020.
In 2019, CFM deliveries stood at 2,127 : 1,736 Leaps and 391 CFM56s (-63%), and plans to produce 1,400 engines in 2020.

Due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on aviation, deliveries of LEAP engines across the first nine months of 2020 fell to 622 from 1,316 in the same period in 2019, and 123 CFM56 against 327, while LEAP fleet cycles were down 15% year-on-year and CFM cycles were 48% lower.

CFM announced the RISE project in June 2021, with plans to enter service in the mid 2030s.

== The future of CFM ==

In the early 2000s, CFM launched a new cutting-edge technology programme: LEAP (Leading Edge Aviation Propulsion). The first LEAP began ground testing at GE&#x27;s Peebles (Ohio) facility in September 2013, then at Snecma’s plant in Villaroche the following year. The LEAP-1C is the first of the family to begin flight testing on a modified GE Boeing 747-100.

In 2021, the CFM International partnership has been renewed until 2050 and extended to include services.

<text>Kambar, or Kavichakravarthy Kamban (1180 CE–1250 CE), was an Indian poet and the author of the Ramavataram, popularly known as &quot;Kambaramayanam&quot;, the Tamil version of the epic Ramayana. Kambar also authored other literary works in Tamil, such as Tirukkai Valakkam, &quot;Erelupatu&quot;, Silai Elupatu, &quot;Kangai Puranam&quot;, &quot;Sadagopar Antati&quot; and &quot;Saraswati Antati&quot;.

==Life==

Kambar was born in Therazhundur. His father was a wealthy farmer named Sadaiyepa Vallal. He grew up in the Chola Empire under the reign of Kulothunga III. Having heard of this talented bard, Kulothunga summoned him to his court and honoured him with the title &quot;Kavi Chakravarty&quot; (&quot;The Emperor of Poets&quot;).

Kambar flourished in Therazhundur, a village in the culturally rich Mayiladuthurai district in the modern state of Tamil Nadu in South India.

Kambar is generally dated after the Vaishnavite philosopher, Ramanuja, as the poet refers to the latter in his work, the Sadagopar Antati.

Kamban was a great scholar of both Tamil and Sanskrit—two of India&#x27;s oldest and richest languages in terms of literary works. In a scholarly biography, &quot;Kavichakravarty Kamban&quot;, Mahavidwan R. Raghava Iyengar wrote in detail about Kambar.

Kambar spent his last days in Nattarasankottai (known for Kannathal temple) near to Sivagangai town and his tomb is situated there. It is said that Kambar after having differences with Kulothunga&#x27;s son, Rajaraja III, he left the Chola kingdom and moved from place to place. When he reached at Nattarasankottai, he was very thirsty and asked water in one house at Nattarasankottai. He was offered buttermilk in return and he became very happy and decided to stay there itself and spent his last days there. He lived there till his death. There is tomb in Nattarasankottai and every year a celebration called &quot;Kamban vizha&quot; is conducted at this place to felicitate Kambar.

==Literary works==

* Kamba Ramayanam (also called &quot;Ramavataram&quot;) - Retelling of the Indian epic Ramayana in Tamil. Work covers 11,000 stanzas. 
* Saraswati Antati - Literary work of style Antati in praise of Hindu Goddess Saraswati
* Sadagopar Antati - Literary work of style Antati in praise of Vaishnava Saint Nammalvar
* Silai Elupatu - Work in praise of 11th century Pallava king Karunakara Tondaiman 
* Tirukkai Valakkam
* Erelupathu
* Kangai Puranam

==Kamba Ramayanam==

The original version of &quot;Ramayana&quot; was written by Valmiki. It is an epic of 24,000 verses which depicts the journey of Rama, a prince of Ayodhya who belonged to Raghuvamsha (Solar dynasty). In Hinduism, Rama is the seventh incarnation of Vishnu, one of the Trimurti (the Hindu holy trinity which includes Brahma and Shiva).

The &quot;Ramavataram&quot; or &quot;Kamba Ramayanam&quot; of Kamban is an epic of about 11,000 stanzas. The &quot;Rama-avataram&quot; or &quot;Rama-kathai&quot; as it was originally called was accepted into the holy precincts in the presence of Vaishnava Acharya Nathamuni.

&quot;Kamba Ramayana&quot; is not a verbal translation of the Sanskrit epic by Valmiki, but a retelling of the story of Rama.

== In popular culture ==
He is portrayed by Serukalathur Sama in the Tamil-language film &quot;Ambikapathy&quot; (1937).

Yet another film, also titled &quot;Ambikapathy&quot; (1957) has M. K. Radha playing Kambar.

<doc id="731768" wikidata="Q31046554" url="?curid=731768" title="Presley">
<text>Presley is a surname and given name.

==Etymology==
The name &quot;Presley&quot; is derived from the Old English &quot;preost&quot;, meaning &quot;priest&quot;, and &quot;leah&quot; meaning &quot;forest clearing&quot;.

==History==
Most instances of the surname &quot;Presley&quot; and variants &quot;Pressley&quot; and &quot;Pressly&quot; are thought to be of English origin. Later, if not found in some form originating also in Scotland, the name made its way across the border to that country, then on to Ireland and to the United States. However, some of the instances of the name in America may derive from the German surname Preslar (ultimately from Bressler, meaning &#x27;from Breslau&#x27; (formerly in Germany, now in Poland)), as individuals in some post-colonial American records are recorded under both names.

The surname came to prominence in the person of Elvis Presley (known simply as Elvis), the American music icon, whose family, according to genealogists, has come from the German town of Neuhochstadt in Palatinate, via a certain Johannes Valentin Preslar that emigrated with his sons to North Carolina in the early 1700s.

In the United States and Australia, however, Presley is often an Anglicized form of German surnames such as Preslar and Presler. This is thought to be a habitational name from Breslau, Poland. Former President Jimmy Carter, through his mother, is thought to descend from Johann Valentin Preslar/Presler, who along with his family reached America and later the then frontier area of the central Carolinas sometime during the mid-18th century. Elvis Presley may have had the same ancestor.

Today, Presley ranks as the 1,825 most common surname in the United States.

<doc id="731770" wikidata="Q5593099" url="?curid=731770" title="Graham Nicholls">
<text>Graham Nicholls (born 30 July 1975) is a British author, installation artist and specialist on out of body experiences. He speaks widely on parapsychology, ethics and art at institutions ranging from the London Science Museum, The Society for Psychical Research to the Cambridge Union Society.

==Early life==
Graham Nicholls was born in the Paddington district of central London into a working-class family. He states that during his early life he was surrounded by crime and social problems, but that the influence of literature, art, science and spiritual philosophies helped him to look beyond the limitations of this environment.

==Art career==
Since the early 1990s Nicholls has developed artistic works that explore subjects such as sensory deprivation, hypnosis, and psi abilities. Nicholls had his first solo show at a gallery run by James Fuentes in New York City in July 1999 and in 2004 developed many of his psychological ideas into an interactive virtual reality installation called The Living Image. The installation was a collaboration between Graham Nicholls, 3D designer Roma Patel, and site-specific artist Trudi Entwistle at London&#x27;s Science Museum, much of which was based upon Nicholls&#x27;s life and locations from his childhood. The project was the subject of an academic study into the impact of virtual reality and installation art, the details of which were later published in two books dealing with scenography and performance. Technology and science, such as that used in The Living Image project, take a central role in his artistic output, his virtual web projects being considered internationally recognised by the &quot;Handbook of the economics of art and culture&quot;.

==Out-of-body experiences==
Nicholls claims to have had out of body experiences (OBEs) since the age of approximately twelve years old. These experiences led him to study many aspects of parapsychology. In 2009 Nicholls outlined his experiences and ideas relating to OBEs in an article that appeared in Kindred Spirit magazine. In the article he makes it clear that he believes mainstream science will eventually fully embrace psi, or psychical perceptions as natural, rather than supernatural or paranormal.

As part of his inquiry into psi and human consciousness, in 2009 he began working on a series of telepathy experiments in a joint project with controversial scientist Rupert Sheldrake. The resulting data formed part of Rupert Sheldrake&#x27;s research as director of the Perrott-Warrick project, administered by Trinity College, Cambridge.

===Veridical cases===

Nicholls also claims to have had several veridical out-of-body experiences. In his books, articles and in recent videos published he gives examples of his out-of-body experiences that have been witnessed and confirmed by others. The videos feature the witnesses describing what they saw and recorded in notes at the time of the OBEs supporting Nicholls version of events. He also outlines an example of a claimed objective OBE in his October 2011 article for the journal of The Institute of Noetic Sciences. Skeptics would generally dispute such claims as unreliable and impossible by current understandings of science.

===Skepticism===

In the October 2012 issue of The Psychologist, the journal of the British Psychological Society, a review of Navigating the Out-of-Body Experience by Graham Nicholls, criticised him for failing &quot;to take into account psychometric properties (e.g. reliability and validity)&quot; in the questionnaire section of the book. The reviewer went on to state that the book &quot;does not meet the standards required by professional psychologists&quot;.

Well known sceptic and critic of parapsychology James Randi also responded to an article about Nicholls that appeared in 2011 asking why those mentioned in the article, including Dean Radin, Rupert Sheldrake, Michael Persinger, and Graham Nicholls have not applied for the One Million Dollar Paranormal Challenge. Nicholls penned a response to Randi expressing doubts towards Randi&#x27;s honesty, scientific credibility, and the limits of a single test to explore issues such as the existence of OBEs.

==Activism==
In 2004 Nicholls founded an organisation called the &quot;Shahmai Network&quot; with a special focus on work towards relieving poverty, as well as human rights. The network were official members of the Make Poverty History campaign focused on campaigning for debt relief to countries in situations of extreme poverty, this culminated with protests aimed to influence the G8 conference, which took place in 2005.

Beyond poverty he is also interested in the various social justice issues. According to a 2012 book on polyamory, Nicholls supports LGBT issues, polyamory, and feminism. 
In 2009 he founded www.polyamory.org.uk, the United Kingdom&#x27;s first website about polyamory; at the time he was in a polyamorous triad with two female partners.

He is also an outspoken supporter of animal rights and veganism; in a recent interview he states that he has been vegetarian since 1992 and went vegan in 2005. He also states that &quot;Veganism was the obvious next step in my ethical understanding and one that avoids supporting violent and exploitative practices.&quot;

<doc id="731773" wikidata="Q1634416" url="?curid=731773" title="Stock photography">
<text>Stock photography is the supply of photographs that are often licensed for specific uses. The stock photo industry, which began to gain hold in the 1920s, has established models including traditional macrostock photography, midstock photography, and microstock photography. Conventional stock agencies charge from several hundred to several thousand US dollars per image, while microstock photography may sell for around US$0.25. Professional stock photographers traditionally place their images with one or more stock agencies on a contractual basis, while stock agencies may accept the high-quality photos of amateur photographers through online submission.

Themes for stock photos are diverse, although Megan Garber of &quot;The Atlantic&quot; wrote in 2012 that &quot;one of the more wacky/wondrous elements of stock photos is the manner in which, as a genre, they&#x27;ve developed a unifying editorial sensibility. To see a stock image is... to &quot;know&quot; you&#x27;re seeing a stock image.&quot; Historically notable traditional stock photo agencies have included RobertStock, the Bettman Archive in New York, and the Hulton Archive in the United Kingdom, among many others. In the 1990s companies such as Photodisc in Seattle, Washington, began selling CD ROMs with packs of images, pioneering the royalty-free licensing system at a time when Rights Managed licensing was the norm in the stock industry. There was a great amount of consolidation among stock photo agencies between 1990 and the mid-2000s, particularly through Corbis and Getty Images. The early microstock company iStockphoto was founded in May 2000, followed by companies such as Dreamstime, fotoLibra, Can Stock Photo, 123RF, Shutterstock, JumpStory and Adobe Stock.

==History==

===First stock photo companies (1920–1930s)===
Newspapers and magazines were first able to reproduce photographs instead of line art in the mid-1880s with the invention of the half-tone and its use on a printing press. Initially starting with staff photographers, independent free-lance photographers eventually took over. One of the first examples of a stock photo was circa 1920 when American photographer H. Armstrong Roberts ensured that the people photographed in &quot;Group in Front of Tri-Motor Airplane&quot; all signed model releases. This allowed the photograph and others like it to be commercially viable. In an effort to save the cost of hiring photographers for commission-based photo shoots, publishers and advertisers began to consider stock photos as a less risky alternative. One of the first major stock photography libraries was founded in 1920 by H. Armstrong Roberts.

The Bettmann Archive in New York is an example of an early traditional stock agency, with the company delivering photos upon 24-hour request to magazines such as &quot;Look&quot; and &quot;Life&quot;. Founded in 1936 by Otto Bettmann, a German curator who emigrated to the United States in 1935, the Bettman Archive began with Bettmann&#x27;s personal collection of 15,000 images which he brought with him in suitcases when he escaped from Nazi Germany. He actively expanded his collection by placing ads in magazines for stills and photos. A different early pioneer with the stock industry was photographer Tony Stone, whose portfolio of mountain scenes proved popular with chocolate advertisers. Stone&#x27;s stock library eventually reached 20,000 images, each selected for its likelihood to sell multiple copies.

===New indexing systems and growth (1940s–1980s)===
Known as a stock resource for newspapers and magazines, the Hulton Archive started as the photographic archive of &quot;Picture Post&quot;. As the archive expanded through World War II, it became clear that its vast collection of photographs and negatives were becoming an important historical documentary resource. In 1945, Sir Edward Hulton set up the Hulton Press Library as a semi-independent operation and commissioned Charles Gibbs-Smith of the Victoria and Albert Museum to catalogue the entire archive using a system of keywords and classifications. The Gibbs-Smith system claims to be the world&#x27;s first indexing system for pictures, and it was eventually adopted by the British Museum collections.

===Expansion and transition online (1980s–1990s)===

By the 1980s, stock photography had become a specialty in its own right, with the stock industry advancing quickly. As photo libraries transitioned from physical archives to servers in the mid-1990s, &quot;stock libraries&quot; were increasingly called &quot;stock agencies&quot;. The archives also began to rely increasingly on keywords for sorting and retrieving photographs. In 1991, Photodisc in Seattle, Washington, began selling CD ROMs with packs of images. Unlike their competitors, Photodisc licensed the image packs as Royalty Free. In contrast to the Rights Managed system, royalty free allowed the purchaser of a CD ROM to use the images as many times as they liked without paying further fees.

There was a great amount of consolidation among stock photo agencies between 1990 and the mid-2000s, with Corbis notably acquiring the massive Bettmann Archive in 1995. After Photodisc went online in 1995, in September 1997, PhotoDisc agreed to combine with London-based Getty Communications to form the Seattle-based Getty Images. In 1996, the Hulton Picture Collection was bought by Getty Images for £8.6 million.

Alamy (registered as Alamy Limited) is a privately owned stock photography agency launched in 1999. Alamy maintains an online archive of over one hundred million still images, illustrations and hundreds of thousands of videos contributed by agencies and independent photographers or collected from news archives, museums and national collections. Its suppliers include both professional and amateur photographers, stock agencies, news archives, museums and national collections. Its clients are from the photography, publishing and advertising industries and the general public.

===Recent developments (2000–present)===

The early microstock company iStockphoto was founded in May 2000. Originally a free stock imagery website, it transitioned into its current micropayment model in 2001. iStockphoto co-founders Bruce Livingstone and Brianna Wettlaufer then went on to start Stocksy United in 2013. Helping pioneer the subscription-based model of stock photography, Shutterstock was founded in 2003 with a monthly subscription fee. Online since 2000 as a royalty-free stock photography website, in 2004 Dreamstime was founded as new microstock agency. Other stock agencies with new business models around this time included fotoLibra, which opened to the public in 2005, and Can Stock Photo, which debuted in 2004. By 2007 Dreamstime was competing with iStockphoto, Fotolia and Shutterstock, all expanded into major microstock companies. In March 2013 microstock company Depositphotos launched Clashot, a service that allows smartphone users to instantly upload photos to the photobank from their devices, followed by Fotolia, that launched the very similar Fotolia Instant later that year.

Between the 1990s and the mid-2000s, Bill Gates&#x27; Corbis Images and Getty Images combined purchased more than 40 stock photo agencies. iStockphoto, or iStock.com, was acquired by Getty in 2006. In February 2009, Jupitermedia Corporation sold their online stock images division, Jupiterimages, to Getty Images for $96 million in cash, including the sites stock.xchng and StockXpert. In 2005, Scoopt started a photo news agency for citizen journalism enabling the public to upload and sell breaking news images taken with cameraphones. In 2007 Scoopt was purchased by Getty Images, which closed it in 2009. In 2012 Shutterstock became the first microstock agency to complete an initial public offering, with the company&#x27;s shares reaching a $2.5 billion market value by late 2013.

==Description==
Stock photography refers to the supply of photographs, which are often licensed for specific uses such as magazine publishing or pamphlet-making. According to &quot;The New York Times&quot;, as of 2005 &quot;most&quot; book cover designers prefer stock photography agencies over photographers in efforts to save costs. Publishers can then purchase photographs on an exclusive or non-exclusive basis.

Established models of stock photography include:
# Macrostock: High-priced and exclusive stock photography, also known as traditional stock photography
# Midstock: Stock photography priced between micro stock and macro stock, which is often used online
# Microstock: Low-priced and inclusive stock photography. In competition to traditional agencies, microstock photography is a relatively new model of stock photography which is available through agencies that sell images for lower prices but in greater volume.

According to &quot;The New York Times&quot;, conventional stock agencies charge from several hundred to several thousand American dollars per image, and &quot;base fees on the published size of an image, circulation and other factors.&quot; Microstock photos may sell for as little as US$0.25. Professional stock photographers traditionally place their images with one or more stock agencies on a contractual basis, with a defined commission basis and specified contract term. The industry standard is purportedly 30 to 50 percent to the photographer, although at the start of the stock photography industry, fees were typically cut half and half between the agency and artist. Other stock agencies may accept the high-quality photos of amateur photographers through online submission.

Some online photo websites have created unique software to search for fitting stock photos, for example searching for complicated keyword combinations, color, shapes, and &quot;moods&quot;. Other search engines may seek to quantify the best photos by looking for elements as diverse as &quot;bright lights&quot;, &quot;evidence of emotional connections between people&quot;, and the tilt of faces.
===Styles and trends===

Traditional stock photo agencies have large catalogues that may include press archives and works by notable photographers such as Bert Hardy, Bill Brandt, Weegee and Ernst Haas. More recent trends in microstock photography include &quot;lifestyle&quot; photographs of people &quot;at work and play&quot;, food, sports, and fashion. Other stock photo themes may include stereotypes, expressing common emotions and gesticulations, pets, and images related to travel and tourism.

In the early 1990s, the stock industry focused on &quot;conceptual images&quot;, which could encapsulate themes such as &quot;global communication, success, and teamwork&quot;. After the consolidation of many stock photo agencies in the 1990s and early 2000s, new companies began focusing on &quot;niche collections&quot; including &quot;medical, science, minorities, gay and lesbian lifestyles, aviation, maps, panoramas, historical, sports, and celebrity homes&quot;. Opined Megan Garber of &quot;The Atlantic&quot; in 2012, &quot;one of the more wacky/wondrous elements of stock photos is the manner in which, as a genre, they&#x27;ve developed a unifying editorial sensibility. To see a stock image is, Potter Stewart-style, to &quot;know&quot; you&#x27;re seeing a stock image. And while stock images&#x27; stockiness may be in part due to the common visual tropes that give them their easy, cheesy impact - prettiness, preciousness, pose-iness - there&#x27;s part of it that&#x27;s more ephemeral, too. Though they have little in common, shots of a German Shepherd typing on a laptop and a man contemplating the sunset can both be, in their special way, stocky.&quot;

==Types of stock photo licenses==

===Public domain (PD)===
In relation to photography and graphics, public domain (PD) means the image is free to use without purchasing a license, and can be used for commercial or personal purposes. Works in the public domain are those whose exclusive intellectual property rights have expired, have been forfeited, or are inapplicable.

===Royalty-free (RF)===

In photography and the illustration industry, royalty-free (RF) refers to a copyright license where the user has the right to use the picture without many restrictions based on one-time payment to the licensor. The user can, therefore, use the image in several projects without having to purchase any additional licenses. RF licenses cannot be given on an exclusive basis. In stock photography, RF is one of the common licenses sometimes contrasted with Rights Managed licenses and often employed in subscription-based or microstock photography business models.

===Rights-managed (RM)===

Rights Managed (RM) in the stock photo industry (sometimes called &quot;licensed images&quot;) refers to a copyright license that, if purchased by a user, allows the one-time use of the photo as specified by the license. If the user wants to use the photo for other uses an additional license needs to be purchased. RM licenses can be given on a nonexclusive or exclusive basis. In stock photography RM is one of the two common license types together with royalty-free, subscription, and microstock photography being business models often confused as separate license types (both use the royalty-free license type).

<doc id="731774" wikidata="Q837443" url="?curid=731774" title="Law of Moses">
<text>The Law of Moses ( ), also called the Mosaic Law, is the law said to have been revealed to Moses by God. The term primarily refers to the Torah or the first five books of the Hebrew Bible.

==Terminology==
The Law of Moses or Torah of Moses (Hebrew: , &quot;Torat Moshe&quot;, Septuagint , &quot;nómos Mōusē&quot;, or in some translations the &quot;Teachings of Moses&quot;) is a biblical term first found in the Book of Joshua , where Joshua writes the Hebrew words of &quot;Torat Moshe &quot; on an altar of stones at Mount Ebal. The text continues:
The term occurs 15 times in the Hebrew Bible, a further 7 times in the New Testament, and repeatedly in Second Temple period, intertestamental, rabbinical and patristic literature.

The Hebrew word for the first five books of the Hebrew Bible, &quot;Torah&quot; (which means &quot;law&quot; and was translated into Greek as &quot;nomos&quot; or &quot;Law&quot;) refers to the same five books termed in English &quot;Pentateuch&quot; (from Latinised Greek &quot;five books&quot;, implying the five books of Moses). According to some scholars, use of the name &quot;Torah&quot; to designate the &quot;Five Books of Moses&quot; of the Hebrew Bible is clearly documented only from the 2nd century BCE.

In modern usage, &quot;Torah&quot; can refer to the first five books of the Tanakh, as the Hebrew Bible is commonly called, to the instructions and commandments found in the 2nd to 5th books of the Hebrew Bible, and also to the entire Tanakh and even all of the Oral Law as well. Among English-speaking Christians the term &quot;The Law&quot; can refer to the whole Pentateuch including Genesis, but this is generally in relation to the New Testament where &quot;nomos&quot; &quot;the Law&quot; sometimes refers to all five books, including Genesis. This use of the Hebrew term &quot;Torah&quot; (law), for the first five books is considered misleading by 21st-century Christian bible scholar John Van Seters, because the Pentateuch &quot;consists of about one half law and the other half narrative&quot;.

==Law in the Ancient Near East==
The &quot;Law of Moses&quot; in ancient Israel was different from other legal codes in the ancient Near East because transgressions were seen as offences against God rather than solely as offences against society (civil law). This contrasts with the Sumerian Code of Ur-Nammu (c. 2100–2050 BCE), and the Babylonian Code of Hammurabi (c. 1760 BCE, of which almost half concerns contract law).

However, the influence of the ancient Near Eastern legal tradition on the Law of ancient Israel is recognised and well documented, for example, in principles such as (&quot;eye for an eye&quot;), and in the content of the provisions. Some similarities are striking, such as in the provisions concerning a man-goring ox (Code of Hammurabi laws 250–252, Exodus 21:28–32). Some writers have posited direct influence: David P. Wright, for example, asserts that the Covenant Code is &quot;directly, primarily, and throughout dependent upon the Laws of Hammurabi&quot;, &quot;a creative rewriting of Mesopotamian sources ... to be viewed as an academic abstraction rather than a digest of laws&quot;. Others posit indirect influence, such as via Aramaic or Phoenician intermediaries. There is consensus that the similarities are a result of inheriting common oral traditions. Another example, the Israelite Sabbatical Year has antecedents in the Akkadian &quot;mesharum&quot; edicts granting periodic relief to the poor. An important distinction, however, is that in ancient Near East legal codes, as in more recently unearthed Ugaritic texts, an important, and ultimate, role in the legal process was assigned to the king. Ancient Israel, before the monarchical period beginning with David, was set up as a theocracy, rather than a monarchy, although God is most commonly portrayed like a king.

==Hebrew Bible==
===Moses and authorship of the Law===

According to the Hebrew Bible, Moses was the leader of early Israel out of Egypt; and traditionally the first five books of the Hebrew Bible are attributed to him, though most modern scholars believe there were multiple authors. The law attributed to Moses, specifically the laws set out in the books of Leviticus and Deuteronomy, as a consequence came to be considered supreme over all other sources of authority (any king and/or his officials), and the Levites were the guardians and interpreters of the law.

The Book of Deuteronomy () records Moses saying, &quot;Take this book of the law, and put it by the side of the Ark of the Covenant of the .&quot; Similar passages referring to the Law include, for example, Exodus 17:14, &quot;And the said unto Moses, Write this for a memorial in a book, and rehearse it in the ears of Joshua, that I will utterly blot out the remembrance of Amalek from under heaven&quot;; Exodus 24:4, &quot;And Moses wrote all the words of the , and rose up early in the morning, and built an altar under the mount, and twelve pillars, according to the twelve tribes of Israel&quot;; Exodus 34:27, &quot;And the said unto Moses, Write thou these words, for after the tenor of these words I have made a covenant with thee and with Israel&quot;; and &quot;These are the decrees, the laws and the regulations that the established on Mount Sinai between himself and the Israelites through Moses.&quot;

===Later references to the Law in the Hebrew Bible===
The Book of Kings relates how a &quot;law of Moses&quot; was discovered in the Temple during the reign of king Josiah (r. 641–609 BCE).

Another mention of the &quot;Book of the Law of Moses&quot; is found in .

===Content===
The content of the Law is spread among the books of Exodus, Leviticus, and Numbers, and then reiterated and added to in Deuteronomy. This includes:
* The Ten Commandments
* Moral laws – on murder, theft, honesty, adultery, homosexuality, etc.
* Social laws – on property, inheritance, marriage, and divorce.
* Food laws – on what is clean and unclean, on cooking and storing food.
* Purity laws – on menstruation, seminal emissions, skin disease and mildew, etc.
* Feasts – the Day of Atonement, Passover, Feast of Tabernacles, Feast of Unleavened Bread, Feast of Weeks, etc.
* Sacrifices and offerings – the sin offering, burnt offering, whole offering, heave offering, Passover sacrifice, meal offering, wave offering, peace offering, drink offering, thank offering, dough offering, incense offering, red heifer, scapegoat, first fruits, etc.
* Instructions for the priesthood and the high priest, including tithes.
* Instructions regarding the Tabernacle, and which were later applied to the Temple in Jerusalem, including those concerning the Holy of Holies containing the Ark of the Covenant (in which were the tablets of the law, Aaron&#x27;s rod, the manna). Instructions and for the construction of various altars.
* Forward looking instructions for time when Israel would demand a king.

==Rabbinical Interpretation==
The content of the instructions and its interpretations, the Oral Torah, was passed down orally, excerpted and codified in Rabbinical Judaism, and in the Talmud were numbered as the 613 commandments. The law given to Moses at Sinai (Hebrew Halakhah le-Moshe mi-Sinai הלכה למשה מסיני) is a halakhic distinction.

Rabbinic Judaism asserts that Moses presented the laws to the Jewish people, and that the laws do not apply to Gentiles (including Christians), with the exception of the Seven Laws of Noah, which (it teaches) apply to all people.

==Christian interpretation==

Orthodox Christians regard the Law of Moses as still fully in effect but transformed and fulfilled in a number of ways. Other Christians believe that only parts dealing with the moral law (as opposed to ceremonial law) are still applicable, others believe that none apply, dual-covenant theologians believe that the Old Covenant remains valid only for Jews, and a minority have the view that all parts still apply to believers in Jesus and in the New Covenant without any transformation in their character. Hebrew Catholics believe that the Law of Moses is not obligatory for Christians, but yet beneficial to preserve the Jewish identity of those Jews who have become Catholic, and as a devotional.

During the Enlightenment, European society transitioned from the religious traditional social order of the Middle Ages into the modern Age of Reason. Anti-semitism, once driven by religious conviction and the persistent belief that Jews should be blamed for the death of Jesus, was reconfigured. The influence of Hebrew scripture and authoritarian ritual practice on Christian orthodoxy (including the Catholic Church) became the basis for attacks on Church authority. Anti-Semitic polemic against the Mosaic Law became a common theme for many well-known Enlightenment philosophers. Pierre Bayle, a deist, criticized the biblical figures from the Old Testament and their adherence to religious law which he said operated in an authoritarian manner to regulate social and community behavior instead of a personal conscience that requires agency.

==In Islam==
Muslims believe Moses was one of the major prophets (and apostles) of God and the Law was one of the three major revealed scriptures known by name beside the Quran, which mentions the Law or Torah a total of eighteen times, and repeats commandments from it:

<text>The fat sand rat (Psammomys obesus) is a terrestrial mammal from the gerbil subfamily that is mostly found in North Africa and the Middle East, ranging from Mauritania to the Arabian Peninsula. This species usually lives in sandy deserts, but may also be found in rocky terrain or saline marsh areas. Fat sand rats are very selective in their diet, only eating stems and leaves of plants from the family Amaranthaceae, more commonly known as the amaranth family. In captivity, fat sand rats can become obese and rapidly develop diabetes-like symptoms when fed the diet typically given to other rodents. &quot;P. obesus&quot; has an average lifespan of 14 months in the wild and 3–4 years in captivity.

==Ecology==
=== Activity patterns ===
The fat sand rat is diurnal, but its activity on the surface fluctuates depending on the ambient temperature. Its period of activity is shortest in the summer, starting in the early morning and finishing an hour to several hours after. As the year progresses and the temperature becomes colder, the fat sand rat is active for a longer amount of time during the day, and the time at which daily activity is initiated is delayed. Upon emerging from their burrows, individuals spend a part of the beginning of their day sunbathing, engaging in other activities such as foraging afterwards.

Individuals with greater body masses have been found to forage for longer periods of time than those with a smaller body mass. When foraging, a fat sand rat will cut pieces away from plants and bring them back to their burrows, where they either eat the plant in the burrow or around the entrance, or store the plant for later consumption, which is called hoarding. The most common way that fat sand rats acquire water in the desert environment is by ingesting plants such as &quot;Atriplex halimus&quot;, which are high in water content and provide the rodent with preformed water when they are consumed. As a result of this strategy, fat sand rats do not need to drink free-standing water.

Aside from foraging, the fat sand rat also spends time outside the burrow exploring. It is atypical in its exploratory behaviour since when it encounters a novel environment it exhibits perimeter patrolling behaviours, moving in straight lines along the border of an environment, rather than engaging in looping or home base behaviours usually displayed by rodents. Males also spend more time exploring an area than females.

=== Sociality ===
Fat sand rats are not social animals. They live in separate burrows, with males occupying larger ranges of space than females. Typically, members of the same sex actively avoid interacting, but when females do encounter each other, they engage in aggressive behaviours, and will attack each other. Males can interact in an aggressive manner towards each other, pushing or displaying sideways postures, but the majority of their interactions are peaceful. Members of opposite sexes usually only interact with each other for copulation. Aside from copulation, the type of interaction that results between males and females differs depending on which individual approaches the other. When males approach females, the fat sand rats tend to interact in an agonistic manner, and display many different behaviours, some of which include sidling, displaying sideways postures, pushing, upright boxing, and attacking each other. When females initiate the interactions and approach a male, agonistic encounters also occur as with male initiated interactions, but peaceful interactions where animals will sniff, investigate, follow, and groom each other are much more common.

=== Habitat selection ===
Fat sand rats dig burrows with multiple entrances directly under plants they consume, primarily selecting burrowing sites based on the abundance of Amaranthaceae shrubs in the area over any other factor such as cover. As such, their preferred type of habitat, and the distribution of fat sand rats in a particular habitat changes throughout the year in response to the different growing season of plants in the wadi beds or terraces that they inhabit. Wadi beds are typically populated with Amaranthaceae shrubs, and have dense vegetative cover, while terraces are very sparsely vegetated, leaving the habitat exposed. Distribution of the fat sand rat in a particular habitat is also influenced by the abundance of rainfall in the area, as well as the population density of the site from the previous season. During the winter, fat sand rats prefer the wadi habitat as a result of the vegetative growth during this time, but after a wet autumn, more individuals will burrow in a terrace habitat even when population density is low, as opposed to after a dry autumn, when individuals only burrow in terrace habitats when the population density is high.

The burrowing activities of the rodents can impact their habitat, affecting the bacteria in the soil around their burrows such that nitrogen fixation and denitrification activity are decreased. The fat sand rat also disturbs vegetation cover while burrowing, further altering its environment. Mounds of active burrows have significantly less percent cover from vegetation than abandoned burrows and undisturbed land near abandoned burrows.

=== Anti-predator behaviour ===
Fat sand rats are preyed upon by many desert species, including several kinds of avian predators, snakes, desert cats, and members of the family Mustelidae. Depending on the type of habitat they have burrowed in, they are exposed to different risks concerning predation. In response to the threat of predation, they employ anti-predator vigilance behaviour when above ground, and will stop what they are doing to take an upright posture and survey the area or look intently in one direction. In addition to this posture, the rodents will thump their foot loudly and squeak before retreating into their burrow when frightened. There appears to be no reaction from other nearby individuals in response to this behaviour, so there may be no benefit in terms of warning conspecifics of predators in performing the foot thumping.

Fat sand rats in the terrace habitat spend significantly more time engaging in this vigilance behaviour when they are above ground than individuals living in the wadi beds, but the behaviour is not costly in that it does not interrupt their foraging, as both groups spend equivalent amounts of time foraging. However, there is a difference in foraging behaviour between the two groups, as fat sand rats living in terraces tend to hoard their food more often than those living in wadi beds, and take less time to eat as well. The sociality of the fat sand rat may also have an impact on their antipredator behaviours, as they have been shown to spend less time foraging and feeding, and initiate vigilance behaviour more frequently when compared to a more social desert rodent.

=== Reproduction ===
The fat sand rat breeds from autumn to early spring and produces litters usually consisting of one to eight pups, with average litter sizes increasing over the course of the breeding season. When mothers start lactating, their body energy increases, but towards the end of the lactation period, they begin to utilize stored energy instead of increasing body energy, resulting in a decrease in body mass. The growth rate of pups is maximized when the litter is small and the mother eats plants with a higher water content. The young disperse from their mother at about 5 weeks of age.

The sexual activity of male fat sand rats is not affected by weather conditions. However, there is a correlation between rainfall and the sexual activity of females, with more females being sexually active as the amount of rainfall increases. Reproductive strategies differ between the sexes, with females utilizing smaller ranges of space around their burrow with adequate food resources to provide for their young. Meanwhile, males occupy larger home ranges that overlap with multiple female ranges, creating the potential to mate with several females. Females initiate copulation and have stereotypical behaviours for approaching males, squealing and turning to dig in and kick sand towards the male. After this display, the female will exhibit lordosis, and the male will mount the female over a series of copulations. Often, a female will lose interest quickly, and will threaten or act aggressively towards the male between mounts.

==Medical significance==
Although they remain lean when fed their natural, vegetable-based diet, fat sand rats can easily become obese and acquire type 2 diabetes mellitus when they are fed a normal rodent diet of grains. Therefore, they have been used as an animal model for studies on diabetes and obesity. Sequencing of the complete nuclear DNA genome of &quot;Psammomys obesus&quot; showed that the &quot;Pdx1&quot; homeobox gene, a transcriptional activator of insulin, has undergone massive amino acid sequence changes in sand rat and other gerbil species driven by accumulation of GC-biased mutations (changes from A or T nucleotides to G or C nucleotides). It has been suggested that these changes affect function of the PDX1 protein and contributed to adaptation to low caloric intake or a diabetes-prone phenotype. However, a causative link has not been proven. Many regions of the sand rat genome, not only the Pdx1 gene, have been affected by accumulation of GC-biased mutations.

Because they are diurnal, fat sand rats are also used as models for human seasonal affective disorder.

The presence of fat sand rats in North Africa and the Middle East is of healthcare importance. &quot;Leishmania&quot; kDNA has been discovered in this rodent using molecular studies, suggesting the species can host the parasite that causes leishmaniasis in humans.

These animals have been studied extensively for their remarkably efficient kidneys: they can produce very concentrated urine, which enables them to eat halophyte plants and survive extreme heat and lack of water in their desert habitat.

<text>Murray Fletcher Pratt (25 April 1897 – 10 June 1956) was an American writer of history, science fiction, and fantasy. He is best known for his works on naval history and the American Civil War and for fiction written with L. Sprague de Camp.

== Life and work ==

According to de Camp, Pratt was born near Tonawanda, New York. The son of Robert M. and Alice Horton Pratt, he attended public schools in Buffalo and graduated from high school in 1915 at the Griffith Institute in Springville, New York, where his father operated a trucking delivery service between Springville and Buffalo.

Following high school he attended Hobart College in Geneva, New York, for one year. In February 1916 the Associated Press reported that he had been arrested for burglary in Geneva after a series of midnight cash drawer robberies that allegedly netted him less than $25. He was reported to have told police that his father did not supply him with enough funds to survive at Hobart. On February 23 the &quot;Buffalo Enquirer&quot; reported: &quot;Pratt&#x27;s father came on from Springville yesterday and it was practically decided to send the youth to the State Hospital for the Insane at Willard, pending an investigation of his case by the grand jury. It is thought that he may be mentally unsound.&quot;

In May 1918 the &quot;Washington Star&quot; reported that the staff at the camp library at the Army&#x27;s Camp Meade in Maryland had been strengthened by the addition of &quot;Murray F. Pratt, who recently came here from the Buffalo, N.Y., Public Library&quot;.

After a stint at the &quot;Buffalo Courier-Express&quot; he settled in New York City in 1920 and worked for a Staten Island newspaper before turning to freelance writing in 1923. In 1926, he married Inga Stephens, an artist. According to de Camp she was his second wife. In the late 1920s he began selling stories to pulp magazines, primarily the science fiction magazines published by Hugo Gernsback. Many of these stories were either written with a collaborator or were translations from French and German sources. 

When a fire gutted his apartment in the early 1930s, according to de Camp&#x27;s memoir, he used the insurance money to study at the Sorbonne for a year. After his return from France he was a staff writer for &quot;American Detective&quot;, a true crime magazine, and began writing histories. His short history of the Civil War, &quot;Ordeal by Fire&quot;, was published to critical acclaim in 1935 and became a bestseller.
Starting in the summer of 1937 Pratt became a regular at the annual Bread Loaf Writers&#x27; Conference in Vermont for the next 18 years, eventually becoming their Dean of Nonfiction. 

During World War II Pratt was a military analyst for the &quot;New York Post&quot; and for &quot;Time&quot; magazine (whose obituary described him as &quot;bearded, gnome-like&quot; and listed &quot;raising marmosets&quot; among his hobbies), and later was a regular reviewer of historical nonfiction and fantasy and science fiction for the &quot;New York Times Book Review&quot;.

Following World War II the Pratts came into possession of a rambling 31-room Victorian mansion on a high bluff overlooking the Atlantic Ocean at Atlantic Highlands, New Jersey, purchased by Inga Stephens Pratt&#x27;s wealthy mother for use as a summer place. Whimsically dubbed The Ipsy-Wipsy Institute, the house became a watering hole for Fletcher&#x27;s literary friends at an unending succession of marathon weekend house parties. A number of writers moved into the mansion&#x27;s many bedrooms and spent entire summers there. Frequent guests and residents at Ipsy-Wipsy included William Lindsay Gresham, John Ciardi, William Sloane, Basil Davenport, Lester del Rey, Ted Sturgeon, Esther Carlson, Fred Pohl, John D. 
Clark, Willy Ley, Judith Merrill, Eugenie Clark, L. Sprague de Camp, and many others. Laurence Manning, Pratt&#x27;s old writing partner from the 1930s, purchased part of the property and moved in next door. The Pratts simultaneously maintained a large apartment in Midtown Manhattan near Central Park, where they hosted meetings of the Hydra Club.

Pratt was the inventor of a set of rules for naval wargaming, which he created before the Second World War. This was known as the &quot;Fletcher Pratt Naval War Game&quot; and it involved dozens of tiny wooden ships, built on a scale of one inch to 50 feet. These were spread over the floor of Pratt&#x27;s apartment and their strengths were calculated via a complex mathematical formula. Noted author and artist Jack Coggins was a frequent participant in Pratt&#x27;s Navy Game, and de Camp met him through his wargaming group.

Pratt established the literary dining club known as the Trap Door Spiders in 1944. The name is a reference to the reclusive habits of the trapdoor spider, which when it enters its burrow pulls the hatch shut behind it. The club was later fictionalized as the Black Widowers in a series of mystery stories by Isaac Asimov. Pratt himself was fictionalized in one story, &quot;To the Barest&quot;, as the Widowers’ founder, Ralph Ottur.

He was also a charter member of The Civil War Round Table of New York, organized in 1951, and served as its president from 1953 to 1954. In 1956, after his death, the Round Table&#x27;s board of directors established the Fletcher Pratt Award in his honor, which is presented every May to the author or editor of the best non-fiction book on the Civil War published during the preceding calendar year.

Aside from his historical writings, Pratt is best known for his fantasy collaborations with de Camp, the most famous of which is the humorous Harold Shea series, eventually published in full as &quot;The Complete Compleat Enchanter&quot; (1989, ). His solo fantasy novels &quot;The Well of the Unicorn&quot; and &quot;The Blue Star&quot; are also highly regarded. Pratt&#x27;s story &quot;Dr. Grimshaw&#x27;s Sanitarium&quot; was adapted for radio drama by George Lefferts, and broadcast twice: first on &quot;Dimension X&quot; (September 22, 1950) and then on X Minus One (July 14, 1955). 

Pratt wrote in a markedly identifiable prose style, reminiscent of the style of Bernard DeVoto. One of his books is dedicated &quot;To Benny DeVoto, who taught me to write.&quot;

Several of Pratt&#x27;s books were illustrated by Inga Stephens Pratt, his wife.

===Legacy===
David Kahn, author of the groundbreaking 1967 book &quot;The Codebreakers&quot;, gave full credit for his start on the subject to Pratt&#x27;s &quot;Secret and Urgent&quot; (1939) that Kahn had found in the Great Neck, NY public library as a pre-teen in the 1940s.It hooked me — and I never grew up,&#x27; he told &quot;The Washington Post&quot; in 1978.&quot;

<text>A movie projector (or film projector) is an opto-mechanical device for displaying motion picture film by projecting it onto a screen. Most of the optical and mechanical elements, except for the illumination and sound devices, are present in movie cameras. Modern movie projectors are specially built video projectors (see also digital cinema).

Many projectors are specific to a particular film gauge and not all movie projectors are film projectors since the use of film is required.

==Predecessors==
The main precursor to the movie projector was the magic lantern. In its most common setup it had a concave mirror behind a light source to help direct as much light as possible through a painted glass picture slide and a lens, out of the lantern onto a screen. Simple mechanics to have the painted images moving were probably implemented since Christiaan Huygens introduced the apparatus around 1659. Initially, candles and oil lamps were used, but other light sources, such as the argand lamp and limelight were usually adopted soon after their introduction. Magic lantern presentations may often have had relatively small audiences, but the very popular phantasmagoria and dissolving views shows were usually performed in proper theatres, large tents or especially converted spaces with plenty seats.

Both Joseph Plateau and Simon Stampfer thought of lantern projection when they independently introduced stroboscopic animation in 1833 with a stroboscopic disc (which became known as the phenakistiscope), but neither of them intended to work on projection themselves. 

The oldest known successful screenings of stroboscopic animation were performed by Ludwig Döbler in 1847 in Vienna and taken on a tour to several large European cities for over a year. His Phantaskop had a front with separate lenses for each of the 12 pictures on a disc and two separate lenses were cranked around to direct light through the pictures. 

Wordsworth Donisthorpe patented ideas for a cinematographic film camera and a film presentation system in 1876. In reply to the introduction of the phonograph and a magazine&#x27;s suggestion that it could be combined with projection of stereoscopic photography, Donisthorpe stated that he could do even better and announce that he would present such images in motion. His original Kinesigraph camera gave unsatisfactory results. He had better results with a new camera in 1889 but never seems to have been successful in projecting his movies.

Eadweard Muybridge developed his Zoopraxiscope in 1879 and gave many lectures with the machine from 1880 to 1894. It projected images from rotating glass disks. The images were initially painted onto the glass, as silhouettes. A second series of discs, made in 1892–94, used outline drawings printed onto the discs photographically, then colored by hand.

Ottomar Anschütz developed his first Electrotachyscope in 1886. For each scene, 24 glass plates with chronophotographic images were attached to the edge of a large rotating wheel and thrown on a small opal-glass screen by very short synchronized flashes from a Geissler tube. He demonstrated his photographic motion from March 1887 until at least January 1890 to circa 4 or 5 people at a time, in Berlin, other large German cities, Brussels (at the 1888 Exposition Universelle), Florence, Saint Petersburg, New York, Boston and Philadelphia. Between 1890 and 1894 he concentrated on the exploitation of an automatic coin-operated version that was an inspiration for Edison Company&#x27;s Kinetoscope. From 28 November 1894 to at least May 1895 he projected his recordings from two intermittently rotating discs, mostly in 300-seat halls, in several German cities. During circa 5 weeks of screenings at the old Berlin Reichstag in February and March 1895, circa 7.000 paying visitors came to see the show.

In 1886, Louis Le Prince applied for a US patent for a 16-lens device that combined a motion picture camera with a projector. In 1888, he used an updated version of his camera to film the motion picture &quot;Roundhay Garden Scene&quot; and other scenes. The pictures were privately exhibited in Hunslet. After investing much time, effort and means in a slow and troublesome development of a definitive system, Le Prince eventually seemed satisfied with the result and had a demonstration screening scheduled in New York in 1890. However, he went missing after boarding a train in France and was declared dead in 1897. His widow and son managed to draw attention to Le Prince&#x27;s work and eventually he came to be regarded as the true inventor of film (a claim also made for many others).

After years of development, Edison eventually introduced the coin-operated peep-box Kinetoscope movie viewer in 1893, mostly in dedicated parlors. He believed this was a commercially much more viable system than projection in theatres. Many other film pioneers found chances to study the technology of the kinetoscope and further developed it for their own movie projection systems.

The Eidoloscope, devised by Eugene Augustin Lauste for the Latham family, was demonstrated for members of the press on 21 April 1895 and opened to the paying public on May 20, in a lower Broadway store with films of the Griffo-Barnett prize boxing fight, taken from Madison Square Garden&#x27;s roof on 4 May. It was the first commercial projection.

Nicholas Power opened a repair shop for Edison projectors, studied them, and developed one of the earliest and most successful projectors without excessive flicker.
Max and Emil Skladanowsky projected motion pictures with their Bioscop, a flicker-free duplex construction, from 1 to 31 November 1895. They started to tour with their motion pictures, but after catching the second presentation of the Cinématographe Lumière in Paris on 28 December 1895, they seemed to choose not to compete. They still presented their motion pictures in several European cities until March 1897, but eventually the Bioscop had to be retired as a commercial failure.

In Lyon, Louis and Auguste Lumière perfected the Cinématographe, a system that took, printed, and projected film. In late 1895 in Paris, father Antoine Lumière began exhibitions of projected films before the paying public, beginning the general conversion of the medium to projection. They quickly became Europe&#x27;s main producers with their &quot;actualités&quot; like &quot;Workers Leaving the Lumière Factory&quot; and comic vignettes like &quot;The Sprinkler Sprinkled&quot; (both 1895). Even Edison, joined the trend with the Vitascope, a modified Jenkins&#x27; Phantoscope, within less than six months.

In the 1910s, a new consumer commodity was introduced aiming at familial activity, the silent home cinema. Hand-cranked tinplate toy movie projectors, also called vintage projectors, were used taking standard 35 mm 8 perforation silent cinema films.

==Digital projectors==
In 1999, digital cinema projectors were being tried out in some movie theaters. These early projectors played the movie stored on a computer, and sent to the projector electronically. Due to their relatively low resolution (usually only 2K) compared to later digital cinema systems, the images at the time had visible pixels. By 2006, the advent of much higher 4K resolution digital projection reduced pixel visibility. The systems became more compact over time. By 2009, movie theaters started replacing film projectors with digital projectors. In 2013, it was estimated that 92% of movie theaters in the United States had converted to digital, with 8% still playing film. In 2014, numerous popular filmmakers—including Quentin Tarantino and Christopher Nolan—lobbied large studios to commit to purchase a minimum amount of 35 mm film from Kodak. The decision ensured that Kodak&#x27;s 35 mm film production would continue for several years.

Although usually more expensive than film projectors, high-resolution digital projectors offer many advantages over traditional film units. For example, digital projectors contain no moving parts except fans, can be operated remotely, are relatively compact and have no film to break, scratch or change reels of. They also allow for much easier, less expensive, and more reliable storage and distribution of content. All-electronic distribution eliminates all physical media shipments. There is also the ability to display live broadcasts in theaters equipped to do so.

==Physiology==
The illusion of motion in projected films is a stroboscopic effect that has conventionally been attributed to persistence of vision and later often to (misinterpretations of) beta movement and the phi phenomenon known from Gestalt psychology. The exact neurological principles are not yet entirely clear, but the retina, nerves and brain create the impression of apparent movement when presented with a rapid sequence of near-identical still images and interruptions that go unnoticed (or are experienced as flicker). A critical part of understanding this visual perception phenomenon is that the eye &quot;is not a camera&quot;, i.e.: there is no frame rate for the human eye or brain. Instead, the eye-brain system has a combination of motion detectors, detail detectors and pattern detectors, the outputs of all of which are combined to create the visual experience.

The frequency at which flicker becomes invisible is called the flicker fusion threshold, and is dependent on the level of illumination and the condition of the eyes of the viewer. Generally, the frame rate of 16 frames per second (frame/s) is regarded as the lowest frequency at which continuous motion is perceived by humans. This threshold varies across different species; a higher proportion of rod cells in the retina will create a higher threshold level. Because the eye and brain have no fixed capture rate, this is an elastic limit, so different viewers can be more or less sensitive in perceiving frame rates.

It is possible to view the black space between frames and the passing of the shutter by rapidly blinking one&#x27;s eyes at a certain rate. If done fast enough, the viewer will be able to randomly &quot;trap&quot; the darkness between frames or the motion of the shutter. This will not work with (now obsolete) cathode-ray tube displays, due to the persistence of the phosphors, nor with LCD or DLP light projectors, because they refresh the image instantly with no blackout intervals as with traditional film projectors.

Silent films usually were not projected at constant speeds, but could vary throughout the show because projectors were hand-cranked at the discretion of the projectionist, often following some notes provided by the distributor. When the electric motor supplanted hand cranking in both movie cameras and projectors, a more uniform frame rate became possible. Speeds ranged from about 18 frame/s on upsometimes even faster than modern sound film speed (24 frame/s).

16 frame/sthough sometimes used as a camera shooting speedwas inadvisable for projection, due to the risk of the nitrate-base prints catching fire in the projector. Nitrate film stock began to be replaced by cellulose triacetate in 1948. A nitrate film fire and its devastating effect is featured in &quot;Cinema Paradiso&quot; (1988), a fictional film which partly revolves around a projectionist and his apprentice. 

The birth of sound film created a need for a steady playback rate to prevent dialog and music from changing pitch and distracting the audience. Virtually all film projectors in commercial movie theaters project at a constant speed of 24 frame/s. This speed was chosen for both financial and technical reasons. A higher frame rate produces a better-looking picture but costs more as film stock is consumed faster. When Warner Bros. and Western Electric were trying to find the ideal compromise projection speed for the new sound pictures, Western Electric went to the Warner Theater in Los Angeles and noted the average speed at which films were projected there. They set that as the sound speed at which a satisfactory reproduction and amplification of sound could be conducted.

There are some specialist formats (e.g. Showscan and Maxivision) that project at higher rates—60 frames per second for Showscan and 48 for Maxivision. The Hobbit was shot at 48 frames per second and projected at the higher frame rate at specially equipped theaters.

Each frame of regular 24 fps movies are shown twice or more in a process called &quot;double-shuttering&quot; to reduce flicker.

==Principles of operation==

===Projection elements===
As in a slide projector there are essential optical elements:

====Light source====

Incandescent lighting and even limelight were the first light sources used in film projection. In the early 1900s up until the late 1960s, carbon arc lamps were the source of light in almost all theaters in the world.

The Xenon arc lamp was introduced in Germany in 1957 and in the US in 1963. After film platters became commonplace in the 1970s, Xenon lamps became the most common light source, as they could stay lit for extended periods of time, whereas a carbon rod used for a carbon arc could last for an hour at the most.

Most lamp houses in a professional theatrical setting produce sufficient heat to burn the film should the film remain stationary for more than a fraction of a second. Because of this, absolute care must be taken in inspecting a film so that it should not break in the gate and be damaged, particularly necessary in the era when flammable cellulose nitrate film stock was in use.

====Reflector and condenser lens====
A curved reflector redirects light that would otherwise be wasted toward the condensing lens.

A positive curvature lens concentrates the reflected and direct light toward the film gate.

====Douser====
(Also spelled &quot;dowser&quot;)

A metal or asbestos blade cuts off light before it can get to the film. The douser is usually part of the lamphouse and may be manually or automatically operated. Some projectors have a second, electrically controlled douser that is used for changeovers (sometimes called a &quot;changeover douser&quot; or &quot;changeover shutter&quot;). Some projectors have a third, mechanically controlled douser that automatically closes when the projector slows down (called a &quot;fire shutter&quot; or &quot;fire douser&quot;), to protect the film if the projector stops while the first douser is still open. Dousers protect the film when the lamp is on but the film is not moving, preventing the film from melting from prolonged exposure to the direct heat of the lamp. It also prevents the lens from scarring or cracking from excessive heat.

====Film gate and frame advance====
If a roll of film is continuously passed between the light source and the lens of the projector, only a continuous blurred series of images sliding from one edge to the other would be visible on the screen. In order to see an apparently moving clear picture, the moving film must be stopped and held still briefly while the shutter opens and closes.
The gate is where the film is held still prior to the opening of the shutter. This is the case for both filming and projecting movies. A single image of the series of images comprising the movie is positioned and held flat within the gate.
The gate also provides a slight amount of friction so that the film does not advance or retreat except when driven to advance the film to the next image. The intermittent mechanism advances the film within the gate to the next frame while the shutter is closed.
Registration pins prevent the film from advancing while the shutter is open. In most cases the registration of the frame can be manually adjusted by the projectionist, and more sophisticated projectors can maintain registration automatically.

====Shutter====
It is the gate and shutter that gives the illusion of one full frame being replaced exactly on top of another full frame. The gate holds the film still while the shutter is open. A rotating petal or gated cylindrical shutter interrupts the emitted light during the time the film is advanced to the next frame. The viewer does not see the transition, thus tricking the brain into believing a moving image is on screen. Modern shutters are designed with a flicker-rate of two times (48 Hz) or even sometimes three times (72 Hz) the frame rate of the film, so as to reduce the perception of screen flickering. (See Frame rate and Flicker fusion threshold.) Higher rate shutters are less light efficient, requiring more powerful light sources for the same light on screen.


====Imaging lens and aperture plate====

A projection objective with multiple optical elements directs the image of the film to a viewing screen. Projector lenses differ in aperture and focal length to suit different needs. Different lenses are used for different aspect ratios.

One way that aspect ratios are set is with the appropriate aperture plate, a piece of metal with a precisely cut rectangular hole in the middle of equivalent aspect ratio. The aperture plate is placed just behind the gate, and masks off any light from hitting the image outside of the area intended to be shown. All films, even those in the standard Academy ratio, have extra image on the frame that is meant to be masked off in the projection.

Using an aperture plate to accomplish a wider aspect ratio is inherently wasteful of film, as a portion of the standard frame is unused. One solution that presents itself at certain aspect ratios is the &quot;two-perf pulldown&quot;, where the film is advanced less than one full frame in order to reduce the unexposed area between frames. This method requires a special intermittent mechanism in all film-handling equipment throughout the production process, from the camera to the projector. This is costly, and prohibitively so for some theaters. The anamorphic format uses special optics to squeeze a high aspect ratio image onto a standard Academy frame thus eliminating the need to change the costly precision moving parts of the intermittent mechanisms. A special anamorphic lens is used on the camera to compress the image, and a corresponding lens on the projector to expand the image back to the intended aspect ratio.

====Viewing screen====

In most cases this is a reflective surface which may be either aluminized (for high contrast in moderate ambient light) or a white surface with small glass beads (for high brilliance under dark conditions). A switchable projection screen can be switched between opaque and clear by a safe voltage under 36V AC and is viewable from both sides. In a commercial theater, the screen also has millions of very small, evenly spaced holes in order to allow the passage of sound from the speakers and subwoofer which often are directly behind it.

===Film transport elements===

====Film supply and takeup====

=====Two-reel system=====
In the two-reel system the projector has two reels–one is the feed reel, which holds the part of the film that has not been shown, the other is the takeup reel, which winds the film that has been shown. In a two-reel projector the feed reel has a slight drag to maintain tension on the film, while the takeup reel is constantly driven with a mechanism that has mechanical slip, to allow the film to be wound under constant tension so the film is wound in a smooth manner.

The film being wound on the takeup reel is being wound &quot;head in, tails out&quot;. This means that the beginning (or &quot;head&quot;) of the reel is in the center, where it is inaccessible. As each reel is taken off of the projector, it must be re-wound onto another empty reel. In a theater setting there is often a separate machine for rewinding reels. For the 16 mm projectors that were often used in schools and churches, the projector could be re-configured to rewind films.

The size of the reels can vary based on the projectors, but generally films are divided and distributed in reels of up to , about 22 minutes at 24 frames/sec). Some projectors can even accommodate up to , which minimizes the number of changeovers (see below) in a showing. Certain countries also divide their film reels up differently; Russian films, for example, often come on reels, although it is likely that most projectionists working with changeovers would combine them into longer reels of at least , to minimize changeovers and also give sufficient time for threading and any possibly needed troubleshooting time.

Films are identified as single-reel &quot;short subjects&quot;, &quot;two-reelers&quot; (such as some of the early Laurel &amp; Hardy, The Three Stooges, and other comedies), and &quot;features&quot;, which can take any number of reels (although most are limited to 1½ to 2 hours in length, enabling the theater to have multiple showings throughout the day and evening, each showing with a feature, commercials, and intermission to allow the audiences to change). For some time (ca. 1930–1960), a typical showing meant a short subject (a newsreel, short documentary, a &quot;two-reeler&quot;, etc.), a cartoon, and the feature. Some theaters would have movie-based commercials for local businesses, and the state of New Jersey required showing a diagram of the theater showing all of the exits.

=====Changeover systems=====
Because a single film reel does not contain enough film to show an entire feature, the film is distributed on multiple reels. To prevent having to interrupt the show when one reel ends and the next is mounted, two projectors are used in what is known as a &quot;changeover system&quot;. A human would, at the appropriate point, manually stop the first projector, shutting off its light, and start the second projector, which the projectionist had ready and waiting. Later the switching was partially automated, although the projectionist still needed to rewind and mount the bulky, heavy film reels. (35mm reels as received by theaters came unrewound; rewinding was the task of the operator who received the reel.) The two-reel system, using two identical projectors, was used almost universally for movie theaters before the advent of the single-reel system. Projectors were built that could accommodate a much larger reel, containing an entire feature. Although one-reel long-play systems tend to be more popular with the newer multiplexes, the two-reel system is still in significant use to this day.

As the reel being shown approaches its end, the projectionist looks for cue marks at the upper-right corner of the picture. Usually these are dots or circles, although they can also be slashes. Some older films occasionally used squares or triangles, and sometimes positioned the cues in the middle of the right edge of the picture.

The first cue appears before the end of the program on the reel, equivalent to eight seconds at the standard speed of 24 frames per second. This cue signals the projectionist to start the motor of the projector containing the next reel. After another of film is shown (seven seconds at 24 frames/sec), the changeover cue should appear, which signals the projectionist to actually make the changeover. When this second cue appears, the projectionist has , or one second, to make the changeover. If it does not occur within one second, the film will end and blank white light will be projected on the screen.

Twelve feet before the &quot;first frame of action&quot; countdown leaders have a &quot;start&quot; frame. The projectionist positions the start frame in the gate of the projector. When the first cue is seen, the motor of the starting projector is started. Seven seconds later the end of the leader and start of program material on the new reel should just reach the gate of the projector when the changeover cue is seen.

On some projectors, the operator would be alerted to the time for a change by a bell that operated when the feed reel rotation exceeded a certain speed (the feed reel rotates faster as the film is exhausted), or based on the diameter of the remaining film (Premier Changeover Indicator Pat. No. 411992), although many projectors do not have such an auditory system.

During the initial operation of a changeover, the two projectors use an interconnected electrical control connected to the changeover button so that as soon as the button is pressed, the changeover douser on the outgoing projector is closed in sync with the changeover douser on the incoming projector opening. If done properly, a changeover should be virtually unnoticeable to an audience. In older theaters, there may be manually operated, sliding covers in front of the projection booth&#x27;s windows. A changeover with this system is often clearly visible as a wipe on the screen.

Once the changeover has been made, the projectionist unloads the full takeup reel from projector &quot;A&quot; moves the now-empty reel (that used to hold the film just unloaded) from the feed spindle to the takeup spindle, and loads reel #3 of the presentation on projector &quot;A&quot;. When reel 2 on projector &quot;B&quot; is finished, the changeover switches the live show from projector &quot;B&quot; back to projector &quot;A&quot;, and so on for the rest of the show.

When the projectionist removes a finished reel from the projector it is &quot;tails out&quot;, and needs to be rewound before the next show. The projectionist usually uses a separate rewind machine and a spare empty reel and rewinds the film so it is &quot;head out&quot;, ready to project again for the next show.

One advantage of this system (at least for the theatre management) was that if a program was running a few minutes late for any reason, the projectionist would simply omit one (or more) reels of film to recover the time.

In the early years, with no automation, errors were far from unknown: these included starting a movie that had not been rewound and getting reels confused, so they were projected in the wrong order. Correcting either of these, assuming that someone could tell that the reels were confused, required a complete stop of both projectors, often turning on the house lights, and a delay of a minute or so while the projectionist corrected the error and restarted a projector. These highly visible gaffes, which embarrassed the theater operators, were eliminated with the single-reel and digital systems.

=====Single-reel system=====

There are two widely used single-reel systems (also known as long-play systems) today: the tower system (vertical feed and takeup) and the platter system (non-rewinding; horizontal feed and takeup).

The tower system largely resembles the two-reel system, except in that the tower itself is generally a separate piece of equipment used with a slightly modified standard projector. The feed and takeup reels are held vertically on the axis, except behind the projector, on oversized spools with capacity or about 133 minutes at 24 frame/s. This large capacity alleviates the need for a changeover on an average-length feature; all of the reels are spliced together into one giant one. The tower is designed with four spools, two on each side, each with its own motor. This allows the whole spool to be immediately rewound after a showing; the extra two spools on the other side allow for a film to be shown while another is being rewound or even made up directly onto the tower. Each spool requires its own motor in order to set proper tensioning for the film since it has to travel (relatively) much further between the projector film transport and the spools. As each spool gains or loses film, the tension must be periodically checked and adjusted so that the film can be transported on and off the spools without either sagging or snapping.

In a platter system the individual 20-minute reels of film are also spliced together as one large reel, but the film is then wound onto a horizontal rotating table called a platter. Three or more platters are stacked together to create a platter system. Most of the platters in a platter system will be occupied by film prints; whichever platter happens to be empty serves as the &quot;take-up reel&quot; to receive the film that is playing from another platter.

The way the film is fed from the platter to the projector is not unlike an eight-track audio cartridge. Film is unwound from the center of the platter through a mechanism called a payout unit which controls the speed of the platter&#x27;s rotation so that it matches the speed of the film as it is fed to the projector. The film winds through a series of rollers from the platter stack to the projector, through the projector, through another series of rollers back to the platter stack, and then onto the platter serving as the take-up reel.

This system makes it possible to project a film multiple times without needing to rewind it. As the projectionist threads the projector for each showing, the payout unit is transferred from the empty platter to the full platter and the film then plays back onto the platter it came from. In the case of a double feature, each film plays from a full platter onto an empty platter, swapping positions on the platter stack throughout the day.
The advantage of a platter is that the film need not be rewound after each show, which can save labor. Rewinding risks rubbing the film against itself, which can cause scratching of the film and smearing of the emulsion that carries the pictures. The disadvantages of the platter system are that the film can acquire diagonal scratches on it if proper care is not taken while threading film from platter to projector, and the film has more opportunity to collect dust and dirt as long lengths of film are exposed to the air. A clean projection booth kept at the proper humidity is of great importance, as are cleaning devices that can remove dirt from the film print as it plays.

=====Automation and the rise of the multiplex=====
The single reel system can allow for the complete automation of the projection booth operations, given the proper auxiliary equipment. Since films are still transported in multiple reels they must be joined together when placed on the projector reel and taken apart when the film is to be returned to the distributor. It is the complete automation of projection that has enabled the modern &quot;multiplex&quot; cinema – a single site typically containing from 8 to 24 theaters with only a few projection and sound technicians, rather than a platoon of projectionists. The multiplex also offers a great amount of flexibility to a theater operator, enabling theaters to exhibit the same popular production in more than one auditorium with staggered starting times. It is also possible, with the proper equipment installed, to &quot;interlock&quot;, i.e. thread a single length of film through multiple projectors. This is very useful when dealing with the mass crowds that an extremely popular film may generate in the first few days of showing, as it allows for a single print to serve more patrons.

====Feed and extraction sprockets====
Smooth wheels with triangular pins called sprockets engage perforations punched into one or both edges of the film stock. These serve to set the pace of film movement through the projector and any associated sound playback system.

====Film loop====
As with motion picture cameras, the intermittent motion of the gate requires that there be loops above and below the gate in order to serve as a buffer between the constant speed enforced by the sprockets above and below the gate and the intermittent motion enforced at the gate. Some projectors also have a sensitive trip pin above the gate to guard against the upper loop becoming too big. If the loop hits the pin, it will close the dousers and stop the motor to prevent an excessively large loop from jamming the projector.

====Film gate pressure plate====
A spring-loaded pressure plate functions to align the film in a consistent image plane, both flat and perpendicular to the optical axis. It also provides sufficient drag to prevent film motion during the frame display, while still allowing free motion under control of the intermittent mechanism. The plate also has spring-loaded runners to help hold film while in place and advance it during motion.

====Intermittent mechanism====
The intermittent mechanism can be constructed in different ways. For smaller gauge projectors (8 mm and 16 mm), a pawl mechanism engages the film&#x27;s sprocket hole one side, or holes on each side. This pawl advances only when the film is to be moved to the next image. As the pawl retreats for the next cycle it is drawn back and does not engage the film. This is similar to the claw mechanism in a motion picture camera.

In 35 mm and 70 mm projectors, there usually is a special sprocket immediately underneath the pressure plate, known as the intermittent sprocket. Unlike all the other sprockets in the projector, which run continuously, the intermittent sprocket operates in tandem with the shutter, and only moves while the shutter is blocking the lamp, so that the motion of the film cannot be seen. It also moves in a discrete amount at a time, equal to the number of perforations that make up a frame (4 for 35 mm, 5 for 70 mm). The intermittent movement in these projectors is usually provided by a Geneva drive, also known as the Maltese Cross mechanism.

IMAX projectors use what is known as the &quot;rolling loop method&quot;, in which each frame is sucked into the gate by a vacuum and positioned by registration pins in the perforations corresponding to that frame.

==Types==
Projectors are classified by the size of the film used, i.e. the film format. Typical film sizes:

===8 mm===

Long used for home movies before the video camera, this uses double-sprocketed 16 mm film, which is run through the camera, exposing one side, then removed from the camera, the takeup and feed reels are switched, and the film run through a second time, exposing the other side. The 16 mm film is then split lengthwise into two 8 mm pieces that are spliced to make a single projectable film with sprockets holes on one side.

===Super 8===

Developed by Kodak, this film stock uses very small sprocket holes close to the edge that allow more of the film stock to be used for the images. This increases the quality of the image. The unexposed film is supplied in the 8 mm width, not split during processing as is the earlier 8 mm. Magnetic stripes could be added to carry encoded sound to be added after film development. Film could also be pre-striped for direct sound recording in suitably equipped cameras for later projection.

===9.5 mm===

Film format introduced by Pathé Frères in 1922 as part of the Pathé Baby amateur film system. It was conceived initially as an inexpensive format to provide copies of commercially made films to home users. The format uses a single, central perforation (sprocket hole) between each pair of frames, as opposed to 8 mm film which has perforations along one edge, and most other film formats which have perforations on each side of the image. 
It became very popular in Europe over the next few decades and is still used by a small number of enthusiasts today. Over 300,000 projectors were produced and sold mainly in France and England, and many commercial features were available in the format. In the sixties, the last projectors of this format were being produced. The gauge is still alive today. 16 mm projectors are converted to 9,5mm and it is still possible to buy film stock (from the French Color City company).

===16 mm===

This was a popular format for audio-visual use in schools and as a high-end home entertainment system before the advent of broadcast television. In broadcast television news, 16 mm film was used before the advent of electronic news-gathering. The most popular home content were comedic shorts (typically less than 20 minutes in length in the original release) and bundles of cartoons previously seen in movie theaters. 16 mm enjoys widespread use today as a format for short films, independent features and music videos, being a relatively economical alternative to 35 mm. 16 mm film was a popular format used for the production of TV shows well into the HDTV era.

===35 mm===
The most common film size for theatrical productions during the 20th century. In fact, the common 35 mm camera, developed by Leica, was designed to use this film stock and was originally intended to be used for test shots by movie directors and cinematographers. 

35 mm film is typically run vertically through the camera and projector. In the mid-1950s the VistaVision system presented widescreen movies in which the film moved horizontally, allowing much more film to be used for the image as this avoided the anamorphic reduction of the image to fit the frame width. As this required specific projectors it was largely unsuccessful as a presentation method while remaining attractive as filming, intermediate, and source for production printing and as an intermediate step in special effects to avoid film granularity, although the latter is now supplanted by digital methods.

===70 mm===

High-end movie productions were often produced in this film gauge in the 1950s and 1960s and many very large screen theaters are still capable of projecting it in the 21st century. It is often referred to as &quot;65/70&quot;, as the camera uses film 65 mm wide, but the projection prints are 70 mm wide. The extra five millimeters of film accommodated the soundtrack, usually a six-track magnetic stripe. The most common theater installation would use dual-gauge 35/70 mm projectors.

70 mm film is also used in both the flat and domed IMAX projection system. In IMAX the film is transported horizontally in the film gate, similar to VistaVision.
Some productions intended for 35 mm anamorphic release were also released using 70 mm film stock. A 70 mm print made from a 35 mm negative is significantly better in appearance than an all-35 mm process and allowed for a release with six-track magnetic audio.

The advent of 35 mm prints with digital soundtracks in the 1990s largely supplanted the widespread release of the more expensive 70 mm prints.

==Sound==
Regardless of the sound format, any sound represented on the film image itself will not be the sound for the particular frame it occupies. In the gate of the projector head, there is no space for a reader, and the film is not travelling smoothly at the gate position. Consequently, all optical sound formats must be offset from the image because the sound reader is usually located above (for magnetic readers and most digital optical readers) or below (for analog optical readers and a few digital optical) the projector head.

:&quot;See the 35 mm film article for more information on both digital and analog methods.&quot;

===Optical===
Optical sound constitutes the recording and reading of amplitude based on the amount of light that is projected through a soundtrack area on a film using an illuminating light or laser and a photocell or photodiode. As the photocell picks up the light in varying intensities, the electricity produced is intensified by an amplifier, which in turn powers a loudspeaker, where the electrical impulses are turned into air vibrations and thus, sound waves. In 16 mm, this optical soundtrack is a single mono track placed on the right side of the projected image, and the sound head is 26 frames after the gate. In 35 mm, this can be mono or stereo, on the left side of the projected image, with the sound head 21 frames after the gate.

The first form of optical sound was represented by horizontal bands of clear (white) and solid (black) area. The space between solid points represented amplitude and was picked up by the photo-electric cell on the other side of a steady, thin beam of light being shined through it. This &quot;variable density&quot; form of sound was eventually phased out because of its incompatibility with color stocks. The alternative and ultimately the successor of variable density has been the &quot;variable area&quot; track, in which a clear, vertical waveform against black represents the sound, and the width of the waveform is equivalent to the amplitude. Variable area does have slightly less frequency response than variable density, but because of the grain and variable infrared absorption of various film stocks, variable density has a lower signal-to-noise ratio.

Optical stereo is recorded and read through a bilateral variable area track. Dolby MP matrix encoding is used to add extra channels beyond the stereo pair. Left, center, right and surround channels are matrix-encoded into the two optical tracks, and decoded using licensed equipment.

In the 1970s and early 1980s, optical sound Super-8 mm copies were produced mainly for airline in-flight movies. Even though this technology was soon made obsolete by video equipment, the majority of small-gauge films used magnetic sound rather than optical sound for a higher frequency range.

===Magnetic===
Magnetic sound is no longer used in commercial cinema, but between 1952 and the early 1990s (when optical digital movie sound rendered it obsolete) it provided the highest fidelity sound from film because of its wider frequency range and superior signal-to-noise ratio compared to optical sound. There are two forms of magnetic sound in conjunction with projection: double-head and striped.

The first form of magnetic sound was the double-head system, in which the movie projector was interlocked with a dubber playing a 35 mm reel of a full-coat, or film completely coated with magnetic iron-oxide. This was introduced in 1952 with Cinerama, holding six tracks of stereophonic sound. Stereophonic releases throughout 1953 also used an interlocked full-coat for three-channel stereophonic sound.

In interlock, since the sound is on a separate reel, it does not need to be offset from the image. Today, this system is usually used only for very low-budget or student productions, or for screening rough cuts of films before the creation of a final married print. Sync between the two reels is checked with SMPTE leader, also known as countdown leader. If the two reels are synced, there should be one frame of &quot;beep&quot; sound exactly on the &quot;2&quot; frame of the countdown – two seconds, or 48 frames, before the picture start.

Striped magnetic film is motion picture film in which stripes of magnetic oxide are placed on the film between the sprocket holes and the edge of the film, and sometimes also between the sprocket holes and the image. Each of these stripes has one channel of the audio recorded on it. This technique was first introduced in September, 1953 by Hazard E. Reeves for Cinemascope. Four tracks are present on the film: Left, Center, Right and Surround. This 35 mm four-track magnetic sound format was used from 1954 through 1982 for &quot;roadshow&quot; screenings of big-budget feature films.

70 mm, which had no optical sound, used the five millimeters gained between the 65 mm negative and the final release print to place three magnetic tracks outside of the perforations on each side of the film for a total of six tracks. Until the introduction of digital sound, it was fairly common for 35 mm films to be blown up to 70 mm often just to take advantage of the greater number of soundtracks and the fidelity of the audio.

Although magnetic audio was of excellent quality it also had significant disadvantages. Magnetic sound prints were expensive, 35 mm magnetic prints cost roughly twice as much as optical sound prints, whilst 70 mm prints could cost up to 15 times as much as 35 mm prints. Furthermore, the oxide layer wore out faster than the film itself, and magnetic tracks were prone to damage and accidental erasure. Because of the high cost of installing magnetic sound reproduction equipment only a minority of movie theaters ever installed it and the magnetic soundheads needed considerable maintenance to keep their performance up to standard. As a consequence the use of the Cinemascope 35 mm four-track magnetic sound format decreased significantly during the course of the 1960s and received stiff competition from the Dolby SVA optical encoding format. However, 70 mm film continued to be used for prestigious &quot;roadshow&quot; screenings until the introduction of digital sound on 35 mm film in the early 1990s removed one of the major justifications for using this expensive format.

On certain stocks of Super 8 and 16 mm an iron-oxide sound recording strip was added for the direct synchronous recording of sound which could then be played by projectors with a magnetic sound head. It has since been discontinued by Kodak on both gauges.

===Digital===
Modern theatrical systems use optical representations of digitally encoded multi-channel sound. An advantage of digital systems is that the offset between the sound and picture heads can be varied and then set with the digital processors. Digital sound heads are usually above the gate. All digital sound systems currently in use have the ability to instantly and gracefully fall back to the analog optical sound system should the digital data be corrupt or the whole system fail.

====Cinema Digital Sound (CDS)====

Created by Kodak and ORC (Optical Radiation Corporation), Cinema Digital Sound was the first attempt to bring multi-channel digital sound to first-run theaters. CDS was available on both 35 mm and 70 mm films. Film prints equipped with CDS did not have the conventional analog optical or magnetic soundtracks to serve as a back-up in case the digital sound was unreadable. Another disadvantage of not having an analog back-up track is that CDS required extra film prints be made for the theaters equipped to play CDS. The three formats that followed, Dolby Digital, DTS and SDDS, can co-exist with each other and the analog optical soundtrack on a single version of the film print. This means that a film print carrying all three of these formats (and the analog optical format, usually Dolby SR) can be played in whichever format the theater is equipped to handle. CDS did not achieve widespread use and ultimately failed. It premiered with the film &quot;Dick Tracy&quot; and was used with several other films, such as &quot;Days of Thunder&quot; and &quot;Terminator 2: Judgment Day&quot;.

====Sony Dynamic Digital Sound (SDDS)====

SDDS runs on the outside of 35 mm film, between the perforations and the edges, on both edges of the film. It was the first digital system that could handle up to eight channels of sound. The additional two tracks are for an extra pair of screen channels (Left Center and Right Center) located between the 3 regular screen channels (Left, Center and Right). A pair of CCDs located in a unit above the projector reads the two SDDS tracks. The information is decoded and decompressed before being passed along to the cinema sound processor. By default, SDDS units use an onboard Sony Cinema Sound Processor, and when the system is set up in this manner, the theatre&#x27;s entire sound system can be equalized in the digital domain. The audio data in an SDDS track is compressed in the 20-bit ATRAC2 compression scheme at a ratio of about 4.5:1. SDDS premiered with the film &quot;Last Action Hero&quot;. SDDS was the least commercially successful of the three competing digital sound systems for 35 mm film. Sony ceased the sale of SDDS processors in 2001–2002.

====Dolby Digital====

Dolby Digital data is printed in the spaces between the perforations on the soundtrack side of the film, 26 frames before the picture. Release prints with Dolby Digital always include an analog Dolby Stereo soundtrack with Dolby SR noise reduction, thus these prints are known as Dolby SR-D prints. Dolby Digital produces 6 discrete channels. In a variant called SR-D EX, the left and right surround channels can be dematrixed into left, right, and back surround, using a matrix system similar to Dolby Pro Logic. The audio data in a Dolby Digital track is compressed in the 16-bit AC-3 compression scheme at a ratio of about 12:1. The images between each perforation are read by a CCD located either above the projector or in the regular analog sound head below the film gate, a digital delay within the processor allowing correct lip-sync to be achieved regardless of the position of the reader relative to the picture gate. The information is then decoded, decompressed and converted to analog; this can happen either in a separate Dolby Digital processor that feeds signals to the cinema sound processor, or digital decoding can be built into the cinema processor. One disadvantage of this system is if the digital printing is not entirely within the space between the sprocket holes; if the track was off a bit on either the top or the bottom, the sound track would be unplayable, and a replacement reel would have to be ordered.

In 2006, Dolby discontinued the sale of their external SR-D processor (the DA20), but included Dolby Digital decoding in their CP500 and later CP650 cinema processors.

A consumer version of Dolby Digital is also used on most DVDs, often at higher data rates than the original film. A bit-for-bit version is used on Blu-ray Discs and HD DVDs called Dolby TrueHD. Dolby Digital officially premiered with the film &quot;Batman Returns&quot;, but it was earlier tested at some screenings of &quot;Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country&quot;.

====Digital Theater Systems (DTS)====

DTS actually stores the sound information on separate CD-ROMs supplied with the film. The CDs are fed into a special, modified computer that syncs up with the film through the use of DTS time code, decompresses the sound, and passes it through to a standard cinema processor. The time code is placed between the optical soundtracks and the actual picture and is read by an optical LED ahead of the gate. The time code is actually the only sound system that is not offset within the film from the picture but still needs to be physically set offset ahead of the gate in order to maintain continuous motion. Each disc can hold slightly over 90 minutes of sound, so longer films require a second disc. Three types of DTS sound exist: DTS-ES (Extended Surround), an 8-channel digital system; DTS-6, a 6-track digital system, and a now-obsolete 4 channel system. DTS-ES derives a back surround channel from the left surround and right surround channels using Dolby Pro Logic. The audio data in a DTS track is compressed in the 20-bit APTX-100 compression scheme at a ratio of 4:1.

Of the three digital formats currently in use, DTS is the only one that has been used with 70 mm presentations. DTS was premiered on &quot;Jurassic Park&quot;. Datasat Digital Entertainment, purchaser of DTS&#x27;s cinema division in May 2008, now distributes Datasat Digital Sound to professional cinemas worldwide.
A consumer version of DTS is available on some DVDs, and was used to broadcast stereo TV prior to DTV. A bit-for-bit version of the DTS soundtrack is on Blu-ray Discs and HD DVDs called DTS-HD MA (DTS-HD Master Audio).

==Leaders==
Academy leader is placed at the head of film release prints containing information for the projectionist and featuring numbers which are black on a clear background, counting from 11 to 3 at 16-frame intervals (16 frames in 35 mm film = 1 ft). At −12 feet there is a START frame. The numbers appear as a single frame in opaque black leader.

SMPTE leader is placed at the head of film release prints or video masters containing information for the projectionist or video playback tech. The numbers count down in seconds from &quot;8&quot; to &quot;2&quot; at 24-frame intervals ending at the first frame of the &quot;2&quot; followed by 47 film frames of dark gray or black. Each number is held on the screen for 24 frames while an animated sweep-arm moves clockwise behind the number. As the sweep arm moves across the background field, the color changes from light gray to dark gray. Unlike the other numbers, the &quot;2&quot; only appears for one frame.

Usually there&#x27;s a one-frame audio pop that plays 48 film frames (two seconds at 24 frames per second) before the first frame of action (FFOA). The pop is used to line up and synchronize audio and picture/video during printing processes or postproduction. The pop is in editorial (level) synchronization with the &quot;2&quot; frame on the SMPTE and EBU leader, and with the &quot;3&quot; frame on the Academy leader. On most theatrical release prints, the pop is removed by the laboratory to avoid any accidental playing of it during a screening.

EBU leader (European Broadcast Union) is very similar to the SMPTE leader but with some superficial graphics differences.

==Types of lenses and screens==

===Spherical===
Most motion picture lenses are of the spherical variety. Spherical lenses do not distort the image intentionally. Used alone for standard and cropped wide-screen projection, and in conjunction with an anamorphic adapter for anamorphic wide-screen projection, the spherical lens is the most common and versatile projection lens type.

===Anamorphic===
Anamorphic filming uses only special lenses, and requires no other modifications to the camera, projector and intermediate gear. The intended wide-screen image is compressed optically, using additional cylindrical elements within the lens so that when the compressed image strikes the film, it matches the standard frame size of the camera. At the projector a corresponding lens restores the wide aspect ratio to be seen on the screen. The anamorphic element can be an attachment to existing spherical lenses.

Some anamorphic formats utilized a more squarish aspect ratio (1.18:1, vs. the Academy 1.375:1 ratio) on-film in order to accommodate more magnetic or optical tracks. Various anamorphic implementations have been marketed under several brand names, including CinemaScope, Panavision and Superscope, with Technirama implementing a slightly different anamorphic technique using vertical expansion to the film rather than horizontal compression. Large format anamorphic processes included Ultra Panavision and MGM Camera 65 (which was renamed Ultra Panavision 70 in the early 60s). Anamorphic is sometimes called &quot;scope&quot; in theater projection parlance, presumably in reference to CinemaScope.

===Fish eye with dome===
The IMAX dome projection method (called &quot;OMNIMAX&quot;) uses 70 mm film running sideways through the projector to maximize the image area and extreme wide angle lenses to obtain an almost hemispherical image. The field of view is tilted, as is the projection hemisphere, so one may view a portion of the ground in the foreground. Owing to the great area covered by the picture it is not as bright as seen with flat screen projection, but the immersive qualities are quite convincing. While there are not many theaters capable of displaying this format there are regular productions in the fields of nature, travel, science, and history, and productions may be viewed in most large urban regions. These dome theaters are mostly located in large and prosperous science and technology museums.

===Wide and deep flat screen===
The IMAX flat screen system uses large format film, a wide and deep screen, and close and quite steep &quot;stadium&quot; seating. The effect is to fill the visual field to a greater degree than is possible with conventional wide-screen systems. Like the IMAX dome, this is found in major urban areas, but unlike the dome system it is practical to reformat existing movie releases to this method. Also, the geometry of the theater and screen are more amenable to inclusion within a newly constructed but otherwise conventional multiple theater complex than is the dome-style theater.

===Multiple cameras and projectors===
One wide screen development during the 1950s used non-anamorphic projection but used three side-by-side synchronized projectors. Called Cinerama, the images were projected onto an extremely wide, curved screen. Some seams were said to be visible between the images but the almost complete filling of the visual field made up for this. This showed some commercial success as a limited location (only in major cities) exhibition of the technology in &quot;This is Cinerama&quot;, but the only memorable story-telling film made for this technology was &quot;How the West Was Won&quot;, widely seen only in its Cinemascope re-release.

While neither a technical nor a commercial success, the business model survives as implemented by the documentary production, limited release locations, and long-running exhibitions of IMAX dome movies.

==Three-dimensional==
For techniques used to display pictures with a three-dimensional appearance (3D), see the 3D film article for some movie history and the stereoscopy article for technical information.

<text>Geometrical optics, or ray optics, is a model of optics that describes light propagation in terms of &quot;rays&quot;. The ray in geometrical optics is an abstraction useful for approximating the paths along which light propagates under certain circumstances.

The simplifying assumptions of geometrical optics include that light rays:
* propagate in straight-line paths as they travel in a homogeneous medium
* bend, and in particular circumstances may split in two, at the interface between two dissimilar media
* follow curved paths in a medium in which the refractive index changes
* may be absorbed or reflected.

Geometrical optics does not account for certain optical effects such as diffraction and interference, which are considered in physical optics. This simplification is useful in practice; it is an excellent approximation when the wavelength is small compared to the size of structures with which the light interacts. The techniques are particularly useful in describing geometrical aspects of imaging, including optical aberrations.

==Explanation==


A light ray is a line or curve that is perpendicular to the light&#x27;s wavefronts (and is therefore with the wave vector).
A slightly more rigorous definition of a light ray follows from Fermat&#x27;s principle, which states that the path taken between two points by a ray of light is the path that can be traversed in the least time.

Geometrical optics is often simplified by making the paraxial approximation, or &quot;small angle approximation&quot;. The mathematical behavior then becomes linear, allowing optical components and systems to be described by simple matrices. This leads to the techniques of Gaussian optics and &quot;paraxial ray tracing&quot;, which are used to find basic properties of optical systems, such as approximate image and object positions and magnifications.

==Reflection==
Glossy surfaces such as mirrors reflect light in a simple, predictable way. This allows for production of reflected images that can be associated with an actual (real) or extrapolated (virtual) location in space.

With such surfaces, the direction of the reflected ray is determined by the angle the incident ray makes with the surface normal, a line perpendicular to the surface at the point where the ray hits. The incident and reflected rays lie in a single plane, and the angle between the reflected ray and the surface normal is the same as that between the incident ray and the normal. This is known as the Law of Reflection.

For flat mirrors, the law of reflection implies that images of objects are upright and the same distance behind the mirror as the objects are in front of the mirror. The image size is the same as the object size. (The magnification of a flat mirror is equal to one.) The law also implies that mirror images are parity inverted, which is perceived as a left-right inversion.

Mirrors with curved surfaces can be modeled by ray tracing and using the law of reflection at each point on the surface. For mirrors with parabolic surfaces, parallel rays incident on the mirror produce reflected rays that converge at a common focus. Other curved surfaces may also focus light, but with aberrations due to the diverging shape causing the focus to be smeared out in space. In particular, spherical mirrors exhibit spherical aberration. Curved mirrors can form images with magnification greater than or less than one, and the image can be upright or inverted. An upright image formed by reflection in a mirror is always virtual, while an inverted image is real and can be projected onto a screen.

==Refraction==

Refraction occurs when light travels through an area of space that has a changing index of refraction. The simplest case of refraction occurs when there is an interface between a uniform medium with index of refraction formula_1 and another medium with index of refraction formula_2. In such situations, Snell&#x27;s Law describes the resulting deflection of the light ray:
formula_3
where formula_4 and formula_5 are the angles between the normal (to the interface) and the incident and refracted waves, respectively. This phenomenon is also associated with a changing speed of light as seen from the definition of index of refraction provided above which implies:
formula_6
where formula_7 and formula_8 are the wave velocities through the respective media.

Various consequences of Snell&#x27;s Law include the fact that for light rays traveling from a material with a high index of refraction to a material with a low index of refraction, it is possible for the interaction with the interface to result in zero transmission. This phenomenon is called total internal reflection and allows for fiber optics technology. As light signals travel down a fiber optic cable, they undergo total internal reflection allowing for essentially no light lost over the length of the cable. It is also possible to produce polarized light rays using a combination of reflection and refraction: When a refracted ray and the reflected ray form a right angle, the reflected ray has the property of &quot;plane polarization&quot;. The angle of incidence required for such a scenario is known as Brewster&#x27;s angle.

Snell&#x27;s Law can be used to predict the deflection of light rays as they pass through &quot;linear media&quot; as long as the indexes of refraction and the geometry of the media are known. For example, the propagation of light through a prism results in the light ray being deflected depending on the shape and orientation of the prism. Additionally, since different frequencies of light have slightly different indexes of refraction in most materials, refraction can be used to produce dispersion spectra that appear as rainbows. The discovery of this phenomenon when passing light through a prism is famously attributed to Isaac Newton.

Some media have an index of refraction which varies gradually with position and, thus, light rays curve through the medium rather than travel in straight lines. This effect is what is responsible for mirages seen on hot days where the changing index of refraction of the air causes the light rays to bend creating the appearance of specular reflections in the distance (as if on the surface of a pool of water). Material that has a varying index of refraction is called a gradient-index (GRIN) material and has many useful properties used in modern optical scanning technologies including photocopiers and scanners. The phenomenon is studied in the field of gradient-index optics.

A device which produces converging or diverging light rays due to refraction is known as a lens. Thin lenses produce focal points on either side that can be modeled using the lensmaker&#x27;s equation. In general, two types of lenses exist: convex lenses, which cause parallel light rays to converge, and concave lenses, which cause parallel light rays to diverge. The detailed prediction of how images are produced by these lenses can be made using ray-tracing similar to curved mirrors. Similarly to curved mirrors, thin lenses follow a simple equation that determines the location of the images given a particular focal length (formula_9) and object distance 
formula_10
where formula_11 is the distance associated with the image and is considered by convention to be negative if on the same side of the lens as the object and positive if on the opposite side of the lens. The focal length f is considered negative for concave lenses.

Incoming parallel rays are focused by a convex lens into an inverted real image one focal length from the lens, on the far side of the lens.

Rays from an object at finite distance are focused further from the lens than the focal distance; the closer the object is to the lens, the further the image is from the lens. With concave lenses, incoming parallel rays diverge after going through the lens, in such a way that they seem to have originated at an upright virtual image one focal length from the lens, on the same side of the lens that the parallel rays are approaching on.

Rays from an object at finite distance are associated with a virtual image that is closer to the lens than the focal length, and on the same side of the lens as the object. The closer the object is to the lens, the closer the virtual image is to the lens.
Likewise, the magnification of a lens is given by
formula_12
where the negative sign is given, by convention, to indicate an upright object for positive values and an inverted object for negative values. Similar to mirrors, upright images produced by single lenses are virtual while inverted images are real.

Lenses suffer from aberrations that distort images and focal points. These are due to both to geometrical imperfections and due to the changing index of refraction for different wavelengths of light (chromatic aberration).

==Underlying mathematics==
As a mathematical study, geometrical optics emerges as a short-wavelength limit for solutions to hyperbolic partial differential equations (Sommerfeld–Runge method) or as a property of propagation of field discontinuities according to Maxwell&#x27;s equations (Luneburg method). In this short-wavelength limit, it is possible to approximate the solution locally by
formula_13
where formula_14 satisfy a dispersion relation, and the amplitude formula_15 varies slowly. More precisely, the leading order solution takes the form
formula_16
The phase formula_17 can be linearized to recover large wavenumber formula_18, and frequency formula_19. The amplitude formula_20 satisfies a transport equation. The small parameter formula_21 enters the scene due to highly oscillatory initial conditions. Thus, when initial conditions oscillate much faster than the coefficients of the differential equation, solutions will be highly oscillatory, and transported along rays. Assuming coefficients in the differential equation are smooth, the rays will be too. In other words, refraction does not take place. The motivation for this technique comes from studying the typical scenario of light propagation where short wavelength light travels along rays that minimize (more or less) its travel time. Its full application requires tools from microlocal analysis.

===Sommerfeld–Runge method===
The method of obtaining equations of geometrical optics by taking the limit of zero wavelength was first described by Arnold Sommerfeld and J. Runge in 1911. Their derivation was based on an oral remark by Peter Debye. Consider a monochromatic scalar field formula_22, where formula_23 could be any of the components of electric or magnetic field and hence the function formula_24 satisfy the wave equation
formula_25
where formula_26 with formula_27 being the speed of light in vacuum. Here, formula_28 is the refractive index of the medium. Without loss of generality, let us introduce formula_29 to convert the equation to
formula_30

Since the underlying principle of geometrical optics lies in the limit formula_31, the following asymptotic series is assumed,
formula_32

For large but finite value of formula_33, the series diverges, and one has to be careful in keeping only appropriate first few terms. For each value of formula_33, 
one can find an optimum number of terms to be kept and adding more terms than the optimum number might result in a poorer approximation. Substituting the series into the equation and collecting terms of different orders, one finds
formula_35
in general,
formula_36

The first equation is known as the eikonal equation, which determines the eikonal formula_37 is a Hamilton–Jacobi equation, written for example in Cartesian coordinates becomes
formula_38

The remaining equations determine the functions formula_39.

===Luneburg method===

The method of obtaining equations of geometrical optics by analysing surfaces of discontinuities of solutions to Maxwell&#x27;s equations was first described by Rudolf Karl Luneburg in 1944. It does not restrict the electromagnetic field to have a special form required by the Sommerfeld-Runge method which assumes the amplitude formula_40 and phase formula_37 satisfy the equation formula_42. This condition is satisfied by e.g. plane waves but is not additive.

The main conclusion of Luneburg&#x27;s approach is the following:

Theorem. Suppose the fields formula_43 and formula_44 (in a linear isotropic medium described by dielectric constants formula_45 and formula_46) have finite discontinuities along a (moving) surface in formula_47 described by the equation Then Maxwell&#x27;s equations in the integral form imply that formula_23 satisfies the eikonal equation:
formula_49
where formula_50 is the index of refraction of the medium (Gaussian units).

An example of such surface of discontinuity is the initial wave front emanating from a source that starts radiating at a certain instant of time.

The surfaces of field discontinuity thus become geometrical optics wave fronts with the corresponding geometrical optics fields defined as:
formula_51

Those fields obey transport equations consistent with the transport equations of the Sommerfeld-Runge approach. Light rays in Luneburg&#x27;s theory are defined as trajectories orthogonal to the discontinuity surfaces and can be shown to obey Fermat&#x27;s principle of least time thus establishing the identity of those rays with light rays of standard optics.

The above developments can be generalised to anisotropic media.

The proof of Luneburg&#x27;s theorem is based on investigating how Maxwell&#x27;s equations govern the propagation of discontinuities of solutions. The basic technical lemma is as follows:

A technical lemma. Let formula_52 be a hypersurface (a 3-dimensional manifold) in spacetime formula_53 on which one or more of: formula_43, formula_44, formula_45, formula_46, have a finite discontinuity. Then at each point of the hypersurface the following formulas hold:
formula_58
where the formula_59 operator acts in the formula_60-space (for every fixed formula_61) and the square brackets denote the difference in values on both sides of the discontinuity surface (set up according to an arbitrary but fixed convention, e.g. the gradient formula_62 pointing in the direction of the quantities being subtracted &quot;from&quot;).

Sketch of proof. Start with Maxwell&#x27;s equations away from the sources (Gaussian units):
formula_63

Using Stokes&#x27; theorem in formula_53 one can conclude from the first of the above equations that for any domain formula_65 in formula_53 with a piecewise smooth (3-dimensional) boundary formula_67 the following is true:
formula_68
where formula_69 is the projection of the outward unit normal formula_70 of formula_67 onto the 3D slice formula_72, and formula_73 is the volume 3-form on formula_67. Similarly, one establishes the following from the remaining Maxwell&#x27;s equations:
formula_75

Now by considering arbitrary small sub-surfaces formula_76 of formula_67 and setting up small neighbourhoods surrounding formula_76 in formula_53, and subtracting the above integrals accordingly, one obtains:
formula_80
where formula_81 denotes the gradient in the 4D formula_82-space. And since formula_76 is arbitrary, the integrands must be equal to 0 which proves the lemma.

It&#x27;s now easy to show that as they propagate through a continuous medium, the discontinuity surfaces obey the eikonal equation. Specifically, if formula_84 and formula_85 are continuous, then the discontinuities of formula_86 and formula_87 satisfy: formula_88 and formula_89. In this case the last two equations of the lemma can be written as:

formula_90

Taking the cross product of the second equation with formula_62 and substituting the first yields:
formula_92

The continuity of formula_85 and the second equation of the lemma imply: formula_94, hence, for points lying on the surface formula_95 &quot;only&quot;:
formula_96

(Notice the presence of the discontinuity is essential in this step as we&#x27;d be dividing by zero otherwise.)

Because of the physical considerations one can assume without loss of generality that formula_97 is of the following form:
formula_98, i.e. a 2D surface moving through space, modelled as level surfaces of formula_23. (Mathematically formula_23 exists if formula_101 by the implicit function theorem.)
The above equation written in terms of formula_23 becomes:
formula_103
i.e.,
formula_104
which is the eikonal equation and it holds for all formula_105, formula_106, formula_107, since the variable formula_61 is absent. Other laws of optics like Snell&#x27;s law and Fresnel formulae can be similarly obtained by considering discontinuities in formula_84 and formula_85.

===General equation using four-vector notation===
In four-vector notation used in special relativity, the wave equation can be written as
formula_111

and the substitution formula_112 leads to
formula_113

Therefore, the eikonal equation is given by
formula_114

Once eikonal is found by solving the above equation, the wave four-vector can be found from
formula_115

<text>Gamesmanship is the use of dubious (although not technically illegal) methods to win or gain a serious advantage in a game or sport. It has been described as &quot;Pushing the rules to the limit without getting caught, using whatever dubious methods possible to achieve the desired end&quot;. It may be inferred that the term derives from the idea of playing for the game (i.e. to win at any cost) as opposed to sportsmanship, which derives from the idea of playing for sport. The term was popularized by Stephen Potter&#x27;s humorous 1947 book, &quot;The Theory and Practice of Gamesmanship (or the Art of Winning Games without Actually Cheating)&quot;. It had, however, been used before by Ian Coster in his autobiographic book &quot;Friends in Aspic&quot;, published in 1939, where it was attributed to Francis Meynell.

==Alleged origins==
Potter cites the origin of gamesmanship to be a tennis match in which he and the philosopher C. E. M. Joad competed against two younger and fitter men who were outplaying them fairly comfortably. On returning a serve, Joad hit the ball straight into the back-netting behind the back-line. While the opponents were preparing for the next serve, Joad &quot;called across the net in an even tone: &#x27;Kindly say clearly, please, whether the ball was in or out. Being young, polite university students, their opponents offered to replay the point, but Joad declined. Because they were young and polite, the slight suggestion by Joad that their etiquette and sportsmanship were in question was extremely off-putting, and distracted them for the rest of the contest. Potter and Joad went on to win the match.

==Techniques==
Common techniques of gamesmanship include:
# Breaking the flow of an opponent&#x27;s play (Potter insisted &#x27;There is only one rule; BREAK THE FLOW.&#x27;)
# Causing an opponent to take the game less seriously or to overthink their position
# Intentionally making a &quot;mistake&quot; which gains an advantage over an opponent

While the first method is more common at higher levels of sports, the last two are more powerful in amateur games.

===Breaking the flow===
Examples of &quot;flow-breaking&quot; methods include:

* In darts, a player intentionally taking a long time to take their darts out of the dartboard.
* Feigning injury to delay the game, or reduce advertised ability. The skilled gamesman can counter this tactic by waiting until the game has been in play for some time, before revealing that they suffer from a far more serious condition, such as a heart defect.
* In billiards or snooker, intentionally standing in the opponent&#x27;s line of sight, and then suddenly moving when the opponent is about to shoot under the guise of getting out of their sight line. &quot;More or less at the last moment, leaping into the correct position with exaggerated agility, and stand rigidly with head bowed.&quot;
* Distracting the opposing player by complaining about other people who might be (but were not) distracting the opposing player. Potter, who always insisted that the good gamesman must give the appearance of being a good sportsman, recommended this approach. For example, if an opponent is about to take a shot at billiards, it is bad gamesmanship to fidget and whistle but good gamesmanship to distract him by loudly requesting silence from spectators: &#x27;Simulate annoyance, &quot;on the opponent&#x27;s behalf&quot;, with the onlookers&#x27;.
* When winning a point maintain direct eye contact with opponent, but when losing one always avoid direct eye contact.
* In cricket, coming out to bat with two right-handed gloves and then wasting time sorting out the problem.
*In baseball, a batter disrupting a pitcher&#x27;s flow by calling a time-out just before he delivers the pitch.
* When losing an outdoor game, feigning a deep, informed and more than amateur interest in e.g. botany or ornithology, in order to convey a breadth of interests and suggest to the opponent that losing is not of concern. This can cause the opponent to relax their attention, or at any rate rob them of the satisfaction of winning. Potter termed this &#x27;the &quot;natural hampette&quot;...See &quot;Gardens for Gamesmen&quot;, or &quot;When to be Fond of Flowers&quot;(15s.)&#x27;.
* In tennis, when serving, taking a long time between serves and making the receiver wait; or when receiving, getting into position in such a way that the server is distracted, or taking a medical time out when your opponent is experiencing a successful run.
* In rugby league:
** Taking too long to pack down in a scrum, thus wasting time;
** Taking too long to take to the field before a match or after half-time, thus forcing the opposition team to wait for a prolonged period before the match starts or resumes.
* In American football, calling a time out the instant before a game-winning or game-tying field goal or extra point to break the normal flow of play. This is known as &quot;icing&quot; or &quot;freezing&quot; the kicker.
* In sprint running events, taking too long to settle in the starting blocks, inducing other competitors to commit a false start.

===Causing the opponent to overthink===
Examples of methods designed to cause the opponent to overthink or to not take the game seriously enough include:

* Giving intentionally vague advice in the hope of making the opponent focus on their play. In such &quot;Advicemanship&quot;, &#x27;the advice &quot;must be vague&quot;, to make certain it is not helpful&#x27;, although Potter also noted that &#x27;according to some authorities the advice should be quite genuine and perfectly practical&#x27;.
* Asking one&#x27;s opponent&#x27;s advice for a (fictitious) match the following day, against an implied stronger opponent.
* Claiming that the game being played &quot;just isn&#x27;t my sport&quot;, or claiming less expertise than the player actually possesses (a mild form of hustling).
* The converse approach, suggesting a level of expertise far higher than the player actually possesses, can also be effective. For example, although gamesmanship frowns on simple distractions like whistling loudly while an opponent takes a shot, it is good gamesmanship to do so when taking a shot oneself, suggesting as it does a level of carefree detachment which the opponent does not possess.
* In American football, the very common practice of taking one or more timeouts to give an opposing kicker an excessive amount of time to think about a critical kick; most often a field goal or extra point but sometimes a potential on-side kick. The intent is to cause the kicker to get overly stressed about making a mistake and hopefully create a self-fulfilling prophecy. This is commonly referred to as &quot;icing the kicker.&quot; A common variant of this strategy is to attempt to call the timeout right before the ball is snapped, so that there is not enough time to stop the play and the opposing kicker has to attempt the same kick twice.
* &quot;Icing&quot; is also used, albeit less frequently, in basketball. In late-game situations with a player shooting free throws, it is not uncommon for the opposing team to take a timeout. This is commonly referred to as &quot;icing the shooter&quot;.

===Other===
*If the players personally know or have experience with each other, lies and other conversation topics can be used. In wrestling or many combat sports, it could be targeting a limb which the opponent has been carrying an injury.

===Intentional &quot;mistakes&quot;===
Examples of intentional &quot;mistakes&quot; designed to gain an advantage:

* In bridge, intentionally misdealing and then engaging in chaotic bidding, knowing that the hand will be void anyway, in the hope that &#x27;opponents will…be unable to form a working judgement of the opponents&#x27; bidding form&#x27;.
* In poker, intentionally raising out of turn, to induce players to give a free card.
* In baseball, intentionally dropping a caught ball, to create a force play on the baserunners (hence the infield fly rule).

All of the above are considered very close to cheating, and the abuser of gamesmanship techniques will find himself penalized in most serious sports and games tournaments, as well as being deemed (if caught) a &quot;bad sport&quot;.

The rules of the International Defensive Pistol Association for its practical shooting matches specifically state that any illegal action taken with the intent of gaining a competitive advantage is penalized as a &quot;Failure to Do Right&quot;, adding 20 seconds to the competitor&#x27;s time. This penalty is rarely given, partly because of its highly subjective nature.

== Association football ==
In association football, it is considered good sportsmanship to kick the ball out of play if a player on the opposing side is injured; when the ball is to be thrown in, it is also considered to be good sportsmanship in this situation to kick it (or throw it) back to the other team who had intentionally kicked it out. Gamesmanship arises in this situation when, rather than passing the ball back to the side who kicked the ball out, the injured player&#x27;s teammates keep the ball after the throw-in. Whilst not illegal or against the rules of the sport, it is heavily frowned upon.

A high-profile example occurred during the game between Portugal and the Netherlands in the round of 16 of the 2006 FIFA World Cup, where the game, already marred by numerous cautions and four red cards, further deteriorated because of such an incident. Also, in a 1998–99 FA Cup fifth round match between Arsenal and Sheffield United, Arsenal&#x27;s winning goal scored under these circumstances (although as a result of a misunderstanding rather than a deliberate action) was so contentious the Arsenal manager Arsène Wenger offered to replay the match. Sheffield United accepted, though Arsenal went on to win the second game by the same score, 2–1.

Feigning injury to cause the ball to be kicked out is another example of gamesmanship intended to break the flow of play, though if detected, it may be regarded as unsportsmanlike conduct, which is a breach of the laws and hence is no longer gamesmanship. In response to claims of feigned injuries during the 2006 World Cup, the Premier League asked players, managers and referees to end the custom as of the 2006–07 season, instead preferring a referee alone to determine whether a break in play is needed.

When a free kick is awarded, members of the defending team will often pick up the ball and drop it back behind them as they retreat. Whilst not throwing the ball away, which would be an infringement, the purpose is to prevent a swiftly taken free kick.

Some goalkeepers are known to use gamesmanship in an attempt to gain an advantage on penalty kicks. This was particularly notable in the 2022 World Cup final, where Argentine goalkeeper Emi Martinez employed gamesmanship while French goalkeeper Hugo Lloris did not, the latter later stating &quot;There are some things I can&#x27;t do... rattling my opponents, crossing that line... I&#x27;m too rational and honest a man to go that way.&quot;

==Usage outside of games==
The term &quot;gamesmanship&quot; is also used for similar techniques used in non-game situations, such as negotiations and elections.

Each form is frequently used as a means of describing dubious methods of winning and/or psychological tricks used to intimidate or confuse one&#x27;s opponent. Technically speaking, these tactics are one-upmanship, defined in a later book by Potter as the art of being one-up on somebody else.

The term also appears in art theory to mean playfulness, as in &quot;literary gamesmanship&quot;.

==The gamesman versus the pure player==

Potter&#x27;s double-edged ironies did not spare the gamesman himself (he slyly named one prominent protagonist &#x27;Bzo, U., holder (1947) Yugo-Slav Gamesmanship Championship&#x27;, for example). Potter acknowledged repeatedly that &quot;the way of the gamesman is hard, his training strict, his progress slow, his disappointments many&quot;, and recognised that as a result &quot;the assiduous student of gamesmanship has little time for the &quot;minutiae&quot; of the game itself – little opportunity for learning how to play the shots, for instance&quot;. Yet one of his &quot;correspondents&quot; owlishly admits, &quot;there is no doubt that a knowledge of the game itself sometimes helps the gamesman&quot;.

Hence &quot;perhaps the most difficult type for the gamesman to play is the man who indulges in pure play. He gets down to it, he gets on with it, he plays each shot according to its merits, and his own powers, without a trace of exhibitionism, and no by-play whatever&quot;. The book gloomily concludes, &quot;we amateurs have to fight against the growing menace of young people who insist on playing their various games for the fun of the thing...indulging rather too freely, if the truth were known, in pure play&quot;.

<text>Cilappatikāram (IPA: ʧiləppət̪ikɑːrəm, &quot;lit.&quot; &quot;the Tale of an Anklet&quot;), also referred to as Silappathikaram or Silappatikaram, is the earliest Tamil epic. It is a poem of 5,730 lines in almost entirely &quot;akaval&quot; (&quot;aciriyam&quot;) meter. The epic is a tragic love story of an ordinary couple, Kaṇṇaki and her husband Kōvalaṉ. The &quot;Cilappatikāram&quot; has more ancient roots in the Tamil bardic tradition, as Kannaki and other characters of the story are mentioned or alluded to in the Sangam literature such as in the &quot;Naṟṟiṇai&quot; and later texts such as the &quot;Kovalam Katai&quot;. It is attributed to a prince-turned-jain-monk Iḷaṅkō Aṭikaḷ, and was probably composed in the 2nd century CE. 

The &quot;Cilappatikāram&quot; is an ancient literary masterpiece. It is to the Tamil culture what the &quot;Iliad&quot; is to the Greek culture, states R. Parthasarathy. It blends the themes, mythologies and theological values found in the Jain, Buddhist and Hindu religious traditions. It is a Tamil story of love and rejection, happiness and pain, good and evil like all classic epics of the world. Yet unlike other epics that deal with kings and armies caught up with universal questions and existential wars, the &quot;Cilappatikāram&quot; is an epic about an ordinary couple caught up with universal questions and internal, emotional war. The &quot;Cilappatikaram&quot; legend has been a part of the Tamil oral tradition. The palm-leaf manuscripts of the original epic poem, along with those of the Sangam literature, were rediscovered in monasteries in the second half of the 19th century by UV Swaminatha Aiyar – a pandit and Tamil scholar. After being preserved and copied in temples and monasteries in the form of palm-leaf manuscripts, Aiyar published its first partial edition on paper in 1872, the full edition in 1892. Since then the epic poem has been translated into many languages including English.

==Plot==
The &quot;Cilappatikāram&quot; is set in a flourishing seaport city of the early Chola kingdom. Kaṇṇaki and Kōvalaṉ are a newly married couple, in love, and living in bliss. Over time, Kōvalaṉ meets Mātavi (Mādhavi) – a courtesan. He falls for her, leaves Kaṇṇaki and moves in with Mātavi. He spends lavishly on her. Kaṇṇaki is heartbroken, but as the chaste woman, she waits despite her husband&#x27;s unfaithfulness. During the festival for Indra, the rain god, there is a singing competition. Kōvalaṉ sings a poem about a woman who hurt her lover. Mātavi then sings a song about a man who betrayed his lover. Each interprets the song as a message to the other. Kōvalaṉ feels Mātavi is unfaithful to him and leaves her. Kaṇṇaki is still waiting for him. She takes him back.
Kannagi and Kōvalaṉ leave the city and travel to Madurai, the capital of the Pandya kingdom. Kōvalaṉ is penniless and destitute. He confesses his deceit to Kannagi. She forgives him and tells him the hurt his adultery caused her. Then she encourages her husband to rebuild their life together and gives him one of her jeweled anklets to sell to raise starting capital. Kōvalaṉ sells it to a merchant, but the merchant falsely frames him as having stolen the anklet from the queen. The king arrests Kōvalaṉ and then executes him, without the due checks and processes of justice. When Kōvalaṉ does not return home, Kannagi goes searching for him. She learns what has happened. She protests the injustice and then proves Kōvalaṉ&#x27;s innocence by throwing in the court the other jeweled anklet of the pair. The king accepts his folly. Kannagi curses the king and the people of Madurai, tearing off her breast and throwing it at the gathered public. The king dies. The society that had made her suffer, suffers in retribution as the city of Madurai is burnt to the ground because of her curse.

In the third section of the epic, gods and goddesses meet Kannagi at Cheranadu and she goes to heaven with the god Indra. The King Cheran Chenkuttuvan and royal family of the Chera kingdom (Today Kerala) learn about her and resolve to build a temple with Kannagi as the featured goddess. They go to the Himalayas, bring a stone, carve her image, call her goddess &quot;Pattini&quot;, dedicate a temple, order daily prayers, and perform a royal sacrifice.

== Nomenclature ==
According to V R Ramachandra Dikshitar, the title &quot;Silappatikāram&quot; – also spelled &quot;Silappadikaram&quot; – is a combination of two words, &quot;silambu&quot; (anklet) and &quot;adikaram&quot; (the story about). It therefore connotes a &quot;story that centers around an anklet&quot;. The content and context around that center is elaborate, with Atiyarkkunallar describing it as an epic story told with poetry, music, and drama.

== Author==

The Tamil tradition attributes &quot;Cilappatikaram&quot; to the Iḷaṅkō Aṭikaḷ (&quot;the venerable ascetic prince&quot;), also spelled Ilango Adigal. He is reputed to have been a Jain Monk and the brother of Chera king Chenkuttuvan, whose family and rule are described in the Fifth Ten of the &quot;Patiṟṟuppattu&quot;, a poem of the Sangam literature. In it or elsewhere, however, there is no evidence that the famous king had a brother. V. Kanakasabhai opined that Ilango was a monk of a nirgrantha sect of Jain. The Sangam poems never mention Ilango Adigal, the epic or the name of any other author for the epic. The Ilango Adigal name appears in a much later dated &quot;patikam&quot; (prologue) attached to the poem, and the authenticity of this attribution is doubtful. According to Gananath Obeyesekere, the story of the purported &quot;Cilappadikaram&quot; author Ilango Adigal as the brother of a famous Chera king &quot;must be later interpolations&quot;, something that was a characteristic feature of early literature.

The mythical third section about gods meeting Kannaki after Kovalan&#x27;s death, in the last Canto, mentions a legend about a prince turned into a monk. This has been conflated as the story of the attributed author as a witness. However, little factual details about the real author(s) or evidence exist. Given the fact that older Tamil texts mention and allude to the Kannaki&#x27;s tragic love story, states Parthasarathy, the author was possibly just a redactor of the oral tradition and the epic poem was not a product of his creative genius. The author was possibly a Jaina scholar, as in several parts of the epic, the key characters of the epic meet a Jaina monk or nun. The epic&#x27;s praise of the Vedas, Brahmins, inclusion of temples, Hindu gods and goddesses and ritual worship give the text a cosmopolitan character, and to some scholars&#x27; evidence to propose that author was not necessarily a Jaina ascetic.

According to Ramachandra Dikshitar, the ascetic-prince legend about Ilango Adigal as included in the last canto of &quot;Cilappadikaram&quot; is odd. In the epic, Ilango Adigal attends a Vedic sacrifice with the Chera king Cenkuttuvan after the king brings back the Himalayan stone to make a statue of Kannaki. If the author Ilango Adigal was a Jain ascetic and given our understanding of Jainism&#x27;s historic view on the Vedas and Vedic sacrifices, why would he attend a function like the Vedic sacrifice, states Ramachandra Dikshitar. This, and the fact that the epic comfortably praises Shaiva and Vaishnava lifestyle, festivals, gods and goddesses, has led some scholars to propose that author of this epic was a Hindu.

Ilango Adigal has been suggested to be a contemporary of Sattanar, the author of &quot;Maṇimēkalai&quot;. However, evidence for such suggestions has been lacking.

==Date==
In the modern era, some Tamil scholars have linked the Ilango Adigal legend about he is being the brother of king Cenkuttuvan, as a means to date this text. A Chera king Cenkuttuvan is tentatively placed in the 100–250 CE, and the traditionalists, therefore, place the text to the same period. In 1939, for example, the Tamil literature scholar Ramachandra Dikshitar presented a number of events mentioned within the text and thereby derived that the text was composed about 171 CE. According to Dhandayudham, the epic should be dated to between the 3rd and 5th century. Ramachandra Dikshitar analysis that the epic was composed before the Pallava dynasty emerged as a major power in the 6th-century is accepted by most scholars, because there is no mention of the highly influential Pallavas in the epic. His chronological estimate of 171 CE for &quot;Cilappadikaram&quot; cannot be far from the real date of composition, states Alain Daniélou – a French Indologist who translated the &quot;Cilappadikaram&quot; in 1965. Daniélou states that the epic – along with the other four Tamil epics – were all composed sometime between the last part of the Sangam and the subsequent centuries, that is &quot;3rd to 7th-century&quot;.

Other scholars, such as Kamil Zvelebil – a Tamil literature and history scholar, state that the legends in the epic itself are a weak foundation for dating the text. A stronger foundation is the linguistics, events and other sociological details in the text when compared to those in other Tamil literature, new words and grammatical forms, and the number of non-Tamil loan words in the text. The Sangam era texts of the 100–250 CE period are strikingly different in style, language structure, the beliefs, the ideologies, and the customs portrayed in the &quot;Cilappatikāram&quot;, which makes the early dating implausible. Further, the epic&#x27;s style, structure and other details are quite similar to the texts composed centuries later. These point to a much later date. According to Zvelebil, the &quot;Cilappatikāram&quot; that has survived into the modern era &quot;cannot have been composed before the 5th- to 6th-century&quot;.

According to other scholars, such as Iyengar, the first two sections of the epic were likely the original epic, and third mythical section after the destruction of Madurai is likely a later extrapolation, an addendum that introduces a mix of Jaina, Hindu and Buddhist stories and practices, including the legend about the ascetic prince. The hero (Kōvalaṉ) is long dead, and the heroine (Kaṇṇaki) follows him shortly thereafter into heaven, as represented in the early verses of the third section. This part adds nothing to the story, is independent, is likely to be of a much later century.

Other scholars, including Zvelebil, state that this need not necessarily be so. The third section covers the third of three major kingdoms of the ancient Tamil region, the first section covered the Cholas and the second the Pandya. Further, states Zvelebil, the deification of Kaṇṇaki keeps her theme active and is consistent with the Tamil and the Indian tradition of merging a legend into its ideas of rebirth and endless existence. The language, and style of the third section is &quot;perfectly homogeneous&quot; with the first two, it does not seem to be the work of multiple authors, and therefore the entire epic should be considered a complete masterpiece. Fred Hardy, in contrast, states that some sections have clearly and cleverly been interpolated into the main epic, and these additions may be of 7th- to 8th century. Daniélou concurs that the epic may have been &quot;slightly&quot; reshaped and enlarged in the centuries after the original epic was composed, but the epic as it has survived into the modern age is quite homogeneous and lacks evidence of additions by multiple authors.

Iravatham Mahadevan states that the mention of a weekday (Friday) in the text and the negative portrayal of a Pandya king narrows the probable date of composition to between 450 and 550 CE. This is because the concept of weekdays did not exist in India until the 5th century CE, and the Pandya dynasty only regained power in 550 CE, thus meaning that Jains could freely criticise them without any threat to their lives.

==Contents==
===Structure of &quot;Cilappatikaram&quot;===
The &quot;Cilappatikaram&quot; is divided into three &quot;kantams&quot; (book, Skt: &quot;khanda&quot;), which are further subdivided into &quot;katais&quot; (cantos, Skt: &quot;katha&quot;). The three &quot;kantams&quot; are named after the capitals of the three major early Tamil kingdoms:

* &quot;Pugarkkandam&quot; (,), based in the Chola capital of Pugar (Kaveripoompattinam, where river Kaveri meets the Bay of Bengal). This book is where Kannagi and Kovalan start their married life and Kovalan leaves his wife for the courtesan Madhavi. This contains 9 cantos or divisions. The first book is largely &quot;akam&quot; (erotic love) genre.
* &quot;Maturaikkandam&quot; (,), based in Madurai which then was the capital of the Pandya kingdom. This book is where the stories about the couple are told after leaving Puhar and as they try to rebuild their lives. This is also where Kovalan is unjustly executed after being falsely framed for stealing the queen&#x27;s anklet. This book ends with the apotheosis of Kannaki, as gods and goddesses meet her and she herself is revealed as a goddess. The second book contains 11 cantos and belongs to the &quot;puranam&quot; (mythic) genre of Tamil literature, states Parthasarathy.
* &quot;Vanchikkandam&quot; (, ), based in the capital of Chera country, Vanci. The third book begins after Kannaki has ascended to the heavens in the chariot of Indra. The epic tells the legends around the Chera king, queen and army resolving to build a temple for her as goddess Pattini. It contains the Chera journey to the Himalayas, the battles along the way and finally the successful completion of the temple for Kannaki&#x27;s worship. This book contains 5 cantos. The book is the &quot;puram&quot; (heroic) genre.

The &quot;katais&quot; range between 53 and 272 lines each. In addition to the 25 cantos, the epic has 5 song cycles:
*The love songs of the seaside grove
*The song and dance of the hunters
*The round dance of the herdswomen
*The round dance of the hill dwellers
*The benediction

===Main characters===

* Kannaki – the heroine and central character of the epic; she is the simple, quiet, patient and faithful housewife fully dedicated to her unfaithful husband in book 1; who transforms into a passionate, heroic, rage-driven revenge seeker of injustice in book 2; then becomes a goddess that inspires Chera people to build her temple, invade, fight wars to get a stone from the Himalaya, make a statue of Kannaki and begin the worship of goddess Pattini. Lines 1.27–29 of the epic introduces her with allusions to the Vedic mythology of Samudra Manthana, as, &quot;She is Lakshmi herself, goddess of peerless beauty that rose from the lotus, and chaste as the immaculate Arundhati&quot;.
* Kovalan - husband of Kannaki, son of a wealthy charitable kind merchant in the seaport capital city of early Chola kingdom at Poompuhar; Kovalan inherits his wealth, is handsome, and the women of the city want him. The epic introduces him in lines 1.38–41 with &quot;Seasoned by music, with faces luminous as the moon, women confided among themselves: &quot;He [Kovalan] is the god of love himself, the incomparable Murukan&quot;. His parents and Kannaki&#x27;s parents meet and arrange their marriage, and the two are married in Canto 1 of the epic around the ceremonial fire with a priest completing the holy wedding rites. For a few years, Kannaki and he live a blissful householder&#x27;s life together. The epic alludes to this first phase of life as (lines 2.112–117), &quot;Like snakes coupled in the heat of passion, or Kama and Rati smothered in each other&#x27;s arms, so Kovalan and Kannakai lived in happiness past speaking, spent themselves in every pleasure, thinking: we live on earth but a few days&quot;, according to R Parthasarathy&#x27;s translation.
* Madhavi - A young, beautiful courtesan dancer; the epic introduces her in Canto 3 and describes her as descended from the line of Urvasi – the celestial dancer in the court of Indra. She studied folk and classical dances for seven years from the best teachers of the Chola kingdom, perfecting the postures and rhythmic dancing to all musical instruments and revered songs. She is spellbinding on stage and wins the highest award for her dance performance: a garland made of 1,008 gold leaves and flowers.
* Vasavadaththai - Madhavi&#x27;s female friend
* Kosigan - Madhavi&#x27;s messenger to Kovalan
* Madalan - A Brahmin visitor to Madurai from Poomphuhar (Book 2)
* Kavunthi Adigal - A Jain nun (Book 2)
* Netunceliyan I - Pandya king (Book 2)
* Kopperundevi - Pandya Queen (Book 2)
* Indra – the god who brings Kannaki to Heaven (Book 3)
* Senguttuvan - Chera king who invades and defeats all Deccan and north Indian kingdoms to bring a stone from the Himalayas for a temple dedicated to Kannaki (Book 3)

===Story===
;Book 1
The &quot;Cilappatikaram&quot; is set in a flourishing seaport city of the early Chola kingdom. Kannaki and Kovalan are a newly married couple, in love, and living in bliss. Over time, Kovalan meets Matavi (Madhavi) – a courtesan. He falls for her, leaves Kannaki and moves in with Matavi. He spends lavishly on her. Kannaki is heartbroken, but as the chaste woman, she waits despite her husband&#x27;s unfaithfulness. During the festival for Indra, the rain god, there is a singing competition. Kovalan sings a poem about a woman who hurt her lover. Matavi then sings a song about a man who betrayed his lover. Each interprets the song as a message to the other. Kovalan feels Matavi is unfaithful to him and leaves her. Kannaki is still waiting for him. She takes him back.

;Book 2
Kannaki and Kovalan leave the city and travel to Madurai of the Pandya kingdom. Kovalan is penniless and destitute. He confesses his mistakes to Kannaki. She forgives him and tells him the pain his unfaithfulness gave her. Then she encourages her husband to rebuild their life together and gives him one of her jeweled anklets to sell to raise starting capital. Kovalan sells it to a merchant, but the merchant falsely frames him as having stolen the anklet from the queen. The king arrests Kovalan and then executes him, without the due checks and processes of justice. When Kovalan does not return home, Kannaki goes searching for him. She learns what has happened. She protests the injustice and then proves Kovalan&#x27;s innocence by throwing in the court the other jeweled anklet of the pair. The king accepts his mistake. Kannaki curses the king and curses the people of Madurai, tearing off her breast and throwing it at the gathered public, triggering the flames of a citywide inferno. The remorseful king dies in shock. Madurai is burnt to the ground because of her curse. The violence of the Kannaki fire kills everyone, except &quot;only Brahmins, good men, cows, truthful women, cripples, old men and children&quot;, states Zvelebil.

;Book 3
Kannaki leaves Madurai and heads into the mountainous region of the Chera kingdom. Gods and goddesses meet Kannaki, the king of gods Indra himself comes with his chariot, and Kannaki goes to heaven with Indra. The royal family of the Chera kingdom learns about her, resolves to build a temple with Kannaki as the featured goddess. They go to the Himalayas, bring a stone, carve her image, call her goddess &quot;Pattini&quot;, dedicate a temple, order daily prayers, and perform a royal sacrifice.

==Literary value and significance==
The manuscripts of the epic include a prologue called &quot;patikam&quot;. This is likely a later addition to the older epic. It, nevertheless, shows the literary value of the epic to later Tamil generations:
Twenty-five cantos of the Cilappatikaram are set in the akaval meter, a meter found in the more ancient Tamil Sangam literature. It has verses in other meters and contains five songs also in a different meter. These features suggest that the epic was performed in the form of stage drama that mixed recitation of cantos with the singing of songs. The 30 cantos were reciting as monologues.

===Sanskrit epics===


The Tamil epic has many references and allusions to the Sanskrit epics and puranic legends. For example, it describes the fate of Poompuhar suffering the same agony as experienced by Ayodhya when Rama leaves for exile to the forest as instructed by his father. The &quot;Aycciyarkuravai&quot; section (canto 27), makes mention of the Lord who could measure the three worlds, going to the forest with his brother, waging a war against Lanka and destroying it with fire. These references indicate that the &quot;Ramayana&quot; was known to the &quot;Cilappatikaram&quot; audience many centuries before the Kamba Ramayanam of the 12th century CE.

The 17th cannot of the epic explains the Beauty and greatness of Lord Vishnu with respect to his forms and Various incarnations. Vishnu was the deity most mentioned in Tamil Sangam literature and is said to be one of the favourite gods of the people who lived in the Sangam time. The epic states that &quot;Vain are the ears which do not hear the glory of Rama who is Vishnu, Vain are the eyes which do not see the dark hued Lord, the great God, the Mayavan Vishnu, Vain is the tongue that will not praise him who triumphed over the deceit of the foolish schemer Kamsa (Krishna), Vain is the tongue which does not say ‘Narayana’.

According to Zvelebil, the &quot;Cilappatikaram&quot; mentions the &quot;Mahabharata&quot; and calls it the &quot;great war&quot;, just like the story was familiar to the Sangam era poets too as evidenced in Puram 2 and Akam 233. One of the poets is nicknamed as &quot;The Peruntevanar who sang the Bharatam [Mahabharatam]&quot;, once again confirming that the Tamil poets by the time &quot;Cilappatikaram&quot; was composed were intimately aware of the Sanskrit epics, the literary structure and significance of &quot;Mahakavyas&quot; genre. To be recognized as an accomplished extraordinary poet, one must compose a great &quot;kavya&quot; has been the Tamil scholarly opinion prior to the modern era, states Zvelebil. These were popular and episodes from such &quot;maha-kavya&quot; were performed as a form of dance-drama in public. The &quot;Cilappatikaram&quot; is a Tamil epic that belongs to the pan-India &quot;kavya&quot; epic tradition. The Tamil tradition and medieval commentators such as Mayilaintar have included the &quot;Cilappatikaram&quot; as one of the &quot;aimperunkappiyankal&quot;, which literally means &quot;five great kavyas&quot;.

According to D. Dennis Hudson – a World Religions and Tamil literature scholar, the &quot;Cilappatikaram&quot; is the earliest and first complete Tamil reference to Pillai (Nila, Nappinnai, Radha), who is described in the epic as the cowherd lover of Krishna. The epic includes abundant stories and allusions to Krishna and his stories, which are also found in ancient Sanskrit Puranas. In the canto where Kannaki is waiting for Kovalan to return after selling her anklet to a Madurai merchant, she is in a village with cowgirls. These cowherd girls enact a dance, where one plays Mayavan (Krishna), another girl plays Tammunon (Balarama), while a third plays Pinnai (Radha). The dance begins with a song listing Krishna&#x27;s heroic deeds and his fondness for Radha, then they dance where sage Narada plays music. Such scenes where cowgirls imitate Krishna&#x27;s life story are also found in Sanskrit poems of &quot;Harivamsa&quot; and &quot;Vishnu Purana&quot;, both generally dated to be older than &quot;Cilappatikaram&quot;. The Tamil epic calls portions of it as &quot;vāla caritai nāṭaṅkaḷ&quot;, which mirrors the phrase &quot;balacarita nataka&quot; – dramas about the story of the child [Krishna]&quot; – in the more ancient Sanskrit &quot;kavyas&quot;. According to the Indologist Friedhelm Hardy, this canto and others in the Tamil epic reflect a culture where &quot;Dravidian, Tamil, Sanskrit, Brahmin, Buddhist, Jain and many other influences&quot; had already fused into a composite whole in the South Indian social consciousness.

According to Zvelebil, the &quot;Cilappadikaram&quot; is the &quot;first literary expression and the first ripe fruit of the Aryan-Dravidian synthesis in Tamilnadu&quot;.

===Tamil nationalism===
In early 20th-century, the &quot;Cilappadikaram&quot; became a rallying basis for some Tamil nationalists based in Sri Lanka and colonial-era Madras Presidency. The epic is considered as the &quot;first consciously national work&quot; and evidence of the fact that the &quot;Tamils had by that time [mid 1st-millennium CE] attained nationhood&quot;, or the first expression of a sense of Tamil cultural integrity and Tamil dominance. This view is shared by some modernist Tamil playwrights, movie makers, and politicians. According to Norman Cutler, this theme runs in recent works such as the 1962 re-rendering of the &quot;Cilappadikaram&quot; into &quot;Kannakip Puratcikkappiyam&quot; by Paratitacan, and the 1967 play &quot;Cilappatikaram: Natakak Kappiyam&quot; by M. Karunanidhi – an influential politician and a former Chief Minister behind the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam and Dravidian movement. These versions, some by avowed atheists, have retold the &quot;Cilappadikaram&quot; epic &quot;to propagate their ideas of [Tamil] cultural identity&quot;, along with a hostility to &quot;the North, the racially different Aryans, the Brahmins&quot;, and the so-called &quot;alien culture&quot;, according to Prabha Rani and Vaidyanathan Shivkumar.

The Tamil nationalistic inspiration derived from the &quot;Cilappadikaram&quot; is a selective reading and appropriation of the great epic, according to Cutler. It cherrypicks and brackets some rhetorical and ideological elements from the epic but ignores the rest that make the epic into a complete masterpiece. In the third book of the epic, the Tamil king Cenkuttuvan defeats his fellow Tamil kings and then invades and conquers the Deccan and the north Indian kingdoms. Yet, states Cutler, the same book places an &quot;undeniable prestige&quot; for a &quot;rock from the Himalayas&quot;, the &quot;river Ganges&quot; and other symbols from the north to honor Kannaki. Similarly, the Pandyan and the Chera king in various &quot;katais&quot;, as well as the three key characters of the epic (Kannaki, Kovalan and Madhavi) in other &quot;katais&quot; of the &quot;Cilappadikaram&quot; pray in Hindu temples dedicated to Shiva, Murugan, Vishnu, Krishna, Balarama, Indra, Korravai (Parvati), Saraswati, Lakshmi, and others. The Tamil kings are described in the epic as performing Vedic sacrifices and rituals, where Agni and Varuna are invoked, and the Vedas are chanted. These and numerous other details in the epic were neither of Dravidian roots nor icons, rather they reflect an acceptance of and reverence for certain shared pan-Indian cultural rituals, symbols and values, what Himalayas and Ganges signify to the Indic culture. The epic rhetorically does present a vision of a Tamil imperium, yet it also &quot;emphatically is not exclusively Tamil&quot;, states Cutler.

According to V R Ramachandra Dikshitar, the epic provides no evidence of sectarian conflict between the Indian religious traditions. In &quot;Cilappadikaram&quot;, the key characters pray and participate in both Shaiva and Vaishnava rituals, temples and festivals. In addition, they give help and get help from the Jains and the Ajivikas. There are Buddhist references too in the &quot;Cilappadikaram&quot; such as about Mahabodhi, but these are very few – unlike the other Tamil epic &quot;Maṇimēkalai&quot;. Yet, all these references are embedded in a cordial community, where all share the same ideas and belief in &quot;karma&quot; and related premises. The major festivals described in the epic are pan-Indian and these festivals are also found in ancient Sanskrit literature.

==Preservation==
U. V. Swaminatha Iyer (1855-1942 CE), a Shaiva Hindu and Tamil scholar, rediscovered palm-leaf manuscripts of the poem, along with those of the Sangam literature, in Hindu monasteries near Kumbakonam. These manuscripts were preserved and copied in temples and monasteries over the centuries, as palm-leaf manuscripts degrade in the tropical climate. This rediscovery in the second half of the 19th-century and the consequent publication brought &quot;Cilappatikaram &quot; to readers and scholars outside the temples. This helped trigger an interest in ancient Tamil literature. Aiyar published its first partial edition in 1872, the full edition in 1892. Since then, the epic poem has been translated into many languages.

S Ramanathan (1917-1988 CE) has published articles on the musical aspects of the &quot;Silappadikaram&quot;.

==Reception==
To some critics, &quot;Maṇimēkalai&quot; is more interesting than &quot;Cilappadikaram&quot;, but in terms of literary evaluation, it seems inferior. According to Panicker, there are effusions in &quot;Cilappadikaram&quot; in the form of a song or a dance, which does not go well with western audience as they are assessed to be inspired on the spur of the moment. According to a Calcutta review, the three-epic works on a whole have no plot and no characterization to qualify for an epic genre.

A review by George L. Hart, a professor of Tamil language at the University of California, Berkeley, &quot;the Silappatikaram is to Tamil what the Iliad and Odyssey are to Greek — its importance would be difficult to overstate.&quot;

==Translations==
The first English translation of &quot;Cilappadikaram&quot; was published in 1939 by V R Ramachandra Dikshitar (Oxford University Press). In 1965, an English translation of the epic was published by Alain Daniélou. R. Parthasarathy&#x27;s English translation was published in 1993 by Columbia University Press and reprinted in 2004 by Penguin Books. Paula Saffire of Butler University state that Parthasarathy&#x27;s translation is &quot;indispensable&quot; and more suited for scholarly studies due to its accuracy, while Daniélou&#x27;s translation was more suited to those seeking the epic&#x27;s spirit and an easier to enjoy poem.

The Parthasarathy translation won the 1996 A.K. Ramanujan Book Prize for Translation.

The epic has been translated into French by the same Alain Daniélou and RN Desikan in 1961 (before his English translation), into Czech by Kamil Zvelebil in 1965, and into Russian by JJ Glazov in 1966.

===Rewritings===
Veteran Tamil writer Jeyamohan rewrote the whole epic into a novel as Kotravai in 2005. The novel having adapted the original plot and characters, it revolves around the ancient South Indian traditions, also trying to fill the gaps in the history using multiple narratives. H. S. Shivaprakash a leading poet and playwright in Kannada has also re-narrated a part from the epic namely &quot;Madurekanda&quot;. It has also been re-narrated in Hindi by famous Hindi writer Amritlal Nagar in his novel Suhag Ke Nupur which was published in 1960. He had also written a 1.25-hour radio-play on the story which was broadcast on Aakashvani in 1952.

==In popular culture==
There have been multiple movies based on the story of Cilappathikaram and the most famous is the portrayal of Kannagi by actress Kannamba in the 1942 movie Kannagi. P. U. Chinnappa played the lead as Kovalan. The movie faithfully follows the story of Cilappathikaram and was a hit when it was released. The movie Poompuhar, penned by M. Karunanidhi is also based on Cilapathikaram. There are multiple dance dramas as well by some of the great exponents of Bharatanatyam in Tamil as most of the verses of Cilappathikaram can be set to music.

Cilappatikaram also occupies much of the screen time in the 15th and 16th episodes of the television series Bharat Ek Khoj. Pallavi Joshi played the role of Kannagi and Rakesh Dhar played that of Kovalan.

<text>The Open Court Publishing Company is a publisher with offices in Chicago and LaSalle, Illinois. It is part of the Carus Publishing Company of Peru, Illinois.

==History==
Open Court was founded in 1887 by Edward C. Hegeler of the Matthiessen-Hegeler Zinc Company, at one time the largest producer of zinc in the United States. Hegeler intended for the firm to serve the purpose of discussing religious and psychological problems on the principle that the scientific world-conception should be applied to religion. Its first managing editor was Paul Carus, Hegeler&#x27;s son-in-law through his marriage to engineer Mary Hegeler Carus. For the first 80 years of its existence, the company had its offices in the Hegeler Carus Mansion.

Open Court specializes in philosophy, science, and religion. It was one of the first academic presses in the country, as well as one of the first publishers of inexpensive editions of the classics. It also published the journals &quot;Open Court&quot; and &quot;The Monist&quot;— the latter is still being published. The Open Court Monthly Magazine&#x27;s motto was &quot;Devoted to the Science of Religion, the Religion of Science, and the Extension of the Religious Parliament Idea.&quot;

==&quot;The Open Court&quot;==
The &quot;Open Court&quot; journal was founded in February 1887 as the official publication of the Free Religious Association. By the end of 1887, its editor Benjamin F. Underwood resigned and Paul Carus became editor. The Open Court Publishing Company published &quot;The Open Court&quot; journal until 1936. Carus edited the journal for 32 years, until his death.

==&quot;Popular Culture &amp; Philosophy&quot; series==

One of Open Court Publishing&#x27;s best-selling series is its semi-annual &quot;Popular Culture &amp; Philosophy&quot; series, under the editorship of George Reisch. Volumes on the philosophy underpinning such television shows as &quot;Star Trek&quot;, &quot;Seinfeld&quot;, &quot;The Simpsons,&quot; and &quot;Buffy the Vampire Slayer&quot; propelled the series into the limelight.

<text>Cloud physics is the study of the physical processes that lead to the formation, growth and precipitation of atmospheric clouds. These aerosols are found in the troposphere, stratosphere, and mesosphere, which collectively make up the greatest part of the homosphere. Clouds consist of microscopic droplets of liquid water (warm clouds), tiny crystals of ice (cold clouds), or both (mixed phase clouds), along with microscopic particles of dust, smoke, or other matter, known as condensation nuclei. Cloud droplets initially form by the condensation of water vapor onto condensation nuclei when the supersaturation of air exceeds a critical value according to Köhler theory. Cloud condensation nuclei are necessary for cloud droplets formation because of the Kelvin effect, which describes the change in saturation vapor pressure due to a curved surface. At small radii, the amount of supersaturation needed for condensation to occur is so large, that it does not happen naturally. Raoult&#x27;s law describes how the vapor pressure is dependent on the amount of solute in a solution. At high concentrations, when the cloud droplets are small, the supersaturation required is smaller than without the presence of a nucleus.

In warm clouds, larger cloud droplets fall at a higher terminal velocity; because at a given velocity, the drag force per unit of droplet weight on smaller droplets is larger than on large droplets. The large droplets can then collide with small droplets and combine to form even larger drops. When the drops become large enough that their downward velocity (relative to the surrounding air) is greater than the upward velocity (relative to the ground) of the surrounding air, the drops can fall as precipitation. The collision and coalescence is not as important in mixed phase clouds where the Bergeron process dominates. Other important processes that form precipitation are riming, when a supercooled liquid drop collides with a solid snowflake, and aggregation, when two solid snowflakes collide and combine. The precise mechanics of how a cloud forms and grows is not completely understood, but scientists have developed theories explaining the structure of clouds by studying the microphysics of individual droplets. Advances in weather radar and satellite technology have also allowed the precise study of clouds on a large scale.

== History of cloud physics ==

The modern cloud physics began in the 19th century and was described in several publications. Otto von Guericke originated the idea that clouds were composed of water bubbles. In 1847 Augustus Waller used spider web to examine droplets under the microscope. These observations were confirmed by William Henry Dines in 1880 and Richard Assmann in 1884.

== Cloud formation ==

=== Cooling air to its dew point ===


====Adiabatic cooling====
As water evaporates from an area of Earth&#x27;s surface, the air over that area becomes moist. Moist air is lighter than the surrounding dry air, creating an unstable situation. When enough moist air has accumulated, all the moist air rises as a single packet, without mixing with the surrounding air. As more moist air forms along the surface, the process repeats, resulting in a series of discrete packets of moist air rising to form clouds.

This process occurs when one or more of three possible lifting agents—cyclonic/frontal, convective, or orographic—causes air containing invisible water vapor to rise and cool to its dew point, the temperature at which the air becomes saturated. The main mechanism behind this process is adiabatic cooling. Atmospheric pressure decreases with altitude, so the rising air expands in a process that expends energy and causes the air to cool, which makes water vapor condense into cloud. Water vapor in saturated air is normally attracted to condensation nuclei such as dust and salt particles that are small enough to be held aloft by normal circulation of the air. The water droplets in a cloud have a normal radius of about 0.002 mm (0.00008 in). The droplets may collide to form larger droplets, which remain aloft as long as the velocity of the rising air within the cloud is equal to or greater than the terminal velocity of the droplets.

For non-convective cloud, the altitude at which condensation begins to happen is called the lifted condensation level (LCL), which roughly determines the height of the cloud base. Free convective clouds generally form at the altitude of the convective condensation level (CCL). Water vapor in saturated air is normally attracted to condensation nuclei such as salt particles that are small enough to be held aloft by normal circulation of the air. If the condensation process occurs below the freezing level in the troposphere, the nuclei help transform the vapor into very small water droplets. Clouds that form just above the freezing level are composed mostly of supercooled liquid droplets, while those that condense out at higher altitudes where the air is much colder generally take the form of ice crystals. An absence of sufficient condensation particles at and above the condensation level causes the rising air to become supersaturated and the formation of cloud tends to be inhibited.

=====Frontal and cyclonic lift=====
Frontal and cyclonic lift occur in their purest manifestations when stable air, which has been subjected to little or no surface heating, is forced aloft at weather fronts and around centers of low pressure. Warm fronts associated with extratropical cyclones tend to generate mostly cirriform and stratiform clouds over a wide area unless the approaching warm airmass is unstable, in which case cumulus congestus or cumulonimbus clouds will usually be embedded in the main precipitating cloud layer. Cold fronts are usually faster moving and generate a narrower line of clouds which are mostly stratocumuliform, cumuliform, or cumulonimbiform depending on the stability of the warm air mass just ahead of the front.

=====Convective lift=====
Another agent is the buoyant convective upward motion caused by significant daytime solar heating at surface level, or by relatively high absolute humidity. Incoming short-wave radiation generated by the sun is re-emitted as long-wave radiation when it reaches Earth&#x27;s surface. This process warms the air closest to ground and increases air mass instability by creating a steeper temperature gradient from warm or hot at surface level to cold aloft. This causes it to rise and cool until temperature equilibrium is achieved with the surrounding air aloft. Moderate instability allows for the formation of cumuliform clouds of moderate size that can produce light showers if the airmass is sufficiently moist. Typical convection upcurrents may allow the droplets to grow to a radius of about before precipitating as showers. The equivalent diameter of these droplets is about .

If air near the surface becomes extremely warm and unstable, its upward motion can become quite explosive, resulting in towering cumulonimbiform clouds that can cause severe weather. As tiny water particles that make up the cloud group together to form droplets of rain, they are pulled down to earth by the force of gravity. The droplets would normally evaporate below the condensation level, but strong updrafts buffer the falling droplets, and can keep them aloft much longer than they would otherwise. Violent updrafts can reach speeds of up to . The longer the rain droplets remain aloft, the more time they have to grow into larger droplets that eventually fall as heavy showers.

Rain droplets that are carried well above the freezing level become supercooled at first then freeze into small hail. A frozen ice nucleus can pick up in size traveling through one of these updrafts and can cycle through several updrafts and downdrafts before finally becoming so heavy that it falls to the ground as large hail. Cutting a hailstone in half shows onion-like layers of ice, indicating distinct times when it passed through a layer of super-cooled water. Hailstones have been found with diameters of up to .

Convective lift can occur in an unstable air mass well away from any fronts. However, very warm unstable air can also be present around fronts and low-pressure centers, often producing cumuliform and cumulonimbiform clouds in heavier and more active concentrations because of the combined frontal and convective lifting agents. As with non-frontal convective lift, increasing instability promotes upward vertical cloud growth and raises the potential for severe weather. On comparatively rare occasions, convective lift can be powerful enough to penetrate the tropopause and push the cloud top into the stratosphere.

=====Orographic lift=====
A third source of lift is wind circulation forcing air over a physical barrier such as a mountain (orographic lift). If the air is generally stable, nothing more than lenticular cap clouds will form. However, if the air becomes sufficiently moist and unstable, orographic showers or thunderstorms may appear.
====Non-adiabatic cooling====
Along with adiabatic cooling that requires a lifting agent, there are three other main mechanisms for lowering the temperature of the air to its dew point, all of which occur near surface level and do not require any lifting of the air. Conductive, radiational, and evaporative cooling can cause condensation at surface level resulting in the formation of fog. Conductive cooling takes place when air from a relatively mild source area comes into contact with a colder surface, as when mild marine air moves across a colder land area. Radiational cooling occurs due to the emission of infrared radiation, either by the air or by the surface underneath. This type of cooling is common during the night when the sky is clear. Evaporative cooling happens when moisture is added to the air through evaporation, which forces the air temperature to cool to its wet-bulb temperature, or sometimes to the point of saturation.

===Adding moisture to the air===
There are five main ways water vapor can be added to the air. Increased vapor content can result from wind convergence over water or moist ground into areas of upward motion. Precipitation or virga falling from above also enhances moisture content. Daytime heating causes water to evaporate from the surface of oceans, water bodies or wet land. Transpiration from plants is another typical source of water vapor. Lastly, cool or dry air moving over warmer water will become more humid. As with daytime heating, the addition of moisture to the air increases its heat content and instability and helps set into motion those processes that lead to the formation of cloud or fog.

=== Supersaturation ===
The amount of water that can exist as vapor in a given volume increases with the temperature. When the amount of water vapor is in equilibrium above a flat surface of water the level of vapor pressure is called saturation and the relative humidity is 100%. At this equilibrium there are equal numbers of molecules evaporating from the water as there are condensing back into the water. If the relative humidity becomes greater than 100%, it is called supersaturated. Supersaturation occurs in the absence of condensation nuclei.

Since the saturation vapor pressure is proportional to temperature, cold air has a lower saturation point than warm air. The difference between these values is the basis for the formation of clouds. When saturated air cools, it can no longer contain the same amount of water vapor. If the conditions are right, the excess water will condense out of the air until the lower saturation point is reached. Another possibility is that the water stays in vapor form, even though it is beyond the saturation point, resulting in supersaturation.

Supersaturation of more than 1–2% relative to water is rarely seen in the atmosphere, since cloud condensation nuclei are usually present. Much higher degrees of supersaturation are possible in clean air, and are the basis of the cloud chamber.

There are no instruments to take measurements of supersaturation in clouds.

=== Supercooling ===

Water droplets commonly remain as liquid water and do not freeze, even well below . Ice nuclei that may be present in an atmospheric droplet become active for ice formation at specific temperatures in between and , depending on nucleus geometry and composition. Without ice nuclei, supercooled water droplets (as well as any extremely pure liquid water) can exist down to about , at which point spontaneous freezing occurs.

=== Collision-coalescence ===

One theory explaining how the behavior of individual droplets in a cloud leads to the formation of precipitation is the collision-coalescence process. Droplets suspended in the air will interact with each other, either by colliding and bouncing off each other or by combining to form a larger droplet. Eventually, the droplets become large enough that they fall to the earth as precipitation. The collision-coalescence process does not make up a significant part of cloud formation, as water droplets have a relatively high surface tension. In addition, the occurrence of collision-coalescence is closely related to entrainment-mixing processes.

=== Bergeron process ===

The primary mechanism for the formation of ice clouds was discovered by Tor Bergeron. The Bergeron process notes that the saturation vapor pressure of water, or how much water vapor a given volume can contain, depends on what the vapor is interacting with. Specifically, the saturation vapor pressure with respect to ice is lower than the saturation vapor pressure with respect to water. Water vapor interacting with a water droplet may be saturated, at 100% relative humidity, when interacting with a water droplet, but the same amount of water vapor would be supersaturated when interacting with an ice particle. The water vapor will attempt to return to equilibrium, so the extra water vapor will condense into ice on the surface of the particle. These ice particles end up as the nuclei of larger ice crystals. This process only happens at temperatures between and . Below , liquid water will spontaneously nucleate, and freeze. The surface tension of the water allows the droplet to stay liquid well below its normal freezing point. When this happens, it is now supercooled liquid water. The Bergeron process relies on super cooled liquid water (SLW) interacting with ice nuclei to form larger particles. If there are few ice nuclei compared to the amount of SLW, droplets will be unable to form. A process whereby scientists seed a cloud with artificial ice nuclei to encourage precipitation is known as cloud seeding. This can help cause precipitation in clouds that otherwise may not rain. Cloud seeding adds excess artificial ice nuclei which shifts the balance so that there are many nuclei compared to the amount of super cooled liquid water. An over seeded cloud will form many particles, but each will be very small. This can be done as a preventative measure for areas that are at risk for hail storms.

== Cloud classification ==

Clouds in the troposphere, the atmospheric layer closest to Earth, are classified according to the height at which they are found, and their shape or appearance. There are five &quot;forms&quot; based on physical structure and process of formation. &quot;Cirriform&quot; clouds are high, thin and wispy, and are seen most extensively along the leading edges of organized weather disturbances. &quot;Stratiform&quot; clouds are non-convective and appear as extensive sheet-like layers, ranging from thin to very thick with considerable vertical development. They are mostly the product of large-scale lifting of stable air. Unstable free-convective &quot;cumuliform&quot; clouds are formed mostly into localized heaps. &quot;Stratocumuliform&quot; clouds of limited convection show a mix of cumuliform and stratiform characteristics which appear in the form of rolls or ripples. Highly convective &quot;cumulonimbiform&quot; clouds have complex structures often including cirriform tops and stratocumuliform accessory clouds.

These forms are cross-classified by altitude range or &quot;level&quot; into ten &quot;genus&quot; types which can be subdivided into species and lesser types. High-level clouds form at altitudes of 5 to 12 kilometers. All cirriform clouds are classified as high-level and therefore constitute a single cloud genus cirrus. Stratiform and stratocumuliform clouds in the high level of the troposphere have the prefix &quot;cirro-&quot; added to their names yielding the genera cirrostratus and cirrocumulus. Similar clouds found in the middle level (altitude range 2 to 7 kilometers) carry the prefix &quot;alto-&quot; resulting in the genus names altostratus and altocumulus.

Low level clouds have no height-related prefixes, so stratiform and stratocumuliform clouds based around 2 kilometres or lower are known simply as stratus and stratocumulus. Small cumulus clouds with little vertical development (species humilis) are also commonly classified as low level.

Cumuliform and cumulonimbiform heaps and deep stratiform layers often occupy at least two tropospheric levels, and the largest or deepest of these can occupy all three levels. They may be classified as low or mid-level, but are also commonly classified or characterized as vertical or multi-level. Nimbostratus clouds are stratiform layers with sufficient vertical extent to produce significant precipitation. Towering cumulus (species congestus), and cumulonimbus may form anywhere from near the surface to intermediate heights of around 3 kilometres. Of the vertically developed clouds, the cumulonimbus type is the tallest and can virtually span the entire troposphere from a few hundred metres above the ground up to the tropopause. It is the cloud responsible for thunderstorms.

Some clouds can form at very high to extreme levels above the troposphere, mostly above the polar regions of Earth. Polar stratospheric clouds are seen but rarely in winter at altitudes of 18 to 30 kilometers, while in summer, noctilucent clouds occasionally form at high latitudes at an altitude range of 76 to 85 kilometers. These polar clouds show some of the same forms as seen lower in the troposphere.

Homospheric types determined by cross-classification of forms and levels.
&quot; Homospheric types include the ten tropospheric genera and several additional major types above the troposphere. The cumulus genus includes four species that indicate vertical size and structure.

== Determination of properties ==

Satellites are used to gather data about cloud properties and other information such as Cloud Amount, height, IR emissivity, visible optical depth, icing, effective particle size for both liquid and ice, and cloud top temperature and pressure.

=== Detection ===
Data sets regarding cloud properties are gathered using satellites, such as MODIS, POLDER, CALIPSO or ATSR. The instruments measure the radiances of the clouds, from which the relevant parameters can be retrieved. This is usually done by using inverse theory.

The method of detection is based on the fact that the clouds tend to appear brighter and colder than the land surface. Because of this, difficulties rise in detecting clouds above bright (highly reflective) surfaces, such as oceans and ice.

=== Parameters ===

The value of a certain parameter is more reliable the more satellites are measuring the said parameter. This is because the range of errors and neglected details varies from instrument to instrument. Thus, if the analysed parameter has similar values for different instruments, it is accepted that the true value lies in the range given by the corresponding data sets.

The Global Energy and Water Cycle Experiment uses the following quantities in order to compare data quality from different satellites in order to establish a reliable quantification of the properties of the clouds:

*the &quot;cloud cover or cloud amount&quot; with values between 0 and 1
*the &quot;cloud temperature at cloud top&quot; ranging from 150 to 340 K
*the &quot;cloud pressure at top&quot; 1013 - 100 hPa
*the &quot;cloud height&quot;, measured above sea level, ranging from 0 to 20 km
*the &quot;cloud IR emissivity&quot;, with values between 0 and 1, with a global average around 0.7
*the &quot;effective cloud amount&quot;, the cloud amount weighted by the cloud IR emissivity, with a global average of 0.5
*the &quot;cloud (visible) optical depth&quot; varies within a range of 4 and 10. 
*the &quot;cloud water path&quot; for the liquid and solid (ice) phases of the cloud particles
*the &quot;cloud effective particle size&quot; for both liquid and ice, ranging from 0 to 200 μm

=== Icing ===
Another vital property is the icing characteristic of various cloud genus types at various altitudes, which can have great impact on the safety of flying. The methodologies used to determine these characteristics include using CloudSat data for the analysis and retrieval of icing conditions, the location of clouds using cloud geometric and reflectivity data, the identification of cloud types using cloud classification data, and finding vertical temperature distribution along the CloudSat track (GFS).

The range of temperatures that can give rise to icing conditions is defined according to cloud types and altitude levels:
:Low-level stratocumulus and stratus can cause icing at a temperature range of 0 to -10 °C.
:For mid-level altocumulus and altostratus, the range is 0 to -20 °C.
:Vertical or multi-level cumulus, cumulonimbus, and nimbostatus, create icing at a range of 0 to -25 °C.
:High-level cirrus, cirrocumulus, and cirrostratus generally cause no icing because they are made mostly of ice crystals colder than -25 °C.

=== Cohesion and dissolution ===
There are forces throughout the homosphere (which includes the troposphere, stratosphere, and mesosphere) that can impact the structural integrity of a cloud. It has been speculated that as long as the air remains saturated, the natural force of cohesion that hold the molecules of a substance together may act to keep the cloud from breaking up. However, this speculation has a logical flaw in that the water droplets in the cloud are not in contact with each other and therefore not satisfying the condition required for the intermolecular forces of cohesion to act. Dissolution of the cloud can occur when the process of adiabatic cooling ceases and upward lift of the air is replaced by subsidence. This leads to at least some degree of adiabatic warming of the air which can result in the cloud droplets or crystals turning back into invisible water vapor. Stronger forces such as wind shear and downdrafts can impact a cloud, but these are largely confined to the troposphere where nearly all the Earth&#x27;s weather takes place. A typical cumulus cloud weighs about 500 metric tons, or 1.1 million pounds, the weight of 100 elephants.

==Models==
There are two main model schemes that can represent cloud physics, the most common is bulk microphysics models that uses mean values to describe the cloud properties (e.g. rain water content, ice content), the properties can represent only the first order (concentration) or also the second order (mass).
The second option is to use bin microphysics scheme that keep the moments (mass or concentration) in different for different size of particles.
The bulk microphysics models are much faster than the bin models but are less accurate.

<text>Barry Nathaniel Malzberg (July 24, 1939 – December 19, 2024) was an American writer and editor, most often of science fiction and fantasy.

==Life and career==
===Early life and family===
Malzberg originated from a Jewish family and graduated from Syracuse University in 1960. He worked as an investigator for the New York City Department of Welfare in 1961–1962 and 1963–1964. In 1963, he was employed as a reimbursement agent for the New York State Department of Mental Health. He married Joyce Zelnick in 1964.
===Literary career===
Malzberg initially sought to establish himself as a playwright as well as a prose-fiction writer. In 1964, he returned to Syracuse University for graduate study in creative writing. Although he was awarded a Schubert Foundation Playwriting Fellowship (1964-1965) and the Cornelia Ward Creative Writing Fellowship (1965), he was unable to sell his work to any of the literary magazines of the era. Resolving not to be an &quot;unpublished assistant professor of English,&quot; he left the program in 1965 to pursue a career as a freelance writer and agent for the Scott Meredith Literary Agency. Malzberg would intermittently continue with SMLA through the next several decades, being one of its last caretakers.

His first published story was &quot;The Bed&quot; under the pseudonym &quot;Nathan Herbert&quot; in the men&#x27;s magazine &quot;Wildcat&quot;. His first science fiction story (&quot;We&#x27;re Coming Through the Window&quot;) was published in the August 1967 issue of &quot;Galaxy&quot;. Malzberg frequently repurposed existing stories for his science fiction sales. He first found commercial and critical success with publication of his surreal novelette &quot;Final War&quot; in &quot;The Magazine of Fantasy and Science Fiction&quot; under the name &quot;K. M. O&#x27;Donnell&quot; in 1968.

He had been writing erotic novels using the pseudonym &quot;Mel Johnson&quot; but began writing erotic novels under his own name in 1968 for Maurice Girodias&#x27;s Olympia Press. Many of his science short stories and novels in the late 1960s were published under the pseudonym &quot;K. M. O&#x27;Donnell&quot;, derived from the surnames of Henry Kuttner, C. L. Moore, and their joint pseudonym &quot;Lawrence O&#x27;Donnell.&quot;

He was an editor at &quot;Escapade&quot;, a men&#x27;s magazine, in early 1968. In the latter half of 1968 he edited &quot;Amazing Stories&quot; and &quot;Fantastic&quot; science fiction and fantasy-fiction magazines. He was the editor of the Science Fiction Writers of America Bulletin in 1969 until he was asked to resign because of a critical editorial he wrote about the NASA space program.

Malzberg&#x27;s writing style is distinctive, frequently employing long, elaborate sentences with few commas. Most of his science fiction books are short, present-tense narratives concerned exclusively with the consciousness of a single obsessive character. His themes, particularly in the novels &quot;Beyond Apollo&quot; (1972) and &quot;The Falling Astronauts&quot; (1971) about the US space exploration programme, include the dehumanisation effects of bureaucracy and technology; his treatment of these themes sometimes exhibits strong resemblances to Franz Kafka, accompanied by unreliable narrator techniques. In novels like &quot;Galaxies&quot; (1975) and &quot;Herovit&#x27;s World&quot; (1973), Malzberg uses metafiction techniques to subject the heroic conventions and literary limitations of space opera to biting satire.

He edited anthologies such as &quot;Final Stage&quot; (with Edward L. Ferman), also several in collaboration with Bill Pronzini and others. In interviews and memoirs he detailed how many of his novels have been written within weeks or even days: for example, at the beginning of 1973 he was commissioned to write the series of novels &quot;The Lone Wolf&quot;, ten of which he completed by October 1973. Aside from fantastic fiction, he was a prolific writer of crime fiction and other genres, under his own name, as O&#x27;Donnell, and as Mike Barry and under other pseudonyms. He also often wrote in collaboration with Pronzini, Kathe Koja, and others. He wrote the novelization of the Saul Bass-directed 1974 film &quot;Phase IV&quot;. At the end of 1975 he made numerous public statements that he was retiring from science fiction.
===Music===
A devotee of classical music, he was also a violinist, and performed in the premiere performance of work by Somtow Sucharitkul. He was also nominated several times for the Hugo Award (including for the stories &quot;In the Stone House&quot; and &quot;Understanding Entropy&quot;), and won the &quot;Locus&quot; Award for his collection of historical and critical essays, &quot;The Engines of the Night&quot; (1982).
===Reception===
Malzberg&#x27;s work has been widely praised by critics, while being attacked by proponents of hard science fiction for its pessimistic, anti-Campbellian tenor. The dystopian and metafictional elements of Malzberg&#x27;s work led to a parody by Paul Di Filippo, whose first published story, &quot;Falling Expectations&quot;, was a parody of Malzberg. Theodore Sturgeon said of Malzberg in 1973, &quot;I look forward eagerly to his byline, snatch joyfully at it when I see it and he has never let me down.&quot; Writing in &quot;The Paris Review&quot;, critic J.D. Daniels said of Malzberg: &quot;Malzberg’s books, in their tortured self-awareness, are primarily about &quot;writing&quot;: its technical difficulties and moral pitfalls, its potential to cheapen or calcify, its temptation to fraudulence or ventriloquism, the insisted-on inadequacy of language as an excuse for not being a less recursive or less involuted writer, and so on.&quot; 
===Science Fiction Writers of America===
For years, Malzberg collaborated with friend and fellow science fiction writer Mike Resnick on a series of more than 50 advice columns for writers in the Science Fiction and Fantasy Writers of America&#x27;s quarterly magazine &quot;SFWA Bulletin&quot;. They have been collected as &quot;The Business of Science Fiction&quot;.

Malzberg was a regular contributor to the &quot;SFWA Bulletin&quot; published by the Science Fiction and Fantasy Writers of America. In 2013, articles he wrote for the &quot;Bulletin&quot; with Mike Resnick triggered a controversy about sexism among members of the association. Female authors strongly objected to comments by Resnick and Malzberg such as references to &quot;lady editors&quot; and &quot;lady writers&quot; who were &quot;beauty pageant beautiful&quot; or a &quot;knock out.&quot; &quot;Bulletin&quot; editor Jean Rabe resigned her post in the course of the controversy.

He had been a resident of Teaneck, New Jersey, for many years.
===Death===
Malzberg died in Saddle River, New Jersey, on December 19, 2024, at the age of 85. He was survived by his wife and daughters. Malzberg had been suffering from a series of medical problems, culminating in pneumonia and a bacterial infection.

<doc id="731804" wikidata="Q506182" url="?curid=731804" title="John Frederick I, Elector of Saxony">
<text>John Frederick I (, 30 June 1503 – 3 March 1554), called the Magnanimous (), was the Elector of Saxony (1532–1547) until he was deprived of this title in the Capitulation of Wittenberg by Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor. He was leading the Schmalkaldic League, a military alliance of Lutheran principalities.

==Early years==
John Frederick was the eldest son of John, Elector of Saxony by his first wife, Sophie of Mecklenburg-Schwerin. His mother died fourteen days after his birth, on 12 July 1503.

John Frederick received his education from George Spalatin, whom he highly esteemed during his whole life. Spalatin was Martin Luther&#x27;s friend and advisor and thus, through Spalatin&#x27;s schooling, John Frederick developed a devotion to the teachings of Luther. His knowledge of history was comprehensive, and his library, which extended over all sciences, was one of the largest in Germany.

He cultivated a personal relationship with Luther, beginning to correspond with him in the days when the bull of excommunication was first issued against the Reformer, and showing himself a convinced adherent of Luther. He carefully observed the development of the reformatory movement. He read Luther&#x27;s writings, urged the printing of the first complete (Wittenberg) edition of his works, and in the latter years of his life promoted the compilation of the Jena edition. At the Elector&#x27;s Schloss Hartenfels at Torgau, he constructed a chapel specifically designed to be a Lutheran place of worship and invited Martin Luther to deliver the inaugural sermon. The influence of Lutheranism at John Frederick&#x27;s court is also visible in the translation by Veit Warbeck of the French romance the &quot;Magelone&quot;, made in preparation of John Frederick&#x27;s marriage in 1527; Catholic elements are suppressed.

His father introduced him into the political and diplomatic affairs of the time, and he conducted the first negotiations of a treaty with Hesse in Kreuzburg and Friedewald. He took an active part in the disturbances caused by the Pack affair (&quot;see&quot; John the Steadfast), and Luther was grateful to him for his exertions, in spite of his youth, for the maintenance of peace.

During the second diet of Speyer (1529) he temporarily assumed the reins of government in place of his father. The intrigues of Archduke Ferdinand induced him after the diet to draw up an imperial statute for the Evangelical estates, which shows that he was more decidedly convinced of the right and duty of defense than his father. He accompanied the latter to the Diet of Augsburg in 1530, signed with him the Augsburg Confession and was active in the proceedings. His attitude did not remain unnoticed, and won him the dislike of Emperor Charles V.

==Elector of Saxony==
In 1532, John Frederick succeeded his father as elector. In the beginning he reigned with his half-brother, John Ernest, but in 1542 became sole ruler.

Chancellor Gregor Brück, who for years had guided the foreign relations of the country with ability and prudence, remained also his councilor, but his open and impulsive nature often led him to disregard the propositions of his more experienced adviser, so that the country was in frequent danger, especially as John Frederick was not a far-sighted politician.

He consolidated the Lutheran State Church by the institution of an electoral consistory (1542) and renewed the church visitation. He took a firmer and more decided stand than his father in favor of the Schmalkaldic League, but on account of his strictly Lutheran convictions was involved in difficulties with Philip I, Landgrave of Hesse, who favored a union with the Swiss and Strasburg Evangelicals. He was averse to all propositions of Popes Clement VII and Paul III to support calling a General Council, because he was convinced that it would only serve &quot;for the preservation of the papal and anti-Christian rule&quot;; but to be prepared for any event, he requested Luther to summarize all articles to which he would adhere before a council, and Luther wrote the Schmalkald Articles. At the Diet of Schmalkalden in 1537 the council was refused, and the elector treated the papal legate with open disregard and rejected the propositions of Matthias von Held, the imperial legate.
He followed the efforts at agreement at the conference of Regensburg in 1541 with suspicion and refused to accept the article on justification which had been drawn up under the supervision of Gasparo Contarini to suit both parties, and Luther, his steady adviser, confirmed him in his aversion. The efforts at agreement failed, and the elector contributed not a little to broaden the gulf by his interference in the ecclesiastical affairs of Halle and by aiding the Reformation which had been introduced there by Justus Jonas. His attitude became more and more stubborn and regardless of consequences, not to the advantage of the Protestant cause.

In spite of the warnings of the emperor, of Brück, and of Luther, he arbitrarily set aside in 1541 the election of Julius von Pflug as the bishop of Naumburg, and instead instituted Nicolaus von Amsdorf as bishop, and introduced the Reformation. In 1542 he expelled Duke Henry V of Brunswick-Wolfenbüttel from his country to protect the Evangelical cities Goslar and Brunswick and introduced the Reformation there. Entanglement in other wars hindered Emperor Charles V from interfering and by apparently yielding he succeeded in concealing his true intentions. The elector appeared personally at the diet of Speyer in 1544. The harmony of the emperor with the Evangelicals appeared never greater than at that time. He permitted the Regensburg declaration of 1541 to be embodied in the new recess and acknowledged all innovations which the Evangelicals had made between 1532 and 1541 because he needed the aid of the Protestants against France. John Frederick actually thought that peace had come and continued the ecclesiastical reforms in his country. Even the growing discord among the allies did not disturb him.
When the Schmalkaldic War broke out in 1546, he marched to the south at the head of his troops, but the unexpected invasion of his country by his cousin Duke Maurice compelled him to return. He succeeded in reconquering the larger part of his possessions and repelling Maurice, but suddenly the emperor hastened north and surprised the elector. The Battle of Mühlberg, 24 April 1547, went against him and dispersed his army. He received a slashing wound to the left side of his face, leaving him with a disfiguring scar from his lower eye socket down his cheek. He was taken prisoner by Charles V and sent into exile in Worms.

==Prisoner==
Emperor Charles V condemned John Frederick to death as a convicted rebel; but, not to lose time in the siege of Wittenberg, which was defended by John Frederick&#x27;s wife, Sybille, he did not execute the sentence and entered into negotiations.

To save his life, protect his wife and sons, and avert further hostilities, John Frederick conceded the Capitulation of Wittenberg, and, after having been compelled to resign the government of his country in favor of Maurice, his condemnation was changed into imprisonment for life.

==Final days==
The sudden attack upon the emperor by Elector Maurice made an end of John Frederick&#x27;s imprisonment, and he was released on 1 September 1552. He firmly refused to bind himself to comply in matters of religion with the decisions of a future council or diet, declaring that he was resolved to adhere until his grave to the doctrine contained in the Augsburg Confession.

His homeward journey was a triumphal march. He met his family after an absence of five years at Wolfersdorf Castle which he had built as a hunting lodge earlier, and he renamed it &quot;Schloss Froehliche Wiederkunft&quot; (&quot;Palace of Happy Returning&quot;).

He removed the seat of government to Weimar and reformed the conditions of his country, but died within two years. A special object of his care was the University of Jena, which he planned in place of Wittenberg, which he had lost (1547). He died in Weimar.

==Marriage and family==

In Torgau on 9 February 1527 John Frederick married Sibylle of Cleves, daughter of John III, Duke of Cleves and sister to Anne of Cleves, who was briefly Queen of England as the fourth wife of King Henry VIII. They had four sons:
#John Frederick II, Duke of Saxony (b. Torgau, 8 January 1529 – d. as imperial prisoner at Schloss Steyer, Upper Austria, 19 May 1595)
#John William, Duke of Saxe-Weimar (b. Torgau, 11 March 1530 – d. Weimar, 2 March 1573)
#John Ernest (b. Weimar, 5 January 1535 – d. Weimar, 11 January 1535) died in infancy.
#John Frederick III, Duke of Saxe-Gotha (1554–1565) (b. Torgau, 16 January 1538 – d. Jena, 31 October
1565)

<text>The Aberdeen Scandal was a military sexual assault scandal in 1996 at Aberdeen Proving Ground, a United States Army base in Maryland.

Ultimately, twelve drill instructors were charged with sex crimes; four were sentenced to prison, while eight others were discharged or received non-judicial punishment. Additionally, &quot;letters of reprimand were issued to Aberdeen&#x27;s commanding general and three other senior officers.&quot;

==Charges brought against the officers==
Captain Derrick Robertson and Sergeants Delmar Simpson and Nathanael Beech were accused of participating in the Army&#x27;s biggest sex abuse scandal on record. Robertson and Simpson faced rape charges and Beech was charged with adultery.&lt;ref name=&quot;http://www.cnn.com/US/9612/06/aberdeen.arraign/index.html&quot;&gt;Three soldiers arraigned in U.S. Army sex scandal&lt;/ref&gt;

Army Secretary Togo West accused those charged of abusing their power, and ordered all soldiers to undergo sexual harassment training so they could learn the Army&#x27;s &quot;zero tolerance&quot; policy towards sexual harassment.

The men accused felt that statements made by West and other officials within the Army were prejudging the case and would result in an unfair trial. Robertson&#x27;s attorney, Jerome Murphy, asked the military judge Linda Webster, to enact a gag order on West and others, but she deferred judgment. However, she did order prospective jurors not to follow media coverage of the case to avoid interference with their judgment.

==Individuals involved and outcomes==
*Sergeant Delmar Simpson was held at the Marine Corps Brig, Quantico while his court-martial was pending. He was convicted of 18 counts of rape and 29 other offenses, and was sentenced to 25 years in military prison.
*Staff Sergeant Vernell Robinson Jr., &quot;was convicted of 19 counts involving the abuse of five women under his command,&quot; including sodomy, adultery, communicating a threat, obstructing justice and disobeying orders. At his court-martial, Robinson &quot;made a dramatic plea for clemency, weeping and beating his head contritely against the witness stand.&quot; Robinson was sentenced to six months in prison, demoted to private, forfeited all benefits, and was dishonorably discharged from the military.
*Captain Derrick Robertson, a thirty-year old career soldier, was the highest-ranking of the defendants, serving as a company commander. He was charged with rape, forcible sodomy, adultery, indecent assault, conduct unbecoming an officer, violating a general order, and obstruction of justice. He pleaded guilty to adultery, consensual sodomy, conduct unbecoming an officer and dereliction of duty under a plea agreement with military prosecutors. His case involved one female soldier. Robertson was sentenced to one year in prison, with eight months suspended.
* Staff Sergeant Herman Gunter was charged &quot;with rape, assault, adultery, indecent assault, sexual intercourse by fear, conspiracy to obstruct justice, obstruction of justice, violation of a general order, and cruelty and maltreatment for inappropriate sexual comments and harassment&quot;; the allegations involved three female trainees. The Army subsequently dropped the two counts of sexual intercourse by fear. At court-martial, Gunter was acquitted of four of the remaining seven counts (of &quot;indecent assault, adultery, cruelty and maltreatment, and engaging in a forbidden social relationship with one of the two women&quot;) but was convicted of inappropriate behavior (by trying to hug and kiss another woman) and of obstructing an investigation (by asking both women not to speak with investigators). Gunter was sentenced to a reprimand and to demotion by two grades.
*Sergeant 1st Class William Jones, a drill instructor assigned to B Company of the 16th Ordnance Battalion, was charged with one count of indecent assault involving an ex-trainee (a civilian at the time of the alleged offense), one count of drunkenness on duty, and &quot;seven counts of fraternizing with recruits that involve six female trainees.&quot; The Army ultimately dropped the charges, choosing to pursue discharge proceedings instead.
*Sergeant 1st Class Theron Brown, an instructor, was &quot;charged with violation of a general order, sodomy, adultery, making a false statement and disobeying a superior&#x27;s order&quot; in connection with incidents involving two female trainees and one female civilian. Brown was discharged from the service in lieu of court-martial.
*Sergeant Nathanael C. Beach, another drill instructor, was charged with &quot;violation of a superior&#x27;s order, failing to obey a general order, making a false official statement, adultery, communicating a threat and fraternization with a female soldier&quot; for incidents involving two female soldiers. Beach was accused by a trainee &quot;of having sex with her and threatening to kill her if she didn&#x27;t keep quiet.&quot; Charges were dropped against Beach, who faced administrative discipline rather than court-martial.
*Sergeant Isiah Chestnut was initially charged with a variety of offenses, involving four female trainees, but the Army decided not to pursue a court-martial, choosing Article 15 non-judicial punishment instead. Chestnut was ultimately permitted to resign in lieu of facing court-martial.
*Sergeant 1st Class Ronald Moffett &quot;was charged with indecent assault, indecent language, adultery, cruelty and maltreatment, and violating an order prohibiting social relationships with trainees&quot; in a case involving four female soldiers. Moffett agreed to be discharged in lieu of court-martial.
*Sergeant Tony Cross, a Gulf War veteran who had been in the Army for fourteen years, was charged with &quot;adultery, sodomy, wrongfully socializing with trainees and failing to report prohibited relationships&quot; in a case involving four female trainees. Cross maintained his innocence and agreed to be discharged in lieu of court-martial.
* Major General John E. Longhouser, the commanding general of Aberdeen Proving Ground, was allowed to take early retirement in 1997 after it was revealed that he had &quot;an adulterous affair with a civilian woman while separated from his wife.&quot; The events occurred more than five years before Longhouser&#x27;s retirement, and before his arrival at Aberdeen. According to the &quot;New York Times&quot;, Pentagon officials stated that Longhouser &quot;appeared to be retiring partly out of disgust that his entire career would be judged on the basis of what he and others would regard as a minor dalliance.&quot;

==Fort Leonard Wood scandal==
A separate and unrelated scandal took place in 1996 at Fort Leonard Wood in Missouri; charges in that case were announced five days before the Aberdeen scandal became public, and the two cases were reported by the media in tandem. According to Army officials, 22 female soldiers &quot;were involved in incidents&quot; in which three men—Staff Sgt. Loren B. Taylor, Staff Sgt. Anthony S. Fore, and Sgt. George W. Blackley Jr.—were charged.

Taylor pleaded guilty to failing to obey a general regulation &quot;by having consensual sex with three female recruits and trying to have sex with another&quot; and admitted to &quot;improper contact with a fifth woman recruit.&quot; Taylor was &quot;discharged, demoted and sentenced to confinement.&quot;

Fore pleaded guilty to failing to obey a general regulation, indecent assault, and assault and battery, and a military judge, after hearing testimony, convicting Fore &quot;of two additional counts of failing to obey a general regulation and indecent assault.&quot; The Army dropped several other charges. Fore was sentenced to eighteen months in prison and was dishonorably discharged.

Blackley was acquitted on charges of failing to obey a general regulation, indecent assault, maltreatment and showing disrespect to a fellow non-commissioned officer.

==Aftermath==
Since the charges were filed, the U.S. Army set up a hotline to take reports of sexual harassment in the military. It has also made available many resources for soldiers who feel they have been harassed or assaulted.

Supervisors were also barred from having romantic relationships with the soldiers they trained. The Army cited the fact that they cannot be sure if all relationships are consensual due to the nature of a supervisor&#x27;s power over their trainees.

<text>Józef Arkusz (18 March 1921 – 29 June 1995) was a Polish film director and producer of over 70 educational films.

Józef Arkusz was born on 18 March 1921 in Peratyn, Tarnopol Voivodeship (modern day Chervonohrad Raion, Lviv Oblast). His family moved to Lviv in the early 1930s. During World War II he took part in the underground movement Armia Krajowa, for which he was awarded the Officer&#x27;s Cross of the Order of Polonia Restituta. Following the war, he moved to the industrial city of Łódź, in central Poland, where he began studying biology.

He attended the University of Poznań, and received a degree in Biology in 1950. He furthered his education by attending and graduating from the Łódż Film School in 1953.

He worked on minor films and projects until the 1960s when he began to be noticed by the international community. At this point, his career took off and he made some of his most famous educational films. Working at the Educational Film Studio (Wytwórnia Filmów Oświatowych) in Łódż, he created General Topic Films (Filmy Oświatowe), and is credited as being one of the most influential Polish documentary filmmakers. He pioneered new methods of filming and documentary production, which are now used as standard practice around the world. His film topics included technical and biological specialties and focused on new biological advances of the modern age.

He died in Łódź, Poland on Monday 19 June 1995.

<text>Fodor&#x27;s is a producer of English-language travel guides and online tourism information. It was founded by Hungarian Eugene Fodor, who created his first travel guide, &quot;1936...on the Continent&quot;, with the intention of improving upon the directory-type travel guides in existence through the inclusion of practical guidance, such as tipping advice, and levity (the introduction noted that &quot;Rome contains not only magnificent monuments [...] but also Italians.&quot;).

Fodor’s pioneering book was a success in England and the United States, and was immediately updated as &quot;1937 in Europe&quot;. After an interruption caused by World War II, Fodor&#x27;s Modern Guides, Inc., was founded in Paris in 1949, and a year later David McKay Company became its publisher. Fodor’s was acquired with McKay by Random House in 1986 and sold to Internet Brands in 2016.

Fodor&#x27;s has published more than 440 guides (in 14 series) on over 300 destinations, and has more than 700 permanently placed researchers all over the world. Its website, which was launched in 1996, was nominated for a Webby Award in 2004.

<text>USS &quot;Underwood&quot; (FFG-36) was the twenty-seventh ship of the of guided-missile frigates, named for Captain Gordon Waite Underwood (1910–1978).

Ordered from Bath Iron Works, Bath, Maine, on 27 April 1979 as part of the FY79 program, &quot;Underwood&quot; was laid down on 30 July 1981, launched on 6 February 1982, and commissioned on 29 January 1983. She was assigned to Destroyer Squadron 14 and homeported at Mayport, FL.

On 13 January 2010, &quot;Underwood&quot; was ordered to assist in the humanitarian relief efforts following the 2010 Haiti earthquake.

&quot;Underwood&quot; was extensively used to counteract drug trafficking in Latin America with the assistance of the Coast Guard.

&quot;Underwood&quot; was decommissioned at Naval Station Mayport on 8 March 2013. It was then moved to the Naval Inactive Ship Maintenance Facility in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, where it was laid up.

On 27 February 2023, &quot;Underwood&quot; arrived at Brownsville, Texas, where it will be scrapped.

<doc id="731832" wikidata="Q2141" url="?curid=731832" title="Halifax, Nova Scotia">
<text>Halifax is the capital and most populous municipality of the Canadian province of Nova Scotia, and the most populous municipality in Atlantic Canada. As of 2023, it is estimated that the population of the Halifax CMA was 518,711, with 348,634 people in its urban area. The regional municipality consists of four former municipalities that were amalgamated in 1996: Halifax, Dartmouth, Bedford, and Halifax County.

Halifax is an economic centre of Atlantic Canada, home to a concentration of government offices and private companies. Major employers include the Department of National Defence, Dalhousie University, Nova Scotia Health Authority, Saint Mary&#x27;s University, the Halifax Shipyard, various levels of government, and the Port of Halifax. Resource industries found in rural areas of the municipality include agriculture, fishing, mining, forestry, and natural gas extraction.

==History==
The Mi&#x27;kmaq name for Halifax is &quot;Kjipuktuk&quot;, pronounced &quot;che-book-took&quot;. The name means &quot;Great Harbour&quot; in the Mi&#x27;kmaq language.
The first permanent European settlement in the region was on the Halifax Peninsula. The establishment of the &quot;Town of Halifax&quot;, named after the 2nd Earl of Halifax, in 1749 led to the colonial capital being transferred from Annapolis Royal.

The establishment of Halifax marked the beginning of Father Le Loutre&#x27;s War. The war began when Edward Cornwallis arrived to establish Halifax with 13 transports and a sloop of war on June 21, 1749. By unilaterally establishing Halifax, the British were violating earlier treaties with the Mi&#x27;kmaq (1726), which were signed after Father Rale&#x27;s War. Cornwallis brought along 1,176 settlers and their families. To guard against Mi&#x27;kmaq, Acadian and French attacks on the new Protestant settlements, British fortifications were erected in Halifax (Citadel Hill) (1749), Bedford (Fort Sackville) (1749), Dartmouth (1750), and Lawrencetown (1754), all areas within the modern-day Regional Municipality. St. Margaret&#x27;s Bay was first settled by French-speaking Foreign Protestants at French Village, Nova Scotia who migrated from Lunenburg, Nova Scotia during the American Revolution.

December 6, 1917 saw one of the great disasters in Canadian history, when the , a French cargo ship carrying munitions, collided with the Belgian Relief vessel in &quot;The Narrows&quot; between upper Halifax Harbour and Bedford Basin. The resulting explosion, the Halifax Explosion, devastated the Richmond District in the North End of Halifax, killing approximately 2,000 people and injuring nearly 9,000 others. The blast was the largest artificial explosion before the development of nuclear weapons. Significant aid came from Boston, strengthening the bond between the two coastal cities.

The four municipalities in the Halifax urban area had been coordinating delivery of some services through the Metropolitan Authority since the late 1970s, but remained independent towns and cities until April 1, 1996, when the provincial government amalgamated all municipal governments within Halifax County to create the Halifax Regional Municipality. The municipal boundary thus now includes all of Halifax County except for several First Nation reserves.

Since amalgamation, the region has officially been known as the Halifax Regional Municipality (HRM), although &quot;Halifax&quot; has remained in common usage for brevity. On April 15, 2014, regional council approved the implementation of a new branding campaign for the municipality. The campaign would see the region referred to in promotional materials simply as &quot;Halifax&quot;, although &quot;Halifax Regional Municipality&quot; would remain the region&#x27;s official name.

==Geography==
===Climate===
Halifax has a oceanic climate (Köppen &quot;Dfb&quot;), with warm summers and relatively mild winters, which is due to Gulf Stream moderation. The weather is usually milder in the winter or cooler in the summer than areas at similar latitudes inland, with the temperature remaining (with occasional notable exceptions) between about . January is the coldest month, being the only month with a high that is slightly below freezing at , while August is the warmest. The sea heavily influences the climate of the area, causing significant seasonal lag in summer, with August being significantly warmer than June and with September being the third mildest month in terms of mean temperature.

Precipitation is high year-round. Winter features a mix of rain, freezing rain and snow with frequent freeze-thaw cycles. Snowfall is heavy in winter, but snow cover is usually patchy owing to the frequent freeze-thaw cycles, which melt accumulated snow. Some winters feature colder temperatures and fewer freeze-thaw cycles; the most recent of which being the winter of 2014–2015, which was the coldest, snowiest and stormiest in about a century. Spring is often wet and cool and arrives much later than in areas of Canada at similar latitudes, due to cooler sea temperatures. Summers are mild and pleasant, with hot and humid conditions very infrequent. Warm, pleasant conditions often extend well into September, sometimes into mid-October. Average monthly precipitation is highest from November to February due to intense late-fall to winter storms migrating from the Northeastern U.S., and lowest in summer, with August being the year&#x27;s warmest and driest month on average. Halifax can sometimes receive hurricanes, mostly between August and October. An example is when Hurricane Juan, a category 2 storm, hit in September 2003 and caused considerable damage to the region. Hurricane Earl grazed the coast as a category 1 storm in 2010. In 2019, Hurricane Dorian made landfall just south of Halifax as a post-tropical storm with an intensity equivalent to a category 2 hurricane and caused significant damage across Nova Scotia. In 2021 Hurricane Ida hit the region with minor damage. In 2022, Hurricane Fiona hit as a category 2 storm, although damage was relatively minor in Halifax, with downed trees and widespread power outages for days. Atlantic sea surface temperatures have risen in recent years, making Halifax and the coast of Nova Scotia somewhat more susceptible to hurricanes than the area had been in the past.

The highest temperature ever recorded in Halifax was on July 10, 1912, and the lowest temperature recorded was on February 18, 1922. The March 2012 North American heat wave brought unusually high temperatures to the municipality of Halifax. On March 22, the mercury climbed to at the Halifax Windsor Park weather station, and at Halifax Stanfield International Airport. In spite of the possibility of high temperatures, in a normal year there are only three days that go above . Halifax also has a modest frost count by Canadian standards due to the maritime influence, averaging 131 air frosts and 49 full days below freezing annually. On average the frost-free period is 182 days, ranging from May 1 to October 31.

===Metropolitan landscape===
As of the 2021 Canadian Census, the Halifax Census Metropolitan Area (&quot;Metropolitan Halifax&quot;) is coterminous with the Municipality of Halifax and the Municipality of East Hants. The total land area of Metropolitan Halifax is 

The metropolitan area grew between the 2016 Canadian Census and the 2021 Canadian Census. Before the 2021 Canadian Census, Metropolitan Halifax covered After the addition of the Municipality of East Hants, the metropolitan area&#x27;s land area expanded by to its current land area.

===Municipal landscape===
Halifax has two distinct areas: its rural area and its urban area. Since 1 April 1996, the entirety of the County of Halifax and all of its places (cities, suburbs, towns, and villages) were turned into communities of a larger single-tier municipality called Halifax Regional Municipality. As of 2021, the total surface area of the municipality is .

The Halifax Regional Municipality occupies an area comparable in size to the total land area of the province of Prince Edward Island, and measures approximately in length between its eastern and westernmost extremities, excluding Sable Island. The nearest point of land to Sable Island is not in HRM, but rather in adjacent Guysborough County. However, Sable Island is considered part of District 7 of the Halifax Regional Council.

The coastline is heavily indented, accounting for its length of approximately , with the northern boundary of the municipality usually being between inland. The coast is mostly rock with small isolated sand beaches in sheltered bays. The largest coastal features include St. Margarets Bay, Halifax Harbour/Bedford Basin, Cole Harbour, Musquodoboit Harbour, Jeddore Harbour, Ship Harbour, Sheet Harbour, and Ecum Secum Harbour. The municipality&#x27;s topography spans from lush farmland in the Musquodoboit Valley to rocky and heavily forested rolling hills. It includes a number of islands and peninsulas, among them McNabs Island, Beaver Island, Melville Island, Deadman&#x27;s Island and Sable Island.

====Regional Centre====
The Halifax Regional Centre includes the Halifax Peninsula, and Dartmouth inside the Circumferential Highway. The new inner urban area covers and houses 96,619 people in 55,332 dwelling units as of the 2016 Census. The Regional Centre has many public services within its boundaries, and it hosts large entertainment venues (Scotiabank Centre), and major hospitals (Dartmouth General Hospital, the QEII Health Sciences Centre, and IWK Health Centre).

====Communities and neighbourhoods====

Halifax is geographically large, and there are over 200 official communities and neighbourhoods within the municipality. They vary from rural to urban. The former town of Bedford, and the former cities of Dartmouth and Halifax have maintained their original geographic names. Furthermore, communities that were suburban, or even rural before 1996, now have become more urban and have attained &quot;community&quot; status (e.g. Cole Harbour, Lower Sackville, Spryfield, et cetera). These community names are used on survey and mapping documents, for 9-1-1 service, municipal planning, and postal service.

Before the amalgamation of Halifax in 1996, and since its restructure as a municipality, the growth of Halifax has gradually increased. Many of the present day communities within the conurbation have morphed from being primarily rural in the recent past, to now primarily urban. With the demographic change and growth of many communities within urban Halifax, their function and role within the conurbation has changed. With this continuous growth, many of the current communities have developed &quot;de facto&quot; business districts where residents of their respective communities (and their respective environs) can access products and services without travelling long distances (e.g. to Downtown Dartmouth or to Downtown Halifax).

====Community planning areas====

Currently, the municipality is divided into 21 community planning areas which are further divided into neighbourhoods. The regional municipality has taken steps to reduce duplicate street names for its 9-1-1 emergency dispatch services; at the time of amalgamation, some street names were duplicated several times throughout the municipality.

Current planning areas:
*Beaver Bank, Hammonds Plains, and Upper Sackville
*Bedford
*Cole Harbour/Westphal
*Dartmouth
*Eastern Passage/Cow Bay
*Eastern Shore (East)
*Eastern Shore (West)
*Downtown Halifax
*Halifax
*Lawrencetown
*Musquodoboit Valley/Dutch Settlement
*North Preston, Lake Major, Lake Loon, Cherry Brook, and East Preston
*Planning Districts 1 &amp; 3 (St. Margaret&#x27;s Bay)
*Planning District 4 (Prospect)
*Planning District 5 (Chebucto Peninsula)
*Planning Districts 8 &amp; 9 (Lake Echo/Porters Lake)
*Planning Districts 14 &amp; 17 (Shubenacadie Lakes)
*Regional Centre Plan Area
*Sackville
*Sackville Drive
*Timberlea/Lakeside/Beechville

===Rural landscape===
Halifax is centred on the urban core and surrounded by areas of decreasing population density. Rural areas lie to the east, west and north of the urban core. The Atlantic Ocean lies to the south. Certain rural communities on the urban fringe function as suburban or exurban areas, with the majority of those residents commuting to and working in the urban core.

Farther away, rural communities in the municipality function like any resource-based area in Nova Scotia, being sparsely populated and their local economies based on four major resource industries: agriculture, in the Musquodoboit Valley, fishing, along the coast, mining, in the Musquodoboit Valley and in Moose River Gold Mines and forestry, in most areas outside the urban core. Also, the tourism industry is beginning to change how some rural communities in Halifax function, particularly in communities such as Hubbards, Peggys Cove, with its notable lighthouse and Lawrencetown, with Lawrencetown Beach. There are two other large beaches along the coast, Martinique Beach, near Musquodoboit Harbour and Taylor Head Beach, located in Spry Bay, within the boundaries of Taylor Head Provincial Park.

The northeastern area of the municipality, centred on Sheet Harbour and the Musquodoboit Valley, is completely rural, with the area sharing more in common with the adjacent rural areas of neighbouring Guysborough, Pictou and Colchester counties. Most economic activity in the Musquodoboit Valley is based on agriculture, as it is the largest farming district in the municipality. Most coastal communities are based on the fishing industry. Forestry is active in this area as well. It is also prevalent in the Musquodoboit Valley, but it takes a backseat to the more prominent agricultural industry.

===Urban landscape===
At , Halifax&#x27;s urban area (defined as &quot;population centre&quot; by Statistics Canada) is less than five percent of the municipal land area. The area surrounds Halifax Harbour and its main centres are Bedford, Dartmouth, and Halifax (and their respective environs).

Between the 2016 Canadian Census and the 2021 Canadian Census, the built-up area of Halifax grew by from in 2016 to 23,829 hectares (238.29 km2) in 2021.

==Culture==

Halifax is a major cultural centre within the Atlantic provinces. The municipality has maintained many of its maritime and military traditions, while opening itself to a growing multicultural population. The municipality&#x27;s urban core also benefits from a large population of post-secondary students who strongly influence the local cultural scene. Halifax has a number of art galleries, theatres and museums, as well as most of the region&#x27;s national-quality sports and entertainment facilities. Halifax is also the home to many of the region&#x27;s major cultural attractions, such as Halifax Pop Explosion, Symphony Nova Scotia, the Art Gallery of Nova Scotia, The Khyber, the Maritime Museum of the Atlantic and the Neptune Theatre. The region is noted for the strength of its music scene and nightlife, especially within the urban communities; see List of musical groups from Halifax, Nova Scotia for a partial list.
Halifax hosts a wide variety of festivals that take place throughout the year, including; the largest Canada Day celebration east of Ottawa, the Atlantic Film Festival, the Halifax International Busker Festival, Greekfest, Atlantic Jazz Festival, the Multicultural Festival, Natal Day, Nocturne Festival, the Halifax Pop Explosion, periodic Tall Ship events, the Royal Nova Scotia International Tattoo, and Shakespeare by the Sea—to name a few. Halifax Pride is the largest LGBT event in Atlantic Canada and one of the largest in the country. Many of Halifax&#x27;s festivals and annual events have become world-renowned over the past several years.

Halifax is home to many performance venues, namely the Music Room, the Neptune Theatre, and Rebecca Cohn Auditorium. The Neptune Theatre, established in the 1960s and located on Argyle Street, is Halifax&#x27;s largest theatre. It performs an assortment of professionally produced plays year-round. The Shakespeare by the Sea theatre company performs at nearby Point Pleasant Park. Eastern Front Theatre performs at Alderney Landing in Downtown Dartmouth which can easily be accessed via the Halifax Transit ferry service. There are smaller performance venues at the Halifax Central Library, Citadel High School (Spatz Theatre), and Halifax West High School (Bella Rose Arts Centre).

Halifax has also become a significant film production centre, with many American and Canadian filmmakers using the streetscapes, often to stand in for other cities that are more expensive to work in. The Canadian Broadcasting Corporation has its Atlantic Canada production centres (radio and television) based in Halifax, and quite a number of radio and television programs are made in the region for national broadcast. In 2020, filming began on the series Pub Crawl, which explores the historically significant bars of Halifax.

In addition to the Atlantic International Film Festival, the independent Carbon Arc Cinema programs a number of smaller specialty film festivals each year alongside a weekly program of rep cinema films at the Nova Scotia Museum of Natural History.

The new Halifax Central Library on Spring Garden Road has received accolades for its architecture and has been described as a new cultural locus, offering many community facilities including a 300-seat auditorium.

===Architecture===

Halifax&#x27;s urban core is home to a number of regional landmark buildings and retains significant historic buildings and districts. Downtown office towers are overlooked by the fortress of Citadel Hill with its iconic Halifax Town Clock.

The architecture of Halifax&#x27;s South End is renowned for its grand Victorian houses while the West End and North End, Halifax have many blocks of well-preserved wooden residential houses with notable features such as the &quot;Halifax Porch&quot;. Dalhousie University&#x27;s campus is often featured in films and documentaries. Surrounding areas of the municipality, including Dartmouth and Bedford, also possess their share of historic neighbourhoods and properties.

The urban core is home to several blocks of typical North American high-rise office buildings; however, segments of the downtown are governed by height restrictions, known as &quot;view planes legislation&quot;, which prevent buildings from obstructing certain sight lines between Citadel Hill and the Halifax Harbour. This has resulted in some modern high rises being built at unusual angles or locations.

===Public spaces===
The Halifax area has a variety of public spaces, ranging from urban gardens, public squares, expansive forested parks, and historic sites. The original grid plan devised when Halifax was founded in 1749 included a central military parade square, the Grand Parade. The square hosts the City Hall at one end, and is a popular site for concerts, political demonstrations, as well as the annual Remembrance Day ceremony at the central cenotaph. Another popular downtown public space is the timber Halifax Boardwalk, which stretches approximately and is integrated with several squares and monuments.

The Halifax Common, granted for the use of citizens in 1763, is Canada&#x27;s oldest public park. Centrally located on the Halifax peninsula, the wide fields are a popular location for sports. The slopes of Citadel Hill, overlooking downtown, are favoured by sunbathers and kite-flyers. The Halifax Public Gardens, a short walk away, are Victorian era public gardens formally established in 1867 and designated a National Historic Site in 1984. Victoria Park, across the street, contains various monuments and statues erected by the North British Society, as well as a fountain. In contrast to the urban parks, the expansive Point Pleasant Park at the southern tip of the peninsula is heavily forested and contains the remains of numerous British fortifications.
Located on the opposite side of the harbour, the Dartmouth Commons is a large park next to Downtown Dartmouth laid out in the 1700s. It is home to the Leighton Dillman gardens and various sports grounds. Nearby, the Dartmouth waterfront trail stretches from Downtown Dartmouth to Woodside. Among residents of central Dartmouth, the area around Sullivan&#x27;s Pond and Lake Banook is popular for strolling and paddling. The forested Shubie Park, through which the historic Shubenacadie Canal runs, is a major park in suburban Dartmouth.

Mainland Halifax is home to several significant parks, including Sir Sandford Fleming Park, gifted to the people of Halifax by Sir Sandford Fleming. It houses the Dingle Tower, dedicated in 1912 by the Duke of Connaught to commemorate 150 years of representative government in Nova Scotia. The Mainland Common, in Clayton Park, is a modern park home to various sports and community facilities. Long Lake Provincial Park, comprising more than 2,000 hectares, was designated in 1984 and affords Halifax residents access to a scenic wilderness in close proximity to the urban communities.

===Tourism===

Halifax&#x27;s tourism industry showcases Nova Scotia&#x27;s culture, scenery and coastline. There are several museums and art galleries in downtown Halifax. The Canadian Museum of Immigration at Pier 21, an immigrant entry point prominent throughout the 1930s, 1940s, and 1950s, was opened to the public as a National Historic Site of Canada in 1999 and is the only national museum in the Atlantic provinces. The Maritime Museum of the Atlantic is a maritime museum containing extensive galleries including a large exhibit on the famous , over 70 small craft and a steamship . In summertime the preserved World War II corvette operates as a museum ship and Canada&#x27;s naval memorial. The Art Gallery of Nova Scotia is housed in a 150-year-old building containing nearly 19,000 works of art. The Black Cultural Centre for Nova Scotia in Dartmouth reflects the region&#x27;s rich ethnic heritage.

Halifax has numerous National Historic Sites, most notably Citadel Hill (Fort George). Just outside the urban area, the iconic Peggys Cove is internationally recognized and receives more than 600,000 visitors a year.

The waterfront in Downtown Halifax is the site of the Halifax Harbourwalk, a boardwalk popular among tourists and locals alike. Many mid-sized ships dock here at one of the many wharfs. The harbourwalk is home to a Halifax Transit ferry terminal, hundreds of stores, Historic Properties, several office buildings, the Casino Nova Scotia, and several public squares where buskers perform, most prominently at the annual Halifax International Busker Festival every August.

Downtown Halifax, home to many small shops and vendors, is a major shopping area. It is also home to several shopping centres, including Scotia Square, Barrington Place Shops, and Maritime Mall. Numerous malls on Spring Garden Road, including the Park Lane Mall, are also located nearby. The area is home to approximately 200 restaurants and bars, offering a wide array of world cuisines. There are also more than 60 sidewalk cafes that open in the summer months. The nightlife is made up of bars and small music venues as well as Casino Nova Scotia, a large facility built partially over the water.

* Hakodate, Japan (1982). The cities chose to twin because they both have star forts and are both maritime ports. Halifax has donated many fir trees to the annual Hakodate Christmas Fantasy festival.
* Campeche, Mexico (1999). Campeche was chosen because, like Halifax, it is &quot;a capital of a state&quot; and is &quot;a city of similar size to Halifax on or near the coast having rich historical tradition&quot;.
* Norfolk, Virginia, United States (2006). Norfolk was chosen because, like Halifax, its economy &quot;depends heavily on the presence of the Armed Forces, and both cities are very proud of their military history&quot;.

<text>Strange Highways is the sixth studio album by American heavy metal band Dio. It&#x27;s also their first album since Ronnie James Dio and Vinny Appice&#x27;s reunion tour with Black Sabbath. The European release was on Vertigo Records, in October 1993; the U.S. release was on Reprise Records, in January 1994.

After the short-lived reunion with Black Sabbath for the recording of the album &quot;Dehumanizer&quot; (1992) and the subsequent tour, Dio and Appice returned to Dio&#x27;s solo group, hiring Tracy Grijalva as new guitarist. Former Dio bassist Jimmy Bain was to make a return to the band, but he was soon sacked by Dio and replaced by Jeff Pilson.

&quot;Hollywood Black&quot; was demoed by Black Sabbath during the &quot;Dehumanizer&quot; sessions. &quot;Whether it&#x27;s the same, I don&#x27;t know…&quot; Tony Iommi remarked of Dio&#x27;s version (before hearing it). &quot;Could be the same lyrics – probably is. I wouldn&#x27;t think he would use the same music.&quot;

<doc id="731853" wikidata="Q7868648" url="?curid=731853" title="USS Crommelin">
<text>USS &quot;Crommelin&quot; (FFG-37), twenty-eighth ship of the of guided-missile frigates, was named for five brothers: Rear Admiral John G. Crommelin (1902–1996), Vice Admiral Henry Crommelin (1904–1971), Commander Charles L. Crommelin (1909–1945), Lieutenant Commander Richard Crommelin (1917–1945), and Captain Quentin C. Crommelin (1919–1997). The Crommelin brothers were the only group of five siblings ever to graduate from the United States Naval Academy. Four of them became pilots, and Time magazine dubbed them &quot;The Indestructibles.&quot; The brothers saw action in more than ten campaigns in the Pacific Theater. Henry, the second-oldest, became a Surface Warfare Officer while Richard and Charles died in combat as naval aviators in 1945. Individually and as a fighting family, they gained fame in World War II, attaining outstanding combat records and multiple decorations. &quot;Crommelin&quot; (FFG-37) is the first ship of that name in the United States Navy.
Ordered from Todd Pacific Shipyard, Seattle, Washington on 27 April 1979 as part of the Fiscal year 1979 program, &quot;Crommelin&quot; was laid down on 30 May 1980, launched on 2 July 1981, and commissioned on 18 June 1983.

After three decades of service, &quot;Crommelin&quot; was decommissioned in a ceremony at Pearl Harbor, 26 October 2012. It had rescued 96 people from the high seas and seized roughly $1.25 billion worth of cocaine over its lifetime.

==Operational history==

&quot;Crommelin&quot; was assigned to Destroyer Squadron 9 and reached its homeport of Long Beach, California in August 1983. Underway from Long Beach on 1 October 1984 to join Battle Group &#x27;DELTA&#x27; for COMPTUEX 85-1, HSL-41, Detachment ONE embarked.

On 14 January 1985, the ship was underway from San Diego for READIEX 85-1, the second major fleet exercise for LAMPS MK III, Helicopter Anti-Submarine Squadron Light, Four Three, Detachment ONE embarked USS Crommelin. At sea commander of Battle Group DELTA, Rear Admiral Leon A Edney, USN, Commander Carrier Group 1, embarked aboard the aircraft carrier . Later that year Battle Group Delta, the &quot;Constellation&quot; Battle Group, deployed to the western Pacific and Indian Oceans. During this deployment, &quot;Crommelin&quot; became the first guided missile frigate to successfully engage a high-speed, maneuvering target with missiles. Just before reaching Naval Station Subic Bay, the Philippines, &quot;Crommelin&quot; changed command in the presence of Commander, Carrier Group 1, and Commander, Destroyer Squadron 17. It was also the first ship to complete an operational deployment with the LAMPS MK III weapon system. In June 1986, &quot;Crommelin&quot; received the first Chief of Naval Operations LAMPS MK III Safety Award.

In the summer of 1986, &quot;Crommelin&quot; was awarded every departmental and divisional excellence award and won its first Navy &quot;E&quot; award. In 1987, &quot;Crommelin&quot; was assigned to Destroyer Squadron 13 and began an accelerated deployment with the &quot;Constellation&quot; battle group. &quot;Crommelin&quot; was the first FFG to deploy with two LAMPS MK III helicopters embarked. &quot;Crommelin&quot; was assigned to Commander, Middle East Force from 1 July to 25 August 1987, earning a Meritorious Unit Commendation and Armed Forces Expeditionary Medal for the convoy escort of the first five reflagged Kuwaiti tankers in Operation Earnest Will.

On 1 January 1988, &quot;Crommelin&quot; was reassigned to Destroyer Squadron 9, and on 6 March 1988, the ship received a second consecutive Navy &quot;E&quot; award. Upon completion of its second availability period at Todd Pacific Shipyard, &quot;Crommelin&quot; was deployed in March 1989 again to the Persian Gulf. In October 1990 &quot;Crommelin&quot; was deployed in support of joint service, counternarcotics operations in the Central, South American, and Caribbean theater. &quot;Crommelin&quot; was awarded the Joint Meritorious Unit Award for its performance during this deployment. In 1991, &quot;Crommelin&quot; received the Navy &quot;E&quot; as well as its fifth consecutive warfare excellence awards for anti-air and anti-surface warfare, navigation and seamanship, damage control, engineering, and communications. On 1 September 1991, &quot;Crommelin&quot; shifted homeports to Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, and joined Destroyer Squadron 31.

&quot;Crommelin&quot; completed a second four-month counternarcotics deployment in the Central, South American and Caribbean theater from November 1992 to March 1993. Upon return to its homeport of Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, &quot;Crommelin&quot; was assigned to Commander Naval Surface Group, Middle Pacific.

From 6 July to 14 December 1994, &quot;Crommelin&quot; was assigned to the battle group in the Western Pacific for Korean contingency operations. There, &quot;Crommelin&quot; received the Meritorious Unit Commendation Award for the prosecution of a Chinese Han class submarine. Upon completion of this deployment she underwent dry-docking SRA-5 at Pearl Harbor Naval Shipyard, following which she began the cycle for her 1996 Western Pacific deployment with the battle group.

After a three-month work up cycle, &quot;Crommelin&quot; deployed with the &quot;Carl Vinson&quot; battle group on 20 May 1996. This deployment took &quot;Crommelin&quot; and her crew back to the Persian Gulf for a variety of missions, including escorting ships through the Straits of Hormuz, patrolling the Northern Persian Gulf, and conducting maritime interception operations. &quot;Crommelin&quot; returned from that deployment on 20 November 1996.

Following WESTPAC 96, &quot;Crommelin&quot; entered SRA-6 from January to March 1997. &quot;Crommelin&quot; received upgrades to all major weapons systems as well as the engineering plant. Following this availability, &quot;Crommelin&quot; and her crew began yet another work up cycle to prepare for her fifth deployment to the Persian Gulf as part of the U.S. 5th Fleet. &quot;Crommelin&quot; departed Pearl Harbor on 21 February 1998. During this deployment &quot;Crommelin&quot; distinguished herself by setting a Fifth Fleet record for number of vessels boarded and tonnage of illegal Iraqi petroleum seized and diverted.

&quot;Crommelin&quot; completed a demanding nine-week private sector SRA in early 1999, where she made major repairs and upgrades throughout the ship. Immediately following the SRA, &quot;Crommelin&quot; aggressively entered the inter-deployment training cycle and proceeded to set numerous records throughout her training. Chief among these was condensing what is normally a twelve-week training cycle into nine weeks. Other achievements were completing cruise missile test qualification on the first day of training and completing engineering qualification with 100% of drills and 28 of 29 evolutions graded as &quot;satisfactory&quot;.

With her training cycle complete, &quot;Crommelin&quot; departed Pearl Harbor on 24 August 1999 for a three-month deployment to the Eastern Pacific in support of counter narcotics operations. During this deployment, &quot;Crommelin&quot; steamed 77 of 92 days, flew more than 350 mishap-free SH-60B flight hours, and was a key player in four major cocaine seizures. Upon her return to Pearl Harbor on 24 November 1999, &quot;Crommelin&quot; immediately began the work up cycle for her next deployment with the battle group in August 2000.

In February 2000, &quot;Crommelin&quot; was awarded the Battle &quot;E&quot; for Destroyer Squadron 31 as well as each of the four command excellence awards. Other accomplishments included the 1999 Commander in Chief, Pacific Fleet Retention Excellence Award, 1999, Commander, Naval Surface Forces Pacific (COMNAVSURFPAC) Surface Ship Safety Award, COMNAVSURFPAC Self-Sufficient Ship of the Quarter Award (Q4 FY99 and Q2 FY00), and the distinction of being the first Pearl Harbor ship to hoist the Enlisted Surface Warfare Specialist Pennant.

During WESTPAC 2000, eighteen non-compliant vessels were boarded by &quot;Crommelin&quot;″s Visit Board Search and Seizure Team, twelve were found to be smuggling petroleum products from Iraq and diverted to friendly ports for disposal of the ships and their illegal cargo. On the eve of the homecoming from deployment, &quot;Crommelin&quot; received her second consecutive Battle Efficiency Award.

From 18 April 2001 to June 2001, &quot;Crommelin&quot; was dry-docked at Pearl Harbor Naval Shipyard for Dry-dock Selected Restricted Availability. In January 2002 &quot;Crommelin&quot; received the 2001 COMNAVSURFPAC Surface Ship Safety Award.

From 12 May 2004 to 12 November 2004, &quot;Crommelin&quot; was deployed to the SOUTHPAC AOR with Coast Guard Law Enforcement Detachment (LEDET) 105 in support of the war on drugs, conducting counter-narcotics operations in the Pacific Ocean and Caribbean Sea. In that time, she became the most second most successful counter-narcotics ship with the seizure of of cocaine, including 26,369 pounds from the Belize-flagged vessel San Jose on 23 September 2004. She held that record until the bust of the Panamanian flagged motor vessel Gatun off the coast of Panama in March 2007, carrying approximately of cocaine. During this deployment, America&#x27;s Battle Frigate also participated in exercises UNITAS-04 and PANAMAX-04, training the Navies and Coast Guards of various Central- and South-American countries in counter-narcotics and counter-terrorism tactics at sea.

From 5 May 2006 to 15 September 2006, she participated in CARAT-06, along with , , and . In that time, Task Group 73.1 trained the Navies of several Southeast Asian countries in Maritime boarding and counter-terrorism tactics. Upon returning to home port, she entered an intensive dry dock period and as of May 2007, is preparing herself for continued operations in the wars on terror and drugs.

In November 2007 &quot;Crommelin&quot; Deployed to the Southcom AOR insupport of CounterNarco-Terrorism Ops (CNT-OPS). On Christmas Eve 2007 &quot;Crommelin&quot; stopped a &#x27;go-fast&#x27; drug runner near the coast of Columbia carrying of cocaine. &quot;Crommelin&quot; boarded close to 20 vessels involved in drug running operations during her 7-month deployment. Nearing the end of the deployment the frigate was awaiting the arrival of the aircraft carrier into the Eastern Pacific AOR for a refueling operation. As the two ships came alongside each other &quot;George Washington&quot; had a major fire break out onboard damaging 92 spaces within as well as shutting down part of their nuclear reactor. She quickly made for San Diego to conduct repairs while &quot;Crommelin&quot; was left short on food and even lower on fuel. The frigate had to make an emergency stop in Mexico to refuel both food and fuel to make it back to Hawaii in June 2008. After a successful deployment &quot;Crommelin&quot; entered dry dock in October 2008 for repairs to keep her operational throughout the next decade. In 2010, &quot;Crommelin&quot; was again awarded the Battle &quot;E&quot; for Destroyer Squadron 31.

&quot;Crommelin&quot; was decommissioned ahead of schedule at a ceremony in Pearl Harbor, 26 October 2012. &quot;Crommelin&quot;″s last contribution was as a SINKEX target ship during the major multi-nation naval exercise RIMPAC 2016. attempted to hit &quot;Crommelin&quot; with the first ever LCS-launched Harpoon surface-to-surface missile. However, the weapon missed. &quot;Crommelin&quot; succumbed to multiple hits from other SINKEX participants and sank later in the evening on 19 July 2016. Her final resting place is approximately .

==Ship&#x27;s crest==
The colors blue and gold are traditionally associated with the U.S. Navy. The three interlaced chevronels represent the Crommelin brothers after whom the ship is named. The two winged chevronels refer to the air exploits of Lieutenant Commander Richard and Commander Charles Crommelin who served and died as Naval aviators. The central chevronel over which an anchor is placed alludes to the surface ship career of Vice Admiral Henry Crommelin, the second-oldest and first to serve of the brothers.

The linked chevronels suggest the strength and determination of U.S. naval forces in their efforts to regain enemy held territories of the Pacific Ocean throughout World War II. It was in this effort that the Crommelin brothers so distinguished themselves.

The rampant sea lion is a symbolic creature associated with valor at sea; its head and mane are scarlet for courage and its body is gold for zeal and achievement. The scarlet sword recalls the fierce conflict of the Pacific war. The wings and silver collar with blue cross signify some of the decorations the brothers received, such as the Navy Cross, the Silver Star and the Distinguished Flying Cross.

<doc id="731854" wikidata="Q382492" url="?curid=731854" title="Thomas Green Clemson">
<text>Thomas Green Clemson (July 1, 1807April 6, 1888) was an American politician and statesman, serving as Chargés d&#x27;Affaires to Belgium, and United States Superintendent of Agriculture. He served in the Confederate Army and founded Clemson University in South Carolina. Historians have called Clemson &quot;a quintessential nineteenth-century Renaissance man.&quot; He was an owner of enslaved persons. 

== Life and education ==
Born in Philadelphia, Clemson was the son of Thomas Green Clemson III and Elizabeth Baker. He was descended from Quaker roots, and his mother was Episcopalian. His first ancestor in America was James Clemson I, who emigrated from Tettenhall, England, to the British American Colonies. Partly because of this mixed religious background, Clemson&#x27;s personal religious belief is not well documented. In 1813, his father died, and his father&#x27;s second cousin, John Gest, was appointed guardian over him and his five siblings. Clemson was one beneficiary of his father&#x27;s life savings of $100,000 
($ today), which was split among him and his siblings. Little is known about his home life, but his schooling started in the winter of 1814, as he, as well as the older Clemsons, attended day school at Tabernacle Presbyterian Church. There is no knowledge as to exactly how long Thomas attended day school, but from 1823 to 1825, Clemson was educated at Alden Partridge&#x27;s Military Academy in Vermont, also known as Norwich University. Clemson&#x27;s older brother, who had recently graduated from Princeton, sent Thomas a letter outlining the courses and subjects that he should study. He completed those studies sometime in late 1825, and returned to Philadelphia in 1825, where he started studying Mineralogy. Sometime in 1826 Clemson left for Paris, France.

=== Paris, France ===
His departure date, the ship name, and where he landed in France are unknown. Among the few surviving documents of his time in Paris is a letter that he wrote to his mother; it did not include anything about his scientific study, but did vaguely reference that he had a particular interest in expanding his knowledge. In addition, the letter states that if he were to die, all of his wealth should be left to his mother and then, after her death, it would be left to any of his unmarried sisters. In 1826–27, he expanded his knowledge of practical laboratory chemistry while working with chemist Gaultier de Clowbry and furthered his chemistry study by working with other Parisian chemists. He further trained at Sorbonne and the Royal School of Mines. He received his diploma as an assayer from the Royal Mint. In 1829, Clemson wrote a letter to Benjamin Silliman, M.D., about his research of iron ore. The date of his return to Philadelphia is unknown.

In 1843, Thomas purchased a 1,000-acre plot of land in the Edgefield district in South Carolina. Named &quot;Canebrake&quot; (for the vast dense and thick canes along the riverbank), the land had an estimated value of $24,000.

=== Diplomat ===
With knowledge of both French and German, Clemson served as U.S. Chargé d&#x27;affaires to Belgium from October 4, 1844 until January 8, 1852. He received the position largely due to his father in-law John C. Calhoun, then Secretary of State under the Tyler Administration. President Tyler had given the task of filling the position to Calhoun, who quickly nominated his son in-law Clemson. Clemson was more than qualified to serve in this position for the government. From his time spent in Paris studying, he picked up on European culture and their way of living. In addition, the time there also gave him a feel for continental problems and thinking. With his extensive knowledge of not just Belgium&#x27;s but the Europe&#x27;s economics, politics, and social life, he was better able to connect the United States to Belgium and other European countries. The U.S. and Belgium signed a treaty during his time as chargé: the Treaty of Commerce and Navigation, which removed trade and tariff restrictions between the two countries for 10 years, boosting commerce. Clemson was awarded the Order of Leopold by King Leopold I during his time as chargé.

His South Carolina plot was not profitable while Clemson was abroad in Belgium, but he used the time to further his studies in the field of agriculture. He translated from French the lengthy article &quot;Extraction of Sugar from the Beet,&quot; written by Louis Melsens, a professor at the Royal Veterinary School of Cureghem.

=== Agricultural research ===
Upon his return from Belgium, Clemson chose to live in Maryland, not too far from Washington, D.C., for access to utilities and resources for his research, studies, and experiments. In 1853, he purchased a 100-acre plot in what is now Mount Rainier, Maryland, which he called &quot;The Home.&quot; His studies in agricultural chemistry led to findings that were published in &quot;The American Farmer&quot; and other scientific journals. He attended the meetings of both the Maryland and the United States Agricultural Societies. Among other projects, he studied the cattle disease Texas Fever, demonstrating that cattle moving from the North to the South contracted the disease, whereas cattle going from the South to the North transmitted the disease. His findings and distinction as a scientist led to his invitation to speak at the Smithsonian Institution in Washington in 1858. Clemson was active in the field of agricultural research for many years to come, as more of his documents became published.

From 1860 to 1861, Clemson served in the Buchanan administration as Superintendent of Agriculture.

=== American Civil War ===
As the threat of civil war became a reality, Clemson resigned this post on March 4, 1861. He stood on the side of his adopted state. Following the firing on Fort Sumter on April 12, 1861, Clemson left Maryland for South Carolina. In Pendleton on November 2, 1861, Clemson spoke to the Farmers Society and publicly &quot;Urged the establishment of a department of agriculture in the government of the Confederate States which, in addition to fostering the general interest of agriculture, would also serve as a sort of university for the diffusion of scientific knowledge and the improvement of agriculture.&quot;

Fifty-four-year-old Clemson, enlisted in the Confederate States Army and was assigned to the Army of the Trans-Mississippi Department. Clemson worked in Arkansas and Texas developing nitrate mines for explosives. He was paroled on June 9, 1865, at Shreveport, Louisiana, after four years of service. His son, Captain John Calhoun Clemson, also enlisted in the Confederate States Army and spent two years in a Union prison camp on Johnson&#x27;s Island, in Lake Erie, Ohio. He was a first lieutenant in the Confederate Army.

== Marriage and family ==
On November 13, 1838, at the age of 31, Clemson married Anna Maria Calhoun, daughter of John C. Calhoun, the noted Senator from South Carolina and 7th Vice President of the United States and Floride Calhoun. After Calhoun&#x27;s death, Floride Calhoun, Anna Calhoun Clemson, and two other Calhoun children inherited the Fort Hill plantation near Pendleton, South Carolina. It was sold for $49,000 (~$ in ) to Calhoun&#x27;s oldest son, Andrew Pickens Calhoun, in 1854. After the war and upon Andrew&#x27;s death in 1865, Floride Calhoun foreclosed on his heirs before her death in 1866. After lengthy legal procedures, Fort Hill was auctioned in 1872. The executor of her estate won the auction, which was divided among her surviving heirs. Her daughter, Anna Clemson, received the residence with about 814 acres (329.6 ha) and her great granddaughter, Floride Isabella Lee, received about 288 acres (116.6 ha). Thomas Green and Anna Clemson moved into Fort Hill in 1872. After Anna&#x27;s death in 1875, Thomas Green Clemson inherited Fort Hill and lived there until his death. He died on April 6, 1888, and is buried in St. Paul&#x27;s Episcopal churchyard in Pendleton, South Carolina.

=== Children ===
Thomas Green Clemson and his wife Anna Calhoun Clemson had four children. Their first child, whose name is not known, died as an infant in 1839. In 1841, John Calhoun Clemson was born. Shortly after in 1842, Anna Clemson gave birth to her daughter Floride Elizabeth Clemson. At age 15, John was getting treatment for a spinal condition in Northampton, Massachusetts. Another child, Cornelia &quot;Nina&quot; Clemson, was born in October 1855; she died in 1858 of scarlet fever. On July 23, 1871, their daughter Floride died. Clemson&#x27;s only son John died three weeks later, on August 10, 1871.

== Founding Clemson University ==
Outliving his wife and his children, Clemson drafted a final in the mid-1880s. The will called for the establishment of a land-grant institution called The Clemson Agricultural College of South Carolina upon the property of the Fort Hill estate. He believed that education, especially scientific education, leads to economic prosperity. He wanted to start an agricultural college because he felt that government officials did not appreciate the importance of agricultural education.

Although the college was de facto an all-white, all-male college when it opened, Clemson did not explicitly ban women or African-Americans from attending, unlike the founders of Vanderbilt, Tulane, Rice and other southern universities. However, Clemson&#x27;s intent was no secret: he created the university because he believed South Carolina needed &quot;an institution that vandal hands could not pollute,&quot; that is, a university that did not allow both blacks and whites to attend.

The military college, founded in 1889, opened its doors in 1893 to 446 cadets. Clemson Agricultural College was renamed Clemson University in 1964. A statue of Thomas Green Clemson, as well as the Fort Hill house, are located on the campus. The town of Calhoun that bordered the campus was renamed Clemson in 1943.

<doc id="731859" wikidata="Q7868685" url="?curid=731859" title="USS Curts">
<text>USS &quot;Curts&quot; (FFG-38)was the twenty-ninth ship of the of guided-missile frigates. She was named for Admiral Maurice Curts (1898–1976). &quot;Curts&quot; is the first ship of that name in the US Navy.

Ordered from Todd Pacific Shipyards, Los Angeles Division, San Pedro, California on 27 April 1979 as part of the FY79 program, &quot;Curts&quot; was laid down on 1 July 1981, launched on 6 March 1982, and commissioned on 8 October 1983. She was decommissioned on 25 January 2013.

== Service history ==

=== 1980s ===
&quot;Curts&quot;″s early years in commission were focused on anti-submarine warfare (ASW) operations and &quot;Curts&quot; was the first Pacific Fleet unit with the complete SQQ-89 ASW suite. The ship received the meritorious unit commendation for tactical proficiency in the tracking of Soviet submarines in 1987.

In 1988, &quot;Curts&quot; received the armed forces expeditionary medal for serving with the battle group during Operation Earnest Will in the north Arabian Sea and the Gulf of Oman. Additionally, &quot;Curts&quot; changed homeport to Yokosuka, Japan, becoming one of the first two guided-missile frigates to join the Forward Deployed Naval Force (FDNF). &quot;Curts&quot; was first to bring SH-60B LAMPS MK III helicopters to Naval Air Facility Atsugi.

=== Operation Desert Storm ===
On 24 January 1991, during Operation Desert Storm, the ship and her embarked navy and army helicopters captured an Iraqi garrison on Qaruh Island in the northern Persian Gulf, taking the island and custody of 51 Iraqi prisoners. &quot;Curts&quot; destroyed two mines, sank an Iraqi minelayer and provided support to combat helicopter operations during the battle of Bubiyan Island. The ship received the navy unit commendation for her exceptional operational performance.

=== 1990s ===
Upon return from combat operations in June 1991, the ship became an important part of Operation Fiery Vigil rescuing numerous refugees to safety when Mount Pinatubo erupted near Subic Bay, Republic of The Philippines.

In 1993, &quot;Curts&quot; was upgraded with the 4100-ton class modification, extending her stern another and enhancing her combat capabilities. [The information about extending her stern by 8 feet was probably sourced from the DANFS history, which is not always 100% accurate. &quot;Curts&quot; was built as a long-hull FFG-7, which were 8 feet longer than the short hull versions, so this is unlikely]. &quot;Curts&quot; joined the Battle Group in 1993 to participate with the Japanese Maritime Self-Defense Force in joint anti-submarine warfare exercise MAREX. Later that year, the ship deployed to the Persian Gulf conducting 89 boardings of merchant vessels in the Red Sea as part of United Nations sanctions enforcement against Iraq. &quot;Curts&quot; material and operational readiness was rewarded with the battle efficiency award for 1994.

In 1994, &quot;Curts&quot; participated in the RIMPAC 94 exercise and sailed from its homeport in Yokosuka, Japan to Honolulu, Hawaii to participate with International Navies from around the Pacific, including Japan, Korea, Canada and more.

In 1995, &quot;Curts&quot; participated in major joint exercises with units of the U.S. Navy and Japanese Maritime Self-Defense Force (JMSDF), and later with the navies of Singapore, Malaysia, and Thailand for 1996 cooperation afloat for readiness and training (CARAT 96).

In 1997, after nine years of forward presence as part of the seventh fleet, &quot;Curts&quot; departed Yokosuka, Japan for a homeport change to San Diego, California and in October 1998 &quot;Curts&quot; joined the Naval Reserve Force (NRF).

In 1998, &quot;Curts&quot; deployed to the multi-lateral exercise Teamwork South, where she participated in exercises with navies from the United Kingdom, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru and Chile. Upon completion of Teamwork South, &quot;Curts&quot; steamed to Hawaii to participate in multi-lateral exercise RIMPAC 98. &quot;Curts&quot; made national headlines when a Salinas, Ecuador hotel security guard died from injuries he received during a scuffle with a LTJG (pilot) and Senior Chief Petty Officer assigned to helicopter squadron HSL-43 embarked on &quot;Curts&quot; for the deployment. Both men were removed from the ship and returned to the U.S. to face a court martial.

In 1999, &quot;Curts&quot; deployed to counter-narco-terrorism deployment under the direction of Joint Inter-agency Task Force East (now named Joint Interagency Task Force South). In addition to seizing approximately 5 metric tons of cocaine, &quot;Curts&quot; conducted rare bi-lateral counter-narcotics exercises with the Colombian Navy. After departing a short visit to Aruba &quot;Curts&quot; responded to a distress call from M/V &quot;Olga&quot;, north of the Guajira Peninsula. &quot;Curts&quot; crew were awarded the Humanitarian Service Medal for joint rescue efforts that saved the lives of several &quot;Olga&quot; crew members. The half-way point of this deployment found &quot;Curts&quot; celebrating Halloween in Key West, Christmas in St. Thomas and New Years again in Key West, Florida. The timing of this deployment also caused &quot;Curts&quot; to be the last U.S. warship to transit the Panama Canal under U.S. control in 1999 (ex- was towed through just before &quot;Curts&quot; transit) and the first to transit it under Panamanian control in 2000.

=== 2000s ===
During CARAT cruises in 2001 and 2003, &quot;Curts&quot; conducted multilateral exercises with the navies of Singapore, Thailand, Brunei, and the Philippines to continue promoting international training and cooperation.

In 2004 &quot;Curts&quot; again deployed to southern command on a six-month counter-narcotics deployment with Coast Guard Law Enforcement Detachment (LEDET) 105 and received national notoriety for the largest maritime seizure of cocaine (12 tons) in history. The ship received the U.S. Coast Guard Meritorious Unit Commendation for her outstanding performance during deployment.

&quot;Curts&quot; deployed again in 2006 to counter-narco-terrorism deployment. Although less successful than the 2004 deployment, &quot;Curts&quot; interdicted three cocaine shipments, totalling in excess of 10 metric tons of cocaine and apprehension and transport of over 50 smugglers.

On 16 February 2007, &quot;Curts&quot; was awarded the 2006 Battle &quot;E&quot; award.

In 2007 &quot;Curts&quot; was transferred from Commander Destroyer Squadron One to Commander Destroyer Squadron Nine and incorporated into Carrier Strike Group Nine. In March USS &quot;Abraham Lincoln&quot; Strike Group (CSG-9) departed for deployment to the 5th Fleet area of operations (Persian Gulf). This marked &quot;Curts&quot; first Strike Group deployment since transfer to the U.S. Naval Reserve. &quot;Curts&quot; primarily performed a Critical Infrastructure Protection role by acting as Scene of Action Commander for Oil Platform protection efforts at the Khawar al Amaya and al Basrah oil terminals in the northern Persian Gulf. &quot;Curts&quot; also conducted bi-lateral exercises with the Malaysian and Pakistani navies during her transit to the Gulf.

&quot;Curts&quot; was commanded by Yvette M. Davids from April 2007 to November 2008, making Davids the first Hispanic American woman to command a navy ship.

&quot;Curts&quot; was decommissioned on 25 January 2013, and was transferred to the inactive reserves on 27 February.

In December 2012 during the 112th Session of Congress, a transfer-by-grant was proposed. The recipient would be The Navy of Mexico, who may receive &quot;Curts&quot;, along with . Both vessels were not transferred. The act of approving the transfer of vessels by the United States does not guarantee that the vessels will actually be transferred. As of September 2016, both ships were in reserve at Pearl Harbor and slated to be disposed of as targets.

On 19 September 2020, &quot;Curts&quot; was sunk during a sinking exercise (SINKEX) in the Pacific Ocean. The SINKEX was part of Exercise Valiant Shield 2020. She was targeted with live ordnance including air-launched ordnance from fixed and rotary wing of Carrier Air Wing Five, embarked aboard the aircraft carrier , RGM-84 &quot;Harpoon&quot; missiles from the cruisers and , a subsurface launched missile from the submarine , as well as various supporting U.S. Navy and United States Air Force aircraft.

<doc id="731861" wikidata="Q1071481" url="?curid=731861" title="Cheyne–Stokes respiration">
<text>Cheyne–Stokes respiration is an abnormal pattern of breathing characterized by progressively deeper, and sometimes faster, breathing followed by a gradual decrease that results in a temporary stop in breathing called an apnea. The pattern repeats, with each cycle usually taking 30 seconds to 2 minutes. It is an oscillation of ventilation between apnea and hyperpnea with a crescendo-diminuendo pattern, and is associated with changing serum partial pressures of oxygen and carbon dioxide.

Cheyne–Stokes respiration and periodic breathing are the two regions on a spectrum of severity of oscillatory tidal volume. The distinction lies in what is observed at the trough of ventilation: Cheyne–Stokes respiration involves apnea (since apnea is a prominent feature in their original description) while periodic breathing involves hypopnea (abnormally small but not absent breaths).

These phenomena can occur during wakefulness or during sleep, where they are called the central sleep apnea syndrome (CSAS).

It may be caused by damage to respiratory centers, or by physiological abnormalities in congestive heart failure. It is also seen in newborns with immature respiratory systems, in visitors new to high altitudes, and in severely ill patients approaching end-of-life.

==Pathophysiology==
Causes may include heart failure, kidney failure, narcotic poisoning, intracranial pressure, and hypoperfusion of the brain (particularly of the respiratory center). The pathophysiology of Cheyne–Stokes breathing can be summarized as apnea leading to increased CO2 which causes excessive compensatory hyperventilation, in turn causing decreased CO2 which causes apnea, restarting the cycle.

In heart failure, the mechanism of the oscillation is unstable feedback in the respiratory control system. In normal respiratory control, negative feedback allows a steady level of alveolar gas concentrations to be maintained, and therefore stable tissue levels of oxygen and carbon dioxide (CO2). At the steady state, the rate of production of CO2 equals the net rate at which it is exhaled from the body, which (assuming no CO2 in the ambient air) is the product of the alveolar ventilation and the end-tidal CO2 concentration. Because of this interrelationship, the set of possible steady states forms a hyperbola:

: Alveolar ventilation = body CO2 production/end-tidal CO2 fraction.

In the figure below, this relationship is the curve falling from the top left to the bottom right. Only positions along this curve permit the body&#x27;s CO2 production to be exactly compensated for by exhalation of CO2. Meanwhile, there is another curve, shown in the figure for simplicity as a straight line from bottom left to top right, which is the body&#x27;s ventilatory response to different levels of CO2. Where the curves cross is the potential steady state (S).

Through respiratory control reflexes, any small transient fall in ventilation (A) leads to a corresponding small rise (A&#x27;) in alveolar CO2 concentration which is sensed by the respiratory control system so that there is a subsequent small compensatory rise in ventilation (B) above its steady state level (S) that helps restore CO2 back to its steady state value. In general, transient or persistent disturbances in ventilation, CO2 or oxygen levels can be counteracted by the respiratory control system in this way.

However, in some pathological states, the feedback is more powerful than is necessary to simply return the system towards its steady state. Instead, ventilation overshoots and can generate an opposite disturbance to the original disturbance. If this secondary disturbance is larger than the original, the next response will be even larger, and so on, until very large oscillations have developed, as shown in the figure below.

The cycle of enlargement of disturbances reaches a limit when successive disturbances are no longer larger, which occurs when physiological responses no longer increase linearly in relation to the size of the stimulus. The most obvious example of this is when ventilation falls to zero: it cannot be any lower. Thus Cheyne–Stokes respiration can be maintained over periods of many minutes or hours with a repetitive pattern of apneas and hyperpneas.

The end of the linear decrease in ventilation in response to falls in CO2 is not, however, at apnea. It occurs when ventilation is so small that air being breathed in never reaches the alveolar space, because the inspired tidal volume is no larger than the volume of the large airways such as the trachea. Consequently, at the nadir of periodic breathing, ventilation of the alveolar space may be effectively zero; the easily observable counterpart of this is failure at that time point of the end-tidal gas concentrations to resemble realistic alveolar concentrations.

Many potential contributory factors have been identified by clinical observation, but unfortunately they are all interlinked and co-vary extensively. Widely accepted risk factors are hyperventilation, prolonged circulation time, and reduced blood gas buffering capacity.

They are physiologically interlinked in that (for any given patient) circulation time decreases as cardiac output increases. Likewise, for any given total body CO2 production rate, alveolar ventilation is inversely proportional to end-tidal CO2 concentration (since their mutual product must equal total body CO2 production rate). Chemoreflex sensitivity is closely linked to the position of the steady state, because if chemoreflex sensitivity increases (other things being equal) the steady-state ventilation will rise and the steady-state CO2 will fall. Because ventilation and CO2 are easy to observe, and because they are commonly measured clinical variables which do not require any particular experiment to be conducted in order to observe them, abnormalities in these variables are more likely to be reported in the literature. However, other variables, such as chemoreflex sensitivity can only be measured by specific experiment, and therefore abnormalities in them will not be found in routine clinical data. When measured in patients with Cheyne–Stokes respiration, hypercapnic ventilatory responsiveness may be elevated by 100% or more. When not measured, its consequences—such as a low mean PaCO2 and elevated mean ventilation—may sometimes appear to be the most prominent feature.

==Associated conditions==
This abnormal pattern of breathing, in which breathing is absent for a period and then rapid for a period, can be seen in patients with heart failure, strokes, hyponatremia, traumatic brain injuries, and brain tumors. In some instances, it can occur in otherwise healthy people during sleep at high altitudes. It can occur in all forms of toxic metabolic encephalopathy. It is a symptom of carbon monoxide poisoning, along with syncope or coma. This type of respiration is different from respiratory depression, often seen after morphine administration.

Cheyne-Stokes is one of several abnormal breathing patterns potentially seen in Joubert syndrome and related disorders.

Hospices sometimes document the presence of Cheyne–Stokes breathing as a patient nears death, and report that patients able to speak after such episodes do not report any distress associated with the breathing, although it is sometimes disturbing to the family.

==Related patterns==
Cheyne–Stokes respirations are not the same as Biot&#x27;s respirations (&quot;cluster breathing&quot;), in which groups of breaths tend to be similar in size.

They differ from Kussmaul respirations in that the Kussmaul pattern is one of consistent very deep breathing at a normal or increased rate.

==History==
The condition was named after John Cheyne and William Stokes, the physicians who first described it in the 19th century.

The term became widely known and used in the Soviet Union after the death of Joseph Stalin in 1953, because the Soviet press announced that the ailing Stalin had Cheyne–Stokes respiration.

<doc id="731866" wikidata="Q1072673" url="?curid=731866" title="Chilaiditi syndrome">
<text>Chilaiditi syndrome is a rare condition when pain occurs due to transposition of a loop of large intestine (usually transverse colon) in between the diaphragm and the liver, visible on plain abdominal X-ray or chest X-ray.

Normally this causes no symptoms, and this is called Chilaiditi&#x27;s sign. The sign can be permanently present, or sporadically. This anatomical variant is sometimes mistaken for the more serious condition of having air under the diaphragm (pneumoperitoneum) which is usually an indication of bowel perforation, possibly leading to surgical interventions.

Chilaiditi syndrome refers only to complications in the presence of Chilaiditi&#x27;s sign. These include abdominal pain, torsion of the bowel (transverse colon volvulus) or shortness of breath.

==Causes==
The exact cause is not always known, but it may occur in patients with a long and mobile colon (dolichocolon), chronic lung disease such as emphysema, or liver problems such as cirrhosis and ascites. Chilaiditi&#x27;s sign is generally not associated with symptoms, and is most commonly an incidental finding in normal individuals.

Absence or laxity of the ligament suspending the transverse colon or of the falciform ligament are also thought to contribute to the condition. It can also be associated with relative atrophy of the medial segment of the left lobe of the liver. In this case, the gallbladder position is often anomalous as well – it is often located anterior to the liver, rather than posterior.

==Epidemiology==
The occurrence (incidence) on abdominal or chest X-rays is around 0.1% but it can be up to 1% in series of older adults. It has also been reported in children.

==History==
Chilaiditi&#x27;s sign is named after the Greek radiologist Dimítrios Chilaiditi, born in 1883, who first described it when he was working in Vienna in 1910.

==Synonyms==
Synonyms include interpositio hepatodiaphragmatica, subphrenic displacement of the colon, subphrenic interposition syndrome and pseudopneumoperitoneum.

* Maureen Flannigan as Sonja, a scuba diving instructor
* Demetra Hampton as Alex
* Robert Mandan as Hemlock, a corporate raider determined to take over the island.
* Patrick Labyorteaux as Young Hemlock
* Milton Selzer as Irv
* Tony Longo as Rob
* Michael Ralph as Flash
* Zelda Rubinstein as Old Hermit
* Brandy Ledford as Mermaid

<text>Frank Howard Field at Memorial Stadium, known as &quot;Death Valley&quot;, is an outdoor stadium on the campus of Clemson University in Clemson, South Carolina. It is home to the Clemson Tigers football team of the Atlantic Coast Conference (ACC).

Built between 1941–1942, the stadium was originally named Memorial Stadium in memory of &quot;all Clemson men who have made the supreme sacrifice for their country.&quot; In 1974, when legendary, long-time head coach and athletic director Frank Howard retired from the university, it was announced that the playing surface would be named in his honor.

The stadium has seen expansions throughout the years with the most recent being the WestZone with Phase 1 construction beginning in 2004 and completing in 2015 with the addition of the Oculus, the final piece of Phase 3. Phase 1 of the EastZone project began in 2020.

Prior to the completion of Bank of America Stadium, in Charlotte, Memorial Stadium served as the home venue for the National Football League (NFL)&#x27;s Carolina Panthers during the team&#x27;s inaugural 1995 season.

Currently, the stadium is the largest in the ACC.

==History ==

===Construction===
The stadium was constructed against the wishes of outgoing Clemson head coach Jess Neely. Just before leaving for Rice University after the 1939 season, he told his line coach and successor, Frank Howard, &quot;Don&#x27;t ever let them talk you into building a big stadium. Put about 10,000 seats behind the YMCA. That&#x27;s all you&#x27;ll ever need.&quot; Despite this, Clemson officials decided it was time to build a stadium to replace old Riggs Field. They chose to build in the valley in the western part of campus. On April 3, 1941, the South Carolina General Assembly ratified an act authorizing a $150,000 bond issue for the new stadium, and the bill went to Governor Burnet R. Maybank for signature. The original 20,500-seat stadium—the lower half of the current facility&#x27;s south grandstand—was constructed for $125,000 or $6.25 a seat. The stadium was designed by Carl Lee of Charlotte, North Carolina (Clemson &#x27;08) and Professor H. E. Glenn of the engineering faculty. On September 19, 1942, Memorial Stadium was opened with a 32–13 victory over Presbyterian College. Much of the early construction of the stadium was done by scholarship athletes. In fact, the first staking out of the stadium was done by A. N. Cameron and Hugh Webb, two members of the football team.

In 1958, 18,000 sideline seats were added and in 1960, 5,658 west end zone seats were added in response to increasing attendance. The original cedar wood seating was replaced in 1972 by aluminum seats. As attendance continued to skyrocket, the sideline seats were double-decked. The south upper deck (Top Deck South) was added in 1978 and the north upper deck (Top Deck North) in 1983. This put the total capacity over 80,000, which made it one of the largest on-campus stadiums in the United States. The most recent expansion started in 2004 and continued through 2009. The first phase of the &quot;WestZone&quot; project closed in the west end zone of Death Valley, added new luxury box and club seating, and completely renovated the locker rooms. The second phase, which was completed prior to the 2009 football season, brought all football offices and team meeting rooms to the WestZone from the McFadden Building and also added dedicated football training and strength conditioning facilities. The stadium&#x27;s maximum capacity is 81,500, but it can accommodate crowds of over 86,000 with standing room. The largest crowd in school history was in 1999, when 86,092 watched the Tigers lose to Florida State.

On January 14, 2011, Clemson announced a new $50 million athletic building plan. Facility improvements for football will include building an indoor practice facility and finishing the WestZone project. The indoor practice facility, which will be located where the current practice fields are, will feature a regulation-size artificial turf football field, a coach&#x27;s tower and video platforms. The building will have large garage-style doors, which can be raised to create an open-air space. The estimated cost of the project is $10 million. “The indoor practice facility will be a highly significant addition for Clemson, not only for football but also for other sports to use,” Phillips said. The $15.3 million WestZone project will feature the oculus, which is the main entrance to the WestZone, a four-level museum and an expansion of the northwest concourse. Construction on the northwest concourse expansion started in April and was completed by the start of the 2011 season.

===Scroll of Honor===
A memorial to the 493 Clemson service personnel killed while on military duty was dedicated outside Gate 1 on April 22, 2010. A flypast of two T-34B Mentors concluded the ceremonies.

===Death Valley===

The nickname &quot;Death Valley&quot; for Memorial Stadium, derives both from Death Valley National Park in California as well as the location of the Clemson University cemetery on a hill that once overlooked the field—before the upper decks were constructed.

The late Lonnie McMillian, former football coach at Presbyterian College told sports writers in 1948 that he had &quot;to take his team up to Clemson and play in Death Valley&quot; where they rarely scored or gained a victory.

Clemson Head Coach Frank Howard began using the nickname &quot;Death Valley&quot; for the stadium in the 1950s. 

===Death Valley facts===
*Clemson is 345-105–6 at Death Valley, a winning percentage of over 76%.
*In 1999, Tommy Bowden&#x27;s first year as head coach, the attendance record was set at the game against Florida State, whose head coach was Tommy&#x27;s father, Bobby. Ann Bowden wore a sweater that was half Clemson and half Florida State which read &quot;FloridaSon.&quot;
*In 2007, Clemson hosted a game against Boston College, and the stadium set the record for the loudest stadium in college football at 133 decibels. This record would eventually break in 2023 when Tennessee faced Georgia and the stadium set a record at 137 decibels.

Memorial Stadium hosted The Rolling Stones with Living Colour in 1989 for the Steel Wheels/Urban Jungle Tour. It hosted Pink Floyd in 1994 for The Division Bell Tour. It hosted Elton John with Billy Joel in 1995 for Face to Face 1995 tour, and The Eagles in 1996. In 1997, it hosted U2 with Rage Against the Machine for the PopMart Tour.

==Notable games==
* November 12, 1960 - After 57 straight trips to Columbia, SC for the annual game against Clemson&#x27;s biggest rival, South Carolina, the Tigers host the Gamecocks and defeat them 12–2. The game marks the end of the traditional Big Thursday rivalry and the beginning of the current home-and-home series format between the two teams.
* September 23, 1967 - Rubbing The Rock is introduced into Clemson tradition as the Tigers defeated Wake 23–6.
* September 19, 1981 - Unranked Clemson defeats defending national champion and #4 Georgia 13–3 en route to the Tigers&#x27; own national championship that year, finishing their season undefeated (12–0) .
* October 31, 1981– #3 Clemson blows out Wake Forest 82–24, the most points ever scored by a Tiger team in Death Valley.
* September 19, 1987– #18 Georgia comes into Death Valley to face #8 Clemson. The year before, David Treadwell had kicked the game-winning field goal in Athens as time expired to give Clemson the win. This year, trailing 20–16, Clemson&#x27;s defense would stop the Bulldogs in the end zone for a safety and then take the ensuing drive to set up Treadwell again for a game-winning field goal. The Tigers won as time expired, 21–20.
* September 17, 1988– #3 Clemson hosts #10 Florida State in what will forever be known as the &quot;Puntrooskie&quot; game. With two minutes left to play and the score tied, the Seminoles ran the now famous puntrooskie fake to Leroy Butler, which set up FSU&#x27;s game-winning field goal with 32 seconds to play.
* October 23, 1999 - Clemson hosts #1 Florida State for the first ever father/son head coach face off. Despite a close game, Bobby Bowden&#x27;s Seminoles were too much for Tommy Bowden&#x27;s Tigers and FSU secured a slim 17–14 win over the Tigers. FSU would win the national championship that year. The game marks Clemson&#x27;s single game attendance record.
* November 18, 2000 - Trailing 14–13 to South Carolina, quarterback Woody Dantzler connects with Rod Gardner on a &quot;Hail Mary&quot; pass with 10 seconds to play, to set up Clemson&#x27;s game-winning field goal and a score of 16-14. It would be dubbed by Clemson fans as &quot;The Catch II.&quot; 
* November 8, 2003 - Clemson shocks #3 Florida State 26–10, the highest-ranked team the Tigers had beaten until the 2016 game against Louisville.

* October 21, 2006– ESPN visits Clemson for the first ever GameDay TV program hosted by the university, as the #12 Tigers host #13 Georgia Tech. Clemson running backs James Davis and C. J. Spiller ran wild against the Jackets, racking up a combined 332 yards on the ground en route to a 31–7 victory. Clemson&#x27;s defense limited Yellow Jackets star wide receiver Calvin Johnson to no catches.
* August 31, 2013 - ESPN&#x27;s College GameDay returns to Clemson, this time debuting a new four-hour-long program for the game between #8 Clemson and #5 Georgia. Tajh Boyd would lead the Tigers to victory over the Dawgs by a score of 38–35, with Boyd being responsible for all 5 Tiger touchdowns (3 passing, 2 rushing). This would mark the first time that a non-SEC team had defeated two Top 10 SEC teams in a row, dating back to Clemson&#x27;s victory over the LSU Tigers in the 2012 Chick-fil-A Bowl. The game also marked the first time since 1988 that two Top 10 teams met in Death Valley.
* October 19, 2013 - ESPN College GameDay returns to for the highest ever ranked matchup between two teams in Memorial Stadium. #5 Florida State arrives in Death Valley to take on #3 Clemson. However, the matchup proved to be a lopsided one as the Seminoles, led by redshirt freshman quarterback Jameis Winston, won 51–14 and Clemson&#x27;s offense struggled to produce. FSU went on to win the national championship that year.
* November 29, 2014 - In another Battle for the Palmetto State, South Carolina came into Death Valley with a five-game winning streak, their longest in the rivalry to date. Clemson&#x27;s freshmen were the stars of the game, and Clemson went on to break the streak with a 35–17 victory over the struggling Gamecocks. Freshman quarterback Deshaun Watson threw for 269 yards and two touchdowns and rushed for two more; he was playing with a torn ACL. Freshman wide receiver Artavis Scott set Memorial Stadium and Clemson freshman records for receiving with 185 yards and two touchdowns. Clemson came into the game with the #1 ranked defense in the country, the likes of which produced two first-round draft picks, Vic Beasley, who had a forced fumble in the game; and Stephone Anthony, who would later be ejected for a targeting call on South Carolina&#x27;s quarterback, Dylan Thompson.
* October 3, 2015– ESPN College Game Day returned to Clemson for a prime time, top-15 game with #6 Notre Dame arriving to take on the #11 Tigers. The game occurred during record rainfall throughout the state of South Carolina, including repeated downpours during the game. Watson threw for two touchdowns and ran for another to give Clemson a 21–3 lead. Notre Dame rallied from behind to cut the lead to 24–22 in the waning seconds of the game. Clemson&#x27;s defense, however, stopped Notre Dame quarterback DeShone Kizer on the two-point conversion to secure the win.
* November 7, 2015– &quot;#1 in Death Valley&quot; Clemson entered their yearly rivalry game with the Florida State Seminoles as the #1 ranked team in the College Football Playoff rankings. Clemson was 8–0 and riding on a proficient balanced offense and a reload on defense. Florida State led in the first half, with Dalvin Cook rushing for over 120 yards in the first quarter and a 73-yard touchdown run on the third play from scrimmage. Clemson would remain resilient, however, and Deshaun Watson led the Tigers to a 23–13 victory. This victory led to the declaration of Clemson as the 2015 Atlantic Division champions of the ACC, securing them a spot in the 2015 ACC Championship Game. It was Clemson&#x27;s first victory in the rivalry with the Seminoles since 2011.
* October 1, 2016 - Third-ranked Louisville entered Clemson to take on the #5 Tigers as ESPN College Game Day returned once again. Clemson quarterback Deshaun Watson and Louisville quarterback Lamar Jackson fought a high-scoring quarterback duel. Watson threw five touchdown passes while Jackson threw for one score and ran for two. Clemson led 28–10 at the half, but Louisville scored 26 unanswered points to lead 36–28 in the fourth quarter. The Tigers rallied back for two scores and a 42–36 lead. The Clemson defense held off a late Louisville drive deep in Tiger territory, stopping the Cardinals on 4th and 12 to seal the victory.

===Howard&#x27;s Rock===

In the early 1960s, the rock was given to then head coach Frank Howard by a friend, Samuel Columbus Jones (Clemson Class of 1919). It was presented to Howard by Jones, saying &quot;Here&#x27;s a rock from Death Valley, California, to Death Valley, South Carolina.&quot; Howard didn&#x27;t think anything else about the rock and it was used as a door stop in his office for several years. In September 1966, while cleaning out his office, Howard noticed the rock and told IPTAY executive director Gene Willimon, &quot;Take this rock and throw it over the fence or out in the ditch...do something with it, but get it out of my office.&quot; Willimon had the rock placed on a pedestal at the top of the east end zone hill that the team ran down to enter the field for games. On September 24, 1966, the first time Clemson players ran by the rock, they beat conference rival Virginia, 40–35. Howard, seizing on the motivational potential of &quot;The Rock&quot;, told his players, &quot;Give me 110% or keep your filthy hands off of my rock.&quot; The team started rubbing the Rock for the first game of 1967, in which they beat ACC foe Wake Forest, 23–6.

It is now a tradition for the Clemson Ranger Club to &quot;protect&quot; the Rock during the 24 hours preceding the Clemson-South Carolina game, when held in Death Valley. ROTC cadets keep a steady drum cadence around the Rock prior to the game, which can be heard across the campus. Part of the tradition began after unknown parties vandalized the Rock prior to the 1992 South Carolina-Clemson game.

In 2013, the rock was vandalized and re-installed under a protective case.

===Running Down the Hill===
Probably the most highly publicized tradition of Clemson football is its dramatic entrance scene. The tradition of Running Down the Hill started when the football locker rooms were located in Fike Field House (located up the hill northeast of the stadium). Clemson players would run down the hill all the way from Fike into the stadium to intimidate opposing teams.

Today, after exiting the stadium on the west side, the players load into buses, escorted by police officers. They make their way around the stadium to the east side where The Hill is located. This scene has been shown on the JumboTron ever since it was installed in the stadium. When the buses arrive at the east side, the players get out and gather at the top of the hill and stand around Howard&#x27;s Rock. Once most of the players are out of the buses and ready to go, a cannon sounds, the band launches into Tiger Rag, and the players run down the hill. In 1985, Brent Musburger referred to it as &quot;the most exciting 25 seconds in college football.&quot;

After the end of the 2018 season the Tigers had made the run down the hill 402 times.

<doc id="731884" wikidata="Q1190859" url="?curid=731884" title="Electromagnetic four-potential">
<text>An electromagnetic four-potential is a relativistic vector function from which the electromagnetic field can be derived. It combines both an electric scalar potential and a magnetic vector potential into a single four-vector.

As measured in a given frame of reference, and for a given gauge, the first component of the electromagnetic four-potential is conventionally taken to be the electric scalar potential, and the other three components make up the magnetic vector potential. While both the scalar and vector potential depend upon the frame, the electromagnetic four-potential is Lorentz covariant.

Like other potentials, many different electromagnetic four-potentials correspond to the same electromagnetic field, depending upon the choice of gauge.

This article uses tensor index notation and the Minkowski metric sign convention . See also covariance and contravariance of vectors and raising and lowering indices for more details on notation. Formulae are given in SI units and Gaussian-cgs units.

== Definition ==

The contravariant electromagnetic four-potential can be defined as:
in which &quot;ϕ&quot; is the electric potential, and A is the magnetic potential (a vector potential). The unit of &quot;Aα&quot; is V·s·m−1 in SI, and Mx·cm−1 in Gaussian-CGS.

The electric and magnetic fields associated with these four-potentials are:

In special relativity, the electric and magnetic fields transform under Lorentz transformations. This can be written in the form of a rank two tensor – the electromagnetic tensor. The 16 contravariant components of the electromagnetic tensor, using Minkowski metric convention , are written in terms of the electromagnetic four-potential and the four-gradient as:
: formula_1

If the said signature is instead then:
:formula_2

This essentially defines the four-potential in terms of physically observable quantities, as well as reducing to the above definition.

== In the Lorenz gauge ==

Often, the Lorenz gauge condition formula_3 in an inertial frame of reference is employed to simplify Maxwell&#x27;s equations as:
where &quot;Jα&quot; are the components of the four-current, and
: formula_4
is the d&#x27;Alembertian operator. In terms of the scalar and vector potentials, this last equation becomes:

For a given charge and current distribution, and , the solutions to these equations in SI units are:
: formula_5
where 
: formula_6 
is the retarded time. This is sometimes also expressed with 
: formula_7 
where the square brackets are meant to indicate that the time should be evaluated at the retarded time. Of course, since the above equations are simply the solution to an inhomogeneous differential equation, any solution to the homogeneous equation can be added to these to satisfy the boundary conditions. These homogeneous solutions in general represent waves propagating from sources outside the boundary.

When the integrals above are evaluated for typical cases, e.g. of an oscillating current (or charge), they are found to give both a magnetic field component varying according to &quot;r&quot; (the induction field) and a component decreasing as &quot;r&quot; (the radiation field).

== Gauge freedom ==

When flattened to a one-form (in tensor notation, formula_8), the four-potential formula_9 (normally written as a vector or, formula_10 in tensor notation) can be decomposed via the Hodge decomposition theorem as the sum of an exact, a coexact, and a harmonic form,
: formula_11.

There is gauge freedom in in that of the three forms in this decomposition, only the coexact form has any effect on the electromagnetic tensor
: formula_12.

Exact forms are closed, as are harmonic forms over an appropriate domain, so formula_13 and formula_14, always. So regardless of what formula_15 and formula_16 are, we are left with simply
: formula_17.

In infinite flat Minkowski space, every closed form is exact. Therefore the formula_16 term vanishes. Every gauge transform of formula_9 can thus be written as
: formula_20.

<doc id="731887" wikidata="Q5487337" url="?curid=731887" title="Frank Howard (American football)">
<text>Frank J. Howard (March 25, 1909 – January 26, 1996) was an American college football player and coach. He played college football for Alabama. After a career-ending injury, Howard joined the staff at Clemson College and became head coach in 1940. Howard coached the Clemson Tigers for 30 years, amassing the 15th most wins of any college football coach. He led Clemson to ten bowl games, an undefeated season in 1948, and several top-20 rankings during his tenure as head coach. During his stay at Clemson, Howard also oversaw the athletic department, ticket sales, and was an assistant coach for the baseball team. He was inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame, the South Carolina Sports Hall of Fame, the Alabama Sports Hall of Fame and the Clemson Ring of Honor. The playing surface at Clemson&#x27;s Memorial Stadium is named after him.

==Coaching career==
In 1963, after Maryland announced that African-American wide receiver Daryyl Hill was to play, Clemson threatened to leave the conference. Howard vowed that his team would not allow any black to play in their stadium, although Hill did end up playing in the scheduled game.

In the early 1960s,however, Howard allegedly showed compassion to the local community including those at segregated African-American school that he could not recruit. One of the football players was future Michigan State University All American and All Pro George Webster. As a junior at Westside High in Anderson, S.C. Webster suffered a knee injury. The injury could have spelled the end of his career, but then-Clemson coach Frank Howard helped Webster. Michigan State teammate Jim Summers of Orangeville, S.C., tells the story.

“Frank Howard made sure that operation at Clemson University’s medical facility,” Summers said. “George was probably the first black person to spend any sustained time on that campus. If it wasn’t for segregation, George probably would have gone to Clemson, Frank treated him so well.” George Webster was drafted 3rd in the 1967 NFL draft after winning two national championships.

<doc id="731893" wikidata="Q42519" url="?curid=731893" title="Grey">
<text>Grey (more frequent in British English) or gray (more frequent in American English) is an intermediate color between black and white. It is a neutral or achromatic color, meaning that it has no chroma. It is the color of a cloud-covered sky, of ash, and of lead.

The first recorded use of &quot;grey&quot; as a color name in the English language was in 700 CE. &quot;Grey&quot; is the dominant spelling in European and Commonwealth English, while &quot;gray&quot; is more common in American English; however, both spellings are valid in both varieties of English.

In Europe and North America, surveys show that gray is the color most commonly associated with neutrality, conformity, boredom, uncertainty, old age, indifference, and modesty. Only one percent of respondents chose it as their favorite color.
==Etymology==
&quot;Grey&quot; comes from the Middle English or , from the Old English , and is related to the Dutch and German . There are no certain cognates outside Germanic languages; terms such as Spanish and Italian are considered Germanic loanwords from Medieval Latin &quot;griseus&quot;. The first recorded use of &quot;grey&quot; as a color name in the English language was in 700 AD.

The distinction between &quot;grey&quot; and &quot;gray&quot; spellings in usual Commonwealth and American English respectively developed the 20th century.

==In history and art==

===Antiquity through the Middle Ages===
In antiquity and the Middle Ages, grey was the color of undyed wool, and thus was the color most commonly worn by peasants and the poor. It was also the color worn by Cistercian monks and friars of the Franciscan and Capuchin orders as a symbol of their vows of humility and poverty. Franciscan friars in England and Scotland were commonly known as the grey friars, and that name is now attached to many places in Great Britain.

===Renaissance and the Baroque===
During the Renaissance and the Baroque, grey began to play an important role in fashion and art. Black became the most popular color of the nobility, particularly in Italy, France, and Spain, and grey and white were harmonious with it.

Grey was also frequently used for the drawing of oil paintings, a technique called &quot;grisaille&quot;. The painting would first be composed in grey and white, and then the colors, made with thin transparent glazes, would be added on top. The grisaille beneath would provide the shading, visible through the layers of color. Sometimes, the grisaille was simply left uncovered, giving the appearance of carved stone.

Grey was a particularly good background color for gold and for skin tones. It became the most common background for the portraits of Rembrandt van Rijn and for many of the paintings of El Greco, who used it to highlight the faces and costumes of the central figures. The palette of Rembrandt was composed almost entirely of somber colors. He composed his warm greys out of black pigments made from charcoal or burnt animal bones, mixed with lead white or a white made of lime, which he warmed with a little red lake color from cochineal or madder. In one painting, the portrait of Margaretha de Geer (1661), one part of a grey wall in the background is painted with a layer of dark brown over a layer of orange, red, and yellow earths, mixed with ivory black and some lead white. Over this he put an additional layer of glaze made of mixture of blue smalt, red ochre, and yellow lake. Using these ingredients and many others, he made greys which had, according to art historian Philip Ball, &quot;an incredible subtlety of pigmentation&quot;. The warm, dark and rich greys and browns served to emphasize the golden light on the faces in the paintings.

===Eighteenth and nineteenth centuries===
Grey became a highly fashionable color in the 18th century, both for women&#x27;s dresses and for men&#x27;s waistcoats and coats. It looked particularly luminous coloring the silk and satin fabrics worn by the nobility and wealthy.
Women&#x27;s fashion in the 19th century was dominated by Paris, while men&#x27;s fashion was set by London. The grey business suit appeared in the mid-19th century in London; light grey in summer, dark grey in winter; replacing the more colorful palette of men&#x27;s clothing early in the century.

The clothing of women working in the factories and workshops of Paris in the 19th century was usually grey. This gave them the name of &quot;grisettes&quot;. &quot;&quot;Gris&quot; or grey also meant drunk, and the name &quot;grisette&quot;&quot; was also given to the lower class of Parisian prostitutes.

Grey also became a common color for military uniforms; in an age of rifles with longer range, soldiers in grey were less visible as targets than those in blue or red. Grey was the color of the uniforms of the Confederate Army during the American Civil War, and of the Prussian Army for active service wear from 1910 onwards.

Several artists of the mid-19th century used tones of grey to create memorable paintings; Jean-Baptiste-Camille Corot used tones of green-grey and blue grey to give harmony to his landscapes, and James McNeill Whistler created a special grey for the background of the portrait of his mother, and for his own self-portrait.

Whistler&#x27;s arrangement of tones of grey had an effect on the world of music, on the French composer Claude Debussy. In 1894, Debussy wrote to violinist Eugène Ysaÿe describing his &quot;Nocturnes&quot; as &quot;an experiment in the combinations that can be obtained from one color – what a study in grey would be in painting&quot;.

===Twentieth and twenty-first centuries===
In the late 1930s, grey became a symbol of industrialization and war. It was the dominant color of Pablo Picasso&#x27;s celebrated painting about the horrors of the Spanish Civil War, &quot;Guernica&quot;.

After the war, the grey business suit became a metaphor for uniformity of thought, popularized in such books as &quot;The Man in the Gray Flannel Suit&quot; (1955), which became a successful film in 1956.

==In the sciences, nature, and technology==

===Storm clouds===

The whiteness or darkness of clouds is a function of their depth. Small, fluffy white clouds in summer look white because the sunlight is being scattered by the tiny water droplets they contain, and that white light comes to the viewer&#x27;s eye. However, as clouds become larger and thicker, the white light cannot penetrate through the cloud, and is reflected off the top. Clouds look darkest grey during thunderstorms, when they can be as much as 20,000 to 30,000 feet high.

Stratiform clouds are a layer of clouds that covers the entire sky, and which have a depth of between a few hundred to a few thousand feet thick. The thicker the clouds, the darker they appear from below, because little of the sunlight is able to pass through. From above, in an airplane, the same clouds look perfectly white, but from the ground the sky looks gloomy and grey.

===The greying of hair===

The color of a person&#x27;s hair is created by the pigment melanin, found in the core of each hair. Melanin is also responsible for the color of the skin and of the eyes. There are only two types of pigment: dark (eumelanin) or light (phaeomelanin). Combined in various combinations, these pigments create all natural hair colors.

Melanin itself is the product of a specialized cell, the melanocyte, which is found in each hair follicle, from which the hair grows. As hair grows, the melanocyte injects melanin into the hair cells, which contain the protein keratin and which makes up our hair, skin, and nails. As long as the melanocytes continue injecting melanin into the hair cells, the hair retains its original color. At a certain age, however, which varies from person to person, the amount of melanin injected is reduced and eventually stops. The hair, without pigment, turns grey and eventually white. The reason for this decline of production of melanocytes is uncertain. In the February 2005 issue of &quot;Science&quot;, a team of Harvard scientists suggested that the cause was the failure of the melanocyte stem cells to maintain the production of the essential pigments, due to age or genetic factors, after a certain period of time. For some people, the breakdown comes in their twenties; for others, many years later. According to the site of the magazine &quot;Scientific American&quot;, &quot;Generally speaking, among Caucasians 50 percent are 50 percent grey by age 50.&quot; Adult male gorillas also develop silver hair, but only on their backs – see Physical characteristics of gorillas.

===Optics===
Over the centuries, artists have traditionally created grey by mixing black and white in various proportions. They added a little red to make a warmer grey, or a little blue for a cooler grey. Artists could also make a grey by mixing two complementary colors, such as orange and blue.

Today the grey on televisions, computer displays, and telephones is usually created using the RGB color model. Red, green, and blue light combined at full intensity on the black screen makes white; by lowering the intensity, it is possible to create shades of grey.

In printing, grey is usually obtained with the CMYK color model, using cyan, magenta, yellow, and black. Grey is produced either by using black and white, or by combining equal amounts of cyan, magenta, and yellow. Most greys have a cool or warm cast to them, as the human eye can detect even a minute amount of color saturation. Yellow, orange, and red create a &quot;warm grey&quot;. Green, blue, and violet create a &quot;cool grey&quot;. When no color is added, the color is &quot;neutral grey&quot;, &quot;achromatic grey&quot;, or simply &quot;grey&quot;. Images consisting wholly of black, white and greys are called monochrome, black-and-white, or greyscale.
; RGB model

;CMYK model
: Grey values are produced by &quot;c&quot; = &quot;m&quot; = &quot;y&quot; = 0, for the color (&quot;c&quot;, &quot;m&quot;, &quot;y&quot;, &quot;k&quot;). Lightness is adjusted by varying &quot;k&quot;. In theory, any mixture where &quot;c&quot; = &quot;m&quot; = &quot;y&quot; is neutral, but in practice such mixtures are often a muddy brown.
;HSL and HSV model :
:Achromatic greys have no hue, so the &quot;h&quot; code is marked as &quot;undefined&quot; using a dash: &quot;--&quot;; greys also result whenever &quot;s&quot; is 0 or undefined, as is the case when &quot;v&quot; is 0 or &quot;l&quot; is 0 or 1
===Web colors===
There are several tones of grey available for use with HTML and Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) as named colors, while 254 true greys are available by specification of a hex triplet for the RGB value. All are spelled &quot;gray&quot;, using the spelling &quot;grey&quot; can cause errors. This spelling was inherited from the X11 color list. Internet Explorer&#x27;s Trident browser engine does not recognize &quot;grey&quot; and renders it green. Another anomaly is that &quot;gray&quot; is in fact much darker than the X11 color marked &quot;darkgray&quot;; this is because of a conflict with the original HTML gray and the X11 gray, which is closer to HTML&#x27;s &quot;silver&quot;. The three &quot;slategray&quot; colors are not themselves on the greyscale, but are slightly saturated toward cyan (green + blue). Since there are an even (256, including black and white) number of unsaturated tones of grey, there are two grey tones straddling the midpoint in the 8-bit greyscale. The color name &quot;gray&quot; has been assigned the lighter of the two shades (128, also known as #808080), due to rounding up.

===Pigments===
Until the 19th century, artists traditionally created grey by simply combining black and white. Rembrandt Van Rijn, for instance, usually used lead white and either carbon black or ivory black, along with touches of either blues or reds to cool or warm the grey.

In the early 19th century, a new grey, Payne&#x27;s grey, appeared on the market. Payne&#x27;s grey is a dark blue-grey, a mixture of ultramarine and black or of ultramarine and sienna. It is named after William Payne, a British artist who painted watercolors in the late 18th century. The first recorded use of &quot;Payne&#x27;s grey&quot; as a color name in English was in 1835.

===Animal color===
Grey is a very common color for animals, birds, and fish, ranging in size from whales to mice. It provides a natural camouflage and allows them to blend with their surroundings.

===Grey matter of the brain===
The substance that composes the brain is sometimes referred to as grey matter, or &quot;the little grey cells&quot;, so the color grey is associated with things intellectual. However, the living human brain is actually pink in color; it only turns grey when dead.

===Nanotechnology and grey goo===
Grey goo is a hypothetical end-of-the-world scenario, also known as ecophagy: out-of-control self-replicating nanobots consume all living matter on Earth while building more of themselves.

===Grey noise===
In sound engineering, grey noise is random noise subjected to an equal-loudness contour, such as an inverted A-weighting curve, over a given range of frequencies, giving the listener the perception that it is equally loud at all frequencies.

==In culture==

===Religion===
In the Christian religion, grey is the color of ashes, and so a biblical symbol of mourning and repentance, described as sackcloth and ashes. It can be used during Lent or on special days of fasting and prayer. As the color of humility and modesty, grey is worn by friars of the Order of Friars Minor Capuchin and Franciscan order as well as monks of the Cistercian order. Grey cassocks are worn by clergy of the Brazilian Catholic Apostolic Church.

Buddhist monks and priests in Japan and Korea will often wear a sleeved grey, brown, or black outer robe.

Taoist priests in China also often wear grey.

===Politics===
Grey is rarely used as a color by political parties, largely because of its common association with conformity, boredom and indecision. An example of a political party using grey as a color are the German Grey Panthers.

The term &quot;grey power&quot; or &quot;the grey vote&quot; is sometimes used to describe the influence of older voters as a voting bloc. In the United States, older people are more likely to vote, and usually vote to protect certain social benefits, such as Social Security.

&quot;Greys&quot; is a term sometimes used pejoratively by environmentalists in the green movement to describe those who oppose environmental measures and supposedly prefer the grey of concrete and cement.

===Military===
During the American Civil War, the soldiers of the Confederate Army wore grey uniforms. At the beginning of the war, the armies of the North and of the South had very similar uniforms; some Confederate units wore blue, and some Union units wore grey. There naturally was confusion, and sometimes soldiers fired by mistake at soldiers of their own army. On June 6, 1861, the Confederate government issued regulations standardizing the army uniform and establishing cadet grey as the uniform color. This was (and still is) the color of the uniform of cadets at the United States Military Academy at West Point, and cadets at the Virginia Military Institute, which produced many officers for the Confederacy.

The new uniforms were designed by Nicola Marschall, a German-American artist, who also designed the original Confederate flag. He closely followed the design of contemporary French and Austrian military uniforms. Grey was not chosen for its camouflage value; this benefit was not appreciated for several more decades. The South lacked a major dye industry, though, and grey dyes were inexpensive and easy to manufacture. While some units had uniforms colored with good-quality dyes, which were a solid bluish-grey, others had uniforms colored with vegetable dyes made from sumac or logwood, which quickly faded in sunshine to the yellowish color of butternut squash.

The German Army wore grey uniforms from 1907 until 1945, during both the First World War and Second World War. The color chosen was a grey-green called field grey (). It was chosen because it was less visible at a distance than the previous German uniforms, which were Prussian blue. It was one of the first uniform colors to be chosen for its camouflage value, important in the new age of smokeless powder and more accurate rifles and machine guns. It gave the Germans a distinct advantage at the beginning of the First World War, when the French soldiers were dressed in blue jackets and red trousers. The Finnish Army also began using grey uniforms on the German model.

Some of the more recent uniforms of the German Army and East German Army were field grey, as were some uniforms of the Swedish army. The formal dress (M/83) of the Finnish Army is grey. The Army of Chile wears field grey today.

===The grey suit===
During the 19th century, women&#x27;s fashions were largely dictated by Paris, while London set fashions for men. The intent of a business suit was above all to show seriousness, and to show one&#x27;s position in business and society. Over the course of the century, bright colors disappeared from men&#x27;s fashion, and were largely replaced by a black or dark charcoal grey frock coat in winter, and lighter greys in summer. In the early 20th century, the frock coat was gradually replaced by the lounge suit, a less formal version of evening dress, which was also usually black or charcoal grey. In the 1930s the English suit style was called the drape suit, with wide shoulders and a nipped waist, usually dark or light grey. After World War II, the style changed to a slimmer fit called the continental cut, but the color remained grey.

===Sports===
* In baseball, grey is the color typically used for road uniforms. This came about because in the 19th and early 20th century, away teams did not normally have access to laundry facilities on the road, thus stains were not noticeable on the darker grey uniforms as opposed to the white uniforms worn by the home team.
* The Vegas Golden Knights of the National Hockey League features steel grey as its primary color and its current alternate uniforms are steel grey.
* New Caledonia national football teams have worn grey home shirts and the color is featured on its football badge.
* Georgetown University&#x27;s basketball teams traditionally wear grey uniforms at home.

===Gay culture===
* In gay slang, a &quot;grey queen&quot; is a gay person who works for the financial services industry. This term originates from the fact that in the 1950s, people who worked in this profession often wore grey flannel suits.

==Associations and symbolism==

In America and Europe, grey is one of the least popular colors; In a European survey, only one percent of men said it was their favorite color, and thirteen percent called it their least favorite color; the response from women was almost the same. According to color historian Eva Heller, &quot;grey is too weak to be considered masculine, but too menacing to be considered a feminine color. It is neither warm nor cold, neither material or spiritual. With grey, nothing seems to be decided.&quot; It also denotes undefinedness and ambiguity, as in a .

Grey is the color most commonly associated in many cultures with the elderly and old age, because of the association with grey hair; it symbolizes the wisdom and dignity that come with experience and age. The New York Times is sometimes called &quot;The Grey Lady&quot; because of its long history and esteemed position in American journalism.

Grey is the color most often associated in Europe and America with modesty.

<doc id="731896" wikidata="Q5031191" url="?curid=731896" title="Canarsie, Brooklyn">
<text>Canarsie ( ) is a mostly residential neighborhood in the southeastern portion of Brooklyn, New York City. Canarsie is bordered on the east by Fresh Creek Basin, East 108th Street, and Louisiana Avenue; on the north by Linden Boulevard; on the west by Ralph Avenue; on the southwest by Paerdegat Basin; and on the south by Jamaica Bay. It is adjacent to the neighborhoods of East Flatbush to the west, Flatlands and Bergen Beach to the southwest, Starrett City to the east, East New York to the northeast, and Brownsville to the north.

The area near Canarsie was originally settled by the Canarse Native Americans. The community&#x27;s name is adapted from a Lenape word meaning &quot;fenced area&quot;. After European settlement, Canarsie was initially a fishing community, but became a popular summer resort in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. By the late 1930s and early 1940, the resorts had been destroyed, and Canarsie was developed as a largely Italian American and Jewish suburb. In the 1970s, racial tensions developed around an argument over the zoning of the area&#x27;s schools, and in the aftermath, Canarsie became a mainly black neighborhood with a high West Indian population in the late 1990s.

Canarsie is part of Brooklyn Community District 18 and its primary ZIP Code is 11236. It is patrolled by the 69th Precinct of the New York City Police Department. Fire services are provided by the New York City Fire Department&#x27;s Engine Co. 257/Ladder Co. 170/Battalion 58. Politically it is represented by the New York City Council&#x27;s 42nd and 46th Districts.

==Etymology==
&quot;Canarsie&quot; is an adaptation to English phonology of a word in the Lenape language for &quot;fenced land&quot; or &quot;fort&quot;. Europeans would often refer to the indigenous people living in an area by the local place-name, though it is unclear whether the &quot;Canarsie&quot; name originally referred to their entire ancestral land, or whether it merely referred to a single &quot;fenced village&quot;. References may be found in contemporary documents to &quot;Canarsie Indians&quot; (alternatively &quot;Canarsee&quot;). Their name has also been transcribed as &quot;Connarie See&quot; (a name for Jamaica Bay), &quot;Conorasset&quot;, &quot;Canarisse&quot;, &quot;Canaryssen&quot;, &quot;Canause&quot;, &quot;Canarisea&quot;, and &quot;Kanarsingh&quot;. The village itself was referred to as &quot;Keskachauge&quot; or &quot;Kestateuw&quot;, alternatively transcribed as &quot;Castateuw&quot;. After European settlement, the area became variously known as &quot;Flatlands Neck&quot;, &quot;Vischers Hook&quot;, and &quot;Great Neck&quot;.

&quot;By way of Canarsie&quot; became a mid-twentieth century American English figure of speech meaning &quot;to come to one&#x27;s destination by a roundabout way or from a distant point.&quot; The expression has dropped from modern common parlance.

Canarsie was described as &quot;the butt of vaudeville jokes&quot; in the 1939 WPA Guide to New York City. A &quot;New York Times&quot; article in 1955 characterized Canarsie as a former &quot;lame vaudeville gag&quot;. By the 2010s, &quot;The Flossy&quot; was also being used as a local nickname for Canarsie.

==Geography==
Canarsie is bordered on the east by Fresh Creek Basin and Williams Avenue; on the north by Linden Boulevard and the Bay Ridge Branch; on the west by Ralph Avenue; on the southwest by Paerdegat Basin; and on the southeast by Belt Parkway and Jamaica Bay. It is adjacent to the neighborhoods of East Flatbush on the northwest, Flatlands on the west, Bergen Beach on the southwest, Brownsville on the north, and the Spring Creek subsection of East New York on the east and northeast.

Prior to European settlement, Canarsie featured the only large swath of uplands along the Jamaica Bay coast within the town of Flatlands. The islands in the bay, such as Bergen, Mill, and Barren islands, mostly featured marshy land with small pieces of uplands. In the 19th century, a few ports along the coast were built for limited industrial use. The coast was more significantly modified in the early 20th century, when more than of shoreline was filled in with a bulkhead.

==History==
===Early history===
The coastal lands around Jamaica Bay, including present-day Canarsie, were originally settled by the Canarsie Indians. The present-day neighborhood of Canarsie was one of the Canarsie tribe&#x27;s main villages. They probably lived near the intersection of present-day Seaview and Remsen Avenues. Cornfields grew from the shore to as far inland as Avenue J, and were centered around East 92nd Street. The Canarsie Indians grew cornfields on three flats within the area. As late as the 1930s, &quot;immense shell heaps&quot; could be found at the site. These shells might have served as planting fields.

In 1624, the Dutch Republic incorporated much of the current New York City area into the colony of New Netherland. In 1636, as the Dutch was expanding outward from present-day Manhattan, Dutch settlers founded the town of Achtervelt (later Amersfoort, then Flatlands) and purchased around Jamaica Bay. Amersfoort was centered around the present-day intersection of Flatbush Avenue and Flatlands Avenue. Canarsie Indian leaders such as Penhawitz had signed three land agreements with Dutch settlers between 1636 and 1667, handing ownership of much of their historic land to the Dutch. Many of the tribe&#x27;s members started moving away, and Dutch settlers rented the cornfields that had formerly belonged to the Indians. Much of the remaining land was located in the present-day neighborhood of Canarsie. The first European settler in the area was Pieter Claesen Wyckoff, a former indentured servant who built a house in Flatlands circa 1652. Wyckoff&#x27;s house still stands along Clarendon Road, and it is believed to be the oldest structure in New York State.

In 1660, present-day Canarsie Point was given the name Vischers Hook (&quot;fishers&#x27; hook&quot;). The name referred to Hoorn, a Dutch fisherman who had built a house at that location. At the time, a group of islands extended into Jamaica Bay south of Canarsie, up to and including Barren Island.

The Indians still managed the land at Canarsie until the English took over New Amsterdam. In 1665, Canarsie Indians signed a land agreement that gave total ownership of almost all their land to the Dutch. By the time the land agreement was signed, only three Native American families remained in the area. In 1670, Daniel Denton, a co-founder of the nearby town of Jamaica, wrote: &quot;It is to be admired how strangely they have decreast by the Hand of God [...] for since my time, when there were six towns, they are reduced to two small villages.&quot; Through 1684, the Dutch and the Native Americans had signed twenty-two deeds regarding the sale of different plots of land in Flatlands. By the beginning of the 18th century, the only Canarsie Indians living in the New York City area were a few small groups in the town of Canarsie, as well as at Gerritsen Beach and Staten Island. At this time, their ancestral land in Canarsie had been fragmented and sold off to different settlers. Some plots were subsequently merged to create large plantation-style farms. An observer noted in 1832 that &quot;the Canarsie Indians are at this time totally extinct; not a single member of that ill-fated race is in existence&quot;. However, a few members still remained, albeit via mixed lineage. Joel Skidmore, the last member of the tribe through his mother&#x27;s side, was a tax collector from the town of Flatlands who lived in Canarsie until he died in 1907.

The towns of Flatbush and Flatlands laid competing claims to the western shore of Fresh Creek, within present-day Canarsie. A 1685 confirmation of Flatlands&#x27; boundaries did not recognize this small patch of land; instead, this land was classified as part of New Lots, then a subdivision of Flatbush. This dispute continued into the 19th century, as seen by maps from 1797 and 1873. Through this time, Canarsie remained sparsely populated. In an 1852 map, Jeremiah Schenck and James Schenck were listed as the only two landowners at Canarsie Point. They each owned of land. The only road in the area was what would later be Rockaway Parkway. The only way to Canarsie was by taking a train to Jamaica and transferring to a stagecoach, where passengers would endure a &quot;long and uncomfortable ride&quot; through the marshy woodlands that the road winded through.

===Seaside resort===
The Brooklyn and Rockaway Beach Railroad, which opened on October 21, 1865, offered train service from the Long Island Rail Road at the East New York station to a pier at Canarsie Landing, very close to the current junction of Rockaway Parkway and the Belt Parkway. The railroad built a pier extending into Jamaica Bay, which was used for lumber deliveries and was later enlarged. Less than a year later, in summer 1866, the railroad started operating a ferry to Rockaway Beach, marking the start of the area&#x27;s transformation into a summer beach resort. That year, there were ten daily round trips along the Canarsie railroad, but only three on the Rockaway ferry, so vacationers traveling to the Rockaways via the railroad and ferry would often stay on Canarsie Landing for a few hours. Railroad service was increased in 1867, with trains running every hour on weekdays and every half hour on Sundays; the railroad handled 122,567 passengers that year.

Five hotels soon opened on the Canarsie shore, starting with Bay View House in July 1867. In addition, restaurants and saloons began operating along Canarsie Landing. An 1867 account from a &quot;Brooklyn Daily Eagle&quot; correspondent stated that there were two railroads: the Canarsie steam dummy, which ran only to East New York, and the Nostrand Avenue Line, which connected with other streetcar lines that ran across Brooklyn. The correspondent wrote that &quot;it has ample hotel accommodations for boarders or casual visitors, and all it needs is a good roadway along the waterside for promenade and drive.&quot; The next year, an article from the &quot;Eagle&quot; noted that although Canarsie still had a reputation for being a fisherman&#x27;s village, it &quot;will be largely patronized as soon as people get the means of going there&quot;. German, Dutch, Scottish, and Irish settlers started moving to Canarsie in large numbers during the 1870s.

Ferry service remained infrequent because any increase to ferry service would require new vessels, and in order to do that, Jamaica Bay would need to be dredged at a very high cost. At the time, the bay was a few inches deep during low tide, and a narrow, channel stretched across the bay. The Canarsie Line employed steamboats, which were able to make a round trip in two hours and navigate the bay at low tide. During its early history, the route used steamers with a capacity of 250 passengers; later boats had larger capacity. In 1878, there were two proposals to create a more frequent transportation service between Canarsie and the Rockaways, but neither was implemented. One proposal entailed extending a railroad trestle into Jamaica Bay to shorten the ferry trip, while the other involved constructing a narrow-gauge railway that ran to Broad Channel, Queens. By that year, a rectangular peninsula extended into the bay. In 1880, the New York, Woodhaven and Rockaway Railroad constructed a trestle across the bay and started operating service across it. White&#x27;s Iron Steamboats, which sailed from Manhattan directly to the Rockaways, started operating two years later. Despite the existence of two competitors, the Canarsie railroad saw a healthy continued patronage because many passengers wanted to go to Canarsie itself.

The success of the Canarsie railroad and the variety of activities available at Canarsie Point both contributed to that area&#x27;s prosperity. In the late 1860s, a boat-rental company opened in Canarsie, and by 1880, there were ten such companies, with each company owning 50 boats on average. Rentals ranged from $5 to $7 on weekdays, and from $7 to $10 on weekends. An 1882 newspaper article observed that after traveling to Canarsie &quot;through a tract of country that looked like one vast lawn of green velvet&quot;, visitors could hire yachts or rowboats, or just breathe the fresh air. In 1883, a large double-decker barge for theatrical and musical performances, called the &quot;Floating Pavilion&quot;, was permanently anchored off the Canarsie shore. The depth of the bay was only deep at this point, making it suitable for bathing. A stage extended into the water for the performers, while bathhouses were placed on the barge&#x27;s lower tier. The steamer &quot;Edith Peck&quot; regularly traveled between the shore and the barge. Summer bungalows were also built along the bay shore, especially east of Canarsie Landing in an area called Sand Bay. Since the land was submerged during low tide, many of these houses were built on stilts. Electric lighting was installed in 1892 in a bid to attract visitors at night as well.

Canarsie also grew into a fishing hub by the late 19th century. In 1850, there were 75 fishermen in Flatlands, compared to 191 other individuals who worked in agriculture. By 1880, there were 200 fishermen in Flatlands, of which around 90% lived in Canarsie. In an 1865 account, &quot;The New York Times&quot; described the fishing village as a self-sufficient community that was &quot;a place of much resort for fishing, and one of the best near to the city&quot;. Boatbuilding also became popular: the number of boatbuilders in Canarsie grew from one in 1868 to eight in 1887. Much of the boats built in Canarsie were small rowboats, but some of them were large sloops. A 1900 magazine article described the Canarsie bay shore as &quot;a level expanse of marshy meadowland indented with shallow inlets and dotted with boathouses, fishing huts, and boat builders&#x27; cabins perched high and dry on wooden piles.&quot; Visitors could rent a rowboat and catch fish at Ruffle Bar or other locations within Jamaica Bay. If these visitors had enough money, they could rent a large sloop and head to the open ocean to fish.

===Fishing and amusement heyday===
By the start of the 20th century, Canarsie was a bustling amusement district. Of the 50 buildings along the Canarsie bay shore, eighteen were hotels. Three ferry systems operated routes to Bergen Island, Barren Island, Rockaway Beach, and other destinations in Jamaica Bay. A fourth would start operations in 1915, but shuttered in 1918 after several unprofitable seasons.

The Canarsie Line faced a steep drop in patronage in 1895, when frequent trolley service started operating to Coney Island. The line, which had operated a fleet of at least 10 vessels throughout its existence, stopped operating in 1905. The Canarsie Railroad, a subsidiary of the Brooklyn Rapid Transit Company, acquired the Brooklyn and Rockaway Beach line north of Rockaway Parkway on May 31, 1906. The BRT then announced that it would build an elevated railroad to Canarsie. This spurred speculation of rapid real estate development in Canarsie. Residents started constructing water and sewer pipes, as well as paving roads, in anticipation of this new development. The route south of Rockaway Parkway became an electric trolley shuttle route.

The Golden City Amusement Park opened in May 1907 at what is now Seaview Avenue, near Canarsie Pier. The owners hoped that the five-cent fare of the Canarsie Railroad would draw riders who would otherwise pay 10 cents to go to the Coney Island amusement area. Golden City cost $1 million to build and included a miniature railroad, a dance hall, a roller skating rink, and a roller coaster. There was also a wooden shorefront promenade and a 2,500-seat theater with 7,000 electric lights. The buildings were adorned with silver and gold. Part of Golden City&#x27;s appeal was that it was easily accessible from Manhattan via the elevated. In August of that year, the Golden City Construction was leased to the Canarsie Amusement Company, who planned to make the park one of the world&#x27;s largest. In 1909, the park was severely damaged by a fire, which also destroyed two hotels. The park was completely rebuilt for the next season.

Murphy&#x27;s Carousel was created in 1912 by the Stein and Goldstein Artistic Carousell Company of Brooklyn and installed in Golden City Park. A writer for &quot;The New York Times&quot; later noted that &quot;the horses were carved in Coney Island style, which eschewed the look of docile ponies and prancing fillies and produced much more muscular, ferocious creatures with bared teeth and heads often lifted in motion.&quot;

After the end of World War I, the New York City Department of Docks started renting piers along the Canarsie shore. These piers were transformed into summer vacation houses, boardwalks, industrial buildings, railroads, and piers, among other purposes. Some piers were used by boat yards, clubs, and builders, while other piers were rented for an expansion of Golden City Park.

===Decline of fishing and amusement===
By the 20th century, the fishing industry started to decline, since pollution had contaminated the oysters that occupied the bay. The shellfish in the bay began showing signs of chemical contamination in 1904, when an outbreak of typhoid fever was linked to a catch of shellfish in Inwood, New York, another town on the Jamaica Bay shore. In 1912, a typhoid outbreak in upstate Goshen, New York, was attributed to a banquet where Jamaica Bay oysters were served. In 1915, Canarsie itself was affected when 27 residents contracted typhoid from that year&#x27;s shellfish catch. Another 100 cases of gastroenteritis were traced to that year&#x27;s shellfish catch. By 1917, an estimated of sewage per day was being discharged into the bay. The whole industry was shuttered in 1921 because too much of the shellfish population had been infected.

The shoreline was further altered in 1926 through the construction of Canarsie Pier, a dock with a base. The pier was built as part of the greater improvement project for Jamaica Bay, wherein channels were being dredged in an effort to turn the bay into a large seaport. This was tied to improvement projects at Mill and Barren islands. This brought new industrial tenants along the Jamaica Bay shore, including an asphalt company and a construction company. The first industrial export from Canarsie Pier, a 500-ton shipment of scrap metal, departed in 1933. Planners also wanted to create a spur of the Long Island Rail Road&#x27;s Bay Ridge Branch south to Flatlands, with two branches to Canarsie and Mill Basin. In January 1931, the New York City Board of Estimate approved a plan to build railroads on both sides of Paerdegat Basin, connecting the LIRR to Canarsie Pier on the east and to Floyd Bennett Field on the west. Ultimately, Robert Moses, the New York City Parks Commissioner at the time, disapproved of the project. He moved to transform the bay into a city park instead.

The Canarsie Railroad was converted to the Canarsie subway line in 1928, providing direct access to Manhattan. After the subway line opened, officials began calling for a new ferry service between Canarsie and Rockaway Beach. The subway line was also supposed to help improve access to the proposed seaport, although the seaport was ultimately not built. The area remained a relatively remote outpost through the 1920s. Southern Italian immigrants, along with Jews, soon settled in the area.

Golden City was severely damaged by another fire in January 1934, which destroyed fifteen buildings and caused $60,000 worth of damage. This time, the amusement park&#x27;s operators decided not to rebuild, and the area spent its last days as a boat dock. In 1938, the city moved to acquire Golden City&#x27;s land, as well as improve sewage facilities within Canarsie. The hope was that the new Belt Parkway would attract drivers to Golden City from all over the metropolitan area. This did not happen, mainly because Robert Moses wanted to build the parkway through the amusement park. Golden City was demolished in 1939 to make way for the Belt Parkway. In the spring of 1940, when the Belt Parkway was built through the area, the carousel was moved to Baldwin, on the border abutting Freeport, on Long Island. The Works Progress Administration, in conjunction with the city&#x27;s Departments of Parks and Docks, built a recreation building on Canarsie Pier in 1941.

Ferry service at Canarsie Pier also withered away after the opening of the Marine Parkway–Gil Hodges Memorial Bridge in 1937, which connected Brooklyn to the Rockaways directly. In 1939, the WPA Guide to New York City mentioned that Canarsie was a &quot;sparsely settled community located on dispiriting flatlands&quot;. The Guide further described the burned-down amusement park, the ramshackle shacks, and Canarsie&#x27;s &quot;weedy lots and small truck farms cultivated by Italians&quot;. The book stated that riders on the Canarsie Pier trolley could see &quot;great stenches of dump and marsh&quot; interspersed between the &quot;unkempt gardens of run-down houses&quot; that the trolley&#x27;s route adjoined. Until 1939, dozens of disused trolley cars from around the city were dumped into a , lake in Canarsie. The Canarsie Pier trolley route was discontinued in 1942 and was replaced by the B42 streetcar (later bus) route, despite residents&#x27; protests. The right-of-way of the old Canarsie Pier trolley was abandoned.

In 1940, plans for a 14,000-seat arena in Canarsie were filed. This arena was apparently not built for several decades, because in 1974, many Canarsie residents announced their opposition to a proposed 15,000-seat arena in Brooklyn. One of the proposed sites of the arena was in Canarsie.
In 1941, the city announced that a new sewage plant would be built in Canarsie in order to reduce the amount of raw sewage going in Jamaica Bay.

===Residential development===
Canarsie only saw large residential development after World War II. Much of the area&#x27;s residential buildings were built from this post-war era up until the 1970s. Marshland in the area was filled in. Due to the large shortage of housing in New York City after the war, the city announced the construction of more than a thousand Quonset huts for veterans along the Jamaica Bay shore. The first huts were delivered in February 1946, and they were ready for occupancy by June of that year.

Starting in the 1950s, a series of suburban waterfront communities were being rapidly developed in Southeast Brooklyn, including in present-day Bergen Beach, Canarsie, and Mill Basin. Most of the new residents were whites who were moving out of neighborhoods such as East New York and Brownsville, which were gaining more black residents. In August 1951, work started on the Breukelen Houses, a 1,600-unit New York City Housing Authority development between East 103rd and East 105th Streets. The development was completed in October 1952. The Bayview Houses, another NYCHA development, started construction in 1954 and opened in 1955. The latter NYCHA development included a shopping center.

Houses were also constructed by private developers, but due to zoning laws, these residences were limited to three stories high. Vacant lots remained, but they were being very quickly developed at the time. Some lots along the Paerdegat Basin shore remained undeveloped through the 1960s. One plot, in particular, was supposed to become a public housing development for lower- and middle-class families. However, the plot was privately owned, and residents of nearby houses wanted to see a private developer build two-story middle-class detached houses at that location. This plot ultimately became a middle-income housing development with units for 6,000 families, built by the city under the Mitchell-Lama Housing Program.

In conjunction with this development, the federal and city governments each awarded hundreds of thousands of money toward improving parks and beaches in Canarsie. &quot;The New York Times&quot; predicted that Canarsie could become &quot;the next Jones Beach&quot;, a seaside resort of kinds. It was expected that there would be 5,000 more school-aged children living in Canarsie, so public and parochial schools were expanded as well. From 1950 to 1955, Canarsie&#x27;s population grew from 3,500 to 4,500. By 1963, a new 69th Precinct building for the New York City Police Department had to be constructed to accommodate the growing population. Many young families moved to Canarsie, and Canarsie High School was built to handle the newcomers. Canarsie High School opened in 1964.

The city proposed the construction of Flatlands Industrial Park, an industrial park, in Canarsie in 1959. The city took over the project after a previous attempt by a private developer had been canceled in 1958 due to a lack of tenants. The industrial park was to be located on a plot between East 99th and 108th Streets between Farragut Road and the Long Island Rail Road. Permission to clear the land was granted in 1962. East Brooklyn residents wished to see an educational complex on the site instead, on the grounds that not building an educational complex would prolong the school segregation prevalent in Eastern Brooklyn. The New York City Department of City Planning approved the plan anyway in 1965. The city added of land to the proposed industrial area by deleting plans for the side streets that were supposed to run through the area. These delays held up construction for nine years: in March 1966, an aide to Mayor John Lindsay reported that &quot;not one spadeful of dirt&quot; had been excavated on the site. Construction on the project started in summer 1966, and when the Flatlands Industrial Park opened in 1969, it became the city&#x27;s first publicly sponsored industrial complex.

Other development in Canarsie around this time included the middle-income Starrett City complex east of Fresh Creek. The complex is located east of Fresh Creek between Belt Parkway and Vandalia Avenue. In 1962, the California-based Thompson–Starrett Co. bought of land, upon which they proposed to construct apartment buildings. However, this did not occur due to a lack of funds, and the land was sold to a consortium of investors. The project&#x27;s new developers were a joint venture by the Starrett Corporation and the National Kinney Corporation, who renamed the project &quot;Starrett City&quot;. In 1967, the United Housing Foundation (UHF) announced a plan to construct a housing development with similarities to Co-op City in the Bronx. The UHF left the project in 1972, by which time part of Starrett City had already been built. Starrett City was dedicated in October 1974, and the first residents started moving in by the end of the year. At the time of opening, it had 5,881 units in 46 eleven- to twenty-story buildings.

=== Racial tensions and growing black population ===

In the late 1960s and early 1970s, parents of white students protested against the New York City Department of Education&#x27;s efforts to desegregate its District 18, which comprised schools in Canarsie and East Flatbush, by &quot;busing&quot; minority pupils into Canarsie schools. Many of the minority students were pupils from majority-black Brownsville, which bordered Canarsie to the north but was in a different school district. The racial tensions began in 1964, when the NYCDOE zoned some Brownsville students to Canarsie High School. In 1969, a fight between a white student and a black student at Canarsie High School caused the school to be closed down for three days. South Shore High School opened in 1970, albeit in a physically incomplete state: many rooms did not have furniture, plumbing, or public announcement systems until the middle of the school year. Major conflicts between white and black students occurred in September 1970 and April 1971. By the end of its first year, the principal was stepping down, and a coalition called &quot;Friends of South Shore&quot; had formed to protest the lack of resources or opportunities available at that school.

The 1972–1973 school year was a tumultuous one for Canarsie. On September 12, 1972, the first day of the school year, District 18 officials refused to enroll approximately 90 students from Brownsville into IS 285, a school in East Flatbush. This change came after IS 285 had been enrolling Brownsville students for several years. Brownsville parents had already been hesitant to enroll their students into schools in Canarsie due to large opposition there. By the start of October, these students had still not been able to start school. On October 14, the NYCDOE came up with a solution regarding approximately 40 of these students: send eleven to IS 285, and enroll the rest within IS 211 in Canarsie. (The number of Brownsville students enrolled in IS 211 was variously given as either 29 or 31. That number later rose to 32.) In response, on October 17, hundreds of white parents from Canarsie showed up to protest outside IS 211 and IS 267. They announced their intention to keep protesting unless the black students were reassigned to another school. Because the parents&#x27; protests blocked these schools&#x27; entrances, the schools were closed for the rest of that day. These protests went on for three days until the NYCDOE threatened a writ of court action against these parents.

The NYCDOE unsuccessfully attempted to broker a compromise between parents in Brownsville and Canarsie. On October 24, 1972, NYCDOE Chairman Harvey B. Scribner withdrew enrollment for the Brownsville students who were going to IS 211. The Brownsville parents brought their students to IS 211 the next day and started protesting outside the school. On October 26, the NYCDOE reversed Scribner&#x27;s order, re-enrolling the black students from Brownsville. The same day, a police guard escorted 28 Brownsville students to their first day of classes at IS 211, amid a crowd of over 1,000 protesters. Of 10,000 students enrolled in Canarsie public schools, only 850 had gone to school on October 26. Due to low attendance, six Canarsie schools were closed for that day. By November 1, the fifth day of the boycott, the number of protesters had subsided, but the boycott was still ongoing. The boycott was broken on November 10, twelve days after it started.
As part of the terms to end the boycott, a new zoning plan for the area was ordered. The new plan, released on December 6, was also controversial because it involved rezoning many black students. A second new plan was then ordered. Many Canarsie parents, who complained that it was taking too long to come up with a new zoning plan, initiated a second boycott on March 1, 1973. This boycott spread to a school in Mill Basin, but a similar one in Gravesend was unsuccessful. The boycott ended on April 1, after parents agreed almost unanimously to prohibit any more Brownsville students from enrolling in Canarsie schools. Students who were already enrolled were allowed to stay until they graduated. In total, white students boycotted their schools for seven weeks of the 1972–1973 school year. In 1978, a NYCDOE integration plan was tentatively approved by the state. Black students from Brownsville could enroll in Canarsie schools as long as they did not make up a majority of the student population there.

Of the 80,000 Canarsie residents in 1972, about 2.5% were black. Canarsie&#x27;s black residents were mostly concentrated in the NYCHA developments, which were integrated with the detached houses in the rest of the neighborhood. The conflict was compared to the Little Rock Nine controversy in 1957, where presidential intervention had been required in order to integrate nine black students into a majority-white school. One writer described the Canarsie school conflict as a time when white residents felt that &quot;things began to go awry&quot;. The conflict marked the beginning of white Canarsie residents&#x27; shift from liberalism to conservatism. By 1978, Canarsie was characterized as &quot;a conservative, middle-class Jewish and Italian section of Brooklyn&quot;. The elected leadership of District 18 became ethnically disproportionate to the student body: by 1983, most of the District 18 board members were white, even though 75% of the district&#x27;s students were black. This disproportionate representation continued through 1994, when the mostly-white members of District 18 opposed a plan to split off several schools into a nearby district in order to increase the proportion of black votes in both districts. That plan was subsequently canceled.

In 1989, construction commenced on the Seaview Estates condominiums. The project was characterized as Canarsie&#x27;s first large new residential development in decades. The development opened in 2003.

In the 1980s, the white residents of Canarsie started moving away, and black residents started moving in. From 1980 to 1990, the proportion of Canarsie&#x27;s population who was white dropped from 90% to 75%. Much of Canarsie&#x27;s white population left for the suburbs of Staten Island, Queens, Long Island, and New Jersey, part of a national phenomenon referred to as &quot;white flight&quot;. This culminated in a spate of racial conflicts in 1991, where 14 racial-bias incidents were recorded within a month and a half. These incidents were committed by both blacks against whites, and by whites against blacks. The black population of Canarsie rose from 10% in 1990 to 60% in 2000, with most of the new residents being Caribbean and West Indian immigrants. By 2010, the neighborhood was 78% black, and between 47% and 60% of the total residents were immigrants from the Caribbean.

The late-2000s subprime mortgage crisis affected the 11236 zip code, which includes Canarsie and Flatlands, more than any other neighborhood in the city. The area had 1,930 subprime mortgages, the most of any city neighborhood; of these, twelve percent were facing foreclosure proceedings. During Hurricane Sandy in October 2012, the basements of many homes in Canarsie were flooded. By June 2013, more than 10% of the residential buildings within Canarsie&#x27;s zip code, 11236, were being foreclosed upon. In the aftermath of Hurricane Sandy, the Federal Emergency Management Agency started redrawing flood-risk maps in New York City to account for climate change. The original flood map in 1983 labeled 26 buildings under the FEMA &quot;flood zone&quot;, but the new flood map proposed increasing that total to 5,000 buildings. Many area homeowners opposed the maps because they could not afford flood insurance if they were rezoned under the FEMA flood zone.

==Community==

Canarsie is characterized as a working- to middle-class neighborhood. Canarsie&#x27;s residences consist mainly of one- and two-family homes. Most houses are detached, unlike elsewhere in Brooklyn where townhouses are more common. The houses between East 105th and East 108th Streets typically have backyards, while large houses dating to the 1910s and 1920s can be found north of Flatlands Avenue. Eastern Canarsie tends to have more dense concentrations of housing than western Canarsie, while the center of the neighborhood has very dense development. There are two large public housing developments, the Breuckelen Houses and the Bayview Houses, both operated by the New York City Housing Authority. Canarsie also contains a gated community, the Seaview Estates condominium complex, which has five buildings as well as its own tennis court and swimming pool.

Brooklyn Community District 18, which encompasses Canarsie and Flatlands, has a poverty rate of 10%, lower than the city&#x27;s 20% overall poverty rate, and a homeownership rate of 60%, higher than the city&#x27;s 30% overall homeownership rate.

=== Places of interest ===
There are two shopping centers in Canarsie. One of them is Canarsie Plaza, located on Avenue D. Opened in 2011, the mall contains of retail space. The Brooklyn Terminal Market is located adjacent to Canarsie Plaza, and sells horticultural items such as plants, trees, and fruits.

The Canarsie Cemetery is located at Remsen Avenue and Avenue K. It was owned by the Remsen family until 1888, when they sold it to the town of Flatlands. In 1898, the cemetery became part of New York City, who became the new owner of the cemetery. Over the next century, 6,400 corpses were interred at the Canarsie Cemetery, including Civil War and Spanish–American War veterans. The city announced its intention to sell Canarsie Cemetery in 1982, but for more than 25 years, its efforts to sell were unsuccessful. Cypress Hills, the operator of another cemetery straddling Brooklyn and Queens, purchased Canarsie Cemetery in 2010. By that time, there had been 8,000 interments, with space for 6,000 more corpses.

==Demographics==
Based on data from the 2010 United States Census, the population of Canarsie was 83,693, a decrease of 1,365 (1.6%) from the 85,058 counted in 2000.

The entirety of Community District 18, which comprises Canarsie and Flatlands, had 165,543 inhabitants as of NYC Health&#x27;s 2018 Community Health Profile, with an average life expectancy of 82.0 years. This is slightly higher than the median life expectancy of 81.2 for all New York City neighborhoods. Most inhabitants are middle-aged adults and youth: 25% are between the ages of 0–17, 29% between 25 and 44, and 24% between 45 and 64. The ratio of college-aged and elderly residents was lower, at 9% and 13% respectively.

Rent burden, or the percentage of residents who have difficulty paying their rent, is 50% in Canarsie and Flatlands, lower than the citywide and boroughwide rates of 52% and 51% respectively. Based on this calculation, , Canarsie and Flatlands are considered to be higher-income relative to the rest of the city.

The 2020 census data from the New York City Department of City Planning shows that there were fewer than 5,000 white residents, fewer than 5,000 Asian residents, between 5,000 and 9,999 Hispanic residents, and over 40,000 black residents.

During the 1990s, much of Canarsie&#x27;s white population left for the suburbs as part of a national phenomenon referred to as &quot;white flight&quot;. In the early 21st century, Canarsie&#x27;s population is mostly black due to significant West Indian immigration in the area. East Brooklyn Community High School now serves the transfer student population.

== Police and crime ==
Canarsie is primarily served by the NYPD&#x27;s 69th Precinct, located at 9720 Foster Avenue, although the small area west of the Bay Ridge Branch tracks falls under the 67th Precinct, located at 2820 Snyder Avenue.

==Recreation==
===Canarsie Pier===
Canarsie Pier, a fishing spot and recreation area on Jamaica Bay, is located in the southern part of the neighborhood at the end of Rockaway Parkway. The pier is part of the Gateway National Recreation Area&#x27;s Jamaica Bay Unit, operated by the National Park Service. The city renovated the pier in 1971, and the NPS spent $5 million to renovate the pier again in 1992. The pier contains a restaurant and a visitor center.

===Canarsie Park===
Canarsie Park (aka Seaview Park), operated by New York City Department of Parks and Recreation (NYC Parks), is located in two pieces south of Seaview Avenue: one west of East 93rd Street, and another east of East 102nd Street. In 1895 and 1896, the city acquired the plot of land bound by East 88th and East 93rd Streets between Seaview and Skidmore Avenues. At the time, the land contained the Jans Martense Schenck house. The park was expanded in 1934 after the city purchased land from the Department of Docks, and a playground was built at Seaview Avenue and East 93rd Street in 1936. Canarsie Park grew again in 1939 and 1948 using parcels from the New York City Board of Estimate. A fourth expansion occurred in 1954 when some land next to Fresh Creek Basin was purchased. The Seaview Avenue playground was renovated in the mid-1990s. Canarsie Park was renovated in the 2000s. During the renovation, a skatepark, a cricket field, and a nature trail were added. This renovation, and the upkeep of other parks in Canarsie, was attributed to an infusion of $13 million in funds from City Councilman Lewis A. Fidler, who represented Community Board 18 at the time. There are also facilities for baseball, soccer, basketball, and tennis, as well as a dog run. New York Road Runners hosts a weekly Open Run in the park.

===Other parks===
The neighborhood has several other parks operated by NYC Parks. Bayview Playground is located at Seaview Avenue and East 100th Street, within the Bayview Houses and next to PS 272. The original plot for the playground was acquired in 1955, and NYCHA gave additional land in 1962. Bayview Playground contains basketball and handball courts, as well as a play area and fitness area.

Bildersee Playground is located on Flatlands Avenue between East 81st and East 82nd Streets. Its namesake, Isaac Bildersee, was an assistant public school superintendent for Brooklyn during the 1940s. The city purchased the land in 1960 so it could construct IS 68, the Isaac Bildersee School, along with an accompanying playground. Bildersee Playground opened along with the school in 1965. It contains basketball and handball courts, as well as a play area.

Curtis Playground is located on Foster Avenue between East 81st and East 82nd Streets. It contains basketball courts as well as fitness and play areas.

Sledge Playground is located on East 95th Street between Holmes Lane and Avenue L. The park originally opened in 1934 on land that was acquired by the city in 1924. In 1984, it was renamed after Cecil Frank Sledge, an NYPD officer for the 69th Precinct who was killed in the line of duty in 1980. Sledge Playground was renovated in 1997–1998.

100% Playground is located on Glenwood Road between East 100th and East 101st Streets. It contains handball courts, a playground, and spray showers.

In 1978, the city proposed an additional park between East 102nd and East 108th Streets along Jamaica Bay, but residents opposed the new park because they wanted the funds to pay for existing parks&#x27; upkeep.

== Transportation ==
The BMT Canarsie Line, on which the New York City Subway&#x27;s runs, terminates at Canarsie–Rockaway Parkway near the northern end of the neighborhood. There is also a subway station at East 105th Street between Foster Avenue and Farragut Road. The subway system&#x27;s only level crossing was located at East 105th Street until it was closed by 1973 as part of the Flatlands Industrial Park project.

The MTA Regional Bus Operations&#x27; , and BM2 routes also run through Canarsie. The B42 route along Rockaway Parkway is a direct descendant of the former trolley route that ran to Canarsie Pier. There is a free direct transfer between the B42 and the subway at Rockaway Parkway. Other New York City Bus routes are the on Avenue B between Ralph and Remsen Avenues and with the on Church Avenue between Remsen Avenue and East 93rd Street, as well as the on Ralph Avenue between Avenue A and Flatlands Avenue, close to the East Flatbush and Flatlands neighborhoods.

The principal roadways through Canarsie are Remsen Avenue, Rockaway Parkway, and Flatlands Avenue. The Belt Parkway, a limited-access parkway, serves Canarsie via an exit at Canarsie Pier.

==Education==
Canarsie and Flatlands generally has a similar ratio of college-educated residents to the rest of the city . Though 40% of residents age 25 and older have a college education or higher, 13% have less than a high school education and 48% are high school graduates or have some college education. By contrast, 40% of Brooklynites and 38% of city residents have a college education or higher. The percentage of Canarsie and Flatlands students excelling in math rose from 40 percent in 2000 to 57 percent in 2011, though reading achievement decreased from 48% to 46% during the same time period.

Canarsie and Flatlands&#x27;s rate of elementary school student absenteeism is slightly lower than the rest of New York City. In Canarsie and Flatlands, 17% of elementary school students missed twenty or more days per school year, compared to the citywide average of 20% of students. Additionally, 80% of high school students in Canarsie and Flatlands graduate on time, equal to the citywide average of 75% of students.

===Schools===
Public elementary schools in Canarsie include PS 114, PS 115, PS 272, PS 276, PS 279, IS 68, and IS 211. These schools are all operated by the New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE).

Canarsie also contains buildings formerly occupied by the South Shore High School and Canarsie High School, which now serve as educational campuses. In late fall 2006, Mayor Michael Bloomberg announced that five troubled high schools would close by 2010, including South Shore and Canarsie High Schools. According to a NYCDOE spokesperson, the closings were attributed to &quot;dismal graduation rates, consistent low test scores, a poor history of educating, low performing students, and lackluster demand.&quot;

Canarsie and Flatlands generally has a similar ratio of college-educated residents than the rest of the city . A 2018 study found that 38% of residents age 25 and older have a college education or higher, but 14% have less than a high school education and 49% are high school graduates with some college education. By contrast, 38% of Brooklynites and 41% of city residents have a college education or higher. The percentage of Canarsie and Flatlands students excelling in math has increased from 40 percent in 2000 to 57.4 percent in 2011, but within the same time period, reading proficiency dropped from 48% to 45.6%.

=== Libraries ===
The Brooklyn Public Library (BPL) has two branches in Canarsie. The Canarsie branch is located at 1580 Rockaway Parkway near Avenue J. It opened in 1909 with a small circulating connection and became a BPL branch in 1932. Since then, it has relocated twice to accommodate high patronage. The Jamaica Bay branch is located at 9727 Seaview Avenue between Rockaway Parkway and East 98th Street, and it opened in 1973. In addition, the Paerdegat branch is located just west of Canarsie, at 850 East 59th Street near Paerdegat Avenue South.

==Media==
&quot;The Canarsie Courier&quot;, published every Thursday, is the oldest weekly publication in Brooklyn and is still in publication. It was founded by Walter S. Patrick on April 22, 1921. The &quot;Courier&quot; was then purchased by brothers Bob and Joe Samitz in 1959. After the death of Joe Samitz, Mary Samitz became co-publisher of the paper with her husband Bob and then became the sole publisher after Bob&#x27;s death in 1998. The Samitz family then sold the paper to Donna Marra and Sandra Greco. Marra became the sole publisher in 2010.

<doc id="731899" wikidata="Q1629121" url="?curid=731899" title="LaSalle, Quebec">
<text>LaSalle () is the most southerly borough (&quot;arrondissement&quot;) of the city of Montreal, Quebec, Canada. It is located in the south-west portion of the Island of Montreal, along the Saint Lawrence River. Prior to 2002, it was a separate municipality that had been incorporated in 1912.

==History==
LaSalle was named for the area&#x27;s first &quot;seigneur&quot;, French explorer René-Robert Cavelier de La Salle (1643–1687). The area became part of a municipality during the mid 19th century, and LaSalle was incorporated as an independent municipality in 1912.

The Lachine Rapids are situated within LaSalle territory. The name Lachine, which is also the name of the neighbouring borough, stayed because the LaSalle area was part of the parish of Saints-Anges-de-la-Chine during the French regime period. Before the creation of the Lachine Canal in the 1820s, the rapids had to be portaged on a trail called &quot;Chemin LaSalle&quot; (what is now LaSalle Boulevard).

LaSalle is known for its many public schools, most notably l&#x27;École secondaire Cavelier-de-LaSalle, known as one of the top talent-producing schools in the fields of dance and song. The other common public school in LaSalle is LaSalle Community Comprehensive High School, opened many years ago and home to many cultures.

Michel Leduc, who served as mayor from 1983 to December 31, 2001, was the last mayor of an independent LaSalle. Under Leduc, LaSalle became the first large city in Quebec to launch a large recycling program. LaSalle was annexed by the city of Montreal on January 1, 2002, along with a number of other cities on the Island of Montreal.

==Geography==

LaSalle is bounded by five adjacent municipalities and boroughs, these being Lachine towards the west, Verdun and the Sud-Ouest neighbourhood of Ville-Émard to the north-east, and Montreal West and the neighbourhood of Notre-Dame-de-Grâce within the borough of Côte-des-Neiges–Notre-Dame-de-Grâce towards the north, the latter two being divided by Autoroute 20 as well as the Lachine Canal. To its south and east lies the shore of the Saint Lawrence River, specifically a portion of the river known as the Lachine Rapids.

==Government==
===Federal and provincial elections===

Federally, the western part of the borough is located in Dorval—Lachine—LaSalle and the eastern part in LaSalle—Émard—Verdun. They are represented by Anju Dhillon of the Liberal Party of Canada and Louis-Philippe Sauvé of the Bloc Québecois.

Provincially, the entire borough is within the electoral district of Marguerite-Bourgeoys represented by Fred Beauchemin of the Quebec Liberal Party.

===Borough government===

The borough is divided into two districts.

*Cecil-P.-Newman (North)
*Sault-Saint-Louis (South)

The borough elects a borough mayor, two city councillors, and four borough councillors.

As of the November 7, 2021 Montreal municipal election, the current borough council consists of the following councillors:

<doc id="731905" wikidata="Q14875569" url="?curid=731905" title="Sainte-Foy, Quebec City">
<text>Sainte-Foy (; ) is a former city in central Quebec, Canada alongside the Saint Lawrence River. It was amalgamated into Quebec City at the start of 2002. Most of the formerly independent municipality of Sainte-Foy is located in the borough () of Sainte-Foy–Sillery–Cap-Rouge — initially as one of the two constituent districts of the former borough of Sainte-Foy–Sillery. On 1 November 2009, Sainte-Foy was subdivided into four separate districts: Cité-Universitaire, Plateau, Saint-Louis, Pointe-de-Sainte-Foy, when the borough of Sainte-Foy–Sillery–Cap-Rouge was formed.

Sainte-Foy is a major suburban neighbourhood west of downtown Quebec City. It plays a large part in Quebec City&#x27;s economic life, with the Jean Lesage International Airport, Université Laval, multiple shopping malls, and both bridges to the south shore of the Saint Lawrence River.

== Demographics ==
According to the 2006 Canadian Census:

* Population: 
* % change (2001–2006): +5.1
* Dwellings: 
* Number of families: 
* Area (km2): 83.87 km2
* Density (persons per km2): 909.3

== History ==
In 1669, missionary priest Pierre-Joseph-Marie Chaumonot erected a chapel for the Huron, dedicated to Notre-Dame de la Foy. The name means Our Lady of Faith. Sainte-Foy developed around the chapel, first as a small settlement of Christian Indians, added to by traders and merchants.

The Battle of Sainte-Foy on April 28, 1760, sometimes called the Battle of Quebec, was a victory for the French in the Seven Years&#x27; War (known in the United States as the French and Indian War for the North American front). Their forces were commanded by Chevalier de Lévis and defeated the British army under James Murray. This battle proved to be much bloodier than the battle of the Plains of Abraham the previous September, with higher total casualties on both sides – 833 French casualties and 1,124 British. Despite this the French were unable to take Quebec and it was to be the last French victory in the Seven Years&#x27; War, which the British ultimately won. France ceded its territories in North America east of the Mississippi River to the British.

Sainte-Foy&#x27;s long-time flamboyant mayor, Andrée Boucher, was defeated when she ran for mayor of the amalgamated Quebec City. She became a radio host. In 2005, she ran again for mayor after Jean-Paul L&#x27;Allier retired. This time she won, without hiring an election team or paying for media advertisements, and with making very few public appearances or debates. She has since died since her last political position.

=== Amalgamation with Quebec City ===
On 1 January 2002 the city was merged, along with many other suburbs, with Quebec City with neither a public referendum nor widespread public approval. A vote was finally held on June 20, 2004, giving cities an opportunity to leave the new municipal structure. Only Saint-Augustin-de-Desmaures and L&#x27;Ancienne-Lorette left. Many believed that a &quot;defusion&quot; would lead only to an eventual and inevitable &quot;refusion&quot;. Many people said they were discouraged from voting by the prospect of spending a lot of money undoing what had just been done. In most of the older suburbs not enough votes were cast for the vote to be valid.

== Districts ==
* Cité universitaire – centred around Université Laval, it has a very large student population. The majority of Saint-Foy&#x27;s commercial activity is found along Laurier Boulevard, such as Laurier Québec, Place Sainte-Foy and Place de la Cité shopping malls. A number of large hotels and office buildings line the boulevard and this area has become one of the city&#x27;s major commercial centres.
* Saint-Louis – leafy residential area south of Laurier Boulevard towards the river. Contains the Aquarium du Québec.
* Plateau – sprawling suburban area north of Boulevard Laurier, featuring post-war single storey houses and an abundance of 1960s apartment blocks.

* Pointe-de-Sainte-Foy – recent large residential development, centred on the Campanile shopping street. The neighbourhood consists mostly of large modern condo and apartment blocks.
* L&#x27;Aéroport – industrial area centred on the Jean Lesage International Airport with many big-box stores. L&#x27;Aéroport district&#x27;s land was initially part of the parish of Notre-Dame-de-Lorette —later the independent city of L&#x27;Ancienne-Lorette. L&#x27;Aéroport&#x27;s territory was merged into the formerly independent city of Sainte-Foy&#x27;s jurisdiction in 1971. However, L&#x27;Aéroport became a district of the former borough of Laurentien, in 2002. When Laurentien was dissolved as an administrative entity as part of the 2009 reorganization of Quebec City&#x27;s boroughs, L&#x27;Aéroport became a district of Sainte-Foy–Sillery–Cap-Rouge.

== Economy ==
Aeropro has its head office on the grounds of Jean Lesage Airport in Sainte-Foy. It conducts business charters and recreational and sightseeing flights Prior to its dissolution, regional airline Air Nova had its Quebec offices in Sainte-Foy.

Major companies operating in the district include PriceWaterhouseCoopers, Ernst &amp; Young, Microsoft and the headquarters of SSQ Financial Group.

Sainte-Foy is at the northern end of the Quebec Bridge, which links to the south shore of the Saint Lawrence River at Lévis.

== Education ==

Sainte-Foy is also the site of many educational institutions:

* Université Laval
* Cégep Sainte-Foy
* Cégep Garneau
* Collège de Champigny
* Champlain College St. Lawrence
* Rochebelle High School – 
* Collège des Compagnons – 
* Université du Québec École Nationale d&#x27;Administration Publique
== Transport ==
Sainte-Foy station is a VIA Rail station on the Quebec City–Windsor Corridor. It is roughly three kilometres from the Gare d&#x27;Autocar de Ste-Foy, and ten kilometres from Jean Lesage Airport.

The Gare d&#x27;Autocar is a regional hub for Orleans Express, Intercar, the Réseau de transport de la Capitale, the Société de transport de Lévis, and several regional government-funded shuttles, for example Portneuf.

Air France has a bus service from Sainte-Foy bus station to Montreal Dorval Airport for its customers only.

== Climate ==

== Recreation ==

Sainte-Foy possesses has three ice hockey rinks, one sports centre, 33 soccer fields, 2 Interior Pools, 13 exterior pools, three cinemas, one theatre, Laurier Québec, Place de La Cite, and La Pyramide. Sainte-Foy also has excellent representation in all sports: the Governors in hockey, the Caravelles and Arsenal in soccer, and the Musketeers ESCC in basketball.

<text>Charlesbourg () is a borough of Quebec City, in the northeastern part of the city, west of the borough of Beauport.

==History==
The origins of Charlesbourg began with the concession of the seigniory of Notre-Dame-des-Anges in 1626. The seigniory extended from the Charles River northward, encompassing the modern boroughs of Limoilou and Charlesbourg. In 1665, the new Intendant of Justice, Jean Talon, set out to establish three new villages further north on the plateau. That caused friction with the Jesuits who were the seignors of the area.

The first of the villages consisted of a 25-arpent square, in which a five-arpent square (the &quot;trait carré&quot;) was reserved for the church, presbytery and cemetery. The homes of the settlers located on the periphery of the Trait Carré and their trapezoidal plots of land form a star shape. The second village, which is semicircular due to lack of space, was established just to the south at Petite-Auvergne and the third was established in 1667 in Bourg-Royal, to the northeast. This particular arrangement is still visible from the air and is the hallmark of Charlesbourg.

Charlesbourg is, first and foremost, an agricultural area, in addition to becoming a vacation destination for inhabitants of Quebec City in the first half of the 20th century. It became urbanized in the second half of the 20th century and became a suburb of Quebec City. In 1976, the municipalities of Charlesbourg-Est, Notre-Dame-des-Laurentides, Orsainville and the city of Charlesbourg were merged into the city of Charlesbourg. In 2002, Charlesbourg was in turn merged with other municipalities in Quebec City to form a new, large city. Charlesbourg became one of the boroughs of Quebec City.

Charlesbourg&#x27;s earlier name was Bourg Royal, but it was changed in honour of Charles Borromeo, its patron saint. This Catholic saint was a leading figure of the Counter-Reformation combat against the Protestant Reformation.

An 18th-century British map depicts the place name Charlebourg.
==Territory==
The territory of the borough is divided in six quarters, only two of which have official names: Notre-Dame-des-Laurentides and Des Jésuites. The borough is also equally divided into five electoral districts for municipal elections. The quarters and districts do not correspond, unlike for other boroughs such as Beauport.

The other four quarters have numeric identifiers and will receive official names when neighborhood councils are formed and names are adopted.

===Quarters===
* Notre-Dame-des-Laurentides
* Des Jésuites
* Orsainville, officially &quot;Quarter 4-2&quot;
Corresponds to the former city of Orsainville.
* Bourg-Royal, officially &quot;Quarter 4-3&quot;
Corresponds to the former municipality of Charlesbourg-Est.
* Trait-Carré, officially &quot;Quarter 4-5&quot;
Includes the portion of the borough located west of Henri-Bourassa Boulevard, between the &quot;Corridor des Cheminots&quot; to the south and Jean-Talon Boulevard to the North. In particular, the historic borough of Charlesbourg - the Trait-Carré - with the Church of Saint-Charles-Borromée, listed as an historic monument in 1959, as well as the Magella-Paradis House and the Moulin des Jesuites.
* Saint-Rodrigue, officially &quot;Quarter 4-6&quot;
Corresponds to the former parish of Saint-Rodrigue. It is bounded on the NNW by the Corridor des Cheminots, a cycle track located partly on an old railway track. It is a residential service area. The La Fourmilière Primary School dates back to the 1940s and the Catholic church dates to 1962. The &quot;Les Galeries Charlebourg&quot; shopping center and Loblaws supermarket were built on the site of an important fur trading post. The area is also home to the offices of the Quebec Ministry of Natural Resources.

==Demographics==
This residential suburb of Quebec City is the fourth-largest urban centre of the Québec Urban Community. Like Beauport, it has increased by more than 20,000 people over the last 25 years.

According to the Canada 2006 Census:

*Population: 72,814 
*% Change (2001-2006): +3.6
*Dwellings: 33,497
*Area (km²): 66.29

<doc id="731910" wikidata="Q1325316" url="?curid=731910" title="Saint-Leonard, Quebec">
<text>Saint-Leonard ( ; ) is a borough (&quot;arrondissement&quot;) of Montreal, Quebec, Canada. Formerly a separate city, it was amalgamated into the city of Montreal in 2002. The former city was originally called Saint-Leonard de Port Maurice after Leonard of Port Maurice, an Italian saint. The borough is home to Montreal&#x27;s Via Italia.

== Geography ==
Saint-Leonard is located in the northeastern part of the Island of Montreal. It is bordered by five boroughs: Montréal-Nord to the north and northwest, Anjou to the east, Mercier–Hochelaga-Maisonneuve to the southeast, Rosemont–La-Petite-Patrie to the south and Villeray–Saint-Michel–Parc-Extension to the southwest and west. Jean-Talon Street East (Rue Jean-Talon Est) traverses through the borough, connecting it to Villeray–Saint-Michel–Parc-Extension and Anjou.

== Features ==

=== Highways ===
Quebec Autoroute 40 (&quot;Autoroute Métropolitaine&quot;), part of the Trans-Canada Highway, traverses the area. Exits 76, 77 and 78 are in Saint-Leonard.

=== Public Transportation ===
Public transportation in Saint-Leonard is managed by the &quot;Société de transport de Montréal&quot; (STM). Saint-Leonard has an extensive bus network in the borough with a total of 14 bus routes. There are 12 daytime routes including two express routes and 2 night routes. The STM&#x27;s 141 Jean-Talon Est bus serves Jean-Talon Street East, with buses taking off at every 10 minutes maximum during peak hours from Saint-Michel and Honoré-Beaugrand metro stations. The Mascouche Exo line runs through the borough and has a stop at Gare Saint-Léonard-Montréal-Nord. While lacking in a connection to the Metro system, the future Blue Line extension of the Montreal Metro, which is previewed to open in 2029, will have three stations located in Saint-Leonard, with all of them located along Jean-Talon Street East. The REM de l&#x27;est is a planned light rail rapid transit system that would connect Saint-Leonard and the rest of eastern Montreal to the Downtown core in less than 30 minutes. It will have a connection to the metro&#x27;s future Blue Line extension at Lacordaire.

=== Malls ===
Carrefour Langelier is a small-sized shopping mall located in Saint-Leonard, at the corner of Jean-Talon Street East and Langelier Boulevard. Saint-Leonard is also home to the Le Boulevard shopping centre, although a portion of the mall is actually located in Villeray–Saint-Michel–Parc-Extension.

=== Community Centre ===
An important English, French and Italian community centre, the Leonardo Da Vinci Centre (&quot;Centre Leonardo Da Vinci&quot;) is located along Lacordaire Boulevard, near Aréna Martin Brodeur.

==History==
The parish of Saint-Leonard-de-Port-Maurice was founded in April 1886 and eventually became the City of Saint-Leonard-de-Port-Maurice on March 5, 1915. Saint-Leonard was traditionally a rural francophone hamlet with under a thousand people until the mid-twentieth century. The town became increasingly developed and urban throughout the twentieth century, benefiting from the expansion of the City of Montreal and a massive wave of Italian immigration which enriched life in the area with numerous cafes and restaurants. In 2016, the number of Italian Canadians in Saint-Leonard was 25,510. Maghrebis people make up a diverse group in the city; 3,900 people are of Berber ethnic origin and 3,770 people are of Arab ethnic origin. It is one of the most diverse and multi-cultural neighbourhoods on the Island of Montreal and about 49% of the population is foreign-born. Today, the Saint-Leonard has the 10th highest population of Montreal&#x27;s 19 boroughs and is the 8th most densely populated borough.

==Italian Canadian presence==
The borough has one of the highest concentrations of Italian Canadians in the city, along with Rivière-des-Prairies (RDP). As such, it has surpassed Montreal&#x27;s rapidly gentrifying Little Italy as the centre for Italian culture in the city, with numerous cultural institutions and commercial enterprises serving the city&#x27;s second-most populous cultural community. The stretch of Jean Talon Street between Langelier and Viau Boulevards has become known as Via Italia. By necessity, many services are available in Italian, English and French (the Leonardo da Vinci Centre, for instance, offers cultural activities and events in the three languages). The borough is characterized by its spacious, wide-set semi-detached brick duplexes (and triplexes, four-plexes, and five-plexes — an architectural style unique to Montreal), backyard vegetable gardens, Italian bars (cafés), and pastry shops serving Italian-Canadian staples such as cannoli, sfogliatelle, and zeppole. At some times of year, it is possible to observe seasonal Italian traditions like the making of wine, cheese, sausage, and tomato sauce in quantity. These activities bring extended families and neighbours together and often spill out into front driveways.

==Demographics==

===Home language (2016)=== 
===Mother Tongue (2016)=== 

===Migration===
==Sports and recreation==

===Aquatics===

The Saint-Leonard Aquatic Complex () was built in 2006 and is home to three swimming pools: one recreational basin, one pool and one acclimation basin that includes a turbo bath spa. There are also two saunas, one for women and one for men.

===Skate parks===

Skaters can skate safely in the skate park located in Parc Delorme. Admission to the park is free, and it is open to the public May through October.

===Cycling paths===

Saint-Leonard has 10 km of bike paths around the borough, that connect various parks, pools and municipal structures. On November 1, 2022, the city of Montreal announced its Vision vélo 2023-2027 which plans to increase Montreal&#x27;s cycling network by 200 km. This includes 2 REV (Réseau Express Vélo) routes passing through Saint-Leonard on Lacordaire Boulevard and the other on Jean-Talon Street. If all goes to plan this will be the first time that Saint-Leonard will be connected to the rest of the Montreal bike network.

A bike repair station is located next to the bike path on the Boulevard Robert entrance to Parc Wilfrid-Bastien.

===Hockey===

Saint-Léonard has two hockey arenas, Aréna Martin Brodeur, located on 5300 Boulevard Robert, and Aréna Roberto Luongo, located on 7755 Rue Colbert. These arenas host local games, and usually provide food, locker rooms, showers and public free-skating.

Saint-Léonard also has many outdoor hockey rinks in the winter. There are seven rinks set up before winter, and then they are iced when the temperature is appropriate. There was a delay of rink making in 2007 when the weather was warmer than usual.

===Soccer===

Soccer is a very popular sport for the youth in Saint-Léonard. Every large public park in Saint-Léonard has a soccer field open to the public.

===Figure skating===

Both Saint-Léonard arenas are used by the figure skating community. Many Olympic and World Champions have trained here in different disciplines like singles, pairs, dance and synchronized skating.

===Other activities===

The city has a domed football stadium, Stade Hébert, which is home to the Saint-Léonard Cougars of the CJFL football league.

There are bocce courts located at almost every public park.

There are two ping-pong tables located at Parc Delorme.

Saint-Léonard contains a cavern located at Pie XII Park.

==Education==

Since the replacement of denominational (Catholic/Protestant) school boards with linguistic (French/English) ones, Saint-Léonard is served by one school board for the English schools and a school service centre for French schools. All French schools are part of the Centre de services scolaire de la Pointe-de-l&#x27;Île (CSSPÎ) while all English schools are part of the English Montreal School Board (EMSB).

Saint-Léonard&#x27;s first library opened in 1966, in a very modest house on Jarry Street. In 1974, the new city hall and current library were built side by side on Lacordaire Boulevard (photo to the right). Expanded in 1984, the library has modernized over the years and is home to the Port-Maurice Gallery.

==Government==

=== Federal and Provincial Representation ===
Saint-Léonard leans heavily Liberal at both the provincial and federal levels. While at the municipal level it leans exclusively towards Ensemble Montréal.

Saint-Léonard—Saint-Michel is the electoral district representing Saint-Léonard in the House of Commons in Ottawa. The current MP is Patricia Lattanzio from the LPC first elected in 2019.

===Borough council===
Saint-Léonard is divided by Lacordaire Boulevard into two city council districts, Saint-Léonard-Est and Saint-Léonard-Ouest. The borough elects a borough mayor, who also sits on Montreal City Council; each district elects one city councillor and one borough councillor. The borough mayor, city councillors, and borough councillors make up the borough council. As of the 2021 Montreal Municipal Election the borough Mayor, borough council and both city councillors are all from Ensemble Montréal.

<doc id="731911" wikidata="Q3520983" url="?curid=731911" title="The Frogs (band)">
<text>The Frogs are an alternative rock band founded in 1980, in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, by brothers Jimmy and Dennis Flemion. The brothers mainly wrote and performed short, catchy pop songs, but they are also known for their improvised home recordings that are delivered in a comedic style, and often include controversial issues such as race, religion, and sexuality (notably homoeroticism). A history of strife has hindered the band, although a devoted fan base that includes many well-known musicians has supported the group.

==History==

===Early years: 1980–1989===
Brothers Jimmy Flemion and Dennis Flemion began playing as the &quot;Gila Monsters&quot; and &quot;Stupid Frogs&quot; in 1980, frequenting Milwaukee clubs and coffeehouses. In 1983, bassist Jay Tiller joined the group. That same year, Jimmy began wearing what was to become his trademark stage gimmick, a pair of six-foot bat wings, inspired by the band&#x27;s set list, which at that time featured many glam rock songs about death and gloom. Soon the brothers also began wearing wigs at their performances, and using pyrotechnics. Hence, &quot;wings and wigs&quot; became synonymous with the band.

Although in their early days the Frogs played mostly in coffeehouses, they developed a larger following due mostly to their fan-friendly shows.

In 1988, Brian Hill joined The Frogs as bassist and would continue to make appearances with the group. That same year saw two significant events related to the Frogs&#x27; recording career. The first event was the release of the Frogs&#x27; debut self-titled album, which they began recording in 1986. Sources disagree on whether the album was self-released or released by Drag City Records; it is undisputed, however, that only about 1,000 copies were pressed.

The second event ended up bringing the group to public attention: Jay Tiller gave a tape of the Frogs&#x27; improvised home recordings to his friend Steve Albini, and the tape eventually made its way to Gerard Cosloy, then head of Homestead Records. Cosloy approached the band and offered to release an album. The Frogs were hoping that Homestead would re-release their first album, but Cosloy wanted to release an LP of the group&#x27;s improvised home recordings, originally recorded on 4-track reel-to-reel with two microphones, which dealt with over-the-top homoeroticism. Since the tapes had not been intended to be released, the group hedged at first, but eventually they relented, and mixed a 14 track collection of songs. The result was &quot;It&#x27;s Only Right and Natural&quot;, The Frogs&#x27; second LP, released in 1989. Songs like &quot;Been a Month Since I Had a Man&quot; and &quot;Gather &#x27;Round for Savior No. 2&quot; gave the album (and the band) a unique theme. Homestead announced that the Frogs were leaders in a &quot;new gay supremacy movement,&quot; and the media ran with it.

The album was received with mixed reactions; some listeners were ecstatic, while others, who either disliked the subject matter or misunderstood the concept, were not as enthusiastic. In the gay press, writer Adam Block wrote, &quot;I&#x27;d find the record a lot more remarkable if I believed the Frogs were actually gay.&quot; &quot;It&#x27;s Only Right and Natural&quot; was even denounced by Pat Robertson on &quot;The 700 Club&quot; and a number of conservative religious organizations as proof of Satan&#x27;s control over the entertainment industry.

===Grunge and success: 1990–2000===
In 1991, the Frogs produced a new album titled &quot;Racially Yours,&quot; which included songs sung from the point of view of both blacks and whites who find themselves in various race-related situations and predicaments. The lyrics were equally serious and satirical. The Frogs&#x27; label Homestead was unwilling to release the album (although the album was distributed freely by fans through bootlegs). It was eventually released in 2000 by the Four Alarm label. The Frogs&#x27; further plans for a live album went unfulfilled, as labels they pursued all seemed to be suffering through bankruptcy and management problems. Jay Tiller left the band in 1992, to be replaced by Damian Strigens, although there were several substitutes in the meantime, including such notables as Eddie Roeser from Urge Overkill and Kelley Deal from the Breeders.

In 1994, the Frogs followed Gerard Cosloy to a new label, Matador Records, releasing two singles. They also recorded the EP &quot;Starjob,&quot; produced by Billy Corgan (who used the pseudonym &quot;Johnny Goat&quot;); however, the EP wouldn&#x27;t be released until 1997.

In 1996, Matador released an album of old home-recorded and improvised Frogs material called &quot;My Daughter the Broad.&quot; It became a fan favorite of the band&#x27;s material.

In 1997, &quot;Starjob&quot; was finally released, by Scratchie Records, but the EP almost immediately went out of print when it failed to sell enough units to satisfy the label. &quot;Starjob&quot; contains well-produced studio tracks, including &quot;Lord Grunge&quot; and one of the most well known Frogs songs, &quot;I Only Play 4 Money.&quot;

In 1999, the Frogs covered &quot;Vacation&quot; by the Go-Go&#x27;s for a tribute album. In that same year, the Four Alarm label issued another LP of the Frogs&#x27; old home-recorded and improvised material, called &quot;Bananimals&quot;. To support these two releases, the Frogs played in Canada for the first time. However, they were stopped at Canadian Customs as officials seized all of their merchandise, declaring it &quot;pornographic.&quot; The Frogs had to play their Canadian shows without any merchandise to sell.

The Frogs, through their unique sense of humor, have gained a small but very devoted fan base. Although critics have attacked the Frogs for poor taste, well-known bands and performers have come to their defense. 

====Kurt Cobain and Nirvana====
After meeting Nirvana singer Kurt Cobain in 1993, the Frogs wrote two songs about him and also made him a videotape, &quot;Toy Porno.&quot; The VHS featured select live performances and stop-motion animation with painted action figures. Action figures and dolls were used as sexually promiscuous characters in various short sketches. The tape became constant viewing material on Nirvana&#x27;s tour bus. The videotape has since been made available to fans and has become a cult classic.

====Billy Corgan and The Smashing Pumpkins====
In 1993, the Smashing Pumpkins&#x27; frontman Billy Corgan saw the Frogs at a small club in Madison, Wisconsin, and invited them to open for The Pumpkins. The Frogs were soon opening for Pearl Jam, Mudhoney, Urge Overkill, and other bands who were fans of the group, to mixed reaction.

In the summer of 1994, the Frogs played the second stage at Lollapalooza, with Billy Corgan joining them for their encore of &quot;I Only Play 4 Money&quot; and &quot;Lord Grunge.&quot; Corgan continued to support and promote the Frogs by producing a short film, &quot;Meet the Frogs,&quot; which he included on the Smashing Pumpkins&#x27; 1994 &quot;Vieuphoria&quot; video compilation.

From August 1996 to February 1997, Dennis Flemion replaced Smashing Pumpkins&#x27; recently deceased keyboard player Jonathan Melvoin for the Pumpkins&#x27; Infinite Sadness Tour. During each night&#x27;s encore, Jimmy Flemion performed &quot;1979&quot; (which was influenced by an unreleased Frogs song, &quot;Pleasure&quot;) with the Smashing Pumpkins, as well as selecting audience members to dance on stage. The Flemion brothers also appeared on the Smashing Pumpkins&#x27; &quot;Tonight, Tonight&quot; single, and sang backing vocals on 1998&#x27;s &quot;Adore.&quot;

====Beck====
In 1995, Beck used a sample of the Frogs&#x27; song &quot;I Don&#x27;t Care If U Disrespect Me (Just So You Love Me)&quot; on his song &quot;Where It&#x27;s At&quot;, included on his 1996 release &quot;Odelay&quot;

====Eddie Vedder and Pearl Jam====

In 1995, Pearl Jam included the Frogs&#x27; cover of &quot;Rearviewmirror&quot; (credited to all members of Pearl Jam, but largely written by lead singer Eddie Vedder) as the b-side to their &quot;Immortality&quot; single. The following year, Pearl Jam released a song called &quot;Smile&quot; on their &quot;No Code&quot; album. According to a story that Vedder told while performing in Milwaukee in 2006, the lyrics of &quot;Smile&quot; were taken directly from a note that Dennis Flemion hid inside Vedder&#x27;s notebook when Vedder was on stage performing. The words used in the note are taken from the Frogs songs &quot;This Is How I Feel&quot; and &quot;Now I Wanna Be Dead.&quot; Vedder told a similar story on Oct. 8, 2000, before performing &quot;Smile&quot; at Alpine Valley Music Theater in East Troy, Wis., although he didn&#x27;t identify Dennis by name. In the segue between &quot;Daughter&quot; and &quot;Smile,&quot; which you can hear on the bootleg from this show, Vedder says, &quot;Someone wrote me a note in my notebook once. He&#x27;s a good friend of mine. Jeff or Stone wrote this song and they needed words and these words were in this notebook. So every time a copy of &#x27;No Code&#x27; is sold, my friend gets like 2/3 of a penny. Which adds up to, well &#x27;No Code,&#x27; like $20.&quot; Dennis also gave Vedder a small pair of bat wings from the Frogs&#x27; early days, and Vedder has proudly displayed them behind his guitar amplifier. The wings reportedly can be seen on the front cover of Pearl Jam&#x27;s &quot;Touring Band 2000.&quot;

Eddie Vedder has sung &quot;I Only Play For Money,&quot; &quot;Starboy,&quot; and &quot;The Longing Goes Away&quot; with the Frogs on more than one occasion, and Pearl Jam played &quot;I Only Play For Money&quot; twice in 1995, although one of the performances was during the soundcheck.

====Sebastian Bach====
In 1997, Jimmy Flemion joined Sebastian Bach&#x27;s touring band. Rather than stripping Jimmy of his trademark bat wings, the whole band adopted costumes as well. Jimmy also recorded a side project called The Last Hard Men with Bach, Kelley Deal and Jimmy Chamberlin. Bach also performed &quot;Lord Grunge&quot; with the Frogs on an infamous MTV appearance on &quot;Oddville.&quot; The Frogs destroyed their set and broke several rules set forth by the show&#x27;s producers, so the producers retaliated by only broadcasting the first verse of the song.

===2001-2012===

The Frogs&#x27; studio effort &quot;Hopscotch Lollipop Sunday Surprise&quot; was released by Scratchie in 2001. However, Scratchie wasn&#x27;t happy with the finished album, and they put it out of print after only a few months, just like they had with the previous &quot;Starjob&quot; EP. Fans were still enthusiastic about the band&#x27;s Scratchie releases, regardless .

After Damian Strigens exited the band in 1998, past bassists such as Brian Hill and Jay Tiller returned for some appearances, while some new bassists began performing with the band, including Josh Silverman, David Geschke, and John W. Busher. Australian Ben Lee made a special guest appearance on bass in New York City on September 28, 2001.

In 2004, R.T. Rybak, mayor of Minneapolis, crowd-surfed at a Frogs concert at First Avenue, a popular nightclub in the Twin Cities, fulfilling a promise made earlier in the summer when the club temporarily closed due to financial difficulties.

The group played a 25th anniversary concert at the Cactus Club in Milwaukee in 2005. Jimmy Flemion opened the show by singing &quot;Now You Know You&#x27;re Black&quot; from &quot;Racially Yours&quot;. One attendee noted, &quot;[I]t was a successful fiasco once again...Jimmy is really cute when he wears the bear hat as part of his costume.&quot;

On November 13, 2007, Jimmy performed with the Smashing Pumpkins at The Backyard in Austin, TX. The Frogs would later open for the Pumpkins on December 7, 2008, in Chicago.

In 2009, the Frogs were part of the lineup for UK 2009 Weekend Two, curated by The Breeders, of the All Tomorrow&#x27;s Parties music festival. The band was chosen by Animal Collective to perform the album &quot;It&#x27;s Only Right &amp; Natural&quot; in its entirety at the All Tomorrow&#x27;s Parties festival in May 2011.

In December 2011, two new studio albums were announced via Jimmy&#x27;s Twitter account, entitled &quot;Count Yer Blessingz&quot; and &quot;Squirrel Bunny Juniper Deluxe&quot;. The albums were released on iTunes and Spotify on July 5, 2012.

On July 7, 2012, Dennis went missing at Wind Lake in Racine, Wisconsin. His body was recovered from the water on the evening of July 10. His death was ruled an accidental drowning.

===2013-present===
In the wake of Dennis Flemion&#x27;s death, Eddie Vedder wrote &quot;Future Days&quot;, which was released in 2013 on the Pearl Jam album, &quot;Lightning Bolt&quot;. Jimmy announced on the band&#x27;s Facebook page that the band would continue despite Dennis&#x27; passing. On July 7, 2017, Jimmy played a tribute show to Dennis at the Barracuda in Austin, Texas. A final album was announced plus talks of a potential documentary.

For its 30th anniversary in 2019, &quot;It’s Only Right and Natural&quot; was reissued on End Of All Music. The vinyl reissue features remixed and remastered audio of the original album (the original album was accidentally pressed in mono when released in 1989) and comes housed in a gatefold sleeve with newly added artwork (plus track-by-track liner notes and intro by Jimmy).

In November 2019, the Frogs announced a short tour consisting of Jimmy Flemion on guitar and Evan Dando (of the Lemonheads) on drums.

As a follow-up to 2019&#x27;s reissue of &quot;It&#x27;s Only Right and Natural&quot;, the Frogs released &quot;1st&quot; on April 3, 2020. Recorded during January 1986, the album, also known as &quot;Pat&#x27;s Session&quot;, was intended to be the initial release for the band prior to &quot;The Frogs&quot; 1988 self-titled debut. Minneapolis based Twin/Tone Records approached The Frogs and expressed fawning interest, extending an invitation to record the band after seeing them live in 1985. Dennis opted not to release due to the overabundance of reverb. Throughout the years, the discussion would persist from other sources on pursuing to fix the reverb on &quot;1st&quot;. Thirty-two years later, Jimmy would take the recordings to a Portland, Oregon recording studio to remaster in 2018. The studio engineer successfully cleaned-up and removed the excess reverb.

On February 14, 2020, Jimmy confirmed on the Frogs&#x27; Facebook page that a documentary on the band is in the works.

In 2021, a &quot;final&quot; album, &quot;Damaged Goods / Sinned in Reverse&quot; was released digitally. 2022 saw an expanded version of their debut album and an alternate version of &quot;Hopscotch Lollipop Sunday Surprise&quot;. The following year, a reissue of an early demo release, &quot;Death Songs&quot;, was released onto streaming services for its 40th anniversary. It was followed by &quot;1980&quot;, a collection of demos recorded in 1980. Expanded and alternate versions of the &quot;Starjob&quot; EP, entitled &quot;Starjob +&quot; and &quot;Starjob ?&quot;, rounded out the year&#x27;s releases. In 2024, Jimmy announced he would be releasing a series of live versions of the band&#x27;s material, beginning with &quot;Rare&quot;, focusing on live shows between 1980 and 1984, through &quot;Well Done&quot;, which focused between 2000 and 2006. Later that year, a deluxe version of &quot;Racially Yours&quot;, entitled &quot;Racially Mine&quot;, was released.

<text>Brossard ( , , ) is a municipality in the Montérégie region of Quebec, Canada and is part of the Greater Montreal area. According to the 2021 census, Brossard&#x27;s population was 91,525. It shares powers with the urban agglomeration of Longueuil and was a borough of the municipality of Longueuil from 2002 to 2006.

According to the website of the city of Brossard, the municipality was named in honour of the Brossard family (the surname derives from a word meaning &quot;brushwood&quot;), a prominent settler family of the area whose presence was first attested in 1766. A member of this family, Georges-Henri Brossard, had been mayor of the predecessor parish municipality of La Prairie-de-la-Madeleine since 1944 and became the first mayor of Brossard.

Other names that were considered included Maisonneuve (which was also considered as a possible name for the Champlain Bridge), La Vérendrye, Marquetteville, or Forgetville. The latter name, in honour of the recently deceased Mgr. Anastase Forget, bishop of Saint-Jean; however, Premier Maurice Duplessis intervened, to avoid the connotations of the English word &quot;forget,&quot; and the name Brossard was ultimately chosen.

==History==

The city of Brossard was founded on February 14, 1958, and was before part of La Prairie-de-la-Madeleine Parish. Its first mayor was Georges-Henri Brossard. At the very beginning, there were 3,400 inhabitants.

The city has some homes dating from the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, particularly along Prairies Road.

On August 8, 1964, a portion of land from Greenfield Park was added to Brossard. Furthermore, Notre-Dame-du-Sacré-Cœur was annexed to Brossard on March 25, 1978, becoming the &quot;A&quot; section to form the current city.

In the 1970s, an attempt was made by René Désourdy to construct a cemetery in Brossard. The attempt failed due to the water table being too high in most of the city, and as of 2024 Brossard has no cemetery.

Brossard was forcibly merged into the city of Longueuil on January 1, 2002, as a result of municipal reorganization in Quebec.
 and a demerger movement was started by Pierre Senécal, Jacques St-Amant and Gilles Larin which resulted in a municipal referendum, the largest demerger vote in Québec, that took place on June 20, 2004. 38.70% of the 50,539 qualified voters voted YES for demerger, which met the requirements (35% or more of total voting population) needed for de-amalgamation. As a result, Brossard would continue to be a borough of the city of Longueuil only until the end of 2005.

On January 1, 2006, Brossard was reconstituted as a city and Jean-Marc Pelletier was elected as the new mayor. However, Brossard still remains part of the urban agglomeration of Longueuil and thus, Brossard sits on the agglomeration council which determines certain powers of reconstituted cities.

On November 11, 2017, Doreen Assad was elected mayor of Brossard, the first woman of Egyptian descent to hold such position in Canada.

==Geography==

Brossard is surrounded by four municipalities on the South Shore of Montreal: Saint-Lambert, Longueuil (Borough of Greenfield Park and Borough of Saint-Hubert), Carignan and La Prairie. Brossard is situated on the Saint Lawrence River to the west and by the Saint-Jacques River to the south. &quot;(see Geographic location section below)&quot;

Many parks are scattered throughout the city of Brossard, including Parc écologique des Sansonnets. The parks are connected to the other areas of the city by about 37 km (23 miles) of biking paths. The city also has a municipal library building connected to its city hall building via an indoor passageway.

Brossard is subdivided into many smaller sections. These sections are characterized by having street names that all begin with the same letter of the alphabet. The only notable exceptions are few major arteries (such as Taschereau Boulevard and Rome Boulevard) that span across two or more sections. The lettered sectors were created under a 1960s planning and zoning scheme, pursuant to a guiding plan established by the engineering firm of Beauchemin, Beaton et Lapointe, and had the goal of easier wayfinding in the absence of a right-angled street grid. Some of the sectors correspond to former neighbourhoods or municipalities, as follows:

Some constructions in the &quot;A&quot; and &quot;R&quot; sections of Brossard are older than the city itself because they were built in the former communities of Notre-Dame-du-Sacré Coeur and Brosseau Station, respectively. The &quot;M&quot; and &quot;V&quot; sections are the first neighbourhoods built after the inauguration of Brossard in 1958.

Two sparsely inhabited parts of Brossard, containing no streets other than main arteries and industrial roads, are arbitrarily called the &quot;X&quot; and &quot;Y&quot; sections.

<text>Verdun ( , , ) is a borough (&quot;arrondissement&quot;) of the city of Montreal, Quebec, located in the southeastern part of the island.

Long known as a working class neighbourhood, it has experienced significant gentrification and social change in the 21st century.

==Etymology==
The borough&#x27;s name is a shortening of Saverdun, in France, the hometown of its early settler Zacharie Dupuy.

==History==
=== Early history ===

There is archaeological evidence of indigenous peoples in the area as early as 5,500 years ago. A portage along what is now the boulevard LaSalle was used to pass the Lachine Rapids.

A trading post was established at nearby Fort Ville-Marie in 1611 and colonization of the Island of Montreal began in 1642. In 1664 the Île-Saint-Paul (now Nun&#x27;s Island) became a seigneury.

The first colonial settlers were militiamen granted concessions in 1665 in exchange for defence against the Iroquois. Afterwards, the area was known as &quot;Côte-des-Argoulets&quot; (Sharpshooter&#x27;s Ridge), in reference to the arquebus, an infantry gun. The settlement was where the grande Saint-Pierre river drained Lac à la Loutre into the St. Lawrence River. The lake has since been filled to create the Turcot rail yard, and the St. Pierre partly covered over and partly integrated with canals.

In 1671, the Fief of Verdun is created when land is granted to Zacharie Dupuy, who derived the name Verdun from his native village of Saverdun in France. Two years later he donated the land to the Congrégation de Notre-Dame, who in 1710 built the building now preserved as the Maison Nivard-De Saint-Dizier. This house is named for Étienne Nivard Saint-Dizier, whose father bought the lands from the nuns in 1769.

Following the Great Peace of Montreal in 1701, farmers settled along Lower Lachine Road (now boulevard LaSalle), which connected Fort Ville-Marie with Lachine.

Around 1800, Chemin de la Rivière-Saint-Pierre (now rue de l&#x27;Église) was opened. The Canal de l&#x27;Aqueduc, now Verdun&#x27;s northwestern boundary, was dug in 1854 to furnish Montreal with drinking water from the St. Lawrence.

In 1874, a group of local land-owners met in a farmhouse called Le Pavillon, located at the corner of Lower Lachine Road and Chemin de la Rivière-Saint-Pierre, and decided to found the village of Rivière-Saint-Pierre. Chartered by the government of Quebec, it became the municipality of Verdun the following year. Settlement had been hampered due to frequent flooding, but a dyke was built starting in 1896; its completion resulted in a population boom. The dyke itself became host to Verdun&#x27;s popular Boardwalk, before land reclamation in the 70s led to the expansion of the waterfront park along the whole length of Verdun&#x27;s riverbank.

The first Église Notre-Dame-des-Sept-Douleurs (now part of the school of the same name) was built in 1899, followed by a combined town hall, fire hall, and police station in 1908. The tramway also arrived in 1899, connecting Verdun to downtown. A larger Église Notre-Dame-des-Sept-Douleurs de Montréal was built in 1914.

=== 20th century ===
In 1881, the Montreal Hospital for the Insane was founded as a Protestant counterpart to the Catholic Hôpital Saint-Jean-de-Dieu (now Hôpital Louis-H.-Lafontaine) east of the city. It would be built on two farms, purchased in 1887 and 1907, in the western end of Verdun. Affiliated with McGill University in 1946, it was renamed the Douglas Hospital in 1965. Today, not only is it one of Verdun&#x27;s largest public institutions, but its campus is one of the borough&#x27;s most important greenspaces.

Verdun became a town in 1907 and a city in 1912. Between 1911 and 1924 the population tripled and urbanization expanded rapidly &quot;westward&quot; (according to &quot;Montreal directions&quot; - actually due southward), and the farms were divided for residential use. The Moffat area west of rue Desmarchais was built in with &quot;plexes&quot;—the typical Montreal layered apartment—between 1920 and 1930, and the Crawford Park area in the far west of the town was built starting in 1945, in a more suburban style unlike the orthogonal grid used in the rest of Verdun. The Verdun Natatorium was built in 1930, the Verdun Hospital in 1932, and the Verdun Auditorium in 1938.

The municipality of Île-Saint-Paul, occupying what was by then universally known as Nuns&#x27; Island or Île des Sœurs, was annexed to Verdun in 1956. Then a chiefly agricultural area, it was rapidly urbanized following the opening of the Champlain Bridge in 1962, with development including contributions by the famous Modernist architect Ludwig Mies van der Rohe. Rapid development would continue to the present day, with the erosion of the sensitive natural woodland of the Domaine Saint-Pierre becoming an increasingly pressing concern.
Back in Verdun proper, in the post-war period, the area around the church, along rue Wellington and rue de l&#x27;Église, became the nucleus of commercial development. A new city hall was built on Rue de Verdun in 1958. The Green Line of the Montreal Metro was extended into Verdun in 1978, its construction delayed due to a collapse in rue Wellington during the construction of De L&#x27;Église station. Besides De l&#x27;Église in downtown Verdun and Verdun station in front of the town hall, LaSalle station was built in vacant land in a former industrial area in the east of the borough, left vacant by the demolition of the vast British Munitions Supply Co. facilities; the Metro station would become the heart of a new residential area called La Poudrière after the munitions factories.

However, improved access to downtown Montreal meant a decline in local commerce. A program of subsidies and revitalization starting in the 1990s reinvigorated the rue Wellington commercial corridor.

Verduners voted 68% &quot;no&quot; in the 1980 sovereignty referendum and 59.6% &quot;no&quot; in the 1995 referendum. In 1992, Verduners voted 53.66% in favour of the Charlottetown Accord.

=== 21st century ===

In 2002, the municipal reorganization of Montreal saw the city of Verdun become a borough of Montreal. The majority of Verduners chose not to hold a demerger referendum in 2004-2006.

Earlier in the 20th century, Verdun was a partially dry community, with taverns, night clubs and cabarets banned since 1965, and alcohol sales restricted to restaurants with liquor licences, grocery stores and the SAQ. In December 2010, the borough announced that it was planning to allow some microbreweries or performance spaces to sell alcohol. The ban was eventually lifted entirely in 2013, and today Verdun is home to many thriving microbreweries and bars.

In recent years, Verdun, along with the neighbouring Le Sud-Ouest borough, have experienced rapid gentrification and social change. Long considered to be one of the city&#x27;s poorer neighbourhoods, it&#x27;s today one Montreal&#x27;s most desirable areas to live, with a large influx of students and professionals arriving in the last decade.

In 2019, Verdun hosted a part of the Jazz Fest on Wellington Street, to much praise from the public and critics.

In 2020, it was listed as the eleventh &quot;coolest&quot; neighbourhood in the world by Time Out magazine.

==Geography==
The borough of Verdun is partly located on the Island of Montreal, as well as including all of Nuns&#x27; Island.

The Montreal Island part of the borough is defined on its eastern side by the St. Lawrence River, and on the west by the Canal de l&#x27;Aqueduc. Several bridges cross the canal to connect Verdun with Ville-Émard and Côte-Saint-Paul. To the south it extends to Avenue Gérald and LaSalle. To the north it extends to Pointe-Saint-Charles and the Quebec Autoroute 15 which connects it to Nun&#x27;s Island.

Neighbourhoods within Verdun include;
*Desmarchais-Crawford (also called West Verdun), which includes dense early 20th-century residential development, the sprawling Douglas Hospital campus, and the post-war suburban area of Crawford Park
*Wellington-De l&#x27;Église, the borough&#x27;s commercial and institutional downtown surrounded with historically working-class blocks of two- and three-story &quot;plexes&quot; (duplexes, 3-, 4-, 5- and 6-plexes) with their characteristic winding staircases and balconies
*L&#x27;Île-des-Sœurs (Nuns&#x27; Island), located offshore, home to upscale condo developments and BCE&#x27;s headquarters

==Demographics==
Demographics of Verdun:


In the early part of the 20th century, Verdun had a majority English-speaking population and until 1954 — when the 80,000 residents made Verdun the third largest city in Quebec— the anglophone and francophone populations were roughly equal. It is now about two-thirds French-speaking.

==Economy==
Verdun was historically a chiefly residential area; however, the late 1990s and 2000s saw a gradual revival of the Wellington Street commercial artery, with several shops, restaurants, and cafés opening.

By 2020, Wellington was considered one of the city&#x27;s trendiest streets, comparable to Mount Royal Avenue in the Plateau, and hosted part of the Jazz Fest in 2019.

Bell Canada is also headquartered in Verdun, on the northern tip of Nuns&#x27; Island.

Other commercial areas include Verdun Street, Church Street (rue de l&#x27;Eglise) and Commerce Place (Place du Commerce) on Nuns&#x27; Island.

The Montreal Highland Games, located in Verdun, bring visitors to the neighbourhood each August.
==Transport==
Verdun is served by Quebec Autoroutes 15 and 20, which skirt the northern and eastern edges of its mainland portion and merge with Autoroute 10 on Nuns&#x27; Island. The island is connected to the Island of Montreal and the South Shore via the Champlain Bridge.

The borough is contemplating the possibility of building a service bridge between the Island of Montreal and Nuns&#x27; Island. The bridge would connect Boul. Marguerite-Bourgeoys on Nuns&#x27; Island with Rue Galt in mainland Verdun. It would be accessible only to city services, public transit, cyclists, and pedestrians.

The borough is served by the Green Line of the Montreal Metro: Verdun, De l&#x27;Église, and LaSalle stations, along with Jolicoeur station immediately across the aqueduct in Ville-Émard. All of these stations have been in service since 1978. Other than the metro, there is also the bus. The following bus routes pass through Verdun: 12 Ile Des Soeurs, 21 Place Du Commerce (runs AM rush only), 37 Jolicoeur, 38 De l&#x27;Église, 58 Wellington, 61 Wellington, 71 Du Centre, 107 Verdun, 108 Bannantyne and 112 Airlie.

The Réseau express métropolitain light metro serves Verdun at Île-des-Soeurs station, with the station opening on July 31, 2023. This provides automated train service connecting Verdun to Montreal Central Station, Brossard, Downtown Montreal and other areas of Greater Montreal, including, by 2027, Montreal-Trudeau International Airport at the YUL–Montréal–Trudeau Airport station.

==Health==
Significa medical facilities in the borough include the Douglas Mental Health University Institute (commonly known as &quot;the Douglas&quot;), a McGill University psychiatric hospital.

The francophone Hôpital de Verdun, affiliated with the Université de Montréal Faculty of Medicine, is also in the borough.

==Recreation==
Recreational facilities include the Verdun Auditorium, a hockey arena and concert hall, the home of the now defunct Junior de Montréal team.

Expansive parks (L&#x27;Honorable-George-O&#x27;Reilly, Mgr-J-A-Richard, and Arthur-Therrien) with bike paths line the banks of the St. Lawrence River, making Verdun one of the few parts of the Island of Montreal to open onto the whole length of its waterfront, a legacy of the flooding that once impeded settlement. The waterfront also features the Verdun Natatorium, public-access docks and a marina, an open-air dancing shell, a lawn bowling green, and football, baseball, and soccer fields. In 2019, a public beach was opened behind the Auditorium.

Cycling is also available along the Canal de l&#x27;Aqueduc on the opposite edge of the borough; on rue de Verdun; and around and through Nuns&#x27; Island, including the cycle-accessible Champlain Bridge ice structure connecting to Île Notre-Dame and the south shore.

Another of the borough&#x27;s major green spaces, the Domaine Saint-Paul (Boisé de l&#x27;Île-des-Sœurs), preserves the natural woodland of Nuns&#x27; Island, home to more than a hundred species of birds as well as the scarce brown snake. Trails lead through the woodland. The campus of the Douglas Hospital is also a major green space open to the public.

The borough&#x27;s community centres are the Centre communautaire Marcel-Giroux, near the borough hall; the Centre communautaire Elgar on Nuns&#x27; Island; and the Centre culturel de Verdun, in the western part of the borough. The latter two facilities include public libraries and art exhibition spaces.

==Government==

===Municipal===

Verdun is governed by a borough council consisting of the borough mayor and of one city councillor and two borough councillors elected by each of two council districts, for a total of seven members. The borough mayor and the two city councillors represent Verdun on Montreal City Council.

As of the November 7, 2021 Montreal municipal election, the current borough council consists of the following councillors:

===Federal and provincial===

The borough is part of the federal ridings of LaSalle—Émard—Verdun and Ville-Marie—Le Sud-Ouest—Île-des-Sœurs and is coextensive with the provincial riding of Verdun.

<text>Flying Padre is a 1951 short subject black-and-white documentary film. It is the second film directed by Stanley Kubrick. The film is nine minutes long and was completed shortly after Kubrick had completed his first film for RKO, the short subject &quot;Day of the Fight&quot; (1951). The studio offered him a follow-up project for their Screenliner series.

==Synopsis==
The subject of &quot;Flying Padre&quot; is a Catholic priest in rural New Mexico, Reverend Fred Stadtmueller. Known to his parishioners as the &quot;Flying Padre&quot;, his 4,000-square mile parish is so large, he uses a Piper Cub aircraft (named the &quot;Spirit of St. Joseph&quot;) to travel from one isolated settlement to another.

The film shows two days in his daily life, with the Reverend providing spiritual guidance, saying a Funeral Mass, and other glimpses of his life such as his breakfast routine at the parish house. His days include a funeral service for a ranch hand, and counseling of two young parishioners who have been quarrelling. In the climax of the film. the &quot;Flying Padre&quot; also operated as an impromptu air ambulance by flying a sick child and his mother to hospital.

==Cast==
* Bob Hite as himself - Narrator (voice)
* Reverend Fred Stadtmueller as himself
* Pedro as himself

==Production==
After Kubrick sold his first short film, the self-financed &quot;Day of the Fight&quot;, to RKO in 1951 for $4,000 (pocketing a $100 profit), the company advanced the 23-year-old filmmaker money to make a follow-up project, a documentary short for their &quot;Pathe Screenliner&quot; series which specialized in short human-interest documentaries. He originally wanted to call the film &quot;Sky Pilot&quot; but the studio did not like the title.

&quot;Flying Padre&quot; is narrated by CBS announcer Bob Hite. 

==Reception==
In an interview in 1969, Kubrick referred to &quot;Flying Padre&quot; as a &quot;silly thing&quot;. &quot;Flying Padre&quot;, however, was an important landmark in his budding career as a filmmaker. &quot;It was at this point that I formally quit my job at &quot;Look&quot; to work full time on filmmaking,&quot; Kubrick stated in an interview.&quot;

<doc id="731922" wikidata="Q2360927" url="?curid=731922" title="Pierrefonds, Quebec">
<text>Pierrefonds () is a former city in southwestern Quebec, Canada. It is located along the Rivière des Prairies on the northwestern part of the Island of Montreal (part of what is colloquially called the West Island). It was merged into Montreal on January 1, 2002, and is today part of the borough of Pierrefonds-Roxboro.

== History ==
Its origin dates back to the eighteenth century, and is intimately linked to that of Sainte-Geneviève, which was composed at the time of Pierrefonds, L&#x27;Île-Bizard, Sainte-Geneviève, Roxboro and Dollard-des-Ormeaux.

In 1904, following several previous divisions, the Town of Sainte-Geneviève was split into two new villages: Sainte-Geneviève and Sainte-Geneviève de Pierrefonds. This was the first appearance of the name Pierrefonds. At the heart of the conflict leading to the separation was the notary and local member of the Legislative Assembly Joseph-Adolphe Chauret, who, in 1902, had a &quot;seigniorial&quot; residence built for himself reminiscent of the community of Pierrefonds in France’s Department of Oise. He named his thatched home &quot;Château Pierrefonds&quot;, apparently providing the name for the future city.

In 1935 the two villages of Sainte-Geneviève and Sainte-Geneviève de Pierrefonds merged once again into a single village called Sainte-Geneviève. The name Pierrefonds disappeared, resurfacing on December 18, 1958, when the rest of the territory of the old parish became the City of Pierrefonds.

== Dissolution ==

On 2002-01-01, as part of a province-wide municipal reorganization, Pierrefonds was joined with Senneville and they became a borough of the city of Montreal named Pierrefonds-Senneville. In the demerger referendums of 2004, Senneville demerged from Montreal but Pierrefonds did not. On 2006-01-01, Pierrefonds merged with the former city of Roxboro to form the Montreal borough of Pierrefonds-Roxboro.

== Origin of the name Pierrefonds ==
One of the leading figures who brought about the 1904 split was a famous (or infamous), fiery notary named Joseph-Adolphe Chauret. Always in the limelight, this colourful fellow was praised by some and criticized by others. His reputation remains controversial to this day, mostly because of his stormy and ostentatious lifestyle.

Inspired by an engraving of the feudal Castle of Pierrefonds in Oise, France, in 1902 Chauret built a turreted, gabled residence with the inscription Château de Pierrefonds on two of its socles. The building only somewhat resembled the much heralded fortress Chauret finally visited in 1911 when he journeyed in Europe. At a time when few people travelled abroad, his trip aroused considerable curiosity among local residents – so much so that crowds greeted him upon his return to Canada.

The name Pierrefonds therefore can be traced to Chauret’s residence.

In 1987, Chauret&#x27;s property was converted into a residence for the elderly named &quot;Château Pierrefonds&quot;.
