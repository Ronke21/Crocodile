<text>Jeremy Belknap (June 4, 1744 – June 20, 1798) was an American clergyman and historian. His great achievement was the &quot;History of New Hampshire&quot;, published in three volumes between 1784 and 1792. This work is the first modern history written by an American, embodying a new rigor in research, annotation, and reporting.

==Early life==
Belknap was born in Boston, Province of Massachusetts Bay, the son of a tanner. His uncle was Mather Byles, one of New England&#x27;s intellectual leaders. Belknap was baptized by the historian Thomas Prince, another leading figure of 18th-century New England. He was educated at the Boston Latin School and Harvard College, where he graduated in 1762. In 1764 he moved to Portsmouth, New Hampshire, where he &quot;kept the school&quot; and studied theology with Samuel Haven (Harvard College class of 1749). In 1767 he began his ministry in Dover, New Hampshire, where he would spend twenty years at the Congregational Church. He also married that year and acquired a house in Dover.

After the Battle of Lexington in 1775 some units of the Dover militia were called out to support the Siege of Boston. Belknap accompanied them and remained through the next winter as chaplain to the New Hampshire troops involved with the siege.

==History of New Hampshire ==
Besides attending to his growing congregation, Belknap served as a secretary to the convention of New Hampshire ministers from 1769 until 1787. This position required travel throughout the state, and he used it as a chance to begin accumulating notes on the history of New Hampshire. In 1772 he began to write his history. In 1784 he published the first volume of the &quot;History of New Hampshire&quot;, but it would take until 1792 to complete the work. The work was not successful at first, and sales were disappointing, and did better around Boston than in New Hampshire. Its reputation grew over the years, however, and after his death, Alexis de Tocqueville named him as America&#x27;s best native historian.

The &quot;History&quot; represented a new approach in its field. Besides just narrating events, he added two innovations. He tried to clearly separate facts from analysis and opinion, and he provided many annotations to show the source and location of records that he had inspected.

==Recognition ==
Besides his &quot;History&quot;, Belknap began work on an American biographical dictionary in 1779. This effort caused him to begin corresponding with many of the leading men of letters, politics, and religion throughout the colonies. He would eventually publish his &quot;American Biographies&quot; in two volumes in 1794 and 1798. In the meantime, his efforts brought him to the attention of intellectual leaders across the country.

Belknap was elected to the American Philosophical Society in 1784. In 1785 he was elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. This latter association also resulted in an offer to return to Boston.

==Massachusetts career ==
Belknap accepted a new position in 1787, when he moved back to Boston to become pastor of the Federal Street Church. He would serve there until his death. He remained active in research, writing, and promoting American history as a field.

He continued his quest into history, seeking ways to report and preserve historic sources. On January 24, 1791, he invited nine friends with similar interests to meet at his home. They agreed to help build a repository for these records. The meeting resulted in the Massachusetts Historical Society, which was the first historical society and served as a prototype for many later ones. They also pledged to contribute family papers. John Eliot, a fourth-generation descendant of the 17th-century &quot;Apostle to the Indians&quot; and himself a minister, added Governor Thomas Hutchinson&#x27;s manuscript for the &quot;History of Massachusetts Bay&quot;, which his father Andrew Eliot had saved during the Revolution when a mob looted the governor&#x27;s home.

In 1792 Belknap published his &quot;An Historical Account of those persons who have been distinguished in America&quot;, which was the first of a distinguished line of dictionaries of American biography. That same year, he became one of the overseers of Harvard University.

==Death and legacy==
Belknap died in Boston and was buried at the Granary Burying Ground. His remains were later re-interred in Mount Auburn Cemetery in Cambridge, Massachusetts. Belknap County, New Hampshire, is named in his honor. He is featured on a New Hampshire historical marker (number 51) along the Spaulding Turnpike in Dover.

<text>Publius Ostorius Scapula (died 52) was a Roman statesman and general who governed Britain from 47 until his death, and was responsible for the defeat and capture of Caratacus.

==Early life==
Publius Ostorius Scapula was the son of a Publius and likely the nephew of Quintus Ostorius Scapula, the first joint commander of the Praetorian Guard appointed by Augustus and later prefect of Egypt. The Quintus Ostorius Scapula who was consul in 41 AD was probably his brother or cousin.

==Career==
Nothing is known of his early career. He was suffect consul, probably in 46. In the winter of 47 he was appointed the second governor of Roman Britain by the emperor Claudius, succeeding Aulus Plautius. The south and east of the island was securely occupied and alliances had been made with tribes outside the Roman-controlled area, but other tribes continued to resist. Believing a new governor would be reluctant to campaign so late in the year, they staged attacks and uprisings.

Ostorius disabused them of this notion and responded vigorously, attacking relentlessly and allowing the native resistance no time to regroup. He apparently (based on an emendation of a corrupt passage in Tacitus&#x27;s &quot;Annals&quot;) declared his intention to disarm all the Britons south and east of the rivers Trent and Severn. The geographical area described has led to discussion about the role of the Fosse Way as a desired frontier line during the period, as it links the Trent and the Severn.

The Iceni, a tribe based in Norfolk who had not been conquered but allied themselves with the Romans voluntarily, objected to this plan and led neighbouring tribes in an uprising. Ostorius defeated them by storming a hill fort, possibly Stonea Camp in the Fens near March in Cambridgeshire, in a hard-fought battle. His son, Marcus Ostorius Scapula, won the &quot;corona civica&quot; for saving a Roman citizen&#x27;s life during the fighting. The Iceni remained independent, and it is likely that Prasutagus was installed as a pro-Roman ruler at this time.

After putting down the rebellion he began expeditions beyond the frontier, beginning with a productive campaign against the Deceangli tribe in north Wales and the Cheshire Gap in 48. This was an astute move as it divided the tribes of North Britain from those in Wales. He was recalled east however after a new rebellion by a faction of the Brigantes. This was quickly suppressed but revealed the dangers in the Romans&#x27; client kingdom system of which the Brigantes were a part; troops from the &quot;Legio XIV Gemina&quot; were stationed in the area to keep the Brigantian peace. At this time the &quot;Legio II Augusta&quot; held the command in the south east, the &quot;Legio IX Hispana&quot; was campaigning the north east beyond the Trent, the &quot;Legio XX Valeria Victrix&quot; held Colchester and the &quot;Legio XIV&quot; was based at Wroxeter.

Ostorius initiated further Romanisation during his command in the safer southern lands, founding Britain&#x27;s first colony of military veterans at Camulodunum (modern Colchester) in 49 and probably establishing a &quot;municipium&quot; at Verulamium (St Albans). His tactical skill rather than his political acumen was his strength however. He had received a difficult brief as the Claudian lowlands were economically unspectacular and Britain&#x27;s mineral wealth lay in the barbarian lands instead. Capture of these would have to wait until later years.

In the meantime, Caratacus, whose tribe, the Catuvellauni, had been defeated in the first phase of the conquest, had re-emerged as a leader of the Silures of south east Wales. Their rising was controlled by a programme of legionary fortress construction, driving Caratacus north into the lands of the Ordovices. Ostorius managed to force him into an open conflict, after several years of guerrilla war. They fought a battle, probably near the River Severn and possibly near Caersws, where the Romans defeated the British leader in 51.

The Ordovices had fortified a ridge of steep hills above the river and the difficulty of the terrain behind them made an encircling manoeuvre by the Romans impossible. Although Ostorius was concerned at the seemingly impregnable defences, Tacitus records that the eagerness and loyalty of his troops persuaded him to attack and in the end the Britons were easily defeated. Caratacus&#x27; wife and daughter were captured and his brother surrendered while Caratacus himself fled to the territory of the Brigantes. However their queen, Cartimandua, was loyal to Rome and handed him over in chains.

After the battle, Ostorius was honoured with triumphal insignia but the victory did not entirely quell resistance in the Welsh borders. The Silures especially continued to harass Roman troops, supposedly after Ostorius had publicly said that they posed such a danger that they should be either exterminated or transplanted. A large legionary force occupied in building forts in Silurian territory was surrounded and attacked and only rescued with difficulty and considerable loss. This violent desperation on the part of the Silures can be attributed to their reaction to what Peter Salway calls Ostorius&#x27; lack of political judgment. The Silures had been galvanised by Ostorius&#x27; ill-thought out threats to destroy them and began taking Roman prisoners as hostages and distributing them amongst their neighbouring tribes. This had the effect of binding them all together and creating a new resistance movement.

Ostorius died unexpectedly in 52, supposedly &quot;worn out with care&quot; as Tacitus puts it, leaving Rome with a growing problem on its British frontiers. It has been claimed that his final resting place is in Clawdd Coch in the Vale of Glamorgan, southeast Wales. Silurian raids continued, defeating a legion led by Gaius Manlius Valens, before Aulus Didius Gallus arrived as replacement governor. The complete pacification of the area was achieved only 25 years later by Sextus Julius Frontinus.

==Family==
A Sallustia Calvina is attested as the wife of a Publius Ostorius Scapula, possibly the governor or his father, if the wife of the governor she might have been the daughter of Gaius Sallustius Passienus Crispus and Junia Calvina.

<text>The Articles of Capitulation of Montreal were agreed upon between the Governor General of New France, Pierre François de Rigaud, Marquis de Vaudreuil-Cavagnal, and Major-General Jeffery Amherst on behalf of the French and British crowns. They were signed on 8 September 1760 in the British camp before the city of Montreal, during the French and Indian War after a two-month campaign which led to the fall of the city.

There were 55 articles, including a large array of demands with regards to the protection of the inhabitants of New France: the French, the Canadians, the Acadians, and the First Nations. De Vaudreuil demanded that all be granted the rights and privileges of the other British subjects. These consisted an amnesty of Canadian militiamen who had fought for the French, the free exercise of the Roman Catholic faith, the continuation of the ownership of black and Indian slaves by French Canadians, the continuation of the rights and privileges of the clergy and seigneurs and the guarantee of the rights enjoyed by the native peoples under the French regime. Most were granted by the British Army except those with reference to the Acadians.

Although the articles were drafted without participation from First Nations, Article 40 of the treaty recognized their sovereignty and autonomy, promising to uphold their right to their lands and religion and avoid punishment for having fought for the French.

<text>The Mazda MX-6 is a front-engine, front-wheel-drive coupé manufactured and marketed by Mazda from 1987 to 1997 across two generations.

Mechanically identical to the Ford Probe, the Capella/626 and its hatchback platform mate, the Ford Telstar, these cars shared the GD (1988–1992) and GE (1993–1997) platforms. The MX-6 replaced the 626 Coupé, although it continued to share the same chassis.

The MX-6, 626, and Ford Probe were manufactured at joint-venture plants either by AutoAlliance in Flat Rock, Michigan, for the North American market, and by Mazda Japan for Asian and European markets.

== First generation (1987–1992) ==


The first-generation MX-6 appeared in 1987 and lasted until 1992 in the United States. In some markets, the model years were from 1987 to 1991. It was based on a series of futuristic sports compact concept cars of the early 1980s. It was a large coupé, based on the Mazda GD platform, and was powered by the inline-four Mazda F engines. It used the Mazda G4A-EL four-speed electronic-shift automatic transmission.

The US market made use of the F2 2.2-liter engine, with the base engine producing . The turbocharged option produces . European and Japanese market versions were shipped with either the 1.8 L F8 or the 2.0 L FE or FE-DOHC DOHC engines.

The MX-6 was produced with two transmission options, a five-speed manual transmission or a four-speed automatic with overdrive. The MX-6 was known to be a very reliable car, mechanically.

This generation was available in several trim levels, which differed depending on the market in which the vehicle was sold. In the United States, the MX-6 was available in &quot;DX&quot;, &quot;LX&quot;, &quot;LE&quot;, and &quot;GT&quot; trim levels:
* &quot;DX&quot; was the &quot;bare bones&quot; model, offering the base and F2 2.2 L engine and few options, but most MX-6s sold in the US were equipped with air conditioning.
* &quot;LX&quot; added power windows, power locks, and power mirrors, as well as an optional electric moonroof.
* &quot;LE&quot; was a rare &quot;Luxury or Leather Edition&quot; model that was the same as the LX, but included leather seating surfaces and a leather-wrapped shift knob on manual transmission-equipped vehicles.
* &quot;GT&quot; included all options from the LX, but also stepped up to the F2T 2.2 L turbocharged, intercooled engine, which put out and of torque delivering a significant performance boost. It also had four-wheel disc brakes with ABS as optional, and three-way electronically adjustable suspension, dubbed AAS.

In 1989, Mazda offered a special four-wheel steering (commonly abbreviated 4WS) option on MX-6 GTs destined for the U.S. This system consisted of an electronically controlled rear steering rack that turned the rear wheels opposite to the fronts at low speeds to improve cornering, and turned the rear wheels with the fronts at high speeds to improve highway lane change maneuvering. This option was available through all years for GT models in other markets.

European specification vehicles shipped as the 626 Coupé and commonly received either the 1.8 L SOHC F8 or 2.0 L SOHC FE engine in &quot;GLX&quot; models, or the 2.0 L FE-DOHC engine in their &quot;GT&quot; models. 4WS was a common option for European 626 Coupés. Australian vehicles were almost always equipped with the 2.2 L turbocharged F2T engine as the US models, as well as 4WS. They also carried the MX-6 name of the American models.

Japanese specification vehicles were shipped as the Capella C2 and were available in several trims, most notably &quot;GT-R&quot; (FE-DOHC and 4WS), &quot;GT-X&quot; (FE-DOHC and AAS), or &quot;GT-S&quot; (F8 and 4WS or AAS). In other parts of East Asia, the MX-6 name was also used.

New Zealand received vehicles in either European or Australian specification, selectable on order. As such, New Zealand-market GTs can have either the F2T 2.2 L turbocharged engine or the FE-DOHC 2.0 L DOHC, with optional 4WS.
== Second generation (GE; 1991–1997) ==

Mazda launched the second generation MX-6 using the GE platform, shared by the 626 and Ford rebadged cars, the Ford Probe and the Ford Telstar.

It was released in three distinct variants worldwide, known as A-spec, E-spec, and J-spec, which relates to their destined markets – U.S., Europe, and Japan, respectively.

=== A-spec ===
The A-spec variant for the North American market was manufactured alongside the Ford Probe and Mazda 626 from 1992 as a 1993 model by AutoAlliance International in Flat Rock, Michigan. Three trim levels were available on the A-spec models:
* RS – Base model, fitted with the FS-DE 2.0 DOHC I4 engine, making .
* LS – Luxury model, fitted with the KL-DE 2.5 DOHC V6 engine, making . It was also equipped with alloy wheels, a low rear spoiler, an optional CD player, foglights, and leather or cloth interior.
* LS M-edition – A special edition based on the LS, including different, all-red tail lights, chrome scuff plates, an in-dash three-disc CD changer, gold alloy wheels (same design as LS), all gold badges, and M-edition embroidered on the front seats and floor mats. M-editions only came in three paint colors: a trim exclusive burgundy, black, and white. All had cream leather interiors and special gold pinstriping. The A-spec models never received 4WS.

In 1995, the second generation MX-6 was refreshed with different five-spoke alloy wheels, and emissions changes. Another major change after 1995 was the addition of OBD-II to the car. With this addition, the was decreased to for every year thereafter. Known as the &quot;GE2&quot;, this model ran until 1997. Unlike the first generation, the second-generation MX-6 only had one model with a different moniker – the Canadian MX-6 Mystère.

=== E-spec ===
Built from 1991 in Japan, for Australia, New Zealand, and Europe, compared to the A-spec, the E-spec has different headlights (a two-piece projector setup giving far greater lighting) and taillights, different front and rear bumpers, fog lights, wing-mirrors (power and heated), steering wheel, interior trim, and alloys as standard. The side indicator lights were mounted behind the front wheels, and no corner bumper lights were used. It also came with optional air conditioning and leather interior (standard from &#x27;96), and the MX-6&#x27;s main act – the 4WS system (not available in the UK). The engine was the same as the U.S. version (although not limited by lower-octane fuels) – the KL-DE 2.5 DOHC V6 engine, making and with the higher octane fuels used in Europe as standard, slightly lower mileage but with greater performance.

In Australia, the MX-6 was released in November 1991. Only one trim was available. Equipped with the KL-DE 2.5 DOHC V6 engine, sunroof, 4WS, etc., with the only remaining options being leather and electric seats. September 1994 was the release of the GE2 update model. Like Mazda Australia did with the GD2, now two choices were available – the 4WS, all-options MX-6, or the 2WS version. They both had new wheels, interior trim, and steering wheel, but only the 4WS version got the sunroof, CD player, leather (which actually only became standard in late &#x27;96), and the digital climate control. The MX-6 lasted until 1997, with the last few rolling out of dealers in 1998. The last one rolled off the assembly line on June 20, 1997.

=== J-spec ===
This version was also released in 1991, and is very similar to the E-spec (as they are built in the same place), but with minor changes. The version sold in Japan was exclusive to Japanese Mazda dealerships, and was not badge engineered and sold at other Mazda Japanese dealerships, unlike the MX-3, the MX-5, and the RX-7 coupes. One-piece headlights were fitted, with indicators incorporated in the fog light housing, as well as a different rear bumper with smaller registration plate cutout, similar to the A-spec. Almost everything was an option, but the 4WS was available, as well as the digital climate control, electric folding mirrors, larger centre console, and of course, the Mazdaspeed body add-ons – a subtle lip kit with Supra-style high-rise rear spoiler.

Engine choice was the KL-ZE 2.5 DOHC V6 making , a high-compression version of the KL-DE, or the KF-ZE 2.0 DOHC V6 making ; all of the K-series engines in the MX-6 were based on the same engine block and included those found in the Ford Probe, Xedos 6, and MX-3 V6 models. The KLZE had about 40 more horsepower than the KLDE versions for a few reasons. Although the displacement was the same, the KLZE had more durations on the cams, higher compression due to a different shape of pistons, and the intake manifold was different on the ZE. The KL-ZE intake manifold runners were shorter and wider than the KL-DE manifold. Also, the heads on the KL-ZE were ported and shaped differently. Not only was the ZE higher in compression, but it was also a higher-revving engine. The only flaws in the KL-ZE design were the weaker valve springs on the intake valves. This is usually corrected by using the KL-DE springs, keepers, and retainers which are stronger.

Four-wheel steering was used from 1987 to 1998 on both MX-6 GT and GE models. Four-wheel steering (4WS) was available on both the first-generation and second-generation MX-6 models, although the North American market only received it for the 1989 GT model. South African MX-6s never received 4WS.

According to Mazda, the system provided:
* Superior cornering stability
* Improved steering responsiveness and precision
* High-speed straight-line stability
* Notable improvement in rapid lane-changing maneuvers
* Smaller turning radius and tight-space maneuverability at low vehicle speed range
The system electronically controlled a rear rack that was behind the rear wheels. At low speeds (up to 35 km/h), the rear wheels move in the opposite direction from the front wheels, aiding parking and U-turns by lowering the turning circle. Above these speeds, the rear wheels move in the same direction as the front, meaning control during high-speed maneuvers such as lane changes or cornering was improved. Either way, the turning angle of the rear wheels was slight at just 5°, a measurement Mazda determined to be optimally effective and natural to human sensitivity.

* When the engine is turned off, the rear wheels straighten up. They change back to the angle of the front wheels when the engine is restarted. This is caused by the 4WS control unit powering down, and the fail-safe system overriding the rear rack.
* If the system ever faults, as a fail-safe, the rear wheels lock straight to allow the vehicle normal 2WS functionality.

== Future ==
On 16 October 2018, Mazda filed a trademark application with the Japanese Patent Office for the Mazda MX-6 nameplate which can be used for &quot;automobiles and parts and accessories thereof,&quot; hinting that the manufacturer may release a new generation MX-6 in the near future.

<doc id="732489" wikidata="Q7832012" url="?curid=732489" title="Trade Wars">
<text>Trade Wars is a series of video games dating back to 1984. The video games are inspired by &quot;Hunt the Wumpus&quot;, the board game &quot;Risk&quot;, and the original space trader game &quot;Star Trader&quot;.

==History==

The first game with the title, &quot;Trade Wars&quot;, by Chris Sherrick, was developed in BASIC for the TRS-80 Model II, and soon ported, by Sherrick, to the IBM PC for the Nochange BBS system in 1984. Sherrick conceived his game as a cross between Dave Kaufman&#x27;s BASIC program &quot;Star Trader&quot; (1974), the board game &quot;Risk&quot;, and Gregory Yob&#x27;s &quot;Hunt the Wumpus&quot; (1972).

Because Sherrick released his earliest versions with a free license, many variations of the game appeared over the next few years, including &quot;TWV - Galactic Armageddon&quot;, &quot;Yankee Trader&quot;, and &quot;TW2&quot; (a development of the original by John Morris who took over from Chris Sherrick).

One of the more popular variants is the &quot;TradeWars 2002&quot; series (Gary Martin, John Pritchett, 1986). &quot;TW2002&quot; was designed originally as a WWIV chain (a way of calling external programs which was a part of Turbo Pascal 3 - and one that often required the source code to work, which is why so many people were able to get copies) in September 1986 by a sysop named James T Gunderson with the handle &quot;Lord Darkseid&quot; (his BBS was called Apokolips, and he was apparently a DC Comics fan). Its original name was &quot;TW2 for WWIV&quot; - and it shared no source code with the Sherrick version, which was written in Basic. Another WWIV sysop - B0b &quot;OM&quot; Mosley - made additional modifications, including porting the code to Turbo Pascal 4.x specifications, numerous bug fixes, a series of cosmetic changes to allow the game to reflect a &quot;Star Trek&quot; theme, and development of a map editor that allowed for both larger maps and the ability to randomly generate new maps as well as reinitialize the game&#x27;s databases to reflect the new map data. High school student Dylan Tynan (&quot;Sorcerer&quot; and &quot;Alex and Droogs&quot;), worked with Mosley during the rewrite, serving as the primary tester, as well as contributing source fixes and additional features. After two years of development, Mosley released the source code for the game and editor, which allowed fellow WWIV sysop Gary Martin to make his own changes to the included source code. Gary&#x27;s first version was &quot;Trade Wars 2001&quot;, and it contained many of the base features. It also used exactly the same TWSECT.DAT file (the file which contains the information on all of the warp points in the game) as &quot;Trade Wars 2002&quot;.

While &quot;TW2001&quot; was well received, Gary decided to expand the game further. In addition to the port in Sector 1 where the players could buy fighters/shields/holds, another port was added called the Stardock where the players could buy new types of ships. Over a period of time, feature after feature was added, so that &quot;Trade Wars 2002&quot; v0.96 was a different game than &quot;Trade Wars 2002&quot; v1.00. &quot;TW2002&quot; v1.00 was released in June 1991. One of the major design choices made was influenced by changes in the BBS software – WWIV author Wayne Bell had rewritten the WWIV BBS System using Turbo C instead of Turbo Pascal. This meant that classic Chain programs would no longer work, and &quot;Trade Wars 2002&quot; v2 used a general purpose door library which allowed the game to be run under other brands of BBS software for the first time.

&quot;TW2002&quot; v1, v2, &amp; v3 were BBS mainstays throughout the 1990s. In 1998, Gary Martin sold the &quot;Trade Wars&quot; license to John Pritchett, who had written &quot;Tradewars 2002&quot; v3 and its gold expansion. John and his company, EIS, developed a stand-alone game server, &quot;TradeWars Game Server&quot;, which has allowed &quot;Trade Wars&quot; to survive beyond the BBS era.

==Gameplay==
Though specifics vary between versions, in general the player is a trader in a galaxy with a fixed set of other players (either human or computer). The players seek to gain control of resources: usually fuel ore, food, and equipment, and travel through sectors of the galaxy trading them for money or undervalued resources. Players use their wealth to upgrade their spaceship with better weapons and defenses, and fight for control of planets and star bases.

Since the basics of the game structure are numerical, these games are not reliant on high resolution graphics or rapid processing, which makes them ideally suited to low-resource computing platforms.

Today, classic &quot;Trade Wars&quot; is primarily hosted by Windows NT/2000/XP computers running the Trade Wars Game Server (TWGS), which accepts incoming telnet connections and launches the Trade Wars ANSI game. &quot;Trade Wars&quot; is also run by many of the surviving BBSs, and variations have been ported to the web, cell phones, and the Palm OS.

==Reception==
&quot;Computer Gaming World&quot; in 1993 rated &quot;Trade Wars&quot; two points out of three, stating that for many players &quot;there is no 
other on-liner than &quot;Trade Wars&quot; ... This game will be around for a while, in one form or another&quot;.

==Legacy==
&quot;Trade Wars&quot; is cited as an influence by some game developers. Examples include Paul Sage, lead designer of &quot;Ultima Online&quot;, Josh Johnston, lead programmer of &quot;Jumpgate&quot;, and Eric Wang, producer of &quot;Earth &amp; Beyond&quot;. In 2013, the designers of &quot;Star Citizen&quot; listed &quot;Trade Wars 2002&quot; among the games that inspired the design of their in-game economy. Games that are often compared to TradeWars include &quot;EVE Online&quot;, &quot;Starport&quot;, &quot;Jumpgate&quot;, &quot;Rebel Galaxy&quot;, &quot;Elite Dangerous&quot;, &quot;Earth and Beyond&quot;, &quot;Pardus&quot;, and &quot;Spore&quot;. &quot;Trade Wars 2002&quot; was named the 10th best PC game of all time by &quot;PC World Magazine&quot; in 2009.

A major online game based on &quot;Trade Wars 2002&quot; was under development in the early 2000s under the name &quot;TW: Dark Millennium&quot;, later renamed &quot;Exarch&quot;. When the developer, Realm Interactive, was acquired by their publisher, NCsoft Austin (Richard Garriott/Destination Games), the development of &quot;Exarch&quot; was discontinued. What started as &quot;TW: DM&quot; was eventually released by NCsoft as &quot;Dungeon Runners&quot;.

<text>In the study of vision, visual short-term memory (VSTM) is one of three broad memory systems including iconic memory and long-term memory. VSTM is a type of short-term memory, but one limited to information within the visual domain.

The term VSTM refers in a theory-neutral manner to the non-permanent storage of visual information over an extended period of time. The visuospatial sketchpad is a VSTM subcomponent within the theoretical model of working memory proposed by Alan Baddeley; in which it is argued that a working memory aids in mental tasks like planning and comparison. Whereas iconic memories are fragile, decay rapidly, and are unable to be actively maintained, visual short-term memories are robust to subsequent stimuli and last over many seconds. VSTM is distinguished from long-term memory, on the other hand, primarily by its very limited capacity.

==Overview==

The introduction of stimuli which were hard to verbalize, and unlikely to be held in long-term memory, revolutionized the study of VSTM in the early 1970s. The basic experimental technique used required observers to indicate whether two matrices, or figures, separated by a short temporal interval, were the same. The finding that observers were able to report that a change had occurred, at levels significantly above chance, indicated that they were able to encode aspect of the first stimulus in a purely visual store, at least for the period until the presentation of the second stimulus. However, as the stimuli used were complex, and the nature of the change relatively uncontrolled, these experiments left open various questions, such as:
#whether only a subset of the perceptual dimensions comprising a visual stimulus are stored (e.g., spatial frequency, luminance, or contrast)
#whether perceptual dimensions are maintained in VSTM with greater fidelity than others
#the nature by which these dimensions are encoded (i.e., are perceptual dimensions encoded within separate, parallel channels, or are all perceptual dimensions stored as a single bound entity within VSTM?).

==Set-size effects==
Much effort has been dedicated to investigating the capacity limits of VSTM. In a typical change-detection task, observers are presented with two arrays, composed of a number of stimuli. The two arrays are separated by a short temporal interval, and the task of observers is to decide if the first and second arrays are identical, or whether one item differs across the two displays. Performance is critically dependent on the number of items in the array. While performance is generally almost perfect for arrays of one or two items, correct responses invariably decline in a monotonic fashion as more items are added. Different theoretical models have been put forward to explain limits on VSTM storage, and distinguishing between them remains an active area of research.

==Models of capacity limits==

===Slot models===
A prominent class of model proposes that observers are limited by the total number of items which can be encoded, either because the capacity of VSTM itself is limited. This type of model has obvious similarities to urn models used in probability theory. In essence, an urn model assumes that VSTM is restricted in storage capacity to only a few items, &quot;k&quot; (often estimated to lie in the range of three-to-five in adults, though fewer in children). The probability that a suprathreshold change will be detected is simply the probability that the change element is encoded in VSTM (i.e., &quot;k&quot;/&quot;N&quot;). This capacity limit has been linked to the posterior parietal cortex, the activity of which initially increases with the number of stimuli in the arrays, but saturates at higher set-sizes. Although urn models are used commonly to describe performance limitations in VSTM, it is only recently that the actual structure of items stored has been considered. Luck and colleagues have reported a series of experiments designed specifically to elucidate the structure of information held in VSTM. This work provides evidence that items stored in VSTM are coherent objects, and not the more elementary features of which those objects are composed.

===Noise models===
An alternative framework has more been put forward by Wilken and Ma who suggest that apparent capacity limitations in VSTM are caused by a monotonic decline in the quality of the internal representations stored (i.e., monotonic increase in noise) as a function of set-size. In this conception capacity limitations in memory are not caused by a limit on the number of things that can be encoded, but by a decline in the quality of the representation of each thing as more things are added to memory. In their 2004 experiments, they varied color, spatial frequency, and orientation of objects stored in VSTM using a signal detection theory approach. The participants were asked to report differences between the visual stimuli presented to them in consecutive order. The investigators found that different stimuli were encoded independently and in parallel, and that the major factor limiting report performance was neuronal noise (which is a function of visual set-size).

Under this framework, the key limiting factor on working memory performance is the precision with which visual information can be stored, not the number of items that can be remembered. Further evidence for this theory was obtained by Bays and Husain using a discrimination task. They showed that, unlike a &quot;slot&quot; model of VSTM, a signal-detection model could account both for discrimination performance in their study and previous results from change detection tasks. These authors proposed that VSTM is a flexible resource, shared out between elements of a visual scene—items that receive more resource are stored with greater precision. In support of this, they showed that increasing the salience of one item in a memory array led to that item being recalled with increased resolution, but at the cost of reducing resolution of storage for the other items in the display.

==Psychophysical models==
Psychophysical experiments suggest that information is encoded in VSTM across multiple parallel channels, each channel associated with a particular perceptual attribute. Within this framework, a decrease in an observer&#x27;s ability to detect a change with increasing set-size can be attributed to two different processes: 
#if decisions are made across different channels, decreases in performance are typically small, and consistent with decreases expected when making multiple independent decisions
#if multiple decisions are made within the same channel, the decrease in performance is much greater than expected on the basis of increased decision-noise alone, and is attributed to interference caused by multiple decisions within the same perceptual channel.

However, the Greenlee-Thomas model suffers from two failings as a model for the effects of set-size in VSTM. First, it has only been empirically tested with displays composed of one or two elements. It has been shown repeatedly in various experimental paradigms that set-size effects differ for displays composed of a relatively small number of elements (i.e., 4 items or less), and those associated with larger displays (i.e., more than 4 items). The Greenlee-Thomas model offers no explanation for why this might be so. Second, while Magnussen, Greenlee, and Thomas are able to use this model to predict that greater interference will be found when dual decisions are made within the same perceptual dimension, rather than across different perceptual dimensions, this prediction lacks quantitative rigor, and is unable to accurately anticipate the size of the threshold increase, or give a detailed explanation of its underlying causes.

In addition to the Greenlee-Thomas model, there are two other prominent approaches for describing set-size effects in VSTM. These two approaches can be referred to as sample size models, and urn models. They differ from the Greenlee-Thomas model by: 
#ascribing the root cause of set-size effects to a stage prior to decision making
#making no theoretical distinction between decisions made in the same, or across different, perceptual dimensions.

==Intermediate visual store==
There is some evidence of an intermediate visual store with characteristics of both iconic memory and VSTM. This intermediate store is proposed to have high capacity (up to 15 items) and prolonged memory trace duration (up to 4 seconds). It coexists with VSTM but unlike it visual stimuli can overwrite the contents of its visual store. Further studies suggests an involvement of visual area V4 in the retention of information about the color of the stimulus in visual working memory, and the role of the VO1 area for retaining information about its shape. It has been shown that in the VO2 region all characteristics of the stimulus retained in memory are combined into a holistic image.

==The function of visual short-term memory representations==
VSTM is thought to be the visual component of the working memory system, and as such it is used as a buffer for temporary information storage during the process of naturally occurring tasks. But what naturally occurring tasks actually require VSTM? Most work on this issue has focused on the role of VSTM in bridging the sensory gaps caused by saccadic eye movements. These sudden shift of gaze typically occur 2–4 times per second, and vision is briefly suppressed while the eyes are moving. Thus, the visual input consists of a series of spatially shifted snapshots of the overall scene, separated by brief gaps. Over time, a rich and detailed long-term memory representation is constructed from these brief glimpses of the input, and VSTM is thought to bridge the gaps between these glimpses and to allow the relevant portions of one glimpse to be aligned with the relevant portions of the next glimpse. Both spatial and object VSTM systems may play important roles in the integration of information across eye movements. Eye movements are also affected by VSTM representations. The constructed representations held in VSTM can affect eye movements even when the task does not explicitly require eye movements: the direction of small microsaccades point towards the location of objects in VSTM.

<doc id="732499" wikidata="Q4017713" url="?curid=732499" title="Wakefield (band)">
<text>Wakefield was an American rock band from Mechanicsville, Maryland, formed in 2000. The band consisted of singer and guitarist Ryan Escolopio, his brother and drummer Aaron Escolopio, their cousin and bassist Mike Schoolden, and guitarist and main writer J.D. Tennyson.

== History ==

===Early years===

Ryan Escolopio, J.D. Tennyson, and Mike Schoolden formed the band with their friend Mark Martinez in 2000. In their early days, the band played clubs such as Piezano&#x27;s Pizza, Wood&#x27;s Holy Grounds in Severna Park, Maryland, and My Brother&#x27;s Place in Waldorf, Maryland. In 2001 they supported Good Charlotte at a show sponsored by 99.1 WHFS. It took place at Arundel High School as a reward for a student food drive (headed by the Arundel Key Club). Aaron Escolopio joined after leaving Good Charlotte. Wakefield played their first show with Aaron at CBGB in New York on June 6, 2001.

During their early years, Wakefield was able to tour with Catch 22, the Mighty Mighty Bosstones, Allister, Riddlin Kids, and others.

===&quot;American Made&quot; (2003)===
Wakefield announced on August 12, 2001, that they&#x27;d been signed to a record deal with Lava Records, a subsidiary of Atlantic Records, headed by Jason Flom. The band recorded a full album of their current songs at the A&amp;M studios in California, but Wakefield was dropped before the album was released. The band was then signed by Arista Records, where they would release their debut album, &quot;American Made&quot; on May 6, 2003. &quot;American Made&quot; featured a combination of several new songs and older fan-favorite songs. In support of the album, Wakefield spent many months on the road, touring with bands including the All-American Rejects, Home Grown, Riddlin&#x27; Kids, and Reel Big Fish.

The first single off American Made was &quot;Say You Will&quot;, a pop punk song that made it into the rotation of many rock music and Top 40 radio stations. The band also recorded a music video for the song, which received airplay mostly on MTV2 and Fuse. In June 2003, the video was voted as the Nickelodeon Video Pick of the Week and in Canada was featured on &#x27;Oven Fresh&#x27;. They also produced a single for the video game Tak and the Power of Juju in October of 2003.

=== &quot;Which Side Are You On?&quot; (2005) ===
Wakefield made several appearances in pop culture following the success of &quot;American Made&quot;. Their cover of the Iggy Pop song &quot;Real Wild Child&quot; appeared on the soundtrack for &quot;Eurotrip&quot;, titled &quot;Wild One&quot;. They also did a music video to &quot;Wild One&quot; for the extras on &quot;Tak and the Power of Juju&quot;.

The band also made an uncredited appearance in the Olsen twins movie &quot;New York Minute&quot;. Ryan, JD, and Mike appeared as the studio band for drummer Roxy (Mary-Kate Olsen), and Aaron appeared as the band&#x27;s producer. The band recorded a cover of the David Bowie song &quot;Suffragette City&quot; for the &quot;New York Minute&quot; soundtrack.

Wakefield released their second and what would be their final studio album, titled &quot;Which Side Are You On?&quot; through Jive Records on January 6, 2005. The first single from the album was &quot;C&#x27;mon Baby&quot;. Also appearing on the album is the song &quot;After School Special&quot; which was co-written with and produced by Butch Walker. The album had a number of producers and co-writers - Scott Cutler and John Fields to name a few. &quot;Which Side Are You On?&quot; also featured Ryan and JD&#x27;s producing debut for &quot;Clean 1145&quot;.

===(2008)===

Wakefield are believed to have broken up; their Facebook page is no longer active.

===(2023)===

Wakefield announced 20th anniversary reunion show for New Years Eve 2023 at The Rex in Leonardtown, Maryland.

<text>Betty Louise Van Patter (née Floyd; October 12, 1929 – ), was a bookkeeper for the Black Panther Party, although she herself was white. Van Patter was murdered, a crime which remains unsolved.

==Biography==
After serving as a bookkeeper for &quot;Ramparts&quot; magazine, Van Patter became an aide to Panther leader Elaine Brown in 1974, after being introduced to the Party by David Horowitz. Van Patter went missing on December 13, 1974. Some weeks later, her severely beaten corpse was found on a San Francisco Bay beach.

There was insufficient evidence for police to charge anyone with van Patter&#x27;s death, but the Black Panther Party was &quot;almost universally believed to be responsible,&quot; wrote Frank Browning in 1987. According to other authors, Huey Newton allegedly confessed to a friend that he had ordered Van Patter&#x27;s murder, and that Van Patter had been tortured and raped before being killed. Christopher Hitchens wrote in the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; in 2003 that: &quot;There is no doubt now, and there was precious little then, of the Panther leadership&#x27;s complicity in this revolting crime&quot;. &quot;While it was true that I had come to dislike Betty Van Patter, I had fired her, not killed her&quot;, Elaine Brown wrote in 1993. Brown said Van Patter was fired because she was too nosy about the Black Panther Party and was no longer of use to the party. She had reportedly threatened to make public her discovery that the party doctored its books and had major tax problems.

<doc id="732506" wikidata="Q747891" url="?curid=732506" title="Pat Roach">
<text>Francis Patrick Roach (19 May 1937 – 17 July 2004) was an English professional wrestler, martial artist and actor. During an acting career between the 1970s and the 1990s, he appeared in multiple films, usually as a henchman. He appeared in the &quot;Indiana Jones&quot; film series, as the West Country bricklayer Brian &quot;Bomber&quot; Busbridge in the 1980s British television series &quot;Auf Wiedersehen, Pet&quot;, and in the role of Petty Officer Edgar Evans in the television production &quot;The Last Place on Earth&quot;.

==Early life==
Roach was born and brought up in Birmingham, West Midlands, the son of Francis &quot;Frank&quot; Roach (born 1905). He was National Judo Champion in 1960, and Midland Area Black Belt Champion in 1962.

==Sports career==
Roach boxed as an amateur before becoming professional as a protege of Jack Solomons.

He began his professional wrestling career under the name of &quot;Judo&quot; Pat Roach. After his acting career had begun, he continued to wrestle under the name of &quot;Bomber&quot; Pat Roach, having previously been billed as &quot;Big&quot; Pat Roach before receiving affectionate cheering from the audience. He was trained by Alf Kent and his first official wrestling match was against George Selko in 1960. Roach held both the British and European heavyweight championships at one time.

==Acting career==
Roach made his acting debut as the red-bearded bouncer in the Korova Milkbar in Stanley Kubrick&#x27;s &quot;A Clockwork Orange&quot;. He worked on another Kubrick film, &quot;Barry Lyndon&quot;, where he played a hand-to-hand brawler named Toole who engages Ryan O&#x27;Neal in a fistfight. Roach went on to play a number of strong-man supporting character roles in films in the 1970s, 80s, and 90s, including the nonspeaking role of Hephaestus in &quot;Clash of the Titans&quot;.

Pat cameoed as a SPECTRE assassin in the &#x27;unofficial&#x27; James Bond film &quot;Never Say Never Again&quot;, and as bandit-warlord Lord Brytag in the sword-and-sorcery film &quot;Red Sonja&quot;. He appeared as the skull-helmeted General Kael in the film &quot;Willow&quot;; the evil wizard Thoth-Amon in &quot;Conan the Destroyer&quot; and as the Celtic chieftain in &quot;Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves&quot;.

In 1985, he played Petty Officer Edgar Evans in the Central TV serial &quot;The Last Place on Earth&quot; about Captain Scott&#x27;s expedition to the South Pole. Roach was turned down as Darth Vader in &quot;Star Wars&quot;; however, its director, George Lucas, subsequently cast him as several burly villains in the &quot;Indiana Jones&quot; film series in the 1980s. In &quot;Raiders of the Lost Ark&quot; he played two roles, the first being a giant Sherpa who fights Jones in the bar in Nepal, the second being a German Luftwaffe mechanic who fistfights with Jones before being killed by an aircraft&#x27;s propeller blades on the airstrip in Egypt. In the next film, &quot;Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom&quot;, Roach played the Thuggee guard overseer in a mine who fights with Jones before being killed in a rock crusher. His final appearance in the series was as a Gestapo officer in &quot;Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade&quot;, where he appears only briefly due to the character&#x27;s fight with Jones having been director Steven Spielberg considered the scene &quot;too long&quot;, and served as a subplot.

On television Roach played the down-to-earth and easy going Brian &quot;Bomber&quot; Busbridge in the long running comedy-drama &quot;Auf Wiedersehen, Pet&quot;. He appeared in all four series, but was absent from the final two-part Christmas special.

He appeared as a guest on Central’s Bullseye TV show in 1984.

==Personal life==

<text>The National Italian American Sports Hall of Fame is a 501 (c)(3) nonprofit institution honoring exceptional U.S. athletes of Italian descent. In 1977 George Randazzo created the Italian American Boxing Hall of Fame. This was as a means for raising money for local Catholic youth programs. After a successful year and dinner honoring 23 former Italian American boxing champions, Randazzo created the National Italian American Sports Hall of Fame. The original location was in Elmwood Park, Illinois. The first induction ceremony honored Lou Ambers, Eddie Arcaro, Charley Trippi, Gino Marchetti, Dom DiMaggio, Joe DiMaggio, and Vince Lombardi. Since its founding in 1978, more than 230 Italian Americans have been inducted into this hall of fame.

The Hall of Fame and museum was located in a 44,000-square-foot (4,000 m²) building on Taylor Street in the heart of Chicago&#x27;s &quot;Little Italy&quot; neighborhood from 2000 until 2019. The Hall of Fame is now based on the city&#x27;s north side.

== History ==
In 1977, George Randazzo founded the Italian American Boxing Hall of Fame as a way to raise money for a struggling local Catholic youth program. Randazzo collected boxing photos and memorabilia, a hobby that inspired him to organize a fundraising dinner that brought together a list of boxing greats and celebrities. The dinner honored twenty-three former Italian American boxing world champions, including Rocky Graziano, Jake LaMotta, Sammy Angott, Willie Pep, and posthumously Rocky Marciano, Primo Carnera and Tony Canzoneri.

The results were so overwhelming that a friend and local businessman, Don Ponte, encouraged Randazzo to start a Hall of Fame to honor all Italian American athletes. One year later, the National Italian American Sports Hall of Fame was founded as a non-profit, educational institution. The first induction ceremony and banquet was a star-studded event, as the Hall of Fame honored Lou Ambers, Eddie Arcaro, Charlie Trippi, Gino Marchetti, Dom DiMaggio and “The Yankee Clipper,” Joe DiMaggio. Mrs. Vince Lombardi also accepted the posthumous induction of her late husband, Coach Vince Lombardi.

In the years that followed, celebrities from all walks of life have come to the annual induction ceremonies to pay tribute to outstanding Italian American sports champions and heroes. An uninvited guest took part in the 1980 induction ceremony: President Jimmy Carter offered his congratulations and addressed the crowd. In 1988 the Hall of Fame moved its headquarters from Elmwood Park to Arlington Heights.

The NIASHF enjoyed a new beginning in 1998 with the help of Phoenix Suns Chairman/CEO Jerry Colangelo. A 1994 Inductee and Chicago Heights native, Colangelo was asked by Randazzo to serve as Chairman of an ambitious new Hall of Fame building project in the heart of Chicago’s Little Italy. Colangelo accepted, and succeeded in bringing together civic-minded men and women from across the country in support of the project. In 2000 the new facility was dedicated as “The Jerry Colangelo Center,” a tribute to his efforts and leadership. There are over 230 Inductees enshrined in the NIASHF.

== Grand Piazza ==
The Grand Piazza was located on the third floor of the National Italian American Sports Hall of Fame. This banquet and dining area featured an adjacent outdoor terrace and banquet space with a commercial kitchen, an event space used corporate luncheons, dinner meetings, weddings, or any sit-down reception of up to 300 guests. The Rooftop Terrace was located on the fourth floor of the Hall of Fame, and overlooks the city of Chicago.

<doc id="732511" wikidata="Q482786" url="?curid=732511" title="Harisu">
<text>Lee Kyung-eun (born February 17, 1975), better known by her stage name Harisu (), is a South Korean pop singer, model, and actress. In 2002, she became the second person in Korea to legally change their gender. Her stage name is an adaptation of the English phrase &quot;hot issue&quot;.

She first gained public attention in 2001, after appearing in a television commercial for DoDo cosmetics. The commercial was a success and marked the launch of her career, which allowed her to branch out into other fields such as music and acting. She has recorded five Korean musical albums, switching genres between techno and R&amp;B, and her overseas releases have featured songs recorded in Mandarin. Her first major acting role was in the 2001 film &quot;Yellow Hair 2&quot;, and since then her credits have included &quot;Hi! Honey&quot;, a Taiwanese drama series, and &quot;Colour Blossoms&quot;, an erotic drama by Hong Kong filmmaker Yonfan. On May 19, 2007, Harisu married Micky Jung, but the couple divorced in 2017.

== Early life and transition ==
Harisu was born in Seongnam, Korea, and is one of five children. Although assigned male at birth, she knew she was female from an early age, recalling, &quot;I was always a girl who loved playing with dolls.&quot; This did not go unnoticed by her family or school friends, who often remarked that she looked and acted like a girl. A failed relationship with a boy during her teenage years convinced Harisu of the need to change her sex, and by the time she graduated from the all-boys Naksaeng High School, she was already undergoing hormone replacement therapy. It was for this reason that she was exempted from the military service usually required of males in the Republic of Korea, being rejected on the grounds of &quot;mental illness&quot;. By the end of the 1990s, Harisu had undergone several surgeries in Korea and Japan including: breast augmentation, sex reassignment surgery, rhinoplasty, and surgery to increase the size of her hips.

Harisu lived in Japan for several years, where she studied to be a hair stylist. It was while working as a nightclub singer that she was discovered by a talent agency, and soon after she began her career as a model. After returning to Korea in 2000, she signed with management company TTM Entertainment, and first began using the stage name &quot;Harisu&quot;, derived from the English phrase &quot;hot issue&quot;.

== Career ==

=== Debut ===

Harisu made her acting debut in 1991—while still living as a boy—as a supporting actor in a high school TV drama series, and this was followed by other minor film and TV roles as an extra during the 1990s.

Her big break came in early 2001, when she appeared in a TV commercial for DoDo cosmetics. The commercial hinted at the fact she is transgender, zooming in to reveal her Adam&#x27;s apple (although this was added digitally, since Harisu herself does not have a prominent Adam&#x27;s apple). DoDo were initially cautious about using the commercial and had been prepared to withdraw it if the response was negative, but the commercial turned out to be a big success and quickly established her as a celebrity. As the Republic of Korea&#x27;s first transgender entertainer, there was a great deal of media interest in Harisu, and she was routinely described as being &quot;more beautiful than a woman&quot;. Explaining her reasons for &quot;coming out&quot;, she said, &quot;I don&#x27;t want to face people dishonestly. I won&#x27;t be able to hide it after all. It&#x27;s better to make it clear from the start.&quot; In June 2001, Harisu was the subject of a television documentary produced by KBS, which covered her childhood, family relationships, and debut as an entertainer.

Later that year she was cast in the film &quot;Yellow Hair 2&quot;, her first leading role. In addition to contributing songs for the film&#x27;s soundtrack, Harisu played a transsexual who goes on the run after the apparent death of a convenience store owner. Regarding her decision to appear in the film, she said, &quot;I wanted to break the stereotype of transsexuals — the demureness and extreme weakness with which they are often portrayed.&quot; The film was released on July 21.

Also in 2001, Harisu published her autobiography, &quot;Eve from Adam&quot;, and appeared in a music video for dance group Turbo. In September, she entered the K-pop music scene with her debut album, &quot;Temptation&quot;, a mix of techno-style pop music and slow ballads, which peaked at number 32 on the MIAK (Music Industry Association of Korea) K-pop albums chart. She released her second album, &quot;Liar&quot;, in October 2002, describing it as &quot;a high-energy dance record with a very upbeat rhythm.&quot; &quot;Liar&quot; became her biggest domestic chart success, reaching number 23 in its first month of release.

=== 2003–2005 ===
In October 2003, Harisu made the decision to leave her management company, TTM Entertainment. However, TTM claimed to hold the rights to her stage name, and announced their intentions to use that name to promote other artists. The matter was taken to court, and in early 2004 the ruling went in favour of Harisu, allowing her to keep the name. She subsequently set up her own company, G&amp;F Entertainment, in order to make her own decisions regarding her career. In February she released her third album, &quot;Foxy Lady&quot;, which marked a change from the sound of her previous albums towards a more hip-hop/R&amp;B style, with Harisu saying &quot;now I am on my own, and showing my true colors, doing exactly the kind of music that I&#x27;ve always wanted.&quot; The album, however, failed to make the top 50 in the Korean charts.

In 2004, Harisu began to develop her career overseas, expressing frustration at being &quot;pigeon-holed&quot; as a transsexual in Korea. She starred in the Taiwanese drama series &quot;Hi! Honey&quot; alongside local celebrity Pace Wu, despite not being fluent in Mandarin (her lines were spoken in Korean and later dubbed). She drew attention by promoting sanitary napkins in a series of advertisements for Taiwanese company UFT, for which she was paid an estimated ₩100 million per ad. Although she had been initially reluctant to take on the project, observers hailed the casting of a trans woman in such a campaign as a sign of progress. Towards the end of the year Harisu appeared in Yonfan&#x27;s &quot;Colour Blossoms&quot;, an erotic drama film from Hong Kong in which she shared a role with veteran Japanese actress Keiko Matsuzaka. Released on October 18, 2004, it was poorly received at the box office and by the media, though it had some success at film festivals, and picked up several awards and nominations.

Harisu made a return to Korean screens in early 2005, after being cast in the MBC miniseries &quot;Beating Heart&quot;, her first major role in a Korean drama. She starred in several episodes as a transsexual woman, returning to her family after a lengthy absence in a bid to gain acceptance. Later that year her &quot;Foxy Lady&quot; album was released in Taiwan and China with the inclusion of songs re-recorded in Mandarin, and she was even promoted by her Taiwanese record label as the &quot;Kylie Minogue of the East&quot;. In September 2005, Harisu gained a foothold in Malaysia after signing a three-year memorandum of understanding with Hock Star Entertainment, a deal which included the production of two feature films and secured the Malaysian release of her album.

=== 2006–present ===
After a prolonged absence from the Korean music scene, Harisu returned in January 2006 with her fourth, self-titled album. Although her comeback was originally scheduled for the summer of 2005, this had been prevented by other commitments overseas. The album was preceded by a digital single, &quot;Winter Story&quot;, and marked a change in her image, with an emphasis on being &quot;cute&quot; rather than &quot;sexy&quot;. &quot;Harisu&quot; charted at number 46 in Korea, and as with her previous album it was released in Taiwan and China with extra songs recorded in Mandarin. Her fifth Korean album, &quot;Summer&quot;, was released just six months later, though it failed to chart in the top 50.

Her next film—the first as part of the deal with Hock Star Entertainment—was &quot;Possessed&quot;, a Malaysian horror film released on November 30, 2006, in which she starred alongside Amber Chia. Harisu played Lisu, a murdered pop singer who becomes a vengeful ghost, and also performed the films theme song, though it was necessary for her dialogue to be spoken in Korean and later dubbed. She was praised by director Bjarne Wong for her hard work and professionalism, and has hinted that they may collaborate on another film in the future.

In early 2007, Harisu was cast as the lead actress in &quot;Police Line&quot;, a Korean drama series produced for cable network On-Media. The series, based around a special unit for victims of sexual abuse, starred Harisu as a policewoman who was molested as a child by her stepfather. Filming for &quot;Police Line&quot; began in April 2007, and the series was launched in June with Harisu&#x27;s husband Micky Jung making a cameo appearance. In December 2007, Harisu released a digital mini-album, &quot;Winter Special&quot;, which featured a duet with her husband on the track &quot;First Snow&quot;.

Harisu published a collection of essays in Japan in March 2008, titled &quot;Haris Beauty&quot; (sic). The essays formed a comprehensive guide to beauty, diet and fashion, and contained photographs of Harisu taken by Yamagishi Shin, who had traveled to Seoul the previous December for a four-day photo shoot. Harisu also provided narration for the visually impaired for the 2008 film &quot;If You Were Me: Anima Version 2&quot;, an animated film about human rights.

As of 2008, Harisu believed that she still faced discrimination within the entertainment industry, saying on television, &quot;Many people pretend to smile and welcome me, but after the filming, they&#x27;d scold me behind my back&quot;.

== Personal life ==
Harisu&#x27;s decision to undergo sex reassignment surgery placed a strain on her relationship with her family, and she noted that when her parents first found out they &quot;were very upset. They weren&#x27;t angry, but very sad.&quot; Her father in particular had great difficulty accepting his child as a daughter, but her family have since accepted this and show great pride in her career.

Harisu has been given credit for raising social awareness of transgender people in the Republic of Korea, and has said in interviews that she hopes to be a role model for other trans people. In April 2007, she came to the aid of a Chinese trans woman unable to afford surgery, giving her the financial support needed to undergo this costly procedure. Affected by the 2008 suicides of gay actor Kim Ji-hoo and transgender television personality Jang Chae-won, Harisu opened a transgender club &quot;Mix-Trans&quot; in Apgujeong-dong, southern Seoul, in June 2009.

=== Legal recognition of gender ===
On November 29, 2002, Harisu filed a petition with the Incheon District Court to have her sex corrected on her family register, and that her birth name be changed to Lee Kyung-eun. The subsequent court ruling went in her favour, and on December 13, 2002, she became the second person in the Republic of Korea to legally change their sex. Speaking of the difficulties she had previously encountered, Harisu has said: &quot;My most embarrassing moments were when I have had to show my personal identification card in public... I couldn&#x27;t get a passport, visa or even my own bank accounts because I was legally a man&quot;.

=== Marriage ===
Since her debut in 2001, Harisu has consistently expressed a desire to marry and have a family of her own. In 2005, she began dating Micky Jung (real name Jung Yong-jin), a rapper whom she had met online. Jung, who had been a member of dance group EQ during the 1990s, later joined Harisu&#x27;s management company and worked on her fourth and fifth albums. The couple briefly separated in 2006, but were reunited after Jung saw her dating another man on a TV show. Rumours that the two were to marry began circulating in November 2006, and a date for the wedding was announced in February, following meetings between their respective families. Harisu and Jung starred in a reality television show on cable network Mnet showing their everyday lives and preparations for their wedding, but the couple were subjected to harsh criticism from netizens.

On May 19, 2007, Harisu and Jung were married at Central City Millennium Hall in the Seocho-gu district of Seoul. The ceremony was presided over by KBS anchor Shin Young-il, and officiated by Kim Seok-Kwun, a Dong-A University professor who had performed Harisu&#x27;s sex change surgery in the 1990s. The couple honeymooned on the Thai island of Ko Samui, and began their married life at Harisu&#x27;s family home in Nonhyun-dong, in the Gangnam-gu district of Seoul. The couple have said that they plan to adopt four children, though the news prompted a mixed public reaction. A poll by Mnet found that 69% of 1,300 respondents were in favour of Harisu&#x27;s decision to adopt, while in a similar poll by Daum, 58% of 8,094 respondents were against the idea. Harisu and Jung divorced in 2017 after ten years of marriage.

=== Welfare and politics ===
In November 2007, Harisu unveiled plans to build and run an orphanage, stating that it was one of her &quot;long-cherished dreams&quot;. With the support of her husband and mother-in-law, she purchased a plot of land in Janghowon, Gyeonggi-do, and studied for a community service license. Harisu campaigned for the New Progressive Party in the 2008 Republic of Korea legislative elections, supporting the legalization of marijuana.

== Discography ==
As of 2007, Harisu has released five Korean language studio albums, though her song lyrics typically include English as well. While her early work has been described as &quot;techno-flavored K-pop&quot;, her more recent albums have leaned towards the R&amp;B, hip-hop, and disco genres. She has named Madonna and Janet Jackson as her musical influences; of her contemporaries, she holds Chae Rina in high esteem.

<doc id="732515" wikidata="Q177744" url="?curid=732515" title="Areolar gland">
<text>Areolar glands, also known as glandulae areolares, Montgomery glands, and tubercula areolae, are 10-15 elevations found on the areola. They are usually arranged in a circle around the nipple, and can be particularly visible when the nipple is erect. Their role is to promote adequate breastfeeding of the infant.

They are sebaceous glands, which secrete sebum oil that is a free fatty acid onto the skin that lubricates the nipple when breastfeeding, protects the skin, and provides some air tightness between the infant&#x27;s mouth and the nipple. They also emit odor compounds into the air that attract babies.

In addition, a study of 121 white mothers found that higher numbers of areolar glands on the breasts (commonly known as AG number) was correlated with infants gaining weight faster and lactation beginning faster.

A meta-analysis shows that odor compounds emitted from lactating breasts reduced arousal states in active newborns, increases arousal states in sleepy newborns, and causes babies to turn their heads towards the breast, though the source of these effects were not strongly identified. A targeted study of 16 infants based on these observations has shown that these effects can be induced experimentally through a researcher directing a baby with areolar gland scent on a stick. Additionally, areolar gland scents cause these effects more strongly than milk or sebum odors.

== Structure ==
Areolar glands are round bumps found in the areola, and sometimes on the nipple.

=== Variation ===
The tubercles become more pronounced when the nipple is erect, and during pregnancy. The number of glands can vary greatly, usually averaging from 4 to 28 per breast.

== Function ==
Areolar glands make oily secretions (lipoid fluid) that keep the areola and the nipple lubricated and protected.

Volatile compounds in these secretions may also serve as an olfactory stimulus for newborn appetite.

Areolar glands, especially during pregnancy and lactation, emit odors that reliably cause newborn babies to face the breast and locate the nipple. Cleaning the breast or otherwise masking these scents makes it harder for newborns to find the nipple, and to get an important first drink of immunoprotective colostrum.

They can become exposed and raised when the nipple is stimulated. The skin over the surface opening is lubricated and tends to be smoother than the rest of the areola.

== Clinical significance ==
Areolar glands may secrete excessive amounts of oil. This is a neutral condition that rarely represents any underlying problem, unlike the spontaneous flow of milk from the breast.

== History ==
Areolar glands may also be called glands of Montgomery, or Montgomery tubercles. They are named after Dr. William Fetherstone Montgomery (1797–1859), an Irish obstetrician who first described them in 1837.

<doc id="732520" wikidata="Q30220826" url="?curid=732520" title="Saint Louis School">
<text>Saint Louis School, located in the neighborhood of St. Louis Heights in Honolulu, Hawaii, is a historic Catholic college preparatory school for boys. It was founded in 1846 to serve Catholics in the former Kingdom of Hawaii. Located within the Diocese of Honolulu, it is affiliated with the Society of Mary, a religious order of brothers and priests called the Marianists who also administer Chaminade University of Honolulu, formerly the college section of Saint Louis School. It is located near Sacred Hearts Academy, a girls&#x27; school founded by the Congregation of the Sacred Hearts of Jesus and Mary, and both schools hold joint programs such as cultural festivals and the JROTC.

==History==

===Establishment===

Saint Louis School was originally located in the Āhuimanu area of windward Oahu as the College of Āhuimanu, founded in 1846 by the Fathers of the Congregation of the Sacred Hearts of Jesus and Mary. In 1881, the school was relocated to Beretania Street, in downtown Honolulu, adjacent to Washington Place, the home of Liliuokalani, who was Queen of Hawaii from 1891 to 1893. When the school moved to downtown Honolulu, it was called the College of Saint Louis, named after the patron saint of Louis Maigret, Bishop of Honolulu. In 1883, the school moved again for a third time to Kamakela (known today as College Walk), on the bank of the Nuʻuanu Stream, near Chinatown, Honolulu. This remained the campus until the 1920s.

The high school and college sections eventually split up and the emblem for Saint Louis College can be seen above the door of the administration building of Chaminade University on the Chaminade/Saint Louis campus. Marianists assumed control of the school and determined a need to expand facilities to serve the burgeoning Hawaiian Catholic population, who included many Filipino immigrants. Because of the Marianist core mission to educate regardless of ethnic, religious, or fiscal means, the Order purchased land in Kalaepōhaku, a hillside division of Honolulu&#x27;s Kaimuki community, to enable the school to better serve Hawaii. Kalaepōhaku opened in September 1928 as Saint Louis School.

===Developments===

In the years following World War II, Saint Louis School re-evaluated its mission. Beginning in 1949, it dropped the lower grade levels one at a time, concentrating on a curriculum as a high school serving grades 9 through 12.

In 1980, it reinstated grades 7 and 8. In 1990, grade 6 was reinstated. The school created a middle school consisting of grades 6 through 8, operating independently within Saint Louis School. Grade 5 was reinstated and added to the middle school. In 2015 Saint Louis School announced its plans to expand again to become a K-12 school for the 2016–17 school year. The school currently provides for students from grades K-12.

==Academics==

Saint Louis School is fully accredited by the Western Catholic Education Association (WCEA) and the Western Association of Schools and Colleges (WASC). It offers three distinct curricula.

* An accelerated college preparatory program for students planning to attend very selective colleges or universities. This includes a partnership with Chaminade University of Honolulu, whereby students can take courses and remain on campus for dual-enrollment credit.
* A college preparatory program. 
* A general program for students planning to attend trade or business schools, two-year community colleges, or enter the military or work force.

==Athletics==

Saint Louis School plays competitively in the Interscholastic League of Honolulu (ILH) and the Hawai&#x27;i High School Athletic Association (HHSAA). Sometimes it fields members in the Pac-5, an alliance of Honolulu-area private academies.

As the state has no professional sports teams, high school teams in Hawaii are extremely popular with the public. Several generations of Hawaiian residents have become avid fans of Saint Louis School athletics, especially its football team. The &quot;Honolulu Advertiser&quot; and &quot;Honolulu Star-Bulletin&quot; newspapers have nicknamed Saint Louis School&#x27;s team as &quot;Hawaii&#x27;s Team;&quot; it has played in invitational tournaments throughout the world.

Saint Louis School also fields teams in bowling, cross country, kayaking, and water polo in the fall. In winter it competes in canoe paddling, basketball, soccer, swimming and diving, riflery, and wrestling. In spring it competes in baseball, golf, judo, track, lacrosse, and volleyball.

Saint Louis has had a strong history in Football winning a total of fourteen Oahu State Prep Bowls, in 1983 and consecutively from 1986 to 1998. Continuing from 1998 Saint Louis went on to win the HHSAA Football Championship in 1999, 2002, 2010, 2016, 2017, 2018, 2019, and most recently in 2024.

Saint Louis also won Hawaii state basketball championships in 1968 and 1986 with Kaipo Johnston Spencer first as a player in ‘68 then later as coach of the ‘86 team. In recent years, the Saint Louis basketball team has obtained significant success. In 2022, 2023, and 2024, the Crusaders managed to win a three-peat state championship.

<text>Hermann Esser (29 July 1900 – 7 February 1981) was an early member of the Nazi Party (NSDAP). A journalist, Esser was the editor of the Nazi paper, &quot;Völkischer Beobachter&quot;, a propaganda leader, and a vice president of the Reichstag. In the early days of the party, he was a &quot;de facto&quot; deputy of Adolf Hitler. As one of Hitler&#x27;s earliest followers and friends, he held influential positions in the party during the Weimar Republic, but increasingly lost influence during the Nazi era.

==Early life==
Esser was born in Röhrmoos, Kingdom of Bavaria. The son of a civil servant, he was educated in the high school at Kempten. As a teenager, he volunteered for service in World War I and fought on the front lines in the Royal Bavarian 19th Foot Artillery Regiment. After demobilization, he joined the Swabian &quot;Freikorps&quot;, and in May 1919 took part in the suppression of the Munich Soviet Republic. Esser early on became a socialist, after he joined a left-wing provincial newspaper to train as a journalist. He had previously formed his own Social Democrat party, but as it was small and one of numerous post-Armistice parties in Germany and Austria, it quickly failed.

==Nazi career==
Having met Anton Drexler through his work, he met with the group of men that formed the German Workers&#x27; Party (DAP): Drexler, Gottfried Feder and Dietrich Eckart, joining their party in January 1920. In 1920 he met Hitler in the regional press office of the &quot;Reichswehr&quot; (Army of the Weimar Republic) and joined the renamed National Socialist German Workers&#x27; Party in March 1920. In the fall of 1920, he began his public appearances in Passau. On 15 May 1921 he was made editor-in-chief of &quot;Völkischer Beobachter&quot;, the Party newspaper, turning out a series of posters and a book attacking the Jews.

Esser was able to use his abilities as a public speaker to rouse his audience, encouraging them to attack the political meetings of groups and parties that the NSDAP frowned upon. Esser&#x27;s speeches were described by Louis Snyder as &quot;crude, uncultured, of low moral character&quot;, featuring the kernel of future Nazi policies: extreme nationalism and anti-Semitism. On 12 August 1921 he left as editor of the Party newspaper and became the first head of propaganda (&quot;Propagandaleiter&quot;, NSDAP), serving until the party was outlawed in November 1923.

At the time of the Beer Hall Putsch on 8–9 November 1923, Esser gave a speech and drafted the Party&#x27;s &quot;proclamation to the German people&quot;, but told Hitler that he was ill and did not participate in the actual march. After the failure of the putsch, he fled to Austria. Along with Julius Streicher, he later returned to Bavaria in January 1924 and was sentenced to three months in prison. 

Esser was released from prison in April 1924 and later visited Hitler in Landsberg Prison. On 9 July 1924 he was elected the Deputy Chairman of the Nazi front organization, the Greater German People&#x27;s Community based in Bavaria under Streicher. He immediately made enemies with Gregor Strasser who was a leader of a rival organization in northern and western Germany which threatened to split the party in two. It was only in December 1924, after Hitler&#x27;s release from prison, that the split was avoided. 

When the party was re-established on 27 February 1925, Esser immediately rejoined and was given membership number 2. On 4 August 1925, Esser resumed his position as Propaganda Leader (&quot;Reichspropagandaleiter&quot;) and continued in this role until April 1926. After Esser fell out with Streicher, and Hitler sided with his opponent, Esser threatened to go to the media with the NSDAP&#x27;s secrets. He was bought off by being made editor of &quot;Illustrierter Beobachter&quot; from 1926 until 1932 in which he engaged the public through gossip and scandal. On 16 September 1926 he was made &quot;Gauleiter&quot; of Upper Bavaria and Swabia, serving until May 1927.

From December 1929 to April 1933, Esser was the Party&#x27;s floor leader in Munich&#x27;s &quot;Stadtrat&quot; (City Council). From 1929 to 1932, he also was a member of the Upper Bavarian &quot;Kreistag&quot; (District Assembly). In April 1932 he was elected to the Bavarian Landtag and became its president in April 1933, serving until it was dissolved on 14 October 1933. On 10 March 1933, when the Nazis seized control of the Bavarian state government, he was appointed one of the state&#x27;s representatives to the &quot;Reichsrat&quot; until its abolition on 14 February 1934. Also in March 1933, he was elected to the &quot;Reichstag&quot; representing electoral constituency 24, Upper Bavaria–Swabia. In December 1933 he was made 2nd Vice President of the chamber under Hermann Göring, and some time later was styled Deputy to the &quot;Reichstag&quot; President, the only person to hold this title. In May 1933, Esser returned to Passau to address a rally celebrating the dedication of the &quot;Ostmarkmuseum&quot;. He first wrote and published his book &quot;Die jüdische Weltpest&quot; (The Jewish World Plague) in 1933. After the pogroms of the &quot;Kristallnacht&quot; of 9 November 1938, he republished it in early 1939, again under the NSDAP press.

On 12 April 1933, he was appointed a Minister without Portfolio in the Bavarian government. He was also named head of the Bavarian Press Office and Chief of the Bavarian State Chancellery. This was followed on 1 March 1934 by his appointment as Bavaria&#x27;s Minister of Economics by Bavarian &quot;Reichsstatthalter&quot; (Reich Governor) Franz Ritter von Epp. Esser intrigued against the powerful &quot;Gauleiter&quot; of Gau Munich-Upper Bavaria Adolf Wagner and, as a result, was forced out of his ministerial posts on 14 March 1935. After his exclusion from politics in Bavaria, Esser did not wield any significant political power. In April 1936 he was appointed Chairman of the Reich Committee for Foreign Tourism, and on 27 January 1939 State Secretary for Tourism in the Reich Propaganda Ministry under Joseph Goebbels. On 4 March 1939 he was promoted to &quot;Gruppenführer&quot; of the National Socialist Flyers Corps (NSFK). His last official duty was on 24 February 1945 in Munich, delivering a speech on behalf of Hitler at the 25th anniversary of the adoption of the Nazi Party program.

==Scandals==
Esser enjoyed life and the power that his media and political power gave him with women. His dalliances led to his being marginalized. After he impregnated a young woman and refused to marry her, she appealed directly to Hitler, who told Esser that he must do the right thing. Upon the birth of the child, Hitler became its godfather.

Esser later sexually assaulted the underage daughter of a businessman. The combined disgust of Strasser, Streicher and Joseph Goebbels led to his suspension from the NSDAP in March 1935. Hitler had previously said of him, &quot;I know Esser is a scoundrel, but I shall hold on to him as long as he is useful to me.&quot;

==Post-war==
Arrested by the Americans after the end of the war in Europe, he was released in May 1948 after being considered an unimportant Nazi official. Esser then went into hiding only to be re-arrested in 1949 by the West German Police. Charged under the new West Germany anti-Nazification laws, he was found guilty of being a &quot;major offender&quot; and sentenced to five years hard labour with a loss of civil rights for life. He was released from custody in 1952.

In 1980, Bavaria&#x27;s Minister President Franz Josef Strauß congratulated Esser on his 80th birthday.

Esser died in Dietramszell, Bavaria aged 80 on 7 February 1981.

<text>Albert Austin (13 December 1882 – 17 August 1953) was an English actor, film star, director, and script writer, remembered for his work in Charlie Chaplin films.

==Biography==
Austin was born in Birmingham, Warwickshire, England, and was a music hall performer before going to the United States with Chaplin, both as members of the Fred Karno troupe in 1910.

Known for his painted handlebar moustache and acerbic manner, he worked for Chaplin&#x27;s stock company and played supporting roles in many of his films, often as a foil to the star and working as his assistant director.

After the development of sound films, he moved into scriptwriting, directing, and acting, chiefly in comedy shorts. Among other things, he assisted Chaplin in developing the plot of &quot;The Adventurer&quot; (1917). However, he only received screen credit as a collaborator once, for &quot;City Lights&quot; (1931).

As an actor, he appeared in Chaplin&#x27;s comedies for the Mutual Film Corporation. Later he had two brief, uncredited roles in one of Chaplin&#x27;s &#x27;silent&#x27; comedies made in the sound era, &quot;City Lights&quot;. Austin is also seen very briefly (as a cab driver) at the beginning of Chaplin&#x27;s short film &quot;One A.M.&quot; (1916). He also appeared in films starring Jackie Coogan and Mack Sennett.

Austin&#x27;s best known performance may be in Chaplin&#x27;s short &quot;The Pawnshop&quot; (1916). Austin enters the shop with an alarm clock, hoping to pawn it. To establish the clock&#x27;s value, Chaplin dissects it. Austin maintains a deadpan expression as Chaplin progressively destroys his clock, then hands the pieces back to Austin.

He had the leading role in Mary Pickford&#x27;s &quot;Suds&quot; (1920), where he co-stars as a customer leaving his shirt at her laundry. In that film he appears without his comic moustache.

In his final years he worked as a police officer at the Warner Brothers studios, according to a &quot;New York Times&quot; obituary. He died on 17 August 1953, and was interred at Grand View Memorial Park Cemetery in Glendale, California.

<text>Boisbriand () is an off-island suburb of Montreal, at the entrance of the Lower-Laurentides in southwestern Quebec, Canada, on the north shore of the Rivière des Mille Îles in the Thérèse-De Blainville Regional County Municipality.

Although relatively small, Boisbriand is bisected by three highways: Highway 13 on the west, Highway 15 on the east, and Highway 640 in the middle/north.

== History and Economy==
In September 1683, Louis XIV, King of France handed over to the soldier and seigneur Michel-Sidrac Dugué de Boisbriand a vast territory located north of the Rivière des Mille Îles. The territory extended from Terrebonne to the in Saint-Eustache.

In 1740, , daughter of Michel-Sidrac, was actively involved in the colonization of the territory. 1740 marked the reception of the first settlers on the seigneury. The brothers Joseph, François and Jean Charbonneau, settled near Grande-Côte, north of .

Around 1750, a seigneurial manor was built by her daughter Suzanne de Langloiserie of Blainville near Grande-Côte, where Highway 15 passes today. This manor has now disappeared. Later, Marie-Anne-Thérèse de Blainville Lamarque (known as Thérèse de Blainville) succeeded her mother and in turn settled in the manor.

The establishment of a first parish in 1789 concretized the colonization efforts and contributed to the acceleration of the settlement of the region. The construction of a church further north (the current site of the church of Sainte-Thérèse) created a new center of attraction. About fifteen years later, the first public roads were built, including Curé-Labelle Boulevard, which was called &quot;the Grand Line&quot; at the time.

It was not until 1845 that a new system of administration was established, providing for the election of administrators (mayor and councilmen) by landowners. The year 1888 marked the advent of electricity in the region and the industrial era began.

On January 1, 1946, the municipality of Sainte-Thérèse-Ouest was founded. It was a detachment of the large parish of Sainte-Thérèse, which originally included the current territories of Saint-Augustin, Saint-Janvier, Sainte-Monique, Sainte-Thérèse, Rosemère, Bois-des-Filion, Lorraine and Blainville. On July 15, 1970, when the population of the municipality numbered 5,600, the Lieutenant Governor of Quebec granted the municipality&#x27;s request and granted it by letters patent the status of a &quot;city&quot; governed by the Cities and Towns Act under the name of &quot;Sainte-Thérèse-Ouest&quot;. The council of this municipality, which had only one ward, was composed of the mayor and six councilmen.

In 1964, General Motors Canada (GM) decided to build its plant in Boisbriand. There were several reasons for this decision: the bearing capacity of the soil, which is made up of solid rock located at shallow depths, the proximity of the new Highway 15 and a main railway line.
On October 12, 1965, the inauguration of GM&#x27;s Quebec plant took place, on the current site of the Faubourg Boisbriand shopping center.

In 1969, the municipality of Sainte-Thérèse-Ouest was required to give up a significant portion of its territory while the Government of Canada expropriated a large tract of land for the development of the Montréal–Mirabel International Airport, which would be designated as Mirabel. As a result, part of Côte-Nord Road and all the territory north of this road, including Côte Sainte-Marianne, was now part of the territory of the City of Mirabel.
On March 16, 1974, the name of the town of &quot;Sainte-Thérèse-Ouest&quot; was changed to &quot;Boisbriand&quot; by proclamation signed by the Lieutenant Governor of Quebec. This name change concluded a debate that began in 1969 when the current municipal council tried to change the name of the city to that of Boisbriand but abandoned its project, following vigorous negative representations from two major companies in the city. In 1972, one of the members of the new Council elected in November 1970, J. Maurice Roussel, presented a new resolution, accompanied by arguments carefully prepared and supported by the various local organizations, whose representatives were present in the council chamber. Some members of council suggested that the project be put under consideration, but Councillor Roussel objected vigorously and asked for a vote. Council had no choice but to unanimously adopt the resolution and ask lawyer Claude Ouellette to move forward. Despite numerous pressures from companies including General Motors, the project was successfully completed.

In 1994, the Electoral Representation Commission of Quebec sanctioned the division of the city into electoral districts, of which there will be eight. This division was mandatory since the official population of the city had surpassed 20,000 inhabitants.
On August 29, 2002, GM closed its Boisbriand car assembly plant, the only one in Quebec.
The opening of the first businesses in the Faubourg Boisbriand. built on the former site of the plant began in 2007. There are several stores (food, decoration and furniture, pet stores, fashion, financial services, personal care and beauty, sports), big box chains (Costco, Staples (operating in Quebec as &quot;Bureau en gros&quot;), Dollarama and Toys &quot;R&quot; Us) as well as several restaurants and bars. The site also houses residential buildings on the west side. At the beginning of 2021, there were 1,250 housing units. An additional 600 units are planned over the next few years.

== Hasidic Jewish community ==
The Hasidic community of Kiryas Tosh is located within the city limits and make up a 10th of its population. The community of about 550 households or about 3,200 people was home to the former Tosher Rebbe, Meshulim Feish (Ferencz) Lowy, who established the community in 1964.

== Demographics ==
In the 2021 Census of Population conducted by Statistics Canada, Boisbriand had a population of living in of its total private dwellings, a change of from its 2016 population of . With a land area of , it had a population density of in 2021.

==Sports==
Boisbriand is home to the Blainville-Boisbriand Armada of the Quebec Maritimes Junior Hockey League. The Armada play their home games at Centre d&#x27;Excellence Sports Rousseau.

The city promotes several sports teams of different categories like minor hockey, aquatic club, athletics club, fencing, karate, synchronized swimming, figure skating.

<doc id="732550" wikidata="Q472330" url="?curid=732550" title="Howard Schultz">
<text>Howard D. Schultz (born July 19, 1953) is an American businessman and author who was the chairman and chief executive officer of Starbucks from 1986 to 2000, from 2008 to 2017, and interim CEO from 2022 to 2023. Schultz owned the Seattle SuperSonics basketball team from 2001 to 2006.

Schultz began working at Starbucks in 1982. He later left and opened Il Giornale, a specialty coffeeshop that merged with Starbucks during the late 1980s. Under Schultz, the company established a large network of stores which has influenced coffee culture in Seattle, the U.S., and internationally. Following large-scale distribution deals, Starbucks became the largest coffee-house chain in the world. Schultz took the company public in 1992 and used a $271 million valuation to double their store count in a series of highly publicized coffee wars. He stepped down as CEO in 2000, succeeded by Orin Smith. Due to the rapid expansion of Starbucks under Schultz&#x27;s leadership, he has been described as the “Ray Kroc of his generation”.

During the 2008 financial crisis, Schultz returned as chief executive. Succeeding Jim Donald, Schultz led a mass firing of executives and employees and shuttered hundreds of stores. He orchestrated multiple acquisitions of American and Chinese beverage companies, introduced a national loyalty program, and enforced fair trade standards. His aggressive expansion in Chinese markets has been credited with reconciling the country&#x27;s tea-culture with coffee consumption in China. Schultz was succeeded by Kevin Johnson as CEO in April 2017 and Myron Ullman as chairman in June 2018.

Schultz has written four books on business. He is an outspoken neoliberal. Schultz publicly considered a candidacy in the 2012, 2016, and 2020 U.S. presidential elections as an independent candidate. He declined to join all three contests. His positions on domestic politics are socially liberal and fiscally moderate. In foreign policy, he is seen as a &quot;liberal hawk&quot;, favoring American-led international affairs and neoliberalism. Schultz was named the 209th-richest person in the U.S. by &quot;Forbes&quot; with a net worth of $4.3 billion (October 2020). Schultz started the Schultz Family Foundation to help military veterans and fight youth unemployment.

On March 16, 2022, Starbucks announced that CEO Kevin Johnson was retiring and that Howard Schultz would take over as interim CEO until Laxman Narasimhan took over as CEO in April 2023. On March 20, 2023, Schultz announced that he would be stepping down early from the position.

== Early life and education ==
Howard D. Schultz was born on July 19, 1953, to Ashkenazi Jewish parents, Fred and Elaine Schultz, in Brooklyn, New York. His father was a truck driver while his mother was a receptionist. Howard has two siblings. Schultz grew up in the Canarsie public housing projects. According to Schultz, his family was poor, although childhood contemporaries recount a middle-class upbringing, with one of his contemporaries referring to the development in which he was raised as &quot;the country club of projects.&quot;

Schultz spent his time after school at the Boys Club of New York. He is active in the Boys’ Club of New York&#x27;s Alumni.

Schultz graduated from Canarsie High School in 1971. He attended Northern Michigan University (NMU) from 1971 to 1975, where he was a member of Tau Kappa Epsilon fraternity, graduating with a B.A. in communications. He had played football, expecting an athletic scholarship but an injury caused him to quit.

==Career==

=== Early career ===
In 1976, he became a salesman for Xerox in New York. In 1979, he was recruited by French private equity firm PAI Partners in 1979 to be general manager of a Swedish kitchenware manufacturer&#x27;s U.S. subsidiary, Hammarplast. At Hammarplast, Schultz was responsible for the coffee machine manufacturer&#x27;s U.S. operations, and in 1981 he visited the Starbucks Coffee Company in Seattle to fill their plastic cone filter orders.

=== Starbucks ===

In 1982, at age 29, Schultz was hired at Starbucks as the director of retail operations and marketing. Schultz was exposed to coffee in Italy on a buying trip to Milan, Italy, in 1983. On his return, he worked to persuade company owners Jerry Baldwin and Gordon Bowker to offer traditional espresso beverages in addition to the whole bean coffee, leaf teas, and spices. After a successful pilot of the cafe concept, Baldwin and Bowker were intrigued but, noting the high cost of espresso machines, the relative paucity of expertise for maintenance and repair of the machines in America, and Americans&#x27; lack of familiarity with the drink, they decided not to deploy Schultz&#x27;s idea further and he stepped down from Starbucks to start his own business. Schultz left Starbucks in 1985 to open a store of his own. He needed $400,000 to start his business. Schultz visited over 500 espresso bars in Milan and, with him assuming most of the risk associated with introducing espresso to the American market, Starbucks invested $150,000 in the new venture, with Baldwin receiving a place on its board and Bowker offering unofficial assistance. Another $100,000 investment came from local doctor Ron Margolis. Of the 242 investors Schultz approached, 217 rejected his idea. By 1986, he had raised the money he needed to open the first store, Il Giornale, named after the Milanese newspaper of the same name. The store offered ice cream in addition to coffee, had little seating, and played opera music in the background. Two years later, the original Starbucks management team decided to focus on Peet&#x27;s Coffee &amp; Tea and sold its Starbucks retail unit to Schultz and Il Giornale for US$3.8 million.

Schultz rebranded Il Giornale with the Starbucks name, and expanded its reach across the United States. This type of market strategy received mixed reception from both customers and competitors. The firm&#x27;s relations with independent coffeehouse chains were strained, while some owners credited Starbucks with educating customers on coffee. Schultz did not believe in franchising, and made a point of having Starbucks retain ownership of every domestic outlet. Schultz&#x27;s positioning of Starbucks as a social hub is widely seen as introducing the second wave of coffee culture in the U.S., particularly in Seattle. On June 26, 1992, Starbucks had its initial public offering (IPO) and trading of its common stock under the stock ticker SBUX. The IPO raised $271 million for the company and financed the doubling of their stores. On June 1, 2000, Schultz stepped down as CEO of Starbucks, moving to the new position of chief global strategist to help the company expand internationally. He was succeeded by Orin Smith, who worked with Schultz as his chief financial officer during the 1990s. After coordinating the first store opening in China in January 1999, Schultz took the following year to develop a customer base for coffee in the region. Throughout the late-2000s and early-2010s, Schultz directed the company to plan one to two store openings a day in mainland China. Back in the firm&#x27;s U.S. market, various coffee wars with McDonalds and Dunkin&#x27; lowered Starbucks&#x27; marketshare and the stock price fell 75% from 2006 to 2008. While revenue was growing broadly, it was largely dependent on new store openings creating unsustainable (or inorganic) growth.
On January 7, 2008, after an eight-year hiatus, Schultz returned as CEO of Starbucks during the height of the 2008 financial crisis. He succeeded Jim Donald who took over from Smith in 2005. The coffeehouse was increasingly criticized for employee work conditions and their internal tipping policies during this time; in March 2009, he and the board approved a $100 million settlement in back tips in a barista-led class action lawsuit in California. He led a mass-firing of executives, closed down hundreds of stores, and temporarily closed all U.S. locations to retrain employees in making espresso. Schultz redoubled and enforced the firm&#x27;s fair trade and ethical source policies for their coffee bean supply-chain in Africa and other coffee-producing countries. In the succeeding two years, he doubled their annual purchase of fair trade coffee, up to, by some estimates, 40 million pounds. Schultz arranged the appointment of the coffeehouse&#x27;s first chief technology officer. At this time, Schultz was earning a total compensation of $9.7 million, which included a base salary of $1.2 million, and stock options granted of $7.8 million. In addition to his board membership with Starbucks, Schultz was an early and significant stakeholder in Jamba Juice in 2011, and on the board of payment processing company, Square, Inc., until 2014. During the summer of 2014, Schultz launched the Starbucks College Achievement Plan, a partnership with Arizona State University, which allows all employees at Starbucks working 20 or more hours a week to qualify for free tuition through ASU&#x27;s online courses. It was reported in 2018 that Schultz had taken a one-dollar annual salary sometime in the past couple of years.

Schultz again stepped down as CEO in December 2016, assuming the position of executive chairman. From 2008 to 2017, Schultz oversaw nearly $100 billion added to the company&#x27;s market capitalization. From the 1980s to his retirement, a series of coffee wars increased Starbucks from 11 coffeehouses in Seattle to 28,000 stores in 77 countries. On June 4, 2018, Schultz announced that he would retire from active management of Starbucks after 37 years, as he was considering amongst other options a campaign for U.S. president. Kevin Johnson, the firm&#x27;s president and chief operating officer for the previous two years, succeeded Schultz as CEO while Myron Ullman took over as chairman in June 2018. Schultz would return to the role of CEO in an interim position following Johnson departing the position in March 2022.
 On March 20, 2023, two weeks before he was projected to turn the leadership of the company over to incoming CEO Laxman Narasimhan, Schultz stepped down as interim CEO of Starbucks. Schultz appeared before the United States Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions on March 29, 2023.

===Seattle SuperSonics and Seattle Storm===

In January 2001, Schultz led a group of ten investors who bought the National Basketball Association&#x27;s Seattle SuperSonics and the Women&#x27;s National Basketball Association&#x27;s Seattle Storm from the Ackerley Group for $200 million. During his tenure as the SuperSonics team owner, he was criticized for his naïveté and propensity to run the franchise as a business rather than a sports team. Schultz feuded with player Gary Payton, feeling that Payton disrespected him and the team by not showing up to the first day of training camp in 2002. In February 2006, he stated that the SuperSonics needed $200 million to renovate KeyArena or build a new arena for the team, and if the Washington State Legislature would not approve this, he would look to sell or move the team. On July 18, 2006, Schultz sold the team to Clay Bennett, chairman of the Professional Basketball Club LLC, an Oklahoma City ownership group, for $350 million, after having failed to convince the city of Seattle to provide public funding to build a new arena in the Greater Seattle area to replace KeyArena. At the time of the team&#x27;s sale, it was speculated that the new owners would move the team to their city some time after the 2006–2007 NBA season.

Schultz filed a lawsuit against Bennett – in April 2008 – to rescind the July 2006 sale based on what Schultz claimed was fraud and intentional misrepresentation. However, Schultz dropped the lawsuit in August 2008. When Bennett purchased the SuperSonics and its sister franchise in the WNBA, the Seattle Storm, for $350 million, he agreed to a stipulation that he would make a &quot;good-faith best effort&quot; for one year to keep both teams in Seattle. The sincerity of the good-faith effort was widely disputed by the way Bennett acted and by direct quotes from his partner Aubrey McClendon. On January 8, 2008, Bennett sold the Storm to Force 10 Hoops, LLC, an ownership group of four Seattle women, which kept the team in Seattle. On July 2, 2008, the city of Seattle reached a settlement with the new ownership group and the SuperSonics moved to Oklahoma City and became the Thunder for the 2008–09 NBA season. The sale to the out-of-state owners considerably damaged Schultz&#x27;s popularity in Seattle. In a local newspaper poll, Schultz was judged &quot;most responsible&quot; for the team leaving the city. Ten years later, in 2019, Schultz accepted full responsibility for the sale. &quot;Selling the Sonics as I did is one of the biggest regrets of my professional life. I should have been willing to lose money until a local buyer emerged. I am forever sorry.&quot;

==Author==

Schultz has written four books, three of which incorporate business memoir-style narratives. According to the Free Library of Philadelphia, his books are known to be a blend of &quot;part memoir and part manifesto of corporate social responsibility&quot;. At the start of 2019, Schultz released an online class that covered the business leadership topics discussed in his books on the MasterClass platform. Organizational consultant Warren Bennis has influenced Schultz&#x27;s writing.

His first book, &quot;Pour Your Heart Into It: How Starbucks Built a Company One Cup at a Time&quot; was written in 1997 with Dori Jones Yang. His second book, &quot;Onward: How Starbucks Fought for Its Life Without Losing Its Soul&quot;, co-written with Joanne Gordon, was published in 2011. Jeff Bailey, of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;, called the book &quot;self-flattering&quot; and criticized its &quot;mostly perfunctory account of Starbucks&#x27; actual problems&quot;. &quot;Publishers Weekly&quot; called the book &quot;a personal, suspenseful, and surprisingly open account&quot; of the rise of Starbucks. &quot;Kirkus Reviews&quot; praised the book&#x27;s &quot;immense detail&quot; but critiqued Schultz&#x27;s coverage of &quot;outside criticisms of his performance&quot;. &quot;The Seattle Times&quot; was critical, saying the book could only &quot;appeal to business types but probably not to the average latte drinker&quot;. &quot;Fast Company&quot; placed &quot;Onward&quot; within the top five books that &quot;[predicted] the future of workplace leadership&quot; in 2014. All sale proceeds from the book were donated to the Starbucks Foundation, the firm&#x27;s main charity.

His third book, &quot;For Love of Country: What Our Veterans Can Teach Us About Citizenship, Heroism, and Sacrifice&quot;, co-written with Rajiv Chandrasekaran, was published in 2014. &quot;The New York Times Book Review&quot; calling it &quot;well-written&quot; and &quot;formidable.&quot; It was later added to the &quot;Times&quot;&#x27; 2014 Winter Reading List. In writing a review for &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; U.S. Army major general Robert H. Scales stated &quot;after reading this moving book I&#x27;ll not likely pass a Starbucks again without stopping for a patriotic cup.&quot; &quot;The Washington Post&quot; published a similarly positive review.

In 2019, he published his fourth book, &quot;From the Ground Up: A Journey to Reimagine the Promise of America&quot;. The book was widely seen as a candidate memoir as it was published right before the 2020 United States presidential election. His book received 1.9/5 stars on Amazon, after some Democratic voters gave negative reviews, due his possible candidacy splitting the Democratic vote. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; called the book &quot;stunningly boring&quot; and an &quot;autobiography of a pretentious oligarch.&quot; A book promotion stop at Harvard University led to a small student protest. &quot;From the Ground Up&quot; was featured on &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot;&#x27;s bestseller list in February, and was listed as a &quot;New York Times&quot; bestseller for 2019. &quot;Reuters&quot; rated the book highly, yet called it &quot;caffeine free&quot; for its inability to &quot;harness his business success&quot; in a potential White House run.

== Political views ==
Schultz is an outspoken neoliberal, centrist, technocratic, and political independent. Schultz&#x27;s political positions are similar to the Democratic Party platform. Schultz supports free trade, a balanced budget, comprehensive tax reform, gun control, and same-sex marriage.

Schultz hosted a fundraiser in his Seattle home for John Edwards during the 2008 presidential election cycle, eventually donating to the campaigns of Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama. Since 2012, Schultz&#x27;s public statements have led to press speculation that he would run for President of the United States. In both the 2008 and 2012 United States presidential election he endorsed the presidential candidacy of Barack Obama. Schultz donated to Barack Obama&#x27;s 2008 presidential campaign twice, once on June 30, 2007, for $2,300, and again on October 24, 2008, for $2,300. He endorsed Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton in the 2016 United States presidential election.

=== Labor unions ===
Howard Schultz has been taking anti-union actions at Starbucks since the late 1980s. When unions were able to form at the company, they disbanded soon afterward, due to corporate reaction to their formation.

In 2009, a bill known as the Employee Free Choice Act was being proposed in Congress. It would allow unions to form by simply gathering a majority of signatures in the workplace, what is known as a &quot;card check&quot;, obviating the need to have secret ballot union-elections. Schultz, along with the CEOs of Costco, and Whole Foods lobbied to have this provision removed from the bill, and a provision making it easier for unions to secure their first bargaining agreement. The Employee Free Choice Act never made it into law.

Schultz&#x27;s overall vision on unions, and their place at Starbucks were published in a 2012 edition of his memoir entitled &quot;Pour Your Heart Into It: How Starbucks Built a Company One Cup at a Time&quot;. Schultz wrote, &quot;I was convinced that under my leadership, employees would come to realize that I would listen to their concerns. If they had faith in me and my motives, they wouldn&#x27;t need a union.&quot;

In 2022, as union organizing campaigns started to form at Starbucks, and gain victories, Schultz held a town hall meeting as he returned to the company as interim CEO. In the town hall Schultz said that Starbucks was &quot;under assault from unionization&quot;, &quot;outside forces&quot;, and that Starbucks did not need an intermediary between management, and labor. During these union organizing campaigns by Starbucks employees, the corporation has been firing employees who have engaged in unionizing. One employee who had been working to organize Starbucks workers in Arizona was fired just one hour after Schultz had finished speaking at his town hall. These terminations took place despite a notice of formal complaint from the National Labor Relations Board against the retaliatory practices Starbucks had taken against employees who were working to unionize the corporation.

On March 29, 2023, Schultz testified before the United States Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions. In response to most of the questions Schultz gave the same answer: &quot;I support the law, and I also take offense with you categorizing me or Starbucks as a union buster when that is not true.&quot;

During the hearing Sen. Bernie Sanders asked Schultz whether he would follow the ruling of NLRB administrative law judge Michael Rosas. Rosas had found that Starbucks had engaged in “egregious and widespread misconduct” in dealing with the unionizing efforts of its employees in Buffalo. As a result of these findings he ruled that the company must reinstate the employees they had fired, and Schultz must either read to his employees a letter informing them of their rights or be present for a meeting in which workers are informed of their rights. Schultz responded that he would not be following this ruling as he believed that Starbucks had not broken the law.

=== Climate change ===
As chief executive of Starbucks, Schultz has commented on the impact climate change has on coffee production. He has opposed the United States withdrawal from the Paris Agreement. To finance a green economy, he has advocated for a combination of taxing oil and gas as well as harnessing wind energy. Schultz has openly criticized the 2018 Green New Deal for being economically unrealistic.

=== Bipartisanship ===
In December 2012 Schultz penned an open letter to various newspapers about an upcoming initiative at Starbucks involving partisan gridlock in Washington. On December 27, Starbucks employees in Washington were asked to write &quot;come together&quot; on all cups distributed, to encourage bipartisanship in the federal government. During his exploratory 2020 presidential campaign, Schultz explained to multiple media outlets that, if elected, he wished to exclusively legislate with bipartisan support. This stance includes the appointment and confirmations of U.S. Supreme Court justices.

=== Fiscal discipline ===
Schultz is averse to debt and, politically, is a deficit hawk. During his 2019 exploratory bid for the presidency, Schultz framed his candidacy as that of a socially liberal deficit hawk with fiscally moderate leanings. In June 2018, Schultz stated in an interview that he thought the national debt is &quot;the greatest threat domestically to the country&quot; and that &quot;we have to go after entitlements.&quot; He has also stated that the nation&#x27;s annual sovereign interest payments, totaling over $400 billion in 2020, is &quot;unsustainable.&quot; President Barack Obama&#x27;s chief economist, Jason Furman, was critical of Schultz&#x27;s hard-lined &quot;obsessive&quot; position against sovereign debt: &quot;America is not a company.&quot; Furman stated in February 2020, &quot;many successful companies are much more leveraged than the United States.&quot;

=== Trade ===
Throughout the 2018 start and continuation of the U.S. trade war against China, Schultz has been critical of its motivations and handling, and has called for a reduction of trade tariffs and other import-export taxes.

In 2008, Schultz doubled the amount of fair trade coffee Starbucks bought. By the end of 2009, 65% of all coffee product was fair trade and by 2015, nearly all of it was. Starbucks signed an agreement with the government of Ethiopia in 2007 to ensure increased pay to farmers. Schultz committed to an agreement that all 747 stores in Britain would be certified fair trade by year-end. The agreement made Starbucks the largest buyer of fair trade coffee.

=== Business ===
Schultz claims to be a supporter of the free market. In 2020 he described the treatment of business and capitalism by American society as &quot;vilification&quot;. During the COVID-19 pandemic (COVID-19), advocated for fiscal stimulus to small businesses harmed during the crisis. Schultz described the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act as insufficient, and criticized the Act&#x27;s Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) for being a temporary solution. On April 21, he called for the federal government to institute a &quot;Marshall Plan&quot; for small business, in the form of federally-backed loans.

=== Tax reform ===
Schultz said he supported &quot;comprehensive tax reform&quot; in January 2019. He opposed Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez&#x27;s proposal to raise the marginal tax rate on income over $10 million to 70%, saying it was &quot;punitive&quot; and contrary to the American Dream. He also opposed Donald Trump&#x27;s passage of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, which lowered high-income and corporate taxes. During a &quot;CNN&quot; town hall, he stated that he wanted the marginal tax rate for the highest-earning citizens to be increased from 37% to 39%. Schultz is against lowering taxes for large corporations, favoring tax cuts for middle-market and small businesses.

=== Same-sex marriage ===
Starbucks took an institutional stance in favor of same-sex marriage in 2013 (two years prior to US Federal recognition). In response to a backlash from conservative and religious groups, Schultz told a shareholder meeting that opponents of the stance should &quot;Sell your shares&quot;, and &quot;buy shares in another company.&quot; His response was widely publicized, with &quot;The Washington Post&quot; stating: &quot;Schultz [did] something CEOs rarely do: He told off a shareholder.&quot; &quot;Fortune&quot; wrote that Schultz &quot;[took] on gay marriage before it was a topic most executives would even touch.

=== Healthcare ===
Under his leadership Starbucks became the first U.S. company to offer part-time workers, particularly baristas, healthcare. Schultz is against Medicare for All. He has vocally criticized Republican-led efforts to repeal the ACA as uncooperative.

=== Gun control ===
Schultz supports gun control and universal background checks. In July 2013, Starbucks customers brought in their weapons and guns into local stores to show appreciation for the coffeehouse&#x27;s support of the Second Amendment. Later in September, as CEO, Schultz asked customers to no longer bring guns into its stores.

=== Immigration ===
Schultz has supported a pathway to citizenship for illegal immigrants who had entered the U.S. as children. He called for greater border security, but vocally opposed President Donald Trump&#x27;s proposal of a border wall. In 2017, Schultz got into a highly publicized argument with President Trump after he instructed Starbucks to disregard an executive order barring Syrian refugees into the country. Within 24 hours of the executive order, Schultz wrote to his employees that recent immigrants and refugees, particularly those with strong ties to the U.S. military, would be fast-tracked to employment. President Trump then called on his supporters to boycott Starbucks.

=== Veterans&#x27; affairs ===
In 2015, Schultz founded Onward Veterans, a private foundation to help post-9/11 military veterans transition to civilian life. In 2014, Schultz authored his first non-business book, &quot;For Love of Country: What Our Veterans Can Teach Us About Citizenship, Heroism, and Sacrifice&quot;, co-written with Rajiv Chandrasekaran. The book discussed the U.S. military&#x27;s role in the Iraq War and War in Afghanistan, and their transitions back into civilian life. To market the book he expanded tuition support for veterans families.

Over a radio interview in March 2019, when asked if he would be an effective commander-in-chief, Schultz responded: &quot;I probably have spent more time in the last decade certainly than anyone running for president with the military.&quot; His comments were criticized by Pete Buttigieg and Tulsi Gabbard, both of whom served in the military, for being tone deaf. Schultz later apologized for his remarks. Schultz&#x27;s tentative 2020 presidential candidacy was endorsed by former U.S. Army General Peter W. Chiarelli.

=== Washington state politics ===
In 2012, Schultz had Starbucks express support for Washington state&#x27;s Referendum 74, which legalized same-sex marriage in that state. Schultz opposed Seattle&#x27;s ordinance to raise the local minimum wage to $15, which at the time was the highest in the nation. The ordinance passed.

From 2005 to 2019, he reportedly voted in 11 of 38 municipal elections. His voting record in Seattle has been described by &quot;The Seattle Times&quot; as a &quot;pattern of ignoring many local elections over the decades.&quot; The paper reported in 2020 that while Schultz is heavily involved in the state&#x27;s political debates, he often &quot;doesn&#x27;t show up to vote&quot; in various municipal elections including that of the city&#x27;s mayor and city council. Washington governor Jay Inslee, who was running against Schultz in the 2020 election, criticized him for his absence in state politics.

Congressman George Nethercutt, a moderate Republican, opined that Eastern Washington &quot;may like what they hear and vote for [Schultz]&quot; more than the Western region.

=== Foreign policy ===
Schultz has been described as a foreign policy &quot;liberal hawk&quot;, favoring socially liberal politics domestically and aggressive, interventionist policies abroad. Generally, he is a supporter of neoliberal institutionalism and international cooperation. In line with this, Schultz advocates for a U.S.-centered unipolar world where countries work with America to ensure stability and peace.

*United Kingdom: During the 2009 economic crisis, Schultz stated in a highly publicized interview with CNBC that &quot;the place that concerns us the most is western Europe, and specifically the UK. The UK is in a spiral&quot;. His comments were meant to express concern with the levels of unemployment and consumer confidence in the United Kingdom. The British Business Secretary at the time, Peter Mandelson, responded negatively to the statement saying that &quot;the UK was not spiralling, although I&#x27;ve noticed Starbucks is in a great deal of trouble.&quot; Mandelson later suggested that Schultz was projecting his own company&#x27;s trouble in the United Kingdom onto the wider national economy. Starbucks issued an office apology soon thereafter.
*Syria: Schultz criticized the U.S. military withdrawal from Syria in 2019, saying the move had &quot;damaged America&#x27;s relationships with foreign allies.&quot; Furthermore, Schultz lamented the &quot;power vacuum&quot; left by the U.S. in the Middle East as a result of their withdrawal. He supported the idea of leaving a skeletal army force in the region to ensure a minimum level of stability and U.S. influence.
*Russia: He is a vocal opponent of Russian influence in U.S. politics, calling the country an “enemy of the United States.”
*China: The commensurate rise of China in the international sphere with the U.S. prompted Schultz to call the country &quot;neither an enemy nor an ally, but a fierce competitor.&quot; According to &quot;Foreign Policy&quot;, his corporate interests in Starbucks could make him implement pro-Chinese policies and legislation. Hedge fund manager Bill Ackman similarly said that Schultz&#x27;s election to the U.S. presidency would essentially be an insurance policy for Starbucks. &quot;The last thing the Chinese would do is go after the next American president&#x27;s company,&quot; Ackman told the &quot;New York Times&quot; in 2020. Schultz has repeatedly praised the country&#x27;s One Belt Road initiative, an infrastructure plan aimed at better connecting territorial China and improving foreign direct investment.
*Israel: Schultz was involved in a long-standing group chat from October 2023 through early May 2024 with some of the United States&#x27; most powerful business leaders with the stated goals of &quot;chang[ing] the narrative&quot; in favor of Israel and &quot;help[ing] win the war&quot; on U.S. public opinion following Hamas&#x27;s October 7th attack on Israel. Group members included Dell founder and CEO Michael Dell, Kind snack company founder Daniel Lubetzky, hedge fund managers Daniel Loeb and Bill Ackman, billionaire Len Blavatnik, real estate investor Joseph Sitt, and Joshua Kushner, the founder of Thrive Capital and brother to Jared Kushner, former president Donald Trump&#x27;s son-in-law. The group also included non-American citizens, such as Cypriot-Israeli billionaire real estate investor Yakir Gabay. Members of the group chat, including Schultz, discussed how they received private briefings by, and worked closely with, members of the Israeli government, including former Israeli prime minister Naftali Bennett; Benny Gantz, a member of the Israeli war cabinet; and Israel&#x27;s ambassador to the United States, Michael Herzog. Group members also held a video call in April 2024 with New York City Mayor Eric Adams in an effort to, according to reporting by The Washington Post, &quot;pressure Columbia’s president and trustees to permit the mayor to send police to the campus&quot; to shut down criticism of Israel&#x27;s offensive military operations in Gaza, which many campus protesters, intergovernmental and non-governmental organizations, civil servants, and governments around the world have alleged to be genocide. During the video call, group members discussed making political donations to Adams. It is unknown whether Schultz was present on the video call. While Schultz confirmed his membership in the group and his presence at private briefings by Israeli officials, a spokesperson said he &quot;did not participate in, or contribute financially to, any of the group&#x27;s work.&quot;

== Political elections ==
=== 2012 presidential election ===
At the start of the 2012 United States presidential election Schultz&#x27;s name was floated as a potential Democratic candidate. After he instructed Starbucks employees in Washington to write &quot;come together&quot; on all cups to encourage bipartisanship in the federal government on December 26, press speculation intensified. However, Schultz &quot;batted down&quot; these reports days later and confirmed that he was not running for political office. He continued to publicly bemoan the political climate at the time, saying he was &quot;not optimistic about the leadership&quot; of the U.S. on national television. Papers continued to question the finality of his decision with &quot;New York Magazine&quot; writing &quot;We look forward to your 2016 campaign&quot;.

=== 2016 presidential election ===
In late September and early August 2015, press speculation began to surface about a potential run in the upcoming 2016 United States presidential election for Schultz. Maureen Dowd, of &quot;The New York Times&quot;, broke a story on August 1 that friends of &quot;America&#x27;s lord of latte, Howard Schultz, have been pressing him to join the Democratic primary.&quot; Over the next couple of days media outlets began to speculate if Schultz was going to make a formal announcement. According to &quot;Fortune&quot;, he was positioned to be a &quot;worthy party back-up to [Hillary] Clinton.&quot; Schultz wrote a &quot;New York Times&quot; op-ed on August 6, 2015, denying this, stating, &quot;Despite the encouragement of others, I have no intention of entering the presidential fray. I&#x27;m not done serving Starbucks.&quot; Newspapers such as &quot;The Atlantic&quot;, billed Schultz as the &quot;liberal Donald Trump&quot; due to his comparable career as a businessman and wealth.

=== 2020 presidential election ===
After Schultz stepped down from Starbucks in 2018, political commentators speculated whether he would run in the 2020 United States presidential election. There was additional encouragement from a draft movement called Ready for Schultz. He hired Steve Schmidt and Bill Burton, two political consultants, to assess his candidacy. On January 27, 2019, he stated in an interview with &quot;60 Minutes&quot; that he was exploring a run for president as an independent candidate, and that he considered running as a centrist. He was reportedly willing to spend $300 to $500 million on the 2020 election. Schultz&#x27;s proposed independent candidacy was widely condemned by Democrats who argued that Schultz&#x27;s third-party candidacy would help to re-elect President Trump by splitting the vote of those opposed to the president. Political scientist Larry Sabato said that Schultz&#x27;s candidacy was likely to benefit Trump. However, a &quot;CNN&quot; analysis believed that &quot;running on a deficit-reduction platform might end up syphoning as many Republican moderates away from Trump as liberals or independents away from the Democratic nominee.&quot; In response to claims that his candidacy would benefit Trump, Schultz said, &quot;Nobody wants to see Donald Trump removed from office more than me.&quot; His first town hall in Seattle received mixed reception with protestors holding up &quot;venti mistake&quot; and &quot;grande ego&quot; banners while his actual speech was well received. As a large shareholder of Starbucks stock, Schultz was repeatedly asked about potentially selling all of his holdings if elected to the White House. &quot;There&#x27;s multiple ways to do this, set up a blind trust, do lots of things to remove any conflict of interest&quot; he replied. He had, however, promised to release all of his tax returns if elected.

Later in February, Schultz said he would stay out of the race if the Democrats nominated &quot;a centrist Democrat.&quot; In May 2019, Schultz delayed his decision and by September 6, officially ruled out a presidential run, stating that it wasn&#x27;t the best way to &quot;serve our country at this time.&quot; The eventual progression of candidate Joe Biden as the presumptive nominee motivated Schultz to step aside due to their overlapping political ideologies. While he had not officially endorsed Biden for the presidency at the time, Schultz had stated in interviews that he &quot;admires&quot; the candidate. However, on September 14, 2020, Schultz endorsed Biden, and called on Americans to vote for Biden &quot;for the future of our republic&quot;.

==Personal life==
In 1982, Schultz married Sheri Kersch, with whom he has two children. His son, Jordan, is a sports analyst and NFL insider currently working for Bleacher Report. They live in Seattle&#x27;s Madison Park neighborhood, having previously lived near Madrona. Schultz is a noted coffee aficionado, reportedly drinking four to five cups of coffee every day.

=== Wealth ===
Schultz was named the 209th-richest person in the U.S. in October 2020 by &quot;Forbes&quot; with a net worth of $4.3 billion. His exploration of running for political office has prompted calls for him to sell all of his stock holdings in Starbucks to appease any conflict of interest. Although not firmly committing to sell his shares upon election, Schultz has expressed interest in setting up a blind trust to hold his shares. However, &quot;Foreign Policy&quot; noted that even if in a blind trust, his interest in the shares could still prompt a conflict of interest in because the shares&#x27; performance is linked with the company&#x27;s performance. In 1998, Schultz established venture capital firm Maveron with investment banker Dan Levitan. He and Levitan primarily invest in start-up companies and seeding consumer-focused companies, such as eBay, Shutterfly, and Zulily. As of July 2014, the venture capital firm was worth $1.3 billion in assets under management (AUM). As of July 2022, Schultz&#x27;s net worth is US$3.9 billion.

Schultz is the owner of &#x27;PI&#x27;, a 77-metre luxury superyacht built by Feadship for $120 million.

=== Philanthropy ===

In 1996, Howard and Sheri Schultz co-founded the Schultz Family Foundation, which supports Onward Youth, aimed at promoting employment for young people between the ages of 16 and 24 who are not in school and not working, and Onward Veterans, which is poised to help post-9/11 military veterans to successfully transition to civilian life.

=== Awards and honors ===
In 1998, Schultz received the &#x27;Israel 50th Anniversary Tribute Award&#x27; for &quot;playing a key role in promoting a close alliance between the United States and Israel&quot;. In 1999 AIDs Action awarded Schultz the National Leadership Award for philanthropic and educational efforts to battle AIDS. Schultz was named &quot;Fortune&quot; magazine&#x27;s 2011 &quot;Businessperson of the Year&quot; for his initiatives in the economy and job market. &quot;Fortune&quot; went on to list him as the most generous CEO of 2015, for Starbucks&#x27; healthcare coverage, educational opportunities, and employee stock options.

Schultz spoke at the 2017 Arizona State University commencement ceremony and was presented with an honorary Doctor of humane letters degree. In November 2017, the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund presented Schultz with the National Equal Justice Award.

<doc id="732569" wikidata="Q8020191" url="?curid=732569" title="William Wentworth, 2nd Earl of Strafford">
<text>William Wentworth, 2nd Earl of Strafford (8 June 1626 – 16 October 1695), KG, of Wentworth Woodhouse in Yorkshire, was a prominent landowner.

==Origins==
He was born at Wentworth Woodhouse, the only surviving son of Thomas Wentworth, 1st Earl of Strafford (d.1641) by his second wife Arabella Holles, a daughter of John Holles, 1st Earl of Clare. His mother died in childbirth when he was five years old, after which his father remarried to Elizabeth Rhodes, who was a kindly stepmother to William and his sisters.

==Career==
He studied at Trinity College Dublin. When his father was executed for treason in 1641, William left England for several years, mainly for fear of reprisals (although most of his father&#x27;s enemies bore no ill-will to his widow or children), and lived for a while in France. He is said to have acted as a Royalist agent in Germany and Denmark, in partnership with Henry Coventry, which ended in a bitter quarrel, and a duel.

In 1652 he was allowed to return to England on taking an oath of abjuration. In 1662 the bill of attainder against his father was reversed by Parliament, and he regained the title of Earl of Strafford and was invested as a Knight of the Garter in 1661. He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1668 but was expelled in 1685.

He led a rather &quot;obscure, undistinguished and uninteresting life&quot;, however his 1667 speech in the House of Lords was praiseworthy, protesting against the banishment of Edward Hyde, 1st Earl of Clarendon, on the grounds that no crime had been proved against him; his attitude is the more creditable since Clarendon had been one of his father&#x27;s bitterest enemies. He became a member of the Privy Council in 1674, and attended the crucial meeting in 1678 when Titus Oates first revealed his fabricated Popish Plot. During the Exclusion Crisis he supported the future King James II, and made a point of calling on him when James travelled through Yorkshire on his way to Scotland in 1679.

He may be summed up as &quot;rather indolent and lacking in character&quot;, but was much loved by his family, especially by his father, whose last letter was to &quot;dearest Will&quot; from &quot;a father that tenderly loves you&quot;.

==Marriages==
He married twice:
*Firstly on 27 February 1654 to Lady Henrietta Mary Stanley, a daughter of James Stanley, 7th Earl of Derby by his wife Charlotte de La Trémoille (d. 1685), a daughter of Claude de La Trémoille, 2nd Duke of Thouars, by his wife Countess Charlotte Brabantina of Nassau, 2nd daughter of William I, Prince of Orange (1533-1584), great-grandfather of King William III of England. The marriage was childless and Henrietta predeceased him. There were riots associated with her funeral. She was buried in York Minster, where he erected an impressive monument to her memory, which still stands.
*Secondly, he married Henrietta de la Rochefoucauld, a daughter of Frederic Charles de Roye de la Rochefoucauld, Count de Roye. The Dowager Countess was buried at St James, Westminster, London, on 14 November 1732.

==Death and legacy==
He died in Yorkshire on 16 October 1695, aged 69, and was buried in York Minster.

Strafford County, New Hampshire in the United States is named in his honour.

==Succession==
Having no children nor surviving brothers, the earldom became extinct, but his title of Baron Raby was inherited by his first cousin once-removed Thomas Wentworth, 1st Earl of Strafford (1672-1739), the grandson of a younger brother of the 1st Earl, who became Earl of Strafford in a new creation. His vast estates, however, including Wentworth Woodhouse, passed to his younger nephew Thomas Watson, the third son of his sister Anne Wentworth, who in accordance with the bequest adopted the additional surname of Wentworth.

<doc id="732574" wikidata="Q7165236" url="?curid=732574" title="Pentadic numerals">
<text>Pentadic numerals () are a notation for presenting numbers, usually by inscribing in wood or stone. The notation has been used in Scandinavia, usually in conjunction with runic calendars and inscriptions in runes.

== Notation ==

The notation is similar to the older Roman numerals for numbers 1 to 9 (I, II, III, IV, V, VI, VII, VIII, IX). Unlike the Roman notation, there are only symbols for numbers one (&quot;I&quot;) and five (&quot;U&quot;), protruding off the side of a vertical stroke, or stem, which has no numeric value by itself. In some inscriptions the notches are placed horizontally on a vertical stem or &quot;stav&quot; of the rune; on other inscriptions the stave is horizontal and the &quot;I&quot; and inverted &quot;U&quot; rise off of it.

The number 4 is represented by four vertical lines on the horizontal stem, 5 is represented by what looks like a half-turned letter U, resembling the letter &quot;P&quot; in combination with the stem. 10 is represented by two turned U&#x27;s opposing each other. More numbers up to 19 or 20, can be represented by a combination of I&#x27;s and U&#x27;s branching off of a stem, similar to how Roman numerals are represented by combinations of I&#x27;s and V&#x27;s.

== Dating and extent of use ==
The widest use of the notation is in presenting the Golden Numbers, 1–19 on Runic calendars (, , , also known as &quot;clogs&quot;). The numbers are commonly found in Modern Age and possibly Early Modern Age calendar sticks. It is unknown if they were in use in the Middle Ages, let alone in the Viking Age. On older runic calendars, a different notation for representing the Golden Numbers was used; the 16 runes of Younger Futhark represented the numbers from 1 to 16 and three &quot;ad hoc&quot;, runes were improvised for the numbers 17, 18, and 19. For example, the &quot;Computus Runicus&quot; manuscript, originally from 1328, but collected and published by the Dane Ole Worm (1588–1654), uses this futhark notation, and not the pentadic numerals under discussion here.

== Positional notation ==
In some peculiar instances runic numbers have been used as numerals in a base ten positional system, replacing the Arabic numerals. It is unknown if this use existed before the 19th century.

The oldest authenticated use of this notation is in the notes of an 18 year-old journeyman tailor, Edward Larsson, that are dated to 1885 in pentadic runes. A copy of the note was first published by the Institute for Dialectology, Onomastics and Folklore Research in Umeå in 2004.

This positional notation however appears on two unrelated sets of rune stones allegedly discovered in North America. The first is the Kensington Runestone found in 1898; the second are the three Spirit Pond runestones found in 1971. All refer to pre-Columbian Norse exploration of the Americas.

The authors of the North American rune stones do not seem to understand the positional notation or the concept of zero. The rune for 10 is used interchangeably for 0, 10, and &lt;1,0&gt; with little consistency. The &quot;inscription stone&quot; from Spirit Pond contains the sequences &quot;ahr:011&quot; and &quot;ahr:00&quot;, which have been read as &quot;year 1011&quot; and &quot;year 1010&quot; respectively. It is unclear if the notation can represent all numbers unambiguously; for example, it may not be possible to distinguish 1010 from 100.

<doc id="732577" wikidata="Q7533188" url="?curid=732577" title="Sixth Term Examination Paper">
<text>The Sixth Term Examination Papers in Mathematics, often referred to as STEP, is currently a university admissions test for undergraduate courses with significant mathematical content - most notably for Mathematics at the University of Cambridge. Starting from 2024, STEP will be administered by OCR, replacing CAAT, who was responsible for administering STEP in previous years.

Being after the reply date for universities in the UK, STEP is typically taken as part of a conditional offer for an undergraduate place. There are also a small number of candidates who sit STEP as a challenge. The papers are designed to test ability to answer questions similar in style to undergraduate Mathematics.

The official users of STEP in Mathematics at present are the University of Cambridge, Imperial College London, and the University of Warwick. Since the 2025 entry application cycle, the STEP exams have been superseded by the TMUA exam at Imperial College London and the University of Warwick.
Candidates applying to study mathematics at the University of Cambridge are almost always required to take STEP as part of the terms of their conditional offer. In addition, other courses at Cambridge with a large mathematics component, such as Economics and Engineering, occasionally require STEP. Candidates applying to study Mathematics or closely related subjects at the University of Warwick can take STEP as part of their offer. Imperial College London may require it for Computing applicants as well as Mathematics applicants who either did not take MAT or achieved a borderline score in it.

A typical STEP offer for a candidate applying to read mathematics at the University of Cambridge would be at least a grade 1 in both STEP 2 and STEP 3, though - depending on individual circumstances - some colleges may only require a grade 1 in either STEP. Candidates applying to the University of Warwick to read mathematics, or joint subjects such as MORSE, can use a grade 2 from either STEP as part of their offer. Imperial typically requires a grade 2 in STEP 2 and/or STEP 3.

==History==
Before 2003, STEP was available for a wide range of subjects. In 1989, for instance, the full list of subjects offered was: Biology, Chemistry, Economics, English Literature, French, General Studies, Geography, Geology, German, Greek, History, Italian, Latin, Mathematics, Further Mathematics, Music, Physics, Religious Studies, Russian, and Spanish. STEP in Mathematics are the only ones now in use. Two (three prior to the discontinuation of STEP 1 in 2019) STEP in Mathematics are set each year, and are both sat during the school summer examination cycle (usually in June).

==Format==

Until 2019, there were three STEPs: STEP 1, STEP 2 and STEP 3. Since the academic year 2019/20, STEP 1 has been phased out. There was no STEP 1 set in 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and it was later announced that from 2021, STEP 1 would no longer be set, with only STEP 2 and STEP 3 being available. The last STEP 1 was held in 2019.

Candidates may enter for as many as they wish, although this is often dictated by the STEP offers they hold. Each paper offers a selection of questions and there is no restriction on which can be answered. For each paper, candidates have three hours to complete their solutions. Whilst students are permitted to answer as many questions as they choose, they are advised to attempt no more than six, and their final grade is based on their six best question solutions. Each question is worth 20 marks, and so the maximum a candidate can score is 120.

For examinations up to and including the 2018 papers, the specification for STEP 1 and STEP 2 was based on Mathematics A Level content while the syllabus for STEP 3 was based on Further Mathematics A Level. The questions on STEP 2 and 3 were about the same difficulty. Both STEP 2 and STEP 3 are harder than STEP 1.

For the 2019 examinations onwards, the specifications have been updated to reflect the reforms in A Level Mathematics and Further Mathematics; in addition, the number of questions in each paper has been reduced. Specifically:
* The STEP 1 specification was based on A Level Mathematics, with some additions and modifications. The paper comprised 11 questions: 8 pure, and 3 further questions on mechanics and probability/statistics, with at least one question of the 3 on mechanics and at least one on probability/statistics. The June 2019 paper was the only STEP 1 paper to be sat under the new syllabus before the retiring of STEP 1.
* The STEP 2 specification is based on A Level Mathematics and AS Level Further Mathematics, with some additions and modifications. The paper comprises 12 questions: 8 pure, 2 mechanics, and 2 probability/statistics.
* The STEP 3 specification is based on A Level Mathematics and A Level Further Mathematics, with some additions and modifications. The paper comprises 12 questions: 8 pure, 2 mechanics, and 2 probability/statistics

==Practicalities==

Since June 2009, graph paper has not been allowed in STEP as the test requires only sketches, not detailed graphs. Instead, all graphs should be sketched inside the answer booklets provided as part of a candidate&#x27;s solution.

Since June 2018, the format of the answer booklet for the STEP Mathematics examinations has been updated to ensure that the paper is fully anonymised before it is marked. Candidates are issued with a 44-page booklet, of which 40 pages are available for writing out solutions and for rough work. Only one booklet per candidate is allowed unless a further booklet is required and has been formally requested as a result of specific access arrangements.

Candidates are advised to write their answers in black ink and draw pictures in pencil, although some flexibility is permitted with this. Candidates should not use green or red pen at any stage.

Calculators may not be used during STEP. Rulers, protractors, and compasses can be taken into the examination. Candidates who don&#x27;t have English as a first language were allowed to use bilingual dictionaries until 2023; these are now no longer permitted.

A formulae booklet was available to all candidates for all examinations up to and including those in 2018. As of 2019, candidates are no longer be issued with a formulae booklet; instead they will be expected to recall, or know how to derive quickly, standard formulae. All the required standard formulae are given in an appendix to the new specification.

==Marking==

STEP is marked by teams of mathematicians specially trained for the purpose. All the markers have Mathematics degrees and most are reading for PhDs at Cambridge. Each question is marked by a small team who coordinate to ensure their question is marked fairly and that all correct solutions are given appropriate marks. Markers are closely supervised by a team of marking supervisors, usually senior teachers, who are responsible for the mark scheme and by a senior Mathematics assessment expert.
All non-crossed-out work is assessed and a candidate&#x27;s final score is based on their six highest scoring solutions. 
All papers are checked at least twice to ensure that all of a candidate&#x27;s non-crossed-out solutions have been assessed. A candidate&#x27;s marks are then independently entered twice into a database to ensure that there are no clerical errors in mark recording. The mark data is then checked a further time by a small team who hand check a random selection of scripts.

==Scoring==
There are five possible grades awarded. From best to worst, these are &#x27;S&#x27; (Outstanding), &#x27;1&#x27;, &#x27;2&#x27;, &#x27;3&#x27;, and &#x27;U&#x27; (Unclassified). The rule of thumb is that four good answers (to a reasonable level of completion) will gain a grade 1; more may gain an S, and fewer will gain a correspondingly lower grade. The grade boundaries shift from year to year, and the boundaries for STEP 3 are generally lower than those for STEP 2.

All STEP questions are marked out of 20. The mark scheme for each question is designed to reward candidates who make good progress towards a solution. A candidate reaching the correct answer will receive full marks, regardless of the method used to answer the question.

All the questions that are attempted by a student and not crossed out will be assessed. However, only the six best answers will be used in the calculation of the final grade for the paper, giving a total maximum mark of 120.

==Timing and results==
STEP is normally sat at a candidate&#x27;s school or college. Alternatively, the test can be taken at any test centre authorised to run STEP. Entries for STEP are typically accepted from the start of March until the end of April and late entries (with late entry fees) accepted until mid-May. STEP is taken in mid-to-late June, with online results available in mid-August, issued on the same date as A Level results, typically at midnight.

==Usage==
There is some variation in how institutions make use of the results – candidates can contact the relevant institution(s) for more information. However, STEP is typically taken post-interview and the results used to supplement candidates&#x27; exam results. For applicants to the University of Cambridge, candidates&#x27; scripts are made available to admissions officers. This enables officers to make judgements on the basis of candidates&#x27; actual work, rather than on just their marks or grade.

==Preparation==
STEP does not require a lot of extra knowledge as they are designed to test skills and knowledge of topics within the A Level syllabus; however, preparation is advised as questions are significantly more challenging than those found in standard A Level examinations. Ideally, students should begin preparation from the summer preceding the academic year of the STEP series they intend to sit.

Practice materials, including past papers, example solutions, and a STEP formula booklet, are available for free from the Cambridge Assessment Admissions Testing website. The STEP support programme provides modules for individual additional study, along with hints and solutions. Furthermore, the book &quot;Advanced Problems in Mathematics: Preparing for University&quot; by Stephen Siklos, a former paper-setter for STEP, has been specifically written for students preparing for it.

<doc id="732578" wikidata="Q142156" url="?curid=732578" title="Sainte-Julie, Quebec">
<text>Sainte-Julie (; originally Sainte-Julie-de-Verchères), is an off-island suburb of Montreal, in southwestern Quebec, Canada, east of Montreal in Marguerite-D&#x27;Youville Regional County Municipality. The population as of the Canada 2021 Census was 30,045. In 2009 Sainte-Julie was called one of the best towns in which to live in Quebec, and the city is often known as &quot;The Happiest City in Quebec&quot; (French: &quot;La ville la plus heureuse du Québec&quot;).

==History==
The territory of Sainte-Julie, was part of the parish of Sainte-Anne-de-Varennes and was informally known as &quot;Grand Coteau&quot;. These settlers mostly came from Boucherville.

Soon residents, finding the Sainte-Anne-de-Varennes parish too far away, asked to establish their own parish in 1843. In 1850 they received authorization and built a church on land belonging to Julie Gauthier dite St-Germain, who asked that the name of the patron Sainte-Julie be given to the parish after Julia of Corsica, a virgin martyr from the fifth century A.D.

On May 6, 1851, a civil proclamation recognized the parish municipality of Sainte-Julie. In the fall of 1851, there were more than 190 families and 1,251 people in Sainte-Julie, according to the federal census.

On July 1, 1885, the municipality of Sainte-Julie was officially created and obtained the right to legally elect, its first mayor, Jules Choquet. The first village school vas built in 1885, located on Rue Principale at the intersection of Boulevard Saint-Joseph.

Disaster struck the municipality in 1929 with the collapse of the upper floor of a grain shed: four people lose their lives.

In the mid-1960s, the construction of the Quebec Autoroute 20 further stimulated the development of Sainte-Julie, which became a rapidly developing suburb south of Montreal. The 1960s were also marked by the protest against the smoke produced by the asphalt plan of the Desourdy company and the damage caused to Mont-Saint-Bruno. Also, in 1968, A CF-100 warplane from the Saint-Hubert ARC base crashes into a house on Rue Félix-Leclerc.

Sainte-Julie gained city status in 1971. The same year, the biggest snowstorm of the century paralyzes part of the city for several days.

The 1980s marks the inauguration of the public transportation system between Sainte-Julie and the Longueuil metro station, giving citizen a direct access to the Montreal transit system. Also, a fire at the PCB (polychlorinated biphenyls) warehouse in Saint-Basile-le-Grand forces the evacuation of part of the population.

==Geography==
Sainte-Julie is located on the south shore of Montréal. The city is well connected to the nearby cities of Montréal and Longueuil by the highways 20 and 30

== Demographics ==
In the 2021 Census of Population conducted by Statistics Canada, Sainte-Julie had a population of living in of its total private dwellings, a change of from its 2016 population of . With a land area of , it had a population density of in 2021.


==Attractions==

Hydro-Quebec&#x27;s electricity interpretation centre, Électrium, is located in Sainte-Julie. La Vallée du Richelieu Golf Club&#x27;s Verchères course is also located in the city.

==Government==
The mayor of Sainte-Julie is Mario Lemay. There are eight city councillors, all of which of members of La voix des citoyens — Équipe Mario Lemay, as of the 2021 Sainte-Julie municipal election.

Sainte-Julie is part of the federal electoral district of Montarville, which is represented by Stéphane Bergeron of the Bloc Québécois. It is also part of the provincial electoral district of Verchères, which is represented by Suzanne Dansereau of the Coalition Avenir Québec.

==Infrastructure==
The Sainte-Julie public transit system provides commuter and local bus services.

Quebec Autoroute 20, Quebec Autoroute 30 and Quebec Route 229 cross the city.

==Education==

Secondary education is provided at the public secondary school of Grand-Côteau.

The South Shore Protestant Regional School Board previously served the municipality.

<doc id="732584" wikidata="Q453529" url="?curid=732584" title="Louis II of Anjou">
<text>Louis II (5 October 1377 – 29 April 1417) was Duke of Anjou and Count of Provence from 1384 to 1417; he claimed the Kingdom of Naples, but only ruled parts of the kingdom from 1390 to 1399. His father, Louis I of Anjouthe founder of the House of Valois-Anjouwas a younger son of King John II of France and the adopted son of Queen Joanna I of Naples. When his father died during a military campaign in Naples in 1384, Louis II was still a child. He inherited Anjou from his father, but his mother, Marie of Blois, could not convince his uncles, John, Duke of Berry and Philip II, Duke of Burgundy, to continue her husband&#x27;s war for Naples. The Provençal nobles and towns refused to acknowledge Louis II as their lawful ruler, but Marie of Blois persuaded them one after another to swear fealty to him between 1385 and 1387.

His cousin, King Charles VI of France decided to support Louis II&#x27;s bid for Naples in 1389. After Antipope Clement VII crowned him king in Avignon on 1 November 1389, Louis II moved to Naples. His troops could not occupy the whole kingdom, thus it was practically divided between Louis II and his opponent, Ladislaus of Naples. The conflict between Clement VII&#x27;s successor, Antipope Benedict XIII, and France weakened Louis&#x27; position and Ladislaus forced him to leave Naples for Provence in 1399.

==Early life==

Louis was the elder of the two sons of Louis I of Anjou and Marie of Blois. Louis I was a younger son of King John II of France who granted Anjou and Maine to him as hereditary appanage in 1360. The childless Queen Joanna I of Naples adopted Louis I as her son and heir in 1380, because she needed French support against her rival, Charles of Durazzo. The rulers of Naples had acknowledged the popes&#x27; suzerainty since 1130, but two rival popes were competing for the supreme authority after the Western Schism of 1378. Joanna&#x27;s subjects regarded Urban VI as the lawful pope, but she preferred Urban&#x27;s opponent, Clement VII. In retaliation, Pope Urban confirmed Charles&#x27; claim to her realms and crowned him king of Naples (formally, king of Sicily) in Rome in June 1381. Charles of Durazzo invaded southern Italy, but Louis I could not leave France to protect his adoptive mother, because his brother, King Charles V of France had recently died. Charles of Durazzo captured Queen Joanna and occupied Naples in September.

Louis I was determined to seize her inheritance, which included the counties of Provence and Forcalquier and a claim to the Kingdom of Jerusalem in addition to Naples. The earliest plans about Louis&#x27; marriage were related to his father&#x27;s search for allies against Charles of Durazzo. In November 1381, Louis I was planning to forge an alliance with Aragon through the marriage of Louis and Louis&#x27; younger brother, Charles, with King Peter IV of Aragon&#x27;s granddaughters, Joanna and Yolande. The plan was soon set aside, because Louis I realized that an alliance with a powerful Italian ruler could serve his purposes. After in early 1382 he decided to launch a military campaign against Charles of Durazzo, he started negotiations with Bernabò Visconti, Lord of Milan. Bernabò agreed to hire troops to fight against Charles of Durazzo and engaged his daughter, Lucia, to Louis on 13 March 1382.

Louis I had meanwhile come to Avignon where Clement VII crowned him king. He took possession of Provence and Forcalquier, allowing his mercenaries to freely loot the two counties. His military campaign decided Queen Joanna&#x27;s fate, because Charles of Durazzo ordered her jailers to smother her in July. Louis I crossed the borders of the Kingdom of Naples in September, but Charles of Durazzo avoid to give a pitched battle. Louis I&#x27;s most mercenaries deserted by the end of 1382, forcing him to offer to abandon his claim to Naples in return for Provence, but Charles of Durazzo rejected his offer. The seven-year-old Louis, who was staying in Anjou, sent a ring to Lucia Visconti to Milan in token of their engagement on 6 May 1384. He was styled as Duke of Calabria in the letter.

Louis I died in Bari on 20 September 1384. In his last will, he asked Clement VII to support his son to seize the Kingdom of Naples. He appointed Enguerrand VII of Coucy to administer the occupied parts of the kingdom as viceroy, stipulating that his widow could only remove Coucy with the consent of his brothers (John, Duke of Berry and Philip II, Duke of Burgundy) and their nephew, King Charles VI of France.

==Reign==

===Minority===

Louis was only seven when his father died. His mother tried to persuade Louis&#x27; uncles Philip II of Burgundy and John of Berry to continue the military campaign against Naples. Bernabò Visconti supported her efforts, but both dukes refused to spend more money on the unsuccessful enterprise. The Duke of Burgundy clearly stated that &quot;all these little ventures&quot; should be forgotten. Bernabò Visconti was arrested by his nephew Gian Galeazzo Visconti on 6 May 1385, which put an end to negotiations about the marriage of his daughter and Louis.

Most towns and noblemen supported Charles of Durazzo in Provence and Forcelquier. They entered into a formal alliance against Louis and his mother in Aix-en-Provence. Marie, who was determined to restore their rule in the two wealthy counties, hurried to Marseille. Louis accompanied his mother and they jointly received the oaths of fealty of the three highest-ranking magistrates of the town on 24 August 1385. In return, they ceremoniously pledged that they would always observe the burghers&#x27; liberties. Marie entered into negotiations with the members of the League of Aix and persuaded them one by one to accept Louis&#x27; rule during the following two years.

Charles of Durazzo fell victim to a plot while laying claim to Hungary in February 1386. His ten-year-old son, Ladislaus, succeeded him under the guardianship of his mother, Margaret of Durazzo. Urban VI&#x27;s successor, Pope Boniface IX, confirmed Ladislaus&#x27; right to rule the Kingdom of Naples. Marie of Blois started negotiations about Louis&#x27; marriage with Ladislaus&#x27; sister, Joanna, but Louis flatly refused to marry the daughter of his father&#x27;s principal enemy in May 1387. Louis&#x27; supporters took possession of the town of Naples, but his adversaries were able to retain the two most important fortresses, the Castel Nuovo and Castel Sant&#x27;Elmo.

Charles VI of France reached the age of majority, dismissed the dukes of Burgundy and Berry and decided to provide support to Louis. He knighted Louis and his brother, Charles, at Saint-Denis Abbey in Paris in May 1389. The celebrations which lasted for a week were &quot;carefully stage-managed propaganda for the royal house, deliberately contrived to show its fortunes in the hands of a younger generation&quot;, according to historian Jonathan Sumption. He promised to grant 300,000 florins to Louis to finance a military campaign to southern Italy. (Anti)pope Clement VII soon promised to pay further 500,000 florins to Louis. Charles VI announced his decision to the burghers of Naples in a letter that was read out in the Naples Cathedral soon after the ritual liquefaction of the blood of Saint Januarius.

===Naples===

Antipope Clement VII crowned Louis king in the chapel of the Popes&#x27; Palace in Avignon on 1 November 1389. Charles VI of France and his younger brother, Louis of Touraine, were also present at the ceremony, demonstrating their support to Louis. Gian Galeazzo Visconti also joined their alliance.

Louis and his fleet of about 40 galleys sailed from Marseille in July 1390 and reached the Bay of Naples on 6 August. His troops captured the Castel Sant&#x27;Elmo in October, and the Castel Nuovo weeks later. Clement VII&#x27;s legate, Cardinal Pierre de Thury, who had accompanied Louis to Naples, administered the kingdom efficiently on his behalf. Louis was engaged to King John I of Aragon&#x27;s daughter, Yolande. Clement VII provided regular financial support to Louis whose troops achieved a series of major victories and captured Amalfi and Ravello in 1392. Most Calabrian barons (including the heads of the powerful Sanseverino and Ruffo families) also swore fealty to him by the autumn of 1392. In practice, the Kingdom of Naples was divided between Louis and Ladislaus.

Charles VI of France showed the first symptoms of madness on 5 August 1392, which enabled Philip II of Burgundy to strengthen his position at the French royal court. In November, Visconti sent an envoy to Paris to persuade the French to launch further military campaigns to Italy. Louis of Turenne, who had received the Duchy of Orléans from Charles VI, supported the plan, because he wanted to conquer large parts of the Papal States for himself; his maternal uncle, Louis II, Duke of Bourbon, also decided to lead a French army to Naples to support Louis. However, negotiations with their potential Italian allies and Clement VII proved that their goals could hardly be achieved, because of the lack of sufficient financial support.

Clement VII died unexpectedly in Avignon on 16 September 1394. Charles VI and his counsellors wanted to put an end to the schism and asked Clement VII&#x27;s cardinals not to elect a new pope. The cardinals ignored their request and elected an Aragonese cardinal who took the name Benedict XIII. Louis supported Benedict, but the French prelates decided to enforce the abdication of both popes at their general assembly in Paris on 2 February 1395. Louis of Orléans was determined to continue the military operations in Italy, but Charles VI&#x27;s wife, Isabeau of Bavaria, and Philip II of Burgundy convinced him to withdraw his troops from Italy in late February.

The conflict between France and Benedict XIII weakened Louis&#x27; position and Ladislaus could take advantage of his difficulties. When analysing their situation, historian Alan Ryder concludes that Louis revealed a &quot;character devoid of leadership&quot; and Ladislaus displayed that &quot;acumen and ruthlessness which were to make him the terror of Italy&quot;. Louis&#x27; real authority was restricted to the city of Naples, because the Calabrian barons only formally acknowledged his rule. Charles VI of France openly abandoned Louis&#x27; case when he signed a treaty with Florence, promising not to intervene in Naples.

The French clergy withdrew from the obedience to Benedict XIII and a French army laid siege to Avignon in July 1398. The legitimacy of Louis&#x27;s rule in Naples derived from his coronation by Benedict XIII&#x27;s predecessor, but his mother who administered Provence was to support the French action. Deprived of his revenues from France, Benedict XIII was no more able to finance Louis&#x27;s troops in Naples. The Apulian barons rose up against Louis, forcing him to launch a military campaign to Apulia in February 1399. The Sanseverini abandoned him and his absence from Naples enabled Ladislaus to seize the town on 10 July. Louis could not continue the fight and left southern Italy for Provence in the same month.

===In France===

Louis married his first cousin once removed Yolande of Aragon at the St. Trophime Cathedral in Arles on 2 December 1400. On the same day, she was crowned queen. This gave him a possibility of inheriting the throne of Aragon through her right. Her father, King John I of Aragon had died in 1396, and her uncle king Martin I of Aragon died in 1410.

Louis founded a university in Aix-en-Provence in 1409.

In 1409, Louis liberated Rome from Ladislaus&#x27; occupation; in 1410, as an ally of the antipope John XXIII he attacked Ladislaus and defeated him at Roccasecca (1411). Eventually Louis lost his Neapolitan support and had to retire. His claim to Naples passed to his son, Louis III.

His son, Louis, was initially betrothed to Catherine of Burgundy, a daughter of John the Fearless, Duke of Burgundy. However, after the Duke of Burgundy instigated a mob attack on the Dauphin of France, Louis and his wife joined the Armagnac Faction. The betrothal to Catherine was repudiated, which caused the enmity of the Duke of Burgundy.

He was not present at the Battle of Agincourt, because he had a bladder infection. After the battle, he fled from Paris to join his wife and children at Angers.

Louis II died at his chateau of Angers, the county town of Anjou; he is buried there.

==Family==
Louis and Yolande had five surviving children:

*Louis III of Anjou (1403–1434), titular King of Naples and Duke of Anjou.
*Marie of Anjou (1404–1463), married 1422 at Bourges, King Charles VII of France.
*René of Anjou (1409–1480), King of Naples and Duke of Anjou.
*Yolande of Anjou (1412, Arles – 1440), married firstly Philip I, Duke of Brabant, and secondly in 1431, Francis I, Duke of Brittany.
*Charles of Anjou (1414–1472), Count of Maine.

<doc id="732587" wikidata="Q2038865" url="?curid=732587" title="Women's Basketball Hall of Fame">
<text>The Women&#x27;s Basketball Hall of Fame honors those who have contributed to the sport of women&#x27;s basketball. The Hall of Fame opened in 1999 in Knoxville, Tennessee, USA. It is the only facility of its kind dedicated to all levels of women&#x27;s basketball. Knoxville is known for having a large women&#x27;s basketball following as well as being the home of the University of Tennessee&#x27;s Lady Vols basketball team previously coached by women&#x27;s coach Pat Summitt, who was part of the first class inducted. With the 2017 Induction, the Women&#x27;s Basketball Hall of Fame celebrated its 19th anniversary and added six new members to its hall, honoring 157 inductees.

Inductees may be nominated in the following categories: Coach, Veteran Coach, Player, International Player, Veteran Player, Contributor, and Official.

==Highlights==

===Women&#x27;s Basketball Hall of Fame campus===
The Women&#x27;s Basketball Hall of Fame is home to the world&#x27;s largest basketball sitting on the north rotunda of the hall, measuring 30 feet tall and weighing 10 tons.

The WBHOF Basketball Courts in the north rotunda of the hall allow one to test one&#x27;s basketball skills on three different courts representing the hall&#x27;s mission statement of &quot;honoring the past, celebrating the present, and promoting the future&quot; of women&#x27;s basketball. The courts also are home to a timed dribbling course and a passing skills area. There is also a photo area where you can pretend to be players from different eras in history.

====Pat Summitt====
Pat Summitt Rotunda is located at the entrance of the WBHOF. This area remembers founding board member and Class of 1999 inductee Pat Summitt.

The courtyard outside of the Pat Summitt Rotunda is shaped like a basketball and is made of numerous bricks with personalized inscriptions. Many of the bricks are engraved to honor guests, inductees and a host of other who have chosen to leave their legacy at the hall of fame.

====Hall of Honor====
The Hall of Honor is the location within the Hall of Fame that recognizes the achievements of each of the inductees.

====Eastman Statue====
The Eastman Statue, sculpted by Elizabeth MacQueen, is erected at the entrance to the Women&#x27;s Basketball Hall of Fame. This 17-foot-tall bronze statue exemplifies Women&#x27;s Basketball Hall of Fame&#x27;s mission to &quot;honor the past, celebrate the present and promote the future&quot; of women&#x27;s basketball. Each year, the Women&#x27;s Basketball Hall of Fame presents its current class of Inductees with a replica of the Eastman statue, known as the &quot;Eastman&quot;.

===Trailblazers of the Game===

====All American Red Heads====
The All American Red Heads played for 50 years, from 1936 to 1986 which is still the longest running women&#x27;s professional team. The Red Heads were founded by Mr. and Mrs.C. M. Olson in Cassville, Missouri. C. M. Olson was the former coach-owner of a male exhibition basketball team called Olson&#x27;s Terrible Swedes. Known for their on-court antics, this inspired C. M. Olson&#x27;s wife, Doyle, and the women who worked in her beauty salons to form a professional basketball exhibition team. In 1954, Coach Orwell Moore and his wife Lorene &quot;Butch&quot; Moore bought the Red heads and moved the team to Caraway, Arkansas. Lorene Moore played on the team for eleven years, scoring 35,426 points during her career. The Red Heads were so popular that during the years 1964-1971 there may have been as many as three Red Head teams traveling the country. In 1972, the Red Heads won 500 out of 642 games played against men&#x27;s team. Throughout the years the All American Red Heads played in all 50 states as well as Mexico, Canada, and the Philippines. The team has been featured in national magazines such as Life, Look, Sports Illustrated and Women&#x27;s Sports, and they were widely considered as the greatest women&#x27;s basketball team in the world. Coach Moore retired and disbanded the Red Heads in 1986 after 50 years of play The All American Red Heads still have annual reunions today.

====Edmonton Commercial Graduates Basketball Club====
The Edmonton Commercial Graduates Basketball Club was founded in 1915 by John Percy Page. The origins of the club can be traced to the McDougall Commercial Girls High School Basketball team in Edmonton, Canada. When team members graduated high school, they convinced coach John Percy Page to continue the team as a Club sport. Membership with the Club was exclusive, only 38 women ever wore the Grad jersey. Winnie Martin (Tait) was the First Captain of the Edmonton Grads, playing from 1915-1924. The Grads played 522 games officially in Canada, the United States and Europe. The Club tallied a 502-20 record in 25 years of play The Edmonton Commercial Graduates are widely considered the greatest women&#x27;s team ever assembled. Financially restrained, members often chipped in to raise funds for national play. Their strong dedication to the game and will to persevere in a time when women&#x27;s basketball was largely ignored makes the Edmonton Grads praiseworthy John Percy Page coached the club to 18 Canadian Championships The Club attended four sets of Olympic Games: Paris in 1924, Amsterdam in 1928, Los Angeles in 1932, and Berlin in 1936 where they received 4 unofficial Olympic titles The Club played its last game on June 5, 1940, defeating a Chicago team 62-52 Dr. James A. Naismith was quoted to say, &quot;There is no team that I mention more frequently in talking about the game. My admiration is not only for your remarkable record of games won (which itself would make you stand out in the history of basketball) but also for your record of clean play, versatility in meeting teams at their own style, and more especially for your unbroken record of good sportsmanship.&quot;

====Wayland Baptist Flying Queens====
Claude Hutcherson, a Wayland graduate and owner of Hutcherson Air Service, provided air transportation for the Queens to games in Mexico in 1948. That encounter blossomed into a full sponsorship of the team in 1950, a change that brought with it a new mascot - the Hutcherson Flying Queens. Five decades later, Wayland is still atop the world of women&#x27;s basketball for they still remain the only women&#x27;s team in history to win 1,300 games. Long before Connecticut became a dominant power in women&#x27;s basketball, the Flying Queens of Wayland Baptist thrived on innovation, talent and glamour, playing on athletic scholarships, traveling by private planes, warming up with ostentatious drills learned from the Harlem Globetrotters and winning every game for nearly five seasons. The Wayland Baptist University women&#x27;s team achieved a 131-game winning streak from November 1953 to March 1958 before losing 46-42 to Nashville Business School. During that time the Flying Queens captured four consecutive AAU national championships.

====Mighty Macs====
The 1972-74 Mighty Macs team captured the first three Association for Intercollegiate Athletics for Women (AIAW) championships. Immaculata is considered the birthplace of modern college women&#x27;s basketball. In addition, to winning the first three college national championships, the Mighty Macs were the first women&#x27;s team along with the University of Maryland to appear on National television. They were also the first women&#x27;s team, along with Queen&#x27;s College, to play at Madison Square Garden. Their inspirational story was made into a feature-length theatrical movie called The Mighty Macs and released by Sony Pictures in 2011. The 1972-74 teams have produced 3 Women&#x27;s Basketball Hall of Fame Inductees. Listed are the individuals associated with the three teams; Janet Ruch Boltz, Denise Conway Crawford, Janet Young Eline, Theresa Shank Grentz (Class of 2001), Barbara Deuble Kelly, Tina Krah, Patricia Mulhern Loughran, Judy Marra Martelli, Sue Forsyth O&#x27;Grady, Rene Muth Portland, Betty Ann Hoffman Quinn, Cathy Rush (Class of 2000), Mary Scharff, Marianne Crawford Stanley (Class of 2002), Maureen Stuhlman, and Marie Liguori Williams.

====Delta State teams====
The 1975, 1976, and 1977 Delta State teams captured three consecutive AIAW championships. After finishing 16–2 in the 1973-74 revival season following a 40-year layoff of the women&#x27;s basketball program, Delta State proceeded to end Immaculata College&#x27;s three-year AIAW national championship reign in season No. 2 by going undefeated at 28-0. Delta State followed its first AIAW national crown by also winning the next two as the Lady Statesmen defeated Immaculata (69-64) at Penn State and then LSU (68-55) at Minnesota. During their three championship years, Delta State compiled a 93-4 record (28-0, 33-1, 32-3), including a then-record 51 straight wins. The 1975-77 teams have produced 2 Women&#x27;s Basketball Hall of Fame inductees, Margaret Wade and Lusia Harris Stewart. The WBCA Wade Trophy, considered the Heisman of women&#x27;s basketball, is named in honor of Lily Margaret Wade. Listed are the individuals associated with the three teams: Angel Fortenberry, Ann Logue, Beth Trussell, Cornelia Ward, Debbie Brock, Jackie Caston, Janie Evans, Jill Rhodes, Judy Davis, Kathy Lewis, Key Crump, Laurie Ann Harper, Lusia Harris Stewart (Class of 1999), Lynn Adubato, Mandy Fortenberyy, Margaret Wade (Class of 1999), Mary Logue, Melissa Thames, Melissa Ward, Mimi Williams, Pam Piazza, Ramona von Boeckman, Sheri Haynes, Tish Fahey, Virginia Shackelford, and Wanda Hairston.

====USA Women&#x27;s Basketball teams====
The 1976 USA Women&#x27;s Basketball team captured the United States&#x27; first medal in Olympic women&#x27;s basketball history winning the silver medal. The USA&#x27;s silver medal finish served a notice to the rest of the world that the United States would be a force in Olympic women&#x27;s basketball. Since the 1976 Olympics, the USA Women&#x27;s Basketball Teams have compiled a record of 55 and 1 and captured 7 gold medals and 1 bronze in Olympic play. The 1976 USA Olympic Women&#x27;s Basketball Team paved the way for United States dominance. The 1976 team has produced 11 Women&#x27;s Basketball Hall of Fame Inductees.

====Helm Foundation====
The Helms Foundation was established in 1936 and created by Bill Schroeder and Paul Helms to select national championship teams and All-American teams in a number of college sports, including women&#x27;s basketball. The Panel met annually to vote on a National Champion and retroactively ranked basketball back to 1901. When Paul Helms died in 1957, United Savings and Loan became the Helms Foundation&#x27;s benefactor and eventually became known as the Citizens Savings Athletic Foundation. The Foundation officially dissolved in 1982. Thirteen Helms Foundation members are also Women&#x27;s Basketball Hall of Fame Inductees: Alline Banks (Sprouse), Joan Crawford, Lyrlyne Greer, Rita Horkey, Doris Rogers, Margaret Sexton, Hazel Walker, Katherine Washington, Nera White, John Head, Claude Hutcherson, Harley Redin, and Lometa Odom.

<text>Talbot is a dormant automobile marque introduced in 1902 by British-French company Clément-Talbot. The founders, Charles Chetwynd-Talbot, 20th Earl of Shrewsbury and Adolphe Clément-Bayard, reduced their financial interests in their Clément-Talbot business during the First World War.

Soon after the end of the war, Clément-Talbot was brought into an Anglo-French combine named STD Motors (Sunbeam, Talbot and Darracq). Shortly afterward, STD Motors&#x27; French products were renamed Talbot instead of Darracq.

In the mid-1930s, with the collapse of STD Motors, Rootes bought the London Talbot factory and Antonio Lago bought the Paris Talbot factory, Lago producing vehicles under the marques Talbot and Talbot-Lago. Rootes renamed Clément-Talbot Sunbeam-Talbot in 1938, and stopped using the brand name Talbot in the mid-1950s. The Paris factory closed a few years later.

Ownership of the marque – which through a convoluted series of takeovers saw it exist in two different forms by both the Rootes Group and Simca – and with both these companies coming under the ownership of Chrysler Corporation in the 1960s, it eventually fell into the ownership of PSA Peugeot Citroën after it acquired the ailing Chrysler Europe from its American parent in 1978. PSA revived the use of the Talbot marque from 1979 until 1994; applying it to the former Chrysler Europe products. 

The rights to the Talbot marque are presently owned by Groupe PSA&#x27;s successor, Stellantis.

==Talbot London==

Clément-Talbot was founded in 1903. The first products were cars that were London-assembled mechanical components of French Clément-Bayard cars but the French components were soon replaced by British parts. The brand-name was reduced to Talbot after the first year.

===STD Motors===
In December 1919, Darracq of London with its factory in Suresnes, Paris, bought the entire capital of Clément-Talbot and later bought Sunbeam and renamed itself STD Motors. Those initials referred to Sunbeam, Talbot and Darracq. But in the depth of the Great Depression, STD Motors became unable to pay its debts. Its subsidiaries managed to find buyers and in 1936 STD Motors ceased to exist.

===Talbot London under STD Motors===
Clément-Talbot continued to be known for the design and quality of its products and it remained profitable during the depression. Clément-Talbot was bought by Rootes Group and later renamed Sunbeam-Talbot. Then Sunbeam alone twenty years after that.

===Talbot Paris under STD Motors===
In 1920, Suresnes products were branded Talbot-Darracq but the word Darracq was dropped in 1922. If exported to England Paris-made Talbots were rebadged Darracq or Talbot-Darracq

Dragged down by the 1924 borrowing to pay for the Sunbeam racing programme, STD Motors and Automobiles Talbot France suffered a financial collapse in late 1934.

===Talbot London under the Rootes brothers===
Following the financial collapse of its parent, STD Motors, Clément-Talbot remained financially sound with readily marketable products. Clément-Talbot was bought by Rootes Securities and continued to manufacture the same catalogue of vehicles quietly introducing components from Hillman and Humber cars. As the genuine Talbot parts bins emptied, a modified Hillman Aero Minx was introduced to the production line and given the Talbot brand name.

In 1938, this Talbot Ten and its stable mates were badged Sunbeam-Talbot and owner, Clément-Talbot&#x27;s, name changed to fit.

==Talbot Paris under Antonio Lago==
Following the financial collapse of STD Motors and Paris&#x27;s Automobiles Talbot, Antonio Lago, the Suresnes&#x27; manager, arranged a management buyout of the French operation.

Antonio Lago involved Talbot in sports car and Grand Prix racing as well as producing high quality luxury cars. In the postwar world of austerity the French government introduced punitive annual taxation on cars with engines larger than 2.6-litres and Talbot sales were severely restricted. Lago continued the Talbot business until 1958 when the factory doors were closed.

The dormant Talbot marque was sold to Simca. Simca was gradually acquired by Chrysler Corporation between 1963 and 1970 – which effectively brought the two Talbot brands together since Chrysler Europe already owned the Rootes Group. PSA Peugeot Citroën acquired the still dormant Talbot marque when it bought Chrysler in 1978. PSA Peugeot Citroën began to use a Talbot badge on former Simca and Chrysler/Rootes models.

==Chrysler/Peugeot era (1979–1985)==

Chrysler Europe struggled to enter profitability for much of its existence, and had relied on government support to ensure its survival. With mounting pressure on its core North American business, the decision was taken by Chrysler&#x27;s then CEO Lee Iacocca to offload the ailing European operations. The French Government persuaded both Renault and PSA Peugeot Citroën to bid for the company; as it was keen to keep Simca in domestic ownership.

In August 1978, PSA negotiated a deal with Chrysler to acquire Chrysler Europe for a nominal $1. Although PSA took responsibility for Chrysler Europe&#x27;s considerable debts and liabilities, the move was a strategic one; acquiring Simca would remove a strong domestic competitor in the French market while gaining access to that company&#x27;s expertise in small front wheel drive cars; while at the same time the old Rootes operations would give the company a stronger foothold in the United Kingdom – France&#x27;s biggest export market where both Peugeot and Citroën lagged behind arch rival Renault. PSA formally took control of the old Chrysler Europe on 1 January 1979. To lead the new group, former British Leyland executive George Turnbull (who had just completed his secondment at Hyundai), was appointed as the managing director of the UK arm.

The Peugeot takeover saw the end of the Rootes&#x27; Chrysler Hunter production, but the Chrysler Avenger and Sunbeam (also both Rootes designs), and the Simca 1307 (Chrysler Alpine in UK), and Horizon continued rebadged as Talbots.

All former Chrysler products registered in Britain after 1 August 1979 bore the Talbot badge. Talbot&#x27;s UK branch manufactured the Alpine, Solara, and Horizon at its aging Ryton plant in Coventry, after the British-developed cars had all been retired, except for the largest revenue source of the UK arm at that time, building CKD kits of the Hillman Hunter to be sent to Iran where they were assembled as the Peykan.

The last remaining car produced by the Rootes group, the Chrysler (previously Hillman) Avenger, remained in production as a Talbot until the end of 1981; production of the Avenger-derived Talbot Sunbeam also ended in 1981. The entry-level model in the Talbot range from December 1981 onwards was the Talbot Samba, a three-door hatchback based on the Peugeot 104.

In 1981, Peugeot began producing the Talbot Tagora, a boxy four-door saloon marketed as a rival to the Ford Granada and to the Vauxhall Carlton/Opel Rekord. But as sales were insufficient in both Britain and France, production ceased in 1983 after only 19,389 units were manufactured.

At the end of 1984, the Alpine hatchback and its related Solara saloon were re-badged Minx and Rapier, depending upon specification rather than body shape. The new names were inherited from the Rootes Group; Rootes had previously produced the Hillman Minx and Sunbeam Rapier. The new versions were produced until 1986. Former Rootes names are still revived occasionally; in 1982, there was a Talbot Solara &quot;Sceptre&quot; model, the name being inherited from the Humber Sceptre which was produced between 1963 and 1976.

===Decline and Demise===
In the UK, the Chrysler and Talbot marques had gained nearly 120,000 sales in 1979, only outsold by Ford and British Leyland. However, it then went into decline, not helped by the recession in the early 1980s, or by a lack of new models being launched. By 1985, however, after years of losses, PSA Peugeot Citroën began to question its three-brand strategy. The Talbot Tagora model failed in the marketplace; the Samba was essentially a decade-old design thanks to its Peugeot 104 parentage, whilst the ageing 1510/Alpine/Solara models overlapped with both the Citroën BX and forthcoming Peugeot 405.

At the eleventh hour, the decision was made to release the forthcoming Horizon replacement as the Peugeot 309 instead of Talbot Arizona. It was a controversial decision, because the British arm of the company believed there was greater brand loyalty to Talbot in the UK, with its historical connection to the Rootes Group. However, the decision to concentrate on the Peugeot brand prevailed, and the 309 became the first of a long line of British-built Peugeot models to be assembled at the Ryton plant. Partly because they were perceived as &quot;British&quot; (despite most of their content actually being imported from PSA&#x27;s French factories), the 309 and the subsequent 405, 306 and 206 models were very successful in the UK market, and regularly featured among the country&#x27;s top ten best-selling cars.

Around 1984, PSA had also considered launching a replacement for the Talbot Samba based on the platform of the Citroën AX, which was still under-development, but such was the success of the Peugeot 205 in the supermini sector that PSA felt there was little need for a third supermini in its portfolio. It became clear however, that there was no long-term future for the Talbot brand in 1986 when PSA sold the Whitley research and development centre to Jaguar, signalling the end of any more British-developed models.

Production of the Horizon continued in Spain and Finland until 1987, marking the end of the Talbot name on passenger cars (the Samba had been discontinued in May 1986), although the Talbot Express panel van continued in production until 1994, after which the entire Talbot marque was axed.

===Talbots in the UK===

The Talbot Express van (along with its identical sister vehicle the Fiat Ducato) was a popular base vehicle for motorhomes and campervan conversions. According to the website &quot;How Many Left?&quot;, there were fewer than 40 Alpine/Solara models, 20 Horizons, 10 Sambas and only one Tagora still registered with the British Driver &amp; Vehicle Licensing Agency, compared to well over 5,000 Talbot Express vans, the vast majority of which are motorhomes.

===Resurrection===
In 2008, PSA considered reintroducing Talbot to the market, targeting low-budget buyers, as Renault did with its Dacia Logan. It was suggested that these could be models produced in China such as Talbot versions of the Citroën Elysée and of the Peugeot 206, but did not make a comeback as of 2012 because PSA introduced the second-generation Citroën C-Elysée and the Peugeot 301.

The merger of Groupe PSA and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles in 2021 to form Stellantis, saw the Talbot brand again exist under the same corporate umbrella as Chrysler, over 40 years after the dissolution of Chrysler Europe.

==Motorsport==

===Formula One===
Talbot had two brief spells in Formula One. The 4.5-litre, six-cylinder Talbot-Lago T26 was eligible for F1 competition post-war, and many examples, both factory and private, appeared in the first two years of the F1 World Championship, 1950 and 1951. Talbots came fourth and fifth in the inaugural World Championship race, the 1950 British Grand Prix, piloted by Yves Giraud-Cabantous and Louis Rosier respectively. The move to two-litre F2 regulations for 1952 effectively ended Talbot&#x27;s F1 spell as a manufacturer.

There was a brief participation in Formula One in the 1981 and 1982 seasons by associating with the Ligier team and using its Matra connection to secure a Matra engine for them, changing official constructor&#x27;s name to &quot;Talbot Ligier&quot; in both seasons. The Talbot Ligier team was moderately successful, Jacques Laffite coming fourth in the 1981 championship with two wins.

===World Rally Championship===

The Talbot factory team for the World Rally Championship was founded in 1979, after Peugeot had taken over Chrysler Europe and resurrected the Talbot name. In the team&#x27;s inaugural season in the series, Tony Pond drove the Talbot Sunbeam Lotus to fourth place at the 1979 Rallye Sanremo. More success followed in the 1980 season; Guy Fréquelin brought Talbot the team&#x27;s first podium by finishing third at the 1980 Rally Portugal, and then Henri Toivonen won the RAC Rally, becoming the youngest-ever driver to win a world rally. The rally was a big success for Talbot as the team also took the third and fourth places, driven by Fréquelin and Russell Brookes, respectively. This was also the last time that a two-wheel-drive car won the RAC Rally. In the manufacturers&#x27; world championship, Talbot placed sixth.

In the 1981 season, Talbot continued with Fréquelin and Toivonen. Although the team&#x27;s only win came at the Rally Argentina, driven by Fréquelin, consistent podiums and points-scoring finishes saw Talbot take the manufacturers&#x27; title. Fréquelin narrowly lost the drivers&#x27; title to Ford&#x27;s Ari Vatanen. The 1982 season saw the series dominated by the four-wheel-drive Audi Quattro, and with Group B regulations coming up, Talbot withdrew from the WRC. However, the Talbot name continued in the championship, as Jean Todt founded the &quot;Peugeot Talbot Sport&quot; in 1981. This Peugeot factory team debuted in 1984 and won the drivers&#x27; and manufacturers&#x27; titles in 1985 and 1986.

===World Sportscar Championship===
The Talbot marque appeared in the motorsport for the last time as a part of the Peugeot Talbot Sport sportscar team founded by Jean Todt which competed in the World Sportscar Championship in the 1990–1992 seasons and at the 1993 24 Hours of Le Mans. The French team won both a drivers&#x27; and teams&#x27; title at the World Sportscar Championship in the 1992 season and the 24 Hours of Le Mans in 1992 and 1993.

==Sponsorship==
Talbot was the main sponsor of Coventry City football club from 1981 to 1983, and at one stage the club&#x27;s chairman Jimmy Hill was planning to change the club&#x27;s name to Coventry Talbot. However, these plans were vetoed by the Football League and by the summer of 1983 Talbot had ended its association with the club.

<text>Janeway lesions are rare, non-tender, small erythematous or haemorrhagic macular, papular or nodular lesions on the palms or soles only a few millimeters in diameter that are associated with infective endocarditis and often indistinguishable from Osler&#x27;s nodes.

==Definition==
Janeway lesions are painless, frequently haemorrhagic lesions seen most commonly on the palms and soles, particularly on the base of the thumb and little finger, and seen in infective endocarditis.

==Differential==
Osler&#x27;s nodes and Janeway lesions are similar and point to the same diagnostic conclusion. The most significant difference between the two is that Osler&#x27;s nodes present with tenderness, while Janeway lesions do not. Osler&#x27;s nodes are thought to be due to immunologic phenomenon where deposition of immune complexes provoke inflammatory response, leading to swelling, redness and pain. On the contrary, Janeway lesions are thought to be due to embolic phenomenon in cutaneous blood vessels of palms and soles which does not cause pain or least pain.

==Pathophysiology==
Pathologically, the lesion is described to be a microabscess of the dermis with marked necrosis and inflammatory infiltrate not involving the epidermis.

They are caused by septic emboli which deposit bacteria, forming microabscesses. Organisms may be cultured from the lesions.

==Diagnosis==
Janeway lesions present as red, painless macules and papules on the palms and soles.

They are not common and are frequently indistinguishable from Osler&#x27;s nodes. Rarely, they have been reported in cases of systemic lupus erythematosis (SLE), gonococcemia (disseminated gonorrhoea), haemolytic anaemia and typhoid fever.

They may last days to weeks before completely resolving.

==History==
Janeway lesions are named after Edward Janeway (1841–1911), a prominent American physician, pathologist and contemporary of Sir William Osler, who initially described &quot;peculiar skin lesions&quot; in some people with endocarditis, in a paper published in 1899. The term was first used by internist and pathologist Emanuel Libman, who reported the lesions in his paper of 1906 and explained his reasoning for using the term &quot;Janeway lesions&quot; in a footnote in 1923. Osler never mentioned Janeway lesions. The inclusion into Osler&#x27;s 1925 textbook came six years after Osler died.

<doc id="732598" wikidata="Q429207" url="?curid=732598" title="James Paget">
<text>Sir James Paget, 1st Baronet FRS HFRSE (11 January 1814 – 30 December 1899) (, rhymes with &quot;gadget&quot;) was an English surgeon and pathologist who is best remembered for naming Paget&#x27;s disease and who is considered, together with Rudolf Virchow, as one of the founders of scientific medical pathology. His famous works included &quot;Lectures on Tumours&quot; (1851) and &quot;Lectures on Surgical Pathology&quot; (1853). There are several medical conditions which were described by, and later named after, Paget:
* Paget&#x27;s disease of bone
* Paget&#x27;s disease of the nipple (a form of intraductal breast cancer spreading into the skin around the nipple)
** Extramammary Paget&#x27;s disease refers to a group of similar, more rare skin lesions discovered by Radcliffe Crocker in 1889 which affect the male and female genitalia.
* Paget–Schroetter disease
* Paget&#x27;s abscess, an abscess that recurs at the site of a former abscess which had resolved.

==Life==
Paget was born in Great Yarmouth, England, on 11 January 1814, the son of Samuel Paget, a brewer and shipowner, and his wife, Sarah Elizabeth Tolver. He was one of a large family, and his brother Sir George Edward Paget (1809–1892), who became Regius Professor of Physic at the University of Cambridge in 1872, also had a distinguished career in medicine and was made a K.C.B. James attended a day-school in Yarmouth, and afterwards was intended for the navy; but this plan was given up, and at the age of 16 he was apprenticed to a general practitioner, for whom he served for four and a half years, during which time he gave his leisure hours to botanising, and made a great collection of the flora of East Norfolk. At the end of his apprenticeship, he published with one of his brothers a very careful &quot;Sketch of the Natural History of Yarmouth and its Neighbourhood&quot;.

In October 1834, he entered as a student at St Bartholomew&#x27;s Hospital, in London. Here he is noted to have described the first journal club. Medical students in those days were left very much to themselves; there was no close supervision of their work, but Paget probably gained rather than lost by having to fight his own way. He swept the board of prizes in 1835, and again in 1836; in his first winter session, he discovered the pathogen for trichinosis, a parasitic disease caused by &quot;Trichinella spiralis&quot;, a minute roundworm that infests the muscles of the human body, and which is usually acquired by eating infected pork. In May 1836, he passed his examination at the Royal College of Surgeons, and became qualified to practise. The next seven years (1836–1843) were spent in London lodgings, and were a time of poverty, for he made only 15 pounds a year by practise, and his father, having failed in business, could not give him any help. He managed to keep himself by writing for the medical journals, and preparing the catalogues of the hospital museum and the pathological museum of the Royal College of Surgeons. In 1836, he was made curator of the hospital museum, and in 1838, demonstrator of morbid anatomy at the hospital, but his advancement there was hindered by the privileges of the hospital apprentices, and because he had been too poor to afford a house-surgeoncy, or even a dressership.

In 1841, he was made surgeon to the Finsbury Dispensary, but this appointment did not give him any experience in the graver operations of surgery. He was appointed lecturer on general anatomy (microscopic anatomy) and physiology at the hospital in 1843, and warden of the hospital college then founded. For the next eight years, he lived within the walls of the hospital, in charge of about 30 students resident in the little college. Besides his lectures and his superintendence of the resident students, he had to enter all new students, to advise them how to work, and to manage the finances and the general affairs of the school. Thus, he was constantly occupied with the business of the school, and often passed a week, or more, without going outside the hospital gates.

In 1844, he married Lydia North (d.1895), youngest daughter of the Rev. Henry North. In 1847, he was appointed an assistant surgeon to the hospital, and Arris and Gale professor at the Royal College of Surgeons. He held this professorship for six years and each year gave six lectures in surgical pathology. The first edition of these lectures, which were the chief scientific work of his life, was published in 1853 as &quot;Lectures on Surgical Pathology&quot;. He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1851. In October 1851, he resigned the wardenship of the hospital. He had now become known as a great physiologist and pathologist; he had done for pathology in England what Rudolf Virchow had done in Germany, but he had hardly begun to get into practice, and he had kept himself poor so he might pay his share of his father&#x27;s debts, a task that took him 14 years to fulfil.

Paget was the father of Sir John Paget (2nd Baronet); the Rt Revd Dr Francis Paget, Lord Bishop of Oxford; the Rt Revd Dr Luke Paget, Lord Bishop of Chester; and Stephen Paget, an English surgeon who first proposed the seed and soil theory of metastasis.

Paget was friends with Charles Darwin and Thomas Henry Huxley. He was a committed Christian and maintained there was no conflict between religion and science.

He was elected as a member of the American Philosophical Society in 1854 and was President of the Royal Medical and Chirurgical Society from 1875 to 1877.

==Works==
No famous surgeon, not even John Hunter (1728–1793), was likely to have founded his practice deeper in science than Paget did, or waited longer for his work to come back to him. In physiology, he had mastered the chief English, French, German, Dutch and Italian literature of the subject, and by incessant study and microscope work had put himself level with the most advanced knowledge of his time, so that it was said of him by Robert Owen, in 1851, that he had his choice, either to be the first physiologist in Europe, or to have the first surgical practice in London, with a baronetcy. His physiological lectures at St Bartholomew&#x27;s Hospital were the chief cause of the rise in the fortunes of its school, which in 1843 had gone down to a low point.

His work in pathology was even more important. He filled the place in pathology left empty by Hunter&#x27;s death in 1793; this was the time of transition from Hunter&#x27;s teaching, which for all its greatness was hindered by want of the modern microscope, to the pathology and bacteriology of the present day. Paget&#x27;s greatest achievement was that he made pathology dependent, in everything, on the use of the microscope, especially the pathology of tumours. He also made watercolour depictions of the specimens in Hunter&#x27;s museum and catalogued its medical collections. He and Virchow may truly be called the founders of modern pathology; they stand together, Paget&#x27;s &quot;Lectures on Surgical Pathology&quot; and Virchow&#x27;s &quot;Cellulär-Pathologie&quot;.

When Paget, in 1851, began practice near Cavendish Square, he had still to wait a few years more for success in professional life. The turn of the tide came about 1854 or 1855; and in 1858 he was appointed surgeon extraordinary to Queen Victoria, and in 1863 surgeon in ordinary to Albert Edward, Prince of Wales. Paget wrote briefly and derisively of physician James Richard Hancorn, son of J. R. Hancorn: &quot;Idle, dissipated, drinking,—associate of Sievier. Had to resign the House Surgeoncy; practised a few months with his father in Shoreditch; &amp; died in 1860.&quot; The sculptor Robert William Sievier had a studio on Henrietta Street, near Cavendish Square.

Paget had for many years the largest and most arduous surgical practice in London. His day&#x27;s work was seldom less than 16 or 17 hours. Cases sent to him for final judgment, with special frequency, were those of tumours, and of all kinds of disease of the bones and joints, and all neurotic cases having symptoms of surgical disease. His supremacy lay rather in the science than in the art of surgery, but his name is also associated with certain great practical advances. He discovered Paget&#x27;s disease of the breast and Paget&#x27;s disease of the bones (&quot;osteitis deformans&quot;), which are named after him; he was the first to urge removal of the tumour, instead of amputation of the limb, in cases of myeloid sarcoma. In 1869 he was elected President of the Clinical Society of London.
In 1870, he was elected a foreign member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences.

In 1871, he nearly died from infection at a &quot;post mortem&quot; examination, and, to lighten the weight of his work, was obliged to resign his surgeoncy to the hospital. In this same year, he received the honour of the baronetcy of Harewood Place in the County of Middlesex. He received an honorary degree from the University of Cambridge in 1874. In 1875, he was president of the Royal College of Surgeons, and delivered the Hunterian oration in 1877. Also in 1875, he was elected as president of the Medical and Chirurgical Society of London. In 1878, he gave up operating, but for eight or 10 years longer, he still had a very heavy consulting practice. In 1880, he gave, at Cambridge, a memorable address on Elemental Pathology, setting forth the likeness of certain diseases of plants and trees to those of the human body. The next year, he was president of the International Medical Congress held in London. In 1887 he was elected President of the Pathological Society of London

Besides shorter writings, he also published &quot;Clinical Lectures and Essays&quot; (1st ed. 1875) and &quot;Studies of Old Case-books&quot; (1891). In 1883, on the death of Sir George Jessel, he was appointed vice-chancellor of the University of London. In 1889, he was appointed a member of the Royal Commission on Vaccination.

In May 1886, he treated Edward Crowley, father of Aleister Crowley for tongue cancer. An operation was advised, but Crowley declined and died the following year.

He died at home, 5 Park Square West in Regent&#x27;s Park, London, on 30 December 1899, at the age of 85. The &quot;Memoirs and Letters of Sir James Paget&quot;, edited by Stephen Paget, was published in 1901.

Sir James Paget had the gift of eloquence, and was one of the most careful and most delightful speakers of his time. He had a natural and unaffected pleasure in society, and he loved music. He possessed the rare gift of the ability to turn swiftly from work to play, enjoying his holidays like a schoolboy, easily moved to laughter, keen to get the maximum of happiness out of very ordinary amusements, emotional in spite of incessant self-restraint, and vigorous in spite of constant overwork. In him, a certain light-hearted enjoyment was combined with the utmost reserve, unfailing religious faith, and the most scrupulous honour. He was all his life profoundly indifferent toward politics, both national and medical; his ideal was the unity of science and practice in professional life.

Sir James&#x27;s reputation remains high due to his work as a surgeon and medical research and work, but he also had an apparent interest in criminal matters. In 1886, he followed the Pimlico Mystery, the poisoning trial of Adelaide Bartlett for the murder of her husband Edwin. After a spirited defence by Sir Edward Clarke, Bartlett was acquitted. The key problem of the trial was that Edwin was poisoned by liquid chloroform, which was found in his stomach, but liquid chloroform burns the throat if swallowed, and the drinker would be screaming. Edwin Bartlett never screamed the night he died. As a result, an alternative theory of suicide was considered and helped get the acquittal, but it left the public unsatisfied. Paget, upon hearing the result, made the comment for which he is best remembered: &quot;Now that she has been acquitted for murder and cannot be tried again, she should tell us in the interest of science how she did it!&quot;

<text>Savage Arms is an American gunmaker based in Westfield, Massachusetts, with operations in Canada and China. Savage makes a variety of rimfire and centerfire rifles, as well as Stevens single-shot rifles and shotguns. The company is best known for the Model 99 lever-action rifle, no longer in production, and the .300 Savage. Savage was a subsidiary of Vista Outdoor until 2019 when it was spun off.
==History==

Savage Arms was founded in 1894 by Arthur Savage in Utica, New York. Within 20 years they were producing rifles, handguns, and ammunition. Savage introduced the first hammerless lever-action rifle, the Model 1895, derived from Arthur Savage&#x27;s Model 1892 rifle that he had designed for Colt in a failed bid for a US Army rifle contract that instead was won by the Krag–Jørgensen design. The Model 1895 won a New York National Guard contract, but the contract was cancelled due to political controversy.

Savage was one of six companies to participate in the United States Army trials for a .45 caliber semi-automatic pistol, and was named one of the two finalists before losing out to Colt&#x27;s design, which would become the M1911 pistol. Savage marketed a series of .32 and .380 caliber pocket pistols, the Models 1907, 1915, and 1917 based on the same patents as their .45 caliber prototype.

In 1915-1916 company chief designer Charles A. Nelson directed the design of new bolt-action rifles for the US military to supplement M1903 Springfield, but in the run-up of the US entrance in WWI US Army decided to adopt Pattern 1914 Enfield which was already in the serial production for the British, and Savage was tasked with machine gun production instead. Savage merged with the Driggs-Seabury Ordnance Company during World War I and produced Lewis machine guns at Driggs-Seabury&#x27;s former plant in Sharon, Pennsylvania. Savage also produced Model 1899 muskets for the Montreal Home Guard during World War I.

A 1979 Savage Arms catalogue claimed that in 1919, Arthur Savage was approached by Chief Lame Deer to buy rifles for his tribe in New York. Lame Deer offered to allow Savage to use his image as its logo in exchange for discounted rifles and an annual fee. As of 2018, Savage Arms was still paying the annual fee. However, the Savage Model 1907 already bore the logo (including those made prior to 1919), and a catalog from 1903 shows Savage Arms using a similar illustration as well.

===Interwar===
In 1920 Savage restarted the production of Model 1899 as Model 99, introduced new Model 1920 bolt-action rifle based on Nelson&#x27;s WWI prototypes modified for cartridges shorter than military rifle ones that would fit in Model 99 magazine, and introduced a new cartridge of that type: .300 Savage .

Also in the same year, Savage bought Stevens Arms of Chicopee, Massachusetts. In July 1921, a mortgage securing five promissory notes, each for $21,416, was filed in the County Clerk&#x27;s office in Utica showing that the Savage Arms Corporation had purchased a &quot;number of buildings erected by the government&quot; during World War I for increasing the output of Lewis machine guns at the plant. The buildings included two large four-story brick structures, five large storage sheds, and one office building, a concrete mill building, steel storage building, power extension plant, shooting gallery and steel water tank with a capacity of 100,000 gallons. The notes were due in 1927. In 1929 Savage acquired the A.H. Fox Gun company of Philadelphia and moved production to Utica.

In 1939, Savage introduced the Model 24 combination gun (a configuration uncommon in the U.S.), which sold over a million copies. Savage was one of the few American makers of affordable double-barrel shotguns including the Fox Sterlingworth, Fox Model B, and Stevens Model 311 and produced rifles and shotguns under house brand names for large store chains.

===Second World War===

During World War II, Savage turned again to military production, making heavy munitions. Savage made most of the Thompson submachine guns used in World War II. Savage also produced the British No. 4 Lee–Enfield bolt-action rifle; though marked &quot;U.S. PROPERTY,&quot; these rifles were never used by the US military and were instead sent to Britain under the Lend-Lease program. As quality wood was reserved for military gun stock production, Savage produced some Model 24 .22/.410 combo guns and Model 94 single barrel shotguns with stocks molded from Tenite plastic.

===Post-war===
After the war, it produced the model 67 and model 69 pump shotguns, including the model 69N stainless steel tactical pump shotgun. A variety of owners ran the company from the 1960s to the 1980s. Savage eventually ran into financial trouble in 1988 and filed for bankruptcy protection.

In addition to firearms, Savage Arms Corporation also sold power lawn mowers during this period.

===21st century===
In 2002, the company started selling a factory-installed, safe, user-adjustable trigger, called the &quot;AccuTrigger&quot;. The &quot;AccuStock&quot;, an aluminum stock embedded rail system to further enhance action stability and accuracy, was introduced by Savage in 2009.

Savage was named the &quot;Manufacturer of the Year&quot; by the Shooting Industry Academy of Excellence in 2003.

The Savage 93R17 BTVS was awarded the &quot;Best New Rifle&quot; in the &quot;Best of the Best&quot; presentation by &quot;Shooting Times&quot;, &quot;Sporting Gun&quot;, and &quot;Shooting Gazette&quot; magazines May 15, 2007, at the E. J. Churchill Shooting School in the U.K.

Ron Coburn, then chairman and CEO of Savage Sports Corporation was honored by SHOT Business Magazine and Time4Media outdoor media group as their &quot;2007 Man of the Year&quot;. On February 5, 2013, Coburn announced that he was stepping down after a 25-year tenure as chairman and CEO of Savage Sports Corporation. On February 6, 2013, Savage Sports announced the appointment of Ron Johnson as its new Chief Executive Officer. Johnson most recently served as President of the Sporting Group within Alliant Techsystems (&quot;ATK&quot;).

Vista Outdoor markets firearm accessories and ammunition under brands that include Weaver Optics, Federal Premium, Speer Ammo, and Blazer. ATK, the predecessor of Vista Outdoor, announced the purchase of Savage for $315 million on May 13, 2013. With the purchase, Johnson remained with Bowtech Archery, who was not part of the sale, and Al Kasper began tenure as CEO.

As of July 2018, Vista Outdoor was attempting to sell Savage Arms as part of a larger restructuring. Vista Outdoor said that expanding Savage&#x27;s offerings to include handguns was too expensive. As of 2018, Savage Arms&#x27; sales made up just 7% of Vista Outdoor&#x27;s overall business.

As of May 2018, Savage Arms had 367 workers at its factory in Westfield, Massachusetts.

On July 9, 2019, Vista Outdoor completed the sale of Savage Arms and Stevens Arms for $170 million to a group of investors led by Savage&#x27;s management. Vista received immediate gross proceeds of $158 million and a $12-million five-year note. Vista said it will use this money, after paying associated taxes, to reduce its debt.

===Shotguns===
The S1200 is the first semi-automatic shotgun sold under the Stevens brand. The S1200 uses an inertia-driven action that uses the recoil force of the gun to cycle shells. The S1200 weighs 6.8 pounds. Options for 26-inch and 28-inch barrels are available.

As of 2018, Savage sold the 212 (12 gauge) and 220 (20 gauge) model shotguns. These models can be fired accurately at ranges up to 200 yards. This accuracy is mostly due to their bolt-action design. These models use Savage&#x27;s AccuTrigger system to customize trigger pull weight. These models are specifically designed for firing shotgun slugs in addition to bird shot. Both models come with two-round detachable magazines. In 2019, Savage released variants of the 212 and 220 shotguns designed specifically for hunting turkeys.

In 2020 Savage released the &quot;Savage Renegauge&quot; also intended for turkey hunting. It makes use of a &quot;Dual Regulating Inline Valve&quot; in order to reduce the recoil. The gun weighs 8lbs and was released at a suggested price of $1,550. 

===Rimfire rifles===
====Model 64====

The Model 64 series is a semi-automatic .22 LR rifle made in Lakefield, Ontario, Canada. It operates on a simple blowback action. It is targeted towards beginning shooters, small game hunters, and budget-minded plinking. It is one of the most popular plinkers in the United States due to high accuracy, being chambered in cheap, common, and readily available .22 Long Rifle, and the low price. It is unusual among semiautomatic 22s, and traditional (non-bullpup) semiautomatic rifles in general, in that it is available in a true left-handed version (left handed safety, charging handle, and ejector).

====A Series====
The A Series is a new family of semi-automatic rimfire rifles aimed to replace/compete with the aging Model 64 series.

*A17
:The A17 is a semi-automatic rimfire rifle that uses .17 HMR ammunition. CCI, another Vista Outdoor subsidiary, specially engineered ammunition for the A17 in cooperation with Savage to overcome safety and functioning problems associated with more powerful small caliber rimfire ammunition being used in blowback semi-automatic weapons. This rifle also uses the unique Savage delayed blowback system. It uses Savage&#x27;s unique user-adjustable AccuTrigger system that allows the pressure need to affect a trigger pull to be changed. The safety blocks both the hammer and trigger and locks the bolt open when depressed. In an &quot;American Rifleman&quot; review, Mark Keefe praised the A17, which Savage designed around the .17 HMR, rather than adapting a rifle to it, while also remaining competitively priced.

:In early 2016, Savage released the A17 Sporter, A17 Target Sporter, and A17 Target Sporter Thumbhole variants. The Sporter and Target Sporter have heavy barrels and gray wood-laminate stocks. The Thumbhole has a heavy fluted barrel and a gray wood-laminate thumbhole stock. The A17 was named Rifle of the Year in the NRA Publications&#x27; 2016 Golden Bullseye Awards.

*A22
:The A22 is a semi-automatic rimfire rifle that uses the .22 Long Rifle ammunition. It comes with a 10-round rotary magazine and uses Savage&#x27;s patented AccuTrigger. The standard model A22 comes with a 21&quot; carbon steel barrel with iron sights, but also comes with sightless 22&quot; stainless steel barrel (FSS) or 22&quot; carbon steel varmint barrel (Pro Varmint or Target Thumbhole). It was created to compete with other popular .22 semi-automatic rifle models, including the Marlin 795, Remington 597 and Ruger 10/22.

*A22 Magnum
:The A22 Magnum is a semi-automatic rimfire rifle with a design similar to the A17, but using .22 WMR ammunition. It comes with a 10-round rotary magazine, a steel receiver, and Savage&#x27;s user-adjustable AccuTrigger for changing the trigger pull weight. This rifle also uses the unique Savage delayed blowback system.

==== Model 93 ====
The Model 93 is a series of &quot;magnum&quot; bolt-action rimfire rifles chambered for the .22 WMR ammunition and its neck-down derivative caliber .17 HMR.
* Model 93
* Model 93R17

==== Mark II Series ====

The Mark II Series is a family of bolt-action rimfire rifles chambered mainly for the .22 LR ammunition, as well as the .17 HM2 for its FV varmint model.

==== B Series ====

The B Series is a new family of bolt-action rimfire rifles introduced in 2017 to replace/compete with the old Mark II series, chambered for the .17 HMR, .22 LR and the .22 WMR ammunitions.
* B17
* B22
* B22 Magnum

==== Rascal ====
Rascal is a bolt-action single-shot rimfire rifle chambered for .22 LR ammunition.

===Combination guns===
In 2016, Savage arms introduced the Model 42 Takedown combination gun. It breaks down via a one-button, one-push mechanism. The over and under barrels are 20&quot; long. The top barrel fires .22 LR or .22 WMR rimfire ammunition, while the bottom barrel fires .410 bore shotgun shells. The lower barrel is chambered for 3&quot; shells, allowing the use of both 3&quot; and 2.5&quot; birdshot, buckshot, slugs, and self-defense rounds. The rifle barrel on top has open sights. The Model 42 has a black, matte, synthetic stock.

===Bolt-action rifles===
====Model 110====

The Model 110 is a repeating bolt-action rifle. The Model 110 was designed by Nicholas L. Brewer in 1958 and was patented posthumously in 1963. It has been in continuous production since that time, and with the closing of Winchester&#x27;s New Haven, Connecticut, plant in 2007, the Model 110 has passed the Winchester Model 70 as the oldest continuously manufactured bolt-action rifle in America.

In 2018, Savage released the Model 110 Tactical variant. It can be chambered in .308 Winchester, 6.5mm Creedmoor, 6mm Creedmoor, and 300 Winchester Magnum. The Tactical variant includes Savage&#x27;s AccuFit system allowing shooters to customize the comb height and length-of-pull.

====Model 10FP and Model 110FP====
The Savage 10FP is a bolt-action rifle based on the Model 110 rifle. There are seven variants of this rifle, each designated with an &quot;LE&quot; code signifying that it is part of the Law Enforcement Series. Most 10FP series rifles are configured with AccuTrigger, matte-blued barreled action, heavy free-floating and button-rifled barrel, oversized bolt handle, an internal box magazine (holding four rounds), and three swivel studs for sling and bipod mounting. The Savage 10FP is similar to the Savage 110FP rifle and differ only in the action lengths and in the calibers used. The 10FP is&quot;short action,&quot; using cartridges similar in length to the .308 Winchester. The 110FP is considered a &quot;long action,&quot; meaning it uses cartridges similar in length to the .30-06 Springfield. Both are bolt-action, rotating bolt rifles, with dual-lug bolts and integral, non-detachable magazines, and both are available in left-handed models.

====Model 10/110====

The Predator Hunter Max 1 has a fluted carbon steel barrel and synthetic stock finished in a camouflage pattern. It comes in variants chambered with .204 Ruger, 22-250 Remington, .223 Remington, .243 Remington, .260 Remington, 6.5 Creedmoor and .308 Winchester. All variants have a 24-inch barrels, except the .223 which has a 22-inch barrel. Accustock, AccuTrigger, a soft rubber recoil pad, a three-position safety, and a four-round magazine are all included.

====Model 11/111====
The Hog Hunter variant chambered in 338 Winchester Magnum, is a bolt-action rifle designed for hunting wild boar. It is a variant of the Model 11/111 design. Models are available for short-action .223 Remington and .308 Winchester, .338 Federal, and .350 Legend cartridges. It has a 20-inch, medium-contour, heavy barrel with a threaded end. The Hog Hunter comes standard with v-notch iron sights. The AccuTrigger allows the shooter to adjust the strength required for a trigger pull. The Hog Hunter weighs about seven pounds.

The Long Ranger Hunter variant is available chambered in .260 Remington, .300 Winchester, .338 Federal, .338 Lapua Magnum, 6.5 Creedmoor, 6.5 x .284 Norma, and 7mm Remington. All versions except the Lapua Magnum have 26-inch carbon steel barrels with an adjustable muzzle brake, which can be twisted open or closed. Except for the .338 Lapua Magnum, each version has hinged metal floorplates. The Lapua Magnum has a fixed muzzle brake and a detachable box magazine. The receiver is drilled and tapped for mounting a scope. AccuStock and AccuTrigger come standard. The weight of the Long Range Hunter varies from 8.4 pounds to 9.25 pounds depending on how it is chambered.

====Other variants====
The Model 112 Magnum Target rifle is a single-shot bolt-action rifle for long-range shooters. It chambers 338 Lapua Magnum cartridges. It is built around the Magnum Target Action, has a pillar-bedded 26-inch heavy barrel, and uses the Target AccuTrigger system for adjusting the amount of force necessary to affect a trigger pull. The Target AccuTrigger can be adjusted by the shooter to require a pull as low as six ounces. The Model 112 weights 12 pounds and is 49.8 inches long.

The Lightweight Hunter weighs only 5.65 pounds. Savage achieved this weight by using a light-contour 20-inch barrel, spiral-fluting the bolt, machining excess metal from the receiver as well as milling cuts in the stock. Weight is also saved by using a polymer-bottom detachable four-round box magazine. Variants are available in .223 Remington, .243 Remington, .270 Winchester, .308 Winchester, and 7mm-08 Remington. The barrel has a matte finish. The stock is oil-finished walnut. The total length of the rifle is 40.25 inches. AccuTrigger is included.

The Model 116 has variants chambered for .338 Winchester and .375 Ruger. It has a 20-inch stainless steel barrel and a stainless action. The receiver is drilled and tapped for mounting a scope. It comes standard with adjustable LPA open sights. The stock is a black polymer. The bolt hand is oversized so that it can be used while wearing gloves. An internal box magazine holds three rounds. The overall length of the rifle is 41.5 inches. It weighs 7.6 pounds. Savage&#x27;s standard three-position safety and AccuTrigger system come standard.

The BA Stealth was named one of &quot;American Hunter&#x27;s&quot; &quot;Top New Rifles&quot; for 2016. The BA Stealth can be chambered in .308 Winchester. It has a solid aluminum chassis and an adjustable polymer stock. It includes the AccuTrigger system. The Axis II XP Stainless is bolt-action hunting rifle with a stainless barreled action and a bore-sighted Weaver scope. It is made in eight common calibers. It includes AccuTrigger. It was named one of &quot;American Hunter&#x27;s&quot; &quot;Top New Rifles&quot; for 2016.

====Axis II XP====
The Axis II XP line of rifles come with Bushnell Banner scopes and are chambered in a variety of ammunition. The stock is synthetic. The barrel is mated to the receiver with thread-in headspacing. This allows for precision fabrication while keeping costs down. The use of a floating bolt head also maintains precision while helping to keep the rifle affordable. The Axis II XP has a four-round magazine and weights approximately 6.8 pounds. The barrel length is 22 inches.

====Impulse====
A fully ambidextrous straight-pull bolt-action rifle introduced in early 2021 with a variety of calibers and models.

===Modern sporting rifles===
====MSR-15 and variants====
MSR-15 variants are all modern sporting rifles based on the AR platform.

Savage released the MSR-15 Recon LRP in 2018. It has an adjustable gas block and an 18-inch-long barrel that make it suitable for use at long range. The gas block can be customized for use with specific kinds of ammunition. Variants come chambered in 6.8 SPC, 22 Nosler, and .224 Valkyrie. The rifle has an extended length of 38.5 inches and a collapsed length of 35.25 inches. The rifle weighs 7.5 pounds.

Savage released the MSR-15 Long Range in 2018. The most salient feature of this variant is its 22-inch barrel. The barrel length was chosen to achieve maximum accuracy with .224 Valkyrie ammunition from long range.

====Left-handed firearms====
Specialty guns are the primary focus of Savage Arms&#x27; business. All of its product offerings fulfill a special need. Weapons designed for left-handed shooters are a good example of this. 

Savage was the first major manufacturer to produce a left-handed hunting rifle in significant quantities, starting in 1959. 

Savage Arms sells 18 different firearms for left-handed shooters with products designed for big game, law enforcement, target competition, and predator hunting, including left-handed slug shotguns and bolt-action and semi-auto rimfire rifles. Savage generally releases its products as right-handed models with a left-handed version to follow a few years later. Models not available with a stock left-handed version can usually be made to order. Savage can convert most of its products to left-handed versions because most of its receivers, bolt releases, and safeties are designed symmetrically. Savage can easily convert its products&#x27; designs by changing the bolt assembly and moving the ejection port to the opposite side, but most of its competitors have to design completely new receivers. Savage&#x27;s machine tools are likewise set up to quickly and easily switch from producing right-handed products to left-handed ones and back again.

===Discontinued products===

Since Savage is one of the older American arms companies still in commercial production, it would be difficult to list the number of models no longer in production made by Savage under its own name and under tradenames for retail outlets. Those most notable and still in wide use today include:
*Shotguns
**Stevens Model 520 Shotguns
** Stevens Model 620 Shotguns
**Model 720
**Model 745
**Model 67
**Model 69
*Rifles
**Savage Model 23AA Sporter
**Savage Model 99
**Savage Model 1920
*Combination guns
**Savage Model 24
*Light machine guns
**M1917 Lewis gun (2,500 in .30-06 Springfield, 1,050 in .303 British)

====Ammunition====
For most of its history, Savage made ammunition as well as firearms. Savage marketed a wide variety of calibers. The .303 Savage, .22 Savage Hi-Power, .250-3000 Savage, and .300 Savage are some of the more important ammunition types sold by the firm.

==Operations in Canada==
Savage Arms&#x27; Canadian operations began as an independent enterprise called Lakefield Arms. It was founded in 1969 in Lakefield, Ontario where it remains as of 2020. The company was formed partially in response to the closure of a boat factory in the same town. The founding partners thought the laid-off factory workers&#x27; skills would be readily transferable to gun making. During its first year of operations, Lakefield Arms produced two different .22 caliber rifles for the Canadian market. The Mark II was a bolt-action rifle with a 10-round removable magazine. The Mark III was a semi-automatic rifle that also had a 10-round removable magazine. Both had wooden stocks. As of 2019, these designs were still the basis for the companies best-selling products.

In 1973, Lakefield Arms moved into a new factory on 2.5-acre parcel of land the company had purchased near Water Street in the same town. As of 2019, it remains at the same locations. 90 to 140 people are usually employed at this site depending on demand and the time of year. Savage Arms purchased Lakefield Arms in 1995.

According to company officials, the Canadian division of Savage Arms exports 97 percent of its rifles, mostly to the U.S, as of 1997. In an interview with a local newspaper reporter in 2019, a senior company official said that 200,000 to 300,000 guns per year are manufactured at Lakefield. The same official said roughly 85 percent of its output is exported to the United States, 5 percent is exported to other countries, and 10 percent is sold within Canada.

<doc id="732605" wikidata="Q1064272" url="?curid=732605" title="Kyōka Izumi">
<text>, known by his pen name , was a Japanese novelist, writer and kabuki playwright who was active during the prewar period.

Kyōka&#x27;s writing differed greatly from that of the naturalist writers who dominated the literary scene at the time. Many of Kyōka&#x27;s works are surrealist critiques of society. He is best known for a characteristic brand of Romanticism preferring tales of the supernatural heavily influenced by works of the earlier Edo period in Japanese arts and letters, which he tempered with his own personal vision of aesthetics and art in the modern age.

He is also considered one of the supreme stylists in modern Japanese literature, and the difficulty and richness of his prose has been frequently noted by fellow authors and critics. Like Natsume Sōseki and other Japanese authors with pen names, Kyōka is usually known by his pen name rather than his real given name.

==Life==
=== Before Tokyo ===
Kyōka was born Izumi Kyōtarō on November 4, 1873 in the Shitashinmachi section of Kanazawa, Ishikawa, to , a chaser and inlayer of metallic ornaments, and , daughter of a &quot;tsuzumi&quot; hand-drum player from Edo and younger sister to lead protagonist of the Noh theater, Kintarō Matsumoto. Because of his family&#x27;s impoverished circumstances, he attended the tuition-free Hokuriku English-Japanese School, run by Christian missionaries.

Even before he entered grade school, young Kyōtarō&#x27;s mother introduced him to literature in picture-books interspersed with text called &quot;kusazōshi,&quot; and his works would later show the influence of this early contact with such visual forms of story-telling. In April 1883, at nine years old, Kyōka lost his mother, who was 29 at the time. It was a great blow to his young mind, and he would attempt to recreate memories of her in works throughout his literary career.

In 1890, Kyōka went to Tokyo in order to follow the footsteps of Ozaki Kōyō, a literary figure of this time. From 1891-1894 Kyōka lived with Ozaki Kōyō and performed houseboy duties for him in return for his expertise opinions on his work. Kyōka was deeply impressed by Ozaki Kōyō&#x27;s &quot;Amorous Confessions of Two Nuns&quot; and decided to pursue a career in literature. That June he took a trip to Toyama Prefecture. At this time he worked as a teacher in private preparatory schools and spent his free time running through &quot;yomihon&quot; and &quot;kusazōshi&quot;. In November of that year, however, Kyōka&#x27;s aspiration to an artistic career drove him to Tokyo, where he intended to enter the tutelage of Kōyō himself.

On 19 November 1891, he called on Kōyō in ) (part of present-day Shinjuku) without prior introduction and requested that he be allowed into the school immediately. He was accepted, and from that time began life as a live-in apprentice. Other than a brief trip to Kanazawa in December of the following year, Kyōka spent all of his time in the Ozaki household, proving his value to Kōyō through correcting his manuscripts and household tasks. Kyōka greatly adored his teacher, thinking of him as a teacher of more than literature, a benefactor who nourished his early career before he gained a name for himself. He felt deeply a personal indebtedness to Kōyō, and continued to admire the author throughout his life.

===Early career===

Kyōka&#x27;s first published work, , was serialized beginning in May 1893 in Kyoto&#x27;s &quot;Hi no De&quot; newspaper. Apparently it was very unpopular and the editor requested the story be dropped immediately; however, due to Kōyō&#x27;s pleadings on the part of his young student, Kyōka was allowed to print the entire story. The next year the story was resold to the Kaga, Ishikawa &quot;Hokuriku Shinpo&quot;, once again for serialization. This time Kyōka&#x27;s work gained some favorable criticism, though most likely through Kōyō&#x27;s active involvement.

In that same year, was published by &quot;Tantei Bunko&quot; and by &quot;Shonen Bungaku&quot;. In August he returned to Kanazawa to get treatment for beriberi and took the opportunity to travel around Kyoto and the Hokuriku region before returning to Tokyo. He would later use the record he kept of his travels as a basis for his , though the actual record is not extant.

January 9 of 1894, his father died and he once again returned to Kanazawa. Facing an uncertain future, Kyōka worried about his means of obtaining a livelihood for himself and his relatives, a grandmother and younger brother; however, with his grandmother&#x27;s encouragement he returned to his work in Tokyo. In October, he published and , after substantial corrections from Kōyō, in the &quot;Yomiuri Shimbun&quot;. &quot;The Righteous and the Chivalrous&quot; would later be staged as .

The next year in February, in order to continue to support his family in Kanazawa, Kyōka moved into the Otowa Ohashi household in Koishikawa in Tokyo to follow work on an encyclopedia. On his departure, Kōyō treated Kyōka to a Western style dinner where he taught his student to use a knife and fork.

In April 1895, Kyōka&#x27;s first, real critical success, , was published in the magazine &quot;Bungei Kurabu&quot;. Thanks to Reiun Taoka&#x27;s praise of the story, Kyōka&#x27;s next work, , appeared in &quot;Bungei Kurabu&#x27;s&quot; opening pages; thus began Kyōka&#x27;s entry into literary circles.

In May 1896, Kyōka paid his grandmother, now in her mid-seventies, a visit in Kanazawa, and the next year he decided to get his own house in Koishikawa and bring her to live with him. In spite of the beriberi that had not completely healed over the years, he was prolific at this time, though his work received mixed reviews. &quot;,&quot; considered by many to be his most representative work and one of his most frequently read, was published in 1900.

===Mature writer===
In 1902, suffering from gastrointestinal problems, Kyōka retired to Zushi to convalesce. While there, a woman named , whom Kyōka had met through a childhood friend, helped him in the kitchen. In May 1903, the two began living together in Ushigome, in a &quot;hanamachi&quot; called Kagurazaka. However, they were unable to get married immediately due to strong objections by Kōyō.

In October of that same year, Kyōka&#x27;s mentor, Ozaki Kōyō, died. Even on his deathbed, Kōyō continued to worry over Kyōka&#x27;s future, and he continued to correct Kyōka&#x27;s manuscripts. Then, in 1906, Kyōka lost his grandmother at the age of 87. His stomach troubles worsened and he returned to Zushi. Originally intending only to spend a summer there, he rented the house for four years. During this time he ate mainly rice gruel and sweet potatoes. In spite of illness that often left him in a dream-like state and a house that leaked when it rained, he managed to compose several stories there, including . In fact, his illness and the poor conditions at his rented house in Zushi might have contributed to the story&#x27;s other-worldly atmosphere. In 1908, he went back to Tokyo and found a place in Kōjimachi.

Both and were published in 1910. Kafū Nagai praised &quot;Samisen Canal.&quot; At the same time, the first five volumes of Kyōka&#x27;s collected works were published.With growing popularity supporting him, Kyōka began the Taishō period by extending his efforts into the theater. In 1913, he composed and , and the next year, was published.

He continued to have problems with beriberi, and in the summer of 1916, he spent a good portion of three months inside.

===Final years===
In 1927, Kyōka traveled to the Tōhoku region, where he visited Lake Towada and Akita Prefecture. The next year, he contracted pneumonia and, after recovery, visited Shuzenji hot-spring resort in the mountains in Izu, Shizuoka Prefecture. Then in 1929 he returned to Ishikawa prefecture, this time to visit the scenic Noto Peninsula.

He kept a number of journals of his travels, and he continued to write short stories and plays. In 1937, his last great project, was serialized in the &quot;Tokyo Mainichi&quot; and &quot;Osaka Mainichi&quot; newspapers. He was inducted the same year into the Imperial Arts Society.

Finally his ill-health took its toll, and, on 7 September 1939, at 2:45 in the morning, Izumi Kyōka died of lung cancer. He is buried at Zōshigaya Cemetery in Tokyo.

==Legacy==

Eccentric and superstitious, Kyōka developed a reputation for writing about the grotesque and the fantastic. However, he did not use fantasy to escape from what was happening in the real world, but for criticizing it. Kyōka saw humans through the lens &quot;of evolutionary regression, whether man into beast or adult into child,&quot; indicative of his critique of modern society.,&quot; is a tale about a monk&#x27;s journey through a mountainous wilderness, encountering inexplicable and unsettling experiences. Borrowing and embellishing themes from Edo-period popular fiction, folklore and Noh drama, more than half of Kyōka&#x27;s works incorporate some form of supernatural element as well as apparent symbolism in the form of explicit color coding. &quot;The Ruby&quot;, first published and performed in 1913, daringly applies this chain of color-coded images to tell a beautifully poetic story of adultery, eroticism, and jealousy. Kyōka&#x27;s narrative style borrows from traditional rakugo storytelling, and also uses dramatic dialogues similar to that used in kabuki drama. Kyōka often depicted life in the hanamachi of downtown Edo or Tokyo, which is why he is often compared with his contemporaries Nagai Kafū and Tanizaki Jun&#x27;ichirō. However, Kyōka makes much more use of a complex plot and suspense in his narrative. Another thematic concept strong in his writings is that of a beautiful older woman taking care of a young man.

His plays are particularly popular in Japan: such works as , , and are performed regularly. This was not always the case, however, as few of his plays were performed while he was alive. His plays only became popular in the 1950s, but some scholars attribute his lasting impact to dramatizations and adaptations of his prose fiction, usually done by other authors.

The Izumi Kyōka Prize for Literature is a literary award established by the city of Kanazawa, first awarded in 1973 on the hundredth anniversary of Kyōka&#x27;s birth.

<text>The Tennessee Theatre is a movie palace in the downtown core of Knoxville, Tennessee, United States. The theater was built in 1928 in the 1908 Burwell Building, considered Knoxville&#x27;s first skyscraper. The theater and Burwell Building were added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1982, and the theater was extensively restored in the early 2000s. The Tennessee Theatre currently focuses on hosting performing arts events and classic films, and is home to the Knoxville Opera and the Knoxville Symphony Orchestra. The theater is managed by AC Entertainment.

==Performances==
The Tennessee Theatre offers a wide range of performing arts events and classic films to the public. The theater is managed by AC Entertainment and is home to the Knoxville Opera, and the Knoxville Symphony Orchestra.

=== Broadway at the Tennessee ===
After the failed &quot;Broadway in Knoxville&quot; series at the Knoxville Civic Coliseum finally came to an end due to a lack of profit, quality &#x27;Broadway-style&#x27; entertainment was transferred to the Tennessee Theatre for a 2008-2009 season. The series, now presented by the Tennessee Theatre, was renamed &quot;Broadway at the Tennessee&quot; and kicked off with Fred Ebb&#x27;s &quot;Chicago&quot;. Productions at The Tennessee Theatre included &quot;Movin&#x27; Out, Hairspray, Jesus Christ Superstar, Sweeney Todd&quot;, and &quot;Stomp.&quot;

==History==
In the 1790s, the lot now occupied by the Burwell building was home to a two-story log structure where the classes of Blount College — the forerunner of the University of Tennessee — were first held.

Clay Brown Atkin funded many buildings&#x27; construction and was claimed to be the biggest mantel manufacturer in the world. Atkin set his attention on the Knoxville Banking &amp; Trust Building, a 10-story steel frame building on the corner of Gay Street and Clinch Avenue. The building was completed in 1908, and at the time it was Knoxville&#x27;s tallest building and first considered a skyscraper. The Knoxville Banking &amp; Trust Building became a prestigious address for Knoxville professionals, and in 1917, Atkin bought the building and honorarily named it after his wife, Mary Burwell (1871-1949). Measuring in height, the Burwell was Knoxville&#x27;s tallest building until the completion of the Holston in 1913.

The theater first opened on October 1, 1928, and with about 2,000 seats in the auditorium, it was billed as &quot;Knoxville&#x27;s Grand Entertainment Palace&quot;. It was designed by Chicago architects Graven &amp; Mayger in the Spanish-Moorish style, although the design incorporates elements from all parts of the world: Czechoslovakian crystals in the French-style chandeliers, Italian terrazzo flooring in the Grand Lobby, and Oriental influences in the carpet and drapery patterns. It was built by George A. Fuller, another Chicago native, who also built the Flatiron Building in New York City. Tennessee Enterprises hired the George A. Fuller Company because of his prominent works in New York City, and his work on the Tennessee proved Fuller&#x27;s expertise. By this point, the theater was turning out to be an almost all-Chicago project, and Fuller broke ground on November 1, 1927. On Christmas Day the &quot;News-Sentinel&quot; reported that the theater was pouring concrete. The theater was one of the first public buildings in Knoxville to have air conditioning, and it also featured a Wurlitzer organ.

During its heyday, the theater played host to a few world movie premieres, including &quot;So This is Love&quot; (1953), and the adaptation of James Agee&#x27;s &quot;All the Way Home&quot; (1963). After a refurbishment in 1966, the theater&#x27;s seating capacity was reduced to 1,545.

The theater changed owners several times over its life, and eventually closed for the first time in 1977. Thereafter it was open and closed intermittently for the remainder of the late 1970s. It was purchased by local radio company Dick Broadcasting in 1981, who started a renovation effort to prepare it for the 1982 World&#x27;s Fair. On April 1, 1982, the theater was placed in the National Register of Historic Places.

===Restoration===

The Historic Tennessee Theatre Foundation was formed in 1996 and Dick Broadcasting donated the theater to the non-profit. It was designated &quot;The Official State Theatre of Tennessee.&quot; In 2001, the Foundation announced a campaign to completely restore and renovate the theater. The $29.3 million project was funded through public and private donations with the help of $6.3 million in tax credits. The theater closed for renovations in June 2003 to completely restore it to its original state.

Renovations included expansions of the stage depth via a cantilever two stories above State street, which accommodated larger and more elaborate productions, a custom orchestra shell to enhance the acoustics of the new larger stage, an enlarged orchestra pit, upgraded dressing room facilities, modernization of the lighting, rigging, and other theatrical equipment, the installations of elevators, and a new marquee. The restorations included new carpets, draperies, and lighting fixtures that duplicated the original designs, and historically accurate restoration of all plaster and paint surfaces throughout the lobby, lounges, foyers, and the auditorium. Integration of acoustic treatments into the restored auditorium and lobby, and a substantially improved exterior sound isolation system were included in the restoration design. Seating capacity is now at 1,645 patrons.

The design team for this renovation effort was led by McCarty Holsaple Architects of Knoxville, Tennessee and included Westlake Reed Leskosky Architects of Cleveland, Ohio (now DLR Group).

The theater reopened on January 14, 2005 and had a near sold-out season. In 2013 the Tennessee Theatre announced the sale of its one millionth ticket since the restoration.

==Mighty Wurlitzer==
The Wurlitzer was installed in the Tennessee Theatre at the time of its opening in 1928. It was built by the Rudolph Wurlitzer Company in North Tonawanda, New York, and cost about $50,000 at the time.

The organist at the Tennessee is always advertised as the star of the show, and the first organist was Miss Jean Wilson, whose name appeared on the marquee alongside early films. Later House Organists include William T. Snyder and current performer Freddie Brabson.

In October 2000, virtually the entire organ was shipped to Reno, Nevada, to master organ rebuilder Ken Crome, who restored the instrument piece by piece. Artisans and craftsmen returned the organ&#x27;s appearance to its original 1928 color scheme and design. The chambers on either side of the stage, which houses the pipes, were replastered to fully ensure the protection and preservation of the restored instrument.

The Wurlitzer returned to Knoxville in August 2001 and was re-installed over the course of the next month. Theater organist Lyn Larsen was involved in the configuration and tonal regulation of the organ, and was the first to publicly perform it at a gala concert on October 1, 2001.

==In popular culture==
Portions of the 1999 film &quot;October Sky&quot; were filmed in and around Knoxville, and the facade of the theater can be seen during a scene in which the main characters go to the movies.

The 2017 film The Last Movie Star starring Burt Reynolds, Clark Duke, Ariel Winter and Chevy Chase was mostly filmed in Knoxville. Several scenes were filmed inside the Tennessee Theatre grand lobby, portrayed as a fictional grand hotel lobby in the film.

<text>The National Endowment for the Humanities (NEH) is an independent federal agency of the U.S. government, established by the National Foundation on the Arts and the Humanities Act of 1965 (), dedicated to supporting research, education, preservation, and public programs in the humanities. The NEH is housed in the Constitution Center at 400 7th St SW, Washington, D.C. From 1979 to 2014, NEH was at 1100 Pennsylvania Avenue, N.W., Washington, D.C., in the Nancy Hanks Center at the Old Post Office.

==History and purpose==
The NEH provides grants for high-quality humanities projects to cultural institutions such as museums, archives, libraries, colleges, universities, public television, and radio stations, and to individual scholars. According to its mission statement: &quot;Because democracy demands wisdom, NEH serves and strengthens our republic by promoting excellence in the humanities and conveying the lessons of history to all Americans.&quot; 

The NEH was created in 1965 as a sub-agency of the National Foundation on the Arts and the Humanities, which today also includes the National Endowment for the Arts, the Institute of Museum and Library Services, and the Federal Council on the Arts and the Humanities. NEH was based upon recommendation of the National Commission on the Humanities, convened in 1963 with representatives from three US scholarly and educational associations, the Phi Beta Kappa Society, the American Council of Learned Societies (ACLS), and the Council of Graduate Schools.

The agencies stated purpose is to create incentives for excellent work in the humanities by:
* awarding grants that strengthen teaching and learning in the humanities in schools and colleges
* facilitate research and original scholarship
* provide opportunities for lifelong learning
* preserve and provide access to cultural and educational resources
* strengthen the institutional base of the humanities. 
As part of its mandate to support humanities programs in every US state and territory, the agency supports a network of private, nonprofit affiliates, the 56 humanities councils in the states and territories of the United States.

===Jim Leach leadership, 2009–2013===
The ninth NEH chair was Jim Leach. President Obama nominated the former Iowa congressman, a Republican, to chair the NEH on June 3, 2009; the Senate confirmed his appointment in August 2009. Leach began his term as the NEH chair on August 12, 2009, and stepped down in May 2013. Between November 2009 and May 2011, Leach conducted the American &quot;Civility Tour&quot; to call attention to the need to restore reason and civility back into politics, a goal that in his words was &quot;central to the humanities.&quot; Leach visited each of the 50 states, speaking at venues ranging from university and museum lecture halls to hospitals for veterans, to support the return of non-emotive, civil exchange and rational consideration of other viewpoints. According to Leach, &quot;Little is more important...than establishing an ethos of thoughtfulness and decency of expression in the public square. Words reflect emotion as well as meaning. They clarify—or cloud—thought and energize action, sometimes bringing out the better angels in our nature, sometimes lesser instincts.&quot;

===William Adams leadership, 2014–2017===
The tenth chair of the NEH was William Adams, who served from 2014 to 2017. President Obama nominated Adams on April 4, 2014; Adams was confirmed by the Senate in a voice vote on July 9, 2014. Adams appointed Margaret (Peggy) Plympton as the deputy NEH chair in January 2015.

Before Adams&#x27;s appointment, the NEH was headed by Acting Chair Carole M. Watson. Adams resigned his appointment on May 23, 2017, when he cited accomplishments under the &quot;Common Good&quot; initiative and the appointment of new administration officials.

===Jon Parrish Peede, 2018–2022===
Appointed under Donald Trump, from 2018 to 2022, Jon Parrish Peede served as Chair of the NEH. On February 10, 2020, the NEH was presented by the Trump administration with a FY2021 budget that included an orderly wind-down of the agency.

===Shelly Lowe===
Plans to close the agency were halted under the Biden administration and the NEH continues to operate and provides funding for various projects. In 2022, Shelly Lowe was confirmed as the chairman of the NEH. She is the first Native American to lead the agency. Congress appropriated US$180 million for the NEH in FY2022, and US$207 million in 2023.

==Leadership and initiatives==
===Governance===
The Endowment is directed by the NEH chair. Advising the chair is the National Council on the Humanities, a board of 26 distinguished private citizens who are appointed by the president and confirmed by the Senate. The National Council members serve staggered six-year terms.

===The NEH chair===
The Endowment is directed by a chair, who has legal authority to approve all recommendations and award grants and cooperative agreements. The chair is nominated by the president and confirmed with the advice and consent of the U.S. Senate. The chair&#x27;s decisions are informed by recommendations from the National Council on the Humanities, peer-reviewers who are selected to read each project proposal submitted to the Endowment, as well as by the Endowment&#x27;s staff.

===National Council on the Humanities===
The council is composed of 27 members, 26 appointed by the president of the United States with the consent of the United States Senate and the chairperson of the NEH, who also serves as chair of the council. The twenty-six appointed by the President are selected from among private citizens of the United States who are recognized for their broad knowledge of, expertise in, or commitment to the humanities, and have established records of distinguished service and scholarship or creativity and in a manner which will provide a comprehensive representation of the views of scholars and professional practitioners in the humanities and of the public throughout the United States. In making these appointments, the President shall give due regard to equitable representation of women, minorities, and individuals with disabilities who are involved in the humanities, and may give consideration to such recommendations as may from time to time be submitted to him by leading national organizations concerned with the humanities.

These are appointed to serve terms of six years. The terms are staggered so a number of terms end January 26 every other year. The members are not eligible for reappointment during the two-year period following the expiration of their term. However, they may continue to serve on the council after their term&#x27;s expiration until a successor takes office. Fourteen members of the council constitutes a quorum.

===Current council members===
The current council members :
===Nominations===
President Biden has nominated the following to fill seats on the commission. They await Senate confirmation.
===Major program offices===
The NEH has six grant-making divisions and offices:

* The Division of Preservation and Access awards grants to preserve, maintain, and improve access to primary sources in the humanities, in both digital and analog form.
* The Division of Public Programs supports projects that bring the humanities to large audiences through libraries and museums, television and radio, historic sites, and digital media.
* The Division of Research makes awards to support the publication of books in and outside the humanities.
* The Division of Education works to support and strengthen teaching of the humanities.
* The Office of Federal/State Partnership collaborates with 56 state and territory humanities councils to strengthen local programs.
* The Office of Digital Humanities advises on use of technology in the humanities and coordinates, and was established in 2008.

The Office of Challenge Grants, dissolved in 2017, administered grants intended to support capacity building and encourage fundraising in humanities institutions. The Division of Preservation and Access now offers a grant program that is similar to previous programs in the Challenge Grants office.

===Special initiatives===
These are special priorities of the endowment that indicate critical areas of the humanities as identified by the NEH chair. They differ from the divisions of the endowment in that they do not sponsor or coordinate specific grant programs.

====Bridging Cultures initiative====
Bridging Cultures was an NEH initiative that explored ways the humanities promote understanding and mutual respect for people with diverse histories, cultures, and perspectives. Projects supported through this initiative focused on cultures globally as well as within the United States.

====Standing Together====
This initiative, launched in 2014, marks a priority to make awards that promote understanding of the military experience and to support returning veterans.

====We the People====
&quot;We the People&quot; was an NEH special funding stream initiated by NEH chair Coles, using dedicated funds available to each chair of the NEH, which was designed to encourage and enhance the teaching, study, and understanding of American history, culture, and democratic principles. The initiative supports projects and programs that explore significant events and themes in American nation&#x27;s history, which advance knowledge of the principles that define America.

According to NEH, the initiative led a renaissance in knowledge about American history and principles among all US citizens. The initiative was launched on Constitution Day, September 17, 2002, and active through 2009.

==Notable projects==
Since 1965, the NEH has sponsored many projects, including:
* &quot;Treasures of Tutankhamen&quot;, an exhibition seen by more than 1.5 million people.
* &quot;The Civil War&quot;, a 1990 documentary by Ken Burns seen by 38 million Americans.
* Library of America, editions of novels, essays, and poems celebrating America&#x27;s literary heritage.
* United States Newspaper Project, an effort that cataloged and microfilmed 63.3 million pages of newspapers dating from the early United States. The program now digitizes newspapers and makes them available through Chronicling America, a web resource maintained by the Library of Congress.
* Fifteen Pulitzer Prize–winning books, including those by James M. McPherson, Louis Menand, Joan D. Hedrick, and Bernard Bailyn.
* EDSITEment, a Web project bringing the &quot;best of the humanities on the web&quot; to teachers and students, started in 1997.
* Reference archives, in Athens and Boston, of archaeological photographs taken by Eleanor Emlen Myers.
* The Valley of the Shadow, a digital history project created by Edward L. Ayers and William G. Thomas III on the experience of Confederate Civil War soldiers in the United States.
* What&#x27;s on the Menu, digitization and community-sourced transcription of New York Public Library&#x27;s restaurant menu collection.
*Katherine Anne Porter at 100, a conference at the University of Maryland featuring presentations on Porter and her work, film screenings, and exhibits containing items from Porter&#x27;s papers.

==Awards==

===Jefferson Lecture===

Since 1972 the NEH has sponsored the Jefferson Lecture in the Humanities, which it describes as &quot;the highest honor the federal government confers for distinguished intellectual achievement in the humanities.&quot; The Jefferson Lecturer is selected each year by the National Council on the Humanities. The honoree delivers a lecture in Washington, D.C., during the spring, and receives an honorarium of $10,000. The stated purpose of the honor is to recognize &quot;an individual who has made significant scholarly contributions in the humanities and who has the ability to communicate the knowledge and wisdom of the humanities in a broadly appealing way.&quot;

===National Humanities Medal and Charles Frankel Prize===

The National Humanities Medal, inaugurated in 1997, honors individuals or groups whose work has deepened the nation&#x27;s understanding of the humanities, broadened citizens&#x27; engagement with the humanities, or helped preserve and expand Americans&#x27; access to important resources in the humanities. Up to 12 medals can be awarded each year. From 1989 to 1996 the NEH awarded a similar prize known as the Charles Frankel Prize. The new award, a bronze medallion, was designed by David Macaulay, the 1995 winner of the Frankel Prize. Lists of the winners of the National Humanities Medal and the Frankel Prize are available at the NEH website.

==&quot;Humanities&quot; magazine==
Starting in 1969, the NEH published a periodical called &quot;Humanities&quot;; that original incarnation was discontinued in 1978. In 1980, &quot;Humanities&quot; magazine was relaunched (). It is published six times per year, with one cover article each year dedicated to profiling that year&#x27;s Jefferson Lecturer. Most of its articles have some connection to NEH activities. The magazine&#x27;s editor since 2007 has been journalist and author David Skinner. From 1990 until her death in 2007, &quot;Humanities&quot; was edited by Mary Lou Beatty (who had previously been a high-ranking editor at the &quot;Washington Post&quot;).

<doc id="732614" wikidata="Q2177169" url="?curid=732614" title="Molinism">
<text>Molinism, named after 16th-century Spanish Jesuit theologian Luis de Molina, is the thesis that God has middle knowledge (or &quot;scientia media&quot;): the knowledge of counterfactuals, particularly counterfactuals regarding human action. It seeks to reconcile the apparent tension of divine providence and human free will. Prominent contemporary Molinists include William Lane Craig, Alfred Freddoso, Alvin Plantinga, Michael Bergmann, Thomas Flint, Kenneth Keathley, Dave Armstrong, John D. Laing, Timothy A. Stratton, Kirk R. MacGregor, and J.P. Moreland.

== God&#x27;s types of knowledge ==

According to Kenneth Keathley, author of &quot;Salvation and Sovereignty: A Molinist Approach,&quot; Molinists argue that God perfectly accomplishes His will in the lives of genuinely free creatures through the use of His omniscience. Molinists, following Luis de Molina himself, present God&#x27;s knowledge in a sequence of three logical moments.

The first is God&#x27;s knowledge of necessary truths or natural knowledge. These truths are independent of God&#x27;s will and are non-contingent. This knowledge includes the full range of logical possibilities. Examples include such statements as &quot;All bachelors are unmarried&quot; or &quot;X cannot be A and non-A at the same time, in the same way, at the same place&quot; or &quot;It is possible that X obtain.&quot;

The second is God&#x27;s free knowledge. This type of knowledge consists of contingent truths that are dependent upon God&#x27;s will, or truths that God brings about. Examples include statements such as &quot;God created the earth&quot; or something particular about this world which God has actualized. Free knowledge encompasses the future of what will happen.

In between God&#x27;s natural and free knowledge is His &quot;middle knowledge&quot; which contains the range of possible things that would happen given certain circumstances, by which God knows what His free creatures would do in any situation. These are &quot;truths&quot; that do not have to be true, but are true without God being the primary cause of them. In &quot;The Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy&quot;, John D. Laing has provided an example of middle knowledge: &quot;If John Laing were given the opportunity to write an article on middle knowledge for the Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy, he would freely do so.&quot;

Molinists have supported their case scripturally with Christ&#x27;s statement in :

:And you, Capernaum, will you be exalted to heaven? You will be brought down to Hades. For if the mighty works done in you had been done in Sodom, it would have remained until this day.

The Molinist claims that in this example, God knows what His free creatures would choose under hypothetical circumstances, namely that the Sodomites would have responded to Jesus&#x27; miracles and ministry in a way that Sodom would still have been in existence in Jesus&#x27; day, given that hypothetical situation.

Matthew 11:23 contains what is commonly called a counterfactual of creaturely freedom. But counterfactuals are to be distinguished from foreknowledge, and middle knowledge is to be distinguished from God&#x27;s knowledge of counterfactuals (because, for example, Thomists affirm that God has counterfactual knowledge). The Bible contains many examples of foreknowledge such as , where God tells Moses that the Israelites will forsake God after they are delivered from Egypt.

Some opponents of Molinism claim that God&#x27;s foreknowledge and knowledge of counterfactuals are examples of what God is going to actively bring about. That is, when Christ describes the response of the Sodomites in the aforementioned example, God was going to actively bring it about that they would remain until today. Molinists have responded to this objection by noting that scripture contains examples of God&#x27;s foreknowledge of evil acts. For example, the Israelites forsaking God, or Peter&#x27;s denial of Christ, are both examples of what one would call overt acts of sin. Yet, according to opponents of Molinism, God is actively bringing about these overt acts of sin. This is fallacious according to the Molinist. In order for this account of prophecy to be valid all prophecies must be wholly good, and never contain evil acts; but this is not what opponents believe to be the case. It may simply be the fact that Christ&#x27;s human nature made a rational prediction of the said actions, as he once experienced beforehand from Peter, to which he replied, &quot;Get thee behind me Satan&quot;.

Molinists believe that God has knowledge not only of necessary truths and contingent truths, but also of counterfactuals. [God&#x27;s knowledge of counterfactuals is often referred to as his &quot;middle knowledge&quot;, although the term technically encompasses more than just the knowledge of counterfactuals.] A counterfactual is a statement of the form &quot;If it were the case that P, it would be the case that Q.&quot; An example would be, &quot;If Bob were in Tahiti he would freely choose to go swimming instead of sunbathing.&quot; The Molinist claims that even if Bob is never in Tahiti, God can still know whether Bob would go swimming or sunbathing. The Molinist believes that God, using his middle knowledge and foreknowledge, surveyed all possible worlds and then actualized a particular one. God&#x27;s middle knowledge of counterfactuals would play an integral part in this &quot;choosing&quot; of a particular world.

Molinists say the logical ordering of events for creation would be as follows:

#God&#x27;s natural knowledge of necessary truths.
#God&#x27;s middle knowledge (including counterfactuals).
#:—Creation of the World—
#God&#x27;s free knowledge (the actual ontology of the world).

Hence, God&#x27;s middle knowledge plays an important role in the actualization of the world. In fact, it seems as if God&#x27;s middle knowledge of counterfactuals plays a more immediate role in perception than God&#x27;s foreknowledge. William Lane Craig points out that &quot;without middle knowledge, God would find himself, so to speak, with knowledge of the future but without any logical prior planning of the future.&quot; The placing of God&#x27;s middle knowledge between God&#x27;s knowledge of necessary truths and God&#x27;s creative decree is crucial. For if God&#x27;s middle knowledge was &quot;after&quot; his decree of creation, then God would be actively causing what various creatures would do in various circumstances and thereby destroying libertarian freedom. But by placing middle knowledge (and thereby counterfactuals) &quot;before&quot; the creation decree God allows for freedom in the libertarian sense. The placing of middle knowledge logically after necessary truths, but before the creation decree also gives God the possibility to survey possible worlds and decide which world to actualize.

Craig gives three reasons for holding that counterfactual statements are true: &quot;First, we ourselves often appear to know such true counterfactuals. Second, it is plausible that the Law of Conditional Excluded Middle (LCEM) holds for counterfactuals of a certain special form, usually called &#x27;counterfactuals of creaturely freedom&#x27;. Third, the Scriptures are replete with counterfactual statements, so that the Christian theist, at least, should be committed to the truth of certain counterfactuals about free, creaturely actions.&quot;

== Theological implications ==

William Lane Craig calls Molinism &quot;one of the most fruitful theological ideas ever conceived. For it would serve to explain not only God&#x27;s knowledge of the future, but divine providence and predestination as well&quot;. Under it, God retains a measure of divine providence without hindering humanity&#x27;s freedom. Since God has middle knowledge, He knows what an agent would freely do in a particular situation. So, agent A, if placed in circumstance C, would freely choose option X over option Y. Thus, if God wanted to accomplish X, all God would do is, using his middle knowledge, actualize the world in which A was placed in C, and A would freely choose X. God retains an element of providence without nullifying A&#x27;s choice and God&#x27;s purpose (the actualization of X) is fulfilled.

Molinists also believe it can aid one&#x27;s understanding of salvation. Ever since Augustine and Pelagius there has been debate over the issue of salvation; more specifically, can God elect believers and believers still come to God freely? Protestants who lean more towards God&#x27;s election to salvation and sovereignty are usually Calvinists while those who lean more towards humanity&#x27;s free choice follow Arminianism. However, the Molinist can embrace both God&#x27;s sovereignty and human free choice.

Take the salvation of Agent A. God knows that if He were to place A in circumstances C, then A would freely choose to believe in Christ. So God actualizes the world where C occurs, and then A freely believes. God still retains a measure of His divine providence because He actualizes the world in which A freely chooses. But, A still retains freedom in the sense of being able to choose either option. Molinism does not affirm two contradictory propositions when it affirms both God&#x27;s providence and humanity&#x27;s freedom. God&#x27;s providence extends to the actualization of the world in which an agent may believe upon Christ.

===Difference from Calvinism and from Arminianism===
In contrast to the Calvinist acrostic TULIP and the Arminian &quot;Five Articles of Remonstrance&quot;, Timothy George has devised an acrostic summary for Molinism called ROSES:

* Radical Depravity
** &quot;Man&#x27;s nature is radically depraved from the fall.&quot; 
* Overcoming Grace
** &quot;God&#x27;s grace overcomes man&#x27;s radical depravity. As opposed to irresistible grace, man can respond.&quot; 
* Sovereign Election
** &quot;God&#x27;s sovereign election of individuals, predetermined by His exercise of middle knowledge to know who would respond to Him in faith. This is instead of unconditional election, where God elects individuals independent of their libertarian free will.&quot; 
* Eternal life
** &quot;Regenerate believers will not fall away from a state of justification.&quot; 
* Singular redemption
** &quot;A modified view of limited atonement. Christ&#x27;s redemption is sufficient for all, but applicable only to the elect.&quot;

Molinism differs from Calvinism by affirming that God grants salvation, but a person has the choice to freely accept it or reject it (but God knows that if the person were put in a particular situation he or she would not reject it). This differs from Calvinistic double predestination, which states that a person&#x27;s salvation is already determined by God such that he or she cannot choose otherwise or resist God&#x27;s grace.

While both Arminianism and Molinism agree that God definitively knows how a person would react to the Gospel message. Molinism relies on the concept of middle knowledge while Arminianism does not. 

Molinists have internal disagreements about the extent to which they agree with Calvinism, some holding to unconditional election, others holding to conditional election and others still holding to an election that is partly both. Alfred Freddoso explains: “Some Molinists, including Bellarmine and Suárez, agree with the Bañezians that God antecedently elects certain people to eternal glory and only then consults His middle knowledge to discover which graces will guarantee their salvation. Thus, in Peter&#x27;s case, God would have chosen different graces if those He actually chose had been foreknown to be merely sufficient and not efficacious for Peter&#x27;s salvation. Other Molinists, including Molina himself, vigorously reject any such antecedent absolute election of Peter to salvation. They insist instead that God simply chooses to create a world in which He infallibly foresees Peter&#x27;s good use of the supernatural graces afforded him, and only then does he accept Peter among the elect in light of his free consent to those graces.” Other Molinists avoid the issue altogether by holding to the view of trans-world damnation, the idea that the unsaved in this world would have rejected Christ in any world.

===Debate between Jesuit Molinists and Dominicans===

In 1581, a heated argument erupted between the Jesuits, who advocated Molinism, and the Dominicans, who had a different understanding of God&#x27;s foreknowledge and the nature of predestination. In 1597, Pope Clement VIII established the Congregatio de Auxiliis, a committee whose purpose was to settle this controversy. In 1607, Pope Paul V ended the quarrel by forbidding each side to accuse the other of heresy, allowing both views to exist side-by-side in the Catholic Church.

===Other implications===
Thomas Flint has developed what he considers other implications of Molinism, including papal infallibility, prophecy, and prayer. William Lane Craig uses Molinism to reconcile scriptural passages warning of apostasy with passages teaching the security of believers. Craig has also used middle knowledge to explain a wide range of theological issues, such as divine providence and predestination, biblical inspiration, perseverance of the saints, and Christian particularism.

== Biblical texts for Molinism ==
Molinists have often argued that their position is the biblical one by indicating passages they understand to teach God&#x27;s middle knowledge. Molina advanced the following three texts: , , and . Other passages used to support Molinism are , , , , , , , , and . William Lane Craig has argued at length that many of Christ&#x27;s statements seem to indicate middle knowledge. Craig cites the following passages: , , , , and . Craig accepts that the most these texts indicate is that God has counterfactual knowledge. In order for this knowledge to be middle knowledge, it must be logically prior to God&#x27;s free knowledge, something the biblical texts mentioned do not seem to affirm or deny. However, Craig argues that if God&#x27;s decree were logically prior to His middle knowledge, that would “make God the author of sin and to obliterate human freedom, since in that case it is God who decrees which counterfactuals about creaturely free acts are true, including counterfactuals concerning sinful human decisions. Thus, we have good reason for thinking that if such counterfactuals are now true or false, they must have been so logically prior to God&#x27;s decree.”

Thomas Flint claims the twin foundations of Molinism are God&#x27;s providence and man&#x27;s freedom. Molinism harmonizes texts teaching God&#x27;s providence (such as or ) with texts emphasizing man&#x27;s choice (such as or ).

==Criticism==
Molinism has been controversial and criticized since its inception in Molina&#x27;s concordia. The Dominican Order which espoused strict Thomism criticized that novel doctrine and found fault with the &quot;scientia media&quot;, which they think implies passivity, which is repugnant to Pure Act. The Thomists disputed it before the Popes, as bordering on semi-Pelagianism, and afterwards there were ten years of debate in the Congregation &quot;de Auxiliis&quot;.

The grounding objection is at present the most debated objection to Molinism, and often considered the strongest. The argument claims that there are no metaphysical grounds for the truthfulness of counterfactuals of creaturely freedom. As Hugh J. McCann puts it:
&quot;Perhaps the most serious objection against it is that there does not appear to be any way God could come by such knowledge. Knowledge, as we have seen, is not merely a matter of conceiving a proposition and correctly believing it to be true. It requires justification: one must have good reasons for believing. But what justification could God have for believing the propositions that are supposed to constitute middle knowledge? The truth of subjunctives of freedom cannot be discerned a priori, for they are contingent. It is not a necessary truth that if placed in circumstances C, I will decide to attend the concert tonight. Nor can we allow that God might learn the truth of C from my actual behavior — that is, by observing that I actually do, in circumstances C, decide to attend the concert. For God could not make observations like this without also finding out what creative decisions He is actually going to make, which would destroy the whole purpose of middle knowledge.”
Thus, there are no &quot;truth makers&quot; that ground counterfactuals. Opponents to middle knowledge claim that the historical antecedent of any possible world does not determine the truthfulness of a counterfactual for a creature, if that creature is free in the libertarian sense. (Molinists naturally accept this, but deny that this entails that counterfactuals of creaturely freedom lack truth values.)

Many philosophers and theologians who embrace the grounding objection prefer to claim that instead of counterfactuals of freedom being true, probable counterfactuals are true instead. So instead of truths of the following sort: &quot;God knows that in circumstance C creature X will freely do A&quot; God knows truths of this sort: &quot;God knows that in circumstances C creature X would probably do A.&quot; Yet, as Edward Wierenga has pointed out, probable counterfactuals are also contingent truths and fall victim to the same grounding objection.

Molinists have responded to the aforementioned argument two ways. First, as William Lane Craig argues &quot;[I]n order for a counterfactual of freedom to be true, it is not required that the events to which they refer actually exist; all that is required is that they &quot;would&quot; exist under the specified conditions.&quot; The idea here is that if we imagine God creating multiple universes in multiple dimensions and giving people libertarian free will in the various universes and letting events all play out, we would have no problem grounding counterfactuals of freedom based on the events in the various universes. But why should God need to create such universes to know how events would unfold, and couldn&#x27;t how they would turn out ground statements about how they would turn out?

Further objections at this point lead to a second line of response. Alvin Plantinga responds to the grounding objection by saying &quot;It seems to me much clearer that some counterfactuals of freedom are at least possibly true than that the truth of propositions must, in general, be grounded in this way.&quot; William Lane Craig follows up on this by pointing out the burden of proof the grounding objector bears. The grounding objection &quot;asserts that there are no true counterfactuals about how creatures would freely act under any given set of circumstances. This assertion is no mere ostensibly undercutting defeater of Molinism, but a putatively rebutting defeater. It makes a bold and positive assertion and therefore requires warrant in excess of that which attends the Molinist assumption that there are true counterfactuals about creaturely free actions&quot; and that &quot;Anti–Molinists have not even begun the task of showing that counterfactuals of creaturely freedom are members of the set of propositions or statements which require truth–makers if they are to be true.&quot; Thus the grounding objectors must prove a universal negative regarding the falsity of counterfactuals of freedom or they must explain their theory of the basis for truth and prove that theory true.

The difference in perspectives here may be briefly described in the following way. According to critics, the way in which an agent will make a free choice inherently cannot be known apart from observation of the choice being actualized. God may be able to observe these choices via prescience, but even He must still observe them to know them. Therefore, God cannot know what we will do, unless He sees the future. The Molinist position, exemplified by Craig in the preceding paragraph, is 1) to argue this requires potentially heretical arguments relating to a limitation of divine omniscience, and 2) that a choice can be free, and yet the way in which an agent will make that choice can be known apart from observation of the actualized choice itself (and even apart from the actualization of the choice entirely). Critics maintain that this is no longer really a free choice: if it is known of someone that &quot;If she were offered a dollar, she would take it,&quot; apart from actually offering that person a dollar, then she is not free to take or not take that dollar. The question hinges upon whether, by the definition of a free choice, it is possible to know which choice will be made independently from the actualization of that choice.

<text>Kayser–Fleischer rings (KF rings) are dark rings that appear to encircle the cornea of the eye. They are due to copper deposition in the Descemet&#x27;s membrane as a result of particular liver diseases. They are named after German ophthalmologists Bernhard Kayser and Bruno Fleischer who first described them in 1902 and 1903. Initially thought to be due to the accumulation of silver, they were first demonstrated to contain copper in 1934.

==Presentation==
The rings, which consist of copper deposits where the cornea meets the sclera, in Descemet&#x27;s membrane, first appear as a crescent at the top of the cornea. Eventually, a second crescent forms below, at the &quot;six o&#x27;clock position&quot;, and ultimately completely encircles the cornea.

===Associations===
Kayser–Fleischer rings are a sign of Wilson&#x27;s disease, which involves abnormal copper handling by the liver resulting in copper accumulation in the body and is characterised by abnormalities of the basal ganglia of the brain, liver cirrhosis, splenomegaly, involuntary movements, muscle rigidity, psychiatric disturbances, dystonia and dysphagia. The combination of neurological symptoms, a low blood ceruloplasmin level and KF rings is diagnostic of Wilson&#x27;s disease.

Other causes of KF rings are cholestasis (obstruction of the bile ducts), primary biliary cirrhosis and &quot;cryptogenic&quot; cirrhosis (cirrhosis in which no cause can be identified).

==Diagnosis==

As Kayser–Fleischer rings do not cause any symptoms, it is common for them to be identified during investigations for other medical conditions. In certain situations, they are actively sought; in that case, the early stages may be detected by slit lamp examination before they become visible to the naked eye.

<doc id="732620" wikidata="Q217334" url="?curid=732620" title="National Socialist Program">
<text>The National Socialist Program, also known as the Nazi Party Program, the 25-point Program or the 25-point Plan (), was the party program of the National Socialist German Workers&#x27; Party (NSDAP, and referred to in English as the Nazi Party). Adolf Hitler announced the party&#x27;s program on 24 February 1920 before approximately 2,000 people in the Munich Festival of the Hofbräuhaus and within the program was written &quot;The leaders of the Party swear to go straight forward, if necessary to sacrifice their lives in securing fulfilment of the foregoing points&quot; and declared the program unalterable. The National Socialist Program originated at a DAP congress in Vienna, then was taken to Munich, by the civil engineer and theorist Rudolf Jung, who having explicitly supported Hitler had been expelled from Czechoslovakia because of his political agitation.

The historian Karl Dietrich Bracher summarizes the program by saying that its components were &quot;hardly new&quot; and that &quot;German, Austrian and Bohemian proponents of anti-capitalist, nationalist-imperialist, anti-Semitic movements were resorted to in its compilation&quot; but that a call to &quot;breaking the shackles of finance capital&quot; was added in deference to the &quot;idee fixe&quot; of Gottfried Feder, one of the party&#x27;s founding members and Hitler provided the militancy of the stance against the Treaty of Versailles and the insistence that the points could not be changed and were to be the permanent foundation of the party. Bracher characterizes the points as being &quot;phrased like slogans; they lent themselves to the concise sensational dissemination of the &#x27;anti&#x27; position on which the party thrived. ... Ideologically speaking, [the program] was a wooly, eclectic mixture of political, social, racist, national-imperialist wishful thinking...&quot;

According to the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum, the 25-point program &quot;remained the party&#x27;s official statement of goals, though in later years many points were ignored&quot;.

==German Party program==
In Munich, on 24 February 1920, Hitler publicly proclaimed the 25-point Program of the NSDAP (National Socialist German Workers&#x27; Party, referred to in English as the Nazi Party), when the Nazis were still known as the DAP (German Workers&#x27; Party). They retained the National Socialist Program upon renaming themselves as the National Socialist German Workers Party (NSDAP) in February 1920 and it remained the Party&#x27;s official program. The 25-point Program was a German adaptation — by Anton Drexler, Adolf Hitler, Gottfried Feder and Dietrich Eckart — of Rudolf Jung&#x27;s Austro–Bohemian program. Unlike the Austrians, the Germans did not claim to be either liberal or democratic and opposed neither political reaction nor the aristocracy, yet advocated democratic institutions (i.e. the German central parliament) and voting rights solely for Germans — implying that a Nazi government would retain popular suffrage.

The Austrian monarchist Erik von Kuehnelt-Leddihn proposed that the 25-point Program was pro-labour: &quot;[T]he program championed the right to employment, and called for the institution of profit sharing, confiscation of war profits, prosecution of usurers and profiteers, nationalization of trusts, communalization of department stores, extension of the old-age pension system, creation of a national education program of all classes, prohibition of child labour, and an end to the dominance of investment capital&quot;. Whereas historian William Brustein proposes that said program points and party founder Drexler&#x27;s statements indicate that the Nazi Party (NSDAP) originated as a working-class political party.

In the course of pursuing public office, the agrarian failures of the 1920s prompted Hitler to explain further the &quot;true&quot; meaning of Point 17 (land reform, legal land expropriation for public utility, abolishment of the land value tax and proscription of land speculation), in the hope of winning the farmers&#x27; votes in the May 1928 elections. Hitler disguised the implicit contradictions of Point 17 of the National Socialist Program by explaining that &quot;gratuitous expropriation concerns only the creation of legal opportunities, to expropriate, if necessary, land which has been illegally acquired or is not administered from the viewpoint of the national welfare. This is directed primarily against the Jewish land-speculation companies&quot;.

Throughout the 1920s, other members of the NSDAP, seeking ideologic consistency, sought either to change or to replace the National Socialist Program. In 1923, the economist Gottfried Feder proposed a 39-point program retaining some original policies and introducing new policies. Hitler suppressed every instance of programmatic change by refusing to broach the matters after 1925, because the National Socialist Program was “inviolable”, hence immutable.

Historian Karl Dietrich Bracher writes that to Hitler, the program was &quot;little more than an effective, persuasive propaganda weapon for mobilizing and manipulating the masses. Once it had brought him to power, it became pure decoration: &#x27;unalterable,&#x27; yet unrealized in its demands for nationalization and expropriation, land reform and &#x27;breaking the shackles of finance capital.&#x27; Yet it nonetheless fulfilled its role as backdrop and pseudo-theory, against which the future dictator could unfold his rhetorical and dramatic talents.&quot;

===The 25-point Program of the NSDAP===
# We demand the union of all Germans to form the Greater Germany on the basis of the people&#x27;s right to self-determination enjoyed by the nations.
# We demand equality of rights for the German people in its dealings with other nations; and abolition of the peace treaties of Versailles and St. Germain.
# We demand land and territory (colonies) for the sustenance of our people and colonization for our surplus population.
# None but members of the nation may be citizens of the state. None but those of German blood, whatever their creed, may be members of the nation. No Jew, therefore, may be a member of the nation.
# Whoever has no citizenship is to be able to live in Germany only as a guest and must be regarded as being subject to foreign laws.
# The right of voting on the state&#x27;s government and legislation is to be enjoyed by the citizen of the state alone. We demand therefore that all official appointments, of whatever kind, shall be granted to citizens of the state alone. We oppose the corrupting custom of parliament of filling posts merely with a view to party considerations, and without reference to character or capability.
# We demand that the state be charged first with providing the opportunity for a livelihood and way of life for the citizens. If it is impossible to nourish the total population of the State, then the members of foreign nations (non-citizens) must be excluded from the Reich.
# All immigration of non-Germans must be prevented. We demand that all non-Germans, who have immigrated to Germany since 2 August 1914, be required immediately to leave the Reich.
# All citizens of the state shall be equal as regards rights and obligations.
# The first obligation of every citizen must be to productively work mentally or physically. The activity of individual may not clash with the interests of the whole, but must proceed within the framework of the whole for the benefit for the general good. We demand therefore:
# Abolition of unearned (work and labour) incomes. Breaking of debt (interest)-slavery.
# In consideration of the monstrous sacrifice of life and property that each war demands of the people, personal enrichment due to a war must be regarded as a crime against the nation. Therefore, we demand ruthless confiscation of all war profits.
# We demand nationalization of all businesses which have been up to the present formed into companies (trusts).
# We demand that the profits from wholesale trade shall be shared out.
# We demand an expansion on a large scale of old age welfare.
# We demand the creation of a healthy middle class and its conservation, immediate communalization of the great warehouses and their being leased at low cost to small firms, the utmost consideration of all small firms in contracts with the State, county or municipality.
# We demand a land reform suitable to our needs, provision of a law for the free expropriation of land for the purposes of public utility, abolition of land rent and prevention of all speculation in land.
# We demand struggle without consideration against those whose activity is injurious to the general interest. Common national criminals, usurers, profiteers and so forth are to be punished with death, without consideration of confession or race.
# We demand substitution of a German common law in place of the Roman Law serving a materialistic world-order.
# The state is to be responsible for a fundamental reconstruction of our whole national education program, to enable every capable and industrious German to obtain higher education and subsequently introduction into leading positions. The plans of instruction of all educational institutions are to conform with the experiences of practical life. The comprehension of the concept of the state must be striven for by the school [&quot;Staatsbürgerkunde&quot;] as early as the beginning of understanding. We demand the education at the expense of the state of outstanding intellectually gifted children of poor parents without consideration of position or profession.
# The state is to care for the elevating national health by protecting the mother and child, by outlawing child-labor, by the encouragement of physical fitness, by means of the legal establishment of a gymnastic and sport obligation, by the utmost support of all organizations concerned with the physical instruction of the young.
# We demand abolition of the mercenary troops and formation of a national army.
# We demand legal opposition to known lies and their promulgation through the press. In order to enable the provision of a German press, we demand, that: 
#: a. All writers and employees of the newspapers appearing in the German language be members of the race;
#: b. Non-German newspapers be required to have the express permission of the state to be published. They may not be printed in the German language;
#: c. Non-Germans are forbidden by law any financial interest in German publications or any influence on them and as punishment for violations the closing of such a publication as well as the immediate expulsion from the Reich of the non-German concerned. Publications which are counter to the general good are to be forbidden. We demand legal prosecution of artistic and literary forms which exert a destructive influence on our national life and the closure of organizations opposing the above made demands.
# We demand freedom of religion for all religious denominations within the state so long as they do not endanger its existence or oppose the moral senses of the Germanic race. The Party as such advocates the standpoint of a positive Christianity without binding itself confessionally to any one denomination. It combats the Jewish-materialistic spirit within and around us and is convinced that a lasting recovery of our nation can only succeed from within on the framework:
#:THE COMMON INTEREST OVER INDIVIDUAL INTEREST
# For the execution of all of this we demand the formation of a strong central power in the Reich. Unlimited authority of the central parliament over the whole Reich and its organizations in general. The forming of state and profession chambers for the execution of the laws made by the Reich within the various states of the confederation. The leaders of the Party promise, if necessary by sacrificing their own lives, to support by the execution of the points set forth above without consideration.

<doc id="732628" wikidata="Q475260" url="?curid=732628" title="Klatskin tumor">
<text>A Klatskin tumor (or hilar cholangiocarcinoma) is a cholangiocarcinoma (cancer of the biliary tree) occurring at the confluence of the right and left hepatic bile ducts. The disease was named after Gerald Klatskin, who in 1965 described 15 cases and found some characteristics for this type of cholangiocarcinoma.

==Cause==
The cause of cholangiocarcinoma has not been defined. A number of pathologic conditions, however, resulting in either acute or chronic biliary tract epithelial injury may predispose to malignant change. Primary sclerosing cholangitis, an idiopathic inflammatory condition of the biliary tree, has been associated with the development of cholangiocarcinoma in up to 40% of patients. Congenital biliary cystic disease, such as choledochal cysts or Caroli&#x27;s disease, has also been associated with malignant transformation in up to 25% of cases. These conditions appear to be related to an anomalous pancreatico-biliary duct junction and, perhaps, are related to the reflux of pancreatic secretions into the bile duct. Chronic biliary tract parasitic infection, seen commonly in Southeast Asia due to &quot;Clonorchis sinensis&quot; and &quot;Opisthorchis viverrini&quot;, has also been identified as a risk factor. Although gallstones and cholecystectomy are not thought to be associated with an increased incidence of cholangiocarcinoma, hepatolithiasis and choledocholithiasis may predispose to malignant change. Further, industrial exposure to asbestos and nitrosamines, and the use of the radiologic contrast agent, Thorotrast (thorium dioxide), are considered to be risk factors for the development of cholangiocarcinoma.

==Diagnosis==
Levels of the tumor markers carbohydrate antigen 19-9 (CA 19–9), carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) and CA 125 are abnormally high in the bloodstreams of patients with intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma and Klatskin tumor. The serum CA 19–9 in particular may be very high. The ultrasonography (and the use of Doppler modes) permit definitive diagnosis of a large number of lesions and the involvement of hepatic hilum, but it is less sensitive than CT or MRI in detecting focal lesions. Ultrasonography always detects dilatation of the bile ducts, but more rarely the tumor itself.
Magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) is a good non-invasive alternative to these other procedure. This technique demonstrates hepatic parenchyma and it&#x27;s accurate for detecting nodular carcinomas and infiltrating lesions.

==Treatment==

Because of their location, these tumors tend to become symptomatic late in their development and therefore are not usually resectable at the time of presentation. Complete resection of the tumor, especially in early-stage disease, offers hope of long-term survival. However, patients that are candidates for resectability are few and moreover many of these patients will have a relapse despite apparent removal of the tumor. The type of surgery and the extent of the resection depend on the location of the tumor and the degree of extension. In some cases, the obstructive jaundice may present early and compel the patient to seek help. More often, liver resection is not a viable option because many patients are of advanced age, have multiple co-pathologies and are therefore at high risk.
Of late there has been renewed interest in liver transplantation from deceased donors along with add on therapy. Prognosis remains poor.

==Epidemiology==
Approximately 15,000 new cases of liver and biliary tract carcinoma are diagnosed annually in the United States, with roughly 10% of these cases being Klatskin tumors. Cholangiocarcinoma accounts for approximately 2% of all cancer diagnoses, with an overall incidence of 1.2/100,000 individuals. Two-thirds of cases occur in patients over the age of 65, with a nearly ten-fold increase in patients over 80 years of age. The incidence is similar in both men and women.

<text>Kussmaul breathing is a deep and labored breathing pattern often associated with severe metabolic acidosis, particularly diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) but also kidney failure. It is a form of hyperventilation, which is any breathing pattern that reduces carbon dioxide in the blood due to increased rate or depth of respiration.

In metabolic acidosis, breathing is first rapid and shallow but as acidosis worsens, breathing gradually becomes deep, labored and gasping. It is this latter type of breathing pattern that is referred to as Kussmaul breathing.

==Terminology==
Adolf Kussmaul referred to breathing when metabolic acidosis was sufficiently severe for the respiratory rate to be normal or reduced. This definition is also followed by several other sources, including for instance Merriam-Webster, which defines Kussmaul breathing as &quot;abnormally slow deep respiration characteristic of air hunger and occurring especially in acidotic states&quot;. Other sources, however, use the term Kussmaul respiration also when acidosis is less severe, in which case breathing is rapid.

Kussmaul breathing occurs only in advanced stages of acidosis, and is not commonly seen. Rapid, shallow breathing may be observed in less severe cases but Kussmaul breathing is a characteristic deep, gasping - even desperate - manner of respiratory distress.

==History==
Kussmaul breathing is named for Adolf Kussmaul, the 19th century German physician who first noted it among patients with advanced diabetes mellitus. 

==Mechanism==
Kussmaul breathing is respiratory compensation for a metabolic acidosis, most commonly occurring in diabetics in diabetic ketoacidosis. Blood gases of a patient with Kussmaul breathing will show a low partial pressure of CO2 in conjunction with low bicarbonate because of a forced increased respiration (blowing off the carbon dioxide). Base excess is severely negative. The patient feels an urge to breathe deeply, an &quot;air hunger&quot;, and it appears almost involuntary.

A metabolic acidosis soon produces hyperventilation, but at first it will tend to be rapid and relatively shallow. Kussmaul breathing develops as the acidosis grows more severe. Indeed, Kussmaul originally identified this type of breathing as a sign of coma and imminent death in diabetic patients.

Duration of fasting, presence or absence of liver enlargement and Kussmaul breathing provide clues to the differential diagnosis of high blood sugar in the inborn errors of metabolism.

<text>Coleford is a market town in the west of the Forest of Dean, Gloucestershire, England, east of the Welsh border and close to the Wye Valley. It is the administrative centre of the Forest of Dean district. The combined population of the town&#x27;s two electoral wards at the 2011 census was 8,359. The population of the town&#x27;s parish was 9,273 in the 2021 Census. The parish includes the village of Baker&#x27;s Hill.

==History==
Coleford was originally a tithing in the north-east corner of Newland parish. The settlement arose at a ford through which charcoal and iron ore were probably carried. By the mid-14th century, hamlets called Coleford and Whitecliff had grown up in the valley of Thurstan&#x27;s Brook. Coleford had eight or more houses in 1349 and was described as a street in 1364. It had a place of worship by 1489. In 1642 the commander of a parliamentary garrison in Coleford started a market in the town, as the nearest chartered market in Monmouth was under royalist control.

Coleford soon saw some action in the English Civil War. On 20 February 1643, Lord Herbert, the Earl of Worcester&#x27;s eldest son and the King&#x27;s Lieutenant-General of South Wales, marched through Coleford heading for Gloucester, at the head of an army of 500 horse and 1500 foot. At Coleford their progress was impeded by a troop of Parliamentarians under Colonel Berrowe, aided by a disorderly group of country people. A skirmish ensued, in which the market-house was burnt and Major-General Lawday, who commanded the foot, and two other officers were shot dead from a window. Colonel Brett was then put in command of the foot, Lord John Somerset continuing at the head of the horse. The Royalists forced a passage through, after capturing Lieutenant-Colonel Winter, together with some other officers and soldiers, and so putting the Parliamentarians to flight. They then marched unimpeded to Gloucester.

After the Restoration, a market was granted in 1661 and a new market house built in 1679. Much building took place in the town, which was thought by 1710 to have 160 houses. Of the older surviving buildings in the market place, the &quot;Old White Hart Inn&quot; dates from the 17th century. In the late 18th century and early 19th, the town expanded along its other streets and most of its older houses were rebuilt. The &quot;Angel Inn&quot;, which had opened by the 1650s, was re-fronted or rebuilt around 1800. For many years it housed an excise office. In the mid-18th century it was the town&#x27;s principal coaching inn and used for public meetings and assemblies. The number of public houses increased as the town grew in importance. By 1830 there were seven or eight, most of them in the market place, and also a larger number of beerhouses.

The market house (or town hall) was rebuilt on a larger scale in 1866. Also in the market place was the church, which was rebuilt on an octagonal plan in 1820, but proved too small for the growing congregation and was pulled down in 1882, its tower being retained for a clock tower. A much larger church, St John the Evangelist&#x27;s, was built on a hillside overlooking the town. This church was closed in 2016 and its building put up for sale. Expansion continued in piecemeal fashion throughout the 20th century, through both council and private development. Traffic congestion in the market place was eased by demolition of the town hall in 1968 and the introduction of a gyro system around the clock tower.

===Industry===
Iron production in Coleford dates back to the Middle Ages. This produced large quantities of waste material or cinders. Some formed prominent mounds, which by the late 17th century were reworked to provide iron ore for the furnaces, which had become more efficient by then. The medieval ironworks were moveable forges operating on the royal demesne woodland of the Forest of Dean. An ore smithy or furnace was operating at Whitecliff in 1361, and the hamlet had several in the 15th and 16th centuries. In the later Middle Ages, iron was also worked in Coleford town, where there was a furnace next to the chapel in 1539.

There was coalmining to the north and east of Coleford from the 16th century. Limestone was also quarried at the south-west end of Whitecliff before the 17th century. Lime kilns operated at Whitecliff, and Scowles, which supplied much lime to Monmouthshire.

In 1798, work began on Whitecliff Ironworks on the south-western edge of Coleford. The furnace there probably began firing in 1801 or 1802, and a second one beside it before 1808. The output was limited by the quality of coke required. In 1809 David Mushet, a noted metallurgist, was employed to increase productivity, but the works remained unprofitable and Mushet withdrew from the venture after a few months. The furnaces were abandoned several years later, perhaps by 1812 and certainly by 1816. The surviving ruins can be viewed by the public.

===Transport===
Coleford was on the route of a tramway that opened in 1812 to link mines in the Forest with the River Wye at Redbrook and Monmouth. This continued in use until its track east of Coleford was lifted in the late 1870s.

The first railway to reach Coleford, a branch line from Parkend, was opened by the Severn and Wye Railway Company in 1875. It ran through Milkwall to a station on the south-east side of the town. A second railway, the Coleford Railway from Monmouth, used parts of the old tramway route and was completed in 1883. It included a short tunnel at Whitecliff and crossed the Newland road to reach a station next to that of the Severn &amp; Wye Co. A junction was made between the two railways in 1884, after the Monmouth line was taken over by the Great Western Railway. The Severn and Wye line ceased passenger services in 1929. And was then closed in 1967. The track between Whitecliff and Parkend was removed by 1971. Some railway buildings at Coleford, including a goods shed, were incorporated in the Coleford Great Western Railway Museum that opened in 1988.

The nearest railway station today is Lydney (8 miles, 13 km).

===Churches===
The Anglican Holy Trinity Church near the centre of Coleford was built in 1831. It has services on Sunday and Wednesday. Coleford Baptist Church has a Sunday service, as does the town&#x27;s Pentecostal Church. Both have Facebook pages.

==Today==
Coleford adapted more ably to the mine closures of the 1950s than its neighbour, Cinderford. Their prime location in the heart of the Forest make them popular with walkers and cyclists and the local council has made moves to encourage further visitors. The large factory in the town, originally called Carters, then Beechams, then GlaxoSmithKline, is now owned by the Japanese firm Suntory. It is the sole production facility for Ribena and Lucozade. One surviving building is the former goods shed for the defunct railway line to Monmouth. This now houses the Coleford GWR Museum.

SPP Pumps Ltd, Britain&#x27;s leading pump manufacturer also has its main UK manufacturing site at Coleford, where it employs over 300 people. It mainly caters to the industrial and offshore firefighting oil and gas markets, and to the UK municipal water market.

==Media==
Local news and television programmes are provided by BBC West and ITV West Country. Television signals are received from the Mendip and the local relay transmitters. 

Local radio stations are BBC Radio Gloucestershire, Heart West, Greatest Hits Radio South West, and Dean Radio, a community based radio station.

The town is served by the local newspaper, &quot;The Forester&quot;.

<text>The Apache–Sitgreaves National Forests is a United States National Forest which runs along the Mogollon Rim and the White Mountains in east-central Arizona and into the U.S. state of New Mexico. Formerly two forests, it is currently managed as one unit by USDA Forest Service from the Forest Supervisors Office in Springerville, Arizona. Apache–Sitgreaves has over 400 species of wildlife. With its high elevation and cool summer breezes it is a popular weekend destination from the hot desert for Phoenix, Arizona, residents. The forest is divided into 5 Ranger Districts (Clifton, Alpine, Springerville, Lakeside, and Black Mesa) that span almost from Clifton, Arizona in the east-central portion of Arizona to the eastern boundary of the Coconino National Forest in north-central Arizona. The Apache–Sitgreaves National Forest borders the western and northern borders of the Fort Apache Indian Reservation. It is located in parts of Greenlee, Apache, Navajo, and Coconino counties in eastern and east-central Arizona, and Catron County in western New Mexico. The more northwesterly Sitgreaves National Forest portion lies adjacent to the north side of the Fort Apache Indian Reservation and is located entirely in Arizona, within Navajo, Apache, and Coconino counties. It has a total area of . The more southeasterly and much larger Apache National Forest portion lies adjacent to the east side of the Fort Apache and the San Carlos Indian Reservations. It lies on both sides of the border with New Mexico, in Greenlee, Catron, and Apache counties. It has a total area of .

== Lakes, rivers, and streams ==

Apache–Sitgreaves National Forests has eight notable cold water lakes and boasts numerous lakes and reservoirs and over 680 miles (1094 km) of rivers and streams. The headwaters for the Black, Little Colorado, and San Francisco rivers are in the White Mountains.

* Aker Lake
* Big Lake
* Woods Canyon Lake
* Willow Springs Lake
* Black Canyon Lake
* Chevelon Canyon Lake
* Luna Lake
* Bear Canyon Lake
* Crescent Lake
* Blue River
== Wilderness areas ==
There are four wilderness areas within Apache–Sitgreaves National Forests. All lie within the former Apache National Forest section. Three have been officially designated by Congress as part of the National Wilderness Preservation System.
* Bear Wallow Wilderness
* Escudilla Wilderness
* Mount Baldy Wilderness
The fourth, the Blue Range Primitive Area, was designated as a Primitive Area by the Secretary of Agriculture in 1933. The area has been managed under the highest level of forest service protection to maintain its wilderness qualities. It was recommended that this area be included in the Blue Range Wilderness in 1971, but in 1980 Congress only acted upon an adjacent New Mexico portion within Gila National Forest.

== History ==
About 18 miles southwest of Alpine, Arizona is the Hannagan Meadow area with a lodge, trailheads, and campground. The meadow was named after Robert Hannagan, a miner and cattle rancher from Nevada. One local legend is that Hannagan was chained to a tree near the meadow until his debt of $1,200 was paid off. It was promptly paid by his son, but the name stuck. Another story suggests that Toles Cosper, a rancher from over to Luna, was riding with the young Hannagan when they came across the meadow during the 1870s. They flipped a coin to see which man they would name it after, and Hannagan won.

In 1909, while surveying for US Route 191, John D. Guthrie observed that &quot;there was neither fence nor cabin at Hannagan Meadow.&quot; However, with the advent of road construction on the Coronado Trail Road (later Coronado Trail Scenic Byway) tourism became a possibility, and Toles Cosper&#x27;s son, DeWitt Cosper, built a lodge there in 1926. The Hannagan Meadow Lodge provided tourists and travelers with rental cabins, single rooms for rent and a general store. As of 2016, the Lodge is still there and still serving tourists and travelers.

== Climate ==
Hannagan Meadows has a humid continental climate (Dsb). Summers are typically pleasant, with warm days and cool nights. Winters are moderately cold, with brisk days and chilly nights. Hannagan Meadows has five seasons, with Spring being the driest and Summer being the wettest. The dry part of Summer typically begins at the beginning of June, and lasts into July. The Monsoon season usually begins by mid-July (North American Monsoon) and lasts until the beginning of September, with thunderstorms being very common. Autumn begins during September, and can last to the end of November, with cool – mild days and nights beginning to dip below freezing. Winter usually begins by late November, and lasts until the end of February, but wintry days can be observed during March, and even as late as April, with heavy snowfall being common. Spring usually starts during early March, and lasts well into may, and is usually relatively dry. The highest temperature recorded in Hannagan Meadows is and occurred on August 6, 2019. The lowest temperature recorded in Hannagan Meadows is and occurred on January 7, 1989. Interestingly, the highest minimum and the lowest maximum temperatures recorded occurred in the same year, 2011, and are for the highest minimum which occurred on September 5, and for the lowest maximum which occurred on February 2. The first and last average freeze dates are June 3 and September 25, giving Hannagan Meadows a growing season of 114 days.

<doc id="732633" wikidata="Q1896771" url="?curid=732633" title="Society of Mary (Marianists)">
<text>The Society of Mary () abbreviated SM is a clerical religious congregation of Pontifical Right for men (brothers and priests) commonly called the Marianists or Marianist Brothers and Priests. Its members add the nominal letters &quot;&#x27;S.M.&#x27;&quot; to their names to indicate their membership in the Society. The Society was founded by William Joseph Chaminade, a priest who survived the anti-clerical persecution during the French Revolution. The Society is one of the four branches of the Marianist Family. Along with the other branches, the Marianist Brothers and Priests look to Mary as a model of faith and spirituality. They believe that the best ways to live a spiritual life are to share their faith with others, work with the poor, and educate and nourish the mind, the body, and the soul.

==Marianists around the world==
There are about 1,200 Marianists: 405 priests, two bishops, and 800 brothers on four continents and 38 countries. The Marianists say that they &quot;devote the major part of their efforts to inculturation to become rooted in new countries, in Asia and Africa, and also to be in tune with the surrounding cultures that challenge us and that we call modern or postmodern.&quot;

== Formation process ==

Men who pursue a vocation with the Society of Mary follow an intense formation process that leads them to examine themselves and their spirituality. The first step to becoming a Marianist is to be a Contact. Contacts learn about the religious institute and themselves through retreats and the guidance of a Marianist whom they contact regularly. The next step is Aspirancy – a 10-month journey of living with a Marianist community and following its daily practices. Each aspirant works in a ministry to further understand Marianist spirituality and faith. At the end of this period, one enters the Novitiate, a 20-month period divided over two years. During that time, the novice learns about the institute and spends time deeply discerning his call to the institute.

At the end of the Novitiate, the novice professes Temporary Vows. He must annually renew the vows for at least three years. At the end of that time, the brother can decide to enter into Perpetual Profession. The brother professes the vows of poverty, chastity, obedience, and stability. In addition, some brothers study to become priests at the International Marianist Seminary in Rome, Italy.

==Marianists in North America==

===Canada===
The Marianists are active in Canada, where the late Archbishop Raymond Roussin, S.M., D.D., one of their number, was head of the archiepiscopal see of Vancouver from 2004 to 2009.

===United States===
The United States is home to two Marianist provinces: the Province of the United States and the Province of Meribah.

The Province of Meribah, which became separate in 1976, operates only in the Diocese of Rockville Centre on Long Island, New York. There it runs an educational complex: Chaminade High School, Kellenberg Memorial High School (including the Bro. Joseph C. Fox Latin School Division, for grades 6–8); and St. Martin de Porres Marianist School (pre-kindergarten through grade 8). It also runs five retreat houses: Emmanuel Retreat House (on Kellenberg property), Stella Maris Retreat House (East Islip, NY), Saragossa (on Chaminade property), Meribah (Muttontown, New York), and Founder&#x27;s Hollow (Accord, New York). The Provincial of the Province of Meribah is Brother Timothy S. Driscoll, S.M. Since the Province of Meribah was created, it has maintained in common the life of prayer, the educational apostolate, and religious garb. The brothers&#x27; motto is &quot;Servire Quam Sentire&quot; (serve with feeling).

The Province of the United States recently updated their mission statement as follows: 
Empowered by the Holy Spirit and inspired by the dynamism of Blessed Chaminade&#x27;s charism, we – brothers and priests – vowed religious in the Marianist Family, live in community as equals. Through lives of prayer and Gospel service, we dedicate ourselves to the following of Jesus Christ, Son of God become Son of Mary. Wherever we are sent we invite others to share Mary&#x27;s Mission of making Christ present in every age and culture by forming persons and communities of apostolic faith that advance justice and reconciliation. Committed to education, we minister with youth and in solidarity with the poor.

Members of the Marianist Province of the United States are concentrated in Honolulu, Hawaii; St. Louis, Missouri; Dayton, Ohio; Cincinnati, Ohio; San Antonio, Texas; and Omaha, Nebraska. The Province runs three universities (the University of Dayton in Dayton, Ohio; St. Mary&#x27;s University in San Antonio, Texas; and Chaminade University in Honolulu, Hawaii), 18 high schools, 6 elementary schools, 2 middle schools, 5 retreat centers, and 7 parishes. Charles J. Pedersen, 1987 Nobel laureate in chemistry, attended a Marianist high school, and thence chose to attend the Marianist University of Dayton.

Marianists came to Africa as missionaries in 1946. They are active in Kenya, Malawi, Zambia, Republic of the Congo, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Ivory Coast, Togo, and Tunisia.

===Kenya===
The Marianists operate Our Lady of Nazareth primary school and the IMANI counseling,Ujamaa Family Centre, Job Creation training Program, and child care center in Nairobi, and the Marianist Development Project, a similar institution, in Mombasa. They serve members of the Sudanese Diocese of Rumbec in northwest Kenya. They operate the St. Bakhita Formation Center, with a seminary and training schools for nurses, teachers, and catechists. In 1925, they founded the prestigious Mang&#x27;u High School in Kenya.

===Malawi===
The Marianists&#x27; projects are the Chaminade Secondary School and MIRACLE, a rural job-training service for youths orphaned by AIDS.

===Zambia===
The Marianists teach at Matero Boys Secondary School, reach out to the school&#x27;s alumni, and help the surrounding diocese by celebrating Mass with their neighbors.

==Marianists in Asia and Australasia==

===Philippines===
The Marianists arrived in the Philippines in 2004. The congregation chose the more Islamic, southern part of the Philippines in the big city of Davao City as their mission area to establish a presence.

====Beginnings====
Brother Richard Joyal, a member of the Marianist Region of Canada, was sent by the Marianist General Administration to research a possible foundation in the Philippines. He arrived in Manila on 22 January 2004 and spent several months visiting Bishops and religious communities. In July, Richard attended the International Meeting for Marianist Formators held in Nairobi, Kenya (13 June – 11 July 2004).

Based on his reports, the General Administration decided to establish the first Marianist religious community on the island of Mindanao, in Davao City.

The community in Davao City was formed on 2 October 2004 by the arrival of Bros. Oscar Kerketta and Victor Sahayaraj from India, Fr. Pablo Rambaud from Spain, and Bro. Richard Joyal from Canada.

====Ministries====
Fr. Pat Devlin SM (Marist Fathers) had begun caring for Filipino Street Children on 4 May 1989. Fr. Pat worked with Caritas of the Archdiocese of Davao until the program registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) as the &quot;Foundation of Balay Pasilungan, Inc.&quot; From 1999 to 2005, the center was turned over to the Marist Sisters, who worked with Filipino Street Children up to fifteen.

In 2005 The Marianists in Davao adopted Balay Pasilungan as their Community apostolate. The center is accredited and is licensed to operate from the Department of Social Welfare and Development (DSWD). In 2006 the executive Director was Brother Richard Joyal; the Deputy Director was Father Pablo Rambaud with assistant Bro. Oscar Kerketta.

===Japan===
Marianists sent five expatriates to Japan in 1887, and in 1888 established a mission school, Gyosei Gakuen in Tokyo. They also established Kaisei Gakuen in Nagasaki in 1891, Osaka Meisei Gakuen in Osaka in 1898, and St. Joseph School in Yokohama in 1901.

===Australia===
The local parish priests of the western suburbs of Melbourne, Victoria, purchased a large block of 8 hectares in Altona that was transformed into the setting for St Paul&#x27;s by the parents of the first students. The main 3-story classroom block was completed in 1969.

The Marianists conducted the College for twenty years, under Headmasters Brother John McCluskey, Brother William Callahan, Father Daniel Winters, and Brother Donald McCoy. In 1985 the first lay principal, Mr. Christopher Dean, was appointed. In 1997 Mr. Christopher Stock was appointed principal.
Some specialist buildings at St Paul&#x27;s campus have been named in recognition of the proud Marianist tradition of the College: Chaminade Library, Winters Arts Building, Our Lady&#x27;s Chapel, McCoy Hall, and Cassidy Technology Centre. The Jubilee Building was named in honor of Jubilee Year 2000.
The names of the College Houses also reflect Marianist heritage: Winters (green), Cassidy (red), McCoy (navy), McCluskey (yellow), Chaminade (sky blue).

Meanwhile, the Marianists were invited by a committee headed by Father Joseph Kealy to establish a boys&#x27; college in the southern Melbourne suburb of Frankston for years 7 to 12 (then forms 1 to 6). Marianist College opened in February 1973 with 166 boys and a staff of six under the direction of Brother Don Neff, SM. After preliminary discussions in 1976, it was announced in 1977 that Marianist College Frankston would merge with the adjacent Stella Maris College establishing a new regional, coeducational college. After consultation with the Archbishop of Melbourne, parents, and students, the College Board determined that &quot;John Paul College&quot; would be the school&#x27;s official name. &quot;John Paul College&quot; was chosen to express the changes in the Catholic Church as a result of the Second Vatican Council (1962 –1965) under the leadership of popes John XXIII and Paul VI.

<doc id="732644" wikidata="Q1884343" url="?curid=732644" title="Marelli Europe">
<text>Marelli Europe S.p.A. (formerly Magneti Marelli S.p.A.) is a European subsidiary of Marelli Holdings which develops and manufactures components for the automotive industry. The firm is headquartered in Corbetta, Italy, and includes 86 manufacturing plants, 12 R&amp;D centres, and 26 application centers in 19 countries, with 43,000 employees and a turnover of 7.9 billion euro in 2016.

Subsidiaries and brands of the company include AL-Automotive Lighting, Carello, Cromodora, Cofap, Ergom Automotive, Jaeger, Mako Elektrik, Paraflu, Securvia, Seima, Siem SpA, Solex, Veglia Borletti, Vitaloni, and Weber.

==History==
Founded in 1919 as &quot;Fabbrica Italiana Magneti Marelli&quot; (FIMM), a joint-venture between Fiat and Ercole Marelli (1891–1993), an Italian electrical manufacturing company, the firm initially made ignition magnetos for the automotive and aviation industries, with its first plant in Sesto San Giovanni near Milan.

It was a subsidiary of FIAT (now Stellantis) from 1967 onwards.

On 22 October 2018, FCA announced that Magneti Marelli was being bought by KKR, to be merged with the Japanese automotive company Calsonic Kansei for $7.2 billion, a deal that would create one of the world&#x27;s largest auto parts suppliers.

In May 2019, Magneti Marelli and Calsonic Kansei merged to form Marelli.

==Current work==
, Magneti Marelli deals with intelligent systems for active and passive vehicle safety, and with powertrain systems. Business lines include automotive lighting systems, body control systems, powertrain control systems, electronic instrument clusters, telematics systems, and computers, suspension systems and components, exhaust systems, and motorsport, wherein Magneti Marelli develops specific electronic systems for Formula One, Grand Prix motorcycle racing and the World Rally Championship.

Magneti Marelli worked with Ford Motor Company and Microsoft (Windows Embedded Automotive, formerly Microsoft Auto), to develop an in-dash computer (carputer) for Ford&#x27;s work truck division introduced in 2008, with a built-in 6.5-inch, high-resolution touch screen and Bluetooth, USB connectivity, GPS navigation, voice recognition, and general office applications, e.g., word processing, contact, and calendar.
In 2023, Magneti Marelli fired 140 worker at its Niehl plant near Cologne, Germany.

<text>Camp Cropper was a holding facility for security detainees operated by the United States Army near Baghdad International Airport in Iraq. The facility was initially operated as a high-value detention site (HVD), but has since been expanded increasing its capacity from 163 to 2,000 detainees. Former Iraqi President Saddam Hussein was held there prior to his execution. Mr. Hussein was held at a nearby location outside the Camp Cropper complex. He was isolated from the former Ba&#x27;ath Party and subsequent HVT’s held at the main Cropper facility. 

==History==
Camp Cropper was established by the Headquarters and Headquarters Company (HHC) of the 115th Military Police Battalion in April 2003. It is named for Staff Sgt. Kenneth Cropper, a member of the Maryland Army National Guard who died in March 2002 while supporting security operations at the Pentagon. The facility was originally established as a High Value Detainee (HVD) holding area. Shortly after being established, its mission was expanded to also be a Corps Holding Area (CHA). Initially, the facility was meant to serve as &quot;central booking&quot; for the U.S. forces operating in Baghdad and central Iraq, though detainees from northern Iraq were brought there as well. After being processed at Camp Cropper detainees were supposed to be shipped to other detention facilities in Baghdad and throughout Iraq. However, in practice, this proved unworkable since most other prisons in Baghdad were badly damaged by looting after the fall of the Baath regime.

Additional units to operate Camp Cropper include:

* 812th Military Police Company
U.S. Army Reserve from Orangeburg, New York to include backfill elements of 366th MP Company of Stillwater, Oklahoma.
April-June 2003

* 443rd Military Police Company, U.S. Army Reserve from Owings Mills, Maryland, April–December 2003 
* 186th Military Police Company, Iowa National Guard April 2003 and February 2008.
*79th Military Police Company (Combat Support), U.S. Army Reserve Rochester, MN, Summer/Fall 2003-April 2004

* 141st Military Intelligence Battalion (LING), Utah Army National Guard, Orem, Utah- Command and Control (C2) for the Joint Intelligence Debriefing Center (JIDC),Task Force (TF) 134, November 2006 to October 2007.

* C &amp; B Company, 2nd Battalion, 103d Armored Regiment, Pennsylvania Army National Guard, as part of the 89th and later 42nd Military Police Brigade.

* 439th Military Police Detachment, U.S. Army Reserve from Omaha, Nebraska.

* 324th Military Police Battalion, U.S. Army Reserve from Chambersburg, Pennsylvania
[CSC 1-107th Cavalry] Ohio National Guard, 2005 
* 117th Military Police Battalion, Tennessee Army National Guard.
* 192nd Military Police Battalion, Connecticut Army National Guard, as part of the 89th Military Police Brigade from 2009 thru 2010

In August 2006, a combat support hospital was opened on Camp Cropper that would treat both coalition soldiers and detainees from Camp Cropper. The hospital was initially staffed by members of the 21st Combat Support Hospital from Fort Hood, Texas who transferred to the new facility after the closure of the Abu Ghraib detention facility. The 21st CSH was later replaced by the 31st Combat Support Hospital from Fort Bliss, Texas.

On March 15, 2007 military officials announced plans to once again expand Camp Bucca and Camp Cropper. Officials stated that this increase in capacity would be necessary to handle the detainees generated from the increased security operations in Baghdad.

In the summer of 2010 the Camp Cropper facility was turned over to the Iraqi government and renamed Karkh Prison.

A portion of Camp Cropper was still in use by the U.S. Army until December 2011 through the 40th Military Police Battalion, 15th Military Police Brigade, the 105th Military Police Battalion, 3rd Brigade 4th Infantry Division, Military Police Platoon, and 108th Military Police Company, 16th Military Police Brigade.

==Criticism==
On 2004-06-16, The Pentagon confirmed a report in &quot;The New York Times&quot; that former CIA chief George Tenet had been allowed by former U.S. Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld to have an Iraqi prisoner secretly detained at Camp Cropper since November, but denied they were trying to hide the prisoner from the International Committee of the Red Cross. Rumsfeld later told reporters that the prisoner was treated humanely. In 2003, the International Committee of the Red Cross was given regular and open access to the facility and the detainees, the Red Cross documented severe living conditions, harsh treatment by guards, and poor medical care.

In October 2006, the International Committee of the Red Cross reported the wounding of one American soldier to date by detainees. The attack was reported to have been under suspicious circumstances.

Since the closure of Abu Ghraib and the subsequent relocation to Camp Cropper, the now-larger prison has seen criticism for abuses of detainees and a hotbed of insurgent recruitment. Between October and December 2006, the MNF-I reported the deaths of three detainees at Camp Cropper. One from injuries inflicted by other detainees on October 29, two on November 30 and December 2 from natural causes. Other detainees died on 2007-04-04, 2007-05-26 and 2007-07-07.

In late April 2007, the former commander of Camp Cropper, Lieutenant Colonel William H. Steele was reported to be held in a military prison in Kuwait to await an Article 32 hearing. He was charged with various breaches of military law, including supplying an unmonitored cellphone to a detainee and inappropriate relationship with a detainee&#x27;s daughter. On October 19, 2007, a military judge found Steele not guilty on the charge of aiding the enemy, but guilty of &quot;unauthorized possession of classified documents, behavior unbecoming an officer for an inappropriate relationship with an interpreter and failing to obey a lawful order&quot;. Steele faced a possible maximum 6-year sentence for the charges he previously pleaded guilty to, as well as an additional 10 years for the charges for which he was convicted. Instead, he was sentenced to 2 years confinement, minus time already served, loss of his military retirement, forfeiture of pay and allowances and a dismissal from the military.

<text>The Marist Brothers of the Schools, commonly known as simply the Marist Brothers, is an international community of Catholic religious institute of brothers. In 1817, Marcellin Champagnat, a Marist priest from France, founded the Marist Brothers with the goal of educating young people, especially those most neglected. While most of the brothers minister in school settings, others work with young people in parishes, religious retreats, spiritual accompaniment, at-risk youth settings, young adult ministry, and overseas missions. Since the 2010s an extensive history of sexual abuse within Marist institutions has emerged in the public record.

==History==

St. Marcellin Champagnat decided to start an institute of consecrated brothers in the Marist tradition, building schools for the underprivileged where they might learn to become &quot;Good Christians and Good people&quot;. The decision was inspired by an event, when as a parish priest he was called to administer the last rites to a dying boy named Jean Baptiste Montagne. Trying to lead the boy through his last moments in prayer, Marcellin was struck by the fact that the young man had no gauge of Christianity or prayer. From that moment, Champagnat decided to start training brothers to meet the faith needs of the young people of France.

On January 2, 1817, the 23-year-old Jean Marie Granjon and Jean Baptist Audras, fourteen and a half years of age, moved into the small house that Fr. Champagnat had rented for them in La Valla and which became the first Marist Brothers community. Their day consisted of prayer, work and study; their manual work was to make nails, an activity that helped to pay expenses. Marcellin taught them reading and writing, and he looked after their formation as religious educators. Other young men joined the undertaking, among them Gabriel Rivat who, as Brother François, would later become the Brothers&#x27; first Superior General.

As a Marist priest, Champagnat had a particular affinity for the Blessed Virgin Mary, so upon conception of the idea of Marist Brothers, Champagnat chose to call his brothers &quot;Petits Frères de Marie&quot; (Little Brothers of Mary), emphasising the meekness and humbleness he wished them to pursue, and seeking their consecration to her as an exemplar of fidelity to Christ. In 1863, 23 years after Champagnat&#x27;s death, the Marist Brothers institute received the approbation of the Holy See, whereupon the order received the title of &quot;Fratres Maristae a Scholis&quot; (Marist Brothers of the Schools), hence the post-nominal letters of FMS. They received a particular mandate to follow the Marist Fathers to the Pacific and administer to the new colonies of the Pacific nations and Australia. This harkens back to a Marist legend about Champagnat.

A favourite maxim of St. Marcellin was that he wanted &quot;to make Jesus known and loved&quot; throughout the world, and to demonstrate he would run a needle through an apple (representing the earth) as an example of how he wanted the message of &quot;Ad Jesum per Mariam&quot; or &quot;To Jesus through Mary&quot; to cross the globe. The end of the needle came out in what would be the equivalent of the Pacific in relation to France where he inserted the needle, and so thus the Marist Brothers have a presence throughout the Pacific, including in Australia and New Zealand.

==International provinces==
The Marist Brothers are involved in educational work throughout the world and now conduct primary, secondary and higher education schools, academies, industrial schools, orphanages and retreat houses in 79 countries on five continents: Europe, Africa, The Americas, Asia, and Oceania.

From their roots in Lyons, the Brothers today have spread across the globe. Over their 200-year history, Marist Brothers have had ministries in over 100 different nations. There are approximately 2,500 brothers in 79 countries on 5 continents, working directly and sharing their mission and spirituality with more than 72,000 lay Marists, and together educating close to 654,000 children and young people.

The international Marist brotherhood is led by a Superior General, Br. Ernesto Sánchez, F.M.S. Together with the Vicar General and a General Council, it is his job to guide the growth and administration of the various ministries of the Brothers across the globe, from the General House in Rome. The Marist Brothers are divided into two main administrative units, either &quot;provinces&quot; or &quot;districts&quot;, depending on size. Provinces are led by a Provincial, whose job it is to oversee and make deliberations on behalf of the Superior General for the Province he leads. There are 26 provinces and 5 districts. Depending on the extent of ministries within a certain country, there may be multiple provinces within the one country. For example, Brazil has three provinces and two districts and Australia has two, as does Mexico.

===Asia===

* Mission Ad Gentes Marist District of Asia (Thailand, Bangladesh, Cambodia, India, and Philippines)
* Province of East Asia (Philippines, Hong Kong, South Korea, Malaysia, Singapore, and Japan). These schools are part of this province: Maris Stella High School in Singapore, SMJK Sam Tet in Ipoh, Perak, Malaysia, Catholic High School, Petaling Jaya in Petaling Jaya, Malaysia, Catholic High School, Melaka in Melaka, Malaysia, Notre Dame of Cotabato, Notre Dame of Kidapawan College, Notre Dame of Marbel University and Notre Dame of Dadiangas University, Marist School (Marikina) in Marikina, Philippines and St. Francis Xavier&#x27;s College and St. Francis Xavier&#x27;s School in Hong Kong (alma mater of Bruce Lee, Sam Hui, and other celebrities)
* Province of South Asia (India, Pakistan, and Sri Lanka). Notable school: Maris Stella College in Negombo.

===Oceania===
The Marist Brothers&#x27; first international missionary mandate was to the Pacific, where they accompanied Marist Fathers in evangelizing and education ministries. Today, Marist brothers own and run many technical colleges in the Central and Western Pacific, educating young men in nations ravaged by war (such as the Solomon Islands and Papua New Guinea).

Marist Brothers arrived in Australia in 1872, where they opened their first school at The Rocks, New South Wales. There are now over 300 Brothers working with young people in schools as teachers and administrators, in retreat houses and camps for young people and in other areas of ministry. Australian Marist Brothers also serve in welfare ministries working with young adults in outreach programs in indigenous Australian communities and also in missions in nearby Papua New Guinea, Bougainville, Solomon Islands, and East Timor. Marists from Australia also serve communities in Cambodia and India. The two provinces of Melbourne (States of Victoria, WA, South Australia and Northern Territory) and Sydney (Queensland, New South Wales, ACT and Cambodia) recombined in 2012. The number of Marist Brothers in Australian is diminishing and very few continue to teach in the Marist schools, which are now led and staffed predominantly by lay teachers; however, such schools are described as being in the &quot;Marist tradition&quot; as they continue to follow the educational principles of the Marist Brothers.

Oceania is divided into the following four administrative units:
* Province of Australia (Australia, Timor Leste, New Caledonia, Papua New Guinea, Solomon Islands and Vanuatu)
* District of Pacific (Fiji, Kiribati, New Zealand and Samoa)
In the Oceania region, Prime Ministers of Australia, Papua New Guinea, Fiji, Samoa and Tonga were all educated by schools run Marist Brothers.

===Europe===
The Marist project originated in Europe, particularly in France, which Marcellin Champagnat called home. A number of schools, universities, youth ministries and social works are done by the Marists in this area. The administration of European Marists is overseen by the provinces of:
* Province of Compostela (Spain, Honduras and Portugal)
* Province of West Central Europe (Belgium, Germany, Ireland, Netherlands and United Kingdom)
* Province of Iberia (Spain)
* Province de l&#x27;Hermitage (Algeria, Spain, France, Greece, Hungary and Switzerland)
* Mediterranean Province (Spain, Italy, Lebanon and Syria)

In Scotland, Celtic Football Club was formed at a meeting in St. Mary&#x27;s church hall in Glasgow, by Marist Brother Walfrid on November 6, 1887. The stated purpose, according to the official club records, was &quot;to alleviate poverty in Glasgow&#x27;s East End parishes&quot;. The charity established by Brother Walfrid was named &#x27;The Poor Children&#x27;s Dinner Table&#x27;.

===North America===
The North American provinces are particularly based around secondary and tertiary education. A number of American celebrities have been educated in American Marist schools, including Sean &quot;P Diddy&quot; Combs, David Hasselhoff and Ray Romano. The North American provinces are:
* Province of Canada
* Province of the United States

===Latin America===
In Latin America, &quot;Maristas&quot; are also very active in the following countries: Chile, Puerto Rico, Guatemala, Peru, El Salvador, Mexico, Costa Rica, Nicaragua, Argentina, Brazil, Colombia, Uruguay, Paraguay, Venezuela and other countries as well. The largest number of brothers currently are natives from Spain and France.
The Marist presence in these countries is divided into the following provinces:

* Province of Brasil Centro-Norte
* Province of Brasil Centro-Sul
* Province of Brasil Sul-Amazônia
* Province of Central America (El Salvador, Guatemala, Puerto Rico, Nicaragua, Costa Rica, Cuba)
* Province of Cruz del Sur (Argentina, Paraguay and Uruguay)
* Province of Central Mexico
* Province of Western Mexico (Mexico and Haiti)
* Province of the Northern Andes (Colombia, Ecuador and Venezuela)
* Province of Santa Maria of the Andes (Bolivia, Chile and Peru)

===Africa===
Marist brothers are active in a number of African countries, including Malawi, Zambia, Zimbabwe and Kenya. Marist brothers have been martyred in Africa on many occasions for educating and protecting refugee people. The administrative groupings of Marists in Africa are:
* Province of Southern Africa (Angola, Malawi, Mozambique, South Africa, Zambia and Zimbabwe)
* Province of East Central Africa (Democratic Republic of Congo, Central African Republic, Kenya, Rwanda and Tanzania)
* District of West Africa (Cameroon, Chad, Côte d&#x27;Ivoire, Ghana, Equatorial Guinea, Liberia)
* Province of Madagascar
* Province of Nigeria

==Cases of child abuse==
===Marist statement about abuse===

In 2017, the Marist Brothers released a statement to survivors and victims of abuse. It was issued by the 22nd General Chapter and stated that &quot;Abuse is the very antithesis of our Marist values, and undermines the very purpose of our Institute. Any abuse of children is a betrayal of the noble ideals of our founder, St Marcellin Champagnat&quot;.

Then the institution fought against adequate compensation measures for survivors of the abuse. 

The Marist Brothers then offered less in compensation to Fijian survivors, than they had in New Zealand, leading to accusations of racism. 

===Australian Royal Commission===

From June 2014, the Royal Commission into Institutional Responses to Child Sexual Abuse, initiated as a royal commission of inquiry by the Australian Government and supported by all of its state governments, began investigating the response of Marist Brothers to allegations of child sexual abuse in schools in the ACT, NSW and Queensland. A number of expert witnesses, former students, former teachers, former principals, former and current Marist officials and clergy, and one of the clergy at the centre of the allegations gave evidence or made statements before the commission.

In 2017, the Commission published a report which documents significant evidence of child abuse at the hand of members of the Marist order and evidence that the response of the order systematically exacerbated the problems relating to abuse. Included in the report was a finding that &quot;many alleged perpetrators remained in the same positions with access to children for years and sometimes decades after initial and successive allegations of child sexual abuse were raised&quot;. In many cases the Commission heard of &quot;the minimisation of allegations of child sexual abuse&quot;. One of the key systematic issues that came to light was that it was typical for Brothers to move through many communities and ministries in their lifetime. In the 1960s and 1970s there were typically up to 100 transfers each year. As of 2017, compensation payments made totaled approximately $AUD2.7 million.

In March 2015, a former Marist Brother was arrested over a number of sex offences allegedly committed at St Joseph&#x27;s College in and St Gregory&#x27;s College in Campbelltown in the 1980s.

In September 2016, during a Royal Commission hearing, the Brother Provincial of the Marist Brothers in Australia, Brother Peter Carroll, formally apologised to the family of Andrew Nash, whose suicide in 1974 at the age of 13 almost certainly resulted from sexual abuse by three of the order&#x27;s predatory brothers – Dominic, Patrick and Romuald – and acknowledged that they had many more victims than the dozens who had come forward so far.

Other cases, documented in the report, included those related to Brother Chute who, in 2008, was convicted of 19 child sex offences against six of his former students during the period 1985 to 1989. 48 claims had been made of abuse that occurred from 1959 to 1990 at 6 different schools, while 40 students at Marist College Canberra laid complaints during the period 1976 to 1990. The Marist Brothers did not report any allegations of child sexual abuse to the police in the period 1962 to 1993.

Separately, in August 1996, Brother Gregory Sutton pleaded guilty to a total of 67 child sex offences in relation to 15 students at schools in New South Wales. He had taught at 6 Marist schools between 1970 and 1986 and there were complaints about the abuse of 27 children made against him during this period.

In September 2018, Australian Marist Brother Gerard McNamara, 80, was sentenced to nine months in prison for molesting five boys at St Paul&#x27;s Catholic College, where he served as principal between 1970 and 1975. He had molested one of these boy 30 times. In May 2020, McNamara began serving a second stint in prison after pleading guilty to indecent assault of more than 15 male students between 1970 and 1975. This time, he received a sentence of 35 months in prison, with 28 months suspended. Since his first sex abuse conviction in June 2006, which resulted in a suspended prison sentence, McNamara received three additional convictions and sentences on sex abuse charges, but was able to once again receive a suspended prison sentence following another conviction in December 2016.

===Cases of abuse in New Zealand===

Marist Brother Claudius Pettit, real name Malcolm Thomas Petit, was convicted of child-sex abuse of a boy at a Wellington school in the 1990s. In 2005, John Louis Stevenson (known as Brother Bernard) and Brother Andrew Cody of the Hato Paora Māori Boys school in Feilding were convicted of sexual offenses and jailed. A Br. Aiden Benefield (Napier) was convicted of possessing child pornography in 2007.

Subsequently, in 2020, Kevin Healy (Brother Gordon) was convicted of four charges of indecency (from 1976 to 1977) between a man and boys aged 12 and 13, and one of indecency with a girl aged under 12.

Another was Ray Gannaway, known as Brother Ivan, who taught in Wellington and Auckland.

===Cases of abuse in Europe===

As of March 2016, 29 complaints had been made against six former teachers from three Marist schools in Barcelona in Spain, with three of these teachers confessing to sexual abuse. By February 2019, the number of complaints against Barcelona Marist school teachers had increased to 43, with 12 teachers named as suspected abusers. Two Barcelona Marist Brothers were criminally charged, with one being convicted. The trial for the second defendant commenced in March 2019, who declared in court that the institution knew about the abuses but took no action so he &quot;felt protected by the Marists&quot;. He was sentenced to 21 years and 9 months in prison for sexually abusing four children, with the Marist Brothers paying 120,000 euros to each of his proven victims.

Similar cases were reported in Ireland, with a Marist Brother being the first member of a religious order convicted of child sexual abuse in Ireland. Several Marist Brothers were convicted of abuse at a number of schools and a judgement by the Supreme Court of Ireland found the order &quot;vicariously liable&quot; for abuses.

In Scotland, the Marist Brothers issued an apology in 2021 for the &quot;systemic abuse of children&quot; at several schools.

===Cases of abuse in Chile===

Abuse cases in Marist facilities in Chile included several involving diocesan priests Cristián Precht Bañados and Miguel Ortega of the Archdiocese of Santiago. Chilean police investigated the claims. Precht was suspended from ministry between 2012 and 2017 after being convicted by the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith. In 2012, Ortega was found guilty of sexually molesting boys and sentenced to 32 years in prison; he died in 2015. On 12 September 2018, Precht was charged and laicized. Precht had been incardinated in the Archdiocese of Santiago, and gained national recognition in the 1980s when he served as head of the Church&#x27;s Vicariate of Solidarity human rights group that challenged ex-dictator Augusto Pinochet to end the practice of torture in Chile.

In 2017, the Chilean Marist Brothers revealed that at least 14 minors were abused by Marist Brother Abel Perez from the 1970s until 2000 at several schools in Chile. Perez confessed to his superiors in 2010, and was transferred to Peru.

<text>John Saul (born February 25, 1942) is an American author of suspense and horror novels. Most of his books have appeared on the &quot;New York Times&quot; Best Seller list.

==Biography==

Born in Pasadena, Saul grew up in Whittier, California, and graduated from Whittier High School in 1959. He went on to several colleges, including Cerritos College, Antioch College, San Francisco State University and Montana State University, variously majoring in anthropology, liberal arts and theater, but remains degree-less. After leaving college, Saul decided to become a writer, and spent 15 years working in various jobs while learning his craft.

Prior to the start of his career writing thrillers, Saul had around 10 books published under pen names, the first of which he wrote in one weekend after unexpectedly losing his job. His first book sale earned him $200. Today he has over 60 million books in print.

In 1976, Dell Publishing contacted him about his writing a psychological thriller. The resulting novel, &quot;Suffer the Children&quot;, appeared on all the bestseller lists in the United States and reached the number one spot in Canada. His 1979 novel &quot;Cry for the Strangers&quot; was made into a 1982 TV movie starring Patrick Duffy and Cindy Pickett. In addition to his novels, Saul has had several one-act plays produced in Los Angeles and Seattle.

Saul lives part-time in the Pacific Northwest, both in Seattle and in the San Juan Islands, and has a residence on the Big Island of Hawaii. Saul is openly gay. He lives with his partner of almost 50 years (since 1975) who has collaborated on several of his novels. He is a frequent speaker at the Maui Writers&#x27; Conference.

In 2023, Saul received the Bram Stoker Award for Lifetime Achievement.

<doc id="732655" wikidata="Q218087" url="?curid=732655" title="Bel and the Dragon">
<text>The narrative of Bel and the Dragon is incorporated as chapter 14 of the extended Book of Daniel. The original Septuagint text in Greek survives in a single manuscript, Codex Chisianus, while the standard text is due to Theodotion, the 2nd-century AD revisor.

This chapter, along with chapter 13, is considered deuterocanonical: it was unknown to early Rabbinic Judaism, and while it is considered non-canonical by most Protestants, it is canonical to Catholic and Eastern Orthodox Christians, and is found in the Apocrypha section of some Protestant Bibles.

== Summaries ==
The chapter contains a single story which may previously have represented three separate narratives, which place Daniel at the court of Cyrus, king of the Persians: &quot;When King Astyages was laid to rest with his ancestors, Cyrus the Persian succeeded to his kingdom.&quot; There Daniel &quot;was a companion of the king, and was the most honored of all his Friends&quot;. However, while Theodotion&#x27;s Greek apparently dates the story to the time of Astyages, the Old Greek versions of the story do not specify this. As such, the real identity of the king is up for debate. Some Bibles, such as the Douay-Rheims, use the more traditional identification of this king as being Evil-Merodach, or Amel-Marduk. This identification is supported by the Scriptural Research Institute in their book &quot;Septuagint: Daniel&quot;, where they cited similarities between Amel-Marduk&#x27;s reign and the account, namely that Amel-Marduk was the only king of Babylon to have seen religious riots during his reign.

=== Bel ===

The narrative of Bel (Daniel 14:1–22) ridicules the worship of idols. The king asks Daniel, &quot;You do not think Bel is a living god? Do you not see how much he eats and drinks every day?&quot; to which Daniel answers that the idol is made of clay covered by bronze and thus cannot eat or drink. Enraged, the king then demands that the seventy priests of Bel show him who consumes the offerings made to the idol. The priests then challenge the king to set the offerings as usual (which were &quot;twelve great measures of fine flour, and forty sheep, and six vessels of wine&quot;) and then seal the entrance to the temple with his ring: if Bel does not consume the offerings, the priests are to be sentenced to death; otherwise, Daniel is to be killed.

Daniel then uncovers the ruse (by scattering ashes over the floor of the temple in the presence of the king after the priests have left) and shows that the &quot;sacred&quot; meal of Bel is actually consumed at night by the priests and their wives and children, who enter through a secret door when the temple&#x27;s doors are sealed.

The next morning, the king comes to inspect the test by observing from above. He sees that the food has been consumed and points out that the wax seals he put on the temple doors are unbroken, and offers a hosanna to Bel. Daniel calls attention to the footprints on the temple floor; which the king then realizes by seeing footprints, along with more slender ones and smaller ones, shows that women and children also participated in the gluttony. The priests of Bel are then arrested and, confessing their deed, reveal the secret passage that they used to sneak inside the temple. They, their wives and children are put to death, and Daniel is permitted to destroy the idol of Bel and the temple. This version has been cited as an ancestor of the &quot;locked-room mystery&quot;.

=== The dragon ===
According to the brief companion narrative of the dragon (Daniel 14:23–30), &quot;there was a great dragon which the Babylonians revered&quot;. Some time after the temple&#x27;s condemnation the Babylonians worship the dragon. The king says that, unlike Bel, the dragon is a clear example of a live animal. Daniel promises to slay the dragon without the aid of a sword, and does so by baking pitch, fat, and hair (&quot;trichas&quot;) to make cakes (&quot;mazas&quot;, barley-cakes) that cause the dragon to burst open upon consumption. In other variants, other ingredients serve the purpose: in a form known to the Midrash, straw was fed in which nails were hidden, or skins of camels were filled with hot coals. A similar story occurs in the Persian poet Ferdowsi&#x27;s Shahnameh, where Alexander the Great, or &quot;Iskandar&quot;, kills a dragon by feeding it cow hides stuffed with poison and tar.

Earlier scholarship has suggested a parallel between this text and the contest between Marduk and Tiamat in Mesopotamian mythology, where the winds controlled by Marduk burst Tiamat open and barley-cake plays the same role as the wind. However, David DeSilva (2018) casts doubt on this reading.

<doc id="732656" wikidata="Q422188" url="?curid=732656" title="Spironolactone">
<text>Spironolactone, sold under the brand name Aldactone among others, is a diuretic medication primarily used to treat fluid build-up due to heart failure, liver scarring, or kidney disease. It is also used in the treatment of high blood pressure, and low blood potassium that does not improve with supplementation, early puberty in boys, acne and excessive hair growth in women. It can also be used to block the effects of testosterone in transgender women and nonbinary people undergoing feminizing hormone replacement therapy. Spironolactone is usually available in tablets, taken by mouth, though topical forms are also available.
Common side effects include electrolyte abnormalities, particularly high blood potassium, nausea, vomiting, headache, rashes, and a decreased desire for sex. In those with liver or kidney problems, extra care should be taken. Spironolactone has not been well studied in pregnancy and should not be used to treat high blood pressure of pregnancy. It is also a steroid that blocks the effects of the hormones aldosterone and, to a lesser degree, testosterone, causing some estrogen-like effects. Spironolactone belongs to a class of medications known as potassium-sparing diuretics.
Spironolactone was discovered in 1957, and was introduced in 1959. It is on the World Health Organization&#x27;s List of Essential Medicines. It is available as a generic medication. In 2022, it was the 52nd most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 12million prescriptions. Spironolactone has a history of use in the trans community. Its use continues despite the rise of various accessible alternatives such as bicalutamide and cyproterone acetate with more precise action and less side effects.
==Medical uses==
Spironolactone is used primarily to treat heart failure, edematous conditions such as nephrotic syndrome or ascites in people with liver disease, essential hypertension, low blood levels of potassium, secondary hyperaldosteronism (such as occurs with liver cirrhosis), and Conn&#x27;s syndrome (primary hyperaldosteronism). The most common use of spironolactone is in the treatment of heart failure. On its own, spironolactone is only a weak diuretic because it primarily targets the distal nephron (collecting tubule), where only small amounts of sodium are reabsorbed, but it can be combined with other diuretics to increase efficacy. The classification of spironolactone as a &quot;potassium-sparing diuretic&quot; has been described as obsolete. Spironolactone is also used to treat Bartter&#x27;s syndrome due to its ability to raise potassium levels.

Spironolactone has antiandrogenic activity. For this reason, it is used to treat a variety of dermatological conditions in which androgens play a role. Some of these uses include acne, seborrhea, hirsutism, and pattern hair loss in women. Spironolactone is used for the treatment of hirsutism in the United States. High doses of spironolactone, which are needed for considerable antiandrogenic effects, are not recommended for men due to the high risk of feminization and other side effects. Spironolactone can be used to treat symptoms of hyperandrogenism, such as due to polycystic ovary syndrome.

===Heart failure===
While loop diuretics remain first-line for most people with heart failure, spironolactone has been shown to reduce both morbidity and mortality in numerous studies and remains an important agent for treating fluid retention, edema, and symptoms of heart failure. Current recommendations from the American Heart Association are to use spironolactone in patients with NYHA Class II-IV heart failure who have a left ventricular ejection fraction of less than 35%.

Spironolactone improves left ventricular diastolic function in patients with heart failure with preserved ejection fraction, however it has no effect on mortality and hospitalization.

Due to its antiandrogenic properties, spironolactone can cause effects associated with low androgen levels and hypogonadism in males. For this reason, men are typically not prescribed spironolactone for any longer than a short period of time, e.g., for an acute exacerbation of heart failure. A newer medication, eplerenone, has been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of heart failure, and lacks the antiandrogenic effects of spironolactone. As such, it is far more suitable for men for whom long-term medication is being chosen. However, eplerenone may not be as effective as spironolactone or the related medication canrenone in reducing mortality from heart failure.

===High blood pressure===
About 1 in 100 people with hypertension have elevated levels of aldosterone; in these people, the antihypertensive effect of spironolactone may exceed that of complex combined regimens of other antihypertensives since it targets the primary cause of the elevated blood pressure. However, a Cochrane review found adverse effects at high doses and little effect on blood pressure at low doses in the majority of people with high blood pressure. There is no evidence of person-oriented outcome at any dose in this group.

===High aldosterone levels===
Spironolactone is used in the treatment of hyperaldosteronism (high aldosterone levels or mineralocorticoid excess), for instance primary aldosteronism (Conn&#x27;s syndrome). Antimineralocorticoids like spironolactone and eplerenone are first-line treatments for hyperaldosteronism. They improve blood pressure and potassium levels, as well as left ventricular hypertrophy, albuminuria, and carotid intima-media thickness, in people with primary aldosteronism. In people with hyperaldosteronism due to unilateral aldosterone-producing adrenocortical adenoma, adrenalectomy should be preferred instead of antimineralocorticoids. Spironolactone should not be used to treat primary aldosteronism in pregnancy due to its antiandrogen-related risk of teratogenicity in male fetuses.

===Skin and hair conditions===
Androgens like testosterone and DHT play a critical role in the pathogenesis of a number of dermatological conditions including oily skin, acne, seborrhea, hirsutism (excessive facial/body hair growth in women), and male pattern hair loss (androgenic alopecia). In demonstration of this, women with complete androgen insensitivity syndrome (CAIS) do not produce sebum or develop acne and have little to no body, pubic, or axillary hair. Moreover, men with congenital 5α-reductase type II deficiency, 5α-reductase being an enzyme that greatly potentiates the androgenic effects of testosterone in the skin, have little to no acne, scanty facial hair, reduced body hair, and reportedly no incidence of male-pattern hair loss. Conversely, hyperandrogenism in women, for instance due to polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) or congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH), is commonly associated with acne and hirsutism as well as virilization (masculinization) in general. In accordance with the preceding, antiandrogens are highly effective in the treatment of the aforementioned androgen-dependent skin and hair conditions.

Because of the antiandrogenic activity of spironolactone, it can be quite effective in treating acne in women. In addition, spironolactone reduces oil that is naturally produced in the skin and can be used to treat oily skin. Though not the primary intended purpose of the medication, the ability of spironolactone to be helpful with problematic skin and acne conditions was discovered to be one of the beneficial side effects and has been quite successful. Oftentimes, for women treating acne, spironolactone is prescribed and paired with a birth control pill. Positive results in the pairing of these two medications have been observed, although these results may not be seen for up to three months. Spironolactone has been reported to produce a 50 to 100% improvement in acne at sufficiently high doses. Response to treatment generally requires 1 to 3 months in the case of acne and up to 6 months in the case of hirsutism. Ongoing therapy is generally required to avoid relapse of symptoms. Spironolactone is commonly used in the treatment of hirsutism in women, and is considered to be a first-line antiandrogen for this indication. Spironolactone can be used in the treatment of female-pattern hair loss (pattern scalp hair loss in women). There is tentative low quality evidence supporting its use for this indication. Although apparently effective, not all cases of female-pattern hair loss are dependent on androgens.

Antiandrogens like spironolactone are male-specific teratogens which can feminize male fetuses due to their antiandrogenic effects. For this reason, it is recommended that antiandrogens only be used to treat women who are of reproductive age in conjunction with adequate contraception. Oral contraceptives, which contain an estrogen and a progestin, are typically used for this purpose. Moreover, oral contraceptives themselves are functional antiandrogens and are independently effective in the treatment of androgen-dependent skin and hair conditions, and hence can significantly augment the effectiveness of antiandrogens in the treatment of such conditions.

Spironolactone is not generally used in men for the treatment of androgen-dependent dermatological conditions because of its feminizing side effects, but it is effective for such indications in men similarly. As an example, spironolactone has been reported to reduce symptoms of acne in males. An additional example is the usefulness of spironolactone as an antiandrogen in transgender women and nonbinary individuals.

Topical spironolactone is effective in the treatment of acne as well. As a result, topical pharmaceutical formulations containing 2% or 5% spironolactone cream became available in Italy for the treatment of acne and hirsutism in the early 1990s. The products were discontinued in 2006 when the creams were added to the list of doping substances with a decree of the Ministry of Health that year.

====Comparison====
Spironolactone, the 5α-reductase inhibitor finasteride, and the nonsteroidal antiandrogen flutamide all appear to have similar effectiveness in the treatment of hirsutism. However, some clinical research has found that the effectiveness of spironolactone for hirsutism is greater than that of finasteride but is less than that of flutamide. The combination of spironolactone with finasteride is more effective than either alone for hirsutism and the combination of spironolactone with a birth control pill is more effective than a birth control pill alone. One study showed that spironolactone or the steroidal antiandrogen cyproterone acetate both in combination with a birth control pill had equivalent effectiveness for hirsutism. Spironolactone is considered to be a first-line treatment for hirsutism, finasteride and the steroidal antiandrogen cyproterone acetate are considered to be second-line treatments, and flutamide is no longer recommended for hirsutism due to liver toxicity concerns. The nonsteroidal antiandrogen bicalutamide is an alternative option to flutamide with improved safety.

The combination of spironolactone with a birth control pill in the treatment of acne appears to have similar effectiveness to a birth control pill alone and the combination of a birth control pill with cyproterone acetate, flutamide, or finasteride. However, this was based on low- to very-low-quality evidence. Spironolactone may be more effective than birth control pills in the treatment of acne, and the combination of spironolactone with a birth control pill may have greater effectiveness for acne than either alone. In addition, some clinical research has found that flutamide is more effective than spironolactone in the treatment of acne. In one study, flutamide decreased acne scores by 80% within 3 months, whereas spironolactone decreased symptoms by only 40% in the same period. However, the use of flutamide for acne is limited by its liver toxicity. Bicalutamide is a potential alternative to flutamide for acne as well. Spironolactone can be considered as a first-line treatment for acne in those who have failed other standard treatments such as topical therapies and under certain other circumstances, although this is controversial due to the side effects of spironolactone and its teratogenicity.

There is insufficient clinical evidence to compare the effectiveness of spironolactone with other antiandrogens for female-pattern hair loss. The effectiveness of spironolactone in the treatment of both acne and hirsutism appears to be dose-dependent, with higher doses being more effective than lower doses. However, higher doses also have greater side effects, such as menstrual irregularities.

===Transgender hormone therapy===

Despite paradoxical reactions, spironolactone is used off-label as a component of feminizing hormone therapy in transgender women, especially in the United States (where cyproterone acetate is not available), usually in addition to an estrogen. Alternatives like bicalutamide do not have a similar level of popularity. As spironolactone&#x27;s antiandrogenic effect appears only in high doses, it can have a wide array of side effects not found in antiandrogens working more exclusively on the androgen receptor. When coupled with estradiol, effects in transgender women include decreased male pattern body hair, induction of breast development and of feminization in general, and reduced spontaneous erections.

===Forms===
Spironolactone is available in the form of tablets (25 mg, 50 mg, 100 mg; brand name Aldactone, others) and suspensions (25 mg/5 mL; brand name Carospir) for use by mouth. It has also been marketed in the form of 2% and 5% topical cream in Italy for the treatment of acne and hirsutism under the brand name Spiroderm, but this product is no longer available. The medication is also available in combination with other medications, such as hydrochlorothiazide (brand name Aldactazide, others). Spironolactone has poor water solubility, and for this reason, only oral and topical formulations have been developed; other routes of administration such as intravenous injection are not used. The only antimineralocorticoid that is available as a solution for parenteral use is the related medication potassium canrenoate.

==Contraindications==
Contraindications of spironolactone include hyperkalemia (high potassium levels), severe and end-stage kidney disease (due to high hyperkalemia risk, except possibly in those on dialysis), Addison&#x27;s disease (adrenal insufficiency and low aldosterone levels), and concomitant use of eplerenone. It should also be used with caution in people with certain neurological disorders, as well as those who experience or have experienced anuria (lack of urine production), acute kidney injury, or significant impairment of kidney excretory function with risk of hyperkalemia.

==Side effects==
One of the most common side effects of spironolactone is frequent urination. Other general side effects include dehydration, hyponatremia (low sodium levels), mild hypotension (low blood pressure), ataxia (muscle incoordination), drowsiness, dizziness, dry skin, and rashes. Because of its antiandrogenic activity, spironolactone can cause breast tenderness, gynecomastia (breast development), feminization in general, and demasculinization, as well as sexual dysfunction including loss of libido and erectile dysfunction, although these side effects are usually confined to high doses of spironolactone. At very high doses (400 mg/day), spironolactone has also been associated with testicular atrophy and reversibly reduced fertility, including semen abnormalities such as decreased sperm count and motility in cis men. However, such doses of spironolactone are rarely used clinically. In cis women, spironolactone can cause menstrual irregularities, breast tenderness, and breast enlargement. Aside from these adverse effects, the side effects of spironolactone in women taking high doses are minimal, and it is well tolerated.

A potential side effect of spironolactone is hyperkalemia (high potassium levels), which, in severe cases, can be life-threatening. Hyperkalemia can present as a normal anion-gap metabolic acidosis. It has been reported that the addition of spironolactone to loop diuretics in people with heart failure was associated with a higher risk of hyperkalemia and acute kidney injury. Spironolactone may put people at a heightened risk for gastrointestinal issues like nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, cramping, and gastritis. In addition, there has been some evidence suggesting an association between use of the medication and bleeding from the stomach and duodenum, though a causal relationship between the two has not been established. Also, spironolactone is immunosuppressive in the treatment of sarcoidosis.

Most of the side effects of spironolactone are dose-dependent. Low-dose spironolactone is generally very well tolerated. Even higher doses of spironolactone, such as 100 mg/day, are well tolerated in most individuals. Dose-dependent side effects of spironolactone include menstrual irregularities, breast tenderness, and enlargement, orthostatic hypotension, and hyperkalemia. The side effects of spironolactone are usually mild and rarely result in discontinuation.

===High potassium levels===
Spironolactone can cause hyperkalemia, or high blood potassium levels. Rarely, this can be fatal. Of people with heart disease prescribed typical dosages of spironolactone, 10 to 15% develop some degree of hyperkalemia, and 6% develop severe hyperkalemia. At a higher dosage, a rate of hyperkalemia of 24% has been observed. An abrupt and major increase in the rate of hospitalization due to hyperkalemia from 0.2% to 11% and in the rate of death due to hyperkalemia from 0.3 per 1,000 to 2.0 per 1,000 between early 1994 and late 2001 has been attributed to a parallel rise in the number of prescriptions written for spironolactone upon the publication of the Randomized Aldactone Evaluation Study (RALES) in July 1999. However, another population-based study in Scotland failed to replicate these findings. The risk of hyperkalemia with spironolactone is greatest in the elderly, in people with renal impairment (e.g., due to chronic kidney disease or diabetic nephropathy), in people taking certain other medications (including inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor blockers, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, the antibiotic trimethoprim, and potassium supplements), and at higher dosages of spironolactone.

Although spironolactone poses an important risk of hyperkalemia in the elderly, in those with kidney or cardiovascular disease, and/or in those taking medications or supplements which increase circulating potassium levels, a large retrospective study found that the rate of hyperkalemia in young women without such characteristics who had been treated with high doses of spironolactone for dermatological conditions did not differ from that of controls. This was the conclusion of a 2017 hybrid systematic review of studies of spironolactone for acne in women as well, which found that hyperkalemia was rare and was invariably mild and clinically insignificant. These findings suggest that hyperkalemia may not be a significant risk in such individuals, and that routine monitoring of circulating potassium levels may be unnecessary in this population. However, other sources have claimed that hyperkalemia can nonetheless also occur in people with more normal renal function and presumably without such risk factors. Occasional testing on a case-by-case basis in those with known risk factors may be justified. Side effects of spironolactone which may be indicative of hyperkalemia and if persistent could justify serum potassium testing include nausea, fatigue, and particularly muscle weakness. Notably, non-use of routine potassium monitoring with spironolactone in young women would reduce costs associated with its use.

Among young gender-diverse individuals taking spironolactone, hyperkalemia is rare and (if present) transient and asymptomatic. Larger doses do not appear to increase risks in this population. A broader retrospective study found that the rate of hyperkalemia in gender-diverse individuals is correlated with age, with those above 45 years old being more at risk. The finding suggests that patients below or at 45 years old without other conditions that affect potassium handling can be spared from routine monitoring.

===Breast changes===
Spironolactone can cause breast pain and breast enlargement in women. This is &quot;probably because of estrogenic effects on target tissue.&quot; At low doses, breast tenderness has been reported in only 5% of women, but at high doses, it has been reported in up to 40% of women. Breast enlargement and tenderness may occur in 26% of women at high doses. Some women regard spironolactone-induced breast enlargement as a positive effect.

Spironolactone also commonly and dose-dependently produces gynecomastia (breast development) as a side effect in men. At low doses, the rate is only 5 to 10%, but at high doses, up to or exceeding 50% of men may develop gynecomastia. In the RALES, 9.1% of men taking 25 mg/day spironolactone developed gynecomastia, compared to 1.3% of controls. Conversely, in studies of healthy men given high-dose spironolactone, gynecomastia occurred in 3 of 10 (30%) at 100 mg/day, in 5 of 8 (62.5%) at 200 mg/day, and in 6 of 9 (66.7%) at 400 mg/day, relative to none of 12 controls. The severity of gynecomastia with spironolactone varies considerably, but is usually mild. As with breast enlargement caused by spironolactone in women, gynecomastia due to spironolactone in men is often although inconsistently accompanied by breast tenderness. In the RALES, only 1.7% of men developed breast pain, relative to 0.1% of controls.

The time to onset of spironolactone-induced gynecomastia has been found to be 27 ± 20 months at low doses and 9 ± 12 months at high doses. Gynecomastia induced by spironolactone usually regresses after a few weeks following discontinuation of the medication. However, after a sufficient duration of gynecomastia being present (e.g., one year), hyalinization and fibrosis of the tissue occurs and drug-induced gynecomastia may become irreversible.

===Menstrual disturbances===
Spironolactone at higher doses can cause menstrual irregularities as a side effect in women. These irregularities include metrorrhagia (intermenstrual bleeding), amenorrhea (absence of menstruation), and breakthrough bleeding. They are common during spironolactone therapy, with 10 to 50% of women experiencing them at moderate doses and almost all experiencing them at a high doses. For example, about 20% of women experienced menstrual irregularities with 50 to 100 mg/day spironolactone, whereas about 70% experienced menstrual irregularities at 200 mg/day. Most women taking moderate doses of spironolactone develop amenorrhea, and normal menstruation usually returns within two months of discontinuation. Spironolactone produces an irregular and anovulatory pattern of menstrual cycles. It is also associated with metrorrhagia and menorrhagia (heavy menstrual bleeding) in large percentages of women, as well as with polymenorrhea (short menstrual cycles). The medication reportedly has no birth control effect.

It has been suggested that the weak progestogenic activity of spironolactone is responsible for these effects, although this has not been established and spironolactone has been shown to possess insignificant progestogenic and antiprogestogenic activity even at high dosages in women. An alternative proposed cause is inhibition of 17α-hydroxylase and hence sex steroid metabolism by spironolactone and consequent changes in sex hormone levels. Indeed, CYP17A1 genotype is associated with polymenorrhea. Regardless of their mechanism, the menstrual disturbances associated with spironolactone can usually be controlled well by concomitant treatment with a birth control pill, due to the progestin component.

===Mood changes===
Research is mixed on whether antimineralocorticoids like spironolactone have positive or negative effects on mood. In any case, it is possible that spironolactone might have the capacity to increase the risk of depressive symptoms. However, a 2017 hybrid systematic review found that the incidence of depression in women treated with spironolactone for acne was less than 1%. Likewise, a 10-year observational study found that the incidence of depression in 196 transgender women taking high-dose spironolactone in combination with an estrogen was less than 1%.

===Lipid changes===
Spironolactone has been found to increase LDL (&quot;bad&quot;) cholesterol and decrease HDL (&quot;good&quot;) cholesterol levels at the relatively high doses used in women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). As such, it may have unfavorable effects on the blood lipid profile in this context. Heightened LDL cholesterol levels are a potential risk factor for cardiovascular disease such as atherosclerosis or coronary heart disease. Consequently, it has been said that spironolactone should not be given to women with dyslipidemia (e.g., high cholesterol). Unfavorable lipid changes have also been seen with other antiandrogens, like cyproterone acetate and bicalutamide.

===Rare reactions===
Aside from hyperkalemia, spironolactone may rarely cause adverse reactions such as anaphylaxis, kidney failure, hepatitis (two reported cases, neither serious), agranulocytosis, DRESS syndrome, Stevens–Johnson syndrome or toxic epidermal necrolysis. Five cases of breast cancer in patients who took spironolactone for prolonged periods of time have been reported.

===Spironolactone bodies===
Long-term administration of spironolactone gives the histologic characteristic of &quot;spironolactone bodies&quot; in the adrenal cortex. Spironolactone bodies are eosinophilic, round, concentrically laminated cytoplasmic inclusions surrounded by clear halos in preparations stained with hematoxylin and eosin.

===Pregnancy and breastfeeding===
Spironolactone can cross the placenta. It has been found to be present in the breast milk of lactating mothers. However, only very small amounts of spironolactone and its metabolite canrenone enter breast milk, and the amount received by an infant during breastfeeding (&lt;0.5% of the mother&#x27;s dose) is considered to be insignificant.

A study found that spironolactone was not associated with teratogenicity in the offspring of rats. Because it is an antiandrogen, however, spironolactone could theoretically have the potential to cause feminization of male fetuses at sufficient doses. In accordance, a subsequent study found that partial feminization of the genitalia occurred in the male offspring of rats that received doses of spironolactone that were five times higher than those normally used in humans (200 mg/kg per day). Another study found permanent, dose-related reproductive tract abnormalities rat offspring of both sexes at lower doses (50 to 100 mg/kg per day).

In practice however, although experience is limited, spironolactone has never been reported to cause observable feminization or any other congenital defects in humans. Among 31 human newborns exposed to spironolactone in the first trimester, there were no signs of any specific birth defects. A case report described a woman who was prescribed spironolactone during pregnancy with triplets and delivered all three (one boy and two girls) healthy; there was no feminization in the boy. In addition, spironolactone has been used at high doses to treat pregnant women with Bartter&#x27;s syndrome, and none of the infants (three boys, two girls) showed toxicity, including feminization in the male infants. There are similar findings, albeit also limited, for another antiandrogen, cyproterone acetate (prominent genital defects in male rats, but no human abnormalities (including feminization of male fetuses) at both a low dose of 2 mg/day or high doses of 50 to 100 mg/day). In any case, spironolactone is nonetheless not recommended during pregnancy due to theoretical concerns relating to feminization of males and also to potential alteration of fetal potassium levels.

A 2019 systematic review found insufficient evidence that spironolactone causes birth defects in humans. However, there was also insufficient evidence to be certain that it does not.

==Overdose==
Spironolactone is relatively safe in acute overdose. Symptoms following an acute overdose of spironolactone may include drowsiness, confusion, maculopapular or erythematous rash, nausea, vomiting, dizziness, and diarrhea. In rare cases, hyponatremia, hyperkalemia, or hepatic coma may occur in individuals with severe liver disease. However, these adverse reactions are unlikely in the event of an acute overdose. Hyperkalemia can occur following an overdose of spironolactone, and this is especially so in people with decreased kidney function. Spironolactone has been studied at extremely high oral doses of up to 2,400 mg per day in clinical trials. Its oral median lethal dose (LD50) is more than 1,000 mg/kg in mice, rats, and rabbits.

There is no specific antidote for overdose of spironolactone. Treatment may consist of induction of vomiting or stomach evacuation by gastric lavage. The treatment of spironolactone overdose is supportive, with the purpose of maintaining hydration, electrolyte balance, and vital functions. Spironolactone should be discontinued in people with impaired kidney function or hyperkalemia.

== Interactions ==

Spironolactone often increases serum potassium levels and can cause hyperkalemia, a very serious condition. Therefore, it is recommended that people using this medication avoid potassium supplements and salt substitutes containing potassium. Physicians must be careful to monitor potassium levels in both males and females who are taking spironolactone as a diuretic, especially during the first twelve months of use and whenever the dosage is increased. Doctors may also recommend that some patients may be advised to limit dietary consumption of potassium-rich foods. However, recent data suggests that both potassium monitoring and dietary restriction of potassium intake is unnecessary in healthy young women taking spironolactone for acne and in healthy young gender-diverse individuals taking spironolactone for hormone therapy. Spironolactone together with trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole increases the likelihood of hyperkalemia, especially in the elderly. The trimethoprim portion acts to prevent potassium excretion in the distal tubule of the nephron.

Spironolactone has been reported to induce the enzymes CYP3A4 and certain UDP-glucuronosyltransferases (UGTs), which can result in interactions with various medications. However, it has also been reported that metabolites of spironolactone irreversibly inhibit CYP3A4. In any case, spironolactone has been found to reduce the bioavailability of oral estradiol, which could be due to induction of estradiol metabolism via CYP3A4. Spironolactone has also been found to inhibit UGT2B7. Spironolactone can also have numerous other interactions, most commonly with other cardiac and blood pressure medications, for instance digoxin.

Licorice, which has indirect mineralocorticoid activity by inhibiting mineralocorticoid metabolism, has been found to inhibit the antimineralocorticoid effects of spironolactone. Moreover, the addition of licorice to spironolactone has been found to reduce the antimineralocorticoid side effects of spironolactone in women treated with it for hyperandrogenism, and licorice hence may be used to reduce these side effects in women treated with spironolactone as an antiandrogen who are bothered by them. On the opposite end of the spectrum, spironolactone is useful in reversing licorice-induced hypokalemia. Aspirin and other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) have been found to attenuate the diuresis and natriuresis induced by spironolactone, but, not to affect its antihypertensive effect.

Some research has suggested that spironolactone might be able to interfere with the effectiveness of antidepressant treatment. As the medication acts as an antimineralocorticoid, it is thought that it might be able to reduce the effectiveness of certain antidepressants by interfering with normalization of the hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal axis and by increasing levels of glucocorticoids such as cortisol. However, other research contradicts this hypothesis and has suggested that spironolactone might produce antidepressant effects. For instance, studies showing antidepressant-like effects of spironolactone in animals.

==Pharmacology==

===Pharmacodynamics===


The pharmacodynamics of spironolactone are characterized by high antimineralocorticoid activity, moderate antiandrogenic activity, and weak steroidogenesis inhibition, among other more minor activities. Spironolactone is a prodrug, so most of its actions are actually mediated by its various active metabolites. The major active forms of spironolactone are 7α-thiomethylspironolactone (7α-TMS) and canrenone (7α-desthioacetyl-δ6-spironolactone).

Spironolactone is a potent antimineralocorticoid. That is, it is an antagonist of the mineralocorticoid receptor (MR), the biological target of mineralocorticoids like aldosterone and 11-deoxycorticosterone. By blocking the MR, spironolactone inhibits the effects of mineralocorticoids in the body. The antimineralocorticoid activity of spironolactone is responsible for its therapeutic efficacy in the treatment of edema, high blood pressure, heart failure, hyperaldosteronism, and ascites due to cirrhosis. It is also responsible for many of the side effects of spironolactone, such as urinary frequency, dehydration, hyponatremia, low blood pressure, fatigue, dizziness, metabolic acidosis, decreased kidney function, and its risk of hyperkalemia. Due to the antimineralocorticoid activity of spironolactone, levels of aldosterone are significantly increased by the medication, probably reflecting an attempt of the body to maintain homeostasis.

Spironolactone is a moderate antiandrogen. That is, it is an antagonist of the androgen receptor (AR), the biological target of androgens like testosterone and dihydrotestosterone (DHT). By blocking the AR, spironolactone inhibits the effects of androgens in the body. The antiandrogenic activity of spironolactone is mainly responsible for its therapeutic efficacy in the treatment of androgen-dependent skin and hair conditions like acne, seborrhea, hirsutism, and pattern hair loss and hyperandrogenism in women, precocious puberty in boys with testotoxicosis, and as a component of feminizing hormone therapy for transgender women. It is also primarily responsible for some of its side effects, like breast tenderness, gynecomastia, feminization, and demasculinization in men. Blockade of androgen signaling in the breast disinhibits the actions of estrogens in this tissue. Although useful as an antiandrogen in women, who have low testosterone levels compared to men, spironolactone is described as having relatively weak antiandrogenic activity.

Spironolactone is a weak steroidogenesis inhibitor. That is, it inhibits steroidogenic enzymes, or enzymes involved in the production of steroid hormones. Spironolactone and/or its metabolites have been found &quot;in vitro&quot; to weakly inhibit a broad array of steroidogenic enzymes including cholesterol side-chain cleavage enzyme, 17α-hydroxylase, 17,20-lyase, 5α-reductase, 3β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase, 11β-hydroxylase, 21-hydroxylase, and aldosterone synthase (18-hydroxylase). However, although very high doses of spironolactone can considerably decrease steroid hormone levels in animals, spironolactone has shown mixed and inconsistent effects on steroid hormone levels in clinical studies, even at high clinical doses. In any case, the levels of most steroid hormones, including testosterone and cortisol, are usually unchanged by spironolactone in humans, which may in part be related to compensatory upregulation of their synthesis. The weak steroidogenesis inhibition of spironolactone might contribute to its antiandrogenic efficacy to some degree and may explain its side effect of menstrual irregularities in women. However, its androgen synthesis inhibition is probably clinically insignificant.

Spironolactone has been found in some studies to increase levels of estradiol, an estrogen, although many other studies have found no changes in estradiol levels. The mechanism of how spironolactone increases estradiol levels is unclear, but it may involve inhibition of the inactivation of estradiol into estrone and enhancement of the peripheral conversion of testosterone into estradiol. It is notable that spironolactone has been found &quot;in vitro&quot; to act as a weak inhibitor of 17β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase 2, an enzyme that is involved in the conversion of estradiol into estrone. Increased levels of estradiol with spironolactone may be involved in its preservation of bone density and in its side effects such as breast tenderness, breast enlargement, and gynecomastia in women and men.

In response to the antimineralocorticoid activity spironolactone, and in an attempt to maintain homeostasis, the body increases aldosterone production in the adrenal cortex. Some studies have found that levels of cortisol, a glucocorticoid hormone that is also produced in the adrenal cortex, are increased as well. Spironolactone &quot;acts at the basolateral side of the upper-distal tubule as well as in the collecting tubule,&quot; and does not have glucocorticoid-like effects at these specific sites; it can sometimes be prescribed as an alternative to glucocorticoids for patients with Glucocorticoid-Remediable Aldosteronism characterized by aldosterone excess, In patients &quot;receiving spironolactone, there was a significant positive correlation between the change in cortisol and the change in HbA1c (r = 0.489, P = .003).&quot; Patients taking spironolactone must be monitored for side effects including dizziness, headache, fatigue, diarrhea, hypertriglyceridemia and elevated liver enzymes.

Other activities of spironolactone may include very weak interactions with the estrogen and progesterone receptors and agonism of the pregnane X receptor. These activities could contribute to the menstrual irregularities and breast side effects of spironolactone and to its drug interactions, respectively.

===Pharmacokinetics===
The pharmacokinetics of spironolactone have not been studied well, which is in part because it is an old medication that was developed in the 1950s. Nonetheless, much has been elucidated about the pharmacokinetics of spironolactone over the decades.

====Absorption====
The bioavailability of spironolactone when taken by mouth is 60 to 90%. The bioavailability of spironolactone and its metabolites increases significantly (+22–95% increases in levels) when spironolactone is taken with food, although it is uncertain whether this further increases the therapeutic effects of the medication. The increase in bioavailability is thought to be due to promotion of the gastric dissolution and absorption of spironolactone, as well as due to a decrease of the first-pass metabolism. The relationship between a single dose of spironolactone and plasma levels of canrenone, a major active metabolite of spironolactone, has been found to be linear across a dose range of 25 to 200 mg spironolactone. Steady-state concentrations of spironolactone are achieved within 8 to 10 days of treatment initiation.

Little or no systemic absorption has been observed with topical spironolactone.

====Distribution====
Spironolactone and its metabolite canrenone are highly plasma protein bound, with percentages of 88.0% and 99.2%, respectively. Spironolactone is bound equivalently to albumin and α1-acid glycoprotein, while canrenone is bound only to albumin. Spironolactone and its metabolite 7α-thiospironolactone show very low or negligible affinity for sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG). In accordance, a study of high-dosage spironolactone treatment found no change in steroid binding capacity related to SHBG or to corticosteroid-binding globulin (CBG), suggesting that spironolactone does not displace steroid hormones from their carrier proteins. This is in contradiction with widespread statements that spironolactone increases free estradiol levels by displacing estradiol from SHBG.

Spironolactone appears to cross the blood–brain barrier.

====Metabolism====
Spironolactone is rapidly and extensively metabolized in the liver upon oral administration and has a very short terminal half-life of 1.4 hours. The major metabolites of spironolactone are 7α-thiomethylspironolactone (7α-TMS), 6β-hydroxy-7α-thiomethylspironolactone (6β-OH-7α-TMS), and canrenone (7α-desthioacetyl-δ6-spironolactone). These metabolites have much longer elimination half-lives than spironolactone of 13.8 hours, 15.0 hours, and 16.5 hours, respectively, and are responsible for the therapeutic effects of the medication. As such, spironolactone is a prodrug. The 7α-thiomethylated metabolites of spironolactone were not known for many years and it was originally thought that canrenone was the major active metabolite of the medication, but subsequent research identified 7α-TMS as the major metabolite. Other known but more minor metabolites of spironolactone include 7α-thiospironolactone (7α-TS), which is an important intermediate to the major metabolites of spironolactone, as well as the 7α-methyl ethyl ester of spironolactone and the 6β-hydroxy-7α-methyl ethyl ester of spironolactone.

Spironolactone is hydrolyzed or deacetylated at the thioester of the C7α position into 7α-TS by carboxylesterases. Following formation of 7α-TS, it is &quot;S&quot;-oxygenated by flavin-containing monooxygenases to form an electrophilic sulfenic acid metabolite. This metabolite is involved in the CYP450 inhibition of spironolactone, and also binds covalently to other proteins. 7α-TS is also &quot;S&quot;-methylated into 7α-TMS, a transformation catalyzed by thiol &quot;S&quot;-methyltransferase. Unlike the related medication eplerenone, spironolactone is said to not be metabolized by CYP3A4. However, hepatic CYP3A4 is likely responsible for the 6β-hydroxylation of 7α-TMS into 6β-OH-7α-TMS. 7α-TMS may also be hydroxylated at the C3α and C3β positions. Spironolactone is dethioacetylated into canrenone. Finally, the C17 γ-lactone ring of spironolactone is hydrolyzed by the paraoxonase PON3. It was originally thought to be hydrolyzed by PON1, but this was due to contamination with PON3.

====Elimination====
The majority of spironolactone is eliminated by the kidneys, while minimal amounts are handled by biliary excretion.

==Chemistry==
Spironolactone, also known as &quot;7α-acetylthiospirolactone&quot;, is a steroidal 17α-spirolactone, or more simply a spirolactone. It can most appropriately be conceptualized as a derivative of progesterone, itself also a potent antimineralocorticoid, in which a hydroxyl group has been substituted at the C17α position (as in 17α-hydroxyprogesterone), the acetyl group at the C17β position has been cyclized with the C17α hydroxyl group to form a spiro 21-carboxylic acid γ-lactone ring, and an acetylthio group has been substituted in at the C7α position. These structural modifications of progesterone confer increased oral bioavailability and potency, potent antiandrogenic activity, and strongly reduced progestogenic activity. The C7α substitution is likely responsible for or involved in the antiandrogenic activity of spironolactone, as 7α-thioprogesterone (SC-8365), unlike progesterone, is an antiandrogen with similar affinity to the AR as that of spironolactone. In addition, the C7α substitution appears to be responsible for the loss of progestogenic activity and good oral bioavailability of spironolactone, as SC-5233, the analogue of spironolactone without a C7α substitution, has potent progestogenic activity but very poor oral bioavailability similarly to progesterone.

===Names===
Spironolactone is also known by the following equivalent chemical names:

Spironolactone is closely related structurally to other clinically used spirolactones such as canrenone, potassium canrenoate, drospirenone, and eplerenone, as well as to the never-marketed spirolactones SC-5233 (6,7-dihydrocanrenone; 7α-desthioacetylspironolactone), SC-8109 (19-nor-6,7-dihydrocanrenone), spiroxasone, prorenone (SC-23133), mexrenone (SC-25152, ZK-32055), dicirenone (SC-26304), spirorenone (ZK-35973), and mespirenone (ZK-94679).

===Synthesis===
Chemical syntheses of spironolactone and its analogues and derivatives have been described and reviewed.

==History==
The natriuretic effects of progesterone were demonstrated in 1955, and the development of spironolactone as a synthetic antimineralocorticoid analogue of progesterone shortly followed this. Spironolactone was first synthesized in 1957, was patented between 1958 and 1961, and was first marketed, as an antimineralocorticoid, in 1959. Gynecomastia was first reported with spironolactone in 1962, and the antiandrogenic activity of the medication was first described in 1969. This shortly followed the discovery in 1967 that gynecomastia is an important and major side effect of AR antagonists. Spironolactone was first studied in the treatment of hirsutism in women in 1978. It has since become the most widely used antiandrogen for dermatological indications in women in the United States. Spironolactone was first studied as an antiandrogen in transgender women in 1986, and has since become widely adopted for this purpose as well, particularly in the United States where cyproterone acetate is not available.

Early oral spironolactone tablets showed poor absorption. The formulation was eventually changed to a micronized formulation with particle sizes of less than 50 μg, which resulted in approximately 4-fold increased potency.

==Society and culture==

===Generic names===

The English, French, and generic name of the medication is spironolactone and this is its , , , , , and . Its name is in Latin, in German, in Spanish and Portuguese, and in Italian (which is also its ).

Spironolactone is also known by its developmental code names SC-9420 and NSC-150339.

===Brand names===
Spironolactone is marketed under various brand names throughout the world. The original brand name of spironolactone is Aldactone. Other brand names include Aldactone-A, Berlactone, CaroSpir, Espironolactona, Espironolactona Genfar, Novo-Spiroton, Prilactone (veterinary), Spiractin, Spiridon, Spirix, Spiroctan, Spiroderm (discontinued), Spirogamma, Spirohexal, Spirolon, Spirolone, Spiron, Spironolactone Actavis, Spironolactone Orion, Spironolactone Teva, Spirotone, Tempora (veterinary), Uractone, Uractonum, Verospiron, and Vivitar.

Spironolactone is also formulated in combination with a variety of other medications, including with hydrochlorothiazide as Aldactazide, with hydroflumethiazide as Aldactide, Lasilacton, Lasilactone, and Spiromide, with altizide as Aldactacine and Aldactazine, with furosemide as Fruselac, with benazepril as Cardalis (veterinary), with metolazone as Metolactone, with bendroflumethiazide as Sali-Aldopur, and with torasemide as Dytor Plus, Torlactone, and Zator Plus.

===Availability===
Spironolactone is marketed throughout the world.

==Research==

===Prostate conditions===
Spironolactone has been studied at a high dosage in the treatment of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH; enlarged prostate). It was found to be better than placebo in terms of symptom relief following three months of treatment. However, this was not maintained after six months of treatment, by which point the improvements had largely disappeared. Moreover, no difference was observed between spironolactone and placebo with regard to volume of residual urine or prostate size. Gynecomastia was observed in about 5% of people. On the basis of these results, it has been said that spironolactone has no place in the treatment of BPH.

Spironolactone has been studied and used limitedly in the treatment of prostate cancer.

===Epstein–Barr virus===
Spironolactone has been found to block Epstein–Barr virus (EBV) production and that of other human herpesviruses by inhibiting the function of an EBV protein SM, which is essential for infectious virus production. This effect of spironolactone was determined to be independent of its antimineralocorticoid actions.

===Other conditions===
Spironolactone has been studied in the treatment of rosacea in both males and females.

Spironolactone has been studied in fibromyalgia in women. It has also been studied in bulimia nervosa in women, but was not found to be effective.

<text>Sacred Hearts Academy, also known as Sacred Hearts or SHA, is located on 3253 Waialae Avenue, in the town of Kaimuki in Honolulu, Hawaii, is a historic Roman Catholic college preparatory school for girls founded in 1909 to serve the needs of early Hawaii Catholics in the former Territory of Hawaii. The school maintains a special relationship with Chaminade University of Honolulu and the all-boys Saint Louis School, both administered by the Society of Mary.

==History==
Sacred Hearts was originally founded by nuns from the Congregation of the Sacred Hearts of Jesus and Mary, the religious order of Father Damien. The precursor of the institution was founded as a boarding and day school next to the Cathedral Basilica of Our Lady of Peace in Honolulu in 1859.

The current manifestation was founded in 1909 as a boarding school, it grew rapidly within the next decade and, by the 1920s, more buildings were added to accommodate the students. The sisters ran the school until 1990, when it passed into lay administration.

==Filming location==
Sacred Hearts has served as a filming location for several television shows set and shot on location in Hawaii. The season 6 finale of the ABC series &quot;Lost&quot; was filmed there. In &quot;Hawaii Five-0&quot;, Sacred Hearts was used as Grace Williams&#x27; school.

<doc id="732672" wikidata="Q6936001" url="?curid=732672" title="Munged password">
<text>A munged password (pronounced ) refers to the practice of creating a password with common replacement strategies. For example, replacing &#x27;S&#x27; with &#x27;$&#x27; or &#x27;5&#x27; in a password. Alternatively, it can be seen as an application of Leet speak. It can lead to creation of secure passwords which are easy to remember, although they are still susceptible to brute-force guessing.

&quot;Munge&quot; is sometimes backronymmed as Modify Until Not Guessed Easily. The usage differs significantly from &quot;mung&quot; (Mash Until No Good), because &quot;munging&quot; implies destruction of data, while &quot;mungeing&quot; implies creation of strong protection for data.

==Rationale==
Passwords are used to gain access to computer resources, and computer users generally choose passwords that are easy to remember but therefore insecure. Simple passwords are easily hacked by dictionary attacking software, and so having a munged password could be useful as a protection against hackers.

If a network administrator supplies a password that is too difficult to remember, or requires that passwords be changed frequently, users tend to write their passwords down to help them remember. Passwords can often be found on sticky notes under keyboards, behind pictures, or hidden among other desktop items—another security risk.

Mungeing helps to create a strong password that the user can remember easily. The user may choose any word that they like and is then able to modify it to make it stronger.

==Implementation==

A strong password is often thought to require characters from at least three of the following four character sets (In addition to including characters from different sets, the password length is also a metric used to determine its strength.):

Adding a number and/or special character to a password might thwart some simple dictionary attacks. However, common words should still be avoided to the simplicity of automated brute force testing of well known munged variations of the words. For example, the password &quot;Butterfly&quot; could be munged in the following ways:

The substitutions can be anything the user finds easy to remember, and which may increase an attacker&#x27;s difficulties, such as:

For high-security applications, mungeing may not be very effective, because it only adds 23 bits of entropy, thus increasing the time needed to perform a brute force dictionary attack by a factor of 4–8. The increase in search space obtained by mungeing a few characters of a known word is easily matched by the continuous increase in processing power (which is more or less equivalent to &quot;cracking speed&quot;) computers have been experiencing for some decades as a result of Moore&#x27;s Law, although this can be countered for some applications by limiting password attempts to either one per few seconds or 5 per longer period of time, usually five minutes to one hour. 

As a rule of thumb, use of single well-known words, including after commonly used munged substitutions, should be avoided. Instead, combinations of multiple random words should be used, which can be remembered easily by forming a mental story from them.

<doc id="732678" wikidata="Q2447476" url="?curid=732678" title="Tracfort">
<text>Tracfort was a French automobile manufacturing venture that lasted from 1933 till late in 1934.

==Origins==
During the winter of 1933/34, Louis Carle founded &quot;Automobiles Tracfort&quot; at Courbevoie, by then a district in Paris. The car was developed by André Bournhonet who earlier had worked with a small Courbevoie based auto-maker called Derby.

Assembly took place at a manufacturing workshop, at Rue de Normandie 71 in Gennevilliers, ten minutes down the road from Courbevoie. The project involved producing front wheel drive cars under the Tracfort name, foreshadowing Citroën&#x27;s highly successful Traction avant model that appeared in 1934.

==The cars==
The Tracfort used the side valve 933 cc, 8 hp engine from the Ford Model Y but in order to support the front-wheel drive lay-out the engine was turned through 180 degrees so that the gearbox was at the front.

Two bodies were listed, both with two doors. These were a four seater 2-door &quot;coach&quot; (&quot;Mouette&quot;) bodied car with a fashionably fast-back tail and an open topped two seater &quot;roadster&quot; (&quot;Irlande&quot;). The inclusion of a Ford engine was reflected in the grill which also came from the Model Y.

Although the Ford transverse leaf springs were retained, the front suspension was made independent.

==Presentation==
The manufacturer took a stand at the 27th Paris Motor Show in October 1933, but disappeared a few weeks later following the bankruptcy of a firm called &quot;SABAB&quot; (&quot;Société anonyme des Brevets André Bournhonet&quot;), the patent holder whose support was necessary to ensure further production.

== Tracfort or Tracford? ==
Because the car used a Ford engine and (without its badge) a Ford grill, contemporaries and others sometimes inferred and then assumed that the name of the car was &quot;Tracford&quot;. The error gained a wider following among English speaking readers once it found its way into several successive editions of the excellent, comprehensive and widely respected &quot;Complete Encyclopaedia of Motorcars&quot; by Nick Georgano.

Nevertheless, publicity material of the time and other sources, including those originated by mother-tongue French speakers, and including even the most recent version of Georgano&#x27;s own compilation, indicate that &quot;Tracfort&quot; is the correct spelling for this car&#x27;s name.

<text>Pierre de Rigaud de Vaudreuil de Cavagnial, marquis de Vaudreuil (; 22 November 1698 – 4 August 1778) was a Canadian-born colonial governor of French Canada in North America. He was governor of French Louisiana (1743–1753) and in 1755 became the last Governor-General of New France. In 1759 and 1760 the British conquered the colony in the Seven Years&#x27; War (known in the United States as the French and Indian War).

==Life and work==

He was born to the Governor-General of New France, Philippe de Rigaud Vaudreuil and his wife, Louise-Élisabeth, the daughter of Pierre de Joybert de Soulanges et de Marson, in Quebec. He was the uncle of Louis-Philippe de Vaudreuil.

Commissioned an officer of the French army while still a youth, in 1733 he was appointed governor of Trois-Rivières, and in 1742 of French Louisiana, serving there from to May 10, 1743 to February 9, 1753 and proving himself a skilled officer and capable administrator. While governor of Louisiana, he married Jeanne-Charlotte de Fleury Deschambault, a widow about 15 years his elder.

He moved to France in 1753 before being appointed by King Louis XV as governor of New France in 1755.

Although Vaudreuil held supreme civil authority in Canada and was technically commander-in-chief of all French forces there, he clashed often with Montcalm, the military commander in the field, who resented his oversight role. The two men grew to detest one another, much to the detriment of the French war effort. 

After Montcalm lost to the British forces under Maj. Gen. James Wolfe at Quebec City in the Battle of the Plains of Abraham, Vaudreuil tried to rally resistance to the British but to no avail. He was forced to surrender Montreal on 8 September 1760 to Maj. Gen. Jeffrey Amherst.

One of several scapegoats for France&#x27;s losses in the New World, Vaudreuil was imprisoned in the Bastille on March 30, 1762 but was released on May 18. He was joined by Bigot, Cadet, Pean, Breard, Varin, Le Mercier, Penisseault, Maurin, Copron, and others. Of the 21 men brought to trial, 10 were condemned, six were acquitted, three received an admonition and two were dismissed for want of evidence. Absent were 34, of whom seven were sentenced in default, and judgement was reserved in the case of the rest. Exonerated in a military tribunal held in December 1763, he was awarded a pension and military decoration.

After selling his Canadian seigneuries at Vaudreuil and Rigaud to his cousin, Michel Chartier de Lotbinière, Marquis de Lotbinière, he retired to his ancestral estate near Rouen, although the episode ruined his fortunes. He died in Paris on 4 August 1778.

His nephew Louis-Philippe de Vaudreuil was the second in command of the French naval units supporting the Americans during the American Revolution. He was present at the defeat of the British fleet by the French at the pivotal Battle of the Chesapeake during the siege of Yorktown in 1781, although he was later defeated by the Royal Navy at the Battle of the Saintes.

Vaudreuil was one of three governors-general of Canada known to have owned enslaved people. During his tenure, he owned 16 people, 13 of whom were Africans.

<doc id="732683" wikidata="Q991188" url="?curid=732683" title="Browning Arms Company">
<text>Browning Arms Company (originally John Moses and Matthew Sandefur Browning Company) is an American marketer of firearms and fishing gear. The company was founded in Ogden, Utah, in 1878 by brothers John Moses Browning (1855–1926) and Matthew Sandefur Browning (1859–1923). The company offers a wide variety of firearms, including shotguns, rifles, and pistols. Other products include fishing rods and reels, gun safes, sport bows, knives and bicycles.

Initially, the company marketed the sporting (non-military) designs of John Browning, one of the world&#x27;s most influential and prolific firearms inventors. Nearly all of John Browning&#x27;s innovative designs have been manufactured under license by other companies, including Winchester, Colt, Remington, FN Herstal, and Miroku. Browning is currently a wholly owned subsidiary of FN Herstal.

Browning Arms Company is best known for the A-Bolt and X-Bolt bolt-action rifles, the BAR semi-automatic rifle, the BPR pump-action rifle, the BPS pump-action shotgun, the Auto-5 semi-automatic shotgun, and the Hi-Power pistol. Browning also manufactures a set of trap shotguns such as the 725 Pro Trap, Citori CX series, and the Cynergy series.

==Archives==
The company&#x27;s factory collection is owned by the Browning Firearms Museum at Union Station in Ogden, Utah.

===Footwear=== 
Browning introduced a line of hunting boots in 1968 and continued to design and manufacture footwear through outside vendors until 2001. In that year, Browning reached a license agreement with Connecticut-based H.H. Brown Shoe Company, a subsidiary of Berkshire Hathaway, to manufacture Browning Footwear.

The product line included the John M. Browning collection, Field and Game series, and sporting and waterfowl lines. The line has grown to include kangaroo leather boots, rubber boots and waders, and upland game boots.

===Knives===
In 1968, Browning introduced a line of cutlery in the form of three fixed-blade hunting knives and a folding knife designed by the custom knifemaker Gil Hibben. Over the years, the lineup has grown, and Browning has teamed up with other knifemakers such as Jerry Fisk, Bailey Bradshaw, John Fitch, Joseph Keeslar, and James Crowell of the American Bladesmith Society. In 2004 Browning partnered with several custom knifemakers to produce a series of &quot;Living History Knives&quot; honoring famous American generals and battles. The lineup included a Liberty Tree Knife made by Larry Harley; a Robert E. Lee Knife and an Alamo Knife honoring Jim Bowie designed by Jerry Fisk; an Ike Knife honoring Dwight David Eisenhower designed by Jim Crowell; and a Crazy Horse Knife by Brent Evans. Browning has recently partnered with big-game hunter, Russ Kommer as their knife designer.

==In popular culture==
Browning was the make of pistol initially depicted in the Nazi propaganda play &quot;Schlageter&quot;, from which the quote &quot;when I hear the word culture, I reach for my gun&quot;, often associated with Nazi leaders, originates. The actual line from the play is slightly different: &quot;Wenn ich Kultur höre ... entsichere ich meinen Browning!&quot; &quot;Whenever I hear of culture... I unlock my Browning!&quot; (Act 1, Scene 1).

Browning is the sponsor of the hunting show &quot;Goin&#x27; Country&quot; hosted by Kristy Lee Cook, which the Versus channel aired before it became the NBC Sports Network. The relationship between Cook and Browning started after she wore a Browning hat on &quot;American Idol&quot;.

A Browning shotgun appears in the Turnpike Troubadours song &quot;The Housefire&quot; and &quot;The Bird Hunters&quot;. The latter specifies that the gun was manufactured in Belgium.

<text>Terem Palace or Teremnoy Palace () is a historical building in the Moscow Kremlin, Russia, which used to be the main residence of the Russian czars in the 17th century. Its name is derived from the Greek word &quot;τέρεμνον&quot; (i.e., &quot;dwelling&quot;). Currently, the structure is not accessible to the public, as it belongs to the official residence of the President of Russia.

In the 16th century, Aloisio da Milano constructed the first royal palace on the spot. Only the ground floor from that structure survives, as the first Romanov tsar, Mikhail Feodorovich, had the palace completely rebuilt in 1635–1636. The new structure was surrounded by numerous annexes and outbuildings, including the Boyar Platform, Golden Staircase, Golden Porch, and several turrets. On Mikhail&#x27;s behest, the adjoining Golden Tsaritsa&#x27;s Chamber constructed back in the 1560s for Ivan IV&#x27;s wife, was surmounted with 11 golden domes of the Upper Saviour Cathedral. The complex of the palace also incorporates several churches of earlier construction, including the Church of the Virgin&#x27;s Nativity from the 1360s.

The palace consists of five stories. The third story was occupied by the czarina and her children; the fourth one contained the private apartments of the czar. The upper story is a tent-like structure where the Boyar Duma convened. The exterior, exuberantly decorated with brick tracery and colored tiles, is brilliantly painted in red, yellow, and orange. The interior used to be painted as well, but the original murals were destroyed by successive fires, particularly the great fire of 1812. In 1837, the interiors were renovated in accordance with old drawings in the Russian Revival style.

<text>The Interscholastic League of Honolulu (ILH) is an athletic activity league whose membership is primarily private secondary schools in Honolulu, Hawai&#x27;i. The ILH has 24 member schools with over 13,000 student athletes participating in 37 different sports including cross country, track and field, swimming and diving, football, baseball, basketball, soccer, canoe paddling, kayaking, air riflery, water polo, judo, cheerleading, and sailing.

==History==
The ILH was founded in 1909 with Punahou, Kamehameha and McKinley High School making up the original membership. A number of public and private institutions joined soon after to bolster membership. In 1911 the ILH passed a rule stating that all players must be students, after schools supplemented their teams with recent graduates.

Along with the large number of private institutions that composed the membership of the ILH, there were five public high schools situated in Honolulu that were original members of the league: Farrington High School, Kaimuki High School, McKinley High School, Roosevelt High School and Kalani High School. In 1970, these five schools left the ILH to join the Oahu Interscholastic Association, a league now comprising all the public secondary schools on the island, leaving the ILH membership composed primarily with private institutions.

==Operations==
The Interscholastic League of Honolulu is governed by a set of policies that cover aspects such as: eligibility of students, age limits, academic standing, sports participation, outside participation rules and a codified transfer policy between teams.

As a large number of schools in the ILH have very small enrollment numbers, many schools cannot field teams that require a large number of players such as football, baseball, wrestling, etc. In response to this problem, and to give their students a chance to compete in these sports, these schools pool their players together and play under the moniker &quot;Pac-Five&quot;. Pac-Five participates in many of the various sports offered by the ILH. Unfortunately for this combined athletic program, the athletes are not allowed to participate and score as a team in state championship individual sports. In this case, the athletes from each school must compete under their own school name, making it extremely difficult to win team awards due to the failure to meet the minimum number of athletes participating in an event in order to achieve a high team score.

==League events==
Tournaments hosted by the Interscholastic League of Honolulu have always been some of the most popular events in the State of Hawaii. Events such as the old Thanksgiving Day football game would annually draw crowds upwards of 20,000 to Honolulu Stadium to watch the league crown its champion. Although the Turkey Day Game has long been defunct, avid fans still often commute from neighbor islands to O&#x27;ahu to attend conference games in a wide range of sports.

<doc id="732692" wikidata="Q284719" url="?curid=732692" title="Basilica Palladiana">
<text>The Basilica Palladiana is a Renaissance building in the central Piazza dei Signori in Vicenza, north-eastern Italy. The most notable feature of the edifice is the loggia, which shows one of the first examples of what have come to be known as the Palladian window, designed by a young Andrea Palladio, whose work in architecture was to have a significant effect on the field during the Renaissance and later periods.

Since 1994, the Basilica Palladiana, together with other Palladian buildings in and around Vicenza, has been part of the UNESCO World Heritage Site &quot;City of Vicenza and the Palladian Villas of the Veneto&quot;.

==History==
The building was originally constructed in the 15th century and was known as the Palazzo della Ragione, having been designed by Domenico da Venezia to include two pre-existing public palazzi. The building, which was in the Gothic style, served as the seat of government and also housed a number of shops on the ground floor. The -tall Torre Bissara precedes this structure, as it is known from as early as 1172; however, its height was increased on this occasion, and its pinnacle was finished in 1444. It has five bells in the chord of E. The 15th-century edifice had an upside-down cover, partly supported by large archivolts, inspired by the one built in 1306 for the eponymous building of Padua. The Gothic façade was in red and &quot;gialletto&quot; marble of Verona, and is still visible behind the Palladio addition.

A double order of columns was built by Tommaso Formenton in 1481–1494 to surround the palace. However, two years after its completion, the south-western corner collapsed. In the following decades, the Vicentine government called in architects such as Antonio Rizzo, Giorgio Spavento, Antonio Scarpagnino, Jacopo Sansovino, Sebastiano Serlio, Michele Sanmicheli and Giulio Romano to propose a reconstruction plan. In 1546, the Council of One Hundred chose a 40-year-old local architect, Andrea Palladio, to reconstruct the building starting from April 1549. Palladio added a new outer shell of marble classical forms, a loggia and a portico that now obscure the original Gothic architecture. He also dubbed the building a &quot;basilica&quot;, after the ancient Roman civil structures of that name.

The Basilica was an expensive project (some 60,000 ducats once finished) and took a long time to complete. Palladio received for the work an income of five ducats a month for most of his life. In 1614—thirty years after his death—the building was completed, with the finishing of the main façade on Piazza delle Erbe.

==Description==

Drawings by Palladio, from his original proposal of 1546 to the final construction, have been preserved. His solution, which also encompasses the necessary measure to adapt the addition to the pre-existing structure, is based on the so-called serliana: this is a repetitive structure in which round arches are flanked by rectangular openings; the latter were of different size, in order to match the variable size of the internal bay. In the angular arcades, the architrave openings become very narrow. The serliana had been already used in the Veneto some years before by Jacopo Sansovino for his Biblioteca Marciana (1537), as well as in the reconstruction of the Polirone Abbey by Giulio Romano (1540).

The loggias in the lower floor were in the Doric order; the associated entablature has a frieze which alternates metope (decorated by dishes and bucrania) and triglyphs. The upper-floor loggias, by contrast, are in the Ionic order, with a continuous frieze entablature.

The parapet has statues by Giovanni Battista Albanese, Grazioli and Lorenzo Rubini. The clocktower has five bells in the chord of E major.

==Conservation==
Since 1994 the Basilica has been protected as part of the World Heritage Site also including the other Palladian buildings of Vicenza. The building now often hosts exhibitions in its large hall used for civic events.

== Restoration ==
A large restoration project started in 2007. In 2014 it won the European Union Prize for Cultural Heritage / Europa Nostra Award.

<doc id="732701" wikidata="Q748910" url="?curid=732701" title="Dormition Cathedral, Moscow">
<text>The Cathedral of the Dormition (), also known as the Assumption Cathedral or Cathedral of the Assumption, is a Russian Orthodox church dedicated to the Dormition of the Theotokos. It is located on the north side of Cathedral Square of the Moscow Kremlin in Russia, where a narrow alley separates the north from the Patriarch&#x27;s Palace with the Twelve Apostles Church. Separately in the southwest, also separated by a narrow passage from the church, stands the Palace of Facets. The cathedral is regarded as the mother church of Muscovite Russia.

The cathedral was originally constructed using stone in 1326 under Ivan I. The cathedral was rebuilt between 1475 and 1479 at the behest of the grand prince Ivan III to a design by the Italian architect Aristotele Fioravanti. From 1547 to 1896 the coronation of Russian monarchs took place here. In addition, the cathedral is the burial place for most of the Moscow Metropolitans and Patriarchs of the Russian Orthodox Church; it also serves as a part of Moscow Kremlin Museums.

==History==
===Early history===
Archaeological investigations in 1968 indicated that the site of the present cathedral was a medieval burial ground, supporting the hypothesis that a wooden church existed on the site in the 12th century. This was replaced by a limestone structure built around 1326, which has been mentioned in historical records.

In the 14th century, Metropolitan Peter persuaded Ivan I (Ivan Kalita) that he should build a cathedral to the Theotokos (Blessed Virgin Mary) in Moscow like the Cathedral of the Dormition in the capital city Vladimir. Construction of the cathedral began on August 4, 1326, and the cathedral was finished and consecrated on August 4, 1327. At that time Moscow became the capital of the Vladimir-Suzdal principality.


By the end of the 15th century the old cathedral had become dilapidated, and in 1472 the Moscow architects Kryvtsov and Myshkin began construction of a new cathedral. Two years later, in May 1474, the building was nearing completion when it collapsed due to earthquake.

===Present structure===
Following the disaster, Ivan III then invited Aristotele Fioravanti, a celebrated architect and engineer from Bologna, Italy, to come to Moscow and entrusted him with the task of designing the cathedral from scratch in the traditions of Russian architecture. The Assumption Cathedral in Vladimir was once again taken as a model for the building, and so Fioravanti travelled to Vladimir in order to study Russian methods of building. He designed a light and spacious masterpiece that combined the spirit of the Renaissance with Russian traditions. The foundation for the new cathedral was laid in 1475, and in 1479 the new cathedral was consecrated by Metropolitan Geronty. The interior was painted with frescoes and adorned with many icons, including the Theotokos of Vladimir and Blachernitissa.

The design of the new church, with its five domes (symbolic of Jesus Christ and the Four Evangelists) proved immensely popular, and was taken as a template for numerous other churches throughout Russia.

In 1547, the coronation of the first Russian Tsar, Ivan the Terrible, took place in this cathedral. From 1721 it was the scene of the coronation of the Russian emperors. The ritual installation of metropolitans and patriarchs of the Russian Orthodox Church also took place in this cathedral, and their tombs are to be found here.

The cathedral suffered from many disasters in its history, including fires in 1518, 1547, 1682, and 1737, and looting under the armies of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth during the Time of Troubles in 1612. During the French occupation of Russia, it was looted and used as a horse stable.

It was thoroughly restored in 1894-1895 and from 1910 to 1918. On November 21, 1917, the cathedral was the setting for the installation of Tikhon (Bellavin), the Metropolitan of Moscow, as the first patriarch of the restored Patriarchate of Moscow. However, following the 1917 Russian Revolution, the new Bolshevik government closed all churches in the Moscow Kremlin, and converted the cathedral into a museum. By special permission from Vladimir Lenin, the last Pascha (Easter service) was held in 1918. The final moment of this Paschal service was the subject of an unfinished painting by Pavel Korin entitled &quot;Farewell to Rus&quot;. Most of the church treasures were transferred to the Kremlin Armory, or were sold overseas.

The building was repaired in 1949/50, 1960 and 1978.

In 1990, the Dormition Cathedral was returned to the church for periodic religious services, shortly before the dissolution of the Soviet Union. It was restored to the Russian Orthodox Church in 1991.

==Architecture==

Dormition Cathedral is a tremendous six-pillared building with five apses and five domes. It was modeled after the Assumption Cathedral in Vladimir, in that it made extensive use of limestone masonry on a high limestone base, and was laid out as a three nave church with a vaulted cross-dome. It is built of well-trimmed white-stone blocks. However, Fioravanti did not use cantilever vaults as was common in Russian architecture, but introduced groin vaults and transverse arches. For the upper portion of the building, he used specially-made bricks, larger than the standard Russian size, which reduced weight and allowed for more slender arch supports. Thus, the easternmost pair of columns in front of the apses are typically Russian in the use of massive rectangular open piers, whereas the remaining four are simpler Corinthian columns. The slim shape of these columns contributes significantly to the light, spacious effect of the interior.

Inside, the church decoration is dominated by its fresco painting. The huge iconostasis dates from 1547, but its two highest tiers are later additions from 1626 and 1653/1654 under Patriarch Nikon. In addition to its liturgical function, the iconostasis also served as a sort of trophy wall, in that Russian Tsars would add the most important icons from cities they had conquered to their collection. One of the oldest, &quot;icons with the bust of Saint George&quot; dates from the 12th century and was transferred to Moscow by Tsar Ivan IV on the conquest of the city of Veliky Novgorod in 1561.

However, one of the most important icons of the Russian Orthodox Church, the &quot;Theotokos of Vladimir&quot; kept at the cathedral from 1395 to 1919 is now at the Tretyakov Gallery.

Near the south entrance to the cathedral is the Monomach Throne of Ivan IV (1551).

==In the arts==
The plaza in front of the cathedral is the setting for the famous Coronation Scene in Mussorgsky&#x27;s opera &quot;Boris Godunov&quot;.

<text>The  (&quot;Olympic Theatre&quot;) is a theatre in Vicenza, northern Italy, constructed in 1580–1585. It was the final design by the Italian Renaissance architect Andrea Palladio and was not completed until after his death. The &quot;trompe-l&#x27;œil&quot; onstage scenery, designed by Vincenzo Scamozzi to give the appearance of long streets receding to a distant horizon, was installed in 1585 for the first performance held in the theatre, and is the oldest surviving stage set still in existence. The full Roman-style &quot;scaenae frons&quot; back screen across the stage is made from wood and stucco imitating marble. It was the home of the Accademia Olimpica, which was founded there in 1555.

The is, along with the Teatro all&#x27;antica in Sabbioneta and the Teatro Farnese in Parma, one of only three Renaissance theatres remaining in existence. Both these theatres were based, in large measure, on the . It is still used several times a year.

Since 1994 the , together with other Palladian buildings in and around Vicenza, has been part of the UNESCO World Heritage Site &quot;City of Vicenza and the Palladian Villas of the Veneto&quot;.

==Design and construction==

===Palladio&#x27;s vision===
The is the last work by Palladio, and ranks amongst his highest masterworks. The Vicentine architect had returned to his native city in 1579, bringing with him a lifetime of detailed study into all aspects of ancient Roman architecture, and a more detailed understanding of the architecture of classical theatre than any other living person. Palladio had illustrated Daniele Barbaro&#x27;s Italian translation of Vitruvius&#x27; ; the prints for this edition include floor plans for Roman theatres and an elevation for the &quot;scaenae frons&quot; of Vicenza&#x27;s ruined Roman theatre, the Teatro Berga. As well, Palladio&#x27;s papers include plans for the imagined reconstruction of the ruined Roman theatres in Pola and Verona.

Palladio, a founder of the Olympic Academy (the &quot;Accademia Olimpica&quot;, created in 1555), had already designed temporary theatre structures at various locations in the city. The most notable of these had been erected some seventeen years previously in the great hall of the Basilica Palladiana.

In 1579, the academy obtained the rights to build a permanent theatre in an old fortress, the &quot;Castello del Territorio,&quot; which had been turned into a prison and powder magazine before falling into disuse. Palladio was asked to produce a design, and despite the awkward shape of the old fortress, he decided to use the space to recreate an academic reconstruction of the Roman theatres that he had so closely studied. In order to fit a stage and seating area into the wide, shallow space, it was necessary for Palladio to flatten the semicircular seating area of the Roman theatre into an ellipse.

===Scamozzi takes over===

Palladio died in August 1580, only six months after construction had started on the theatre. Still, construction continued with Palladio&#x27;s sketches and drawings serving as a guide, and Palladio&#x27;s son, Silla, taking charge of the project. Soon, the other prominent Vicentine architect, Vincenzo Scamozzi, was called upon to complete the project.

Scamozzi had already stepped in to complete Palladio&#x27;s other great unfinished project, the villa just east of Vicenza that is today known as Villa Capra &quot;La Rotonda&quot;. It is a mark of Scamozzi&#x27;s genius that both these projects are today regarded as being among Palladio&#x27;s most successfully executed works.

Scamozzi&#x27;s contributions include the &quot;Odèo&quot; and &quot;Antiodèo&quot; rooms, as well as the entrance archway which leads from the street, through an old medieval wall into the courtyard of the old fortress.

In order to make the archway fit with its surroundings, and to prepare visitors to the theatre for the transformation from medieval to classical surroundings, Scamozzi built the archway to be the same size and shape as the &quot;porta regia&quot; or triumphal arch at the center of the &quot;scaenae frons&quot; or rear wall of the stage. However, the entrance archway was rusticated to make it fit with the rough and well-worn wall into which it was being inserted.

However, Scamozzi&#x27;s most famous and most original contribution to the theatre was his elaborate stage set, with its remarkable &quot;trompe-l&#x27;œil&quot; street views. He not only designed the sets, but also put considerable effort into designing the lighting that permitted the make-believe houses of the stage scenery to be lit from within, completing the illusion that these were real streets.

===Design and construction of the scenery===

Aside from a single sketch of the &quot;scaenae frons&quot;, Palladio left no plans as to what kind of scenery should be used onstage. His illustration of an idealized Roman &quot;scaenae frons&quot; for Barbaro&#x27;s commentary on the writings of Vitruvius had shown perspective street views similar to those which would later be built in the , but the sketch of the proposed &quot;scaenae frons&quot; for the shows no such street scenes. The space behind the central archway and the doors to each side is blank.
The simplest explanation for the absence of any street scenes in this drawing is that the academy had not yet obtained the land on which the scenery would later be built. This land was acquired in 1582, after Scamozzi had taken charge of the project. This made it possible to extend the building (including a special apse-shaped projection to accommodate the longest and most elaborate of the seven street views). The academy&#x27;s petition to the city government for the additional land anticipated that if acquired, the space would be used to create perspective scenery; it explains that the extra land would be used to build a theatre &quot;along the lines laid out by our colleague Palladio, who has designed it to permit perspective views.&quot;

Therefore, Palladio can be given credit for having inspired the remarkable perspectives which are visible to the audience through the central archway of the &quot;scaenae frons&quot; (also known as the &quot;porta regia&quot;) and also through the smaller side openings, but it is also appropriate to regard Scamozzi as the technical genius behind their remarkably successful execution.

Scamozzi&#x27;s stage set was the first practical introduction of perspective views into Renaissance theatre. The scenery consists of seven hallways decorated to create the illusion of looking down the streets of a city from classical antiquity. Ancient Thebes, was to be the setting for the first play staged in the theatre. A set of seven extraordinarily realistic &quot;trompe-l&#x27;œil&quot; false perspectives provide the illusion of long street views, while actually the sets recede only a few meters. The way in which seats in all parts of the theatre were provided with at least one perspective view can be seen by observing the theatre floor plan and following the sight lines of audience members in different parts of the theatre.

==History==
The theatre was inaugurated on 3 March 1585 with a production of Sophocles&#x27; &quot;Oedipus Rex&quot;, with music by Andrea Gabrielli. However, the theatre was virtually abandoned after only a few productions. The scenes, which had been created in wood and stucco for &quot;Oedipus Rex&quot;, and which were meant to represent the streets of Thebes, were never removed: despite bombings and other vicissitudes, they have miraculously preserved into modern times. The original lighting system of glass oil lamps, designed by Scamozzi, heightened the illusion of space, has been used only a few times because of the high cost and the risk of fire. Scamozzi&#x27;s lighting system was used when, in 1997, the theatre was again employed for a production of &quot;Oedipus Rex&quot;.

The is still used for plays and musical performances, but audience sizes are limited to 400, for conservation reasons. Performances take place in two theatre seasons:classical plays in the autumn and the festival &quot;Il Suono dell&#x27;Olimpico&quot; in the spring. It is not equipped with heating or air conditioning, which could damage the delicate wooden structures.

The Theatre has been used as a filming location for films such as &quot;Don Giovanni&quot; (1979) and &quot;Casanova&quot; (2005).

The hosts the awards ceremony of Dedalo Minosse International Prize for commissioning a building.

Vicenza American High School, a military base located on Caserma Ederle in Vicenza, on occasions used the theater for commencement exercises for the graduating classes for a number of years, including, but not limited to the late 1970s and early 1980s. However, as class sizes significantly increased, they have stopped using the theater for graduation ceremonies.

==Precursors==
Some authors have incorrectly stated that when the was constructed in 1580–85, it was the first purpose-built theatre in Europe in over a thousand years. In reality, the theatre was one of a number of new permanent theatres being constructed at the time. Records show that permanent theatres were constructed in Ferrara (1531), Rome (1545), Mantua (1549), Bologna (1550), Siena (1561), and Venice (1565). This last theatre was designed by Palladio himself, for the Compagnia della Calza.

==Influence==
Over the centuries, the has had many admirers, but relatively few imitators. One critic has observed: &quot;In the history of theatre design, the was a temporary hiatus, for succeeding generations adopted the proscenium arch and painterly stage sets. Palladio&#x27;s ideas are closer to the spirit of the modern theatre, which favors the relationship of audience to action.&quot; Another notes: &quot;The rigid form of the scenic arrangements of the [...] precluded any further development,&quot; and that the theatre was, in a sense, a prisoner of its creators&#x27; emphasis on &quot;considerations of archaeology&quot; and truthfulness to the Roman model. The successful completion of Palladio&#x27;s experiment in reconstructing the ancient model meant that there was no longer any need to pursue the objective of recovering the Roman past; it was now possible to start making innovations, starting with eliminating the rigid and unchangeable scaenae frons and the unchanging perspective views.

The first theatre to draw inspiration from the , and the one in which its influence is the most obvious, is the Teatro all&#x27;antica in Sabbioneta. This theatre, which was designed by Vincenzo Scamozzi, is sometimes also referred to, somewhat confusingly, as the &quot;&quot;, and some of its design elements, including most notably the colonnade behind the seating area and the self-conscious references to ancient Rome, are clearly drawn from the original . However, the elaborate &quot;scaenae frons&quot; is absent in Sabbioneta, and only a single perspective view, along a single street, is employed onstage. As well, the seating area departs radically from Palladio&#x27;s elliptical plan (perhaps as a result of the much narrower shape of the building in which the theatre is housed).

The English architect Inigo Jones visited the shortly after its completion, and took careful notes, in which he expressed particular admiration for the perspective views: &quot;[T]he chief artifice was that whear so ever you sat you saw one of thes Prospects...&quot;

<text>Alexander Dmitrievich Schmemann (; 13 September 1921 – 13 December 1983) was an influential Orthodox priest, theologian, and author who spent most of his career in the United States.

Born in Estonia to émigrés from the Russian Revolution, he grew up primarily in France, where there was a large émigré community in Paris. After being educated there in both Russian and French schools and universities, from 1946 to 1951 he taught in Paris. That year he immigrated with his family to New York City to teach at Saint Vladimir&#x27;s Orthodox Theological Seminary. In 1962 he was selected as dean of the Seminary, serving in this position until his death. For 30 years, his sermons in Russian were broadcast by Radio Liberty into the Soviet Union, where they were influential as a voice from beyond the Iron Curtain.

Schmemann was among the leaders in forming the Orthodox Church in America as an autocephalous institution, which status it gained from the Russian Orthodox Church in 1970. While identifying strongly as Russian, Schmemann sought to make the OCA independent of any ethnic or national group, and open to all peoples. He believed the Orthodox Church had a mission to the West. In his teachings and writings, he explored the many ways that Christian liturgy was an expression of Christian theology.

==Early life and studies==
Alexander Schmemann was born as one of twin boys in 1921 in Tallinn, Estonia, into a family of Russian émigrés from St. Petersburg. His twin brother was named . Their grandfather Nikolai Schmemann had been a Lutheran of Baltic German ancestry, who served as a senator and a member of the State Council in St. Petersburg, along with numerous other foreigners. After Schmemann married a Russian Orthodox woman, their children were raised in that tradition, as required by the state. His father Dmitry was studying law when interrupted by the First World War. He served as an officer of the Imperial Life-Guards, also in St. Petersburg. After the Revolution broke out, Schmemann fought with the Life-Guards and other anti-Bolshevik forces, but they were ultimately pushed into Estonia, where they disbanded.

When Schmemann was a child, his family moved to Paris, France, where, like most children of the large émigré community, he was first educated in Russian-language schools. There were tens of thousands of Russians in Paris, generally gathered in St. Petersburg and Moscow-affiliated communities. But Schmemann also chose to go to a French lycée. During this period, he served as an altar boy and subdeacon at Saint Alexander Nevsky Cathedral, participating in the liturgy and building his life in the church. In college, he studied the Orthodox church and Christian history related to the Byzantine and Roman churches more deeply. At the University of Paris (1940–1945), he wrote a thesis on theocracy and the Eastern Roman Empire. He began graduate studies at St. Sergius Orthodox Theological Institute, also in Paris.

In 1943 Schmemann married Juliana Osorguine (also spelled as Osorgina) (1923–2017), whose family after the Revolution had been expelled from their estate, which included the village of Sergiyevskoye (now Koltsovo) south of Moscow. Her family were also émigrés in Paris, where Russians gathered in St. Petersburg and Moscow-related communities. The Osorguines attended a small Russian Orthodox Church in Clamart near Paris, known as Saints Constantine and Helen Church. After their marriage, Schmemann completed his five-year program of theological studies in 1945 at the St. Sergius Institute. He studied with the noted Russian theologian, Archpriest Sergei Bulgakov, among others. He also was influenced by major thinkers involved in the theological revival of French Roman Catholicism, such as Jean Daniélou, Louis Bouyer, and several others.

The couple had three children together in France: a daughter born in 1944, a son Serge Schmemann born in 1945, and another daughter, born in 1948. All grew up speaking and identifying as Russian, although they also drew from French and American cultures. They moved to the United States in 1951. Serge Schmemann later became a journalist. His assignments included working for the Associated Press (AP) and &quot;The New York Times&quot; in the Soviet Union and, after the dissolution, in Russia for several years.

==Career==
On 22 October 1946 Schmemann was ordained to the presbyterate of the Orthodox Church by Vladimir (Tikhonicky). From 1946–51 he taught church history at St. Sergius Institute in Paris. After moving to the United States (see below), he completed his doctorate at St. Sergius Institute in 1959, with Fr. Nicholas Anassieff and Fr. John Meyendorff acting as examiners.

Schmemann was invited by Father Georges Florovsky, who had briefly taught in Paris after being rescued in 1947 from Soviet-dominated Czechoslovakia, to join the faculty of Saint Vladimir&#x27;s Orthodox Theological Seminary, which had been established in 1938 in New York City. He and his family immigrated to the United States in 1951. This postwar period was one of considerable immigration of Russian émigrés to the US. Many settled in and around New York, including in towns on Long Island, such as Sea Cliff, Glen Cove and Oyster Bay.

When the seminary moved to its present campus in Crestwood, New York in 1962, Father Alexander was selected for the post of dean, which he would hold until his death. He also served as adjunct professor at Columbia University, New York University, Union Theological Seminary and General Theological Seminary in New York, extending the connections of the Orthodox Church in America. Much of his focus at St Vladimir&#x27;s was on liturgical theology, which emphasizes the liturgical tradition of the Church as a major sign and expression of the Christian faith.

He was invited as an Orthodox observer to the Second Vatican Council of the Catholic Church, held from 1962 to 1965.

Teaching generations of future clergy at St. Vladimir&#x27;s, Schmemann was active in the establishment of the Orthodox Church in America. From beginnings related to colonial Russian missionaries in Alaska, it had expanded through the 20th century to incorporate new immigrant Orthodox populations from Greece and southeastern Europe. By the mid-20th century, it was known as the Russian Orthodox Greek Catholic Orthodox Church, reflecting these congregations. In 1970 the OCA was granted autocephaly by the Russian Orthodox Church. The Churches of Constantinople, Antioch and most of the remaining Orthodox churches remained in communion with the OCA, but did not recognize it as autocephalous, saying it was not a unified church.

Since 1970 the OCA has become largely an American church: Metropolitan Theodosius was the first American-born primate of the church, serving from 1974 to his retirement in 2002. By that time, the church had 900,000 members in 725 parishes, and in many churches, the services are in English. The original Metropolia had ten dioceses, and there were also dioceses for Bulgarian, Romanian, and Albanian congregations. There are also several parishes in Mexico, organized as what is known as the Exarchate of Mexico.

Thousands of Schmemann&#x27;s Russian-language sermons were broadcast into the Soviet Union on &quot;Radio Liberty&quot; over a period of 30 years. He gained a broad following of listeners across the Soviet Union, although the government tried to block these broadcasts. Among them was the writer Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn; the two men became friends after Solzhenitsyn immigrated to the West.

At the time of his death, Schmemann was the dean of the Saint Vladimir&#x27;s Orthodox Theological Seminary, a position he had held since 1962. Schmemann died of cancer in 1983 in Crestwood, New York, where the seminary was located in Westchester County just north of the city.

==Works==
Fr Schmemann published many books and articles, some directed at general readers. &quot;For the Life of the World&quot;, a popular volume on Christian faith as reflected in liturgy, has been translated into eleven languages. Originally prepared as study guide for the National Student Christian Federation in 1963, it was published anonymously by the underground &quot;samizdat&quot; in the Soviet Union.

&quot;The Eucharist&quot; was finished just before Schmemann&#x27;s death. This and several collections of his writings were published posthumously.

* &quot;Introduction to Liturgical Theology&quot; (1961)
* &quot;The Historical Road of Eastern Orthodoxy&quot; (1963)

==Legacy==
Fr Schmemann was accorded the title of &quot;protopresbyter&quot;, the highest honor that can be bestowed on a married Orthodox priest. He was awarded honorary degrees from Butler University, General Theological Seminary, Lafayette College, Iona College, and Holy Cross Greek Orthodox School of Theology.

Schmemann&#x27;s work, including entire courses on his theology, are taught at theology schools. In 2018 the Metropolitan Andrey Sheptytsky Institute of Eastern Christian Studies at St. Michael&#x27;s College in Toronto offered a course &quot;The Liturgical Theology of Alexander Schmemann (1921-1983)&quot;.

In 1984, soon after his death, CBS network produced a documentary about him and his work, &quot;The Spirit of St. Vladimir&#x27;s.&quot;

His books are available for free on Internet Archive and Project Gutenberg.

<doc id="732715" wikidata="Q7783618" url="?curid=732715" title="They'll Do It Every Time">
<text>They&#x27;ll Do It Every Time is a single-panel newspaper comic strip, created by Jimmy Hatlo, which had a long run over eight decades, first appearing on February 5, 1929, and continuing until February 3, 2008. The title of the strip became a popular catchphrase. 

== Publication history ==
Hatlo, a sports cartoonist, created the panel to fill space on the comics page of the &quot;San Francisco Call-Bulletin&quot;. Hatlo kept producing the panel, and before long readers were sending fan mail. The feature proved so popular that it was eventually syndicated by King Features Syndicate beginning in 1936, with a Sunday panel added on July 4, 1943.

==Characters and story==
The gags illustrated minor absurdities, frustrations, hypocrisies, ironies and misfortunes of everyday life. These were displayed in a single-panel or two-panel format. If two panels, the left-side panel showed some deceptive, pretentious, unwitting or scheming human behavior, with the second panel revealing the truth of the situation.

Hellish scenes were the subjects of his topper strip, &quot;The Hatlo Inferno&quot;, which ran with &quot;They&#x27;ll Do It Every Time&quot; from 1953 to 1958. An occasional feature of &quot;They&#x27;ll Do It Every Time&quot; was &quot;Hatlo&#x27;s History&quot; which enabled the cartoonist to satirize memorable moments from earlier centuries.

In its early decades, a timid man named Henry Tremblechin was a recurring victim of the strip&#x27;s observations. Tremblechin&#x27;s bratty daughter, Little Iodine, appeared so often she graduated into her own comic strip (Aug 15, 1943 – Aug 14, 1983), comic book (1949–62), a 1946 movie and a 1988 animated cartoon show.

==A tip of the Hatlo hat==
Ideas and gags usually came from suggestions by readers, who were credited with a small acknowledgment box with a tiny drawing of Hatlo tipping his hat. Hatlo continued working on &quot;They&#x27;ll Do It Every Time&quot; until his death in 1963 when the team of Al Scaduto and Bob Dunn took over the strip. The readers continued to be credited for their suggestions, but the drawing of the &quot;Hatlo hat&quot; was dropped. 

After Dunn&#x27;s death in 1989, &quot;They&#x27;ll Do It Every Time&quot; was written and drawn by Scaduto, who died December 8, 2007, at age 79. King Features announced that the strip would not continue with another cartoonist and ceased publication on February 2, 2008. At the time of Scaduto&#x27;s death, King Features was distributing the panel to more than 100 American newspapers.

==Awards==
The strip, as well as Bob Dunn, received the National Cartoonists Society&#x27;s Newspaper Panel Cartoon Award for 1968, 1969 and 1979 (with Al Scaduto), plus the Reuben Award for 1975. Al Scaduto won the Newspaper Panel Cartoon Award for 1991 and 1997 for his work on the strip.

==Open-source games with non-free data==
Only the game engines in this table are developed under an open-source license, which means that the reuse and modification of only the code is permitted. As some of the games&#x27; content created by the developers (sound, graphics, video and other artwork) is proprietary or restricted in use, the whole games are non-free and restricted in reuse (depending on the content license). The motivation of developers to keep own game content non-free while they open the source code may be the protection of the game as sellable commercial product. It could also be the prevention of a commercialization of a free product in future, e.g. when distributed under a non-commercial license like CC NC. By replacing the non-free content with free content, these games could also become completely free. In practice, many projects include a mixture of free and non-free own content.

The video game remakes in this table were developed under an open-source license which allows usually the reuse, modification and commercial redistribution of the code. The required game content (artwork, data, etc.) is taken from a proprietary and non-opened commercial game, so that the whole game is non-free. See also the Game engine recreation page.

<text>Genevieve Mary Lloyd (born 16 October 1941 at Cootamundra, New South Wales), is an Australian philosopher and feminist.

==Biography==
Lloyd studied philosophy at the University of Sydney in the early 1960s and then at Somerville College, Oxford. Her D.Phil, awarded in 1973, was on &quot;Time and Tense&quot;. From 1967 until 1987 she lectured at the Australian National University, during which period she developed her most influential ideas and wrote &quot;The Man of Reason&quot;, which was published in 1984. In 1987 she was appointed to the chair of philosophy at the University of New South Wales, being the first female professor of philosophy appointed in Australia. She was elected a Fellow of the Australian Academy of the Humanities in 1995. On retirement, she was appointed Professor Emerita.

==Philosophical work==
Lloyd&#x27;s 1979 paper &quot;The Man of Reason&quot; explores the influence of seventeenth century rationalist philosophy on contemporary views of gender and reason. It argues that Cartesian method encouraged a new polarisation between reason, on the one side, and emotion and imagination on the other. The &quot;Man of Reason&quot; was further elevated to an ethical (not merely epistemic) ideal in Spinoza&#x27;s Ethics. Even though Descartes and Spinoza&#x27;s rationalism is less popular today, Lloyd argues that we continue to live with the ideal of the Man of Reason their work gave rise to. She went on to develop these ideas further in her 1984 book of the same name.

<text>Zhu Yu ( 朱昱 b. 1970) is a performance artist living in Beijing, China. Zhu graduated from the Affiliated High School of the China Central Academy of Fine Arts in 1991. His work deals with subjects of contemporary art.

==Background==
Zhu Yu is often termed the most controversial and criticized artist in China. Zhu graduated from the Affiliated High School of the Central Academy of Fine Arts in 1991. His contemporary performance art raises questions about moral agendas and draws an audience through its shock value. His artwork often encompasses the human body. He is categorized by some critics as an artist of the &quot;cadaver school,&quot; which consists of artists who tend to use human body parts in their work.

Yu&#x27;s most famous piece of conceptual art, titled &quot;Eating People,&quot; was performed at a Shanghai arts festival in 2000. It consisted of him cooking and eating what is alleged to be a human fetus. The picture, circulated on the internet via e-mail in 2001, provoked investigations by both the FBI and Scotland Yard. It was intended as &quot;shock art&quot;. Snopes and other urban legend sites have said the &quot;fetus&quot; used by Zhu Yu was most likely constructed from a duck&#x27;s body and a doll&#x27;s head. Other images from another art exhibit were falsely circulated along with Zhu Yu&#x27;s photos and claimed to be evidence of fetus soup. The piece&#x27;s cannibalistic theme caused a stir in Britain when Yu&#x27;s work was featured on a Channel 4 documentary exploring Chinese Contemporary Art in 2003. In response to the public reaction, Mr. Yu stated, &quot;No religion forbids cannibalism. Nor can I find any law which prevents us from eating people. I took advantage of the space between morality and the law and based my work on it&quot;. Yu created a fictional film in 2003 titled &quot;Corpse Case&quot; which was based on &quot;Eating People&quot;. In it, the main character eats a fetus which was stolen from a medical school. 
Images from the piece have also been used in anti-Chinese propaganda, disseminated by e-mail and social media with a short text attached explaining the images show China&#x27;s &quot;hottest food&quot; and that dead fetuses can be bought for 10–12,000 yen (approximately US$100–US$120). Recipients are encouraged to forward the mail, and the explanatory text is written in both English and Korean script. The Turkistan Islamic Party claimed that &quot;Muslim children in Turkistan&quot; were eaten by the Chinese, showing the faked pictures by Zhu Yu and photos of fake fetuses from an art exhibit.

==Exhibitions==
Zhu Yu has been involved in many group exhibitions including Post-Sense Sensibility- Alien Bodies &amp; Delusion in Beijing (January 1999), and The Third Guangzhou Triennial in Guangzhou (September 2008), which involved 181 artists from 40 countries.
Most notable is his work at the Fuck Off Exhibit curated by Ai Weiwei and Feng Boyi in Shanghai, 2000. This controversial exhibit hosted 48 contemporary avant-garde artists. This is where his most controversial piece of performance art &quot;Eating People&quot; appeared. Among his other solo exhibitions are Plaything (Long March Space, Beijing 2010) and Leftover (Xin Beijing Art Gallery, Beijing, 2007).

==Significant works==
The Foundation of All Epistemology: This work appeared in the 1998 group exhibition &quot;It&#x27;s All Right&quot; in Shanghai. For this piece, Zhu Yu cut and boiled five human brains which were purchased from a local hospital. He placed them in neatly labelled jars that he then signed with his own name. Zhu put these jars of brains up for sale in a market that sponsored the exhibit. He ended up selling 15 bottles each for the price of 98 yuans.
Eating People: In his performance art piece Eating People, Zhu photographs himself cooking and eating a human fetus that he divided into five parts. Zhu says that &quot;I herewith announce my intention and my aim to eat people as a protest against mankind&#x27;s moral idea that he/she cannot eat people.&quot; In further response to Zhu&#x27;s performance, The Ministry of Culture cited a menace to social order and the spiritual health of the Chinese people, and banned exhibitions involving culture, animal abuse, corpses, and overt violence and sexuality. However, this piece did not even appear at the exhibit; the night before the exhibition, Ai Weiwei collaborated with Zhu and the photographs were removed from the gallery. This piece was thought particularly controversial, and organizers did not want to risk government censorship for the rest of the exhibit. The response to this work stemmed from its appearance on the internet shortly after. This later generated the question of whether eating babies was accepted in Asia on various myth-debunking websites.

Pocket Theology: Appearing in the 1999 group exhibition &quot;Post-Sense Sensibility- Alien Bodies &amp; Delusion&quot; in Beijing, curated by Wu Meichun and Qiu Zhije. A long coiling rope was gripped by a severed, decomposing arm which was suspended by a meat hook. This display was held in a small room in the basement that was being rented by a group of Chinese artists who organised the exhibition. Viewers were forced to walk over the rope which filled the entire space.

Skin Graft: This performance art installation appeared in the 2000 exhibition &quot;Infatuation with Injury&quot; organized by Li Xianting. In the exhibit, Zhu uses his own flesh as a canvas. Photos were shown of the trunk of a quartered pig lying on a hospital bed. Zhu grafted a piece of his own skin onto a section of damaged skin from the pig. Two photos of this process appeared in the exhibit; one that showed the surgical process, and another which featured the artist sewing his own skin onto the pig carcass. Zhu stood by the exhibit and lifted his shirt to show the scar which stood as evidence of the procedure.

Leftover: This series was exhibited by the Xin Beijing Art Gallery at the China International Gallery Exposition. Zhu photographed plates that held bits of leftover food and then painted those images on canvas with oil. Eight paintings appeared at the Xin Beijing Art Gallery.

==Recent works==

Zhu Yu&#x27;s most recent works follow his ideas with the Leftover exhibit, in which he paints highly detailed portraits of mundane objects. His series &quot;Stain,&quot; features a bird&#x27;s-eye view of teacups that contain the dregs of tea leaves. The next series, &quot;Pebble,&quot; appeared at Zhu&#x27;s solo exhibition &quot;Play Thing&quot;, at the Long March Space in Beijing, 2010. This is another series of highly detailed, realistic paintings that show individual pebbles, each featuring a slightly different hue or shape. This work implies that all life can be reduced to a pebble, a simple object from which much meaning can be derived.

<doc id="732727" wikidata="Q61027" url="?curid=732727" title="Max Hoffmann">
<text>Carl Adolf Maximilian Hoffmann (25 January 1869 – 8 July 1927) was a German military officer and strategist. As a staff officer at the beginning of World War I, he was Deputy Chief of Staff of the 8th Army, soon promoted Chief of Staff. Hoffmann, along with Erich Ludendorff, masterminded the devastating defeat of the Russian armies at Tannenberg and the Masurian Lakes. He then held the position of Chief of Staff of the Eastern Front. At the end of 1917, he negotiated with Russia to sign the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk.

== Early life and prewar military career ==
Hoffmann was born in Homberg (Efze) and was the son of a district court judge. From 1879 to 1887, he studied at the gymnasium in the city of Nordhausen. After his graduation, he volunteered for the 72nd Infantry Regiment. One of his comrades affectionately recalled, &quot;He was almost the worst athlete, horseman and swordsman of them all... he exceeded them in his terrifying appetite&quot;. As an ensign, he studied at the Kriegsschule (Officer School) in Neisse from October 1887 to August 1888, graduated with an Imperial commendation and was commissioned second lieutenant. From 1895 to 1898, as a first lieutenant, he attended the Prussian War Academy and then was sent to Russia to study the Russian language. He was on the General Staff from 1899 to 1901 in the First Department (Russia and the Nordic States). In 1901, he was promoted to captain and assigned as a staff officer to V Army Corps. Two years later, he moved to command a company in the 33rd Fusilier Regiment. In 1904 the General Staff sent him to Manchuria as an observer with the Imperial Japanese Army in its war against the Imperial Russian Army. During that time, he is remembered for breaching protocol in the presence of other foreign observers when a Japanese general refused to allow him on to a hill to watch a battle. That led him to respond that the general was &quot;a yellow-skin&quot; and that he was &quot;uncivilized if you don&#x27;t let me go over that hill&quot;.

He returned to the staff twenty months later before he was assigned as the first staff officer of the 1st Division, stationed in Königsberg, East Prussia. In 1911, he became an instructor at the War Academy for two years before he moved to the 112th Infantry Regiment, where he had a field and then a staff position and was promoted to lieutenant colonel.

==World War I==
===Eighth Army===
At the outbreak of World War I Hoffmann became the first general staff officer of the German Eighth Army and was responsible for defending their eastern border from a Russian attack. The bulk of the German Army, following the Schlieffen Plan, was attempting to gain decisive victory in the west by knocking France out of the war. The Russian mobilization had begun secretly before the declaration of war and so much earlier than anticipated that the Russian First Army invaded East Prussia across its eastern frontier. The Eighth Army attacked it unsuccessfully at the Battle of Gumbinnen on 20 August 1914. The Germans learned that the Russian Second Army was approaching their southern frontier in the west. To avoid being cut off the alarmed Eighth Army commander, Maximilian von Prittwitz, proposed to retreat over the Vistula River and to abandon East Prussia to the invaders. He soon reconsidered and instead decided to move the bulk of his forces to block the Russian Second Army from reaching the Vistula, but he and his chief of staff had already been relieved in favor of Paul von Hindenburg and Erich Ludendorff. Hoffmann knew Ludendorff well because they had been neighbours in the same building in Berlin for several years.

The two Russian armies were too far apart to readily aid each other, and the Germans could gauge their lack of co-ordination from intercepted radio messages. When Hindenburg and Ludendorff stepped off of their special train, they announced that the Eighth Army would be put into position to encircle and annihilate Alexander Samsonov&#x27;s Russian Second Army. They did so by winning the crucial victory in the Battle of Tannenberg, saving the rest of Germany from invasion. Hoffmann saw the propaganda value of casting the German victory as long-awaited revenge for a nearby medieval defeat and so he suggested the engagement be named Tannenberg, though it actually took place much closer to Allenstein. (Ludendorff also claimed credit for the name, but it was Hindenburg, having lost an ancestor at the earlier battle, who requested that the Kaiser use it.) Next, the Eighth Army turned east and mauled Paul von Rennenkampf&#x27;s Russian First Army at the First Battle of the Masurian Lakes, which freed most of East Prussia.

===Ninth Army and &quot;Ober Ost&quot;===

Then, Hindenburg, Ludendorff and Hoffmann led a new Ninth Army in blocking a Russian attempt to invade German Silesia, continuing the campaign after being given command of all of the German forces on the Eastern Front, which were designated as &quot;Ober Ost&quot;. In the Battle of Łódź they ended the immediate threat by outflanking the Russians and capturing Poland&#x27;s second city. Hoffmann believed that if given the reinforcements that they requested for the battle, they might have knocked Russia out of the war. During the winter lull in the fighting, &quot;Ober Ost&quot; struggled unsuccessfully to shift major operations eastward in the coming year and claimed that it could force the Russians out of the war by encircling its armies in the Polish salient.

&quot;Ober Ost&quot; began 1915 with a surprise attack in a snowstorm that encircled a Russian army, completed the liberation of East Prussia and obtained a foothold in Russia&#x27;s Baltic provinces. Hoffmann believed that if it were allowed to continue the incursion, he might have inflicted a major, perhaps mortal, defeat on the Russians. Instead, the Germans were ordered to stop in favour of a major thrust in the south of Poland at Gorlice and Tarnów in which a joint Austro-German army gradually battered the Russians out of Galicia (Austro-Hungarian Poland). To assist, &quot;Ober Ost&quot; was ordered to mount similar costly head-on attacks in northern Poland. After the Russians had evacuated Poland, &quot;Ober Ost&quot; was permitted to continue thrusting into Russia&#x27;s Baltic provinces. By the start of winter, its headquarters were in the Lithuanian city of Kovno. Hoffmann saw to the construction a strong defensive line on the new front and visited all of the units: &quot;I have crawled through all the trenches... The mud is terrible&quot;. Meanwhile, Ludendorff set up an administration for the occupied region.

During the winter, the Russians finally armed their troops adequately. In the spring, masses of Russians attacked the &quot;Ober Ost&quot; entrenchments. The German line held, except for one segment that was vacated and then recaptured in April. To exploit the successful defence, &quot;Ober Ost&quot; pleaded for reinforcements to enable it to capture the fortress of Riga and to roll up the Russian armies in the north, but the Supreme Commander focused on his fruitless attacks on Verdun. On 4 June the Russians attacked the Austro-Hungarian lines in the south. In a few days, the defenders lost 200,000 prisoners, and the Russians penetrated through their fortifications. &quot;Ober Ost&quot; sent reinforcements south and more had to come from the west. To Hoffmann, the Austrian front was &quot;like a mouth full of sensitive teeth&quot;. At last, in July, Hindenburg&#x27;s command was extended further south, including many of the Austro-Hungarians on the front. Therefore, they moved their headquarters south to Brest-Litovsk. When the Russians also renewed their attacks in the north, the German reserves in the east were a single cavalry brigade. In addition to plugging holes along their long front, the staff was busy organizing training for the Austro-Hungarians whom they now commanded and the Russians were still pushing back.

===Chief of the staff in east===
The crisis worsened when Romania entered the war on the side of the Entente. Hindenburg and Ludendorff became the Supreme Commanders. Field Marshal Prince Leopold of Bavaria, whom Hoffmann regarded as &quot;a clever soldier and a distinguished superior officer&quot;, took command of three army groups that included both German and Austro-Hungarian troops and Hoffmann was elated to become his chief of staff with promotion to major general: &quot;I shall actually become an Excellenz!&quot;. He was supported by a highly-competent staff. Eventually, they commanded all of the forces of the Central Powers on the Eastern Front: German, Austro-Hungarian, Ottoman, and Bulgarian. Since he was no longer able to visit the front in person, he was assigned a General Staff officer, Major Wachenfeld, for this purpose. The Russians shifted their attacks to the south to support Romania but were beaten decisively by an army with troops from all of the Central Powers.

That autumn, Franz Joseph I of Austria died. His successor, Charles I, who had been a cavalry officer, appointed himself commander-in-chief and replaced their able chief of staff with &quot;a more conciliatory personage&quot;.

Hoffmann had a two-hour conversation in which the young emperor &quot;gave his opinion on military matters by which he displayed his great want of understanding in all he said&quot;.

Hoffmann corresponded and met with political leaders like Wolfgang Kapp, a founder of the right-wing Fatherland Party who after the war led a failed putsch to overturn the Weimar Republic.
When 1917 dawned, the battering made the Russian infantry seem to have suffered when attacking, and most were now willing only to defend their positions. The February Revolution then led to a new Russian government, under Alexander Kerensky. Hoffmann wanted to attack, but only a single division was given to him to reduce a Russian bridgehead. In July, Kerensky launched an offensive in Galicia in the hope of reinvigorating public support for the war. Hoffmann had anticipated the attack and was eager to launch his countermove.

At first, the Austro-Hungarians lost ground, but on 19 July, Prince Leopold and Hoffmann were in a tower to watch the Germans counterattack the flank of the Russian incursion slicing through to the rear. In a few days, the Russians were driven out of Galicia, but further pursuit had to be delayed while the railroads were repaired. Hoffmann was rewarded with the Oak Leaves for his &quot;Pour le Mérite&quot;. On 1 September, he attacked the Riga fortresses, by throwing pontoon bridges across the intervening river. He took Riga, but most of the defenders had slipped out.

On 26 November, he received a wireless message from the new Russian Bolshevik government, which requested an armistice. The Germans sent a delegation to Hoffmann&#x27;s headquarters after they had dining with the delegation in the mess room that included a peasant and a political assassin. He was dismayed that they had been received as representing Russia. He assisted Foreign Secretary Richard von Kühlmann during the negotiations for the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk since his fluent Russian was an asset. Austro-Hungarian Foreign Minister Ottokar Czernin found, &quot;The General [Hoffmann] combined expert knowledge and energy with a good deal of calm and ability, but also not a little of Prussian brutality...&quot;. The negotiations dragged on; the major sticking point was that the Russians would not be given back Poland, Lithuania or Courland, which the Central Powers maintained had opted for independence.

In December 1917, he was summoned to Berlin, where at lunch, the Kaiser ordered him, despite his objections, to give his opinion regarding the postwar German–Polish border. He favoured taking from Poland a modest defensive strip to acquire as few new Slavic subjects as possible. The Supreme Commanders wanted much of Poland and so they were furious when the Kaiser endorsed his viewpoint. Both threatened to resign; the Kaiser gave in on the border but refused Ludendorff&#x27;s demand for Hoffmann to be sent off to command a division. Hindenburg does not mention him in his memoirs.

Ludendorff undermined him with a press campaign that alleged that his ideas came from his Jewish wife, who was a well-known artist from a family of converts. Hoffmann wrote &quot;great men can also be very small sometimes&quot;.

After a break, the negotiations were resumed with Foreign Commissar Leon Trotsky, who led the Russian delegation; he stopped them from eating with the enemy. Hoffmann did not write any clause in the treaty, but Trotsky &quot;did not doubt for a single minute that... General Hoffmann was the only element of serious reality in these negotiations&quot;. The Central Powers simultaneously negotiated with a delegation representing an independent Ukraine. In late January 1918, Trotsky returned to Petrograd to consult about the Ukrainian problem. When he returned, a peace with the Ukrainians had been signed. On 10 February, Trotsky announced that Russia would consider the war at an end but would not sign the proposed treaty. Eight days, later the Eastern Army resumed its offensive and swept over the remainder of the Baltic provinces without opposition. After two days, the Russians caved in, and the treaty was signed on 3 March 1918.

German troops marched into Ukraine to prop up the beleaguered independent government and also went further east into the Don basin to obtain the coal to ship the grain that they had seized.
Hoffmann anticipated that the Crimea would become the German Riviera. The Supreme Commanders set up new administrations for Ukraine and the Baltic States and strikingly diminished Prince Leopold&#x27;s and Hoffmann&#x27;s territorial sway since they were left with only &quot;Ober Ost&quot;. Hoffmann argued unsuccessfully that to counter the Bolsheviks, they should denounce the treaty and forcibly establish a new government in Russia.

==Later life==

In 1919, he was given command of a brigade along the Polish border. The leader of the new small German Army was Hans von Seeckt, who had quarreled with Hoffmann during the war. Hoffmann was retired in March 1920 and settled back in Berlin, where he reconciled with Hindenburg at a personal meeting. He and the industrialist Arnold Rechberg campaigned persistently trying to persuade the western powers to join to overthrow the Soviet Union. He published his wartime memoirs and evaluations, his views on Russia, and his version of Tannenberg. A few years after the war, when touring the field at Tannenberg, Hoffmann told a group of army cadets, &quot;See—this is where Hindenburg slept before the battle, this is where Hindenburg slept after the battle, and between you and me this is where Hindenburg slept during the battle&quot;.

Hoffmann died at the spa at on 8 July 1927. He was rated by some historians &quot;as perhaps the most brilliant staff officer of his generation&quot; and was used as a model at the United States Army Command and General Staff College.&quot;

<doc id="732729" wikidata="Q2745415" url="?curid=732729" title="Conjunction fallacy">
<text>The conjunction fallacy (also known as the Linda problem) is an inference that a conjoint set of two or more specific conclusions is likelier than any single member of that same set, in violation of the laws of probability. It is a type of formal fallacy.

==Definition and basic example== 
The most often-cited example of this fallacy originated with Amos Tversky and Daniel Kahneman.

&quot;Linda is 31 years old, single, outspoken, and very bright. She majored in philosophy. As a student, she was deeply concerned with issues of discrimination and social justice, and also participated in anti-nuclear demonstrations.&quot;

Which is more probable?
# Linda is a bank teller.
# Linda is a bank teller and is active in the feminist movement.

The majority of those asked chose option 2. However, the probability of two events occurring together (that is, in conjunction) is always less than or equal to the probability of either one occurring itself—formally, for two events &quot;A&quot; and &quot;B&quot; this inequality could be written as formula_1 and formula_2.

For example, even choosing a very low probability of Linda&#x27;s being a bank teller, say Pr(Linda is a bank teller) = 0.05 and a high probability that she would be a feminist, say Pr(Linda is a feminist) = 0.95, then, assuming these two facts are independent of each other, Pr(Linda is a bank teller &quot;and&quot; Linda is a feminist) = 0.05 × 0.95 or 0.0475, lower than Pr(Linda is a bank teller).

Tversky and Kahneman argue that most people get this problem wrong because they use a heuristic (an easily calculated) procedure called representativeness to make this kind of judgment: Option 2 seems more &quot;representative&quot; of Linda from the description of her, even though it is clearly mathematically less likely.

In other demonstrations, they argued that a specific scenario seemed more likely because of representativeness, but each added detail would actually make the scenario less and less likely. In this way it could be similar to the misleading vividness or slippery slope fallacies. More recently Kahneman has argued that the conjunction fallacy is a type of extension neglect.

==Joint versus separate evaluation==

In some experimental demonstrations, the conjoint option is evaluated separately from its basic option. In other words, one group of participants is asked to rank-order the likelihood that Linda is a bank teller, a high school teacher, and several other options, and another group is asked to rank-order whether Linda is a bank teller and active in the feminist movement versus the same set of options (without &quot;Linda is a bank teller&quot; as an option). In this type of demonstration, different groups of subjects still rank-order Linda as a bank teller and active in the feminist movement more highly than Linda as a bank teller.

Separate evaluation experiments preceded the earliest joint evaluation experiments, and Kahneman and Tversky were surprised when the effect was observed even under joint evaluation.

In separate evaluation, the term conjunction effect may be preferred.

==Other examples==

While the Linda problem is the best-known example, researchers have developed dozens of problems that reliably elicit the conjunction fallacy. 

=== Tversky &amp; Kahneman (1981) ===

The original report by Tversky &amp; Kahneman (later republished as a book chapter) described four problems that elicited the conjunction fallacy, including the Linda problem. There was also a similar problem about a man named Bill (a good fit for the stereotype of an accountant — &quot;intelligent, but unimaginative, compulsive, and generally lifeless&quot; — but not a good fit for the stereotype of a jazz player), and two problems where participants were asked to make predictions for events that could occur in 1981.

Policy experts were asked to rate the probability that the Soviet Union would invade Poland, and the United States would break off diplomatic relations, all in the following year. They rated it on average as having a 4% probability of occurring. Another group of experts was asked to rate the probability simply that the United States would break off relations with the Soviet Union in the following year. They gave it an average probability of only 1%.

In an experiment conducted in 1980, respondents were asked the following:

Suppose Björn Borg reaches the Wimbledon finals in 1981. Please rank order the following outcomes from most to least likely.
* Borg will win the match
* Borg will lose the first set
* Borg will lose the first set but win the match
* Borg will win the first set but lose the match

On average, participants rated &quot;Borg will lose the first set but win the match&quot; more likely than &quot;Borg will lose the first set&quot;. However, winning the match is only one of several potential eventual outcomes after having lost the first set. The first and the second outcome are thus more likely (as they only contain one condition) than the third and fourth outcome (which depend on two conditions).

=== Tversky &amp; Kahneman (1983) ===

Tversky and Kahneman followed up their original findings with a 1983 paper that looked at dozens of new problems, most of these with multiple variations. The following are a couple of examples.

Consider a regular six-sided die with four green faces and two red faces. The die will be rolled 20 times and the sequence of greens (G) and reds (R) will be recorded. You are asked to select one sequence, from a set of three, and you will win $25 if the sequence you choose appears on successive rolls of the die.

# RGRRR
# GRGRRR
# GRRRRR

65% of participants chose the second sequence, though option 1 is contained within it and is shorter than the other options. In a version where the $25 bet was only hypothetical the results did not significantly differ. Tversky and Kahneman argued that sequence 2 appears &quot;representative&quot; of a chance sequence (compare to the &quot;clustering illusion&quot;).
A health survey was conducted in a representative sample of adult males in British Columbia of all ages and occupations.
Mr. F. was included in the sample. He was selected by chance from the list of participants.

Which of the following statements is more probable? (check one)

# Mr. F. has had one or more heart attacks.
# Mr. F. has had one or more heart attacks and he is over 55 years old.

The probability of the conjunctions is never greater than that of its conjuncts. Therefore, the first choice is more probable.

== Criticism ==

Critics such as Gerd Gigerenzer and Ralph Hertwig criticized the Linda problem on grounds such as the wording and framing. The question of the Linda problem may violate conversational maxims in that people assume that the question obeys the maxim of relevance. Gigerenzer argues that some of the terminology used have polysemous meanings, the alternatives of which he claimed were more &quot;natural&quot;. He argues that one meaning of &quot;probable&quot; (&quot;what happens frequently&quot;) corresponds to the mathematical probability people are supposed to be tested on, but other meanings (&quot;what is plausible&quot; and &quot;whether there is evidence&quot;) do not. The term &quot;and&quot; has even been argued to have relevant polysemous meanings. Many techniques have been developed to control for this possible misinterpretation, but none of them has dissipated the effect.

Many variations in wording of the Linda problem were studied by Tversky and Kahneman. If the first option is changed to obey conversational relevance, i.e., &quot;Linda is a bank teller whether or not she is active in the feminist movement&quot; the effect is decreased, but the majority (57%) of the respondents still commit the conjunction error. If the probability is changed to frequency format (&quot;see debiasing section below&quot;) the effect is reduced or eliminated. However, studies exist in which indistinguishable conjunction fallacy rates have been observed with stimuli framed in terms of probabilities versus frequencies.

The wording criticisms may be less applicable to the conjunction effect in separate evaluation. The &quot;Linda problem&quot; has been studied and criticized more than other types of demonstration of the effect (some described below).

In an incentivized experimental study, it has been shown that the conjunction fallacy decreased in those with greater cognitive ability, though it did not disappear. It has also been shown that the conjunction fallacy becomes less prevalent when subjects are allowed to consult with other subjects.

Still, the conjunction fallacy occurs even when people are asked to make bets with real money, and when they solve intuitive physics problems of various designs.

== Debiasing ==

Drawing attention to set relationships, using frequencies instead of probabilities, and/or thinking diagrammatically sharply reduce the error in some forms of the conjunction fallacy.

In one experiment the question of the Linda problem was reformulated as follows:

There are 100 persons who fit the description above (that is, Linda&#x27;s). How many of them are:
* Bank tellers? __ of 100
* Bank tellers and active in the feminist movement? __ of 100

Whereas previously 85% of participants gave the wrong answer (bank teller and active in the feminist movement), in experiments done with this questioning the proportion of incorrect answers is dramatically reduced (to ~20%). Participants were forced to use a mathematical approach and thus recognized the difference more easily.

However, in some tasks only based on frequencies, not on stories, that used clear logical formulations, conjunction fallacies continued to occur dominantly, with only few exceptions, when the observed pattern of frequencies resembled a conjunction.

<text>The Mutoid Waste Company are a performance arts group founded in London, England by Joe Rush and Robin Cooke in collaboration with Alan P Scott and Joshua Bowler. It started in the early 1980s, emerging from Frestonia&#x27;s &#x27;Car Breaker Gallery&#x27;. They are probably best known for their recycled art installations at Glastonbury Festival and refer to themselves as &quot;the Mutoids&quot;.

Influenced by the film &quot;Mad Max&quot; and the popular &quot;Judge Dredd&quot; comics, they specialised in organising illegal free parties in London throughout the 1980s, driven at first by eclectic assortments of fringe music such as psychedelic rock and dub reggae, but then embracing the burgeoning acid house music movement by the late 1980s.

==History==
Described as &quot;part street theatre, part art show and part traveling circus&quot; in the 1986 LWT documentary &quot;South of Watford&quot;., the group became famous for building giant welded sculptures from waste materials and for customising broken down cars, as well as making large scale murals in the disused buildings where they held their parties.

In 1989, after a number of police raids on their warehouse in King&#x27;s Cross, they left the country and travelled to Berlin, Germany where they became notorious for building giant sculptures out of old machinery and car parts, one of which was &#x27;Käferman&#x27;, a giant human figure with a Volkswagen Beetle for its chest, offering a Bird Of Peace sculpture that overlooked the Berlin Wall towards East Berlin and the regime of East Germany. They had a collection of scrap military vehicles, including a Russian MiG 21 fighter aircraft which &#x27;followed&#x27; them around wherever they went, and a painted tank known as &quot;the Pink Panzer&quot;.

Lady Emma Herbert, daughter of Henry Herbert, 17th Earl of Pembroke, met the Mutoids at about this time. They taught her acrobatic skills and she toured Europe with them, which was the beginning of her career as a circus trapeze artist.

In 1991, the Mutoids travelled to Santarcangelo di Romagna, Italy where they set up a scrap village called Mutonia and continued working, displaying and performing at squats and libertarian celebrations in the Emilia-Romagna region. A community still exists.

In 2009, the Mutoids held an exhibition &quot;Mutate Britain&quot; at their yard under the Westway in West London.

In recent years, the Mutoids have appeared at a number of British festivals and arts events, with displays of their distinctive vehicle sculptures, and they were a key part of the closing ceremony for the 2012 Summer Paralympics.

The Mutoids were also recently celebrated in a BBC Four documentary &quot;I Am A Mutoid: A Glastonbury Hero&quot; in June 2021.

<doc id="732744" wikidata="Q29457308" url="?curid=732744" title="Club 33">
<text>Club 33 is the name of a number of private dining clubs located within Disney Parks. The first opened inside Disneyland in 1967, and was modeled after sponsor lounges at the 1964 New York World&#x27;s Fair. At the time it opened, Club 33 was the only location within Disneyland that offered alcoholic beverages.

Since then, additional Club 33 locations opened at Tokyo Disneyland, at Shanghai Disneyland, and at all four theme parks at Walt Disney World Resort. Club 33 members in California also have access to the 1901 lounge inside the Carthay Circle Restaurant at California Adventure.

==Disneyland location==
Club 33 is located above &quot;Pirates of the Caribbean&quot; and adjacent to one of Walt Disney&#x27;s in-park apartments. The entrance was formerly located to the right of the Blue Bayou Restaurant at &quot;33 Royal Street,&quot; adorned with an ornate address plate.

During an extensive renovation, the Club doubled in size and the entrance was relocated to the Court of Angels. Andrew Sutton, the executive chef at the Carthay Circle and Napa Rose restaurants at the Disneyland Resort, was placed in charge of the Club&#x27;s kitchen. It reopened in July 2014.

==History==

When Walt Disney was working with various corporate promoters such as Dylan Connolly at his attractions at the 1964–1965 New York World&#x27;s Fair, he noted various &quot;VIP Lounges&quot; which provided the idea for Club 33.

Originally, Walt Disney hosted VIPs in a lounge inside the Red Wagon Inn at Disneyland. The number of VIPs grew to be too large for the lounge. Dorothea Redmond painted renderings and Hollywood set director Emile Kuri decorated the new VIP lounge in New Orleans Square. While Club 33 was originally intended to host Disneyland&#x27;s corporate sponsors, individual memberships were also offered when it was opened.

The entrance was designed to be unassuming to most guests, painted in Go Away Green. Since 2014, the entrance was moved about 40 feet away. The new entrance opens to a vestibule for checking in with a host that opens to the Court of Angels. Guests can take an Art Nouveau themed elevator or winding staircase to the second level.

At the landing, there are two dining rooms, Le Grand Salon and Le Salon Nouveau. Walls are adorned with butterflies pinned under glass and decorated with hand-painted animation cels from the original &quot;Fantasia&quot; film.

A hallway leads to Le Salon Nouveau, a member-exclusive dining room. The main dining room, Le Grand Salon, is more formal, based on New Orleans-style designs by Imagineer Kim Irvine. Prior to 2014 remodel, the style was Napoleon-era First Empire. This dining room now features &quot;a la carte&quot; service for lunch, which formerly offered a buffet.

The Club is also furnished with an ornate walnut table with white marble top was used in &quot;Mary Poppins&quot;, a harpsichord in the main lobby with a Renaissance-style painting under the lid, and an antique telephone booth similar to one from &quot;The Happiest Millionaire&quot;.

Walt Disney wanted to make use of Audio-Animatronic technology within Club 33. One partially-implemented concept would allow an operator to respond to guest conversation through an animatronic character. Some remnants of this system remain, including an animatronic vulture perched atop a grandfather clock and microphones embedded in lighting fixtures in the former Trophy Room.
==Membership==

The initial cost of membership at Disneyland and Walt Disney World was previously reported to be $35,000, followed by an annual due of $15,000–16,000. In 2012, the reported cost of membership increased to $50,000 initiation fee and $15,000 annually for individuals, more for corporations.

==Club 33 in other Disney parks==

Club 33 at Tokyo Disneyland began operations in 1983. It&#x27;s located on Center Street in World Bazaar.

Club 33 at Shanghai Disneyland opened along with the park in the summer of 2016. Like the Tokyo location, it is located in the park&#x27;s entrance area, Mickey Avenue.

Four separate Club 33 locations opened at Walt Disney World, each with their own name. Though the locations were set to open in Fall 2017, the &quot;Spotlight Lounge&quot; opened in March 2018 at Hollywood Studios, followed by &quot;Constellation Club&quot; at Epcot, &quot;Captain&#x27;s Quarters&quot; at Magic Kingdom, and &quot;Harambe House&quot; at Animal Kingdom.

<doc id="732746" wikidata="Q412798" url="?curid=732746" title="Conductive polymer">
<text>Conductive polymers or, more precisely, intrinsically conducting polymers (ICPs) are organic polymers that conduct electricity. Such compounds may have metallic conductivity or can be semiconductors. The main advantage of conductive polymers is that they are easy to process, mainly by dispersion. Conductive polymers are generally not thermoplastics, &quot;i.e.&quot;, they are not thermoformable. But, like insulating polymers, they are organic materials. They can offer high electrical conductivity but do not show similar mechanical properties to other commercially available polymers. The electrical properties can be fine-tuned using the methods of organic synthesis and by advanced dispersion techniques.

==History==
Polyaniline was first described in the mid-19th century by Henry Letheby, who investigated the electrochemical and chemical oxidation products of aniline in acidic media. He noted that the reduced form was colourless but the oxidized forms were deep blue.

The first highly-conductive organic compounds were the charge transfer complexes. In the 1950s, researchers reported that polycyclic aromatic compounds formed semi-conducting charge-transfer complex salts with halogens. In 1954, researchers at Bell Labs and elsewhere reported organic charge transfer complexes with resistivities as low as 8 Ω.cm. In the early 1970s, researchers demonstrated salts of tetrathiafulvalene show almost metallic conductivity, while superconductivity was demonstrated in 1980. Broad research on salts of charge transfer complexes continues today. While these compounds were technically not polymers, this indicated that organic compounds can carry current. While organic conductors were previously intermittently discussed, the field was particularly energized by the prediction of superconductivity following the discovery of BCS theory.

In 1963 Australians B.A. Bolto, D.E. Weiss, and coworkers reported derivatives of polypyrrole with resistivities as low as 1 Ω.cm. There have been multiple reports of similar high-conductivity oxidized polyacetylenes. With the notable exception of charge transfer complexes (some of which are even superconductors), organic molecules were previously considered insulators or at best weakly conducting semiconductors. Subsequently, DeSurville and coworkers reported high conductivity in a polyaniline. Likewise, in 1980, Diaz and Logan reported films of polyaniline that can serve as electrodes.

While mostly operating at the scale of less than 100 nanometers, &quot;molecular&quot; electronic processes can collectively manifest on a macro scale. Examples include quantum tunneling, negative resistance, phonon-assisted hopping and polarons. In 1977, Alan J. Heeger, Alan MacDiarmid and Hideki Shirakawa reported similar high conductivity in oxidized iodine-doped polyacetylene. For this research, they were awarded the 2000 Nobel Prize in Chemistry &quot;for the discovery and development of conductive polymers.&quot; Polyacetylene itself did not find practical applications, but drew the attention of scientists and encouraged the rapid growth of the field. Since the late 1980s, organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs) have emerged as an important application of conducting polymers.

==Types==
Linear-backbone &quot;polymer blacks&quot; (polyacetylene, polypyrrole, polyindole and polyaniline) and their copolymers are the main class of conductive polymers. Poly(p-phenylene vinylene) (PPV) and its soluble derivatives have emerged as the prototypical electroluminescent semiconducting polymers. Today, poly(3-alkylthiophenes) are the archetypical materials for solar cells and transistors.

The following table presents some organic conductive polymers according to their composition. The well-studied classes are written in bold and &quot;the less well studied ones are in italic&quot;.

==Synthesis==
Conductive polymers are prepared by many methods. Most conductive polymers are prepared by oxidative coupling of monocyclic precursors. Such reactions entail dehydrogenation:
:n H–[X]–H formula_1 H–[X]n–H + 2(n–1) H+ + 2(n–1) e−
The low solubility of most polymers presents challenges. Some researchers add solubilizing functional groups to some or all monomers to increase solubility. Others address this through the formation of nanostructures and surfactant-stabilized conducting polymer dispersions in water. These include polyaniline nanofibers and PEDOT:PSS. In many cases, the molecular weights of conductive polymers are lower than conventional polymers such as polyethylene. However, in some cases, the molecular weight need not be high to achieve the desired properties.

There are two main methods used to synthesize conductive polymers, chemical synthesis and electro (co)polymerization. The chemical synthesis means connecting carbon-carbon bond of monomers by placing the simple monomers under various condition, such as heating, pressing, light exposure and catalyst. The advantage is high yield. However, there are many plausible impurities in the end product. The electro (co)polymerization means inserting three electrodes (reference electrode, counter electrode and working electrode) into solution including reactors or monomers. By applying voltage to electrodes, redox reaction to synthesize polymer is promoted. Electro (co)polymerization can also be divided into Cyclic voltammetry and Potentiostatic method by applying cyclic voltage and constant voltage, respectively. The advantage of Electro (co)polymerization are the high purity of products. But the method can only synthesize a few products at a time.

==Molecular basis of electrical conductivity==
The conductivity of such polymers is the result of several processes. For example, in traditional polymers such as polyethylenes, the valence electrons are bound in sp3 hybridized covalent bonds. Such &quot;sigma-bonding electrons&quot; have low mobility and do not contribute to the electrical conductivity of the material. However, in conjugated materials, the situation is completely different. Conducting polymers have backbones of contiguous sp2 hybridized carbon centers. One valence electron on each center resides in a pz orbital, which is orthogonal to the other three sigma-bonds. All the pz orbitals combine with each other to a molecule wide delocalized set of orbitals. The electrons in these delocalized orbitals have high mobility when the material is &quot;doped&quot; by oxidation, which removes some of these delocalized electrons. Thus, the conjugated p-orbitals form a one-dimensional electronic band, and the electrons within this band become mobile when it is partially emptied. The band structures of conductive polymers can easily be calculated with a tight binding model. In principle, these same materials can be doped by reduction, which adds electrons to an otherwise unfilled band. In practice, most organic conductors are doped oxidatively to give p-type materials. The redox doping of organic conductors is analogous to the doping of silicon semiconductors, whereby a small fraction of silicon atoms are replaced by electron-rich, &quot;e.g.&quot;, phosphorus, or electron-poor, &quot;e.g.&quot;, boron, atoms to create n-type and p-type semiconductors, respectively.

Although typically &quot;doping&quot; conductive polymers involves oxidizing or reducing the material, conductive organic polymers associated with a protic solvent may also be &quot;self-doped.&quot;

Undoped conjugated polymers are semiconductors or insulators. In such compounds, the energy gap can be &gt; 2 eV, which is too great for thermally activated conduction. Therefore, undoped conjugated polymers, such as polythiophenes, polyacetylenes only have a low electrical conductivity of around 10−10 to 10−8 S/cm. Even at a very low level of doping (&lt; 1%), electrical conductivity increases several orders of magnitude up to values of around 0.1 S/cm. Subsequent doping of the conducting polymers will result in a saturation of the conductivity at values around 0.1–10 kS/cm (10–1000 S/m) for different polymers. Highest values reported up to now are for the conductivity of stretch oriented polyacetylene with confirmed values of about 80 kS/cm (8 MS/m). Although the pi-electrons in polyacetylene are delocalized along the chain, pristine polyacetylene is not a metal. Polyacetylene has alternating single and double bonds which have lengths of 1.44 and 1.36 Å, respectively. Upon doping, the bond alteration is diminished in conductivity increases. Non-doping increases in conductivity can also be accomplished in a field effect transistor (organic FET or OFET) and by irradiation. Some materials also exhibit negative differential resistance and voltage-controlled &quot;switching&quot; analogous to that seen in inorganic amorphous semiconductors.

Despite intensive research, the relationship between morphology, chain structure and conductivity is still poorly understood. Generally, it is assumed that conductivity should be higher for the higher degree of crystallinity and better alignment of the chains, however this could not be confirmed for polyaniline and was only recently confirmed for PEDOT, which are largely amorphous.

==Properties and applications==
Conductive polymers show promise in antistatic materials and they have been incorporated into commercial displays and batteries. Literature suggests they are also promising in organic solar cells, printed electronic circuits, organic light-emitting diodes, actuators, electrochromism, supercapacitors, chemical sensors, chemical sensor arrays, and biosensors, flexible transparent displays, electromagnetic shielding and possibly replacement for the popular transparent conductor indium tin oxide. Another use is for microwave-absorbent coatings, particularly radar-absorptive coatings on stealth aircraft. Conducting polymers are rapidly gaining attraction in new applications with increasingly processable materials with better electrical and physical properties and lower costs. The new nano-structured forms of conducting polymers particularly, augment this field with their higher surface area and better dispersability. Research reports showed that nanostructured conducting polymers in the form of nanofibers and nanosponges exhibit significantly improved capacitance values as compared to their non-nanostructured counterparts.

With the availability of stable and reproducible dispersions, PEDOT and polyaniline have gained some large-scale applications. While PEDOT (poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene)) is mainly used in antistatic applications and as a transparent conductive layer in form of PEDOT:PSS dispersions (PSS=polystyrene sulfonic acid), polyaniline is widely used for printed circuit board manufacturing – in the final finish, for protecting copper from corrosion and preventing its solderability. Moreover, polyindole is also starting to gain attention for various applications due to its high redox activity, thermal stability, and slow degradation properties than competitors polyaniline and polypyrrole.

=== Electroluminescence ===
Electroluminescence is light emission stimulated by electric current. In organic compounds, electroluminescence has been known since the early 1950s, when Bernanose and coworkers first produced electroluminescence in crystalline thin films of acridine orange and quinacrine. In 1960, researchers at Dow Chemical developed AC-driven electroluminescent cells using doping. In some cases, similar light emission is observed when a voltage is applied to a thin layer of a conductive organic polymer film. While electroluminescence was originally mostly of academic interest, the increased conductivity of modern conductive polymers means enough power can be put through the device at low voltages to generate practical amounts of light. This property has led to the development of flat panel displays using organic LEDs, solar panels, and optical amplifiers.

===Barriers to applications===
Since most conductive polymers require oxidative doping, the properties of the resulting state are crucial. Such materials are salt-like (polymer salt), which makes them less soluble in organic solvents and water and hence harder to process. Furthermore, the charged organic backbone is often unstable towards atmospheric moisture. Improving processability for many polymers requires the introduction of solubilizing substituents, which can further complicate the synthesis.

Experimental and theoretical thermodynamical evidence suggests that conductive polymers may even be completely and principally insoluble so that they can only be processed by dispersion.

===Trends===
Most recent emphasis is on organic light emitting diodes and organic polymer solar cells. The Organic Electronics Association is an international platform to promote applications of organic semiconductors. Conductive polymer products with embedded and improved electromagnetic interference (EMI) and electrostatic discharge (ESD) protection have led to both prototypes and products. For example, Polymer Electronics Research Center at University of Auckland is developing a range of novel DNA sensor technologies based on conducting polymers, photoluminescent polymers and inorganic nanocrystals (quantum dots) for simple, rapid and sensitive gene detection. Typical conductive polymers must be &quot;doped&quot; to produce high conductivity. As of 2001, there remains to be discovered an organic polymer that is &quot;intrinsically&quot; electrically conducting. Recently (as of 2020), researchers from IMDEA Nanoscience Institute reported experimental demonstration of the rational engineering of 1D polymers that are located near the quantum phase transition from the topologically trivial to non-trivial class, thus featuring a narrow bandgap.
