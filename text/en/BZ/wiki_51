<text>In Christian theology, baptism with the Holy Spirit, also called baptism in the Holy Spirit or baptism in the Holy Ghost, has been interpreted by different Christian denominations and traditions in a variety of ways due to differences in the doctrines of salvation and ecclesiology. It is frequently associated with incorporation into the Christian Church, the bestowal of spiritual gifts, and empowerment for Christian ministry. Spirit baptism has been variously defined as part of the sacraments of initiation into the church, as being synonymous with regeneration, or as being synonymous with Christian perfection. The term &quot;baptism with the Holy Spirit&quot; originates in the New Testament, and all Christian traditions accept it as a theological concept.

Prior to the 18th century, most denominations believed that Christians received the baptism with the Holy Spirit either upon conversion and regeneration or through rites of Christian initiation, such as water baptism and confirmation. 

Methodism and the holiness movement, which began in the mid-18th century, teach that the baptism with the Holy Spirit is the same as entire sanctification, which is believed to be a second work of grace. 

In the 20th century, Pentecostalism associated Spirit baptism with the gift of speaking in tongues (glossolalia) and spiritual empowerment, with Holiness Pentecostal fathers declaring it to be the third work of grace. As Pentecostalism continued to grow, the belief that Spirit baptism is distinct from entire sanctification became prevalent.

==Biblical description==

===Old Covenant background===

In Christian theology, the work of the Holy Spirit under the Old Covenant is viewed as less extensive than that under the New Covenant inaugurated on the day of Pentecost. The Spirit was restricted to certain chosen individuals, such as high priests and prophets. Often termed the &quot;spirit of prophecy&quot; in rabbinic writings, the Holy Spirit was closely associated with prophecy and divine inspiration. It was anticipated that in the future messianic age God would pour out his spirit upon all of Israel, which would become a nation of prophets.

===Canonical gospels===
While the exact phrase &quot;baptism with the Holy Spirit&quot; is not found in the New Testament, two forms of the phrase are found in the canonical gospels using the verb &quot;baptize&quot;, from the Greek word meaning to &quot;immerse&quot; or &quot;plunge&quot;. The baptism was spoken about by John the Baptist, who contrasted his water baptism for the forgiveness of sins with the baptism of Jesus. In Mark 1:8 and John 1:33, the Baptist proclaimed that Jesus &quot;will baptize in (the) Holy Spirit&quot;; while in Matthew 3:11 and Luke 3:16, he &quot;will baptize with Holy Spirit and fire&quot;.

Jesus is considered the first person to receive the baptism with the Holy Spirit. The Holy Spirit descended on Jesus during his baptism (Luke 3:21–22). After his baptism, Jesus goes into the wilderness and is tempted; however, he &quot;returned in the power of the Spirit&quot; (Luke 4:14). Afterward, Jesus began his ministry and displayed his power by casting out demons, healing the sick, and teaching with authority (Luke 4:16–44).

===Acts of the Apostles===

The phrase &quot;baptized in the Holy Spirit&quot; occurs two times in Acts of the Apostles, first in Acts 1:4–5 and second in Acts 11:16. Other terminology is used in Acts to indicate Spirit baptism, such as &quot;filled&quot; (Acts 2:4). &quot;Baptized in the Spirit&quot; indicates an outward immersion into the reality of the Holy Spirit, while &quot;filled with the Spirit&quot; suggests an internal diffusion. Both terms speak to the totality of receiving the Spirit. 

The baptism with the Holy Spirit is described in various places as the Spirit &quot;poured out upon&quot; (Acts 2:17–18, 33), &quot;falling upon&quot; (Acts 10:44), &quot;coming upon&quot; (Acts 1:8; 8:16; 19:6) people. To &quot;pour out&quot; suggests abundance and reflects John 3:34,&quot;God gives the Spirit without limit&quot;. Another expression, &quot;come upon&quot; is related to a statement by Jesus in Luke 24:49, &quot;I am sending the promise of my Father upon you. But stay in the city until you are clothed with power from on high&quot;. The language of &quot;come on&quot; and &quot;clothed with&quot; suggest possession by and endowment with the Holy Spirit.

The narrative of Acts begins after Jesus&#x27; crucifixion and resurrection. The resurrected Jesus directed his disciples to wait in Jerusalem for the baptism in the Holy Spirit and promised, &quot;you will receive power when the Holy Spirit has come upon you, and you will be my witnesses in Jerusalem and in all Judea and Samaria, and to the end of the earth&quot; (Acts 1:8). After his ascension, Jesus was given authority from the Father to pour out the Holy Spirit (Acts 2:33).

In the New Testament, the messianic expectations found in early Judaism were fulfilled on the day of Pentecost as recorded in Acts 2:1–41. The Christian community was gathered together in Jerusalem when a sound from heaven like rushing wind was heard and tongues like tongues of flame rested on everyone. They were filled with the Holy Spirit and began to speak in tongues, miraculously praising God in foreign languages. A crowd gathered and was addressed by the Apostle Peter who stated that the occurrence was the fulfillment of the prophecy of Joel 2, &quot;And in the last days it shall be, God declares, that I will pour out my Spirit on all flesh, and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy&quot;. Peter then explained how the Spirit came to be poured out, recounting Jesus&#x27; ministry and passion and then proclaiming his resurrection and enthronement at the right hand of God. In response, the crowd asked Peter what they should do. He responded, &quot;Repent, and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins, and ye shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost. For the promise is unto you, and to your children, and to all that are afar off, even as many as the Lord our God shall call (Acts 2:38-39).&quot; 

Baptism in the Holy Spirit occurs elsewhere in Acts. The gospel had been proclaimed in Samaria and the apostles Peter and John were sent from Jerusalem. The new believers had been baptized in water, but the Holy Spirit had not yet fallen on them. The Samaritans received the Holy Spirit when Peter and John laid their hands on them (Acts 8:14–18) The Apostle Paul was also filled with the Holy Spirit when Ananias of Damascus laid hands on him, and afterwards Paul was baptized with water (Acts 9:17–19).

Later in Acts, Peter preached the gospel to the household of Cornelius the Centurion, a gentile. While he preached, the Holy Spirit fell on the gentiles, and they began to speak in tongues. The Jewish believers with Peter were amazed, and the household was water baptized (Acts 10:44–48). While the apostle Paul was in Ephesus, he found disciples there and discovered that they did not know of the existence of the Holy Spirit and had only received John the Baptist&#x27;s baptism. After baptizing them in Jesus&#x27; name, Paul laid his hands on them, and they began to speak in tongues and prophesy (Acts 19:1–7).

==History==

===Early Christianity===
In the early Church, the laying on of hands on the newly baptized to impart the gift of the Holy Spirit was the origin of the sacrament of confirmation. In the Eastern church, confirmation continued to be celebrated immediately after water baptism. The two rites were separated in the Western church. According to Pentecostal historian H. Vinson Synan, &quot;the basic premise of Pentecostalism, that one may receive later effusions of the Spirit after initiation/conversion, can be clearly traced in Christian history to the beginnings of the rite of confirmation in the Western churches&quot;.

===Reformation era and Puritanism (16th and 17th centuries)===
Huldrych Zwingli, a leading Protestant Reformer in Switzerland, taught three distinct baptisms: water baptism, teaching baptism (having been educated about the Christian religion) and Spirit baptism. While full baptism included all three, Zwingli emphasized that the external baptisms of water and teaching could not provide salvation. The inner baptism of the Spirit alone could save because it conferred faith. According to Zwingli, the three baptisms could be given separately; Spirit baptism could occur first or last in the sequence.

Many Puritans believed that the conversion experience was followed by a later and distinct experience of the Holy Spirit. This experience was characterized by receiving assurance of one&#x27;s salvation. English Puritan Thomas Goodwin equated this experience with the baptism in the Holy Spirit and the &quot;seal of the Spirit&quot; referenced in Ephesians 1.

===Methodism and the Holiness Movement (18th and 19th centuries)===

Wesley taught that while the new birth (first work of grace) was the start of the Christian life, but &quot;inbred sin&quot; remained and must be removed through Christian perfection, which he stated had instantaneous and gradual aspects. John Fletcher, Wesley&#x27;s designated successor and Methodism&#x27;s systematic theologian, called Christian perfection (entire sanctification) &quot;baptism in the Holy Spirit&quot;. On the subject, Fletcher wrote:
In mid-19th century America, the Wesleyan holiness movement that had adherents both within and outside mainline Methodism began to emphasize the instantaneous aspect of Wesley&#x27;s doctrine of entire sanctification (second work of grace), which one received by faith at a definite moment in time. This second blessing (or second work of grace), as it was commonly called, allowed Christians to be freed from the power of sin. Following the Methodist theologian John Fletcher, adherents of the holiness movement use the term baptism in the Holy Spirit synonymously with entire sanctification. This is reflected in the doctrinal statements of various Wesleyan denominations, such as the Missionary Methodist Church, which teaches: &quot;We believe that a believer can be sanctified or filled with the Holy Ghost subsequent to Salvation and will receive Power to live a Holy Life and Witness to a lost and dying World.&quot;

Synan traces the influence of Catholic and Anglican mystical traditions on John Wesley&#x27;s doctrine of Christian perfection or entire sanctification. Furthermore, theologian James Dunn notes early Methodist beliefs can be directly linked to Puritan teaching on the Holy Spirit.

===Keswick higher life movement (19th century)===
After his conversion in 1821, Presbyterian minister and revivalist Charles Grandison Finney experienced what he called &quot;baptism in the Holy Spirit&quot; accompanied by &quot;unutterable gushings&quot; of praise. Finney and other Reformed writers, known as Oberlin perfectionists, agreed that there was a life altering experience after conversion, but unlike their Wesleyan holiness counterparts, they conceived of it as an ongoing process enabling believers to devote themselves wholly to Christ&#x27;s service. Similarly, the English Higher Life movement taught that the second blessing was an &quot;enduement of power&quot;. According to this view, Spirit baptism gave Christians the ability to be witnesses for the gospel and to perform Christian service. Wesleyan teachers emphasized purity while Oberlin and higher life advocates stressed power as the defining outcome of Spirit baptism.

===20th century===
In the early 1890s, R.C. Horner, a Canadian holiness evangelist, introduced a theological distinction that would be important for the development of Pentecostalism. He argued in his books &quot;Pentecost&quot; (1891) and &quot;Bible Doctrines&quot; (1909) that the baptism in the Holy Spirit was not synonymous with the second blessing but was actually a third work of grace subsequent to salvation and sanctification that empowered the believer for service. Charles Fox Parham would build on this doctrinal foundation when he identified speaking in tongues as the Bible evidence of Spirit baptism. John Wesley&#x27;s &quot;Checks to Antinomianism&quot; became a standard for Holiness Pentecostal teachers.

==Views==

The diverse views on Spirit-baptism held among Christian traditions can be categorized into four main groups. These are baptism with the Spirit as sacramental initiation (Orthodox and Catholic churches), regeneration (Reformed tradition), entire sanctification (Methodist tradition, along with others in the holiness movement) and empowerment for witness and vocation (Pentecostals and charismatics).
===Sacramental initiation===
====Eastern Orthodoxy====

Eastern Orthodox Churches believe that baptism in the Holy Spirit is conferred with water baptism. The individual is anointed with oil (chrism) immediately after baptism. According to Cyril of Jerusalem:
====Catholicism====
The Catholic Church teaches that baptism, confirmation, and the Eucharist—the sacraments of Christian initiation—lay the foundations of the Christian life. The Christian life is based on baptism. It is &quot;the gateway to life in the Spirit&quot; and &quot;signifies and actually brings about the birth of water and the Spirit&quot;. The post-baptismal anointing (Chrismation in the Eastern churches) signifies the gift of the Holy Spirit and announces a second anointing to be conferred later in confirmation that completes the baptismal anointing.

Confirmation, then, is necessary for the completion of baptismal grace. When confirmed, Catholics receive the &quot;special outpouring of the Holy Spirit as once granted to the apostles on the day of Pentecost&quot;. For the confirmand it increases the seven gifts of the Holy Spirit (wisdom, understanding, counsel, fortitude, knowledge, piety, and fear of the Lord), unites more fully to Christ and the Church, and gives strength to confess Christ and defend the faith. The rite of confirmation orients toward mission, and many liturgical texts remind the initiate that the gift of the Holy Spirit should be used for service to the church and the world.

Those in the charismatic movement, including the Catholic Charismatic Renewal, teach an experiential baptism of the Holy Spirit similar to Pentecostals, defining it as the &quot;sovereign action of God, which usually occurs when someone with a disposition of surrender and docility, prays for a fresh outpouring of the Holy Spirit in his or her life.&quot; The consensus of Catholic theologians teach that this &quot;baptism in the Holy Spirit unleashes the Holy Spirit that is already present within us, by revitalizing the graces we received in the sacrament of Baptism.&quot; At the same time, &quot;Baptism in the Spirit doesn&#x27;t only re-ignite the graces already given to Christians through the Sacraments – it&#x27;s also a new, fresh experience of the Holy Spirit which equips and inspires the individual for service, for mission, for discipleship and for life.&quot; Rev. Brenton Cordeiro teaches that those who have received Baptism with the Holy Spirit &quot;testify that the experience brought them to a new awareness of the reality and presence of Jesus Christ in their lives [as well as] a new hunger for the Word of God, the Sacraments and were filled with a renewed desire for holiness.&quot;

====Irvingism====
The New Apostolic Church, an Irvingian Church, believes that baptism in the Holy Spirit is a second step after the Holy Baptism with water. It also referred to as the &quot;Holy Sealing&quot;. It is a sacrament through which the believer, through the laying on of hands and the prayer of an apostle, receives the gift of the Holy Spirit. The death out of water and spirit, which was begun in the Holy Baptism with water, is completed through the Holy Sealing.

===Regeneration===

The main position on Spirit baptism among the Reformed churches, dispensationalists, and many Baptists is that the baptism with the Holy Spirit occurs simultaneously with regeneration, when those who have faith in Jesus Christ receive the Holy Spirit and are incorporated into the body of Christ.

===Entire sanctification===
====Methodism (inclusive of the holiness movement)====

Within Methodism (inclusive of the holiness movement), baptism with the Holy Spirit occurs through entire sanctifiation. John Fletcher, the systematic theologian of Methodism, articulated this Wesleyan doctrine, and held that this second work of grace was the &quot;full measure of the spirit, which perfects Christian believers.&quot; The United Methodist Confession of Faith affirms Wesley&#x27;s doctrine of entire sanctifiation (also known as Christian perfection):

In the holiness movement within mainline Methodism and outside of it, entire sanctification is emphasized as a definite experience linked to baptism with the Holy Spirit:
According to the Articles of Faith of the Church of the Nazarene, sanctification is a work of God after regeneration &quot;which transforms believers into the likeness of Christ&quot; and is made possible by &quot;initial sanctification&quot; (which occurs simultaneously with regeneration and justification), entire sanctification, and &quot;the continued perfecting work of the Holy Spirit culminating in glorification&quot;. Entire sanctification (as opposed to growth in grace) is an act of God in which a believer is made free from original sin and able to devote themselves entirely to God:
As baptism with the Holy Spirit is synonymous with Entire Sanctification in Methodism, some Methodist connexions who have not allowed for the charismatic movement, such as the Immanuel Missionary Church, condemn Pentecostal theology:
In certain Methodist denominations, such as the Global Methodist Church and United Methodist Church, the ordinance of confirmation is observed, in which a believer is strengthened by the Holy Spirit through the laying on of hands; Methodism&#x27;s systematic theologian John William Fletcher saw being entirely sanctified as the goal of the vows made at confirmation. John Wesley laid emphasis upon the second work of grace—entire sanctification—as &quot;a personal, non-ceremonial experience of sanctifying grace&quot;, which distinguishes Methodism.

====Quakerism (inclusive of the holiness movement)====

Following the new birth, George Fox taught the possibility of &quot;holiness of heart and life through the instantaneous baptism with the Holy Spirit subsequent to the new birth&quot; (cf. Christian perfection).

The early Quakers, following Fox, taught that as a result of the New Birth through the power of the Holy Spirit, man could be free from actual sinning if he continued to rely on the inward light and &quot;focus on the cross of Christ as the center of faith&quot;. George Fox emphasized &quot;personal responsibility for faith and emancipation from sin&quot; in his teaching on perfection. For the Christian, &quot;perfectionism and freedom from sin were possible in this world&quot;.

This traditional Quaker teaching continues to be emphasized by Conservative Friends, such as the Ohio Yearly Meeting of the Religious Society of Friends and Holiness Friends, such as the Central Yearly Meeting of Friends.

===Empowerment===
====Classical Pentecostalism====
In classical Pentecostalism, the baptism with the Holy Spirit is understood to be a separate and distinct experience occurring sometime after regeneration. Influenced by the Holiness movement, baptism with the Holy Spirit was regarded by the first Pentecostals as being the third work of grace, following the new birth (first work of grace) and entire sanctification (second work of grace). Baptism with the Holy Spirit is an empowering experience, equipping Spirit-filled believers for witness and ministry. Extending from this is the belief that all the spiritual gifts mentioned in the New Testament are to be sought and exercised to build up the church. Pentecostals believe that Spirit baptism will be accompanied by the physical evidence of speaking in tongues (glossolalia).

According to Pentecostal biblical interpretation, the Gospel of John 20:22 shows that the disciples of Jesus were already born again before the Holy Spirit fell at Pentecost. They then cite biblical examples in the Book of Acts 2, 8, 10, and 19 to show that it was common in the New Testament for Spirit baptism to occur after conversion. In following the biblical pattern, they argue, Christians today should also pray for this baptism which results in greater power for ministry and witness.

On the subject of Spirit baptism, Donald Gee wrote of the Christians on the Day of Pentecost:

In Pentecostal experience, Spirit baptism can be quite dramatic, as shown by William Durham&#x27;s account of his Spirit baptism:


In some accounts of Spirit baptism, Pentecostals report receiving visions, such as the account of Lucy Leatherman, an Azusa Street participant:

====Charismatic movement====

The charismatic movement is an interdenominational revival that has affected the mainstream denominations of Christianity, including Lutheranism, Catholicism, Moravianism, Anglicanism, Methodism, and Reformed Christianity, among others. They are distinguished from Pentecostals because they tend to allow for differing viewpoints on whether Spirit baptism is subsequent to conversion and whether tongues is always a sign of receiving the baptism.

The Catholic Charismatic Renewal believes that there is a further experience of empowerment with the Holy Spirit. The Rev. Brenton Cordeiro states that Baptism with the Holy Spirit is the &quot;sovereign action of God, which usually occurs when someone with a disposition of surrender and docility, prays for a fresh outpouring of the Holy Spirit in his or her life.&quot; As stated by Rev. Fr. Raniero Cantalamessa, &quot;baptism in the Spirit is not a sacrament, but it is related to a sacrament[...] to the sacraments of Christian initiation. The baptism in the Spirit makes real and in a way renews Christian initiation&quot;. The consensus of Catholic theologians teach that &quot;baptism in the Holy Spirit unleashes the Holy Spirit that is already present within us, by revitalizing the graces we received in the sacrament of Baptism.&quot; At the same time, &quot;Baptism in the Spirit doesn&#x27;t only re-ignite the graces already given to Christians through the Sacraments – it&#x27;s also a new, fresh experience of the Holy Spirit which equips and inspires the individual for service, for mission, for discipleship and for life.&quot; Rev. Brenton Cordeiro teaches that those who have received Baptism with the Holy Spirit &quot;testify that the experience brought them to a new awareness of the reality and presence of Jesus Christ in their lives [as well as] a new hunger for the Word of God, the Sacraments and were filled with a renewed desire for holiness.&quot;

====Neo-charismatic movement====
During the 1980s, another renewal movement emerged called the &quot;Third Wave of the Holy Spirit&quot; (the first wave was Pentecostalism and the second wave was the charismatic movement). Third wave charismatics stress that the preaching of the gospel, following the New Testament pattern, should be accompanied by &quot;signs, wonders, and miracles&quot;. They believe that all Christians are baptized with the Holy Spirit at conversion, and prefer to call subsequent experiences as &quot;filling&quot; with the Holy Spirit. John Wimber and the Vineyard churches are most prominently associated with this label.

===Mormonism===

In the Latter Day Saint movement, the &quot;baptism of fire and of the Holy Ghost&quot; refers to the experience of one who undergoes the ordinance of confirmation with the laying on of hands to receive the gift of the Holy Ghost. It follows baptism in water and is essential to salvation. The gift of the Holy Ghost is the privilege of receiving inspiration, divine manifestations, direction, spiritual gifts, and other blessings from the Holy Spirit (see Gifts of the Spirit in Mormonism). It begins the lifetime process of sanctification.

<doc id="740176" wikidata="Q1329584" url="?curid=740176" title="Reactive attachment disorder">
<text>Reactive attachment disorder (RAD) is described in clinical literature as a severe disorder that can affect children, although these issues do occasionally persist into adulthood. RAD is characterized by markedly disturbed and developmentally inappropriate ways of relating socially in most contexts. It can take the form of a persistent failure to initiate or respond to most social interactions in a developmentally appropriate way—known as the &quot;inhibited form&quot;. In the DSM-5, the &quot;disinhibited form&quot; is considered a separate diagnosis named &quot;disinhibited attachment disorder&quot;.

RAD arises from a failure to form normal attachments to primary caregivers in early childhood. Such a failure could result from severe early experiences of neglect, abuse, abrupt separation from caregivers between the ages of six months and three years, frequent changes of caregivers, or a lack of caregiver responsiveness to a child&#x27;s communicative efforts. It is differentiated from pervasive developmental disorder or developmental delay and from possibly comorbid conditions such as intellectual disability, all of which can affect attachment behavior. The criteria for a diagnosis of a reactive attachment &quot;disorder&quot; are very different from the criteria used in assessment or categorization of attachment &quot;styles&quot; such as insecure or disorganized attachment.

Children with RAD are presumed to have grossly disturbed internal working models of relationships that may lead to interpersonal and behavioral difficulties in later life. There are few studies of long-term effects, and there is a lack of clarity about the presentation of the disorder beyond the age of five years. However, the opening of orphanages in Eastern Europe following the end of the Cold War in the early 1990s provided opportunities for research on infants and toddlers brought up in very deprived conditions. Such research broadened the understanding of the prevalence, causes, mechanism and assessment of disorders of attachment and led to efforts from the late 1990s onwards to develop treatment and prevention programs and better methods of assessment. Mainstream theorists in the field have proposed that a broader range of conditions arising from problems with attachment should be defined beyond current classifications.

Mainstream treatment and prevention programs that target RAD and other problematic early attachment behaviors are based on attachment theory and concentrate on increasing the responsiveness and sensitivity of the caregiver, or if that is not possible, placing the child with a different caregiver. Most such strategies are in the process of being evaluated. Mainstream practitioners and theorists have presented significant criticism of the diagnosis and treatment of alleged reactive attachment disorder or the theoretically baseless &quot;attachment disorder&quot; within the controversial form of psychotherapy commonly known as attachment therapy. Attachment therapy has a scientifically unsupported theoretical base and uses diagnostic criteria or symptom lists markedly different from criteria under ICD-10 or DSM-IV-TR, or to attachment behaviors. A range of treatment approaches are used in attachment &quot;therapy&quot;, some of which are physically and psychologically coercive, and considered to be to attachment &quot;theory&quot;.

==Signs and symptoms==

Pediatricians are often the first health professionals to assess and raise suspicions of RAD in children with the disorder. The initial presentation varies according to the child&#x27;s developmental and chronological age, although it always involves a disturbance in social interaction. Infants up to about 18–24 months may present with non-organic failure to thrive and display abnormal responsiveness to stimuli. Laboratory investigations will be unremarkable barring possible findings consistent with malnutrition or dehydration, while serum growth hormone levels will be normal or elevated.

The core feature is severely inappropriate social relating by affected children. This can manifest itself in two ways:

# Indiscriminate and excessive attempts to receive comfort and affection from any available adult, even relative strangers (older children and adolescents may also aim attempts at peers). This may often appear as denial of comfort from anyone as well.
# Extreme reluctance to initiate or accept comfort and affection, even from familiar adults, especially when distressed.

While RAD occurs in relation to neglectful and abusive treatment, automatic diagnoses on this basis alone cannot be made, as children can form stable attachments and social relationships despite marked abuse and neglect. However, the instances of that ability are rare.

The name of the disorder emphasizes problems with attachment but the criteria include symptoms such as failure to thrive, a lack of developmentally appropriate social responsiveness, apathy, and onset before 8 months.

===Assessment tools===
There is as yet no universally accepted diagnostic protocol for reactive attachment disorder. Often a range of measures are used in research and diagnosis. Recognized assessment methods of attachment styles, difficulties or disorders include the Strange Situation Procedure (devised by developmental psychologist Mary Ainsworth), the separation and reunion procedure and the Preschool Assessment of Attachment, the Observational Record of the Caregiving Environment, the Attachment Q-sort and a variety of narrative techniques using stem stories, puppets or pictures. For older children, actual interviews such as the Child Attachment Interview and the Autobiographical Emotional Events Dialogue can be used. Caregivers may also be assessed using procedures such as the Working Model of the Child Interview.

More recent research also uses the Disturbances of Attachment Interview (DAI) developed by Smyke and Zeanah (1999). The DAI is a semi-structured interview designed to be administered by clinicians to caregivers. It covers 12 items, namely &quot;having a discriminated, preferred adult&quot;, &quot;seeking comfort when distressed&quot;, &quot;responding to comfort when offered&quot;, &quot;social and emotional reciprocity&quot;, &quot;emotional regulation&quot;, &quot;checking back after venturing away from the care giver&quot;, &quot;reticence with unfamiliar adults&quot;, &quot;willingness to go off with relative strangers&quot;, &quot;self-endangering behavior&quot;, &quot;excessive clinging&quot;, &quot;vigilance/hypercompliance&quot; and &quot;role reversal&quot;. This method is designed to pick up not only RAD but also the proposed new alternative categories of disorders of attachment.

==Causes==
Although increasing numbers of childhood mental health problems are being attributed to genetic defects, reactive attachment disorder is by definition based on a problematic history of care and social relationships. Abuse can occur alongside the required factors, but on its own does not explain attachment disorder. It has been suggested that types of temperament, or constitutional response to the environment, may make some individuals susceptible to the stress of unpredictable or hostile relationships with caregivers in the early years. In the absence of available and responsive caregivers it appears that most children are particularly vulnerable to developing attachment disorders.

While similar abnormal parenting may produce the two distinct forms of the disorder, inhibited and disinhibited, studies show that abuse and neglect were far more prominent and severe in the cases of RAD, disinhibited type. The issue of temperament and its influence on the development of attachment disorders has yet to be resolved. RAD has never been reported in the absence of serious environmental adversity yet outcomes for children raised in the same environment are the same.

In discussing the neurobiological basis for attachment and trauma symptoms in a seven-year twin study, it has been suggested that the roots of various forms of psychopathology, including RAD, borderline personality disorder (BPD), and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), can be found in disturbances in affect regulation. The subsequent development of higher-order self-regulation is jeopardized and the formation of internal models is affected. Consequently, the &quot;templates&quot; in the mind that drive organized behavior in relationships may be impacted. The potential for &quot;re-regulation&quot; (modulation of emotional responses to within the normal range) in the presence of &quot;corrective&quot; experiences (normative caregiving) seems possible.

==Diagnosis==

RAD is one of the least researched and most poorly understood disorders in the DSM. There is little systematic epidemiologic information on RAD, its course is not well established and it appears difficult to diagnose accurately. There is a lack of clarity about the presentation of attachment disorders over the age of five years and difficulty in distinguishing between aspects of attachment disorders, disorganized attachment or the consequences of maltreatment.

According to the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (AACAP), children who exhibit signs of reactive attachment disorder need a comprehensive psychiatric assessment and individualized treatment plan. The signs or symptoms of RAD may also be found in other psychiatric disorders and AACAP advises against giving a child this label or diagnosis without a comprehensive evaluation. Their practice parameter states that the assessment of reactive attachment disorder requires evidence directly obtained from serial observations of the child interacting with their primary caregivers and history (as available) of the child&#x27;s patterns of attachment behavior with these caregivers. It also requires observations of the child&#x27;s behavior with unfamiliar adults and a comprehensive history of the child&#x27;s early caregiving environment including, for example, pediatricians, teachers, or caseworkers. In the US, initial evaluations may be conducted by psychologists, psychiatrists, Licensed Marriage and Family Therapists, Licensed Professional Counselors, specialist Licensed Clinical Social Workers or psychiatric nurses.

In the UK, the British Association for Adoption and Fostering (BAAF) advise that only a psychiatrist can diagnose an attachment disorder and that any assessment must include a comprehensive evaluation of the child&#x27;s individual and family history.

According to the AACAP Practice Parameter (2005) the question of whether attachment disorders can reliably be diagnosed in older children and adults has not been resolved. Attachment behaviors used for the diagnosis of RAD change markedly with development and defining analogous behaviors in older children is difficult. There are no substantially validated measures of attachment in middle childhood or early adolescence. Assessments of RAD past school age may not be possible at all as by this time children have developed along individual lines to such an extent that early attachment experiences are only one factor among many that determine emotion and behavior.

===Criteria===
ICD-10 describes reactive attachment disorder of childhood, known as RAD, and disinhibited attachment disorder, less well known as DAD. DSM-IV-TR also describes reactive attachment disorder of infancy or early childhood divided into two subtypes, inhibited type and disinhibited type, both known as RAD. The two classifications are similar and both include:
* markedly disturbed and developmentally inappropriate social relatedness in most contexts (e.g., the child is avoidant or unresponsive to care when offered by caregivers or is indiscriminately affectionate with strangers);
* the disturbance is not accounted for solely by developmental delay and does not meet the criteria for pervasive developmental disorder;
* onset before five years of age (there is no age specified before five years of age at which RAD cannot be diagnosed);
* a history of significant neglect;
* an implicit lack of identifiable, preferred attachment figure.

ICD-10 states in relation to the inhibited form only that the syndrome probably occurs as a direct result of severe parental neglect, abuse, or serious mishandling. DSM states in relation to both forms there must be a history of &quot;pathogenic care&quot; defined as persistent disregard of the child&#x27;s basic emotional or physical needs or repeated changes in primary caregiver that prevents the formation of a discriminatory or selective attachment that is presumed to account for the disorder. For this reason, part of the diagnosis is the child&#x27;s history of care rather than observation of symptoms.

In DSM-IV-TR the &quot;inhibited&quot; form is described as persistent failure to initiate or respond in a developmentally appropriate fashion to most social interactions, as manifest by excessively inhibited, hypervigilant, or highly ambivalent and contradictory responses (e.g., the child may respond to caregivers with a mixture of approach, avoidance, and resistance to comforting or may exhibit &quot;frozen watchfulness&quot;, hypervigilance while keeping an impassive and still demeanour). Such infants do not seek or accept comfort at times of threat, alarm or distress, thus failing to maintain &quot;proximity&quot;, an essential element of attachment behavior. The &quot;disinhibited&quot; form shows diffuse attachments as manifest by indiscriminate sociability with marked inability to exhibit appropriate selective attachments (e.g., excessive familiarity with relative strangers or lack of selectivity in choice of attachment figures). There is therefore a lack of &quot;specificity&quot; of attachment figure, the second basic element of attachment behavior.

The ICD-10 descriptions are comparable save that ICD-10 includes in its description several elements not included in DSM-IV-TR as follows:
* abuse, (psychological or physical), in addition to neglect;
* associated emotional disturbance;
* poor social interaction with peers, aggression towards self and others, misery, and growth failure in some cases (inhibited form only);
* evidence of capacity for social reciprocity and responsiveness as shown by elements of normal social relatedness in interactions with appropriately responsive, non-deviant adults (disinhibited form only).

The first of these is somewhat controversial, being a commission rather than omission and because abuse in and of itself does not lead to attachment disorder.

The inhibited form has a greater tendency to ameliorate with an appropriate caregiver, while the disinhibited form is more enduring. ICD-10 states the disinhibited form &quot;tends to persist despite marked changes in environmental circumstances&quot;. Disinhibited and inhibited are not opposites in terms of attachment disorder and can coexist in the same child. The question of whether there are two subtypes has been raised. The World Health Organization acknowledges that there is uncertainty regarding the diagnostic criteria and the appropriate subdivision. One reviewer has commented on the difficulty of clarifying the core characteristics of and differences between atypical attachment styles and ways of categorizing more severe disorders of attachment.

, the American Psychiatric Association has proposed to redefine RAD into two distinct disorders in the DSM-V. Corresponding with the inhibited type, one disorder will be reclassified as &quot;Reactive Attachment Disorder of Infancy and Early Childhood&quot;.

In regards to pathogenic care, or the type of care in which these behaviors are present, a new criterion for Disinhibited Social Engagement Disorder now includes chronically harsh punishment or other types of severely inept caregiving. Relating to pathogenic care for both proposed disorders, a new criterion is rearing in atypical environments such as institutions with high child/caregiver ratios that cut down on opportunities to form attachments with a caregiver.

===Differential diagnosis===
The diagnostic complexities of RAD mean that careful diagnostic evaluation by a trained mental health expert with particular expertise in differential diagnosis is considered essential. Several other disorders, such as conduct disorders, oppositional defiant disorder, anxiety disorders, post traumatic stress disorder and social phobia share many symptoms and are often comorbid with or confused with RAD, leading to over and under diagnosis. RAD can also be confused with neuropsychiatric disorders such as autism, pervasive developmental disorder, childhood schizophrenia and some genetic syndromes. Infants with this disorder can be distinguished from those with organic illness by their rapid physical improvement after hospitalization. Autistic children are likely to be of normal size and weight and often exhibit a degree of intellectual disability. They are unlikely to improve upon being removed from the home.

===Alternative diagnosis===
In the absence of a standardized diagnosis system, many popular, informal classification systems or checklists, outside the DSM and ICD, were created out of clinical and parental experience within the field known as attachment therapy. These lists are unvalidated and critics state they are inaccurate, too broadly defined or applied by unqualified persons. Many are found on the websites of attachment therapists. Common elements of these lists such as lying, lack of remorse or conscience and cruelty do not form part of the diagnostic criteria under either DSM-IV-TR or ICD-10. Many children are being diagnosed with RAD because of behavioral problems that are outside the criteria. There is an emphasis within attachment therapy on aggressive behavior as a symptom of what they describe as attachment disorder whereas mainstream theorists view these behaviors as comorbid, externalizing behaviors requiring appropriate assessment and treatment rather than attachment disorders. However, knowledge of attachment relationships can contribute to the cause, maintenance and treatment of externalizing disorders.

The Randolph Attachment Disorder Questionnaire or RADQ is one of the better known of these checklists and is used by attachment therapists and others. The checklist includes 93 discrete behaviours, many of which either overlap with other disorders, like conduct disorder and oppositional defiant disorder, or are not related to attachment difficulties. Critics assert that it is unvalidated and lacks specificity.

==Treatment==

Assessing the child&#x27;s safety is an essential first step that determines whether future intervention can take place in the family unit or whether the child should be removed to a safe situation. Interventions may include psychosocial support services for the family unit (including financial or domestic aid, housing and social work support), psychotherapeutic interventions (including treating parents for mental illness, family therapy, individual therapy), education (including training in basic parenting skills and child development), and monitoring of the child&#x27;s safety within the family environment

In 2005 the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry laid down guidelines (devised by N.W. Boris and C.H. Zeanah) based on its published parameters for the diagnosis and treatment of RAD. Recommendations in the guidelines include the following:
# &quot;The most important intervention for young children diagnosed with reactive attachment disorder and who lack an attachment to a discriminated caregiver is for the clinician to advocate for providing the child with an emotionally available attachment figure.&quot;
# &quot;Although the diagnosis of reactive attachment disorder is based on symptoms displayed by the child, assessing the caregiver&#x27;s attitudes toward and perceptions about the child is important for treatment selection.&quot;
# &quot;Children with reactive attachment disorder are presumed to have grossly disturbed internal models for relating to others. After ensuring that the child is in a safe and stable placement, effective attachment treatment must focus on creating positive interactions with caregivers.&quot;
# &quot;Children who meet criteria for reactive attachment disorder and who display aggressive and oppositional behavior require adjunctive (additional) treatments.&quot;

Mainstream prevention programs and treatment approaches for attachment difficulties or disorders for infants and younger children are based on attachment theory and concentrate on increasing the responsiveness and sensitivity of the caregiver, or if that is not possible, placing the child with a different caregiver. These approaches are mostly in the process of being evaluated. The programs invariably include a detailed assessment of the attachment status or caregiving responses of the adult caregiver as attachment is a two-way process involving attachment behavior and caregiver response. Some of these treatment or prevention programs are specifically aimed at foster carers rather than parents, as the attachment behaviors of infants or children with attachment difficulties often do not elicit appropriate caregiver responses. Approaches include &quot;Watch, wait and wonder,&quot; manipulation of sensitive responsiveness, modified &quot;Interaction Guidance&quot;, &quot;Clinician-Assisted Videofeedback Exposure Sessions (CAVES)&quot;, &quot;Preschool Parent Psychotherapy&quot;, &quot;Circle of Security&quot;, &quot;Attachment and Biobehavioral Catch-up&quot; (ABC), the New Orleans Intervention, and parent–child psychotherapy. Other treatment methods include Developmental, Individual-difference, and Relationship-based therapy (DIR, also referred to as Floor Time) by Stanley Greenspan, although DIR is primarily directed to treatment of pervasive developmental disorders.

The relevance of these approaches to intervention with fostered and adopted children with RAD or older children with significant histories of maltreatment is unclear.

===Attachment therapy===
The terms attachment disorder, attachment problems, and attachment therapy, although increasingly used, have no clear, specific, or consensus definitions. However, the terms and therapies often are applied to children who are maltreated, particularly those in the foster care, kinship care, or adoption systems, and related populations such as children adopted internationally from orphanages.

Outside the mainstream programs is a form of treatment generally known as attachment therapy, a subset of techniques (and accompanying novel diagnosis) for supposed attachment disorders including RAD. These &quot;attachment disorders&quot; use diagnostic criteria or symptom lists different from criteria under ICD-10 or DSM-IV-TR, or to attachment behaviors. Those with &quot;attachment disorder&quot; are said to lack empathy and remorse.

Treatments of this pseudoscientific disorder are called &quot;Attachment therapy&quot;. In general, these therapies are aimed at adopted or fostered children with a view to creating attachment in these children to their new caregivers. The theoretical base is broadly a combination of regression and catharsis, accompanied by parenting methods which emphasize obedience and parental control. There is considerable criticism of this form of treatment and diagnosis as it is largely unvalidated and has developed outside the scientific mainstream. There is little or no evidence base and techniques vary from non-coercive therapeutic work to more extreme forms of physical, confrontational and coercive techniques, of which the best known are holding therapy, rebirthing, rage-reduction and the Evergreen model. These forms of the therapy may well involve physical restraint, the deliberate provocation of rage and anger in the child by physical and verbal means including deep tissue massage, aversive tickling, enforced eye contact and verbal confrontation, and being pushed to revisit earlier trauma. Critics maintain that these therapies are not within the attachment paradigm, are potentially abusive, and are to attachment theory. The APSAC Taskforce Report of 2006 notes that many of these therapies concentrate on changing the child rather than the caregiver. Children may be described as &quot;RADs&quot;, &quot;Radkids&quot; or &quot;Radishes&quot; and dire predictions may be made as to their supposedly violent futures if they are not treated with attachment therapy. The Mayo Clinic, a well known U.S. non-profit medical practice and medical research group, cautions against consulting with mental health providers who promote these types of methods and offer evidence to support their techniques; to date, this evidence base is not published within reputable medical or mental health journals.

==Prognosis==
The AACAP guidelines state that children with reactive attachment disorder are presumed to have grossly disturbed internal models for relating to others. However, the course of RAD is not well studied and there have been few efforts to examine symptom patterns over time. The few existing longitudinal studies (dealing with developmental change with age over a period of time) involve only children from poorly run Eastern European institutions.

Findings from the studies of children from Eastern European orphanages indicate that persistence of the inhibited pattern of RAD is rare in children adopted out of institutions into normative care-giving environments. However, there is a close association between duration of deprivation and severity of attachment disorder behaviors. The quality of attachments that these children form with subsequent care-givers may be compromised, but they probably no longer meet criteria for inhibited RAD. The same group of studies suggests that a minority of adopted, institutionalized children exhibit persistent indiscriminate sociability even after more normative caregiving environments are provided. Indiscriminate sociability may persist for years, even among children who subsequently exhibit preferred attachment to their new caregivers. Some exhibit hyperactivity and attention problems as well as difficulties in peer relationships. In the only longitudinal study that has followed children with indiscriminate behavior into adolescence, these children were significantly more likely to exhibit poor peer relationships.

Studies of children who were reared in institutions have suggested that they are inattentive and overactive, no matter what quality of care they received. In one investigation, some institution-reared boys were reported to be inattentive, overactive, and markedly unselective in their social relationships, while girls, foster-reared children, and some institution-reared children were not. It is not yet clear whether these behaviors should be considered as part of disordered attachment.

There is one case study on maltreated twins published in 1999 with a follow-up in 2006. This study assessed the twins between the ages of 19 and 36 months, during which time they had multiple moves and placements. The paper explores the similarities, differences and comorbidity of RAD, disorganized attachment and post traumatic stress disorder. The girl showed signs of the inhibited form of RAD while the boy showed signs of the indiscriminate form. It was noted that the diagnosis of RAD ameliorated with better care but symptoms of post traumatic stress disorder and signs of disorganized attachment came and went as the infants progressed through multiple placement changes. At age three, some lasting relationship disturbance was evident.

In the follow-up case study when the twins were aged three and eight years, the lack of longitudinal research on maltreated as opposed to institutionalized children was again highlighted. The girl&#x27;s symptoms of disorganized attachment had developed into controlling behaviors—a well-documented outcome. The boy still exhibited self-endangering behaviors, not within RAD criteria but possibly within &quot;secure base distortion&quot;, (where the child has a preferred familiar caregiver, but the relationship is such that the child cannot use the adult for safety while gradually exploring the environment). At age eight the children were assessed with a variety of measures including those designed to access representational systems, or the child&#x27;s &quot;internal working models&quot;. The twins&#x27; symptoms were indicative of different trajectories. The girl showed externalizing symptoms (particularly deceit), contradictory reports of current functioning, chaotic personal narratives, struggles with friendships, and emotional disengagement with her caregiver, resulting in a clinical picture described as &quot;quite concerning&quot;. The boy still evidenced self-endangering behaviors as well as avoidance in relationships and emotional expression, separation anxiety and impulsivity and attention difficulties. It was apparent that life stressors had impacted each child differently. The narrative measures used were considered helpful in tracking how early attachment disruption is associated with later expectations about relationships.

One paper using questionnaires found that children aged three to six, diagnosed with RAD, scored lower on empathy but higher on self-monitoring (regulating your behavior to &quot;look good&quot;). These differences were especially pronounced based on ratings by parents, and suggested that children with RAD may systematically report their personality traits in overly positive ways. Their scores also indicated considerably more behavioral problems than scores of the control children.

==Epidemiology==
Epidemiological data are limited, but reactive attachment disorder appears to be very uncommon. The prevalence of RAD is unclear but it is probably quite rare, other than in populations of children being reared in the most extreme, deprived settings such as some orphanages. There is little systematically gathered epidemiologic information on RAD. A cohort study of 211 Copenhagen children to the age of 18 months found a prevalence of 0.9%.

Attachment disorders tend to occur in a definable set of contexts such as within some types of institutions, in the presence of repeated changes of primary caregiver or of extremely neglectful identifiable primary caregivers who show persistent disregard for the child&#x27;s basic attachment needs, but not all children raised in these conditions develop an attachment disorder. Studies undertaken on children from Eastern European orphanages from the mid-1990s showed significantly higher levels of both forms of RAD and of insecure patterns of attachment in the institutionalized children, regardless of how long they had been there. It would appear that children in institutions like these are unable to form selective attachments to their caregivers. The difference between the institutionalized children and the control group had lessened in the follow-up study three years later, although the institutionalized children continued to show significantly higher levels of indiscriminate friendliness. However, even among children raised in the most deprived institutional conditions the majority did not show symptoms of this disorder.

A 2002 study of children in residential nurseries in Bucharest, in which the DAI was used, challenged the current DSM and ICD conceptualizations of disordered attachment and showed that inhibited and disinhibited disorders could coexist in the same child.

There are two studies on the incidence of RAD relating to high risk and maltreated children in the U.S. Both used ICD, DSM and the DAI. The first, in 2004, reported that children from the maltreatment sample were significantly more likely to meet criteria for one or more attachment disorders than children from the other groups, however this was mainly the proposed new classification of disrupted attachment disorder rather than the DSM or ICD classified RAD or DAD. The second study, also in 2004, attempted to ascertain the prevalence of RAD and whether it could be reliably identified in &quot;maltreated&quot; rather than &quot;neglected&quot; toddlers. Of the 94 maltreated toddlers in foster care, 35% were identified as having ICD RAD and 22% as having ICD DAD, and 38% fulfilled the DSM criteria for RAD. This study found that RAD could be reliably identified and also that the inhibited and disinhibited forms were not independent. However, there are some methodological concerns with this study. A number of the children identified as fulfilling the criteria for RAD did in fact have a preferred attachment figure.

It has been suggested by some within the field of attachment therapy that RAD may be quite prevalent because severe child maltreatment, which is known to increase risk for RAD, is prevalent and because children who are severely abused may exhibit behaviors similar to RAD behaviors. The APSAC Taskforce consider this inference to be flawed and questionable. Severely abused children may exhibit similar behaviors to RAD behaviors but there are several far more common and demonstrably treatable diagnoses which may better account for these difficulties. Further, many children experience severe maltreatment and do not develop clinical disorders. Resilience is a common and normal human characteristic. RAD does not underlie all or even most of the behavioral and emotional problems seen in foster children, adoptive children, or children who are maltreated and rates of child abuse and/or neglect or problem behaviors are not a benchmark for estimates of RAD.

There are few data on comorbid conditions, but there are some conditions that arise in the same circumstances in which RAD arises, such as institutionalization or maltreatment. These are principally developmental delays and language disorders associated with neglect. Conduct disorders, oppositional defiant disorder, anxiety disorders, post-traumatic stress disorder and social phobia share many symptoms and are often comorbid with or confused with RAD. Attachment disorder behaviors amongst institutionalized children are correlated with attentional and conduct problems and cognitive levels but nonetheless appear to index a distinct set of symptoms and behaviors.

==History==

Reactive attachment disorder first made its appearance in standard nosologies of psychological disorders in DSM-III, 1980, following an accumulation of evidence on institutionalized children. The criteria included a requirement of onset before the age of 8 months and was equated with failure to thrive. Both these features were dropped in DSM-III-R, 1987. Instead, onset was changed to being within the first 5 years of life and the disorder itself was divided into two subcategories, inhibited and disinhibited. These changes resulted from further research on maltreated and institutionalized children and remain in the current version, DSM-IV, 1994, and its 2000 text revision, DSM-IV-TR, as well as in ICD-10, 1992. Both nosologies focus on young children who are not merely at increased risk for subsequent disorders but are already exhibiting clinical disturbance.

The broad theoretical framework for current versions of RAD is attachment theory, based on work conducted from the 1940s to the 1980s by John Bowlby, Mary Ainsworth and René Spitz. Attachment theory is a framework that employs psychological, ethological and evolutionary concepts to explain social behaviors typical of young children. Attachment theory focuses on the tendency of infants or children to &quot;seek proximity&quot; to a &quot;particular attachment figure&quot; (familiar caregiver), in situations of alarm or distress, behavior which appears to have survival value. This is known as a discriminatory or selective attachment. Subsequently, the child begins to use the caregiver as a base of security from which to explore the environment, returning periodically to the familiar person. Attachment is not the same as love and/or affection although they are often associated. Attachment and attachment behaviors tend to develop between the ages of six months and three years. Infants become attached to adults who are sensitive and responsive in social interactions with the infant, and who remain as consistent caregivers for some time. Caregiver responses lead to the development of patterns of attachment, that in turn lead to internal working models which will guide the individual&#x27;s feelings, thoughts, and expectations in later relationships. For a diagnosis of reactive attachment disorder, the child&#x27;s history and atypical social behavior must suggest the absence of formation of a discriminatory or selective attachment.

The pathological absence of a discriminatory or selective attachment needs to be differentiated from the existence of attachments with either typical or somewhat atypical behavior patterns, known as &quot;styles&quot; or &quot;patterns&quot;. There are four attachment styles ascertained and used within developmental attachment research. These are known as &quot;secure&quot;, &quot;anxious-ambivalent&quot;, &quot;anxious-avoidant&quot;, (all &quot;organized&quot;) and &quot;disorganized&quot;. The latter three are characterised as &quot;insecure&quot;. These are assessed using the Strange Situation Procedure, designed to assess the quality of attachments rather than whether an attachment exists at all.

A securely attached toddler will explore freely while the caregiver is present, engage with strangers, be visibly upset when the caregiver departs, and happy to see the caregiver return. The anxious-ambivalent toddler is anxious of exploration, extremely distressed when the caregiver departs but ambivalent when the caregiver returns. The anxious-avoidant toddler will not explore much, avoid or ignore the parent—showing little emotion when the parent departs or returns—and treat strangers much the same as caregivers with little emotional range shown. The disorganized/disoriented toddler shows a lack of a coherent style or pattern for coping. Evidence suggests this occurs when the caregiving figure is also an object of fear, thus putting the child in an irresolvable situation regarding approach and avoidance. On reunion with the caregiver, these children can look dazed or frightened, freezing in place, backing toward the caregiver or approaching with head sharply averted, or showing other behaviors implying fear of the person who is being sought. It is thought to represent a breakdown of an inchoate attachment strategy and it appears to affect the capacity to regulate emotions.

Although there are a wide range of attachment difficulties within the styles which may result in emotional disturbance and increase the risk of later psychopathologies, particularly the disorganized style, none of the styles constitute a disorder in themselves and none equate to criteria for RAD as such. A disorder in the clinical sense is a condition requiring treatment, as opposed to risk factors for subsequent disorders. Reactive attachment disorder denotes a lack of typical attachment behaviors rather than an attachment style, however problematic that style may be, in that there is an unusual lack of discrimination between familiar and unfamiliar people in both forms of the disorder. Such discrimination does exist as a feature of the social behavior of children with atypical attachment styles. Both DSM-IV and ICD-10 depict the disorder in terms of socially aberrant behavior in general rather than focusing more specifically on attachment behaviors as such. DSM-IV emphasizes a failure to initiate or respond to social interactions across a range of relationships and ICD-10 similarly focuses on contradictory or ambivalent social responses that extend across social situations. The relationship between patterns of attachment in the Strange Situation and RAD is not yet clear.

There is a lack of consensus about the precise meaning of the term &quot;attachment disorder&quot;. The term is frequently used both as an alternative to reactive attachment disorder and in discussions about different proposed classifications for disorders of attachment beyond the limitations of the ICD and DSM classifications. It is also used within the field of attachment therapy, as is the term reactive attachment disorder, to describe a range of problematic behaviors not within the ICD or DSM criteria or not related directly to attachment styles or difficulties at all.

==Research==
Research from the late 1990s indicated there were disorders of attachment not captured by DSM or ICD and showed that RAD could be diagnosed reliably without evidence of pathogenic care, thus illustrating some of the conceptual difficulties with the rigid structure of the current definition of RAD. Research published in 2004 showed that the disinhibited form can endure alongside structured attachment behavior (of any style) towards the child&#x27;s permanent caregivers.

Some authors have proposed a broader continuum of definitions of attachment disorders ranging from RAD through various attachment difficulties to the more problematic attachment styles. There is as yet no consensus, on this issue but a new set of practice parameters containing three categories of attachment disorder has been proposed by C.H. Zeanah and N. Boris. The first of these is &quot;disorder of attachment,&quot; in which a young child has no preferred adult caregiver. The proposed category of disordered attachment is parallel to RAD in its inhibited and disinhibited forms, as defined in DSM and ICD. The second category is &quot;secure base distortion&quot;, where the child has a preferred familiar caregiver, but the relationship is such that the child cannot use the adult for safety while gradually exploring the environment. Such children may endanger themselves, cling to the adult, be excessively compliant, or show role reversals in which they care for or punish the adult. The third type is &quot;disrupted attachment&quot;. Disrupted attachment is not covered under ICD-10 and DSM criteria, and results from an abrupt separation or loss of a familiar caregiver to whom attachment has developed. This form of categorisation may demonstrate more clinical accuracy overall than the current DSM-IV-TR classification, but further research is required. The practice parameters would also provide the framework for a diagnostic protocol. Most recently, Daniel Schechter and Erica Willheim have shown a relationship between some maternal violence-related posttraumatic stress disorder and secure base distortion (see above) which is characterized by child recklessness, separation anxiety, hypervigilance, and role-reversal.

Some research indicates there may be a significant overlap between behaviors of the inhibited form of RAD or DAD and aspects of disorganized attachment where there is an identified attachment figure.

An ongoing question is whether RAD should be thought of as a disorder of the child&#x27;s personality or a distortion of the relationship between the child and a specific other person. It has been noted that as attachment disorders are by their very nature relational disorders, they do not fit comfortably into nosologies that characterize the disorder as centered on the person. Work by C.H. Zeanah indicates that atypical attachment-related behaviors may occur with one caregiver but not with another. This is similar to the situation reported for attachment styles, in which a particular parent&#x27;s frightened expression has been considered as possibly responsible for disorganized/disoriented reunion behavior during the Strange Situation Procedure.

The draft of the proposed DSM-V suggests dividing RAD into two disorders, Reactive Attachment Disorder for the current inhibited form of RAD, and Disinhibited Social Engagement Disorder for what is currently the disinhibited form of RAD, with some alterations in the proposed DSM definition.

<text>The ashy-headed goose (Chloephaga poliocephala) is a species of waterfowl in tribe Tadornini of subfamily Anserinae. It is found in Argentina and Chile.

==Taxonomy and systematics==

The ashy-headed goose is monotypic.

==Description==

The ashy-headed goose is long. Males weigh and females . Adults have the same plumage. Their heads and necks are gray, their upper back and breast chestnut with fine barring, their flanks barred black and white, and their belly white. In flight their blackish wings show bold white leading and trailing patches and a metallic green speculum. Their bill is black and the legs and feet orange with black markings. Juveniles&#x27; rufous areas are much duller, their back and breast barring stronger, and their speculum dark brownish.

==Distribution and habitat==

The ashy-headed goose is a bird of South America&#x27;s southern cone from central Chile and Buenos Aires Province, Argentina, south into Tierra del Fuego. It also occurs as vagrant on the Falkland Islands and has bred there. In summer it primarily inhabits clearings in damp forests of southern beech (&quot;Nothofagus&quot; sp.) around lakes and marshes, on inland islands, near the coast, and on higher ground. In winter it favors meadows and pastures.

==Behavior==
===Movement===

The ashy-headed goose nests south of 37° south latitude in Chile and western Argentina. In winter much of the population moves further north in Chile and onto the Argentinian Pampas.

===Feeding===

The ashy-headed goose is almost entirely vegetarian. A study of its diet on its wintering grounds in Argentina showed it feeding mainly in harvested fields of wheat, maize, sunflower, and sorghum. One in the austral summer in Tierra del Fuego showed a diet there of leaves and fleshy fruits. Red crowberry (&quot;Empetrum rubrum&quot;) was the dominant fruit.

===Breeding===

The ashy-headed goose&#x27;s breeding season begins in October to November and in some areas lasts to March. It nests singly or in small loose groups. Nests are placed in a tree hollow, on a stump, or in long grass, and are lined with down. The clutch size is four to six eggs. Males guard females during the incubation period of about 30 days. The time to fledging is not known.

===Vocalization===

Male and female ashy-headed geese have different vocalizations: Males make &quot;soft, wigeon-like whistles&quot; and females &quot;harsh cackling notes&quot;.

==Status==

The IUCN has assessed the ashy-headed goose as being of Least Concern. It has a large range, and though its population size is unknown it is believed to be stable. No immediate threats have been identified. Winter surveys in northeastern Argentina estimated that as many as 150,000 may be there. The species is &quot;[r]elatively free from human persecution at [the] breeding grounds&quot; but in winter is persecuted by farmers who view it as a competitor to their livestock.

<doc id="740205" wikidata="Q1069772" url="?curid=740205" title="Chinese guardian lions">
<text>Chinese guardian lions, or imperial guardian lions, are a traditional Chinese architectural ornament. Typically made of stone, they are also known as stone lions or shishi (). They are known in colloquial English as lion dogs or foo dogs / fu dogs. The concept, which originated and became popular in Chinese Buddhism, features a pair of Asiatic lions—often one male with a ball which represents the material elements and one female with a cub which represents the element of spirit— that were thought to protect the building from harmful spiritual influences and harmful people that might be a threat. Used in imperial Chinese palaces and tombs, the lions subsequently spread to other parts of Asia including Japan (see komainu), Korea, Mongolia, the Philippines, Tibet, Thailand, Myanmar, Vietnam, Sri Lanka, India, Nepal, Cambodia, Laos, Singapore, and Malaysia.

== Description ==
Statues of guardian lions have traditionally stood in front of Chinese Imperial palaces, Imperial tombs, government offices, temples, and the homes of government officials and the wealthy, and were believed to have powerful mythic protective benefits. They are also used in other artistic contexts, for example on door-knockers, and in pottery. Pairs of guardian lion statues are still common and symbolic elements at the entrances to restaurants, hotels, supermarkets and other structures, with one sitting on each side of the entrance, in China and in other places around the world where the Chinese people have immigrated and settled, especially in local Chinatowns.

The lions are usually depicted in pairs. When used as statuary the pair would consist of a male leaning his paw upon an embroidered ball (in imperial contexts, representing supremacy over the world) and a female restraining a playful cub that is on its back (representing nurture).

== Etymology ==
Guardian lions are referred to in various ways depending on language and context. In Chinese, they are traditionally called simply &quot;shi&quot; () meaning lion—the word &quot;shi&quot; itself is thought to be derived from the Persian word &quot;šer&quot;. Lions were first presented to the Han court by emissaries from Central Asia and Persia, and were already popularly depicted as guardian figures by the sixth century AD. Today, the guardian lions are more usually specified by reference to the medium or material, for example:
* &quot;Stone lion&quot; (): for a stone sculpture; or
* &quot;Bronze lion&quot; (): for a bronze sculpture.

and less commonly:
* &quot;Auspicious lion&quot; (): referring to the Tibetan Snow Lion or good fortune.

=== In other Asian cultures ===
* In Cambodia: known as &quot;Singha&quot; or &quot;Sing&quot; ()
* In India: known as &quot;Sher&quot;, &quot;Singha&quot;, or &quot;Chinggam&quot; (, , or )
* In Japan: the lion figures are known as &quot;Shishi&quot; (, lion) or &quot;Komainu&quot; (, Korean dog)
* In Korea: known as &quot;Sanye&quot; (狻猊)
* In Myanmar and Laos: known as &quot;Chinthe,&quot; the namesake of the World War II Chindit soldiers
* In Okinawa: known as &quot;Shisa&quot;
* In Sri Lanka: known as &quot;Singha&quot; ()
* In Thailand: known as &quot;Singha&quot; or &quot;s̄ingh̄̒&quot; ()
* In Tibet: known as a &quot;Snow Lion&quot; or &quot;Gangs-seng-ge&quot; (གངས་སེང་གེ་)
* In Vietnam: known as &quot;&quot;

=== Western names ===
In English and several Western languages, the guardian lions have often been referred by a multitude of names such as: &quot;Fu Dogs&quot;, &quot;Foo Dogs&quot;, &quot;Fu Lions&quot;, &quot;Fo Lions&quot;, and &quot;Lion Dogs&quot;. The term &quot;&quot;Fo&quot; or &quot;Fu&quot;&quot; may be transliterations to the words () or (), which means &quot;Buddha&quot; or &quot;prosperity&quot; in Chinese, respectively. However, Chinese reference to the guardian lions are seldom prefixed with or , and more importantly never referred to as &quot;dogs&quot;.

Reference to guardian lions as dogs in Western cultures may be due to the Japanese reference to them as &quot;Korean dogs&quot; () due to their transmission from China through Korea into Japan. It may also be due to the misidentification of the guardian lion figures as representing certain Chinese dog breeds such as the Chow Chow () or Pekingese ().

== Appearance ==
The lions are traditionally carved from decorative stone, such as marble or granite, or cast in bronze or iron. Because of the high cost of these materials and the labor required to produce them, private use of guardian lions was traditionally reserved for wealthy or elite families. Indeed, a traditional symbol of a family&#x27;s wealth or social status was the placement of guardian lions in front of the family home. However, in modern times less expensive lions, mass-produced in concrete and resin, have become available and their use is therefore no longer restricted to the elite.

The lions are always presented in pairs, a manifestation of yin and yang, the female representing yin and the male yang. The male lion has his right front paw on a type of cloth ball simply called an &quot;embroidered ball&quot; (), which is sometimes carved with a geometric pattern. The female is essentially identical, but has a cub under the left paw, representing the cycle of life. Symbolically, the female lion protects those dwelling inside (the living soul within), while the male guards the structure (the external material elements). Sometimes the female has her mouth closed, and the male open. This symbolizes the enunciation of the sacred word &quot;om&quot;. However, Japanese adaptations state that the male is inhaling, representing life, while the female exhales, representing death. Other styles have both lions with a single large pearl in each of their partially opened mouths. The pearl is carved so that it can roll about in the lion&#x27;s mouth but sized just large enough so that it can never be removed.

According to feng shui, correct placement of the lions is important to ensure their beneficial effect. When looking at the entrance from outside the building, facing the lions, the male lion with the ball is on the right, and the female with the cub is on the left. For Hindu and Buddhist temples in South Asia, the Vastu Shastra (the South Asian equivalent to Feng Shui) advises lion guardian statues to be placed at the entrance of temples to protect the sacred space from negative entities. These can be most prominently found in the Indian states of Tamil Nadu, Odisha, West Bengal, and Manipur. Each region has its distinctive style which the &quot;Samaragana Sutradhara&quot; categorizes into four types. Temple lions are sometimes depicted with a foot placed on top of a crouching elephant, or occasionally with the head of an elephant (&quot;gajasimha&quot;). 

Chinese lions are intended to reflect the emotion of the animal as opposed to the reality of the lion. This is in distinct opposition to the traditional English lion which is a lifelike depiction of the animal. The claws, teeth and eyes of the Chinese lion represent power. Few if any muscles are visible in the Chinese lion whereas the English lion shows its power through its life-like characteristics rather than through stylized representation.

== History ==
Asiatic lions are believed to be the ones depicted by the guardian lions in Chinese culture.

With increased trade during the Han dynasty and cultural exchanges through the Silk Road, lions were introduced into China from the ancient states of Central Asia by peoples of Sogdiana, Samarkand, and the Yuezhi () in the form of pelts and live tribute, along with stories about them from Buddhist priests and travelers of the time.

Several instances of lions as imperial tributes from Central Asia were recorded in the document &quot;Book of the Later Han&quot; () written from 25 to 220 CE. On one particular event, on the eleventh lunar month of 87 CE, &quot;... an envoy from Parthia offered as tribute a lion and an ostrich&quot; to the Han court. Indeed, the lion was associated by the Han Chinese to earlier venerated creatures of the ancient Chinese, most notably by the monk Huilin () who stated that &quot;the mythic suan-ni () is actually the lion, coming from the Western Regions&quot; ().

There are various styles of guardian lions reflecting influences from different time periods, imperial dynasties, and regions of China. These styles vary in their artistic detail and adornment as well as in the depiction of the lions from fierce to serene.

Although the form of the Chinese guardian lion was quite varied during its early history in China, the appearance, pose, and accessories of the lions eventually became standardized and formalized during the Ming and Qing dynasties into more or less its present form.

<text>Whitman&#x27;s is one of the largest and oldest brands of boxed chocolates in the United States. Whitman&#x27;s confections have been produced since 1842, originally by Stephen Whitman in Philadelphia and currently by Kansas City, Missouri-based Russell Stover Candies.

==History==
Whitman&#x27;s confections have been produced for over 175 years. Originally a &quot;confectionery and fruiterer shoppe&quot; set up in 1842 by 19-year-old Stephen F. Whitman on the Philadelphia waterfront, Whitman&#x27;s first became popular with traveling sailors and their wives. They would often bring imported fruits, nuts, and cocoa which were obtained during their voyages to Mr. Whitman so that he could make the popular European confections people craved in that era. Before long, Whitman&#x27;s chocolates were popular throughout the northeastern United States. Whitman&#x27;s produced the first pre-packaged candy in 1854—a box of sugar plums adorned with curlicues and rosebuds. Whitman&#x27;s began advertising in newspapers, shortly before the beginning of the Civil War, and the business grew so large, that in 1866, the company occupied an entire building at 12th and Market Streets in Philadelphia. In 1877, he introduced Instantaneous Chocolates in tin boxes, that became much-admired. Whitman&#x27;s later became Stephen F. Whitman &amp; Son, Inc. Whitman&#x27;s introduced the Whitman&#x27;s Sampler in 1912, becoming the first use of cellophane by the candy industry. In 1915, the messenger boy was added to the Whitman&#x27;s Sampler box, and became a symbol of quality. In 1946, the company helped General Electric develop a refrigerated display case to guard the product against warmer temperatures and extend the selling season through the summer months.

In the early 1960s, Whitman&#x27;s was purchased by Pet, Inc., a manufacturer of evaporated milk as part of the company&#x27;s attempt to become a food products conglomerate. Pet was taken over in 1978 by IC Industries (a holding company for the Illinois Central Railroad&#x27;s non-rail assets), which eventually decided to focus on food and in 1988 took the name Whitman Corporation after the spinoff of some non-food operations because Whitman&#x27;s was its best-known brand name. However, in 1991, Pet (including Whitman) was again spun off as the parent company decided to narrow its focus further (eventually becoming PepsiAmericas).
In 1993, Pet sold the Whitman&#x27;s brand to Russell Stover Candies, the major supplier of boxed candy in the United States. In July 2014, Russell Stover was acquired by the international company Lindt &amp; Sprüngli. In 1984, Whitman&#x27;s introduced its light chocolate. In 1987, Whitman&#x27;s celebrated its 75th anniversary, and the Whitman&#x27;s Sampler box had gained a new look. In 1991, the Smithsonian Institution acquired the Whitman&#x27;s Chocolates Collection of print advertisements. In 1994, Whitman&#x27;s teamed up with Peanuts characters to introduce its Peanuts-themed Whitman&#x27;s products.

==Whitman&#x27;s Sampler==
The online Russell Stover history states that the Whitman&#x27;s Sampler was introduced in 1912, and by 1915 it was the most popular of Whitman&#x27;s line of candy. Also in 1915 the Messenger Boy molded chocolate piece was added to the assortment. During World War II, servicemen and women who got a Whitman&#x27;s Sampler from family and friends spread the word about it once they returned home. Over the decades, it reached a level in American pop culture in that it was mentioned in many TV shows, movies, and the like. The stitching design of the package was inspired by grandma&#x27;s needlework. The package of the box resembles the folk art sampler needlework of a bird on a branch, Pegasus, basket of flowers, rocking horse, rocking elephant, plants, rooster, dog, sailboat, tree, house, and a bear, hence the double entendre name of the product. It was the first box of chocolates to come equipped with an index of all the varieties of the sampler printed under the lid. Early designs of the package had &quot;Whitman&#x27;s Sampler Chocolates &amp; Confections Started in 1842&quot; written on it. The Sampler&#x27;s contents vary from box to box, but generally contain milk and dark chocolate-covered caramel, coconut, molasses chew, chocolate-covered peanuts, almonds, cashews, clusters, cherry cordial, maple fudge, chocolate-covered toffee, and nougaty chocolate whipped candies. Seasonal flavors like strawberry cream, pumpkin marshmallow, and mint chocolate patties are occasionally included. The candies&#x27; flavors can be determined by their shapes: a square shape denotes caramels; a rectangle means nougat filling; oval chocolates typically contain fudge; the soft-centered flavors, including cherry cordials, are round; and nut clusters are easily identified by their rough surfaces. Newer samplers may no longer follow this precise format.

== In popular culture ==
* In the early 20th century, Pickaninny Peppermints were a popular Whitman confection. However, the NAACP lawyer and future Supreme Court Justice Thurgood Marshall took issue with the name. In a 1941 article directed at Whitman&#x27;s published in the &quot;Afro-American&quot;, Marshall urged Whitman&#x27;s Candies to realize its racial insensitivity. Whitman&#x27;s denied that the term &quot;pickaninny&quot; was racist and responded to Marshall by saying that it meant &quot;cute colored kid&quot;. The product was soon dropped.
* The candy was featured in Issue 32 of &quot;The Vault of Horror&quot; in the story, &quot;Ample Sample&quot;.
* The company has maintained a longstanding tradition of supporting American servicemen and servicewomen during wartime. During World War I, millions of tins were shipped to American soldiers throughout the world. During World War II, women at the Whitman&#x27;s production line secretly slipped handwritten notes of encouragement into candy boxes to help soothe soldiers&#x27; homesickness.
* The G4 spinoff of &quot;The Soup&quot; called &quot;Web Soup&quot; spoofs the Whitman&#x27;s Sampler package with a segment called Mixed Nuts Sampler.
* Wacky Packages parodied the Whitman&#x27;s Sampler brand as &quot;What Man&#x27;s Simple Candy&quot;.
* Whitman&#x27;s Sampler was mentioned by Mama Harper in the sitcom &quot;Mama&#x27;s Family&quot; in the episode &quot;Birthright&quot;, which first aired on January 31, 1987.
* A Whitman&#x27;s Sampler box appears anachronistically in the film &quot;Kid Blue&quot; (1973), which is set in 1900.
* In the first episode of season 5 of &quot;The Sopranos&quot;, title character Tony Soprano offers a Whitman&#x27;s Sampler by way of sarcastic apology to associate Johnny Sack: &quot;What do you want an apology? A fucking Whitman&#x27;s Sampler?&quot;
* In the episode &quot;The Stall&quot; of Seinfeld, George brings a Whitman&#x27;s Sampler to Elaine&#x27;s boyfriend Tony to apologize for injuring him while rock climbing. While Tony declines George&#x27;s apology, he eagerly accepts the Whitman&#x27;s Sampler.
* In the TV movie The Night Stalker (1972 film), reporter Carl Kolchak bribes Clark County Courthouse chief switchboard operator Helen O’Brien with a Whitman’s Sampler box in exchange for DMV information on the film’s murder suspect. The name brand on the box is surreptitiously covered with stick-on paper roses.

<text>To Heart is a Japanese romance eroge visual novel developed by Leaf and released on May 23, 1997 for Windows. It was later ported to the PlayStation and given voice acting. A second PC version, titled &quot;To Heart PSE&quot; was released containing the PlayStation version as well as bonus games. &quot;To Heart PSE&quot; and the PlayStation version had the more intimate scenes removed. &quot;To Heart&quot; is Leaf&#x27;s fifth game, and the third title in the Leaf Visual Novel Series, following &quot;Shizuku&quot; and &quot;Kizuato&quot; and preceding &quot;Routes&quot;. The gameplay in &quot;To Heart&quot; follows a plot line which offers predetermined scenarios with courses of interaction, and focuses on the appeal of the eight female main characters. A sequel of &quot;To Heart&quot;, &quot;To Heart 2&quot;, was released on December 28, 2004 for the PlayStation 2. A special bundle of &quot;To Heart 2&quot; and a PS2 version of &quot;To Heart&quot; was released on the same day. The original PC release of the visual novel was titled &quot;To Heart&quot;, but the anime and the PSE versions later changed to &quot;ToHeart&quot; without any space between the words. The English release of the anime uses the former format. A remake, also titled &quot;ToHeart&quot;, is scheduled to be released on June 26, 2025 for Windows and the Nintendo Switch.

&quot;To Heart&quot; was adapted into a thirteen-episode anime television series by Oriental Light and Magic aired between April and July 1999, and a second anime, &quot;To Heart: Remember My Memories&quot;, aired between October and December 2004. The first anime was licensed by Right Stuf International for distribution in North America; the first DVD was released in March 2007. Two manga series were produced, both illustrated by Ukyō Takao and serialized in MediaWorks manga magazine &quot;Dengeki Daioh&quot;. The first manga, which ran between October 1997 and December 1999, was based on the original visual novel, and the second manga, which ran between November 2004 and July 2005, was based on the anime &quot;To Heart: Remember My Memories&quot;. A drama CD entitled &quot;Piece of Heart&quot; was released in October 1999.

==Premise==
Set at a high school in the near future, the main character, Hiroyuki Fujita, is a student. He encounters ten pretty girls, including his childhood friend Akari and a maid robot Multi HMX-12, and must make the right decisions so as to win their hearts.

In the anime adaptation, the story focuses on the relationship between Hiroyuki and Akari.

==Gameplay==
&quot;To Heart&quot; is a romance visual novel. Its gameplay requires little player interaction as much of the game&#x27;s duration is spent on reading the text that appears on the screen, which represents the story&#x27;s narrative and dialogue. The text is accompanied by character sprites, which represent who Hiroyuki is talking to, over background art. Throughout the game, the player encounters CG artwork at certain points in the story, which take the place of the background art and character sprites. A gallery of the viewed CGs and played background music is available on the game&#x27;s title screen. &quot;To Heart&quot; follows a branching plotline with multiple endings, and depending on the decisions that the player makes during the game, the plot will progress in a specific direction.

The game divides each school day of the storyline into four segments. These segments illustrate the events that occur during Hiroyuki&#x27;s commute to school, during school, after school, and after he returns home at the end of each day. Depending on the time of the day and the player&#x27;s actions, they may be presented one of four types of events: dated events, which occur automatically during certain points in the game&#x27;s plotline; affection events, which occur during certain periods of time only if specific conditions pertaining to a character&#x27;s affection towards Hiroyuki are met; frequency events, which occur after meeting a character a predetermined number of times; and VS events, which occurs if two characters&#x27; affection towards Hiroyuki conflict with one another.

At the end of each school day, the player is given the option to navigate to various locations within the game&#x27;s setting. Each choosable location is accompanied by an image of a heroine in order to allow the choices to be easier to make. Every so often, the player will also come to a &quot;decision point&quot;, where they are given the chance to choose from multiple options. Text progression pauses at these points, and depending on the choices that the player makes, the affection rate of the heroine associated with the event will either increase, decrease, or remain the same. This mechanism determines which direction of the plot the player will progress into. There are ten plotlines that the player will have the chance to experience, one for each of the heroines in the story. The game also contains a bad ending in which the player is unable to pursue the other scenarios. In order to view all of the plot lines, the player will have to replay the game multiple times and make different decisions to progress the plot in an alternate direction.

In the versions released since the original, there are six bonus minigames available. The first game is a platform game called &quot;Heart by Heart&quot;, in which the player controls a &quot;To Heart&quot; character in one of the thirty static, non-moving levels. The player&#x27;s objective is to defeat all of the enemies in the level using various attacks within a time limit. The minigame also features a two-player variation, in which the players may compete or cooperate with each other within the game&#x27;s levels. The second, &quot;&quot;, is a puzzle game in which the player gains points by forming and eliminating lines of three or more blocks of the same shape. The player achieves this by swapping the preexisting blocks in the game&#x27;s screen with those in a bank of blocks allotted to them. The third minigame, titled , is a side-scrolling shooter game featuring Serika Kurusugawa. The player&#x27;s goal is to progress through a horizontally scrolling level, while attacking enemies and dodging their attacks. and are bonus scenarios in which the player is given simulated massages by the characters Multi or Serio using the DualShock controller&#x27;s vibration function. Lastly, is a minigame that appears in Shiho Nagaoka&#x27;s scenario, in which Hiroyuki and Shiho attempt to shoot each other with water guns.

==Development==
After completing &quot;Shizuku&quot; and &quot;Kizuato&quot;, main planner and scenario writer Tatsuya Takahashi began conceptualizing the third entry to the Leaf Visual Novel Series, which would later become &quot;To Heart&quot;. Takahashi originally considered creating a story with dark fantasy and gothic themes, but changed his approach in order to avoid making three consecutive works with dark themes. He then settled on creating a romance, and later incorporated comical elements. Early in development, Takahashi consulted frequent collaborator Tōru Minazuki for the creation of the story. The two originally considered creating the story and characters entirely by themselves, but after Minazuki expressed his concern that having only six heroines is not enough to exemplify a romance theme, the two asked writer Saki Aomura and illustrator Hisashi Kawata to assist in the project&#x27;s development. Out of the ten heroines created, Takahashi wrote the scenarios for Akari, Multi, Tomoko, Serika, Aoi, and Ayaka; Aomura authored the scenarios for Lemmy, Kotone, and Shiho; and the scenario for Rio was written by a third writer named Udaru Harada. Minazuki designed and illustrated Takahashi&#x27;s characters, while Kawata illustrated the remaining characters.

The writers did not begin work on the story until the characters were created. Takahashi felt the game&#x27;s story is simply actions that represent what becomes of the characters. He mentioned the story exists not because he wanted to write the story, but because he wanted to &quot;illustrate&quot; the characters. Takahashi believed that such a writing style was unique even within the game industry at the time, but has since become the norm. Although the story contains futuristic elements such as maid robots, Takahashi stated the story takes place during contemporary times. Parts of the school in which the game takes place was based on the alma mater that Takahashi, Minazuki, and Aomura had attended, and Takahashi said the game&#x27;s story reflects the staff members&#x27; school experience during the 1980s. &quot;To Heart&quot; was released as an eroge visual novel for Microsoft Windows PCs on May 23, 1997, following the releases of the previous Leaf Visual Novel Series titles.

===PlayStation release===
The original Windows version was followed by an all-ages version for the PlayStation on March 25, 1999. Takahashi viewed the PS port as a &quot;brand new game&quot; under the disguise of a ported title, as he believed the original staff in the development team could not be satisfied with simply a straightforward port. Several changes were made to the PS version, including the removal of adult scenes and additions such as voice acting, new and rewritten scenarios, a new heroine named Ayaka Kurusugawa, and bonus minigames.

Takahashi stated that the addition of voice acting was decided upon early into development, but because of the high amount of memory needed to store the voice acting&#x27;s audio files, the decision caused the development team to debate between using higher quality audio or a smaller number of discs. Ultimately, the amount of data required by the voice acting caused the game to be released on two discs. Aomura also made changes to the stories of his characters, and he admitted that he did not thoroughly understand Shiho&#x27;s character while writing her scenario for the Windows version&#x27;s development. He made revisions to the scenario in the PS version, and saw the result as a completed version. Takahashi felt the majority of the scenarios were smoother without the erotic scenes present in the original version, and stated that the original&#x27;s inclusion of fan service scenes was a natural decision made during development, despite how they felt forced to him.

===Subsequent releases===

&quot;To Heart&quot; received two versions for the Microsoft Windows operating system in 2003. The first is a &quot;renewal package&quot; re-release based on the original release version, and was released on June 20, with additional support for Windows ME/2000/XP PCs. An enhanced re-release, titled &quot;To Heart PSE&quot;, was also released for Windows PCs on June 27. Unlike the renewal package release, &quot;PSE&quot; is an all-ages release, and contains the additional content found in the PS version. The visual novel also received a version playable on the PlayStation 2, when the game was released as part of &quot;To Heart 2&quot;″s limited deluxe pack on December 28, 2004. The PS2 version of the game was enhanced from the previous PS release, and was not included with the limited or regular edition releases of &quot;To Heart 2&quot;. Lastly, a PlayStation Portable version, titled &quot;To Heart Portable&quot;, was released as part of the &quot;To Heart 2 Portable&quot;″s &quot;W Pack&quot; and limited edition releases on July 30, 2009. &quot;Portable&quot; was also released individually as a budget-priced version on October 27, 2011. Characters from &quot;To Heart&quot; are also playable in &quot;&quot;, a fighting game developed by Aquaplus featuring characters from various Leaf games. A remake of the first game, titled &quot;ToHeart&quot; and featuring 3D graphics for the characters, is scheduled to be released on Windows and the Nintendo Switch on June 26, 2025.

A was released by MediaWorks, and contains images from the PS version.

A manga adaptation based on the original &quot;To Heart&quot; visual novel was illustrated by Ukyō Takao and serialized in MediaWorks&#x27; shōnen manga magazine &quot;Dengeki Daioh&quot; between October 1997 and December 1999; the chapters were later compiled into three bound volumes published under MediaWorks&#x27; &quot;Dengeki Comics&quot; imprint.

===Anime===
A thirteen-episode anime series adaptation produced by Oriental Light and Magic and directed by Naohito Takahashi aired in Japan between April 1 and June 24, 1999. The overall story centers around Akari Kamigishi&#x27;s blossoming relationship with the protagonist Hiroyuki. Six short bonus broadcasts were produced and aired after selected episodes. They lasted around five minutes and followed the general style of the main anime, although the characters are drawn super deformed. Three pieces of theme music were used for the episode; one opening theme and two ending themes. The opening theme is &quot;Feeling Heart&quot; by Masami Nakatsukasa; the first ending theme is &quot;Yell&quot; by Ayako Kawasumi, and the second ending theme is &quot;Access&quot; by Spy. Different ending themes were used depending on the location of the broadcast. The DVD and VHS releases used &quot;Yell&quot; as the ending theme. A set of six DVDs, videotapes and laserdiscs were sold in Japan for the &quot;To Heart&quot; anime.

&quot;To Heart&quot; was licensed for North American release by The Right Stuf International at Anime Expo 2004 on July 3, at their panel. Volume one was scheduled for late 2005, but the master&#x27;s copy Right Stuf received from Japan were in bad shape, delaying the release. Due to the fact that &quot;To Heart&quot; was animated in the process of cel animation, it was captured on film instead of digitally on a computer, but the film masters had been destroyed, and their only choice was to restore and digitally remaster the video that they had been sent. All thirteen episodes and the six bonus extra were released on four DVD volumes between March 27 and August 28, 2007.

A sequel anime series entitled &quot;To Heart: Remember My Memories&quot; is set a year after the conclusion of the first anime and completes the anime&#x27;s storyline (deviating from the visual novel). The future of Akari, Hiroyuki, and Multi are also shown. In &quot;To Heart: Remember My Memories&quot;, characters&#x27; hair color changed, for example Hiroyuki&#x27;s hair, which turned from a dark brown to a greenish blue.

The episodes were released on seven DVD compilation volumes in Japan. Seven short omake episodes titled &quot;Heart Fighters&quot; were released with the consumer DVD versions of &quot;To Heart: Remember My Memories&quot;; they are not available on rental DVDs. Unlike the bonus shorts of the first season, the characters are not drawn super deformed and there is an overall arching mini-story. The humor comes from its parodies of popular Japanese culture. Two pieces of theme music were used for the episodes; one opening theme and one ending theme. The opening theme is (Into Your Heart)&quot; by Naomi Tanisaki, that ranked at No. 63 on the Japanese Oricon weekly singles chart, and the ending theme is by Haruna Ikeda.

<text>Kaiser-Wilhelmsland (&quot;Emperor William&#x27;s Land&quot;) formed part of German New Guinea (), the South Pacific protectorate of the German Empire. Named in honour of Wilhelm I, who reigned as German Emperor () from 1871 to 1888, it included the northern part of present-day Papua New Guinea. From 1884 until 1920 the territory was a protectorate () of the German Empire. Kaiser-Wilhelmsland, the Bismarck Archipelago (including New Mecklenburg and New Pomerania), the northern Solomon Islands, the Caroline Islands, Palau, Nauru, the Northern Mariana Islands, and the Marshall Islands comprised German New Guinea.

Most of the German settlers in Kaiser-Wilhelmsland worked as plantation owners, miners, or government functionaries; the number of European settlers, including non-Germans, was never very high. In 1885, Lutheran and Catholic congregations sent clergy to establish missions; they experienced moderate, but very slow, success with the indigenous peoples. Missionaries and plantation owners alike were limited by tropical diseases and by travel and communication barriers.

The Germans never fully explored the protectorate, though in 1914 the Imperial German Government mounted an expedition to explore and map the interior. Lutheran missionaries were frequently the first Europeans to explore the interior and to examine the different fauna and flora.

Following the outbreak of World War I in July 1914, Australian troops quickly overran the German protectorate (September to November, 1914) and it came under Australian military administration. In accordance with the settlements ending World War I, from 1920 the Commonwealth of Australia, a British dominion, administered Kaiser-Wilhelmsland as part of the Territory of New Guinea, a League of Nations mandate.

== History ==

The coastline of the northern and eastern portions of New Guinea had been charted by navigators in the early 17th century, and the visible mountain ranges named by British admiralty navigators later in the century. Most German surveying efforts had focused on coastal regions and river basins, where Germans had established plantations. The boundary between Papua and Kaiser Wilhelmsland had been established by a joint British-German expedition in 1909; the interior had not been mapped. Since then, Papuan gold prospectors had crossed into German territory which, from the German perspective, made the accuracy of the border essential.

===1870–1880===

In the 1870s and 1880s German commercial firms began to site trading stations in New Guinea. Agents of J.C. Godeffroy &amp; Sohn reached the Bismarck Archipelago from the Caroline Islands in 1872. In 1875 Hernsheim &amp; Company moved to the Archipelago.

===1880–1900===

In 1884, the German New Guinea Company was founded in Berlin by Adolph von Hansemann and a syndicate of German bankers for the purpose of colonising and exploiting resources on &quot;Neu Guinea&quot; (German New Guinea), where German interest grew after British Queensland&#x27;s annexation of part of eastern New Guinea. 
This expedition was with the knowledge and blessing of the German Chancellor, Count Otto von Bismarck, and with secrecy and speed an expedition was fitted out under Dr Otto Finsch, ornithologist and explorer.

His task was to select land for plantation development on the north-east coast of New Guinea and establish trading posts. Its influence soon grew to encompass the entire north-eastern part of New Guinea and some of the islands off the coast.

The Neuguinea Compagnie expedition left Sydney for New Guinea in the steamer Samoa captained by Eduard Dallmann. On 19 August, Chancellor Bismarck ordered the establishment of a German protectorate in the New Britain Archipelago and north-eastern New Guinea.

In 1885 and 1887, Johann Flierl established missionary stations in Simbang and Timba Island. After malaria epidemics in 1889 and again in 1891 killed almost half of the European settlers on the coast in Finschhafen, many of the Europeans moved toward Friedrich Wilhelmshafen (now Madang). Flierl established a Mission station at the Sattelberg, in the highlands. In 1890 and 1891, he built the Sattelberg Mission Station there and constructed a road approximately between the station and the Finsch harbour (&quot;Finschhafen&quot;), which cut the travelling time from three days to five hours.

German colonial rule in New Guinea lasted for a period of thirty years, For the first fifteen years the colony was administered under imperial charters by a private company, in the manner of the old British and Dutch East India company, but with far less success. From 1899 to 1914, the Imperial Government administered German New Guinea through a governor, who was assisted after 1904 by a nominated Government Council.

When the Imperial Government took over the running of the colony in 1899, its over-riding objective was rapid economic development, based on a German-controlled plantation economy.

===1900–1914===

In April 1911, Dr Wegener, 
director of the Meteorological Observatory in Apia, stated he was on his way to German New Guinea, to make preliminary arrangements for a series of journeys by balloon across the mainland, the purpose of which was to make aerial surveys.

In late 1913, the Imperial Colonial Office appointed Hermann Detzner to lead an expedition to survey the border between the British protectorate, called Papua, and the German territory and to survey and map the interior. Detzner was a military surveyor.

The expedition set off along the Langimar-Watut divide, and travelled by raft down the Watut River to its junction with the Markham River, and on to the Lutheran Mission station at Gabmadzung (near the Lae Nadzab Airport).

===1914–1918===


On 4 August 1914, Britain declared war on Germany. As World War I spread to the Pacific, Australian troops invaded German New Guinea, taking the German barracks in Herbertshöhe (present day Kokopo) and forcing the defending German colonial troops to capitulate on 21 September after their defeat at Bita Paka.

On 6 August 1914, residents of the Protectorate were notified by proclamation that a state of war existed between Germany, and England, France and Russia. During this time Detzner continued surveying and avoiding allied forces.

On 11 November 1918, Detzner was advised that the war had ended and surrendered himself at Finschafen complete with sword and sun helmet. He was interned at Sydney and returned to Germany.

===1920–1945===

In 1918, Kaiser Wilhelmsland and the other territories that comprised German New Guinea (New Pomerania and the islands of the Bismarck Archipelago) were administered by the Commonwealth of Australia. Beginning in 1920, Australia, under a mandate from the League of Nations, governed the former German territory of New Guinea. It was administered under this mandate until the Japanese invasion in December 1941. Most of the territory of New Guinea, including the islands of Bougainville, and New Britain, was occupied by Japanese forces before recapture during the final months of the war in the Australian-American New Guinea campaign.

==Natural features==
Quaternary glaciers created much of the topography of Kaiser-Wilhelmsland. Recent studies suggest Mount Wilhelm held approximately of glacial ice. Further north, closer to the Equator, the glaciers left behind large rubble fields.

The territory of Kaiser-Wilhelmsland was largely mountainous, with Mount Wilhelm the highest peak of the Hagan Range, which separated the protectorate from the British &quot;Papua&quot;. There are several major rivers, notably the Sepik River which drops from the Highlands and winds through lowland swamp plains to the north coast.
The Markham River flows from the Finisterre Range and ends in the Huon Gulf. The Huon Peninsula, named for the French explorer Jean-Michel Huon de Kermadec, has raised beaches, usually created by the combination of tectonic coastal uplift and quaternary sea-level fluctuations. The Saruwaged &quot;massif&quot;, with its twin peaks of Bangeta and Saruwaged, dominate the Saruwaged Range; rugged and steep, the massif reaches , and is surrounded by jungles at its base.

==Indigenous population==

Near Mount Hagen, archaeologists have identified the Kuk Swamp (), one of the oldest agricultural drainage sites in Australasia; the site has been identified as a UNESCO site, and is on the list of recommended World Heritage sites.

Linguistic features suggest the origins of the population. Along the southeast coast and in the Markham Valley, the Austronesia family of languages predominate. The two main languages were Kâte and Yabim, with Kâte spoken in the mountainous hinterlands and Yabim on the coastal areas, particularly on coast of the Huon Peninsula. The Non-Austronesian languages are heard most commonly in the mountain regions.

<text>The Special Activities Center (SAC) is a division of the United States Central Intelligence Agency responsible for covert and paramilitary operations. The unit was named Special Activities Division (SAD) prior to 2015. Within SAC there are two separate groups: SAC/SOG (Special Operations Group) for tactical paramilitary operations and SAC/PAG (Political Action Group) for covert political action.

The Special Operations Group is responsible for operations that include clandestine or covert operations with which the US government does not want to be overtly associated. As such, unit members, called Paramilitary Operations Officers and Specialized Skills Officers, do not typically wear uniforms.

If they are compromised during a mission, the US government may deny all knowledge. The group generally recruits personnel from special mission units within the U.S. Special Operations community.

SOG Paramilitary Operations Officers account for a majority of Distinguished Intelligence Cross and Intelligence Star recipients during conflicts or incidents that elicited CIA involvement. These are the highest two awards for valor within the CIA in recognition of distinguished valor and excellence in the line of duty. SOG operatives also account for the majority of the stars displayed on the Memorial Wall at CIA headquarters, indicating that the officer died while on active duty. The Latin motto of SAC is &quot;Tertia Optio&quot;, which means &quot;Third Option,&quot; as covert action represents an additional option within the realm of national security when diplomacy and military action are not feasible.

The Ground Branch of the Special Operations Group has been known to operate alongside the United Kingdom&#x27;s E Squadron, the UK&#x27;s equivalent paramilitary unit.

The Political Action Group is responsible for covert activities related to political influence, psychological operations, economic warfare, and cyberwarfare.

Tactical units within SAC can also carry out covert political action while deployed in hostile and austere environments. A large covert operation typically has components that involve many or all of these categories as well as paramilitary operations.

Covert political and influence operations are used to support US foreign policy. As overt support for one element of an insurgency can be counterproductive due to the unfavorable impression of the United States in some countries, in such cases covert assistance allows the US to assist without damaging the reputation of its beneficiaries.

==Overview==
SAC provides the United States National Security Council with alternative options when overt military and/or diplomatic actions are not viable or politically feasible. SAC can be directly tasked by the U.S. president or the National Security Council at the president&#x27;s direction, unlike other U.S. special mission forces. SAC/SOG has far fewer members than most of the other special missions units, such as the U.S. Army&#x27;s 1st Special Forces Operational Detachment-Delta (Delta Force) or Naval Special Warfare Development Group (DEVGRU).

As the action arm of the CIA&#x27;s Directorate of Operations, SAC/SOG conducts direct action missions such as raids, ambushes, sabotage, targeted killings and unconventional warfare (e.g., training and leading guerrilla and military units of other countries in combat) as an irregular military force. SAC/SOG also conducts special reconnaissance that can be either military or intelligence driven and is carried out by Paramilitary Officers (also called Paramilitary Operatives or Paramilitary Operations Officers) when in &quot;non-permissive environments&quot;. Paramilitary Operations Officers are also fully trained case officers (i.e., &quot;spy handlers&quot;) and as such conduct clandestine human intelligence (HUMINT) operations throughout the world.

The political action group within SAC conducts the deniable psychological operations, also known as black propaganda, as well as &quot;covert influence&quot; to induce political change in other countries as part of United States foreign policy. Covert intervention in foreign elections is the most significant form of SAC&#x27;s political action. This involves financial support for favored candidates, media guidance, technical support for public relations, get-out-the-vote or political organizing efforts, legal expertise, advertising campaigns, assistance with poll-watching, and other means of direct action. Policy decisions are influenced by agents, such as subverted officials of the country, to make decisions in their official capacity that are in the furtherance of U.S. policy aims. In addition, mechanisms for forming and developing opinions involve the covert use of propaganda.

Propaganda includes leaflets, newspapers, magazines, books, radio, and television, all of which are geared to convey the U.S. message appropriate to the region. These techniques have expanded to cover the internet as well. They may employ officers to work as journalists, recruit agents of influence, operate media platforms, plant certain stories or information in places it is hoped will come to public attention, or seek to deny and/or discredit information that is public knowledge. In all such propaganda efforts, &quot;black&quot; operations denote those in which the audience is to be kept ignorant of the source; &quot;white&quot; efforts are those in which the originator openly acknowledges themselves, and &quot;gray&quot; operations are those in which the source is partly but not fully acknowledged.

Some examples of political action programs were the prevention of the Italian Communist Party (PCI) from winning elections between 1948 and the late 1960s; overthrowing the governments of Iran in 1953 and Guatemala in 1954; arming rebels in Indonesia in 1957; and providing funds and support to the trade union federation Solidarity following the imposition of martial law in Poland after 1981.

SAC&#x27;s existence became better known as a result of the &quot;War on Terror&quot;. Beginning in autumn of 2001, SAC/SOG paramilitary teams arrived in Afghanistan to hunt down al-Qaeda leaders, facilitate the entry of U.S. Army Special Forces, and lead the United Islamic Front for the Salvation of Afghanistan against the ruling Taliban. SAC/SOG units also defeated Ansar al-Islam in Iraqi Kurdistan prior to the invasion of Iraq in 2003, and trained, equipped, organized and led the Kurdish peshmerga forces to defeat the Iraqi Army in northern Iraq. Numerous books have been published on the exploits of CIA paramilitary officers, including Conboy and Morrison&#x27;s &quot;Feet to the Fire: CIA Covert Operations in Indonesia, 1957–1958&quot;, and Warner&#x27;s &quot;Shooting at the Moon: The Story of America&#x27;s Clandestine War in Laos&quot;. Most experts consider SAC/SOG the premier force for unconventional warfare (UW), whether that warfare consists of either creating or combating an insurgency in a foreign country.
There remains some conflict between the CIA&#x27;s Directorate of Operations and the more clandestine parts of the United States Special Operations Command (USSOCOM), such as the Joint Special Operations Command. This is usually confined to the civilian/political heads of the respective Department/Agency. The combination of SAC and USSOCOM units has resulted in some of the more prominent actions of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, including the locating and killing of Osama bin Laden. SAC/SOG has several missions, one being the recruiting, training, and leading of indigenous forces in combat operations. SAC/SOG and its successors have been used when it was considered desirable to have plausible deniability about US support (this is called a covert operation or &quot;covert action&quot;). Unlike other special missions units, SAC/SOG operatives combine special operations and clandestine intelligence capabilities in one individual. These individuals can operate in any environment (sea, air or ground) with limited to no support.

==Covert action==
The CIA is authorized to collect intelligence, conduct counterintelligence, and conduct covert action by the National Security Act of 1947. President Ronald Reagan issued Executive Order 12333 titled &quot;United States Intelligence Activities&quot; in 1984. This order defined covert action as &quot;special activities,&quot; both political and military, that the U.S. government would deny, and granted the exclusive authority to conduct such operations to the CIA. The CIA was also designated as the sole authority under the 1991 Intelligence Authorization Act and mirrored in Title 50 of the United States Code Section 413(e). The CIA must have a presidential finding in order to conduct these activities under the Hughes-Ryan amendment to the 1991 Intelligence Authorization Act. These findings are monitored by the oversight committees in both the U.S. Senate, called the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence (SSCI) and the U.S. House of Representatives, called the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence (HPSCI).

The Pentagon commissioned a study to determine whether the CIA or the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) should conduct covert action paramilitary operations. Their study determined that the CIA should maintain this capability and be the &quot;sole government agency conducting covert action.&quot; The DoD found that it does not have the legal authority to conduct covert action or the operational agility to carry out these types of missions.

In an article for ABC News, former Deputy Secretary of Defense and retired CIA paramilitary officer Mick Mulroy explained that the term &quot;covert action&quot; is derived from &quot;Presidential Findings&quot; authorizing the CIA to conduct specific &quot;special activities&quot; to support U.S. national security objectives. He advocated for covert actions to be fully incorporated in the U.S. National Security Strategy and the 2018 National Defense Strategy in the form of a &quot;Covert Action Annex&quot; and for covert actions to be fully funded to operate in support of overall objectives in the form of a &quot;Covert Action Fund&quot;.

==Selection and training==
Special Activities Center has several hundred officers, mostly former members from Tier 1 units like SEAL Team Six and Delta Force, as well as other U.S. Special Operations Forces personnel. The CIA has also recruited individuals from within the agency. The CIA&#x27;s formal designations for these individuals are &quot;paramilitary operations officers&quot; and &quot;specialized skills officers&quot;. Paramilitary operations officers often attend the Clandestine Service Trainee (CST) program, which trains them as clandestine intelligence operatives at an internal paramilitary training course.

The primary strengths of SAC paramilitary officers are operational agility, adaptability, and deniability. They often operate in small teams, typically made up of two to ten operatives (with some operations being carried out by a single officer), all usually with extensive military tactical experience and a set of specialized skills that does not exist in any other unit. As fully trained intelligence case officers, paramilitary operations officers possess all the clandestine skills to collect human intelligence – and most importantly – to recruit assets from among the indigenous troops receiving their training. These officers often operate in remote locations behind enemy lines to carry out direct action (including raids and sabotage), counter-intelligence, guerrilla/unconventional warfare, counter-terrorism, and hostage rescue missions, in addition to being able to conduct espionage via HUMINT assets.

There are four principal elements within SAC&#x27;s Special Operations Group, formerly called branches, now organized as departments: the Air Department, the Maritime Department, the Ground Department, and the Armor and Special Programs Department. The Armor and Special Programs Department is charged with the development, testing, and covert procurement of new personnel and vehicular armor, and maintenance of stockpiles of ordnance and weapons systems used by the SOG, almost all of which must be obtained from clandestine sources abroad, in order to provide SOG operatives and their foreign trainees with plausible deniability in accordance with U.S. congressional directives.

Together, the SAC/SOG comprises a complete combined arms covert paramilitary force. Paramilitary operations officers are the core of each branch and routinely move between the branches to gain expertise in all aspects of SOG. As such, paramilitary operations officers are trained to operate in a multitude of environments. Because these officers are taken from the most highly trained units in the U.S. military and then provided with extensive additional training to become CIA clandestine intelligence officers, many U.S. security experts assess them as the most elite of the U.S. special missions units.

Paramilitary operations officers require a bachelor&#x27;s degree to be considered for employment. SAC officers are trained at Camp Peary, Virginia (also known as &quot;The Farm&quot;), &quot;The Point&quot; (Harvey Point), a facility outside of Hertford, North Carolina, and at privately owned training centers around the United States. In addition to the eighteen months of training in the Clandestine Service Trainee (CST) program required to become a clandestine intelligence officer, paramilitary operations officers are trained to a high level of proficiency in:
* explosive devices and firearms (foreign and domestic)
* hand-to-hand combat
* high-performance / tactical driving (on and off-road)
* apprehension avoidance (including picking handcuffs and escaping from confinement)
* improvised explosive devices
* cyberwarfare
* covert channels
* HAHO / HALO parachuting
* combat and commercial SCUBA
* closed circuit diving
* proficiency in foreign languages
* surreptitious entry operations (picking or otherwise bypassing locks)
* vehicle hot-wiring
* Survival, Evasion, Resistance and Escape (SERE)
* extreme survival and wilderness training
* combat EMS medical training
* tactical communications
* tracking

==History==
===Office of Strategic Services===
While the World War II Office of Strategic Services (OSS) was technically a military agency under the Joint Chiefs of Staff, in practice, it was fairly autonomous and enjoyed direct access to President Franklin D. Roosevelt. Major General William Joseph Donovan was the head of the OSS. Donovan was a soldier and Medal of Honor recipient from World War I. He was also a lawyer and former classmate of Roosevelt at Columbia Law School. Like its successor the CIA, the OSS included both human intelligence functions and special operations paramilitary functions. Its Secret Intelligence Division was responsible for espionage, while the Jedburgh teams, a U.S.-U.K.-French collaboration, were forerunners of groups that create guerrilla units, such as the U.S. Army Special Forces and the CIA. The OSS&#x27;s Operational Groups were larger U.S. units that carried out direct action behind enemy lines. Even during World War II, the idea of intelligence and special operations units not under strict military control was controversial. The OSS operated primarily in the European Theater of Operations and to some extent in the China-Burma-India Theater, although General of the Army Douglas MacArthur was extremely reluctant to have any OSS personnel within his area of operations.

From 1943 to 1945, the OSS played a major role in training Kuomintang troops in China and Burma, and recruited other indigenous irregular forces for sabotage as well as guides for Allied forces in Burma fighting the Japanese army. OSS also helped arm, train and supply resistance movements, including Mao Zedong&#x27;s People&#x27;s Liberation Army in China and the Viet Minh in French Indochina, in areas occupied by the Axis powers. Other functions of the OSS included the use of propaganda, espionage, subversion, and post-war planning.

One of the OSS&#x27;s greatest accomplishments during World War II was its penetration of Nazi Germany by OSS operatives. The OSS was responsible for training German and Austrian commandos for missions inside Nazi Germany. Some of these agents included exiled communists, socialist party members, labor activists, anti-Nazi POWs, and German and Jewish refugees. At the height of its influence during World War II, the OSS employed almost 24,000 people.

OSS Paramilitary Officers parachuted into many countries that were behind enemy lines, including France, Norway, Greece, and the Netherlands. In Crete, OSS paramilitary officers linked up with, equipped and fought alongside Greek resistance forces against the Axis occupation.

The OSS was disbanded shortly after World War II, with its intelligence analysis functions moving temporarily into the United States Department of State. Espionage and counterintelligence went into military units, while paramilitary and other covert action functions went into the Office of Policy Coordination set up in 1948. Between the CIA&#x27;s original creation by the National Security Act of 1947 and various mergers and reorganizations through 1952, the wartime OSS functions generally ended up in the CIA. The mission of training and leading guerrillas in due course went to the United States Army Special Forces, but those missions required to remain covert were performed by the (Deputy) Directorate of Plans and its successor the Directorate of Operations of the CIA. In 1962, the CIA&#x27;s paramilitary operations centralized in the Special Operations Division (SOD), the predecessor of the SAC. The direct descendant of the OSS&#x27; Special Operations is the CIA&#x27;s Special Activities Division.

===Tibet===

After the Chinese invasion of Tibet in October 1950, the CIA inserted paramilitary (PM) teams into Tibet to train and lead Tibetan resistance fighters against the People&#x27;s Liberation Army of China. These teams selected and then trained Tibetan soldiers in the Rocky Mountains of the United States; training occurred at Camp Hale. The PM teams then advised and led these commandos against the Chinese, both from Nepal and India and in some cases worked with Research and Analysis Wing. In addition, CIA Paramilitary Officers were responsible for the Dalai Lama&#x27;s clandestine escape to India along with Indian intelligence, narrowly escaping capture by the People&#x27;s Liberation Army.

According to a book by retired CIA officer John Kenneth Knaus, entitled &quot;Orphans Of The Cold War: America And The Tibetan Struggle For Survival&quot;, Gyalo Thondup, the older brother of the 14th Dalai Lama, sent the CIA five Tibetan recruits. These recruits were trained in paramilitary tactics on the island of Saipan in the Northern Marianas. Shortly thereafter, the five men were covertly returned to Tibet &quot;to assess and organize the resistance&quot; and selected another 300 Tibetans for training. U.S. assistance to the Tibetan resistance ceased after the 1972 Nixon visit to China, after which the United States and China normalized relations.

===Korea===
The CIA sponsored a variety of activities during the Korean War. These activities included maritime operations behind North Korean lines. Yong Do Island, connected by a rugged isthmus to Pusan, served as the base for those operations. Well-trained Korean guerrillas carried out these operations. The four principal U.S. advisers responsible for the training and operational planning of those special missions were Dutch Kramer, Tom Curtis, George Atcheson, and Joe Pagnella. All of these Paramilitary Operations Officers operated through a CIA front organization called the Joint Advisory Commission, Korea (JACK), headquartered at Tongnae, a village near Pusan, on the peninsula&#x27;s southeast coast. These paramilitary teams were responsible for numerous maritime raids and ambushes behind North Korean lines, as well as prisoner of war rescue operations.

These were the first maritime unconventional warfare units that trained indigenous forces as surrogates. They also provided a model, along with the other CIA-sponsored ground-based, paramilitary Korean operations, for the Military Assistance Command, Vietnam – Studies and Observations Group (MACV-SOG) activities conducted by the U.S. military and the CIA/SOD (now Special Activities Center) in Vietnam. In addition, CIA paramilitary ground-based teams worked directly for U.S. military commanders, specifically with the 8th Army, on the &quot;White Tiger&quot; initiative. This initiative included inserting South Korean commandos and CIA Paramilitary Operations Officers prior to the two major amphibious assaults on North Korea, including the landing at Inchon.

===Cuba (1961)===

The Bay of Pigs Invasion (known as &quot;La Batalla de Girón,&quot; or &quot;Playa Girón&quot; in Cuba) was an unsuccessful attempt by a U.S.-trained force of Cuban exiles to invade southern Cuba and overthrow the Cuban government of Fidel Castro. The plan was launched in April 1961, less than three months after John F. Kennedy assumed the presidency of the United States. The Cuban Revolutionary Armed Forces, trained and equipped by Eastern Bloc nations, defeated the exile-combatants in three days.

The sea-borne invasion force landed on April 17, and fighting lasted until April 19, 1961. CIA Paramilitary Operations Officers Grayston Lynch and William &quot;Rip&quot; Robertson led the first assault on the beaches, and supervised the amphibious landings. Four American aircrew instructors from Alabama Air National Guard were killed while flying attack sorties. Various sources estimate Cuban Army casualties (killed or injured) to be in the thousands (between 2,000 and 5,000). This invasion followed the successful overthrow by the CIA of the Mosaddeq government in Iran in 1953 and Arbenz government in Guatemala in 1954, but was a failure both militarily and politically. Deteriorating Cuban-American relations were made worse by the 1962 Cuban Missile Crisis.

===Bolivia===
The National Liberation Army of Bolivia (ELN-Ejército de Liberación Nacional de Bolivia) was a communist guerrilla force that operated from the remote Ñancahuazú region against the pro-U.S. Bolivian government. They were joined by Che Guevara in the mid-1960s. The ELN was well equipped and scored a number of early successes against the Bolivian army in the difficult terrain of the mountainous Camiri region. In the late 1960s, the CIA deployed teams of Paramilitary Operations Officers to Bolivia to train the Bolivian army in order to counter the ELN. These teams linked up with U.S. Army Special Forces and Bolivian Special Forces to track down and capture Guevara, who was a special prize because of his leading role in the Cuban Revolution. On October 9, 1967, Guevara was executed by Bolivian soldiers on the orders of CIA Paramilitary Operations Officer Félix Rodríguez shortly after being captured, according to CIA documents.

===Vietnam and Laos===
The original OSS mission in Vietnam under Major Archimedes Patti was to work with Ho Chi Minh in order to prepare his forces to assist the United States and their Allies in fighting the Japanese. After the end of World War II, the U.S. agreed at Potsdam to turn Vietnam back to their previous French rulers, and in 1950 the U.S. began providing military aid to the French.

CIA Paramilitary Operations Officers trained and led Hmong tribesmen in Laos and Vietnam, and the actions of these officers were not known for several years. Air America was the air component of the CIA&#x27;s paramilitary mission in Southeast Asia and was responsible for all combat, logistics and search and rescue operations in Laos and certain sections of Vietnam. The ethnic minority forces numbered in the tens of thousands. They conducted direct actions missions, led by Paramilitary Operations Officers, against the communist Pathet Lao forces and their North Vietnamese allies.

Elements of the Special Activities Division were seen in the CIA&#x27;s Phoenix Program. One component of the Phoenix Program was involved in the capture and killing of suspected Viet Cong (VC) members. Between 1968 and 1972, the Phoenix Program captured 81,740 VC members, of whom 26,369 were killed. The program was also successful in destroying their infrastructure. By 1970, communist plans repeatedly emphasized attacking the government&#x27;s &quot;pacification&quot; program and specifically targeted Phoenix agents. The VC also imposed quotas. In 1970, for example, communist officials near Da Nang in northern South Vietnam instructed their agents to &quot;kill 400 persons&quot; deemed to be government &quot;tyrant[s]&quot; and to &quot;annihilate&quot; anyone involved with the &quot;pacification&quot; program. Several North Vietnamese officials have made statements about the effectiveness of Phoenix.

MAC-V SOG (Studies and Observations Group, which was originally named the Special Operations Group, but was changed for cover purposes) was created and active during the Vietnam War. While the CIA was just one part of MAC-V SOG, it did have operational control of some of the programs. Many of the military members of MAC-V SOG joined the CIA after their military service. The legacy of MAC-V SOG continues within SAC&#x27;s Special Operations Group.

On May 22, 2016, the CIA honored three paramilitary officers with stars on the memorial wall 56 years after their deaths. They were David W. Bevan, Darrell A. Eubanks, and John S. Lewis, all young men, killed on a mission to resupply anti-Communist forces in Laos. They were all recruited from the famous smokejumpers from Montana. One former smokejumper and paramilitary officer, Mike Oehlerich, believed he should have been on that flight, but they accidentally missed their pickup to the airport. They got stuck in Bangkok and so another crew – Bevan, Eubanks, and Lewis – flew that mission on August 13, 1961. &quot;We had no idea anything happened until we got back the next day, and that&#x27;s when they told us that they went into a canyon and tried to turn around and got into bad air,&quot; he said. CIA officials told him days after the crash that Lewis had jumped out of the plane, rather than remain inside. &quot;When they told me that, I teared up,&quot; Oehlerich recalled. &quot;It was something John and I had talked about – &#x27;Don&#x27;t go down with the airplane, your chances are better if you get out.&#x27;&quot;

===Maritime activities against the Soviet Union===
In 1973, SAD and the CIA&#x27;s Directorate of Science and Technology built and deployed the USNS &quot;Glomar Explorer&quot; (T-AG-193), a large deep-sea salvage ship, on a secret operation. This operation was called Project Azorian (erroneously called Project Jennifer by the press). Her mission was to recover a sunken Soviet submarine, , which had been lost in April 1968. A mechanical failure caused two-thirds of the submarine to break off during recovery, but SAC recovered two nuclear-tipped torpedoes, cryptographic machines and the bodies of six Soviet submariners. An alternative theory claims that all of K-129 was recovered and that the official account was an &quot;elaborate cover-up&quot;.

Also, in the 1970s, the U.S. Navy, the National Security Agency (NSA) and SAD conducted Operation Ivy Bells and a series of other missions to place wiretaps on Soviet underwater communications cables. These operations were covered in detail in the 1998 book &quot;Blind Man&#x27;s Bluff: The Untold Story of American Submarine Espionage&quot;. In the 1985 edition of &quot;Studies in Intelligence&quot;, the CIA&#x27;s in-house journal that outsiders rarely get to see, the CIA describes the &quot;staggering expense and improbable engineering feats&quot; that culminated in the August 1974 mission.

===Nicaragua===
In 1979, the U.S.-backed Anastasio Somoza Debayle dictatorship in Nicaragua fell to the socialist Sandinistas. Once in power, the Sandinistas disbanded the Nicaraguan National Guard, who had committed many human rights abuses, and arrested and executed some of its members. Other former National Guard members helped to form the backbone of the Nicaraguan Counterrevolution or Contra. CIA paramilitary teams from Special Activities Division were deployed to train and lead these rebel forces against the Sandinista government. These paramilitary activities were based in Honduras and Costa Rica. Direct military aid by the United States was eventually forbidden by the Boland Amendment of the Defense Appropriations Act of 1983. The Boland Amendment was extended in October 1984 to forbid action by not only the Defense Department but also to include the Central Intelligence Agency.

The Boland Amendment was a compromise because the U.S. Democratic Party did not have enough votes for a comprehensive ban on military aid. It covered only appropriated funds spent by intelligence agencies. Some of Reagan&#x27;s national security officials used non-appropriated money of the National Security Council (NSC) to circumvent the Amendment. NSC officials sought to arrange funding by third parties. These efforts resulted in the Iran-Contra Affair of 1987, which concerned Contra funding through the proceeds of arms sales to the Islamic Republic of Iran. No court ever made a determination whether Boland covered the NSC, and on the grounds that it was a prohibition rather than a criminal statute, no one was indicted for violating it. Congress later resumed aid to the Contras, totaling over $300 million. The Contra war ended when the Sandinistas were voted out of power by a war-weary populace in 1990. Sandinista leader Daniel Ortega was re-elected as President of Nicaragua in 2006 and took office again on January 10, 2007.

===El Salvador===
CIA personnel were also involved in the Salvadoran civil war. Some allege that the techniques used to interrogate prisoners in El Salvador foreshadowed those later used in Iraq and Afghanistan. In fact, when a similar counter-insurgency program was proposed in Iraq, it was referred to as &quot;the Salvador Option&quot;. Agency officers had strict instructions not to participate in interrogations of prisoners, and to avoid the area where prisoners were held.

===Somalia===
CIA sent in teams of Paramilitary Operations Officers into Somalia prior to the U.S. intervention in 1992. On December 23, 1992, Paramilitary Operations Officer Larry Freedman became the first casualty of the conflict in Somalia. Freedman was a former Army Delta Force operator who had served in every conflict that the U.S. was involved in, both officially and unofficially, since Vietnam. Freedman was killed while conducting special reconnaissance in advance of the entry of U.S. military forces. His mission was completely voluntary, but it required entry into a very hostile area without any support. Freedman was posthumously awarded the Intelligence Star on January 5, 1993, for his &quot;extraordinary heroism.&quot;

SAD/SOG teams were key in working with JSOC and tracking high-value targets (HVT), known as &quot;Tier One Personalities&quot;. Their efforts, working under extremely dangerous conditions with little to no support, led to several very successful joint JSOC/CIA operations. In one specific operation, a CIA case officer, Michael Shanklin and codenamed &quot;Condor&quot;, working with a CIA Technical Operations Officer from the Directorate of Science and Technology, managed to get a cane with a beacon in it to Osman Ato, a wealthy businessman, arms importer, and Mohammed Aideed, a money man whose name was right below Mohamed Farrah Aidid&#x27;s on the Tier One list.

Once Condor confirmed that Ato was in a vehicle, JSOC&#x27;s Delta Force launched a capture operation.

a Little Bird helicopter dropped out of the sky, and a sniper leaned out and fired three shots into the car&#x27;s engine block. The car ground to a halt as commandos roped down from hovering Blackhawks , surrounded the car, and handcuffed Ato. It was the first known helicopter takedown of suspects in a moving car. The next time Jones saw the magic cane, an hour later, Garrison had it in his hand. &quot;I like this cane,&quot; Jones remembers the general exclaiming, a big grin on his face. &quot;Let&#x27;s use this again.&quot; Finally, a tier-one personality was in custody.

President Bill Clinton withdrew U.S. forces on May 4, 1994.

In June 2006, the Islamic Courts Union seized control of southern Somalia, including the country&#x27;s capital Mogadishu, prompting the Ethiopian government to send in troops to try to protect the transitional government. In December, the Islamic Courts warned Ethiopia they would declare war if Ethiopia did not remove all its troops from Somalia. Sheikh Sharif Ahmed, leader of the Islamic Courts, called for a jihad, or holy war, against Ethiopia and encouraged foreign Muslim fighters to come to Somalia. At that time, the United States accused the group of being controlled by al-Qaeda, but the Islamic Courts denied that charge.

In 2009, PBS reported that al-Qaeda had been training terrorists in Somalia for years. Until December 2006, Somalia&#x27;s government had no power outside of the town of Baidoa, from the capital. The countryside and the capital were run by warlords and militia groups who could be paid to protect terrorist groups.

CIA officers kept close tabs on the country and paid a group of Somali warlords to help hunt down members of al-Qaeda according to &quot;The New York Times&quot;. Meanwhile, Ayman al-Zawahiri, the deputy to al-Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden, issued a message calling for all Muslims to go to Somalia. On January 9, 2007, a U.S. official said that ten militants were killed in one airstrike.

On September 14, 2009, Saleh Ali Saleh Nabhan, a senior al-Qaeda leader in East Africa as well as a senior leader in Shabaab, al Qaeda&#x27;s surrogate in Somalia, was killed by elements of U.S. Special Operations. According to a witness, at least two AH-6 Little Bird attack helicopters strafed a two-car convoy. Navy SEALs then seized the body of Nabhan and took two other wounded fighters captive. JSOC and the CIA had been trying to kill Nabhan for some time including back in January 2007, when an AC-130 Gunship was called in on one attempt. A U.S. intelligence source stated that CIA paramilitary teams are directly embedded with Ethiopian forces in Somalia, allowing for the tactical intelligence to launch these operations. Nabhan was wanted for his involvement in the 1998 United States embassy bombings, as well as leading the cell behind the 2002 Mombasa attacks. Nabhan&#x27;s remains were given a burial at sea following the operation. On September 11, 2020, Admiral William McRaven revealed in an interview with the Michael Hayden Center that the decision to use burial at sea for the disposition of Osama Bin Laden&#x27;s body following Operation Neptune Spear was a direct result of his experiences in the killing of Nabhan, citing a belief that the chances of operational success were greater if decisions and procedures were made &quot;as routine as possible.&quot;

From 2010 to 2013, the CIA set up the Somalia National Intelligence and Security Agency (NISA) by providing training, funding, and diplomatic access. In the same time period, the EU and UN have spent millions of dollars on the military training of the Somali National Army (SNA). NISA is considered a professional Somali security force that can be relied upon to neutralize the terrorist threat. This force responded to the complex al-Shabaab attack on the Banadir Regional Courthouse in Mogadishu that killed 25 civilians. NISA&#x27;s response, however, saved hundreds of people and resulted in the death of all the al-Shabaab guerrillas involved.

Significant events during this time frame included the targeted drone strikes against British al-Qaida operative Bilal el-Berjawi and Moroccan al-Qaida operative Abu Ibrahim. It also included the rescue of U.S. citizen Jessica Buchanan by U.S. Navy SEALs. All likely aided by intelligence collection efforts in Somalia.

In November 2020, Michael Goodboe, a senior CIA paramilitary officer, was killed in a terrorist attack in Mogadishu, Somalia. Goodboe was a member of SEAL Team 6 prior to serving with the Special Activities Center. He is the most recent star added to the memorial wall at CIA headquarters in Langley, Virginia. At the time of the attack, the U.S. had around 700 troops in Somalia, assisting local forces to defeat al-Shabaab, the burgeoning al-Qaeda-affiliated terrorist group with an estimated 9,000 fighters throughout the region. The terrorist organization has vowed to overthrow the Somali government, which is supported by some 20,000 troops from the African Union.

===Afghanistan===

During the Soviet–Afghan War in the 1980s, Paramilitary Operations Officers were instrumental in equipping Mujaheddin forces against the Soviet Army. Although the CIA in general, and a Texas congressman named Charlie Wilson in particular, have received most of the attention, the key architect of this strategy was Michael G. Vickers. Vickers was a young Paramilitary Operations Officer from SAD/SOG. The CIA&#x27;s efforts have been given credit for assisting in ending the Soviet involvement in Afghanistan.

SAD paramilitary teams were active in Afghanistan in the 1990s in clandestine operations to locate and kill or capture Osama bin Laden. These teams planned several operations but did not receive the order to execute from President Bill Clinton because the available intelligence did not guarantee a successful outcome weighed against the extraordinary risk to the SAD/SOG teams that would execute the mission. These efforts did, however, build many of the relationships that would prove essential in 2001 U.S. Invasion of Afghanistan.

On September 26, 2001, a CIA team code-named &quot;Jawbreaker&quot; led by Gary Schroen, a case officer, with several members from Special Activities Division including Schroen&#x27;s deputy Philip Reilly, a paramilitary officer, were the first U.S. forces inserted into Afghanistan. The team entered Uzbekistan nine days after the 9/11 attack and linked up with the Northern Alliance in its safe haven of the Panjshir Valley as part of Task Force Dagger.

On October 17, 2001, the eight members of the CIA&#x27;s Team Alpha were inserted into the Darya Suf Valley in two Black Hawk helicopters. Four members of Team Alpha were paramilitary officers from SAD: Alex Hernandez, Scott Spellmeyer, Johnny Micheal Spann, and Andy Hartsog. A fifth, Mark Rausenberger, later became a paramilitary officer; he died on CIA duty in the Philippines in 2016.

The CIA teams provided the Northern Alliance with resources including millions of dollars in cash to buy weapons and pay local fighters and prepared for the arrival of USSOCOM forces. The plan for the invasion of Afghanistan was developed by the CIA, the first time in United States history that such a large-scale military operation was planned by the CIA. SAD, U.S. Army Special Forces, and the Northern Alliance combined to overthrow the Taliban in Afghanistan with minimal loss of U.S. lives. They did this without the use of conventional U.S. military ground forces.

&quot;The Washington Post&quot; stated in an editorial by John Lehman in 2006:

In a 2008 &quot;New York Times&quot; book review of &quot;Horse Soldiers&quot;, a book by Doug Stanton about the invasion of Afghanistan, Bruce Barcott wrote:

Small and highly agile paramilitary mobile teams spread out over the countryside to meet with locals and gather information about the Taliban and al-Qa&#x27;ida. During that time, one of the teams was approached in a village and asked by a young man for help in retrieving his teenage sister. He explained that a senior Taliban official had taken her as a wife and had sharply restricted the time she could spend with her family. The team gave the man a small hand-held tracking device to pass along to his sister, with instructions for her to activate it when the Taliban leader returned home. As a result, the team captured the senior Taliban official and rescued the sister.

====Tora Bora====

In December 2001, Special Activities Division and the Army&#x27;s Delta Force tracked down Osama bin Laden in the rugged mountains near the Khyber Pass in Afghanistan. Former CIA station chief Gary Berntsen, as well as a subsequent Senate investigation, claimed that the combined American special operations task force was largely outnumbered by al-Qaeda forces and that they were denied additional U.S. troops by higher command. The task force also requested munitions to block the avenues of egress of bin Laden, but that request was also denied. The SAC team was unsuccessful, and &quot;Bin Laden and bodyguards walked uncontested out of Tora Bora and disappeared into Pakistan&#x27;s unregulated tribal area.&quot; At Bin Laden&#x27;s abandoned encampment, the team uncovered evidence that bin Laden&#x27;s ultimate aim was to obtain and detonate a nuclear device in the United States.

====Surge====
In September 2009, the CIA planned on &quot;deploying teams of spies, analysts and paramilitary operatives to Afghanistan, part of a broad intelligence &#x27;surge&#x27; ordered by President Obama. This will make its station there among the largest in the agency&#x27;s history.&quot; This presence was expected to surpass the size of the stations in Iraq and Vietnam at the height of those wars. The station was located at the U.S. Embassy in Kabul and was led &quot;by a veteran with an extensive background in paramilitary operations&quot;. The majority of the CIA&#x27;s workforce was located among secret bases and military special operations posts throughout the country.

Also, in 2009, General Stanley McChrystal, the commander of NATO forces in Afghanistan, planned to request an increase in teams of CIA operatives, including their elite paramilitary officers, to join with U.S. military special operations forces. This combination worked well in Iraq and was largely credited with the success of that surge. There were basically three options described in the media: McChrystal&#x27;s increased counterinsurgency campaign; a counter-terror campaign using special operations raids and drone strikes; and withdrawal. The most successful combination in both the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq was the linking up of SAD and military special forces to fight alongside highly trained indigenous units. One thing all of these options had in common was a requirement for greater CIA participation.

====The End Game====

According to existing and former intelligence officials, General McChrystal had his own preferred candidate for the Chief of Station (COS) job, a good friend and decorated CIA paramilitary officer. The officer had extensive experience in war zones, including two previous tours in Afghanistan with one as the Chief of Station, as well as tours in the Balkans, Baghdad and Yemen. He was well known in CIA lore as &quot;the man who saved Hamid Karzai&#x27;s life when the CIA led the effort to oust the Taliban from power in 2001&quot;. President Karzai was said to be greatly indebted to this officer and was pleased when the officer was named chief of station again. According to interviews with several senior officials, this officer &quot;was uniformly well-liked and admired. A career paramilitary officer, he came to the CIA after several years in an elite Marine unit&quot;.

General McChrystal&#x27;s strategy included the lash up of special operations forces from the U.S. Military and from SAC/SOG to duplicate the initial success and the defeat of the Taliban in 2001 and the success of the &quot;Surge&quot; in Iraq in 2007. This strategy proved highly successful and worked very well in Afghanistan with SAC/SOG and JSOC forces conducting raids nearly every night having &quot;superb results&quot; against the enemy.

In 2001, the CIA&#x27;s SAD/SOG began creating what would come to be called Counter-terrorism Pursuit Teams (CTPT). These units grew to include over 3,000 operatives by 2010 and were involved in sustained heavy fighting against the enemy. It was considered the &quot;best Afghan fighting force.&quot;

Located at above sea level, Firebase Lilley in Shkin served as a &quot;nerve center for the covert war.&quot; This covert war included being a hub for these CTPT operations, with Firebase Lilley being just one in a constellation of CIA bases across Afghanistan. These units were not only highly effective in combat operations against the Taliban and al-Qaeda forces but were also used to engage with the tribes in areas with no other official government presence.

This covert war also included a large SOG/CTPT expansion into Pakistan to target senior al-Qaeda and Taliban leadership in the Federally Administered Tribal Area (FATA). CTPT units are the main effort in both the &quot;Counter-terrorism plus&quot; and the full &quot;Counterinsurgency&quot; options being discussed by the Obama administration in the December 2010 review. SOG/CTPT are also key to any exit strategy for the U.S. government to leave Afghanistan, while still being able to deny al-Qaeda and other trans-national extremists groups a safe haven both in Afghanistan and in the FATA of Pakistan.

In January 2013, a CIA drone strike killed Mullah Nazir, a senior Taliban commander in the South Waziristan area of Pakistan believed responsible for carrying out the insurgent effort against the U.S. military in Afghanistan. Nazir&#x27;s death degraded the Taliban.

The U.S. decided to lean heavily on CIA in general, and SAC specifically in their efforts to withdraw from Afghanistan as it did in Iraq. There are plans being considered to have several U.S. Military special operations elements assigned to CIA after the withdrawal. If so, there would still be a chance to rebuild and assist and coordinate (with Afghan ANSF commandos) and continue to keep a small footprint while allowing free elections and pushing back the Taliban/AQ forces that have failed but continue to attempt their taking back parts of the country, as they have had between 2015 through 2016.

The Trump administration doubled down on the covert war in Afghanistan by increasing the number of paramilitary officers from SAD fighting alongside and leading the Afghan &quot;CTPT&#x27;s&quot;, supported by &quot;Omega Teams&quot; from JSOC. Combined they are considered the most effective units in Afghanistan and the linchpin of the counter insurgency and counter-terrorism effort. The war has been largely turned over to SAC. On October 21, 2016, two senior paramilitary officers, &quot;Brian Hoke&quot; and &quot;Nate Delemarre&quot;, were killed during a CTPT operation in Jalalabad, Afghanistan. The two longtime friends were killed fighting side-by-side against the Taliban and buried next to each other at Arlington National Cemetery.

&quot;The New York Times&quot; reported in March 2020 that during the Trump administration&#x27;s negotiations with the Taliban on the peace agreement, several advocated for an increase in CIA paramilitary capability as the U.S. Military reduced its capability to compensate for that reduction.
The shift to a bigger role by the CIA was adamantly opposed by the Taliban, who threatened to withdraw from the talks. As a result, the idea was shelved. Many existing and former officials believed finding a way for the CIA and its paramilitary forces to continue to work with a new Afghan government was critical to the long-term survival of the deal and the counter-terrorism efforts in the region.

===Yemen===
On November 5, 2002, a missile launched from a CIA-controlled Predator drone killed al-Qaeda members traveling in a remote area in Yemen. SAD/SOG paramilitary teams had been on the ground tracking their movements for months and called in this air strike. One of those in the car was Ali Qaed Senyan al-Harthi, al-Qaeda&#x27;s chief operative in Yemen and a suspect in the October 2000 bombing of the destroyer . Five other people, believed to be low-level al-Qaeda members, were also killed including an American named Kamal Derwish. Former Deputy U.S. Defense Secretary Paul Wolfowitz called it &quot;a very successful tactical operation&quot; and said &quot;such strikes are useful not only in killing terrorists but in forcing al-Qaeda to change its tactics&quot;.

&quot;It&#x27;s an important step that has been taken in that it has eliminated another level of experienced leadership from al-Qaeda,&quot; said Vince Cannistraro, former head of counter-terrorism for the CIA and current ABC News consultant. &quot;It will help weaken the organization and make it much less effective.&quot; Harithi was on the run, pursued by several security forces who were looking for him and Muhammad Hamdi al-Ahdal, another suspect in the USS &quot;Cole&quot; bombing case.

In 2009, the Obama administration authorized continued lethal operations in Yemen by the CIA. As a result, the SAD/SOG and JSOC joined together to aggressively target al-Qaeda operatives in that country, both through leading Yemenese special forces and intelligence-driven drone strikes. A major target of these operations was Imam Anwar al-Awlaki, an American citizen with ties to both Nidal Hasan, the convicted Fort Hood attacker, and Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab, the Christmas 2009 attempted bomber of Northwest Airline flight 253. Imam al-Awlaki was killed on September 30, 2011, by an air attack carried out by the Joint Special Operations Command.

On January 31, 2020, &quot;The New York Times&quot; reported that three U.S. officials &quot;expressed confidence&quot; that Qasim al-Raymi, the emir of AQAP was killed by the CIA on January 25, in Al Abdiyah District, Ma&#x27;rib Governorate, Yemen. For more than five years, al-Raymi eluded U.S. forces as he led what experts referred to as al-Qaida&#x27;s &quot;most dangerous franchise.&quot; Former Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense Mick Mulroy said, if confirmed, his death would be &quot;very significant.&quot; Al-Raymi was the target of the January 29, 2017, special operations raid in which Navy SEAL Ryan Owens was killed. &quot;The U.S. never forgets,&quot; Mulroy said. &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; also reported al-Raymi attempted to blow up a U.S.-bound airliner on Christmas Day 2009. U.S. President Donald Trump appeared to confirm reports that the U.S. had killed al-Raymi, by retweeting reports claiming that the CIA had conducted the strike. Experts considered him a possible successor to Ayman al-Zawahiri, the leader of al-Qaeda overall.

===Iraq===
SAD paramilitary teams entered Northern Iraq before the 2003 invasion. Once on the ground, they prepared the battlespace for the subsequent arrival of U.S. military forces. SAD teams then combined with U.S. Army special forces (on a team called the Northern Iraq Liaison Element or NILE). This team organized the Kurdish Peshmerga for the subsequent U.S.-led invasion. This joint team combined in Operation Viking Hammer to defeat Ansar al-Islam, an Islamist group allied to al-Qaeda, which several battle-hardened fighters from Afghanistan had joined after the fall of the Taliban, in a battle for control over the northeast of Iraq—a battle that turned out being one of the &quot;most intense battles of Special Forces since Vietnam.&quot; This battle was for an entire territory that was completely occupied by Ansar al-Islam and was executed prior to the invasion in February 2003. If this battle had not been as successful as it was, there would have been a considerable hostile force in the rear of the U.S./secular Kurdish force in the subsequent assault on the Iraqi Army to the south. The U.S. side was represented by paramilitary operations officers from SAD/SOG and the Army&#x27;s 10th Special Forces Group (10th SFG). 10th SFG soldiers were awarded three Silver Stars and six Bronze Stars with V for valor for this battle alone and several paramilitary officers were awarded the Intelligence Star for valor in combat. This battle was a significant direct attack and victory on a key U.S. opponent. It resulted in the deaths of a substantial number of militants and the uncovering of a crude laboratory that had traces of poisons and information on chemical weapons at Sargat. The team found foreign identity cards, visas, and passports on the enemy bodies. They had come from a wide variety of Middle Eastern and North African countries, including Yemen, Sudan, Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Oman, Tunisia, Morocco, and Iran. Sargat was also the only facility that had traces of chemical weapons discovered in the Iraq war.

In a 2004 &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot; article, &quot;A firefight in the mountains,&quot; the author states:

Viking Hammer would go down in the annals of Special Forces history – a battle fought on foot, under sustained fire from an enemy lodged in the mountains, and with minimal artillery and air support.

SAD/SOG teams also conducted high-risk special reconnaissance missions behind Iraqi lines to identify senior leadership targets. These missions led to the initial assassination attempts against Iraqi President Saddam Hussein and his key generals. Although the initial air strike against Hussein was unsuccessful in killing the dictator, it was successful in effectively ending his ability to command and control his forces. Other strikes against key generals were successful and significantly degraded the command&#x27;s ability to react to and maneuver against the U.S.-led invasion force. SAD operations officers were also successful in convincing key Iraqi Army officers to surrender their units once the fighting started and/or not to oppose the invasion force.

NATO member Turkey refused to allow its territory to be used by the U.S. Army&#x27;s 4th Infantry Division for the invasion. As a result, the SAD/SOG, U.S. Army special forces joint teams, the Kurdish Peshmerga, and the 173d Airborne Brigade were the entire northern force against the Iraqi Army during the invasion. Their efforts kept the 13 divisions of the Iraqi Army in place to defend against the Kurds rather than allowing them to contest the coalition force coming from the south. This combined U.S. special operations and Kurdish force defeated the Iraqi Army. Four members of the SAD/SOG team received CIA&#x27;s rare Intelligence Star for &quot;extraordinary heroism&quot;.

The mission that captured Saddam Hussein was called &quot;Operation Red Dawn.&quot; It was planned and carried out by JSOC&#x27;s Delta Force and SAD/SOG teams (together called Task Force 121). The operation eventually included around 600 soldiers from the 1st Brigade of the 4th Infantry Division. Special operations troops probably numbered around 40. Much of the publicity and credit for the capture went to the 4th Infantry Division soldiers, but CIA and JSOC were the driving force. &quot;Task Force 121 were actually the ones who pulled Saddam out of the hole&quot; said Robert Andrews, former deputy assistant Secretary of Defense for special operations and low-intensity conflict. &quot;They can&#x27;t be denied a role anymore.&quot;

CIA paramilitary teams continued to assist JSOC in Iraq, and in 2007, the combination created a lethal force many credit with having a major impact in the success of &quot;the Surge&quot;. They did this by killing or capturing many of the key al-Qaeda leaders in Iraq. In a CBS &quot;60 Minutes&quot; interview, Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist Bob Woodward described a new special operations capability that allowed for this success. This capability was developed by the joint teams of CIA and JSOC. Several senior U.S. officials stated that the &quot;joint efforts of JSOC and CIA paramilitary units was the most significant contributor to the defeat of al-Qaeda in Iraq&quot;.
In May 2007, Marine Major Douglas A. Zembiec was serving in SAD/SOG Ground Branch in Iraq when he was killed by small arms fire while leading a raid with Iraq Special Forces. Reports from fellow paramilitary officers stated that the flash radio report sent was &quot;five wounded and one martyred&quot;. Major Zembiec was killed while trying to protect his soldiers, who were members of the Iraqi Army. He was honored with an Intelligence Star for his valor in combat.

On October 26, 2008, SAD/SOG and JSOC conducted an operation in Syria targeting the &quot;foreign fighter logistics network&quot; bringing al-Qaeda operatives into Iraq (See 2008 Abu Kamal raid). A U.S. source told CBS News that &quot;the leader of the foreign fighters, an al-Qaeda officer, was the target of Sunday&#x27;s cross-border raid.&quot; He said the attack was successful, but did not say whether the al-Qaeda officer was killed. Fox News later reported that Abu Ghadiya, &quot;al-Qa&#x27;ida&#x27;s senior coordinator operating in Syria&quot;, was killed in the attack. &quot;The New York Times&quot; reported that, during the raid, U.S. forces killed several armed males who &quot;posed a threat&quot;.

In September 2014, with the rise of the Islamic State, the U.S. government began aggressive military operations against them in both Iraq and Syria. SAD Ground Branch was placed in charge of the ground war. This is a testament to SAD being the preeminent force for unconventional warfare and their long-standing relationship with the most effective fighting force in the region, the Kurdish Peshmerga.

===Pakistan===
SAD/SOG has been very active &quot;on the ground&quot; inside Pakistan targeting al-Qaeda operatives for Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) Predator strikes and along with USSOCOM elements they have been training Pakistani paramilitary troops and regular Army troops, they have also done HVT target missions alongside Pakistani special forces. Before leaving office, President George W. Bush authorized SAD&#x27;s successful killing of eight senior al-Qaeda operatives via targeted air strikes. Among those killed were the mastermind of a 2006 plot to detonate explosives aboard planes flying across the Atlantic Rashid Rauf and the man thought to have planned the Islamabad Marriott Hotel bombing on September 20, 2008, that killed 53 people. The CIA Director authorized the continuation of these operations and on January 23, SAD/SOG performed killings of 20 individuals in northwestern Pakistan that were terrorists. Some experts assess that the CIA Director – at that time Leon Panetta – has been more aggressive in conducting paramilitary operations in Pakistan than his predecessor. A Pakistani security official stated that other strikes killed at least 10 insurgents, including five foreign nationals and possibly &quot;a high-value target&quot; such as a senior al-Qaeda or Taliban official. On February 14, the CIA drone killed 27 taliban and al-Qaeda fighters in a missile strike in south Waziristan, a militant stronghold near the Afghan border where al-Qaeda leaders Osama bin Laden and Ayman al-Zawahri were believed to be hiding.

According to the documentary film &quot;Drone&quot;, by Tonje Schei, since 2002 the U.S. Air Force 17th Reconnaissance Squadron has been working for the CIA as &quot;customer&quot;, carrying out at least some of the armed missions in Pakistan.

In a National Public Radio (NPR) report dated February 3, 2008, a senior official stated that al-Qaeda has been &quot;decimated&quot; by SAD/SOG&#x27;s air and ground operations. This senior U.S. counter-terrorism official goes on to say, &quot;The enemy is really, really struggling. These attacks have produced the broadest, deepest, and most rapid reduction in al-Qaida senior leadership that we&#x27;ve seen in several years.&quot; President Obama&#x27;s CIA Director Leon Panetta stated that SAD/SOG&#x27;s efforts in Pakistan have been &quot;the most effective weapon&quot; against senior al-Qaeda leadership.

These covert attacks have increased significantly under President Obama, with as many at 50 al-Qaeda militants being killed in the month of May 2009 alone. In June 2009, sixty Taliban fighters were killed while at a funeral to bury fighters that had been killed in previous CIA attacks. On July 22, 2009, National Public Radio reported that U.S. officials believe Saad bin Laden, a son of Osama bin Laden, was killed by a CIA strike in Pakistan. Saad bin Laden spent years under house arrest in Iran before traveling last year to Pakistan, according to former National Intelligence Director Mike McConnell. It&#x27;s believed he was killed sometime in 2009. A senior U.S. counter-terrorism said U.S. intelligence agencies are &quot;80 to 85 percent&quot; certain that Saad bin Laden is dead.

On August 6, 2009, the CIA announced that Baitullah Mehsud was killed by a SAD/SOG drone strike in Pakistan. &quot;The New York Times&quot; said, &quot;Although President Obama has distanced himself from many of the Bush administration&#x27;s counter-terrorism policies, he has embraced and even expanded the C.I.A.&#x27;s covert campaign in Pakistan using Predator and Reaper drones.&quot; The biggest loss may be to &quot;Osama bin Laden&#x27;s al-Qa&#x27;ida.&quot; For the past eight years, al-Qaeda had depended on Mehsud for protection after Mullah Mohammed Omar fled Afghanistan in late 2001. &quot;Mehsud&#x27;s death means the tent sheltering Al Qaeda has collapsed,&quot; an Afghan Taliban intelligence officer who had met Mehsud many times told Newsweek. &quot;Without a doubt he was Al Qaeda&#x27;s No. 1 guy in Pakistan,&quot; adds Mahmood Shah, a retired Pakistani Army brigadier and a former chief of the Federally Administered Tribal Area, or FATA, Mehsud&#x27;s base.

Airstrikes from CIA drones struck targets in the Federally Administered Tribal Areas (FATA) of Pakistan on September 8, 2009. Reports stated that seven to ten militants were killed to include one top al-Qaida leader. He was Mustafa al-Jaziri, an Algerian national described as an &quot;important and effective&quot; leader and senior military commander for al-Qaida. The success of these operations is believed to have caused senior Taliban leaders to significantly alter their operations and cancel key planning meetings.

The CIA also increased its campaign using Predator missile strikes on al-Qaeda in Pakistan. The number of strikes in 2009 exceeded the 2008 total, according to data compiled by the Long War Journal, which tracks strikes in Pakistan. In December 2009, &quot;The New York Times&quot; reported that President Obama ordered an expansion of the drone program with senior officials describing the program as &quot;a resounding success, eliminating key terrorists and throwing their operations into disarray&quot;. The article also cites a Pakistani official who stated that about 80 missile attacks in less than two years have killed &quot;more than 400&quot; enemy fighters, a number lower than most estimates but in the same range. His account of collateral damage was strikingly lower than many unofficial counts: &quot;We believe the number of civilian casualties is just over 20, and those were people who were either at the side of major terrorists or were at facilities used by terrorists.&quot;

On December 6, 2009, a senior al-Qaeda operative, Saleh al-Somali, was killed in a drone strike in Pakistan. He was responsible for their operations outside of the Afghanistan-Pakistan region and formed part of the senior leadership. Al-Somali was engaged in plotting terrorist acts around the world and &quot;given his central role, this probably included plotting attacks against the United States and Europe&quot;. On December 31, 2009, senior Taliban leader and strong Haqqani ally Haji Omar Khan, brother of Arif Khan, was killed in the strike along with the son of local tribal leader Karim Khan.

In January 2010, al-Qaeda in Pakistan announced that Lashkar al-Zil leader Abdullah Said al Libi was killed in a drone missile strike. Neither al-Qaeda nor the U.S. has revealed the date of the attack that killed Libi. On January 14, 2010, subsequent to the suicide attack at Camp Chapman, the CIA located and killed the senior Taliban leader in Pakistan, Hakimullah Mehsud. Mehsud had claimed responsibility in a video he made with the suicide bomber Humam Khalil Abu-Mulal al-Balawi.

On February 5, 2010, the Pakistani Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) and CIA&#x27;s SAD/SOG conducted a joint raid and apprehended Mullah Abdul Ghani Baradar. Baradar was the most significant Taliban figure to be detained since the beginning of the Afghan War more than eight years ago until that date. He ranked second to Mullah Muhammad Omar, the Taliban&#x27;s founder and was known to be a close associate of Osama bin Laden. Mullah Baradar was interrogated by CIA and ISI officers for several days before news of his capture was released. This capture sent the message that the Taliban leadership is not safe in Afghanistan or Pakistan. &quot;The seizure of the Afghan Taliban&#x27;s top military leader in Pakistan represents a turning point in the U.S.-led war against the militants&quot;, U.S. officials and analysts said. Per Pakistani Interior Minister Rehman Malik, several raids in Karachi in early February netted dozens of suspected Afghan militants. In other joint raids that occurred around the same time, Afghan officials said that the Taliban &quot;shadow governors&quot; for two provinces in northern Afghanistan had also been detained. Mullah Abdul Salam, the Taliban&#x27;s leader in Kunduz, and Mullah Mir Mohammed of Baghlan were captured in Akora Khattack.

On February 20, Muhammad Haqqani, son of Jalaluddin Haqqani, was one of four people killed in the drone strike in Pakistan&#x27;s tribal region in North Waziristan, according to two Pakistani intelligence sources.

On May 31, 2010, &quot;The New York Times&quot; reported that Mustafa Abu al Yazid (AKA Saeed al Masri), a senior operational leader for Al Qaeda, was killed in an American missile strike in Pakistan&#x27;s tribal areas.

From July to December 2010, predator strikes killed 535 suspected militants in the FATA to include Sheikh Fateh Al Misri, Al-Qaeda&#x27;s new third in command on September 25. Al Misri was planning a major terrorist attack in Europe by recruiting British Muslims who would then go on a shooting rampage similar to what transpired in Mumbai in November 2008.

====Operation Neptune Spear====

On May 1, 2011, President Barack Obama announced that Osama bin Laden had been killed earlier that day in Abbottabad, Pakistan by &quot;a small team of Americans&quot; acting under his direct orders during a CIA operation under Director Leon Panetta. The helicopter raid was executed from a CIA forward operating base in Afghanistan by the elements of the U.S. Naval Special Warfare Development Group (assigned to the CIA) and CIA paramilitary operatives.

The operation in the Bilal military cantonment area in the city of Abbottabad resulted in the acquisition of extensive intelligence on the future attack plans of al-Qaeda. Bin Laden&#x27;s body was flown to Afghanistan to be identified and then forwarded to the aircraft carrier for a burial at sea. Results from the DNA samples taken in Afghanistan were compared with those of a known relative of bin Laden&#x27;s and confirmed the identity.

The operation was a result of years of intelligence work that included the Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI), the CIA, the DSS, and the Delta Force&#x27;s apprehension and interrogation of Khalid Sheik Mohammad (KSM), the discovery of the real name of the courier disclosed by KSM, the tracking, via signal intelligence, of the courier to the Abbottobad compound by paramilitary operatives and the establishment of a CIA safe house that provided critical advance intelligence for the operation.

The material discovered in the raid indicated that bin Laden was still in charge of his Al-Qaeda organization and was developing plans and issuing orders at the time of his death. There is considerable controversy over claims that elements of the Pakistani government, particularly the ISI, may have been concealing the presence of Osama bin Laden in Pakistan. Bin Laden&#x27;s death has been labeled a &quot;game changer&quot; and a fatal blow to Al-Qaeda, by senior U.S. officials.

===Iran===
In the early 1950s, the Central Intelligence Agency and Britain&#x27;s Secret Intelligence Service were ordered to overthrow the democratically-elected government of Iran, Prime Minister Mohammed Mosaddeq, and re-install deposed Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi. This event was called Operation Ajax. The senior CIA officer was Kermit Roosevelt, Jr., the grandson of American president Theodore Roosevelt. The operation utilized all of SAC&#x27;s components to include political action, covert influence, and paramilitary operations. The paramilitary component included training anti-Communist guerrillas to fight the Tudeh Party if &quot;they&quot; seized power in the chaos of Operation Ajax. Although a significant tactical/operational success, Operation Ajax is considered very controversial with many critics.

In November 1979, a group of Islamist students and militants took over the American embassy in support of the Iranian Revolution. Operation Eagle Claw was the unsuccessful United States military operation that attempted to rescue the 52 hostages from the U.S. Embassy in Tehran, Iran on April 24, 1980. Several SAC/SOG teams infiltrated into Tehran to support this operation.

On March 9, 2007, the alleged CIA officer Robert Levinson was kidnapped from Iran&#x27;s Kish Island. On July 7, 2008, Pulitzer Prize winning investigative journalist and author Seymour Hersh wrote an article in the &quot;New Yorker&quot; stating that the Bush administration had signed a Presidential Finding authorizing the CIA to begin cross border paramilitary operations from Iraq and Afghanistan into Iran. These operations would be against Quds Force, the commando arm of the Iranian Revolutionary Guard, public and private sector strategic targets, and &quot;high-value targets&quot; in the war on terror. Also enrolled to support CIA objectives were the Mujahideen-e-Khalq, known in the West as the M.E.K., and the Baluchis insurgents. &quot;The Finding was focused on undermining Iran&#x27;s nuclear ambitions and trying to undermine the government through regime change,&quot; a person familiar with its contents said, and involved &quot;working with opposition groups and passing money.&quot; Any significant effort against Iran by the Obama administration would likely come directly from SAC. and in July 2010, Director Panetta chose a former chief of SAC as the new NCS Director. Levinson reportedly died in 2020 (or before), while in Iranian custody.

===Libya===
After the Arab Spring movements overthrew the rulers of Tunisia and Egypt, its neighbors to the west and east respectively, Libya had a major revolt beginning in February 2011. In response, the Obama administration sent in SAC paramilitary operatives to assess the situation and gather information on the opposition forces. Experts speculated that these teams could have been determining the capability of these forces to defeat the Muammar Gaddafi regime and whether Al-Qaeda had a presence in these rebel elements.

U.S. officials had made it clear that no U.S. troops would be &quot;on the ground&quot;, making the use of covert paramilitary operatives the only alternative. During the early phases of the Libyan offensive of U.S.-led air strikes, paramilitary operatives assisted in the recovery of a U.S. Air Force pilot who had crashed due to mechanical problems. There was speculation that President Obama issued a covert action finding in March 2011 that authorized the CIA to carry out a clandestine effort to provide arms and support to the Libyan opposition.

===Syria===

The 2008 Abu Kamal raid was a helicopter-borne raid conducted by paramilitary officers from Special Activities Division and United States Special Operations Command, Joint Special Operations Command inside Syrian territory on October 26, 2008. The Syrian government called the event a &quot;criminal and terrorist&quot; attack on its sovereignty, alleging all of the reported eight fatalities were civilians. An unnamed U.S. military source, however, alleges that the target was a network of foreign fighters who planned to travel through Syria to join the Iraqi insurgency against the United States-led Coalition in Iraq and the Iraqi government.

In early September 2013, President Obama told U.S. senators that the CIA had trained the first 50-man insurgent element and that they had been inserted into Syria. The deployment of this unit and the supplying of weapons may be the first tangible measure of support since the U.S. stated they would begin providing assistance to the opposition. In October 2013, SAC was tasked with supporting moderate Syrian rebels to help engineer a stalemate and political settlement in the Syrian civil war. This program was considered too limited to have the desired outcome.

With the rise of the Islamic State, however, SAC was given the overall command and control of the ground fight against them. This fight crossed borders between Iraq and Syria.

Again in 2015, the combination of the U.S. Military&#x27;s JSOC and the CIA&#x27;s Special Activities Center became the force of choice for fighting this conflict. SAC stood up and ran a robust covert action program to overthrown the Assad regime. The program was successful, including in 2015 when rebels using tank-destroying missiles routed government forces in northern Syria. But by late 2015, the Russians came to Assad&#x27;s aid, and their focus was focusing squarely on the C.I.A.-backed fighters battling Syrian government troops. Many of the fighters were killed, and the fortunes of the rebel army reversed. According to the Middle East Institute, the program was never given the level of political support that was necessary for it to succeed – &quot;They never gave it the necessary resources or space to determine the dynamics of the battlefield. They were drip-feeding opposition groups just enough to survive but never enough to become dominant actors.&quot;

In December 2018, US President Donald Trump announced that US troops involved in the fight against the Islamic State (ISIS) in northeast Syria would be withdrawn imminently. Trump&#x27;s surprise decision overturned Washington&#x27;s policy in the Middle East. It also fueled the ambitions and anxieties of local and regional actors vying over the future shape of Syria. Many experts proposed that President Trump could mitigate the damage of his withdrawal of U.S. military forces from Syria by using SAC. Many believed the president chose &quot;to replace U.S. ground forces in Syria with personnel from the CIA&#x27;s Special Activities Division and that the process has been underway for months. Already experienced in operations in Syria, the CIA has numerous paramilitary officers who have the skills to operate independently in harm&#x27;s way. And while the CIA lacks the numbers to replace all 2,000 U.S. military personnel currently in Syria&quot; and work alongside the Syrian Democratic Forces (these CIA personnel are spread across the world), their model is based on fewer enablers and support.

====Operation Kayla Mueller====

On October 26, 2019, U.S. Joint Special Operations Command&#x27;s (JSOC) Delta Force conducted a raid into the Idlib province of Syria on the border with Turkey that resulted in the death of Ibrahim Awad Ibrahim Ali al-Badri al-Samarrai also known as Abū Bakr al-Baghdadi. The raid was launched based on a CIA Special Activities Division&#x27;s intelligence collection and close target reconnaissance effort that located the leader of ISIS. Launched after midnight local time, the eight helicopters carrying the teams along with support aircraft crossed hundreds of miles of airspace controlled by Iraq, Turkey and Russia. Upon arrival, efforts were made for Baghdadi to surrender, with those efforts unsuccessful. U.S. forces responded by blowing a large hole into the side of the compound. After entering, the compound was cleared, with people either surrendering or being shot and killed. The two-hour raid culminated with Baghdadi fleeing from U.S. forces into a dead-end tunnel and detonating a suicide vest, killing himself and two of his children. The complex operation was conducted during the withdrawal of U.S. forces from northeast Syria, adding to the complexity.

===United States===
In 1967, the SAD was involved with the CIA&#x27;s domestic espionage operation Project MERRIMAC in conjunction with the Office of Security. SAD reported approval of the project to the office and reported that the CIA had assets in the area that could be used to monitor and infiltrate Washington-based anti-war groups that might pose potential threats to the CIA. In addition, the SAD Chief provided reports of findings to the SRS. Many documents related to MERRIMAC were destroyed by the CIA in compliance with a recommendation from the Rockefeller Commission to destroy files, not in compliance with new rules.

==Worldwide mission==
The CIA has always had a Special Activities Center, which secretly carries out special operations missions. Since September 11, 2001, however, the U.S. government has relied much more on SAC/SOG because fighting terrorists does not usually involve fighting other armies. Rather, it involves secretly moving in and out of countries like Iran, Somalia, etc., where the American military is not legally allowed to operate. If there are missions in these countries that are denied to U.S. military special operations forces, SAC/SOG units are the primary national special missions units to execute those operations.

In the War on Terror, SAC has the lead in the covert war being waged against al Qaeda. SAC/SOG paramilitary teams have apprehended many of the senior leaders. These include: Abu Zubaydah, the chief of operations for al-Qaeda; Ramzi bin al-Shibh, the so-called &quot;20th hijacker&quot;; Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, the mastermind of the September 11, 2001 attacks on New York City and Washington, D.C.; Abd al-Rahim al-Nashiri, alleged to be the mastermind of the USS &quot;Cole&quot; bombing and leader of al Qaeda operations in the Persian Gulf prior to his capture in November 2002; Abu Faraj al-Libi, al Qaeda&#x27;s &quot;field general&quot; believed to have taken the role of No. 3 in al Qaeda following the capture of Khalid Sheikh Mohammed in Pakistan; and Mullah Abdul Ghani Baradar, the number two Taliban commander and the highest level Taliban commander apprehended in the Afghan War. Prior to the beginning of the &quot;War on Terror&quot;, SAC/SOG located and captured many notable militants and international criminals, including Abimael Guzmán and Carlos the Jackal. These were just two of the over 50 caught by SAC/SOG just between 1983 and 1995.

In 2002, the George W. Bush administration prepared a list of &quot;terrorist leaders&quot; the CIA is authorized to kill in a targeted killing if capture is impractical and civilian casualties can be kept to an acceptable number. The list included key al-Qaeda leaders like Ayman al-Zawahiri and, formerly, his predecessor Osama bin Laden. The list also includes principal leaders of groups affiliated with al-Qaeda. This list is called the &quot;high value target list&quot;. The U.S. president is not legally required to approve each name added to the list, nor is the CIA required to obtain presidential approval for specific attacks, although the president is kept well informed about operations.

SAC/SOG teams have been dispatched to the country of Georgia, where dozens of al Qaeda fugitives from Afghanistan are believed to have taken refuge with Chechen separatists and thousands of refugees in the Pankisi Gorge. Their efforts have already resulted in 15 Arab militants linked to al Qaeda being captured.

The SAC/SOG teams have also been active in the Philippines, where 1,200 U.S. military advisers helped to train local soldiers in &quot;counter-terrorist operations&quot; against Abu Sayyaf, a radical Islamist group suspected of ties with al Qaeda. Little is known about this U.S. covert action program, but some analysts believe that &quot;the CIA&#x27;s paramilitary wing, the Special Activities Division (SAD) [referring to SAC&#x27;s previous name], has been allowed to pursue terrorist suspects in the Philippines on the basis that its actions will never be acknowledged.&quot;

On July 14, 2009, several newspapers reported that DCIA Leon Panetta was briefed on a CIA program that had not been briefed to the oversight committees in Congress. Panetta canceled the initiative and reported its existence to Congress and the President. The program consisted of teams of SAC paramilitary officers organized to execute targeted killing operations against al Qaeda operatives around the world in any country. According to the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;, DCIA Panetta &quot;has not ruled out reviving the program.&quot; There is some question as to whether former Vice President Dick Cheney instructed the CIA not to inform Congress. Per senior intelligence officers, this program was an attempt to avoid the civilian casualties that can occur during Predator drone strikes using Hellfire missiles.

According to many experts, the Obama administration has relied on the CIA and their paramilitary capabilities, even more than they have on U.S. military forces, to maintain the fight against terrorists in the Afghanistan and Pakistan region, as well as places like Yemen, Somalia and North Africa. Ronald Kessler states in his book &quot;The CIA at War: Inside the Secret War Against Terror&quot;, that although paramilitary operations are a strain on resources, they are winning the war against terrorism.

SAC/SOG paramilitary officers executed the clandestine evacuation of U.S. citizens and diplomatic personnel in Somalia, Iraq (during the Persian Gulf War) and Liberia during periods of hostility, as well as the insertion of Paramilitary Operations Officers prior to the entry of U.S. military forces in every conflict since World War II. SAC officers have operated covertly since 1947 in places such as North Korea, Vietnam, Laos, Cambodia, Lebanon, Iran, Syria, Libya, Iraq, El Salvador, Guatemala, Colombia, Mexico, Nicaragua, Honduras, Chile, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Serbia, Somalia, Kosovo, Afghanistan and Pakistan.

In the Trump administration, SAC has begun deploying small units of paramilitary officers worldwide to track down terrorists, and they have been given the primary lead for CT operations in Afghanistan.

In 2019, Pulitzer Prize finalist Annie Jacobsen&#x27;s book, &quot;Surprise, Kill, Vanish: The Secret History of CIA Paramilitary Armies, Operators, and Assassins&quot; was released. The author refers to CIA&#x27;s Special Activities Division as &quot;a highly-classified branch of the CIA and the most effective, black operations force in the world.&quot; She further states that every American president since World War II has asked the CIA to conduct sabotage, subversion and assassination.

==Innovations in special operations==
The Fulton surface-to-air recovery system (STARS) is a system developed in the early 1950s by CIA paramilitary officers for retrieving persons from the ground with a MC-130E Combat Talon I aircraft. It uses a harness and a self-inflating balloon that carries an attached lift line. An MC-130E engages the line with its V-shaped yoke, and the individual is reeled on board. Project COLDFEET was a very successful mission in 1962 in which two military officers parachuted into a remote abandoned Soviet site in the Arctic. The two were subsequently extracted by the Fulton sky hook. The team gathered evidence of advanced research on acoustical systems to detect under-ice U.S. submarines and efforts to develop Arctic anti-submarine warfare techniques.

Sergeant Major (SgtMaj) Billy Waugh was a Special Forces soldier attached to the CIA in the 1960s. During his time at MACV-SOG in Vietnam, he developed and conducted the first combat High Altitude-Low Opening (HALO) jump. A practice combat infiltration was conducted in October 1970 by Recon Team Florida into the North Vietnamese held &quot;War Zone D&quot;, in South Vietnam, the first such drop into a combat zone. HALO is a method of delivering personnel, equipment, and supplies from a transport aircraft at a high altitude via free-fall parachute insertion. HALO and HAHO (High Altitude-High Opening) are also known as Military Free Fall (MFF). In the HALO technique, the parachutist opens his parachute at a low altitude after free-falling for a period of time to avoid detection by the enemy. Waugh also led the last combat special reconnaissance parachute insertion into enemy territory occupied by communist North Vietnamese Army (NVA) troops on June 22, 1971.

==CIA Memorial Wall==

The CIA Memorial Wall is located at CIA headquarters in Langley, Virginia. It honors CIA employees who died in the line of duty. There are 140 stars carved into the marble wall, each one representing an officer. A majority of these were paramilitary officers. A black book, called the &quot;Book of Honor&quot;, lies beneath the stars and is encased in an inch-thick plate of glass. Inside this book are stars, arranged by year of death, and the names of 91 employees who died in CIA service alongside them. The other names remain secret, even in death.

Third Option Foundation (TOF) is a national non-profit organization set up to support the families of fallen paramilitary officers. The name refers to the motto of CIA&#x27;s Special Activities Center: &quot;Tertia Optio&quot;, the President&#x27;s third option when military force is inappropriate and diplomacy is inadequate. TOF provides comprehensive family resiliency programs, financial support for the families of paramilitary officers killed in action, and it works behind the scenes to &quot;quietly help those who quietly serve.&quot;

<text>Göschenen (, ) is a village and municipality in the canton of Uri in Switzerland. It sits at the northern end of the Gotthard tunnel. The Göschenen riots (1875) saw Urner troops opening fire on Italian miners demonstrating for better working conditions and wages on the tunnel&#x27;s construction site.

==Name==
Göschenen is first mentioned in 1280 as &quot;Gesschenden&quot;. The name is from Rumantsch &quot;*cascina&quot; (modern &quot;caschigna&quot;) &quot;alpine hut&quot;, from Latin &quot;capsum&quot; &quot;corral&quot;, but influenced by the word for cheese, &quot;cascio&quot;. The &quot;e&quot; in the first syllable is due to Germanic i-umlaut, changed to &quot;ö&quot; in modern spelling is a hypercorrection based on the phonology of the dialect of Uri.

<doc id="740240" wikidata="Q923950" url="?curid=740240" title="Ruddy-headed goose">
<text>The ruddy-headed goose (Chloephaga rubidiceps) is a species of waterfowl in tribe Tadornini of subfamily Anserinae. It is found in Argentina, Chile, and the Falkland Islands.

==Taxonomy and systematics==

The ruddy-headed goose is monotypic.

==Description==

The ruddy-headed goose is long. Males weigh and females . Adults have the same plumage. Their heads and necks are red-brown, their back, breast, and flanks gray and buff with brown barring, their belly cinnamon, and their tail black. Their wing&#x27;s upperside is gray and the underside gray, black, and white. Their bill is black and the legs and feet orange with black markings. Juveniles are similar to adults but duller overall.

==Distribution and habitat==

The ruddy-headed goose is found in the eastern Chilean and Argentinian parts of Tierra del Fuego and north from there to Buenos Aires Province, Argentina. It is also found on the Falkland Islands. It inhabits open landscapes such as meadows, Pampas wetlands, the borders of ponds, and coastal grasslands.

==Behavior==
===Movement===

Ruddy-headed geese are year-round residents of the Falkland Islands, though they make local movements there. The species nests in Tierra del Fuego and far southern mainland Argentina and for the winter migrates north from there as far as Argentina&#x27;s Buenos Aires Province.

===Feeding===

The ruddy-headed goose is almost entirely vegetarian and feeds mostly on the ground rather than in water. On the breeding grounds its diet is small berries and the roots, leaves, stems, and seeds of grasses and sedges. During winter it feeds on young wheat and in harvested fields of maize, sunflower, and sorghum.

===Breeding===

The ruddy-headed goose&#x27;s breeding season begins as early as September on the Falkland Islands and in mid-October on the mainland. It nests singly or in small loose groups. Nests are placed in long grass or amid boulders and are lined with down. The clutch size is three to eight eggs. Males guard females during the incubation period of about 30 days. The time to fledging is not known.
===Vocalization===

Male and female ruddy-headed geese have different vocalizations: Males make a &quot;short, whistled &#x27;seep&#x27;&quot; and females a &quot;short rasping quack&quot;.

==Status==

The IUCN has assessed the ruddy-headed goose as being of Least Concern, though its population size is unknown and believed to be decreasing. The population in the Falklands appears robust but that in Tierra del Fuego and mainland South America may be only a few hundred birds after major decline in the 20th century. A major cause of the crash is predation by the South American gray fox, which was introduced to Tierra del Fuego in the 1950s to control rabbits. A Memorandum of Understanding was negotiated in 2006 with Argentina and Chile under the Bonn Convention in an attempt to safeguard the remaining migratory Tierra del Fuego/mainland population.

<doc id="740243" wikidata="Q7847469" url="?curid=740243" title="True Love Story">
<text>is a series of four dating sims. &quot;True Love Story&quot; and True Love Story 2 were released by ASCII for the PlayStation. True Love Story 3 and True Love Story: Summer Days, and yet... were released by Enterbrain for the PlayStation 2.

The &quot;True Love Story&quot; land are notable for their &quot;gekō&quot; (下校), or &quot;walk-home&quot; system. When the player asks a girl to walk home with him from school, the game enters a special conversation mode. In this mode, in addition to the usual long-term, strategic &quot;love meter&quot;, the girl you are conversing with has a short-term, tactical &quot;heartthrob meter&quot; representing her level of immediate interest in the conversation with you. The player is given the choice of approximately 30 topics of conversation to choose from, and the heartthrob meter will increase or decrease based on the appropriateness of his selections. High heartthrob can then be leveraged to ask the girl out on a date, or simply to effect a permanent increase in her love meter.

Later &quot;True Love Story&quot; games added further complexity to this system, such as a &quot;combo&quot; system measuring the number of consecutive good choices of conversation topics. In large part because of this system, &quot;True Love Story&quot; is one of the most gameplay-rich dating sims.

An OVA based on the True Love Story; Summer Days, and yet... story was released in 2003. It was 3 episodes long.

==Games==
There have been 6 installments in the True Love Story. All of them have been developed by ASCII except True Story 3 and Summer Days, which were released by Enterbrain.

===Main series===
*True Love Story (PS: 1996, re-released on 1998): Player is a high school student who can pursue 9 heroines.
*True Love Story 2 (PS: 1999): Player can pursue 13 heroines, including his sister.

<text>John Alfred Osborne (27 May 1935 – 2 January 2011) was a chief minister of Montserrat.

He first came to that position in November 1978, as a member of the People&#x27;s Liberation Movement, and continued until losing legislative council elections on 10 October 1991. By 2001 he had switched parties, joining the New People&#x27;s Liberation Movement. Under his leadership, the NPLM won 7 of 9 seats in legislative council elections on 2 April 2001, and he served as chief minister from 5 April 2001 until 3 June 2006 when he resigned after elections in which his party was defeated. A major issue for his government has been the continuing recovery of the island of Montserrat after a volcanic eruption which devastated the southern part of the island, burying the capital city of Plymouth in ash and forcing its population to flee, in many cases off the island due to lack of housing. The eruption, which began in July 1995, continues today on a vastly reduced scale, the damage being confined to Plymouth and the surrounding areas. , a new airport and docking facilities have opened and Montserratians and tourists alike are beginning to return.

In July 2008, Gerald&#x27;s Airport in Montserrat was renamed John A. Osborne Airport in his honour. His daughter Shirley Osborne is the Speaker of the Legislative Assembly of Montserrat.

<doc id="740253" wikidata="Q684927" url="?curid=740253" title="Gotthard Road Tunnel">
<text>The Gotthard Road Tunnel in Switzerland runs from Göschenen in the canton of Uri at its northern portal, to Airolo in Ticino to the south, and is in length below the St Gotthard Pass, a major pass of the Alps. At time of construction, in 1980, it was the longest road tunnel in the world; it is currently the fifth-longest. Although it is a motorway tunnel, part of the A2 from Basel to Chiasso, it consists of only one bidirectional tube with two lanes. With a maximum elevation of at the tunnel&#x27;s highest point, the A2 motorway has the lowest maximum elevation of any direct north-south road through the Alps.

The tunnel rises from the northern portal at Göschenen () and the culminating point is reached after approximately . After from the northern portal there is the border between the cantons of Uri and Ticino; after another , the tunnel ends at the southern portal near Airolo (). The journey takes about 13 minutes by car, the maximum speed being .

The Gotthard Road Tunnel is one of the three tunnels that connect the Swiss Plateau to southern Switzerland and run under the Gotthard Massif, the two other being railway tunnels, the Gotthard Tunnel (1882) and the Gotthard Base Tunnel (2016). All three tunnels bypass the Gotthard Pass, an important trade route since the 13th century. The pass road culminates about above the tunnel, at a height of , and is only passable in summer.

== History ==
In response to the automobile boom in Switzerland and other things, the Swiss government gave approval in July 1969 for the construction of the Gotthard Road tunnel. The tunnel would be longer than any existing road tunnel, and would provide a year-round road link from the Swiss Plateau to southern Switzerland, and from northern to southern Europe as well, to be used in place of the Gotthard Pass. The tunnel was built roughly parallel to the old railway tunnel, with portals a few hundred metres away from those of the railway. Prior to the opening of the tunnel, cars were transported through the nearby railway tunnel on car shuttle trains. Following the catastrophic fire in the road tunnel in 2001, car shuttle trains resumed operations for a few weeks.

The tunnel was opened on 5 September 1980. It remains a single bore tunnel with just one lane operating in each direction. It has four large ventilation shafts and an additional side gallery between from the main tunnel, having its own independent ventilation system in order to facilitate the cutting of a second tunnel, should future traffic levels require it.

On 11 September 2023, the tunnel was temporarily closed after a crack was discovered on the ceiling. The tunnel reopened on 14 September.

=== 2001 collision and fire ===
On 24 October 2001, a collision of two trucks created a fire in the tunnel, killing eleven and injuring many more, the smoke and gases from the fires being the main cause of death. The tunnel was closed for two months after the accident for repair and cleaning, reopening 21 December 2001. Since the fire, no more than 150 trucks per hour are allowed to enter the tunnel.

=== Planned second road tunnel ===
In March 2014, the Swiss Government approved a bill to allow the building of a second road tunnel. Construction was scheduled to start in 2020, with the cost estimated at almost . Construction on a second, parallel road tunnel was started. In first instance it was only built for safety: an escape route in case of accidents. This second tunnel is now to be built out to a full road tunnel, potentially allowing four lanes of traffic. Efforts to do this initially failed, blocked by political resistance. The Alpine Initiative &quot;for the protection of the Alpine region from transit traffic&quot;, which raised barriers against road tunnel construction, was initially blocked by the Swiss Parliament. A February 1994 Alpine Initiative passed (with 52% of the vote), and Parliament upheld the referendum twice through the 1990s. The pro-tunnel Avanti Initiative brought a referendum to voters in February 2004, which was rejected (by 62.8%).

The Swiss government announced in September 2013 it had approved a plan to upgrade the second tunnel into a full road tunnel in order to allow for the necessary reconstruction of the first road tunnel. Once the works on the first tunnel are finished, the Swiss government plans to operate one single lane in each tunnel (northbound traffic in the newly constructed tunnel, southbound traffic in the renovated one) in order to maintain the current tunnel overall capacity, in compliance with the Swiss constitutional norm that forbids a further growth of the traffic capacity across the Alps. 

The reconstruction would have lasted for several years in any variant – one variant would push the traffic over the mountain pass, another proposed to load the vehicles onto trains with a new terminal, a third would close the tunnel for several months every year over time range of a decade. All of these have their drawbacks and the usage of the second tunnel was chosen as the best option to allow for the reconstruction. Further usage of both tunnels was subject to a popular referendum that was held in February 2016, where it was approved. The actual upgrade mining of the second road tunnel was planned to last from 2020 to 2027 at a cost of 2.7 billion francs for the whole project including the following reconstruction of the first tunnel. 

Work on an access tunnel started in September 2021, and a major contract for the project was awarded in August 2022. A joint venture between Frutiger, Implenia and Webuild &amp; CSC SA were hired to construct the new tube and a parallel access tunnel. , the access tunnel was under construction, while work on the road tunnel was to commence in 2025. The works are scheduled to be completed in 2029. The original tunnel will then close for refurbishment, reopening alongside the new tunnel upon completion of the improvement project in 2032.

== Rail tunnels ==
The Gotthard Rail Tunnel, close to but separate from the expressway tunnel, handles rail traffic on the north-south line in Switzerland. It was opened in 1882, at the time the world&#x27;s longest tunnel, though later superseded by longer tunnels, some over long.

Under construction since 2002 and opened on 1 June 2016, the Gotthard Base Tunnel (a second rail tunnel, long), is the world&#x27;s longest. It was built for the use of trains travelling from northern Switzerland to the Ticino area and beyond.

== Road conditions ==
The Gotthard Tunnel is the core and culminating point of the A2 motorway in Switzerland, running south from Basel through the tunnel down to Chiasso on the border with Italy. Traffic flows through only one tunnel, which carries traffic both ways, with each direction allocated one lane. The tunnel&#x27;s speed limit is .

Heavily used, the tunnel often has traffic jams during peak holiday seasons over Easter and summer, on both the north and south ends. In contrast, another tunnel through the Alps, the San Bernardino road tunnel as part of the A13 in the canton of Graubünden further east, is relatively uncongested and shorter.

<text>ISO 6709, &quot;Standard representation of geographic point location by coordinates&quot;, is the international standard for representation of latitude, longitude and altitude for geographic point locations.

The first edition () was developed by ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 32. Later the standard was transferred to ISO/TC211, &quot;Geographic information/Geomatics&quot; in 2001. The committee completely revised the second edition (). There was a short technical corrigendum () released in 2009.
The third edition was published in 2022.

The second edition consists of a main part and eight annexes (Annexes A through H). The main part and Annexes A and C give encoding-independent general rules to define items to specify geographic point(s). Annex D suggests a display style for human interface. Annexes F and G suggest styles of XML expression. Annex H suggests string expression, which supersedes the first edition of the standard.

== General rules ==

=== Items ===
A geographical point is specified by the following four items:
* First horizontal position coordinate (&quot;Φ&quot; or &quot;y&quot;), such as latitude (negative number south of equator and positive north of equator)
* Second horizontal coordinate (&quot;λ&quot; or &quot;x&quot;), such as longitude (negative values west of Prime Meridian and positive values east of Prime Meridian)
* Vertical coordinate, i.e. height or depth (optional)
* Identification of coordinate reference system (CRS) (optional)

The first three items are numerical values called coordinates. The CRS gives the relationship between the coordinates and a point on the earth. The identification of CRS could be a full description of properties defined in ISO 19111; only an identifier given by some registry (such as EPSG) is used in most cases, since only such identification is enough for most information exchange purposes.

=== Order, sign, and units ===
Order, positive direction, and units of coordinates are supposed to be defined by the CRS. When CRS identification is missing, the data must be interpreted by the following conventions:
* Latitude comes before longitude
* North latitude is positive
* East longitude is positive
* Fraction of degrees (decimal degrees) is preferred in digital data exchange, while sexagesimal notation is tolerated for compatibility

There is no such interpretation rule for vertical coordinates.

== Representation at the human interface (Annex D) ==
When there is no guideline given from the user community, the following styles are suggested:

# Coordinate values (latitude, longitude, and altitude) should be delimited by spaces.
# The decimal point is a part of the value, thus must usually be configured by the operating system.
# Multiple locations should be represented by multiple lines.
# Latitude and longitude should be displayed by sexagesimal fractions (i.e. minutes and seconds).
# When minutes and seconds are less than ten, leading zeroes should be shown.
# Degree, minutes and seconds should be followed by the symbols ° (U+00B0), ′ (U+2032), and ″ (U+2033), without spaces between the number and symbol.
# North and south latitudes should be indicated by &quot;N&quot; and &quot;S&quot; following immediately after the digits.
# East and west longitudes should be indicated by &quot;E&quot; and &quot;W&quot; following immediately after the digits.
# Units of elevation or depth should be given by symbols, immediately after the digits.
# Elevation below zero-level reference or depth above reference level should be indicated by a minus sign − (U+2212).

Examples:
* 50°40′46″N 95°48′26″W 123.45m
* 50°03′46″S 125°48′26″E 978.90m

The standard does not specify how coordinates at the equator, prime meridian or antimeridian should be written.

== XML representation (Annex F) ==
The XML representation based on the conceptual model of Annex C uses XML namespace http://www.isotc211.org/2006/gpl. However, there is no published XML schema at the time of writing (August 2011).
&lt;gpl:GPL_CoordinateTuple xmlns:gpl=&quot;http://www.isotc211.org/gpl&quot;&gt;
 &lt;gpl:tuple srsName=&quot;urn:ogc:def:crs:EPSG:6.6:4326&quot;&gt;
 35.89421911 139.94637467
 &lt;/gpl:tuple&gt;
&lt;/gpl:GPL_CoordinateTuple&gt;
== String expression (Annex H) ==
A string expression of a point consists of latitude, longitude, height or depth, CRS identifier, and trailing solidus (codice_1) without any delimiting character. When height or depth is used, there must be CRS identifier.

=== Latitude ===
Latitude is a number preceded by a sign character. A plus sign (codice_2) denotes northern hemisphere or the equator, and a minus sign (codice_3) denotes southern hemisphere.

The integer part of the number is a fixed length. The number of digits in that part indicates the units, thus leading zero(es) must be filled when necessary. The fractional part must have the appropriate number of digits to represent the required precision of the coordinate.

=== Longitude ===
Longitude is a number preceded by a sign character. A plus sign (codice_2) denotes east longitude or the prime meridian, and a minus sign (codice_3) denotes west longitude or 180° meridian (opposite of the prime meridian).

Rules about the number of digits are the same as for latitude.

=== Height or depth ===
* When height or depth is present, CRS identifier must follow.
* Positive direction and units are defined by CRS.
* Negative number does not necessarily mean position below reference level.
* Positive is up for height, down for depth.

=== CRS identifier ===

The CRS identifier begins with &quot;CRS&quot;. There are three styles:

# When a registry provides online resolver, CRS&lt;&quot;url&quot;&gt;
# When a registry is offline, CRSr&quot;egistry&quot;:&quot;crsid&quot;
# When the data creator provides full definition of CRS using ISO 19111, CRS&lt;&quot;CRSID&quot;&gt;

The example of original Annex H always use &quot;CRSWGS_84&quot;.

===Examples===
* Atlantic Ocean +00-025/
* France +46+002/
** Paris +48.52+002.20/
*** Eiffel Tower +48.8577+002.295/
* Mount Everest +27.5916+086.5640+8850CRSWGS_84/
* North Pole +90+000/
* Pacific Ocean +00-160/
* South Pole -90+000+2800CRSWGS_84/
* United States +38-097/
** New York City +40.75-074.00/
*** Statue of Liberty +40.6894-074.0447/

<doc id="740276" wikidata="Q1592638" url="?curid=740276" title="Heavy Traffic">
<text>Heavy Traffic is a 1973 American live-action/adult animated drama film written and directed by Ralph Bakshi. The film, which begins, ends, and occasionally combines with live-action, explores the often surreal fantasies of a young New York City cartoonist named Michael Corleone, using pinball imagery as a metaphor for inner-city life. &quot;Heavy Traffic&quot; was Bakshi and producer Steve Krantz&#x27;s follow-up to the film &quot;Fritz the Cat&quot;. Though producer Krantz made varied attempts to produce an R-rated film, &quot;Heavy Traffic&quot; was given an X rating by the MPAA. The film received largely positive reviews and is widely considered to be Bakshi&#x27;s biggest critical success.

==Plot==
The film begins in live-action, introducing Michael Corleone, a 22-year-old virgin, who plays pinball in New York City while asking himself philosophical questions before envisioning an animated and dangerous New York neighborhood. Michael&#x27;s Italian father, Angelo &quot;Angie&quot; Corleone, is a struggling mafioso who frequently cheats on Michael&#x27;s Jewish mother, Ida.

The couple constantly bicker and try to kill each other at every opportunity. The unemployed Michael dabbles in cartoons and often wanders throughout the city to avoid family skirmishes and to artistically feed off the grubbiness of his environment. He regularly hangs out at a local bar where he gets free drinks from the black bartender, Carole, in exchange for sketches, which results in Shorty, Carole&#x27;s violent, legless bouncer devotee, becoming jealous.

One of the regular customers at the bar, the cross-dressing Snowflake, gets beaten up by a tough drunk in a hard hat named Bongo after he discovers that Snowflake is a man and not a woman like he first thought. Snowflake loves the beating due to his masochism, but the drunk causes property damage. Shorty throws Bongo out and then brutally kills him soon after, while the bar&#x27;s white manager abusively confronts Carole over this; provoking her into quitting.

Shorty offers to let Carole stay at his place, but not wanting to get involved with him, Carole tells Shorty that she&#x27;s staying with Michael. Meanwhile, Angie manages a strike at a mob-controlled factory, but when he reveals his plan to replace the strikers with unemployed black workers, the Godfather abandons him in disapproval. Michael allows Carole to stay with him, but the Corleones&#x27; deteriorating domestic situation convinces Michael and Carole to move out of Michael&#x27;s parents&#x27; house and try to earn enough money to move to California, in order to avoid Shorty, who&#x27;s been stalking Carole since she quit the bar. Michael gets a chance to pitch a comic strip idea to an old executive lying on his death bed, who seems enthusiastic enough to listen to the idea, but the abnormally dark tone of Michael&#x27;s story is too much for the mogul and he dies during the pitch.

Meanwhile, Angie tries to use his Mafia connections to put a murder contract out on his son for &quot;disgracing the family&quot; by dating a black woman, but the Godfather refuses to do this; because he feels he owes Angie nothing for his failures and because the hit he desires is &quot;personal, not business&quot;. Angie realizes he is out of favor with the mob. Drunk and depressed, he is seduced by Snowflake. However, Shorty eventually meets up with Angie and agrees to fulfill the contract. Meanwhile, Carole tries to work as a taxi dancer, until she is fired when one of the customers she dances with has a heart attack.

Michael and Carole turn to crime as a means of getting by, with Carole taking the role of pretending to be a prostitute, flirting with a sleazy businessman and bringing him to a hotel room where Michael beats him to death with a lead pipe so they can rob him. As the two walk out with the dead man&#x27;s cash, Shorty arrives and shoots Michael in the head. In Michael&#x27;s reality, following the conclusion of the animated story, he destroys a pinball machine in anger after it tilts and walks out onto the street. He bumps into the real Carole and follows her into a park, confronting her. The two are seen briefly arguing before they finally take each other&#x27;s hands and begin happily dancing in the park.

==Production==
In 1969, Ralph&#x27;s Spot was founded as a division of Bakshi Productions to produce commercials for Coca-Cola and &quot;Max, the 2000-Year-Old Mouse&quot;, a series of educational shorts paid for by Encyclopædia Britannica. However, Bakshi was uninterested in the kind of animation he was producing, and wanted to produce something personal. Bakshi soon developed &quot;Heavy Traffic&quot;, a tale of inner-city street life. Steve Krantz told Bakshi that studio executives would be unwilling to fund &quot;Heavy Traffic&quot; because of its content and Bakshi&#x27;s lack of film experience. Bakshi directed &quot;Fritz the Cat&quot; (1972), an adaptation of Robert Crumb&#x27;s comic strip of the same name. The financial success of &quot;Fritz the Cat&quot; allowed Bakshi to produce the film he had always intended to produce, and to focus on human characters rather than anthropomorphic animals. Bakshi pitched &quot;Heavy Traffic&quot; to Samuel Z. Arkoff, who took an interest in Bakshi&#x27;s take on the &quot;tortured underground cartoonist&quot;, and agreed to fund the film.

Production began in 1972. However, Steve Krantz had not yet paid Bakshi for his work on &quot;Fritz the Cat&quot;. Halfway through the production of &quot;Heavy Traffic&quot;, Bakshi asked Krantz outright when he would be paid, and Krantz responded that &quot;The picture didn&#x27;t make any money, Ralph. It&#x27;s just a lot of noise.&quot; Bakshi found Krantz&#x27;s claims to be dubious, as the producer had recently purchased a new BMW and a mansion in Beverly Hills. Because Bakshi did not have a lawyer, he sought advice from directors he had become friends with, including Martin Scorsese, Francis Ford Coppola, and Steven Spielberg, asking them how much they made on their films. Bakshi soon accused Krantz of ripping him off, which the producer denied. Bakshi began pitching his next project, &quot;Harlem Nights&quot;, a film loosely based on the &quot;Uncle Remus&quot; story books, which eventually became &quot;Coonskin&quot;. The idea interested producer Albert S. Ruddy during a screening of &quot;The Godfather&quot;.

While working on &quot;Heavy Traffic&quot;, Bakshi received a call from Krantz, who questioned him about &quot;Harlem Nights&quot;. Bakshi told Krantz: &quot;I can&#x27;t talk about that&quot; and hung up. The next day, Krantz locked Bakshi out of the studio, reportedly tapping Bakshi&#x27;s phone because he was wary of his loyalty as an employee. After Krantz fired Bakshi, he began to seek a replacement director for &quot;Heavy Traffic&quot;, calling several directors, including Chuck Jones. Arkoff threatened to pull the film&#x27;s budget unless Krantz rehired Bakshi, who returned a week later. During the film&#x27;s production, Krantz attempted to maintain some level of control by issuing memos to Bakshi and other artists requesting various changes. John Sparey remembers being issued a memo asking Sparey to stop posting caricatures of Krantz on the middle of his door.

Ed Bogas and Ray Shanklin returned to write and perform the film&#x27;s score, as they had done for Bakshi&#x27;s previous feature, &quot;Fritz the Cat&quot;. Other music featured in the film included the songs &quot;Twist and Shout&quot;, performed by The Isley Brothers, &quot;Take Five&quot;, as performed by the Dave Brubeck Quartet, and Chuck Berry&#x27;s &quot;Maybellene&quot;. &quot;Scarborough Fair&quot; is used as a recurring musical motif, first heard in the film&#x27;s opening credits and later reappearing during the end of the film as performed by Sérgio Mendes and Brasil &#x27;66. Bogas also created several other arrangements of the song that appear throughout the film. A soundtrack album was released in 1973.

===Directing===

Inspiration for the film came from penny arcades, where Bakshi would often spend his time playing pinball, sometimes bringing his 12-year-old son Mark. Bakshi wanted to use pinball as a metaphor to examine the ways of the world. &quot;Heavy Traffic&quot; began a tradition in which Bakshi would write poems before beginning production on each of his films, starting with &quot;Street Arabs&quot;. According to Bakshi, &quot;My background was in Brooklyn — my Jewishness, my family life, my father coming from Russia. All these things had to be somehow represented on film.&quot;

Because Bakshi wanted the voices to sound organic, he experimented with improvisation, allowing his actors to ad lib during the recording sessions. According to James Bates, the voice of Snowflake, &quot;I said, &#x27;How about a little Wolfman Jack, Charles Nelson Reilly, Pearl Bailey and a little Truman Capote?&#x27; Ralph couldn&#x27;t believe it. We ad-libbed a lot, and he usually got what he wanted in three or four takes. We worked hard and not for much coin, but it was a blast.&quot;

As with &quot;Fritz the Cat&quot;, Bakshi and Johnnie Vita took location photographs for the film&#x27;s backgrounds. Instead of tracing the photographs onto backgrounds, as they had done in &quot;Fritz the Cat&quot;, the film uses actual photographs and live-action stock footage as backgrounds for much of the film. Bakshi and Vita were also experimental in their photography: Bakshi requested that the lab technicians produce several prints for every photo, each print increasingly out of focus, giving the backgrounds a fuzzy quality. Bakshi states that &quot;We didn&#x27;t want to risk shooting [out of focus] on the spot. That could have meant making some expensive mistakes.&quot;

===Animation===
According to animator Mark Kausler, Krantz was so nervous about showing too much nudity and sexual activities that he had several versions of some sequences animated, for instance, in the &quot;Maybellene&quot; animation sequence. Kausler says that a sequence was animated in which the viewer sees &quot;the key in the ignition metamorphose into a penis entering Maybelline&#x27;s vagina&quot;. This sequence was deleted from &quot;Heavy Traffic&quot;, but the same action appeared in the film &quot;Down and Dirty Duck&quot;. Kausler also states:

I covered this scene with another one of the key changing into the fat black guy, and the ignition slot turning into Maybellene. I covered a lot more cartoony foreplay scenes with a simple close-up of the fat black man&#x27;s face with his hand covering his eyes. You can get a sense of how many scenes had to be altered, by how many times this close-up drawing was used. It got used a lot! At one point the original version &quot;A&quot; of Maybellene existed. Ralph had a print of it, but I have not seen it since I worked on it. We did versions &quot;A,&quot; B&quot;, and &quot;C&quot;, with &quot;C&quot; being the tamest and that is what got into the so-called &quot;X&quot; version of &quot;Heavy Traffic&quot;. Another scene I can recall doing multiple versions of was the guy in the racing cap, pissing on the fat black guy&#x27;s ass. This was completely eliminated, causing a jump in the action.

Edward Hopper&#x27;s famous 1942 painting &quot;Nighthawks&quot; was used as a background in one of the film&#x27;s sequences. Several animation sequences appear as rough sketchbook pages, including a dream sequence influenced by the work of Otto Messmer and a George Herriman-influenced sequence set to Chuck Berry&#x27;s &quot;Maybellene&quot;.

===Films re-used===
*&quot;Red Dust&quot; (1932)
*&quot;42nd Street&quot; (1933)
*&quot;The Gang&#x27;s All Here&quot; (1943)

===Music===

The film&#x27;s score was composed by Ed Bogas and Ray Shanklin. The soundtrack was released by Fantasy Records and Ampex Tapes in 1973. The album was released on compact disc in 1996 as part of a compilation that featured on the same disc the soundtracks to both &quot;Fritz the Cat&quot; and &quot;Heavy Traffic&quot;. The film also featured songs by Sérgio Mendes and Brasil &#x27;66, The Isley Brothers, Dave Brubeck, and Chuck Berry.

==Reception==
Although &quot;Heavy Traffic&quot; received an X rating from the Motion Picture Association of America, more theaters were willing to screen adult-oriented animated features because of the success of &quot;Fritz the Cat&quot;, and thus &quot;Heavy Traffic&quot; was a box office success. Ralph Bakshi was the first person in the animation industry since Walt Disney to have two financially successful films back-to-back. The film was banned by the film censorship board in the Canadian province of Alberta when it was originally released.

&quot;Heavy Traffic&quot; is considered to be Bakshi&#x27;s biggest critical success. &quot;Newsweek&quot; wrote that the film contained &#x27;black humor, powerful grotesquerie and peculiar raw beauty. Episodes of violence and sexuality are both explicit and parodies of flesh-and-blood porn ... a celebration of urban decay&#x27;. Roger Greenspun, of &quot;The New York Times&quot;, wrote in his 1973 review: &#x27;People who felt that his earlier feature, &quot;Fritz the Cat&quot;, merely debased a cherished original, can now judge Bakshi&#x27;s development of his own material. I think that development is as brilliant as anything in recent movies — as brilliant and, in its own improbable way, as lovely and as sad.&#x27; Charles Champlin wrote in the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; that the film was &#x27;a further leaping step forward for American animation; at that, &quot;Heavy Traffic&quot; is, in its furious energy, uncomfortable to watch as often as it is hilarious&#x27;. Gene Siskel of the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; gave the film three stars out of four, and wrote that &#x27;by mixing live-action and animation, Bakshi generates a willingness in us to be moved in some &#x27;aw, shucks&#x27; ways that are corny, but feel good&#x27;. &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot; called it &quot;shocking, outrageous, offensive, sometimes incoherent, occasionally unintelligent; however, it is also an authentic work of movie art and Bakshi is certainly the most creative American animator since Disney&quot;. Vincent Canby ranked it among his &quot;Ten Best Films of 1973&quot;. Gary Arnold, of &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, was negative, calling the film &#x27;ostentatiously ugly&#x27; with &#x27;nothing pleasurable or liberating in [Bakshi&#x27;s] style of mockery&#x27;. The film holds a score of 89% on the review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, based on 18 reviews.

Michael Barrier, an animation historian, described &quot;Heavy Traffic&quot; and &quot;Fritz the Cat&quot; as &#x27;not merely provocative, but highly ambitious&#x27;. He described the films as an effort &#x27;to push beyond what was done in the old cartoons, even while building on their strengths&#x27;.

==Home video==
Warner Home Video released the film on VHS and Betamax in the 1980s. In the UK, Heavy Traffic was released in 1984 with a runtime of 70 minutes. In Ireland, the film was renamed Flipper City, and released by Thorn EMI in 1985 with a runtime of 60 minutes. It was rated R on the VHS slipcover, but the label said that it was an X-rated film. An R-rated version was released on VHS and Region 1 DVD by MGM Home Entertainment in 1999. On July 16, 2013, Shout! Factory and MGM released &quot;Heavy Traffic&quot; on Blu-ray for its 40th anniversary. The film will be re-released on Blu-ray and DVD by Sandpiper Pictures on December 17th, 2024

<doc id="740278" wikidata="Q4115395" url="?curid=740278" title="Postage stamps and postal history of Iraq">
<text>This is a survey of the postage stamps and postal history of Iraq. It includes special uses under the Ottoman Empire as well as occupation issues.

==Early postal arrangements==

The earliest postal service known in the area of present-day Iraq was operated by Assyria; archeologists have found a large number of commercial letters written in cuneiform on clay tablets, and enclosed in addressed clay envelopes.

==Ottoman postal service==
The Ottoman Empire had post offices at Baghdad, Basra, Mosul, and Kirkuk by 1863. India operated post offices in Baghdad and Basra from 1868 to 1914. Prior to 1923, the French operated a post office in Baghdad. 
==World War I==
During World War I, British and Indian troops fought their way from Basra to Mosul; they used stamps of India overprinted &quot;I.E.F.&quot; on their military mail. The British overprinted a variety of Ottoman stamps during their occupation, a grouping now conventionally called the issues of &quot;Mesopotamia&quot;.

==British mandate==
The postal service of Iraq proper began with the British mandate granted by the League of Nations in 1920.

The first stamps of Iraq were a definitive series that appeared in 1923; the set of 12 included eight different designs depicting scenes and images from ancient history and the present day. They were denominated in annas and rupees, inscribed with &quot;IRAQ&quot; and &quot;POSTAGE &amp; REVENUE&quot; and were designed by Edith Cheesman and Marjorie Maynard. The first stamp depicting Faisal I of Iraq was a 1-rupee value in 1927, followed in 1931 by a series of 13 values.

==Independence==

Independence in 1932 brought a new currency (fils and dinar), and the existing Faisal stamps were surcharged accordingly, and issued on 1 April 1932. These were followed soon after (9 May) by stamps of the previous design denominated in the new currency. The accession of King Ghazi necessitated new stamps, which appeared in 1934; they were of the same design as the Faisal stamps, but with a profile of Ghazi in the vignette.
Due to Ghazi&#x27;s unexpected death and the infancy of his son, in 1941 a new series was issued featuring local scenery. Along with additional values and color changes issued the next year, the series totals 23 stamps. 1942 also saw the first stamps depicting Faisal II, who was still a young boy. He appears as a teenager in the next series, which was issued in 1948.

==First commemorative stamps==
Iraq&#x27;s first commemorative stamps came out in 1949 to mark the 75th anniversary of the Universal Postal Union. Faisal&#x27;s 1953 coronation was also marked by a set of three, along with a souvenir sheet. The last of the Faisal definitives had only partly appeared before the revolution of 1958, and both issued and unissued types were overprinted.

==Republic==
General Qassim&#x27;s period was noted by the usual round of commemoratives, many featuring him as benevolent leader. Later presidents also appeared, though less frequently. Saddam Hussein, as vice-president, makes a first appearance in a souvenir sheet of 1976, and by the mid-1980s appeared on a great many Iraqi stamps. 

==Post-Saddam era==
The 2003 invasion of Iraq brought the stamp program to a sudden halt, the last Saddam-era issue being a Saddam University stamp on 5 February 2003. Two additional issues were planned, themed &quot;Old Methods of Transportation&quot; and &quot;Popular Industries&quot;, and proofs had been made. The printing works were destroyed in the looting, but not the Post Office building, and the proofs survived. The Coalition Provisional Authority subsequently approved the printing of the Transportation stamps, and they were issued 29 January 2004. In the meantime, overprints appeared on various stamps, but none were officially authorized.

==Fantasies and bogus issues==

Beginning in 1963 a number of Iraqi stamps appeared overprinted &quot;AT TAWAL&quot;, supposedly for &quot;Al Tawal&quot; the so-called neutral zones between Iraq and Saudi Arabia. These were a student hoax that continued until 1970.

<text>Ma Jian (; born 20 August 1969 in Shijiazhuang, Hebei) is a former professional basketball player from China.

==Basketball career==
Ma Jian is known for playing college basketball in the United States and was among the first Chinese nationals to play competitive basketball in the United States. He was to play for the UCLA Bruins but he failed the entrance exam due to his lack of fluency in English. He would play junior college for Utah Valley Community College and later play college basketball for two years with the University of Utah.

Attempting to break into the NBA, Ma was able to play exhibition games with the Phoenix Suns and the Los Angeles Clippers in the team&#x27;s summer-league programs in 1994. He was among the final cuts for the 1995–96 Clippers roster but he did not feature in any regular games for the Clippers. After being cut, Ma served as commentator for the Clippers games on Chinese radio station KAZN, a 24-hour Mandarin Chinese radio station covering the Los Angeles area.

Ma also had a brief stint in the Philippines playing for the Hapee Cavity Fighters of the Philippine Basketball League (PBL). He helped Hapee clinch the 1996 PBL Reinforced Conference title – the first for the franchise.

He later returned to China to play for the Beijing Olympians of the Chinese Basketball Association (CBA), until he left during the 2000–2001 season.

He also competed in the 1990 Asian Games and the 1992 Summer Olympics for the Chinese men&#x27;s national basketball team. His decision to pursue a career in the United States reportedly led to his exclusion to the Chinese national team.

<text>Sir Ernst Boris Chain (19 June 1906 – 12 August 1979) was a German-born British biochemist and co-recipient of the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for his work on penicillin.

==Life and career==
Chain was born in Berlin, the son of Margarete () and Michael Chain, a chemist and industrialist dealing in chemical products. His family was of both Sephardic and Ashkenazi Jewish descent. His father emigrated from Russia to study chemistry abroad and his mother was from Berlin. In 1930, he received his degree in chemistry from Friedrich Wilhelm University. His father descends from Zerahiah ben Shealtiel Ḥen who was a prominent figure among the Catalonian Jewry and whose ancestors were leading Jewish figures in Babylonia. He was a lifelong friend of Professor Albert Neuberger, whom he met in Berlin in the 1930s.

After the Nazis came to power, Chain understood that, being Jewish, he would no longer be safe in Germany. He left Germany and moved to England, arriving on 2 April 1933 with £10 in his pocket. Geneticist and physiologist J. B. S. Haldane helped him obtain a position at University College Hospital, London.

After a couple of months he was accepted as a PhD student at Fitzwilliam College, Cambridge, where he began working on phospholipids under the direction of Sir Frederick Gowland Hopkins. In 1935, he accepted a job at Oxford University as a lecturer in pathology. During this time he worked on a range of research topics, including snake venoms, tumour metabolism, lysozymes, and biochemistry techniques. Chain was naturalised as a British subject in April 1939.

In 1939, he joined Howard Florey to investigate natural antibacterial agents produced by microorganisms. This led him and Florey to revisit the work of Alexander Fleming, who had described penicillin nine years earlier. Chain and Florey went on to discover penicillin&#x27;s therapeutic action and its chemical composition. Chain and Florey discovered how to isolate and concentrate the germ-killing agent in penicillin. For this research, Chain, Florey, and Fleming received the Nobel Prize in 1945.

Along with Edward Abraham he was also involved in theorising the beta-lactam structure of penicillin in 1942, which was confirmed by X-ray crystallography done by Dorothy Hodgkin in 1945.
Towards the end of World War II, Chain learned his mother and sister had been killed by the Nazis. After World War II, Chain moved to Rome, to work at the Istituto Superiore di Sanità (Superior Institute of Health). He returned to Britain in 1964 as the founder and head of the biochemistry department at Imperial College London, where he stayed until his retirement, specialising in fermentation technologies.

On 17 March 1948 Chain was appointed a Fellow of the Royal Society.

In spite of his successful scientific career and widespread recognition from his Nobel Prize, Chain was for some time barred from entry to the United States under the McCarran Internal Security Act of 1950, being declined a visa on two occasions in 1951.

In 1948, he married Anne Beloff, sister of Renee Beloff, Max Beloff, John Beloff and Nora Beloff, and a biochemist of significant standing herself. In his later life, his Jewish identity became increasingly important to him. Chain was an ardent Zionist and he became a member of the board of governors of the Weizmann Institute of Science at Rehovot in 1954, and later a member of the executive council. He raised his children securely within the Jewish faith, arranging much extracurricular tuition for them. His views were expressed most clearly in his speech &#x27;Why I am a Jew&#x27; given at the World Jewish Congress Conference of Intellectuals in 1965.

Chain was appointed Knight Bachelor in the 1969 Birthday Honours.

Chain died in 1979 at the Mayo General Hospital in Castlebar, Ireland. The Imperial College London biochemistry building is named after him, as is a road in Castlebar.

<doc id="740290" wikidata="Q702922" url="?curid=740290" title="Sister Princess">
<text>is a Japanese light novel series written by Sakurako Kimino and illustrated by Naoto Tenhiro that began serialization in 1999 and ended in 2003. In 2001, a manga series and a bishōjo game for the PlayStation were released. Sequels to the game were released for the PlayStation and Game Boy Advance.

&quot;Sister Princess&quot; was also adapted into two anime television series, both broadcast on TV Tokyo. The first series was produced in 2001 for 26 episodes. The second, &quot;Sister Princess: RePure&quot;, aired 13 episodes in 2002.

==Gameplay==
The premise behind &quot;Sister Princess&quot; is that an ordinary young man (the player) is made to live with twelve lovable little sisters, each with their own distinct quirks and personalities. The game itself plays out like a dating sim. Players have about a month to spend with the sisters with each day broken up into three segments: first is the free time period before noon, followed by the period after lunch and ending with another period of time before bed. During day time, the player can choose which of the girls he wishes to escort to school, if any. The period after lunch is similar to the one in the morning, with additional choices which allow the player to go to various places in town besides walking home with one of the girls. Every night before bed, the player will be allowed to check his e-mail and send replies. As the player continues to interact with the sisters, their reactions to their big brother will change accordingly until the ending.

There are two different endings for each sister: the normal ending and the &quot;non-blood relation&quot; ending. As the name would suggest, the special ending reveals that the brother-character and sister are not actually related by blood. In the case of some of the older sisters, this can lead to the protagonist and &quot;sister&quot; marrying one another. In the original &quot;Sister Princess&quot;, the player can see two different endings for each sister, but &quot;Sister Princess 2&quot; has four endings for each sister. The first two were the non-sibling relation and siblings-together ending and, if the player chooses one sister in the beginning but ends up with another sister, either of the other two endings for the first sister who the player does not choose appear (&quot;non-blood relation&quot; ending and &quot;still brother and sister forever&quot; ending also) but with a different story.

For &quot;Sister Princess 2&quot;, the story begins on the final day of school before summer vacation. Then the player chooses a sister who he wants to start with for a close relationship. Therefore, &quot;Sister Princess 2&quot; is about spending the player&#x27;s time with either one sister or all sisters at the same time as they spend their summer together. Especially in &quot;Sister Princess 2&quot;, the player can spend the summer with all the sisters, not just one, in a special ending where the sisters invite their brother to a summer party where the brother and the sisters would swear to be together forever.

==Characters==

===Brother===
: 
: The brother whom all of the sisters adore. In their eyes, he can do no wrong. The name Wataru Minakami was given to the brother character only for the first &quot;Sister Princess&quot; television series. In &quot;Sister Princess Re-Pure,&quot; he is simply referred to as &quot;Ani&quot;, or &quot;Brother&quot;. Until the final set of illustrated stories, the brother&#x27;s face was always hidden or turned away from the reader to keep his appearance hidden. This follows a tradition of most eroge protagonists, so as to allow the character to be a &#x27;blank slate&#x27; so that the player can place themselves in his metaphorically empty shoes. As the series came to its end, a slightly modified version of the character design from the anime was used.
: As the father/fathers of the siblings is never present, and the mothers of the sisters are regularly preoccupied by their upper-class careers, Wataru serves as much a parent figure as he does a brother. He devotes extraordinary time to teaching or guiding them through various life crises, no matter how trivial or difficult they may be. For this reason, the sisters attribute many of their personal accomplishments to him. Despite their unwavering testimonies, Wataru is not perfect, even in the magazine stories and mini-novels. He is unquestionably selfless however, and will do everything in his power to aid his siblings whenever humanly possible. Wataru also seems to possess an uncanny ability to show up exactly when a sister needs him most. Wataru has a habit of saying &quot;It can&#x27;t be true&quot; in almost every episode.
: Understandably, the greatest fear the sisters share is someone or something taking Wataru away from them. For this reason, some of them entertain and dream of somehow becoming his wife or life partner. As pure as Wataru’s sisters are, they show signs of jealousy and concern when a non-family member &quot;takes&quot; their brother away from them, fearing he may forget or leave them.
He later chooses Karen as his soulmate and &quot;The Promised and only Dream Girl&quot;.

===Twelve sisters===

Each sister has a unique method of addressing her older brother. Each method is derived from either &quot;onii-san&quot; or &quot;ani&quot;, both of which mean &quot;older brother&quot;. However, most of the methods are rarely or never used in Japanese culture, except for Karen&#x27;s &quot;onii-chan&quot; and Rinrin&#x27;s &quot;aniki&quot;. There is never any sibling rivalry among the sisters: although they certainly each vie for his time and attention, they never see themselves as competitors; their unconditional love for him only strengthens their bonds with one another. The sisters not only regularly hang out with one another (often to exchange tales of how wonderful a brother he is), but they also arrange to &quot;share&quot; him when he inadvertently neglects to or cannot regularly visit any of them.
: 
: Hailing from Germany, Haruka aspires to become a perfect Japanese lady (Yamato Nadeshiko). She is frequently seen wearing a kimono and can be found learning Japanese tea ceremony (sado) along with other cultural things. Haruka is an expert at handling the daikyu and naginata. Training in these weapons is akin to the training given to the brides of samurai; Haruka&#x27;s training in these weapons may or may not have been inspired due to her desire to be a perfect Japanese bride for a person of high standing—like her brother.
: Haruka addresses the brother as , the honorific suffix &quot;-kimisama&quot; (a combination of the honofirics &quot;kimi&quot; or &quot;kun&quot; and &quot;-sama&quot;) used to address a venerable person in the same bloodline. In English, she calls him &quot;Beloved Brother&quot; and speaks with a German accent.
: 
: The youngest of the sisters, Hinako is very much a child and shows her affection accordingly. In the anime, Hinako frequently insists on her brother reading to her from picture books.
: Hinako refers to herself in the third-person as &quot;Hina&quot;, dropping the &quot;-ko&quot;. She addresses her brother as , a more childish version of Kaho&#x27;s &quot;onii-chama&quot;. In English, she calls him &quot;Bro-bro&quot;.
: 
: Despite being a bit clumsy, Kaho is on her school&#x27;s cheerleading team and loves to cheer her brother on. She is an accomplished gardener, and frequently grows flowers for and with her brother. She refers to herself in the third-person and addresses her brother as , a childish version of &quot;onii-sama&quot;. In English, she calls him &quot;Brother&quot;.
: 
: Sweet and gentle, Karen&#x27;s personality sometimes seems more suitable for an older (rather than younger) sister. She is a very skilled pianist. In the magazine stories and mini-novels, Karen owns a kitten named Vanilla (who, incidentally, has a thing for vanilla flavored sweets). Like several of the sisters, she refers to herself in the third-person and addresses her brother as , a way to call a brother by a younger sibling, usually a child. In English, she calls him &quot;Big Brother&quot;.
: 
: The athlete of the group, Mamoru is always trying to get her brother to play sports with her. She is sometimes mistaken for Rinrin due to their similar hairstyles and their penchant for donning their eyewear on their head. As she is a tomboy, Mamoru uses phrases and mannerisms that only boys are expected to. As proof of this, she addresses her brother as , a shorter address used by a male teenager. In English, she calls him &quot;Big Bro&quot;.
: 
: Possessing a weak constitution, the bespectacled Marie has spent a lot of time in the hospital due to her illness. Her pet Michael, a Golden Retriever, acts as her guardian and friend when her brother isn&#x27;t around. She addresses her brother as , the honorific &quot;-uesama&quot; (a combination of &quot;ue&quot; and &quot;-sama&quot;) being used within the royal family or as a sign of politeness. In English, she calls him &quot;Brother Mine&quot;.
: 
: Hailing from France, Aria is a rather soft-spoken character who has a tendency to cry whenever there is trouble, uttering the phrase &quot;kusu&quot; (an onomatopoeia for sniffling) when doing so. She enjoys sweets, especially French cuisines, and can usually be found wearing very frilly dresses with plenty of lace and bows. She refers to herself in the third-person, which is considered childish in Japanese culture, and speaks slowly.
: In the first anime, Wataru comments that time seems to pass more slowly around Aria, especially to someone who is used to the high-paced life of the city. In the second anime, Aria comments that being in the brother&#x27;s company relieves her of her &#x27;sleepy feelings&#x27;, energizing her.
: She addresses the brother as the most childish name for one&#x27;s brother. In English, she calls him &quot;Frère-Friend&quot; (French for &quot;My Brother Friend&quot;). Her birthday is March 3, is a Pisces, and stands 139 cm (about 4&#x27; 7&quot;) tall. She&#x27;s later revealed to be the childhood-self of Chikage.
: 
: Mysterious and occasionally gothic, Chikage is very much into spellcraft, the occult, and religion. She is an accomplished practitioner of dark magic, but prefers to utilize her sorcery in subtle methods, rather than brute power. Common images associated with her are the Eastern Chinese Phoenix, Tarot and Oracle, Catholic Christian cross and butterflies.
: She calls the brother as , the suffix &quot;-kun&quot; being an address to a boy who has a close relation or is about the same age as the addresser, giving the impression that her age is close to him. In English, she calls him &quot;Brother Friend&quot;. Her birthday is July 3, is a Cancer, and stands 157 cm (about 5&#x27; 2&quot;) tall.
: 
: Gifted in the fields of science and technology, Rinrin spends a lot of her time building things but constantly asks her brother for monetary donations to keep her projects going. Lately, she&#x27;s been constructing a robot duplicate of herself, . She speaks with a strong Chinese accent and addresses her brother as , another way for a boy to address his brother. In English, she calls him &quot;Bro&quot;.
: 
: Sakuya behaves very much like a modern teenager and is fashion conscious. She would love for her brother to see her as a woman and not just a sister.
: In both anime, Sakuya claims that she and the brother are connected by the &quot;red string of fate&quot; and expresses the desire that she might somehow marry her brother. She is quick to agree it would be impossible when in his presence. In the anime, Sakuya is arguably the most emotionally vulnerable of all the sisters where the brother is concerned, since she goes through extreme emotional reactions when they are separated—or when she anticipates separation. In the first anime, Sakuya frequently uses double entendres and innuendo when speaking to her brother, dismissing her words as jokes when he becomes really flustered.
: Sakuya addresses her brother as as her sign of admiration. In English, she calls him &quot;Dear Brother&quot;.
: 
: Shirayuki loves to cook, especially for her brother, and is always trying out new recipes for him. She refers to herself in the third-person as , which translates to &quot;princess&quot;. This might be because of her name&#x27;s Western variant: Snow White. She also frequently ends her sentences with the phrase &quot;desu-no.&quot; She addresses her brother as , which is shorter than Sakuya&#x27;s, but polite. In English, she calls him &quot;Elder Brother&quot;.
: 
: Hailing from England (as evidenced by her occasional penchant for anything with a Union Flag), Yotsuba fancies herself a detective à la Sherlock Holmes. She can often be found with either a digital camera or a magnifying glass in hand, trying to spy on her brother. In the magazine stories and mini-novels, Yotsuba owns an unnamed talking toucan (not surprisingly, it can only say &quot;checki&quot; and &quot;Ani-chama&quot;). She refers to herself in the third-person and is fond of using the catchphrase, . In the first Sister Princess anime, Yotsuba does not have a pet, but owns a toy bird aptly named &quot;Watson&quot;, whom she keeps in a cage like a real bird.
: She addresses her brother as , which is a childish address similar to Kaho&#x27;s, but laced with a British accent. In English, she calls him &quot;Brother Dearest&quot;.

===Supporting===
: 
: Aria&#x27;s lady&#x27;s maid. She&#x27;s actually a young woman in her early or mid twenties, but Aria calls her &#x27;Jiiya&#x27;, a Japanese nickname for a butler, like the English &#x27;Jeeves&#x27;. The exact reason for this is uncertain, but most agree its Aria&#x27;s way of being playful. In the second anime series, it is possibly implied that Aria is simply used to calling the person taking care of her &#x27;Jii-ya&#x27;, as she points at a picture of an old man in butler&#x27;s clothing, then at her maid and calls them both &#x27;Jii-ya&#x27;. Of all the non-sister characters in Sister Princess, only Jiiya has a personal affectionate name for the sister&#x27;s brother. She addresses the brother as , a more polite version of Aria&#x27;s address.
: 
: Featured only in &quot;Sister Princess 2&quot;, Kakinomoto is one of the handful of non-related girls allowed to be near the sisters&#x27; brother without causing any issues. She has been known to disagree with him, and played something of a devil&#x27;s advocate role. A very close friend of Haruka. Has a preference to be called Pride, rather than her given name.
: The unnamed nurse who attends to Marie. Due to the nature of her duties and Marie&#x27;s regular medical needs, she has constant contact with the sisters&#x27; brother (although not as frequent as Jiiya), and is one of the few non-sisters able to approach him without causing concern.
: 
: Mecha Rinrin is a gynoid designed to be an identical copy of its creator as an experiment in robotics. In the anime, her purpose is also to lend full support to the brother in the absence of any of his sisters. Mecha Rinrin differs from her creator in her eye color and the unexplained requirement of a ball-shaped sensor on her head. Mecha Rinrin always overheats and inadvertently deactivates when the sisters&#x27; brother praises her; presumably from overwhelming joy. It appears Rinrin programmed her doppelgänger too well, as it shares an overwhelming love for him, although her delicate circuitry cannot handle the overload.
: In the first anime, Rinrin explains that she created her doppelgänger because she eventually intends to study in the United States. When that happens, she wants Mecha Rinrin to be there to do all the things for her brother that she herself won&#x27;t be available for. Rinrin herself feels sad at the thought that she might actually have made herself redundant until she is reassured by Wataru. Also in the anime, her dopplegänger&#x27;s immediate precursor is a much larger robot with a more robotic appearance, known as ProtoRobo or Pooh. While this robot looks less sophisticated, it is much more stable and capable of feats of strength and quite delicate manipulations. It also seems to care for its creator&#x27;s well-being.
: Mecha Rinrin addresses the brother as , just like her creator.
: Marie&#x27;s loyal and highly intelligent Golden Retriever. Despite the name, Michael (named after the archangel) is a female, and eventually gives birth to a litter of puppies. Michael was a gift from her brother, to keep company and guard over her at the times when he could not. The pet also serves to give Marie inner strength, as having Michael depend on her proves she is stronger than others think.
: Featured only in &quot;Sister Princess 2&quot;. The local temple nun who the brother visits to addresses many of Chikage&#x27;s spiritual concerns.

===Anime-only characters===
: 
: Mamimi, or &quot;Mami&quot; (眞深) for short, is initially regarded by those new to the anime as the &quot;13th sister.&quot; In fact, like the sisters, she has a pet name for Wataru: An-chan (あんちゃん), or &quot;Bud&quot; in the English dub. However, she is just a girl posing as one of Wataru&#x27;s sisters after he mistakes her as such, and she is sent by someone to watch over him and break him away from the sisters so she can bring him back to Tokyo.
: Mami can be regarded as a pseudo-antagonist because of her mission, but she mostly acts as comic relief, even learning why the sisters love him very much. Eventually, she becomes a source of advice to Wataru and even goes after him when he returns to Tokyo, hoping to return him to the island.
: In marked contrast to the sisters themselves, Mami treats him differently, acting as if she is more of a friend than a sibling (though towards the ending of the series, however, there are some hints that Mami might be developing deeper feelings towards Wataru). Furthermore, she doesn&#x27;t bring a lot of things to Promised Island (only clothes and camping gear) with a hand-held computer and possibly a sewing machine as (arguably) her only luxuries.
: Although she is not really Wataru&#x27;s sister, she &quot;is&quot; somebody&#x27;s sister. She always receives e-mails from her real brother, demanding whatever happened to Wataru and her plans to bring him back, much to her chagrin.
: Towards the end of the series, it is confirmed that Akio, Wataru&#x27;s friend in Tokyo, was Mami&#x27;s older brother. The two are initially seen to have a bad relationship, with Akio treating his sister more as an agent than as a sibling and her caring little for him. Akio accuses Mami of having grown decadent on Promised Island, whereas she finds his intentions for Wataru to be distasteful. Later, they seem to be growing a little closer to each other, Mami managing to playfully tease Akio and him reminiscing a little about their past together; apparently she used to address her brother with the nickname she has bestowed on Wataru, &#x27;An-chan&#x27;.
: 
: Yamada is the third ferry passenger who goes with Wataru and Mami to Promised Island so he would enroll at the school there. As soon as he finds out about Wataru&#x27;s many sisters, he becomes very envious of Wataru. Yamada then proceeds to be more positive and outgoing towards Wataru shortly after, specifically whenever he is around his sisters in order to get closer to them. But eventually, he does begin to consider Wataru as a real friend and Wataru himself meets up with Yamada on the school roof occasionally to ask for advice.
: Ironically, at one point, Wataru offered to switch places with Yamada due to still being freaked out about his current living situation. Yamada, believing that Wataru is stating arbitrary facts about how much better his place was than his, refuses pessimistically. At this time, he did not know of Wataru&#x27;s sisters. However, he never once looked back on this decision again after later finding out about them, hinting that he simply forgot about the proposition altogether.
: 
: Akio is Wataru&#x27;s best friend back in Tokyo and the recipient of Wataru&#x27;s e-mails which the latter writes at the beginning and end of almost every episode.
: He has plans to have himself, Wataru, and another friend, Minai, to go to the same high school together and eventually become the elite men in society. But this plan fails after Wataru&#x27;s failure in the entrance exam. The continuation of his plan is the reason why he sent his little sister Mami to watch over Wataru. At the end of the anime, Akio is jarred from his own vision of the future by Wataru&#x27;s refusal to stay in Tokyo. He follows Wataru to Promised Island in the company of Mami and enrolls there, according to him in an effort to find out &#x27;what is truly cool&#x27;, based on a comment from Mami that his original plans for the future weren&#x27;t.
: 
: Separate from Aria&#x27;s maid from the game, Jiiya (or &quot;Jeeves&quot; in the English dub) is, simply put, Wataru&#x27;s old butler, who reports to Wataru in the first episode that he was leaving because he had promised Wataru&#x27;s father that he would take care of Wataru until he graduated from junior high school and then sent Wataru to Promised Island. However, since then, Jiiya has been seen in numerous different guises just to watch over him, too, especially on his past.
; Promised and Dream Girl of Sakamoto Hideo
: This young girl&#x27;s ghost, wearing a yellow dress and hat, is somehow related to Wataru in some way and frequently appears in strange places. Wataru never sees the Dream Girl until towards the ending of the first season. Later on, he discovers why she was appearing after he leaves Tokyo for the third and final time. The Dream Girl is meant to act as a human figmentation reminder of a promise he made that he would one day return to Promised Island.
: Wataru recalls childhood memories with the Promised Girl at his old vacation house allocated on the beach of Promised Island. But she states that she lives on inside all of Wataru&#x27;s sisters&#x27; hearts, confirming that she is in fact a ghost of a deceased person. However, at the last scene of the first season, as the camera approaches the vacation house and goes in the room where her yellow hat resided, she is seen picking it up followed by a fadeout.
She is later revealed as Honda Karen.
: 
: Minai is a friend of Akio and Wataru back in Tokyo. When Wataru failed the entrance exam, he was the one who passed instead. He appears in the first and penultimate episodes.

==Development==
The history of &quot;Sister Princess&quot; can be traced back to March 1999, when it first appeared in the monthly &quot;Dengeki G&#x27;s Magazine&quot;. Originally, there were only nine sisters, not twelve. Readers were able to vote for their favorite sister and following the tremendous response from the fans, the magazine decided to serialize &quot;Sister Princess&quot;. In March 2000, a decision was made to renew the series, this time by featuring the short letters that the girls wrote to their beloved brother. Three more sisters were added to the mix: Haruka, who came from Germany; Yotsuba, who came from England; and Aria, who came from France.

A year later, on March 8, 2001, the game version of &quot;Sister Princess&quot;—about the older brother spending a month with all twelve sisters, and featuring original artwork by Naoto Tenhiro—was released on the Sony PlayStation. The game was the third best-selling title in Japan in its first week of release. In July of the same year, a new series of stories began in &quot;Dengeki G&#x27;s&quot;, right up till April 2002. While the magazine was preparing for yet another renewal of the &quot;Sister Princess&quot; stories for its May 2002 issue, a premium edition of the game (the original plus two other Christmas and Valentine side stories) was released for the Sega Dreamcast on Mar 28, 2002. In September 2003, the series was retired as the &quot;Dengeki G&#x27;s Magazine&quot; premier flagship title (replaced by another popular series, &quot;Futakoi&quot;).

<doc id="740295" wikidata="Q1765699" url="?curid=740295" title="Parasympathomimetic drug">
<text>A parasympathomimetic drug, sometimes called a cholinomimetic drug or [[cholinergic receptor]] [[agonist|stimulating agent]], is a substance that stimulates the parasympathetic nervous system (PSNS). These chemicals are also called [[cholinergic]] drugs because acetylcholine (ACh) is the neurotransmitter used by the PSNS. Chemicals in this family can act either directly by stimulating the nicotinic or muscarinic receptors (thus mimicking acetylcholine), or indirectly by inhibiting cholinesterase, promoting acetylcholine release, or other mechanisms. Common uses of parasympathomimetics include glaucoma, Sjögren syndrome and underactive bladder.

Some chemical weapons such as sarin or VX, non-lethal riot control agents such as tear gas, and insecticides such as diazinon fall into this category.

==Structure activity relationships for parasympathomimetic drugs==
For a cholinergic agent, the following criteria describe the structure activity relationship:
# Ing&#x27;s Rule of 5: there should be no more than five atoms between the nitrogen and the terminal hydrogen for muscarinic (or cholinergic) activity;
# the molecule must possess a nitrogen atom capable of bearing a positive charge, preferably a quaternary ammonium salt;
# for maximum potency, the size of the alkyl groups substituted on the nitrogen should not exceed the size of a methyl group;
# the molecule should have an oxygen atom, preferably an ester-like oxygen capable of participating in a hydrogen bond;
# there should be a two-carbon unit between the oxygen atom and the nitrogen atom.

==Pharmaceuticals/Supplements==

===Direct-acting===
These act by stimulating the nicotinic or muscarinic receptors.
* Choline esters
** Acetylcholine (all acetylcholine receptors)
** Bethanechol (M3 receptors)
** Carbachol (all muscarinic receptors and some nicotinic receptors)
** Methacholine (all muscarinic receptors)
* Plant alkaloids
** Arecoline
** Nicotine
** Muscarine
** Pilocarpine (M3 receptors)

===Indirect-acting===
Indirect acting parasympathomimetic substances may be either reversible cholinesterase inhibitors, irreversible cholinesterase inhibitors or substances that promote ACh release or anti-adrenergics. The latter inhibits the antagonistic system, the sympathetic nervous system.
* Reversible cholinesterase inhibitors
** Donepezil
** Edrophonium

** Isoflurophate
** Malathion
* ACh release promoters
** Alpha GPC
** Cisapride
** Droperidol
** Domperidone
** Metoclopramide
** Risperidone
** Paliperidone
* Anti-adrenergics: See also alpha blocker and beta blocker
** Clonidine (α-receptor agonist, α2 &gt; α1, giving negative feedback)
** Methyldopa (α2 agonist, giving negative feedback)
** Propranolol (β-receptor antagonist)
** Metoprolol (β-receptor antagonist)
** Atenolol (β1 antagonist)
** Prazosin (α1 antagonist)
** Oxymetazoline (partial α2 adrenergic agonist)

<text>William Alexander Scott (born 1940) is a politician in Bermuda who is the MP for the Warwick South East constituency. Between 2003 and 2006 he served as the Premier of Bermuda and leader of the Progressive Labour Party (PLP).

==Early life==
The son of Willard Scott and Edith Lucille Scott of Khyber Pass, Warwick, Scott grew up in Warwick and attended Purvis Primary School, Berkeley Institute and Temple University in Philadelphia, where he obtained a Bachelor of Fine Arts Degree. He subsequently worked a graphic designer and a design consultant and ran Scotts Crafts Limited, an advertising and public relations firm he started in 1964.

==Political career==
Scott&#x27;s political career began in 1985 when he was appointed to the Senate; in 1989, he was promoted to Opposition Leader in the Senate. In 1993 he successfully ran for Parliament for the Warwick East constituency. In 1998, during the PLP&#x27;s unprecedented win in Parliament, he was appointed to Cabinet as the Minister of Works &amp; Engineering. Perhaps the most memorable event of his term was the construction of a new high school campus for the Berkeley Institute, a project with suffered significant overruns, contracting irregularities and work delays.

He was appointed Premier (and, thus, leader of the PLP) on 29 July 2003. The party had been re-elected in that year&#x27;s parliamentary elections, but its leader, Dame Jennifer Meredith Smith, was overthrown hours after the election results were certified when a schism in the elected members of the party surfaced. With the two sides split 13 members each, Smith agreed to step aside with Scott as the compromise leader.

The hallmarks of his premiership were the promotion of a Social Agenda and the launch of an unpopular drive for Independence from the United Kingdom. Supporters believed he wished to spread Bermuda&#x27;s wealth among the population, while critics charged that the Scott administration was racially divisive, autocratic, and lacked accountability.

Scott was never successful in unifying the factions in the party and he was ousted, by a vote of 107-76, in a leadership challenge by his Deputy Premier, Dr. Ewart Brown, during a PLP delegates conference on 27 October 2006.

He was appointed Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in the 2013 Birthday Honours for services to Bermuda.

<doc id="740302" wikidata="Q5203312" url="?curid=740302" title="D-class Melbourne tram">
<text>The D-class Melbourne tram is a fleet of low-floor Combino trams that operate on the Melbourne tram network. They were built by Siemens in Uerdingen, Krefeld, Germany, and are divided into two classes: the three section D1-class which was introduced between 2002 and 2004, and the five section D2-class which was introduced in 2004. The D-class was procured by M&gt;Tram and have been operated by Yarra Trams since they took control of the entire tram network in April 2004.

==History==
To meet a franchise commitment to introduce new trams to replace Z-class trams, 59 German built Siemens Combino low-floor trams were introduced by M&gt;Tram.

The first tram arrived for testing in August 2002, and the first four entered service in November 2002. M&gt;Tram operations were transferred to Yarra Trams in April 2004 following negotiations with the State Government after National Express handed the M&gt;Tram franchise back to the government in December 2002.

To aid disabled access to trams from platform stops, &#x27;gap eliminators&#x27; were fitted to all 59 D1 and D2-class trams in 2013. Costing $400,000 to fit to the fleet, they are a strip attached to the door step of the trams that prevent the wheels of wheelchairs from getting stuck between the door step and platform. &#x27;Gap eliminators&#x27; proved successful in an earlier 2012 trial on two route 96 Ds, before being fitted to all D1 and D2-class trams. In August 2004, D1 3507 was badly damaged in a collision and returned to Germany in November 2004 for repairs. It did not return to service until March 2009.

In early 2013, all 59 D1 and D2-class trams had their passenger information systems upgraded to announce upcoming stops. The upgrade, which cost $343,000, allows announcements on all routes on which D-class trams regularly travel and their alternative deviations, informing passengers of upcoming stops and connections.

D class trams are now operated by Malvern and Brunswick depots, all together is 59 D-class trams in Melbourne operate with route 5, 6, 16, 19 and 72 served by D1 and D2-class trams.

===Fatigue Cracking===
The bodies of both D1 and D2-class vehicles were found to be developing microscopic cracks in November 2006, which could lead to structural collapse in the event of an accident. This resulted in all 59 Combino trams undergoing structural work to strengthen their frames. The repairs necessitated the removal of between four and eight seats per tram, leaving D1-class trams with 32 seats and D2-class trams with 56.

D class trams are either in the PTV livery or all over advertising livery.

==Variants==
D-class trams comes in two variants: the 38 strong D1-class, which have three-sections; and 21 strong D2-class, which have five-sections. The D1-class entered service in late 2002, being operated from Malvern depot, with the last entering service in 2004, while the D2-class entered service in 2004. From 26 July 2004 D2-class trams were progressively moved to operation on route 96, displacing B-class trams that were in service at the time. In September 2013, following the introduction of the E-class trams, Yarra Trams started to move D2 class trams to Brunswick depot to operate on route 19.

As of March 2017, all D1-class operate from Malvern depot, while all D2-class operate out of Brunswick depot.

==Operation==
D1-class trams operate on the following routes:
*5: Malvern to Melbourne University
*6: Glen Iris to Moreland
*16: Kew to Melbourne University
*72: Camberwell to Melbourne University

D2-class trams operate on the following routes:
*6: Glen Iris to Moreland
*19: North Coburg to Flinders Street Station

==In Kaohsiung==
In January 2004, a Melbourne D2-class tram operated on a demonstration track in Central Park, Kaohsiung, Taiwan before being delivered to Melbourne. The Kaohsiung City Government built the temporary line to demonstrate the concept of light rail.

==Criticisms==
In March 2016, &quot;Time Out Magazine&quot; rated the D-Class tram the worst on the Yarra Trams network. The reasons given were a low number of seats, the uncomfortableness of the seats, a loud screech when the doors open and close and poor ride quality.

<text>Dame Jennifer Meredith Smith, DBE, JP, DHumL, MP (born 1947) is a Bermudian politician who was the Premier of Bermuda from 1998 until 2003, the first premier who was not a member of the United Bermuda Party.

Affectionately referred to as &quot;Dame Jennifer&quot;, she has marked her place in Bermuda&#x27;s history as the first woman to lead a political party to an election victory, the first Progressive Labour Party Shadow Minister of Education, the first and so far only leader of the PLP to lead the party to win two consecutive general elections, the first female Speaker of the House of Assembly and the second woman to serve as Premier.

Smith is a member of the Council of Women World Leaders, an international network of current and former women presidents and prime ministers whose mission is to mobilize the highest-level women leaders globally for collective action on issues of critical importance to women and equitable development.

==Early life==
Smith was born in 1947 in Bermuda, the daughter of a bartender. She was raised as a member of the African Methodist Episcopal church. She exhibited an interest in art from an early age, and later enrolled at the Art Institute of Pittsburgh, from which she earned an associate degree in 1970. Upon returning to Bermuda, she began work as a political reporter and editor for the &quot;Bermuda Recorder&quot; newspaper.

==Political career==
Dame Jennifer Smith first got involved in frontline politics in 1972, running as a Progressive Labour Party candidate, the youngest person to run for elected office in Bermuda&#x27;s history.

===Senate===
Smith was appointed to the Senate of Bermuda in 1980, becoming Bermuda&#x27;s youngest Senator and serving in that capacity until 1989.

===Member of Parliament and deputy party leadership===
Dame Jennifer was elected to the House of Assembly of Bermuda in 1989 as a member of the Progressive Labour Party. She was elected deputy party leader in 1994, and succeeded to the leadership two years later upon the death of L. Frederick Wade.

===Leader of the Opposition===
From 1996 until 1998, Dame Jennifer served as the Leader of the Progressive Labour Party and as Bermuda&#x27;s Opposition Leader.

===Premier of Bermuda===
After two years as Opposition Leader, Smith led her party to victory in parliamentary elections in November 1998, in which the United Bermuda Party, which had dominated elections since autonomy was gained in 1968, suffered an unprecedented defeat.

The Progressive Labour Party again won parliamentary elections in July 2003, but less than a week later, Smith was forced to resign as premier following a coup within her own party. She was replaced by W. Alex Scott, but then was elected as Deputy Speaker of the House of Assembly.

==Damehood==
Smith was made a Dame Commander of the Order of the British Empire in 2005.

<text>Daniel Orlando Smith, OBE (born 28 August 1944) is a British Virgin Islands politician and the former Premier of the British Virgin Islands from 2011 to 2019 and from 2003 to 2007. He also formerly served as Chief Minister of the British Virgin Islands (as the role was formerly known before the 2007 constitution was adopted) from 2003 to 2007. He first won the office when his National Democratic Party won the 2003 general election, being the party&#x27;s first victory at a general election in its history.

Orlando Smith originally qualified as a physician, specialising in obstetrics, and was the territory&#x27;s chief medical officer for many years both before and after entering politics. He entered politics at a relatively late stage of his career, being first elected to the Legislative Council of the British Virgin Islands (now called the House of Assembly) in the 1999 general election, as the head of the newly formed National Democratic Party (NDP). In 2003, Smith led the NDP to victory, defeating the ruling Virgin Islands Party for the first time since 1983 in the 2003 general election.

However, in the 2007 general election, Smith and his party suffered a defeat at the hands of the Virgin Islands Party, retaining only two seats (one of which was Smith&#x27;s) out of 13 elected seats. Smith barely retained his seat as the at-large candidate, receiving the fourth largest number of votes. Smith remained in the legislature as the head of the opposition.

In the 2011 general election Smith and the National Democratic Party rebounded, and won an overall majority. Accordingly, he was invited by the governor to form a new government. He followed that with a second successive victory in the 2015 general election becoming only the second politician in the Territory to win three general elections as party leader. He passed Willard Wheatley as the third longest serving head of Government in British Virgin Islands history on 14 February 2016. However, he would need to win a fourth term to surpass Ralph O&#x27;Neal in second place.

During his political career, Smith has stood in each election as an &quot;at large&quot; candidate, and so is not affiliated with any individual political district. In each election that he had stood in other than the 2007 election, he had garnered more votes than any other at large candidate (under the current political system in the British Virgin Islands, the four at large candidates with the highest number of votes are elected to the Legislative Council together with the representatives of each of the political districts; each voter casts up to five votes – one for the representative of their district, and up to four for the at large candidates).

In June 2018 Smith indicated he would be stepping down and not contesting the next general election.

<doc id="740317" wikidata="Q2744101" url="?curid=740317" title="Ting Hai effect">
<text>The Ting Hai effect, also known as the Adam Cheng effect, is a stock market phenomenon in which there is a sudden and unexplained drop in the stock market whenever a film or a television series starring Hong Kong actor Adam Cheng is released. It still remains as a popular topic among stock brokers, years after the television drama &quot;The Greed of Man&quot; was broadcast in Hong Kong in late 1992. The effect is named after Ting Hai, the primary antagonist in the drama, who was portrayed by Cheng.

==Origin==
In late 1992, the television series &quot;The Greed of Man&quot; was aired on TVB in Hong Kong. The drama centred heavily around the stock market, featuring dramatised schemes and plots by the main characters who aim to become rich through trading in the market. Ting Hai (Adam Cheng), the primary antagonist, made an immense fortune with his four sons by selling short derivatives and stocks during a bear market. Many people went broke, but the Ting family became richer and richer until their eventual defeat by the protagonist Fong Chin-bok (Sean Lau). The Ting family&#x27;s demise involves Ting Hai throwing his four adult sons off the stock exchange building before jumping after them, and the gruesome scene came to be seen as a curse on the stock market that recurs whenever a television series starring Adam Cheng is aired.

The Ting Hai effect, namely the uncanny effect Adam Cheng has on the stock market, can be traced even before &quot;Greed of Man&quot; and back to 1973, when Cheng starred in &quot;Romance in the Rain&quot;, a TVB drama series based on a novel written by Chiung Yao. That year, Hong Kong&#x27;s stock market fell 91.53%.

==Occurrences==
Initially, the Ting Hai effect occurred whenever &quot;The Greed of Man&quot; or its loose sequel, &quot;Divine Retribution&quot; (produced by ATV), was broadcast in Hong Kong. However, it was observed later that the phenomenon also takes place whenever a new film or a television series starring Adam Cheng is released.

* 4 April 2013: &quot;Saving General Yang&quot; was released in Beijing. The Hang Seng Index fell by 610 points on the following day of the premiere.

* 25 October 2022: &quot;Behind Silk Curtains&quot; to begin rerunning at TVB at midnight of 26 Oct. The Hang Seng Index fell 1,030 points (6.36%) at market close of 25 Oct. 

==Exceptions==
There were a few times when the Ting Hai effect did not occur. In April 2006, when &quot;Bar Bender&quot; was aired on TVB, there was a sudden rise in the Hang Seng index by 258 points. The index also rose over the course of the following series&#x27; airing cycle: &quot;Chor Lau-heung&quot; (1995), &quot;The Driving Power&quot; (2003), and &quot;The Conqueror&#x27;s Story&quot; (2004).

==Legacy==
The Ting Hai effect has led to Adam Cheng attracting much attention from the press. Whenever a new film or television series starring Cheng is about to be broadcast, some stockbrokers and investors in Hong Kong anticipate a drop in the market. Cheng himself does not believe that he is the cause of the stock prices falling, but has come to terms with the phenomenon.

While some investors have argued that the effect is no more than a series of coincidences and amounts to nothing more than a self-fulfilling prophecy, the phenomenon is regarded by some as more than coincidental. The French bank Crédit Lyonnais wrote a report on it.

<text>The Communication University of China (CUC) is a public university in Chaoyang, Beijing, China. It is affiliated with the Ministry of Education. The university is part of the Double First-Class Construction and Project 211.

CUC developed from what used to be a training center for technicians of the Central Broadcasting Bureau that was founded in 1954. In April 1959, it was upgraded to the Beijing Broadcasting College () approved by the State Council. In August 2004, the Beijing Broadcasting College was renamed the Communication University of China. CUC is located in the eastern part of Beijing near the ancient canal, which occupies 463,700 square meters of land and a total of 499,800 square meters of buildings.

==History==
CUC&#x27;s history dates back to March 3, 1954, when the first training class for broadcasting professionals was held by the then Central Radio Administration. This then led to the founding of Beijing Broadcasting College in 1958. On September 7, 1959, CUC&#x27;s precursor Beijing Broadcasting Institute (BBI) was established.

== Confucius Institutes ==
Communication University of China has co-established three Confucius Institutes for providing Chinese language and cultural education for learners outside of China.

* Belgrade Confucius Institute (in cooperation with University of Belgrade, Serbia)
* Groningen Confucius Institute (in cooperation with University of Groningen, Hanze University of Applied Sciences Groningen, and the Municipality of Groningen.)
* Confucius Institute at Federal University of Rio Grand Do Sul (in cooperation with the Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Sul, Brasil)

==Modern foreign languages teaching==

Communication University of China is one of the officially-sanctioned important base in China for teaching foreign languages and especially narrowly-used languages. It once offered English, Spanish, French, Russian, German, Japanese, Korean, Portuguese and other language courses.

There is a Center for Portuguese Studies (originally, &quot;Centro de Língua Portuguesa Dr. Stanley Ho&quot;) under a Cooperation Protocol between CUC, Camões Institute (Portugal) and IPOR (Macau) since 2005.

==Rankings &amp; Reputation==
Communication University of China was a &quot;Project 211&quot; university.

Sohu regarded CUC as one of the most competitive universities for admission in China in 2018.

In September 2017, CUC was selected as one of 140 Double First-Class Construction universities approved by the Ministry of Education.

In the fourth round of China University Subject Rankings (CUSR) by the Chinese Ministry of Education in 2018, Communication University of China ranked first in mainland China with its two disciplinary areas evaluated as A+ disciplines, including &quot;Journalism and Communication&quot; and &quot;Drama, Film and Television Studies&quot; and ranked third with A− in &quot;Art Theory&quot;, tenth with B+ in &quot;Design&quot;, 19th with B in &quot;Fine Arts&quot; in China.

<text>Maud Solveig Christina Adams (née Wikström; 12 February 1945) is a Swedish actress and model, best known for her roles as two different Bond girls, first in &quot;The Man with the Golden Gun&quot; (1974) and then as the title character in &quot;Octopussy&quot; (1983).

She made many other appearances in both films and television including &quot;The Christian Licorice Store&quot; (1971), &quot;Rollerball&quot; (1975), &quot;Killer Force&quot; (1976), &quot;Merciless Man&quot; (1976), &quot;Hell Hunters&quot; (1986) and &quot;The Kill Reflex&quot; (1989).

==Early life==
Adams was born as Maud Solveig Christina Wikström in Luleå, Sweden, the daughter of Thyra, a government tax inspector, and Gustav Wikström, a comptroller. She is fluent in five languages, and at one time wanted to work as an interpreter. 

Adams was discovered in 1963 in a shop by a photographer who asked to take her picture, which he then submitted to the &quot;Miss Sweden&quot; contest arranged by the magazine &quot;Allers&quot;; from there her modeling career took off.

==Career==
Adams moved to Paris and later to New York City to work for Eileen Ford. Her acting career started when she was asked to appear in the 1970 movie &quot;The Boys in the Band&quot;, in which she played a photo-shoot model in the opening credits. During the 1970s she guest-starred in such American TV series as &quot;Hawaii Five-O&quot; and &quot;Kojak&quot;.

Adams was catapulted to international fame as the doomed mistress of the villain (Christopher Lee) in &quot;The Man with the Golden Gun&quot; (1974). In short order she appeared in Norman Jewison&#x27;s futuristic &quot;Rollerball&quot; (1975) and several European films, and she starred in the obsession thriller &quot;Tattoo&quot; (1981) with Bruce Dern. She was so well regarded by James Bond film series producer Albert Broccoli that she was asked to return in &quot;Octopussy&quot; in 1983, this time as a lead, the title character—an exotic and mysterious smuggler, again opposite Roger Moore. Adams had Swedish co-stars in her three Bond films: Britt Ekland as Mary Goodnight in &quot;The Man with the Golden Gun&quot;; in &quot;Octopussy&quot; both Kristina Wayborn as Magda, and Mary Stävin as an Octopussy girl; and in &quot;A View to a Kill&quot; (1985), in which she was an extra, Mary Stävin played agent Kimberley Jones, and Dolph Lundgren played Venz. While portraying a Bond girl has not always indicated continued success as an actress, Adams comments, &quot;Looking back on it, how can you not really enjoy the fact that you were a Bond Girl? It&#x27;s pop culture and to be part of that is very nice.&quot;

Adams appeared in the U. S. television series &quot;Emerald Point NAS&quot; in 1983 and 1984, but was unable to sustain her high profile, falling back on second-rate material such as &quot;Jane and the Lost City&quot; in 1987. In September of that year she also appeared in &quot;Playboy&quot; in an issue on the Bond girls.

She hosted the Swedish TV show &quot;Kafé Luleå&quot; in 1994, and played a guest role in the Swedish soap opera &quot;Vita lögner&quot; in 1998. 

She guest-starred in &quot;That &#x27;70s Show&quot; in 2000, appearing as a bridesmaid to Tanya Roberts, along with Kristina Wayborn (her &quot;Octopussy&quot; co-star) and Barbara Carrera; all four share the title of &#x27;Bond girl&#x27;. 

She also was the president of a cosmetics company called Scandinavian Biocosmetics.

==Personal life==
Adams married photographer Roy Adams in 1966 and then divorced him in 1975, though she retained his surname as a professional name. She married her current husband, mediator and retired Los Angeles judge Charles &quot;Skip&quot; Rubin, in 1999. Adams has no children from either marriage.

<text>is an erotic dating sim visual novel. It is the first game in the &quot;Dōkyūsei&quot; series of adult-themed dating sims by ELF Corporation. It was released in 1992, with a heavily altered Windows version released in 1999.

A Game Boy Color mahjong game with &quot;Dōkyūsei&quot; characters, &quot;Jankyusei&quot; (雀級生), was released in 2001.

A remake (based on the Windows version) was released on February 26, 2021 in Japan.

==Game system==
The gameplay in &quot;Dōkyūsei&quot; revolves around wandering through different locations in a town, conversing with whatever character the player happens to meet. To finish the storyline of a particular girl, the main challenge is to learn the times of day when the girl will be in a location.

==Remake==

An international version of the remake was developed by the company Shiravune, a subsidiary of DMM Games, and released on April 14, 2022.Both an all-ages and adult version was released, with the adult version containing erotic scenes and racier dialogue. 

The international version was well received by critics, with Ivanir Ignacchitti of GameBlast commenting on the historical value of the title and Thomas Knight of NookGaming noting that the remake does well at fixing most of the issues that would make the game seem dated.

==OVA==
There was an OVA series made from &quot;Dōkyūsei&quot;, which was originally a 45-minute one-shot, but the original release was expanded into two half-hour episodes, with two more episodes added, for a total four. The first two episodes were released as &quot;End of Summer&quot;, and episodes three and four were released as &quot;End of Summer 2&quot; in the North American market by SoftCel Pictures, an imprint of ADV Films. A two-episode sequel, titled &quot;Dōkyūsei Climax Files&quot;, was also released.

&quot;End of Summer&quot; is about a boy who seeks after a redheaded girl named Mai and along the way runs into difficulties (and trysts) with several other girls, namely, Kurumi, Miho, Misa, and Satomi. It was renowned for its romantic attributes and quality of animation. The depth of character development has been reviewed as being above average, although the format forced on it by OVA requires some compromises with realism.

An OVA based on the remake, &quot;Doukyuusei Remake The Animation&quot;, was released in 2022 and 2024.

=== Music ===
The OVAs use some classical music, including: 
==Reception and legacy==

Jun Maeda, co-founder of visual novel studio Key, credits &quot;Dōkyūsei&quot; as a pioneer in the &quot;nakige&quot; (&quot;crying game&quot;) genre and as an influence on Key&#x27;s own such games.

<text>Starsiege is a mecha-style vehicle simulation game developed by Dynamix and released in 1999. &quot;Starsiege&quot; is set in the / universe, which contains its predecessors &quot;&quot; (1994), &quot;Battledrome&quot; (1994), and &quot;Earthsiege 2&quot; (1996). This universe also includes action game &quot;Hunter Hunted&quot; (1996), strategy games &quot;Mission Force: Cyberstorm&quot; (1996) and &quot;Cyberstorm 2: Corporate Wars&quot; (1998). It also includes the sequels &quot;&quot; (actually released before &quot;Starsiege&quot;) and all subsequent &quot;Tribes&quot; titles. In 2015, this game and the rest of the &quot;Metaltech/Tribes&quot; series were released as freeware by Hi-Rez Studios, but Battledrome and the Cyberstorm series were not.

==Plot==

&quot;Starsiege&quot; takes place in the 29th century, portraying the conflict between humanity and the artificially intelligent Cybrid war machines. Played out in various locations throughout the solar system, the story examines both civil unrest in the colonies and an all-or-nothing genocidal invasion by the machines. Bipedal mecha known as HERCs are the mainstay of ground-based combat, and the focus of gameplay.

Humanity is nominally united in an interplanetary Empire, led from Earth by the Immortal Emperor Solomon Petresun. Petresun&#x27;s policy is the defence of Earth at all costs. While Earth is prosperous and well protected, the colonies on Luna, Mars, and Venus suffer from increasingly harsh regulations and production quotas. The combat units of the Empire are represented by the Imperial Police, Terran Defense Force and the Imperial Knights. The former paramilitary group is responsible for maintaining order in the colonies. The Terran Defense Force are the standard military with bases from Mercury to Titan. The Knights, led by Grand Master Caanon Weathers, are the military&#x27;s elite and are provided with the best pilots and equipment.

The inequality between the colonies and Earth foments rebellion. In 2802 there are two guerilla movements on Mars, one that concentrates on destroying and capturing Imperial infrastructure and supplies and another bent on killing Imperial personnel and sympathizers. Both groups operate from underground bases and make do with modified mining HERCs and tanks. The rebels partially offset their disadvantages with superior weapons taken from the alien &quot;Tharsis Cache&quot;; an underground stockpile of alien technology discovered by rebels while digging new tunnels. Eventually the rebellion becomes too great for the police to contain and the Knights are deployed to Mars to crush the insurrection.

The Cybrids are a race of sentient robots responsible for the first Earthsiege. They are led by the first Cybrid, Prometheus, who is revered with god-like status. The Cybrids established themselves in the outer solar system after being defeated two centuries before during the first Earthsiege. Since then they have built up their strength for another bid to destroy humanity and claim Earth for their own. Like the Martian rebels, the Cybrids discover their own cache of alien weapons and adapt it to use, but their cache is inferior to the Tharsis Cache.

The game offers two story campaigns, with different endings. The Human campaign puts the player in control of a Martian rebel, initially fighting the Empire before humanity unites against the Cybrid invasion midway through the campaign. The human campaign culminates in an attack on Prometheus on Pluto. The Cybrid campaign starts with their invasion across the outer colonies and proceeds to Earth, ending in an assault on the Imperial palace to kill Petresun.

==Gameplay==
As a simulation, &quot;Starsiege&quot; offers players the ability to pilot a wide variety of massive bipedal war machines known as &quot;HERCULAN&quot;s (Humaniform-Emulation Roboticized Combat Unit with Leg-Articulated Navigation) (or &#x27;HERCs&#x27; for short), as well as several tanks. Set in 2829, &quot;Starsiege&quot; contains an array of advanced technology, and numerous upgrades are available for each vehicle. &quot;Starsiege&quot; takes place across a number of planets and moons in the Solar System, offering a range of different locations throughout the game and in multiplayer battles, including Earth, Titan, Luna, Mars, Venus, and Mercury. There are two campaigns, Human and Cybrid.

Gameplay in &quot;Starsiege&quot; revolves around mechanized combat - piloting HERCs and tanks in combat against opposing vehicles. Both types of vehicles can be controlled via any combination of keyboard, joystick, or mouse input. Starsiege abandoned the &quot;torso-twist&quot; gameplay mechanic common in many mecha simulations (including preceding games in the series), a feature that would normally allow the user to swivel the HERC&#x27;s upper body independently of its legs. In Starsiege, torso orientation is fixed forward, but the player can move the aiming recticle across the screen with a mouse, a feature &quot;GameSpot&quot; compared to playing a first-person shooter. In both campaigns, the player is eventually assigned squadmates and is able to issue basic commands to them.

Every vehicle has unique performance, though this can be modified somewhat through customization of parts. Tanks and HERCs both utilize armor for defense, but HERCs also can equip rechargeable shields for additional protection. Other part choices include weapons, engine, and engine boosters. Customizing the player&#x27;s vehicle is an important element of gameplay, particularly in multiplayer - a proper balance between all of the components is necessary to assure the player a reasonable chance of success.

Multiplayer gameplay includes classic modes deathmatch, team deathmatch, and capture the flag.

==Development==

The game was announced in May 1998.

==Reception==
&quot;Starsiege&quot; received &quot;generally favorable reviews&quot; according to the review aggregation website GameRankings. &quot;IGN&quot; highlighted the well presented package and cutscenes, graphically impressive (whilst sparse) landscapes, intuitive controls and the longevity of the multiplayer mode. The minimal sound effects were criticised, with muddled voice-overs, and some of human HERC models were felt to be a bit bland and generic. &quot;GameSpot&quot; said, &quot;Starsiege brings new life to a genre otherwise devoid of it, even if it doesn&#x27;t really succeed in elevating robot sims out of their long-term rut.&quot; &quot;Next Generation&quot; called it &quot;a worthy successor to the &quot;Earthsiege&quot; series [that] should be just as attractive to fans of &quot;Heavy Gear&quot; or &quot;Mechwarrior II&quot; .&quot;

In February 1999, Dynamix announced that it would launch the game with a shipment of 250,000 units to retailers. It sold 36,000 units in the U.S. by the end of July 1999, according to PC Data. Calling these figures &quot;pitiful&quot;, Mark Asher of &quot;CNET Gamecenter&quot; wrote, &quot;Sierra gave this game a big push and it just didn&#x27;t sell, and now most of Dynamix is gone.&quot;

The same website nominated the game for its 1999 &quot;Best Sci-Fi Simulation&quot; award, but gave the prize to &quot;MechWarrior 3&quot;.

==Sequels==
The first-person shooters &quot;&quot; (1998; released before &quot;Starsiege&quot;), &quot;Tribes 2&quot; (2001), &quot;&quot; (2002), &quot;&quot; (2004) and &quot; (2012)&quot; followed this game.

Starsiege 2845 was a game in development from 2003 to 2007. Like the later Tribes Universe game developed in 2010–2011, it stagnated into hiatus and was not completed.

In 2015, the game was bundled with and released as freeware by Hi-Rez Studios.

In September 2022, Prophecy Games announced Starsiege: Deadzone, a first-person PvP and PvE looter shooter with procedurally generated environments.

<text>A spitz (; , in reference to the pointed muzzle) is a type of domestic dog consisting of between 50 and 70 breeds depending on classification. There is no precise definition of &#x27;spitz&#x27; but typically most spitz breeds have pricked ears, almond shaped eyes, a pointed muzzle, a double coat, and a tail that curves over the back.

The exact origins of spitz dogs remain unknown, though most of the spitzes seen today originate from the Arctic region or from Siberia. Johann Friedrich Gmelin described the type as &quot;Canis pomeranus&quot; in his 1788 revision of &quot;Systema Naturae&quot;.

==History==
Dogs of spitz type have been depicted on the tombs of the IVth dynasty of Egypt. Toy dogs of spitz type have been depicted since 500 B.C. in Ancient Greek pottery.

==Characteristics==
Spitzes are well suited to living in harsh northern climates. They often have an insulating, waterproof undercoat that is denser than the topcoat to trap warmth. Small, upright ears help to reduce the risk of frostbite, square proportions and thick fur that grows on the paws protects the dogs from sharp ice. Many spitz breeds, like the Japanese Akita and Chow Chow, retain wolf-like characteristics such as independence, suspiciousness, and aggression towards unfamiliar humans and other dogs, and they require much training and socialization when they are puppies before they become manageable in an urban environment. Some, such as the Karelian Bear Dog, are more difficult to train as companion dogs. Some breeds, such as the Pomeranian, have . Several spitz breeds (such as huskies) are bred for one purpose only. However it is common for many spitz breeds (such as the Russian laikas) to be general purpose dogs in their native lands, used for hunting, hauling, herding, and guarding. Smaller breeds have faces that resemble fox faces, while larger breeds have faces that resemble wolf faces.

==Companions and toys==
Some spitzes, with their thick fur, fluffy ruffs, curled tails and small muzzles and ears, have been bred into non-working dogs designed to be companions or lap dogs. This trend is most evident in the tiny Pomeranian, which was originally a much larger dog closer to the size of a Keeshond before being bred down to make an acceptable court animal.

The Keeshond, the Wolfspitz variety of the German Spitz, is an affectionate, loyal, and very energetic pet that was bred as a watchdog for barges (hence the name Dutch Barge Dog). Often, these breeds are recognized for their &quot;smiling&quot; mouths. Other spitzes that have been bred away from working uses are the American Eskimo Dog, Alaskan Klee Kai, German Spitz, Volpino Italiano and Japanese Spitz.

<doc id="740359" wikidata="Q1033465" url="?curid=740359" title="The Cannon Group, Inc.">
<text>The Cannon Group, Inc. was an American group of companies, including Cannon Films, which produced films from 1967 to 1994. The extensive group also owned, amongst others, a large international cinema chain and a video film company that invested heavily in the video market, buying the international video rights to several classic film libraries. Some of their best known films include &quot;Joe&quot; (1970), &quot;Runaway Train&quot; (1985) and &quot;Street Smart&quot; (1987), all of which were Oscar-nominated.

== 1967–1979: Friedland/Dewey era ==
Cannon Films was incorporated on October 23, 1967. It was formed by Dennis Friedland and Chris Dewey while they were in their early 20s. They had immediate success producing English-language versions of Swedish soft porn films directed by Joseph W. Sarno: &quot;Inga&quot; (1968), aka &quot;Jag––en oskuld&quot; and &quot;To Ingrid, My Love, Lisa&quot; (1968), aka &quot;Kvinnolek&quot;. By 1970, they had produced films on a larger production scale than a lot of major distributors, such as &quot;Joe&quot;, starring Peter Boyle.

They managed this by tightly limiting their budgets to $300,000 per picture—or less, in some cases. The success of &quot;Joe&quot; brought more attention to the company. As the 1970s moved on, a string of unsuccessful films seriously drained Cannon&#x27;s capital. This, along with changes to film-production tax laws, led to a drop in Cannon&#x27;s stock price.

== 1979–1987: Golan-Globus era ==
By 1979, Cannon had hit serious financial difficulties, and Friedland and Dewey sold Cannon to Israeli cousins Menahem Golan and Yoram Globus for $500,000. The two cousins forged a business model of buying bottom-barrel scripts and putting them into production. They produced such films in a variety of genres, although their biggest successes were with action films. They tapped into a ravenous market for B movies in the 1980s. After buying the rights to the 1974 film &quot;Death Wish&quot;, Cannon produced three sequels to it in the 1980s, all starring Charles Bronson. Despite receiving negative reviews from the critics, these films were financially successful, especially &quot;Death Wish II&quot; (1982), which earned over $40 million on an $8 million budget.

Other major hits for Cannon were a series of action movies starring Chuck Norris, including &quot;Missing in Action&quot; (1984), &quot;Invasion U.S.A.&quot; (1985) and &quot;The Delta Force&quot; (1986). &quot;Missing in Action&quot; was criticized heavily as being a preemptive cash-in on the &quot;Rambo&quot; franchise. James Cameron&#x27;s story treatment for &quot;&quot; was floating around Hollywood in 1983, which Golan and Globus reviewed and were &quot;inspired&quot; by. The writers of &quot;MIA&quot; even gave Cameron credit saying their film was inspired by his script treatment.

The Cannon Group ignited a worldwide ninja craze with &quot;The Ninja Trilogy&quot;, a film series which consisted of &quot;Enter the Ninja&quot; (1981), &quot;Revenge of the Ninja&quot; (1983), and &quot;Ninja III: The Domination&quot; (1984), all starring Sho Kosugi, as well as &quot;American Ninja&quot; (1985) and its sequel &quot;American Ninja 2: The Confrontation&quot; (1987). Other action/adventure films they produced included the 3-D &quot;Treasure of the Four Crowns&quot;, &quot;King Solomon&#x27;s Mines&quot;, and the vigilante thriller sequel &quot;Exterminator 2&quot;.

The Cannon Group&#x27;s biggest financial success was with the 1986 action film &quot;Cobra&quot;, which starred Sylvester Stallone; not a low-budget film, it earned $160 million on a $25 million budget.

Cannon produced musical and comedy films such as &quot;Breakin&#x27;&quot;, &quot;Breakin’ 2: Electric Boogaloo&quot;, &quot;The Last American Virgin&quot;, and the U.S. release of &quot;The Apple&quot; (directed by Golan); erotic period drama pictures such as &quot;Lady Chatterley&#x27;s Lover&quot; (1981), &quot;Bolero&quot;, and &quot;Mata Hari&quot; (1985); science fiction and fantasy films such as &quot;Hercules&quot;, &quot;Lifeforce&quot;, and &quot;The Barbarians&quot;; and serious pictures such as John Cassavetes&#x27; &quot;Love Streams&quot;, Franco Zeffirelli&#x27;s &quot;Otello&quot; (a film version of the Verdi opera), Norman Mailer&#x27;s &quot;Tough Guys Don&#x27;t Dance&quot;, and Andrei Konchalovsky&#x27;s &quot;Runaway Train&quot; and &quot;Shy People&quot;.

During these years, Cannon prominently advertised at the Cannes Film Festival each year. Substantial pre-sales of the next years&#x27; films (often involving ancillary rights, including international distribution, home video, and television rights to Cannon&#x27;s productions) were made based on the strong salesmanship skills of Globus. The deposits made from these sales financed production of the first film in the production line-up, which—when completed and delivered to theatre owners around the world—generated enough money to make the next film in the line-up. in the Netherlands (which had provided Cannon&#x27;s start-up capital in 1979) and their principal loan officer, Frans Afman, provided bridge financing until the pre-sales amounts were collected; this role was inherited by Credit Lyonnais after their purchase of Slavenburg&#x27;s in 1983. 

In 1982, The Cannon Group, Inc. entered into a relationship with MGM/UA Entertainment Co. with the latter company serving as Cannon&#x27;s distributor for North American theatrical and video releases; this would not be the last time Cannon dealt with MGM. In 1984, Cannon expanded further into Europe, signing with UGC for French distribution, and acquiring Kenneth Rive&#x27;s Gala Films, which was absorbed into Cannon Group&#x27;s U.K. distribution arm. On June 25, 1985, Cannon bought the rights to produce future films based on the comic book character &quot;Superman&quot; from the Salkinds, and struck a distribution assignment with Warner Bros. (owners of the &quot;Superman&quot; property) for a 1987 release. Cannon also further expanded their French assets, with the aim of becoming the largest film distributor in France.

By 1986, output reached an apex with 43 films in one year. Golan remained chairman of the board, while Globus served as president. That year, Cannon attempted to produce film adaptations of the stage plays &quot;Zorba&quot; and &quot;American Buffalo&quot;, but these films never materialized. Another film project that ultimately never materialized was a live-action film based on &quot;Barbie&quot;, with a planned plotline concerning the eponymous doll showing her owner that her dreams could come true. Warner Bros. would eventually release a live-action movie based on the property in 2023. Other areas of interest included plans for television adaptation of Cannon properties, and following up their adaptation of &quot;Rumpelstiltskin&quot; with a total of 12 fairy tale films as the &quot;Cannon Movie Tales&quot; series; Cannon wound up releasing only a few of the fairy tales.

Film critic Roger Ebert said of Golan-Globus in 1987, &quot;no other production organization in the world today—certainly not any of the seven Hollywood &#x27;majors&#x27;—has taken more chances with serious, marginal films than Cannon.&quot;
That year, Cannon gained its greatest artistic success: its 1986 Dutch production &quot;The Assault&quot; won the 1987 Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film and a Golden Globe Award for Best Foreign Language Film. Meanwhile, &quot;Otello&quot;, based on the opera of the same name, also received a Golden Globe nomination that year.

Golan and Cannon Films tended to over-promote films that did not live up to expectations. For instance, &quot;Lifeforce&quot; (1985) was to be &quot;the cinematic sci-fi event of the &#x27;80s&quot; and &quot;Masters of the Universe&quot; (1987) was dubbed &quot;the &quot;Star Wars&quot; of the &#x27;80s.&quot; Diversifying from film production, Cannon had begun purchasing film distributors and movie theaters. The purchases ranged from European companies (Thorn EMI Screen Entertainment, Tuschinski Theatres, a 49-screen theater chain in the Netherlands, and the 53-screen Cannon Cinema Italia) to the sixth-largest chain in the United States, the 425-screen &quot;marginally profitable&quot; Commonwealth Theaters.

In addition, Cannon also owned the film rights to &quot;Spider-Man&quot;, and planned to produce a &quot;Spider-Man&quot; film in the mid-1980s. Golan and Globus agreed to pay Marvel Comics $225,000 over the five-year option period, plus a percentage of the film&#x27;s revenues. The rights would revert to Marvel if a film was not made by April 1990. Marvel and Sony would eventually complete and release a Spider-Man film in 2002 directed by Sam Raimi after the rights had been re-secured, following a lengthy and messy legal battle between Marvel, Sony and several other parties over the film rights.

Cannon&#x27;s films proved to be much more popular in the United Kingdom than in its native United States, which is why Cannon acquired several British cinema chains during the 1980s, and founded the mail-order video distribution service Videolog as a joint venture with Columbia House Europe, Ltd. in the mid-1980s. From the mid-1980s until the mid-1990s, Cannon Cinemas were a familiar sight in the United Kingdom until Richard Branson&#x27;s Virgin Group bought the remaining sites and rebranded them as Virgin Cinemas in 1995. Cannon purchased the assets of Thorn EMI Screen Entertainment from businessman Alan Bond in April 1986 for £175 million; the renamed Cannon Screen Entertainment and archrival The Rank Organization jointly signed a $10 million agreement with the BBC that August for the latter to broadcast both companies&#x27; films.

== 1987–1991: Parretti era ==
By 1988, a cooling in the film market and a series of box office disappointments—including the multimillion-dollar production of &quot;Superman IV: The Quest for Peace&quot; (1987), whose original $36-million budget was slashed to $17 million—had once again put Cannon in financial woes. Concerns about Cannon&#x27;s financial future had been expressed as early as 1986; one unidentified film executive called the company a &quot;house of cards&quot;, with Golan and Globus -- between their splashy wheeling and dealing, reports of &quot;penny-pinching&quot; by the duo in terms of business expenses, and numerous lawsuits incurred by the company (including one filed by David Begelman over Cannon&#x27;s buyout of the Thorn EMI assets; Thorn EMI had been a financing partner of Begelman&#x27;s Gladden Entertainment) -- attaining an unwelcome reputation in the Hollywood community. Dustin Hoffman also filed suit against Cannon, after the company purportedly breached a contract signed with the actor by taking out full-page advertisements to promote Hoffman&#x27;s involvement with Cannon.

The company signed a $75 million agreement with Warner Bros. to handle part of their assets; however, the financial loss was staggering. Following the purchase of the Thorn EMI assets, Cannon was severely stretched, and faced bankruptcy; in May 1987, Cannon sold its 2,000-title Thorn-EMI library for $85 million to Weintraub Entertainment Group. Shortly afterwards, Cannon dropped out of the HBO/Cannon Video joint venture with HBO due to Cannon&#x27;s ongoing financial problems.

The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission began an investigation into Cannon&#x27;s financial reports, suspecting that Cannon had fraudulently misstated them. On the verge of failure, Cannon Films was taken over by Pathé Communications, a holding company controlled by Italian financier Giancarlo Parretti. Financed by the French bank Crédit Lyonnais, already involved with Cannon for years, Pathé Communications&#x27; takeover of Cannon immediately began a corporate restructuring and refinancing of $250 million to pay off Cannon&#x27;s debt. By 1989, Golan, citing differences with both Parretti and Globus, resigned from his position and left Cannon to start 21st Century Film Corporation, while Globus remained with Pathé.

One of the final films produced by Golan and Globus that received a wide release under the Cannon Films banner was the post-apocalyptic action film &quot;Cyborg&quot;. This film was conceived to use both the sets and costumes built for a planned but unmade sequel to &quot;Masters of the Universe&quot; as well as the ill-fated live-action version of &quot;Spider-Man&quot;. Both projects were planned to shoot simultaneously under the direction of Albert Pyun. Not to let that pre-production work go to waste, Pyun wrote &quot;Cyborg&quot;, with Chuck Norris in mind, suggesting it to Cannon Films. Jean-Claude Van Damme was cast in the lead role.

Following Golan&#x27;s departure from Cannon, he became the head of 21st Century Film Corporation, an independent company. The Cannon Group was renamed and restructured by Parretti with Globus being made co-president of Pathé Communications and chairman of Cannon International and Alan Ladd Jr. was brought in as chairman of Pathé Entertainment. In 1989, Pathé greenlit three films, &quot;The Russia House&quot; with Sean Connery and Michelle Pfeiffer, &quot;Quigley Down Under&quot; starring Tom Selleck and &quot;Fires Within&quot; with Jimmy Smits. They also announced &quot;Shattered&quot; directed by Wolfgang Petersen, &quot;Not Without My Daughter&quot; with Sally Field, &quot;Company Business&quot; starring Gene Hackman and Mikhail Baryshnikov as well as Ridley Scott&#x27;s &quot;Thelma &amp; Louise&quot;. They signed a domestic distribution deal with Warner Bros. for its theatrical product.

Soon after announcing a new slate of films and the distribution deal with Warner Bros., Parretti made a $1.2 billion bid for Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, backed by Crédit Lyonnais. The bid was accepted and Parretti merged Pathé Communications and MGM to create MGM-Pathé Communications. With the merger majority of the former Cannon Group library became part of the MGM library (certain rights for other media and select films during the Thorn EMI merger now lie with other entities). As MGM-Pathé had a distribution deal with Warner Bros. (and who had part financed Parretti&#x27;s takeover bid), Parretti axed the MGM/UA Home Video department as one of his first acts in charge, resulting in the loss of eighty jobs.

Crédit Lyonnais foreclosed on Parretti in July 1991 after he defaulted on loan payments and sued for the removal of Paretti, his wife Maria Cecconi, his daughter Valentina Parretti, Yoram Globus, Florio Fiorini, Danny Dimbort, Antonio Pares-Neira and Lewis Horowitz from the board of directors.

Parretti -- pushed out of management control of MGM-Pathé and the board -- proceeded to countersue Crédit Lyonnais, claiming they destroyed his ability to make money at MGM-Pathé, in an attempt to wrestle control back. Parretti was later convicted of perjury and evidence tampering in a Delaware court for statements he made in a 1991 civil case, brought by Credit Lyonnais to validate their removal of Parretti, to the effect that a document he claimed allowed him to retain control of MGM was authentic; he fled the country for Italy before he could be sentenced or extradited to France, where he was wanted on criminal charges related to his use of MGM&#x27;s French assets.

In 1997, the California Superior Court in Los Angeles entered a final judgement in a separate civil suit against Parretti, ordering him to pay $1.48 billion to Credit Lyonnais. After Federal prosecutors unsealed an indictment against Parretti and Florio Fiorini accusing them of fraud in 1999, Italian authorities arrested both men and held them for extradition to the United States. Parretti was released by the court of appeal in Perugia shortly thereafter, ordered to remain in his home town of Orvieto and report to the police three times a week, even though authorities in Rome had requested he be held pending a decision on the extradition.

== 1989–1997: Cannon Pictures, Inc. era ==
Even as the original Cannon became part of Pathé and subsequently MGM, Parretti opted to reform Cannon in 1989 as his low-budget filmmaking arm (now known as Cannon Pictures, Inc.), led by veteran Italian film producer Ovidio G. Assonitis. 

The new Cannon announced their presence at that year&#x27;s MIFED international film market in Milan, with an impressive line-up of multiple new productions and releases, including some with Cannon standbys like Chuck Norris (&quot;Fifty/Fifty&quot;, &quot;Delta Force 2: The Colombian Connection&quot; and &quot;TOP KICK&quot;) and Michael Dudikoff (&quot;WINGS, Midnight Ride&quot; and &quot;American Ninja 4&quot;), &quot;JAM&quot; to be directed by Joel Silberg, &quot;Dusted&quot; (later released as &quot;Death Warrant&quot; with Jean-Claude Van Damme), &quot;Keaton&#x27;s Cop&quot; with Lee Majors, an untitled film starring Charles Bronson, &quot;Crack House&quot; with Richard Roundtree and Jim Brown, &quot;Rockula&quot;, &quot;The Rose Garden&quot; with Maximilian Schell and Liv Ullmann, &quot;The Secret of the Ice Cave&quot; with Michael Moriarty and Sally Kellerman and &quot;A Man Called Sarge&quot;. The new slate of pictures was expected to cost $50 million. The company managed to post a small operating profit before the end of the year. &quot;JAM&quot; was rebranded as &quot;Lambada&quot; to cash in on the craze and was released in 1990.

However, the troubles of parent Pathé soon began to affect the re-established Cannon. After the MGM-Pathé merger, Parretti agreed to sell Pathé&#x27;s 60% majority stake in Cannon Pictures to Assonitis and a group of investors for $14 million. The sale would include the office building at 8200 Wiltshire Blvd, where Cannon Pictures was based. Parretti tried to push the deal through quickly to release some capital for MGM-Pathé; however, the deal fell through less than two months later due to financing problems, and MGM-Pathé was granted an easement on financial conditions that were placed upon it by its lenders as part of the MGM buyout.

At the same board meeting, Assonitis and Cannon Pictures vice-chairman William J. Immerman were fired and replaced by Danny Dimbort. Cannon&#x27;s marketing and casting operations were shut down by Pathé. All of Cannon Pictures&#x27; marketing was placed under Pathé&#x27;s existing operations. Former Cannon Group production head Christopher Pearce was named as Assonitis&#x27; replacement and in November 1990, he bought Pathé&#x27;s stake in Cannon Pictures for $14 million with a deal which allowed Pathé to distribute &quot;Lambada&quot;, &quot;Midnight Ride&quot; and &quot;American Ninja 4&quot;.

Under Pearce, Cannon Pictures announced it would keep contracts with players Charles Bronson, Chuck Norris and Michael Dudikoff signed under Golan&#x27;s management and revealed a slate of films for 1991, &quot;Fifty/Fifty&quot; (now starring Peter Weller and Robert Hays), &quot;No Place to Hide&quot; with Kris Kristofferson and Drew Barrymore, &quot;The Hitman&quot; (with Norris), as well as &quot;The Human Shield&quot; and &quot;Rescue Me&quot; (both with Dudikoff). Richard Inouye joined the company in February 1991 as vice-president and CFO. &quot;American Ninja V&quot; and the unmade &quot;Ants of God&quot; were added to the slate at the AFM in 1991 and Warner Home Video signed an agreement to distribute Cannon Pictures&#x27; output in North America, UK, Japan, Italy and Australia for ten years.

Cannon Pictures greatly expanded its slate in time for the Cannes Film Festival in 1991 with a total of 18 films, in addition to those already announced, &quot;American Kickboxer 1&quot;, &quot;Black Cat Run&quot; with Dudikoff, &quot;The Borrower&quot;, &quot;Deep End&quot; and &quot;Dream Lover&quot; from Boaz Davidson, &quot;Delta Force 3: The Killing Game&quot;, &quot;Ninja: The American Samurai&quot;, &quot;Solemn Oath&quot; and &quot;Terminal Bliss&quot; had all been added to Cannon&#x27;s production slate.

When Crédit Lyonnais foreclosed on Parretti in July 1991, the sale of Cannon Pictures was questioned by the bank because Pearce was a board member of MGM-Pathé at the time of the sale and the disclosure of interest of Pearce was not stated in documentation. Crédit Lyonnais&#x27; legal filings against Parretti also named Dimbort, a member of the board of both companies, for receiving $140,000 &quot;for services rendered, although Mr Dimbort did not perform any services to justify payments&quot;. Globus was eventually dismissed from the Crédit Lyonnais suits and set up a foreign sales company, Melrose Entertainment, which handled much of Cannon Pictures&#x27; sales, alongside that of Global Pictures, another company run by Pearce. In the wake of the Crédit Lyonnais foreclosure on MGM-Pathé, Pearce stepped down as president of Global Pictures, being replaced by Avi Lerner.

In early 1992, there was a middle-management reshuffle at Cannon Pictures with an aim to maximize revenue from Cannon&#x27;s releases. &quot;The Hitman&quot; proved to be an early success for the new team. That March, Cannon sued Vision International and its chairman Mark Damon for $15 million over Chuck Norris&#x27; involvement in the film, &quot;Sidekicks&quot;. Cannon Pictures had retained Norris under an &quot;exclusive services&quot; contract that was made in the 1980s by Golan. Cannon Pictures loaned Norris to the makers of &quot;Sidekicks&quot; for a cameo role under the agreement that he would not appear in more than 30% of the movie; Cannon subsequently objected to Norris receiving &quot;above the title billing&quot; for the film.

At the Cannes Film Festival in 1992, Pearce and Yoram Globus announced they were merging Globus&#x27; privately held Melrose Entertainment, Pearce&#x27;s privately owned Global Pictures and the publicly traded Cannon Pictures into one single entity called the Cannon Entertainment Group. The merger was announced alongside a slate of pictures including &quot;Chicago Loop&quot; with James Spader, &quot;Cold to the Touch&quot; with Norris, &quot;Teen Angel&quot; from Boaz Davidson, &quot;Ivory&quot; to be directed by Aaron Norris, &quot;Delta Force IV: The Deadly Dozen&quot; directed by Brian Hutton and &quot;White Sun&quot; with Dudikoff, as well as a new TV show called &quot;Sam Bolt: Texas Ranger&quot;, which would later become &quot;Walker, Texas Ranger&quot;.

Shortly afterwards, they announced that Joe Lara had been signed to an exclusive 10-picture deal with the new company. Lara was then in production on &quot;American Cyborg: Steel Warrior&quot; which would not be included in the overall deal; however, no films were ultimately made from this deal. By mid-1992, the merger was cancelled after the backers were unable to come to an arrangement with Crédit Lyonnais. Cannon continued with development of &quot;Walker, Texas Ranger&quot; after CBS picked the series up for 13 episodes. Cash flow problems began to have a serious impact on the company. In October 1992, James Spader sued Cannon Pictures over his $1 million fee for his &quot;Chicago Loop&quot; pay-or-play deal; and a suit from Michael Dudikoff followed in December, stating he had not been paid from the four films he had made for Cannon.

Cannon Pictures posted a net profit of $1.3 million for the nine months ending September 1992 and secured a new $15 million line of credit from the ING Bank in Amsterdam after Crédit Lyonnais refused to lend more until their loans were fully repaid (said loans weren&#x27;t due for another four years).

In February 1993, Cannon ran out of money to continue production of &quot;Walker, Texas Ranger&quot;, due to the indictments of funding partner Banca Nazionale del Lavoro, then embroiled in a scandal over unauthorized loans to Iraq, and producers were desperately trying to raise more money to complete the miniseries. CBS Productions later stepped in with additional funds to complete the production. In August 1993, Cannon reported a net profit of $1 million for its second quarter, double the same period the previous year, due to the success of &quot;Walker, Texas Ranger&quot;. Cannon Pictures was sued for $14 million in December 1993 by Pictor Insurance Co. and the Peter Miller Corp. for breach of contract over Cannon pulling out of a financing agreement with the two companies.

With this additional pressure, Pearce began exploring selling his stock in Cannon Pictures, but this resulted in another lawsuit being filed against the company and two investment bankers, Robert Blake and Runa Alam, by the Independent Artists Picture Corp. The lawsuit claimed interference and breach of contract in connection with IAPC&#x27;s plans to buy Cannon Pictures stock in a takeover bid, which would have seen Blake purchase Pearce&#x27;s stock and Blake and Alam taking control of the day-to-day operations of the company. During this time, Pearce was also exploring a sale to Panda Pictures, but this deal collapsed in yet another lawsuit with Panda claiming $20 million in damages from Cannon Pictures after Pearce reportedly lied about the company&#x27;s financial condition.

In 1994, Cannon Pictures released its last film, &quot;Hellbound&quot;, in select theatres in Los Angeles. Shortly afterwards, Pearce sold controlling interest in Cannon Pictures to VMI Acquisitions Inc. The new owners settled some debts at the company, but shortly after the takeover, a group of creditors, including Charles Bronson and Everyvision Inc. sued Cannon Pictures to force it into bankruptcy. The creditors succeeded in pushing the company into Chapter 11 bankruptcy. Soon afterwards, it was discovered Christopher Pearce was selling disputed Cannon titles, including &quot;Twin Sitters&quot;, &quot;Delta Force 3&quot;, &quot;American Samurai&quot;, &quot;Street Knight&quot;, &quot;Tobe Hooper&#x27;s Night Terrors&quot; and &quot;American Cyborg: Steel Warrior&quot; at the Tokyo Film Festival. A judge blocked all sales made at Tokyo and blocked any further sales that were due to take place at MIFED 1994. To prevent any fraudulent deals at MIFED, a warning appeared in Screen International and other publications stating all business must be done with the court appointed trustee and not with Pearce.

The United States bankruptcy court set a deadline of January 11, 1995 for creditors of Cannon Pictures to submit their claim and evidence of debt. Cannon Pictures, its library of 135 films, as well as 112 films from the company&#x27;s previous incarnation, 21st Century Film Distribution, officially went up for sale on August 14, 1997 with the auction taking place on September 15. The property was sold to Imperial Entertainment.

In February 1998, a judge ruled that Ovidio G. Assonitis had been wrongfully terminated from the company by Parretti and Pathé. The judge awarded Assonitis $2.9 million in damages, but by this time, Pathé was bankrupt and had been foreclosed on by Credit Lyonnais.

== 2001–2002: New Cannon, Inc. era ==
Despite the protracted death of company in its&#x27; original and reincarnated forms, Golan returned to the filmmaking business in 2001 with New Cannon, Inc. Golan hired Evgeny Afineevsky to act as the company&#x27;s president. Afineevsky would be based in Los Angeles, while Golan would be based in Tel Aviv. &quot;Crime and Punishment&quot;, which was originally shot in 1993 under Golan&#x27;s 21st Century Film Corporation but was not released before 21st Century&#x27;s bankruptcy, was their first offering alongside a slate of new films including &quot;Death Game&quot;, a remake of Fritz Lang&#x27;s &quot;M&quot;, &quot;Kumite&quot; (later made as &quot;Final Combat&quot; but never released) and &quot;Open Heart&quot; (released in 2002 as &quot;Return from India&quot;).

By the 2002 Cannes Film Festival, New Cannon had completed &quot;Death Game&quot; and &quot;Return from India&quot; and announced a new project, &quot;Beauty and the Beast&quot; to be directed by Pharaoh Phillips, alongside sales for previously released films &quot;Train to Hell&quot; and &quot;In Search of A Woman&quot;, an unreleased title from PM Entertainment. The company was taken over by Vision Films later that year; Afineevsky went on to form New Generation Films to produce &quot;Oy Vey! My Son Is Gay!!&quot; from a script by Golan. He went on to make documentaries, &quot;Cries from Syria&quot; and &quot;Winter on Fire: Ukraine&#x27;s Fight for Freedom&quot;, which was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Documentary Feature and the Primetime Emmy Award in the Exceptional Merit in Documentary Filmmaking category.

Golan continued to produce and direct films after New Cannon, including &quot;Children of Wax&quot; with Armand Assante and Udo Kier, &quot;A Dangerous Dance&quot; and &quot;Marriage Agreement&quot;. In 2013, Golan announced sequels to several films he had produced at Cannon in partnership with MGM (successor-in-interest to the original Cannon), including &quot;Allan Quatermain and the Jewel of the East&quot; with Richard Chamberlain and Sharon Stone returning to their roles, &quot;Return of the Delta Force&quot; and &quot;American Ninja Apprentice&quot; with Michael Dudikoff, David Bradley and Steve James&#x27; daughter Debbi, alongside new original projects &quot;The Sniper&quot; with Mickey Rourke and Bruce Willis and &quot;The Golem&quot; with Al Pacino and Nastassja Kinski; however, Golan died before any were produced.

== 2014: Rival documentaries ==
In 2014, there were two documentary films released about Cannon Films. RatPac Entertainment released &quot;Electric Boogaloo: The Wild, Untold Story of Cannon Films&quot;, a documentary about Cannon Films, written and directed by Mark Hartley, and produced by Brett Ratner. That same year, the Israeli documentary &quot;The Go-Go Boys: The Inside Story of Cannon Films&quot; was launched at the 2014 Cannes Film Festival. As is noted at the end of &quot;Electric Boogaloo&quot;, Golan and Globus announced &quot;The Go-Go Boys&quot; shortly after they were approached to appear in &quot;Boogaloo&quot;, yet in true Cannon fashion, their movie beat Hartley&#x27;s to release by 3 months.

== 2016–present: Rebel Way Entertainment ==
In 2015, Globus sold &quot;Globus Max&quot; and returned to Hollywood to launch a new film production company, Rebel Way Entertainment. The company seeks to reconnect young and web-crazy audiences with the traditional theatrical experience. As of February 2023, their only film is &quot;Deported&quot; (2020), directed by Tyler Spindel.

<text>Tathagat Avatar Tulsi (born 9 September 1987) is an Indian physicist who is best known as a child prodigy. He completed high school at the age of 9 years, earned a BSc degree at the age of 11 years, and a MSc degree at the age of 12 years from Patna Science College (Patna University). In August 2009, he got PhD from the Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore at the age of 21 years by submitting a thesis of only 33 pages. In July 2010, he was offered a position as Assistant Professor on contract at IIT Bombay.
He became a permanent employee of IIT Bombay in 2012. His one-year probation at IIT Bombay got confirmed in 2013. He took four year long leave from 2014 to 2017 because of his allergic asthma in the hot and humid climate of Mumbai. His employment was terminated in 2019. In August 2021, his appeal against termination was rejected by then-President Ramnath Kovind.

On 30.09.24, he was selected as an Assistant Professor at Patliputra University by Bihar State University Service Commission. He is also preparing a Review application to get back his job at IIT Bombay as he has cured his allergic asthma now.

==Biography==
He received wide public attention in 2001, when he was shortlisted by the Indian Government&#x27;s Department of Science and Technology (DST) to participate in a Nobel laureates conference in Germany.

Tulsi was admitted by the Indian Institute of Science (IISc), where his PhD thesis was on &quot;Generalizations of the Quantum Search Algorithm&quot;. He co-authored an unpublished research manuscript (&quot;A New Algorithm for Fixed-point Quantum Search&quot;) with Lov Grover, the inventor of a quantum search algorithm that goes by his name.

Tulsi was once cheered on as one of the most gifted Asian youngsters by &quot;TIME&quot; magazine, mentioned as &quot;Superteen&quot; by &quot;Science&quot;, &quot;Physics Prodigy&quot; by &quot;The TIMES&quot;, &quot;Master Mind&quot; by &quot;The WEEK&quot; and listed by &quot;Outlook&quot; as one of the smartest Indian youngsters. Tathagat Avatar Tulsi participated in the Stock Exchange of Visions project of Fabrica, Benetton&#x27;s research centre in 2007. He was invited by Luciano Benetton for a dinner in honor of Al Gore on 14 June 2007 in Milano, Italy. Tathagat&#x27;s story was showcased by National Geographic Channel in the program &quot;My Brilliant Brain&quot;. The episode named &quot;India&#x27;s Geniuses&quot; was aired on 13 December 2007 and was hosted by Bollywood actress Konkona Sen Sharma.

<text>Gianduiotto (; ) is a chocolate originating in the Piedmont region of Italy. &quot;Gianduiotti&quot; are shaped like ingots and individually wrapped in a (usually) gold- or silver-colored foil cover. It is a specialty of Turin, and takes its name from &quot;gianduja&quot;, the preparation of chocolate and hazelnut used for &quot;gianduiotti&quot; and other sweets (including Nutella and &quot;bicerin di gianduiotto&quot;). This preparation itself is named after Gianduja, a mask in &quot;commedia dell&#x27;arte&quot;, a type of Italian theater, that represents the archetypal Piedmontese. Indeed, Gianduja&#x27;s hat inspired the shape of the &quot;gianduiotto&quot;.

&quot;Gianduiotti&quot; are produced from a paste of sugar, cocoa and hazelnut &quot;Tonda Gentile delle Langhe&quot;. The official &quot;birth&quot; of &quot;gianduiotti&quot; was in 1852 in Turin, by Pierre Paul Caffarel and Michele Prochet, the first to completely grind hazelnuts into a paste before adding them to the cocoa and sugar mix.

The idea of mixing hazelnut pieces to &quot;standard&quot; chocolates is said to have arisen during Napoleon&#x27;s reign, when importing cocoa from South America became difficult. With &quot;raw&quot; cocoa&#x27;s high prices, local producers started incorporating bits of roasted hazelnuts (which were locally grown and readily available in Piedmont) to make the final product more affordable.

<doc id="740394" wikidata="Q4073691" url="?curid=740394" title="Airport Expressway (Beijing)">
<text>The Airport Expressway (), officially the S12, is a controlled-access highway in Beijing, China, which links central Beijing to the Beijing Capital International Airport. It is just under 20 km in length.

Opened in 1993, the expressway links Sanyuanqiao on the northeastern 3rd Ring Road to Beijing Airport. Another expressway, the 2nd Airport Expressway, was built in 2008 prior to the Beijing Olympics to serve traffic from the city to the airport.

==Route==
The Airport Expressway runs entirely within the confines of the municipality of Beijing.

Basic Route: Beijing (Sanyuanqiao - Siyuan - Beigao - Xiaotianzu - Beijing Capital International Airport)

==History==
The expressway opened on September 14, 1993, following a year-long construction effort which began on July 2, 1992. Previously, all traffic used the old Airport Road (G101), which was tested to the limit in the early 1990s.

This expressway has slashed driving time to the airport from the previous hour (using the old airport road) to just around 15 minutes. It is convenient and traffic is usually smooth.

===Extension into the 2nd Ring Road===
A 2.5 km stretch of expressway links Sanyuanqiao on the 3rd Ring Road to the area between Dongzhimen and Xiaojieqiao on the 2nd Ring Road. Construction started in 2004; it was finished in 2006.

==Alternate routes==
Further approach routes to the airport were built in the first decade of the 21st century. The Northern Airport Line (机场北线), completed between 2005 and 2006, connected the Jingcheng Expressway with the northern part of the airport, to form a northern approach route. The route commences at Lutong, just over halfway between the 5th Ring Road and the 6th Ring Road, on the Jingcheng Expressway. In 2008, another route, the 2nd Airport Expressway, was built between the eastern 5th Ring Road and the airport in time for the Beijing Olympics. Both routes have significantly alleviated traffic to the airport from the city proper.

==Road conditions==
===Speed limit===
Leftmost lane: minimum 100 km/h, maximum 120 km/h. Other lanes: minimum 60 – 80 km/h, maximum 100 km/h.

===Tolls===
The toll collection on the Airport Expressway has a contentious history. Construction was funded by the government using a bank loan in 1993, and residents began to dispute the rationale for the toll collection several years after the road was completed, doubting that the loan was paid off and that most of the revenue was actually used to pay back the loan. Despite these inquiries and complaints, the local government continued to collect tolls. The toll collection rights were eventually sold to a public corporation, the Capital Development Corporation, and the time of toll collection was lengthened by 30 years. The central government&#x27;s general accounting office investigated and found that in the 14 year period (up to 2005), the total toll revenue was over 3 billion yuan; this was much higher than the original investment amount, 1.2 billion yuan. Under pressure, the local government lowered the toll from 15 to 10 yuan.

CNY 0.5/km as of 5th Ring Road intersection for sections south of the toll gate. Entire stretch from Sanyuanqiao to Beijing Capital International Airport costs CNY 5 (price for small passenger cars). As of June 2011, the Airport Express is free of charge into the city, but retains the CNY 5 fare toward the airport.
Note: For frequent users, a sensor-style Express Transit Card is available.

===Lanes===
6 lanes (3 up, 3 down) uniformly.

===Traffic===
Good during the day. Mild traffic jams during rush hour, mostly in the southern section of the road near Beijing.

==Major exits==
NE 2nd Ring Road, NE 3rd Ring Road, NE 4th Ring Road, Dashanzi, NE 5th Ring Road, Beigao, Xiaotianzu, Beijing Capital International Airport

==Service areas==
None on the expressway. The Weigou exit has a gas station close to it (on the way back to Beijing).

==Connections==
Ring roads of Beijing: Connects with the NE 2nd Ring Road between Dongzhimen and Xiaojieqiao, NE 3rd Ring Road at Sanyuanqiao, the NE 4th Ring Road at Siyuan, and the NE 5th Ring Road at Wuyuan Bridge.

<doc id="740408" wikidata="Q310985" url="?curid=740408" title="Robert Miles">
<text>Roberto Concina (; 3 November 1969 – 9 May 2017), known professionally as Robert Miles, was an Italian record producer, composer, musician and DJ. His 1995 composition &quot;Children&quot; sold more than 5 million copies and topped the charts worldwide.

==Early life==
Robert Miles was born in Fleurier, Switzerland, to Italian parents.

Miles became proficient at playing the piano during his youth in Friuli, Italy, in the small town of Fagagna, where his family moved when he was young, and had been in the music scene since 1984. He worked as a DJ in some Italian clubs and private radio networks, and in 1990 he used his savings to establish his own recording studio and a pirate radio station. Originally performing under the name Robert Milani, he changed his last name to Miles in anticipation of &quot;the musical journey ahead of him&quot;.

==Music career==
===1994–1997: Breakthrough and &quot;Dreamland&quot;===

In 1994, Miles wrote a trance and chill-out piece based on acoustic guitar chords and soft synthesizer effects, &quot;Children&quot;, which was later developed into a dream house song featuring a piano theme on top. The single picked up sales slowly; however, within two weeks of its official release in 1995, it had sold more than 350,000 copies all over Europe and topped the charts in many countries. The single received an unprecedented &quot;Essential Tune of The Week&quot; three weeks in a row on Pete Tong&#x27;s show, causing a furious bidding war. It was then signed to Deconstruction Records in the UK by Giles Goodman of Dynamik Music (who represented Platipus Records the initial UK licensee). After occupying the Euro Top 100 chart number 1 spot for thirteen consecutive weeks by 1997, &quot;Children&quot; had sold more than five million copies worldwide. It earned Miles platinum records in many countries, a Brit Award for International Breakthrough Act 1997 (Miles was the only Italian artist to have received the award until its final award for that category in 2012), a World Music Award as World&#x27;s Best Selling Male Newcomer, and various other awards.

Miles&#x27; next single was &quot;Fable&quot;. Part of this song was used in the theatrical trailer for the U.S. movie &quot;Ever After&quot; starring Drew Barrymore and Dougray Scott. His debut album &quot;Dreamland&quot; was released on 7 June 1996 in Europe, and released in the United States about a month later. The album included a cover of &quot;One and One&quot; featuring British singer Maria Nayler. This cover became very popular (it reached number 1 in the Euro Top 100 Singles Chart during the Christmas period and remained in the top spot for six consecutive weeks) and was later released as a single in Europe and the U.S.

===1997–1998: &quot;23am&quot;===
In November 1997, Miles released another track, &quot;Freedom&quot;, which was one of the key tracks on his second album &quot;23am&quot;, featuring vocals provided by Kathy Sledge of Sister Sledge. Containing a different feel from the previously more club-oriented &quot;Dreamland&quot;, &quot;23am&quot; incorporated more lyrics-driven songs than its predecessor while maintaining Miles&#x27; trademark piano sound from the first album.

===1998–2002: Departure from label and &quot;Organik&quot;===
After splitting from Deconstruction, BMG and his former management in London, he set up his own independent record label Salt Records (stylised as S:alt Records, with S:alt being short for suitably:alternative) in 2001 and released his third album, &quot;Organik&quot;, featuring the new single &quot;Paths&quot; with vocals provided by Nina Miranda of Smoke City. Guests on the album included Trilok Gurtu, Bill Laswell and Nitin Sawhney. Music from &quot;Organik&quot; was used on various movie soundtracks such as &quot;The Bourne Identity&quot;, &quot;Derrida&quot;, and &quot;City of Ghosts&quot;. It was licensed to Narada Productions&#x27; Shakti Records label in the USA. In 2002, an album containing mainly remixes of songs found on &quot;Organik&quot; was released. The album, appropriately entitled &quot;Organik Remixes&quot;, contained remixes by the winners of the remixing contest held on Robert Miles&#x27;s Web site, as well as remixes from well-known artists such as Future Sound of London, Riton, and Alexkid among others. The album also had one new track, &quot;Bhairav&quot;, which featured the vocals of Amelia Cuni.

===2004–2005: &quot;Miles_Gurtu&quot;===
In 2004, Miles released &quot;Miles Gurtu&quot;, his fourth album, which was a collaboration with percussionist Trilok Gurtu and included jazz and electronica elements. Also guesting on the album were Nitin Sawhney, Jon Thorne, Mike Patto and Paul Falloon.

===2011–2012: &quot;Thirteen&quot;===
Miles&#x27; fifth album, entitled &quot;Thirteen,&quot; was released worldwide on Salt Records in February 2011. For this album, Miles produced a blend of alternative and progressive rock with ambient and electronic soundscapes.

In 2012 Miles finished working on the soundtrack for the movie documentary &quot;The Turn of THIS Century&quot;, directed by Peter Beyak and featuring the photography of &quot;Life Magazine&quot;. He founded a new FM and online alternative radio station, &quot;Open Lab&quot;, broadcasting from Ibiza, a project bringing together culture, arts, media, technology and innovation.

==Death==
Miles died from metastatic cancer in Ibiza, Spain, on 9 May 2017 at the age of 47.

Miles’ OpenLab station was taken off-air shortly afterwards, pending discussions on the future of the station. After receiving many messages from people expressing dismay at the station&#x27;s suspension, it was announced that the station would be returning soon in 2019, starting with a live radio stream in January 2019 and followed by a reboot to radio on 106.4 FM in Ibiza in April 2019.

<doc id="740412" wikidata="Q787001" url="?curid=740412" title="Narodnaya Volya">
<text>Narodnaya Volya () was a late 19th-century revolutionary socialist political organization operating in the Russian Empire, which conducted assassinations of government officials in an attempt to overthrow the autocratic Tsarist system. The organization declared itself to be a populist movement that succeeded the Narodniks. Composed primarily of young revolutionary socialist intellectuals believing in the efficacy of direct action, &quot;Narodnaya Volya&quot; emerged in Autumn 1879 from the split of an earlier revolutionary organization called &quot;Zemlya i Volya&quot; (&quot;Land and Liberty&quot;). Similarly to predecessor groups that had already used the term &quot;terror&quot; positively, &quot;Narodnaya Volya&quot; proclaimed themselves as terrorists and venerated dead terrorists as &quot;martyrs&quot; and &quot;heroes&quot;, justifying political violence as a legitimate tactic to provoke a necessary revolution.

Based upon a secret society apparatus of local, semi-independent cells co-ordinated by a self-selecting Executive Committee, &quot;Narodnaya Volya&quot; espoused acts of political violence in an attempt to destabilize the Russian Empire and spur insurrection against Tsarism, justified &quot;as a means of exerting pressure on the government for reform, as the spark that would ignite a vast peasant uprising, and as the inevitable response to the regime&#x27;s use of violence against the revolutionaries&quot;. This culminated in the successful assassination of Tsar Alexander II in March 1881—the event for which the group is best remembered. The group developed ideas—such as the assassination of the &quot;leaders of oppression&quot;—that were to become the hallmark of future small anti-state groups, and were convinced that new technologies such as dynamite enabled them to strike the regime powerfully and precisely, minimising casualties.

Much of the organization&#x27;s philosophy was inspired by Sergey Nechayev and Carlo Pisacane, the proponent of &quot;propaganda by the deed&quot;. The group served as inspiration and forerunner for other revolutionary socialist and anarchist organizations, including in the Russian Socialist Revolutionary Party (PSR). Although they were socialist, they generally opposed Marxism in favour of an ideal of anarchist self-government.

==History==
===The Populist background===

The emancipation of the serfs in 1861 did not suddenly end the state of grim rural poverty in the Russian Empire, and the autocracy headed by the Tsar of Russia and the nobles around him, as well as the privileged state bureaucracy, remained in firm control of the nation&#x27;s economy from which it extracted pecuniary benefits. By the beginning of the 1870s, dissent regarding the established political and economic order had begun to take concrete form among many members of the intelligentsia, which sought to foster a modern and democratic society in Russia in place of the economic backwardness and political repression which marked the old regime.

A set of &quot;populist&quot; values became commonplace among these radical intellectuals seeking change of the Russian economic and political form. The Russian peasantry, based as it was upon its historic village governing structure, the peasant commune (&quot;obshchina&quot; or &quot;mir&quot;), and its collective holding and periodic redistribution of farmland, was held to be inherently socialistic, or at least fundamentally amenable to socialist organization. It was further believed that this fact made possible a unique path for the modernization of Russia which bypassed the industrial poverty that was a feature of early capitalism in Western Europe—the region to which Russian intellectuals looked for inspiration and by which they measured the comparatively backwards state of their own polity.

Moreover, the radical intelligentsia believed it axiomatic that individuals and the nation had the power to control their own destiny and that it was the moral duty of enlightened civil society to transform the nation by leading the peasantry in mass revolt that would ultimately transform Russia to a socialist society.

These ideas were regarded by most radical intellectuals of the era as nearly incontestable, the byproduct of decades of observation and thought dating back to the conservative Slavophiles and sketched out by such disparate writers as Alexander Herzen (1812–1870), Pyotr Lavrov (1823–1900), and Mikhail Bakunin (1814–1876).

Socialist study circles (&quot;kruzhki&quot;) began to emerge in Russia during the decade of the 1870s, populated primarily by idealistic students in major urban centers such as St. Petersburg, Moscow, Kiev, and Odessa. These initially tended to have a loose organizational structure, decentralized and localized, bound together by the personal familiarity of participants with one another. Efforts to propagandize revolutionary and socialist ideas among factory workers and peasants were quickly met with state repression, however, with the Tsarist secret police (&quot;Okhrana&quot;) identifying, arresting, and jailing agitators.

In the spring of 1874 a mass movement of Going to the People began, with young intellectuals taking jobs in rural villages as teachers, clerks, doctors, carpenters, masons, or common farm laborers, attempting to immerse themselves in the peasants&#x27; world so as to better inculcate them with socialist and revolutionary ideas. Fired with messianic zeal, perhaps 2,000 people left for rural posts in the spring; by the fall some 1,600 of these found themselves arrested and jailed, failing to make the slightest headway in fomenting agrarian revolution. The failure of this movement, marked by a rejection of political arguments by the peasantry and easy arrests of public speakers by local authorities and the &quot;Okhrana&quot;, deeply influenced the revolutionary movement in years to follow. The need for stealth and secrecy and more aggressive measures seemed to have been made clear.

===The antecedent organization===

Following the failure of the 1874 effort at &quot;going to the people&quot;, revolutionary populism congealed around what would be the strongest such organization of the decade, &quot;Zemlya i Volya&quot; (&quot;Land and Liberty&quot;), the prototype of a new type of centralized political organization which attempted to muster and direct every potential aspect of urban and rural discontent. The nucleus of this new organization, which borrowed its name from radicals of the preceding decade, was established in St. Petersburg late in 1876. As an underground political party marked by extreme secrecy in the face of secret police repression, few primary records originating from the group documenting its existence have survived.

&quot;Zemlya i Volya&quot; is associated in particular with the names of M.A. Natanson (1851–1919), a committed activist from the first half of the decade who both founded the organization and provided it with institutional memory, and Alexander Mikhailov (1855–1884), the leading representative of a new wave of participants and memoirist of the movement. This vanguard party, composed almost exclusively of intellectuals, continued in the tradition of idealizing traditional peasant organization as a pathway to broader social transformation. As Alexander Mikhailov wrote:

The &quot;rebels&quot; idealize the people. They hope that in the very first moments of freedom political forms will appear which correspond to their own conceptions based on the &quot;obshchina&quot; and on federation... The party&#x27;s task is to widen the sphere of action of self-administration to all internal problems.

An extensive program was drawn up in St. Petersburg in 1876 calling for the break up of the nations of the Russian Empire, granting of all land to the &quot;agricultural working class&quot;, and transfer of all social functions to the village communes. This program warned &quot;Our demands can be brought about only by means of violent revolution&quot;, and it prescribed &quot;agitation...both by word and above all by deed—aimed at organizing the revolutionary forces and developing revolutionary feelings&quot; as the vehicle for &quot;disorganization of the state&quot; and victory.

These ideas were borrowed directly from Mikhail Bakunin, a radicalized émigré nobleman from Tver guberniia regarded as the father of collectivist anarchism. In practice, however, a significant percentage of &quot;Zemlya i Volya&quot; members (so-called &quot;Zemlevoltsy&quot;), returned to the model of the study circle and concentrated their efforts upon the industrial workers of urban centers. Among these were the young Georgi Plekhanov (1856–1918), an individual later celebrated as the father of Russian Marxism.

Whatever the practical activities of its local groups, the official position of the &quot;Zemlya i Volya&quot; organization endorsed the tactic of violent direct action, which the lead article in the first issue of the party&#x27;s newspaper characterized as a &quot;system of mob law and self-defense&quot; put into action by a &quot;protective detachment&quot; of the liberation movement. The group also rationalized political assassination as &quot;capital punishment&quot; and &quot;self-defense&quot; for &quot;crimes&quot; against the nation. The organization began to look at regicide as the highest manifestation of political action, culminating in a December 1879 assassination attempt on Tsar Alexander II by the &quot;Zemlevolets&quot; A. K. Soloviev (1846–1879).

Accelerated state repression of &quot;Zemlya i Volya&quot; followed the hanging of attempted assassin Soloviev, with arrests nearly wiping out revolutionary cells in the west of the Russian Empire and putting severe pressure on the organization elsewhere. The tension over the use of violence led to a division of the organization, with proto-Marxists who favored an end to the use of violent direct action to gain control over the official newspaper while the activist wing controlled a majority of the Executive Committee. Efforts to reconcile the two wings were unsuccessful and a split was formalized on 15 August 1879, by a commission appointed to divide the organization&#x27;s assets.

During the latter part of 1879, those favoring study circles and propaganda to build a revolutionary movement from the ground up, exemplified by Plekhanov and his co-thinkers, launched independent activity as a new organization called &quot;Chërnyi Peredel&quot; ( Чёрный передел, &quot;Black Repartition&quot;). The unrepentantly violent wing re-established itself as well, this time under a new banner—&quot;Narodnaya Volya&quot; (&quot;People&#x27;s Freedom&quot;, frequently albeit imprecisely rendered into English as &quot;People&#x27;s Will&quot;).

===Establishment===
During the first months after its formation, &quot;Narodnaya Volya&quot; founded or co-opted workers study circles in the major cities of St. Petersburg, Moscow, Odessa, Kiev, and Kharkov. The group also established cells within the military, among the army garrison at St. Petersburg and the Kronstadt naval base. The organization established a party press and issued illegal newspapers in support of its efforts—five issues of the eponymous &quot;Narodnaya Volya&quot; and two issues of a newspaper targeted to industrial workers, &quot;Rabochaia Gazeta&quot; (The Workers&#x27; Newspaper). A series of illegal leaflets were produced, putting party proclamations and manifestos in the hands of potential supporters.

&quot;Narodnaya Volya&quot; saw themselves as continuers of the populist tradition of earlier years rather than marking a fresh break from the past, declaring in their press that while they would not keep the title &quot;Zemlevoltsy&quot; since they no longer represented the earlier party&#x27;s entire tradition, they nevertheless intended to continue the principles established by the &quot;Zemlya i Volya&quot; organization and to continue to make &quot;Land and Liberty&quot; their &quot;motto&quot; and &quot;slogan&quot;.

The organization promulgated a program which called for &quot;complete freedom of conscience, speech, press, assembly, association, and electoral agitation&quot;. The group made the establishment of political freedom its top public objective, with the radical publicist N.K. Mikhailovsky (1842–1904) contributing two finely crafted &quot;political letters&quot; on the topic to two early issues of the party&#x27;s official organ. The party declared its intention to lay down arms as soon as political concessions were made. There were no dreams of the organization forming the basis of a ruling party, with a fundamental hope maintained in the emergence of the self-governing village commune as the basis of a new socialist society.

The &quot;Narodnaya Volya&quot; organization also began a violent revolutionary campaign, with the governing Executive Committee issuing a proclamation calling for the execution of Tsar Alexander II for his crimes against the Russian people. While giving lip service to the demand for political freedom and a constitutional republic as its objective, the so-called &quot;Narodnovoltsy&quot; seem to have actually believed themselves to be pursuing a maximalist program in which violence and political assassination would &quot;break the government itself&quot; and end all vestiges of the Tsarist regime in Russia. The government was seen as weak and tottering, and chances for its revolutionary overthrow promising.

===Organizational structure===
&quot;Narodnaya Volya&quot; continued the trend towards secret organization and centralized direction that had begun with &quot;Zemlya i Volya&quot;—principles held to tightly in the face of growing government repression of participants in the organization. Democratic control of the party apparatus was deemed impossible under existing political conditions and the organization was centrally directed by its self-selecting Executive Committee, which included, among others Alexander Mikhailov, Andrei Zhelyabov (1851–1881), Sophia Perovskaya (1853–1881), Vera Figner (1852–1942), Nikolai Morozov (1854–1946), Mikhail Frolenko (1848–1938), Aaron Zundelevich (1852–1923), Savely Zlatopolsky (1855–1885) and Lev Tikhomirov (1852–1923).

The Executive Committee was in existence for six years, during which time it was populated by less than 50 people, including in its ranks both men and women. The official membership of the &quot;Narodnaya Volya&quot; organization during its existence has been estimated at 500, bolstered by an additional number of informal followers. A document listing the movement&#x27;s participants, including those from the period from 1886 to 1896 when only a small skeleton organization remained, totals 2,200.

===Assassination of Tsar Alexander II===

The assassination of Tsar Alexander II on marked the high-water mark of &quot;Narodnaya Volya&quot; as a factor in Russian politics. While the assassination did not end the Tsarist regime, the government ran scared in the aftermath of the bomb that killed him, with the formal coronation ceremony of Tsar Alexander III postponed for more than two years due to security concerns.

The Tsar had been formally sentenced to death by the Executive Committee of &quot;Narodnaya Volya&quot; on 25 August 1879, on the heels of the execution of former &quot;Zemlevolets&quot; Solomon Wittenberg, who had attempted to build a mine to sink a ship carrying the Tsar into Odessa harbor the previous year. An initial plan called for the use of dynamite to destroy a train carrying the Tsar, which ended with an explosion that destroyed a freight car and led to a derailment. A February 1880 attempt used a quantity of dynamite to attempt to blow up the Tsar in a palace dining room. The resulting explosion killed 11 guards and soldiers and wounded 56, but missed the Tsar, who was not in the dining hall as expected.

A state of siege followed, during which the demoralized Tsar avoided public appearances amidst sensational rumors in the press of additional attacks in the offing. One French diplomat likened the Tsar to a ghost—&quot;pitiful, aged, played out, and choked by a fit of asthmatic coughing at every word&quot;. In response to the security crisis the Tsar established a new Supreme Commission for the Maintenance of State Order and Public Peace, under the command of Mikhail Loris-Melikov, a hero of the Russo-Turkish War. Just over a week later, a &quot;Narodnovolets&quot; attempted to assassinate Loris-Melikov with a handgun, firing a shot but missing, only to be hanged two days later. Repression was ratcheted upwards, with two &quot;Narodnaya Volya&quot; activists executed in Kiev the following month for the crime of distributing revolutionary leaflets.

<text>Narodnaja Volya (Belarusian and Russian: ; ; English: &quot;The People&#x27;s Will&quot;) is an independent opposition newspaper founded by .

Since its launch, it was opposed to the Alexander Lukashenko regime and served as a tribune for critics of the government. For that reason, &quot;Narodnaja Volya&quot; was always harassed by authorities, survived several closures and numerous huge fines. The journalists received death threats, were arrested and questioned by the police and KGB.

Through the years such prominent persons as oppositionist Andrei Sannikov, journalists , and Alyaksandr Feduta, writer Semen Bukchin, professor Vyacheslav Orgish, oppositionist Anatol Labiedzka, and future advisor to the President of Ukraine Mykhailo Podolyak were among &quot;Narodnaja Volya&#x27;s&quot; authors.

== Establishment and early years ==
On March 17, 1995, Belarusian president Alexander Lukashenko fired Iosif Siaredzich from his post of the editor-in-chief at &quot;Narodnaja Gazeta&quot;. However, according to the state&#x27;s law, only the Parliament could reappoint chief editors. After the dismissal, Siaredzich launched his independent newspaper and called it &quot;Narodnaja Volya&quot;.

The first issue of &quot;Narodnaja Volya&quot; was published on July 11, 1995. The publication had to use print shops in Vilnius, Lithuania, from December 1995 to early 1998. The pressure from the International community forced Belarusian authorities to allow printing within the country. By November 1997, its circulation was 55,000. The printing was moved to Minsk, Belarus in the private publishing house &quot;Magic&quot;. It became the largest independent newspaper in Belarus. Siaredzich served as the editor-in-chief, and the deputy chief editor was Ivan Makalovich.

==2000s==

=== Lawsuits and fines ===

By 2001 &quot;Narodnaja Volya&quot; circulation reached 50,000. In August 2001 the authorities halted publication of the regular issue. On June 18, 2002, a Belarus district court froze &quot;Narodnaya Volya&quot; bank account because of defamation charges brought by two judges from Zhodzina. The judges sought in damages.

On November 17, 2003, the Minsk City Court on 17 ordered &quot;Narodnaya Volya&quot; to pay (approx. US$23,000) in damages for libel against Yahor Rybakou, the chairman of the Belarusian State Television and Radio Company (BDT). The Court also ordered &quot;Narodnaya Volya&quot; journalist Maryna Koktysh and former television host Eleanora Yazerskaya to pay each to Rybakou. After an appeal, the fines for the journalists were reduced to , but the fine for the newspaper wasn&#x27;t changed. On June 11, 2004, more than 400 people gathered on the October Square in Minsk to show their support to &quot;Narodnaya Volya&quot;.

In 2005 the court ordered the newspaper to pay (approx. US$46,500) to head of the Liberal Democratiс Party Sergei Gaidukevich. Gaidukevich sued after an article on his alleged links to Saddam Hussein and receiving $1 mln from the Iraqis dictator.

In 2007 Leninsky District Court ordered &quot;Narodnaya Volya&quot; to pay a fine of to the chief of the Main Ideological Administration of the President of Belarus Oleg Proleskovsky, reporter Marina Koktysh was personally fined .

Meanwhile, only in 2011 more than three times the newspaper claims were rejected by Belarusian courts.

=== Crackdown ===

In 2004 International Press Freedom Award laureate Svetlana Kalinkina accepted an editorial position at &quot;Narodnaja Volya&quot;. In 2004 Iosif Siaredzich wrote letters to Minsk court in protection of Leonid Svetik, a high school teacher and political activist, who was prosecuted by authorities for criticizing the government.

In 2005 the weekly circulation was around 150,000 copies. On September 20, 2005, without any notification, bailiffs entered the editors office and distrained all its property, &quot;Narodnaya Volya&#x27;s&quot; bank account was arrested. The pressure from the Information Ministry prevented Belarusian printers from working with the paper. On October 1, 2005, Belsouzpechat and Krasnaya Zvezda printing house cancelled unilaterally the agreements with &quot;Narodnaja Volya&quot;. Almost 20 more publications were banned in the same way. &quot;Narodnaja Volya&quot; could no longer be distributed via newsstands or subscription. The editors office was forced to use the loophole in state law and print in Russian Smolensk. Border forces arrested three print runs and advised the editors office not to bring any more copies until the presidential election is over. OSCE representative said that the closure made the country lose two-thirds of its independent press, BAJ called it lawless. The Union of Right Forces Russian political party offered the newspaper to finance its work. Many years later Siaredzich recalled that the situation with printing and distribution was so desperate, that he even signed an agreement with some Lithuanian aeronautic company in to deliver &quot;Narodnaja Volya&quot; print runs across the state border from foreign print shops by aerostats. Meanwhile, in May 2007 at a press conference Lukashenko refused to acknowledge any oppression against authorities upon opposition and non-governmental media.

On October 19, 2005, &quot;Narodnaja Volya&quot; freelance journalist Vasiliy Grodnikov was found dead with a head wound. Retiree Grodnikov wrote articles on the most actual topics from Belarusian life.

Beginning on 1 January 2006, the Belarusian post office refused to distribute the paper, and an entire print run of 30,000 copies was confiscated by police on 9 January. When citizens of Salihorsk began a petition on the paper&#x27;s behalf, police made visits to the homes of the signatories to interrogate them.

In March 2006 in Minsk several thousand copies of the newspaper were confiscated by the police. On 13 March 2006, a week before the presidential election that would usher in Lukashenko&#x27;s third term, &quot;Narodnaja Volya&quot;, &quot;BDG&quot;, and &quot;Tovarishch&quot; had their print runs abruptly cancelled by their Smolensk supplier. Kalinkina told &quot;The New York Times&quot; that she believed Belarusian government pressure to be responsible, saying, &quot;When, a week before the election, someone refuses to print three papers, it is clear there are political reasons.&quot; In the same week the publication was shut down.

Since November 2005 the runs dropped from 70 to 15 thousand. In Autumn 2006 the web site was launched. In December 2008 the newspaper was allowed to be sold through subscription and state newsstands. The circulation boosted from 9 to 19 thousand in a few days.

On December 11, 2009, a bomb threat call was made to the editors office, causing an evacuation of the staff. During the evacuation chief editor Svetlana Kalinkina&#x27;s office had been broken into.

== 2010s==
The presidential election 2010 in Belarus was scheduled on December, 19. The election period was marked with severe oppression of press and independent media. In April 2010, computers were seized from Kalinkina and Koktysh, as well as &quot;Charter 97&quot; editor Natalya Radina and &quot;Novaya Gazeta&quot; journalist Irina Khalip as part of an investigation into a slander case filed by Ivan Korzh. The four were also brought to a police station for questioning. In September, Kalinkina wrote an article investigating the recent suspicious death of &quot;Charter 97&quot; editor-in-chief Aleh Byabenin, and received several death threats shortly after, prompting the human rights organization Norwegian Helsinki Committee to issue an alert on her behalf.

=== Harassment of press and journalists ===
In 2010 the newspaper received four official warnings from the government.

On April 7, 2010, the picket of veterans took place in front of the editors office. The veterans, supported by unknown sportive-looking young men, protested against the publication of chapters from Ilya Kopil&#x27;s book on the Second World War, accusing it for propaganda of fascism and falsification of history. The book described how some German soldiers showed mercy to the Belarusian civilians during the war, while some of Belarusian partisans were former hardened criminals and kept the local villagers in fear. Svetlana Kalinkina met with the protesters and offered them to publish their opinions in the next issue of &quot;Narodnaya Volya&quot;. Government-owned TV channels covered the picket as &#x27;people outrage against detractors from the opposition&#x27;. The second picket took place on 14 April, initiated by Minsk State Youth Union. Kalinkina came to the protesters again and explained the value of uncensored war memoirs and its historical significance.

On February 17, 2011, deputy editor Marina Koktysh was questioned by the police, the editors office was searched. On February 26, Kalinkina&#x27;s apartment was searched by the police, her computer was seized. The attention from authorities was allegedly linked to the recent investigation of high ranking KGB officials, published by &quot;Narodnaja Volya&quot;. Kalinkina and Natalya Radina had their calls and e-mails tapped by law enforcement, they received numerous kill threats.

On 29 April 2011, the Information Ministry again attempted to shut down &quot;Narodnaja Volya&quot; and another independent newspaper &quot;Nasha Niva&quot;, filing a motion with the Supreme Economic Court of Belarus for the newspaper&#x27;s closure. On May 13, 2011, the preliminary court hearing took place of the Narodnaja Volya case. The official reason to close the newspaper was the distribution of unsound information. On May 12 the similar hearings were held of the case against Nasha Niva. The actual reasons were the reports on anti-government demonstrations after the presidential elections. Due to high international resonance, the Ministry dropped the case but immediately started the new ones on administrative offences. These cases ended with fines of . At a press conference in June 2011, Lukashenko said that &quot;they [Narodnaya Volya and Nasha Niva] had it coming&quot;.

In 2008 Marina Koktysh was refused journalist accreditation to the House of Representatives of the Belarusian parliament. She unsuccessfully sued the government several times. Only in 2014, the UN Human Rights Committee asserted Koktysh&#x27;s rights.

Through the years, she was forcibly removed from a train from Vilnius by Belarusian border control, had her car and computers arrested, phone calls surveilled, called to question in KGB and the General Prosecutors Office. In October 2011 Koktysh suffered from a phone attack - the constant calls from unknown numbers dropped as soon as she answered, so the journalist couldn&#x27;t work or contact her friends or family. At a press conference on December 23, 2011, Koktysh asked Lukashenko if he would sleep better if the accused of treason oppositionist Andrei Sannikov and Mikola Statkevich pleaded for absolution. Belarusian president avoided an answer with a sarcastic comment that one should sleep with him to know the quality of his sleep.

In 2015 at a press conference Lukashenko said to Siaredzich that he knows nothing about any oppression against the newspaper and he would not prosecute it for publishing the opposition views.

=== Temporary liberalization ===

On April 1, 2016, Svetlana Kalinkina resigned from her post of editorial director. According to the mutual agreement with the editor&#x27;s office, she kept cooperating with &quot;Narodnaja Volya&quot; as a journalist. In July of the same year the paper started using bigger fonts to improve readability for the sake of senior readers. On the New Year&#x27;s Eve 2017 Nobel laureate Svetlana Alexievich sponsored a 6-month subscription on &quot;Narodnaja Volya&quot; to 108 regional libraries in Belarus.

In 2017 Iosif Siaredzich was invited for a private meeting with Alexander Lukashenko, where the president reassured that no oppression on independent and opposition press would be done. Lukashenko said that his blood boiled when he read &#x27;false news and reports&#x27; in &quot;Narodnaja Volya&quot;, but still, he promised to return 8 publications in state subscription catalogues.

In December 2018 the newspaper launched a crowdfunding campaign to subscribe all rural, district and regional libraries to &quot;Narodnaja Volya&quot;. The initiative aimed to give access to the publication to people with low income, who couldn&#x27;t afford to buy the newspaper.

=== Further pressure ===

On August 25, 2020, the Belarusian Press House refused to print the latest issue of Narodnaja Volya, as if due to a breakdown of the printing press. Within the same timeframe and for the same reason, three issues of Komsomolskaya Pravda in Belarus and one for BelGazeta and Svobodnye Novosti Plus each were not published – all four newspapers covered the 2020–21 Belarusian protests.

In August 2021 Siaredzich was refused accreditation to the annual &#x27;Big Talk&#x27; press-conference with Alexander Lukashenko.

<doc id="740416" wikidata="Q234689" url="?curid=740416" title="Saint Monica">
<text>Monica ( – 387) was an early North African Christian saint and the mother of Augustine of Hippo. She is remembered and honored in the Catholic and Orthodox Churches, albeit on different feast days, for her outstanding Christian virtues, particularly the suffering caused by her husband&#x27;s adultery, and her prayerful life dedicated to the reformation of her son, who wrote extensively of her pious acts and life with her in his &quot;Confessions&quot;. Popular Christian legends recall Monica weeping every night for her son Augustine.

==Life==
Monica is most likely to have been born in Thagaste (present-day Souk Ahras, Algeria). She is believed to have been a Berber on the basis of her name. She was married early in life to Patricius, a decurion pagan, in Thagaste. Patricius reportedly had a violent temper and appears to have been of dissolute habits; apparently his mother exhibited similar behaviours. Monica&#x27;s almsgiving, deeds and prayer habits annoyed Patricius, but it is said that he always held her in respect.

Monica had three children who survived infancy: two sons, Augustine and Navigius, and a daughter, &#x27;Perpetua&#x27; of Hippo. Unable to secure baptism for them, she grieved heavily when Augustine fell ill. In her distress she asked Patricius to allow Augustine to be baptized; he agreed, then withdrew this consent when the boy recovered.

But Monica&#x27;s relief at Augustine&#x27;s recovery turned to anxiety as he misspent his renewed life being wayward and, as he himself says, lazy. He was finally sent to school at Madauros. He was 17 and studying rhetoric in Carthage when Patricius died.

Augustine had become a Manichaean at Carthage. When, upon his return home, he shared his views regarding Manichaeism, Monica drove him away from her table. However, she is said to have experienced a vision that convinced her to reconcile with him.
At this time she visited a certain (unnamed) bishop who consoled her with the words, &quot;the child of those tears shall never perish.&quot; Monica followed her wayward son to Rome, where he had gone secretly; when she arrived he had already gone to Milan, but she followed him again. Here she found Ambrose and through him she ultimately saw Augustine convert to Christianity after 17 years of resistance.

In his book &quot;Confessions&quot;, Augustine wrote of a peculiar practice of his mother in which she &quot;brought to certain oratories, erected in the memory of the saints, offerings of porridge, bread, water and wine.&quot; When she moved to Milan, the bishop Ambrose forbade her to use the offering of wine, since &quot;it might be an occasion of gluttony for those who were already given to drink&quot;. So, Augustine wrote of her: 

Monica and her son spent six peaceful months at &quot;Rus Cassiciacum&quot; (present-day Cassago Brianza) after which Augustine was baptized by Ambrose in the church of St John the Baptist at Milan. Monica and Augustine left for Africa and they set out on their journey, stopping at Civitavecchia and at Ostia. Here Monica died, and Augustine&#x27;s grief inspired his &quot;Confessions&quot;.

==Veneration==

Monica was buried at Ostia and at first seems to have been almost forgotten, though her body was removed during the 6th century to a hidden crypt in the church of Santa Aurea in Ostia. Monica was buried near the tomb of Aurea of Ostia. Her tomb was later transferred to the Basilica of Sant&#x27;Agostino, Rome.

Anicius Auchenius Bassus wrote Monica&#x27;s funerary epitaph, which survived in ancient manuscripts. The actual stone on which it was written was rediscovered in the summer of 1945 in the church of Santa Aurea. The fragment was discovered after two boys were digging a hole to plant a football post in the courtyard beside Santa Aurea.

A translation from Latin by Douglas Boin reads:

During the 13th century, however, the cult of Saint Monica began to spread and a feast in her honour was kept on 4 May. In 1430, Pope Martin V ordered that the relics be brought to Rome. Many miracles are said to have occurred on the way, and the cultus of Saint Monica was definitely established. Later the archbishop of Rouen, Guillaume d&#x27;Estouteville, built a church at Rome in honour of Augustine, the Basilica di Sant&#x27;Agostino, and deposited the relics of Saint Monica in a chapel to the left of the high altar. The Office of St. Monica, however, does not seem to have found a place in the Roman Breviary before the 16th century.

In 1934, in the Dutch city of Utrecht, the order of the &#x27;Zusters Augustinessen van Sint-Monica&#x27; was founded, doing social work, offering a shelter for women with unwanted pregnancies or women who were the victims of domestic violence or abuse. The sisters also started a number of primary schools. In their heyday the order had six convents, in Amsterdam, Utrecht, Sittard, Maastricht, Hilversum and Arnouville on the outskirts of Paris. Since the Hilversum convent, City of God, was closed in 2014, only Utrecht remains as a rest home for the elderly among the sisters, and Casella, a woodland retreat near Hilversum, where young people are still welcome for a meditative sojourn. 

The city of Santa Monica, California, is named after Monica. A legend states that in the 18th century Father Juan Crespí named a local dripping spring &quot;Las Lágrimas de Santa Mónica&quot; (&quot;Saint Monica’s Tears&quot;; today known as the Serra Springs) that was reminiscent of the tears that Monica shed over her son&#x27;s early impiety. As recorded in his diary, however, Crespí actually named the place &quot;San Gregorio&quot;. What is known for certain is that by the 1820s, the name Santa Monica was in use and its first official mention occurred in 1827 in the form of a grazing permit. There is a statue of this saint in Santa Monica&#x27;s Palisades Park by sculptor Eugene Morahan; it was completed in 1934.

Monica is honored in the Church of England and in the Episcopal Church on 4 May.

==In popular culture==
Patricia McGerr fictionalized her life in the 1964 novel &quot;My Brothers, Remember Monica: A Novel of the Mother of Augustine&quot;.

In the 2010 film &quot;Restless Heart: The Confessions of Saint Augustine&quot;, Saint Monica is portrayed by Italian actress Monica Guerritore.

In the oratorio &quot;La conversione di Sant&#x27;Agostino&quot; (1750) composed by Johann Adolph Hasse (libretto by Duchess Maria Antonia of Bavaria), Monica&#x27;s role in the conversion of her son Augustine is dramatized.

In his poem &quot;Confessional&quot;, Frank Bidart compares the relationship between Monica and her son Augustine to the relationship between the poem&#x27;s speaker and his mother.

In “The Angel of Warning,” the fifth episode of season 3 of the TV series &quot;Evil&quot;, David claims Monica was black, although traditionally portrayed as white in religious art. She is actually believed to have been Berber. In the tenth episode of season 3, he calls on St. Monica while jogging past a demonic apparition of sexual temptation in the guise of his colleague Kristen. He continues to pray for deliverance from temptation and is visited by St. Monica.

Other Branches were opened in other major U.S. cities, early on including a Toronto, Canada location.
The college changed its name in 1999 and 2000 to reflect expanded design and technology programs.

In June 2007, CEC announced that the Pittsburgh, Pa and Fairmont, WV campus of IADT would close in 2008. Later, on 11 December 2007, it was announced that IADT Toronto would close in March 2009.

The Toronto location had grown very large from it’s small beginnings in the mid-1980s, and included programs in Fashion Design, Interior Design, and by the mid-1990s programs in video editing, 3D Animation and design, and later Film production. IADT Toronto owners petitioned the provincial Ontario Ministry of Education and Training to allow it provide university degrees for its programs like that provided to similar branches and other companies similar to IADT in the United States. This was rejected by the Ontario Government as post secondary education, especially university level education is highly guarded by provincial governments in Canada. The owners quickly sold off the IADT Toronto programs to RCC Institute of Technology by the end of 2008. It was rebranded as The Academy of Design, using similar graphic branding.

In April 2010, CEC faced a large civil suit from previous students from IADT Pittsburgh, IADT WV, and IADT Toronto citing registration fraud, improper credit transfers, and false pretense. The previous students won the civil suit with an undisclosed amount offered.

In 2011, CEC settled a class action lawsuit claiming violations of the Telephone Consumer Protection Act. IADT had sent out approximately 100,000 unsolicited text message advertisements in 2008. A $20 million settlement fund was established.

In 2014, CEC announced that it would merge IADT all its other educational divisions under the Sanford-Brown name. The merged institution closed in 2015.

==Academics==
IADT was accredited by the Accrediting Council for Independent Colleges and Schools (ACICS).

<text>Charles Samuel Keene (10 August 1823 – 4 January 1891) was an English artist and illustrator, who worked in black and white.

==Early life==

The son of Samuel Browne Keene, a solicitor, he was born at Hornsey. Educated at the Ipswich School until his sixteenth year, he early showed artistic leanings. Two years after the death of his father he was articled to a London solicitor, but, the occupation proving uncongenial, he was removed to the office of an architect, Mr Pukington. His spare time was now spent in drawing historical and nautical subjects in watercolor. For these trifles his mother, to whose energy and common sense he was greatly indebted, soon found a purchaser, through whom he was brought to the notice of the Whympers, the wood-engravers. This led to his being bound to them as apprentice for five years.

His earliest known design is the frontispiece, signed Chas. Keene, to &quot;The Adventures of Dick Boldhero in Search of his Uncle, &amp;c.&quot; (Darton &amp; Co., 1842). His term of apprenticeship over, he hired as studio an attic in the block of buildings standing, up to 1900, between the Strand and Holywell Street, and was soon hard at work for the &quot;Illustrated London News&quot;. At this time he was a member of the Artists Society in Clipstone Street, afterwards removed to the Langham studios.

==Rise==

In December 1851 he made his first appearance in &quot;Punch&quot; and, after nine years of steady work, was called to a seat at the famous table. It was during this period of probation that he first gave evidence of those transcendent qualities which make his work at once the joy and despair of his brother craftsmen. On the starting of &quot;Once a Week&quot;, in 1859, Keene&#x27;s services were requisitioned, his most notable series in this periodical being the illustrations to &quot;Charles Reade&#x27;s A Good Fight&quot; (afterwards rechristened &quot;The Cloister and the Hearth&quot;) and to George Meredith&#x27;s &quot;Evan Harrington&quot;. There is a quality of conventionality in the earlier of these which completely disappears in the later.

In 1858, Keene, who was endowed with a fine voice and was an enthusiastic admirer of old-fashioned music, joined the Jermyn Band, afterwards better known as the Moray Minstrels. He was also for many years a member of Leslie&#x27;s Choir, the Sacred Harmonic Society, the Catch, Glee and Canon Club, and the Bach Choir. He was also an industrious performer on the bagpipes, of which instrument he brought together a considerable collection of specimens.

About 1863 the Arts Club in Hanover Square was started, with Keene as one of the original members. In 1864 John Leech died, and Keene&#x27;s work in &quot;Punch&quot; thenceforward found wider opportunities. It was about this time that the greatest of all modern artists of his class, Menzel, discovered Keene&#x27;s existence, and became a subscriber to &quot;Punch&quot; solely for the sake of enjoying week by week the work of his brother craftsman. In 1872, Keene, who, though fully possessed of the humorous sense, was not within measurable distance of Leech as a jester, and whose drawings were consequently not sufficiently funny to appeal to the laughter-loving public, was fortunate enough to make the acquaintance of Joseph Crawhall, who had been in the habit for many years of jotting down any humorous incidents he might hear of or observe, illustrating them at leisure for his own amusement. These were placed unreservedly at Keene&#x27;s disposal, and to their inspiration we owe at least 250 of his most successful drawings in the last twenty years of his connection with &quot;Punch&quot;. A list of more than 200 of these subjects is given at the end of &quot;The Life and Letters of Charles Keene&quot;.

==Later years==
In 1879 Keene switched residence to 239 Kings Road, Chelsea, which he occupied until his death walking daily to and from his house, 112 Hammersmith Road. In 1881 a volume of his &quot;Punch&quot; drawings was published by Messrs Bradbury &amp; Agnew, with the title &quot;Our People&quot;. In 1883, Keene, who had previously been a strong man, developed symptoms of dyspepsia and rheumatism. By 1889 these had increased to an alarming degree, and he courageously for the last two years of his life bore the pain from his illness. He died unmarried, after a singularly uneventful life, and his body lies in Hammersmith cemetery.

==Critical overview==

According to Layard in the &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica&quot; Eleventh Edition, &quot;Keene, who never had any regular art training, was essentially an artist&#x27;s artist. He held the foremost place amongst English craftsmen in black and white, though his work has never been appreciated at its real value by the general public. No doubt the main reason for this lack of public recognition was his unconventionality. He drew his models exactly as he saw them, not as he knew the world wanted to see them. He found enough beauty and romance in all that was around him, and, in his &quot;Punch&quot; work, enough subtle humour in nature seized at her most humorous moments to satisfy him. He never required his models to grin through a horse collar, as James Gillray did, or to put on their company manners, as was George du Maurier&#x27;s wont. But Keene was not only a brilliant worker in pen and ink. As an etcher he has also to be reckoned with, notwithstanding the fact that his plates numbered not more than fifty at the outside. Impressions of them are exceedingly rare, and hardly half a dozen of the plates were known to be in existence [as of 1911]. He himself regarded them only as experiments in a difficult but fascinating medium. But in the opinion of the expert they suffice to place him among the best etchers of the 19th century. Apart from the etched frontispieces to some of the &quot;Punch&quot; pocket-books, only three, and these by no means the best, have been published. Writing in &quot;L&#x27;Artiste&quot; of a few which he had seen, Félix Bracquemond said: &#x27;By the freedom, the largeness of their drawing and execution, these plates must be classed amongst modern etchings of the first rank.&#x27; A few impressions are in the British Museum, but in the main they were given away to friends and lie hidden in the albums of the collector.&quot;

The painter Walter Sickert cites Keene often in his book &quot;A Free House! or the Artist as Craftsman&quot; edited by Osbert Sitwell. Sickert describes the drawings of Keene as having an authenticity about them because he draws from life as a direct observer and avoids the usual cliches that were common in his day. Sickert urges the use of &quot;sight size&quot; drawing from life, by which he means to draw a 6-foot man from 8 feet away so the size of the figure can be seen as a whole and brought to the page as if one was drawing on a pane of glass while looking at the subject. &quot;And so, from the incised designs on bones scratched by primeval man, to the drawings of Charles Keene, has line been the language of design... Line supposes an unbroken thought, a sentence said in a breath. Line supposes that the hand is not taken off the paper.&quot;

<text>Reblochon () is a soft washed-rind and smear-ripened French cheese made in the Alpine region of Haute-Savoie from raw cow&#x27;s milk. It has its own AOC designation.

Reblochon was first produced in the Thônes and Arly valleys, in the Aravis massif. Thônes remains the centre of Reblochon production; the cheeses are still made in the local cooperatives. Until 1964 Reblochon was also produced in Italian areas of the Alps. Subsequently, the Italian cheese has been sold in declining quantities under such names as Rebruchon and Reblò alpino.

== History ==
Reblochon derives from the word &quot;reblocher&quot; which when literally translated means &quot;to pinch a cow&#x27;s udder again&quot;. This refers to the practice of holding back some of the milk from the first milking. During the 14th century, the landowners would tax the mountain farmers according to the amount of milk their herds produced. The farmers would therefore not fully milk the cows until after the landowner had measured the yield. The milk that remains is much richer, and was traditionally used by the dairymaids to make their own cheese.

In the 16th century the cheese also became known as &quot;fromage de dévotion&quot; &quot;(devotional cheese)&quot; because it was offered to the Carthusian monks of the Thônes Valley by the farmers, in return for having their homesteads blessed.

=== U.S. unavailability ===

Reblochon has not been available in the United States since 2004, as it is unpasteurised and has not been sufficiently aged to pass U.S. import laws concerning the pasteurization of soft and semi-soft cheese. Delice du Jura, a pasteurized soft ripened cheese, is being marketed as a close relative and a good substitute in the United States. Préféré de nos Montagnes and Raclette can also be used as substitutes.

== Characteristics ==

Reblochon is a soft washed-rind and smear-ripened cheese traditionally made from raw cow&#x27;s milk. The cow breeds best for producing the milk needed for this cheese are the Abondance, Tarentaise and the Montbéliarde. This cheese measures across and thick, has a soft centre with a washed rind and weighs an average of .

<text>Mhow, officially Dr. Ambedkar Nagar, is a town in the Indore district in Madhya Pradesh state of India. It is located south-west of Indore city, towards Mumbai on the old Mumbai-Agra Road. In 2003, the Government of Madhya Pradesh renamed the town &quot;Dr. Ambedkar Nagar&quot;, after political reformer and town native B. R. Ambedkar.

==Etymology==
Some articles in popular literature state that &#x27;MHOW&#x27; stands for Military Headquarters Of Warfare. However, this is a backronym, and there is no proof to support the theory that the name of the village comes from the acronym.

==History==
This cantonment town was founded in 1818 by John Malcolm as a result of the Treaty of Mandsaur between the English and the Holkars who were the Maratha Maharajas of Indore. John Malcolm&#x27;s forces had defeated the Holkars of the Maratha Confederacy at the Battle of Mahidpur on 21 December 1817. It was after this battle that the capital of the Holkars moved from the town of Maheshwar on the banks of the Narmada to Indore.

Mhow used to be the headquarters of the 5th (Mhow) Division of the Southern Command during the British Raj. Today this small town is associated with the Indian Army and with B. R. Ambedkar who was born there.

Mhow was a meter gauge railway district headquarters during the British Raj and after 1947. Mhow now has a broad gauge connection with Indore but regular train services are yet to commence.

According to Hindu religious texts, Janapav Kuti near Mhow is said to be the birthplace of Parashurama, an avatar of Vishnu.

== Climate ==
Temperatures may go as high as 43 degrees Celsius during summers and as low as 4 degrees Celsius during winter. 

==Demographics==
 India census, Mhow had a population of 85,023. Males constitute 54% of the population and females 46%. Mhow has an average literacy rate of 72%, higher than the national average of 59.5%; male literacy is 78%, and female literacy is 65%. The Mhow Cantt Cantonment Board has population of 81,702 of which 43,888 are males while 37,814 are females as per report released by Census India 2011.

Population of Children with age of 0-6 is 9308 which is 11.39% of total population of Mhow Cantt (CB). In Mhow Cantt Cantonment Board, Female Sex Ratio is of 862 against state average of 931. Moreover, Child Sex Ratio in Mhow Cantt is around 908 compared to Madhya Pradesh state average of 918. Literacy rate of Mhow Cantt city is 85.78%; higher than state average of 69.32%. In Mhow Cantt, Male literacy is around 90.42% while female literacy rate is 80.37%.

== Cantonment ==

As early as 1818, the Indian Army has had a presence in Mhow. Up until World War II, Mhow was the headquarters of the 5th Division of the Southern Army. According to local legend, Winston Churchill also spent a few months in Mhow when he was a subaltern serving with his regiment in India. The house on the mall where he is supposed to have lived, gradually crumbled due to neglect and age. It was pulled down and a jogger&#x27;s park has been built on its grounds by the Infantry School.

Mhow houses three premier training institutions of the Indian Army; The Infantry School, The Military College of Telecommunication Engineering (MCTE) and The Army War College.

In addition to these institutes, Mhow is where Army Training Command or ARTRAC was born. ARTRAC was based in Mhow from 1991 to 1994, before it shifted to Shimla (Himachal Pradesh). At that time its General Officer Commanding in Chief (GOC-in-C) was Lt. General Shankar Roy Chowdhary who went on to become the Chief of Army Staff (COAS). Its first GOC-in-C was Lt. General A.S. Kalkat who had earlier commanded the Indian Peace Keeping Force (IPKF) in Sri Lanka. ARTRAC functioned from the old 19th century building of the present day Army Public School Mhow. This was used as All Arms Wing of MCTE for many decades. It was originally built and used as the British Military Hospital (BMH). The building is no longer in use and is being preserved as a heritage building. 

===The Infantry School===
The Infantry School is a training establishment of the Indian Army. It is responsible for the training of officers and infantry. The Commando Wing of this school is in Belgaum, Karnataka.

The river Chambal which flows through the dacoit infested areas of northern India is said to begin at the hill of Janapav which is in a village named Kuti, around 15 km from Mhow town. On top of the hill of Janapav is a temple and ashram. According to local legend this used to be the ashram of Jamadagni, the father of Parashurama (an Avatar or reincarnation of Vishnu, the Hindu God of sustenance). A mela, or religious fair, is held at Kuti every year on the auspicious day of Kartik Purnima - the first full moon after Diwali, which is also celebrated as Guru Nanak&#x27;s birthday by the Sikh community - and people from villages far and near come to pray and pay their obeisance. The next day the same mela shifts to the Balaji temple in Badgonda village.

<doc id="740432" wikidata="Q881021" url="?curid=740432" title="Francis Harrison Pierpont">
<text>Francis Harrison Pierpont (January 25, 1814March 24, 1899), called the &quot;Father of West Virginia,&quot; was an American lawyer and politician who achieved prominence during the American Civil War. During the conflict&#x27;s first two years, Pierpont served as Governor of the Restored Government of Virginia and, in this capacity, administered the part of Virginia then under Unionist control (i.e., future West Virginia) before West Virginia&#x27;s admission to the Union as a separate state. After recognizing the creation of West Virginia, Pierpont continued to serve as Governor of the Restored Government. However, the degree of civil authority he could exercise was minimal for the remainder of the war. Having claimed to be the legitimate Governor of Virginia for the duration of the conflict, Pierpont assumed civil control of the state&#x27;s entire post-1863 territory following the dissolution of the Confederacy and continued to serve as Governor during the early years of Reconstruction.

In recognition of his significance to its state history, in 1910, West Virginia donated a marble statue of Pierpont as the second of its two contributions to the U.S. Capitol&#x27;s National Statuary Hall Collection.

==Early life==
He was the third son of Francis Peirpoint and was born at the Peirpoint &quot;Plantation&quot; in the &quot;Forks of Cheat&quot; on the Morgantown-Ices Ferry Road, Monongalia County. His middle name, &quot;Harrison,&quot; was added later by the boy&#x27;s father in honor of his commanding officer, General William Henry Harrison.

Pierpont, the original family name, was altered to Peirpoint in the land office at Richmond, Virginia in issuing patents for land deeded to his grandfather, John Pierpont (1742-1796) who grew up in Fairfax County, Virginia and attended the Fairfax Friends Meeting, but left to enlist in the Revolutionary Army, then after it ended moved west to Morgantown, West Virginia. Virginia lawyers advised the family that to hold their grandfather&#x27;s land, they had to spell their last name as recorded in the patent. Thus Francis used the name &quot;Peirpoint&quot; throughout his life. He also utilized &quot;Pierpont&quot; throughout most of his adult life, including during his terms as the Civil War and Reconstruction Governor of Virginia. In 1880, when President Garfield appointed him Collector of Internal Revenue, Peirpoint sent his name to the U.S. Senate as Francis H. Pierpont. Pierpont writes that &quot;He consented to the change of his name because it was right.&quot;

While Frank was a boy, his family moved their leatherworking business to what is today Marion County, West Virginia. He was a great-grandson of Morgantown&#x27;s founder Zackquill Morgan.
Frank Pierpont was educated in a one-room schoolhouse and by his own reading. Pierpont became linked with the region&#x27;s history for the rest of his life. After walking to Pennsylvania, he enrolled in and graduated from Allegheny College. Later, he taught school in Harrison County. Then he traveled and became an abolitionist after seeing slavery&#x27;s abuses in Mississippi.
He returned home to Fairmont, handled the family&#x27;s tanning business, became active in the Methodist Church, and began studying law. He was admitted to the bar in 1841. In 1848, Pierpont became the local attorney for the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad. Before entering politics, he also helped found Fairmont Male and Female Seminary, the forerunner to Fairmont State University.

==Political career==
===Civil War===
An active supporter of Abraham Lincoln, Pierpont became more involved in politics as an outspoken opponent of Virginia&#x27;s secession from the Union. When Virginia seceded and entered the war, delegates from the northwestern counties of Virginia, which refused to join the Confederacy, met at the Wheeling Convention. Declaring that their elected officials had abandoned their posts, a rump government was established in Wheeling, with Pierpont as the provisional Governor. Claiming to be the legitimate government of the entire Commonwealth of Virginia, the &quot;Restored Government&quot; drafted a new Virginia Constitution and sent representatives to the Union Congress. The Second Wheeling Convention met on June 11, 1861. On June 20, 1861, it unanimously elected Pierpont governor of the Restored Government of Virginia, with the recognition of President Lincoln. In 1862, Pierpont attended the Loyal War Governors&#x27; Conference in Altoona, Pennsylvania, organized by Pennsylvania Governor Andrew Gregg Curtin, which ultimately backed Abraham Lincoln&#x27;s Emancipation Proclamation and the Union war effort. Pierpont was again elected governor for a four-year term by the legislature on May 28, 1863.

Under Pierpont&#x27;s leadership, the Wheeling government called for a popular vote on creating a new separate state. Despite a lack of overwhelming support and widespread fraud in the voting process, the Restored Government pressed the U.S. Congress for statehood, which also approved the issue. The new state took the name West Virginia and was admitted into the Union in 1863. A lifelong West Virginian, Pierpont had hoped to become the new state&#x27;s first governor. However, the Lincoln administration was keen to ensure that the continuity of the Restored Government was not disrupted and made clear it would not countenance Pierpont leaving his post unless a suitable successor could be found, who, for political reasons, would have had to be a man with roots in the Commonwealth&#x27;s post-1863 borders who was loyal to the United States, willing to recognize West Virginia, qualified to serve as a state governor and yet also willing to accept an office that it appeared would be little more than a figurehead position for an indeterminate period.

As no viable candidate willing to succeed Pierpont could be found, Arthur I. Boreman was elected governor of West Virginia. At the same time, Pierpont reluctantly remained Governor of the &quot;restored&quot; state of Virginia. From 1863 until 1865, the Pierpont administration&#x27;s &quot;de facto&quot; control was limited to those parts of the Commonwealth not claimed by West Virginia that were held by Federal arms - specifically, several Northern Virginia, Norfolk area, and Eastern Shore counties. While Pierpont claimed Richmond as the official state capital (as his administration had done since 1861), the &quot;de facto&quot; seat of government was established in Alexandria for the remainder of the Civil War. The pro-Confederate state government in Richmond maintained its claim to the Commonwealth&#x27;s antebellum borders and administered the regions of the Commonwealth still held under Confederate arms - at the time of West Virginia&#x27;s statehood, this included at least some measure of control about thirteen counties claimed by the newly admitted state. In 1864 Pierpont called a Constitutional Convention in Alexandria that recognized West Virginia, abolished slavery, and promulgated the civil Constitution in force in Virginia until 1869.

On May 9, 1865, one month after the surrender of the Army of Northern Virginia, President Andrew Johnson recognized Pierpont as the Governor of Virginia. Pierpont immediately re-located the seat of government to Richmond.

===Reconstruction===
Pierpont followed a policy of forgiveness to those politicians who had served in the Confederate military and government. The Virginia government started to pass laws restoring ex-Confederates to their lost privileges, to the displeasure of most former Union Republicans. As the South became increasingly resistant to Reconstruction after the war, the United States Congress passed the Military Reconstruction Act of 1867. Through this Act, Virginia was designated the &quot;First Military District&quot; in 1868, and military commander John Schofield replaced Pierpont with Henry H. Wells until state delegates could write and enact a new constitution. According to the Civil War historian Richard Lowe, Hiram Bond, a former Vanderbilt family functionary and friend of Grant, planned the removal of Pierpont and installation of Welles. Pierpont became one of the key figures in the Virginia constitutional convention of 1867–1868, which resulted in the Underwood Constitution of 1869. After this, Pierpont left Virginia politics and returned to his law practice in West Virginia.

Pierpont subsequently was elected to one term in the West Virginia House of Delegates in 1870 but lost his seat when the Democrats took control of the state. His last public office was as a collector of Internal Revenue under President James Garfield. After his retirement, he helped create the West Virginia Historical Society, as well as served as President of the Methodist Protestant Church.

==Death and legacy==
He died at his daughter&#x27;s home in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania on March 24, 1899. Three years later, his remains were relocated to Woodlawn Cemetery in Fairmont, West Virginia. They reside next to those of his wife Julia and three of their four children.

A monument to Francis Pierpont was installed in Wheeling on West Virginia Day in 2015.

<text>Sanyuanqiao, or Sanyuan Bridge () is a major overpass on the northeastern stretch of Beijing&#x27;s 3rd Ring Road. It was opened in 1984.

The overpass links three major passageways in Beijing and the complex structure made it a speciality on its own in its first days. The Airport Expressway, Jingshun Road (China National Highway 101) and the 3rd Ring Road were interlinked.

Originally, the Airport Expressway&#x27;s position was the old airport road. Today, the old airport road has become a service, or auxiliary road, to the current Airport Expressway.

The simple complexity of the overpass was tempting to tamper with, but in the 1990s, the temptation was too much (caused by excess traffic): another portion of a flyover was built for vehicles heading from the eastern 3rd Ring Road to interlink directly with the Airport Expressway.

This bridge also lends its name to this entire region of Beijing, one of the few (another one being Sihui Bridge, providing the name for Sihui Station and its surroundings) bridges in Beijing to do so.

At Sanyuanqiao, there is also a Beijing Subway station. Line 10 and the Airport Express stop at Sanyuanqiao Station.

In 2015, the original bridge was demolished and replaced in 43 hours. The replacement was constructed as a single prefabricated piece and installed in place of the original.

<text>Cronulla is a suburb of Sydney, in the state of New South Wales, Australia. Boasting numerous surf beaches and swimming spots, the suburb attracts both tourists and Greater Sydney residents. Cronulla is 26 kilometres south of the Sydney central business district, in the local government area of the Sutherland Shire.

Cronulla is on a peninsula framed by Botany Bay to the north, Bate Bay to the east, Port Hacking to the south, and Gunnamatta Bay to the west. The neighbouring suburb of Woolooware lies to the west of Cronulla, and Burraneer lies to the southwest. The Kurnell peninsula, the site of the first landfall on the eastern coastline made by Captain James Cook in 1770, is reached by driving northeast out of Cronulla on Captain Cook Drive.

==History==

Cronulla is derived from the Aboriginal word , meaning &quot;place of the small pink seashell&quot; in the dialect of the area&#x27;s Indigenous inhabitants, the Gweagal, who were a clan of the Tharawal (or Dharawal) tribe. They inhabited the southern geographic areas of Sydney. The beaches were named by Surveyor Robert Dixon who surveyed here in 1827-28 and, by 1840, the main beach was still known as Karranulla. In July 1852 the schooner Venus was wrecked on the beach, which was referred to in newspaper reports as Cooranulla.

Matthew Flinders and George Bass explored and mapped the coastline and Port Hacking estuary in 1796 and the southernmost point of Cronulla is named Bass and Flinders Point in their honour. John Connell received a grant of in 1835. Thomas Holt (1811–88) owned most of the land that stretched from Sutherland to Cronulla in the 1860s. Holt built Sutherland House on the foreshore of Gwawley Bay in 1818, on the eastern side of Sylvania. In 1888 master mariner Captain Joseph Henry Rounce Spingall became the pioneering resident of Cronulla when, with his family, he constructed the two-storey &#x27;Oriental Guest House&#x27; on land above where today&#x27;s North Cronulla Hotel sits. The Depression of 1890 and a lack of reliable transport access from Sutherland saw &quot;The Captain&#x27;s&quot; pub sold. The Cronulla area was subdivided in 1895 and land was offered for sale at 10 pounds per acre. In 1899, the government named the area , which means &quot;sandy hills&quot;. On 26 February 1908, it was officially changed to Cronulla and Gunnamatta was used for the name of the bay, on the western side.

After the Illawarra railway line was built to Sutherland in 1885, the area became popular for picnics and swimming. Steam trams operated between Cronulla and Sutherland from 1911. Many regulars rented beach houses at Cronulla every year for school holidays. The Oriental Hotel was built by Captain Spingall in 1888, on the present site of apartments behind the North Cronulla Hotel. The Cecil Hotel was located on the foreshore of South Cronulla and the Ritz Café was popular with holiday-makers. The Cecil Apartments were built on the former site of this hotel. The steam trams were replaced by the Cronulla branch of the Illawarra railway line when it opened in 1939.

The post office opened in January 1891, known as Cronulla Beach, but closed in 1893. It reopened in 1907 and the name was officially changed to Cronulla in 1929. 

The Cronulla School of Arts was established in 1904. The original wooden building was demolished and replaced by the current School of Arts building in November 1912 and is now one of the oldest buildings in Cronulla.

The first public school opened in 1910. In 1955, Cronulla Library opened. From the 1950s, many of the guest houses began being replaced by high rise flats. Even though it developed as a residential area, Cronulla remained popular with beachgoers and tourists. Several hotels, motels and serviced apartments operate today. The Cronulla Bicentennial Plaza opened in February 1989.

In 2005 the beachfront at Cronulla was the scene of widely publicised mob disturbances and violent confrontations. These incidents continued over a number of days and also spread to other areas in Sydney.

<text>Burke Frederick St John Trend, Baron Trend, (2 January 1914 – 21 July 1987) was a British civil servant and later Rector of Lincoln College, Oxford.

==Biography==
Trend was educated at Whitgift School and Merton College, Oxford, where he took first class honours in Classics. He then joined the Civil Service, spending most of his career in the Treasury. He became Cabinet Secretary under Alec Douglas-Home, Harold Wilson and Ted Heath between 1963 and 1973.

Trend was appointed a Commander of the Royal Victorian Order (CVO) in the 1953 Coronation Honours. He was appointed a Companion of the Order of the Bath (CB) in the 1955 New Year Honours, promoted to Knight Commander (KCB) in the 1962 Birthday Honours and a Knight Grand Cross in the 1968 New Year Honours. On 7 March 1974 he was created a life peer as Baron Trend, of Greenwich in Greater London.

He led an investigation in the 1970s into allegations of penetration of the British Secret Services from before World War II until the 1960s. His conclusion was that there was insufficient evidence to support the allegations. Peter Wright in his memoirs, &quot;Spycatcher&quot;, discusses Trend and his report.

Trend married Patricia Charlotte Shaw in 1949; they had three children. One son, Michael Trend, was a Member of Parliament (Conservative) from 1992 to 2005.

<doc id="740453" wikidata="Q1654161" url="?curid=740453" title="Shao Kahn">
<text>Shao Kahn is a fictional character and one of the main antagonists of the &quot;Mortal Kombat&quot; fighting game franchise by Midway Games and NetherRealm Studios. Depicted as emperor of the fictional realm Outworld, he is one of the franchise&#x27;s primary villains. Feared for his immense strength, which he complements with a large hammer, and knowledge of black magic, Shao Kahn seeks conquest of all the realms, including Earth. He serves as the main antagonist final boss of &quot;Mortal Kombat II&quot; (1993), &quot;Mortal Kombat 3&quot; (1995) and its updates, and the 2011 reboot, as well as the action-adventure spin-off &quot;Mortal Kombat: Shaolin Monks&quot; (2005). An amalgam of Shao Kahn and DC Comics villain Darkseid also appears as the main antagonist and final boss of &quot;Mortal Kombat vs. DC Universe&quot; (2008) under the name Dark Kahn. A younger persona known as General Shao appears in &quot;Mortal Kombat 1&quot; (2023).

Shao Kahn is one of the most celebrated villains in video games. Noted as a difficult boss, he has received praise for his design, in-game abilities, and mannerisms, particularly his mocking and taunting of players. The character has appeared in various media outside of the games, including as the main villain of the film &quot;Mortal Kombat Annihilation&quot; (1997).

==Character design and gameplay==
Shao Kahn was inspired by the Star Wars villain, Darth Vader, where the audience knew that there was an emperor ruling the universe, but knew nothing else about him, creating a desire in the viewer to want to know more. Tobias had something very similar with Shang Tsung and Shao Kahn, and for him that came from the feeling he had as a child when he learned more about what made the &quot;Star Wars&quot; universe tick in &quot;Empire Strikes Back&quot;. Tobias wanted gamers to have that same feeling. Kahn&#x27;s attire for &quot;Mortal Kombat II&quot; was developed by Mark Runion. Kahn started out unmasked and with large gnashing teeth similar to Baraka, since everyone from Outworld was originally supposed to be of Baraka&#x27;s race. The idea of all inhabitants of Outworld being Tarkatan was later dropped. His identity has only appeared in &quot;Shaolin Monks&quot; and &quot;Mortal Kombat 11&quot;; with the latter revealing an inhuman, but not monstrous, face.

In &quot;MKII&quot;, Kahn was digitally resized to a taller height to make him tower over the playable characters, and was played by actor and bodybuilder Brian Glynn. Glynn considered Shao Kahn as a positive experience, recalling his time with John Parish (Jax) who recommended him for the role Kahn. During the audition, artist John Tobias requested him to expose his chest which resulted in his quick inclusion in the game as the actor did not have to perform martial arts. Glynn&#x27;s portrayal of Kahn was popular with the Midway staff to the point they requested his help with other projects. In many official depictions of Shao Kahn made by Midway, he is shown wearing a cape, though he never wore one in his original digitized appearances. &quot;Mortal Kombat: Deception&quot; was the first time in which he wore the cape in-game. &quot;Mortal Kombat&quot; sound designer Dan Forden explained that the reason for Kahn not wearing the cape in earlier games, in addition to Kabal not being able to wear a trenchcoat in &quot;Mortal Kombat 3&quot;, was that loose flowing clothing took up memory.

Shao Kahn originated as an unplayable boss character in &quot;MKII&quot;. He is fought as a boss (in most cases, the final boss) in most of his appearances, but became a player character for the first time in the home ports of &quot;MK3&quot; as an unlockable character. He would also be playable in the home ports of &quot;Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3&quot;, &quot;Mortal Kombat Trilogy&quot;, the GameCube and PlayStation Portable versions of &quot;Mortal Kombat: Deception&quot;, &quot;Mortal Kombat: Armageddon&quot; and &quot;Mortal Kombat vs. DC Universe&quot;. Shao Kahn also appears as a playable character in &quot;Mortal Kombat 11&quot; via DLC. In &quot;Mortal Kombat&quot; (2011), Shao Kahn is once again a non-playable boss. He is also the final boss in the beat &#x27;em up spin-off, &quot;Shaolin Monks&quot;.

Shao Kahn&#x27;s special moves consist mainly of powerful shoulder barges, magical projectiles, and attacks with his signature giant maul, the &quot;Wrath Hammer&quot;. In some of his appearances as a boss, blocking Kahn&#x27;s attacks will stun the player. Since his debut, his signature tactic has been taunting players before, during, and after rounds with such statements as &quot;Bow to me!&quot;, &quot;Feel the power of Shao Kahn!&quot;, and &quot;It&#x27;s official, you suck!&quot;

==Appearances==
===&quot;Mortal Kombat&quot; games===
Shao Kahn first appears as the final boss of &quot;Mortal Kombat II&quot; and &quot;Mortal Kombat 3&quot;. In the former, he invokes a rematch against Earthrealm and faces them in Mortal Kombat to facilitate an invasion of Earthrealm, only to be defeated and foiled by Liu Kang. In the latter game, Shang Tsung resurrects Queen Sindel so Shao can use her to mount another invasion of Earthrealm. Ignoring the Mortal Kombat&#x27;s rules, Shao steals billions of souls from Earthrealm to empower himself and merge it with Outworld as well as sends extermination squads to kill Raiden&#x27;s chosen warriors, only to be defeated by Liu Kang once more.

Shao makes a cameo appearance in &quot;Mortal Kombat: Deadly Alliance&quot;, in which he is seemingly killed by the titular Deadly Alliance. In &quot;Mortal Kombat: Deception&quot;, in which he appears as a playable character in the GameCube version, it is revealed the Deadly Alliance killed a decoy while the real Shao set out to reclaim his empire from Onaga. In &quot;Mortal Kombat: Armageddon&quot;, in which he also appears as a playable character, he succeeded in defeating Onaga before forming a fragile alliance with him and the Deadly Alliance to defeat Blaze and seize his godlike power.

Shao Kahn appears as a playable character in and the final boss of &quot;Mortal Kombat&quot; (2011). After successfully obtaining Blaze&#x27;s power, he attempts to kill Raiden until the latter sends a message back to his past self to avert the events of &quot;Armageddon&quot;. In the subsequently altered timeline, when Shao mounts his invasion of Earthrealm while ignoring Mortal Kombat&#x27;s rules, the enraged Elder Gods empower Raiden, allowing him to kill Shao.

A past version of Shao appears as a playable character in &quot;Mortal Kombat 11&quot; (&quot;MK11&quot;). After being brought to the present by Kronika and promised a timeline without Raiden, he agrees to work for her. Amidst this, he attempts to retake his throne from Kotal Kahn and rebuild Outworld&#x27;s forces until he is defeated by Kitana. In the DLC storyline expansion &quot;Aftermath&quot;, Shang Tsung reunites Shao and Sindel to help him steal Kronika&#x27;s Crown of Souls. The tyrants betray Earthrealm and Outworld&#x27;s forces and assist Shang Tsung in assaulting Kronika&#x27;s keep until they are betrayed in turn by him.

A new incarnation of Shao named General Shao appears as a playable character in &quot;Mortal Kombat 1&quot; (&quot;MK1&quot;). After Fire God Liu Kang creates a second new timeline, Shao was born a sickly child into a proud military family before his father molded him into the perfect soldier. By the present, Shao became commander of Outworld&#x27;s armies and a staunch Outworld patriot. Believing Outworld should conquer Earthrealm, he openly disagrees with Empress Sindel&#x27;s policies, but makes no move against her until Shang Tsung and Quan Chi help him mount a rebellion against her, only to be foiled by her and Liu Kang. Following this, Shao is arrested and replaced by Kitana, though he later escapes prison and rallies followers to help him rebel against Outworld&#x27;s royalty and tame Onaga for use in his plans.

==Reception==
Shao Kahn was nominated in &quot;Nintendo Power&quot; Awards &#x27;94 and &#x27;95 in the category &quot;Worst Villain&quot; (actually honoring the top video-game villains) of the year, coming second place in 1995. &quot;GamesRadar&quot; praised Shao Kahn&#x27;s role as an antagonist, putting him in their 2013 list of the best villains in video game history at number 24, and including him among the 12 most unfair gaming bosses in 2014. &quot;Guinness World Records Gamer&#x27;s Edition&quot; listed Shao Kahn as 41st in their list of &quot;top 50 video game villains&quot;. &quot;Complex&quot; ranked Shao Kahn from &quot;Mortal Kombat II&quot; as the &quot;coolest&quot; boss in fighting game history in 2012, stating that &quot;in the history of fighting games, no boss has ever been cooler or more exciting to lose against.&quot; The &quot;GamesRadar&quot; staff described Shao Kahn as the best villain in video games, stating that &quot;There are plenty of bad guys in the Mortal Kombat games, but the Emperor of Outworld, Shao Kahn, takes the wickedness cake.&quot;

In UGO&#x27;s 2012 list of the top &quot;Mortal Kombat&quot; characters, Shao Kahn placed sixteenth. In their retrospection listing of &quot;MK&quot; characters, UGO stated most favorite thing about him was the fact that &quot;his speaking voice is the voice of the announcer heard throughout the series.&quot; &quot;Complex&quot; placed him seventh on her 2013 list of most brutal fighters in &quot;Mortal Kombat&quot;, adding that &quot;he was brutal not only in his strength but his cunning, too.&quot; On the other hand, GamesRadar felt that Shao Kahn was more anticlimactic when compared to the subboss Kintaro as he viewed Kintaro as a more menacing character in contrast to the Emperor who was compared with He-Man in a negative fashion in terms of design. When a mask of Shao Kahn was made for sale, &quot;Game Informer&quot; noticed that it was one of the few times people had the chance to see boss&#x27; true face, comparing him to a &quot;Star Trek&quot; alien.

&quot;Game Informer&quot; featured him on their list of gaming&#x27;s &quot;crappiest&quot; fathers, commenting he due to his misbehaviour with his wife Sindel and his adopted daughter Kitana. The character&#x27;s incarnation in the 2011 &quot;Mortal Kombat&quot; has been criticized for how hard it is to defeat him to the point of frustrating gamers; that same year, CraveOnline included him on the list of top five &quot;bosses you want to kill but can&#x27;t&quot;. The fight against Shao Kahn in &quot;Mortal Kombat 3&quot; was also noted for its difficulty; in 2013, &quot;Complex&quot; ranked it as the 23rd hardest boss battle in video games. Kahn&#x27;s portrayal in &quot;Mortal Kombat 11&quot; was the subject of controversy for him referencing President Donald Trump and his slogan but under the name &quot;Make Outworld Great Again&quot;.

&quot;VentureBeat&quot; found Shao Khan highly difficult to defeat in most of his appearances, resulting in the need for the player to come up with strategies need to kill the boss. &quot;The New York Times&quot; panned Shao Kahn&#x27;s characterization alongside his army from &quot;Mortal Kombat Annihilation&quot; for making &quot;Saddam Hussein look like Mr. Rogers&quot;. &quot;Den of Geek&quot; was confused by the lack of promotion for Shao Kahn in the film reboot as teases said that Shang Tsung was the actual Outworld Emperor instead, leading to speculations that both characters were combined to for one single antagonist in the film.

<text>Harry Fischel (1865 - 1948) was an American businessman and philanthropist based in New York City at the turn of the 20th century.

Fischel was one of the leading pioneers in the growth of American Judaism, in general, during the dynamic and precedent-setting first half of the 20th century. He was instrumental in the development of American Jewish Orthodox institutions during that period.

== Biography ==
Yisroel Aaron Fischel (later known as Harry) was born on July 19, 1865, in the small, isolated Russian (Now Lithuania) town of Meretz (Merkinė) to poor parents who were pious Jews. He became an architect and a builder at 19, emigrated to America virtually penniless at 20 (after giving most of his earnings to his parents who remained in Russia). He earned his first million in real estate at a young age and sent money home to help support his parents in Russia even before he was earning $10 per week in America. 

== Involvement in society ==
Fischel was active in matters concerning Jewish interests in the United States and Mandatory Palestine, including support for religious institutions and facilities such as Jewish schools and colleges, synagogues and kosher food kitchens, as well as various support for the Jewish worldwide community, with a focus on Jewish immigrants to the United States and Mandate Palestine.

Among his numerous distinctions were his service as the treasurer of the Hebrew Sheltering and Immigrant Aid Society (HIAS), beginning in 1890; a director of the Beth Israel Medical Center in 1891 (credited with laying the groundwork for its kosher policy up to and including the present); vice-president of the Hebrew Free Loan Societies; Vice President of the Beth Israel Medical Center in 1900; vice president of the Beth Hamedrash Hagadol on the Lower East Side, until he moved to Park Avenue in 1902; builder of the first modern Jewish theater in 1904 (exclusively for productions in Yiddish); charter member of the American Jewish Committee in 1906; prevailed on his co-founders to designate him to chair its second annual luncheon, to assure it and its future events would be kosher; personally prevailed on President Taft to install a kosher kitchen at Ellis Island in 1911, so that Orthodox Jewish immigrants could have the opportunity to eat kosher food during a probation period, thus becoming strong enough to pass the test to avoid deportation; president of the Uptown Talmud Torah in Manhattan in 1911 (in one of the first structures in New York built exclusively for this purpose, and then widely considered &quot;the most important Jewish educational institution in America&quot;); first treasurer of the Central Committee for the Relief of Jews Suffering Through the War, in 1914; member of the executive committee of the Joint Distribution Committee in 1914; organizer of the Palestine Building Loan Association in 1921; builder of a home, office, yeshiva and synagogue for the Chief Rabbi of Palestine Abraham Isaac Kook at his own expense in 1923; he established the Harry Fischel Institute for Talmudic Research in 1931 (which, after the creation of the country of Israel, trained, for many years, a large percentage of the judges who presided over the religious courts in the country); established the Harry Fischel Foundation on January 4, 1932 (later renamed the Harry &amp; Jane Fischel Foundation).

Fischel was also a long-time member of Congregation Kehilath Jeshurun on Manhattan&#x27;s Upper East Side, in which he had various roles and served as a trustee.

Fischel&#x27;s was involved in efforts on behalf of Yeshiva College and its predecessor entities. In 1889, Fischel became a director of the Etz Chaim Yeshiva; in 1895, Fischel became the chair of its building committee; in 1915, he became the chair of the building committee of the newly merged Etz Chaim Yeshiva and Rabbi Isaac Elchanan Theological Seminary, and a vice-president of the latter; in 1920 he became the chair of the building committee of the institution that would become Yeshiva College; and in 1927 he was the chair of the building committee upon the occasion of the laying of the cornerstone of the main building of the main campus of Yeshiva College in Washington Heights (now known as the Wilf Campus). Fischel established the Harry Fischel Graduate School for Higher Jewish Studies at Yeshiva University in 1945. The main beit midrash (study hall) in the main building of the main campus is known to this day as the Harry Fischel Study Hall. He played a primary role in saving the college from the brink of bankruptcy and closure during the Great Depression. A plaque in the main building of the main campus marks Fischel&#x27;s service as acting president of Yeshiva College.

== Descendants ==
Fischel had four daughters and no sons who survived into adulthood. One daughter married a physician (Dr. Henry Rafsky), one married a lawyer (State Senator Albert Wald), one married a banker (David Kass), and one, married a rabbi (Rabbi Herbert S. Goldstein). Fischel openly stated that since he had no sons to bear his name, he had more of a motivation than most people to perpetuate his name by other means, in his case, the institutions named after him, in Israel and in America

His daughter Rebecca Goldstein was a founder and served as the first president of the Women&#x27;s Branch of the Orthodox Union.

<text>Skin grafting, a type of graft surgery, involves the transplantation of skin without a defined circulation. The transplanted tissue is called a skin graft.

Surgeons may use skin grafting to treat:
* extensive wounding or trauma
* burns
* areas of extensive skin loss due to infection such as necrotizing fasciitis or purpura fulminans
* specific surgeries that may require skin grafts for healing to occur – most commonly removal of skin cancers

Skin grafting often takes place after serious injuries when some of the body&#x27;s skin is damaged. Surgical removal (excision or debridement) of the damaged skin is followed by skin grafting. The grafting serves two purposes: reducing the course of treatment needed (and time in the hospital), and improving the function and appearance of the area of the body which receives the skin graft.

There are two types of skin grafts:
* Partial-thickness: The more common type involves removing a thin layer of skin from a healthy part of the body (the donor section).
* Full-thickness: Involves excising a defined area of skin, with a depth of excision down to the fat. The full thickness portion of skin is then placed at the recipient site.

A full-thickness skin graft is more risky, in terms of the body accepting the skin, yet it leaves only a scar line on the donor section, similar to a Cesarean-section scar. In the case of full-thickness skin grafts, the donor section will often heal much more quickly than the injury and causes less pain than a partial-thickness skin graft. A partial thickness donor site must heal by re-epithelialization which can be painful and take an extensive length of time.

==Medical uses==
Two layers of skin created from animal sources has been found to be useful in venous leg ulcers.

==Classification==
Grafts can be classified by their thickness, the source, and the purpose. By source:
* Autologous: The donor skin is taken from a different site on the same individual&#x27;s body (also known as an &quot;autograft&quot;).
* Isogeneic: The donor and recipient individuals are genetically identical (e.g., monozygotic twins, animals of a single inbred strain; &quot;isograft&quot; or &quot;syngraft&quot;).
* Allogeneic: The donor and recipient are of the same species (human→human, dog→dog; &quot;allograft&quot;).
* Xenogeneic: The donor and recipient are of different species (e.g., bovine cartilage; pig skin; &quot;xenograft&quot; or &quot;heterograft&quot;).
* Prosthetic: Lost tissue is replaced with synthetic materials such as metal, plastic, or ceramic (&quot;prosthetic implants&quot;).

Allografts, xenografts, and prosthetic grafts are usually used as temporary skin substitutes, that is a wound dressing for preventing infection and fluid loss. They will eventually need to be removed as the body starts to reject the foreign material. Autologous grafts and some forms of treated allografts can be left on permanently without rejection. Genetically modified pigs can produce allograft-equivalent skin material, and tilapia skin is used as an experimental cheap xenograft in places where porcine skin is unavailable and in veterinary medicine.

By thickness:
;Split-thickness
:A split-thickness skin graft (STSG) includes the epidermis and part of the dermis. Its thickness depends on the donor site and the needs of the person receiving the graft. It can be processed through a skin mesher which makes apertures onto the graft, allowing it to expand up to nine times its size. Split-thickness grafts are frequently used as they can cover large areas and the rate of autorejection is low. The same site can be harvested again after six weeks. The donor site heals by re-epithelialisation from the dermis and surrounding skin and requires dressings.
;Full-thickness
:A full-thickness skin graft consists of the epidermis and the entire thickness of the dermis. The donor site is either sutured closed directly or covered by a split-thickness skin graft.
;Composite graft
:A composite graft is a small graft containing skin and underlying cartilage or other tissue. Donor sites include, for example, ear skin and cartilage to reconstruct nasal alar rim defects.

==Donor selection==
When grafts are taken from other animals, they are known as heterografts or xenografts. By definition, they are temporary biologic dressings which the body will reject within days to a few weeks. They are useful in reducing the bacterial concentration of an open wound, as well as reducing fluid loss.

For more extensive tissue loss, a full-thickness skin graft, which includes the entire thickness of the skin, may be necessary. This is often performed for defects of the face and hand where contraction of the graft should be minimized. The general rule is that the thicker the graft, the less the contraction and deformity.

Cell cultured epithelial autograft (CEA) procedures take skin cells from the person needing the graft to grow new skin cells in sheets in a laboratory; because the cells are taken from the person, that person&#x27;s immune system will not reject them. However, because these sheets are very thin (only a few cell layers thick) they do not stand up to trauma, and the &quot;take&quot; is often less than 100%. Research is investigating the possibilities of combining CEA and a dermal matrix in one product.

Experimental procedures are being tested for burn victims using stem cells in solution which are applied to the burned area using a skin cell gun. Recent advances have been successful in applying the cells without damage.
In order to remove the thin and well preserved skin slices and strips from the donor, surgeons use a special surgical instrument called a dermatome. This usually produces a split-thickness skin graft, which contains the epidermis with only a portion of the dermis. The dermis left behind at the donor site contains hair follicles and sebaceous glands, both of which contain epidermal cells which gradually proliferate out to form a new layer of epidermis. The donor site may be extremely painful and vulnerable to infection. There are several ways to treat donor site pain. These include subcutaneous anesthetic agents, topical anesthetic agents, and certain types of wound dressings.

== Healing process ==

=== Stages of healing ===
The graft is carefully spread on the bare area to be covered. It is held in place by a few small stitches or surgical staples. The healing process for skin grafts typically occurs in three stages: plasmatic imbibition, capillary inosculation, and neovascularization.

During the first 24 hours, the graft is initially nourished by a process called plasmatic imbibition in which the graft &quot;drinks plasma&quot; (i.e., absorbs nutrients from the underlying recipient bed).

Between 2–3 days, new blood vessels begin growing from the recipient area into the transplanted skin in a process called capillary inosculation.

Between 4–7 days, neovascularization occurs in which new blood vessels form between the graft and the recipient tissues.

=== Other ===
To prevent the accumulation of fluid under the graft which can prevent its attachment and revascularization, the graft is frequently meshed by making lengthwise rows of short, interrupted cuts, each a few millimeters long, with each row offset by half a cut length like bricks in a wall. In addition to allowing for drainage, this allows the graft to both stretch and cover a larger area as well as to more closely approximate the contours of the recipient area. However, it results in a rather pebbled appearance upon healing that may ultimately look less aesthetically pleasing.

An increasingly common aid to both pre-operative wound maintenance and post-operative graft healing is the use of negative pressure wound therapy (NPWT). This system works by placing a section of foam cut to size over the wound, then laying a perforated tube onto the foam. The arrangement is then secured with bandages. A vacuum unit then creates negative pressure, sealing the edges of the wound to the foam, and drawing out excess blood and fluids. This process typically helps to maintain cleanliness in the graft site, promotes the development of new blood vessels, and increases the chances of the graft successfully taking. NPWT can also be used between debridement and graft operations to assist an infected wound in remaining clean for a period of time before new skin is applied. Skin grafting can also be seen as a skin transplant.

==Z-plasty==
This is based upon the principle of mobilizing a full segment of skin from an area to the site needing tissue replacement. The flaps are triangularly shaped opposite each other. It can be used in direct excision and closure of a contracted scar to produce a better looking and healing scar. It helps to elongate and break up a linear scar. It also gives a good result in the release of linear contractures. Z-plasty is of paramount importance to the plastic surgeon and a frequently used method in both single multiple forms.

==Risks==
Risks for the skin graft surgery are:
* Bleeding
* Infection
* Loss of grafted skin
* Nerve damage
* Graft-versus-host disease
* Marjolin&#x27;s ulcer

Rejection may occur in xenografts. To prevent this, the person receiving the graft usually must be treated with long-term immunosuppressant drugs.

==Prognosis==
Most skin grafts are successful, but in some cases grafts do not heal well and may require repeat grafting. The graft should also be monitored for good circulation.

Recovery time from skin grafting can be long. Graft recipients wear compression garments for several months and are at risk for depression and anxiety consequent to long-term pain and loss of function.

==History==
Skin grafting, in more rudimentary forms, has been practiced since ancient times. The Ebers Papyrus of ancient Egypt contains a brief treatise on xenografting. Around 500 years later, members of the Hindu Kamma caste are described as performing skin grafts which included the usage of subcutaneous fat. The 2nd century AD Greek philosopher Celsus is also known to have developed a method to reconstruct the foreskins of Jewish men using skin grafts, as circumcision was considered barbaric in Greek and Roman society.

More modern uses of skin grafting were described in the mid-to-late 19th century, including Reverdin&#x27;s use of the pinch graft in 1869; Ollier&#x27;s and Thiersch&#x27;s uses of the split-thickness graft in 1872 and 1886, respectively; and Wolfe&#x27;s and Krause&#x27;s use of the full-thickness graft in 1875 and 1893, respectively. John Harvey Girdner demonstrated skin graft transplant from a deceased donor in 1880. Today, skin grafting is commonly used in dermatologic surgery. Recently Reverdin&#x27;s technique is used but with very small (less than 3 mm diameter). Such small wounds heal in a short time without scars. This technique is called SkinDot.

==Alternatives to skin grafting==
There are alternatives to skin grafting including skin substitutes using cells from patients, skin from other animals, such as pigs, known as Xenograft and medical devices that help to close large wounds. Xenograft was originally known as &quot;zoografting.&quot; Other animals that can be used include dogs, rabbits, frogs, and cats, with the greatest success achieved with porcine skin. Other skin substitutes include Allograft, Biobrane, TransCyte, Integra, AlloDerm, Cultured epithelial autografts (CEA).

There are medical devices that help close large wounds. The device uses skin anchors that are attached to healthy skin. An adjustable tension controller then exerts a constant pulling tension on sutures looped around the skin anchors. The device gradually closes the wound over time.

== Experimental Techniques ==
“Microcolumn grafting” is a new grafting method being researched that uses needles to take autologous skin biopsies from the patient &amp; implant them in the wound site.

<text>Grafting refers to a surgical procedure to move tissue from one site to another on the body, or from another creature, without bringing its own blood supply with it. Instead, a new blood supply grows in after it is placed. A similar technique where tissue is transferred with the blood supply intact is called a flap. In some instances, a graft can be an artificially manufactured device. Examples of this are a tube to carry blood flow across a defect or from an artery to a vein for use in hemodialysis.

==Classification==
Autografts and isografts are usually not considered as foreign and, therefore, do not elicit rejection. Allografts and xenografts may be recognized as foreign by the recipient and rejected.
* Autograft: graft taken from one part of the body of an individual and transplanted onto another site in the same individual, e.g., skin graft.
* Isograft: graft taken from one individual and placed on another individual of the same genetic constitution, e.g., grafts between identical twins.
* Allograft: graft taken from one individual placed on a genetically non-identical member of the same species.
* Xenograft: graft taken from one individual placed on an individual belonging to another species, e.g., animal to human.

==Types of grafting==
The term grafting is most commonly applied to skin grafting, however many tissues can be grafted: skin, bone, nerves, tendons, neurons, blood vessels, fat, and cornea are tissues commonly grafted today.

Specific types include:
* Skin grafting – often used to treat skin loss due to a wound, burn, infection, or surgery. In the case of damaged skin, it is removed, and new skin is grafted in its place. Skin grafting can reduce the course of treatment and hospitalization needed, and can also improve function and appearance. There are two types of skin grafts:
# Split-thickness skin grafts (the epidermis and part of the dermis)
# Full-thickness skin grafts (the epidermis and the entire thickness of the dermis)
* Bone grafting – used in dental implants, as well as other instances. The bone may be autologous, typically harvested from the iliac crest of the pelvis, or banked bone/allograft.
* Vascular grafting – the use of transplanted or prosthetic blood vessels in surgical procedures.
* Ligament grafting repair – as with anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction or ulnar collateral ligament reconstruction.
* Fat grafting – the process of harvesting adipose tissue through liposuction, processing/centrifugation and injection into soft tissue for improving coverage, volume and contour, typically in the breast, buttock and face.

==Indications==
* Large amount of skin loss due to infections
* Burns
* Skin cancer surgery
* Chronic connective tissue disease

==Reasons for failure==
* Hematoma development when the graft is placed over an active bleed
* Infection
* Seroma development
* Shear force disrupting growth of new blood supply
* Inappropriate bed for new blood supply to grow from, such as cartilage, tendons, or bone

<text>The Maktab al-Khidamat, also Maktab Khadamāt al-Mujāhidīn al-&#x27;Arab (Arabic: مكتب الخدمات or مكتب خدمات المجاهدين العرب, MAK), also known as the Afghan Services Bureau, was founded in 1984 by Abdullah Azzam, Wa&#x27;el Hamza Julaidan, Osama bin Laden and Ayman al-Zawahiri to raise funds and recruit foreign mujahideen for the war against the Soviets in Afghanistan. MAK became the forerunner to al-Qaeda and was instrumental in creating the fundraising and recruitment network that benefited Al-Qaeda during the 1990s.

==History==
During the Soviet–Afghan War, MAK played a minimal role, training a small group of 100 mujahideen for the war and disbursing approximately $1 million in donations from Muslims sourced via a network of global offices in Arab and Western countries, allegedly including approximately thirty in the United States. MAK maintained a close liaison with Pakistan&#x27;s Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) agency through which the intelligence agency of Saudi Arabia, Al Mukhabarat Al A&#x27;amah, funneled money to the Mujaheddin. The MAK paid the airfare for new recruits to be flown into the Afghan region for training. MAK closely cooperated with the Hezb-e Islami Gulbuddin faction of the Peshawar Seven.

As the war ended, a difference in opinion emerged between Azzam and the Egyptian Islamic Jihad (EIJ) led by Ayman al-Zawahiri over the future direction of MAK. Azzam wanted to use the wealth it had generated, and the network it created to help install an Islamic government that aligned with its vision in post-war Afghanistan and opposed &quot;fitna&quot; among Muslims, including attacks against governments of Muslim countries. Al-Zawahiri wanted to use MAK&#x27;s assets to fund a global jihad, including the overthrow of governments in Muslim countries deemed un-Islamic. Bin Laden, MAK&#x27;s most important fundraiser, was strongly influenced by Zawahiri, although he remained close to Azzam.

On November 24, 1989, Azzam was killed by the detonation of 3 mines, by unknown assassins. Azzam as well as his 2 sons were killed in the assassination on their way to their local mosque for evening prayers. Following Azzam&#x27;s death, Osama bin Laden assumed control of MAK and the organization became absorbed into al-Qaeda. Suspects include bin Laden, Ayman al-Zawahiri, competing Afghan militia leaders, Pakistani Interservices Intelligence Agency, the CIA, the Israeli Mossad, Iranian intelligence and the Afghan KhAD.

==Connections in the United States==
MAK established recruitment and fundraising offices in many Western countries, the United States being one of their main fund-raising destinations. On his fundraising tours Abdullah Azzam visited the mosques of &quot;Brooklyn, St. Louis, Kansas City, Seattle, Sacramento, Los Angeles, and San Diego – altogether there were 33 cities in America that opened branches of bin Laden and Azzam&#x27;s organization, the Services Bureau, in order to support the jihad.&quot;

Most MAK financiers and support networks fronting as charitable NGOs were shut down and designated shortly following the September 11 attacks and the subsequent signing of the Patriot Act.

===Al Kifah Refugee Center===
The first offices in the United States were established within the Al Kifah Refugee Center in Brooklyn, and at the Islamic Center in Tucson, Arizona.

The Al Kifah Refugee Centre in Brooklyn, New York, established in the mid-to-late 1980s, was originally operated by Mustafa Shalabi, a close associate of MAK&#x27;s co-founder Abdullah Azzam. Al Kifah was originally established to aid the Mujahideen cause in Afghanistan, and garner both support and funding to fight the invading Soviets. By 1988, Shalabi had set up with two chief aids inside the Al-Farooq Mosque, one of whom, Mahmud Abouhalima, would later be arrested for the 1993 World Trade Center bombing in New York.

By one account approximately 200 &quot;young Arab Immigrants&quot; went to see Shalabi about fighting in Afghanistan. Once enlisted, the prospective jihadists would be organized into groups of three or four and instructed to &quot;pay their own way&quot;. However, before leaving, the recruits were given arms and combat training; one such recruit was El Sayyid Nosair, who received rifle training at the High Rock shooting range in Naugatuck, Connecticut, and went on to assassinate militant Rabbi Meir Kahane in New York in November 1990.

In February 1991, Shalabi was found murdered inside his New York apartment.

It is believed that like Azzam, Shalabi had become embroiled in a power struggle with supporters of Bin Laden, namely Omar Abdel-Rahman (the Blind Sheikh) and his followers from the Al Farouq Mosque. In 1995 Abdel-Rahman was convicted for his part in a plot, known as the &#x27;Day of Terror Plot&#x27;, to bomb various New York City landmarks. It is also alleged that Rahman had intimate knowledge of the original World Trade Center bombing in 1993.

The subsequent investigations by the FBI into the Al-Farooq Mosque and Al Kifah Refugee Centre effectively dismantled the New York office of MAK.

===CARE International===
Established in the early 1990s as the Boston branch of The Al-Kifah Refugee Center, the head of the office, Emad Muntasser changed the name to CARE International Inc. following the 1993 World Trade Center bombing and dismantling of the Brooklyn office.

CARE International enlisted the use of various tactics in attempts to fundraise and recruit possible fighters. These tactics included, but were not limited to, dinner speeches and events at local mosques, donation &quot;phonathons&quot;, open screenings of new Jihadist videos, a newsletter called &quot;Al Hussam&quot;, and even university visits under the guise of Muslim Student Associations.

Muntasser applied for and was granted a tax exemption from the IRS as a &quot;non-political charity&quot;, enabling the organization to receive tax-exempt donations from around the United States. CARE was able to raise almost $2 million through small donations.

In 2005 prosecutors charged Emmad Muntasser, Samir Al-Monta, and Mohammed Mubayyid with conspiracy to defraud the United States and engaging in a scheme to conceal information from the United States.

===IARA and ties to Mark Siljander===
The Islamic African Relief Agency (IARA) was headquartered in Khartoum, Sudan and established over 40 offices around the world, including the United States.

The United States Treasury Department designated as [?]the Islamic African Relief Agency pursuant to Executive Order 13224 on October 13, 2004, for supporting Osama Bin-Laden and MAK (and subsequently Al-Qaeda). The designation cited one instance in which members of IARA accompanied MAK leaders on a fundraising trip to Sudan in which $5 million was raised for MAK.

Mark Siljander, a former Republican Congressman from west Michigan was indicted on charges of money laundering and obstruction of justice. Siljander was given $50,000 in payment by the IARA to lobby for the group&#x27;s removal from a U.S. Senate list of terrorist-linked charities in 2004; however, it is uncertain if he ever engaged in any such lobbying efforts. Siljander was sentenced to one year and one day of prison after pleading guilty to obstruction of justice and acting as an unregistered foreign agent.

One day following the press release by the Department of Justice announcing Siljander&#x27;s conviction, it released a statement of clarification regarding the former congressman&#x27;s knowledge of the IARA: &quot;It is important to note that the indictment does not charge any of the defendants with material support of terrorism, nor does it allege that they knowingly financed acts of terror. Instead, the indictment alleges that some of the defendants engaged in financial transactions that benefited property controlled by a designated terrorist, in violation of the International Emergency Economic Powers Act&quot;.

===Global Relief Foundation===
The Global Relief Foundation was a purported charitable, nonprofit organization that was established and headquartered in Bridgeview, Illinois in 1992. Self-claimed to be the second largest Muslim charity within the United States, the group claimed to have raised approximately $5 million a year.

The Department of Treasury designated the group under E.O. 13224 stating in a press release in October 2002 that &quot;the GRF has connections to, and has providing assistance for, Osama bin-Laden, the Al-Qaeda network, and other known terrorist groups&quot; it went on to note that &quot;One of the founders of GRF was previously a member of Makhtab Al-Khidamat&quot;.

===Benevolence International Foundation===
Founded in Saudi Arabia in the late 1980s as &quot;Lajnat al-Birr al Islamiah&quot; (LIB) by Sheik Adedl Abdul Galil Batterjee, the organization changed its name to Benevolence International Foundation (BIF) upon incorporating in Burbank Illinois, U.S.A in early 1992. During the Soviet–Afghan War, LIB, like many similar organizations helped to fund Mujahideen fighters. However, after the war LIB, now operating as BIF, helped to establish and fund Al-Qaeda.

Between 1993 and 2001 the Benevolence International Foundation is believed to have raised upwards of $17.5 million.

On November 19, 2002, the US Treasury designated BIF (as well as two other entities), as financiers of terrorism, citing the close relationship between BIF&#x27;s CEO Enaam Arnaout and Osama bin-Laden.

<text>Arthur Ingram Boreman (July 24, 1823April 19, 1896) was an American lawyer, politician and judge who helped found the U.S. state of West Virginia. Raised in Tyler County, West Virginia, he served as the state&#x27;s first governor, and a United States senator, as well as represented Wood County in the Virginia House of Delegates, and served as a circuit judge before and after his federal service.

==Early and family life==
Boreman was born in Waynesburg, Pennsylvania, son of Kenner Seaton Boreham and Sarah (Ingram) Boreham. His mother&#x27;s brother, Arthur B. Ingram, was a member of the Virginia House of Delegates and would later serve in the legislature of the Wisconsin Territory. When Arthur was four, his family relocated to Middlebourne, Tyler County, which was then part of Virginia, and is today part of West Virginia.

On November 30, 1864, he married Laurane Tanner Bullock, widow of a Union soldier, with two sons. They would also have two daughters.

==Career==
Arthur Boreman read law with an elder brother and James McNeil Stephenson and was admitted to the Virginia bar in 1845. The following year he moved to Parkersburg. Wood County voters elected Boreman as one of their representatives in the Virginia House of Delegates. Re-elected several times, he served in that part-time position from 1855 until 1861. Although not an abolitionist, but rather a Unionist, Boreman tried unsuccessfully to prevent Virginia&#x27;s secession from the Union in April 1861.

On June 4, 1861, a meeting of Wood County Unionists elected Boreman, Dr. John Moss and Peter G. Van Winkle to the Second Wheeling Convention. Fellow delegates elected him as the convention&#x27;s President. That convention established the Restored Government of Virginia, which the following year led to establishment of a separate State of West Virginia. His elder brother William I. Boreman (1816–1892) represented Doddridge and Tyler Counties in that convention, and his youngest brother Jacob S. Boreman (1831–1913) served in the Union Army before moving to Utah and becoming a judge.

In 1863, West Virginia voters elected Arthur Boreman as the new state&#x27;s first governor. He served from 1863 to 1869, winning re-election in 1864 and 1866 (although Virginia&#x27;s constitutions had forbidden such successive terms). During his third term, Boreman won election to the U.S. Senate to replace Peter G. Van Winkle, and he served from 1869 to 1875. He helped lead efforts to pass the 15th Amendment. When Democrats regained power in West Virginia, Boreman returned to his law practice. He also helped organize recovery efforts after the 1884 Ohio River floods.

In 1888, he was elected the 5th circuit judge and took the bench the following year. He continued to serve until his death seven years later, exhausted after a late trip home from Elizabeth, the Wirt County seat.

==Death and legacy==

Boreman died in Parkersburg in 1896, survived by his wife, two stepsons and daughter. After services at his home and at the Methodist Episcopal Church where he had long served as a lay leader, he was buried at the Odd Fellows cemetery in Parkersburg. His brother Jacob Smith Boremon became a Justice of the Utah territory Supreme Court and his nephew Herbert Stephenson Boreman (1897–1982) served as a judge on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit. Boreman, West Virginia is named for the family.

Boreman Hall, a dormitory on the campus of West Virginia University, is named after him. In addition, Arthur I. Boreman Elementary School is named in his honor in the Tyler County town of Middlebourne, and formerly two elementary schools in the Kanawha County town of Cross Lanes and the outlying Parkersburg area in Wood County were named in his honor.

<doc id="740480" wikidata="Q505531" url="?curid=740480" title="Dermis">
<text>The dermis or corium is a layer of skin between the epidermis (with which it makes up the cutis) and subcutaneous tissues, that primarily consists of dense irregular connective tissue and cushions the body from stress and strain. It is divided into two layers, the superficial area adjacent to the epidermis called the papillary region and a deep thicker area known as the reticular dermis. The dermis is tightly connected to the epidermis through a basement membrane. Structural components of the dermis are collagen, elastic fibers, and extrafibrillar matrix. It also contains mechanoreceptors that provide the sense of touch and thermoreceptors that provide the sense of heat. In addition, hair follicles, sweat glands, sebaceous glands (oil glands), apocrine glands, lymphatic vessels, nerves and blood vessels are present in the dermis. Those blood vessels provide nourishment and waste removal for both dermal and epidermal cells.

==Structure==
The dermis is composed of three major types of cells: fibroblasts, macrophages, and mast cells.

Apart from these cells, the dermis is also composed of matrix components such as collagen (which provides strength), elastin (which provides elasticity), and extrafibrillar matrix, an extracellular gel-like substance primarily composed of glycosaminoglycans (most notably hyaluronan), proteoglycans, and glycoproteins.

==Layers==
===Papillary dermis===
The papillary dermis is the uppermost layer of the dermis. It intertwines with the rete ridges of the epidermis and is composed of fine and loosely arranged collagen fibers.
The papillary region is composed of loose areolar connective tissue. It is named for its fingerlike projections called &quot;papillae&quot; or &quot;dermal papillae&quot; specifically, that extend toward the epidermis and contain either terminal networks of blood capillaries or tactile Meissner&#x27;s corpuscles.

====Dermal papillae====
The dermal papillae (DP) (singular &quot;papilla&quot;, diminutive of Latin &quot;papula&quot;, &#x27;pimple&#x27;) are small, nipple-like extensions (or interdigitations) of the dermis into the epidermis. At the surface of the skin in hands and feet, they appear as epidermal, papillary or friction ridges (colloquially known as fingerprints).

Blood vessels in the dermal papillae nourish all hair follicles and bring nutrients and oxygen to the lower layers of epidermal cells. The pattern of ridges produced in hands and feet are only partly genetically determined features that are developed before birth, the timing and events around the ridge formation area also contributing. They remain substantially unaltered (except in size) throughout life, and therefore determine the patterns of fingerprints, making them useful in certain functions of personal identification.

The dermal papillae are part of the uppermost layer of the dermis, the papillary dermis, and the ridges they form greatly increase the surface area between the dermis and epidermis. Because the main function of the dermis is to support the epidermis, this greatly increases the exchange of oxygen, nutrients, and waste products between these two layers. Additionally, the increase in the surface area prevents the dermal and epidermal layers from separating by strengthening the junction between them. With age, the papillae tend to flatten and sometimes increase in number.

The skin of the hands and fingers and the feet and toes is known by forensic scientists as friction ridge skin. It is known by anatomists as thick skin, volar skin or hairless skin. It has raised ridges, a thicker and more complex epidermis, increased sensory abilities, and the absence of hair and sebaceous glands. The ridges increase friction for improved grasping.

Dermal papillae also play a pivotal role in hair formation, growth and cycling.

In mucous membranes, the equivalent structures to dermal papillae are generally termed &quot;connective tissue papillae&quot;, which interdigitate with the rete pegs of the superficial epithelium.
Dermal papillae are less pronounced in thin skin areas.

===Reticular dermis===
The reticular dermis is the lower layer of the dermis, found under the papillary dermis, composed of dense irregular connective tissue featuring densely-packed collagen fibers. It is the primary location of dermal elastic fibers.

The reticular region is usually much thicker than the overlying papillary dermis. It receives its name from the dense concentration of collagenous, elastic, and reticular fibers that weave throughout it. These protein fibers give the dermis its properties of strength, extensibility, and elasticity. Within the reticular region are the roots of the hair, sebaceous glands, sweat glands, receptors, nails, and blood vessels. The orientation of collagen fibers within the reticular dermis creates lines of tension called Langer&#x27;s lines, which are of some relevance in surgery and wound healing.

<doc id="740484" wikidata="Q863392" url="?curid=740484" title="Bilu (movement)">
<text>Bilu (Hebrew: ביל&quot;ו; also Palestine Pioneers) was a Jewish movement of the late 19th century, fueled predominantly by the immigration of Russian Jews, whose goal was the agricultural settlement of the Land of Israel. Its members were known as Bilu&#x27;im, and the movement sought to inspire Jews to migrate to Ottoman Palestine. The Bilu&#x27;im rejected progressive notions such as Emancipation and assimilation as viable options for Jewish survival. The movement collapsed as a result of the challenging farming conditions in Palestine and a lack of funding to sustain the settlers.

==Etymology==
Originally the movement was called Davio, an acronym of the Hebrew words from the Book of Exodus: &quot;Speak unto the children of Israel that they will go forward.&quot; The movement&#x27;s name was later changed by its founder, Israel Belkind, to &quot;Bilu&quot;, which is an acronym based on a verse from the Book of Isaiah (2:5) &quot;בית יעקב לכו ונלכה&quot; Beit Ya&#x27;akov Lekhu Venelkha (&quot;House of Jacob, let us go [up]&quot;).

==History==

=== Formation ===
The wave of pogroms in 1881–1884, known as &quot;Southern Storms&quot;, in conjunction with Tsar Alexander III of Russia&#x27;s antisemitic May Laws of 1882 prompted mass emigration of Jews from the Russian Empire. The Jews in Russia had originally hoped to move out of the Pale of Settlement (the territory that they were confined to by the authorities), but their hopes were dashed by a proposition from the Russian government for the Jews to move out of Russia entirely. Thus many Jews left; many went to North America, and a smaller group went to Palestine.

On 6 July 1882, the first group of Bilu pioneers emigrated from Russia and arrived in Ottoman Palestine. The group consisted of fourteen university students from Kharkiv led by Israel Belkind, who was later a prominent writer and historian.

=== Initial challenges ===
The arrival of Bilu pioneers marked the beginning of the First Aliyah. They attempted to use farming societies as a way to relieve Jewish economical and social tensions from the Pale of Settlement. Jews were not farmers in the Pale of Settlement, so they saw the &quot;return&quot; to Palestine as a return to their historical practice of farming. As of 1882, there were 525 members in the Bilu movement, all of whom were controlled by the Kharkiv group or &quot;The Central Bureau,&quot; controlled the affairs of all Bilu pioneers until all members were brought to Jaffa. The group aimed to set up a model settlement for all Jewry. The Kharkiv group attempted to buy enough land from Turkey so that the entirety of the membership might settle the prospective land, which would enable the Jews to own the land which they were hoping to farm. Responding to local pressures, the Ottoman authorities started restricting Jewish land purchase and immigration to the empire. Bilu pioneers sought approval from the Ottoman Empire to immigrate to Palestine on the grounds of seeking refuge from Russian oppression, but leadership in the Ottoman empire refused to take more refugees to avoid further political discourse. Most Bilu&#x27;im returned to Russia after receiving the news that they were not welcome in Palestine. However, fourteen members of the movement continued on to Palestine without the permission of the Ottoman Empire and arrived in July 1882. Some members of the Central Bureau went to Jaffa, but shortly after, arrival funds ran dry, and the group could not afford to send for the rest of the members waiting in Russia.

=== The situation in Palestine ===
Most of the Jewish population consisted of Sephardim. The Ashkenazi population was much smaller and much less well off. Some Jews took a short stay at the Jewish farming school in Mikveh Israel with the hopes of furthering their agricultural abilities; Jews were not farmers in Russia. However, this stay was cut short due to hostile encounters with Orthodox Old Yishuv with opposing world views. The continued hostility from the Orthodox Jewish population drove Russian immigrants out of Mikveh Israel. After leaving, the hopeful settlers joined Hovevei Zion (&quot;Lovers of Zion&quot;), unofficially led by Leon Pinsker. Members aided in establishing Rishon LeZion (&quot;First to Zion&quot;), which was an agricultural cooperative. However, Jewish aspiration for agricultural societies did not align with the skill sets many immigrants possessed, which caused them to reach out for help from Baron Edmond James de Rothschild and Baron Maurice de Hirsch. The settlers had previously refused help because the Barons wanted some control over how the colonies they would be funding would operate. After the Bilu&#x27;im admitted to needing help, Hirsch and Rothschild provided funding that led to the establishment of the local wine industry as a result of more successful agricultural work. In 1886, construction began on a winery in Rishon LeZion that became a successful wine-exporting enterprise.

In the winter of 1884, another group of Bilu pioneers founded Gedera. Gedera was established on a tract of land purchased from the Arab village of Qatra by Yehiel Michel Pines of the Hovevei Zion through the auspices of the French consul in Jaffa.

== Goals for the movement ==
The Bilu movement&#x27;s ideology consisted of six articles:

# The return of the people Israel to their historic land
# The rejection of any discussion of national spiritual revival in favor of Jewish settlements in Palestine as the beginning of national rebirth
# The dismissal of European Jewish emancipation and other progressive ideas as guarantees of Jewish survival
# Bringing Jewish people to Palestine to form both physical colonies and spiritual centers
# The recognition that territory is an essential part of Jewish national survival
# The assertion of the society as pioneering and avant-garde

The movement was looking to educate Jewish youth based on the notion that the Jews would be outsiders in any land except for Palestine, where they should consider themselves native. Young people were the ideal audience because they were generally robust and likely capable of manual labor. The Bilu movement sought to spread the belief that even if Jewish people were to give up their Jewish identities to be accepted by their neighbors, they would never achieve true acceptance, and should therefore not relinquish their Jewish identities. One of the foundational beliefs of the Bilu movement was the belief that Jews should immigrate to Palestine. However, many Bilu&#x27;im were not financially prepared or emotionally equipped for emigration out of Europe. Leadership central to the movement, headquartered in Kharkiv (in modern day Ukraine), made it clear to many Bilu&#x27;im that the movement could not fund a mass emigration. Thus, should settlers struggle, they would have to turn to external sources for financial aid.

The Bilu&#x27;im was one of the few Zionist movements that focused on both personal and national revival. Scholar Baruch Kimmerling argues that the group was more religiously- than politically-motivated and that &quot;the newcomers lacked a coherent ideological vision of the Jewish state and nation building.&quot; Yet &quot;later Zionist historiography&quot; claims the group retrospectively as progenitors of Jewish political society in Palestine. The movement sought to reinvigorate the Jew as a farmer in addition to its goal of ensuring Jewish survival through agricultural settlements.The movement was powered by a group ethos as opposed to the individual goals that motivated other pioneers to Ottoman Palestine.

=== Methods ===
The Bilu movement wanted young Jews to immigrate to Palestine to create farming communities. The Bilu idealists wished to create a new breed of Jewish farmer and reintroduced old colonist solutions to different established nations. The movement adopted almost the entire &quot;maskilic&quot; discourse, hoping for a cultural and spiritual renewal. Maskilim were people educated in Hebrew literature but from a more secular standpoint than the religious Hebrew teachings of the Talmud. These people were often a part of the Haskalah movement, also known as the Jewish Enlightenment. By engaging in maskilic discourse, the Bilu leaders appealed their ideals to more traditional and progressive thinkers alike. Some consider the Bilu movement as pioneers of Labor Zionism.

== Collapse of the movement ==
As time went on, the number of Bilu immigrants in Palestine began to decline. It was not easy to live as an agriculturalist in Palestine. Though agriculture was a part of the society, farming settlements tend to be beholden to a scope of natural weather disasters and do require some sort of financial backing to succeed. As a result of challenging farming season, a lack of financial means, and the variability of wine fit for sale, the Russian Bilu&#x27;im ceased to exist. Similarly among other sects of Bilu&#x27;im, such as the activists in Constantinople, fiscal stability proved to be a problem for advancing the movement, and many activists emigrated to Palestine. There, they worked in agriculture as best they could, but continued to struggle. Some emigrated to the United States, funded by the director of the Israeli Mikveh. The aforementioned Gederah became the primary Bilu settlement, and it is known as such today.

<doc id="740489" wikidata="Q7574886" url="?curid=740489" title="Specialized lexicography">
<text>Specialized lexicography is an academic discipline that is concerned with development of theories and principles for the design, compilation, use and evaluation of specialized dictionaries. A specialized dictionary is a dictionary that covers a relatively restricted set of phenomena, usually within one or more subject fields. An alternative term for this type of dictionary is LSP dictionary.

==Various aspects of specialized lexicography==

The study of specialized lexicography deals with several important aspects within the general field of lexicography. The problems involved in designing and making bilingual dictionaries within a culture-dependent subject field involves aspects such as the user&#x27;s linguistic competence in both languages as well as the user&#x27;s extra-linguistic (factual) competence in both cultures.

As described in Nielsen 1994, the coverage of dictionaries may be divided into three lexicographically relevant types. First, the multi-field dictionary, which covers several subject-fields; secondly, the single-field dictionary, which covers one subject-field; and thirdly, the sub-field dictionary, which covers one sub-field within a general subject-field. This distinction is lexicographically important, because the best treatment of a subject-field is given in single-field and sub-field dictionaries, as these are the best reference tools for containing and presenting the relevant data.

The function for which the dictionary has been designed is also relevant. The dictionary may have been designed to help the user with two general types of function: communication-oriented and knowledge-oriented. The former deals with the translation of texts, understanding of texts, production of texts and editing/revision of texts, and the latter deals with the acquisition of knowledge (data and information) in situations that are independent of communication.

Specialized lexicography is therefore the discipline where scholars attempt to develop principles and techniques that can help both the compilers of dictionaries and the users. Nielsen 2008 argues that, in particular, the presentation of data in the dictionary should be structured in such a way that the lexicographic information costs are kept at a minimum.

<doc id="740490" wikidata="Q3101809" url="?curid=740490" title="George Opdyke">
<text>George Opdyke (December 7, 1805 – June 12, 1880) was an entrepreneur and the 76th mayor of New York City serving from 1862 to 1864 during the American Civil War. The New York City draft riots occurred during his tenure.

==Early life==
Opdyke was born on December 7, 1805, in Kingwood Township in Hunterdon County, New Jersey. He was the sixth of nine children born to George Opdyke (1773–1851) and Mary E. (née Stout) Opdyke (1773–1834).

At sixteen years old, after attending the district school when he could and working on the family farm, he became a teacher in one of the neighboring school districts, teaching in Hunterdon County for two years.

==Career==
During the 1820s, after his two-year stint as a teacher in New Jersey, Opdyke began his business career by traveling West to Cleveland, Ohio, where he opened a successful clothing store. He later transferred his business to New Orleans, Louisiana, staying there until 1832.

After giving up his business in New Orleans, he moved to New York and established himself as an importer of woolen goods. His company eventually became the largest clothing manufacturing and merchandiser in the area. In 1868, he gave up the clothing business and turned to banking, becoming well known and prominent as a banker in New York.

After serving as mayor of New York, he served as the first president of the Fourth National Bank of New York.

===Political career===
Until 1848, Opdyke was a Democrat, although he &quot;took no conspicuous part in the affairs of that party.&quot; He left the party to become a delegate to the Buffalo Free Soil Party convention in 1848, and served on its committee on resolutions, as well as standing as a candidate for the U.S. Congress on the Free Soil ticket in New Jersey. When the Free Soil party merged with the Republican Party, he joined with it on its anti-slavery platform. In 1856, he was an unsuccessful candidate for the New York State Assembly.
In 1859, he was a member of the New York State Assembly (New York Co., 14th D.), and was a member of the Committee on Banks and chairman of the Committee on Insurance. He was also a delegate to the 1860 Republican National Convention, where he played a role in the nomination of Abraham Lincoln. With John Adams Dix and Richard Milford Blatchford, he formed the Union Defense Committee, empowered by President Abraham Lincoln to spend public money during the initial raising and equipping of the Union Army.

In 1861, he was elected to a two-year term as mayor of New York City over incumbent mayor Fernando Wood of the Mozart Hall faction of the Democracy and William Frederick Havemeyer of the Tammany Hall wing. As mayor, Opdyke recruited and equipped troops for the war and responded to draft riots of July 1863. His term in office ended in 1863, and he was succeeded by Democrat Charles Godfrey Gunther, who had also been Opdyke&#x27;s opponent in 1861.

==Personal life==

Opdyke was married to Elizabeth Hall Stryker (1805–1891), a daughter of Peter Stryker and Kezia (née Davis) Stryker. Together, they were the parents of:

* Mary Elizabeth Opdyke (1834–1907), who married George W. Farlee.
* William Stryker Opdyke (1836–1922), who married Margaret Elizabeth Post (1834–1911) in 1863.
* Charles Wilson Opdyke (1838–1907), who married Jane Wandling Creveling (1843–1871).
* Henry Beach Opdyke (1841–1919), who married Marian Blagden Whiton (1848–1903).
* Samuel T. Opdyke (1846–1851), who died young.

Opdyke died at his home, 1 East 47th Street in New York City on June 12, 1880. He was buried in the Mount Pleasant Cemetery in Newark, New Jersey.

===Descendants===
Through his daughter Mary, he was a grandfather of Lilian Gray Farlee (1859–1894), who married Dr. Charles Loomis Dana, a physician, professor of nervous and mental disease at Cornell Medical College, in 1882.

<doc id="740501" wikidata="Q409747" url="?curid=740501" title="Elastin">
<text>Elastin is a protein encoded by the &quot;ELN&quot; gene in humans and several other animals. Elastin is a key component in the extracellular matrix of gnathostomes (jawed vertebrates). It is highly elastic and present in connective tissue of the body to resume its shape after stretching or contracting. Elastin helps skin return to its original position whence poked or pinched. Elastin is also in important load-bearing tissue of vertebrates and used in places where storage of mechanical energy is required.

== Function ==

The &quot;ELN&quot; gene encodes a protein that is one of the two components of elastic fibers. The encoded protein is rich in hydrophobic amino acids such as glycine and proline, which form mobile hydrophobic regions bounded by crosslinks between lysine residues. Multiple transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been found for this gene. Elastin&#x27;s soluble precursor is tropoelastin. 

=== Mechanism of elastic recoil ===
The characterization of disorder is consistent with an entropy-driven mechanism of elastic recoil. It is concluded that conformational disorder is a constitutive feature of elastin structure and function.

== Clinical significance ==
Deletions and mutations in this gene are associated with supravalvular aortic stenosis (SVAS) and the autosomal dominant cutis laxa. Other associated defects in elastin include Marfan syndrome, emphysema caused by α1-antitrypsin deficiency, atherosclerosis, Buschke–Ollendorff syndrome, Menkes syndrome, pseudoxanthoma elasticum, and Williams syndrome.

===Elastosis===
&quot;Elastosis&quot; is the buildup of elastin in tissues, and is a form of degenerative disease. There are a multitude of causes, but the most commons cause is actinic elastosis of the skin, also known as &quot;solar elastosis&quot;, which is caused by prolonged and excessive sun exposure, a process known as photoaging. Uncommon causes of skin elastosis include elastosis perforans serpiginosa, perforating calcific elastosis and linear focal elastosis.

== Composition ==

In the body, elastin is usually associated with other proteins in connective tissues. Elastic fiber in the body is a mixture of amorphous elastin and fibrous fibrillin. Both components are primarily made of smaller amino acids such as glycine, valine, alanine, and proline. The total elastin ranges from 58 to 75% of the weight of the dry defatted artery in normal canine arteries. Comparison between fresh and digested tissues shows that, at 35% strain, a minimum of 48% of the arterial load is carried by elastin, and a minimum of 43% of the change in stiffness of arterial tissue is due to the change in elastin stiffness.

=== Tissue distribution ===
Elastin serves an important function in arteries as a medium for pressure wave propagation to help blood flow and is particularly abundant in large elastic blood vessels such as the aorta. Elastin is also very important in the lungs, elastic ligaments, elastic cartilage, the skin, and the bladder. It is present in jawed vertebrates.

== Characteristics ==
Elastin is a very long-lived protein, with a half-life of over 78 years in humans.

==Clinical research==
The feasibility of using recombinant human tropoelastin to enable elastin fiber production to improve skin flexibility in wounds and scarring has been studied. After subcutaneous injections of recombinant human tropoelastin into fresh wounds it was found there was no improvement in scarring or the flexibility of the eventual scarring.

== Biosynthesis ==
=== Tropoelastin precursors ===
Elastin is made by linking together many small soluble precursor tropoelastin protein molecules (50-70 kDa), to make the final massive, insoluble, durable complex. The unlinked tropoelastin molecules are not normally available in the cell, since they become crosslinked into elastin fibres immediately after their synthesis by the cell and export into the extracellular matrix.

Each tropoelastin consists of a string of 36 small domains, each weighing about 2 kDa in a random coil conformation. The protein consists of alternating hydrophobic and hydrophilic domains, which are encoded by separate exons, so that the domain structure of tropoelastin reflects the exon organization of the gene. The hydrophilic domains contain Lys-Ala (KA) and Lys-Pro (KP) motifs that are involved in crosslinking during the formation of mature elastin. In the KA domains, lysine residues occur as pairs or triplets separated by two or three alanine residues (e.g. AAAKAAKAA) whereas in KP domains the lysine residues are separated mainly by proline residues (e.g. KPLKP).

=== Aggregation ===
Tropoelastin aggregates at physiological temperature due to interactions between hydrophobic domains in a process called coacervation. This process is reversible and thermodynamically controlled and does not require protein cleavage. The coacervate is made insoluble by irreversible crosslinking.

=== Crosslinking ===
To make mature elastin fibres, the tropoelastin molecules are cross-linked via their lysine residues with desmosine and isodesmosine cross-linking molecules. The enzyme that performs the crosslinking is lysyl oxidase, using an &quot;in vivo&quot; Chichibabin pyridine synthesis reaction.

== Molecular biology ==

In mammals, the genome only contains one gene for tropoelastin, called &quot;ELN&quot;. The human &quot;ELN&quot; gene is a 45 kb segment on chromosome 7, and has 34 exons interrupted by almost 700 introns, with the first exon being a signal peptide assigning its extracellular localization. The large number of introns suggests that genetic recombination may contribute to the instability of the gene, leading to diseases such as SVAS. The expression of tropoelastin mRNA is highly regulated under at least eight different transcription start sites.

Tissue specific variants of elastin are produced by alternative splicing of the tropoelastin gene. There are at least 11 known human tropoelastin isoforms. These isoforms are under developmental regulation, however there are minimal differences among tissues at the same developmental stage.

<doc id="740533" wikidata="Q772978" url="?curid=740533" title="Gambrinus">
<text>Gambrinus ( ) is a legendary European culture hero celebrated as an icon of beer, brewing, joviality, and &quot;joie de vivre&quot;. Typical representations in the visual arts depict him as a rotund, bearded duke or king, holding a tankard or mug, and sometimes with a keg nearby.

Though sometimes erroneously called a patron saint, Gambrinus is neither a saint nor a tutelary deity. It is possible his persona was conflated with traditional medieval saints associated with beermaking, like Saint Arnold of Soissons. In one legendary tradition, he is beer&#x27;s inventor or envoy. Although legend attributes to him no special powers to bless brews or to make crops grow, tellers of old tall tales are happy to adapt them to fit Gambrinus. Gambrinus stories use folklore motifs common to European folktales, such as the trial by ordeal. Some imagine Gambrinus as a man who has an enormous capacity for drinking beer.

Personages theorised as the basis for the Gambrinus character include the legendary ancient Germanic king Gambrivius (or Gampar) son of Mers (Marsus), John the Fearless of Burgundy (1371–1419) and John I, Duke of Brabant ( 1252–1294).

== Origin of Gambrinus ==
The source of the legend of Gambrinus is uncertain. An early written account, by German historian Johannes Aventinus (1477–1534), identifies Gambrinus with Gambrivius, a mythical Germanic king about whom little is known. Two other men purported to have inspired the creation of Gambrinus are John I, Duke of Brabant, and John the Fearless, Duke of Burgundy.

=== Gambrivius or Gampar ===
In his magnum opus &quot;Annals of Bavaria&quot;, German historian Johannes Aventinus wrote that Gambrinus is based on a mythical Germanic king called Gambrivius, or Gampar, who, Aventinus says, learned brewing from Osiris and Isis. In 1517, William IV, Duke of Bavaria had made Aventinus the official historiographer of his dukedom. Aventinus finished composing the history in 1523; the work that he compiled, &quot;Annals of Bavaria&quot;, extends beyond Bavaria, drawing on numerous ancient and medieval sources. However, it is also a work that blends history with myth and legend.
European anecdote credits Gambrinus with the invention of beer. Aventinus attempted to reconcile this account with much older stories attributing its origin to Osiris&#x27; agricultural teachings. In Aventinus&#x27; chronicle, Gambrivius was the paramour of Osiris&#x27; wife and sister, Isis. It was by this association, he says, that Gambrivius learned the science of brewing (cf. myths of the theft of fire).

Aventinus&#x27; account of Gambrivius contributed to the reverence for Osiris and Isis held by 17th-century European scholars. Perceiving Osiris and Isis as &quot;culture bearers&quot; enabled a willingness to see historical connections where there were none.

The 59th stanza of the English drinking ode &quot;The Ex-ale-tation of Ale&quot;, written by Peter Mews, evidences a British appropriation of the myth:
According to Aventinus, Gambrivius is a seventh-generation descendant of the Biblical patriarch Noah. By incorporating earlier myths recorded by Tacitus, Aventinus reckoned that Gambrivius was the fifth son of Marso (Latin: Marsus), who was the great-grandson of Tuisto, the giant or godly ancestor of the Germanic peoples whom Tacitus mentions in &quot;Germania&quot;. Tacitus alludes to an earlier source (Strabo) who lists tribes called the &quot;Gambrivii&quot; and the &quot;Marsi&quot; among the peoples descended from Tuisto: the offspring or subjects of Gambrivius and Marsus, respectively.

Gampar claims new lands east of the Rhine, including Flanders and Brabant, and founds the towns of Cambrai and Hamburg. The names of both these towns were theorized to be cognates of &quot;Gambrivius&quot;, as one of Hamburg&#x27;s ancient Latin names was alleged to be &quot;Gambrivium&quot;.

One of Aventinus&#x27; sources was &quot;Officina&quot; (1503), an encyclopedia compiled by French scholar Jean Tixier de Ravisi. This work purported that Tuisto and Gambrivius were giants descended from Noah. But Jean Tixier had only catalogued and reported a conjecture made in the name of the Hellenistic-era historian Berossus, by the fraudster Annio da Viterbo (1498), who had previously used the same hypothesis to postulate an ancestry for the Gauls.

Some Francophone and Germanophone scholars reject the others&#x27; claim to Gambrinus as an appropriation of one of their own cultural heroes. Aventinus&#x27; account did not just establish a claim to Gambrivius, but to a glorious ancestry and heritage. The myths also reimagined Gambrivius as a catalyst for the enlargement of the territory of a Germanic people (the Gambrivii), and made him a divine conduit into Germania for the Egyptians&#x27; ancient beer lore.

In 1543, Hans Guldenmundt published a series of 12 broadside prints of &quot;ancestors and early kings of the Germans&quot;. The series includes Tuiscon (Tuisto) and Gambrivius, Charlemagne, and other kings historical and mythological. The heading for Gambrivius translates as &quot;Gampar, King of Brabant and Flanders&quot;. Aventinus&#x27; contemporary Burkard Waldis (c. 1490–1556) wrote a descriptive verse for each of the 12 kings in the series. The verses for Gampar and Tuiscon recapitulate what Aventinus recorded in &quot;Annals of Bavaria&quot;.

=== John I, Duke of Brabant ===


One of the persons theorised to be the basis for the Gambrinus character is John I (c. 1252–1294) of the Duchy of Brabant, which was a wealthy, beer-producing jurisdiction that encompassed Brussels among other cities. The brewers&#x27; guild in Brussels may have made the Duke an honorary member and hung his portrait in their meeting hall.

In his 1874 monograph on Gambrinus, the Belgian political activist and historian Victor Coremans reported that references to Brabant and Flanders in Gambrinus legends seemed to be relatively recent. However, he also reports a similarity between the likeness of John I on his tomb and the faces in some illustrations of Gambrinus. John&#x27;s name, too, has a hypothetical connection to Gambrinus: In Dutch he was sometimes known as &quot;Jan Primus&quot;, and in French as &quot;Jean Primus&quot;. &quot;Jan&quot; and &quot;Jean&quot; are renderings of &quot;John&quot; in Dutch and French, respectively, and &quot;Primus&quot; is Latin for &quot;the first&quot;. The name &quot;Gambrinus&quot; might be a corruption of one of these names. Dutch and French were principal languages in the County of Flanders and the Duchy of Brabant, and Latin was a language used by scholars and learned people.

=== John the Fearless ===

Another presumptive Gambrinus, John the Fearless (1371–1419), was the Duke of Burgundy born nearly 80 years after the death of John I of Brabant. The large and powerful Duchy of Burgundy also produced beer, and was found to the southwest of Brabant.

John the Fearless held several titles of nobility, one of which was Count of Flanders—a title he inherited in 1405. He is credited with introducing, or legalising, hops within the County of Flanders. Before they switched to hops, the Flemish, like many other Europeans, brewed beer with an herbal medley called gruit.

The transition from gruit to hops throughout Europe in the Middle Ages was a piecemeal, region-by-region process that lasted at least 500 years. It took time for farmers to learn of the existence of hops, how to farm them, when to cultivate them, and their value in brewing beer. Brewers had to learn the favourable and unfavourable characteristics of hops, and how to use hops to craft commercially successful beer. Even in the Middle Ages beer was an international commodity, and major brewing cities developed distinctive styles and reputations. Brewers had to consider the marketability of their beer, and competition from imports. Furthermore, regulations limited brewing ingredients in some jurisdictions. Even when a monarch permitted hop brewing, the hops might be taxed. What steps John took to institute hops in Flemish brewing is not documented, but he lived during a time when hops were being legalised in nearby jurisdictions. He was age 20 or 21 in 1392, when Duke Albert I granted the Dutch cities of Haarlem and Gouda permission to brew beer with hops.

Sometime after John inherited rule of the County of Flanders in 1405, he is said to have instituted an order of merit called the Order of the Hop (Latin: &quot;Ōrdō lupuli&quot;). According to Jean-Jacques Chifflet (1588–1660), John awarded the honour to curry the favour of his subjects in the County of Flanders. Recipients of the order drank beer in celebration.

John of Burgundy has another connection to beer, and possibly to the etymology of &quot;Gambrinus&quot;: In 1385, he was married in Cambrai, a powerful city (in modern-day north of France) whose beer was highly regarded. Allegedly, one of Cambrai&#x27;s Latin names was &quot;Gambrivium&quot;—but then, the same is also said of the city of Hamburg.

The Medieval Latin noun &quot;camba&quot; means &quot;brewery&quot;; this word was corrupted to &quot;cambe&quot; in Old French, and may have yielded the vernacular French noun &quot;cam&quot;, a word used by farmhouse brewers in Northern France and the Low Countries for the yoke that supports a brew kettle over a fire.

== 19th-century stories about Gambrinus ==

=== Short stories by Charles Deulin ===
For his 1868 anthology &quot;Contes d&#x27;un buveur de bière&quot; (English: &quot;Tales of a Beer Drinker&quot;), French author Charles Deulin wrote a playful short story called &quot;Cambrinus, Roi de la Bière&quot; (&quot;Cambrinus, King of Beer&quot;), in which &quot;Cambrinus&quot; makes a deal with the Devil. Deulin was also a journalist, and drama critic who adapted elements of European folklore into his work. The success of &quot;Cambrinus, Roi de la Bière&quot; led to the 1874 publication of &quot;Contes du roi Cambrinus&quot; (&quot;Tales of King Cambrinus&quot;), a collection of short stories devoted to the character.

==== &quot;Cambrinus, Roi de la Bière&quot; ====
In this, the seminal Cambrinus short story, Cambrinus is an apprentice glassblower in the Flemish village of Fresnes-sur-Escaut, but he believes that he lacks the skill and upward mobility to succeed in glassblowing. He becomes smitten with the master glassblower&#x27;s daughter, Flandrine. After she rebuffs him, he apprentices himself instead to a viol master, and learns the instrument. His first public performance goes excellently until he catches sight of Flandrine, and flubs his performance. The crowd turns on him violently, but when the case goes to trial the judge, Jocko, is against Cambrinus. When Cambrinus is released he considers suicide, but Beelzebub intervenes in exchange for the promise of his soul. Beelzebub announces, too, that he has killed the judge.

With diabolical help, Cambrinus wins a fortune in games of skill and chance, becomes an irresistible player of the carillon, and becomes the first mortal to brew beer. Cambrinus&#x27; music and beer make him very famous, and eventually the king of the Netherlands heaps titles of nobility on him: Duke of Brabant, Count of Flanders, Lord of Fresnes. But even after founding the town of Cambrai, Cambrinus prefers the villagers&#x27; honorary title for him: King of Beer. When Flandrine finally approaches him, he rejects her.

After 30 years, Beelzebub sends Jocko the judge for Cambrinus&#x27; soul, but Cambrinus thwarts Jocko by getting him drunk on beer, and thrives for nearly a hundred years more. When Cambrinus finally dies, Beelzebub himself comes for his soul, only to find that Cambrinus&#x27; body has become a beer barrel.

=== Gambrinus, King of Lager Beer ===
Some years after Deulin published &quot;Contes d’un buveur de bière&quot;, American playwright and blackface minstrel Frank Dumont wrote a loose variation on the story &quot;Cambrinus, Roi de la Bière&quot;. In this musical burlesque, titled &quot;Gambrinus, King of Lager Beer&quot;, Gambrinus is a poor woodcutter to whom gives a recipe for an excellent lager beer. In Dumont&#x27;s version, Gambrinus is joyfully reunited with his love, only to be taken from her by Belzebub.

The play was first produced in the US town of Jackson, Michigan on 21 July 1875, by a blackface troupe called Duprez and Benedict&#x27;s Minstrels.

=== May Day legend ===
In a very brief magazine piece, Deulin told a legend (possibly his own invention) in which Gambrinus and a host of ancient French (or, alternately, Franconian) kings gather each May Day for a midnight feast at a &quot;Devil&#x27;s table&quot; () near Grafenberg, Germany.

== Brands ==
Because of Gambrinus&#x27; significance, breweries, pubs, restaurants, shops, and malt houses have appropriated the character or his name for their brands.

První akciový pivovar in Plzeň, Czech Republic, has been brewing a pale lager with the name Gambrinus since 1918. In 1932 the brewery merged with Pilsner Urquell Brewery.

In Spain, the brewery Cruzcampo, now a subsidiary of Heineken International, premiered a Gambrinus-derived advertising mascot in 1902, and has kept it since. The character was designed by Leonetto Cappiello. Between 1997 and 2009, Cruzcampo opened more than 250 Gambrinus pubs throughout Spain—starting with one in the Basque Country.

Cerveza Victoria was the first beer commercially brewed in Mexico. Its brewer, Santiago Graf, started his brewery in Toluca during the 1880s. He eventually attracted some German investors, and incorporated the Brewery Company of Toluca and Mexico (&quot;Compañía Cervecera de Toluca y México&quot;) in 1890. In 1907, the company changed the Victoria logo to an illustration of King Gambrinus. Grupo Modelo bought the company in 1935, and has branded Victoria beer with at least two different Gambrinus logos. Today, Cerveza Victoria is marketed as a &quot;Vienna-style&quot; dark lager, and is distributed multinationally.

In Brazil, in the city of Porto Alegre, the oldest bar in the city, founded in 1889, is named in honor of the legendary king and patron of beer

&quot;King Gambrinus, Legendary Patron of Brewing&quot; (1967), a statue commissioned by the Pabst Brewing Company in the United States, has been a point of interest in the city of Milwaukee for many years. The statue now on display is the third version created since 1857. It was taken down in the late 1990s when Pabst moved to another city, but was repatriated to Milwaukee in 2011, on loan.

Cantillon of Brussels brews a highly rated framboise lambic called &quot;Rosé de Gambrinus&quot;.

Battin of Luxembourg uses the character of Gambrinus as its logo and gives his name to its main brew.
