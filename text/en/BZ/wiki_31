<text>F. Andrieu (; possibly François or Franciscus Andrieu) was a French composer in the style of late medieval music. Nothing is known for certain about him except that he wrote &quot;Armes, amours/O flour des flours&quot; (&quot;Weapons, loves/O flower of flowers&quot;), a double ballade &quot;déploration&quot;, for the death of Guillaume de Machaut in 1377. The work has been widely praised and analyzed; it is notable for being one of two extant medieval double ballades for four voices, the only known contemporary musical setting of Eustache Deschamps and the earliest representative of the longstanding medieval and Renaissance lamentation tradition between composers. 

Andrieu may be the same person as Magister Franciscus, although the scholarly consensus on this identification is unclear. With P. des Molins, Jehan Vaillant and Grimace, Andrieu was one of the &quot;post-Machaut&quot; generation whose pieces retain enough qualities to be differentiated from composers of .
==Identity and career==
Nothing is known for certain about Andrieu except his authorship of the double ballade for four voices: &quot;Armes, amours/O flour des flours&quot; (&quot;Weapons, loves/O flower of flowers&quot;), a &quot;déploration&quot; for the death of poet-composer Guillaume de Machaut (–1377), the most significant European composer of the 14th century. The work is adapted from two texts by a student of Machaut, the poet Eustache Deschamps, making Andrieu&#x27;s work the only surviving contemporary musical settings of over 1,500 lyrics by Deschamps. Musicologist Gilbert Reaney notes that this would mean that, from what is known about Andrieu, he is a &quot;pure musician&quot;. The work is contained in the Chantilly Codex from the Musée Condé. While historian Gaston Raynaud dates the text between April and 28 May 1377, Andrieu may have set it to music anytime from then up until 15 years later (the Chantilly Codex was likely assembled sometime during 1393 to 1395).

Andrieu&#x27;s association with Machaut&#x27;s death in 1377 suggests he was French and flourished in the late 14th century. The &quot;F.&quot; most likely stands for either &quot;François&quot; or &quot;Franciscus&quot;. References to &quot;F. Andrieu&quot; outside of the Chantilly Codex are absent from other manuscript sources, leading to speculation that he is the composer Magister Franciscus, who wrote two ballades also present in the Chantilly Codex: &quot;De Narcissus&quot; and &quot;Phiton, Phiton, beste tres venimeuse&quot;. The scholarly consensus on the certainty of this identification is unclear. Reaney notes that Magister Franciscus&#x27;s works are likely earlier than Andrieu&#x27;s, between 1370 and 1376. Musicologist Guillaume de Van proposed that the Chantilly Codex was created for use in music schools; because of this, stylistic similarities to Machaut, and the lack of additional records on Andrieu, musicologist Robert Magnan suggested Andrieu was a student or teacher, utilizing Machaut&#x27;s style to honor his master.

==Music==
===Overview===

Andrieu&#x27;s only surviving work is the double ballade &quot;déploration&quot; for four voices: &quot;Armes, amours/O flour des flours&quot;, although Reaney notes that &quot;this work alone, however, makes him of considerable interest&quot;. Written for Machaut&#x27;s death, Andrieu&#x27;s style is understandably similar to his, with musicologist Gustave Reese noting that the work shows the &quot;vigorous survival&quot; of Machaut&#x27;s influence. Andrieu&#x27;s work is one of two extant four-part double ballades of medieval music, the other being &quot;Quant Theseus/Ne quier veoir&quot; (B 34) by Machaut. A polyphonic double ballade is a fitting homage for Machaut, since he is credited as the genre&#x27;s originator. As a double ballade, &quot;Armes, amours/O flour des flours&quot; has two texts sung simultaneously between the cantus voices, Cantus I beginning with &quot;Armes, amours&quot; and Cantus II with &quot;O flour des flours&quot;. The work&#x27;s four part division—two cantus (with text), contratenor, and tenor (without text)—was an older style and atypical of the usual three part—cantus (with text), contratenor and tenor (without text)—structure that dominated the 14th-century ballade repertory. Andrieu&#x27;s decision for more traditional vocal parts may be a reflection of Deschamps&#x27;s text, which is written in a &quot;classicized high poetic style&quot;.

It is also the earliest surviving &quot;déploration&quot; for a fellow composer; the tradition was popular in medieval and Renaissance music. Later examples included Johannes Ockeghem&#x27;s &quot;Mort, tu as navré de ton dart&quot; (1460) for Gilles Binchois; Josquin des Prez&#x27;s &quot;Nymphes des bois&quot; (1497) for Ockeghem; and William Byrd&#x27;s &quot;Ye Sacred Muses&quot; (1585) for Thomas Tallis. While the Chantilly Codex is a primary source of music, with P. des Molins, Jehan Vaillant and Grimace, Andrieu is part of the &quot;post-Machaut&quot; generation whose pieces retain enough qualities to be differentiated from those of the rhythmically-complex composers such as Johannes Cuvelier and Johannes Susay.

Musicologist Eric Rice identifies two common characteristics in the text of typical &quot;déplorations&quot;: the &quot;planctus&quot; (from ) and the &quot;discourse&quot;. The &quot;planctus&quot; refers to an involuntary sudden outburst of emotion, while the &quot;discourse&quot; is a calmer and clearer expression of grief. Deschamps&#x27;s text contains both recurring and nonrecurring &quot;planctus&quot; exclamations. , from the second strophe, is a &quot;planctus&quot; exclamation that is nonrecurring; Rice considers this a &quot;stereotyped exclamation of grief&quot;.

===Refrain===

The text of Deschamps&#x27;s two ballades share a refrain: &quot;La mort Machaut, le noble retorique&quot;. Musicologist Elizabeth Randell Upton notes that the &quot;shared refrain receives the most striking coordination of the ballades&#x27; voices&quot;. Rice considers the refrain a reoccurring &quot;planctus&quot; since it appears at the end of each strophe; ballades were typically in aabC form – where C is always the same. Andrieu signifies the &quot;planctus&quot; by setting the words &quot;La mort&quot; and &quot;Machaut&quot; in long notes but followed by rests. By inserting rests, Andrieu disrupts the music and signifies the sudden outburst of emotion that characterizes a &quot;planctus&quot;. The practice of using &quot;planctus&quot; during the refrain was abandoned by future composers who used more formal structures such as the cantus firmus.

Andrieu&#x27;s musical setting of the refrain also highlights the name of the dedicatee (Machaut), by giving all four voices the same rhythm for the first four syllables (&quot;La mort Machaut&quot;). Such an effect gives the phrase a &quot;striking and singular four-voice effect&quot;. The following bars give the lower voices subsidiary supporting roles, sustaining the dominance of the texted upper voices. This is assisted by the refrain&#x27;s repetition, which naturally emphasizes Machaut&#x27;s name. The designation of &quot;le noble retorique&quot; (&quot;the noble rhetorician&quot;) is invented by Deschamps in order to give Machaut a formal title.

===Similarities to other works===

The Chantilly Codex contains six works – four ballades and two motets – that include their dedicatee&#x27;s name directly. The dedicatee&#x27;s proper name is mentioned in all four of these ballades, making them the only ballades of the 14th-century to do so. Two of these – &quot;Armes, amours/O flour des flours&quot; and Jacob Senleches&#x27;s &quot;Fuions de ci, fuions povre campaigne&quot; for Eleanor of Aragon, Queen of Castile – lament their subject&#x27;s death. Both works have the word &quot;retorique&quot; embellished by a melisma on the &quot;ri&quot; for six double whole notes. While Senleches includes himself as part of larger group of mourners, Deschamps names himself directly in the third stanza by stating &quot;Ce vous requiert le bayli de Valois&quot; (&quot;This asks of you the Baliff of Valois&quot;). Nevertheless, Deschamps also includes an invitation to a large group of mourners:

Musicologist Elizabeth Eva Leach notes that the &quot;Armes, amours/O flour des flours&quot; has both textual and musical similarities to Machaut&#x27;s poetry and music respectively. In the refrain, Andrieu&#x27;s work imitates a passage from the Gloria of Machaut&#x27;s &quot;Messe de Nostre Dame&quot;. It also shows a resemblance to Machaut&#x27;s ballade &quot;De Fortune&quot; (B23); both works have &quot;the same tonal emphases&quot; and &quot;similar tenor notes at key structure points&quot;. &quot;Armes, amours/O flour des flours&quot; shares a musical theme with the anonymous ballade &quot;Dame qui fust&quot;, in the , which itself is based on Machaut&#x27;s &quot;De Fortune me doy pleindre&quot; (B 23). In Andrieu&#x27;s work, the shared theme appears when the two cantus voices engage in musical imitation, something which was uncommon at the time.

===Interpretation===
Leach notes that the work has been &quot;widely discussed by literary and musical scholars alike&quot;. According to Leach, the existence of this &quot;déploration&quot; suggests there was &quot;interest in [Machaut&#x27;s] own posterity... in the short term at least&quot;. Some scholars say this remembrance of Machaut mainly concerned his poetry and suggest that Deschamps did not intend &quot;Armes, amours/O flour des flours&quot; to be set to music. Magnan argues that Deschamps recognized termed &quot;musique artificiele&quot; (vocal and instrument performance) and &quot;musique naturele&quot; (poetry alone) as equally enjoyable. Furthermore, the fact that no other of Deschamps&#x27;s poems have survived with music indicate that this one would not be any different. Leach disagrees, saying that it being the earliest known musical lamentation for a fellow composer recognizes his &quot;poet-composer&quot; status, as do the words &quot;faysaur&quot; (maker) and &quot;retorique&quot; (rhetorician). The work calls on &quot;those who hold dear the sweet art of music&quot; to mourn Machaut&#x27;s death, suggesting his musical importance.

According to Leach, the line &quot;Your name will be a precious relic&quot; is contradictory to the traditional Platonism of the time: it dismisses the Platonic idea that a name is only a representation of someone, by suggesting Machaut&#x27;s name alone is a &quot;relic&quot; and all encompassing to his being.

<text>The Salt Lake City Union Pacific Depot is a building on the western edge of downtown Salt Lake City, Utah, United States. Built in 1908–09, it dates back to the more prosperous era in the history of American railroad travel. As Salt Lake Union Pacific Railroad Station, it is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. In 2024 it was repurposed as a hotel, Asher Adams, Autograph Collection, with the historic structure containing the hotel&#x27;s lobby, restaurants, function rooms, and 13 luxury suites and a new building behind it containing 225 hotel rooms.

==History==
Originally called the Union Station, it was jointly constructed by the San Pedro, Los Angeles and Salt Lake Railroad and the Oregon Short Line, both later wholly owned by the Union Pacific, at an estimated cost of $450,000 ($ in dollars). The platforms behind the station ran north-to-south, parallel to the first main line built in the Salt Lake Valley, which predated the station building. South of 1300 South this is the route used by the UTA TRAX Blue Line and Salt Lake City Southern, while north of North Temple (100 North) it is used by the &quot;FrontRunner&quot; line and Union Pacific. Trains from the west used a line south of 900 South in Glendale to approach the north-to-south platforms. The Bamberger Railroad &amp; Salt Lake and Utah Railroad Interurban lines also stopped at their own station nearby. When Amtrak was formed in 1971, it took over the remaining passenger services at the station, but after Rio Grande joined Amtrak all trains were moved to its station three blocks south.

===Amtrak===
From 1977 to 1986 the depot served as Salt Lake City&#x27;s Amtrak station, but was then replaced by the Denver and Rio Grande Western Depot. It was served by the &quot;Desert Wind&quot;, and &quot;Pioneer&quot; trains, both of which were discontinued in 1997; until its route was reconfigured in 1983, this station served as the &quot;Pioneer&quot;&#x27;s terminus. The &quot;Desert Wind&quot; ran daily from Chicago to Los Angeles and the &quot;Pioneer&quot; ran daily Chicago to Seattle. In 1999 Amtrak moved to the Salt Lake City Intermodal Hub.

===Current===
The main lobby, no longer used by Amtrak (which has relocated to the Rio Grande Depot and later the Salt Lake City Intermodal Hub), serves as an entrance to The Gateway development. Most of the building is not used for its original purpose, but Union Pacific uses some of the space for offices and training areas.

In January 2006, three floors opened as a restaurant and music venue, known as The Depot.

In 2024 it was repurposed as a hotel, Asher Adams, Autograph Collection, with the historic structure containing the hotel&#x27;s lobby, restaurants, function rooms, and 13 luxury suites and a new building behind it containing 225 hotel rooms. The hotel is after cartographers John R. Asher and George H. Adams, who were the first to depict railroad routes.

==Architecture==
According to &quot;The Railway Gazette&quot; (1907) the structure&#x27;s plans came from the office of J.H. Wallace, Assistant Chief Engineer of the Southern Pacific, under the direction of D.J. Patterson, Architect for that company. It served the San Pedro, Los Angeles and Salt Lake and the Oregon Short Line when it was completed in 1909 and became wholly owned by Union Pacific in the 1920s. Initially, both railroads&#x27; initials were prominently displayed on the front of the building, but the &quot;Union Pacific&quot; shield or related logo has graced the depot for most of its history.

The sandstone building is in French Second Empire style, and includes a terrazzo floor and stained glass windows. One ceiling mural “Driving The Golden Spike” by San Francisco artist John MacQuarrie in 1909, depicts the driving of the Golden Spike north of Salt Lake City at &quot;Promontory Summit&quot; signifying the completion of the first transcontinental railroad in 1869. Another mural, “Emigrants Entering Salt Lake Valley,” by San Francisco artists John MacQuarrie &amp; August C. Wocker in 1909, shows the 1847 arrival of Mormon pioneers to what is now Salt Lake City.

Several side rooms were originally used for separate male and female waiting areas. The depot once housed an emergency hospital, lunch room, baggage rooms, and offices for both of the original railroads. Most of these features are gone now, but the building was extensively renovated in the 1970s to repair damage. Additionally, the original slate roof was replaced by copper plates due to leaking problems.

<text>Chanel ( , ) is a French luxury fashion house founded in 1910 by Coco Chanel in Paris. It is privately owned by French brothers, Alain and Gérard Wertheimer, through the holding company Chanel Limited, established in 2018 and headquartered in London.

Chanel specializes in women&#x27;s ready-to-wear, luxury goods, and accessories and licenses its name and branding to Luxottica for eyewear. Chanel is well known for its No. 5 perfume and &quot;Chanel Suit&quot;. Chanel is credited for revolutionizing &quot;haute couture&quot; and ready-to-wear by replacing structured, corseted silhouettes with more functional garments that women still found flattering.

==History==

===Coco Chanel era ===
;Establishment and recognition (1909–1920s)

The House of Chanel originated in 1909, when Gabrielle Chanel opened a millinery shop at 160 Boulevard Malesherbes, the ground floor of the Parisian flat of the socialite and textile businessman Étienne Balsan, of whom she was the mistress. Because the Balsan flat also was a salon for the French hunting and sporting élite, Chanel had the opportunity to meet their &quot;demi-mondaine&quot; mistresses who, as such, were women of fashion, upon whom the rich men displayed their wealth – as ornate clothes, jewellery, and hats.

Coco Chanel thus could sell to them the hats she designed and made; she thus earned a living independent of Balsan. In the course of those salons, Coco Chanel befriended Arthur &quot;Boy&quot; Capel, an English socialite and polo player friend of Étienne Balsan; per the upper class social custom, Chanel also became mistress to Boy Capel. In 1910, Boy Capel financed her first independent millinery shop, &quot;Chanel Modes&quot;, at 21 Rue Cambon in Paris. Because that locale already housed a dress shop, the business-lease limited Chanel to selling only millinery products, not &quot;couture&quot;. Two years later 1913, the Deauville and Biarritz &quot;couture&quot; shops of Coco Chanel offered for sale &quot;prêt-à-porter&quot; sports clothes for women, the practical designs of which allowed the wearer to play sports.

The First World War (1914–1918), affected European fashion through scarcity of materials, and the mobilisation of women. By that time, Chanel had opened a large dress shop at 31 Rue Cambon, near the Hôtel Ritz, in Paris. Among the clothes for sale were flannel blazers, straight-line skirts of linen, sailor blouses, long sweaters made of jersey fabric, and skirt-and-jacket suits.

Coco Chanel used jersey cloth because of its physical properties as a garment, such as its drape – how it falls upon and falls from the body of the woman – and how well it adapted to a simple garment-design. Sartorially, some of Chanel&#x27;s designs derived from the military uniforms made prevalent by the War; and, by 1915, the designs and the clothes produced by the House of Chanel were known throughout France. In 1915, Chanel opened her very first Couture House in Biarritz, France. She had 300 employees and even designed her first line of Haute Couture.

In 1915 and in 1917, &quot;Harper&#x27;s Bazaar&quot; magazine reported that the garments of La Maison Chanel were &quot;on the list of every buyer&quot; for the clothing factories of Europe. The Chanel dress shop at 31 Rue Cambon presented day-wear dress-and-coat ensembles of simple design, and black evening dresses trimmed with lace; and tulle-fabric dresses decorated with jet, a minor gemstone material.

After the First World War, La Maison Chanel, following the fashion trends of the 1920s, produced beaded dresses made popular by Flapper women. The simple-line, &#x27;flat-chested&#x27; fashions Chanel &quot;couture&quot; made popular were opposite of the hourglass figure fashions of the late 19th century – the Belle Époque of France (–1914), and the British Edwardian era (–1919). Chanel used colors traditionally associated with masculinity in Europe, such as grey and navy blue, to denote feminine boldness. Chanel clothing often featured quilted fabric and leather trimmings; the quilted construction reinforced the fabric, design, and finish, allowing the garment to maintain its form and function while worn. An example is the woolen Chanel suit – a knee-length skirt and a cardigan-style jacket, trimmed and decorated with black embroidery and gold-coloured buttons, often accessorized with two-tone pump shoes, a necklace of pearls, and a leather handbag.

In 1921, to complement Chanel&#x27;s clothing lines, Coco Chanel commissioned perfumer Ernest Beaux to create a perfume for La Maison Chanel. His perfumes included the perfume No.5, named after the number of the sample Chanel liked best. Originally, given as a gift to clients, No.5&#x27;s popularity prompted La Maison Chanel to offer it for sale in 1922.

In 1923, to explain the success of her clothes, Coco Chanel told &quot;Harper&#x27;s Bazaar&quot; magazine that design &quot;simplicity is the keynote of all true elegance.&quot;

;Business partners (late 1920s)
The success of the No. 5 encouraged Coco Chanel to expand perfume sales beyond France and Europe and to develop other perfumes – for which she required investment capital, business acumen, and access to the North American market. To that end, the businessman Théophile Bader (founder of Galeries Lafayette) introduced the venture capitalist Pierre Wertheimer to Coco Chanel. Their business deal established the Parfums Chanel company, a &quot;parfumerie&quot; of which Wertheimer owned 70 per cent, Bader owned 20 per cent, and Chanel owned 10 per cent; commercial success of the joint enterprise was assured by the Chanel name, and by the cachet of la &quot;Maison Chanel&quot;, which remained the sole business province of Coco Chanel.

Nonetheless, despite the success of the Chanel couture and &quot;parfumerie&quot;, the personal relations between Coco and her capitalist partner deteriorated, because, Coco said that Pierre Wertheimer was exploiting her talents as a fashion designer and as a businesswoman. Wertheimer reminded Chanel that he had made her a very rich woman; and that his venture capital had funded Chanel&#x27;s productive expansion of the &quot;parfumerie&quot; which created the wealth they enjoyed, all from the success of No. 5 de Chanel.

Nevertheless, unsatisfied, the businesswoman Gabrielle Chanel hired the attorney René de Chambrun to renegotiate the 10-per-cent partnership she entered, in 1924, with the Parfums Chanel company; the lawyer-to-lawyer negotiations failed, and the partnership-percentages remained as established in the original business deal among Wertheimer, Badel, and Chanel.

;War (1930s–1940s)
From the gamine fashions of the 1920s, Coco Chanel progressed to womanly fashions in the 1930s: evening-dress designs were characterised by an elongated feminine style, and summer dresses featured contrasts such as silver eyelets, and shoulder straps decorated with rhinestones – drawing from Renaissance-time fashion stylings. In 1932, Chanel presented an exhibition of jewellery dedicated to the diamond as a fashion accessory; it featured the &quot;Comet&quot; and &quot;Fountain&quot; necklaces of diamonds, which were of such original design, that Chanel S.A. re-presented them in 1993. Moreover, by 1937, the House of Chanel had expanded the range of its clothes to more women and presented &quot;prêt-à-porter&quot; clothes designed and cut for the petite woman. Among fashion designers, only the clothes created by Elsa Schiaparelli could compete with the clothes of Chanel.
During the Second World War (1939–45), Coco Chanel closed shop at Maison Chanel – leaving only jewellery and &quot;parfumerie&quot; for sale – and moved to the Hôtel Ritz Paris, where she lived with her boyfriend, Hans Günther von Dincklage, a Nazi intelligence officer. Upon conquering France in June 1940, the Nazis established a Parisian occupation-headquarters in the Hôtel Meurice, on the Rue de Rivoli, opposite the Louvre Museum, and just around the corner from the fashionable Maison Chanel S.A., at 31 Rue Cambon.

Meanwhile, because of the Nazi occupation&#x27;s official anti-Semitism, Pierre Wertheimer and family, had fled France to the U.S., in mid-1940. Later, in 1941, Coco Chanel attempted to assume business control of Parfums Chanel but was thwarted by an administrative delegation that disallowed her sole disposition of the &quot;parfumerie&quot;. Having foreseen the Nazi occupation policy of the seizure-and-expropriation to Germany of Jewish business and assets in France, Pierre Wertheimer, the majority partner, had earlier, in May 1940, designated Felix Amiot, a Christian French industrialist, as the &quot;Aryan&quot; proxy whose legal control of the Parfums Chanel business proved politically acceptable to the Nazis, who then allowed the perfume company to continue as an operating business.

Occupied France abounded with rumours that Coco Chanel was a Nazi collaborator; her clandestine identity was secret agent 7124 of the Abwehr, code-named &quot;Westminster&quot;. As such, by order of General Walter Schellenberg, of the &quot;Sicherheitsdienst&quot;, Chanel was despatched to London on a mission to communicate to British Prime Minister Winston Churchill the particulars of a &quot;separate peace&quot; plan proposed by &quot;Reichsführer-SS&quot; Heinrich Himmler, who sought to avoid surrendering to the Red Army of the Soviet Russians.

At War&#x27;s end, upon the Allied liberation of France, Chanel was arrested for having collaborated with the Nazis. In September 1944, the Free French Purge Committee, the &quot;épuration&quot;, summoned Chanel for interrogation about her collaborationism, yet, without documentary evidence of or witnesses to her collaboration with the Nazis, and because of Churchill&#x27;s secret intervention in her behalf, the &quot;épuration&quot; released Coco Chanel from arrest as a traitor to France. Despite having been freed by the political grace of Churchill, the strength of the rumours of Chanel&#x27;s Nazi collaboration had made it impossible for her to remain in France; so Coco Chanel and her German lover, Hans Günther von Dincklage, went into an eight-year exile to Switzerland.

In the post–war period, during Coco Chanel&#x27;s Swiss exile from France, Pierre Wertheimer returned to Paris and regained formal administrative control of his family&#x27;s business holdings – including control of Parfums Chanel, the &quot;parfumerie&quot; established with his venture capital, and successful because of the Chanel name.

In Switzerland, the news revived Coco Chanel&#x27;s resentment at having been exploited by her business partner, for only ten per cent of the money. So she established a rival Swiss &quot;parfumerie&quot; to create, produce, and sell &quot;her&quot; &quot;Chanel perfumes&quot;. In turn, Wertheimer, the majority capital stock owner of Parfums Chanel, saw his business interests threatened, and his commercial rights infringed because he did not possess legally exclusive rights to the Chanel name. Nonetheless, Wertheimer avoided a trademark infringement lawsuit against Coco Chanel, lest it damage the commercial reputation and the artistic credibility of &quot;his&quot; Chanel-brand &quot;parfumerie&quot;.

Pierre Wertheimer settled his business and commercial-rights quarrel with Chanel, and, in May 1947, they renegotiated the 1924 contract that had established Parfums Chanel – she was paid $400,000 in cash (wartime profits from the sales of perfume No. 5 de Chanel); assigned a 2.0 per cent running royalty from the sales of No. 5 &quot;parfumerie&quot;; assigned limited commercial rights to sell &quot;her&quot; &quot;Chanel perfumes&quot; in Switzerland; and granted a perpetual monthly stipend that paid all of her expenses. In exchange, Gabrielle Chanel closed her Swiss &quot;parfumerie&quot; enterprise, and sold to Parfums Chanel the full rights to the name &quot;Coco Chanel&quot;.

;Resurgence (1950s–1970s)

In 1953, upon returning to France from Switzerland, Coco Chanel found the fashion business enamoured of the &quot;New Look&quot; (1947), by Christian Dior; the signature shape featured a below-mid-calf-length, full-skirt, a narrow waist, and a large bust (stylistically absent since 1912). As a post–war fashion that used some 20 yards of fabric, the House of Dior couture renounced wartime rationing of fabric for clothes.

In 1947 – after the six-year austerities of the Second World War (1939–45) – the New Look was welcomed by the fashion business of Western Europe because sales of the pretty clothes would revive business and the economy.

To regain the business primacy of the House of Chanel, in the fashion fields of &quot;haute couture&quot;, &quot;prêt-à-porter&quot;, costume jewellery, and &quot;parfumerie&quot;, would be expensive; so Chanel approached Pierre Wertheimer for business advice and capital. Having decided to do business with Coco Chanel, Wertheimer&#x27;s negotiations to fund the resurgence of the House of Chanel, granted him commercial rights to all Chanel-brand products.

In 1953, Chanel collaborated with jeweler Robert Goossens; he was to design jewelry (bijouterie and gemstone) to complement the fashions of the House of Chanel; notably, long-strand necklaces of black pearls and of white pearls, which high contrast softened the severe design of the knitted-wool Chanel Suit (skirt and cardigan jacket).

The House of Chanel also presented leather handbags with either gold-colour chains or metal-and-leather chains, which allowed carrying the handbag from the shoulder or in hand. The quilted-leather handbag was presented to the public in February 1955. In-house, the numeric version of the launching date &quot;Chanel 2.55&quot; for that line of handbags became the internal &quot;appellation&quot; for that model of the quilted-leather handbag.

The firm&#x27;s initial venture into masculine &quot;parfumerie&quot; was an eau de toilette called Pour Monsieur. Chanel and her spring collection received the Fashion Oscar at the 1957 Fashion Awards in Dallas. Pierre Wertheimer bought Bader&#x27;s 20 per cent share of the Parfums Chanel, which increased the Wertheimer percentage to 90 per cent.
Later, in 1965, Pierre&#x27;s son, Jacques Wertheimer, assumed his father&#x27;s management of the &quot;parfumerie&quot;. About the past business relationship, between Pierre Wertheimer and Coco Chanel, the Chanel attorney, Chambrun said that it had been &quot;one based on a businessman&#x27;s passion, despite her misplaced feelings of exploitation . . . [thus] when Pierre returned to Paris, full of pride and excitement [after one of his horses won the 1956 English Derby]. He rushed to Coco, expecting congratulations and praise. But she refused to kiss him. She resented him, you see, all her life.&quot;

Coco Chanel died on 10 January 1971, at the age of 87. She was still designing at the time of her death. For example, in the (1966–1969) period, she designed the air hostess uniforms for Olympic Airways, the designer who followed her was Pierre Cardin. In that time, Olympic Airways was a luxury airline, owned by the transport magnate Aristotle Onassis. After her death, the leadership of the company was handed down to Yvonne Dudel, Jean Cazaubon and Philippe Guibourgé. So far, the bags designed by Chanel are still very popular in the vintage market.

After a period of time, Jacques Wertheimer bought the controlling interest of the House of Chanel. Critics stated that during his leadership, he never paid much attention to the company, as he was more interested in horse breeding. In 1974, the House of Chanel launched Cristalle eau de toilette, which was designed when Coco Chanel was alive. 1978 saw the launch of the first non-couture, prêt-à-porter line and worldwide distribution of accessories.

Alain Wertheimer, son of Jacques Wertheimer, assumed control of Chanel S.A. in 1974. In the U.S., No. 5 de Chanel was not selling well. Alain revamped Chanel No.5 sales by reducing the number of outlets carrying the fragrance from 18,000 to 12,000. He removed the perfume from drugstore shelves and invested millions of dollars in advertisement for Chanel cosmetics. This ensured a greater sense of scarcity and exclusivity for No.5, and sales rocketed back up as demand for the fragrance increased. He used famous people to endorse the perfume – from Marilyn Monroe to Audrey Tautou. Looking for a designer who could bring the label to new heights, he persuaded Karl Lagerfeld to end his contract with fashion house Chloé. Chanel has partnered with friends and ambassadors over the years including notable actors, musicians, and other artists: G-Dragon, Jennie, Angèle, Whitney Peak, Caroline de Maigret, Margaret Qualley, Victoria Song, Wang Yibo, Minji, Go Youn-jung, Lily-Rose Depp, Keira Knightley, Kristen Stewart, Marion Cotillard, Nicole Kidman, and Penélope Cruz.

=== Post-Coco era (1980s–present) ===

In 1981, Chanel launched Antaeus, an &quot;eau de toilette&quot; for men. In 1983 Karl Lagerfeld took over as chief designer for Chanel. Like Chanel, he looked into the past as inspiration for his designs. He incorporated the Chanel fabrics and detailing such as tweed, gold accents, and chains. Lagerfeld retained what was signature for Chanel but also helped bring the brand into the present. In later collections Lagerfeld chose to break away from the ladylike look of Chanel and began to experiment with fabrics and styles. During the 1980s, more than 40 Chanel boutiques opened worldwide. By the end of the 1980s, the boutiques sold goods ranging from US$200-per-ounce perfume, US$225 ballerina slippers to US$11,000 dresses and US$2,000 leather handbags. Chanel cosmetics and fragrances were distributed only by Chanel outlets. Chanel marketer Jean Hoehn explained the firm&#x27;s approach, saying, &quot;We introduce a new fragrance every 10 years, not every three minutes like many competitors. We don&#x27;t confuse the consumer. With Chanel, people know what to expect. And they keep coming back to us, at all ages, as they enter and leave the market.&quot; 1984 saw the launch of a new fragrance in honor of the founder, &quot;Coco&quot;. In 1986, the House of Chanel struck a deal with watchmakers and in 1987, the first Chanel watch debuted. By the end of the decade, Alain moved the offices to New York City.

Maison de Chanel increased the Wertheimer family fortune to US$5 billion. Sales were hurt by the recession of the early 1990s, but Chanel recovered by the mid-1990s with further boutique expansion.

In 1994, Chanel had a net profit equivalent to €67 million on the sale of €570 million in ready-to-wear clothes and was the most profitable French fashion house.

In 1996, Chanel bought gun-makers Holland &amp; Holland, but failed in its attempt to revamp the firm. The swimwear label Eres was also purchased in 1996. Chanel launched the perfumes Allure in 1996 and Allure Homme in 1998. The House of Chanel launched its first skin care line, Précision, in 1999. That same year, Chanel launched a travel collection, and under a license contract with Luxottica, introduced a line of sunglasses and eyeglass frames.

While Wertheimer remained chairman, Françoise Montenay became CEO and President. 2000 saw the launch of the first unisex watch by Chanel, the J12. In 2001, watchmaker Bell &amp; Ross was acquired. The same year, Chanel boutiques offering only selections of accessories were opened in the United States. Chanel launched a small selection of menswear as a part of their runway shows.

In 2002, Chanel launched the Chance perfume and Paraffection, a subsidiary company originally established in 1997 to support artisanal manufacturing, that gathered together Ateliers d&#x27;Art or workshops including Desrues for ornamentation and buttons, Lemarié for feathers, Lesage for embroidery, Massaro for shoemaking and Michel for millinery. A prêt-à-porter collection was designed by Karl Lagerfeld.

In July 2002, a jewelry and watch outlet opened on Madison Avenue. Within months, a shoe/handbag boutique opened next door. Chanel continued to expand in the United States and by December 2002, operated 25 U.S. boutiques.

Chanel introduced Coco Mademoiselle and an &quot;In-Between Wear&quot; in 2003, targeting younger women, opened a second shop on Rue Cambon, opened a boutique in Central, Hong Kong, and paid nearly US$50 million for a building in Ginza, Tokyo.

In 2007, Maureen Chiquet was appointed CEO. She remained CEO until her termination in 2016.

In 2018, Chanel announced relocation of its global headquarters to London. In December of the same year, Chanel announced that it would ban fur and exotic skins from its collections.

In February 2019, Lagerfeld died at age 85. Virginie Viard, who had worked with Lagerfeld at the fashion house for over 30 years, was named the new Creative Director. Viard departed the brand in June 2024.

In December 2021, Leena Nair was appointed Global Chief Executive Officer.

In February 2024, Chanel opened its U.S. flagship store dedicated to watches and fine jewellery on Fifth Avenue in Midtown Manhattan, New York City, near Billionaires&#x27; Row.

In December 2024, Matthieu Blazy was appointed the next Artistic Director of Chanel. Previously, he was creative director of Italian leather goods line Bottega Veneta where his work garnered critical acclaim and commercial success.

=== Exhibitions and retrospectives ===
The Palais Galliera featured a retrospective Gabrielle Chanel. Fashion Manifesto (October 1, 2020 – August 17, 2021). The exhibit later traveled to Mitsubishi Ichigokan Museum in Tokyo, National Gallery of Victoria in Melbourne (December 3, 2021 – April 25, 2022), and will debut at London&#x27;s Victoria &amp; Albert Museum (September 16, 2023).

The ThyssenBornemisza National Museum in Madrid explored the relationship and reciprocal influence between Pablo Picasso and Gabrielle Chanel with a four-part exhibition (October 11, 2022 – January 15, 2023) spanning their works between 1915 and 1925.

The Metropolitan Museum of Art, home to the annual Met Gala in the financial and fashion capital of New York City, first honoured the house with a (May 5-August 7) 2005 exhibit chronicling the work of Coco Chanel&#x27;s designs dating back to the 1920s. The museum&#x27;s Costume Institute will unveil a posthumous retrospective, paying homage to former Creative Director, Karl Lagerfeld (May 5-July 16).

=== Philanthropy, sustainability, arts and culture ===
Fondation Chanel is the philanthropic arm of the house. Founded in 2011, some of the organization&#x27;s key initiatives include promoting greater healthcare advocacy; addressing the disparities in gender-based violence; and &quot;accelerating economic agency and empowerment&quot;. Fondation Chanel has partnered with organizations in Africa, Asia, Europe, Latin America, the United Kingdom, and the United States.

Chanel announced (June 2021) an anchor investment in the Landscape Resilience Fund, contributing $25 million to farmers grappling with the impacts of climate change. Setting a new series of science-based targets, the company also launched the No.1 de Chanel beauty and fragrance line in 2022, with 97% naturally derived ingredients and eco-conscious packaging designed. The house also announced goals in accordance with the Paris Climate Agreement to reduce its carbon footprint by 50% by 2030 and reduce its emissions from value chain by 40% by 2030. As part of the Chanel Mission 1.5 Climate Action Plan, the brand has pledged to transition to 100% renewable electricity by 2025. The company is also sourcing eco-responsible tweeds; shifting to maritime transport with a goal of 80% shipments by sea by 2024; and supporting land and livlihood projects throughout communities in Africa, Southeast Asia, and Latin America. In January 2024, Chanel launched an initiative with the consortium of 15 cosmetics-manufacturers, called the Traceability Alliance for Sustainable Cosmetics to catalyze traceability in the cosmetics sector.

=== Arts and culture ===
The Chanel Culture Fund is a global program of initiatives and partnerships. Since its inception, the House has partnered with the National Portrait Gallery (London), The Centre Pompidou (Paris), and the Power Station (Shanghai). The Fund awards an annual prize (Chanel Next Prize) of €100,000 to ten artists in the fields of performing and visual arts.

Yana Peel, global head of arts and culture said of the Fund in an interview with Harper&#x27;s Bazaar, &quot;At a time when we are navigating our way through complex new environments around the world, we know that artists generate transformative ideas that help us envision the way forward. Chanel has always championed the vitality and advancement of the arts, and we now expand that tradition through the Fund with a focus on supporting cultural innovators and path-breakers who are mapping out what&#x27;s next.”

==Corporate identity==
The Chanel logotype comprises two interlocked, opposed letters-C, one faced left, one faced right. The logotype was given to Chanel by the Château de Crémat, Nice, and was not registered as a trademark until the first Chanel shops were established.
The logo is commonly known to stand for &quot;Coco Chanel&quot; and has become one of the most recognizable logos in the world. It has also become the symbol of prestige, luxury, and class.

In 2022, Chanel donated €2 million towards Care and UNHCR, the money will go to Ukraine to help it during the Russian invasion.

Worldwide, Chanel S.A. operates around 310 Chanel boutiques; 94 in Asia, 70 in Europe, 10 in the Middle East, 128 in North America, 1 in Central America, 2 in South America, and 6 in Oceania. The shops are located in wealthy communities, usually in department stores like Harrods and Selfridges, Bergdorf Goodman, Neiman Marcus and Saks Fifth Avenue, high streets, shopping districts, and inside airports. In 2015, the company paid a record $152 million for 400 North Rodeo Drive in Beverly Hills. This is the most expensive amount paid for retail space in Los Angeles. In October 2020, the company bought its flagship Bond Street boutique in London for £310 million.

=== Trademarks ===
One timeline measurement for Chanel presence in the United States is via trademarks registered with the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO). On Tuesday, 18 November 1924, Chanel, Inc. filed trademark applications for the typeset mark &quot;Chanel&quot; and for the interlocking &quot;CC&quot; design plus word mark. At that time, the trademarks were registered only for the perfume, toiletry, and cosmetic products in the primary class of common metals and their alloys. Chanel provided the description of &quot;face powder, perfume, Eau de Cologne, toilet water, lip stick, and rouge,&quot; to the USPTO.
The Chanel and double-C trademarks were awarded on the same date of 24 February 1925 with respective Serial Numbers of 71205468 and 71205469. The first trademark application for the No. 5 perfume was on Thursday, 1 April 1926, described as perfume and toilet water. First use and commercial use was stated as 1 January 1921. Registration was granted on 20 July 1926 with Serial Number 71229497.

==== Combatting counterfeits ====
Along with other makers, Chanel is a target of counterfeiters. An authentic classic Chanel handbag retails from around US$4,150, while a counterfeit usually costs around US$200. Beginning in the 1990s, all authentic Chanel handbags were numbered.

In 2018, Chanel filed suit in the Federal District Court of the Southern District of New York, alleging The RealReal was hosting counterfeit (fake) Chanel products on their website and implying to customers that an affiliation existed between the two.

Due to the high volume of Chanel counterfeits, the legal department at Chanel has set up a website to educate consumers about &quot;Spotting Fake vs Authentic CHANEL Products.&quot; Many fashion bloggers are spreading awareness about identifying fake luxury items such as Chanel&#x27;s products.

===Fragrance===
In 1924, Pierre Wertheimer founded Parfums Chanel, to produce and sell perfumes and cosmetics; the &quot;parfumerie&quot; proved to be the most profitable business division of the Chanel S.A. corporation. Since its establishment, &quot;parfumerie&quot; Chanel has employed four perfumers:
* Ernest Beaux (1920–1961)
* Henri Robert (1958–1978)
* Jacques Polge (1978–2015)

===Fine jewellery===
Chanel &#x27;High Jewellery&#x27; was founded in November 1932. Chanel debuted &#x27;Bijoux de Diamants&#x27; at her Faubourg Saint-Honoré, Paris mansion. It was also the first high-end jewelry collection created by a fashion designer. The &#x27;Bijoux de Diamants&#x27; was inspired by celestial forms such as stars, comets, and the moon. Gabrielle Chanel designed an estimated 50 pieces with white and yellow diamonds set in platinum and yellow gold.

===Watches===

The Chanel wristwatch division was established in 1987. In 1995, division presented a second design, the &quot;Matelassé&quot;. Although the &quot;Première&quot; and &quot;Matelassé&quot; wristwatches were successful products, the presentation, in 2000, of the &quot;Chanel J12&quot; line of unisex style wristwatches, made of ceramic materials, established Chanel wristwatches as a Chanel marque. The J12 line of wristwatches features models in four dial-face sizes: 33mm, 38mm, 41mm, and 42mm. In 2008, Chanel S.A. and Audemars Piguet developed the ceramic Chanel AP-3125 clockwork, exclusive to the House of Chanel.

As of 2024, Chanel holds 25% stake in MB&amp;F, 20% in F. P. Journe and undisclosed stake in Romain Gauthier.

===Wine===
Chanel owns the wineries Château Rauzan-Ségla, Château Canon, St. Supéry Estate Vineyards &amp; Winery, and Domaine de i&#x27;lle located on the island of Porquerolles in the Cotes de Provence AOP.

===Swimwear===
In 2018, Chanel acquired clothing brand Orlebar Brown, specializing in tailored men&#x27;s swim shorts.

<text>Kirkland is an on-island suburb on the Island of Montreal in southwestern Quebec, Canada. It is named after Charles-Aimé Kirkland, a Quebec provincial politician. It was incorporated as a town in 1961.

Kirkland is primarily a residential community, with a commercial core, and an industrial park straddling the Trans-Canada Highway (Autoroute 40). In 1997, that portion of the Autoroute 40 was renamed to Félix-Leclerc Highway. The city is composed of mainly single-family residences, with some multi-unit facilities (apartments, town houses, and condos) available.

==History==

In the early 18th century settlement began of farming communities along Côte Saint-Charles (now Boulevard Saint-Charles). By 1731, Côte Saint-Charles had 19 farms, 12 houses, and 17 barns. It was part of the Parish of Saint-Joachim de la Pointe Claire, which included the present territory of the cities of Beaconsfield, Kirkland, and Pointe-Claire. The construction of the Grand Trunk Railway in 1855 brought further development.

In 1845, the Municipality of Pointe-Claire was created, abolished two years later and restored in 1855 as the Parish Municipality of Saint-Joachim-de-la-Pointe-Claire (or just Pointe-Claire). In 1910, Beaconsfield split off to form a separate town. In 1955, large portions of the parish municipality were annexed by the City of Pointe-Claire (originally the Village Municipality of Saint-Joachim-de-la-Pointe-Claire) and by the Parish of Sainte-Geneviève. Attempts in the late 1950s by the City of Beaconsfield to annex the municipality started the process to become a town.

In March 1961, it changed status to become a (town/city) and took the name Kirkland. That same year, the construction began of the Trans-Canada Highway (Autoroute 40), completed in 1964.

On January 1, 2002, as part of the 2002–2006 municipal reorganization of Montreal, it was merged into the city of Montreal and became a borough. However, after a change of government and a 2004 referendum, it was re-constituted as an independent municipality on January 1, 2006.

== Demographics ==
According to the Office québécois de la langue française, Kirkland has been officially recognized as a bilingual municipality since 2005-11-02.

In the 2021 Census of Population conducted by Statistics Canada, Kirkland had a population of living in of its total private dwellings, a change of from its 2016 population of . With a land area of , it had a population density of in 2021.



==Economy==

The town of Kirkland has a large business and industrial park spanning both sides of Quebec Autoroute 40. Companies in the area operate in a wide range of industries including aerospace, electronic goods, pharmaceuticals, printed goods, renewable energy, software engineering, telecommunications, petrochemicals, and transportation.

Notable employers in the city of Kirkland include:
* Broccolini Construction
* Jubilant DraxImage
* Merck &amp; Co.
* Nissan

==Local government==

The territory of the Town of Kirkland is divided into eight electoral districts. Each district is represented by a councillor elected by the voters of that district. The mayor is elected by all voters and represents the entire territory made up of eight-districts.

It is a full-service community, with a public works department, recreation department, engineering department, accounting, communications, human resources and administrative services operating for the welfare of its citizens.

<doc id="734024" wikidata="Q260040" url="?curid=734024" title="David Schramm (astrophysicist)">
<text>David Norman Schramm (October 25, 1945 – December 19, 1997) was an American astrophysicist and educator, and one of the world&#x27;s foremost experts on the Big Bang theory. Schramm was a pioneer in establishing particle astrophysics as a vibrant research field. He was particularly well known for the study of Big Bang nucleosynthesis and its use as a probe of dark matter (both baryonic and non-baryonic) and of neutrinos. He also made important contributions to the study of cosmic rays, supernova explosions, heavy-element nucleosynthesis, and nuclear astrophysics generally.

== Biography ==

David Schramm was born in St. Louis, Missouri and earned his master&#x27;s degree in physics from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1967, where he was also a member of the Delta Upsilon fraternity and the wrestling squad. He earned a Ph.D in physics at Caltech in 1971 under Willy Fowler and Gerry Wasserburg. After a brief time as faculty at the University of Texas at Austin where he also played Prop for the Austin Huns Rugby Club alongside Pat Lochridge, he accepted a professorship at the University of Chicago, where he spent the rest of his career.

Schramm received the Robert J. Trumpler Award of the Astronomical Society of the Pacific in 1974, the Helen B. Warner Prize for Astronomy from the American Astronomical Society in 1978, and he was awarded the Julius Edgar Lilienfeld Prize from the American Physical Society in 1993. He was elected to the National Academy of Sciences in 1986.

Schramm, an avid private pilot, died on 19 December 1997, when his Swearingen-Fairchild SA-226 crashed near Denver, Colorado. He was the sole occupant of the aircraft. The National Transportation Safety Board found the cause to be pilot error. At the time of his death he was vice president for research and Louis Block Distinguished Service Professor in the Physical Sciences at the University of Chicago.

== Legacy ==

The David N. Schramm Award for High Energy Astrophysics Science Journalism was created in his honour in the year 2000 by the High-Energy Astrophysics Division of the American Astronomical Society. The Committee on the Physics of the Universe of the U.S. National Research Council dedicated the 2003 report &quot;Connecting Quarks with the Cosmos: Eleven Science Questions for the New Century&quot; to the memory of David N. Schramm. Fermilab hosts the David Schramm Fellowship in theoretical or experimental astrophysics. Schramm also leaves a legacy of former graduate students and postdocs, many of whom work in astrophysics around the world, including Brian Fields (professor of astronomy and physics at the University of Illinois), Katherine Freese (professor of physics at the University of Texas at Austin and director of Nordita, the Nordic Institute for Theoretical Physics in Stockholm), Craig Hogan (professor of astronomy and physics at the University of Chicago and director of the Fermilab Center for Astroparticle Physics), James Lattimer (distinguished professor of astronomy, SUNY Stony Brook), Angela Olinto (provost at Columbia University), Keith Olive (director of the William I Fine Theoretical Physics Institute at the University of Minnesota), and many others. Asteroid 113952 Schramm, discovered by the Sloan Digital Sky Survey at Apache Point Observatory in 2002, was named in his memory. The official was published by the Minor Planet Center on 30 January 2010 ().

<text>The Delaware Memorial Bridge is a dual-span suspension bridge crossing the Delaware River. The toll bridges carry Interstate 295 and U.S. Route 40 and is also the link between Delaware and New Jersey. The bridge was designed by the firm of Howard, Needles, Tammen &amp; Bergendoff with consulting help from engineer Othmar Ammann, whose other designs include the George Washington Bridge and the Verrazzano-Narrows Bridge.

The bridges provide a regional connection for long-distance travelers. While not a part of Interstate 95, they connect two parts of the highway: the Delaware Turnpike (Interstate 95 in Delaware) on the south side with the New Jersey Turnpike (later Interstate 95 in New Jersey) on the north. They also connect Interstate 495, U.S. Route 13, and Route 9 in unincorporated New Castle County, Delaware, near New Castle, with U.S. Route 130 in Pennsville Township, New Jersey (at the settlement of Deepwater, New Jersey). The Delaware Memorial and Benjamin Franklin Bridge are the only crossings of the Delaware River with both U.S. Highway and Interstate Highway designations.

The bridges are dedicated to those from both New Jersey and Delaware who died in World War II, the Korean War, the Vietnam War, and the Persian Gulf War. On the Delaware side of the bridge is a War Memorial, visible from the northbound-side lanes. The toll facility is operated by the Delaware River and Bay Authority.

The Delaware Memorial Bridge is the southernmost and the largest fixed vehicular crossing of the Delaware River. It is also the only fixed vehicular crossing between Delaware and New Jersey. However, at Fort Mott, New Jersey, there is a small amount of land on the New Jersey side of the river that is part of the State of Delaware, and thus there are pedestrian crossings in between those states, but not spanning the river. The Cape May–Lewes Ferry provides an alternate route between travelers from New Jersey and the Northeastern states to southern Delaware.

On clear days, the skyline of Philadelphia is visible in the distance on the left going to New Jersey and on the right leaving New Jersey. Wilmington, Delaware, only a few miles away from the bridge, is also visible. Other landmarks that can be seen from the bridge includes the cooling tower for PSEG&#x27;s Hope Creek Nuclear Generating Station near Salem, New Jersey, the Delaware City Refinery in Delaware City, Delaware, the Reedy Point Bridge, also in Delaware City, both the St. Georges Bridge and the Senator William V. Roth Jr. Bridge in St. Georges, Delaware, and the Commodore Barry Bridge in Chester, Pennsylvania.

, more than 100,000 vehicles cross the twin spans on their combined total of eight lanes daily. The largest single day of traffic had 79,488 private and commercial vehicles cross the bridge one-way on November 29, 2009. The largest single weekend for traffic totals had 211,685 vehicles cross the bridge one-way, August 16–18, 2019.

==History==

===The first span===

Following the opening of the Benjamin Franklin Bridge in Philadelphia, residents of Delaware and New Jersey began to advocate a crossing of the river in the area of Wilmington, Delaware. As commercial pressures mounted, a ferry service began, as an interim measure, to run in 1926, near the bridge&#x27;s current location. Advocates of a bridge crossing between Delaware and New Jersey faced strong opposition from the Philadelphia Port Authorities, which claimed that the bridge would be a menace to navigation. The U.S. Navy and U.S. Coast Guard were also concerned that the bridge would be vulnerable to an enemy attack. If the bridge were to collapse into the river, it could render the Philadelphia Navy Yard unusable.

As traffic by cars and truck increased rapidly, the benefits of a bridge in this area became evident, and its construction was authorized by the highway departments of Delaware and New Jersey in 1945. Originally, a two-lane highway tunnel was considered, but the costs for a four-lane bridge was found to be equivalent in price, therefore being the reason a four-lane bridge was chosen. Congress approved the bridge project on July 13, 1946, and its construction began on February 1, 1949.

The project cost $44 million, and it took two years to complete the high span with towers reaching above water level. The first span opened to traffic on August 16, 1951, and at the time was the sixth-longest main suspension span in the world. The Governor of Delaware, Elbert N. Carvel, and the Governor of New Jersey, Alfred E. Driscoll, dedicated the bridge to each state&#x27;s war dead from World War II.

The bridge quickly proved a popular travel route when the New Jersey Turnpike connection was completed at its north end. By 1955, nearly eight million vehicles were crossing the bridge each year, nearly twice the original projection. By 1960, the bridge was carrying more than 15 million cars and trucks per year, and this increased even more when the bridge was linked to the new Delaware Turnpike, Interstate 95, in November 1963.

===The second span===
Construction of the second span began in mid-1964, north of the original span. It was completed at a cost of $77 million and opened on September 12, 1968, dedicated to those soldiers from Delaware and New Jersey killed in the Korean War and Vietnam War. The original span was closed down for fifteen months for refurbishment: its suspenders were replaced and its deck and median barrier were removed and replaced with a single deck to allow four undivided lanes of traffic. Finally, on December 29, 1969, all eight lanes of the Delaware Memorial Bridge Twin Span opened to traffic, making it the world&#x27;s second-longest twin suspension bridge.

While they are similar in basic appearance, major differences exist between the original and second spans. The original was constructed of riveted steel plates, and has an open-grate shoulder access walk. The second span was constructed mostly of welded steel plates (with heavy riveted joints in crucial areas) like with most contemporary steel bridges, and also has concrete access walks.

The original suspension span carries northbound traffic for Interstate 295, the newer southbound. Crossover lanes on each side of the bridge can allow two-way traffic on one span if the other must be closed for an extensive period of time.

===1969–present===
On July 9, 1969, the oil tanker &quot;Regent Liverpool&quot; struck the fender system protecting the tower piers. The bridge itself was spared damage, but the fender suffered about $1.0 million in damage.

The Delaware River and Bay Authority (DRBA) began a $13 million project in 2003 to resurface the bridge, refurbish the expansion joints, upgrade the electrical system, and replace the elevators in the four towers. This work was completed in 2008.

In 2022 the DRBA began a project to apply ultra-high performance concrete to the driving surface of the eastbound span (i.e., northbound Interstate 295).

The Delaware Memorial Bridge Protection System began in July 2023. The $93 million ship collision protection system project consists of the installation of eight stone-filled dolphins, each measuring in diameter. Four cells are being installed at the piers supporting both eastern and western towers and will be located a minimum of from the edge of the Delaware River&#x27;s channel. Construction is expected to be completed in September 2025.

==Toll==
One-way tolls for traffic entering Delaware (westbound) were instituted in 1992. , the toll is $5.00 for passenger vehicles using cash and $4.75 using a Delaware or New Jersey issued E-ZPass. Frequent Traveler discounts are available. About $270,000 in tolls are collected daily. The DRBA has originally proposed to raise the toll from $4.00 to $5.00 on March 1, 2019, however New Jersey Governor Phil Murphy vetoed this plan on January 3, 2019. In February, the DRBA and the governors of Delaware and New Jersey reached an agreement which postponed the toll hike to May 1, as well as providing a 25 cent E-ZPass discount for passenger vehicles. The frequent traveler rate increased from $1.25 to $1.75.

Prior to the introduction of E-ZPass, both tokens and frequent traveler tickets were used, with special, discounted ticket books for local residents. They were phased out upon the introduction of the new system, and the tokens are no longer valid.

==Motorist assistance==

When the bridge opened in 1951, DRBA officials noticed that some motorists expressed fear of crossing the bridge due to gephyrophobia or acrophobia. As a result, the DRBA Police offers an &quot;acrophobia support&quot; service whereby a motorist can call ahead to arrange for an officer to drive them over the bridge. One officer drives the motorist&#x27;s vehicle while another officer follows in an escort vehicle. The DRBA responds to about 450 escort requests per year, with 60% of calls coming from repeat customers.

==War memorial==
Since opening of the first bridge in 1951, annual ceremonies are held at the bridge&#x27;s war memorial on Memorial Day and Veterans Day to honor the sacrifices of American war veterans. The memorial is located in Veterans Memorial Park in New Castle, Delaware, and it features a reflecting pool, a statue of a soldier, and a wall containing the names of 15,000 men and women from Delaware and New Jersey who were killed in World War II, the Korean War, the War in Vietnam, and the Persian Gulf War.

==Facilities==
The administrative headquarters of DRBA are in the Delaware Memorial Bridge Plaza, on the Delaware side, in New Castle County.

<text>Boroughs () are the subdivisions of Mexico City, the capital city and a federative entity of Mexico. Currently there are 16 boroughs in Mexico City and keep the same territory and name as the former while expanding their local government powers. Each borough is headed by a borough mayor (), which makes it colloquially known as . The traditional center of Mexico City comprises four boroughs: Benito Juárez, Cuauhtémoc, Miguel Hidalgo, and Venustiano Carranza. 

Mexico City is one of the 32 federal entities of Mexico, with the others being the 31 states. It was named (Federal District) until February 5, 2016, when it was officially renamed the . According to the 2020 Mexican census, it is the second most populated entity with inhabitants and the smallest by land area, spanning .

Despite containing the word &quot;city&quot;, it is not governed as a city but as a unit consisting of multiple subdivisions. As a result of the political reforms enacted in 2016, it is no longer designated as a federal district and became a city, a member entity of the Mexican federation, the seat of the Powers of the Union, and the capital of Mexico. Thus, Mexico City is not organized into municipalities.

The largest borough by population is Iztapalapa, with 1,835,486 residents, while the smallest is Milpa Alta, with 152,685 residents. Iztacalco is the most densely populated subdivision in Mexico. The largest borough by land area is Tlalpan, which spans , and the smallest is Iztacalco, with .

The most recent boroughs are Benito Juárez, Cuauhtémoc, Miguel Hidalgo, and Venustiano Carranza, all established in 1970 out of the former circumscription of Mexico City.

<doc id="734032" wikidata="Q142069" url="?curid=734032" title="Chambly, Quebec">
<text>Chambly () is an off-island suburb of Montreal in southwestern Quebec, Canada. It is located in the Montérégie region, inland from the South Shore of the Saint Lawrence River.

It was formed from the merger in 1965 of Fort-Chambly (formerly Chambly-Canton prior to 1952) and the old city of Chambly (formerly Chambly-Basin prior to 1952, and earlier sometimes called Bassin-de-Chambly).

==History==

Descendants of European immigrants have lived in Chambly since the 17th century, but Chambly was not incorporated as a city until 1965.

Samuel de Champlain passed through the area that came to be the site of the town of Chambly, QC, in 1609., when he wrote the following in his journal:

Fort Chambly was captured by American forces on October 20, 1775, during the American Invasion of Canada of 1775–76, it was held until the spring of 1776 when it was evacuated and burned, as the Americans retreated southward to Fort Ticonderoga. Subsequently, prisoners-of-war from the Continental Army, including Colonel William Stacy, were held at Fort Chambly until the end of the American Revolutionary War.

During the occupation the 1st Canadian Regiment, an Extra Continental regiment, was raised by James Livingston to support Colonial efforts in the American Revolutionary War during the invasion of Quebec. Livingston recruited men from Chambly, Quebec as early as September 1775, but a formal regimental designation was made by Richard Montgomery on November 20, 1775, with recognition by the Second Continental Congress following on January 8, 1776. The regiment, which never approached its authorized size of 1,000 men, saw action primarily in the Canadian theater and New York, and was disbanded on January 1, 1781.

The College of Chambly was chartered on March 21, 1835, in Lower Canada.

===Fort Chambly===


Chambly is home to the massive Fort Chambly, built with local stone between 1709 and 1711 in the style of Vauban&#x27;s classic French fortifications. It was built at the mouth of a large basin, on the site of successive wooden forts dating back to 1665. Fort Chambly was the largest in a series of fortifications on the shores of what was known as the Iroquois River (later known as the Chambly River, finally becoming the Richelieu River in the nineteenth century). Originally called Fort Saint-Louis, it soon came to be known by the name of its first commanding officer, Jacques de Chambly, to whom the surrounding seigniory was granted in 1672. It was intended to protect New France in general (and Montreal in specific) from attack from indigenous peoples and the English. Today, the fort is run by Parks Canada and is designated a National Historic Site of Canada, and houses a museum and interpretive centre, and hosts historical re-enactments of military drills (as well as a number of contemporary cultural events).

A small local population clustered around the fort, and the entire area eventually became known as Chambly as well. Among the buildings around the Fort was St. Stephen&#x27;s Anglican Church, which was built to serve the soldiers in garrison as well as the local Loyalist and English settler population.

=== Chambly Canal ===


Chambly is also known for the Chambly Canal, a National Historic Site run by Parks Canada. It was built in 1843 to bypass several kilometers of successive Richelieu River rapids between the towns of Chambly, QC, and Saint-Jean-sur-Richelieu. Part of a series of waterways connecting the Saint Lawrence River and New York City, Chambly Canal was built to facilitate commercial traffic between Canada and the United States.

Trade dwindled after World War I, and as of the 1970s, traffic has been replaced by recreational vessels. Today the canal is enjoyed by tourists and more than 7,000 pleasure boats in the summer, and ice skaters in the winter.

St-Joseph of Chambly Church, at 164 rue Martel, was built between 1880 and 1881. The parish was founded in 1665.
== Geography ==
It sits on the Richelieu River in the Regional County Municipality of La-Vallée-du-Richelieu, at .

== Demographics ==

Chambly is home to the annual &quot;Festival Bières et Saveurs de Chambly&quot; (Chambly Beers and Flavours Festival), an annual beer and local food festival that takes place every Labour Day weekend since 2002. Minors are allowed to attend, but must be accompanied by a parent or guardian at all times. There is a special zone in the festival area dedicated just for minors as well. The festival takes place just outside of Fort Chambly.

<doc id="734034" wikidata="Q426558" url="?curid=734034" title="Astonishing X-Men">
<text>Astonishing X-Men is the name of four X-Men comic book series from Marvel Comics, the first two of which were limited series. The third volume, an ongoing series, began in 2004, with its first run written by Joss Whedon and art by John Cassaday. It was then written by Warren Ellis with art by Simone Bianchi and Phil Jimenez. Daniel Way and Christos Gage then took over the title writing alternating stories. They were followed by James Asmus who wrote one issue, then Greg Pak, who took over for four issues in November 2011. Marjorie Liu wrote the final 21 issues of the series until its end at issue #68 in 2013.

The title&#x27;s fourth volume and second ongoing series launched in 2017 during the &quot;ResurrXion&quot; storyline. The first run was written by Charles Soule and illustrated by a rotating cast of artists. Matthew Rosenberg and artist Greg Land would then take over the series before its end in 2018.

== Volume 1 (1995 limited series) ==
The original &quot;Astonishing X-Men&quot; was a four-issue limited series that replaced &quot;Uncanny X-Men&quot; during the 1995 alternate universe storyline &quot;Age of Apocalypse&quot;, in which all X-titles were given new names and issue numbers. In the storyline, Professor X was murdered 20 years in the past by his own son, Legion. Magneto, witnessing his friend&#x27;s death, committed himself to Xavier&#x27;s dream and created his own team of X-Men. However, he was unable to prevent the rise of the despotic Apocalypse and hence the series primarily dealt with the X-Men&#x27;s battle against him.

&quot;Astonishing X-Men,&quot; written by Scott Lobdell and illustrated by Joe Madureira, featured a team of X-Men led by Rogue and consisted of Sunfire, Blink, Morph, Sabretooth and Wildchild.

== Volume 2 (1999 limited series) ==
The second limited series to bear the title &quot;Astonishing X-Men&quot; was published in 1999. Its three issues were written by Howard Mackie and illustrated by Brandon Peterson. The story occurs after the storyline &quot;The Shattering&quot;. Most of the regular X-Men left the team over a conflict with Professor X. An interim team consists of Cyclops, Phoenix, Wolverine, Archangel, Cable, and Nate Grey.

This team protected the Mannites (a group of super powered, genetically engineered children) from Death, a horseman of Apocalypse. Wolverine was apparently murdered by Death in the final pages of the series, but it was later revealed that &quot;Death&quot; was actually a mind controlled Wolverine, and that the &quot;Wolverine&quot; who was killed was an imposter, a shapeshifting Skrull.

===Collected editions===
== Volume 3 (2004–2013) ==
In 2004, Marvel used the title &quot;Astonishing X-Men&quot; for an ongoing X-Men series initially written by Joss Whedon and illustrated by John Cassaday. The series is noted for its independence from crossovers and large-scale events in the Marvel Universe such as House of M, Decimation, Civil War, Messiah Complex, Avengers Vs. X-Men, and Battle of the Atom. This was previously due to the long delays between issues and Whedon&#x27;s own stated desire to remain away from big crossovers, which he personally disliked, and what he saw as hectic and unfollowable X-Men continuity. This policy persisted almost to the end of the series, with the sole exception being the &quot;X-Termination&quot; event in 2013.

=== Joss Whedon run (2004–2008) ===
Whedon/Cassaday&#x27;s &quot;Astonishing X-Men&quot; is a continuation of Grant Morrison&#x27;s &quot;New X-Men&quot; title and features a similar line-up of characters, including Cyclops and Emma Frost (as co-team leaders), Beast, Kitty Pryde/Shadowcat, Colossus, and Wolverine. This team became the usual focus for a majority of issues during Whedon&#x27;s run. The run introduced a number of original characters into the Marvel Universe including Kavita Rao, Special Agent Brand, S.W.O.R.D., Hisako Ichiki, Ord of the Breakworld and Blindfold. Whedon&#x27;s run on the series was a critical and commercial success. The roster of the book was also the focus of various limited series at the time, such as &quot;X-Men: Phoenix—Endsong, &quot; &quot;X-Men: Phoenix—Warsong&quot; and &quot;World War Hulk: X-Men.&quot;

==== &quot;Gifted&quot; (issues #1–6) ====
The first story arc focused on the introduction of several key characters and their involvement on the team. Whedon introduced a &quot;mutant cure&quot; designed by Indian Benetech scientist Dr. Kavita Rao, who was secretly sponsored by warrior alien Ord. The prospect of &quot;real&quot; humanity arouses the interest of a heavily mutated Beast, who visits Rao only to discover that the drug is the product of illegal experimentation on an unknown victim(s). The X-Men raid Benetech and reunite with Colossus. With Colossus&#x27;s help, the team takes down Ord, but not before it&#x27;s revealed that a mutant (most likely an X-Man) would destroy Ord&#x27;s home planet, the Breakworld, within the next three years.

With this 2005 arc, Whedon brought back Colossus four years after his comic book death in 2001.

==== &quot;Dangerous&quot; (issues #7–12) ====
This arc features a Sentinel attack with a mystery mastermind. The culprit is the Danger Room itself, which has become sentient and fights the X-Men in a robotic form called &quot;Danger.&quot; The Sentinel that destroyed Genosha becomes aware of its actions and ceases its attack on the X-Men. It is revealed that Professor X imprisoned Danger and made it an unwilling servant, leaving the X-Men disgusted. It is also revealed that Emma Frost is aligned with the Hellfire Club.

==== &quot;Torn&quot; (issues #13–18) ====
The X-Men are manipulated by a new Hellfire Club, consisting of Cassandra Nova, Emma Frost, the enigmatic Perfection, Negasonic Teenage Warhead, and Sebastian Shaw. It is revealed that when Nova&#x27;s mind was imprisoned by Emma into a biological &quot;slug&quot;, Nova placed a subtle suggestion into Emma&#x27;s mind to cause Emma to believe she had to help Nova destroy the X-Men and free Nova, and that Cyclops&#x27; inability to control his optic blasts is result of a childhood trauma. Nova initially defeats the X-Men by manipulating their greatest fears. In the end, Nova&#x27;s plot is revealed to Emma by Cyclops, but it is unknown whether Emma returned the consciousness of Nova to the slug or if it went elsewhere. Moments later, Ord and Danger burst into the room, and they are all forcibly teleported away by S.W.O.R.D. to a spaceship headed for the Breakworld.

The final panel of issue 15, in which Shadowcat crouches in a sewer clenching her fists, was an homage to the final panel of &quot;Uncanny X-Men&quot; #132, in which Wolverine did the same.

==== &quot;Unstoppable&quot; (issues #19–24 and &quot;Giant-Size Astonishing X-Men&quot; #1) ====
The final arc takes place on the alien Breakworld. The X-Men square off against the Breakworld leaders, who intend to destroy Earth by firing a giant bullet at it. The Danger subplot is also resolved, and it is revealed that Danger is hard-coded not to kill. Shadowcat phases inside the Breakworld bullet, and when it reaches Earth, makes it intangible, so that the bullet passes through Earth. However, she is unable to remove herself from the bullet and vanishes with it into space.

=== Warren Ellis run (2008–2011) ===
Marvel announced at San Diego Comicon 2007 that following completion of the Whedon/Cassaday run on Astonishing X-Men, the series would continue with the new creative team of Warren Ellis and Simone Bianchi. Ellis later confirmed this story on his website, saying the series would be retitled &quot;Astonishing X-Men: Second Stage.&quot; He also mentioned that, like Whedon, he would be given complete creative freedom without having to pay mind to the franchise&#x27;s sprawling continuity.

This run was expected to debut in early 2008, but was pushed back to July 2008, with the &quot;Second Stage&quot; subtitle dropped. 
A sketchbook was released before the first issue and showed costume redesigns by Bianchi. The characters showcased were Dazzler, Beast, Nightcrawler, Archangel, Cyclops, Emma Frost, Colossus, Storm, and Wolverine. While some of the characters did not appear in the book, Ellis had mentioned earlier that a majority of Bianchi&#x27;s drawings were made public to promote the title, and that upon his run&#x27;s announcement the final cast had not been set.

Ellis and Bianchi&#x27;s first issue, &quot;Astonishing X-Men&quot; #25, featured the team relocated to San Francisco, with a base in the Marin headlands. The story takes place in the aftermath of the &quot;House of M&quot; story arc, which put mutants on the verge of extinction. The initial &quot;Ghost Box&quot; arc was printed under the &quot;Manifest Destiny&quot; label, but did not feature any crossovers with other titles. The only addition to the team was Storm, with Colossus and Kitty Pryde having left the team.

==== &quot;Ghost Box&quot; (issues #25–30) ====
Now based in San Francisco, Ellis established the X-Men as protectors of the city. The new team consisted of Cyclops, Emma Frost, Beast, Wolverine and Armor, and later, Storm arrived. The X-Men uncovered a plot of mutant synthesis from an unusual murder. The killer (designated &#x27;X&#x27;) was located, fixing and restarting the eponymous &quot;ghost box&quot; in a spaceship. X was defeated but killed himself rather than surrender information about his intentions and &quot;the Annex.&quot;

The team returned to San Francisco with Suspect X&#x27;s &quot;mysterious box&quot; (actually a &quot;Ghost Box&quot;) in tow and gave it to Hank along with a syringe filled with Suspect X&#x27;s blood. After analyzing the box and blood and reviewing Suspect X&#x27;s file, Hank told Scott that there appears to be talk about a secret war between Suspect X&#x27;s people and the murdered mutant from the beginning of the story arc. There is also talk about a mysterious place called Tian, China, which piques the interest of Wolverine. After analyzing Suspect X&#x27;s blood, Hank finds that Suspect X is a normal mutant but with his X-gene on a different chromosome. Just like the murder victim, Hank believes that Suspect X is a manufactured mutant. Hank wants to bring in Abigail Brand from S.W.O.R.D. to help investigate this matter, but Scott disagrees. In the end, against Scott&#x27;s wishes, Brand is brought in and tells the X-Men that the Ghost Box is a dimensional portal between different realities. Hank concludes that Suspect X is not a manufactured mutant after all; in Suspect X&#x27;s reality the x-gene is normally located on a different chromosome. Brand wants this case to fall under S.W.O.R.D.&#x27;s jurisdiction, but Scott objects. Brand gives Scott and the X-Men time to investigate before she brings in S.W.O.R.D.. The X-Men locate Tian, an uncharted area of China that no surveillance or satellite system can access, not even the Chinese government. The X-Men sneak into Tian and discover the headquarters of a secret group of mutants informally referred to by Hank as the &quot;Chinese X-Men.&quot; Sadly, they seem to have died because of M-Day&#x27;s associated effects.

As Storm and Emma investigate the grounded temple, Emma notices they are not alone and that she will have to switch to her diamond form, leaving her without her telepathy. She relays this to Cyclops, who is with Beast, Armor and Wolverine. As Armor and Wolverine search the temple for anyone else, Scott and Beast discuss Forge, M-Day and its effects on the multiverse. Armor and Wolverine come across a man who can fire lasers from his fingers, Storm and Emma lose their powers in the presence of the mutant hiding from them, and Cyclops and Beast take on a mutant with a strange chameleon mutation. After the X-Men take down their foes, they reveal to the X-Men they have a mutual friend, Forge. Emma continues to interrogate the X-Men&#x27;s captives, and the team discovers that Forge created the manufactured mutants (including the victim in the beginning of the arc), for a counter-strike against the Annexation using a Ghost Box that he acquired.

The team head towards Forge&#x27;s location and are apprehensive about the upcoming meeting. After some discussion with Forge, Cyclops and Storm try to reason with him but he is strongly determined to see his plan through. Forge&#x27;s insistence seems to stem from years of being ignored and neglected and he desires to leave behind a legacy and save the world. Beast has Brand send an immensely powerful laser beam into the Ghost Box&#x27;s portal. Storm urges Forge to escape, but he would rather face death than humiliation, and the team escapes as the beam destroys both the Ghost Box and the world from which the invaders came.

==== &quot;Ghost Boxes&quot; (&quot;Astonishing X-Men: Ghost Boxes&quot; #1–2) ====
During a four-month hiatus in the middle of &quot;Ghost Box&quot;&#x27;s publication schedule, Ellis published &quot;Astonishing X-Men: Ghost Boxes&quot;. The two-issue spin-off series featured four short stories, with each revolving around Ghost Boxes. The first story, &quot;Agent X-13&#x27;s Report on the Emergency Annexation of Earth-616,&quot; is the only one of the four that does not take place in a parallel universe. Rather, it is an &quot;alternate ending&quot; to the &quot;Ghost Box&quot; arc where the Annexation of Earth-616 is successful.

The second story, &quot;Being an Journal By Miss Emma Frost of New Portsmouth Bay in the State of New Albion,&quot; takes place on Earth-889, a steampunk parallel universe. In this story the X-Men, here known as X-Society, investigate parallel events similar to what happened on Earth-616 and inadvertently cause the Hindenburg disaster. The Emma Frost of this reality would later return in the &quot;Exalted&quot; storyline and be featured on the team in the &quot;X-Treme X-Men&quot; title.

The third story, &quot;The Last Testament of Scott Summers,&quot; deals with a parallel Earth where the Annexation is successful and the X-Men are eliminated, save for Cyclops.

The final story, &quot;4,&quot; focuses on a parallel Armor, Beast, and Wolverine five years after a catastrophic attack wiped out nearly all of the mutants and humanity. With barely any resources left, the three spend a year marching towards Kalispell, clinging onto the hope of a sanctuary where the resistance can make a final stand.

==== &quot;Exogenetic&quot; (issues #31–35) ====
Agent Brand&#x27;s investigation of an orbiting laboratory in space ends with it self-destructing, damaging her escape ship. As the craft falls toward Earth, she radios the X-Men for help, and they save her before the craft can crash into San Francisco. In the crowd, Emma notices deceased former student Wallflower and follows after her. Wallflower immediately transforms into a bio-sentinel and the team destroy it. Brand reveals that an individual called Kaga hacked into the X-Men&#x27;s files, using Beast&#x27;s work on deriving a live x-gene from dead mutants to recreate some of the X-Men&#x27;s greatest foes, such as the Brood, and bio-sentinels masquerading in cloned bodies of their former allies.

Brand&#x27;s explanation is interrupted when a Brood-Krakoa hybrid attacks, attempting to destroy any physical evidence of the bio-sentinel. The X-Men destroy it and locate the hidden ship that dropped the hybrid, boarding it. They find another dead mutant, Paradigm, whom Kaga used to hack into the X-Men&#x27;s files. Away from the team, Cyclops destroys the remnants of Paradigm, killing him, while the X-Men fight off and destroy a Brood-Sauron hybrid. The X-Men fly the ship into Kaga&#x27;s base, finding an army of genetically engineered monstrosities meant to attack them. They destroy all the experimental creatures and confront Kaga.

Kaga is revealed to be a deformed elderly man with numerous genetic abnormalities and disorders, a mutant born from a mother who survived the atomic bombing of Hiroshima. He reveals that he hates the X-Men for their perfect bodies and incredible superhuman abilities despite being labeled &quot;mutants,&quot; whereas he is deformed, trapped in a deteriorating body. In retaliation, Cyclops decides that he will not kill Kaga but will ensure that &quot;Mutantes Sans Frontières&quot; gives Kaga the care and medical attention he needs for the rest of his natural life.

==== &quot;Xenogenesis&quot; (&quot;Astonishing X-Men: Xenogenesis&quot; #1–5) ====
A miniseries that takes the X-Men to Africa to deal with a mysterious mutagen that is causing mutations amongst newborn children.

Storm leaves her home in Wakanda to visit the X-Men. They reunite and go to Africa to investigate a series of mutant births, which excites the hope of mutants replenishing their species.

They find that the area set up for Mutantes Sans Frontieres has been overtaken by soldiers. The X-Men defeat the troops, and Emma Frost kisses the staff in order to let them download the native language for 48 hours so they may be able to communicate with the locals.

Beast witnesses the mutations and studies the babies, discovering they are not mutants but are simply affected by a type of radiation in the area. Before they can investigate, a cyborg arrives, claiming to be in charge of the area, and his armed troops take everyone hostage. Cyclops distracts the cyborg while Emma controls all of his troops, and they discover that they must work together in order to find out the cause of the radiation.

In the woods, they find a man running for his life. Wolverine, Beast, and two of the cyborg&#x27;s best men track him into the jungle. A ghost box opens, and armed troops known as Furies emerge to kill the running man. Wolverine and Beast take them down, but the Ghost Box unleashes larger Furies that can morph their arms into weapons, and regenerate. Beast is shot, the cyborg&#x27;s men are eviscerated, and Wolverine is almost killed when Cyclops and the others rescue them.

Emma scans the running man and discovers he is a multiverse teleporter. He escaped from his world, which was overrun by the Furies, who had killed every super-powered individual. The Furies were sent after him via the Ghost Box. Emma tells Cyclops that during their fight, they must keep one Fury alive or else everyone will die.

A single Fury is left for Emma, who nearly kills her. She takes control of its mind and performs a &quot;psychic surgery&quot;, which alters its programming. Emma changes its orders to say it completed the mission and returned because it had no other commands. Without any reason to pursue further, the outside forces would leave Earth alone.

Emma also reveals to Cyclops that the man they have helped emits a burst of radiation when he teleports between universes, which is the cause of the babies&#x27; mutations. The cyborg kills the teleporter, saying he cannot have a volatile human dirty bomb walking around able to hurt everyone in the area. He says he doesn&#x27;t like doing these kinds of things, but he has to, since it is his job.

=== Daniel Way and Christos Gage runs (2011) ===
During New York City Comic Con, Marvel editors announced that following Warren Ellis&#x27; run, Daniel Way would take over writing duties for the series with Jason Pearson illustrating. Shortly after, it was announced that Christos Gage would also be writing for &quot;Astonishing X-Men&quot;, with Juan Bobillo as illustrator. Gage&#x27;s arc would alternate with Way&#x27;s over the course of seven issues. Way later revealed that this format was done due to illustrator Jason Pearson not being available on a monthly basis, and called the decision to alternate stories &quot;brilliant.&quot; Though Pearson was the original artist for &quot;Monstrous&quot;, he would only end up working on one-and-half issues, with artists Sara Pichelli and Nick Bradshaw doing the illustration for the rest of the arc.

Daniel Way&#x27;s &quot;Monstrous&quot; arc would take a team of Cyclops, Emma Frost, Wolverine and Armor to Japan and Monster Island. Christos Gage&#x27;s &quot;Meanwhile&quot; arc would feature an outer space rescue mission with Storm, Kitty Pryde, Colossus, Lockheed, Abigail Brand and Beast (who was with the Avengers during that time).

==== &quot;Monstrous&quot; and &quot;Meanwhile&quot; (issues #36–42) ====
During &quot;Monstrous&quot;, Armor learns that her mother and brother have died in an accident in Japan. Cyclops, Emma Frost and Wolverine accompany her to Tokyo to attend their wakes. Meanwhile, Mentallo is dispatched by Roxxon Corporation to Monster Island, on which the corporation intends to drill for oil. However, Mentallo psychically enslaves the monsters on the island in order to extort cash from Roxxon, and sets one of the monsters to attack Tokyo. The monster is defeated by the team, including Armor, who had left the wake earlier to rejoin them.

Cyclops, Emma, Wolverine, and Armor then make their way to Monster Island. Wolverine and Emma are captured by Mentallo, who intends to bury them alive when the volcano erupts, but they are freed by Cyclops. The X-Men pursue Mentallo, and though he manages to escape, he is crushed alive when one of the giant monsters dropped a cargo container directly on top of him, which contained the entire billion dollars in cash.

Armor reunites with her father, who admits that he was upset when she left the wake, but after seeing her nobly set aside her grief to show great strength and protect the city, he tells her that he has never been prouder of her than that day. The two then say their goodbyes.

In &quot;Meanwhile&quot;, Agent Brand leads a rescue mission to the Pandora&#x27;s Box space station, where some of the universe&#x27;s most dangerous experiments are conducted. Only one person has been retrieved from the station, but he leaves Brand for dead. As a result, Beast recruits Storm, Colossus, Kitty Pryde and Lockheed to rescue her. The team find Brand and members of S.W.O.R.D. still alive, but they have been infected by the Brood. The station&#x27;s scientists had been trying to extract the larvae without killing the hosts.

The X-Men get back to the ship and have an opportunity to destroy the space station and eliminate the Brood for good. Brand argues against this, stating that in the galaxy&#x27;s larger ecosystem, the Brood are necessary to take out the larger, more dangerous species. They decide to take out the Brood Queens (multiple being allowed to exist to allow species survival), to sever the mental connection between the species and allow the rest of the Brood to return home without any consequence.

While the X-Men attack the Brood, the team becomes infected and gradually mutate into the Brood themselves, the only exception being Kitty Pryde, still in her intangible state. The team find another unnamed Brood teenager, who became an outcast due to his compassion for mammals. Eventually, the X-Men are able to regain their human memories mid-battle and eliminate the Brood Queens. The Brood are given the option to go home, which they accept. The Brood teenager accompanies the X-Men to S.W.O.R.D.&#x27;s headquarters and observes the new Brood larvae that have been extracted from the infected X-Men. He remarks that with no ties to the hive mind or the Brood Queen, the future Brood under the S.W.O.R.D.’s care have a bright future. Storm says that it is now up to him to look after the new Broodlings, and that if he were ever to come to Earth, he would have a place on the X-Men.

=== James Asmus one-off (2011) ===
A one-off story, issue #43 &quot;Whispering Machines,&quot; was written by James Asmus, his only credit in the series. The issue served as a bridge between &quot;Monstrous&quot;/&quot;Meanwhile&quot; and the next story arc. It would feature the series&#x27; smallest team yet of Danger and Emma Frost, with an appearance from Beast (who was still with the Avengers). Asmus would describe &quot;Whispering Machines&quot; as a &quot;buddy cop-type story,&quot; with &quot;mismatched and yet perfectly paired partners for a specific mission.&quot;

==== &quot;Whispering Machines&quot; (Issue #43) ====
In &quot;Whispering Machines&quot;, Danger returns to recruit Emma Frost to jailbreak Machinesmith out of the Avengers headquarters. However, Machinesmith had been manipulating her into trying to break him loose while trying to take over her body. Danger regains control and returns him to Beast and the Avengers, and Frost comforts her in saying that she is still young and still learning to trust others, but that is one thing that makes her human.

=== Greg Pak run (2011–2012) ===
Marvel would announce that Greg Pak and Mike McKone would be the next creative team to take over &quot;Astonishing X-Men&quot;. A teaser image was released of Cyclops and Storm kissing, fueling speculation that the run would feature a romantic arc between the two. On a Q&amp;A on Marvel&#x27;s website, Pak revealed that his story would take place in the aftermath of the &quot;Schism&quot; event, and that he would be writing a more emotional arc. Pak&#x27;s story would later be continued and spun-off into the &quot;X-Treme X-Men&quot; title.

==== &quot;Exalted&quot; (issues #44–47) ====
In the &quot;Exalted&quot;, the focus lies mostly on Scott Summers as a lead character. Through the use of a Ghost Box, a device which allows characters to enter into a parallel universe, an alternate reality in the X-Men continuity is explored. In the timeline featured here, the X-Men have waged war on Magneto to free the subjugated human race. In his dying breath, Magneto cracks the planet causing certain doom. Xavier, recast as Savior in this timeline, and other Marvel super-geniuses create a device to save their planet by harnessing the powers of mutants.

Savior scours the multiverse with a Ghost Box collecting various incarnations of X-Men, favoring Cyclops, and using them until they burn out. That is until his Storm finds &quot;our&quot; Cyclops. Scott wakes to find himself imprisoned in the device along with alternate versions of mutant teammates James Howlett, Emmeline Frost, Shadow(cat), and a young Kurt Wagner (Nightcrawler). They escape, learn the truth about Savior and his plans, and make the hard humanity-at-stake decisions of heroes.

Along the way it becomes apparent that a single Cyclops can provide immense power for the device, and that many of them have chosen to self-sacrifice to preserve Savior&#x27;s world. When Scott refuses and destroys the device telling Savior to &quot;Find another way!&quot;, Savior reveals that he indeed has a permanent solution that requires the sacrifice of an entire universe, and claiming that this Scott&#x27;s aberrant behavior proves he is from a flawed universe that he will not feel guilty about consuming with the help of a modified Ghost Box.

This combined with Savior&#x27;s willingness to sacrifice some of the humans from his own reality is enough for Storm to side with the former captives. Together (and with Scott&#x27;s Storm and Emma brought in by young Kurt) this makeshift team of X-Men defeat Savior. As his Emma and Storm depart through a failing Ghost Box portal, Scott tells them that his decisions doomed that Earth and he should stay to help fix it. Howlett pushes him through saying he had been worried momentarily about Scott&#x27;s non-self-sacrifice, but now was reassured, and that Scott wouldn&#x27;t be the last person they save today.

The alternate universe Howlett, Kurt and others would later return in a new &quot;X-Treme X-Men&quot; series, also written by Pak.

=== Marjorie Liu run (2012–2013) ===
Writer Marjorie Liu and artist Mike Perkins took over the &quot;Astonishing X-Men&quot; creative team as of issue 48 in March 2012, writing until the series&#x27; cancellation in issue 68. Her time on the series marked a more grounded take on the team, focusing more on the relationships of each characters with human reactions and interaction. By the end of her run, Liu&#x27;s written credits would amount to 21 regular issues and one annual issue, second only to Whedon for most entries written for the title.

Liu&#x27;s run completely rebooted the series&#x27; setting and lineup, which had until this point featured Cyclops and Emma Frost leading the X-Men. Under Liu, the series shifted focus to Wolverine&#x27;s side as the team returned to New York during the &quot;Regenesis&quot; storyline and following the &quot;Avengers vs. X-Men&quot; storyline. The primary X-Men lineup for the rest of the series consisted of Wolverine, Gambit, Warbird, Northstar, Cecilia Reyes, Iceman, and Karma.

==== &quot;Northstar&quot; (Issues #48–51) ====
In the issues illustrated by Mike Perkins, the story primarily focuses on Northstar and Karma. Northstar&#x27;s arc revolved around his issues with his non-mutant boyfriend Kyle, as both are unsure they can come to a mutual understanding on Northstar&#x27;s duties as an X-Man and whether Kyle can provide enough emotional support. Northstar proposes marriage to Kyle, but he is at first rebuffed.

The X-Men are soon attacked by the Marauders, though it is revealed that they were under mind-control and were not acting on their own volition. After the attack, Karma soon falls under the control from the same culprit, an unknown business woman. Karma later takes control of the other X-Men, as well as Kyle, who tries to kill himself in front of Northstar. They are each able to break free, but Karma then goes missing. As the team tends to their wounds, Kyle then accepts Northstar&#x27;s marriage proposal.

==== &quot;Weaponized&quot; (Issues #52–56 &amp; &quot;Astonishing X-Men Annual&quot; #1) ====
During the wedding reception, Wolverine wanders off and finds Karma, only to get attacked by an unseen force. It is then revealed who had been controlling Karma and the Marauders from the beginning - Susan Hatchi, a successful weapons developer who wished to test out new nanotechnology to physically control her victims. Born Da&#x27;o Coy Manh, she is Karma&#x27;s illegitimate half-sister whose mother was killed by their father.

In a later confrontation with the X-Men, Hatchi uses her nanotechnology to seize control of the team and orders them to takeover Madripoor or she will use her technology on New York and kill the population. She wants to not only demonstrate the effectiveness of her weapon but to draw out their father from hiding by publicly using Karma as bait. While she is able to locate her father in Madripoor, the X-Men are able to counteract the technology and defeat her. While the two sisters reach reconciliation, their father takes advantage of their engagement and shoots Hatchi. He is arrested by the police for her murder. After Hatchi&#x27;s death, Karma inherits her company as the only eligible relative of age and effectively becomes a billionaire.

==== &quot;Unmasked&quot; and &quot;X-Termination&quot; (Issues #57–68) ====
Gabriel Hernandez Walta would take over the art duties from Mike Perkins for the remainder of the run, though Amilcar Pinna would draw the two penultimate issues. The final 12 issues would contain shorter arcs, along with the series&#x27; only crossover with other X-Men titles.

The initial two issues (issues #57 to #58) focus on Warbird, who travels to Egypt after seeing an artifact in a magazine that turns out to be made by a race the Shi&#x27;ar obliterated a thousand years ago.

For the next three issues (issues #59 to #61), the series tied into the &quot;X-Termination&quot; storyline, with the &quot;X-Treme X-Men&quot; and &quot;Age of Apocalypse&quot; ongoing titles. Though not officially part of the crossover, issue #59 served as a prelude to the storyline. Issue #60 served as Part 2 of the crossover while issue #61 was Part 5. The storyline focused on the Age of Apocalypse Nightcrawler&#x27;s attempt to return home, which resulted in the release of three evil beings that destroy anyone they touch. Several casualties resulted, including the AoA&#x27;s Nightcrawler, Sabretooth, Horror Show, and Fiend, as well as the X-Treme X-Men&#x27;s Xavier, Kid Nightcrawler, and Hercules. Following the event, &quot;Astonishing X-Men&quot; would be the sole title of the three to continue publication.

The next arc in the series (issues #62 to #65) featured Iceman, who was corrupted by the Apocalypse seed during &quot;X-Termination&quot; and sent the world into an ice age.

The next two issues (issues #66 to #67) deal with an alien being that possesses the minds of many New Yorkers. Gambit and Wolverine track the alien down to Indiana, where they enlist the aid of a local human girl who helps discover its origins and intentions.

&quot;Astonishing X-Men&quot; ended with issue #68 in October 2013, wrapping up many loose ends of the run: Iceman coming to terms with the damage he has dealt, Northstar and Kyle ensuring their future together, and Warbird accepting her role on the X-Men and her home on Earth. Its status as a team book featuring Wolverine and his X-Men team was replaced by a new series by Jason Aaron titled &quot;Amazing X-Men&quot; in November 2013.

===Reception===
Whedon&#x27;s run was a critical success. &quot;Gifted&quot; was given the accolade of &quot;Wizard&quot;&#x27;s book of the year, while &quot;IGN&quot; called the arc &quot;best X-Men run in a decade&quot; and lauded Whedon for flawless character dynamics. Whedon said that while he knew &quot;many people have done cure scenarios before me,&quot; he was not familiar with any of those earlier stories at the time he started working on the arc. The &quot;mutant cure&quot; plot of &quot;Gifted&quot; eventually became the basis of the &quot;X-Men: The Last Stand&quot;.

The third volume of the &quot;Astonishing X-Men&quot; comic book series has generally been well received with comic sales normally being very high. Whedon&#x27;s run was nominated for several Eisner Awards. In 2006, the series won the Best Continuing Series and in 2005 and 2006, John Cassaday won Best Artist/Penciller/Inker or Penciller/Inker Team (tied with Frank Quitely for 2005).

However, Joss Whedon&#x27;s run on &quot;Astonishing X-Men&quot; was subjected to criticism regarding the delays between the issues. Whedon&#x27;s initial contract with Marvel Comics was for twelve issues for one year but the final issues were four months late. After a break of several months, the title resumed in February 2006 with the new story arc &quot;Torn.&quot; With issue 13, the comic temporarily went from monthly to bimonthly to allow more time for Whedon and Cassaday to finish each issue and avoid further late releases. The book resumed a monthly schedule in September 2006 with issues 16 and 17, but was delayed once again for issue 18. Delays persisted for a variety of reasons, including Cassaday&#x27;s last-minute assignment to pencil the fifth issue of &quot;Fallen Son: The Death of Captain America&quot;.

In &quot;Wizard&quot; #173, Whedon admitted to making mistakes in the second story arc, saying he was so fascinated with the idea of the &quot;new intelligence&quot; that he neglected the action and thus prevented the story from flowing well.

Marjorie Liu&#x27;s run on &quot;Astonishing X-Men&quot; received media attention for featuring Marvel Comics&#x27; first gay wedding between Northstar and longterm partner Kyle in issue #51. According to Marvel Comics editor-in-chief Axel Alonso, the issue comes as a response to real world&#x27;s legalization of same sex marriage in New York. Liu was nominated for a GLAAD Media Award in 2013.

===&quot;What If&quot;===
The 2009 series of &quot;What If?&quot; includes a special one-shot comic exploring two alternatives to events which have occurred in the &quot;Astonishing X-Men&quot; series. The first examines what would have happened if Ord had resurrected Jean Grey—who was thought a logical candidate for the character rumored to be returning from the dead—instead of Colossus. The second considers the ensuing consequences if the android Ultron had learned of the existence of the sentient Danger during his then-battle with the Runaways, leading him to become determined to make her his bride.

===Motion comics===
Marvel later produced motion comics based on &quot;Astonishing X-Men,&quot; releasing them on Hulu, iTunes, the PlayStation Store, and other video services. These animated episodes were then released on DVD through Shout! Factory. Marvel Knights Animation would continued animating Whedon and Cassaday&#x27;s run, starting with the second storyline of the series X-Men: Dangerous.

The titles in the series include:
# &quot;Astonishing X-Men: Gifted&quot; (2009)
# &quot;Astonishing X-Men: Dangerous&quot; (April 2012)
# &quot;Astonishing X-Men: Torn&quot; (August 2012)
# &quot;Astonishing X-Men: Unstoppable&quot; (November 2012)

===Prose novel===
Marvel released a prose adaption of &quot;Astonishing X-Men: Gifted&quot; in September 2012, written and adapted by comics writer Peter David.

== Volume 4 (2017–2018) ==
As part of the &quot;ResurrXion&quot; event, Marvel teased the arrival of a new X-Men team, revealing two members at a time over the course of several days. Eventually, Marvel revealed that the team would be part of the new ongoing &quot;Astonishing X-Men&quot; series, written by Charles Soule and illustrated by a rotating art team. The series starts when a band of X-Men members find themselves reunited in London in order to face the threat of the Shadow King. The team includes Psylocke, Bishop, Angel, Gambit, Fantomex, Old Man Logan, Rogue, and Mystique (initially disguised as Beast)

=== Charles Soule run (2017–2018)===
==== &quot;Life of X&quot; (issues #1–6) ====
The first story arc features the return of the Shadow King and his series of psychic attacks against various mutants. While in London, Psylocke was targeted by the Shadow King, but she was able to send psychic butterflies to seek help before being possessed by the entity. The Shadow King focused the totality of Psylocke&#x27;s psychic power emerging as a psychic butterfly and attacking the minds of the people in London. Returning her distress call were Rogue and Old Man Logan, aboard the Blackbird above the North Atlantic; Bishop, doing research in the British Museum, Angel, flying over the Scotland; Gambit and Fantomex, in the middle of a heist in Paris; and Beast, arriving in late after the attack. Betsy told the team that her attacker was the Shadow King and he&#x27;s attacking psychics in an effort to return from the astral plane. Betsy sent Rogue, Gambit, Fantomex, Beast and Old Man Logan into the astral plane while Bishop and Angel stayed guard to protect Psylocke and the others.

While in the astral plane, it is revealed that the Shadow King had lured the X-Men as a psychic game with the late Charles Xavier, whose mind he had kidnapped when he died. The Shadow King intends to use The X-Men as vessels to escape into the real world. Beast also reveals himself to be Mystique, who also wants to stop The Shadow King. Initially, The Shadow King is able to escape using the bodies of Old Man Logan and Gambit, who attack and also spread his psychic hold onto the citizens of London. Angel is forced to turn into Archangel to deal with his possessed teammates. As they fight, the British military are brought on board, and consider attacking both the X-Men and as well as the possessed citizens by dropping a bomb into the area.

Eventually, Xavier is able to defeat the Shadow King with Rogue, Fantomex, and Mystique, and returns the three to the real world in time to stop the British military from attacking its own citizens. Right before the X-Men begin their counter-attack, Fantomex takes off his mask and reveals himself to be Xavier, who now calls himself X.

==== &quot;A Man Called X&quot; (issues #7–12) ====
As the X-Men process Xavier&#x27;s return as X, the bomb is dropped onto London, only to be stopped by Archangel. X then cleanses the minds of the possessed citizens of the Shadow King&#x27;s hold. He explains to the team that Fantomex willingly sacrificed himself to the astral plane to allow X to return to the world of the living. However, in his escape from the astral plane, X also realizes that he also unintentionally freed Proteus.

Proteus takes control of a village in the Scottish Highlands, who intends to bring the astral plane to reality. He then warps all of the villagers with his powers and turns the village into a garden that fires reality seeds all over the world. X mentions the network of psychics the Shadow King was using and that Betsy who is in control should tap into it. She agrees and does so, yet unbeknownst to her, X was possessed by the Shadow King, who violently erupts from X&#x27;s head.

Following X&#x27;s apparent death after the Shadow King exploded from his skull, the psychic villain routinely defeats the X-Men until X literally pulls himself back together. He and Psylocke re-try harnessing the power of all of Earth&#x27;s psychics to destroy the Shadow King. As Psylocke says she feels no psychic trace of him anywhere, X wipes the mind of the X-Men and restores Archangel back to Angel. Only Psylocke&#x27;s memory is left intact, with X telling her she will be the one to “keep him honest” and watch over him in case the Shadow King returns. X then states that he has no desire to return to the school, as it was Charles Xavier&#x27;s dream, and that as X he has a new dream.

=== Matthew Rosenberg run (2018) ===
Matthew Rosenberg and artist Greg Land would take over the series for the next five issues. Rather than rebooting the series again with a new #1 issue, Rosenberg requested that the issue count continued where Soule&#x27;s run left off. Rosenberg&#x27;s run would center around Havok, Beast, Warpath, Dazzler, Colossus and Banshee, who deal with the return of the Reavers.

Rosenberg would also write an annual issue, a one-off which focused on the surviving members of the original X-Men: Jean Grey, Beast, Archangel, Iceman, and X.

==== &quot;Until Our Hearts Stop&quot; (issues #13–17) ====
Havok and Beast are attacked by the Reavers as the former tries to recruit the latter into forming a new team of the X-Men. They are rescued by Banshee, who had been under Beast&#x27;s care at Harvard, and Warpath, who had been dispatched to keep an eye on Havok. They then recruit Colossus and Dazzler, only to get attacked by a group they believe to be Reavers. However, after defeating them in battle, realize that they were fighting government agents.

Havok and Warpath separate from the rest of the group, who in turn get kidnapped by the government agency known as O.N.E. While under capture, the X-Men realize that dangerous experiments are being conducted on mutants. Havok joins forces with the Reavers and manage to infiltrate O.N.E.&#x27;s base, but are greeted with an attack by Sentinels. The Reavers then reveal that they can now integrate and absorb technology. After integrating with the Sentinels, the Reavers then turn on The X-Men but are defeated. Havok eventually surrenders himself to O.N.E. for the damage he has done, but forges a deal saying that he will take sole responsibility to clear his other teammates of federal charges, in return for not revealing to the world all of the experiments happening at O.N.E.&#x27;s headquarters. His teammates vow to free him.

==== &quot;Astonishing X-Men Annual&quot; #1 ====
In &quot;Astonishing X-Men Annual&quot; #1, a revived Jean Grey reunites with the surviving members of the original X-Men - Beast, Archangel, and Iceman - at the restaurant where Professor Xavier first took them to celebrate their first mission. Jean reflects on the sacrifices each have made and wonders if it was worth getting revived in the first place. They are soon joined by X, who surprises the members with his appearance and new form. X takes the four to a town whose residents are under the control of Lucifer. Lucifer is eventually killed by Archangel, which consequently kills the entire townspeople.

Jean, Beast, Archangel and Iceman are horrified by the mission&#x27;s outcome, but X explains that this is why they became X-Men in the first place: to save the world or watch its inhabitants perish. He only wishes the X-Men can find mere bits of happiness in their lives, and then wipes their memories of the incident. The next day, the four have their reunion again, but it is a more joyous occasion than the day before.

=== Film ===
* The &quot;Gifted&quot; story arc from Joss Whedon and John Cassady&#x27;s run on &quot;Astonishing X-Men&quot; was partially adapted in the 20th Century Fox film &quot;X-Men: The Last Stand&quot; (2006), part of the &quot;X-Men&quot; film series. In the film, Warren Worthington II discovers that his son, eventual X-Men member Warren Worthington III / Angel is a mutant, leading to Worthington Labs producing and administering a &quot;cure&quot; in the present designed to suppress the X-gene, and creating a moral divide within the mutant community. Certain mutants such as Rogue are tempted to take it due to the destructive nature of their abilities, while others like Magneto organize to revolt against its development, fearing for its potential to be weaponized against the entire mutant race. During a raid on a mobile prison by the Brotherhood of Mutants to free and recruit Juggernaut, Mystique is hit by a dart with the cure intended for Magneto, permanently ridding her mutant shapeshifting abilities and leading Magneto to abandon her. Magneto and the Brotherhood later intend to attack Alcatraz to track and kill Jimmy, a mutant with the ability to nullify other mutants&#x27; powers whose genome is being used to synthesize the serum. The X-Men engage with the Brotherhood in a final battle, during which Wolverine distracts Magneto as Beast injects him with the cure, suppressing his magnetism abilities. In the aftermath, peaceful mutant and human co-existence is achieved, with Beast being appointed as a community ambassador to the United Nations, while Rogue, having taken the cure, is able to become more intimate in her relationship with Iceman.
* Wolverine&#x27;s appearance in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) film &quot;Deadpool &amp; Wolverine&quot; (2024) is modeled after his yellow and blue suit featured in the Whedon / Cassady run on &quot;Astonishing X-Men&quot;, albeit with sleeves covering the character&#x27;s biceps.

=== Television ===
* The team lineup and character designs of the X-Men roster in the animated series &quot;Wolverine and the X-Men&quot; draw inspiration from the &quot;Astonishing X-Men&quot; comics.

<doc id="734041" wikidata="Q679913" url="?curid=734041" title="Helmholtz Association">
<text>The Helmholtz Association of German Research Centres () is the largest scientific organisation in Germany. It is a union of 18 scientific-technical and biological-medical research centers. The official mission of the Association is &quot;solving the grand challenges of science, society and industry&quot;. Scientists at Helmholtz therefore focus research on complex systems which affect human life and the environment. The namesake of the association is the German physiologist and physicist Hermann von Helmholtz.

The annual budget of the Helmholtz Association amounts to €5.8 billion, of which about 70% is raised from public funds. The remaining 30% of the budget is acquired by the 19 individual Helmholtz Centres in the form of contract funding. The public funds are provided by the federal government (90%) and the rest by the States of Germany (10%).

The Helmholtz Association was ranked #6 in 2022 by the Nature Index, which measures the largest contributors to papers published in 82 leading journals.

==Members==
Members of the Helmholtz Association are:
* Alfred Wegener Institute for Polar and Marine Research (&quot;Alfred-Wegener-Institut für Polar- und Meeresforschung&quot;, AWI), Bremerhaven
* Helmholtz Center for Information Security, CISPA, Saarbrücken
* German Electron Synchrotron (&quot;Deutsches Elektronen-Synchrotron&quot;, DESY), Hamburg
* German Cancer Research Center (&quot;Deutsches Krebsforschungszentrum&quot;, DKFZ), Heidelberg

* Max Delbrück Center for Molecular Medicine in the Helmholtz Association (&quot;Max-Delbrück-Centrum für Molekulare Medizin in der Helmholtz-Gemeinschaft&quot;, MDC), Berlin-Buch
* Helmholtz-Zentrum Dresden-Rossendorf (HZDR) formerly known as &quot;Forschungszentrum Dresden-Rossendorf&quot; (FZD) changed 2011 from the Leibniz Association to the Helmholtz Association of German Research Centers, Dresden
* Helmholtz Center for Ocean Research Kiel (GEOMAR) formerly known as Leibniz Institute of Marine Sciences (IFM-GEOMAR), Kiel

Helmholtz Institutes are partnerships between a Helmholtz Center and a university (the institutes are not members of the Helmholtz Association themselves). Examples of Helmholtz Institutes include:

* Helmholtz Institute for RNA-based Infection Research (HIRI), Würzburg, established in 2017

== Programme structure ==
The works of the centers are categorised into programmes, which are divided into six research groups. The Helmholtz centers are grouped according to which research group they belong to:
* Energy includes contributions from DLR, KIT, FZJ, GFZ, HZB, HZDR, IPP. Topics are Renewable energies, energy efficient conversion, nuclear fusion and nuclear safety.
*Earth and environment is studied at AWI, DLR, FZJ, KIT, HZI, GEOMAR, GFZ, HZG, HMGU, UFZ. Topics are &quot;the changing earth&quot;, &quot;marine, coastal and polar systems&quot;, atmosphere and climate, biogeosystems and the topic &quot;terrestrial environment&quot;. Helmholtz Earth &amp; Environment unites its research under the program &quot;Changing Earth - Sustaining our Future&quot; and has established the synthesis and communication platform Helmholtz SynCom. SynCom brings together scientific knowledge and connects science, society, and politics to address global environmental challenges.
*Health is studied at the DKFZ, FZJ, KIT, HZI, DZNE HZG, HMGU, GSI, HZB, HZDR, MDC, and UFZ. This includes cancer research, cardio-vascular and metabolic disease research, nervous system, infection and immunity, environmental health studies, comparative genomics for human health.
*Key Technologies are studied at FZJ, KIT, HZG. In a single topic there is cooperations of the HZB.
*Structure of Matter is studied at DESY, FZJ, KIT, HZG, GSI, HZB, HZDR. Topics are elementary and astroparticle physics, hadrons and nuclear physics, PNI-research (research with Photons, Neutrons and Ions), aeronautics, space and transport research.
*Aeronautics, Space and Transport is studied at DLR. Major research topics are mobility, information systems and communication.

== The Helmholtz Climate Initiative ==

Eight of the above-mentioned Helmholtz centers are part of the &quot;Helmholtz Climate Initiative Regional Climate&quot; (in German: &quot;Regionale Klimainitiative&quot;) REKLIM in order to tackle the interactions between atmosphere, sea ice, ocean and land surfaces. These interactions determine the climate of the Earth. Detailed observations and process studies are combined within the initiative. For the funding period 2009-2013 the REKLIM-initiative has a budget of 32.2 million Euro.
In this funding period, the program is divided into seven topics, each of the topics is organized in various work-packages.
# Coupled modelling of regional earth systems. Model regions are the Arctic and Europe. Highly resolved regional model are used to simulate atmosphere, ocean, sea ice, ice sheets, land surface, soil, vegetation, aerosol chemistry and other components on a regional scale.
# Sea-level changes and coastal protection. The effects of glacier and ice-stream dynamics, the response of the ocean on heating and melt water run-off are studied in particularly for Greenland.
# Regional climate changes in the Arctic Forcing and long-term effects at the land-ocean interface
# The land surface in the climate system
# Chemistry-climate interactions on global to regional scales
# Extreme weather events Storms, heavy precipitation, floods and droughts
# Socio-economics and management Climate change adaptation and mitigation strategies
In the second funding period (2011–2015), three additional topics have been added.

== Open access ==
The Helmholtz Association was one of the initial signatories of the 2003 Berlin Declaration on Open Access to Knowledge in the Sciences and Humanities. This commitment towards open access publishing of scientific research was then formally approved by its Assembly of Members, an assembly of the directors of the Helmholtz Centers. In a September 2004 Resolution the Assembly adopted the following commitment: &quot;Publications from the Helmholtz Association shall in future, without exception, be available free of charge, as far as no conflicting agreement with publishers or others exists.&quot; While the Helmholtz Association has no strict open access mandate. The Helmholtz Association encourages gold open access, while green open access is promoted through institutional repositories of the individual Helmholtz Centers. To further the idea of open science, the Helmholtz Association maintains the Helmholtz Open Science Coordination Office.

<text>La Baie (, ) is one of three boroughs in the city of Saguenay, Quebec, Canada. It was created during Quebec&#x27;s municipal reorganization in 2002. From 1976 to 2001, it was known as the Town of La Baie, a municipality composed of the Grande-Baie, Bagotville and Port-Alfred sectors.

It is located on the bank of the Ha! Ha! Bay (French: &quot;baie des Ha! Ha!&quot;) at the mouths of the Ha! Ha! River (French: &quot;rivière Ha! Ha!&quot;) and the Mars River (French: &quot;rivière à Mars&quot;). La Baie was the first colony built in the Saguenay-Lac-St-Jean region. It was founded by the Société des Vingt et un who settled the area in 1838. The depth of the banks of the Ha! Ha! Bay&#x27;s waterways facilitated the rapid development of the region&#x27;s largest harbour facilities after the railways were built in 1910.

The borough&#x27;s main sources of socio-economic development have been the logging and the pulp and paper industries since the nineteenth and twentieth centuries respectively. Aluminum production began in the early 1980s. After the Abitibi-Consolidated paper mill, one of the main employers of the borough, shut down in 2004, Saguenay&#x27;s elected officials decided to invest in La Baie&#x27;s tourism industry by building and operating a port of call for cruise ships in 2008.

Bagotville Airport, the main civilian airport in Saguenay-Lac-St-Jean, is also located in La Baie. The Canadian Forces Base Bagotville, which shares the same airfield, is one of only two Canadian military bases that use the Royal Canadian Air Force&#x27;s CF-18 fighters. The military base is the borough&#x27;s largest employer.

While Chicoutimi and Jonquière, the two boroughs that constitute the main urban core of Saguenay, are located close to each other, La Baie is at a moderate distance from the city centre. This has created some unique issues for the borough — for example, while a full-power television or radio station in Saguenay can serve the entire city from a single transmitter without difficulty, La Baie is distant enough from the city&#x27;s urban core that some low-power broadcasters, such as CKAJ-FM, have had to add separate transmitters to rebroadcast their signals in La Baie.

== History ==

=== Exploration of Ha! Ha! Bay ===
The Saguenay&#x27;s nomadic Innu tribes once inhabited La Baie. The Chicoutimians lived on the banks of the Saguenay River well before European colonization. Unlike important meeting places like Chicoutimi, Ha! Ha! Bay was far from portages to Saint-Jean Lake (French: &quot;lac St-Jean&quot;) and was not frequented by First Nations or the region&#x27;s first explorers.

Although it was not on eighteenth century fur trade routes, Ha! Ha! Bay was used by the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company&#x27;s commercial fishing boats at the mouths of the Ha! Ha! (Wissuscoué) and Mars (Vasigamenke) Rivers.

In 1828, the Crown mandated land surveyor J.-B. Proulx to explore the bay area; he later reported on its hilly landscapes and logging potential. Colonization was impossible during this period since the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company held exclusive rights to natural resources in the region since 1821, a monopoly which would only expire in 1842. It was popular pressure from Charlevoix and especially La Malbaie that led to the tenuous beginnings of colonization in the Saguenay region. After an 1829 report demonstrating the fertility levels of the region&#x27;s soil, a petition asking for permission to settle the Saguenay region began to circulate in La Malbaie. The government refused it and ordered further explorations of the region between 1829 and 1836, hoping to find a land link between Ha! Ha! Bay and Baie-Saint-Paul. A second petition was launched in 1835, which led to the government and the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company to finally cede cutting rights to a company from La Malbaie called the Société des Vingt et un.

The company&#x27;s schooner sailed from La Malbaie on April 25, 1838, and made several stopovers along the banks of the Saguenay. After setting up temporary camps near Tadoussac, they built their first sawmill at L&#x27;Anse St-Jean. Their goal was to reach Ha! Ha! Bay to build a permanent facility.

=== Bagot Township and the evolution of Grande-Baie and Bagotville ===
The Société des vingt et un arrived in what is now the Grande-Baie sector on June 11, 1838. After surveying the forest and assessing its potential, the colonists built the first lock on the Ha! Ha! River. In October of that same year, they completed the first sawmill and created the foundation of what would become Grande-Baie. The first families arrived during the fall, and jack pine and Eastern white pine logging operations began in 1839. The hydraulic power of the two main rivers, Ha! Ha! and Mars, and the bay&#x27;s tributaries was used to run several sawmills. Mars Simard, a resident of Baie-Saint-Paul, opened his own sawmill on the Mars River and founded Bagotville, the bay&#x27;s second settlement. Colonists from Baie-Saint-Paul moved to the new outpost, while those from La Malbaie preferred Grande-Baie, which had 110 inhabitants in 1839.

The Société des Vingt et un began to struggle after it lost two years worth of cutting when log-booms breached in 1840 and 1841. Their main purchaser, an English wood merchant named William Price, acquired all of the company&#x27;s shares in 1842. He also bought the Mars Simard sawmill in 1843, making Price the owner of every sawmill in lower Saguenay.

The end of the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company&#x27;s exclusive lease allowed the lawful colonization of the Saguenay region to begin. The territory organized itself independently and Jean-Baptiste Duberg was mandated to survey land for the new Bagot Township (named after Sir Charles Bagot) and divide county seats for the new constituency. Duberg was also responsible for mapping a road to Chicoutimi during the summer of 1842, which would eventually become Saint-Jean-Baptiste Boulevard and Grande-Baie Nord Boulevard.
The Bagot Township was structurally unique since its population was concentrated in two areas: Bagot Village (Grande-Baie) and Bagot Town (Bagotville). John Kane, a land agent originally sent by the government to collect fees for use of Crown lands, became the township&#x27;s first mayor in 1850. The Province of Canada created the counties of Tadoussac and Chicoutimi in 1844.

The region&#x27;s first school was built between the Ha! Ha! and Mars Rivers to serve the bay&#x27;s two population hubs. The clergy began to register the population of Grande-Baie in 1842 and Bagotville in 1845. On October 15, 1844, the Oblates arrived in Grande-Baie to found a mission. A fire destroyed most of the township in 1846. The parishes of Saint-Alexis-de-Grande-Baie and Saint-Alphonse-de-Bagotville were canonically erected in 1857 and 1861 respectively. In 1851, the population around Ha! Ha! Bay reached 2,438; they mostly depended on logging and agriculture for their livelihoods.

Grande-Baie built its first post office in 1855, and was proclaimed a municipality in 1860. Bagotville became incorporated in 1876 and Grande-Baie followed suit in 1908. Agriculture began to develop rapidly during the 1850s and focused mainly on cereal production. The blueberry harvest was also an important activity until the arrival of railways in Chambord near St-Jean Lake in 1888.

An economic downturn occurred during this period and demand decreased for Saguenay timber. In 1856, there were twenty-six small sawmills around the bay, in addition to the main ones on the Ha! Ha! and Mars Rivers. The slowdown during the 1870s led many mills to shut down or convert from pine to spruce. Even though the logging industry experienced difficulties, the dairy industry flourished; by 1894, the number of cheese factories had increased to six.

St-Urbain Road was opened in 1870 and connected Grande-Baie to Baie-Saint-Paul. Telegraphs linked the two towns in 1880. In 1859, the first jetty was built on Ha! Ha! Bay in Bagotville. Three years later its first quay was built, which was later purchased by the Canadian government in 1876. Bagotville&#x27;s marine facilities, which were mainly used by Canada Steamship Lines, added a shipyard in 1853.

=== Industrialization of Port-Alfred and the development from 1900 to 1976 ===

The Saguenay region experienced a new phase of economic development after the arrival of railways in Chicoutimi in 1893. Journalist Joseph-Dominique Guay and banker Julien-Édouard-Alfred Dubuc founded the Compagnie de Pulpe de Chicoutimi in 1898. Because its activities soon became too extensive for Chicoutimi&#x27;s port facilities, the company&#x27;s directors decided to build a loading port on the Ha! Ha! Bay to ship pulp. The Ha! Ha! Bay railway was built in 1909 to facilitate transport to the quay in Bagotville. The first train shipment was on December 13, 1910.

Some sawmills had difficulty staying afloat before the arrival of large industry. Price Sawmills, the largest on both the Ha! Ha! and Mars Rivers, closed their doors in 1904 and 1912 respectively. However, other sectors of the forest industry were booming. From 1902 to 1913, the Battle Island Company operated a pulp debarking factory in Anse-à-Benjamin.

Several municipal infrastructure projects were built in the 1910s. Bagotville&#x27;s first water system was completed in 1913. Soon macadam was used to pave the roads around Bagotville&#x27;s Saint-Alphonse Church. In 1915, the municipal council adopted a by-law that implemented the use of electric lights. Highway 381 was opened that same year.
Plans for a chemical pulp plant on Ha! Ha! Bay were drawn up by the Compagnie de Pulpe de Chicoutimi in 1914. The company&#x27;s director, J.-É.-A. Dubuc, travelled to Europe to attract capital. Although he found investors in England, the volatility caused by World War I delayed investment until 1916. Ha! Ha! Bay Sulphite Company Limited was founded that very year to make the chemical pulp plant a reality. Two hydroelectric power stations were built on the Ha! Ha! River to supply the plant. In 1917, the company purchased two lots from Grande-Baie totalling five square kilometres. Construction of the Port-Alfred plant began on June 12, 1916, and was completed August 30, 1917. On December 4 of that same year, the Saint-Édouard Parish was founded in Port-Alfred just prior to a formal request to separate the plant&#x27;s land from Grande-Baie on December 29.

The plant began operating on April 18, 1918. Four days later, the village of Port-Alfred was founded. In 1918, Bagotville organized its own police force. Industrialization, urbanization, and the construction of over fifty homes in Port-Alfred officially changed the new village&#x27;s status and it became Ha! Ha! Bay&#x27;s first town on September 5, 1919. Bagotville obtained the same status on January 7, 1920.

Since the beginning of the 1910s, the bay area&#x27;s population had doubled to 6,600 by 1921. Meanwhile, the pulp and paper industry suffered a crisis of overproduction, leading to the rapid bankruptcy of the Compagnie de Pulpe de Chicoutimi and the disposal of the Ha! Ha! Bay Sulfite Company on June 30, 1922. It was succeeded by the Bay Sulfites Company Limited, which was also disposed in 1923.
On July 26, 1924, the Port-Alfred Pulp and Paper Corporation acquired the plant and began converting its production from chemical to paper pulp in 1925. Alcan purchased Port-Alfred&#x27;s port and rail facilities in 1926 after the disposal of the Compagnie de Pulpe de Chicoutimi. The docks were converted so they could load bauxite for the new aluminum smelter in Arvida.

The community continued to grow despite the economic difficulties of the Canadian pulp and paper industry in 1928. Canada Power and Paper Corporation acquired the Port-Alfred mill and suspended its activities on October 31, 1930. In 1927, the increasing population led to the opening of new schools in Port-Alfred such as the Bagotville Boys&#x27; Academy (French: &quot;Académie des garçons de Bagotville&quot;) and the Saint-Édouard College (French: &quot;Collège Saint-Édouard&quot;). The newly created Consolidated Paper Corporation bought the Port-Alfred paper mill on August 28, 1930, and reopened it on June 8, 1932. The mill was closed again from 1933 to 1934, which was followed by seventy years of stability. Another forest industry company, the Scieries Saguenay, opened a plant in Bagotville in 1935.

The Great Depression led to the construction of public works like the Port-Alfred and Bagotville Town Halls. Many bay area residents turned to agriculture during this period of economic uncertainty. Credit unions were established in Grande-Baie in 1927, Port-Alfred in 1933, and Bagotville in 1936. In addition to the maritime traffic in Alcan&#x27;s Port-Alfred port facilities, Bagotville&#x27;s quay became Canada Steamship Lines&#x27; water terminal in the Saguenay region from 1930 to 1938.

During the Second World War, the Canadian government and the Allies trained pilots and built several bases including one in Bagotville in 1942. The base was responsible for training pilots and protecting the Arvida aluminum smelter and the regions&#x27; dams until October 1944. The base was shut down in 1945. In 1945, Bagotville&#x27;s civilian airport was run by Canadian Pacific Air Lines.

From 1946 onward, new services such as public transportation linked Ha! Ha! Bay communities from the Bagotville terminal. The Voice of La Baie (French: &quot;La Voix de la Baie&quot;) newspaper began publication in 1948. The uneven expansion and development of the bay&#x27;s three urban centres and two rural sectors led to the first municipal mergers in 1953. The Village of Grande-Baie was absorbed by Port-Alfred. That same year, the new Saint-Marc-de-Bagotville Parish was established in Bagotville. Nearly a decade later, Notre-Dame-de-La-Baie Parish was founded in Port-Alfred in 1967. The Ha! Ha! Bay Hospital (French: &quot;Hôpital de la baie des Ha! Ha!&quot;) opened its doors in 1970.

The Cold War led to the reopening of the Bagotville military base in July 1951. Four chase squadrons were stationed there, including the 413th and 414th until 1953, the 440th until 1957, and the 432nd until 1961. Their mission was to intercept any intrusion in the Canadian northeast. In 1962, the 425th squadron was stationed in Bagotville with CF-101 Voodoo interceptors. It was responsible for protecting the 22nd NORAD. In 1958, Air Canada and Québec Air began scheduling flights from Bagotville Airport.

Municipal mergers in the Ha! Ha! Bay became an increasingly pressing issue and was the most important intermunicipal political debate of the 1960s. Bagotville and Port-Alfred&#x27;s mayors, Hervé Tremblay and Laurier Simard, strongly opposed each other on the issue. It was ultimately the Quebec government that forced the merger in 1974 with the Act Concerning Certain Outaouais and Upper Saguenay Municipalities (French: &quot;Loi concernant certaines municipalités de l&#x27;Outaouais et du Haut-Saguenay&quot;). The letters patent were issued December 10, 1975, for the merger on January 1, 1976.

=== Town of La Baie (1976–2001) ===

The Town of La Baie was founded on January 1, 1976. It was the result of the merger of the Towns of Bagotville and Port-Alfred and the Parish Municipalities of Grande-Baie and Bagotville. Since the first municipal elections were only scheduled for November 1977, a temporary municipal council was appointed. The leaders of the merged municipalities sat on an administrative council; city hall alternated between the mayors of Bagotville and Port-Alfred. After the 1977 elections, Laurier Simard, the former mayor of Port-Alfred, became the Town of La Baie&#x27;s first mayor.

The Grande-Baie aluminum smelter was built between 1977 and 1982. Alcan spent nearly a billion dollars building the plant that opened on September 15, 1981. The Saguenay Fjord National Park was created in 1983 to open the Saguenay Fjord to tourists. That same year, the relocation of the Port of Chicoutimi to Grande-Anse began, moving the port from Ha! Ha! Bay to the Saguenay River. The Grande-Anse Maritime Terminal was inaugurated in October 1986. The Bagotville military base put its first CF-18s in operation in December 1984. These planes replaced the CF-101 Voodoos that had been used since the 1960s.

For La Baie&#x27;s celebrations of the 150th anniversary of the first colony in Grande-Baie, the &quot;Théâtre du Palais municipal&quot; presented the first season of the historical extravaganza called The Amazing History of a Kingdom (French: &quot;La Fabuleuse Histoire d&#x27;un royaume&quot;). On November 25 of that same year, Quebec was hit by the Saguenay earthquake, measuring 6.25 on the Richter magnitude scale.

==== Saguenay Flood ====
From July 18 to 21, 1996, a major depression resulted in 260 mm of rain falling within a fifty-hour period on the Laurentian Wildlife Reserve and the Saguenay-Lac-Saint-Jean region. The soil, which was already oversaturated after a particularly rainy month, could not absorb the excess water from the Saguenay River&#x27;s drainage basins. The heavy rainfall rapidly increased the discharge from the Ha! Ha! Bay&#x27;s tributaries&#x27; river basins and other Saguenay waterways. The first signs of disaster appeared on the night of July 18 to 19. Land erosion caused a house in Grande-Baie to be ripped apart and sewers located near the banks of the Ha! Ha! River began to back up. The Ha! Ha! and Mars Rivers&#x27; discharges quickly became dangerous and blocked access to the bridges that crossed them. The situation was at its lowest point when a dam on Ha! Ha! Lake ruptured and washed away central Grande-Baie.

La Baie, and especially the Grande-Baie sector, was the town that was the most heavily hit by the Saguenay Flood. Fifty million dollars were required to rebuild public infrastructure and an additional thirty million were needed to stabilize the Ha! Ha! and Mars riverbanks. The railways were heavily damaged, which paralyzed the city&#x27;s economy, cut off drinking water supplies, and isolated areas east of the Mars River. Transportation to lower Saguenay was impossible, leaving sectors of Port-Alfred and Grande-Baie completely isolated.

Reconstruction of the Grande-Baie sector and the development of the commemorative Ha! Ha! Park began in 1997. The Ha! Ha! Pyramid was built in 1998 and officially inaugurated in 2000.

Uniboard built the Panneaux MDF La Baie Inc. plant in 1997, which made medium-density fibreboard out of wood residue. In 2001, rumours about the Abitibi-Consolidated mill in Port-Alfred shutting down began to surface after eighty-nine people were laid off.

As 2002 approached, the Town of La Baie began opposing the Quebec government&#x27;s plan for municipal mergers after the Department of Municipal Affairs published a white paper called Municipal Reorganization: Changing the Way We Do Things to Better Serve Citizens (French: &quot;La Réorganisation municipale: changer les façons de faire pour mieux server les citoyens&quot;) on April 25, 2000. Some of La Baie&#x27;s elected officials expressed opposition to the imminent municipal mergers in the Saguenay region by joining Laterrière in refusing to sit on transition committees. Despite this, the mergers were officialized and the November 25, 2001, municipal elections for borough representatives were held for the new city of Saguenay.

=== City of Saguenay and the La Baie Borough ===

La Baie was merged into the City of Saguenay on January 1, 2002.
Despite everything that was proposed and done to keep the Abitibi-Consolidated mill open in Port-Alfred, it was temporarily shut down on December 10, 2003, as part of a major restructuring plan. It was officially closed on January 26, 2004; 640 jobs were lost. Having learnt from its difficult and costly experience while trying to save the Gaspésia paper mill, the Quebec government withdrew from plans to reopen the plant in 2005. The mill was demolished in 2006.

Two years after the mergers, the Quebec government allowed merged municipalities to hold public consultations starting on May 16, 2004, to organize demerger referendums to be held on June 20, 2004. Although La Baie was the centre of demerger support in Saguenay at the time, demerger support was not widespread enough to affect the borough&#x27;s status. By the May 21, 2004, deadline, only fifty of the required 1,502 signatures were missing to hold a referendum.

Since its creation in 2002, the City of Saguenay, Promotion Saguenay, and the Quebec government have worked together to increase tourism in the La Baie Borough by building port facilities for cruise ships. Originally, these groups had planned to develop Port-Alfred&#x27;s Powell Quay and the Grande-Anse Maritime Terminal and set up a shuttle service. However, it was eventually Bagotville&#x27;s Algélias-Lepage Quay that was selected for the installation of cruise ship facilities because of the shorter disembarkation distance and increased safety for the boat passengers. After the Office of Public Hearings on the Environment (French: &quot;Bureau d&#x27;audiences publiques sur l&#x27;environnement&quot;) held consultations, work began in August 2007 despite a small opposition movement to the project in 2006. The quay welcomed its first ships in September 2008.

== Geography ==
=== Territory ===

La Baie is located in the eastern part of the city of Saguenay. It lies between upper and lower Saguenay and surrounds Ha! Ha! Bay. The borough borders the Saguenay River to the north, Saint-Félix-d&#x27;Otis to the east, Ferland-et-Boilleau to the southeast, La Zec Mars-Moulin to the south, the Laterrière sector to the southwest, and the Chicoutimi Borough to the west.

La Baie is or 23% of Saguenay&#x27;s total area. The urbanized zone is located on the mouths of the Ha! Ha! and Mars Rivers. Urbanized areas cover only a small part of the bay area and the neighbouring plateaus.

Like the Saguenay Fjord&#x27;s steep relief, altitude rises sharply from the bay&#x27;s shores, particularly on the northwest banks. Overlooking the bay, the Centennial Cross (French: &quot;Croix du centenaire&quot;) is from the shore and is located on the des Écorceurs Cove at an altitude of . On the other side of the bay is Mount Bélu, which has an altitude of . The town&#x27;s outskirts stretch along a fluvial terrace down the Ha! Ha! and Mars Rivers toward Chicoutimi and Laterrière and go all the way to the Laurentians. The plateaus to the east and southeast are flat enough for both agriculture and large infrastructure such as the Bagotville Airport and the Grande-Baie aluminum smelter.

The borough&#x27;s soil is clayey like much of the Saguenay region because of river-ice deposits in the ravines that face the bay. There are seventy-one scars from old landslides in the La Baie Borough&#x27;s urban core.

=== Climate ===
Like most cities alongside the Saguenay River and east of St-Jean Lake, La Baie has a continental climate that is milder than the surrounding Laurentian Plateau. La Baie has an average annual temperature of with temperatures varying between . Even though it is located on the same latitude as warmer European cities such as Paris or Vienna, La Baie has long, cold winters and short, mild summers.

The borough receives an average of of rain and of snow annually. July is the rainiest month while February is the driest. Skies are overcast 60 to 65% of the time; the borough has an average of 1,720 hours of sunshine per year.

During the winter, the average thickness of the ice on Ha! Ha! Bay is . Icebreakers keep the Saguenay River open for ships until Port-Alfred, where tides can reach up to .

== Demographics ==
The La Baie Borough is the fourth largest urban centre in Saguenay-Lac-Saint-Jean (after Chicoutimi, Jonquière, and Alma) with 7% of the region&#x27;s total population. Over half of the region&#x27;s population lived there before 1860. Upper Saguenay and Saint-Jean Lake were settled later and experienced much faster rates of population growth. The population of La Baie was soon surpassed by Chicoutimi, which eventually became the region&#x27;s capital.

The La Baie Borough lost 6.5% of its population between 1991 and 2006. It experienced the largest demographic decline of the city of Saguenay; the entire city lost 4.4% of its population during the same period. Even though the Abitibi-Consolidated mill closed in 2003, the population decline has slowed since 2001. The population decreased by 5.3% from 1996 to 2001 and by 1.5% from 2001 to 2006. La Baie also contains the city&#x27;s youngest families.

It is the most sparsely populated Saguenay borough with 75 inhabitants per km2. According to the 2006 census, it had 19,639 inhabitants, 7,755 households, and 5,635 families. The most densely populated sector is Port-Alfred with 117.4 inhabitants per km2.

According to Statistics Canada, 97.4% of the population is francophone and 0.7% of the population is anglophone. Immigrants make up less than 1% of the population.

In 2006, 9.9% of the population over the age of fifteen had a university diploma (bachelor&#x27;s or higher), 38.8% had a CEGEP diploma, and 18.8% had a high school diploma. In 2001, 32.4% of the population over the age of fifteen had not completed high school, which is the highest percentage of all three of Saguenay&#x27;s boroughs.

The average per capita income is $24,107. The average household income is $50,119. The sector with the highest per capita income is Grande-Baie at $28,319, and the sector with the lowest is Port-Alfred at $21,462.

== Borough ==

The La Baie Borough, which was created on February 18, 2002, accounts for 3 of 19 electoral districts and 13.3% of the city&#x27;s voters. It is governed by a borough council that elects a president who also serves as one of three municipal councillors. The borough&#x27;s director and clerk of court hold the other two municipal council seats. Council meetings are held once a month and are open to the public. They are held at the La Baie Borough Office in the Bagotville sector, which once housed La Baie&#x27;s town hall.

The La Baie Borough Council oversees urban planning, traffic flows, snow removal, the road system, firefighting, socioeconomic, community, and cultural development, parks, and recreation around the Ha! Ha! Bay.
=== Administrative history ===

=== Residential districts and urban planning ===

According to Statistics Canada, in 2006 the La Baie Borough contained 8,112 dwellings, 7,763 or 95.7% of which were principal residences while 4.3% were second residences. The percentage of dwellings built after 1986 was 22.7% or 1,840 new dwellings, which is slightly above the Saguenay average of 22.1%. Among inhabited dwellings, 6.8% need major repairs, which is 0.1% higher than the city mean. The average value of the borough&#x27;s dwellings is $103,131, which is lower than the city average of $116,559.

Most residences (45.8%) were single-family dwellings. Semidetached houses represented 6.8% of residences, while 2.9% were row houses and 18.2% were duplexes. Apartment buildings with less than five stories accounted for 23.2% and those with more than five stories were 0.2%. Rental units constituted 37% of dwellings (2,870) and owned dwellings made up 63% (4,890).

=== Politics ===

The federal riding of Chicoutimi—Le Fjord represents the borough&#x27;s 15,051 voters. La Baie, which contains 20% of the riding&#x27;s voters, has lost political clout to the more populous Chicoutimi Borough that shares the same Member of Parliament.

Chicoutimi—Le Fjord&#x27;s current MP is Richard Martel of the Conservative Party.

At the provincial level, the La Baie Borough represents 41% of voters in the Dubuc riding.

The riding has been represented by the Quebec Liberal Party MNA Serge Simard since 2014.

La Baie&#x27;s economy used to depend on logging and wood processing, which contributed the area&#x27;s expansion during the twentieth century. Since the closure of Port-Alfred&#x27;s Abitibi-Consolidated mill in 2004, the borough&#x27;s main economic drivers have been the Rio Tinto Alcan aluminum smelter in Grande-Baie (684 employees) and the Bagotville military base (1,200 soldiers and 250 civilians). Overall, there are sixty-one businesses in thirty-four fields of activity. According to Statistics Canada, 56% or 9,085 of the borough&#x27;s residents were part of the labour force in 2006. The 2006 unemployment rate was 8.5%. Workers from outside the borough come mainly from Chicoutimi, Jonquière, and the lower Saguenay region. More the half of the labour force of Saint-Félix-d&#x27;Otis and Ferland-et-Boilleau work in La Baie.

==== Primary and secondary sectors ====

===== Agriculture and the dairy industry =====

Despite the harsh terrain around Ha! Ha! Bay, the plateaus that extend toward Laterrière and Chicoutimi and overhang Grande-Baie are fertile enough to produce small quantities of cereals and oleaginous plants. Truck farming is practised in fields and in greenhouses. La Baie also contains a tree nursery and a greenhouse for grass farming. Fodder crop production is important for supporting the borough&#x27;s dairy industry. Deer and cattle farming are also practised.

&quot;L&#x27;écohameau de La Baie&quot; was founded in 1990 by the &quot;Groupe de recherches écologiques de la Batture&quot; (GREB). It includes an organic farm (&quot;Vallons de Chambreule&quot;) and six single-family ecological homes. For a long time, it was the only certified organic farm in Saguenay. In 2000, it was the first farm in Saguenay-Lac-Saint-Jean to offer Community-supported agriculture (community-supported agriculture) baskets.

Milk production is still the main agricultural activity. The borough contains twenty-one dairy farms that are members of the Fédération des producteurs de lait du Québec. There are two major milk processing companies in the borough: &quot;La Laiterie de La Baie&quot;, which employs seventy people and accounts for 25% of the region&#x27;s dairy market and the &quot;Fromagerie Boivin&quot; which uses between 12 and 17 million litres of milk a year to manufacture Cheddar cheese. &quot;Les bergeries du Fjord&quot; make a sheep&#x27;s milk cheese.

===== Logging =====

The logging and wood substance processing industries generated 1,172 jobs in 2002. The 2004 closure of the Abitibi-Consolidated paper mill led to the direct or indirect loss of 780 jobs, totalling 30 million dollars in lost wages. The MDF La Baie plant, which was founded in 1996 and employs 120 people, had to cut eighty jobs in 2007 and 2008 because of the decreased demand for MDF panels.

Outside of large industry, La Baie&#x27;s logging sector includes small- and medium-sized businesses involved in forest management and wood transportation. Some local sawmills include the &quot;Scierie Armand Tremblay &amp; Fils&quot; and the &quot;Scierie Gauthier&quot;, which is the oldest business in the Saguenay-Lac-Saint-Jean region. After the Abitibi-Consolidated-owned &quot;Scierie Saguenay&quot; closed in 2005, it transferred most of its fifty employees to the Saint-Fulgence sawmill. Several small businesses manufacture wood into end items such as kitchen cabinetry, furniture, roof framing, and flooring.

===== Quarries, non-ferrous materials, and chemicals =====
Although La Baie does not have any mines, granitic rock is extracted in Grenville Province, particularly Laurentian granite and gneiss. These quarries contain polychrome, an architectural stone used in the World Financial Centre in New York, the Canadian Museum of Civilization in Ottawa, Ontario, Canada and the Ronald Reagan Building and International Trade Centre in Washington&#x27;s Federal Triangle. The borough&#x27;s other quarries specialize in crushed, building, and landscaping stone.

Other minor industrial activities include glass-cutting, the production of plastic and chemical derivatives (such as cleaners and industrial degreasers), PVC window frames, and asphalt.

===== Metals =====

In 2002, aluminum production at the Rio Tinto Alcan plant in Grande-Baie combined with metal fabrication and machining generated 1,147 jobs in the borough. The Grande-Baie aluminum smelter, which opened its doors in 1980, employs 684 people and produces 196,000 tonnes of aluminum annually. Nearly 40% of the plant&#x27;s employees live in the borough. Related industries such as aluminum fabrication, structural framing, and iron frame production are also essential to La Baie&#x27;s economy.

===== Commerce =====

The borough&#x27;s market potential is estimated at 220 million dollars. Despite the presence of the &quot;Galeries de La Baie&quot; shopping centre, which employs 185 people, and Victoria Street, the borough&#x27;s main commercial artery, La Baie has the smallest area of commercial influence. Along with Dolbeau-Mistassini, La Baie&#x27;s residents are the least likely in the region to shop in their own neighbourhood. Even though the borough is closer to the lower Saguenay area and is linked there by a direct road, Chicoutimi is the region&#x27;s most popular shopping destination.

===== Institutions =====


The Canadian Forces Base Bagotville is the borough&#x27;s main employer. It has 1,584 permanent and temporary employees, including the 837 military families of 3 Wing. It brings 100 million dollars to the area, including 65 million dollars in salaries and 11 million dollars of federal investment in La Baie and the Saguenay-Lac-St-Jean region. The airbase&#x27;s control tower is managed by Nav Canada, which also collects weather data.

Other federal institutions in the borough include a Department of Public Works and Government Services office inside the Bagotville base and a Human Resources and Skill Development office offering immigration and employment services. There is also a Community Futures Development Corporation office, an organization that focuses on community economic development.

The borough&#x27;s provincial institutions include a &quot;Centre local d&#x27;emplois&quot;, a &quot;Carrefour jeunesse emploi&quot;, and a Société de l&#x27;assurance automobile du Québec branch. The Dubuc MNA&#x27;s riding office is also located in the borough.

=== Transportation ===

==== Automobile ====
A provincial highway and two interregional highways cross La Baie. The main road, Highway 170, runs from Highway 70 (which junctions with Highway 175) to Chicoutimi and Port-Alfred. It becomes an interregional highway along Ha! Ha! Bay toward lower Saguenay. The other interregional highway, the &quot;Route du petit Parc&quot; (Highway 381), begins at Port-Alfred and heads toward Ferland-et-Boilleau. These interregional roads both connect the Saguenay-Lac-Saint-Jean region to Charlevoix. The only intermunicipal highway is Saint-Jean-Baptiste Boulevard, which becomes Grande-Baie Nord Boulevard (Highway 372) on the eastern edge of the borough. It connects Rivière-du-Moulin in Chicoutimi to Bagotville.

Automobile traffic in the borough passes mostly on Highway 170. The stretch between Bagotville Airport and Grande-Baie is used by 10,000 automobiles daily. Between Grande-Baie and lower Saguenay, it drops to 2,500 to 5,000 automobiles. The Petit Parc (Highway 381) in direction of Ferland-et-Boilleau is used by 1,000 to 2,500 vehicles per day and the ligne Bagot (Grande-Anse Road) between Bagotville Airport and the Grande-Anse Maritime Terminal is travelled by fewer than 1,000 vehicles a day. In 2000, 5% of vehicles from outside the region came from the Laurentian Wildlife Reserve (Highway 175) and 30% from lower Saguenay using Highway 170. Over 1,000 heavy vehicles drive between La Baie and Chicoutimi every day using only this road. Fewer than 500 heavy vehicles a day come from lower Sagenay and Ferland-de-Boilleau.

Public transportation in the borough is provided by the City-owned Société de transport du Saguenay (STS). Two bus lines link the Chicoutimi and La Baie terminals: the &quot;Via Saint-Jean-Baptiste&quot; line that uses Highway 372 and the &quot;Via Aéroport&quot; that goes by Highway 170. Three bus lines from the La Baie terminal serve the borough year-round and one during the winter. The &quot;Des Érables via Centre d&#x27;achats&quot; line travels to the Bagotville sector, the &quot;Polyvalente de La Baie via Avenue du Parc&quot; to Port-Alfred, and the &quot;Boulevard de la Grande-Baie Sud&quot; to Grande-Baie. The fourth bus line, &quot;Chemin Saint-Louis&quot;, travels along Saint-Louis Road during the wintertime.

Cyclists can travel through La Baie using Route Verte 8. The bicycle path enters La Baie by De la Grande-Baie Nord Boulevard and reaches Laurier-Simard Quay, where it stretches six kilometres along Ha! Ha! Bay.

==== Maritime ====

The La Baie Borough has two deep-water ports:
* The port facilities in Port-Alfred at the end of Ha! Ha! Bay; and
* The Grande-Anse Maritime Terminal (Port of Saguenay) located outside of Ha! Ha! Bay on the Saguenay River, on the north shore of Cap-à-l&#x27;ouest.

Port-Alfred is the largest port in the Saguenay-Lac-Saint-Jean region and has been owned by Alcan since 1924. It is the main entryway for the natural resources the region&#x27;s aluminum smelters require. In 2006, 5.5 million tonnes of raw and manufactured material passed through these installations.

The Compagnie de Pulpe de Chicoutimi built the first port facilities on the Ha! Ha! Bay in the early twentieth century. Port-Alfred&#x27;s mill and deep-water port made shipping pulp overseas much easier than Chicoutimi&#x27;s port facilities, which were limited by the Saguenay River&#x27;s shallow northern arm. The Port-Alfred Quay was opened in 1915. In 1924, the Compagnie de Pulpe de Chicoutimi&#x27;s bankruptcy forced the company to sell its transportation infrastructure including the Port-Alfred port facilities to Alcan. The port was redeveloped to be able to receive bauxite and other materials needed for aluminum production and for shipping the Port-Alfred Pulp and Paper Corporation&#x27;s newsprint. Duncan Quay was completed in 1938 and Powell Quay in 1948. Since 1976, icebreakers have kept Port-Alfred&#x27;s port facilities accessible year-round. In 2000, Alcan entrusted the management of Powell Quay to the Saguenay Port Authority.

Port Alfred&#x27;s Quays:

Duncan Quay: Rio Tinto Alcan has owned Duncan Quay since its construction in 1938. This quay imports raw material and exports aluminum. It is 386 metres long, has two berths, and is 11.9 metres deep at low tide. It is connected to a railway. It can accommodate ships of over 69,000 tonnes.

Powell Quay: The Saguenay Port Authority has owned Powell Quay since 2000. It mainly exports finished goods and secondary processing products overseas and imports Alcan&#x27;s liquid bulk. Before Abitibi-Consolidated closed in 2003, the quay also exported newsprint. It is 347 metres long, has four berths, and is 10 to 10.9 metres deep at low tide. A railway also passes through the quay. It can accommodate ships of over 69,000 tonnes.

Between 130 and 140 ships dock at Port-Alfred each year. They mainly originate from bauxite-exporting countries like Brazil, Ghana, and Guinea and carry bauxite, petroleum coke, sodium hydroxide, fuel oil, and fluorite. The port also exports most of the aluminum ingots produced in the region&#x27;s four smelters.

The Grande-Anse Maritime Terminal (Port of Saguenay) is the only publicly owned port in Saguenay-Lac-Saint-Jean. It is a member of the Association of Canadian Port Authorities. It originally imported hydrocarbons but it progressively began transporting forest products, general merchandise, and liquid and dry bulk. In 2000, its annual total capacity increased to 600,000 tonnes.

It was originally built in 1985 to offset the closure of the port in Chicoutimi and to relocate oil tanks outside of the city&#x27;s downtown area. The Grande-Anse Maritime Terminal received its letters patent in 1999 from the Canadian government and became the Saguenay Port Authority (Port of Saguenay).

Marcel-Dionne Quay: The quay was named after Marcel Dionne, the federal Member of Parliament for Chicoutimi—Le Fjord from 1979 to 1984. It is 286 metres long, has two berths and is 13.8 metres deep at low tide. It is open year-round and can accommodate ships of over 100,000 tonnes.

Since 2004, the Grande-Anse Maritime Terminal has complied with the International Ship and Port Facility Security Code, allowing it to receive foreign ships.

==== Rail ====

Although railways were built in Chicoutimi by 1893, locomotives did not arrive in Bagotville until 1910. The Compagnie de Pulpe de Chicoutimi created an affiliate in 1909, the Compagnie de chemin de fer de la Baie des Ha! Ha!, to build a railway linking the Chicoutimi pulp mill to the quay in Bagotville. The line was originally part of the Roberval-Saguenay rail network. Alcan bought the railway in 1925 after the Compagnie de Pulpe de Chicoutimi&#x27;s bankruptcy the previous year. It used the railway to bring raw materials from Port-Alfred to its aluminum smelter in Arvida. The rail network expanded after the construction of new smelters in the region. Tracks were laid in the La Baie Borough to service plants in Grande-Baie and Laterrière.

Every year, 87,700 full boxcars rode to or from Port-Alfred on the Roberval-Saguenay network. The network employed 121 people and used eleven locomotives to transport 7,540,000 tonnes of materials annually.

==== Air ====
Bagotville Airport (YBG) is Saguenay-Lac-Saint-Jean&#x27;s main civilian airport and shares its facilities with 3 Wing Bagotville. It handles 90,000 passengers a year. In 2000, the civilian facilities were given to the City of Saguenay by Transport Canada; Promotion Saguenay manages the airport. Flights to Montreal and other Quebec destinations take off daily. Since 2006 and 2008 respectively, Sunwing Airlines and Air Transat have offered international flights to southern destinations in the winter.

== Culture and society ==

=== Education ===
La Baie&#x27;s first schoolhouse opened in 1841. In the 1920s, these small country schools were replaced by larger institutions in villages and towns. According to authors Luc Noppen and Lucie K. Morisset, &quot;There are still some rare examples, although not always in good shape, on the rural roads located on the town of La Baie&#x27;s territory.&quot;

The first Ha! Ha! Bay school boards were created in the 1860s. The Bagotville School Board (French: &quot;Commission scolaire de Bagotville&quot;) was founded in 1862, followed by school boards in Grande-Baie in 1880 and Port-Alfred in 1918. These three school boards merged in 1960 and became the Ha! Ha! Bay Local School Board (French: &quot;Commission scolaire locale de la Baie-des-Ha! Ha!&quot;).

La Baie has been under the jurisdiction of the Saguenay Riverside School Board (French: &quot;Commission scolaire des Rives du Saguenay&quot;) since 1998. During the 2008–2009 academic year, there were four elementary schools in the borough: the George-Vanier and Sainte-Thérèse Schools in Bagotville, the Médéric-Gravel School in Port-Alfred, and the Saint-Joseph School in Grande-Baie. There are 1,085 elementary students enrolled in these schools. The only high school in the Ha! Ha! Bay area, the &quot;École Secondaire des Grandes Marées&quot; (formerly &quot;Polyvalente de La Baie&quot;), has 1,200 students. The Durocher adult education centre in the Grande-Baie sector has 575 students.

Vocational training is the highest level of education available within the borough. The &quot;Centre de formation professionnelle de La Baie&quot; offers its 138 students training programs in metallurgy, cabinetwork, forestry, and composite materials. The closest post-secondary institutions (CEGEPs and universities) are in Chicoutimi.

The borough also has a branch of the Saguenay public library network located in the same building as the Théâtre municipal.

According to the Institut de la statistique du Québec, the Catholic Church had 18,865 adherents in the borough in 2001, or 96% of the population. The borough is divided into two parishes: Saint-Alexis and Saint-Alphonse, which includes the Saint-Édouard, Saint-Marc, and Notre-Dame-de-la-Baie Churches. Atheists were the second largest group with 460 (2%), followed by Protestants with 240 adherents (1.3%), and other Christian denominations at 135 (0.6%). Ha! Ha! Bay residents practising other religions make up less than 0.1% of the population. The borough has two cemeteries (Saint-Alphonse &amp; Saint-Alexis and Saint-Édouard) managed by the &quot;Corporation des Cimetières Catholiques de La Baie&quot;.

==== Establishment of the Catholic Church in Ha! Ha! Bay ====
Permanent outposts of the Catholic Church in Saguenay-Lac-Saint-Jean were limited to a few missions near Saint-Jean Lake and at the trading post in Chicoutimi until about 1840 when the first colonists arrived in Ha! Ha! Bay. The first chapel was erected in 1842 in Grande-Baie; its first regular priest was Reverend Charles Pouliot. The Catholic Church&#x27;s role as a catalyst for colonization was strengthened with the arrival of the Oblates in 1844. The order repaired the Grande-Baie chapel and served the Chez Mars village (Bagotville). They advocated the building of a church in the Ha! Ha! Bay area, although they only actively participated in the establishment of the Grande-Baie parish council. The Oblates left the region in 1853.

Reverend Léandre Gill was sent by the Church in 1853 to continue where the Oblates left off. He was given a difficult mission: to merge all of the places of worship in Ha! Ha! Bay. Gill was tasked with countering any possible influence from the Protestants who came to work for William Price&#x27;s sawmills. He settled in Saint-Alphose (Bagotville) and served at Saint-Alexis (Grande-Baie) twice a month. The Saint-Alphose-de-Liguori Parish in Bagotville was canonically established in 1857. The two parishes did not have any resident priests until 1858. Grande-Baie&#x27;s Saint-Alexis Parish was founded in 1861.

==== Construction of churches ====
Saint-Alphose-de-Liguori is the first and oldest church in the Saguenay-Lac-Saint-Jean region. It was built in Bagotville between 1860 and 1862. The stone church tower was not built until 1867 and the interior was not completed until 1887. Grande-Baie&#x27;s Saint-Alexis, Ha! Ha! Bay&#x27;s second church, was completed in 1868. In 1902, the Marist Brothers took over the Sainte-Thérèse School in Bagotville, which was located at the northwest intersection of Victoria and De la Fabrique Streets before its current location was built in 1942. The soeurs du Bon-Conseil ran the newly rebuilt Médéric-Gravel School in 1922 after the 1918 original burned down. Two schools for boys were founded in 1927: the Saint-Alphose Academy (French: &quot;académie Saint-Alphose&quot;) in Bagotville and the Saint-Édouard College (French: &quot;collège Saint-Joseph&quot;) in Port-Alfred. They were administered by the Brothers of the Sacred Heart and the Brothers of the Christian Schools respectively.

The third church was opened in May 1930 to replace the Saint-Édouard Chapel in Port-Alfred, which was built for the canonical establishment of the new town in 1918. The Saint-Édouard Church was built in a thirteenth-century English style. A quarter of the construction costs were provided the London financiers that owned the Port Alfred Pulp and Paper Company. The Sisters of Sainte-Marie-de-la-Présentation, who arrived from France in 1934, opened a new convent in Grande-Baie in 1940. In 1948, the Brothers of the Sacred Heart built the Saint-Joseph College in Grande-Baie.

The Saint-Marc Parish in Bagotville, canonically established in 1953, blessed its new church in 1956. Saguenay architect Paul-Marie Côté conceptualized the building that &quot;introduced modernism to Quebec religious architecture in a spectacular way.&quot; In February 2009, the church was named a Quebec historical site by Minister Christine St-Pierre. The decision was retroactive on June 25, 2008.

The fourth and final church built in the bay area was in the Notre-Dame-de-La-Baie Parish in Port-Alfred in 1962. Its wooden frame won a prize in the 1965 Canadian Aesthetic Competition.

=== Health and social services ===
The Ha! Ha! Bay Hospital (French: &quot;Hôpital de la baie des Ha! Ha!&quot;) in the Bagotville sector is the only health and social services centre (CSSS) in the borough. It includes the St-Joseph and Bagotville long-term care centres (CHSLD). It has twenty-five short-term beds and 127 long-term beds. The community clinic (CLSC), which is also in Bagotville, is known as the &quot;Centre Cléophas-Claveau&quot;.

La Baie has three medical clinics, four dental clinics, and a mental health treatment centre called &quot;Le centre de rencontre Le Phare&quot;. It also has &quot;Le havre du Fjord&quot;, a drug and alcohol abuse treatment centre. The &quot;Maison de l&#x27;espoir du Saguenay-Lac-Saint-Jean&quot; assist youths who have family difficulties or have dropped out of school.

=== Arts and entertainment ===

==== Museums ====

The borough contains two museums.
===== Musée du Fjord =====
The Fjord Museum (French: &quot;musée du Fjord&quot;) in the Grande-Baie sector is dedicated to the Ha! Ha! Bay and Saguenay Fjord&#x27;s historical, artistic, and environmental heritage. From 1967 to 1983, it was known as the &quot;Musée Monseigneur-Dufour&quot;. In 1996, the Saguenay Flood caused a considerable amount of damage to the museum. It was reopened in 2004 after being renovated and expanded.

===== The Air Defence Museum =====
The Air Defence Museum on the Bagotville military base is the only military aviation museum in Quebec. It was inaugurated on June 18, 1997, and is located in what was once a Protestant chapel. In the surrounding commemorative park, visitors can see an F-86 Sabre, a CF-100 Canuck, a CT-133 Silver Star, a CF-5 Freedom Fighter, a CF-101 Voodoo, a Piasecki H-21, and a Mig-23ML.

==== Entertainment ====

The borough&#x27;s auditorium, the &quot;théâtre du Palais municipal&quot;, has a capacity of 2,300 people. It is the borough&#x27;s largest amphitheatre and one of the most-used gathering places in Saguenay.

Since 1988, the historical extravaganza &quot;La Fabuleuse Histoire d&#x27;un royaume&quot; has been performed every summer. Music and comedy shows are also presented year-round.

== Sports, parks, and recreation ==

=== Fishing ===

==== Ice fishing ====
Every winter, the ice on Ha! Ha! Bay becomes thick enough to support cabins and vehicles for ice fishing. At the height of the season, there are about 1,000 cabins mainly located around Grande-Baie, Les Battures, and L&#x27;Anse-à-Benjamin. Rockfish, lake smelt, ogac, Atlantic cod, and black turbot are fished there.

==== Salmon fly-fishing ====
The Mars River is located between Bagotville and Port-Alfred. It runs from the mouth of Ha! Ha! Bay to the edges of the Laurentian Wildlife Reserve. It is officially recognized as a salmon river by the federal government and is protected until it reaches the Bec-Scie Outdoors Centre (French: &quot;Centre plein-air Bec-Scie&quot;). It has ninety-two pools and about twenty potential spawning grounds.

Until it reaches the Laurentian Park, the river is maintained by the Mars River Sport Fishing Association (French: &quot;Association des pêcheurs sportifs de la Rivière-à-Mars Inc&quot; (APSRM)). It was founded in 1983 to protect, restore, and promote the Mars River&#x27;s salmon population.

From 1894 to 1935, the Price Brothers Company ran a private club near the river. The construction of the Murailles Dam in 1930 and river driving until 1953 prevented the proliferation of salmon. The river was reseeded in 1976. It was closed to sport fishing in 1985, but was reopened again in 1992. A fishway was constructed after the 1996 deluge that destroyed the original one built in 1986.

Other than salmon, there are seven other fish species found in the river: brook trout, longnose dace, Northern sucker, white sucker, American eel, threespine stickleback, and northern pearl dace.

=== Hockey ===

The Jean-Claude-Tremblay Arena hosts the annual La Baie Pee-Wee hockey tournament. The arena was named after Jean-Claude Tremblay, a Bagotville native and former defenseman for the Montreal Canadiens and the Quebec Nordiques.

=== Parks ===

==== Ha! Ha! River Park ====

The Ha! Ha! River Park is located at the mouth of the Ha! Ha! River in the Grande-Baie sector. It was built three years after the 1996 floods. The park is best known for its main attraction, the Ha! Ha! Pyramid, which was created by artist Jean-Jules Soucy. The Place des Ha! Ha! is located on the river&#x27;s eastern bank in the old riverbed. Many cultural events are held in this municipal park.

==== Mars Park ====

This park is located at the mouth of the Mars River along Mars Street in the Bagotville sector. It contains a six-kilometre pedestrian and bicycle path with a panoramic view of Ha! Ha! Bay.

==== Eucher Trail ====

Eucher (or Eusher) Trail is a walking path along the Philippe Cove and the main capes of the northern shore of Ha! Ha! Bay. The path runs at an altitude of 100 metres.

<doc id="734057" wikidata="Q464023" url="?curid=734057" title="Elsa Schiaparelli">
<text>Elsa Schiaparelli ( , , ; 10 September 1890 – 13 November 1973) was an Italian fashion designer from an aristocratic background. She created the house of Schiaparelli in Paris in 1927, which she managed from the 1930s to the 1950s. Starting with knitwear, Schiaparelli&#x27;s designs celebrated Surrealism and eccentric fashions. Her collections were famous for unconventional and artistic themes like the human body, insects, or trompe-l&#x27;œil, and for the use of bright colors like her &quot;shocking pink&quot;.

Schiaparelli famously collaborated with Salvador Dalí and Jean Cocteau. Along with Coco Chanel, her greatest rival, she is regarded as one of the most prominent European figures in fashion between the two World Wars. Her clients included the heiress Daisy Fellowes and actress Mae West.

==Early life==
Elsa Luisa Maria Schiaparelli was born at the Palazzo Corsini, Rome. Her mother, Giuseppa Maria de Dominicis, was a Neapolitan aristocrat. Her father, Celestino Schiaparelli, a Piedmontese, was an accomplished scholar with multiple areas of interest. His studies focused on the Islamic world and the era of the Middle Ages and he was, in addition, an authority on Sanskrit and a curator of medieval manuscripts. He also served as Dean of the Sapienza University of Rome, where Schiaparelli would herself later go on to study philosophy. His brother, astronomer Giovanni Schiaparelli, had discovered the so-called &quot;canali&quot;, or Martian canals, and the young Schiaparelli often studied the heavens with her uncle. A cousin of the brothers, Ernesto Schiaparelli, was a noted Egyptologist who discovered the tomb of Nefertari and was Director of the Museo Egizio in Turin. 

The cultural background and erudition of her family members served to ignite the imaginative faculties of Schiaparelli&#x27;s impressionable childhood years. She became enraptured with the lore of ancient cultures and religious rites. These sources inspired her to pen a volume of poems titled &quot;Arethusa&quot; based on the ancient Greek myth of the hunt. The content of her writing so alarmed the conservative sensibilities of her parents that they sought to tame her fantasy life by sending her to a convent boarding school in Switzerland. Once within the school&#x27;s confines, Schiaparelli rebelled against its strict authority by going on a hunger strike, leaving her parents with no alternative but to bring her home again.

Schiaparelli was dissatisfied by a lifestyle that, whilst refined and comfortable, she considered cloistered and unfulfilling. Her craving for adventure and exploration of the wider world led to her taking measures to remedy this, and when a friend offered her a post (find/offer someone to fill a job) caring for orphaned children in an English country house, she saw an opportunity to leave. The placement, however, proved unsuitable to Schiaparelli, who subsequently planned a return to the stop-over city of Paris rather than admit defeat by returning to Rome and her family.

=== Marriage ===
Schiaparelli fled to London to avoid the certainty of marriage to a persistent suitor, a wealthy Russian whom her parents favored and for whom she herself felt no attraction. In London, Schiaparelli —who had held a fascination for psychic phenomena since childhood— attended a lecture on theosophy. The lecturer that night was Willem de Wendt, a man of various aliases who was also known as Willie Wendt and Wilhem de Kerlor. He was reported to have legally changed his name in England to Wilhelm Frederick Wendt de Kerlor, a combination of his father&#x27;s last name and mother&#x27;s maiden name. de Wendt&#x27;s profession was that of a tireless, inventive self-promoter, in reality a con man who claimed to have psychic powers, and numerous academic credentials. He alternatively and simultaneously passed himself off as detective and criminal psychologist, doctor, and lecturer. In a stint on the vaudeville stage, de Kerlor billed himself as &quot;The World Famous Dr. W. de Kerlor.&quot; Schiaparelli was immediately attracted to this charismatic charlatan and they became engaged the day after their first meeting. They married shortly thereafter in London on 21 July 1914; Schiaparelli was twenty-three, her new husband, thirty. De Kerlor attempted to earn a living aggrandizing his reputation as a psychic practitioner as the couple subsisted primarily on the wedding dowry and an allowance provided by Schiaparelli&#x27;s wealthy parents. Schiaparelli played the role of her husband&#x27;s helpmate and helped facilitate the promotion of his fraudulent schemes. In 1915, the couple were forced to leave England after de Kerlor was deported following his conviction for practicing fortune-telling, then illegal. They subsequently lived a peripatetic existence in Paris, Cannes, Nice, and Monte Carlo, before leaving for America in the spring of 1916.

The de Kerlors disembarked in New York, initially staying at the Brevoort, a prominent hotel in Greenwich Village, after which they relocated to an apartment above the Café des Artistes near Central Park West. De Kerlor rented offices to house his newly inaugurated &quot;Bureau of Psychology&quot; where he hoped to achieve fame and fortune through his paranormal and consulting work. His wife acted as his assistant, providing clerical support for self-promotions crafted to provide the newspapers with sensational copy, win celebrity, and garner acclaim. During this period de Kerlor came under the surveillance of the Federal government&#x27;s Bureau of Investigation, (BOI) a precursor of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, (FBI), not only for his dubious professional practices but also on suspicion of harboring anti-British and pro-German allegiance during wartime. By 1917, de Kerlor&#x27;s acquaintance with journalists John Reed and Louise Bryant had positioned him on the government radar as a possible Bolshevik sympathizer and Communist revolutionary. Attempting to avoid this unremitting scrutiny, the de Kerlors decamped to Boston in 1918, where they continued their activities as they had done in New York. De Kerlor, an incurable publicity hound, made imprudent admissions to a BOI investigator in prideful support of the Russian Revolution and went so far as to admit to an association with a notorious anarchist, whilst his wife incriminated herself by revealing that she was tutoring Italians in Boston&#x27;s North End on the tenets of Bolshevism, and that she herself had the knowledge to assemble explosive devices. Both were ultimately spared prosecution or deportation, the authorities concluding that such admissions so freely given were more indicative of foolish grandstanding than evidence of individuals who were a threat to society.

Almost immediately after their child, Maria Luisa Yvonne Radha (nicknamed &#x27;Gogo&#x27;), was born on 15 June 1920, de Kerlor moved out, leaving Schiaparelli alone with their newborn daughter. In later years, whenever Gogo asked her mother about her absent father, she was told that he was dead. Schiaparelli apparently made no efforts to bring her husband back or to seek support payments for herself and Gogo. In 1921, the 18-month-old Gogo was diagnosed with polio, which proved a stressful and protracted challenge for both mother and child. Years later, Gogo recalled spending her early years in plaster casts and on crutches, with a largely absent mother whom she barely saw. Fearing that de Kerlor would attempt to gain legal custody of Gogo, Schiaparelli had the child&#x27;s surname legally changed to Schiaparelli prior to their return to France in 1922.

Schiaparelli relied greatly on the emotional support offered her by her close friend Gabrielle &#x27;Gaby&#x27; Buffet-Picabia, the wife of Dada/Surrealist artist Francis Picabia, whom she had first met on board ship during the transatlantic crossing to America in 1916. Following de Kerlor&#x27;s desertion, Schiaparelli returned to New York, attracted to its spirit of fresh beginnings and cultural vibrancy. Her interest in spiritualism translated into a natural affinity for the art of the Dada and Surrealist movements, and her friendship with Gaby Picabia facilitated entry into this creative circle which comprised noteworthy members such as Man Ray, Marcel Duchamp, Alfred Stieglitz, and Edward Steichen. Although technically still married, Schiaparelli took a lover, the opera singer Mario Laurenti, but this relationship was cut short by Laurenti&#x27;s death in 1922 after a sudden illness. Whilst they were together, de Kerlor had purportedly conducted affairs with the dancer Isadora Duncan and the actress Alla Nazimova.

Schiaparelli and de Kerlor were eventually divorced in March 1924. In 1928, de Kerlor was murdered in Mexico under circumstances never fully revealed.

== Return to Paris ==

Following the lead of Gabrielle Picabia and others, and after the death of her lover Laurenti, Schiaparelli left New York for France in 1922. Upon her arrival in Paris, she took an expensive apartment in a fashionable quarter of the city taking on the requisite servants, cook and maid. The self-made associations she formed over the years along with the eminent social position held by her Italian family combined to ensure that she would be embraced by desirable social circles on her return to France.

Although never threatened with destitution as she continued to receive financial support from her mother, Schiaparelli nevertheless felt the need to earn an independent income. She assisted Man Ray with his Dada magazine &quot;Société Anonyme&quot;, which proved short lived. Gaby Picabia then suggested a business enterprise which would be beneficial to herself and Schiaparelli. Connected to the French couturier Paul Poiret through her association with his sister Nicole Groult, Picabia proposed that they sell French couture in America. This proposed project, however, never became a viable enterprise and was abandoned.

== Fashion career ==

Schiaparelli&#x27;s design career was early on influenced by couturier Paul Poiret, who was renowned for jettisoning corseted, over-long dresses and promoting styles that enabled freedom of movement for the modern, elegant and sophisticated woman. In later life, Schiaparelli referred to Poiret as &quot;a generous mentor, dear friend.&quot;

Schiaparelli had no training in the technical skills of pattern making and clothing construction. Her method of approach relied on both impulse of the moment and the serendipitous inspiration as the work progressed. She draped fabric directly on the body, sometimes using herself as the model. This technique followed the lead of Poiret who too had created garments by manipulating and draping. The results appeared uncontrived and wearable.

===House of Schiaparelli ===

Whilst in Paris, Schiaparelli—&quot;Schiap&quot; to her friends—began making her own clothes. With encouragement from Poiret, she started her own business, but it closed in 1926 despite favourable reviews. She launched a new collection of knitwear in early 1927 using a special double layered stitch created by Armenian refugees and featuring sweaters with surrealist images. Although her first designs appeared in &quot;Vogue&quot;, the business really took off with a pattern that gave the impression of a scarf wrapped around the wearer&#x27;s neck. The &quot;pour le Sport&quot; collection expanded the following year to include bathing suits, ski-wear, and linen dresses. Schiaparelli added evening wear to her collections in 1931, using the luxury silks of Robert Perrier, and the business went from strength to strength, in 1935, culminating in a move from Rue de la Paix to acquiring the renowned salon of Louise Chéruit at 21 Place Vendôme, which was rechristened the &quot;Schiap Shop&quot;. Schiaparelli&#x27;s 98-room salon and work studios occupied the distinguished Hôtel de Fontpertuis, built in the 17th century by Pierre Bullet.

Colin McDowell noted that by 1939 Schiaparelli was well known enough in intellectual circles to be mentioned as the epitome of modernity by the Irish poet Louis MacNeice. Although McDowell cites MacNeice&#x27;s reference as from &quot;Bagpipe Music&quot;, it is actually from stanza XV of &quot;Autumn Journal&quot;.

A darker tone was set when France declared war on Germany in 1939. Schiaparelli&#x27;s Spring 1940 collection featured &quot;trench&quot; brown and camouflage print taffetas. Soon after the fall of Paris on 14 June 1940, Schiaparelli sailed to New York for a lecture tour; apart from a few months in Paris in early 1941, she remained in New York City until the end of the war. On her return she found that fashions had changed, with Christian Dior&#x27;s &quot;New Look&quot; marking a rejection of pre-war fashion. The house of Schiaparelli struggled in the austerity of the post-war period. Schiaparelli discontinued her couture business in 1951, and finally closed down the heavily indebted design house in December 1954, the same year that her great rival Coco Chanel returned to the business.

==Later life and death==
In 1954, Schiaparelli published her autobiography &quot;Shocking Life&quot; and then lived out a comfortable retirement between her Paris apartment and her house in Tunisia. She died on 13 November 1973, at the age of 83.

==Notable designs==
Schiaparelli was one of the first designers to develop the wrap dress, taking inspiration from aprons to produce a design that would accommodate and flatter all female body types. Her design, which first appeared in 1930, offered a two-sided model with armholes on each side, brought together in the front of the garment and wrapped and tied at the waistline. Buttons may also have been incorporated into this early version. Initially conceived as beachwear and produced in four colours of tussore silk, the dress was popular with buyers and copied by garment manufacturers as a design for everyday street wear. Some forty years afterwards, this uncomplicated and easy-to-wear design was revisited in the 1970s by the American designer Diane von Fürstenberg.

In 1931, Schiaparelli&#x27;s divided skirt—a forerunner of shorts—shocked the tennis world when worn by Lili de Alvarez at Wimbledon in 1931.

Other innovations included a swimsuit design which incorporated an interior bra with an alluring low-cut back by using hidden straps that crossed in the back and closed around the waist. This design was patented in 1930 and retailed by Best &amp; Company. Other designs were made with detachable elements and reversible sections. Also in 1930, she is credited with having produced the first evening dress with a matching jacket. During Prohibition in the United States, Schiaparelli&#x27;s popularly named &quot;speakeasy dress&quot; provided a hidden pocket for a flask for alcoholic beverage.

===Fastenings===

Schiaparelli is one of the designers credited with offering the first clothes with visible zippers in 1930. Rather than being concealed, zippers became a key element of Schiaparelli&#x27;s designs, visibly fastening necklines and running down sleeves and skirts. She used chunky plastic zippers made from cellulose nitrate, the first semi-synthetic plastic fabric, and cellulose acetate. Along with Charles James, Schiaparelli had arrangements with the manufacturers to promote their zip fasteners, using specific brands depending on where the garment would be sold (such as Éclair for Paris models, Lightning Fastener Co. for London models, and Hookless Fastener Co. zips for American export models).

Schiaparelli was also renowned for her unusual buttons, which could resemble candlesticks, playing card emblems, ships, crowns, mirrors, and crickets; or silver tambourines and silk-covered carrots and cauliflowers. Many of these fastenings were designed by Jean Clemént and Roger Jean-Pierre who also created jewellery for her. In 1936, Schiaparelli was one of the first people to recognise the potential of Jean Schlumberger who she originally employed as a designer of buttons.

===Jewellery===

Schiaparelli&#x27;s output also included distinctive costume jewellery in a wide range of novelty designs. One of her most directly Surrealist designs was a 1938 Rhodoid (a newly developed clear plastic) necklace studded with coloured metallic insects by Clément giving the illusion that the bugs were crawling directly on the wearer&#x27;s skin. During the 1930s her jewellery designs were produced by Schlumberger, Clemént and Jean-Pierre, who also made up designs for buttons and fasteners. Schlumberger&#x27;s jewellery with its inventive combinations of precious and semi-precious stones proved successful, and at the end of the 1930s, he left to launch his jewellery business in New York. Schiaparelli also offered brooches by Alberto Giacometti, fur-lined metal cuffs by Méret Oppenheim, and pieces by Max Boinet, Lina Baretti, and the writer Elsa Triolet. Compared to her unusual couture 1930s pieces, 1940s and 1950s Schiaparelli jewellery tended to be more abstract or floral-themed.

Schiaparelli’s jewelry in the 1930s showcased her penchant for bold material choices, such as glass stones, cabochons, dyed pearls, and iridescent seashells, often assembled in shapes and colors that had not been seen before. Her surrealist influence was evident in pieces like lip-shaped brooches with pearls for teeth and lobster pins. Elsa Schiaperelli was a big fan of Salvador Dali and the Surrealist movement, which noticeably influenced her own designs in the 1930s and 1940s. Schiaparelli presented some of her jewelry at the influential Exposition of Modern Industrial and Decorative Arts in 1925.

===Textiles===

Schiaparelli was noted for her use of innovative textiles which were woven to resemble textures such as tree bark or crepe paper; a plush made to mimic ermine; and novelty prints including a fabric patterned with newspaper clippings. She made garments from crumpled rayon 50 years before Issey Miyake produced similarly pleated and crinkled pieces. Schiaparelli enjoyed playing with juxtapositions of colours, shapes, and textures, and embraced the new technologies and materials of the time. With Charles Colcombet she experimented with acrylic, cellophane, a rayon jersey called &quot;Jersela,” and a rayon with metal threads called &quot;Fildifer&quot;—the first time synthetic materials had been used in couture. Some of these innovations were not pursued further, like her 1934 &quot;glass&quot; cape made from Rhodophane, a transparent plastic related to cellophane. Making clothes from these new and untested fabrics posed unexpected hazards—Diana Vreeland had a Schiaparelli dress melt at the dry cleaners&#x27; after its synthetic fabric reverted to chemical sludge upon contact with the cleaning fluids.

===Artist collaborations===

Schiaparelli&#x27;s fanciful imaginative powers coupled with involvement in the Dada/Surrealist art movements directed her into new creative territory. Her instinctive sensibilities soon came to distinguish her creations from her chief rival Coco Chanel, who referred to her as &#x27;that Italian artist who makes clothes&#x27;. Schiaparelli collaborated with a number of contemporary artists, most famously with Salvador Dalí, to develop a number of her most notable designs. Schiaparelli also had a good relationship with other artists including Leonor Fini, Méret Oppenheim, and Alberto Giacometti.

In 1937 Schiaparelli collaborated with the artist Jean Cocteau to produce two of her most notable art-themed designs for that year&#x27;s Autumn collection. An evening jacket was embroidered with a female figure with one hand caressing the waist of the wearer, and long blonde hair cascading down one sleeve. A long evening coat featured two profiles facing each other, creating the optical illusion of a vase of roses. The embroidering of both garments was executed by the couture embroiderers Lesage.

====Dalí====
The designs Schiaparelli produced in collaboration with Dalí are among her best known. In addition to well-documented collaborations such as the shoe hat and the Lobster, Tears, and Skeleton dresses, Dalí&#x27;s influence has been identified in designs such as the lamb-cutlet hat and a 1936-day suit with pockets simulating a chest of drawers. While Schiaparelli did not formally name her designs, the four main garments from her partnership with Dalí are popularly known as follows:

;Lobster dress
The 1937 Lobster dress was a simple white silk evening dress with a crimson waistband featuring a large lobster painted (by Dalí) onto the skirt. From 1934, Dalí had started incorporating lobsters into his work, including &quot;New York Dream-Man Finds Lobster in Place of Phone&quot; shown in the magazine &quot;American Weekly&quot; in 1935, and the mixed-media &quot;Lobster Telephone&quot; (1936). His design for Schiaparelli was interpreted into a fabric print by the leading silk designer Sache. It was famously worn by Wallis Simpson in a series of photographs by Cecil Beaton taken at the Château de Candé shortly before her marriage to Edward VIII.

;Tears Dress 
The Tears Dress, a slender pale-blue evening gown printed with a Dalí design of &quot;trompe-l&#x27;œil&quot; rips and tears, worn with a thigh-length veil with &quot;real&quot; tears carefully cut out and lined in pink and magenta, was part of the February 1938 &quot;Circus Collection&quot;. The print was intended to give the illusion of torn animal flesh, the tears printed to represent fur on the reverse of the fabric and suggest that the dress was made of animal pelts turned inside out. Figures in ripped, skin-tight clothing suggesting flayed flesh appeared in three of Dalí&#x27;s 1936 paintings, one of which, &quot;Necrophiliac Springtime&quot;, was owned by Schiaparelli; the other two are &quot;The Dream Places a Hand on a Man&#x27;s Shoulder&quot; and &quot;Three Young Surrealist Women Holding in Their Arms the Skins of an Orchestra&quot;. Richard Martin saw the Tears Dress as a &quot;memento mori&quot; produced in response to the Spanish Civil War and the spread of Fascism, declaring that to &quot;tear the dress is to deny its customary decorum and utility, and to question the matter of concealment and revelation in the garment.&quot; He noted that even if the tears in the dress were mere ornament like slashing, the real tears on the veil negated this, offering visual disagreements between reality and pretence.

;Skeleton Dress 
Dalí also helped Schiaparelli design the Skeleton Dress for the &quot;Circus Collection&quot;. It was a stark black crepe dress which used trapunto quilting to create padded ribs, spine, and leg bones.

;Shoe Hat 
In 1933, Dalí was photographed by his wife Gala Dalí with one of her slippers balanced on his head. In 1937 he sketched designs for a shoe hat for Schiaparelli, which she featured in her Fall-Winter 1937–38 collection. The hat, shaped like a woman&#x27;s high-heeled shoe, had the heel standing straight up and the toe tilted over the wearer&#x27;s forehead. This hat was worn by Gala Dalí, Schiaparelli herself, and by the Franco-American editor of the French &quot;Harper&#x27;s Bazaar&quot;, heiress Daisy Fellowes, who was one of Schiaparelli&#x27;s best clients.

===Film costumes===

Schiaparelli designed the wardrobes for several films, starting with the French version of 1933&#x27;s &quot;Topaze&quot;, and ending with Zsa Zsa Gabor&#x27;s outfits for the 1952 biopic of Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec, &quot;Moulin Rouge&quot; in which Gabor played Jane Avril. &quot;Moulin Rouge&quot; won Marcel Vertès an Academy Award for Costume Design, although Schiaparelli&#x27;s role in costuming the leading lady went unacknowledged beyond a prominent on-screen credit for Gabor&#x27;s costumes. Authentically, Gabor&#x27;s costumes were directly based upon Toulouse-Lautrec&#x27;s portraits of Avril.

She famously dressed Mae West for &quot;Every Day&#x27;s a Holiday&quot; (1937) using a mannequin based on West&#x27;s measurements, which inspired the torso bottle for &quot;Shocking&quot; perfume.
==The House of Schiaparelli==
The House of Schiaparelli was first opened in the 1930s at 21 Place Vendôme. After World War II, Elsa Schiaparelli did not manage to find success with her collections. The couture house was shut down on 13 December 1954. In 1957, she created a company mainly for her perfume licences, which is the actual company today. In 2007, Italian businessman Diego Della Valle acquired the company, but it wasn&#x27;t until Marco Zanini was appointed in September 2013 that details of the brand&#x27;s revival became public. The house has been nominated for a return to the Chambre Syndicale de la Haute Couture list of members, and presented its first show since nomination in January 2014. Schiaparelli, using a hyper-exclusive business strategy, is to sell its first collection exclusively at a by-appointment boutique in Paris. Following the appointment of Daniel Roseberry as Creative Director, the brand has experienced greater notoriety and success especially through dressing celebrities for the red carpet. The company is now moving towards luxury Ready-to-wear.

==Legacy==
The failure of her business meant that Schiaparelli&#x27;s name is not as well remembered as that of her great rival Chanel. But in 1934, &quot;Time&quot; placed Chanel in the second division of fashion, whereas Schiaparelli was one of &quot;a handful of houses now at or near the peak of their power as arbiters of the ultra-modern haute couture...Madder and more original than most of her contemporaries, Mme Schiaparelli is the one to whom the word &#x27;genius&#x27; is applied most often&quot;. At the same time &quot;Time&quot; recognised that Chanel had assembled a fortune of some US$15m despite being &quot;not at present the most dominant influence in fashion&quot;, whereas Schiaparelli relied on inspiration rather than craftsmanship and &quot;it was not long before every little dress factory in Manhattan had copied them and from New York&#x27;s 3rd Avenue to San Francisco&#x27;s Howard Street millions of shop girls who had never heard of Schiaparelli were proudly wearing her models&quot;.

In 2022, Schiaparelli was included in Ferren Gipson&#x27;s book exploring feminine arts and feminist art.

==Perfumes==

Schiaparelli&#x27;s perfumes were noted for their unusual packaging and bottles. Her best-known perfume was &quot;Shocking!&quot; (1936), contained in a bottle sculpted by Leonor Fini in the shape of a woman&#x27;s torso inspired by Mae West&#x27;s tailor&#x27;s dummy and Dalí paintings of flower-sellers. The packaging, also designed by Fini, was in shocking pink, one of Schiaparelli&#x27;s signature colours which was said to have been inspired by Daisy Fellowes&#x27; &quot;Tête de Belier&quot; (Ram&#x27;s Head) pink diamond.

Other perfumes included:

* &quot;Salut&quot; (1934)
* &quot;Souci&quot; (1934)
* &quot;Schiap&quot; (1934)
* &quot;Sleeping&quot; (1938)
* &quot;Snuff&quot; (for men; 1939)
* &quot;Roi Soleil&quot; (1946)
* &quot;Zut!&quot; (1948)

== Family ==
Schiaparelli&#x27;s two granddaughters, from her daughter&#x27;s marriage to shipping executive Robert L. Berenson, were model Marisa Berenson and photographer Berry Berenson. Both sisters appeared regularly in &quot;Vogue&quot; in the early 1970s. Berry was married to the actor Anthony Perkins, with whom she had two children, the actor Oz Perkins and the musician Elvis Perkins. In 2014, Marisa collaborated with Hubert de Givenchy to publish the book &quot;Elsa Schiaparelli&#x27;s Private Album&quot; which reproduced photographs from her grandmother&#x27;s personal archives. Elsa is the niece of astronomer Giovanni Schiaparelli.

<text>George Lange Kelly (September 10, 1895 – October 13, 1984), nicknamed &quot;Long George&quot; and &quot;High Pockets&quot;, was an American professional baseball first baseman. He played most of his Major League Baseball (MLB) career for the New York Giants (1915–1917, 1919–1926), but also played for the Pittsburgh Pirates (1917), Cincinnati Reds (1927–1930), Chicago Cubs (1930), and Brooklyn Dodgers (1932). Kelly threw and batted right-handed, and was listed as a lanky tall—the source of his nicknames—and .

Kelly was a two-time World Series champion (1921 and 1922). He led the National League in home runs once (1921) and runs batted in twice (1920 and 1924), and was elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1973. However, his selection is regarded as controversial, as many believe he was undeserving of the recognition and was only elected by the Veterans Committee because it consisted of his former teammates.

==Playing career==
Kelly began his professional career for the Victoria Bees of the Class-B Northwestern League in 1914 and 1915. During the 1915 season, he was purchased by the New York Giants from Victoria for $1,200 (equal to $ today). The Giants were rebuilding their team, and they saw Kelly as a possible replacement for Fred Merkle. However, he played sparingly for the Giants in his first MLB seasons, appearing in only 17 games in 1915 and 49 games in 1916. He was selected off waivers by the Pittsburgh Pirates on July 25, 1917, to back up Honus Wagner, but did not hit sufficiently. The Pirates waived Kelly, and he was reclaimed by the Giants from the Pirates on August 4, 1917. The Giants optioned Kelly to the Rochester Hustlers of the Class-AA International League, where he played the rest of the 1917 season. Kelly did not play professionally in 1918 due to his military service. The Giants sold Kelly to Rochester before the 1919 season to acquire Earl Smith.

Finding success in Rochester, Kelly was purchased by the Giants in 1919 when Hal Chase was suspended. He became a regular in the Giants line-up in 1920, when he had a league-leading 94 runs batted in (RBI). He led the league in assists and putouts in 1920 and 1921; his 1,759 putouts in 1920 remains a league record. Kelly batted in 100 or more runs for four consecutive seasons and hit for a batting average of .300 or higher six consecutive seasons. He opened the 1921 season with at least one hit and one RBI in eight consecutive games, a record that stood until it was broken by Jorge Cantú in 2010. The Giants appeared in the World Series in 1921, 1922, 1923, and 1924, winning in 1921 and 1922. Kelly set a National League record with seven home runs in six consecutive games in 1924, which has since been matched by Graig Nettles, Walker Cooper, and Willie Mays.

In the final series of the 1924 season, the Giants were playing the Philadelphia Phillies at the Polo Grounds and battling for the pennant with the Brooklyn Dodgers. Jimmy O&#x27;Connell offered Phillies shortstop Heinie Sand $500 to intentionally lose the games. Sand rejected the bribe and reported it to Phillies manager Art Fletcher. It eventually led to the lifetime suspension of O&#x27;Connell and Giants coach Cozy Dolan by Commissioner Kenesaw Mountain Landis. O&#x27;Connell implicated Kelly, Frankie Frisch, and Ross Youngs as co-conspirators. However, Commissioner Landis cleared Kelly, Frisch, and Youngs of any wrongdoing.

That following offseason, Kelly, Sam Bohne, and other Major League Baseball (MLB) players agreed to play professional basketball with O&#x27;Connell. National League (NL) president John Heydler insisted that anyone who played with O&#x27;Connell could be suspended. The Giants were also displeased with Kelly&#x27;s arrangement, as they were concerned about the chance he could injure himself in non-baseball activity. However, Kelly had not played in any games at that point. He was removed from the roster and thus avoided suspension by MLB.

Kelly, naturally a first baseman, saw regular time as a second baseman in 1925 when Frisch injured his hand, while backup Bill Terry began playing first base. With the emergence of Terry, who requested a trade so that he could receive more playing time, and Giants manager John McGraw desiring an improvement in the outfield, Kelly was traded to the Cincinnati Reds prior to the 1927 season for Edd Roush. The Reds traded Roush due to a contract dispute. With Wally Pipp at first base for the Reds, Kelly was slated to play center field. The Reds released Pipp before the 1929 season, and Kelly returned to first base.

Kelly was released by the Reds on July 10, 1930, and signed by the minor-league Minneapolis Millers of the Class-AA American Association. The Millers traded Kelly to the Chicago Cubs for Mal Moss and a player to be named later (Chick Tolson) late in the 1930 season to fill in for the injured Charlie Grimm. Kelly was released by the Cubs in February 1931. He returned to the Millers for the 1931 season, and participated in a tour of Japan along with Frisch, Lou Gehrig, Mickey Cochrane, Al Simmons, Lefty Grove, and Rabbit Maranville, among others.

In April 1932, the Millers traded Kelly to the Brooklyn Dodgers for Pea Ridge Day. With the Dodgers, he filled in for the injured Del Bissonette. Kelly played his final MLB game on July 27, 1932. He returned to the International League to finish the 1932 season with the Jersey City Skeeters, and played the 1933 season for the Oakland Oaks of the Pacific Coast League before retiring.

==Player profile==
In 1,622 games over 16 seasons, Kelly posted a .297 batting average (1,778-for-5,993) with 819 runs, 337 doubles, 76 triples, 148 home runs, 1,020 RBI, 65 stolen bases, 386 bases on balls, a .342 on-base percentage, and a .452 slugging percentage. He finished his career with a .992 fielding percentage at first base, his primary position, and a .991 fielding percentage overall playing also at second base and all three outfield positions. In 26 World Series games from 1921 to 1924, he batted .248 (25-for-101) with 11 runs, 2 doubles, 1 home run, 11 RBI, and 5 walks.

Kelly was known as an excellent defensive first baseman. His positioning and footwork on hits to the outfield became the standard method for teaching future first basemen to handle relays. Frisch considered Kelly the finest first baseman he had seen.

Kelly also had a reputation as a clutch hitter. McGraw said there was no player he preferred to have bat in a big situation. Waite Hoyt considered him dangerous in clutch situations.

==Hall of Fame induction==


To be inducted into the National Baseball Hall of Fame, a player must receive at least 75% of the vote from the Baseball Writers&#x27; Association of America (BBWAA) or the Veterans Committee. Kelly was on the BBWAA ballot seven times, never coming close to being elected, and never garnering more than 1.9% of the vote. By year, voting results for Kelly were: 1947 (one vote, 0.6%), 1948 (two votes, 1.7%), 1949 (one vote, 0.7%), 1956 (two votes, 1.0%), 1958 (two votes, 0.8%), 1960 (five votes, 1.9%), and 1962 (two votes, 0.6%). Despite the lack of support from the BBWAA, he was inducted into the Hall of Fame in 1973 by the Veterans Committee. At the time of Kelly&#x27;s election, the writers&#x27; ballot was voted on by approximately 400 writers, while the Veterans Committee had a membership of 12 former players and executives.

The selection of Kelly was controversial, as many felt Kelly was not worthy of enshrinement in the Hall. According to the BBWAA, the Veterans Committee was not selective enough in choosing members. Charges of cronyism were levied against the Veterans Committee. When Kelly was elected, the Veterans Committee included two of his former teammates, Bill Terry and Frankie Frisch, who also shepherded the selections of teammates Jesse Haines in 1970, Dave Bancroft and Chick Hafey in 1971, Ross Youngs in 1972, Jim Bottomley in 1974, and Freddie Lindstrom in 1976. This led to the Veterans Committee having its powers reduced in subsequent years. In 2001, baseball historian Bill James, while ranking Kelly as the 65th greatest first baseman of all time, also cited Kelly as the worst player in the Hall of Fame.

==Coaching career==
Kelly served as a coach for the Cincinnati Reds, managed by former teammate Chuck Dressen, from 1935 to 1937. Former teammate Casey Stengel hired Kelly to coach the Boston Braves from 1938 to 1943. He returned to the Reds&#x27; coaching staff in 1947 and 1948. He coached the Oakland Oaks of the Pacific Coast League in 1949. In 1954, Kelly managed the independent Wenatchee Chiefs in the Western International League.

==Personal life==
A native San Franciscan, Kelly remained in the San Francisco Bay Area, living in Millbrae, California, following his playing career. Kelly&#x27;s brother, Ren Kelly, uncle, Bill Lange, and cousin, Rich Chiles, also played in MLB.

Kelly suffered a stroke on October 5, 1984, and died on October 13 at Peninsula Hospital in Burlingame, California. He is interred at the Holy Cross Cemetery in Colma, California. He was the last surviving member of the 1921 and 1922 world champion New York Giants.

Jaques-René, one of his sons, was the second seigneur of Varennes. Five seignories later composed the Varennes parish. They were the seignories &quot;du Cap de Varennes, de l&#x27;île Sainte Thérèse, de Grand Maison, du Cap de la trinité&quot; and &quot;du Cap Saint-Michel&quot;. The town was captured by the British in 1760 during the Montreal Campaign.

<doc id="734069" wikidata="Q65449" url="?curid=734069" title="Georg Leibbrandt">
<text>Georg Leibbrandt (6 September 1899 – 16 June 1982) was a German Nazi Party official and civil servant. He occupied leading foreign policy positions in the Nazi Party Foreign Policy Office (APA) and the Reich Ministry for the Occupied Eastern Territories (RMfdbO) as an expert on issues relating to Russia. Both agencies were headed by Nazi chief ideologist Alfred Rosenberg. Leibbrandt was a participant at the 20 January 1942 Wannsee Conference, at which the genocidal Final Solution to the Jewish Question was planned. In the postwar period, criminal proceedings against Leibbrandt were initiated, but the case was ultimately dismissed.

== Early life ==
Leibbrandt was born to ethnic German parents in Hoffnungstal (today, Tsebrykove, Ukraine), near Odesa, in the Russian Empire. His primary language was German. He attended secondary schools in Dorpat (today, Tartu), Vero (today, Võru) and Odesa. He excelled at foreign languages, learning Greek, Latin, Russian, Ukrainian and, later, French and English. In 1918, he served as an interpreter for the German occupation troops in Ukraine. Following their withdrawal at the end of the First World War, he emigrated to Germany during the resumption of hostilities in the Ukrainian War of Independence. His experiences at this time, including the loss of family members during forced resettlements and purges, left him with a deep sense of anti-Bolshevism.

In Germany, Leibbrandt studied theology, history and philosophy at the universities of Marburg, Tübingen and Leipzig where he was awarded a doctorate (Ph. D.) in 1927. While a student, he was a member of the Wingolf Christian fraternity. He earned a living as a language tutor and an interpreter for foreign visitors, and spent time in Paris and London attending lectures on international law and international relations. 

Leibbrandt traveled extensively, including visits to Canada, the U.S., Switzerland and three trips to the Soviet Union in 1926, 1928 and 1929. During his visits, he was variously represented as a doctor of philosophy, a post-graduate student, a professor of history, and an employee of the Institute for the Study of Germans Abroad (Deutsches Ausland Institut) in Stuttgart. The official purposes of his visits were the study of the history and development of German colonies in the Black Sea coastal region, and the gathering of historical information. As a result of his work, a book regarding emigrant movement of the Germans was published in Germany. Leibbrandt&#x27;s talent for languages, coupled with a Rockefeller Foundation scholarship, enabled him to resume his studies in Paris and the United States from 1931 to 1933. While in the US, he actively kept contact with Germans from Russia who had also immigrated to America.

== Nazi Party career ==
=== Party Foreign Affairs Office ===
Leibbrandt&#x27;s work brought him to the attention of Alfred Rosenberg, the Nazi Party&#x27;s chief ideologist who headed the Party&#x27;s Foreign Policy Office (APA). He requested that Liebbrandt return to Germany and offered him a position with his organization on condition that he become a Party member. His membership was approved on 20 September 1933, retroactive to 1 July, (membership number 1,976,826) and he was named head of the Eastern Division of the APA with the Party rank of &quot;Reichsamtsleiter&quot;. Liebbrandt succeeded in bringing together various associations of Russian Germans and uniting them in the League of Germans from Russia (&quot;Verband der Deutschen aus Russland&quot;). This was done to quantify their numbers, to keep track of them and to provide a pool of individuals who could be trained to perform political tasks in the east. 

Within the APA, Leibbrandt was placed in charge of anti-Soviet and anti-Communist propaganda. Predicated on the Nazi ideology of German superiority, he published a series of pamphlets entitled &quot;Bolshevism&quot; as well as numerous articles in the Party newspaper, &quot;Völkischer Beobachter&quot; that expounded on the supposed connection between &quot;Jewishness&quot; and Bolshevism. He also wrote numerous speeches for Rosenberg containing strong antisemitic themes, which he also incorporated into his own presentations and writings. His chief ethnographic venture became known as the &quot;Sammlung Georg Leibbrandt&quot; (Georg Leibbrandt Collection). It compiled card indexes of all German communities in the Soviet Union. It also collected information to provide a historical explanation of, and justification for, Germany&#x27;s claim to territory and dominion over German ethnic groups in the east. This laid the groundwork for the occupation and resettlement policies pursued after the invasion of the Soviet Union in June 1941. In 1938, Leibbrandt received an appointment as a &quot;Beisitzer&quot; (lay judge) at the People&#x27;s Court and, in 1940, he became a lecturer at the Friedrich Wilhelm University in Berlin.

=== Reich Ministry for the Occupied Eastern Territories ===
Following the invasion of the Soviet Union, the Reich Ministry for the Occupied Eastern Territories (RMfdbO) was established on 17 July 1941 with Rosenberg as &quot;Reichsminister&quot;. In November, he appointed Leibbrandt as &quot;Hauptabteilungsleiter&quot; (Main Department Leader) of its Political Department. By January 1942, Rosenberg recommended him for a promotion to &quot;Ministerialdirektor&quot;, which took effect in May. Leibbrandt served as the Ministry&#x27;s liaison for Ukrainian, Caucasian, Russian and other groups of émigrés. He established the Sammlung Georg Leibbrandt, which developed an index of literature pertaining to Russian ethnic Germans as well as a library. Its collection was expanded by materials looted from Soviet sources, including over 65,000 volumes from Ukraine. Leibbrandt was personally involved in this plunder, examining library and archival materials in the collections taken from Ukraine by the Reichsleiter Rosenberg Taskforce.

Together with Rosenberg&#x27;s deputy Alfred Meyer, Leibbrandt represented the RMfdbO at the Wannsee Conference of 20 January 1942 that planned the implementation of The Final Solution. There is no record of any comments by Leibbrandt documented in the official minutes of the meeting. However, there are indications that he was aware of the genocide taking place. At a RMfdbO meeting to discuss the treatment of so called &quot;Mischlinge&quot; that was attended by Leibbrandt nine days later, the ministry officials advocated a broad-based definition of Jewishness in order to simplify the racial selection process. Even before Wannsee, on 31 October 1941 for example, Leibbrandt had sent a letter to Hinrich Lohse, the &quot;Reichskommissar&quot; for Ostland, requesting an explanation for Lohse&#x27;s order forbidding the execution of Jews in Liepāja. Lohse replied by asking whether this was &quot;a directive to liquidate all Jews in the East&quot; and whether this should take place &quot;without regard to age and sex and economic interests&quot; affecting the war economy. Leibbrandt&#x27;s deputy Otto Bräutigam responded on 18 December, informing Lohse that &quot;Economic considerations should fundamentally remain unconsidered in the settlement of the [Jewish] problem&quot;.

Leibbrandt also had ongoing conflicts with the other &quot;Reichskommissar&quot; that reported to the RMfdbO, Erich Koch of the Ukraine. Furthermore, &quot;Reichsführer-SS&quot; Heinrich Himmler had long wanted to exert more direct control over the ministry and, in the summer of 1943, he succeeded in persuading Rosenberg to replace Leibbrandt with SS&quot;Obergruppenführer&quot; Gottlob Berger. Leibbrandt left the ministry and joined the &quot;Kriegsmarine&quot; where he remained until the fall of the Nazi regime in May 1945.

== Post-war life ==
Arrested by the British, Leibbrandt was interned at the former Stalag XI-B in Fallingbostel. Released in July 1947, he was arrested again two months later and compelled to testify as a witness at the Ministries Trial of former Nazi foreign policy officials. Interrogated by Robert Kempner, U.S. Assistant Chief Counsel, Leibbrandt said he could not remember the Wannsee Conference, and alleged telling Rosenberg that he &quot;did not share the lunacy&quot;. He remained in Allied custody until finally released in May 1949. In January 1950, he was formally investigated for being an accessory to murder by the Nuremberg-Fürth public prosecutor&#x27;s office but the case was dismissed on 10 August 1950. In 1951, he underwent denazification proceedings at Kiel and he was classified as Category V, &quot;exonerated&quot;. His attempt to obtain employment in the West German Foreign Ministry was unsuccessful.
In 1955, Leibbrandt served as an adviser to German Chancellor Konrad Adenauer on the repatriation of German prisoners of war from the Soviet Union.
He was employed as a lobbyist for the city of Wilhelmshaven and the Friesland district, and he later represented the steel manufacturer Salzgitter AG. He resumed his studies on the subject of Russian German communities, and remained an active member of the &quot;Landsmannschaft der Deutschen aus Russland&quot;, an association of Germans who had been expelled from Russia, until his death in Bonn on 16 June 1982.

In November 1979, the U.S. Justice Department and State Department barred Leibbrandt from entering the United States for his participation in the murder of hundreds of thousands of Jews from 1941 to 1943. His United States travel visa was revoked and his name was placed on the watch lists of the U.S. Immigration Service and State Department.

Leibbrandt has a son of the same name, living in Berlin.

<text>Mount Jefferson is a mountain in the U.S. state of Montana, and is one of the many 10,000+ ft peaks in the Tobacco Root Mountains. The mountain is located in Beaverhead-Deerlodge National Forest. (There is also another Mount Jefferson in Montana, further south, on the Idaho/Montana border.) Hollowtop Mountain is an adjacent, taller peak less than .75 miles (1.2 km) to the north. Over the years, the two summits have had numerous names and elevations recorded on various maps. According to U.S. Geological Survey topographic maps, Mount Jefferson is , while Hollowtop Mountain to the north is .

== Nomenclature ==

The nomenclature for Mount Jefferson has seen considerable change and confusion over the years. A.N. Winchell, in his 1914 report, &quot;Mining Districts of the Dillon Quadrangle&quot;, referred to the highest peak in the Tobacco Roots as &quot;Jefferson Peak, locally called Old Hollowtop.&quot; Since that time the more northerly, and higher, of the two adjacent peaks has usually been called Hollowtop. This naming convention is easily explained upon viewing the dish-shaped northeasterly-trending glacial cirque that occupies the top of Hollowtop peak. Information is scanty before 1914. Peale (1896) referred to Ward Peak, near Pony, and “unnamed high peaks” in the range. Present local terminology places Ward Peak further south, near McAlister. The idea that Lewis and Clark named the ranges along with the rivers cannot be confirmed.

Some earlier, published maps labeled the northern peak as Mt. Jefferson. Confusion may arise from the fact that the horizontal triangulation control station (VABM) named JEFFERSON is located on the southern peak, and this designation is found on many maps.

In 1933, Tansley and others referred to the high point of the range as Mt. Jefferson, at 10,600 ft. The northern peak was labeled Mt. Jefferson on the Gallatin National Forest map of 1937, with an erroneous (but long-perpetuated) elevation of 10,740’ given. The southern peak was called Hollow Top Mountain, at 10,513’. The next year, 1938, the Deerlodge National Forest map dodged the issue: the northern peak received two designations — Hollowtop Mtn. and Mt. Jefferson. The southern peak was labeled with the JEFFERSON control station only.

Reid in 1957 mapped the northern peak as Mt. Jefferson and the southern one as Goat Mountain. In 1960, the Waterloo 15-minute topographic quad showed Mt. Jefferson, to the north, at 10,604’, and the southern one as Hollowtop Mtn (10,513’) with the JEFFERSON control station label. In 1976, the U.S. Board on Geographic Names stated that this was the correct designation.
The 1962 Dillon Quad (1:250,000) labeled the northern peak Hollow Top Mt., and the other one had no designation other than the triangular control station mark. The 1963 Beaverhead National Forest map shows Mt. Jefferson to the north at 10,604’ and the JEFFERSON control station to the south at 10,740’, while the 1970 Deerlodge National Forest map is similar, but with the name Hollowtop Mtn. and no elevation for the southern peak.

Oil Company highway maps from the late 1960s and early 1970s show Hollowtop Mtn. at 10,740’, while the Official Montana Highway Map, from at least 1971 onwards, has Hollow Top Mtn. at 10,604’. As recently as 1976, the Beaverhead National Forest map showed Mt. Jefferson to the north (10,604’) and Hollowtop Mtn. with the JEFFERSON control station to the south.

In 1987, the Interagency Visitors Map of Southwest Montana (produced by the Forest Service, USGS, and State of Montana) shows the northern peak labeled Hollowtop Mtn. (10,604’), and the southern peak is marked Mt. Jefferson and includes the control station label. This is the first map known that shows both names, with Hollowtop north of Mt. Jefferson.

Finally, the 1989 7½-minute quad (Noble Peak) also shows Hollowtop Mountain (10,604’) to the north, with Mt. Jefferson (10,513’) to the south with the control station. Numerous hand-held GPS measurements indicate that these listed elevations are probably accurate.

Apparently no peak has an elevation of 10,740’, and all sources agree that the JEFFERSON triangulation station is on the southern peak. Decades of use would have “Hollowtop” to the north, and perhaps the newer maps reflect this usage. The northern peak is labeled “Hollowtop” and “Hollow Top” on various maps, with a single word somewhat more common.

== Geology ==

Most of the mountain is underlain by the Tobacco Root Batholith, a body of granite intruded about 75 million years ago during the Late Cretaceous Period. The Tobacco Root Batholith is often called a satellite of the much larger Boulder Batholith. Parts of Mt. Jefferson-Hollowtop contain Archean metamorphic rocks. Intrusion of the batholith produced considerable mineralization along northwest-trending faults. The Mammoth Mine, north of Mt. Jefferson-Hollowtop produced more than $2,000,000 in gold over its life (mostly in the 1880s-1910s). The Nicholson Gold Mine, on the west flank of Mt. Jefferson, has been active as recently as the middle 1990s, but no production has been reported. The area of the mine is private property, a patented mining claim.

The bowl-like crest of Hollowtop, best viewed from the towns of Pony, Montana and Harrison, Montana to the east, is not a classical glacial cirque. Snow and perhaps ice certainly accumulated there during the ice age, but scouring typical of a moving glacier is not evident.

<doc id="734085" wikidata="Q138841" url="?curid=734085" title="Beloeil, Quebec">
<text>Beloeil (; ) is a city in Quebec, Canada. It is a suburb of Montreal, on the South Shore and is on the Richelieu River, east of Montreal. According to the official Commission de toponymie du Québec, the name is written Belœil with an oe ligature; however, other sources avoid the ligature, including the Ministry of Municipal Affairs and the town&#x27;s own official website.

The population as of the Canada 2021 Census was 24,107. It is part of the Regional County Municipality of La Vallée-du-Richelieu, within the Administrative Region of Montérégie. It occupies the west shore of the Richelieu River in front of the Mont Saint-Hilaire. Along with the city of McMasterville to the immediate south of Beloeil, and the cities of Mont-Saint-Hilaire and Otterburn Park on the eastern bank of the Richelieu, Beloeil forms an unbroken urban area of over 52,959 inhabitants, which is part of Greater Montreal.

Belœil was created as a village in 1903 and became a ville (city) in 1914, but can trace its history through the parish of Saint-Mathieu-de-Belœil, established in 1772, and the seigneurie de Belœil, founded in 1694. Its name probably derives from the old French expression &quot; !&quot;, meaning &quot;What a beautiful view!&quot;, generally attributed to Jean-Baptiste Hertel, brother of the first seigneur (lord) of Belœil, Joseph-François Hertel de la Fresnière.

==History==
Although there has been evidence found of a prior indigenous peoples&#x27; presence along the Richelieu River, none of it has been found on the territory of Beloeil. Development of the region in the first several decades after the arrival of Europeans in the region was slow, owing to the geographic situation of the Richelieu, which made it a primary avenue of attack from New York toward New France.

The recorded history of Belœil began on 18 January 1694 when Governor Louis de Buade de Frontenac granted Joseph Hertel a seigneurie along the shores of the Richelieu River, which Hertel called the Seigneurie de Belœil. Hertel, unwilling to abandon his military activities, such as the 1704 Raid on Deerfield, never developed the seigneurie, and sold it in 1711 to Charles le Moyne de Longueuil, Baron de Longueuil, whose seigneurie of Longueuil neighboured that of Belœil. Finally, after failed attempts in 1711 and 1723, permanent settlement began in 1725, with dwellers coming mostly from the island of Montreal or from seigneuries along the Saint Lawrence River near Montreal. The low level of development forced local inhabitants to rely on the mission at Fort Chambly, several hours to the south, for their religious needs, and the first mill did not open until the early 1760s.
By 1768, however, the local population had grown to the point where a request to the Bishop of Quebec for the establishment of a mission was successful. In 1772, a presbytery-chapel was completed, and the registry of the parish of Saint-Mathieu-de-Belœil, was opened. The parish received its first resident priest the next year, then, in 1775, François Noiseux became local priest and, under his guidance and with his financing, the parish would build its first church from 1784 to 1787. The parish was canonically erected in 1832 and, after the first half of the nineteenth century saw the growth of a small hamlet around the church, became a parish municipality in 1855. The Saint-Mathieu Church burned and was rebuilt twice (in 1817 and 1895); the third one still stands.

Meanwhile, on 28 December 1848, the portion of the St. Lawrence and Atlantic Railroad linking Montreal to Saint-Hyacinthe opened, passing about south of the church. A station was built, and a second hamlet, Belœil-Station, soon grew around it. This second hamlet attracted upper-class vacationers from Montreal, who built summer homes along the Richelieu river with views of the mountain. The railway bridge between Belœil-Station and Mont-Saint-Hilaire was, in 1864, the site of the worst train disaster in the history of Canada when a passenger train plunged off the open bridge into the Richelieu river, killing 99. In 1878, industrialization began in Belœil when the Hamilton Powder Company established an explosives factory a little to the south of Belœil-Station, in what would eventually become McMasterville.

In 1903, the two hamlets (around the Church and Belœil-Station), dissatisfied with the aqueduct service in the parish municipality of Saint-Mathieu-de-Belœil, requested and were granted permission to become the village of Belœil, whose population reached nearly 700 inhabitants in 1911. By 1914, the village had grown further, sufficiently so to become the ville (city) of Belœil. Over these early years, the city developed its aqueduct and electricity networks. The city remained largely isolated from Montreal, except by train, owing to poorly organized road connections. The opening, in 1940, of the then-Route 9, today Quebec route 116, provided a first direct link to Montreal and, by the 1950s, the population had grown to nearly 6,000 inhabitants, and the two hamlets had grown into a single town. The construction, in 1964, of the Quebec Autoroute 20 freeway linking Montreal to Quebec and passing just north of Beloeil, the population of Beloeil tripled over the next three decades as it became part of the Montreal suburbs.

===Name===

The origins of the name Belœil have been a matter of debate between two competing theories.

One theory argues that the city derives its name from the view from atop the Mont Saint-Hilaire. According to this theory, in 1693, shortly before receiving the seigneurie from Frontenac, Joseph Hertel and his brother Jean-Baptiste climbed atop the Mont Saint-Hilaire, where, upon seeing the view, Jean-Baptiste Hertel exclaimed &quot;Quel bel œil!&quot;, which, in seventeenth-century French, meant &quot;What a beautiful view!&quot;. According to this theory, when he was later granted his seigneurie, Joseph Hertel, remembering the exclamation, chose to name it Belœil (beautiful view). The alternate theory states that the name derives from the like-named town in Belgium, with a wide variety of possible links between the two towns.

While city government of Beloeil refuses to take a position in the debate on the origin of the name, local historian Pierre Lambert has demonstrated that the various proposed links between the Belgian and Quebec cities are very tenuous at best, whereas the &quot;Bel Œil&quot; theory was first put forward by the Campbell family, who (having purchased the seigneurie of Rouville in the nineteenth century) had access to the archives of Jean-Baptiste Hertel. As a result, Lambert argues for &quot;beautiful view&quot; as the probable origin of the name.

==Geography==

Beloeil lies in the central Saint Lawrence Lowlands, a plains region on both sides of the Saint Lawrence river. The elevation above sea level near the city on the western shore of the Richelieu is lower than , with the Saint-Mathieu-de-Beloeil Aerodrome, at the western edge of town, lying above mean sea level. Just across the Richelieu river, however, the isolated Mont Saint-Hilaire, which was known as Mount Belœil for most of the nineteenth century, dominates the regional landscape with its .

Generally, the region surrounding Beloeil remains agricultural. The Census Consolidated Subdivision of Saint-Mathieu-de-Beloeil, which includes Beloeil as well as McMasterville, has of farmlands, out of a total area of , or 42.6%. The wider Vallée-du-Richelieu census district, of which Saint-Mathieu-de-Beloeil is part, has of farmland, out of total area, or 66.4%.

Beloeil is part of a broader agglomeration of over forty thousand inhabitants, formed by four towns spread out on the sides of the Richelieu River. It represents the northwestern portion of the agglomeration and is separated from Mont Saint-Hilaire (northeastern) and Otterburn Park (southeastern) only by the Richlieu river, while Bernard-Pilon street (Quebec Route 229) forms the limit between Beloeil and McMasterville (southwestern). Most of the urban portion of the city as it exists today lies within the area delimited by Bernard-Pilon Street to the south, the Richelieu river to the east, Yvon-L&#x27;Heureux Boulevard to the west, and Quebec Autoroute 20 to the north. The land north of the autoroute or west of Yvon-L&#x27;Heureux is still largely rural.

Historically, Belœil grew as two separate hamlets, one around the Saint-Mathieu-de-Belœil parish church and the other around the train station. Although the inland growth of the town starting in the 1950s has linked the two hamlets into a single city, the historical neighborhoods still exist, as the Vieux-Belœil (English &quot;Old Belœil&quot;), around the Saint-Mathieu Church at the meeting of the Richelieu and Saint-Jean-Baptiste streets, and Belœil-Station by the railway and along the shores of the river further south, although much of the territory of Belœil-Station seceded in 1917 to form the municipality of McMasterville.

==Economy==

Beloeil, in 2021, had an unemployment rate of 5.0% (the provincial average is 7.6%). The median income in 2020 was $48,800 (the provincial median was $40,800). In 2021, 12 230 inhabitants reported being employed, of whom 5,785 worked outside Beloeil or 71.7%. Beloeil today is primarily a commuter town for people working in Montreal.

The primary industries in terms of employment are the health care and social assistance (13.6%), retail trade (12.8%), manufacturing (9.9%), and construction (9.4%). Other significant fields included professional, scientific and technical services (7.7%) and educational services (7.7%), while public administration (6.3%), finance and insurance (4.8%), accommodation and food services (4.4%) and other services (4.4%) employs much smaller portions of the population.

In February 2005, Beloeil adopted a bylaw limiting the size of commerce on its territory to no more than . This ban was particularly aimed at preventing attempts by Wal-Mart to establish a mega-store in the city. The main retail shopping in town is the Montenach Mall, which offers a wide array of shops and services.

==Infrastructure==
The major road connections to Beloeil are route 116, built in 1940, and autoroute 20, built in 1964. Both of these roads connect Montreal to Quebec by way of Beloeil and Saint-Hyacinthe. The route 116 serves as the primary commercial street of Beloeil.

There is no longer any local train station in Beloeil. Instead, people wishing to take the Montreal commuter train must do so at the McMasterville train station. CIT de la Vallée du Richelieu offers a bus service linking Saint-Hyacinthe to Longueuil by way of Beloeil along route 116. Its Longueuil terminus connects directly to the Yellow Line of the Montreal Metro. An additional, more occasional service links Beloeil to downtown Montreal directly.

However, the vast majority of the population of Beloeil prefer to use the road to commute to work. In 2006, among the local population that worked outside their home, 81% reported driving to work, and 5% reported going in someone else&#x27;s car, whereas only 7.5% reported using public transit. Among other methods of transportation, 5.9% reported walking or using a bicycle.

==Education==
In 2021, of the population 15 and older, 64.4% reported having a post-secondary diploma of some form (vocational, CÉGEP or university). 27.6% of the total population reported having a university diploma or degree. Among those who did pursue post-secondary education, 3,310 specialized in business, management and public administration, and 2,515 in architecture, engineering, and related trades.

Locally, Beloeil has five French-language public elementary schools serving around 1200 to 1300 elementary school-age children (6 to 12): &quot;Le Petit Bonheur&quot;, &quot;Le Tournesol&quot;, &quot;Saint-Mathieu&quot;, &quot;Jolivent&quot; and &quot;au Coeur-des-Monts&quot;, which belong to the &quot;Commission Scolaire des Patriotes&quot;, as well as one English-language elementary school, &quot;Cedar&quot;. Beloeil also has a French-language high school, the &quot;École Secondaire Polybel&quot;.

The South Shore Protestant Regional School Board previously served the municipality.

<doc id="734086" wikidata="Q1113061" url="?curid=734086" title="Mariano Fortuny (designer)">
<text>Mariano Fortuny y Madrazo (, ; 11 May 1871 – 3 May 1949) was a Spanish polymath, artist, inventor and fashion designer who opened his couture house in 1906 and continued until 1946. He was the son of the painter Mariano Fortuny y Marsal.

== Life ==
Fortuny was born on 11 May 1871, to an artistic family in Granada, Spain. His father, a genre painter, died when Fortuny was three years old and his mother, Cecilia, moved the family to Paris, France. It was apparent at a young age that Fortuny was a gifted artist, showing a talent for painting as well as a passion for textiles. During his childhood he was introduced to many different textiles and fabrics, which greatly imprinted upon his creativity. His parents were passionate for materials and had their own collections of textiles from various shops they had visited in Europe. His father also collected metalwork and armour from previous ages as a hobby. As a young child he was fascinated with all of these textiles and would dye pieces of material for amusement. It was this exposure that led him to designing and producing his own textiles and dresses. The family moved again in 1889 to Venice, Italy. As a young man, Fortuny travelled throughout Europe seeking out artists he admired, among them the German composer Richard Wagner. Fortuny became quite varied in his talents, some of them including inventing, painting, photography, sculpting, architecture, etching and theatrical stage lighting. In 1897, he met the woman he would marry, Henriette Negrin, in Paris. She came to live with him in 1902, when she filed for divorce from her first husband. They were together for the rest of Fortuny&#x27;s life, eventually marrying in Paris in 1924.

While in Paris Fortuny registered and patented more than 20 inventions between 1901 and 1934.

He died in his home in Venice and was buried in the Campo Verano in Rome. His work was a source of inspiration to the French novelist Marcel Proust.

== Lighting engineer ==
In 1892, after experiencing some of Richard Wagner&#x27;s work in Paris, Fortuny traveled to Bayreuth, Germany where Wagner had built a theater specifically designed to put on his operas. He was mesmerized by Wagner&#x27;s work and began to paint scenes for his operas when he returned to Venice. In Wagnerian drama, painting, architecture, song, dance, and poetry all worked together towards a common goal. This affected Fortuny&#x27;s outlook and was the inspiration for a brand new type of theater design where the designer and the technician would work together on a project from idea to realization. Fortuny and other followers of this concept believed that one can only improve the quality of a product by having a good knowledge of something&#x27;s raw materials and the process of its construction. He also thought that the best type of design was created when the artist knew how to realize the design and controlled all of the steps in the creative process.

Through his experiences with Wagner and the theatre, Fortuny became a lighting engineer, architect, inventor, director, and set designer. As a set designer, he wanted to create a more seamless way of transitioning from one scene to another other than flying out a backdrop and bringing in a new one. He began experimenting with light and different ways to do this in the attic of his palazzo in Italy. With his experimentation, he found that reflecting light off different surfaces could change the color, intensity and other properties of light. His 1904 treatise &quot;Eclairage Scenique&quot; (&quot;Stage Lighting&quot;) describes the discovery that formed the basis of his indirect lighting technique. He concluded that, &quot;... it is not the quantity but the quality of light that makes things visible and allows the pupil ... to open properly.&quot;

He used these indirect lighting techniques in his new invention, the Fortuny cyclorama dome, a quarter-dome-shaped structure of plaster or cloth. Fortuny first filed a patent for his indirect theatrical lighting system in 1901 and constantly refined his invention thereafter. The shape created the look of a more extensive sky, and Fortuny could create any type of sky he wanted by reflecting light onto it in a certain way. He could even reflect clouds on the backdrop by painting different things on the mirrors that reflected light onto the dome.

During the 1920s, Fortuny&#x27;s contribution to the theatre gained widespread recognition. After studying and perfecting his dome, its use was becoming more popular in many theatres in Europe. He was soon contracted to install his dome in the famous opera house, La Scala of Milan. However, for this project he was required to make some adaptations for the dome to be used at its maximum potential. The theatre was much larger than his original dome, so he increased the size so that he could allow the dome to fill the space with the stage completely. He also made it so that the dome was &quot;electrically controlled, and could fold and unfold like a giant accordion in the space of 90 seconds. Even more impressively, he invented a suction fan, specifically for this project, which forced out the air to keep the structure taut. From the audience’s point of view, this helped the backdrop’s depth to seem almost infinite, as if you were looking at a night sky that never ended. After all the adaptations were made and the construction was completed, the dome successfully opened on 7 January 1922, with a production of Parsifal.

From the same concept of the dome, Fortuny created a lamp that could be used to recreate indoor lighting onstage, the Fortuny Moda Lamp. Although originally intended for use as a stage lamp and patented in 1903, this lighting fixture remains popular as a floor lamp.

== Fashion designer ==

The achievements that Fortuny is most well known for were made in the field of fashion design. His wife, Henriette Negrin, was an experienced dressmaker who helped to construct many of their designs. From 1902 they lived in the Palazzo Pesaro Orfei in Venice, which Fortuny filled with the artwork of his father, art that his father collected, and other art and artefacts that inspired him. He called the palazzo his &quot;think tank&quot; where he had many rooms set up for experiments and inventions as well as rooms for inspiration. 

It is not clear if Fortuny had any interest in, or aptitude for, fashion design before meeting Negrin. His first works in fabric appeared after they began cohabitating, and there is little documentation to attest which creations were hers or his - except the silk-pleating process, which was Negrin&#x27;s invention. 

Fortuny and Negrin drew from styles of the past for their fashion design as well, inspired by the light, airy clothing of Greek women that clung to the body and accentuated the natural curves and shape of a woman&#x27;s body.

Fortuny and Negrin rebelled against the style lines that were popular during his time period, and Henriette created the Delphos gown, a shift dress made of finely pleated silk weighed down by glass beads that held its shape and flowed on the body. No one has been able to recreate pleating as fine as theirs , or that has held its shape like their dresses have for many years. They also manufactured their own dyes and pigments for their fabrics using ancient methods. With these dyes they began printing on velvets and silks and dyed them using a press that they invented with wooden blocks onto which they engraved the pattern. Their dresses are seen as fine works of art today and many survive, still pleated, in museums and personal collections.

In Paris, Fortuny garments were retailed by Babani, who sold Delphos dresses and other garments to the actress Eleonora Duse.

In 2012, the Queen Sofia Spanish Institute in New York City mounted an exhibition of his work.

A wide collection of his work can be seen at the Museo del Traje in Madrid

His clients were Élisabeth, Countess Greffulhe and her daughter Élaine Greffulhe, Eleonora Duse, Ellen Terry and Oona O&#x27;Neill.

== Museum ==

The Fortuny Museum is housed in the Venetian Gothic Palazzo Pesaro Orfei in Venice. It contains work by Fortuny in the fields of textile design, fashion design, painting, sculpture, photography and lighting, and also a number of paintings by his father Mariano Fortuny y Marsal.

<doc id="734089" wikidata="Q2541953" url="?curid=734089" title="Bellas Artes metro station (Mexico City)">
<text>Bellas Artes is a station along Line 2 and Line 8 of the Mexico City Metro system. It is located in the Colonia Centro neighborhood of the Delegación Cuauhtémoc municipality of Mexico City, on the junction of Avenida Juárez and Eje Central Lázaro Cárdenas, on the eastern end of Alameda Central, west of the city centre. In 2019, the station had an average ridership of 51,440 passengers per day.

==Name and pictogram==
The station is named for the Palacio de Bellas Artes opera house and museum, opened in 1934 and located next to the station. The pictogram depicts a stylized version of the palace&#x27;s Art Nouveau façade as seen from the main southern entrance.

==History==

The Line 2 section of the station was among the first to be opened in the system on 14 September 1970; the transfer with Line 8 was inaugurated on 20 July 1994.

French President Jacques Chirac inaugurated a treasured Hector Guimard style Art Nouveau Paris Métro entrance next to the western wing of the Palace on 14 November 1998. The entrance was a gift given in return for the mural &quot;El pensamiento y el alma huicholes&quot; by Huichol artist Santos de la Torre presented in 1997 to the Paris Métro that is now on display at the Palais Royal – Musée du Louvre station.

==General information==
Inside the station, the platforms in Line 2 show reproductions of Mesoamerican art. Similarly, the Line 8 platforms are decorated with colourful murals, with Mexican and French motifs: a reproduction of one of the Bonampak murals by Rina Lazo; &quot;Visión francesa sobre México&quot; by Jean-Paul Chambas, and &quot;Visión de un artista mexicano sobre Francia&quot; by Rodolfo Morales.

As many stations in the Metro network, Bellas Artes has a cyber center, where users can access internet through a computer; the service is free and it is open from 8:00 to 20:00. From here, it is also possible to transfer to Metrobús Line 4 and Line A of the trolleybus service.

<doc id="734091" wikidata="Q1229352" url="?curid=734091" title="Jean Patou">
<text>Jean Patou (; 27 September 1887 – 8 March 1936) was a French fashion designer, and founder of the Jean Patou brand.

== Early life ==
Patou was born in Paris, France in 1880. Patou&#x27;s family&#x27;s business was tanning and furs. Patou worked with his uncle in Normandy, then moved to Paris in 1910, intent on becoming a couturier.

== 1910s – World War I and later ==

In 1912, he opened a small dressmaking salon called &quot;Maison Parry&quot;. His entire 1914 collection was purchased by a single American buyer. Patou&#x27;s work was interrupted by the First World War. He was mobilised in August 1914, shortly after the German invasion of Belgium. Patou served as a captain in the Zouaves. Reopening his couture house in 1919, he became known for eradicating the flapper look by lengthening the skirt and designing sportswear for women and is considered the inventor of the knitted swimwear and the tennis skirt. He, notably, designed the then-daring sleeveless and knee-length cut tennis wear for Suzanne Lenglen. He also was the first designer to popularize the cardigan and moved fashion towards the &quot;natural and comfortable&quot;.

== 1920s ==
Jean Patou is credited with inventing the &quot;designer tie&quot; in the 1920s when men&#x27;s ties, made in the same fabric as the women&#x27;s dress collection, were displayed in department stores next to Patou&#x27;s perfume counter. The designer tie style is still prominent amongst contemporary fashion designers, such as Louis Feraud, Timothy Everest, Duchamp and Paul Smith and Patrick McMurray.

In 1925 Patou launched his perfume business with three fragrances created by Henri Alméras. In 1928, Jean Patou created &quot;Huile de Chaldée&quot;, the first sun tan lotion.

Louis Süe designed all the perfume bottles and boxes for Jean Patou.

== 1930s ==
When the stock market crashed, so did the market for luxury fashion. The House of Patou survived through its perfumes.

The best known of Patou&#x27;s perfumes is &quot;Joy&quot;, a heavy floral scent, based on the most precious rose and jasmine, that remained the costliest perfume in the world, until the House of Patou introduced &quot;1000&quot; (a heavy, earthy floral perfume, based on a rare osmanthus) in 1972. Before Joy, the House of Patou released many other perfumes, many which were to celebrate particular events. For example, Normandie (an oriental forerunner to perfumes such as Yves Saint Laurent&#x27;s Opium) celebrated the French ocean liner of the same name, and Vacances (a mixture of green and lilac notes) celebrated the first French paid national holidays.

Other Patou perfumes of the same time were:
*Amour Amour – the forerunner of Joy, using the same rose notes, but without the jasmine
*Adieu Sagesse, Que Sais-Je? - these two and Amour Amor were released at the same time; Patou&#x27;s idea was that the light floral Amour Amour was suitable for blondes; the tart, spicy Adieu Sagesse for redheads, and the heavy floral Que Sais-Je? for brunettes
*L&#x27;Heure Attendue – a wonderful, unique oriental perfume
*Divine Folie – a floral vanilla
*Câline – a wonderful chypre perfume, similar to the much later Diorling by Christian Dior
*Moment Suprême – a perfume based on lavender
*Colony – which had a strong pineapple note
*Chaldée – Patou&#x27;s Huile de Chaldée sun oil had become so popular, many customers were buying it purely for its smell, therefore, Chaldée the perfume (a dry musk) was produced
*Le Sien – one of the first perfumes for men and women
*Cocktail – literally a floral cocktail

All these, with the exception of Le Sien, were re-released during the 1980s (under the name Ma Collection), and were available until recently, all in a 50 ml Eau de Toilette Spray, 75 ml Eau de Toilette bottle, and 30 ml pure perfume bottle, each with a unique art deco box. A Jean Patou silk scarf, printed in a pattern complementing that of the box was included with the pure perfume. Joy remains the world&#x27;s second best-selling scent (the first is Chanel No. 5), &quot;Joy&quot; was created by Henri Alméras for Patou at the height of the Great Depression (1935) for Patou&#x27;s former clients who could no longer afford his haute couture clothing line.

== Legacy ==

=== Haute couture ===
Patou was discovered unresponsive in his home the night of March 8, 1936 and died less than an hour later. He had been found to have suffered a massive cerebral hemorrhage nearly 24 hours earlier. He died 4 months after his 48th birthday. His sister Madeleine and her husband Raymond Barbas continued the House of Patou.

Designers for the House of Patou have included Marc Bohan (1954–1956), Karl Lagerfeld (1960–1963) and Jean Paul Gaultier (1971–1973). Christian Lacroix joined the label in 1981. The last fashion collection produced by the House of Patou label was in 1987 when the haute couture business closed definitively following Lacroix&#x27;s departure to open his own house.

=== Perfumes ===

After the closure of the haute couture business the company has continued to produce fragrances under the Jean Patou brand. Patou also produced fragrances for Lacoste, when Patou acquired the license in the 1960s, and Yohji Yamamoto in the 1990s.

From 1967 to 1999 Jean Kerléo was the house perfumer, he developed all their perfumes during that time including &quot;1000&quot; (1972) and &quot;Sublime&quot; (1992), &quot;Patou Pour Homme&quot; (1980).

In 1984, Jean Kerléo was responsible for the reformulation and reissue of twelve of Patou&#x27;s fragrances from 1925 to 1964 in a series called &quot;Ma Collection&quot;, including the first fragrances created for the house in 1925, the trio &quot;Amour-Amour&quot;, &quot;Que sais-je?&quot; and &quot;Adieu Sagesse&quot;. &quot;Ma Collection&quot; was sold in flacons modelled after the originals by Louis Süe.

Kerleo stepped down in 1999 appointing Jean-Michel Duriez as house perfumer. Duriez creations include &quot;Un Amour de Patou&quot; (1998), &quot;Enjoy&quot; (2003) and &quot;Sira des Indes&quot; (2006).

&quot;Joy&quot; was voted &quot;Scent of the Century&quot; by the public at the Fragrance Foundation FiFi Awards in 2000, beating its rival &quot;Chanel No. 5&quot;.

Jean Patou remained a family-owned business until September 2001 when it was bought by P&amp;G Prestige Beaute a division of Procter &amp; Gamble, which also market perfumes for Jean Kerléo and Karl Lagerfeld.

In 2011, the UK-based company Designer Parfums Ltd bought the Jean Patou portfolio from Procter &amp; Gamble. Thomas Fontaine is the house perfumer.

<text>Mount Jefferson is a mountain located on the Continental Divide between Fremont County of northeastern Idaho and Beaverhead County of southwestern Montana. Mount Jefferson is the highest point of the Centennial Mountains, whose crest runs along the Continental Divide and can be climbed using a class 2 route (scramble) from the access road to neighboring Sawtell Peak.

The south and west slopes of Mount Jefferson drain into Hell Roaring Creek, thence into Red Rock Creek, the Red Rock River, the Beaverhead River, the Jefferson River, the Missouri River, the Mississippi River, and into the Gulf of Mexico.
Brower&#x27;s Spring, the source of Hell Roaring Creek, on the mountain&#x27;s east flank in Montana, is considered the absolute headwaters of the Missouri River.
The northeast slope of Mount Jefferson drains into the South Fork of Duck Creek, thence into Henrys Lake, the Henrys Fork of the Snake River, the Columbia River, and into the Pacific Ocean.

The mountain is named for United States Founding Father and third president, Thomas Jefferson.

<text>La Prairie () is an off-island suburb (south shore) of Montreal, in southwestern Quebec, Canada, at the confluence of the Saint-Jacques River and the Saint Lawrence River in the Regional County Municipality of Roussillon. The population as of the Canada 2021 Census was 26,406.

== History ==
French Jesuits were the first Europeans to occupy the area, which was named La Prairie de la Magdelaine but was also called François-Xavier-des-Prés. The land was given to the Jesuits by Jacques de La Ferté and the Company of One Hundred Associates in 1647. It is in La Prairie that the story Kateri Tekakwitha took place.

In 1668, the site was named Kentaké, the Iroquois name for &quot;at the prairie&quot;. In the beginning of modern Quebec history, the territory of La Prairie would be visited on numerous occasions by Iroquois and English settlers from New York, among others at the time of the Anglo-Iroquois expedition of Pieter Schuyler in 1691, who commanded two battles on August 11, 1691.

The close of the Seven Years&#x27; War led to the 1763 treaty ending the French and Indian War. New France, sparsely-populated by indigenous peoples and descendants of French colonists, was ceded by France and divided into British colonies. The territory of La Prairie became part of the Province of Quebec (1763–1791) within the British Empire.

In 1845, the village of La Prairie was established. One year later, La Prairie-de-la-Magdelaine was established. La Prairie was the seat of Laprairie County (1855-1980s), which included the parishes of La Prairie, Notre-Dame, Ste-Catherine, St-Constant, St-Isidore, St-Jacques-le-Mineur, St-Mathieu and St-Philippe. In 1909, La Prairie obtained official city status.

Historically, the city has been an important transportation hub, as it was the point of transfer between Montreal ferries and the land route to Saint-Jean-sur-Richelieu, gateway to Lake Champlain and the Hudson River. The first railway line in British North America, the Champlain and St. Lawrence Railroad, connected it with Saint-Jean-sur-Richelieu on July 21, 1836; the railway ran over . The construction of a rail line between La Prairie and Saint-Jean-sur-Richelieu would greatly accelerate the commercial development of the village. River transport equally played an important role in La Prairie&#x27;s history.

== Geography ==

=== Climate ===
Like the rest of southwestern Quebec, La Prairie has hot summers and cold winters, for a generally temperate climate. Winters are cold and sometimes long (snow is usually present from mid-November to mid-April), with temperatures occasionally dipping below -30 °C, not counting the windchill. During snowstorms, snowfall frequently surpasses 40 centimeters. In the summer, temperatures sometimes exceed 30 °C.

=== Environment ===
In 2013, Grand Boisé conservation park is planned to be created and orchestrated by Nature-Action. The park would include Smithers&#x27; swamp, as well as, Hydro-Quebec&#x27;s servitude area in which the western chorus frog, a vulnerable species in Quebec, is found in greatest numbers. There is a controversy involving the city housing development in that area which was supposed to be conserved integrally with high priority according to RCM of Roussillon 1990s&#x27; maps. Local environmental organisms, such as Vigile verte and Projet Rescousse, are denouncing the choice of that land for housing development. The debate is ongoing.

== Demographics ==
In the 2021 Census of Population conducted by Statistics Canada, La Prairie had a population of living in of its total private dwellings, a change of from its 2016 population of . With a land area of , it had a population density of in 2021.


== Infrastructure ==

The CIT Le Richelain provides commuter and local bus services.

== Education ==
The town has three high schools: l&#x27;École de la Magdeleine, a public French school which offers the International Baccalaureate (IB) Programme, Collège Jean de la Mennais, a private mixed French school and Saint-François-Xavier, a public French school.

The South Shore Protestant Regional School Board previously served the municipality.

<doc id="734114" wikidata="Q3356908" url="?curid=734114" title="Cuatro Caminos metro station (Naucalpan)">
<text>Cuatro Caminos (translated from Spanish the name literally means &quot;Four Roads&quot;) is a station of the Mexico City metro network. Colloquially known as &quot;Metro Toreo&quot;, it is the north terminus of Line 2. The adjacent Mexipuerto Cementos Fortaleza Cuatro Caminos mixed-use development opened in 2016 and houses, besides a shopping center, residential tower and sports facility, a bus terminal that is a hub for regional bus and minibus transport from and into the State of Mexico. In 2019, the station had an average ridership of 114,947 passengers per day, making it the third busiest station in the network.

As of 14 September 1970 Line 2 originally terminated at Metro Tacuba, but on 22 August 1984 the line was extended an additional two stations to reach the municipality of Naucalpan. The station sits on the dividing line between the Mexico City and the neighboring State of Mexico and as such was the first station of the network to be built outside the limits of the Federal District.

==General information==
The station logo is a large geodesic dome depicting the former nearby &quot;Toreo de Cuatro Caminos&quot; bull fighting ring, which the station takes its name from, however the bullring was torn down in 2008. The station&#x27;s surroundings (popularly known as the &quot;paradero&quot;), are the main public transport hub to Toluca and northwestern municipalities in the State of Mexico, such as Naucalpan, Atizapán, Tlalnepantla or Huixquilucan, as well as a major connection point to several destinations within the Mexico City proper and it also serves as the housing of a large street market, which is known largely because of its poor general conditions. Officially, no private vehicles are allowed in the area.

Upon leaving the station, there are two main corridors, labeled &quot;North&quot; and &quot;South&quot;. North corridor (denoted by the exits A to K), is mainly used for transportation to State of Mexico, while the &quot;South&quot; corridor is mainly aimed at passengers going to the city (denoted by exit letters J to Z), though this is not strictly the case.

The South corridor (if walked) leads to the Mexipuerto bus terminal, the Toreo Parque Central and Pericentro shopping malls, the Anillo Periférico, and various military facilities, while the North corridor leads to the industrial complex of Naucalpan.

In 2003, the Mexican popular music group Café Tacuba produced an album with the title &quot;Cuatro Caminos&quot; in homage to this part of the city.

<text>Mount Jefferson is a mountain located in Ashe County, North Carolina. The mountain is part of the Mount Jefferson State Natural Area. The mountain has an elevation of above sea level, and it sharply rises more than 1,600 feet above the towns of Jefferson, North Carolina and West Jefferson.

A paved road leads to the mountain&#x27;s summit; on a clear day the summit affords sweeping views of the surrounding countryside, the towns of Jefferson and West Jefferson, and the Appalachian Mountains in Virginia, Tennessee, and North Carolina.

The mountain has a secondary peak at the eastern end of its ridge which is marked as Luther Rock on trails and as Luther Overlook on USGS maps.

==History==
Before the American Civil War the mountain was a popular hiding place for slaves who had escaped from their captors in the central and eastern sections of North Carolina. As a result, legend has it, the peak was named &quot;Nigger Mountain,&quot; According to another source, Nigger Mountain was named from its black granite coloration. It was later called &quot;Larson Mountain&quot; for many years until finally, in an effort to find a name that is not an ethnic slur, the mountain was renamed Mount Jefferson after the town at its base.

<doc id="734118" wikidata="Q350844" url="?curid=734118" title="Christian Lacroix">
<text>Christian Marie Marc Lacroix (; born 16 May 1951) is a French fashion designer. The name may also refer to the company he founded.

Lacroix&#x27;s designs combine luxury and insouciance. He prefers artisanal trades, fringe, bead, and embroidery. He&#x27;s characterized by a strong sense of colour, and patterns mix.

==Early life and education==
Lacroix was born in Arles, Bouches-du-Rhône in southern France. At a young age he began sketching historical costumes and fashions. Lacroix graduated from secondary school in 1969 and moved to Montpellier, to study Art History at the University of Montpellier. In 1971, he enrolled at the Sorbonne in Paris. While working on a dissertation on dress in French 18th-century painting, Lacroix also pursued a program in museum studies at the École du Louvre. His aspiration during this time was to become a museum curator. It was during this time he met his future wife Françoise Rosenthiel, whom he married in 1974.

==Early beginnings==
From 1985 to 1987, Lacroix worked at the Paris couture house of Jean Patou.

==&quot;Christian Lacroix&quot;==
===History===

In 1987, Lacroix opened his own eponymous haute couture house, backed by $8 million from Financière Agache. He began putting out ready-to-wear in 1988 drawing inspiration from diverse cultures. Critics commented that he did not seem to understand the type of clothing the working woman needed. In 1989, Lacroix launched jewelry, handbags, shoes, glasses, scarves, and ties (along with ready-to-wear). Italian manufacturer Genny was licensed to manufacture and distribute the line. The same year, the brand opened boutiques within Paris, Arles, Aix-en-Provence, Toulouse, London, Geneva, and Japan.

With his background in historical costume and clothing, Lacroix soon made headlines with his opulent, fantasy creations, including the short puffball skirt (&quot;le pouf&quot;), rose prints, and low décolleté necklines. He referenced widely from other styles—from fashion history (the corset and the crinoline), from folklore, and from many parts of the world—and he mixed his references in a topsy-turvy manner. He favored the hot colors of the Mediterranean region, a hodgepodge of patterns, and experimental fabrics, sometimes handwoven in local workshops. He is known for his theatrical style which came from his work while in the theatre. This usually shows up with his use of colour in the collections he designs. 

From 1987 to its purchase from LVMH by Falic Fashion Group in 2005, the fashion house had cumulative losses of more than €44 million.

In 2009, Falic Fashion Group put the business into administration and laid off all but 12 workers. The company&#x27;s turnaround plan consisted of closing down Lacroix&#x27;s haute couture and pret-a-porter activities, while keeping the licensing contracts for accessories and perfume. Lacroix&#x27;s A/W 2009 Haute Couture was privately financed by Lacroix and each model was paid €50. &quot;I didn&#x27;t want to cry,&quot; said Lacroix &quot;I want to continue, maybe in a different way, with a small atelier. What I really care about is the women who do this work&quot; Lacroix said about his last Haute Couture collection. Throughout its history, it never turned a profit and reported a €10 million loss in 2008. At the time, news media reported about potential investors – including Ali Al-Naimi – but all failing to give financial guarantees in time for the courts to approve a takeover.

He is known for his theatrical style which came from his work while in the theatre. This usually shows up with his use of colour in the collections he designs. Along with this, he is also known for his &#x27;le pouf&#x27; dress (featuring the ball skirt).

Christian Lacroix has designed many dresses for Hollywood stars; among them, he was responsible for designing Christina Aguilera&#x27;s wedding dress and in the 1990s was famed as being a favourite designer of Edina Monsoon in the UK sitcom &quot;Absolutely Fabulous&quot; (for which the house drew dubious credit).

In 2025, Spain&#x27;s Sociedad Textil Lonia (STL) acquired the Christian Lacroix fashion house for an undisclosed sum.

===Diffusion lines===

His collections during 1994 were based on old culture and folklore, as well as fables and the past. In 1995, he launched a towel line which contained a fashion and lifestyle side, which represent how the two intertwine (&quot;two sides of the same coin&quot;).

From 1996 to 2006, the brand operated the Christian Lacroix Jeans diffusion line. He included past traditions from all around the world, continuing the line with even more on ethnic arts.

In 2000 he finished a line of novelty accessories which included semi-precious jewelry.

In 2001, Lacroix also launched a children&#x27;s line.

In 2004, Lacroix launched a lingerie for women line, as well as a menswear line.

===Collaborations===
In 1997, the Art de la Table line was launched by Lacroix in partnership with Christofle. A licensing agreement was also reached in this year with Pronuptian in which he could launch his Christian Lacroix Marriage line.

In 2007, Christian Lacroix designed a festive, limited-edition bottle for French mineral water brand Evian. 

In 2011, Lacroix started collaborating with the Barcelona-based clothing brand Desigual.

In 2013, Diego Della Valle hired Lacroix to create a collection for Maison Schiaparelli, though it failed to materialize. 

===Cosmetics===
In 1999, Lacroix launched the brand&#x27;s first line of floral perfume. In 2002, the brand launched another perfume, Bazar, created by Bertrand Duchaufour, Jean-Claude Ellena and Emilie Copperman.

For Winter 2007, Lacroix partnered with Avon cosmetics to introduce a new fragrance exclusive to Avon called Christian Lacroix Rouge for women (plus body lotion and shower gel) and Christian Lacroix Noir for men (plus after shave lotion and shower gel). His Avon product line was expanded with the release of Christian Lacroix Absynthe in the Spring of 2009, Christian Lacroix Absynthe For Him in the autumn of 2009, Christian Lacroix Nuit in fall 2011 and Christian Lacroix Nuit For Him in winter 2011, Christian Lacroix Ambre for Her and Christian Lacroix Ambre for Him in winter 2014, Christian Lacroix Bijou for Her and Christian Lacroix Bijou for Him in fall 2015.

==Other activities==
===&quot;Emilio Pucci&quot;, 2002–2005===
Lacroix served as the Creative Director for the Italian fashion house Emilio Pucci from 2002 to 2005. He left on agreeable terms as he and the house believed that since he had other pursuits, it would be unfair to the house to not put in the energy required for future collections along with his other work.

===XCLX, 2005–present===
Through his XCLX company which was established in 2005, Lacroix created décor for the French TGV high-speed train. Also with XCLX, he was the designer of the new uniform of Air France staff and crew in 2004 and pyjamas signed by him are handed out to passengers travelling on Air France First Class (L&#x27;Espace Premier). The firm completed interior design work at several landmark hotels, including the Hotel Le Petit Moulin in Spring, 2005; the Hotel Bellechasse, right in the heart of Saint-Germain-des-Prés (Paris), in 2007 (a member of Small Luxury Hotels of the World); and in 2010 Le Notre Dame hotel just a step from the cathedral Notre-Dame-de-Paris, as well as Hotel l&#x27;Antoine near the Bastille area in Paris.

===Costume design===
Lacroix&#x27;s costume designs for the opera, theatre, dance and music were displayed at the exhibition &quot;Christian Lacroix Costumier&quot; at the National Museum of Singapore from March to June 2009. In 2022, he produced the costumes for the Marc-Antoine Charpentier&#x27;s opéra &quot;David et Jonathas&quot;, performed at the Château de Versailles, France.

<text>Mount Jefferson is located in Coos County, New Hampshire, and is the third highest mountain in the state. The mountain is named after Thomas Jefferson, the third president of the United States, and is part of the Presidential Range of the White Mountains. Mount Jefferson is flanked by Mount Adams (to the northeast) and Mount Clay (to the south).

The mountain has several interesting features, making it a popular hike. Two distinct ridges lead to its summit: Ridge of the Caps and Castle Ridge. The mountain is surrounded by the three dramatic glacial cirques of Jefferson Ravine, Castle Ravine, and the Great Gulf. Finally, Monticello Lawn is a large expanse of alpine sedge and rush near the otherwise talus-covered summit cone. When viewed from the Mount Washington Auto Road, Jefferson features an arrow-shaped bald patch pointing to its summit.

Mount Jefferson has a direct ascent along the Caps Ridge Trail, whose base, Jefferson Notch, is the highest point of any public road in New Hampshire at . This route, gaining only vertically to the summit, results in it having the least distance of ascent of any Presidential mountain (about 2.5 miles). However, climbing over the &quot;caps&quot; involves some exposed scrambling and can be steep and challenging at times.

==Climate==
There is no weather station, but this climate table contains interpolated data. Mount Jefferson has a subarctic climate (Köppen &quot;Dfc&quot;).

<text>Gianni Versace S.r.l. (), usually referred to as Versace ( ), is an Italian luxury elite fashion company founded by Gianni Versace in 1978. The company produces Italian-made ready-to-wear and accessories, as well as &quot;haute couture&quot; under its Atelier Versace brand and licenses its name and branding to Luxottica for eyewear. Gianni Versace being a native of Calabria, in the ancient Magna Grecia (Greater Greece), the company logo is inspired by Medusa, a figure from Greek mythology.

The Brand was founded in 1978 by Gianni Versace and run after his death by his family: his brother Santo Versace and sister Donatella Versace while Donatella&#x27;s daughter, Allegra Versace Beck, became the controlling shareholder having inherited her uncle Gianni&#x27;s share. Her brother Daniel inherited much of his Uncles Art Collection.

In September 2018 the company was sold to the Michael Kors group Michael Kors Limited and in January 2019, Gianni Versace S.r.l. became part of the Capri Holdings Limited group for $2.12 billion, creating a new luxury group together with Michael Kors and Jimmy Choo, keeping Donatella Versace as head of creative design.

==History and operations==
=== Gianni Versace, the beginning ===
Gianni Versace worked from an early age alongside his mother in the family tailor&#x27;s shop until 5 February 1972. On that day, he left Reggio Calabria to move to Milan, where he initially designed collections for Florentine Flowers. Later that year, he collaborated with De Parisini di Santa Margherita, and his name began to circulate in fashion circles.

In 1976, Gianni&#x27;s older brother, Santo Versace, who had an economics and business degree and an office in Messina, joined him in Milan. Together with Claudio Luti, they decided to open a company bearing Gianni&#x27;s name. By March 1978, the first Versace collection was showcased at La Permanente in Milan, garnering great appreciation.

===Gianni Versace, 1978–1997===
In 1972, Gianni Versace designed his first collections for Callaghan, Genny, and Complice.

In 1978, the company launched under the name &quot;Gianni Versace Donna&quot; and opened its first boutique in Milan&#x27;s Via della Spiga. Gianni independently controlled much of the brand, from designing to retailing. In 1981, the House of Versace released their first-ever fragrance, Gianni Versace for Women. In 1982, the company expanded its offerings to include accessories, jewelry, home furnishings, and china.

In 1993, Donatella Versace added the Young Versace and Versus lines, and from 1994 the company began referring to her as co-designer for Gianni Versace. Also in 1994, the brand gained international coverage from the black Versace dress of Elizabeth Hurley, referred in the media as &quot;that dress&quot;.

Versace has designed for various music artists, including stage and album cover costumes for Elton John in 1992 and outfits for Michael Jackson. Versace also designed clothing for the Princess of Wales and Princess Caroline of Monaco.

===Donatella Versace, 1997–present===
After the murder of Gianni Versace in 1997, his sister Donatella, formerly vice-president, took over as creative director, and his older brother Santo Versace became CEO. Donatella&#x27;s daughter Allegra Versace was left a 50 percent stake in the company, which she assumed control of on her eighteenth birthday.

In 2000 the green Versace dress worn by Jennifer Lopez at the Grammy Awards gained extensive media attention. The dress was voted the fifth most iconic dress of all time and Elizabeth Hurley&#x27;s black Versace dress was voted most iconic dress of all time, according to a 2008 &quot;Daily Telegraph&quot; poll.

In 2000 Versace began its effort to take control of all aspects of producing and selling its merchandise. With the company&#x27;s profits in decline in the early 2000s, Fabio Massimo Cacciatori was hired as interim CEO to reorganise and restructure Versace Group in 2003. Cacciatori resigned in December 2003 due to &quot;disputes with the Versace family&quot;. In 2004, Giancarlo di Risio from IT Holding became CEO, until he resigned in 2009 due to disagreements with Donatella. In May 2016, the Versace Group appointed Jonathan Akeroyd as CEO and board member.

In February 2014 The Blackstone Group purchased a 20 percent stake in Versace for .

In September 2018 Michael Kors offered to buy Versace for two billion euros. Versace announced all Blackstone and Versace family shares were sold to Michael Kors Limited. The acquisition was completed in December 2018, with Donatella Versace remaining head of creative design. In January 2019, Gianni Versace S.r.l. joined Capri Holdings, forming a new global fashion luxury group alongside Michael Kors and Jimmy Choo.

In 2018 Versace stopped using fur in its products and in 2020 announced it would stop using kangaroo leather. In October 2018, Versace announced its first Pre-Fall season show in New York, scheduled on Gianni Versace&#x27;s 2 December birthdate. In 2021, Versace opened its first SoHo, New York boutique.

==Brands==
===Atelier Versace===
In 2004 Versace – which as an Italian house is a correspondent member of the Chambre Syndicale de la Haute Couture – decided to pull couture off the runway for the first time and, for several years, invited only editors to see the clothes on racks. In 2012, Versace returned to the couture schedule, only to halt its couture shows again from 2017.

===Versace Classic V2===
From 1990 Versace held a majority stake in VeZe, a joint venture company with Ermenegildo Zegna. From 1996, VeZe manufactured the Versace Classic V2 men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s wear diffusion lines.

<text>Guy Vernor Henry (March 9, 1839 – October 27, 1899) was an American military officer and Medal of Honor recipient who served as military governor of Puerto Rico.

==Biography==
Henry was born in Fort Smith, Indian Territory (now Arkansas), the son of William Seton Henry and Arietta Livingston Thompson Henry. His mother was the granddaughter of Vice President Daniel D. Tompkins and Secretary of the Navy and Supreme Court Justice Smith Thompson. He was a fifth great-grandson of Robert Livingston.
William Seton Henry (1816–1851) was an 1835 graduate of the United States Military Academy, and attained the rank of Brevet Major for his service in the Mexican–American War. Guy V. Henry graduated from the United States Military Academy in May 1861, serving as a Union officer in the Civil War, and later in conflicts against the Native Americans in the West and southwest of the United States of America. From May 25, 1891, to October 3, 1894, while commanding the 7th U.S. Cavalry, he was also commander of Fort Myer, Virginia. During the Spanish–American War, he was dispatched to Guantánamo, Cuba, and later sent to Puerto Rico, alongside General Nelson Miles.

Henry was with General George Crook at the Battle of the Rosebud on June 17, 1876, when Crook was attacked by forces led by Crazy Horse. Henry was very badly wounded in the face. When John Finerty (correspondent for the Chicago Tribune, reporting from the field) commented on Guy&#x27;s grievous wound, the latter merely told him, &quot;For this we are soldiers,&quot; and encouraged Finerty to join the army.

He received successive brevets for gallantry in various battles and was brevetted brigadier general, United States Army, for gallantry at the Battle of Rosebud in Montana Territory, where he was shot through the face while fighting Native Americans. He received the Medal of Honor on December 5, 1893, for his Civil War service at the Battle of Cold Harbor on June 1, 1864, where he was temporarily serving as a colonel of volunteers and commanded a brigade. On June 1, 1897, Henry was promoted to colonel in the regular army and given command of the 10th U.S. Cavalry.

At the beginning of the Spanish–American War, Henry was appointed a brigadier general of volunteers on May 4, 1898. During the invasion of Puerto Rico, he led a &quot;Provisional Division&quot; from the city of Ponce to Arecibo, Puerto Rico, to rendezvous with General Theodore Schwan, who was arriving from the city of Mayagüez. The tropical rain impeded his trek and before Henry reached Mayagüez, the conflict was over. On October 11, 1898, he was promoted to brigadier general in the regular army.

On December 6, 1898, Henry was designated Governor of Puerto Rico. From December 7, 1898, to June 12, 1899, he served as a major general of volunteers. On February 6, 1899, he dissolved the Cabinet of Puerto Rico, which was instituted with the Autonomic Charter. Henry also eliminated taxes on basic food items. On May 2, 1899, he instituted the eight-hour work day in Puerto Rico. On May 9, 1899, he was replaced by General George W. Davis.

Henry died of pneumonia in New York City in October 1899 and was buried at Arlington National Cemetery.

General Henry was an Hereditary Member of the Aztec Club of 1847, a First Class Companion of the Military Order of the Loyal Legion of the United States and the Regular Army and Navy Union.

<doc id="734132" wikidata="Q2703749" url="?curid=734132" title="Klaw (character)">
<text>Klaw (Ulysses Klaue) is a supervillain appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. The character is depicted as a human physicist who has been transformed into solid sound, and who wears a sonic emitter on his right wrist as a prosthetic device. He is often in conflict with the Fantastic Four and the Avengers, and he is also an enemy of the Black Panther and Ka-Zar.

The character is featured in other Marvel-endorsed products such as arcade and video games, animated television series, and merchandise such as trading cards. Andy Serkis portrays Klaue in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) films &quot;&quot; (2015) and &quot;Black Panther&quot; (2018), and the Disney+ series &quot;What If...?&quot; (2021).

==Publication history==

The character first appeared in &quot;Fantastic Four&quot; #53 (1966) and was created by Stan Lee and Jack Kirby.

==Fictional character biography==
Ulysses Klaue is the son of Nazi war criminal Colonel Fritz Klaue of the Blitzkrieg Squad led by Baron Strucker. He was sent by Adolf Hitler to small African nation of Wakanda to learn their secrets. After World War II, he moved back to Belgium, later anglicized his name to &quot;Klaw&quot;, and raised his son with tales of Wakanda.

Klaw later becomes a physicist, working in the field of applied sonics. To continue his design of a sound transducer which converts sound waves into physical mass, Klaw steals the metal vibranium to power his device. This is a metal substance known to exist only in certain meteoric deposits in Wakanda. By stealing this rare mineral, Klaw comes into conflict with the Wakandan ruler/superhero T&#x27;Chaka, whom Klaw murders in cold blood. T&#x27;Chaka&#x27;s adolescent son T&#x27;Challa, who watched his father fall to the invaders, then attacks Klaw to avenge his father. Klaw manages to escape at the cost of his right hand.

Years later, Ulysses resurfaces with a sonic emitter/gun on his right wrist as a replacement prosthetic device for his missing hand, that can create any kind of object or creature he can conceive by only using sound. He has also created a device that turns him into a being composed solely of sound, making him immortal in the process. Klaw as a professional criminal battles T&#x27;Challa (who has now officially become the newest Black Panther) and superhero team the Fantastic Four in New York state, but he is defeated.

Klaw is imprisoned but freed by the Crimson Cowl, which turns out to be an alias of Ultron. Joining the second incarnation of the Masters of Evil, Klaw and the other villains battle superhero team, the Avengers. The Avengers, however, defeat them, with the Black Panther subduing Klaw. Klaw would attempt to reform the second Masters of Evil to fight the Avengers, but his scheme would be foiled by the all-female team the Lady Liberators.

Managing to escape custody again, Klaw journeys back to Wakanda where he helps steal a device capable of augmenting the metal-disintegrating property of a vibranium alloy. Encountering the Thing, the Human Torch, and the Black Panther, Klaw is defeated.

Klaw later joins forces with the murderous Solarr and traps the Avengers within a solid sound barrier. Klaw threatens to execute them if the Black Panther did not abdicate the throne of Wakanda to him. Realizing that Klaw himself is disguised as one of the hostages while using a sound creation of himself to appear outside the barrier, the Panther manages to expose and subdue Klaw and Solarr before he could make good on his threat.

Klaw is later freed from prison by a member of the extra dimensional race of Sheenareans, who wish him to use his sonic powers to help open a dimensional portal big enough for their invading armada to enter Earth. Klaw agrees and after a skirmish with Ka-Zar in London, he travels with the Sheenarean to the Savage Land where there is a vibranium deposit large enough to create the portal. After Ka-Zar repulses the invaders, Klaw flees into the Sheenarean dimension, and unable to salvage anything substantial from his allies, uses their technology to return to Earth.

Materializing in the Nexus of All Realities located in the Florida Everglades, Klaw happens upon the wand of the Molecule Man. Helping the Molecule Man find a body to possess, Klaw and his new ally travel to New York to wreak revenge on their common enemy, the Fantastic Four. Klaw is subdued by the visiting Impossible Man.

Klaw finds his powers waning, which results in him having to manipulate a group of street youths into helping him gain the material needed to restore his power. With Black Panther&#x27;s help, Klaw&#x27;s scheme backfires. He finds himself imprisoned within his own gun-hand, stored at the research facility Project Pegasus. In &quot;Marvel Two-in-One&quot; #57-58 (Nov.-Dec 1979), Klaw is freed by fellow villain Solarr, although both are defeated by a group of heroes, including the Thing, Quasar, Giant-Man, and Aquarian.

After that, Klaw fights the Thing, Ka-Zar, and American Eagle.

Klaw&#x27;s career soon takes a downward spiral, after an encounter with the mutant Dazzler results in his humanoid form being dissolved and his sound energy being blasted out into space, where it ends up being collected by Galactus. His energy is found by Doctor Doom during the limited series &quot;Secret Wars&quot;. Doom restores Klaw to normal. The loss of his physical form has had repercussions; Klaw now has the mind of a child and is quite insane, a symptom of which is speaking in rhyme. Doom exploits Klaw&#x27;s madness, convincing the villain to re-dissect him as part of a mad gambit to steal the powers of both Galactus and the Beyonder. However, the Beyonder possesses Klaw after losing his powers, leading to Klaw tricking Doom into giving up his stolen Godhood and teleporting the two back to Earth, where Klaw&#x27;s mental state slowly heals.

Klaw fights Daredevil and Vision, before being recruited by the Wizard to join his latest incarnation of the Frightful Four. Attacking the Fantastic Four while the group are performing a delicate scientific procedure on the Human Torch (whose powers had gone out of control), Klaw throws The Thing into the medical pod that was attempting to drain the excess radiation from Torch, resulting in Ben Grimm being returned to normal. Klaw and his teammates, along with the Fantastic Four, are quickly captured by the rogue Watcher Aron, who ultimately returns Klaw and his fellow villains to prison after the Fantastic Four break free.

Klaw&#x27;s imprisonment would not last. Escaping during the &quot;Acts of Vengeance&quot; story line, Klaw is taken in by A.I.M., who plant a pain-control device into his gun-hand to control him. He is then sent to attack Volcana in hopes of luring out her lover Molecule Man, but abandons the battle when his gun-hand is destroyed.

Klaw is later recruited by the &quot;Pacific Overlords&quot; group, led by Doctor Demonicus, but turns against the group and instead aids the West Coast Avengers in defeating them when it becomes apparent that Demonicus had become a thrall of a dangerous demon.

Klaw later joins Crimson Cowl&#x27;s version of the Masters of Evil, fighting the Thunderbolts on several occasions.

When Earth&#x27;s vibranium deposits begin to explode due to a &#x27;vibranium cancer&#x27; introduced into the world when Captain America&#x27;s shield was broken and improperly repaired, Klaw travels to Wakanda with the goal of absorbing the sound energy of the imminent explosion to become even stronger. Captain America is able to defeat him when he uses the damaged shield to absorb Klaw&#x27;s attack. The blast realigns the shield molecules so that the shield is repaired and the vibranium cancer destroyed.

Klaw features in the opening arc of the fourth Black Panther series, a flashback story that features the origin of the title character. The character ultimately resurfaces again, having (through unknown means) successfully uploaded his sound based essence onto the Internet and later been downloaded by the Wizard to fight the Fantastic Four again as part of a new incarnation of the Frightful Four.

Klaw is later seen with Wizard&#x27;s Frightful Four when it comes to helping Intelligencia capture Mister Fantastic.

Chameleon later poses as Klaw to infiltrate Intelligencia and be ready for the Sinister Six to attack them.

Klaw is enlisted by the Wizard to capture Carnage, so that he can be added to the latest version of the Frightful Four, alongside Karl Malus. The Wizard&#x27;s attempts to control the symbiote (which is in control of Kasady&#x27;s lobotomised body) fail, so he decides to bond it to Malus, and subdue his mind. Klaw subdues Malus, and the operation is a success, creating &quot;Superior Carnage&quot;. The &quot;Frightful Foundation&quot; then attack New York city hall, as part of Wizard&#x27;s plan to get his clone son&#x27;s attention. During a battle with Superior Spider-Man, Wizard loses control of Superior Carnage, who stabs Klaw with a vibranium spear, causing him to detonate. The sonic explosion tears the symbiote away from Malus, and onto Wizard, but it then abandons him for Kasady (Whom Superior Spider-Man had brought to the scene). As Carnage attempts to kill Wizard, Klaw, whose consciousness had been projected onto the &quot;sound wall&quot; of the universe by the explosion, focuses the last of his strength into creating a bolt of lightning that brings down Carnage, separating the symbiote from its host. Klaw reflects that that could be his final act, as his essence spreads further into the sound wall, and will soon be too thin for him to retain his consciousness.

During the &quot;&quot; storyline, Klaw is an inmate of Pleasant Hill, a gated community established by S.H.I.E.L.D.

==Powers and abilities==
Courtesy of a vibranium-powered sonic converter, Ulysses Klaw was converted into a being composed of psionically &quot;solidified&quot; sound, giving him a somewhat inhuman appearance. The character is described as having superhuman durability and strength sufficient to lift tons of matter. The molybdenum steel sound generator that serves as a prosthetic appliance on Klaw&#x27;s right wrist is able to transform ambient sound to perform a series of functions, including the projection of intense high-volume sonic waves and blasts of concussive force and the creation of mobile sound/mass constructs. The sound converter was invented by Klaw and later improved by AIM scientists and technicians. Klaw can also sense his surroundings using sonar. When he fought Volcana while trying to abduct Molecule Man he demonstrated the ability to create &quot;cohesive sound&quot;. This was essentially an entangling/crushing construct that absorbed ambient noise to increase its size and strength. The noise from the target&#x27;s struggles to remove the construct would make it larger and stronger. Volcana was only able to escape it by changing into her ash form. After Klaw became temporarily commingled with the ship of the cosmic entity Galactus and reconstructed by Doctor Doom, he became able to create semi-autonomous creatures that he could direct to attack his foes and his creatures are similarly made of solidified sound and display a similar superhuman strength level as Klaw himself.

Klaw is unable to regain his original organic form. He has a susceptibility to vibranium, which can cause his body to temporarily collapse. He is also subject to temporary mild insanity when forced to exist as sonic energy without humanoid form for long periods of time. As a result of his transformation, Klaw was at first unable to exist outside a medium that allows the propagation of sound waves (i.e. in a vacuum) without the technological improvements made to his sonic converter by AIM. After being reconstituted by A.I.M., his &quot;solid sound&quot; body has different properties than normal sound waves and is not affected by a vacuum. It was demonstrated that in this form that Klaw could also generate and direct sonic attacks through physical objects without needing his emitter by merely touching the material.

Klaw holds a Ph.D. in physics and is an expert physicist specializing in applied sonics.

<text>Mount Jefferson is an unincorporated community in Loramie Township, Shelby County, Ohio, United States. It lies along State Route 66 south of Houston. At above sea level, it is not on a summit, but is located on the south slope of the valley formed by Ninemile Creek, a tributary of Loramie Creek.

Mount Jefferson was platted on January 12, 1838, by Jonathan Counts on land owned by Samuel Farnum. Three churches—Christian, Episcopal, and Presbyterian—were organized in the community, but it never grew significantly; only one store and a few houses were ever built in the community.

<text>Mount Jefferson is a mountain located just outside Charlottesville, Virginia, United States, in Albemarle County. It lies south of Lewis Mountain, and is positioned at the northeastern edge of the Ragged Mountains.

It was named Mount Jefferson in honor of Thomas Jefferson after the establishment of the Leander McCormick Observatory on the summit in 1885. Jefferson had urged the purchase of the mountain for the University of Virginia, in part because of its suitability as a site for an observatory. In addition, he valued it for the water resources and the abundance of timber for construction of the university.

Prior to the renaming it had been known as Old Reservoir Mountain and Observatory Mountain (for an observatory which Jefferson directed to be built on the summit), and is now informally known as Observatory Hill.

The mountain is traversed by McCormick Road and Edgemont Road (which also runs along a neighboring ridge — Edgemont or Midmont), and is the site of several other University of Virginia buildings including a deactivated nuclear reactor, a linear accelerator and dormitories. It has been preserved in a largely wooded state for the protection of McCormick Observatory from light pollution. It is used by birdwatchers, mountain bikers, hikers, and students and faculty at The Judge Advocate General&#x27;s Legal Center and School, U.S. Army, for military physical fitness training. The headquarters for the National Radio Astronomy Observatory are also located on Mount Jefferson.

<doc id="734143" wikidata="Q4838773" url="?curid=734143" title="Bachelor of Accountancy">
<text>The Bachelor of Accountancy, also known as Bachelor of Accounting, is the principal academic degree in accountancy in several countries, and is often the only (undergraduate) degree recognised for subsequent practice as a professional accountant; see First professional degree. It is abbreviated as B.Acy., B.Acc., or B. Accty.. It is also sometimes titled Bachelor of Accounting Science (B.Acc.Sci.) or &quot;Baccalaureus &quot; (B.Compt.).

The B.Acy. is extremely specialized:
the curriculum 

requires study sufficient for professional practice (often at the major-level) in financial accounting, management accounting, auditing, and taxation. The curriculum also includes intermediate coursework in business law and economics, and general coverage of management theory, and business mathematics and business statistics. The degree is thus not to be confused with a B.B.A. in Accounting or B.Com. in Accounting, which are general business degrees with accounting as an area of concentration; for discussion, see . Some programs allow for specializations in topics such as Tax Accountancy, Auditing or Forensic Accountancy.

Due to the specialised nature of the B.Acy., it is a professional degree course that is offered infrequently. In the United States, it is likely to be a four-year undergraduate degree. In other parts of the world, such as Singapore, it will be a three-year undergraduate degree. In Malta, it is a two-year course that can be taken after qualifying in Bachelor of Commerce only for students who obtain exceptional grades in their previous course. Most public universities in South Africa offer the degree or a variant, often as a postgraduate Honours degree.

After completion of the Bachelor of Accountancy, students typically go on to work as accountants in industry, and/or pursue professional accountant status. When the degree is recognized for this purpose, 

graduates will therefore pursue the CPA or C.A. (or other) designations, and thus take up &quot;articles&quot; at an accounting firm accredited for training, so as to meet the relevant work experience requirements, and will then also sit the associated Professional Examination.

Note that in the United States, a bachelor&#x27;s degree in accountancy is generally not sufficient for practice as a professional accountant. Also, employers in industry generally prefer to hire applicants with a master&#x27;s in accountancy (or an M.B.A. with a concentration in accounting) and/or with professional certification. Accountancy graduates intending to work as accountants will therefore commence with the Master of Accountancy; an accelerated program, or an advanced program allowing for specialized / additional elective work, is typically available to these students.

<text>The National Harmony Party (Latvian: &quot;Tautas Saskaņas partija&quot;, TSP; ) was a political party in Latvia.

The party identified with social democracy. It supported further liberalisation of Latvian nationality law by granting citizenship to non-citizens who had lived in Latvia for at least 10 years. (The present law only allows Soviet-era migrants to apply for citizenship through a process of naturalization). It also supported expanding education in minority languages, particularly Russian.

== History ==
The roots of the TSP lay within the moderate wing of Popular Front of Latvia, the Latvian independence movement of the late 1980s and early 1990s. Its leader, Jānis Jurkāns, was the first Minister of Foreign Affairs of newly re-independent Latvia, from 1990 to 1992 when he had to leave the government for his stance on relations with Russia. Together with other activists, Jurkāns founded the Harmony for Latvia (&quot;Saskaņa Latvijai - Atdzimšana Tautsaimniecībai&quot;) alliance, which won 13 seats in the 1993 parliamentary election. The alliance split in 1994, with the free-market liberal wing becoming the Political Union of Economists and the social-democratic wing becoming the TSP. Jurkāns served as leader from then until 2005, when he resigned. The party&#x27;s last Chairman was Jānis Urbanovičs.

From its foundation, the party was popular with ethnic Russian voters for its moderate views on the citizenship issue and official languages. Unlike other parties popular with Russians, it also had a considerable number of ethnic Latvians in its leadership and was an attempt to bridge the ethnic divide in Latvian politics. The TSP won 6 seats at the 1995 parliamentary election. In 1998, it allied with two other predominantly Russian parties, the Latvian Socialist Party and Equal Rights, both of which held more radical pro-Russian positions. This step seriously damaged the reputation of the TSP amongst ethnic Latvians. The three parties founded the For Human Rights in United Latvia alliance. At the 2002 parliamentary election, the alliance won 18.9% at the popular vote and 25 seats. In 2003, the TSP left the alliance. It won no seats at the 2004 European Parliament election, and in 2005 lost its representation on Riga City Council.

In 2005, the party created the electoral alliance Harmony Centre, containing, amongst other parties, the Latvian Socialist Party, one of its former partners in For Human Rights in United Latvia. Harmony Centre won 17 seats in the 2006 parliamentary election. The TSP formed the basis of the Harmony party which was created on 10 February 2010.

<text>Le Gardeur () was a city in southwestern Quebec, Canada. Since the 2002 municipal reorganization in Quebec, it has been a district of the city of Repentigny.

It is on the L&#x27;Assomption River in the Regional County Municipality of L&#x27;Assomption and is connected to Montreal by Route 138, Autoroute 40, and Via Rail on the Canadian National rail line.

The rural parish of Saint-Paul-l&#x27;Ermite was established in 1856. The municipality of the same name was created in 1973 over part of the original territory. It changed its name to Le Gardeur five years later. (Pierre Le Gardeur, Sieur de Repentigny, was the region&#x27;s first feudal lord, under letters-patent granted in 1647 to the Compagnie des cent associés.) The parish and its church are still active.

Le Gardeur&#x27;s main population is concentrated near the L&#x27;Assomption River in the southernmost part of the city, bordering the rest of Repentigny, and the Saint Lawrence River. The northern part is mostly farmland, and is being developed as a suburban area. This is where the March 2006 announced AMT Repentigny-Mascouche Line commuter train that began service in December 2014 turned off the existing Canadian National line onto its own right of way heading towards Terrebonne.

<doc id="734152" wikidata="Q7820362" url="?curid=734152" title="Tompkins Cortland Community College">
<text>Tompkins Cortland Community College (TC3) is a public community college in Dryden, New York. It is supported by Cortland and Tompkins Counties and has extension sites that are located in Ithaca and Cortland. It is part of the State University of New York system.

== History ==
The college was founded in 1967 and opened in 1968 in Groton, New York. The college moved to its current Dryden, New York campus in 1974. A multimillion-dollar construction project completed in 2007 added a new athletics facility, a student center, and expanded and enhanced the college&#x27;s library.
==Academics==

Tompkins Cortland Community College offers more than 40 degree and certificate programs, including biology, biotechnology, business administration, communication and media arts, computer sciences, construction technology, creative writing, criminal justice, culinary arts, engineering science, hotel and restaurant management, liberal arts and sciences, nursing, paralegal, photography, sport management, sustainable farming and food systems, and wine marketing. About half of the Tompkins Cortland students transfer to a four-year college, with Binghamton University, Cornell University, Cortland State, Ithaca College, Niagara University, and the Rochester Institute of Technology being some of more popular transfer options.
==Athletics==

The college sponsors 11 intercollegiate athletic teams. The Panthers compete as a Region III member of the National Junior College Athletic Association (NJCAA) and as part of the Mid-State Athletic Conference. TC3 offers men&#x27;s cross country, soccer, basketball, baseball, lacrosse, and golf and women&#x27;s cross country, soccer, basketball, softball, and golf. The college offers a lighted turf soccer/lacrosse field, a 1,500-seat gymnasium, an field house, and on-campus baseball and softball parks. The men&#x27;s soccer and golf programs and the women&#x27;s soccer and softball programs are routinely nationally ranked. Dozens of former TC3 student-athletes have gone on to play at four-year institutions, often earning scholarships. Former Panthers have continued their playing careers at places like Drake University, Wofford College, Post University, SUNY New Paltz, Cortland State, and Ithaca College. In 2009 the softball team won the NJCAA Division III National Championship. In 2008, men&#x27;s golfer Kris Boyes won the NJCAA Division III Individual National Championship. In 2018, men&#x27;s golfer Dan Lapp won the NJCAA Division III Individual National Championship.
==Business development==
Tompkins Cortland Biz is the college&#x27;s business development and training center. Biz works with regional businesses and organizations to design and develop training programs, often helping secure funding for the training. In addition to customized training, a complete schedule of dozens of non-credit professional development programs is offered to individuals. Both on-campus and online classes are offered to help people learn skills needed to improve their positions in the workforce.

== Campus housing ==

Tompkins Cortland was one of the first community colleges in New York to offer on-campus housing, beginning its residential life program in 1999 with two buildings. The program has grown to now include seven buildings and more than 800 bedrooms. The residence halls are all apartment style, with each apartment including three or four private bedrooms, a kitchen, bathroom, and living room area.
==Concurrent enrollment==
CollegeNow is the college&#x27;s concurrent enrollment program. Tompkins Cortland works with school districts in Central New York allowing high school students to earn college credit while taking classes in high school.

==International==
The college partners with several institutions in foreign countries. The agreements allow international students the opportunity to study in their home institution during the regular academic year and in the United States at Tompkins Cortland for two semesters, either in the summer or during the traditional academic year. Through a combination of transfer credits and study in the United States students may receive complementary degrees from their home university and at Tompkins Cortland. All courses at Tompkins Cortland are taught in English.

Tompkins Cortland students have the opportunity to learn in a different culture through a handful of study abroad options. Students and community members have the chance to take faculty-led trips to Puerto Rico, Cambodia, Colombia, Ireland, Italy, Nicaragua, and Spain.

<doc id="734157" wikidata="Q1684002" url="?curid=734157" title="Jason York">
<text>Jason Andrew York (born May 20, 1970) is a Canadian former professional ice hockey defenceman who played for the Detroit Red Wings, Mighty Ducks of Anaheim, Ottawa Senators, Nashville Predators and the Boston Bruins of the National Hockey League (NHL). He was previously a hockey analyst on Montreal Canadiens&#x27; broadcasts on Sportsnet.

==Playing career==
York was selected in the seventh round (129th overall) of the 1990 NHL Entry Draft by the Detroit Red Wings. His first NHL game was played during the 1992–93 NHL season when he suited up for the Red Wings December 3, 1992 against the Minnesota North Stars. He scored his first NHL goal April 10, 1994 against fellow Nepean native Fred Brathwaite of the Edmonton Oilers.

Despite excelling in the minors, York found it difficult to crack a deep Detroit line-up and, after playing only nineteen games over three seasons for the Red Wings, he was traded to the Mighty Ducks of Anaheim April 5, 1995 along with Mike Sillinger in exchange for Stu Grimson, Mark Ferner, and a draft pick. In Anaheim, York was able to establish himself as an NHL regular and turned in a solid season in 1995–96, posting 3 goals and 21 assists for 24 points in 79 games. York was traded to the Ottawa Senators on October 1, 1996 with Shaun Van Allen in exchange for Ted Drury and the rights to Marc Moro. Then-Ottawa general manager (GM) Pierre Gauthier had gained familiarity with York in his previous job as Anaheim&#x27;s assistant GM.

Playing in his hometown of Ottawa, York hit his stride as a quality NHL player, establishing himself as a steady 2 way defenceman on an up-and-coming Senators team. In 1998–99, he enjoyed his finest offensive season as he recorded 35 points to lead all Senators&#x27; defencemen in scoring. He spent five steady seasons in Ottawa where the club made the playoffs each year York was there before becoming an unrestricted free agent in 2001.

York returned to Anaheim as a free agent for the 2001–02 campaign, signing a three-year, $6 million contract. He turned in another solid year but was traded at the start of the 2002–03 season to the Nashville Predators. York lead the Predators with the top plus minus in his first year with the club and helped Nashville make the playoffs for the first time in franchise history the following year.

Many figured that the 2004–05 NHL lock-out would end his NHL career, as it did for many veteran players; after not playing in 2004–2005 due to 3 major surgeries and the passing of his father, York signed with HC Lugano for the 2005–06 season, where he would win the Swiss League championship. He performed well enough to earn another chance in the NHL, signing with the Boston Bruins for the 2006–07 season and appearing in 49 games with Boston. York suffered 3 knee injuries that season which ended his career. He scored one goal for Boston, on February 20, 2007, in the Bruins&#x27; 3-0 win at Toronto. It was his final NHL goal.

In 757 NHL games over 13 seasons, York recorded 42 goals and 187 assists for 229 points, along with 621 penalty minutes. He added 2 goals and 9 points in 34 playoff games, getting as far as the second round once (in 1998, when the Senators were eliminated by the eventual Stanley Cup finalist Washington Capitals).

==Post-retirement==
York started his broadcasting career in 2008 on Ottawa&#x27;s all-sports radio station, TSN 1200 after completing the NHLPA life after hockey broadcasting program at Quinnipiac University. From 2008 to 2013 York co-hosted the daily afternoon-drive show &quot;The Healthy Scratches&quot; and later went on to co-host the mid morning show, In The Box, both with Steve Lloyd. York also dabbled in writing as well with the Ottawa Sun where he wrote his weekly column, the York State of Mind during his time on Ottawa Sports radio. In 2011, York also began appearing on Sportsnet television broadcasts for Ottawa Senators games, adding commentary with co-host Ian Mendes, and later with Shawn McKenzie. With the move of the Senators to TSN in 2014 York took on a new larger role with Sportsnet as the television colour analyst for the Montreal Canadiens with John Bartlett. York also has begun working on Hockey Night in Canada as a colour analyst.

On July 19, 2017, York as part of an ownership group, purchased the Kemptville 73&#x27;s of the Central Canada Hockey League, from former NHL goaltender Ron Tugnutt. York was also installed as the team&#x27;s director of hockey operations.

<text>Gaussian is a general purpose computational chemistry software package initially released in 1970 by John Pople and his research group at Carnegie Mellon University as Gaussian 70. It has been continuously updated since then. The name originates from Pople&#x27;s use of Gaussian orbitals to speed up molecular electronic structure calculations as opposed to using Slater-type orbitals, a choice made to improve performance on the limited computing capacities of then-current computer hardware for Hartree–Fock calculations. The current version of the program is Gaussian 16. Originally available through the Quantum Chemistry Program Exchange, it was later licensed out of Carnegie Mellon University, and since 1987 has been developed and licensed by Gaussian, Inc.

Other programs named &#x27;Gaussian XX&#x27; were placed among the holdings of the Quantum Chemistry Program Exchange. These were unofficial, unverified ports of the program to other computer platforms.

==License controversy==
In the past, Gaussian, Inc. has attracted controversy for its licensing terms that stipulate that researchers who develop competing software packages are not permitted to use the software. Some scientists consider these terms overly restrictive. The anonymous group &quot;bannedbygaussian.org&quot; has published a list of scientists whom it claims are not permitted to use GAUSSIAN software. These assertions were repeated by Jim Giles in 2004 in &quot;Nature&quot;. The controversy was also noted in 1999 by &quot;Chemical and Engineering News&quot; (repeated without additional content in 2004), and in 2000, the World Association of Theoretically Oriented Chemists Scientific Board held a referendum of its executive board members on this issue with a majority (23 of 28) approving the resolution opposing the restrictive licenses.

Gaussian, Inc. disputes the accuracy of these descriptions of its policy and actions, noting that all of the listed institutions do in fact have licenses for everyone but directly competing researchers. They also claim that not licensing competitors is standard practice in the software industry and members of the Gaussian collaboration community have been refused licenses from competing institutions.

<doc id="734162" wikidata="Q180051" url="?curid=734162" title="Corsican nuthatch">
<text>The Corsican nuthatch (Sitta whiteheadi) is a species of bird in the nuthatch family Sittidae. It is a relatively small nuthatch, measuring about in overall length. The are bluish-grey, the greyish-white. The male is distinguished from the female by its entirely black . The species is sedentary, territorial and not very shy. It often feeds high in Corsican pines (&quot;Pinus nigra&quot; var. &quot;corsicana&quot;, syn. &quot;P. nigra&quot; subsp. &quot;laricio&quot;), consuming mainly pine seeds, but also catching some flying insects. The breeding season takes place between April and May; the nest is placed in the trunk of an old pine, and the clutch has five to six eggs. The young fledge 22 to 24 days after hatching.

The Corsican nuthatch is found only on the island of Corsica, where it populates the old forests of high altitude Corsican pines, descending lower in winter. Its scientific name comes from John Whitehead, the ornithologist who brought the bird to the attention of the scientific community in 1883. The Corsican nuthatch is closely related to the Chinese nuthatch (&quot;S. villosa&quot;) and the red-breasted nuthatch (&quot;S. canadensis&quot;). It is threatened by loss of nesting sites and habitat fragmentation, with an estimated population size of about 2,000 individuals, possibly in moderate decline. Due to the small population size and the limited range, the conservation status of the Corsican nuthatch is classed as &quot;vulnerable&quot; by the International Union for Conservation of Nature.

== Taxonomy ==
===Discovery and studies===

The Corsican nuthatch was discovered when ornithologist John Whitehead went to observe alpine swifts (&quot;Tachymarptis melba&quot;) on 13 June 1883. Whitehead, who had spent much of the previous years in Corsica, spotted and shot a male Corsican nuthatch. He kept the specimen&#x27;s skin and did not bother with it until October, when he asked Richard Bowdler Sharpe for help in naming some small birds he had collected; although the bird&#x27;s head was damaged by the collection method, Sharpe assured him that the species was not yet described. Whitehead thought the bird was extremely localised and did not give the precise locality where he collected the first specimens for fear that the species would be exterminated by additional collections.

Whitehead returned to Corsica in May 1884 and found a male, which he recognised by its black . After killing it, he waited to see the accompanying female, killed it as well, and then collected three more specimens from a small flock. In the following days, he observed a pair coming and going with nesting material in a hole six meters above the ground in the trunk of a very old pine. He located other nests, some above the ground, and opened two of them, finding 5 eggs in each, which he collected.

The Italian ornithologist Enrico Hillyer Giglioli reported in 1890 that he had observed the bird on 16 September 1877 at Ponte Leccia, almost six years before Whitehead, but mistaking it for a Eurasian nuthatch (&quot;S. europaea&quot;), he did not bother to shoot it. In the spring of 1896, the German naturalist Alexander Koenig visited the forest of Vizzavona and collected with great difficulty five specimens; in the early autumn of 1900, Arnold Duer Sapsworth brought back some skins. For the first, the breeding season had not begun at the time of his visit and for the second, it was over; no additional eggs were therefore brought back during this period. The next collections were made between 1908 and 1909 by the British ornithologist Francis Charles Robert Jourdain, who provided some additional field notes and explained the difficulty of accessing the nests.

The first works concerning the biology of the bird were only carried out in the 1960s by the German ornithologist Hans Löhrl, who studied the reproduction, feeding and behaviour of the species. In 1976, Claude Chappuis described the voice of the species in an article dedicated to the vocalisations of birds from Corsica and the Balearic Islands. In the 1980s, the Italian ornithologists Pierandrea Brichetti and Carlo Di Capi studied the reproduction of the Corsican nuthatch. Since the 1990s, the species has been studied closely by local groups, and in particular by ornithologists Jean-Claude Thibault, Pascal Villard and Jean-François Seguin.

In the summer of 2006, a Dutch group participating in an entomological expedition incidentally observed a pair of nuthatches in the Altai, near the meeting point of China, Kazakhstan, Mongolia and Russia, in a pure Siberian larch (&quot;Larix sibirica&quot;) forest. The male had a black crown, and the female did not, and both had a dark topped by a white supercilium. The closest species geographically that might fit this description is the Chinese nuthatch (&quot;S. villosa&quot;), which would then be far from its known distribution, and which has more buffy underparts than the observed individuals but they were also close to Corsican nuthatch in appearance. This record could be indicative of a much wider distribution of the Chinese species, or the bird could be an as yet undescribed species related to &quot;S. whiteheadi&quot; and &quot;S. villosa&quot;.

===Nomenclature===
The Corsican nuthatch was described by Sharpe in March 1884, based on the first male specimen collected by Whitehead, after who it was given the specific name. Whitehead sent a second male to Sharpe, who presented it in May to the Zoological Society of London. In June, Sharpe completed the description of the species after Whitehead sent him a female. The Corsican nuthatch is sometimes placed in a subgenus, &quot;Sitta&quot; subgen. &quot;Micrositta&quot;, described by the Russian ornithologist Sergei Buturlin in 1916, and has no subspecies.

The Corsican nuthatch was subsequently considered a subspecies of the red-breasted nuthatch (&quot;S. canadensis&quot;) from 1911 until the 1950s. In 1957, American ornithologist Charles Vaurie explained that the morphology did not allow one to be sure that the Corsican nuthatch was a distinct species, and that it was probably better to consider it as belonging to the &quot;S. canadensis&quot; group, regrouping the species &quot;S. canadensis&quot;, &quot;S. whiteheadi&quot; and &quot;S. villosa&quot;; The German ornithologist Hans Löhrl, after studying the ecology and behaviour of the birds of Latin America and Corsica, and through the publication of his field notes between 1960 and 1961, disagreed with Vaurie&#x27;s position. In 1976, the French ornithologist Jacques Vielliard described the Algerian nuthatch (&quot;S. ledanti&quot;), just discovered in Algeria by Jean-Paul Ledant. He devoted part of his article on the possible relationships of the different species and their evolutionary history. Vielliard suggests that Vaurie stopped at &quot;a superficial morphological similarity&quot; to bring the Corsican nuthatch closer to the red-breasted nuthatch, and that the Corsican species should rather form with Krüper&#x27;s nuthatch (&quot;S. krueperi&quot;) a group known as the &quot;Mesogean nuthatches&quot;, &quot;where &quot;S. ledanti&quot; providentially fits in&quot;.

===Molecular phylogeny and evolution===
In 1998, Eric Pasquet studied the cytochrome b of the mitochondrial DNA of a dozen nuthatch species, including the various species of the &quot;Sitta canadensis&quot; group, which he defined as comprising six species, which are also those of what is sometimes treated as the subgenus &quot;Sitta&quot; subgenus &quot;Micrositta&quot;: &quot;S. canadensis&quot;, &quot;S. villosa&quot;, &quot;S. yunnanensis&quot;, &quot;S. whiteheadi&quot;, &quot;S. krueperi&quot; and &quot;S. ledanti&quot;. Pasquet concludes that the Corsican nuthatch is phylogenetically related to the Chinese nuthatch and the red-breasted nuthatch, these three species forming the sister group to a clade including Krüper&#x27;s nuthatch and the Algerian nuthatch. The first three species would even be close enough to constitute subspecies, rejecting Vielliard&#x27;s &quot;mesogean&quot; theory and thus confirming Vaurie&#x27;s conclusions. For the sake of taxonomic stability, however, all retain their full species status. In 2014, Eric Pasquet and colleagues published a phylogeny based on nuclear and mitochondrial DNA of 21 nuthatch species and confirmed the relationships of the 1998 study within the &quot;&quot;S. canadensis&quot; group&quot;, adding the Yunnan nuthatch, which was found to be the most basal of the species. The study findings align with the morphology of the species, the red-breasted nuthatch, Corsican nuthatch and Chinese nuthatch sharing as a derived character the entirely black crown only present in males, a unique trait in the Sittidae and related families. The second clade, which includes Krüper&#x27;s and Algerian nuthatches, has a black front crown only in males, this sexual dimorphism being absent in young individuals.

The phylogeny established, Pasquet concludes that the paleogeographic history of the group would be as follows: the divergence between the two main clades of the &quot;&quot;S. canadensis&quot; group&quot; appears more than five million years ago, at the end of the Miocene, when the clade of &quot;S. krueperi&quot; and &quot;S. ledanti&quot; settles in the Mediterranean basin at the time of the Messinian salinity crisis; the two species constituting it diverge 1.75 million years ago. The other clade split into three with populations leaving Asia from the east, giving rise to the red-breasted nuthatch, and then from the west, about one million years ago, marking the separation between the Corsican and Chinese nuthatches. Current distributions do not necessarily accurately reflect ancestral ones, however, and the Corsican nuthatch may be a paleoendemic that once had a much wider distribution and underwent reductions in distribution; &quot;trapped&quot; in Corsica, it would have evolved by vicariance.

The simplified cladogram below is based on the phylogenetic analysis of Packert and colleagues (2014):

== Description ==
===Plumage and measurements===
The Corsican nuthatch is a small bird, measuring long with a wingspan of and a weight of . The folded wing measures , the relatively short tail measures , and the tarsus and beak measure . The head is small and the is short for a nuthatch. It is thin and blackish grey, black on its tip. The eyes are black, the legs and toes are light brown.

The are overall bluish grey, the belly pale greyish buff with the throat whiter. The male has a black crown and forehead, and a black eyestripe, separated from the crown by a broad, sharp white supercilium. In females, the crown and eyebrow line are the same grey as the back. In both sexes, the sides of the head as well as the throat are white; the , overall greyish white, are more or less shaded with buff. The outer rectrices are black with white spots and grey tips. The birds undergo a complete moult every year after the breeding season. Sexual dimorphism appears eleven days after hatching, and fledged young have a plumage close to that of adults. As juveniles, they remain duller, with some brown on the large coverts.

===Vocalisations===

The contact call is a light, whistling &quot;pu&quot;, which the bird repeats in series of five to six notes, in &quot;pupupupu&quot;. When agitated, this nuthatch emits a &quot;rough and stretched, slowly repeated&quot; &quot;pchèèhr&quot;, as might a common starling (&quot;Sturnus vulgaris&quot;), or a &quot;psch-psch-psch&quot; that turns into a &quot;chay-chay-chay&quot; or &quot;sch-wer&quot;, &quot;sch-wer&quot; when more agitated. The song, described as a &quot;clear, sonorous, rapid &quot;dididididi&quot; [and of] variable rhythm&quot;, meanwhile, is reminiscent of the alpine swift; the contact call is a similar trill. It &quot;sings fairly regularly in the spring&quot;, but is more discreet during the breeding season.

===Similar species===
The Corsican nuthatch is the only nuthatch found in Corsica, however, it may be reminiscent of the coal tit (&quot;Parus ater&quot;), which is common in Corsican forests and has similar markings on its head. The Eurasian nuthatch which inhabits nearby mainland France is larger, has no black on the crown and has yellow (or white for some subspecies) underparts tending to orange around the rump. In the original description, Sharpe likened it morphologically to the Chinese nuthatch, which however has more brightly coloured underparts, and to Krüper&#x27;s nuthatch, which is the same size and has the same colour upperparts, but has a reddish-brown area on the underparts that is absent in the Corsican species. The Corsican nuthatch is also similar to the red-breasted nuthatch, which is found only in North America, but has yellowish underparts. Finally, the Corsican species most closely resembles the Algerian nuthatch, from Babor Mountains, which can be distinguished by its paler underparts, whitish sides of the head, and by the male&#x27;s crown, which has only the black front.

== Distribution and habitat ==
The Corsican nuthatch is the only species of bird endemic to Corsica, and even to metropolitan France. Its range covers the majority of the island, which is very mountainous. This bird is found from the Tartagine-Melaja forest in the north to the Ospedale forest in the south, but it is particularly abundant in the Monte Cinto, Monte Rotondo, Monte Renoso and Monte Incudine massifs. There are also two isolated populations, in Castagniccia in the northeast of the island, and in the Cagna mountain in the south.

The Corsican nuthatch favours Corsican pine (&quot;Pinus nigra&quot; var. &quot;corsicana&quot;) forests interspersed with clearings; their Mediterranean climate habitat is fairly dry in the summer (three weeks to two months of drought) and experiences heavy rainfall and/or snow in the winter (total per year). This nuthatch is sedentary; it generally lives in deep valleys between and above sea level between April and October, but can be found from , although the more open forests at higher elevations are less suitable. It descends lower in winter, and may then inhabit mixed forests of Corsican and maritime pines (&quot;Pinus pinaster&quot;) or forests of silver fir (&quot;Abies alba&quot;); however, its stand indices are significantly lower than in pure Corsican pine forests. It avoids hardwood-dominated or mixed woodlands.

Old pines provide the nuthatch with abundant food, and the species is absent from sectors where trees are less than diameter, and where the Corsican pine is in the minority compared to other species. The places most likely to hold Corsican nuthatches have large trees (over high) and large diameter (over ). The preference of the bird for the Corsican pine over the maritime pine could be explained by the toughness of the seeds of the latter. From a historical perspective, Thibault and colleagues explain in 2002 that &quot;the Corsican nuthatch and the Corsican pine, probably present on the island since at least the middle of the Quaternary, had to face the last climatic fluctuations of the Pleistocene, which caused deep modifications in the composition and distribution of the vegetation. It is likely that the nuthatch survived in the Corsican pines throughout this period.

== Behaviour and ecology==
Like all nuthatches, the Corsican nuthatch can move head down along branches, and is rarely found on the ground. It is a territorial bird and is not shy. It lives in monogamous pairs evolving all year long on the same territory of three to ten hectares, the two birds of the couple defending it from intruders, of the same species or of another. The home range, the area where the birds generally live within their territory, varies in size, depending on the season and age of the birds, but especially on the cone production of the pines.

===Food and feeding===

The Corsican nuthatch consumes mainly pine seeds, but also small insects in summer. From March to November, small arthropods (adult insects and their larvae, spiders) represent the main part of its diet; it catches them in flight but more generally in the trees; it makes a quarter of its captures in flight, from a lookout post, and exploits the rest of the time the substrates provided by the trees. In spring and summer, it is more likely to be found in the treetops, foraging high up in the foliage of pine trees, at the end of branches, like a tit; in autumn, however, it searches for food along the trunks and on large branches, and may also form mixed feeding flocks with other small passerines outside the breeding season. November marks the beginning of the opening of pine cones, from which the Corsican nuthatch extracts seeds with its fine bill. In years of high production, the nuthatch may find food resources in the cones until March. As nuthatches often do, the Corsican nuthatch hides some seeds under the bark or under lichens or plant debris, and consumes them in the off-season, especially when early spring snows prevent access to pine cones, or when cones remain closed on wet, cold days. This use of hiding places may also partly explain the bird&#x27;s complete sedentary ecology.

===Breeding===
Male Corsican nuthatches begin singing in late December, but the breeding season occurs in April–May. In years of high cone production, breeding occurs early; in years of low production, nuthatches must wait until insects are present in large quantities. The species depends for its nesting on conifers that are two to three hundred years old with sufficiently soft trunks, dead, worm-eaten or partially struck by lightning. The Corsican nuthatch favours dead trees that still have some branches, which can be used as a singing post, as a stalking post or to monitor the surroundings, but the height of the trunk, the surrounding pine cover or the diameter of the trunk are not significant.

A 2005 study reported that the nests of different pairs were located apart depending on the year (between 1998 and 2003). Both members of the pair excavate the nest, often reusing cavities excavated by great spotted woodpeckers (&quot;Dendrocopos major&quot;), but avoiding the high risk of predation from the former nests of these birds. There can be two entrances to the cavity if the trunk is particularly rotten. The entrance is wide, and the cavity averages with an average depth of . The nest is placed between above the ground. It is made of various plant materials (pine needles, bark, and shavings) and lined with softer materials such as feathers, moss, horsehair, or lichen.

The female lays in late April or early May, four to six (average 5.1) oval white eggs with reddish-brown spots, especially on the broad end, with &quot;a few faint brown or dark grey-purple markings. Whitehead compares the eggs in size to those of the great tit (&quot;Parus major&quot;); according to Jourdain, who compares 42 eggs (14 collected by Whitehead, the other 28 by himself), they measure on average . The average weight, calculated for 17 of these eggs, is 82.2 milligrams. Brooding lasts from 14 to 17 days; it is carried out by the female alone, which the male feeds on average 3.2 times per hour. The beak and wing of the chicks grow steadily, while the tarsus stabilises by the twelfth day; the crown darkens by the eleventh day, and the young are fully plumaged after an average of twenty days.

The brood usually has 3 to 6 (average 4.3) fledglings, which leave the nest at an age of 22 to 24 days. If the first brood fails or is lost, the pair makes a second brood between 28 May and 16 June; one-third of these replacement broods are made in another tree. From one year to the next, nearly half of the pairs change trees to nest in. The young may breed at one year of age. The annual survival rate has been estimated at 61.6% for males (more than three out of five individuals make it through the year); life expectancy is poorly known, but colour ringing has shown that a small number of individuals can reach six years old.

== Threats and conservation ==
===Numbers and status===
An estimate from the 1960s–1980s counted 2,000 to 3,000 pairs, spread over , whereas in the 1950s there were nearly 3,000 pairs over . In 2000, Thibault and colleagues estimated the numbers at 2,075–3,010 pairs. In 2013, according to the International Union for Conservation of Nature, Thibault and colleagues estimate the Corsican nuthatch population at 3,100–4,400 mature individuals, or 4,600–6,600 birds in total. A 2011 estimate of the range put it at . The Corsican nuthatch was considered by the International Union for Conservation of Nature as &quot;near threatened&quot; in 1988, and &quot;least concern&quot; in 2004, 2008 and 2009. Since 2010, it has been considered &quot;vulnerable&quot;, with Thibault and colleagues estimating a 10% decline over the previous ten years in a 2011 paper.

===Threats===

The decrease in numbers can be explained by fire and logging; the Corsican pines to which the species is attached regenerate less quickly than they otherwise disappear, and the felling of dead pines poses problems for the nesting of this nuthatch. In addition to destroying the birds&#x27; territories, regrowth after fire may result in the replacement of Corsican pine by maritime pine or holm oak (&quot;Quercus ilex&quot;). A study carried out on the consequences of the fires of the summer of 2000, which affected several large Corsican massifs, concluded that the direct consequences (disappearance of territories) and indirect consequences (difficulties in nesting and feeding in winter) could have affected 4% of the species&#x27; population. For the same period in the Restonica gorges, 6 out of 12 territories were lost. The major impacts of the forest fires of August 2003 also led to a decline in the population, which was reduced by 37.5% the following spring.

Predators of the Corsican nuthatch include the great spotted woodpecker, which may attack nests and young birds by enlarging the nest cavity to gain access to nuthatch offspring; not all individuals necessarily attack nests, and nuthatches and woodpeckers may even nest in the same tree. The garden dormouse (&quot;Eliomys quercinus&quot;) is also a potential predator, having been observed sleeping in a nest and suspected of several losses; to a lesser extent, the Eurasian sparrowhawk (&quot;Accipiter nisus&quot;) could include the Corsican nuthatch among its prey: nuthatch remains were reported in the diet of one of these birds of prey in 1967, and Löhrl reported in 1988 that the Corsican nuthatches he raised in captivity would hide at the sight of a raptor. The Eurasian jay (&quot;Garrulus glandarius&quot;) may also be a more or less important predator of fledglings.

The study of the habitat structure of the Corsican nuthatch has shown that the fragmentation of its habitat, which leads to a local concentration of populations, could be a new threat. Nuthatches avoid open areas and young plantations that present an increased risk of predation, only crossing them if these areas are sufficiently narrow. A 2011 study attempted to quantify the impact of global warming on the future distribution of Corsican and maritime pines; taking only climate disruption into account, it is likely that by 2100, 98% of the Corsican nuthatch&#x27;s range will still be likely to support it, and that this distribution may even expand by 10%. The bird&#x27;s habitat is more threatened by the increase in frequency and severity of fires and increases in human activity in forests than by direct climate change.

===Protection===

The Corsican nuthatch is fully protected on French territory by virtue of article 3 of the decree of 29 October 2009, establishing the list of protected birds on the whole territory and the modalities of their protection; it is also listed in Annex I of the European Union Birds Directive and in Annex II of the Berne Convention. It is therefore forbidden to destroy, mutilate, capture or remove it, to intentionally disturb it or naturalise it, as well as to destroy or remove eggs and nests, and to destroy, alter or degrade its environment. Whether alive or dead, it is also prohibited to transport, peddle, use, hold, sell or buy it.

It is estimated that 9-11% of the individuals are located in eight of the Special Protection Areas of the Birds Directive. Less than another five percent of the estimated population is found in two managed biological reserves and six integral biological reserves. In addition to fire prevention and control, specific measures are envisaged for the protection of the species, mainly focused on forestry methods and strategies: the first priority is to be given to the structure of the habitat; the second priority is given to the presence of nesting sites.

===In culture===
The Corsican nuthatch is sometimes referred to as Whitehead&#x27;s nuthatch, and it also has a variety of local names in the Corsican language, such as &quot;pichjarina&quot;, &quot;pichja sorda&quot; or &quot;furmicula&quot;, and &quot;capinera&quot;, used at least in Corte. The species remains relatively unknown to the public. The regional natural park of Corsica has published a small comic strip on the bird, and the &quot;Corsican ornithological group&quot; (GOC) has chosen the species as its logo, represented in a very refined form. In the forest of Aïtone, near Évisa, the National Forestry Office has created a &quot;nuthatch trail&quot;, which is one of the places where the species can be more easily observed.

<doc id="734175" wikidata="Q1045919" url="?curid=734175" title="Keesler Air Force Base">
<text>Keesler Air Force Base is a United States Air Force base located in Biloxi, a city along the Gulf Coast in Harrison County, Mississippi, United States. The base is named in honor of aviator 2d Lt Samuel Reeves Keesler Jr., a Mississippi native killed in France during the First World War. The base is home of Headquarters, Second Air Force (2 AF) and the 81st Training Wing (81 TW) of the Air Education and Training Command (AETC).

The base has specialized in ground trade training since its opening in 1941 during World War II. It has had high-quality technical schools and absorbed units moved from other bases under the Base Realignment and Closure Act (BRAC).

==History==
In early January 1941, Biloxi city officials assembled a formal offer to invite the United States Army to build a base to support the World War II training buildup. The War Department activated Army Air Corps Station No. 8, Aviation Mechanics School, Biloxi, Mississippi, on 12 June 1941. On August 25, 1941, the base was dedicated as Keesler Army Airfield, in honor of 2d Lt Samuel Reeves Keesler Jr., a Mississippi native and distinguished aerial observer, killed in action in France during the First World War.

Congress initially appropriated $6 million for construction at Biloxi and an additional $2 million for equipment. By the time the War Department allocated the funds in April 1941, the projected cost had risen to $9.6 million. On 14 June 1941, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers awarded contracts totaling $10 million to build Biloxi&#x27;s technical training school. At the time, it was the most expensive government project to have been undertaken in the State of Mississippi.

When the War Department activated Keesler Field in June 1941, not only was Keesler getting a technical training center, but it would be getting one of the Army&#x27;s newest replacement, or basic training centers. The first shipment of recruits arrived at Keesler Field on 21 August 1941. Many stayed at Keesler to become airplane and engine mechanics, while others transferred to aerial gunnery or aviation cadet schools. Development of the base stimulated businesses and residential construction in Biloxi.

The Tuskegee Airmen were trained at Keesler. More than 7,000 Black soldiers were stationed at Keesler Field by the autumn of 1943. These soldiers included pre-aviation cadets, radio operators, aviation technicians, bombardiers, and aviation mechanics.


Keesler continued to focus upon specialized training in Consolidated B-24 Liberator maintenance until mid-1944. Thereafter, the base expanded its curricula to train mechanics for other aircraft. By September 1944, the number of recruits had dropped, but the workload remained constant. Keesler personnel began processing veteran ground troops and combat crews who had returned from duty overseas for additional training and follow-on assignments. The number of men who went through basic training wound down markedly after the end of World War II, and it was discontinued at Keesler on 30 June 1946.

===Cold War===
In late May 1947, the Radar School was established at Keesler (transferred from Boca Raton Army Air Field), making it responsible for operating the two largest military technical schools in the United States. Thereafter, shrinking budgets forced the base to reduce its operating costs: the Airplane and Engine Mechanics School and the Radar School were consolidated on 1 April 1948.

In early 1949, the Radio Operations School transferred to Keesler from Scott Air Force Base, Illinois. In addition to training radio operators, Keesler was to begin teaching air traffic service technicians; aircraft approach controllers, ground radar mechanics, and radar repairman/ground controlled approach specialists. The last mechanics training courses had moved to Sheppard Air Force Base, Texas, by November.

In early 1956, Keesler entered the missile age by opening a ground support training program for the Atlas missile. In 1958, all control tower operator, radio maintenance, and general radio operator courses were put under Keesler&#x27;s already broad technical training roof.

&quot;Since August 1948, the 3380th Technical Training Wing had controlled all base activities. 
Under it were four [groups]: the 3380th Technical Training Group, which operated the school; the 3380th Maintenance and Supply Group; the 3380th Air Base Group; and the 3380th Medical Group. In 1955, a fifth group was added—the 3380th Installations Group. That arrangement continued until 1 January 1959, when Air Training Command redesignated the wing as Headquarters, Keesler Technical Training Center (KTTC). At the same time, the training 
group was redesignated the 3380th Technical School, USAF, and all of its subodinate student squadrons were renamed school squadrons.&quot;(81 TRW Brief History 2011)

During the early 1960s, Keesler lost many of its airborne training courses, but it remained the largest training base throughout the 1970s. This included limited flight training operations in the T-28 Trojan for Republic of Vietnam Air Force (VNAF) student pilots.

Hurricane Camille produced considerable damage as it passed over Biloxi in 1969. Most of the Back Bay housing area was under water.

&quot;On 31 May 1972, Air Training Command redesignated the 3380th Technical School as the USAF School of Applied Aerospace Sciences. Soon after on 13 December, the school received institutional accreditation from the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools. As a result, Airmen trained at Keesler received a Career Educational Certificate from the newly established Community College of the Air Force. This opportunity was further expanded in April 1977, when Keesler graduates became eligible to apply their technical training 
towards an Associate of Arts degree.&quot;(81 TRW Brief History 2011)

Keesler&#x27;s student load dropped to an all-time low after the Vietnam War ended. As a result, Air Training Command inactivated the USAF School of Applied Aerospace Sciences on 1 April 1977 and replaced it with the 3300th Technical Training Wing, which activated the same day.

During the early 1980s Keesler&#x27;s air traffic control program garnered publicity when the Professional Air Traffic Controllers Organization walked off the job in August 1981. When President Ronald Reagan fired the strikers, Keesler-trained military air traffic controllers were used to direct some of the nation&#x27;s air traffic. As the air traffic control school it was also the logical location for the USAF Combat Controllers.

Keesler AFB was the primary training base for many avionics maintenance career fields, including Electronic Warfare, Navigational Aids, Computer Repair and Ground Radio Repair. It was also the primary training base for most USAF administrative career fields.

===From the 1990s===
Driven by defense budget cuts, base closures following the end of the Cold War forced an end to technical training at Chanute Air Force Base, Illinois, and Lowry Air Force Base, Colorado, when those bases were closed by Base Realignment and Closure Commission (BRAC) actions. Keesler acquired Chanute&#x27;s weather forecasting courses and Lowry&#x27;s meteorology and precision measurement equipment laboratory training programs during 1992 and 1993.

Massive restructuring of the Air Force in the early 1990s also meant several changes for Keesler associate units. The first occurred when the 53d Weather Reconnaissance Squadron was inactivated in the active duty Air Force, transferred to the Air Force Reserve and reactivated on 30 June 1991.

On 1 July 1993, the Air Training Command (ATC) was redesignated the Air Education and Training Command (AETC) and the command reactivated Second Air Force (2nd AF), stationing it at Keesler. Second Air Force&#x27;s mission is to oversee all technical training conducted within AETC. The same day, Keesler Training Center was inactivated, and the 81st Training Wing arrived at the base. The 45th Airlift Squadron (45 AS), part of the 314th Airlift Wing at Little Rock AFB, Arkansas, was also located at Keesler. The 45th AS provided flight crew training in the C-21 Learjet until 2007, when it moved to Scott AFB. 
On 29 August 2005 Keesler sustained a direct hit from Hurricane Katrina, which made its third Gulf Coast landfall as a Category 3 storm approximately to the west. Although non-essential personnel and Hurricane Hunter planes had been evacuated in advance, &quot;drastic damage&quot; was sustained by the base&#x27;s industrial and housing areas. Due to storm surge about 50% of the base came under water; the commissary, base exchange, and some base housing units were flooded with more than six feet of water. By August 31, however, relief flights were landing at the base. On September 1 the first set of Airmen were evacuated to Sheppard AFB, TX. Other Airmen reached Sheppard AFB the next day, where they were welcomed and given basic items.

===Units today===
From 1993, the 81 TRW has provided technical training of airmen in select skill areas immediately following their completion of basic training, as well as providing additional or recurrent training. On average, Keesler has 3,100 students on base at a time. Much of the training they receive is in the field of electronics, such as wideband maintenance, ground radio, information technology, avionics, cryptography. The wing also trains meteorology personnel, radar operations, air traffic control, Aviation Resource Management (ARMS), and tropical cyclone forecasting. Keesler AFB is one of the largest technical training wings in AETC, with four training squadrons located in the training building complex known as &quot;the triangle,&quot; the 334th, 335th, 336th, and the 338th. The 81st Medical Group is also located at the base and operates the second largest medical center in the Air Force.

The Air Force Reserve Command&#x27;s 403d Wing is also on base, and is an Air Mobility Command (AMC)-gained composite unit. It has an airlift squadron (the 815th Airlift Squadron), and the 53rd Weather Reconnaissance Squadron, a WC-130 unit known as the &quot;Hurricane Hunters.&quot;

Finally, Keesler is also home to CNATTU Keesler (Center for Naval Aviation Technical Training Unit), a training unit for U.S. Navy and U.S. Marine Corps enlisted personnel receiving training at Keesler, such as enlisted meteorology training, with their Air Force counterparts.

<doc id="734181" wikidata="Q2714026" url="?curid=734181" title="Tyranny and Mutation">
<text>Tyranny and Mutation (stylized on the cover as &quot;THE BLVE ÖYSTER CVLT: TYRANNY AND MVTATION&quot;), the second studio album by American rock band Blue Öyster Cult, was released in February 1973 by Columbia Records. It was produced by Murray Krugman and Sandy Pearlman. On May 12, 1973, the album peaked at No. 122 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 chart.

The only single released from the album, &quot;Hot Rails to Hell&quot;, did not chart.

==Composition and songs==
The album was recorded in late 1972 at Columbia Studios in New York City.

&quot;Baby Ice Dog&quot; features lyrics by singer/poet Patti Smith, who would make several more lyrical contributions to the band&#x27;s repertoire over its career.

The song &quot;The Red and the Black&quot;, with lyrics referencing the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, is a re-titled, re-recorded version of &quot;I&#x27;m on the Lamb But I Ain&#x27;t No Sheep&quot; from the band&#x27;s eponymous debut album. The song was later covered by the Minutemen and Band of Susans. AllMusic critic Hal Horowitz called it &quot;one of the best and most propulsive rockers in the BÖC catalog&quot;.

==Critical reception==

&quot;Tyranny and Mutation&quot; received mixed reviews from contemporary critics. Gordon Fletcher of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; wrote a rave review of the album and called Blue Öyster Cult &quot;one of the best bands America&#x27;s got&quot;. Robert Christgau, writing for &quot;The Village Voice&quot;, praised the band&#x27;s disregard for &quot;the entire heavy ethos&quot; but wondered if the &quot;parody-surreal refraction of the abysmal &#x27;poetry&#x27; of heavy&quot; in the lyrics could be a start for a return to conformism. &quot;The Rolling Stone Album Guide&quot; described the album as &quot;one molten hook after another&quot; and praised the four-song &quot;opening suite&quot; comprising the first side of the album.
However, Mike Saunders of &quot;Phonograph Record&quot; judged &quot;Tyranny and Mutation&quot; &quot;a real disappointment&quot;, definitely inferior to their debut album and lacking &quot;the sort of brashness that almost defines hard rock or metal music&quot;. Ian MacDonald of the British &quot;New Musical Express&quot; was very critical of the Pearlman/Meltzer &quot;crass Satan-speed-and-sadism&quot; lyrics and of the band&#x27;s music which &quot;tend to leave the listener aurally shaken, but emotionally unstirred.&quot;

Modern reviews are generally positive. Thom Jurek of AllMusic noted how BÖC &quot;brightened their sound and deepened their mystique&quot; on this album and described the music as &quot;screaming, methamphetamine-fueled rock &amp; roll that was all about attitude, mystery, and a sense of nihilistic humor that was deep in the cuff&quot;, judging &quot;Tyranny and Mutation&quot; just as much a &quot;classic album&quot; as its follow-up &quot;Secret Treaties&quot;. Martin Popoff in his &quot;Collector&#x27;s Guide to Heavy Metal&quot; acknowledged the progress achieved in production values compared with their debut but found the sound &quot;still mired in an oddly appealing maze of cobwebs&quot;, despite Blue Öyster Cult parading a slew of classic songs and &quot;quickly becoming something very imposing&quot;.

==Release history==
In addition to the conventional 2-channel stereo version, the album was also released in a 4-channel quadraphonic version on LP record and 8-track tape in 1974. The quad LP release was encoded in the SQ matrix system.

<doc id="734186" wikidata="Q141943" url="?curid=734186" title="Deux-Montagnes, Quebec">
<text>Deux-Montagnes () is a suburban municipality in Southwestern Quebec, Canada on the north shore of the Rivière des Mille Îles where it flows out of Lake of Two Mountains (French: &quot;Lac des Deux Montagnes&quot;). It is part of the Deux-Montagnes Regional County Municipality in the greater Montreal region. It is located from Montreal.
The name &quot;Deux-Montagnes&quot; (French for &quot;Two Mountains&quot;) dates to 1674 when it was given to the lake bordering on the municipality, and to the seigneury which stood north of the lake. Founded as the Village Municipality of Saint-Eustache-sur-le-Lac in 1921, it became a city in 1958, and changed its name to Deux-Montagnes in 1963.

==History==
Ten thousand years ago at the end of the pleistocene, the Champlain Sea covered a large part of southern Quebec and left behind the clay, sand and peat soil that is now under the city of Deux-Montagnes. When the sea retreated to the Atlantic Ocean, along the channel that is now the St-Lawrence River and its tributaries, the Rivière-des-Milles-Iles and the Lake of Two-Mountains, southern Quebec became a favourable area for hunting and gathering. (Plante p. 129)

===Parishes===

====Saint-Agapit Parish====

In 1930 a new chapel was built in response to a request from parishioners of St-Eustache-sur-le-lac, where Monseigneur George Gauthier, Archbishop of Montreal gave permission to replace the small Bélair chapel, that was &quot;located on the Chemin du Grand-Moulin at the foot of De La Chapelle street, on the banks of the Rivière des Mille Îles&quot;(Plante, p. 174). The Parish of Saint-Agapit was officially founded on July 7, 1946.
On April 12, 1961 a violent explosion occurred in the basement of the church while 150 children were inside. The children all ran out, and only the chimney remained from this incident.
On August 28, 1962 the new Saint-Agapit Church was officially inaugurated after parishioners carried numerous fundraisers to rebuild their church. (Plante p. 174-176)

====Holy Family Parish====

Most Reverend Emilien Frenette, who was then Bishop of Saint-Jerome, founded the Holy Family Parish on December 26, 1957. This parish served and continues to serve the English Catholic community of Deux-Montagnes. (Plante p. 178)

====Christ Church United====

The history of the United Church of Canada began in the early 1800s. By 1838, the English community of Protestants of St-Eustache built a church where its members attended until 1926. This community attended their first meeting on August 19, 1927, &quot;in the new church built by volunteers on the corner of 8th and Cedar avenues&quot; (Plante p. 179).

The first pastor of the Community Church of the United Church of Canada, Stan Kennedy was welcomed on July 1, 1953. During his charge, he decided to sell the church built in 1927. The new church was built on 14th avenue, across from the original Lake of Two-Mountains High School, on July 30, 1955. (Plante p. 180)

====People’s Church====

The Evangelical People’s Church, was built and founded on 5th avenue in April 1964. (Plante p. 181)

====All Saints Church====

In 1946 at the &quot;little yellow schoolhouse&quot;, a dozen faithful Anglicans met in a classroom and began the history of the Anglican community in Deux-Montagnes. Because of the demand for a bigger space, the congregation moved to a mansion on the corner of 11th avenue and Boulevard du Lac, and renovated and enlarged the premises. The church moved to a bigger location in 1955, on 18th avenue. (Plante p. 182)

==Infrastructure==
===Public Library===
In 1946, when the parish of St-Agapit was established, Father Chartrand, the parish’s first curate donated his selection of books to start a public library. These books were located in the rectory and then moved to the church basement. The books were eventually transferred to the local Club Femina where Annette Magnan offered many services in the St-Eustache-sur-le-lac library until her death in 1975. The books were sold and the Club Femina moved to other premises.

A group of citizens formed a committee in order to create a public library and the city adopted a by-law establishing the Municipal Library of Deux-Montagnes on January 12, 1978. The new books bought by the city council, were moved to the new premises in the community center on March 1, 1978. Internet access was introduced in the library in 1997 to further modernize the premises.

===Transportation===
The municipality has two commuter train stations, on the Deux-Montagnes line: Deux-Montagnes and Grand-Moulin. Both stations are now being rebuilt for use on the new Réseau express métropolitain network.

===Community associations===

*The Lions Club

==Education==
The Commission scolaire de la Seigneurie-des-Mille-Îles (CSSMI) operates Francophone schools. The Sir Wilfrid Laurier School Board (SWLSB) operates Anglophone schools.

The little yellow schoolhouse, located at the corner of 14th avenue and Chemin d’Oka, was the only educational institution during the 1940s. At the time, English and French students were accepted. A teacher earned $300 annually and was provided lodging on the second floor. The school was shut down in the 1960s because of a population increase in the area and the new construction of St-Jude School. (Plante p. 182)

===English language schools===
* Lake Of Two Mountains High School (LTM)
The original Lake of Two Mountains High School was at the corner of 14th avenue and Chemin d’Oka where its first class graduated in 1954. A new building was built in 1981 on Guy street and still stands here today.

The Lake of Two Mountains High School serves students from neighbouring towns including Deux-Montagnes, Kanesatake, Mirabel (St-Augustin Sector and St-Benoit sector), Oka, Pointe-Calumet, St-Joseph-du-Lac St-Eustache, St-Placide and St-Marthe-sur-le-lac.

* St. Jude Elementary School
In 1949 Saint-Jude Elementary School was built on Saint-Jude Street, behind the Saint-Agapit Church because the town was experiencing a population boom. In 1953, the school reached its total capacity of students and resulted in the building of the Sauvé School. (Plante p. 183)

* Mountainview Elementary School
Built in the early 1960s on the corner of Guy Street and 20th Avenue, St-Eustache sur-le-Lac Elementary School (as it was originally called) served the English-speaking, non-catholic (i.e.Protestant) community, before the implementation of the non-denominational school board system throughout Quebec. The school still operates today, as Mountainview Elementary, as part of the Sir-Wilfrid-Laurier School Board. (S. Menard, alumni).

====Elementary schools====
* École Sauvé
Sauvé Elementary School, opened in 1953, and taught children from grades 1 to 9. In 1957 a second floor was added to the building because of the growing number of children in St-Eustache-sur-le-Lac. In the 1959-60 school year, French primary students were taught on the first floor and English primary students were taught on the second floor. Because of the ongoing population growth, it was decided in 1961 that all French students would attend Sauvé School and all English Students would attend Saint-Jude School. (Plante p. 184)

<text>Westchester Community College (WCC) is a public community college in Valhalla, New York, in Westchester County. It is part of the State University of New York (SUNY) system.

==History==
New York state opened five coed technical institutes in 1946, one each in the communities of Buffalo, Binghamton, Utica, New York, and White Plains. The five institutes were operated and financially supported by the state. The Westchester County location in White Plains was called the New York Institute of Applied Arts and Sciences and was housed in a few rooms of the Battle Hill School. The state decided to close the schools in 1953, unless the five communities would accept operating responsibilities and share the financial costs with the state. All five communities decided to retain the institutes. Some members of the Westchester County Board of Supervisors objected to taking on the management of the New York Institute of Applied Arts and Sciences, but community organizations, such as women&#x27;s clubs, business men&#x27;s leagues, and civic associations, voiced support. Some even pledged scholarships. A deal was reached so that the financial burden would be shared equally between the state, county, and the student body, with each contributing one-third towards the school&#x27;s operating costs. On August 12, 1953, Westchester County announced that the Institute would be replaced with Westchester Community College beginning September 1, 1953.

New York governor Thomas E. Dewey appointed WCC&#x27;s first board of trustees, which was composed of &quot;successful lawyers, editors, manufacturers, labor readers and persons of varied racial backgrounds&quot;. The college&#x27;s first president was Dr. Philip C. Martin, and its first board chairman was Chauncey T.S. Fish. WCC began operating with a budget of $400,893. Original enrollment at the school was 550 men and women, paying in-state tuition of $125 per semester, and out-of-state tuition of $250 per semester. Westchester County billed the home counties of non-Westchester students an additional $125. The first courses available were in business administration, building construction, technologies (electrical, mechanical, industrial chemistry), food administration, and medical-dental office work. Originally, the college awarded Associate of Applied Sciences degrees. Night courses were offered, but did not count towards a degree. Additional instruction was provided in English, mathematics, and social sciences. Initial extracurricular activities included music, golf, basketball, track, chess, radio, and photography.

The salary range for faculty was $3,900-7,000, &quot;somewhat higher than most public schools&quot; in 1953, but required 12 months of work and no tenure was granted at the time. &quot;Minor employees&quot; of the college had a salary starting at $3,480, and the president received a salary of $12,400.

=== Search for a permanent location ===
Paying $30,000 per year in rent to the county, and facing eviction from the Battle Hill School facility, the college began looking for alternate housing. The trustees of State University of New York (SUNY) approved spending $25,000, matching a pledge by the county board, to plan for a permanent site for WCC. In April 1955, a ten-member committee was formed by County Executive James D. Hopkins investigated possible sites for Westchester Community College. In addition to &quot;many old estates&quot;, three main sites were available to the college: Ridge Road Park (Greenburgh), reservation land in White Plains on the Bronx River Parkway, and &quot;an used state normal school site&quot; in White Plains on North Street. By late in that year, sixteen properties had been examined, including lands located in parks, private estates, closed schools, and open countryside. The site committee agreed to a minimum of 100-acres for the college, and the state and county were sharing a capital commitment of $5,800,000 to build the new campus.

In August 1956, the site committee chose to locate the campus on the Ridge Road Park property in Hartsdale, then the estate of Henry J. Gaisman, an executive with The Gillette Company. The committee rejected more rural sites because of their distance from populated areas. The chosen property was within walking distance to the Hartsdale train station and to bus stops on Central Park Avenue. Hopkins and the committee asked the county to buy the property immediately, but Gaisman &quot;cooled to the idea&quot; and eventually prevented officials from entering the property. John H. Downing, a member of the board of supervisors, argued to have a northern Westchester site chosen instead of the Gaisman estate. The board argued that the 136 acre Gaisman property was best because of its central location in the county, and that 85% of the college&#x27;s students lived in southern Westchester and New York City. Gaisman continued to refuse to sell his property, and on October 1, 1956, the County Board of Supervisors voted 25 to 15 to acquire the land by means of condemnation. Before the county could legally act, Gaisman gifted the estate to the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of New York, forcing the site committee to look elsewhere.

With the Gaisman estate off the table, the county turned its attention to the 364-acre Valhalla estate of the late John A. Hartford, who was president of the Great Atlantic and Pacific Tea Company. The property, called Buena Vista Farm, was occupied by Yale University, which only used &quot;a few of the acres&quot;, but which had a contract with the Hartford Foundation to use the land until 1972. Yale conducted forestry research at the site, and had a $500,000 geophysics laboratory located there. On June 28, 1957, the county board voted 37 to 3 to purchase the Hartford site. The county&#x27;s contract with the Hartford Foundation specified that the land be used for &quot;educational and charitable&quot; purposes. Some county officials objected to the large site being used exclusively for the college. A compromise was reached to divide the land for use between the college and county recreation. Yale agreed to vacate its operations completely by August 31, 1958. The Hartford Foundation agreed to sell the property, valued in 1958 between $3,000,000-4,000,000, for only $750,000. The low price was offered to help lower the cost of tuition for students. With the land finally acquired and plans in place to relocate the college from the Battle Hill School to Valhalla by 1959, County Executive Hopkins vowed to expand the college into a 4-year school awarding bachelor&#x27;s degrees.

===Expansion===
In 1971, Joseph N. Hankin succeeded Martin as the college&#x27;s president. Hankin had previously been the director of evening and summer sessions, and then the president, of Harford Community College in Bel Air, Maryland. He continued to serve as president of WCC for more than 40 years, the longest serving community college president in the United States, until his retirement.

==Campus==
WCC&#x27;s main campus sits at an elevation of 500 ft (152 m), off of Grasslands Road in Valhalla, just north of White Plains. In 1780, this location was the site of a surprise attack by British and Hessian troops on American soldiers. The attack occurred at what was then called Young&#x27;s Corners (now Knollwood and Grasslands roads) at Young&#x27;s Tavern. When the troops marched off the fields, they encountered a group of American colonists, some the victims of smallpox, who were buried alive in snowdrifts. The land later belonged to the founder of Kensico Cemetery, Reiss Carpentar. He died in 1910, after being the victim of a swindle, and the land was then acquired by Joseph Daly. Daly used the property largely for breeding horses, and he later sold it to John Hartford.

A master plan for the college was completed in 1961, with plans for the buildings on campus. The plan included 8 buildings, and they were to be finished by 1988: the Engineering Technologies building (1962), the Student Center (1963), the Physical Education building (1964), the Classroom building (1967), the Learning Resource Center (1969), the Science building (1978), the Academic Arts building (1981), and the Administration building (1988). The Mount Kisco architecture firm of Kaeyer, Parker &amp; Garment designed the Science, Academic Arts, and Administration buildings. The Administration building was originally to have four floors, according to the master plan, but was scaled back to three after funding from the county and the New York State Dormitory Authority was reduced due to inflation.

The Learning Resource Center was renamed the Harold L. Drimmer Library in 1994, after a longtime chairman of the college&#x27;s board of trustees. The library was completely renovated and expanded in 2002, at a cost of $15 million. The new design was carried out by the firm Lothrop Associates, which doubled the size of the building to over 100,000 square feet. The updated building contains not only library facilities, but also computer training labs, a student lounge, and conference rooms. The building&#x27;s architect, Aaron B. Schwarz of Perkins Eastman architects, incorporated as much natural lighting as possible into the new design. The building&#x27;s facade has stones similar to the original Learning Resource Center building, to better match the existing look on campus. Schwarz received a Design Award in 2003 for the building, from the Westchester/Mid-Hudson chapter of the American Institute of Architects. A more recent addition was the Gateway Center which functions as a unique resource on the campus, housing the college&#x27;s Business Programs, Professional Development Center, and multi lingual programs. The design of this building was made by Ennead Architects, and structurally engineered by Leslie E. Robertson Associates. This building has won two awards; National Winner, AISC Ideas2 Award (2011), and Excellence in Structural Engineering, SEAoNY (2011).

===Extension sites===
In addition to the Valhalla campus, the college provides instruction at twelve other off-campus locations including extension centers in Peekskill, Ossining, White Plains, Mount Vernon, and Yonkers. In addition, it offers classes in Shrub Oak, New Rochelle, Mahopac and Port Chester. Other classes for programs such as &quot;Mainstream&quot; (for mature adults) are offered at various locations throughout the county. The Educational Opportunity Center is in Yonkers.

===Native Plant Center===
The Native Plant Center (NPC), a non-profit project of the Westchester Community College Foundation, is an affiliate of the Lady Bird Johnson Wildflower Center in Austin, Texas. The NPC, with the goal to educate the community on the value of native plants, presents various educational programs including workshops and conferences, is responsible for two demonstration gardens on the main campus, offers trips to gardens and horticultural displays, and coordinates an annual plant sale.

===Westchester Center for the Arts===

The Westchester Gallery is located in the Westechester Community College Center for the Arts in the County Center in White Plains. Located in the entryway of the Center for the Arts, the gallery hosts professional local, regional, and national artists, as well as the center&#x27;s yearly faculty and student art exhibitions. Exhibitions at the gallery are frequently accompanied by talks, lectures, and presentations from the featured artists, and draw audiences from around the county.

==Academics==
The college offers three associate degrees: associate of arts, associate of science, and associate of applied science.

The college&#x27;s curriculum is registered and approved by the New York State Education Department and offers associate degrees in forty areas and certificates in twenty. Courses are offered during spring and fall semesters as well as two sessions during the summer. In addition to courses leading to associate degrees or certificates, the college offers non-credit courses. The student body numbers 12,000.

===Admissions===

Although the college does not require SAT nor ACT scores, the ACCUPLACER placement tests are required in mathematics, reading, and writing to determine appropriate course placement based on the students performance. If the student scores in the low range, they will have to take developmental courses that do not issue credit upon successful completion but prepares the student for college-level curriculum prior to enrolling in college-level courses that issue credit. It is developed by the College Board which also develops the SAT and AP examinations.

==Student life==

Extracurricular and co-curricular activities at Westchester Community College include varsity, club, and intramural athletics; student publications; a variety of special interest clubs; a student government association; a student run programming board called the Westchester Events Board (WEB), who plans major social events; and cultural events.

<text>The Betsy Ross Bridge is a continuous steel truss bridge spanning the Delaware River from Philadelphia, Pennsylvania to Pennsauken, New Jersey. It was built from 1969 to 1974, and opened in April 1976, during the American Bicentennial Year. It was originally planned to be named as the &quot;Delair Bridge&quot;, after a paralleling vertical lift bridge owned by Pennsylvania Railroad, which is now used by Conrail Shared Assets Operations and New Jersey Transit&#x27;s Atlantic City Line (both bridges NJ terminus are in the Pennsauken neighborhood of Delair), but was instead later named for Betsy Ross, a Philadelphia seamstress and reputed creator of the first American flag in 1776. It was the first automotive bridge named for a woman in the United States, and the second U.S. bridge overall named for a woman after Iowa&#x27;s Boone High Bridge was renamed the Kate Shelley High Bridge in 1912.

Betsy Ross Bridge is located adjacent to the mouth of Frankford Creek. During construction, thousands of headstones from historic Monument Cemetery were used as riprap on the embankments built for the bridge, some of which can be seen along the edge of the Delaware River near the bridge during low tide.

Construction began in 1969, and was completed in 1974. However, the bridge did not open to traffic until April 30, 1976 due to numerous problems with the communities where the bridge&#x27;s ramps to and from Richmond Street were located. The problems, including traffic and especially heavy trucks, were also related to the highway route&#x27;s planned extension to the northwest from the Delaware River, across Northeast Philadelphia to connect with the Roosevelt Expressway. The cancellation of this extension, the planned Pennsylvania Route 90, known as the Pulaski Expressway, resulted in the so-called &quot;Evel Knievel&quot; ghost ramps with unfinished bridges and flyover ramps, some of which were later constructed to serve nearby Aramingo Avenue in Philadelphia&#x27;s Bridesburg section. The route serves as a high-level multi-lane with six lanes, separated by a concrete median barrier, bypassing the three-lane Tacony-Palmyra Bridge, which has a drawbridge on the span.

Construction in 1988 connected the bridge to New Jersey Route 90, allowing drivers to use Route 90 to access Route 73, rather than via U.S. Route 130.

In 1997, work to construct new ramps to the Pennsylvania side began. It was completed in 1999.

The bridge has a total length of , and a main span of . Though originally constructed with eight lanes, the bridge was reduced to six lanes with two shoulders in 2000, a median barrier was also paced on the deck. The bridge is owned and operated by the Delaware River Port Authority.

When approaching the exits from I-95 in Philadelphia for the bridge, drivers see signs referring to NJ Route 90. Beyond the toll plaza, which is on the New Jersey side, Route 90 continues as an expressway with maximum speed limit of , and in a few miles ends with a merge onto southbound Route 73. The toll plaza (westbound tolls only) is 12 lanes wide, and since 2000 has been a participating E-ZPass facility.

==Tolls==
A $6.00 one-way toll is charged entering Pennsylvania for passenger vehicles ( or less gross vehicle weight). An $18 credit is given on a per tag basis for New Jersey-issued E-ZPass tags that crossed one of the four DRPA bridges 18 times in a calendar month. This discount had been suspended in 2010 but was since reinstated. Trucks, commercial vehicles, mobile homes, and recreational vehicles (weighing at least gross vehicle weight) pay $9 cash per axle. Seniors aged 65 and over can use a discount program to pay $3.00 per trip with New Jersey E-ZPass.

On July 17, 2024, the DRPA approved an increase in the toll for passenger vehicles from $5.00 to $6.00, which went into effect on September 1, 2024.

== Plans ==
In 2011, the DRPA initiated the process of awarding an engineering contract to plan out the redecking of the bridge, as the concrete deck, its asphalt overlay, and the joints between the concrete have deteriorated after 35 years of service. Upon approval of the contract by the DRPA Board, the study is expected to take 30 months. No cost estimates or time frame for the actual redecking project have been announced.

With related improvements to Interstate 95 through Northeastern Philadelphia county, the Betsy Ross Bridge Interchange Project (Exit 26) was initiated in March 2015 to replace the decking on the ramps on the Pennsylvania side of the bridge and complete the access ramps to Aramingo Avenue.

<text>Oldboy () is a 2003 South Korean action-thriller film directed and co-written by Park Chan-wook. A loose adaptation of the Japanese manga of the same name, the film follows the story of Oh Dae-su (Choi Min-sik), who is imprisoned in a cell resembling a hotel room for 15 years without knowing the identity of his captor or his captor&#x27;s motives. When he is finally released, Dae-su finds himself still trapped in a web of conspiracy and violence as he seeks revenge against his enigmatic captor (Yoo Ji-tae). His quest becomes tied in with romance when he falls in love with a young sushi chef, Mi-do (Kang Hye-jung).

&quot;Oldboy&quot; attained critical acclaim and accolades worldwide, including winning the Grand Prix at the 2004 Cannes Film Festival, where it garnered high praise from Quentin Tarantino, the president of the jury. In the United States, film critic Roger Ebert stated that &quot;Oldboy&quot; is a &quot;powerful film not because of what it depicts, but because of the depths of the human heart which it strips bare&quot;. The film&#x27;s action sequences, particularly the single shot corridor fight sequence, also received commendation for their impressive execution.

The film&#x27;s success led to two adaptations: an unauthorized Hindi remake in 2006 and an official American adaptation in 2013. As part of Park Chan-wook&#x27;s &quot;The Vengeance Trilogy&quot;, it serves as the second installment, following &quot;Sympathy for Mr. Vengeance&quot; (2002) and preceding &quot;Lady Vengeance&quot; (2005).

The film is regarded as one of the greatest films of all time and has been included in numerous &quot;best-of&quot; lists by many publications. In 2008, &quot;Oldboy&quot; was placed 64th on an &quot;Empire&quot; list of the top 500 movies of all time. In 2020, &quot;The Guardian&quot; ranked it number 3 among the classics of modern South Korean Cinema.

==Plot==

In 1988, businessman Oh Dae-su is arrested for drunkenness, causing him to miss his daughter&#x27;s fourth birthday. His friend Joo-hwan collects him, but Dae-su disappears and awakens in a sealed hotel room. Takeout food is delivered through a pet door, and his only diversion is a television; from it, Dae-su learns that he has been framed for his wife&#x27;s murder. As years pass, Dae-su grows deranged from solitude and attempts suicide by wrist-cutting, but is resuscitated. Dae-su then begins practicing martial arts against the wall and attempting to dig an escape tunnel.

In 2003, Dae-su is sedated, hypnotised, and released after 15 years. He awakens on a rooftop, where he saves a suicidal man and recounts his story; once finished, Dae-su allows the man to resume his suicide. Dae-su receives money and a phone from a beggar, and enters a sushi restaurant. Taunted by his captor over the phone, Dae-su orders and consumes a live octopus before collapsing. Taken in by the young sushi chef, Mi-do, Dae-su unsuccessfully attempts to rape her; he regretfully attempts to leave, but they reconcile and bond over their loneliness.

Dae-su searches for his daughter, but gives up after learning she was adopted and emigrated. Focusing on his captors, he eats at Chinese restaurants until he identifies which one prepared his prison meals. Chasing a deliveryman, Dae-su finds a private prison where people pay to have others incarcerated. He tortures and interrogates the warden, Mr. Park, who divulges that Dae-su was imprisoned for &quot;talking too much&quot;. Park&#x27;s guards attack Dae-su, but he fights his way through.

Dae-su reconnects with Joo-hwan, who now works at an internet cafe. Dae-su becomes suspicious of Mi-do and binds her, but his captor calls and sends him to a neighboring apartment. Using the pseudonym &quot;Evergreen&quot;, he gives Dae-su an ultimatum: if he can uncover his motive within five days, Evergreen will remotely deactivate his pacemaker; otherwise, Evergreen will kill Mi-do. Dae-su returns to Mi-do to find Park and his thugs molesting her. Park prepares to torture Dae-su, but stops when Evergreen sends a briefcase of cash; Dae-su threatens to remove Park&#x27;s hand, but Park leaves. Mi-do is upset by the ultimatum, but she and Dae-su grow closer and have sex in a love hotel.

Dae-su wakes to find Park&#x27;s hand wrapped in a box; he investigates his possessions, and has his shoe debugged. Dae-su and Mi-do follow Evergreen&#x27;s pseudonym to Dae-su&#x27;s high-school motto: &quot;Evergreen Old Boys&quot;. Identifying Evergreen as Lee Woo-jin in a yearbook, Dae-su calls Joo-hwan. Joo-hwan recalls a girl in his class, Lee Soo-ah, and crassly describes her sex life and suicide; an eavesdropping Woo-jin angrily stabs Joo-hwan to death. Dae-su seeks out Park, who wants revenge for his hand removal; Park agrees to temporarily imprison Mi-do to keep her safe. Talking to Soo-ah&#x27;s friends, Dae-su recalls witnessing her having sex with Woo-jin. Unaware it was incest, Dae-su told Joo-hwan of her promiscuity, who then spread gossip. Soo-ah developed a false pregnancy, which drove her to suicide.

At Woo-jin&#x27;s penthouse, Dae-su reveals Woo-jin&#x27;s motive. An amused Woo-jin gifts Dae-su a family photo album, the contents revealing that Dae-su&#x27;s daughter grew up into Mi-do. Woo-jin reveals that he used hypnosis to orchestrate their meeting and incestuous relationship, and that he paid Park to imprison Mi-do. Woo-jin threatens to tell Mi-do the truth, and Dae-su desperately grovels; when Woo-jin is unmoved, Dae-su cuts out his tongue as penance. Woo-jin accepts his apology, instructing Park to not tell Mi-do and dropping his pacemaker remote. Dae-su uses it, but it only plays a recording of Dae-su and Mi-do having sex, making him collapse in despair. Woo-jin leaves the penthouse and, recalling his failure to stop his sister&#x27;s suicide, shoots himself in the head.

Sometime later, Dae-su locates the hypnotist and requests she erase his knowledge of Mi-do being his daughter. Touched by a specific line in his letter, she guides Dae-su to envision the part of himself that knows the truth dying. A concerned Mi-do finds Dae-su lying alone in the snow. Mi-do confesses her love for him, and the two embrace; Dae-su smiles, but it becomes a tortured grimace.

== Cast ==

* Choi Min-sik as Oh Dae-su, a businessman who seeks revenge after being held in a mysterious prison for 15 years. Choi Min-sik lost and gained weight for his role depending on the filming schedule, trained for six weeks, and did most of his own stunt work.
** as young Dae-su.
* Yoo Ji-tae as Lee Woo-jin, the man behind Oh Dae-su&#x27;s imprisonment. Park Chan-wook&#x27;s ideal choice for Woo-jin had been actor Han Suk-kyu, who previously played a rival to Choi Min-sik in &quot;Shiri&quot; and &quot;No. 3&quot;. Choi then suggested Yoo Ji-tae for the role, despite Park believing he was too young for the part.
** Yoo Yeon-seok as young Woo-jin.
* Kang Hye-jung as Mi-do, Dae-su&#x27;s love interest.
* as No Joo-hwan, Dae-su&#x27;s friend and the owner of an internet café.
** as young Joo-hwan.
* Kim Byeong-ok as Mr. Han, Woo-jin&#x27;s bodyguard.
* Yoon Jin-seo as Lee Soo-ah, Woo-jin&#x27;s sister.
* Oh Dal-su as Mr. Park Cheol-woong, warden of the private prison.
* Oh Kwang-rok as Suicidal man.

== Production ==

The corridor fight scene took seventeen takes in three days to perfect and was one continuous take; there was no editing of any sort except for the knife stabbed in Oh Dae-su&#x27;s back, which was computer-generated imagery.

The script originally called for full male frontal nudity, but Yoo Ji-tae changed his mind after the scenes had been shot.

Other computer-generated imagery in the film includes the ant coming out of Dae-su&#x27;s arm (according to the making-of feature on the DVD, the whole arm was CGI) and the ants crawling over him afterwards. The octopus being eaten alive was not computer-generated; four were used during the filming of this scene. The eating of squirming octopuses (called &quot;san-nakji&quot; () in Korean) as a delicacy exists in East Asia, although it is usually killed and cut, not eaten whole and alive; the squirming is a result of postmortem nerve activity in the octopus&#x27; tentacles. When asked in DVD commentary if he felt sorry for Choi, director Park Chan-wook stated he felt more sorry for the octopuses.

The final scene&#x27;s snowy landscape was filmed in New Zealand. The ending is deliberately ambiguous, and the audience is left with several questions: specifically, how much time has passed, if Dae-su&#x27;s meeting with the hypnotist really took place, whether he successfully lost the knowledge of Mi-do&#x27;s identity, and whether he will continue his relationship with Mi-do. In an interview with Park (included with the European release of the film), he says that the ambiguous ending was deliberate and intended to generate discussion; it is completely up to each individual viewer to interpret what is not shown.

== Soundtrack ==
Nearly all the music cues that are composed by Shim Hyeon-jeong, Lee Ji-soo and Choi Seung-hyun are titled after films, many of them film noirs.

== Reception and analysis ==
=== Box office ===
In South Korea, the film was seen by 3,260,000 filmgoers and ranks fifth for the highest-grossing film of 2003.

&quot;Oldboy&quot; grossed a total of US$17,052,444 worldwide.

=== 20th anniversary re-release ===
The film was theatrically re-released in the United States by NEON for its 20th anniversary on 16 August 2023, remastered in 4K, featuring bonus commentary by Park Chan-wook.

=== Critical response ===
&quot;Oldboy&quot; received critical acclaim, and is considered an influential cult classic. Praise was also given to the film&#x27;s action sequences, specifically highlighting the &quot;all-timer&quot; single shot hallway fight sequence. As per the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, 83% of critics have given the film a positive review based on 160 reviews, with an average rating of 7.40 out of 10. The site&#x27;s critics consensus reads: &quot;Violent and definitely not for the squeamish, Park Chan-Wook&#x27;s visceral &quot;Oldboy&quot; is a strange, powerful tale of revenge.&quot; On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 78 out of 100, with 82% positive reviews based on 33 critics, indicating &quot;generally favorable reviews&quot;.

Roger Ebert of the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; gave the film four out of four stars and remarked: &quot;We are so accustomed to &#x27;thrillers&#x27; that exist only as machines for creating diversion that it&#x27;s a shock to find a movie in which the action, however violent, makes a statement and has a purpose.&quot; James Berardinelli of &quot;ReelViews&quot; gave the film three out of four stars, saying that it &quot;isn&#x27;t for everyone, but it offers a breath of fresh air to anyone gasping on the fumes of too many traditional Hollywood thrillers.&quot;

Stephanie Zacharek of Salon.com praised the film, calling it &quot;anguished, beautiful, and desperately alive&quot; and &quot;a dazzling work of pop-culture artistry.&quot; Peter Bradshaw gave it 5/5 stars, commenting that this is the first time in which he could actually identify with a small live octopus. Bradshaw summarizes his review by referring to &quot;Oldboy&quot; as &quot;cinema that holds an edge of cold steel to your throat.&quot; David Dylan Thomas points out that rather than simply trying to &quot;gross us out&quot;, &quot;Oldboy&quot; is &quot;much more interested in playing with the conventions of the revenge fantasy and taking us on a very entertaining ride to places that, conceptually, we might not want to go.&quot; Sean Axmaker of the &quot;Seattle Post-Intelligencer&quot; gave &quot;Oldboy&quot; a score of &quot;B−&quot;, calling it &quot;a bloody and brutal revenge film immersed in madness and directed with operatic intensity,&quot; but felt that the questions raised by the film are &quot;lost in the battering assault of lovingly crafted brutality.&quot;

Jamie Russell of the BBC movie review calls it a &quot;sadistic masterpiece that confirms Korea&#x27;s current status as producer of some of the world&#x27;s most exciting cinema.&quot; In 2019 on &quot;The Hankyoreh&quot;, Kim Hyeong-seok said that &quot;Oldboy&quot; was the &#x27;zeitgeist of the vigorous Korean cinema in early 2000s&#x27;, and a &#x27;boiling point that led history of Korean cinema to new state&#x27;. Manohla Dargis of the &quot;New York Times&quot; called the film &quot;a trivial genre movie,&quot; writing, &quot;The fact that &quot;Oldboy&quot; is embraced by some cinephiles is symptomatic of a bankrupt, reductive postmodernism: one that promotes a spurious aesthetic relativism (it&#x27;s all good) and finds its crudest expression in the hermetically sealed world of fan boys.&quot; J.R. Jones of the &quot;Chicago Reader&quot; was also not impressed, saying that &quot;there&#x27;s a lot less here than meets the eye.&quot;

The film is regarded as one of the best films ever made and has been included in numerous &quot;best-of&quot; lists by many publications. In 2008, &quot;Oldboy&quot; was placed 64th on an &quot;Empire&quot; list of the top 500 movies of all time. The same year, voters on CNN named it one of the ten best Asian films ever made. It was ranked #18 in the same magazine&#x27;s &quot;The 100 Best Films of World Cinema&quot; in 2010. In a 2016 BBC poll, critics voted the film the 30th greatest since 2000. In 2020, &quot;The Guardian&quot; ranked it number 3 among the classics of modern South Korean Cinema.

=== &quot;Oedipus the King&quot; inspiration ===
Park Chan-wook stated that he named the main character Oh Dae-su &quot;to remind the viewer of Oedipus.&quot; In one of the film&#x27;s iconic shots, Yoo Ji-tae, who played Woo-jin, strikes an extraordinary yoga pose. Park Chan-wook said he designed this pose to convey &quot;the image of Apollo.&quot; It was Apollo&#x27;s prophecy that revealed Oedipus&#x27; fate in Sophocles&#x27; &quot;Oedipus the King&quot;. The link to Oedipus Rex is only a minor element in most English-language criticism of the movie, while Koreans have made it a central theme. Sung Hee Kim wrote &quot;Family seen through Greek tragedy and Korean movie – Oedipus the King and Old Boy.&quot; Kim Kyungae offers a different analysis, with Dae-su and Woo-jin both representing Oedipus. Besides the theme of unknown incest revealed, Oedipus gouges his eyes out to avoid seeing a world that despises the truth, while Oh Dae-su cuts off his tongue to prevent the truth from being revealed.

More parallels with Greek tragedy include how Lee Woo-jin is portrayed as akin to an immortal Greek god while Oh Dae-su is merely an aged mortal. Lee Woo-jin looks young compared to Oh Dae-su, though they are supposed to be contemporaries at school. Throughout the movie Lee Woo-jin is portrayed as an obscenely rich young man who lives in a lofty tower and is omnipresent due to having listening devices planted on Oh Dae-Su and others, which furthers the parallel between his character and the secrecy of Greek gods.

Mi-do, throughout the movie, comes across as a strong-willed, young and innocent girl, and has been compared to Sophocles&#x27; Antigone, Oedipus&#x27; daughter. Though Antigone does not commit incest with her father, she remains faithful and loyal to him, similar to how Mi-do reunites with Oh Dae-Su and takes care of him in the wilderness (cf. &quot;Oedipus at Colonus&quot;). Another interesting character is the hypnotist, who, apart from being able to hypnotise people, also has the power to make people fall in love (e.g. Dae-Su and Mi-do), which is characteristic of the power of Aphrodite, the goddess of love, whose classic act is to make Paris and Helen fall in love before and during the Trojan War.

=== Park Chan-wook&#x27;s focus on the irrational ===
Park Chan-wook has said there is a deep influence from author Franz Kafka in this movie, and that this provides the absurdity and surrealism. In interviews, Park Chan-wook has also spoken about his movies &quot;portraying something irrational: a phenomenon that cannot be explained logically. A portrait of humanity as neither good nor evil but rather as a complex existence.&quot; This is not only evident in &quot;Oldboy&quot; but also other movies made by Park and Bong Joon-ho. For example, &quot;Parasite&quot;, &quot;Memories of Murder&quot;, &quot;Oldboy&quot;, and &quot;Decision to Leave&quot; do not contain archetypal good characters. There is no moral protagonist for the audience to follow. Korean Studies professor and cultural critic David Tizzard has described this as a quality of Asian cinema: &quot;Gone are the simple ideas of good and evil. Erased are the ideas of a moral protagonist and their immoral antagonist. But because they are not good, or at least defined as such by their creators, they become something much larger, realer, and more complete than the archetypes we are spoon-fed elsewhere.&quot;

== Home media ==
In the United Kingdom, the film was watched by 300,000 television viewers on Channel 4 in 2011. This made it the year&#x27;s most-watched foreign-language film on a non-BBC television channel in the UK.

== Awards and nominations ==


==Remakes==
=== Bollywood controversy ===

&quot;Zinda&quot;, the Bollywood film directed by writer-director Sanjay Gupta, also bears a striking resemblance to &quot;Oldboy&quot; but is not an officially sanctioned remake. It was reported in 2005 that &quot;Zinda&quot; was under investigation for violation of copyright. A spokesman for original distributor Show East said, &quot;If we find out there&#x27;s indeed a strong similarity between the two, it looks like we&#x27;ll have to talk with our lawyers.&quot; Show East had already sold the film&#x27;s rights to DreamWorks in 2004, and initially expressed legal concerns but no legal action was taken as the studio had shut down.

=== American remake ===

Steven Spielberg originally intended to produce a remake starring Will Smith in 2008. He commissioned screenwriter Mark Protosevich to adapt the screenplay. Spielberg pulled out in 2009.

An official remake directed by Spike Lee was released on 27 November 2013. 39 percent of critic reviews on Rotten Tomatoes were positive for the remake.

<text>The Algerian nuthatch or Kabyle nuthatch (Sitta ledanti) is a species of bird in the nuthatch family Sittidae. It is a medium-sized nuthatch, measuring between and . The are bluish-grey. The male can be distinguished from the female by the black front of its . The species is sedentary; it feeds on arthropods in summer and on seeds in winter. The breeding season takes place around May–June. The nest, built in a hole of tree, shelters a laying of three or four eggs, brooded by the female. The chicks are fed by both parents.

The Kabyle nuthatch is the only bird species endemic to Algeria, where it now inhabits only certain coniferous and broadleaf forests in the Kabylia region in the north of the country. Its scientific name pays tribute to Jean-Paul Ledant, a Belgian amateur naturalist who discovered the bird in October 1975 and named it &quot;la Sittelle Kabyle&quot; (&quot;the Kabyle nuthatch&quot;); the description of the bird was made by the French ornithologist Jacques Vielliard. The news of this discovery greatly surprised the ornithological world and received international media coverage. The Algerian nuthatch is closely related to Krüper&#x27;s nuthatch (&quot;Sitta krueperi&quot;). The bird has only a limited and relict range, threatened by fire, erosion and human action; the species is therefore considered &quot;endangered&quot; by the International Union for Conservation of Nature.

== Description ==

The Algerian nuthatch is a medium-sized nuthatch; it measures between and , and weighs about . The are overall bluish grey; the tail has a small subterminal white band bordered with beige. The belly is washed with light salmon-beige up to the undertail coverts; the latter are grey at their base. The male has a black forehead and a dark , separated from the by a broad, sharp white supercilium. In females, the crown and eyestripe are the same grey as the back, with the front of the crown sometimes darker (when the plumage is worn), but not as dark as in males. In both sexes, the sides of the head and the throat are white. The iris are brown-black, the legs lead-grey and the bluish-grey. The juvenile plumage is similar to that of the female, but duller and with an inconspicuous supercilium; after leaving the nest, bill growth and pigmentation of the bill and legs are incomplete.

Within its range, the Kabyle nuthatch cannot be confused with any other bird. The closest nuthatch geographically is the Eurasian nuthatch (&quot;Sitta europaea&quot;) which inhabits Europe widely and some localities in the Moroccan Rif mountains; this species is larger than the Algerian, has no black on the crown and has orange-buff (or white for some subspecies) tending to orange around the rump. The Kabyle nuthatch strongly resembles the Corsican nuthatch (&quot;Sitta whiteheadi&quot;), but the black crown differs in the males; that of the Algerian species covers the front of the head, as opposed to the whole head in the Corsican nuthatch. The underparts are of a warmer pinkish buff in the Algerian species. It is phylogenetically very close to Krüper&#x27;s nuthatch (&quot;Sitta krueperi&quot;), with the front of the crown dark in the male and the supercilium marked white, but Krüper&#x27;s nuthatch has pale grey underparts and a large russet-brown pectoral patch.

== Taxonomy and systematics ==
===Discovery and nomenclature===
The Algerian nuthatch was discovered in Algeria by Jean-Paul Ledant, a Belgian naturalist and ornithologist, on 5 October 1975. Identifying it as quite different from other nuthatches, he wrote to the Academy of Sciences to report his discovery. Working on a revision of Sittidae, they encouraged Ledant to return to the site. He tried several times during the winter, but the mountain was too snowy to allow exploration. Ledant was finally accompanied by Jacques Vielliard in mid-April 1976 to observe nesting, which actually occurred later in the year due to the massif range&#x27;s difficult climatic conditions. They had to wait until July to observe feeding behaviour and a few fledglings, as well as to make recordings and call trials with songs of Corsican and Krüper nuthatches. Only a dozen pairs were observed, but on the 5–6 July, Vielliard killed a pair of adults that had finished feeding their chicks to be used as type specimens. Kept in the describer&#x27;s house, these specimens (the holotype and paratype) were seriously damaged after 2005 by insects, and were finally given to the National Museum of Natural History, France in 2015.

The Algerian nuthatch was formally described in the journal &quot;Alauda&quot; by Jacques Vielliard in 1976 under its current name of &quot;Sitta ledanti&quot;. This discovery greatly surprised the ornithological world, as the bird seemed to come from a &quot;lost world&quot; that has withstood the test of time, the Babor Mountains. A species of bird endemic to the Mediterranean had not been discovered for nearly a century since the 1883 discovery of the Corsican nuthatch.

In December 1976, the Swiss ornithologist Eric Burnier announced in the journal &quot;Nos Oiseaux&quot; that he had discovered the species independently on June 20 of the same year, before learning from a July 28 article in &quot;Le Monde&quot; that he had been preceded in his discovery and that the species had just been named. He published a few drawings and field notes, explaining that he had spotted birds that he had judged to have the characteristics of the Corsican nuthatch and Krüper&#x27;s nuthatch by song and then approached them only a few meters away. The only nuthatch in the Maghreb then known being the Eurasian nuthatch, which occurs in some localities of the Moroccan Rif and Atlas Mountains about 900 km from the Babor Mountains, he knew he was dealing with a new species.

=== Phylogeny ===

The Algerian nuthatch is placed in the subgenus &quot;Micrositta&quot;, described by the Russian ornithologist Sergei Buturlin in 1916, and has no subspecies. American ornithologist Charles Vaurie had grouped in 1957 the Corsican nuthatch, the red-breasted nuthatch (&quot;Sitta canadensis&quot;) and the Chinese nuthatch (&quot;Sitta villosa&quot;), which he considered to be very similar, in the &quot;Sitta canadensis&quot; group. In his 1976 description of the Algerian nuthatch, Vielliard devotes a portion of his paper to the possible relationships of the different species and their evolutionary history. He suggests that Vaurie stopped at a &quot;superficial morphological similarity&quot; to bring the Corsican nuthatch closer to the red-breasted nuthatch, and that the Corsican species should rather form with Krüper&#x27;s nuthatch a group known as the &quot;Mesogean nuthatches&quot;, &quot;where &quot;Sitta ledanti&quot; providentially fits in&quot;. He considers it &quot;tempting&quot; to identify the fossil species &quot;Sitta senogalliensis&quot; (whose membership to the genus &quot;Sitta&quot; is discussed) described from the Upper Miocene in Italy as the ancestor of the Mesogean nuthatch group.

In 1998, Eric Pasquet studied the cytochrome b gene in the mitochondrial DNA of about ten nuthatch species, including the various species of the &quot;Sitta canadensis&quot; group, which he defined as comprising six species, corresponding to those reported in the subgenus, &quot;Micrositta&quot;: &quot;S. canadensis&quot;, &quot;S. villosa&quot;, &quot;S. whiteheadi&quot;, &quot;S. yunnanensis&quot;, &quot;S. krueperi&quot; and &quot;S. ledanti&quot;. Pasquet concluded that the Corsican nuthatch is phylogenetically related to the Chinese nuthatch and the red-breasted nuthatch, these three species forming the sister group of a clade including Krüper&#x27;s nuthatch and the Algerian nuthatch. The first three species would even be close enough to constitute subspecies, rejecting the &quot;Mesogean&quot; theory of Vielliard and thus confirming the conclusions of Charles Vaurie. For the sake of taxonomic stability, however, all retain their full species status. In 2014, Eric Pasquet and colleagues published a phylogeny based on nuclear and mitochondrial DNA of 21 nuthatch species and confirmed the relationships of the 1998 study within the &quot;&quot;Sitta canadensis&quot; group&quot;, adding the Yunnan nuthatch, which was found to be the most basal of the species.

The conclusions of these studies are in agreement with the morphology of the species, the red-breasted nuthatch, Corsican nuthatch and Chinese nuthatch sharing as a derived character the entirely black crown only present in males, a unique trait among the nuthatches and related families. The second clade, which includes Krüper&#x27;s and Algerian nuthatches, have the front of the crown black in males, with this sexually dimorphic trait absent in juveniles.

The simplified cladogram below is based on the phylogenetic analysis of Packert and colleagues (2014):

===Biogeography===
In 1976, the Swiss ornithologist Paul Géroudet suggested that the Mesogean nuthatches once inhabited a fairly continuous belt of conifers around the Mediterranean, which had become fragmented, leaving only a few hard-to-reach refuges where these different species were able to evolve in isolation. In 1998, his phylogeny having been established, Pasquet concluded that the paleogeographic history of the group would be as follows: the divergence between the two main clades of the &quot;&quot;Sitta canadensis&quot; group&quot; appeared more than 5 million years ago, at the end of the Miocene, when the &quot;S. krueperi&quot; and &quot;S. ledanti&quot; clade settled in the Mediterranean basin at the time of the Messinian salinity crisis; the two species making up the clade diverged 1.75 million years ago. The other clade split into three, with populations leaving Asia from the east and giving rise to the North American red-breasted nuthatch, and then, about a million years ago, from the west, marking the separation between the Corsican and Chinese nuthatches.

== Ecology and behaviour ==
===Vocalisations===

The call is a &quot;tsiit tsiit&quot; typical of a nuthatch. Adults also use a whispered call when an intruder is present, possibly for territorial defense. The song of the Algerian nuthatch is a nasal whistle, composed of a series of rising elements, with a short final note, repeated slowly and can be transcribed into a &quot;vuuy-di vuuy-di vuuy-di&quot;. It is a repetition of seven to twelve phrases lasting for two to four seconds. The bird may also produce a rapid trill in &quot;di-du-di-du-di-du&quot;, and when agitated, it emit a harsh and repeated &quot;chèèh&quot; comparable to the call of a jay.

===Food===
The Algerian nuthatch&#x27;s diet has not been extensively studied. It varies according to the season. In summer, it feeds mainly on insects (mainly caterpillars and beetles) and spiders that it finds by surveying the trunks and branches of oak trees. In winter, insects are scarce and the Algerian nuthatch feeds on coniferous seeds which provide a constant supply. They generally feed alone, but may form mixed feeding flocks outside the breeding season.

===Breeding===
The breeding season occurs from May to June in Tamentout and Mount Babor, earlier or later depending on weather conditions and food availability; at higher altitudes it may start later. In Taza National Park, the breeding season ends in late June. The nest is built in a tree hole, perhaps excavated by a great spotted woodpecker (&quot;Dendrocopos major&quot;), in a dead fir tree or in holes in an oak or cedar tree, and is usually placed between from the ground. The bottom is lined with plant debris (wood chips, dead leaves) or animal material such as western barn owl (&quot;Tyto alba&quot;) feathers or wild boar (&quot;Sus scrofa&quot;) hair. While incubation is carried out by the female alone (the male does not have a brood patch), both parents feed the young. Clutches have three or four fledgings. After the breeding season, adults undergo a full post-nuptial moult and young undergo a partial post-nuptial moult.

== Distribution and habitat ==
The Algerian nuthatch is the only bird endemic to Algeria. It inhabits certain areas of Kabylia, where it has been recorded in five localities isolated from each other by deforested areas unsuitable for its survival. It was first discovered on Mount Babor, only about from the Mediterranean coast. Its optimal habitat covers only , and the area is home to only 80 pairs according to a 1985 estimate. Then in June 1989 it was found in Guerrouch, within the Taza National Park, which has a larger population of around 350 individuals. Smaller numbers were discovered in 1990 in two other localities near this park, in Tamentout and Djimla. In the spring of 2018, a new breeding site was discovered in Ghabet Ezzen, between the communes of Chahna and Oudjana in the Jijel province. On 24 September of the same year, two amateur ornithologists, Karim Haddad and Larbi Afoutni, went to the site; about twenty individuals were observed and photographed in the Lerabaa forest. The bird could be present in other oak groves of Petite Kabylie, but has not been documented yet.

The Algerian nuthatch lives in oak forests between and altitude and in mixed forests of oak, Italian maple (&quot;Acer opalus&quot; subsp. &quot;obtusatum&quot;), and mixed coniferous forests up to the summit of Jebel Babor. It appreciates humid forests with large trees offering cavities, including Algerian fir (&quot;Abies numidica&quot;), Atlas cedar (&quot;Cedrus atlantica&quot;), aspen (&quot;Populus tremula&quot;), Afares oak (&quot;Quercus afares&quot;), cork oak (&quot;Quercus suber&quot;) and Portuguese oak (&quot;Quercus faginea&quot;). The Babor Mountains, dominated by fir and cedar forest, offer a cool and humid climate, with snow up to 4 metres deep in winter and persisting until May; in the Guerrouch, oaks are dominant and the climate is warmer and drier. At lower altitudes, such as Tamentout, forests are dominated by cork oak, and stand densities are lower than at higher altitudes (above ), where this species is replaced by deciduous oaks such as Algerian oak (&quot;Quercus canariensis&quot;) and Afares oak. A study conducted in Mount Babor between the summers of 1981 and 1982 showed that the factors apparently favourable to the Algerian nuthatch in this massif were &quot;the diversity of tree species, the size (or age) of the trees and indirectly the climate at altitude&quot;.

== Status and threats ==
===Numbers and status===
When the Algerian nuthatch was discovered, ornithologists estimated that the species numbered only a dozen pairs and it was feared that &quot;its rarity would attract collectors&quot; and that the announcement of its discovery would cause its disappearance. The discovery in 1989 of the much larger population of the park of Taza shows that the species is less threatened than it seemed, and that its endemism is not limited to Babor Mountains. The current distribution of the Algerian nuthatch seems to be limited by that of the forests that support it, and the fragmentation of populations may indicate that the species was once more widespread, before deforestation isolated it in the small islands of greenery that it populates today. The Algerian nuthatch has a small population: its numbers may not exceed 1,000 individuals. The bird is placed in the category of species with 250–999 mature individuals, which corresponds to 350–1,500 individuals in all. Although there are no precise figures to confirm this, these numbers are considered to be declining due to the reduction in habitat that the species is experiencing. The Algerian nuthatch has been considered &quot;endangered&quot; by the International Union for Conservation of Nature since 1994.

===Threats===
The main threat to the Algerian nuthatch is the destruction of its habitat. Fires, in particular, are destroying the old mixed forests on the top of Mount Babor, which are being replaced by poorer vegetation dominated by cedars. Cattle grazing and illegal deforestation (Mount Babor and Tamentout) are another threat to the habitat, even in Taza National Park. The construction of a motor road in the 1970s, which led to soil erosion and an increased risk of fire, or the fight against terrorism in the region, which is a source of disturbance for the species. The Algerian nuthatch may have several predators during incubation, such as the weasel (&quot;Mustela nivalis&quot;), the garden dormouse (&quot;Eliomys quercinus&quot;) and the great spotted woodpecker.

===Protection===
The species is protected in Algeria as one of 32 species listed in Decree No. 83-509 of 20 August 1983 on protected non-domestic animal species. The nuthatch was included in a 1980 petition by the BirdLife International requesting that the U.S. federal government add 60 foreign species to the federal endangered lists. This request was published in the official gazette of the United States. The petition was published in the &quot;Federal Register&quot; the following year, but these species, including the Algerian nuthatch, were not added to the endangered species lists until 1995.

The largest population is found in a protected area, the Taza National Park. To safeguard the species, it is important about the size of the existing populations and their ecological preferences. However, protective measures have already been put forward, including habitat restoration or preservation through reforestation, planting of firewood outside of existing forests, and fire prevention. The Algerian nuthatch is a flagship species for the preservation of the Babor Mountains forest.

<text>Sainte-Catherine () is an off-island suburb of Montreal, in southwestern Quebec, Canada, on the St. Lawrence River in the Regional County Municipality of Roussillon. The population as of the Canada 2011 Census was 16,762.

== History ==
The land had been occupied for more than three centuries, since the establishment of the Iroquois mission in 1676, it is only in 1937 that the founding of la paroisse de Sainte-Catherine de Laprairie really marks a territorial organization. In 1973, a demographic boom finally granted the status of town to the village. In 2006, according to the city&#x27;s official site, there were 17,000 inhabitants in Sainte-Catherine.

The inauguration of the Honoré Mercier Bridge in 1934, and then of the Champlain Bridge in 1962, greatly boosted the local economy.

== Demographics ==
In the 2021 Census of Population conducted by Statistics Canada, Sainte-Catherine had a population of living in of its total private dwellings, a change of from its 2016 population of . With a land area of , it had a population density of in 2021.

<text>L&#x27;Ancienne-Lorette () is a city in central Quebec, Canada. It is a suburb of and an enclave within Quebec City. It was merged with Quebec City on January 1, 2002, as part of a 2000–2006 municipal reorganization in Quebec, but, after a 2004 referendum, it was reconstituted as a separate city on January 1, 2006.

Its history dates to 1674, when a group of Huron (Wyandot) fleeing war with the Iroquois settled there under the protection of the French. It was founded as a mission village by the Jesuits. The Wyandot left after a few decades, and French settlers took over the land.

==History==
The Jesuit missionary Pierre Chaumonot in 1674 founded a settlement here when he built a chapel for the Huron (Wyandot). Following his third and final trip to the shrine of Loreto in Italy, Chaumonot was cured of a terrible headache. In gratitude, he placed the colony under the patronage of Our Lady of the Annunciation, but it is still commonly called Lorette.

In 1697, the Huron left the village in search of better land for hunting and fishing. Afterward the site became known in French as &quot;Vieille-Lorette&quot; (&quot;Old Loreto&quot;) or&quot; Ancienne-Lorette&quot; (&quot;Former Loreto&quot;). A new location became known as Nouvelle-Lorette (&quot;New Loreto&quot;) or Jeune-Lorette (&quot;Young Loreto&quot;). That site roughly corresponds to the Loretteville of today. A year later in 1698, the Parish of Notre-Dame-de-l&#x27;Annonciation was established.

In 1948, the place was incorporated as the village municipality of Notre-Dame-de-Lorette. In 1967, it gained town status and took back its original name, L&#x27;Ancienne-Lorette, to distinguish itself from the Notre-Dame-de-Lorette Lac-Saint-Jean region.

Until 1971, L&#x27;Ancienne-Lorette was the gateway to Quebec&#x27;s International Airport. It used to be known as L&#x27;Ancienne-Lorette Airport. In 1971 the rural section of the town that included the airport was annexed by Sainte-Foy.

On January 1, 2002, L&#x27;Ancienne-Lorette was merged with Quebec City as part of a province-wide municipal reorganization and became part of the Laurentien borough of that city. After a 2004 referendum, it regained independent city status on January 1, 2006.

<doc id="734249" wikidata="Q315484" url="?curid=734249" title="Park Chan-wook">
<text>Park Chan-wook (; ; born 23 August 1963) is a South Korean film director, screenwriter, producer, and former film critic. He is considered one of the most prominent filmmakers of South Korean cinema as well as 21st-century world cinema. His films, which often blend crime, mystery and thriller with other genres, have gained notoriety for their cinematography, framing, black humor and often brutal subject matters.

After two unsuccessful films in the 1990s which he has since largely disowned, Park came to prominence with his acclaimed third directorial effort, &quot;Joint Security Area&quot; (2000), which became the highest-grossing film in South Korean history at the time and which Park himself prefers to be regarded as his directorial debut. Using his newfound creative freedom, he would go on to direct the films forming his unofficial &quot;The Vengeance Trilogy&quot;: &quot;Sympathy for Mr. Vengeance&quot; (2002), a financial failure that polarized critics, followed by &quot;Oldboy&quot; (2003) and &quot;Lady Vengeance&quot; (2005), both of which received critical acclaim and were financially successful. &quot;Oldboy&quot; in particular is regarded as one of the greatest films ever made, and helped establish Park as a well-known director outside his native country.

Most of Park&#x27;s works following &quot;The Vengeance Trilogy&quot; were also commercial and critical successes both in South Korea and internationally, such as &quot;Thirst&quot; (2009), &quot;The Handmaiden&quot; (2016), which earned Park the BAFTA Award for Best Film Not in the English Language, and &quot;Decision to Leave&quot; (2022), which won the Best Director award at the 2022 Cannes Film Festival. He directed the English-language miniseries &quot;The Little Drummer Girl&quot; (2018) and &quot;The Sympathizer&quot; (2024).

==Early life==
Park was born 23 August 1963 in Seoul. Both his parents were native Seoul residents of five generations. His father, Park Don-seo, was a professor of architecture and former dean of Ajou University&#x27;s College of Engineering. His grandfather, Park Seung-seo, was the former president of the Korean Bar Association.

Park studied philosophy at Sogang University, where he joined the photography club and film club. Originally intending to be an art critic, Park, upon seeing &quot;Vertigo&quot;, resolved to become a filmmaker. After graduation, he wrote articles on film for journals and soon became an assistant director of films like &quot;Kkamdong&quot;, directed by Yu Yeong-jin, and &quot;Watercolor Painting in a Rainy Day&quot;, directed by Kwak Jae-yong (&quot;My Sassy Girl&quot;).

==Career==
Park&#x27;s debut feature film was &quot;The Moon Is... the Sun&#x27;s Dream&quot; (1992). After five years, he made his second film, &quot;Trio&quot;. Park&#x27;s early films were not successful at the box office, and he pursued a career as a film critic to make a living. In an interview in 2017, he said &quot;Many people think my directorial debut film is JSA, but I want to keep it that way&quot;.

In 2000, Park directed &quot;Joint Security Area&quot;, which was a great success both commercially and critically, even surpassing Kang Je-gyu&#x27;s &quot;Shiri&quot; as the then most-watched film ever made in South Korea. This success made it possible for Park to make his next film more independently. &quot;Sympathy for Mr. Vengeance&quot; is the result of this creative freedom.

Park&#x27;s unofficially-titled &quot;Vengeance Trilogy&quot; consists of &quot;Sympathy for Mr. Vengeance&quot; (2002), &quot;Oldboy&quot; (2003) and &quot;Lady Vengeance&quot; (2005). It was not originally intended to be a trilogy. Park won the Grand Prix at the 2004 Cannes Film Festival for &quot;Oldboy&quot;. The films concern the utter futility of vengeance and how it wreaks havoc on the lives of those involved. &quot;Lady Vengeance&quot; was distributed by Tartan Films for the United States theatrical release in April 2006.

American director Quentin Tarantino is an avowed fan of Park. As the head judge at the 2004 Cannes Film Festival, he personally pushed for Park&#x27;s &quot;Oldboy&quot; to be awarded the (the honour eventually went to Michael Moore&#x27;s &quot;Fahrenheit 9/11&quot;). &quot;Oldboy&quot; garnered the Grand Prix, Cannes&#x27;s second-highest honour. Tarantino also regards Park&#x27;s &quot;Joint Security Area&quot; to be one of &quot;the top twenty films made since 1992.&quot;

Since 2004, Park has been an owner of the filmmaking company Moho Film, which participated in the production of &quot;Snowpiercer&quot; (2013) and &quot;The Handmaiden&quot; (2016).

In 2006, Park was the member of official section jury at the 63rd Venice International Film Festival.

In February 2007, Park won the Alfred Bauer Prize at the 57th Berlin International Film Festival. The award, named after the festival&#x27;s founder and in praise of works that introduce new perspectives, went to Park for his film, &quot;I&#x27;m a Cyborg, But That&#x27;s OK&quot;.

In 2009, Park directed the vampire film &quot;Thirst&quot;, starring Song Kang-ho, which won the Prix du Jury (alongside &quot;Fish Tank,&quot; directed by Andrea Arnold) at the 2009 Cannes Film Festival. He considered directing &quot;Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy&quot; but ultimately turned it down.

In 2011, Park said his new fantasy-horror film &quot;Paranmanjang (Night Fishing)&quot; was shot entirely on the iPhone. The film was co-directed with Park&#x27;s younger brother, Park Chan-kyong, who had no prior directing experience. It was nominated for Berlinale Shorts during the 2011 Berlin Film Festival and won the Golden Bear for Best Short Film.

In 2013, Park directed his first English-language film, &quot;Stoker&quot;. He said he learned to accelerate the production process and completed filming in 480 hours. Although Park does speak English, he used an interpreter on set. On why the script attracted his attention, Park said: &quot;It wasn&#x27;t a script that tried to explain everything and left many things as questions, so it leads the audience to find answers for themselves, and that&#x27;s what I liked about the script... I like telling big stories through small, artificially created worlds&quot;. On 2 March 2013, Park appeared on a panel discussion about the film &quot;Stoker&quot; held at the Freer Gallery of Art in the Smithsonian&#x27;s Museums of Asian Art.

In 2014, Park directed a short film commissioned by luxury brand Ermenegildo Zegna, co-written by himself, Ayako Fujitani, Chung Chung-hoon and Michael Werwie, scored by Clint Mansell, and starring Jack Huston and Daniel Wu. It screened at the Rome International Film Festival and the Busan International Film Festival.
In September 2014, it was announced that Park would adapt &quot;Fingersmith&quot;, a historical crime novel by Sarah Waters. The film entered production in mid-2015 and ended on 31 October 2015. That film ended up becoming &quot;The Handmaiden&quot; and premiered in competition to rave reviews at the 2016 Cannes Film Festival, where Artistic Director Seong-hie Ryu won the Vulcain Prize for the Technical Arts, and the film was nominated for both the Palme d&#x27; Or and Queer Palm. At the 2016 Buil Film Awards, &quot;The Handmaiden&quot; won for Best New Actress (Tae-ri Kim), The Buil Readers&#x27; Jury Award and Best Art Direction (Seong-hie Ryu). The film holds a 95% rating on Rotten Tomatoes, and saw box office success in several countries, including South Korea, the United States and the United Kingdom.

In October 2014, it was announced that Park had signed on to direct the sci-fi body-swap film, &quot;Second Born&quot;.

In January 2018, it was stated that Park would direct a TV miniseries adaptation of &quot;The Little Drummer Girl&quot;, a novel by John le Carré. It aired on BBC One in October of that year and stars Michael Shannon, Florence Pugh and Alexander Skarsgård.

At the 24th Busan International Film Festival, Park said that he is writing scripts for feature films, for theater and for TV, including a new installment in the &quot;Vengeance Trilogy&quot;, and an adaption of Donald E. Westlake&#x27;s novel &quot;The Ax&quot;. Park had first discussed adapting the book in 2009, when he received approval from Costa-Gavras who owned the rights and directed a previous rendition of the novel.

In May 2020, it was announced that he was working on his next film&#x27;s screenplay, tentatively titled &quot;Heeojil gyeolsim&quot; (&quot;The Decision to Break Up&quot;). It is described as a melodrama and will star Tang Wei and Park Hae-il. In October 2020, the title of the film was revealed as &quot;Decision to Leave&quot;, with the story described as a murder mystery romance. The film was set to begin shooting later that month. In April 2021, A24 optioned Viet Thanh Nguyen&#x27;s 2015 novel &quot;The Sympathizer&quot; for a TV adaptation, with Park directing. He was awarded Best Director at the 2022 Cannes Film Festival for his work on &quot;Decision to Leave&quot;.

In August 2024, Park began filming his adaption of &quot;The Ax&quot;, titled No Other Choice (). Park wrote the screenplay with previous collaborators Lee Kyoung-mi, Don McKellar &amp; Lee Ja-hye. The film would also see Park reunite with actors Lee Byung-hun and Cha Seung-won.

== Filmmaking ==
Park Chan-wook&#x27;s films have gained notoriety for their cinematography and framing, black humor and often brutal subject matter.

In a May 2004 interview with &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot;, Park listed Sophocles, Shakespeare, Kafka, Dostoevsky, Balzac and Kurt Vonnegut as influences on his career.

His list of 61 favorite films for LaCinetek includes multiple entries of works by Luchino Visconti, Abel Ferrara, Michelangelo Antonioni, Mikio Naruse and Alfred Hitchcock. He has named Taxi Driver by Martin Scorsese as one of his favorite films, a &quot;monument of film history&quot;.

Park has a history of successful collaborations with various talented individuals in the film industry. Among these collaborations, the longest-standing partnership is with Editor Kim Sang-bum. Their relationship dates back to when Park, then a college student, joined the directing department led by editor-in-chief Kim Sang-bum. It is worth noting that Editor Kim Sang-bum&#x27;s late father, Editor Kim Hee-soo, was involved in Park Chan-wook&#x27;s debut film, &quot;The Moon Is... the Sun&#x27;s Dream&quot; as editor. Since the film &quot;Joint Security Area&quot; (1998), Editor Kim Sang-bum has edited all of Park Chan-wook&#x27;s works, except for &quot;Stoker&quot; (2013), up until &quot;The Handmaiden.&quot; For his editing work in Park&#x27;s latest film &quot;Decision to Leave,&quot; Kim Sang-bum won José Salcedo Award for Best Editing in Valladolid International Film Festival.

Park has also collaborated with music director Jo Yeong-wook since &quot;Joint Security Area&quot; (1998). The two have since worked on several other projects together, including &quot;Oldboy&quot;, &quot;Sympathy For Lady Vengeance&quot;, &quot;The Handmaiden&quot;, and &quot;Decision to Leave&quot;.

Park has also worked closely with art director Ryu Seong-hie, who was filming &quot;Memories of Murder&quot; when Park asked her to work on &quot;Oldboy&quot;. She has since worked with Park on &quot;I&#x27;m a Cyborg, But That&#x27;s OK&quot;, &quot;Thirst&quot;, &quot;The Handmaiden&quot;, and &quot;Decision to Leave&quot;.

Another notable collaborator of Park&#x27;s is cinematographer Chung Chung-hoon. The pair first met during the production of &quot;Old Boy&quot;. The two have since worked on several other projects together, including &quot;Sympathy For Lady Vengeance&quot;, &quot;I&#x27;m a Cyborg, But That&#x27;s OK&quot;, &quot;Thirst&quot;, and &quot;The Handmaiden&quot;. Chung is known for his exceptional use of lighting and camera work, and his visual style has been a strong match for Park&#x27;s atmospheric and visually stunning films.

He has frequently collaborated with screenwriter Jeong Seo-kyeong on several projects, such as &quot;Sympathy For Lady Vengeance&quot;, &quot;I&#x27;m a Cyborg, But That&#x27;s OK&quot;, &quot;Thirst&quot;, &quot;The Handmaiden&quot;, and &quot;Decision to Leave&quot;.

Park has a talent for attracting top-tier acting talents. Some of Korea&#x27;s most well-known stars, such as Choi Min-sik and Song Kang-ho, have been integral parts of his casting selection. Song Kang-ho, in particular, has appeared in six of Park&#x27;s feature length films. Park Hae-il and Shin Ha-kyun have also worked with Park on multiple occasions, three and four, respectively. Their collaborations have been highly regarded by audiences and critics alike.

==Personal life==
Park was raised in a devout Catholic family in Korea, and describes himself as an atheist. He was raised in an environment that fostered culture and intellectual pursuits. His father, Park Don-seo, served as a professor of architecture and former dean of Ajou University&#x27;s College of Engineering, while his grandfather, Park Seung-seo, held the esteemed position of former president of the Korean Bar Association. Additionally, Park&#x27;s younger brother, Park Chan-kyong, is active as a multimedia artist.

Park was introduced to his future wife, Kim Eun-hee, by a mutual friend when she was a student at Ewha Womans University. At the 15th Marrakech International Film Festival, Park paid tribute to his wife Kim Eun-hee for her support throughout his career. Park&#x27;s daughter, Park Seo-woo, studied at the Korea National University of Arts, and worked as a member of the art team for &quot;The Handmaiden&quot;.

He voiced support for the Democratic Labor Party and was also a member of its successor, the New Progressive Party. He supported Justice Party candidate Sim Sang-jung in the 2017 South Korean presidential election.

<text>La Plaine () is an off-island suburb of Montreal, and a former city in southwestern Quebec, Canada. It lies north of Montreal and Laval. Since June 27th, 2001 It is now part of the city of Terrebonne in the Les Moulins Regional County Municipality. It is part of the administrative division of Lanaudière.

== History ==

Although the seigneury of Des Plaines already existed in 1731, it had nothing to do with the town of La Plaine that we know today. It would take until 1840 for it to slowly appear, notably with the creation of the rang de La Plaine sud (now chemin Forest), located on the current territory of the La Plaine sector.

When Calixte Gauthier decided to set up his general store at the crossroads of the Grande Ligne and Rang de La Plaine in 1863, he was certainly far from suspecting that he was setting the stage for the inauguration of the future village of La Plaine.

In 1903, the constant growth of a hamlet far from Sainte-Anne-des-Plaines and Terrebonne led the Canadian Pacific to build a station at La Plaine. As the number of residents of the small hamlet of La Plaine grew, they proposed in 1912 to establish a new parish that could be made up of the rows far from the churches of Saint-Lin, Mascouche and Sainte-Anne-des-Plaines. However, far from being to everyone&#x27;s liking, the idea would be debated for three long years.

It was the Bishop of Joliette who proclaimed the founding of the Saint-Joachim mission, made up of the distant rows of Saint-Lin and Saint-Henri-de-Mascouche. As for the territory belonging to Sainte-Anne-des-Plaines, it was the diocese of Montreal that administered it and there was no question of it ceding part of its territory. However, five years later, the Bishop of Montreal finally authorized the annexation of the distant part of Sainte-Anne-des-Plaines to the Saint-Joachim mission. He then founded the religious parish of Saint-Joachim-de-La Plaine.

The municipality of the Parish of Saint-Joachim was founded in 1922. Then, the municipality changed its name in 1969 to become the municipality of La Plaine. La Plaine became part of the Greater Montreal Area in 1986 and in 1995 La Plaine got city status in 1996 the La Plaine library was opened and they established their industrial park. On June 27, 2001 La Plaine Lachenaie and Terrebonne merged to make the new city of Terrebonne.
== Districts ==
Before the merger with the city of Terrebonne (prior to June 27th, 2001) La Plaine had 6 districts each with a municipal councillor and each acted as the spokesperson for the population.
== Population ==
At the time of the merger in 2001, the population of La Plaine was 15,673. La Plaine experienced a massive population boom and in 1992 the population growth was 76.4% being second in Canada at the time in 1996 it was 36.3% ranking fifth in Quebec. estimates of the population of La Plaine according to area vibes is 22,492 while Centris estimates 24,241 in 2016. The population is somewhere above 20,000 people today. most people today live in the Domaine-du-Boisé neighborhood
==Geography==
The terrain of La Plaine is flat, after all its in the name. La Plaine translated to english means &quot;The Plain&quot;. Most of La Plaine is farmland with some of it forested (Extreme north, between the farmland and the more &quot;urban side&quot;)
==Climate==
La Plaine has a warm summer humid continental climate (Köppen climate classification &quot;Dfb&quot;) with warm humid summers and cold winters temperature as high as 35°C (95°F) and as low as -30°C (-23°F) do happen once or maybe twice every few years but it has dropped to -30°C (-22°F) up to six times in 2015 and up to 35°C (95°F) twice in 2020. The lowest temperature ever recorded was -44°C (-47°F) on January 15th, 1957 and the highest temperature recorded was 37°C (99°F) on August 1st, 1975

== Recreation ==
The Forum de La Plaine is a 2,000-seat multi-purpose arena.
== Education ==
The Commission scolaire des Affluents operates the following French public schools in this area:
* École primaire de l&#x27;Orée-des-Bois
* École primaire du Boisé
* École primaire Saint-Joachim
* École primaire du geai-bleu
* École secondaire de l&#x27;Odyssée

Sir Wilfrid Laurier School Board operates Anglophone public schools:

<doc id="734256" wikidata="Q174858" url="?curid=734256" title="Molecular modelling">
<text>Molecular modelling encompasses all methods, theoretical and computational, used to model or mimic the behaviour of molecules. The methods are used in the fields of computational chemistry, drug design, computational biology and materials science to study molecular systems ranging from small chemical systems to large biological molecules and material assemblies. The simplest calculations can be performed by hand, but inevitably computers are required to perform molecular modelling of any reasonably sized system. The common feature of molecular modelling methods is the atomistic level description of the molecular systems. This may include treating atoms as the smallest individual unit (a molecular mechanics approach), or explicitly modelling protons and neutrons with its quarks, anti-quarks and gluons and electrons with its photons (a quantum chemistry approach).

==Molecular mechanics==

Molecular mechanics is one aspect of molecular modelling, as it involves the use of classical mechanics (Newtonian mechanics) to describe the physical basis behind the models. Molecular models typically describe atoms (nucleus and electrons collectively) as point charges with an associated mass. The interactions between neighbouring atoms are described by spring-like interactions (representing chemical bonds) and Van der Waals forces. The Lennard-Jones potential is commonly used to describe the latter. The electrostatic interactions are computed based on Coulomb&#x27;s law. Atoms are assigned coordinates in Cartesian space or in internal coordinates, and can also be assigned velocities in dynamical simulations. The atomic velocities are related to the temperature of the system, a macroscopic quantity. The collective mathematical expression is termed a potential function and is related to the system internal energy (U), a thermodynamic quantity equal to the sum of potential and kinetic energies. Methods which minimize the potential energy are termed energy minimization methods (e.g., steepest descent and conjugate gradient), while methods that model the behaviour of the system with propagation of time are termed molecular dynamics.

: formula_1

: formula_2

This function, referred to as a potential function, computes the molecular potential energy as a sum of energy terms that describe the deviation of bond lengths, bond angles and torsion angles away from equilibrium values, plus terms for non-bonded pairs of atoms describing van der Waals and electrostatic interactions. The set of parameters consisting of equilibrium bond lengths, bond angles, partial charge values, force constants and van der Waals parameters are collectively termed a force field. Different implementations of molecular mechanics use different mathematical expressions and different parameters for the potential function. The common force fields in use today have been developed by using chemical theory, experimental reference data, and high level quantum calculations. The method, termed energy minimization, is used to find positions of zero gradient for all atoms, in other words, a local energy minimum. Lower energy states are more stable and are commonly investigated because of their role in chemical and biological processes. A molecular dynamics simulation, on the other hand, computes the behaviour of a system as a function of time. It involves solving Newton&#x27;s laws of motion, principally the second law, formula_3. Integration of Newton&#x27;s laws of motion, using different integration algorithms, leads to atomic trajectories in space and time. The force on an atom is defined as the negative gradient of the potential energy function. The energy minimization method is useful to obtain a static picture for comparing between states of similar systems, while molecular dynamics provides information about the dynamic processes with the intrinsic inclusion of temperature effects.

==Variables==
Molecules can be modelled either in vacuum, or in the presence of a solvent such as water. Simulations of systems in vacuum are referred to as &quot;gas-phase&quot; simulations, while those that include the presence of solvent molecules are referred to as &quot;explicit solvent&quot; simulations. In another type of simulation, the effect of solvent is estimated using an empirical mathematical expression; these are termed &quot;implicit solvation&quot; simulations.

===Coordinate representations===
Most force fields are distance-dependent, making the most convenient expression for these Cartesian coordinates. Yet the comparatively rigid nature of bonds which occur between specific atoms, and in essence, defines what is meant by the designation &quot;molecule&quot;, make an internal coordinate system the most logical representation. In some fields the IC representation (bond length, angle between bonds, and twist angle of the bond as shown in the figure) is termed the Z-matrix or torsion angle representation. Unfortunately, continuous motions in Cartesian space often require discontinuous angular branches in internal coordinates, making it relatively hard to work with force fields in the internal coordinate representation, and conversely a simple displacement of an atom in Cartesian space may not be a straight line trajectory due to the prohibitions of the interconnected bonds. Thus, it is very common for computational optimizing programs to flip back and forth between representations during their iterations. This can dominate the calculation time of the potential itself and in long chain molecules introduce cumulative numerical inaccuracy. While all conversion algorithms produce mathematically identical results, they differ in speed and numerical accuracy. Currently, the fastest and most accurate torsion to Cartesian conversion is the Natural Extension Reference Frame (NERF) method.

== Applications ==
Molecular modelling methods are used routinely to investigate the structure, dynamics, surface properties, and thermodynamics of inorganic, biological, and polymeric systems. A large number of molecular models of force field are today readily available in databases. The types of biological activity that have been investigated using molecular modelling include protein folding, enzyme catalysis, protein stability, conformational changes associated with biomolecular function, and molecular recognition of proteins, DNA, and membrane complexes.

<doc id="734263" wikidata="Q2740124" url="?curid=734263" title="Commodore Barry Bridge">
<text>The Commodore Barry Bridge (also known as the Commodore John Barry Bridge or John Barry Bridge) is a cantilever bridge that spans the Delaware River from Chester, Pennsylvania to Bridgeport, New Jersey, in Logan Township. It is named after John Barry, an American Revolutionary War hero and Philadelphia resident.

Along with the Betsy Ross Bridge, the Ben Franklin Bridge and the Walt Whitman Bridge, the Commodore Barry Bridge is one of the four toll bridges connecting the metropolitan Philadelphia region with southern New Jersey owned by the Delaware River Port Authority. Originally designed to connect with a now-cancelled freeway, the limited-access bridge has recently been retrofitted to better serve the local area. Between 2007 and 2011, both the Delaware River Port Authority and the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation, in conjunction with the Chester Redevelopment Authority, built a pair of entrance-exit ramps that allowed motorists, primarily heavy truck traffic, to access the Chester Waterfront, via PA 291 and Flower Street (via West 9th Street (US 13)) from I-95. Other improvements, such as deck joint replacement, concrete patching (on the approaches), and other safety and engineering improvements are either ongoing or have been completed.

The bridge replaced the Chester–Bridgeport Ferry, a ferry service that from July 1, 1930 to February 1, 1974, was the sole means of crossing the Delaware River from Delaware County, Pennsylvania to Gloucester County, New Jersey. The Chester side of the ferry service experienced the Wade Dump fire and SuperFund cleanup, and has since become the city-owned Barry Bridge Park with the adjacent Subaru Park (home of the Major League Soccer&#x27;s Philadelphia Union franchise) being opened in 2010.

==History==
Construction of the bridge began on April 14, 1969, and it opened to traffic on February 1, 1974. It has a total length of , and a main span of , making the bridge the fourth longest cantilever bridge in the world, and the longest in the United States. The road has a total of five lanes, divided by a zipper barrier, which was added to the bridge in 2002, in which a machine can configure the number of lanes in each direction, depending upon traffic volume or construction. The bridge is designated as part of US 322 and has direct connections with PA 291 (West 2nd Street), US 13 (West 9th Street) and I-95 in Chester and US 130 in Bridgeport, with a connection to I-295 and the New Jersey Turnpike within a radius of the bridge.

Originally created to be a connection to one of the then-proposed freeways in New Jersey, the Commodore Barry Bridge was to connect I-95 near Chester to, at one point, the Atlantic City Expressway near Hammonton, but those plans were eventually scrapped when it was realized that many people in the college town of Glassboro would be affected. There are new talks of possibly upgrading US 322 to a freeway from US 130 to I-295&#x27;s current Exit 11, or even as far as the New Jersey Turnpike&#x27;s Exit 2. There is no mention if this new freeway would be included in the Interstate Highway System, though it hasn&#x27;t been ruled out yet, either.

On February 2, 1978, an intense fire broke out at Wade Dump, a rubber recycling facility and illegal industrial chemical dumping site almost directly under the bridge. The heat, rising flames and noxious fumes shut down the bridge temporarily. The burning chemicals injured 43 firemen and caused long-term health problems for the first responders to the fire. In 1981, the location was declared a Superfund cleanup site and remediation occurred throughout the 1980s. In 1989, the site was deemed safe and removed from the Superfund national priorities list. In 2004 the site was converted to a parking lot for the nearby Barry Bridge Park.

==Tolls==

A $6.00 one-way toll is charged entering Pennsylvania for passenger vehicles less than or equal to gross vehicle weight and SUVs. A $18 credit will be given on a per tag basis for any New Jersey-issued E-ZPass tag that crosses one of the four DRPA bridges 18 times in a calendar month. Trucks, commercial vehicles, mobile homes and recreation vehicles (weighing at least gross vehicle weight), pay $9.00 cash per axle. Seniors aged 65 and over with an NJ E-ZPass can use a discount program to pay $3.00 per trip.

On July 17, 2024, the Delaware River Port Authority approved an increase in the toll for passenger vehicles from $5.00 to $6.00, which went into effect on September 1, 2024.

<text>Kriya Yoga (Sanskrit: क्रिया योग) is a yoga system which consists of a number of levels of pranayama, mantra, and mudra, intended to rapidly accelerate spiritual development and engender a profound state of tranquility and God-communion. It is described by its practitioners as an ancient yoga system revived in modern times by Lahiri Mahasaya, who claimed to be initiated by a guru, Mahavatar Babaji, circa 1861 in the Himalayas. Kriya Yoga was brought to international awareness by Paramahansa Yogananda&#x27;s book &quot;Autobiography of a Yogi&quot; and through Yogananda&#x27;s introductions of the practice to the West from 1920.

==Etymology==
According to Yogananda, &quot;Kriya is an ancient science. Lahiri Mahasaya received it from his great guru, Babaji, who rediscovered and clarified the technique after it had been lost in the Dark Ages. Babaji renamed it, simply, Kriya Yoga.&quot; In his commentary on the Bhagavad Gita, Yogananda further explains that
Jaerschky elucidates that &quot;kabali&quot; (Bengali) is synonymous with &quot;kaivalya&quot; (kevali, kevala), &quot;isolation,&quot; the isolation of &quot;purusha&quot; (consciousness, spirit) from &quot;prakriti&quot; (nature or matter, including the human mind and emotions), or the unification with God. According to Jaerschky, &quot;kevali-pranayama&quot; leads to &quot;kevala kumbhaka&quot;, &quot;the natural state of breathlessness, which is the goal of all deep yogis.&quot;

===Yoga===
The Sanskrit noun &#x27; is derived from the root &#x27; () &quot;to attach, join, harness, yoke&quot; (&quot;yoga&quot; is a cognate of the English word &quot;yoke&quot;). According to Timothy Miller, the term &quot;yoga&quot; may designate various spiritual practices in Hindu traditions, translating it as &quot;union&quot; or &quot;discipline&quot;. In the context of the &quot;Yoga Sutras&quot;, to which reference is often made to explain the name &quot;Kriya Yoga&quot;, the root &quot;yuj samādhau&quot; (to concentrate) is considered the correct etymology by traditional commentators.

===Kriya===
A &quot;kriya&quot; may refer to any kind of practice in the context of yoga, and teachers of psychophysical practices often use the term. Philip Goldberg writes that, as a brand, &quot;Kriya Yoga&quot; generally refers to the lineage that Yogananda represented. He also cites the following definition found in Yogananda&#x27;s autobiography. According to Yogananda, 

According to Jones and Ryan, &quot;kriya Yoga&quot; may be literally translated as &quot;yoga of ritual action,&quot; noting that it &quot;is contrasted with jnana (learning) yoga and equated with karma (action) yoga in the Trishikhi-Brahmana Upanishad.&quot; 

The &quot;Yoga Sutras of Patanjali&quot; 2.1 defines three types of , namely &quot;tapas&quot; (&quot;heat,&quot; ascetic practices), &quot;svadhyaya&quot; (study or recitation of the Vedas, or “contemplation, meditation, reflection of one&#x27;s self”), and (devotion or surrender to God). In the Kriya Yoga school, &#x27;ritual action&#x27; involves breathing techniques (&quot;pranayama&quot;) revolving the life energy (&quot;prana&quot;) &quot;upward and downward, around the six spinal centers&quot; and upwards to the crown-chakra.

===Kriya yoga as inner fire ritual===
Tanya Lynne Brittain further explains that while &quot;Kriya yoga is &#x27;usually understood to mean &#x27;yoga as practice&#x27; or “practical yoga,&#x27; [...][it is] also associated with the vocabulary of initiation and sacrifice.&quot; The kriya yoga pranayama practices are a form of kundalini-practice, which culminate in &quot;kriya&quot;, the &quot;inner fire rite,&quot; the internalized Vedic fire sacrifice. Yael Bentor further explains that in the Upanishads this internalized fire ritual is associated with the maintenance of life, through breathing and eating. Where the Brahmin maintains the world order by his sacrifices, for the yogi the breath becomes a perpetual ritual. The internalization of the fire is also associated with &quot;tapas&quot;, &quot;heat,&quot; burning away the defilements, and with &quot;pranayama&quot;, the control of the breath. These concepts were combined in the yoga of the subtle body.

Yogananda writes:

==History==
The origins of the present-day forms of Kriya Yoga can be traced back to Lahiri Mahasaya, who said he received initiation into the yoga techniques from an immortal Himalayan yogi called Mahavatar Babaji. The story of Lahiri Mahasaya receiving initiation into Kriya Yoga by Mahavatar Babaji in 1861 is recounted in &quot;Autobiography of a Yogi&quot;. Yogananda wrote that at that meeting, Mahavatar Babaji told Lahiri Mahasaya, &quot;The Kriya Yoga that I am giving to the world through you in this nineteenth century, is a revival of the same science that Krishna gave millenniums ago to Arjuna; and was later known to Patanjali, and Christ, and to St. John, St. Paul, and other disciples.&quot; Yogananda also wrote in &quot;God Talks With Arjuna: The Bhagavad Gita&quot; that the science of Kriya Yoga was given to Manu, the original Adam, and through him to Janaka and other royal sages.

Through Lahiri Mahasaya, Kriya Yoga soon spread throughout India. Lahiri Mahasaya&#x27;s disciples included his two sons (Dukouri Lahiri and Tinkouri Lahiri), Sri Yukteswar Giri, Panchanan Bhattacharya, Swami Pranabananda, Swami Kebalananda, Keshavananda Brahmachari, Bhupendranath Sanyal (Sanyal Mahasaya), and many others.

Kriya Yoga was brought to international awareness by Paramahansa Yogananda, a disciple of Swami Sri Yukteswar Giri, with his book &quot;Autobiography of a Yogi&quot; and through Yogananda&#x27;s introductions of the practice to the West from 1920.

==Practice==

Kriya Yoga, as taught by Lahiri Mahasaya, is traditionally learned exclusively via the Guru-disciple relationship, and the initiation consists of a secret ceremony. He recounted that after his initiation into Kriya Yoga, &quot;Babaji instructed me in the ancient rigid rules which govern the transmission of the yogic art from Guru to disciple.&quot; Yogananda&#x27;s &quot;Autobiography of a Yogi&quot; mentions the practice of Kriya Yoga, but it doesn&#x27;t provide details about how to practice specific techniques. Rizwan Virk writes that &quot;The purpose of the book was to inspire readers to take up the yogic path by opening their minds to spiritual possibilities.&quot;

In Yogananda&#x27;s 6 October 1920 speech at the International Congress of Religious Liberals in Boston, he said that the Kriya Yoga of his lineage &quot;consists of magnetizing the spinal column and the brain, which contain the seven main centers, with the result that the distributed life electricity is drawn back to the original centers&quot;, thus liberating the &quot;spiritual Self&quot; from physical and mental distractions. Yogananda used the word &quot;centers&quot; in place of the term &quot;chakras&quot;. Philip Goldberg writes that Yogananda described Kriya Yoga in essentially the same way in &quot;Autobiography of a Yogi&quot;. Yogananda wrote:

The practice of Kriya Yoga involves specific breathing patterns. Yogananda claims that the process of performing Kriya Yoga leads to a certain purification of the blood which frees up the life force to withdraw into the spine:

Satyananda Giri writes that &quot;Kriya sadhana may be thought of as the sadhana of the &#x27;practice of being in Atman&#x27;.

There are many higher kriyas in the kriya yoga tradition. According to the &quot;Autobiography of a Yogi&quot;, Lahiri Mahasaya divided Kriya Yoga into four parts. The second, third and the fourth Kriya are known as higher Kriyas, Thokar Kriya being one of them.

==Sources and inspirations==
According to Yogananda, the elusive Mahavatar Babaji introduced the concept of &quot;Kriya Yoga pranayama&quot; as essentially identical to the Raja Yoga of Patanjali and the concept of Yoga as described in the &quot;Bhagavad Gita&quot;. 
According to Yogananda, Kriya Yoga was well known in ancient India, but was eventually lost, due to &quot;priestly secrecy and man’s indifference&quot;.

A direct disciple of Sri Yukteswar Giri, Sailendra Dasgupta (d. 1984) has written that, &quot;Kriya entails several acts that have evidently been adapted from the Gita, the Yoga Sutras, Tantra shastras and from conceptions on the Yugas.&quot;

===Bhagavad Gita===
The Bhagavad Gita does not teach &quot;Kriya Yoga pranayama&quot; by name, but Yogananda claimed that the fundamental idea of the practice – control over the mind and the body&#x27;s energy (&quot;prana&quot;) – is expressed therein. In his commentary on the Gita, &quot;God Talks with Arjuna&quot;, Yogananda asserts that Krishna reveals the &quot;safe path&quot; of Kriya Yoga to the disciple Arjuna in the Gita. Specifically, Yogananda claims that verses IV:29 and V:27–28 about breath control and meditation describe the essential concepts of Kriya Yoga. According to Yogananda&#x27;s commentary, Krishna describes Kriya Yoga thusly:
Yogananda also stated that Krishna was referring to &quot;Kriya Yoga pranayama&quot; when &quot;Krishna ... relates that it was he, in a former incarnation, who communicated the indestructible yoga to an ancient illuminato, Vivasvat, who gave it to Manu, the great legislator. He, in turn, instructed Ikshwaku, the father of India’s solar warrior dynasty.&quot;

===Yoga Sutras of Patanjali===
According to Yogananda, &quot;Kriya Yoga is mentioned twice by the ancient sage Patanjali, foremost exponent of yoga, who wrote: &#x27;Kriya Yoga consists of
body discipline, mental control, and meditating on Aum.&#x27;—Yoga Sutras II:1.&quot;

The &quot;Yoga Sutras of Patanjali&quot; 2.1 actually uses the term &quot;kriya yoga&quot; when describing a &quot;yoga of action (kriyayoga),&quot; defining three types of kriya (action):
According to George Feuerstein, this &quot;kriya yoga&quot; is contained in chapter 1, chapter 2 verse 1-27, chapter 3 except verse 54, and chapter 4. The &quot;eight limb yoga&quot; is described in chapter 2 verse 28–55, and chapter 3 verse 3 and 54.

According to Barbara Miller, &quot;Kriya yoga&quot; as described in the Yoga Sutras is the &quot;active performance of yoga.&quot; It is part of the niyamas, &quot;observances&quot;, the second limb of Patanjali&#x27;s eight limbs.

Yogananda stated that Patanjali wrote a second time about the &quot;Kriya Yoga pranayama&quot; technique when he wrote: &quot;Liberation can be attained by that pranayama which is accomplished by disjoining the course of inspiration and expiration&quot; (YS 2.49).

== Guru–shishya parampara of Kriya Yoga ==
The lineage of Self-Realization Fellowship (SRF)/Yogoda Satsanga Society of India (YSS), founded by Paramahansa Yogananda includes Bhagavan Krishna, Jesus Christ, Mahavatar Babaji, Lahiri Mahasaya, Sri Yukteswar Giri and Paramahansa Yogananda. According to SRF, Yogananda stated, before his passing, that it was &quot;God&#x27;s wish that he be the last in the SRF line of Gurus.&quot; Yogananda said that his writings, especially those compiled in SRF&#x27;s home-study course (the &quot;SRF Lessons&quot;), would facilitate the spiritual instruction of disciples after his death. When questioned about the succession of SRF/YSS leadership, Yogananda answered, “There will always be at the head of this organization men and women of realization. They are already known to God and the Gurus. They shall serve as my spiritual successor and representative in all spiritual and organizational matters.”

According to the Kriya Yoga Institute, their lineage includes Mahavatar Babaji, Lahiri Mahasaya, Sri Yukteswar Giri, Shrimat Bhupendranath Sanyal Mahashaya, Paramahansa Yogananda, Satyananda Giri, and Hariharananda Giri. Hariharananda Giri was a disciple of Sri Yukteswar Giri and managed one of Yogananda&#x27;s &quot;ashrams&quot; in India until 1959. He began visiting the United States in 1975 and established the Kriya Yoga Institute in Homestead, Florida.

<doc id="734277" wikidata="Q705406" url="?curid=734277" title="Art Bears">
<text>Art Bears were an English avant-rock group formed during the disassembly of Henry Cow in 1978 by three of its members, Chris Cutler (percussion, texts), Fred Frith (guitar, bass guitar, violin, keyboards) and Dagmar Krause (vocals; previously of Slapp Happy). The group released three studio albums between 1978 and 1981, and toured Europe in 1979.

In 2008 Cutler, Frith and others formed Art Bears Songbook, an Art Bears &quot;review&quot; project that performed at the Festival International de Musique Actuelle de Victoriaville in Quebec, Canada.

== Biography ==
Art Bears were formed during the recording of Henry Cow&#x27;s fifth album in January 1978. Disagreements had arisen over the album&#x27;s content: Frith, Cutler and Krause favoured song-oriented material, while the rest of the band preferred instrumental compositions. As a compromise, Frith, Cutler and Krause agreed to release the songs already recorded on their own album, &quot;Hopes and Fears&quot;, under the name Art Bears, with the rest of Henry Cow credited as guests. The instrumental material appeared later on the final Henry Cow album, &quot;Western Culture&quot; (1979).

&quot;Hopes and Fears&quot; (1978) thus consisted of Henry Cow songs with the addition of new Art Bears material recorded later by Frith, Cutler and Krause. Towards the end of 1978, Art Bears returned to the studio to record their first &quot;true&quot; album, &quot;Winter Songs&quot; (1979). It comprised fourteen short songs composed by Frith around texts by Cutler inspired by carvings on the stylobate of Amiens Cathedral.

In December 1978, Art Bears joined Rock in Opposition (RIO), and toured Europe in April and May 1979. For the tour, they were joined by Peter Blegvad (ex-Slapp Happy, guitar, bass guitar, voice) and Marc Hollander (of Aksak Maboul, keyboards, clarinet). They rehearsed at the Cold Storage Recording Studios in Brixton, before leaving for Italy in late April. They performed in Italy, France, Belgium and Czechoslovakia, including an RIO festival on 1 May in Milan. Some of the songs recorded during the tour were later added to the CD release of &quot;Hopes and Fears&quot; and &quot;The Art Box&quot; (2004), a box set of Art Bears material.

The band returned to the studio in 1980 to make one final album, &quot;The World as It Is Today&quot; (1981), before splitting up. In October 1983 Frith, Cutler and Krause reunited again when they joined Duck and Cover, a commission from the Berlin Jazz Festival, for a performance of the &quot;Berlin Programme&quot; in West Berlin, followed by another in February 1984 in East Berlin, and one at the ICA in London the following August. The &quot;Berlin Programme&quot; included fragments of three Art Bears songs.

In 1993 Frith, Cutler and Krause worked together again on a song project, &quot;Domestic Stories&quot; (1993) by Chris Cutler and Lutz Glandien, with saxophonist Alfred Harth. While similar to Art Bears, the addition of Glandien&#x27;s electronic music made &quot;Domestic Stories&quot; a distinctly different album.

===Art Bears Songbook===
An Art Bears &quot;review&quot; took place in May 2008 at the world premiere of the Art Bears Songbook at the 25th Festival International de Musique Actuelle de Victoriaville in Quebec. It was performed by Cutler (drums), Frith (guitar, bass guitar, violin, piano), Jewlia Eisenberg (voice), Carla Kihlstedt (violin, voice), Zeena Parkins (keyboards, accordion), Kristin Slipp (voice) and The Norman Conquest (sound manipulation). Krause was unable to participate, so Frith and Cutler decided to rework the trio&#x27;s repertoire for an expanded group, with the voices of Eisenberg, Slipp and Kihlstedt replacing Krause&#x27;s &quot;eccentric and idiomatic delivery&quot;. The project was so-named because Frith and Cutler did not want it to be seen as an Art Bears reunion. According to &quot;All About Jazz&quot; the Art Bears Songbook was &quot;not just a highlight, but the highlight of the [five-day] festival.&quot;

Another performance of the Art Bears Songbook took place at the third edition of the French Rock in Opposition event in Carmaux in September 2010. The line-up was the same as before, except that Krause, who had agreed to come out of retirement, replaced Eisenberg, who was ill.

== Music ==
Art Bears&#x27;s music was often deeply political in content (reflecting the band&#x27;s socialist leanings) and frequently avant-garde and experimental. They were more &quot;song oriented&quot; than Henry Cow, although much of the material on their debut album was actually written with the intention of being performed by the latter band.

Their music was &quot;very dark in concept and in atmosphere&quot;. Reviewing &quot;The Art Box&quot;, BBC Music described it as: &quot;Carefully wrought dissonances, angular folk tunes, sudden shifts in dynamics, dense layers of spectral drones, slabs of noise, topped off with Dagmar&#x27;s strange, elastic Sprechstimme.&quot;

Krause&#x27;s voice contributed significantly to the mood and character of the songs. Cutler said:
I don&#x27;t write simple or obvious words, [...] they are not easy to sing. Dagmar had the amazing ability to make them make sense, to make them sound obvious. She sings from the inside and her accent helps to lift words out of their slots and give them a slightly resonant displacement. No one else could have done what Dagmar did on those LPs. I&#x27;m still amazed by her.

In &quot;progressive&quot; circles, the Art Bears were generally well received. AllMusic wrote: &quot;Their life was fleeting, but the Art Bears wrote and recorded bold, challenging, idiosyncratic music that, despite its occasional difficulty, is ultimately very rewarding.&quot;

==Name==
Art Bears took their name from a sentence in Jane Ellen Harrison&#x27;s book &quot;Ancient Art and Ritual&quot; (1913): &quot;Even to-day, when individualism is rampant, art bears traces of its collective, social origin&quot;. Chris Cutler explains that it was a deliberate out-of-context quote, but that &quot;not too much should be read into this; it just sounds intriguing, has an animal in it, plays with ambiguity and is mildly ridiculous&quot;.

<text>Russell &quot;Rusty&quot; Collins, formerly known as Firefist, is a superhero appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics.

Firefist was portrayed in the 2018 film &quot;Deadpool 2&quot; by Julian Dennison and Sala Baker.

==Publication history==
Created by Bob Layton and Jackson Guice, Rusty Collins first appeared in &quot;X-Factor&quot; #1 (Feb. 1986).

==Fictional character biography==
Rusty Collins was born in Tulsa, Oklahoma. Raised by his uncle, Rusty joins the US Navy at sixteen years of age. His mutant power, generation of fire, manifests itself violently, burning a woman. Rusty is arrested, but when a prison guard playfully threatens him with deadly harm, he bursts into flames again and escapes.

X-Factor is alerted and comes to Rusty&#x27;s aid, helping him to control his powers. He comes to live with X-Factor, who are slowly gathering a small team of mutant wards. Rusty forms a relationship with Skids, a former Morlock.

For a time, they all live upon Ship, a sentient being in the form of a long, rectangular spacecraft that towered over all other Manhattan skyscrapers. Rusty and the X-Terminators help X-Factor when an old booby-trap activates, threatening Ship&#x27;s brain with a gigantic bomb. Ultimately, the bomb explodes harmlessly far above Manhattan.

===&quot;Inferno&quot;===
During the 1989 &quot;Inferno&quot; storyline, Skids and the other wards, taking the name X-Terminators, the name their mentors used when traveling in their mutant guises, teamed up with the New Mutants to help rescue mutant babies from N&#x27;astirh, who was using them to help keep open a portal to Limbo. Rusty himself had gone back into custody at the Navy but willingly goes with the group when he realizes his younger friends, Leech and Artie Maddicks have been captured by demonic forces. At the conclusion of Inferno, with Artie, Leech and the even younger kidnapped children involved rescued from the demons, Rusty joins the New Mutants, along with Skids, Rictor and Boom Boom.

Rusty and Skids help out when long time New Mutants member Danielle Moonstar loses control of her mystical powers. During the incident they are separated from the rest of the group. Mystique&#x27;s Freedom Force attacks them at Liberty Island. Part of this conflict involves the ultimate fate of the children Rusty helped rescue; he believes that Freedom Force had wrongfully taken them into custody.

Due to a fight with Nitro and Vulture, Rusty is brought back into the sights of Freedom Force. While attempting to escape, he was severely injured by the Blob. While recovering in the hospital, he and Skids were contacted by members of the Mutant Liberation Front. With soldiers opening fire on them, they felt there was no other choice than to join them.

===Brainwashed===
Shortly after, Rusty and Skids were brainwashed by Stryfe into being two of his soldiers. During this, Rusty is part of an MLF strike team sent to a museum to steal an ancient artifact. Cable, the man who took over the New Mutants soon after Rusty left, is there. Cable slays MLF member Sumo. He attempts to kill the rest of the group but only gets two of them in the arm, Rusty included.

Due to the brainwashing, Rusty had no qualms about attacking former teammate Cannonball during the X-Cutioner&#x27;s Song storyline. At the end of this story, the Mutant Liberation Front are turned over to the authorities.

Shortly after, Rusty and Skids were kidnapped by the Friends of Humanity. While being transported, X-Force (the team created by the former members of the New Mutants), rescued them. Arriving back to their base, X-Force was soon confronted by Exodus. He was inviting original New Mutants Cannonball and Sunspot to Avalon, a &quot;safe haven&quot; for selected mutants. Cannonball refused to go unless all former New Mutants present (Boom Boom, Rictor, Rusty and Skids) were invited also. While Exodus complained that Rusty and Skids were &quot;damaged&quot; due to their brainwashing, he finally acquiesced.

Upon arriving at Avalon, the mutants were taken to &quot;the Savior&quot; (in reality Magneto), who used his powers to undo the brainwashing done to Rusty and Skids. When X-Force arrived to save their friends, Rusty and Skids decided they would stay with Magneto, feeling that they owed him. With this being done, they joined the Acolytes.

When a mutant body belonging to Holocaust, a &quot;survivor&quot; from the Age of Apocalypse, was discovered floating in space near Avalon, it was brought on board. While on guard duty watching over the thought-to-be frozen body, Rusty&#x27;s life force was drained by Holocaust, killing him.

===Return===
Rusty is resurrected by means of the Transmode Virus to serve as part of Selene&#x27;s army of deceased mutants. Under the control of Selene and Eli Bard, he takes part in the assault on the mutant nation of Utopia.

Rusty was resurrected via the resurrection protocols on Krakoa.

Rusty joined X-Factor but was killed in their first outing.

==Powers and abilities==
Rusty Collins is a mutant with the psionic ability of pyrokinesis. He can control and manipulate fire, as well as turn some or all of his body into flames. He is immune to the effects fire would otherwise normally have on his body.

==In other media==
* A young Rusty Collins appears in the &quot;X-Men: The Animated Series&quot; episode &quot;No Mutant is an Island&quot;, voiced by Amos Crawley. This version is an orphan living in Nebraska who has difficulty controlling his pyrokinetic powers until a telepathic mutant named Killgrave offers to help. After adopting him, Killgrave attempts to use Rusty, among other mutants, to become Nebraska&#x27;s governor. However, he is foiled by Cyclops, who frees Rusty and the others from Killgrave&#x27;s hypnotic brainwashing.
* Russell Collins / Firefist appears in &quot;Deadpool 2&quot;, portrayed by Julian Dennison as a teenager and Sala Baker as an adult. This version is an overweight 14-year-old New Zealander who was tortured at the &quot;Essex School&quot; along with other mutant children. After killing his primary tormentor, the school&#x27;s headmaster, he became fascinated with killing and went on to murder Cable&#x27;s family in a post-apocalyptic future. When Cable travels back in time to kill a young Russell and avert his family&#x27;s deaths, Deadpool is charged with protecting the boy and ensuring he does not become a killer.

<text>The Financial Information eXchange (FIX) protocol is an electronic communications protocol initiated in 1992 for international real-time exchange of information related to securities transactions and markets. With trillions of dollars traded annually on the NASDAQ alone, financial service entities are employing direct market access (DMA) to increase their speed to financial markets. Managing the delivery of trading applications and keeping latency low increasingly requires an understanding of the FIX protocol.

== History ==
The FIX protocol specification was originally authored in 1992 by Robert &quot;Bob&quot; Lamoureux and Chris Morstatt to enable electronic communication of equity trading data between Fidelity Investments and Salomon Brothers. FIX initially addressed information between broker-dealers and their institutional clients. At the time, this information was communicated verbally over the telephone. Fidelity realized that information from their broker-dealers could be routed to the wrong trader, or simply lost when the parties hung up their phones. It wanted such communications to be replaced with machine-readable data which could then be shared among traders, analyzed, acted on and stored. For example, broker-dealers call with an indication of interest (IOI) to buy or sell a block of stock. The FIX initiative created new messages such as the IOI.

According to the FIX Trading Community, FIX has become the de facto messaging standard for pre-trade and trade communication in the global equity markets, and is expanding into the post-trade space to support straight-through processing, as well as continuing to expand into foreign exchange, fixed income and derivatives markets.

===FIX Trading Community===
The FIX Trading Community is a non-profit, industry-driven standards body with a mission to address the business and regulatory issues impacting multi-asset trading across the global financial markets through the increased use of standards, including the FIX Protocol messaging language, delivering operational efficiency, increased transparency, and reduced costs and risk for all market participants.

==Users==
FIX is widely used by both the buy side (institutions) as well as the sell side (brokers/dealers) of the financial markets. Among its users are mutual funds, investment banks, brokers, stock exchanges and ECNs.

FIX has become the standard electronic protocol for pre-trade communications and trade execution. Although it is mainly used for equity transactions in the front office area, bond derivatives and FX-transactions are also possible. One could say that whereas SWIFT is the standard for back office messaging, FIX is the standard for front office messaging. However, today, the membership of FIX Protocol Ltd. is extending FIX into block trade allocation and other phases of the trading process, in every market, for virtually every asset class.

==Technical specifications==
Originally, the FIX standard was monolithic, including application layer semantics, message encoding, and session layer in a single technical specification. It remained monolithic through FIX version 4.2. Thereafter, message encodings and session layer specifications began to be split into separate documents, and ultimately, FIX evolved into a family of related technical standards.

===Message encodings===
Message encoding, called Presentation Layer in the Open Systems Interconnection model (OSI model), is responsible for the wire format of messages.

====Tagvalue encoding (classic FIX)====
The original FIX message encoding is known as tagvalue encoding. Each field consists of a unique numeric tag and a value. The tag identifies the field semantically. Therefore, messages are self-describing. Tagvalue encoding is character-based, using ASCII codes.

=====FIX tagvalue message format=====
A message is composed of a header, a body, and a trailer. The message fields are separated by the start of heading (SOH) character (ASCII 0x01).

Up to FIX.4.4, the header contains three fields: 8 (codice_1), 9 (codice_2), and 35 (codice_3).

From FIXT.1.1 / FIX.5.0, the header contains five or six fields: 8 (codice_1), 9 (codice_2), 35 (codice_3), 49 (codice_7), 56 (codice_8) and the optional 1128 (codice_9).

The content of the message body is defined by the message type (35 codice_3) in the header.

The trailer contains the last field of the message, 10 (codice_11), always expressed as a three-digit number (e.g. codice_12).

Example of a FIX message, Execution Report (codice_13), with the pipe character (codice_14) representing the SOH character:

: codice_15

=====Body=====
FIX messages are formed from several fields; each field has a tag value pairing that is separated from the next field by a delimiter SOH (0x01). The tag is an integer that indicates the meaning of the field. The value is an array of bytes that hold a specific meaning for the particular tag (e.g. tag 48 is SecurityID, a string that identifies the security; tag 22 is IDSource, an integer that indicates the identifier class being used). The values may be in plain text or encoded as pure binary (in which case the value is preceded by a length field). The FIX protocol defines meanings for most tags, but leaves a range of tags reserved for private use between consenting parties.

The FIX protocol also defines sets of fields that make a particular message; within the set of fields, some will be mandatory and others optional. The ordering of fields within the message is generally unimportant, however repeating groups are preceded by a count and encrypted fields are preceded by their length. The message is broken into three distinct sections: the head, body and tail. Fields must remain within the correct section and within each section, the position may be important as fields can act as delimiters that stop one message from running into the next. The final field in any FIX message is tag 10 (checksum).

There are two main groups of messages—admin and application. The admin messages handle the basics of a FIX session. They allow for a session to be started and terminated and for recovery of missed messages. The application messages deal with the sending and receiving of trade-related information such as an order request or information on the current state and subsequent execution of that order.

=====Body length=====
The body length is the character count starting at tag 35 (included) all the way to tag 10 (excluded), including trailing SOH delimiters.&lt;br&gt;
The example below (displayed with SOH delimiters as &#x27;|&#x27;) has a body length of 65:&lt;br&gt;

=====Checksum=====
The checksum of a FIX message is always the last field in the message, with tag codice_16 and a 3 character value. It is given by summing the ASCII value of all characters in the message (except for the checksum field itself), then modulo 256. For example, in the message above, the summation of all ASCII values (including the SOH characters with ASCII value 1) results in 4158. Performing the modulo operation gives the value 62. Since the checksum is composed of three characters, this results in codice_17.

==== FIXML ====
FIXML is an XML schema for FIX messages. It is semantically equivalent to tagvalue encoded messages but takes advantage of XML parser technology. FIXML is commonly used for back-office and clearing applications rather than trading.

==== Simple Binary Encoding (SBE) ====
Simple Binary Encoding defines a wire format using primitive data types that are native to computing systems. Message encoding and decoding is therefore much lower latency than character-based protocols since no translation is needed to put data into a format that computers can use. Aside from latency advantages, performance is more deterministic because SBE messages are constrained by templates and fixed-length data elements are preferred. Another consequence is that fields are generally at a fixed position so that message filters and routers do not need to crack an entire message to access key fields.

SBE was developed by the FIX High Performance Working Group to support high performance trading. Tagvalue encoding was deemed no longer fit-for-purpose since it is character based rather than binary and its variable-length fields and messages result in non-deterministic performance.

Unlike tagvalue and FIXML, an SBE message is not self-describing. Only data is sent on the wire with a minimal header to identify the template that controls a message. Metadata that describes a message layout is exchanged out-of-band between peers.

FIX Trading Community publishes an XML schema for SBE message schemas. A message schema may contain any number of message templates. A template describes the fields that constitute a message. Additionally, a schema provides a listing of simple and composite data types that may be reused by any number of fields.

From a practical perspective, assuming a C/C++ implementation, and adjusting for endianness: most non-composite types in the message directly map to the same type in the language. For example, 32-bit integer maps to codice_18, fixed strings maps codice_19, floating point maps to codice_20 and so on. One can generate a C/C++ codice_21 from the schema definition. Then, given a pointer to a message buffer, accessing non-composite fields of the message amount to type-casting it to a pointer to structure and accessing structure members directly.
/* Generated struct from schema */
struct Message {
 uint32_t qty;
 const char *symbol;
};

void consume_message(void *incoming_message) {
 const struct Message *msg = (const struct Message*) incoming_message;
 printf(&quot;Traded %u of %s\n&quot;, msg-&gt;qty, msg-&gt;symbol);
}
====Other FIX encodings====
FIX Trading Community has also developed standard mappings between FIX and other message protocols, including:

* Google Protocol Buffers
* ASN.1
* JSON

===Session protocols===
The session layer is responsible for message exchange including checkpoint recovery mechanisms.

==== FIX Transport (FIXT) ====
The original FIX session protocol did not have its own name since it was part of a monolithic specification covering application layer semantics and message encoding as well. However, starting with FIX version 5.0, the session layer was split off as an independent specification with the introduction of FIXT. FIXT was largely the same as the original unnamed session layer in version 4.x, but it offered one significant innovation--it provided a mechanism to mix FIX application layer versions over a common session version. The current FIXT version is 1.1.

Theoretically, FIXT is transport independent. However, it is usually employed over Transmission Control Protocol (TCP).

FIXT is a point-to-point protocol. It guarantees message delivery in both directions. Messages sent in each direction carry a message sequence number in the message header. If there is a communication fault, a peer may request retransmission of missed messages. Message delivery is supported even in the event of disconnection and later reestablishment of a session.

To implement session establishment and guaranteed delivery, FIXT and classic FIX 4.x define these session message types:

* Heartbeat
* Test Request
* ResendRequest
* Reject
* SequenceReset
* Logout
* Logon
* XMLnonFIX

==== FIX Performance Session Layer (FIXP) ====
FIXP was developed by the FIX High Performance Working Group to meet the needs of high performance trading. The primary need is for low latency message encoding and decoding and control over message delivery guarantees.

To provide low latency, binary message encodings are supported both for session layer and application messages. The actual wire format is abstracted in the FIXP specification, so users may select a FIX encoding of their choice, so long as peers agree on a protocol to use. Early development has used Simple Binary Encoding.

FIXP covers both point-to-point and multicast use cases with common primitives.

When a point-to-point session is established, peers negotiate delivery guarantees from among the following choices:

* Recoverable: exactly-once message delivery. If gaps are detected, then missed messages may be recovered by retransmission.
* Idempotent: at-most-once delivery. If gaps are detected, the sender is notified, but recovery is under the control of the application, if it is done at all.
* Unsequenced: makes no delivery guarantees. This choice is appropriate if guarantees are unnecessary or if recovery is provided at the application layer or through a different communication channel.
* Note: No application messages should be sent in one direction of a session.

Delivery guarantees may be asymmetrical. For example, a trader may enter orders over an idempotent flow while executions are returned over a recoverable flow. In fast moving markets, the delay inherent in retransmission is often undesirable, resulting in missed opportunities or bad trades.

==Diagrammatic representation of FIX system==
Below is a diagram of how to FIX messaging looks between Buyside/Customer and Sellside/Supplier.

==Latest developments in FIX protocol==
The latest version of FIX Protocol implements &quot;Transport Independence&quot; by permitting multiple versions of application messages to be carried over a single version of Transport Independent FIX Session (FIXT.1.1 and higher).

Transport Independence also paves the way for transport protocols such as message queues and web services to be used instead of traditional FIX over TCP.

FIX now supports algorithmic trading by the use of FIX Algorithmic Trading Definition Language FIXatdl.

In 2005, the FIX Trading Community released FAST protocol which stands for FIX Adapted for Streaming. FAST is a binary protocol and is used mostly for sending Multicast market data via UDP connections.

Further, in 2020, the FIX Trading Community released a new FIX binary encoding, based on Simple Binary Encoding (SBE), meant to complement the existing FAST encoding.

<doc id="734285" wikidata="Q3489584" url="?curid=734285" title="Solon Earl Low">
<text>Solon Earl Low (January 8, 1900 – December 22, 1962) was a Canadian politician, farmer, teacher, and school principal in the 20th century.

==Early life==
Low was born in Cardston, District of Alberta, Northwest Territories, on January 8, 1900 to Sarah Ida (Barber) and James Paton Low. Low&#x27;s father was a teacher, businessman, and participant in the Utah Constitutional Convention in 1895.

Low attended Cardston public schools and studied education at Calgary Normal College, the University of Alberta, and University of Southern California. At the University of Alberta, he took a lively interest in student activities including debate, basketball, and other sports. After his education he began teaching. He was married twice, the second time to Alice Fren Litchfield; together, they had five of his eight children.

==Political life==
Low was elected to the Legislative Assembly of Alberta in the 1935 Alberta general election that swept the Social Credit Party of Alberta to power. Low became provincial treasurer under Premier William Aberhart in 1937. Low brokered an agreement during the 1937 Social Credit backbenchers&#x27; revolt to continue the government through a three-month budget and to try to bring Major C. H. Douglas to Alberta. As a Minister, Low introduced &quot;Accurate News and Information Act&quot; on October 1, 1937, and was passed by the legislature on October 4, 1937, during a marathon session which lasted until 12:30 the next morning. Lieutenant-Governor of Alberta John C. Bowen reserved royal assent until the Supreme Court of Canada evaluated the act&#x27;s legality. In 1938&#x27;s &quot;Reference re Alberta Statutes&quot;, the court found that it was unconstitutional, and it never became law. Low was defeated in 1940 but regained a seat in a by-election in which George Woytkiw resigned for him. Low also held the Minister of Education position in Premier Ernest Manning&#x27;s government in 1943-1944.

In 1944, he was acclaimed the first national leader of the Social Credit Association of Canada at the party&#x27;s founding convention. Though there had been a group of Social Credit MPs in parliament since 1935 under the leadership of John Horne Blackmore, the party did not have its first national convention until 1944, when the national party was formally founded. He was first elected to the House of Commons in the 1945 federal election. Low represented Peace River, Alberta until he lost his seat, along with every other Social Credit Member of Parliament (MP), in the 1958 federal election. Low retired as party leader in 1961 and became a judge of the juvenile and family court in Lethbridge in 1961. He would die later in 1962.

==Personal life==
Low was a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. His family moving to Edmonton in 1937 was a key event in the growth of the church in that city. His wife Alice was the first leader of the young women program in the Edmonton Branch.

Low contributed to Social Credit&#x27;s reputation for anti-Semitism by numerous controversial comments. As Alberta treasurer, he once said:

:&quot;[A]nti-Semitism is spreading because people cannot fail to observe that a disproportionate number of Jews occupy positions of control in international finance, in revolutionary activities and in some propaganda institutions, the common policy of which is the centralization of power and the perversion of religious and cultural ideals.&quot;

:Ending anti-Semitism, he said, would require Jews to denounce those &quot;arch-criminals&quot; in their midsts who are responsible for these initiatives.

In 1947, when Low was the federal leader of the Social Credit party, he used a national Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC) broadcast to lambaste &quot;the international power maniacs who aim to destroy Christianity&quot; and the &quot;international gangsters who are day-to-day scheming for world revolution.&quot; He also claimed there was a &quot;close tie-up between international communism, international finance, and international political Zionism.&quot; Low repudiated anti-Semitism in 1957 after he had criticized Canada for not fully supporting Britain and France in the Suez Crisis and also visited Israel.
