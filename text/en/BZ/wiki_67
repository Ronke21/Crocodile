<text>Seminex is the widely used abbreviation for Concordia Seminary in Exile (later Christ Seminary-Seminex), which existed from 1974 to 1987 after a schism in the Lutheran Church–Missouri Synod (LCMS). The seminary in exile was formed due to the ongoing Fundamentalist–Modernist Controversy that was dividing Protestant churches in the United States. At issue were foundational disagreements on the authority of Scripture and the role of Christianity. During the 1960s, many clergy and members of the LCMS grew concerned about the direction of education at their flagship seminary, Concordia Seminary, in St. Louis, Missouri. Professors at Concordia Seminary had, in the 1950s and 1960s, begun to utilize the historical-critical method to analyze the Bible rather than the traditional historical-grammatical method that considered scripture to be the inerrant Word of God.

After attempts at compromise failed, the LCMS president, Jacob Preus, moved to suspend the seminary president John Tietjen, leading to a walkout of most faculty and students, and the formation of Seminex. Seminex existed as an institution until its last graduating class of 1983 and was formally dissolved and merged with Lutheran School of Theology at Chicago in 1987. Concordia Seminary quickly rebuilt and by the late 1970s had regained its place as one of the largest Lutheran seminaries in the United States.

The after effects of the controversy were vast. Before the split, the LCMS had both liberal and Evangelical wings. After Seminex, 200 liberal and moderate congregations split from the LCMS to form the Association of Evangelical Lutheran Churches (AELC), leaving the LCMS a more conservative body than it had been in 1969. The AELC itself would later merge with other liberal and moderate Lutheran churches to form the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America (ELCA).

==Background==
===Formation of the LCMS===
In the 1830s, a group of Saxon Germans immigrated to the United States and settled in St. Louis and in Perry County, Missouri. They were fleeing the forced union of German churches by royal fiat. Seizing the opportunity to freely practice their confession, these immigrants, eventually led by C. F. W. Walther, established what would eventually become known as the Lutheran Church–Missouri Synod. Reacting against the rise of theologians such as Albrecht Ritschl and Friedrich Schleiermacher, Walther emphasized the inspiration and authority of the Bible as well as a strict adherence to the Lutheran Confessions.

In addition to a strict adherence to the Lutheran Confessions, Walther also sought to ensure that the new synod was decentralized and congregational. No congregation could be compelled to accept any resolution from a synodical convention or presidential decree that was contrary to the Word of God and the Lutheran Confessions. Each congregation is to be properly taught by a pastor who has been certified for the ministry by one of the official seminaries of the synod. The seminaries themselves are overseen by the synodical president, but he could not take any action against any official of the synod unless empowered by a resolution passed by the synod in convention. It was this governing structure that was to be sorely tested in the Seminex crisis.

=== Rise of theological modernism ===
Beginning in the middle of the 19th century in Germany, a group of philosophers at the University of Erlangen and the University of Tübingen began applying a new method of interpretation of Biblical texts. Supernatural elements of the Bible, such as miracles and the Virgin Birth, were dismissed or explained away in natural terms. Historical accounts in the Bible such as the Hittite Empire and the United Monarchy were assumed to be unreliable, and figures such as Abraham, Moses, and Noah were held to be entirely fictional.

Not limited to just the Bible, theological liberalism also sought to change the way that the Lutheran Confessions were understood. The Confessions themselves do not use the term &quot;inerrancy&quot; with regard to the Scriptures.

During the synodical presidency of Franz Pieper, these new theological methods had only limited support within the LCMS. In 1932, Pieper authored the &quot;Brief Statement of the Doctrinal Position of the Missouri Synod&quot;. In that booklet, Pieper attacked the new theologies, with the statement being circulated widely within the synod. So popular was Pieper&#x27;s position that well into the 20th century, a majority of LCMS pastors described themselves as Pieperians. Despite Pieper&#x27;s popularity and resolutions by several synodical conventions endorsing the &quot;Brief Statement&quot;, theological modernism slowly made inroads in the LCMS.

=== Rise of student activism ===
Concordia Seminary was affected, as were many institutions of higher education in the United States, by the rise of student activism in the late 1960s and early 1970s relating to the Vietnam War and the civil rights movement. On February 10, 1969, about 250 students petitioned the seminary for a three-day moratorium from classes in order to discuss student issues and grievances. One of the main issues was the definition of &quot;full-time&quot; enrollment, which determined whether a student was eligible for deferment from the military draft for the war. Later that year the many students wanted to participate in the Moratorium to End the War in Vietnam on October 15.

The killing of four students at Kent State University on May 4, 1970, led to Concordia students holding a vigil for the Kent State victims on May 6. Four crosses were erected in the seminary quadrangle, the bells were tolled, and barbed wire was strung.

During the 1969–70 school year and thereafter, the student newspaper, the &quot;Spectrum&quot;, urged students to take action to boycott California table grapes, work for social justice, and fight discrimination. The student response to the events leading to the establishment of Seminex borrowed from the previous activism. For example, the crosses erected for the walkout and the tolling of the bells replicated the response to the Kent State killings.

==Early tensions==
===Concordia Seminary===
Under the presidency of Alfred Fuerbringer from 1953 to 1969, Concordia Seminary had developed a reputation as a more liberal institution within the LCMS due to its teaching of historical-critical methods of biblical interpretation. Though the charges were reformulated in several different reports, they generally held that the faculty (and, particularly, members of the exegetical theology department) were using historical-critical methods for biblical interpretation, and that these professors improperly stressed the importance of the doctrine or teaching of the Gospel (forgiveness of sins in Christ) over the importance of the whole of the Christian Bible. The September 1, 1972, &quot;Report of the Synodical President&quot; states:

Sensing that the LCMS was changing its theological position, two other conservative Lutheran church bodies, the Evangelical Lutheran Synod and the Wisconsin Synod, who had been in altar and pulpit fellowship with the LCMS for a century, suspended that fellowship with the LCMS in 1955 and 1961, respectively, and withdrew from the Evangelical Lutheran Synodical Conference in 1963, a body the synods had co-founded in 1872.

Beginning in 1959 and continuing through 1973, the laity in the LCMS reacted to the growing modernism at Concordia Seminary by passing a series of seventeen resolutions either affirming full biblical inerrancy or condemning the spread of &quot;antiscriptural teaching&quot; in the synod. Fuerbringer ignored these resolutions as well as the growing discontent in the synod. Many conservatives in the LCMS asked whether the seminary was serving the denomination or the denomination was serving the seminary.

===Ascension of John Tietjen===
At the end of 1968, Fuerbringer announced his retirement as president of Concordia Seminary, triggering the selection process for his replacement. Presidents of the LCMS seminaries at that time were elected by a vote of the following four entities, with each entity having one vote: the president of the LCMS, the president of the LCMS district in which the institution was located (in this case, the Missouri District), the seminary&#x27;s Board of Control, and the LCMS Board of Higher Education. At the time, these positions were all under the control of either supporters of the ecumenical movement or theological modernists.

Among this group, there was increasing concern that the incumbent synodical president, Oliver Harms, was going to lose his reelection bid. Harms was a key supporter of the Lutheran Council in the United States of America (LCUSA) and other inter-Lutheran cooperation, and the modernist faction was concerned that confessional insurgents would disrupt the process of selection for presidency of Concordia Seminary; hindering the greater goal of Lutheran unity. In addition, members of the seminary&#x27;s Board of Control would be elected at the convention. There was great urgency to complete the process of selecting a new seminary president before the upcoming synod convention could interfere. While the procedure for actually electing the seminary president was normal, the timing was unusual in that It was the first time a new president of the seminary would be elected before the actual retirement of his predecessor.

In May 1969, John Tietjen was selected president of Concordia Seminary after sixteen years as a minister in New Jersey and three years heading the public relations division of LCUSA. Although a virtual unknown among the broader synod, Tietjen was well known in the ecumenical movement. The selection of Tietjen caused great excitement among the faculty of Concordia Seminary and in wider Lutheran circles. In the words of the wife of Ed Schroeder (then a professor at the seminary), &quot;Tietjen is the one we wanted&quot;.

===Election of Jacob Preus===
Two months later, Jacob Preus—then the president of the other LCMS seminary, Concordia Theological Seminary in Springfield, Illinois—was elected president of the synod in an upset over the incumbent Harms. Preus&#x27;s 1969 campaign for the LCMS presidency was supported by conservatives within the church body who opposed moves by Harms to institute altar and pulpit fellowship with the American Lutheran Church (ALC), which did not hold the Bible as infallible and inerrant. Preus&#x27;s supporters wanted to see the LCMS, and especially its colleges and seminaries, adopt more uniform orthodox and confessional theological stances.

Within a year of assuming office, Preus established a Fact Finding Committee to examine the teachings of the seminary&#x27;s faculty. The committee presented this complete report to Preus on June 15, 1971. Two weeks later, Preus sent the entire report to the seminary Board of Control and seminary president Tietjen.

That report, called &quot;The Blue Book&quot; due to its cover, was later mailed to all congregations and pastors of the LCMS in September 1972. The main bulk of the report consisted of a large number of quotations from the transcripts of the interviews with the seminary faculty members, whose anonymity was protected. The Blue Book had a powerful effect in the LCMS. Based upon the committee&#x27;s findings, the seminary&#x27;s board of control was instructed &quot;to take appropriate action on the basis of the report, commending or correcting where necessary ... That the Board of Control report progress directly to the President of Synod and the Board for Higher Education&quot;.

The seminary&#x27;s board of control however had a 6-5 majority in favor of Tietjen and the faculty, and in February 1973 by a 6–5 vote, the board commended each member as faithful to Scripture and the Lutheran confessions. But the 1973 LCMS convention in New Orleans condemned the seminary&#x27;s faculty in a resolution that charged them with &quot;abolish[ing] the formal principle, &quot;sola Scriptura&quot; (i.e. that all doctrines are derived from the Scripture and the Scripture is the sole norm of all doctrine)&quot;. A new, more conservative seminary board of control was also elected at that convention, and the new board quickly proceeded to suspend Tietjen from the presidency of Concordia Seminary in August 1973. The suspension was initially delayed and then &quot;vacated&quot; while various groups in the LCMS attempted to find a route toward reconciliation, but Tietjen was again suspended on January 20 of the following year.

==Synod in schism==
===Formation of Seminex===

The day after Tietjen&#x27;s second suspension, some of the seminary&#x27;s students and faculty registered their protest. A group of students organized a moratorium on classes (which had been planned in the fall but was delayed because of the death of Arthur Carl Piepkorn, the graduate professor of systematic theology on December 13, 1973, causing the Board of Control to cancel its December 19 board meeting).

A large majority of the seminary&#x27;s students voted on the morning of February 19, 1974, to continue their education under the targeted faculty at an off-campus site. Immediately after the students passed their resolution, they and the majority of the faculty staged a dramatic walkout, inviting the local press for the event. Singing &quot;The Church&#x27;s One Foundation&quot;, they processed out of the seminary grounds, where students had planted white crosses bearing their names. The event attracted a great deal of media attention. However, the seminary&#x27;s Board of Control subsequently accused the students of disingenuous posturing, noting that the students had returned to the seminary cafeteria for lunch immediately after their supposed departure and continued to live in student housing for the remainder of the term.

The next day, classes officially began at Concordia Seminary in Exile (Seminex) in facilities provided by Eden Seminary and Saint Louis University. Since Seminex was not yet an accredited school, an arrangement was made with the Lutheran School of Theology at Chicago (LSTC) whereby the first class of Seminex graduates would officially receive their diplomas from LSTC. The first graduation was held in the neo-Gothic quadrangle of Washington University in St. Louis. John Tietjen, who in October 1974 was finally removed as president of Concordia Seminary, was elected president of Seminex in February 1975.

Within a year and a half of its inception, Seminex had acquired its own facilities at 607 North Grand Boulevard and then, following water damage to that building, at 539 North Grand. The institution also immediately received provisional accreditation through the Association of Theological Schools. No longer acknowledging the legitimacy of Concordia Seminary and its new administration led by Martin Scharlemann, Seminex faculty and students referred to that institution simply as &quot;801&quot;, after its address at 801 DeMun Avenue. However, facing legal action from Concordia, the exiled seminary eventually changed its official name from &quot;Concordia Seminary in Exile&quot; to &quot;Christ Seminary-Seminex&quot; in October 1977.

===Widening rift===
In the wake of conservative advancements at the 1973 LCMS convention, opponents had convened a conference in Chicago to chart out strategies. The conference&#x27;s 800 delegates promised moral and financial support for church members who faced pressure due to their opposition to the actions of the LCMS convention. They also formed a new organization, Evangelical Lutherans in Mission (ELIM), to serve as a network and rallying point for the liberal wing of the LCMS. ELIM provided financial support to Seminex, along with public-relations assistance via its twice-monthly newspaper, &quot;Missouri in Perspective.&quot;

In an attempt to drum up support for their cause, Seminex students barnstormed the nation as part of &quot;Operation Outreach&quot;, meeting with LCMS congregations to explain their perspective of what happening in the rapidly evolving situation in St. Louis. Tietjen and the other Seminex faculty also contacted various congregations of the LCMS to enlist their support. Tietjen fully expected that a minimum of 1200 congregations of the synod would leave when asked.

As part of the process of ordination in the LCMS, a prospective pastor must be certified for ministry, and per the LCMS constitution, only an official seminary of the synod could issue those certifications. In 1974, there were two institutions in Saint Louis claiming to be the official seminary, with both of them issuing certifications for the ministry. The expectation of Seminex backers was that if they could place enough of their graduates into pastoral positions, the overall synod would be forced to recognize Seminex as an official seminary of the LCMS. Privately, more than half of the district presidents gave their support to the Seminex faction and indicated that they would place graduates of Seminex as vicars and pastors, giving Seminex good reason for hope that they would eventually prevail. Beginning in 1974, presidents of eight of the 35 LCMS districts (equivalent of a diocese) began placing graduates of Seminex as pastors in violation of the LCMS bylaws and constitution. Outraged, the delegates to the next LCMS convention passed a resolution demanding that those districts cease placing Seminex graduates and granting the synodical president the power to remove a district president if the latter refused. Four of the districts subsequently ceased, while four defied the convention&#x27;s resolutions. By 1976, the four dissident district presidents had been removed from office and they subsequently resigned from the synod.

After the expulsion, a movement to leave the synod took shape among dissident congregations and church officials, most of them members of ELIM or congregations that had ordained a Seminex graduate. The largest number of departures came from the LCMS&#x27; non-geographical English District. In the end, more than 200 congregations left the LCMS, a small fraction of what Tietjen had expected.

===Separation of the AELC===
In December 1976, the departing congregations formed a new independent church body, the Association of Evangelical Lutheran Churches (AELC). The AELC proved to be a more socially and theologically liberal church than the LCMS, and shortly after its inception, it departed from LCMS practice on ordination by opening the ministry to women. Furthermore, the new body immediately declared full communion with the ALC and the Lutheran Church in America (LCA), and declared its intent to join the National Council of Churches and the Lutheran World Federation. To ministers and parishioners who remained with the LCMS, this and other moves by the fledgling AELC validated earlier concerns about the faculty majority at Concordia Seminary.

With congregations totaling about 100,000 members, the AELC represented less than 4 percent of the 2.7 million members of the LCMS. In consequence, the break-away organization could not provide nearly enough pastoral positions for all the graduates of Seminex, whose enrollment began to sharply decline.

===End of Seminex===
Starting in 1974, the LCMS made clear to prospective students that there was no chance of ordination in the synod unless course credits were obtained in official LCMS seminaries. The synod also barred Seminex recruiters from the Concordia University System. In 1975, the LCMS convention voted to close Concordia Senior College in Fort Wayne, Indiana, which had allegedly served as a pipeline for students into Seminex.

Due primarily to its difficulties placing graduates in ministerial positions, Seminex enrollment sharply declined over the next decade. By the end of the 1970s, any hope that a large number of LCMS congregations would leave had been extinguished, forcing Tietjen, who was now president of Christ Seminary-Seminex, to begin laying off faculty who had walked out. In addition, the seminary was torn between positioning itself solely as the seminary for the AELC, which would have made it difficult to continue to solicit donations from supporters in the LCMS who had remained in that synod, and reshaping itself as a &quot;pan-Lutheran&quot; seminary that would serve many different Lutheran church bodies. By the beginning of the 1980s, it was clear that there was no possibility of Christ Seminary-Seminex&#x27;s continued existence as a stand-alone institution.

In anticipation of the merger that resulted in the formation of the ELCA, Seminex ultimately dispersed its faculty and students to several seminaries of the ALC and the LCA around the country, including the Lutheran School of Theology at Chicago (LSTC), Wartburg Theological Seminary, and Pacific Lutheran Theological Seminary. The last St. Louis commencement was held in May 1983, although Seminex continued to exist as an educational institution on the LSTC campus in Chicago through the end of 1987. Several professorial chairs at LSTC are still named after Christ Seminary-Seminex.

==Legacy==
After their separation, the AELC catalyzed the formation of the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America. Many pastors and graduates of Seminex became prominent bishops and leaders in the ELCA; for example, in 2009, three of eight seminary presidents were Seminex graduates, as were a number of bishops. Decades later, theologian Carl Braaten wrote that the transfer of so many modernist professors to future seminaries of the ELCA permanently altered the DNA of those institutions, resulting in what he perceived as the root cause of the slow progressive slide of the ELCA. Theologian Robert Benne concurred, writing in &quot;First Things&quot;;
Because Seminex and the related departures of the AELC congregations removed many liberals from the LCMS, the controversy left the synod considerably more conservative by the mid-1970s than it had been a decade earlier. This allowed the LCMS to begin the slow and painful process of rebuilding its confessional heritage. In 1977, the synod&#x27;s convention voted to severely restrict its involvement in LCUSA, a body the synod had been instrumental in founding in 1966, in effect declaring that the synod would not participate in any further merger discussions. In 1981, the synod&#x27;s convention ended the fellowship agreement with the American Lutheran Church that had been reached in 1969. However the LCMS emerged from the crisis bitterly divided.

The 1977 LCMS convention also abruptly withdrew from the joint hymnal project with the LCA and ALC. Thus the &quot;Lutheran Book of Worship&quot; was published in 1978 without the participation of the very denomination that had initiated its production, angering leaders in the other church bodies. Congregations of the LCMS objected to the use of the 1977 revision of the &quot;Book of Common Prayer&quot; in the hymnal and the hymnal&#x27;s use of the Revised Standard Version as well as many other concerns. The hymnal committee of the LCMS attempted to address these concerns as well as remove much of the objectionable content and published a recension of the objected hymnal in 1982, &quot;Lutheran Worship&quot;. However a high level of mistrust in the LCMS between its congregations and denominational leadership meant that the new hymnal was poorly received. A study commissioned by the LCMS in 1999 found that 36% of congregations used the older hymnal, with the rest using some combination of both and only a few exclusively using the &quot;newer&quot; hymnal published 17 years prior to the study. Thus the synod entered the 21st century lacking unity even in its own hymnal.

Concordia Seminary was widely pronounced as dead in the spring of 1974. The stress and turmoil generated by the controversy wrought an enormous toll on all participants, Martin Scharlemann, who had been appointed to replace Tietjen, resigned from the presidency of Concordia Seminary a mere three months into his term due to mental and physical exhaustion. Seminex sympathizers such as Martin Marty stated that the LCMS would be forced to close the school and sell the campus. However, under the leadership of Ralph Bohlmann, who had succeeded Scharlemann as president, enrollment quickly rebounded.
At Concordia Seminary&#x27;s fall convocation in 1974, Francis Schaeffer addressed those of the student body who had not walked out. Schaeffer commended the synod for its faithful stance and noted that this was the first time in history that a church body had resisted the influx of modernism and retained its confessional heritage. The success of the confessional insurgents in the LCMS later inspired a similar group within the Southern Baptist Convention and provided a template for the ultimately successful Southern Baptist conservative resurgence of the 1980s.

<doc id="745262" wikidata="Q419472" url="?curid=745262" title="Pyridostigmine">
<text>Pyridostigmine is a medication used to treat myasthenia gravis and underactive bladder. It is also used together with atropine to end the effects of neuromuscular blocking medication of the non-depolarizing type. It is also used off-label to treat some forms of Postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome. It is typically given by mouth but can also be used by injection. The effects generally begin within 45 minutes and last up to 4 hours.
Common side effects include nausea, diarrhea, frequent urination, and abdominal pain. More severe side effects include low blood pressure, weakness, and allergic reactions. It is unclear if use in pregnancy is safe for the fetus. Pyridostigmine is an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor in the cholinergic family of medications. It works by blocking the action of acetylcholinesterase and therefore increases the levels of acetylcholine.
Pyridostigmine was patented in 1945 and came into medical use in 1955. It is on the World Health Organization&#x27;s List of Essential Medicines. Pyridostigmine is available as a generic medication.

==Medical uses==
Pyridostigmine is used to treat muscle weakness in people with myasthenia gravis or forms of congenital myasthenic syndrome and to combat the effects of curariform drug toxicity. Pyridostigmine bromide has been FDA approved for military use during combat situations as an agent to be given prior to exposure to the nerve agent Soman in order to increase survival. Used in particular during the first Gulf War, pyridostigmine bromide has been implicated as a causal factor in Gulf War syndrome.

With pyridostigmine classified as a type of parasympathomimetic, it can be used to treat underactive bladder.

Pyridostigmine sometimes is used to treat orthostatic hypotension. It may also be of benefit in chronic axonal polyneuropathy.

It is also being prescribed off-label for postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS) as well as complications resulting from Ehlers–Danlos syndrome.

==Contraindications==
Pyridostigmine bromide is contraindicated in cases of mechanical intestinal or urinary obstruction and should be used with caution in patients with bronchial asthma.

==Side effects==
Common side effects include:

* Sweating
* Diarrhea 
* Nausea
* Vomiting 
* Abdominal cramps
* Increased salivation
* Tearing
* Increased bronchial secretions
* Constricted pupils
* Facial flushing due to vasodilation
* Erectile dysfunction

Additional side effects include:

* Muscle twitching 
* Muscle cramps and weakness

==Mechanism of action==
Pyridostigmine is an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor. It inhibits acetylcholinesterase in the synaptic cleft, thus slowing down the hydrolysis of acetylcholine. Like its predecessor neostigmine, it is a quaternary carbamate inhibitor of cholinesterase that does not cross the blood–brain barrier. It carbamylates about 30% of peripheral cholinesterase enzyme, and the carbamylated enzyme eventually regenerates by natural hydrolysis and excess acetylcholine (ACh) levels revert to normal.

The ACh diffuses across the synaptic cleft and binds to receptors on the post synaptic membrane, causing an influx of sodium (Na+,) resulting in depolarization. If large enough, this depolarization results in an action potential. To prevent constant stimulation once the ACh is released, an enzyme called acetylcholinesterase is present in the endplate membrane close to the receptors on the post synaptic membrane, and quickly hydrolyses ACh.

==Names==
Pyridostigmine bromide is available under the trade name Mestinon (Valeant Pharmaceuticals), Regonol and Gravitor (SUN Pharma).

<text>The Brown Daily Herald is the student newspaper of Brown University in Providence, Rhode Island.

Established in 1866 and published daily since 1891, The &quot;Herald&quot; is the second-oldest student newspaper among America&#x27;s college dailies. It is financially and editorially independent of the University, and publishes Monday through Friday during the academic year with additional issues during commencement, summer and orientation. The &quot;Herald&quot; is managed by a board of trustees comprising two editorial staffers, two business staffers and five &quot;Herald&quot; alumni. Many alumni of &quot;The Brown Daily Herald&quot; have gone on to careers in journalism, and several have won Pulitzer Prizes.

==History==

===Early years===


The &quot;Herald&quot; first appeared on Wednesday, December 2, 1891. The first issue was printed during the night and copies were distributed to each door in the dormitories with no preliminary announcement. The secret planning for the paper was actually begun about a month earlier by Ted Baylies (Class of 1895) and George Hunter (Class of 1895), who, as readers of &quot;The Harvard Crimson&quot; and &quot;The Yale Daily News&quot;, were convinced that they could put out a daily newspaper at Brown.

They enlisted the help of John (Class of 1893) and Edward Casey (Class of 1893), who were putting themselves through college in their printing shop at the foot of College Hill. Baylies and Steve Hopkins (Class of 1893) rounded up advertising for the whole year to insure the financial soundness of their proposed venture. Ben Johnson (Class of 1893), H. Anthony Dyer (Class of 1894), and Guy A. Andrews (Class of 1895) were also named to the board of editors. The approval of 8th University President Elisha Benjamin Andrews and other faculty members was obtained before the first issue appeared.

The four-page paper was printed at the Casey shop on a single-cylinder press operated by a wheel, mostly by the labor of the editors after they discovered that the tramp printer they had hired was given to drinking. The price of the paper was two cents a copy or $1.50 per year. The &quot;Herald&quot; received a cool reception from the &quot;Brunonian&quot;, which in 1890 had welcomed the &quot;Brown Magazine&quot; as a new literary publication and devoted its own pages to news, but had rejected the idea of daily publication. A Brunonian editorial criticized the appearance of the &quot;Herald&quot;, and stated:

The &quot;Herald&quot; survived and even began to have a social life, holding its first banquet at the Crown Hotel in 1903, and playing the first of a long series of annual baseball games against the &quot;Brunonian&quot; in 1907. As a supporter of Charles Evans Hughes 1881 for president in 1916, the &quot;Herald&quot; happily and in large print proclaimed his victory on November 8, 1916 before learning that he had actually lost the election.

===World War I===
The &quot;Herald&quot; dropped the word &quot;Daily&quot; in May 1917 when publication was limited to three days a week. In the fall of 1918 the paper became a semi-weekly. On February 1, 1919, daily publication was resumed. During the war, letters from alumni in the service were featured.

===1920s===
After the war, the paper turned its attention to other matters, printing a green issue for St. Patrick&#x27;s Day in 1920, and on January 20, 1921, an editorial on the immoral behavior of Brown students and their dates, the &quot;social buds&quot;, who came to Brown dances and checked their corsets with the hat-check attendant. The editorial provoked replies and received a whole page of coverage in the &quot;Boston American&quot;. &quot;The Literary Supplement of the Brown Daily Herald&quot;, a twelve-page collection of poetry and short pieces of prose, priced at fifteen cents, made two appearances, in April and May 1921, and then disappeared.

For some reason, in December 1921, when the &quot;Herald&quot; was celebrating its thirtieth anniversary, the masthead began to include the words, &quot;Founded in 1866, Daily since 1891.&quot; The reason for the determination of this date of &quot;founding&quot; is uncertain. Perhaps the &quot;Herald&quot; decided to adopt its rival, the &quot;Brunonian&quot;—with which it had coexisted—as an antecedent. The &quot;Herald&quot; would then be able to stretch its life back to 1866, when another &quot;Brunonian&quot;, this one a rival of the &quot;Brown Paper&quot;, appeared. On October 19, 1924, a newspaper appeared with the title, &quot;Brown Daily Drivel&quot;, a single issue printed by students as a travesty of &quot;The Brown Daily Herald&quot;. In later years, the &quot;Herald&quot; issued its own comic papers, often on April Fools&#x27; Day, a tradition that continues today.

===World War II===
In 1933, the &quot;Herald&quot; caused a considerable stir by launching an editorial campaign urging students at Brown and at other colleges to sign petitions pledging &quot;not to bear arms except when the country is invaded.&quot; An unexpected result was the appointment by the Rhode Island General Assembly of a committee &quot;to investigate the University and to provide penalties for disloyalty to the State and Nation.&quot; The response of the students was to raise the number of pledges to 700. The peace drive spread to other colleges and soon an Intercollegiate Disarmament Council was inviting colleges across the country to join the peace movement.

The university administration, while not in favor of the stand, did not interfere, and the legislative committee concluded that there was no need to suppress the movement as there was no evidence of a connection with disloyal organizations outside the University. When a destructive hurricane struck New England on September 21, 1938, during freshman week, eight upperclassmen who were on campus to greet the freshmen managed to get out by candlelight a mimeographed one-page edition of the &quot;Herald&quot;, followed by a similar two-page issue the next day.

During World War II, &quot;The Brown Daily Herald&quot; again suspended publication on January 12, 1943. From March 10 to August 13, 1943 the paper was published weekly and called the &quot;Brown Herald&quot;. From August 20, 1943 to October 5, 1945 the weekly &quot;Brown Herald-Record&quot; replaced the &quot;Brown Herald&quot; and the &quot;Pembroke Record&quot;, and during that time had a woman editor, Audrey Mishel &#x27;44. In September 1947, when the &quot;Herald&quot; resumed daily publication, it published a magazine called &quot;Midnight&quot;, a manual of sorts for the &quot;Herald&quot; staff. The title came from the paper&#x27;s deadline.

===1950s–1960s===
Since September 1947, &quot;The Brown Daily Herald&quot; has been published regularly. However, its duration is not as long as its numbering suggests, having been inadvertently extended on January 18, 1959, when the volume number abruptly changed from 68 to 88, an error on which all subsequent numbering has been based. &quot;The Brown Daily Herald Supplement&quot; was first published on September 28, 1959. The contents of the first issue were an interesting assortment—a review of &quot;Lady Chatterley&#x27;s Lover&quot; (recently reissued in the United States, where it had been banned), photographs of life on South Main Street (identified on the cover as &quot;Slums&quot;), an article on the prospects of the Ivy League season, an article on new chairman of the National Republican Congressional Committee, and a cartoon by Jules Feiffer.

&quot;The Supplement&quot; continued to be a weekly (although not always on the same day of the week) publication until 1963. &quot;The Brown Herald Review&quot;, containing literary pieces, art, and book reviews, was published eight times during the academic year from October 1963 until January 1966. A hoax issue of the Herald which went wrong was that of December 6, 1965, with its oversized headline, &quot;Pembrokers Get Apartments; Experiment Begins in Spring,&quot; and related stories. The next day, Editor-in-Chief M. Charles Bakst &#x27;66 and two managing editors resigned, stating that in conceiving the hoax issue they had believed that it &quot;would be humorous in the short-run and conducive in the long run to a more thorough discussion of Pembroke&#x27;s residential and social system.&quot;

In fact, their stories had been taken at face value by some students, faculty, and administration, who were not amused. On March 27, 1964, a similar effort proclaiming &quot;Pembroke No Longer &#x27;Coordinate&#x27;; Corporation Makes Brown &#x27;Co-ed and &quot;Keeney Selects Special Committee to Supervise &#x27;Herald had brought forth no more than a cheerful communication to the managing board from President Keeney, probably because of the proximity to April Fools&#x27; Day.

===1960s–1990s===
In 1968, Beverly Hodgson &#x27;70 was acclaimed by the press as the &quot;First Woman Editor of Ivy League Daily&quot; (and coincidentally later married the nephew of Audrey Mishel, the woman editor of the &quot;Herald-Record&quot; of World War II), and with her managing editor, another woman, Laura Hersh &#x27;70, got the &quot;Herald&quot; out from its new offices at 195 Angell Street. In 1973, &quot;The Brown Daily Herald&quot; Voluntary Publishing Association, which took in outside printing jobs as well as publishing the &quot;Herald&quot;, was facing financial difficulties after purchasing typesetting equipment.

The solution was the founding of &quot;Fresh Fruit&quot;, a college-oriented tabloid with distribution to eight college campuses and the potential for generating advertising income. Its first appearance was in &quot;The Brown Daily Herald&quot; of February 15, 1973. In February 1975, an editorial staff separate from that of the &quot;Herald&quot; took over the publication of &quot;Fresh Fruit&quot;. The &quot;Herald&quot;, still in debt after a 1974 operating loss of $10,000, began an alumni subscription drive, filed claims against its creditors, and sought incorporation under the laws of Rhode Island.

With the Commencement issue of 1975, &quot;The Brown Daily Herald Voluntary Publishing Association&quot; became &quot;The Brown Daily Herald, Inc.&quot; In 1985, the &quot;Herald&quot; entered into a contract with the Undergraduate Council of Students, in which UCS agreed to purchase 5,500 subscriptions at five dollars each for every member of the student body, though UCS later cancelled this contract and the &quot;Herald&quot; has been free since. A weekend insert called &quot;Good Clean Fun&quot; was added in 1986.

In September 1989, a new supplement, intended to be monthly, appeared under the title, &quot;In Depth&quot;. Editor-in-chief of the &quot;Herald&quot; Amy Bach expressed the hope that the new supplement would serve as a forum for the thorough exploration of one topic each month. The first issue was devoted to articles on depression, the second to Providence&#x27;s neighborhoods. On November 2, 1991, &quot;The Brown Daily Herald&quot; held a one-hundredth anniversary celebration, at which William Kovach was the keynote speaker.
==Today&#x27;s &quot;Herald&quot;==

===Sections===

The &quot;Herald&quot; is organized into four sections:

;1. News: The largest section of the newspaper, &quot;News&quot; covers University news—stories directly affecting the Brown community, from student life, to prominent speakers, to administrative changes—metro news—stories central to Providence and its surrounding cities, ranging from Rhode Island state legislation to government-related student protest, including the goings on of local restaurants and shops—and science and research—stories regarding research of both science and humanities professors as well as general science topics and news on campus. The University News, Metro and Science &amp; Research sections were consolidated into the News section under the 126th Editorial Board.

;2. Arts &amp; Culture : With reports and reviews of on-campus plays, films, and art exhibitions and installations, the &quot;Arts &amp; Culture&quot; section is a soft news alternative to the typically straightforward and sharp News section. It appears Wednesday and Friday.
;3. Sports: A blend of opinion and match coverage, the &quot;Sports&quot; section covers intercollegiate competitions, profiles individual players, and offers opinions on professional sports teams and leagues.

;4. Commentary: Comprising letters and op-eds, &quot;Commentary&quot; appears daily. The editorial page contains a staff editorial, as well as letters to the editor.

===&quot;Post-&quot; magazine===
Post- is the &quot;Herald&quot;″s weekly arts and culture magazine, running each Thursday. Its name originally referenced the academic convention of using &quot;post-&quot; as a prefix—as in &quot;post-modernism&quot; and &quot;post-structuralism&quot;—to indicate transcending older modes of thought.

&quot;Post-&quot; regularly contains film, television, and music reviews, editorials on Brown University&#x27;s arts scene, and two sex columns called &quot;Sexpertise&quot;, one written by a male and one by a female. It also includes colorful commentary on current events.

===&quot;Herald&quot; style===
The &quot;Herald&quot; has a unique style. The paper references academic departments, faculty titles, University campaigns, and organizations abbreviated by acronyms so regularly that it has several case-specific policies for references. The &quot;Herald&quot; does not employ the serial comma, and favors the word &quot;said&quot; after a quote over &quot;mentioned&quot;, &quot;pointed out&quot;, etc.

Generally the &quot;Herald&quot; defaults to the Associated Press style, and therefore keeps numerous copies of the &quot;AP Stylebook&quot; on hand in its office.

===Staff===
&quot;The Brown Daily Herald&quot; employs over 250 voluntary staff members, who work as editors, business managers, reporters, designers, photographers, and artists. Tom Li is the Editor-in-Chief and also serves as president of The Brown Daily Herald Inc., and Ryan Doherty is managing editor and vice president.

====Editorial board====
The editorial board manages the &quot;Herald&quot; and is responsible for its daily production. Members usually serve for the spring of their junior year and the fall of their senior year. The board usually consists of between three and seven positions. In recent years, positions on the board have included Editors-in-Chief, Managing Editors, and Senior Editors.

The &quot;Herald&quot; is currently under its 135th editorial board. For this reason, the members of the board are collectively referred to as &quot;135&quot; (pronounced &quot;one-thirty-five&quot;). The members of the 135th editorial board are: Editor-in-Chief Tom Li &#x27;26, Managing Editor Ryan Doherty &#x27;26, Managing Editor Owen Dahlkamp &#x27;26, Managing Editor Julianna Chang &#x27;26, Senior Editor Anisha Kumar &#x27;26, and Senior Editor Yael Wellisch &#x27;26.

====Business====
Because the &quot;Herald&quot; is independent of Brown University, it must generate revenue to sustain itself. The business staff does so mainly through soliciting advertisements in the paper. Additionally, the &quot;Herald&quot; offers daily and weekly subscriptions to the newspaper, and fills around 30 subscriptions each week. Currently, the staff consists of an executive management team, staff members, and one paid employee.

====Production====
The production staff of the &quot;Herald&quot; is responsible for the technical aspects of putting out the day&#x27;s paper. They design the layout of the paper with Adobe InDesign, copy edit the articles, and post content to the Web.

====Section editors====
Each of the &quot;Herald&quot;″s sections is managed by two or more section editors.

===Web presence===

In 1995, the &quot;Herald&quot; became one of the first college newspapers in the United States to publish itself online as well as in print. The newspaper is published each day at —where it can be viewed at no cost to the user—and is divided into sections for easy browsing. All pictures and comics appearing in the paper are also uploaded.

The Web site has informative sections about the &quot;Herald&quot; itself, including &quot;About the Herald&quot;, an FAQ, and contact information. It also announces scheduled meetings and provides means for students to get involved, alumni to subscribe, and people or companies to place advertisements in the paper. Additionally, an archives section organizes and makes available each volume of the &quot;Herald&quot; since March 12, 2004.

Over the winter break of December 2006/January 2007, the &quot;Herald&quot;″s Web site was redesigned with ease of reading and a &quot;clean&quot; feel in mind. The home page was changed to display not only the leading stories but also to list every article appearing in the day&#x27;s volume. Also, many of the darker colors of the previous site were replaced with white, once again emphasizing a cleaner feel. Additionally, a PDF document of the current print edition&#x27;s front page became available for download at the bottom of the home page.

The Web site underwent a second major redesign in April 2009 during the week before Spring Weekend. The changes include a new banner and layout and navigation scheme that more prominently displays advertisements. The Web site is still supported by College Publisher.

===Office===
The Herald&#x27;s offices are at 88 Benevolent Street, where it shares space with WBRU, Brown University&#x27;s student-run radio station, which sold its signal in 2017 but continues to broadcast online. The Herald moved there in 2020 from 195 Angell Street, its home for a half-century.

===9-Spot===
Each Thursday night, the &quot;Herald&quot;″s editorial board hosts a meeting at 9:00 p.m. for all &quot;Herald&quot; staff, at which staffers offer story ideas and talk about whatever is happening outside of the office. The editors spend much of their time at the &quot;Herald&quot; office, so they rely on the staff members at 9-spot to contribute a number of story ideas.

==Controversies==

===Accusations of treason, communism===
In the early 1930s, the &quot;Herald&quot; began a pacifist movement called &quot;War Against War&quot;. The paper launched an editorial campaign urging Brown students to sign petitions pledging &quot;not to bear arms except when the country is invaded.&quot; The movement spread across the country and gained popularity in college papers large and small, which quickly endorsed the &quot;Herald&quot;″s actions. When Rhode Island officials caught wind of the campaign, they immediately grew suspicious and appointed a committee &quot;to investigate the University and to provide penalties for disloyalty to the United States.&quot;

The result was a resolution—passed unanimously by the Rhode Island General Assembly—accusing the &quot;Herald&quot; of treason and associating the paper with the Communist movement. Providence attorney William Needham, himself a graduate of Brown&#x27;s class of 1915, called the War Against War campaign &quot;a foreign movement of communistic tendencies.&quot;

Throughout the process, the Brown administration did not interfere in the legislative action, citing freedom of expression and freedom of the press.

In the end, the committee concluded that the &quot;Herald&quot; and its campaign were not serious enough threats to warrant suppression or any further action, as there was no connection between the &quot;Herald&quot; and disloyal organizations.

===David Horowitz advertisement===
In 2001, the &quot;Herald&quot; ran an advertisement placed by conservative writer and activist David Horowitz, entitled &quot;Ten Reasons Why Reparations for Blacks is a Bad Idea for Blacks—and Racist, Too!&quot; The advertisement had circulated around many college newspapers, but most rejected it, including &quot;The Harvard Crimson&quot; and the &quot;Columbia Daily Spectator&quot;. The &quot;Herald&quot;″s editors at the time—Katherine Boas, Brooks King, Patrick Moos, and Jahred Adelman—decided that if the ad was sent to them, they would run it.

The ad appeared in the March 13, 2001 edition of the &quot;Herald&quot;, and was met with shock and criticism. Among its ten points, the ad stated that Americans should be the last to pay reparations because slavery had existed worldwide for centuries before white American Christians intervened. It also stated that African-Americans were the richest and most privileged black people alive.

On March 14, over 60 students came to the &quot;Herald&quot; office demanding to speak to the newspaper&#x27;s leadership, and met face to face with the &quot;Herald&quot; editors. The following day, a coalition of student groups distributed a petition around campus that condemned the &quot;Herald&quot;″s decision to print the ad and demanded that the paper give $725—the amount they believed Horowitz had paid for the ad—to minority groups on campus. In addition, the petition called for the &quot;Herald&quot; to give the coalition a free full-page ad to &quot;educate the greater Brown community on related issues.&quot;

The editors refused to give in, setting off a chain reaction of events that shook the University.

On the morning of March 15, coalition members took 4,000 copies of the &quot;Herald&quot; from 10 distribution points. In place of the newspapers, they left a flyer stating: &quot;We are using this action as an opportunity to show our community at Brown that our newspaper is not accountable to its supposed constituents. It is a newspaper run by Brown-student opportunists and careerists who are completely unaccountable to the University&#x27;s aims and its student body.&quot;

the &quot;Herald&quot; responded on March 16, a Saturday, by reprinting 1,000 copies of the stolen Friday paper. &quot;Herald&quot; staffers distributed them by hand to students in the lobby of the Sharpe Refectory (a.k.a. the &quot;Ratty&quot;), the largest dining hall on campus.

That same day, the University issued a statement supporting the &quot;Herald&quot;: &quot;Consistent with its commitment to the free exchange of ideas, the University recognizes and supports the &quot;Herald&quot;″s right to publish any material it chooses, even if that material is objectionable to members of the campus community.&quot; Sheila Blumstein, then Interim President of the University, later told the &quot;Herald&quot; that she supported the free exchange of ideas and that the &quot;Herald&quot; had a right to print the ad. But she said &quot;Herald&quot; staff may not have handled the issue as diplomatically as they could have.

National newspapers caught wind of the controversy and covered the story. &quot;The New York Times&quot;, &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, and ABC News, all ran stories about events on campus.

The furor surrounding the events later died down, with neither party reaching an agreement. The &quot;Herald&quot; still maintains that its actions were protected under freedom of the press.

A Slavery and Justice Committee was formed a few years after. Though Jim Campbell, chairman of the Committee, was one of the &quot;Herald&quot;″s detractors, and the Committee considered reparations as part of its agenda, there is no official connection between the Committee and the events surrounding the advertisement.

In March 2011, on the 10th anniversary of the reparations advertisement, an ad about the Israeli-Palestinian conflicts for Horowitz&#x27; website www.walloflies.org was published in the &quot;Herald&quot; leading to another campus-wide controversy. Though the controversy quickly died down, graffiti stating &quot;The &quot;BDH&quot; is racist&quot; remained on sidewalks on and around campus.

<doc id="745268" wikidata="Q558216" url="?curid=745268" title="German Football League">
<text>The German Football League (GFL) is an American football league in Germany and was formed in 1979. Playing rules are based on those of American college football in the NCAA. In 1999, the league changed its name from &quot;American-Football-Bundesliga&quot; to &quot;German Football League&quot;. In terms of attendance figures, cumulative salaries paid by teams, performance in international exhibition games and competitions and ability to draw foreign talent, the GFL is arguably the strongest national league in Europe.

== League structure ==

===Regular season=== 
The GFL is divided into the north and south conferences, each with eight teams. In each conference, every team plays against every other team of its own conference, both at home and away. Until 2011, each team also played home and away interconference games against the team from the opposing conference that finished the previous season on the same rank. However, this was abandoned with the league expansion to 16 teams. 

===Playoffs=== 
After the end of the regular season, four teams from both conferences enter the playoffs, to determine the German championship. The winner of a conference plays against the 4th place team of the other group, second against third of the other conference. Better placed teams enjoy home field advantage in the playoffs (regardless of record) – the seeding ensures that two teams that finished on the same rank in their division can only meet in the (neutral site) final. The final is called the German Bowl. The lowest ranked team of each conference plays a home and away series against the winner of the second division, and may be relegated if they lose. In case one or several teams withdraw from the GFL, relegation is forgone, more teams are promoted or other measures are taken to &quot;fill up&quot; the divisions to nominal strength if possible.

===League expansion=== 
The league had been expanded from 12 to 14 teams for the 2011 season. It further increased the number of teams to 16 in 2012.

===Promotion and relegation=== 
Below the GFL sits the GFL2, formerly the &quot;2nd Bundesliga&quot;, which was formed in 1982. It is also divided into a northern and southern division, with eight teams in each. For the 2011 season, both the northern and the southern champions are promoted, while the runners-up of the two divisions will play the last placed team in the GFL division above for another spot in the league in 2012. There are various regional leagues below the GFL2 with eight tiers in total in some areas. A newly founded team must start out at the bottom of the league pyramid, just as in soccer, even though there have been rare exceptions, including the Hamburg Blue Devils.

For most of its history, the GFL has been divided into a northern and southern division. Only in 1979 was it played in single division format, while, from 1986 to 1990, it was divided into four regional divisions.

As of 2010, the Munich Cowboys have played more GFL games than any other team, 335, followed by the Berlin Adler with 312, the only other team with more than 300 league games. The Cowboys have played 29 out of a possible 32 seasons at the highest level of the game in Germany, more than any other club.

==History==

===Early years (1977–1982)===
The history of American football in Germany, outside the US Army bases in the country, began in 1977, when the Frankfurter Löwen were formed as the first club to play the game in Germany. At first, this team was only able to play US Army teams, lacking German opposition. The formation of the league dates back to a West German TV interview with Alexander Sperber, son of a U.S. Army soldier and German mother, which created enough interest to form a number of teams and the league, referred to as German-American Football League. In March 1979, the &quot;AFBD&quot;, the American Football Federation of Germany (), was formed, the first of its kind in Europe. This organisation, in 1982, was replaced by the &quot;AFVD&quot;, the American Football Association of Germany ().

In 1979, the &quot;American-Football-Bundesliga&quot;, later to be renamed the German Football League, was formed, consisting of six clubs, the Frankfurter Löwen, Ansbach Grizzlies, Düsseldorf Panther, Munich Cowboys, Berliner Bären, and Bremerhaven Seahawks. Of those six, the top two teams would contest the first ever German Bowl on 10 November 1979. The first-ever league game was held on 4 August 1979, played between the Frankfurter Löwen and the Düsseldorf Panther, and ended in a victory for Frankfurt.

The league saw a split in its second and third season, with Düsseldorf and Bremerhaven leaving the competition to take part in a separate, short-lived competition, the &quot;Nordwestdeutsche Football Liga – NFL&quot;. By 1981, the &quot;Bundesliga&quot; was expanded to two regional divisions of seven clubs each. The early years of the league were dominated by two teams, Frankfurt and Ansbach, who met each other in the first three editions of the German Bowl. Of those, Frankfurt won the first two, remaining unbeaten in 1979, and Ansbach the last. The era of the Frankfurter Löwen was hereby ended and the club went defunct in the mid-1980s, while the Ansbach Grizzlies continued to be an outstanding team, playing in all of the first eight German Bowls. Unlike the first season, play-off semi finals were played in 1980 and 1981 to determine the two German Bowl contestants. From 1982, the play-offs were enlarged to include a quarter final round as well.

===Ansbach vs Düsseldorf era (1982–1986)===
The 1982 season, which saw Ansbach repeat its title, remaining unbeaten all season, this time against the Cologne Crocodiles, saw an increase of clubs to fifteen, including the two break-away clubs Düsseldorf and Bremerhaven. After that, the era of the Düsseldorf Panther versus Ansbach Grizzlies rivalry began, with the two teams meeting in the next four finals. Of those, the team from Düsseldorf won the 1983, 1984 and 1986 editions, while the Grizzlies earned their third championship in 1985. With the Panthers in 1983 and 1986 and the Grizzlies in 1985, both teams were able to win the title without a loss all season. With the 1986 final, the golden era of the Ansbach Grizzlies ended and the club disappeared out of the top level altogether by 1991.

===League expansion (1986–1990)===
From 1986, a wild card round was introduced in the play-offs, taking the number of teams in the play-offs to twelve. The league had now expanded to 24 teams, divided into four divisions. Two of those were in the north, one in the south and the fourth one in Central Germany.
The 1987 German Bowl saw two teams compete against each other that had thus far never reached the final, the Badener Greifs making their only appearance in the championship game to date, while the Berlin Adler won their first of, as of 2021, six national championships. Both teams went into the German Bowl without a defeat all season. In 1988, Red Barons Cologne defeated the Düsseldorf Panther in the final, while, from 1989 onwards, the Berlin Adler became the first team to win three championships in a row, all against teams from Cologne. The Adler also managed to remain unbeaten in 1989 and 1990 and only suffered one defeat in 1991, at home against the Cologne Crocodiles. After the 1990 season, the play-offs were reduced to eight teams again, dropping the wild card round, a system still in place as of 2022. The league, which had peaked at 26 clubs in four regional divisions in 1990, was reduced to the two-divisional format, with eight teams per division.

===Düsseldorf Panther era (1991–1996)===
The Panther earned their fourth title in 1992, defeating the Munich Cowboys, which, in the following year, won the championship themselves, against Cologne Crocodiles, who suffered their fourth defeat in their fourth German Bowl. Munich&#x27;s title in an undefeated 1993 season was to be the last occasion for the next twelve years that a team from the South would reach the final, and the last time until 2011, that a team from the South would win the championship. The &quot;Bundesliga&quot; and the German Bowl were from now on dominated by the North. After the 1993 season, still contested with 16 clubs, the number of clubs was gradually reduced further. In 1994, 14 clubs in two divisions of seven competed in the league, from 1995, the division strength was reduced to six. For the next 16 seasons, six teams per division was the set number, with occasional seasons going underway in reduced strength because of late withdrawals. Also, an inter conference round was introduced in 1994, with teams from different divisions now meeting for the first time during the regular season.

In 1994 and 1995, the Düsseldorf Panther once more won the German Bowl, with the second title won against a new force in the game in Germany, the Hamburg Blue Devils. In 1996, the Blue Devils then reversed the fortunes and defeated the Panthers in the final.

===Name change; rise of the Braunschweig Lions and rivalry with the Hamburg Blue Devils (1997–2008)===
In 1999 the competition adopted its present name and initials. The unusual decision to operate solely under an English language name and initials in its own country was made to try to prevent confusion among native German speakers between the GFL and the country&#x27;s more popular association football leagues.

The most dominant era of any team in German football begun in 1997, when the Braunschweig Lions reached and won the German Bowl for the first time. The Lions would play in every one of the next twelve German Bowls, up until 2008, and win seven of those. Their first title, in 1997, was won against the Cologne Crocodiles, who were now five for five in German Bowl defeats. The following six seasons, the final was contested by the Lions and the Blue Devils on five occasions, with the Lions winning in 1998 and 1999, while the Blue Devils won 2001, 2002, and 2003. Only in 2000 did neither of those two win the Bowl; instead, the Cologne Crocodiles finally reversed their fortunes and won a championship in their sixth attempt. In 1999, the &quot;Bundesliga&quot; was renamed to German Football League. In 2002, the league also lost its longest-serving founding member, the Munich Cowboys suffering relegation for the first time, alongside another one of the &quot;original six&quot;, the Düsseldorf Panther, who had however missed the 1980 and 1981 seasons because of the league split.

Braunschweig lost a fifth final in a row in 2004, when the Berlin Adler won their first title in 13 years. After this, the Braunschweig Lions set a new record, winning four German Bowls straight, beating four different teams in the finals. In 2005, the Blue Devils were once more the opposition, followed by two southern teams, the Marburg Mercenaries in 2006 and the Stuttgart Scorpions in 2007, in an unbeaten season for the Lions. The seventh title for the Lions came in 2008, against the new force of the Kiel Baltic Hurricanes. However, after 2008 Braunschweig&#x27;s dominance would end and the team would struggle to even post winning records, let alone come anywhere near championship contention until 2013.

===Interlude - Kiel dominant in the North (2009–2010)===
Kiel also played in the 2009 final, losing to the Berlin Adler, before finally being successful in 2010 and winning their first title against the same team.

===Rise of the Schwäbisch Hall Unicorns (2011–2019)===
In 2011, the season was expanded from 72 to 98 games because of the enlargement of the league to 14 teams. It also saw the end of an 18-year title drought for the south, when the Schwäbisch Hall Unicorns defeated Kiel 48–44 to take out the national championship for the first time. The Unicorns would miss only one out of the remaining German Bowls of the decade, when they were upset in the 2013 quarter finals by the Berlin Adler.

For the 2012 season, the Mönchengladbach Mavericks, runners-up in the northern division in 2011, were refused a license, leaving an extra spot in the league which was awarded to the Lübeck Cougars. The Schwäbisch Hall Unicorns repeated their 2011 success and once more defeated the Kiel Baltic Hurricanes in the German Bowl, becoming the first team from the south to win back-to-back championships since the 1982 Ansbach Grizzlies.

The 2013 season saw a return to northern dominance with all four southern teams knocked out in the quarter-finals and the German Bowl contested by the revived Braunschweig Lions, now as the New Yorker Lions, and the Dresden Monarchs who made their first appearance in the championship final, with the Lions winning their eighth German Bowl in a close 35–34 game with the only turnover coming with the last play when Dresden was driving down the field for a potentially game winning score.

The 2014 season began with the withdrawal of the Hamburg Blue Devils before the start of the season, leaving the northern division with only seven clubs. In the north Braunschweig won another division title with a perfect season while the Schwäbisch Hall Unicorns won the southern division for a fourth consecutive time (who then went on to beat Kiel and Dresden in the Playoffs to reach the final). The 2014 German Bowl was contested by the two division champions with Braunschweig taking out their ninth title with Schwäbisch Hall only scoring a Field Goal until the fourth quarter. The Lions won their ninth German Bowl victory with the highest-ever winning margin, defeating the Schwäbisch Hall Unicorns 47–9.

The 2015 season played out similar to the previous edition with both Schwäbisch Hall and Braunschweig winning their division before advancing to the final where Braunschweig prevailed once more, this time by a more narrow 41–31 margin.

2016 again saw Braunschweig and Hall win their divisions and meet in the German Bowl with Braunschweig achieving a &quot;championship three-peat&quot; beating the Unicorns 31–20 under Head Coach Troy Tomlin, one of the coaches to have won the German Bowl most often with his team.

In 2017 Hall and Braunschweig once more won their divisions and reached the German Bowl but this time the team from the South finally overcame their northern rival winning their third championship in a 14–13 nail biter that was decided by a blocked field goal attempt by Braunschweig late in the game. Despite losing the game, Braunschweig great David McCants was honored as the German Bowl MVP that year.

While Schwäbisch Hall and Braunschweig again won their divisions in 2018, the playoffs saw Braunschweig fall at home to the Frankfurt Universe in the semifinal by a score of 20–17 marking the first German Bowl contested by teams from the same division since 2013 and the first all southern German Bowl since 1981 (incidentally then also including a team representing Frankfurt, in that case the Frankfurter Löwen). In the end, the regular season division champ beat the runner up, just as had happened in 2013. Thus making German Bowl XL Hall&#x27;s third triumph.

In 2019 the Lions from Braunschweig managed to avenge their semifinal defeat the year prior beating Frankfurt at home on their way from yet another division title to yet another German Bowl triumph against the Unicorns, in the process thwarting Schwäbisch Hall&#x27;s attempt at their own &quot;championship three-peat&quot; and dealing the first defeat in the tenure of Head Coach Jordan Neumann who had taken over the job ahead of the 2017 season after the retirement of Schwäbisch Hall icon Siggi Gehrke who had coached the team for most of its existence and is mostly credited with the enduring success of the team. The final score in German Bowl XLI was Braunschweig 10, Schwäbisch Hall 7 making Braunschweig champions for the twelfth time in their history – more than any other team.

===Pandemic and competition by the newly founded ELF (2020–present)===
The 2020 season was delayed multiple times and ultimately cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic despite other European football leagues as well as other sports in Germany playing some form of 2020 season. The delays and ultimate cancellation caused some teams significant financial and organisational hardship as many costs – including salaries, transportation, and room &amp; board expense for import players – were incurred despite no games being played. Furthermore many players decided to – temporarily or permanently – leave their clubs (sometimes without ever actually playing for them) to play in those European leagues which did hold play. A very limited number of exhibition matches involving German teams were nonetheless held, but as they sometimes involved German teams with a much different roster than they would&#x27;ve had, had a &quot;normal&quot; 2020 season been played, it is impossible to gauge the &quot;actual&quot; competitive strength of any given 2020 GFL team, even if they did play.

The 2021 season was heavily influenced both by the lingering effects of COVID-19 – many teams were only allowed full contact team training much later in their preseason than usual – and the founding of the new European League of Football (ELF) which &quot;plundered&quot; the roster of GFL teams in Frankfurt and Stuttgart (sending the erstwhile playoff or even championship contenders to the bottom of their division) and led to the withdrawal of teams in Ingolstadt and Hildesheim after the attempts to move those teams to the new ELF fell through. The Elmshorn Fighting Pirates earned the questionable distinction of retiring from the GFL due to Covid and the competition by the ELF before ever having played a single GFL match. In the end, the GFL once more started &quot;understrength&quot; with a six team division in the North and an eight team division in the South rounded out by the utterly non-competitive Stuttgart Scorpions and Frankfurt Universe. As can perhaps be expected, the season was full of upsets and surprises despite top teams in Dresden, Schwäbisch Hall and Braunschweig largely keeping their roster intact. In their opening game, the Dresden Monarchs surprisingly lost to the Cologne Crocodiles despite the latter having lost a substantial number of players to the crosstown ELF Centurions. This, however, would prove the only loss of Dresden on the way to their first division title and the second German Bowl participation after 2013 as well as their first ever championship. Braunschweig meanwhile struggled and never achieved full team cohesion, in part due to relatively strict anti COVID-19 measures in the state of Lower Saxony preventing them from training together for much of the preseason and forcing them to hold their home opener in front of empty ranks. Ultimately placing fourth in the North, the Lions were eliminated in the quarter-final on the road in Schwäbisch Hall in a game in which the Unicorns defense won the ball off of Braunschweig turnovers five times. The great surprises of the season, Cologne Crocodiles and Saarland Hurricanes (the latter having been promoted ahead of the season) met in the quarter-finals in Saarland with Saarland advancing to the semifinals losing 37–0 in Dresden in Dresden&#x27;s last game at Heinz Steyer Stadion until at least 2023. The German Bowl thus sees the division champions meeting once more, but for the first time since 2012 that champion in the North is not Braunschweig. German Bowl XLII was played in Frankfurt am Main at the Waldstadion and saw the first ever title of a team from the New states of Germany in GFL history as the Dresden Monarchs defeated the Schwäbisch Hall Unicorns 28–19.
In German Bowl XLIII the Schwäbisch Hall Unicorns defeated the Potsdam Royals 44 to 27 to win their fifth championship.

==North–south disparity==
Success in American football in Germany and at the German Bowl differs hugely between the clubs from the northern and the southern division, with the south, as of 2021, only winning ten German Bowls (four of them won by the Schwäbisch Hall Unicorns) and the north the remaining 32 (12 of them won by the Braunschweig Lions). Similarly, southern clubs have only made 26 appearances in the Bowl, while northern clubs have appeared 58 times. After the first three German Bowls, the final was never again contested by two southern clubs until German Bowl XL in 2018. Between the end of the golden era of the Ansbach Grizzlies in 1986 and the rise of the Schwäbisch Hall Unicorns (who first reached the German Bowl in 2011), southern clubs only made five appearances in the championship game of which only one was successful (the Munich Cowboys in 1993). From 1993 to 2006 no southern team reached the German Bowl, with twelve consecutive finals played without southern participation. On five occasions no southern team progressed beyond the quarter-finals. In 1989, 1995, 1996, 1999 and 2013 all four semi-finalists came from the northern division. 2013 was perhaps the most drastic of these instances as the defending champion Schwäbisch Hall Unicorns were upset by the fourth seed in the North Berlin Adler on Hall&#x27;s own turf in the quarter-final.

The disparity is also documented by the inter conference games held from 1994 to 2011 between the northern and southern divisions. Of the 190 games played in this era, the north won 140, almost 75 percent, the south only 48 while two were drawn:

* Awarded games not counted.

==Restrictions on foreign players==
As a sign of the strong influence of Americans in the game in Germany, upon formation of the &quot;Bundesliga&quot; in 1979, there was no restriction on how many foreigners a team could field. The only stipulation was, that every team had to field a minimum of three German nationals at any time. Soon, this changed, and the allowed number of foreigners on the field for a team at any given time, in this case specifically, Americans, was reduced to five. In the early years American players would simply be recruited from the (then plentiful) American military installations in Germany which in part helps explain the early dominance of Frankfurt (near Rhein-Main Air Base) and Ansbach (site of several US armed forces facilities). However, with the drawdown of US forces in the mid-1980s and the increase in talent and professionalism throughout the league, a more formalized mechanism was put in place to recruit and fly in former college football players to play in Germany for pay (salary) as well as room and board.

In 1982, the number of American &quot;imports&quot; was reduced to four, in 1983 to three and, by 1986 only two were allowed on the field for a team at any given time.

In November 2010, a new &quot;Bundesspielordnung&quot;, the rule book of American football in Germany, was published. One major change was that the sport now placed citizens of European Union countries on equal footing with German nationals, meaning, restrictions on the number of these players per team on the field were now not in place anymore. However, the restrictions on non-EU nationals remained in place, unless those players could prove that they had spent at least three years playing for a youth team in the sport in Germany. This was an update in part mandated by the Bosman ruling (which established a precedent for association football but applies to all professional sports) and the rules on Freedom of movement for workers in the European Union.

For the 2011 season, a club can sign up up to ten non-EU players, have six of those on the line-up for any given game but only two of those on the field at any given time. Players are marked with an &quot;A&quot; on their jersey and helmet to allow referees to determine at a glance whether the limit is obeyed on the field. These restrictions are specifically in place for US, Canadian, Mexican and Japanese citizens and, on request, exemptions can be made for players from countries without established structures in the sport. This rule is designed to prevent an advantage to the wealthier clubs, who could otherwise recruit a large number of players from the traditional American football countries. However, the aforementioned inevitable exception for EU citizens provides a strong incentive to sign players with dual nationality who have played college football but do not count as &quot;Americans&quot;. In some cases the clubs have even encouraged or helped their players to get the citizenship of an EU country when they are eligible through ius sanguinis or residence. In other European leagues similar limits are implemented by other means. For example, the Austrian Football League limits the number of players who can receive financial compensation for playing while the Italian Football League limits the number of players who have played college football (regardless of citizenship). As such, the same player playing in two different leagues in the same year may be considered an &quot;import&quot; in one league and equivalent to a national player in another. Reilly Hennessey, who has dual Italian and US citizenship, had to wear an &quot;A&quot; on his jersey in the 2021 season of the Italian Football League due to having played college football at Central Washington University but was not subject to this limitation in German Bowl XLII when he played for the Schwäbisch Hall Unicorns later that same year.

===South===

* In 2000, the northern division consisted of only five clubs.
* In 2004 and 2005, the southern division consisted of only five clubs.

<doc id="745270" wikidata="Q1760539" url="?curid=745270" title="Saint Louis Art Museum">
<text>The Saint Louis Art Museum (SLAM) is an art museum located in St. Louis, Missouri, United States. With paintings, sculptures, cultural objects, and ancient masterpieces from around the world, its three-story building stands in Forest Park in St. Louis, Missouri, where it is visited by up to a half million people every year. Admission is free through a subsidy from the cultural tax district for St. Louis City and County.

In addition to the featured exhibitions, the museum offers rotating exhibitions and installations. These include the &quot;Currents&quot; series, which features contemporary artists, as well as regular exhibitions of new media art and works on paper.

==History==

The museum&#x27;s origins date to 1879, when the Saint Louis School and Museum of Fine Arts was founded as part of Washington University. The nascent museum was housed in a building Wayman Crow commissioned of Boston architects Peabody and Stearns as a memorial to his son, Wayman Crow Jr. The structure was located at 19th and Lucas Place (now Locust Street). The school, led by director Halsey Ives, offered studio and art history instruction supported by a museum collection.

When the 1904 Louisiana Purchase Exposition closed, the museum and school moved from the Peabody-Stearns structure to Cass Gilbert&#x27;s Palace of Fine Arts building. The building at 19th and Lucas Place rapidly fell into disrepair, and was eventually demolished in 1919.

After the relocation, Director Ives introduced a bill into the General Assembly for an art tax to support museum maintenance. The citizens of Saint Louis approved the bill by a nearly 4-to-1 margin; however, the city&#x27;s controller refused to distribute the tax as the museum was not recognized as a municipal entity and thus had no right to tax money. The Missouri Supreme Court upheld this decision in 1908. This caused the formal separation of the museum from the university in 1909, a split which was the beginning of three civic institutions:

* a newly created, public City Art Museum, to remain in the Palace of Fine Arts, the organization which evolved into the Saint Louis Art Museum; an organizing board was assigned to take control in 1912.
* the Mildred Lane Kemper Art Museum affiliated with the private Washington University, whose collection was lent to the City Art Museum for several years, and now part of the Sam Fox School of Design &amp; Visual Arts
* the St. Louis School of Fine Arts, also part of Washington University. In 1905 Ives had been immediately succeeded as director by Edmund H. Wuerpel; as of September 1909 Wuerpel advertised classes at Skinker and Lindell. Wuerpel remained director until his retirement in 1939. The school is now also part of the Sam Fox School of Design &amp; Visual Arts.

During the 1950s, the museum added an extension to include an auditorium for films, concerts, and lectures. Director Charles Guggenheim&#x27;s American Museum&quot; (1959) debuted in the new auditorium space as a 50th anniversary event.

In 1971, efforts to secure the museum&#x27;s financial future led voters in St. Louis City and County to approve the creation of the Metropolitan Zoological Park and Museum District (ZMD). This expanded the tax base for the 1908 tax to include St. Louis County. In 1972, the museum was again renamed, to the Saint Louis Art Museum.

Today, the museum is supported financially by the tax, donations from individuals and public associations, sales in the Museum Shop, and foundation support.

===Expansion===

Plans to expand the museum, which existed in the 1995 Forest Park Master Plan and the museum&#x27;s 2000 Strategic Plan, began in earnest in 2005, when the museum board selected the British architect Sir David Chipperfield to design the expansion; Michel Desvigne was selected as landscape architect. The St. Louis-based firm, Hellmuth, Obata, and Kassabaum (HOK) was the architect of record to work with the construction team.

On November 5, 2007, museum officials released the design plans to the public and hosted public conversations about those plans. A model of the new building was displayed in the museum&#x27;s Sculpture Hall throughout the construction project. In 2008, citing the declining state of the economy, the museum announced that it would delay the start of the expansion, whose cost was then estimated at $125 million.

Construction began in 2009; the museum remained open. The expansion added more than of gallery space, including an underground garage, within the lease lines of the property. Money for the project was raised through private gifts to the capital campaign from individuals, foundations and corporations, and from proceeds from the sale of tax-exempt bonds. The fundraising campaigned covered the $130-million cost of construction and a $31.2 million increase to the museum&#x27;s endowment to support incremental costs of operating the larger facility. The expanded facility opened in the summer of 2013.

==Collection==
The collection of the Saint Louis Art Museum contains more than 34,000 objects dating from antiquity to the present. The collection is divided into nine areas:

:# American
:# Ancient and Egyptian
:# Africa, Oceania, Americas
:# Asian
:# Decorative Arts and Design
:# European to 1800
:# Islamic
:# Modern and Contemporary
:# Prints, Drawings, and Photographs

The modern art collection includes works by the European masters Matisse, Gauguin, Monet, Picasso, Corrado Giaquinto, Giambattista Pittoni and Van Gogh. The museum&#x27;s particularly strong collection of 20th-century German paintings includes the world&#x27;s largest Max Beckmann collection, which includes &quot;Christ and the Woman Taken in Adultery&quot;. In recent years, the museum has been actively acquiring post-war German art to complement its Beckmanns, such as works by Joseph Beuys, Gerhard Richter, Martin Kippenberger, Sigmar Polke, and Anselm Kiefer. The collection also includes Chuck Close&#x27;s &quot;Keith&quot; (1970).

The collections of Oceanic and Mesoamerican works, as well as handwoven Turkish rugs, are among the finest in the world. The museum holds the Egyptian mummy &quot;Amen-Nestawy-Nakht&quot;, and two mummies on loan from Washington University, Padi-menekh and Henut-wedjebu. Its collection of American artists includes the largest U.S.-museum collection of paintings by George Caleb Bingham.

The collection contains at least six pieces that Nazis confiscated from their own museums as degenerate. These include Max Beckmann&#x27;s &quot;Christ and the Woman Taken in Adultery&quot; which came to the museum through a New York art dealer, Curt Valentin, who specialized in Nazi confiscations, and Matisse&#x27;s &quot;Bathers with a Turtle&quot; which Joseph Pulitzer purchased at the Galerie Fischer auction held in the Grand Hôtel National, Lucerne, Switzerland, June 30, 1939.

In the context of the museum&#x27;s 2013 expansion, British artist Andy Goldsworthy created &quot;Stone Sea&quot;, a site-specific work for a narrow space between the old and new buildings. Twenty-five tightly packed, ten-foot-high arches made of native limestone rise in a sunken courtyard. The artist was inspired by the fact that the sedimentary rock was formed when the region was a shallow sea in Prehistoric times.

In 2021, the museum received a promised gift of 22 paintings and sculptures from the collection of the American curator and philanthropist Emily Rauh Pulitzer, the widow of the media heir Joseph Pulitzer Jr. The donation includes works by 17 European and American artists, including Pablo Picasso, Georges Braque, Constantin Brâncuși, Joan Miró, Philip Guston, Ellsworth Kelly and others.

<doc id="745283" wikidata="Q1777382" url="?curid=745283" title="Shlomo (beatboxer)">
<text>Simon Shlomo Kahn (born 1983), known professionally as SK Shlomo and previously as Shlomo, is a British singer-songwriter, beatboxer, music producer and live looping technologist.

==Background==
SK Shlomo is of Jewish descent, with Israeli, Iraqi and German lineage. They grew up in the village of Bourne End, Buckinghamshire. They are a classically trained percussionist and a jazz drummer, learning the drums from the age of eight and playing classical percussion in youth orchestras. Their father is a jazz guitarist. They began making vocal rhythms as a child as a way to practice their drums, and in their teens discovered that others practiced the art of human beatboxing. In 2003 they left the Physics with Astrophysics degree course at Leeds University to pursue their music full-time.

==Career==
SK Shlomo first began performing as a beatboxer in 2002 when they became the champion at the King of the Jam beatboxing tournament in London, winning a pot of Bonne Maman jam. They became known for their original beatboxing techniques including their 2-mic trancebox routine which they debuted at the World Beatbox Convention in 2003.

They first came to broader attention in 2004 when they collaborated with Björk on her all vocal song &quot;Oceania&quot;, which Björk later performed at the opening ceremony of the Athens of the 2004 Summer Olympics. The song &quot;Oceania&quot; was commissioned by the Olympic Games Committee and heard by an estimated 3.9 billion people around the world making SK Shlomo one of the most-heard beatboxers in history (although most would not have realised that the drum sounds were vocal). The performance was nominated for a Grammy Award. They began touring the UK, Europe and Canada with London hip hop act Foreign Beggars, before making a solo appearance on &quot;Later... with Jools Holland&quot; in late 2005. Following a performance at London&#x27;s Queen Elizabeth Hall concert hall, they became Artist in Residence at Southbank Centre in 2007.

As part of their residency at Southbank Centre, SK Shlomo curated and performed in a collaborative concert series &quot;Music Through Unconventional Means&quot; from 2007 to 2010 which featured a diverse range of artists including Martha Wainwright, Teddy Thompson, DJ Yoda and Jarvis Cocker.

In 2015 SK Shlomo was named a BBC Music Ambassador alongside singers Tom Jones, Rae Morris, Jamie Cullum and George Ezra, producer Mark Ronson, and conductor Charles Hazlewood

===The Vocal Orchestra===
In 2007, they put together the world&#x27;s first beatboxing choir, the Vocal Orchestra, to headline at the International Beatbox Convention. The original group consisted of a cappella ensemble The Swingle Singers alongside beatboxers MC Zani, Bellatrix and Neil Thomas. The group was created in 6 weeks, with their debut performance selling out before the group had even met. The process was recorded by filmmaker Colette McWilliams. Her documentary, &quot;The Beatbox Choir&quot;, was awarded Best Documentary at the OS International Film Festival, and included in the official selection at the D Reel International Film Festival, Australia. In 2012 the film was made freely available on SK Shlomo&#x27;s website. After the initial process in 2007, SK Shlomo adapted the line-up of the Vocal Orchestra to comprise eight people to tour at festivals.

===Music festivals===
SK Shlomo has performed at festivals including Montreux Jazz Festival, Glastonbury, Bestival, Wilderness Festival and Lovebox. At The Big Chill festival they appeared as a guest of Nightmares on Wax in 2006, with their Vocal Orchestra in 2007, as a guest of the Mighty Boosh in 2008, as a collaborator with Hexstatic in 2009, and as a solo performer in 2010.

SK Shlomo has performed at every Glastonbury Festival since 2005. At Glastonbury in 2007, SK Shlomo performed as part of Africa Express and beatboxed on a live version of &quot;A Message to You, Rudy&quot; accompanying Terry Hall and Lynval Golding from The Specials with Damon Albarn on piano. Emily Eavis then invited SK Shlomo to return to Glastonbury in 2008 to curate and perform in a special 2-hour &quot;Music Through Unconventional Means&quot; set, with a host of guests including Martha Wainwright, Ed Harcourt, DJ Yoda, Reverend and the Makers, Portico Quartet, Lemn Sissay, and Martina Topley Bird.

At the 2009 Latitude Festival they collaborated with Jarvis Cocker as part of the Cape Farewell presentation, performing &quot;Purple Haze&quot;. At Glastonbury in 2009 and 2010 they collaborated with vocal artist Imogen Heap and in 2011 with Ed Sheeran and Abandoman. In 2015 they created a Glastonbury drumming record with their guests Lily Allen and Rudimental. In 2015 SK Shlomo closed the Wilderness Festival with their Vocal Orchestra, the 50 strong Wilderness Orchestra and a 200 strong choir embedded in the audience.

===Work in education and charity work===
SK Shlomo founded the first Beatbox Academy in South London, teaches and speaks at educational conferences around the world, and continues to tour their acclaimed shows for kids.

In 2008, SK Shlomo co-founded a programme teaching beatboxing to young people called the Beatbox Academy with Battersea Arts Centre. They developed a series of free learning resources in association with Musical Futures which they published on their website.

They hosted a Concert Against Knife Crime in 2008 at the Queen Elizabeth Hall in an attempt to raise awareness of the benefits of working creatively with young people. Musical guests at the concert included Jarvis Cocker, Mutya Buena, Ashley Walters and Teddy Thompson. In 2008, they were commissioned to create a piece called &quot;One Voice&quot;, bringing together four community choirs from diverse backgrounds including a Gospel Choir, a Brazilian Choir, a children&#x27;s choir and a contemporary choir. The following year, they worked with BBC Blast to promote beatboxing to young people in a series of short films.

In April 2009 they created Urban Vani, a community project bringing together beatboxing and South Asian Dance. In 2012, they created a new Indian beatboxing orchestra called &quot;Voctronica&quot; in collaboration with the British Council.

SK Shlomo&#x27;s charity work includes hosting blindfolded gigs for RLSB with Imogen Heap and Basement Jaxx, and regular collaborations with Cape Farewell, a climate change awareness charity. In 2005 they worked with the Ubuntu Educational Fund to raise money for orphaned and vulnerable children in South Africa. They have also made two charity collaborative albums with the proceeds going to War Child and Médecins Sans Frontières respectively.

===Concerto for Beatboxer and Orchestra===
In 2010 SK Shlomo performed the premiere of the &quot;Concerto for Beatboxer and Orchestra&quot; by Anna Meredith, an acclaimed contemporary composer who had risen to critical acclaim after composing a piece for the Last Night of the Proms. The Concerto was commissioned by Southbank Centre and was the first fully developed orchestral work to feature a beatboxer as the soloist, as well as 5 more beatboxers embedded in the 21 piece orchestra. Anna Meredith and SK Shlomo spent 2 years developing a notation system to create the score, which SK Shlomo then made available for free via their website.

===World Loopstation championships===
SK Shlomo incorporates a loop pedal into their solo performances to perform more complex original compositions and covers. In October 2010, they entered the UK heats of the World Loopstation Championships and became the UK Champion. They then flew to Los Angeles in January 2011 and was awarded the title of World Loopstation Champion by the judges Dave Navarro, Steve Stevens and Dub FX.

Since become World Loopstation Champion, they have been in demand as an authority on technology and creativity. They have spoken at international events including TEDx, CDI in Mexico, ITV’s Big Think, Roundhouse Rising, Music Tech Fest, MGX (Microsoft USA) and WIRED2014.

===Theatrical work and the Edinburgh Fringe===
In 2011 SK Shlomo toured their first one-person theatrical show &quot;Mouthtronica&quot; which explored SK Shlomo&#x27;s Iraqi-Jewish background and the story of how they became a beatboxer. In each performance, SK Shlomo improvised a spontaneous collaboration with a local guest artist, which were sourced via Twitter and Facebook. The collaborations were recorded for an improvised charity album which raised over £500 for medical charity Doctors Without Borders. After the initial 22 date UK tour, SK Shlomo took Mouthtronica to the Edinburgh Fringe Festival where the show received several five star reviews, was nominated for the Holden Street Theatres&#x27; Edinburgh Fringe Award and sold out for the entire four-week run. While they were in Edinburgh, SK Shlomo performed a collaboration with singer James Morrison for BBC Radio 1 and worked with their childhood hero Michael Winslow to create a special one-off show called &quot;Old Skool meets New Skool&quot;.

SK Shlomo&#x27;s theatrical work includes 3 full length one-person theatre shows, all of which have sold out at the Edinburgh Fringe Festival and toured the UK. They also created and directed a stage show entitled The Vocal Orchestra which for ran for at London&#x27;s Southbank, Edinburgh Fringe and continues to tour internationally.

===Guinness World records===
SK Shlomo has twice held the record for the World&#x27;s Largest Beatbox Ensemble, and is the current holder for directing a group of 2,081 Google employees at the Dublin Convention Centre in November 2011.

===Work as a composer===
SK Shlomo is often commissioned to write for choirs, stage shows, films and adverts. Recent works include a score for the BFI&#x27;s restoration of Alfred Hitchcock&#x27;s Downhill, a specially commissioned piece for the Royal Festival Hall&#x27;s organ and a nomination for the British Composer Awards for their piece for the National Youth Choir.

<doc id="745291" wikidata="Q421076" url="?curid=745291" title="Tacrine">
<text>Tacrine is a centrally acting acetylcholinesterase inhibitor and indirect cholinergic agonist (parasympathomimetic). It was the first centrally acting cholinesterase inhibitor approved for the treatment of Alzheimer&#x27;s disease, and was marketed under the trade name Cognex. Tacrine was first synthesised by Adrien Albert at the University of Sydney in 1949. It also acts as a histamine N-methyltransferase inhibitor.

==Clinical use==
Tacrine was the prototypical cholinesterase inhibitor for the treatment of Alzheimer&#x27;s disease. William K. Summers received a patent for this use in 1989. Studies found that it may have a small beneficial effect on cognition and other clinical measures, though study data was limited and the clinical relevance of these findings was unclear.

Tacrine has been discontinued in the US in 2013, due to concerns over safety.

Tacrine was also described as an analeptic agent used to promote mental alertness.

==Adverse effects==
;Very common (&gt;10% incidence) adverse effects include

* Increased liver function tests (LFT), with 49% of patients displaying elevated ALA
* Diarrhea
* Dizziness
* Headache
* Nausea
* Vomiting
;Common (1-10% incidence) adverse effects include

* Abdominal pain
* Agitation
* Anxiety
* Ataxia — decreased control over bodily movements.
* Belching
* Confusion
* Conjunctivitis (a link to tacrine treatment has not been conclusively proven)
* Constipation
* Diaphoresis — sweating.
* Fatigue
* Hallucinations
* Indigestion
* Insomnia
* Myalgia — muscle pain
* Rash
* Rhinitis
* Somnolence
* Tremor
* Urinary incontinence
* Weight loss
;Uncommon/rare (&lt;1% incidence) adverse effects include

* Agranulocytosis (a link between treatment and this adverse effect has not been proven) — a potentially fatal drop in white blood cells, the body&#x27;s immune/defensive cells. 
* Hepatotoxicity (&quot;that is&quot; toxic effects on the liver)
* Ototoxicity (hearing/ear damage; a link to tacrine treatment has not been conclusively proven)
* Seizures
* Taste changes
;Unknown incidence adverse effects include

* Bradycardia

=== Overdose ===
As stated above, overdosage of tacrine may give rise to severe side effects such as nausea, vomiting, salivation, sweating, bradycardia, hypotension, collapse, and convulsions. Atropine is a popular treatment for overdose.

==Pharmacokinetics==
Major form of metabolism is in the liver via hydroxylation of benzylic carbon by CYP1A2. This forms the major metabolite 1-hydroxy-tacrine (velnacrine) which is still active.

<doc id="745301" wikidata="Q5318121" url="?curid=745301" title="Dwight Chapin">
<text>Dwight Lee Chapin (born December 2, 1940) is an American political organizer, businessman and retired public servant. He was Deputy Assistant to President of the United States Richard Nixon during the Watergate scandal. Chapin was convicted of lying to a grand jury (perjury) during the scandal and served nine months at the Federal Correctional Institution, Lompoc.

==Early life==
Chapin was born in Wichita, Kansas. He got his first experience in California politics in 1958 at the American Legion&#x27;s Boys State summer program, where he was elected the head of the Tory Party. His counterpart, the Whig Party leader, was Stacy Keach, who went into acting as a career. Chapin graduated in 1963 from the University of Southern California, where he was a member of Sigma Chi fraternity. At USC, he was a member of Trojans for Representative Government with future Watergate scandal participants Tim Elbourne, Donald Segretti, Gordon C. Strachan, Herbert Porter, and Ron Ziegler.

==Early political career==
When Nixon ran for California Governor in 1962, Chapin, then still at USC, was a paid Field Man (on-the-ground organizational leader for election campaigns) and worked with the volunteer organization. After the 1962 campaign, he was hired by H. R. Haldeman to work at the J. Walter Thompson Company, an advertising firm, in Los Angeles.

Chapin was part of Nixon&#x27;s presidential campaign from 1967 to 1968, serving as Nixon&#x27;s personal aide. &quot;Time&quot; described him as &quot;young, athletic, religious, handsome, clean-cut, bright, ambitious, and tough.&quot;

==Nixon&#x27;s White House Staff==

He was Special Assistant to the President (1969–1971), and then Deputy Assistant (1971–1973). He was the appointments secretary, responsible for scheduling presidential activities, appointments, and travel. In addition, Chapin was in charge of the White House television office. Chapin also oversaw the hiring and the supervising of presidential advance men, and headed that group to prepare for Nixon&#x27;s second trip to the People&#x27;s Republic of China (P.R.C.) in February 1972 (after the first trip to Japan in 1969). In 1973, Chapin was named one of the Ten Outstanding Young Men of the year by the United States Junior Chamber (Jaycees) for his work on the historic China trips (after Japan trips). Even Chinese government were both impressed with Chapin&#x27;s skill at detail work, singling him out publicly in Beijing meetings: &quot;You are an example of how we should utilize young men in government.&quot;

==Watergate Scandal==
It was during this time Chapin hired Donald Segretti, his former colleague from USC, to disrupt the campaigns of Democratic presidential hopefuls during the 1972 presidential primary season through acts of political &quot;sabotage&quot; - known as the &quot;dirty tricks&quot; campaign. Chapin was asked to find a &quot;Dick Tuck&quot; (a legendary Democratic political saboteur) type of prankster to perform the &quot;dirty tricks&quot; to work under H. R. Haldeman, Nixon&#x27;s Chief of Staff, and the President.

Segretti later testified before a Watergate grand jury about the activities, including Chapin&#x27;s supervisory role. Chapin denied any detailed knowledge of Segretti or actions that Segretti undertook during grand jury testimony. Segretti testified, &quot;When Dwight hired me he made it clear he was hiring me because I was a lawyer and would know what was legal and what was not.&quot; Chapin was never indicted for any of Segretti&#x27;s activities. Chapin resigned to work as an executive for United Airlines but was drawn back into the swirl of Watergate legal proceedings.

==Imprisonment==
In a 1974 jury trial, Chapin was convicted of making false material declarations before a grand jury and was imprisoned in the federal corrections camp at Lompoc, California (so-called &quot;Camp Cupcake&quot;) from August 1975 to April 1976. Despite the relatively minor repercussions he remained indignant, initially vowing to appeal &quot;all the way to the Supreme Court&quot; (which he did) in a very hostile political climate. It was later revealed that he was earning $1,000 per week while in prison, on the payroll of W. Clement Stone Enterprises.

==After Watergate Scandal and Nixon&#x27;s resignation==
After his release from prison, Chapin re-entered the private sector and worked at W. Clement Stone Enterprises in Chicago. From 1977 to 1984, he published a magazine called &quot;Success Unlimited&quot;. Chapin then worked for the international public relations firm Hill &amp; Knowlton in Chicago. Later, Chapin had assignments in Geneva, Switzerland, Tokyo, Japan and Hong Kong, where he was managing director, Asia, for Hill &amp; Knowlton.

In 1986, Chapin started Chapin Enterprises. The firm provided consulting services to many prestigious companies and associations. Chapin remained involved in politics and in 1980 worked for Ronald Reagan&#x27;s election as president. In 1988, he held a position in the George H. W. Bush presidential campaign.

Chapin has maintained an active interest in politics and he is now a business consultant and mentor/coach in East Hampton, New York.. In 2022, he published a memoir titled &quot;The President&#x27;s Man&quot;.

<text>The Kaoss Pad is a sampler and audio effects processor launched by Korg in 1999. It allows users to record and process audio and apply various effects using an X-Y touchscreen. It has been used by artists including Radiohead, Muse and Brian Eno.

== Features ==
The Kaoss Pad allows users to sample and loop audio and apply effects such as pitch-bending, flange, distortion, and delay using a touchscreen. According to the &quot;Guardian,&quot; while its effects technology was not new, the Kaoss Pad was distinguished by its intuitive design: &quot;Anyone can pick one up and in a matter of seconds get the hang of it.&quot; 

The British producer and musician Brian Eno, an early adopter of the Kaoss Pad, described it as &quot;a way of taking sounds into the domain of muscular control&quot; as opposed to working with computers: &quot;It takes you into a completely different place, because when working with computers you normally don&#x27;t use your muscles in that way.&quot;

== Users ==
Radiohead use a Kaoss Pad on performances of their 2000 song &quot;Everything In Its Right Place&quot; to manipulate Thom Yorke&#x27;s vocals into a &quot;glitching, stuttering collage&quot;. Matt Bellamy of Muse, described by the &quot;Guardian&quot; as &quot;undoubtedly the Kaoss rock star&quot;, uses touchscreen MIDI controllers built into his guitars to control Kaoss Pads. Other users include Brian Eno, the singer Bryan Ferry and the beatboxer Beardyman.

<doc id="745311" wikidata="Q5158984" url="?curid=745311" title="Concordia Senior College">
<text>Concordia Senior College was a liberal arts college located in Fort Wayne, Indiana, and affiliated with the Lutheran Church–Missouri Synod (LCMS). It was founded in 1957 and closed in 1977.

The senior college was a new type of institution for the LCMS. It provided future pastors with training before they attended a seminary, during their third and fourth undergraduate years of college. Concordia Senior College was by-and-large an all-men&#x27;s institution with no female faculty, although there were a small number of female students who were housed in a separate dormitory.

In 1977, the function of Concordia Senior College was transferred to other LCMS colleges, the Concordia University System. Today those colleges are responsible for much of the undergraduate training of future LCMS pastors. The campus became the home of the Concordia Theological Seminary as that institution relocated from Springfield, Illinois.

== Athletics ==
The Concordia Senior College&#x27;s athletic teams were called the Saxons (named for the Lutheran immigrants from Saxony to Missouri in the late 1830s who then helped form the LCMS).

<doc id="745316" wikidata="Q4352952" url="?curid=745316" title="Echothiophate">
<text>Echothiophate (Phospholine) is an irreversible acetylcholinesterase inhibitor.

== Uses ==

It is used as an ocular antihypertensive in the treatment of open angle glaucoma and, in some cases, accommodative esotropia. It is available under several trade names such as Phospholine Iodide (Wyeth-Ayerst).

Echothiophate binds irreversibly to cholinesterase. Because of the very slow rate at which echothiophate is hydrolyzed by cholinesterase, its effects can last a week or more. Adverse effects include muscle spasm and other systemic effects.

== Mechanism of action ==

It covalently binds by its phosphate group to serine group at the active site of the cholinesterase. Once bound, the enzyme is permanently inactive and the cell has to make new enzymes.

== Shortage ==

Wyeth Pharmaceuticals stopped manufacturing echothiophate iodide in the US in 2003. After contacting the American Academy of Ophthalmology (AAO), Wyeth rescinded their decision and, according to AAO public relations representative Michelle Stephens, the AAO and Wyeth were in talks for about a year about manufacturing it.

In the meantime, a worldwide shortage of the drug has occurred.

==Chemistry==
Echothiophate is made by reacting diethylchlorophosphoric acid with 2-dimethylaminoethylmercaptan, giving &quot;S&quot;-(2-dimethylaminoethyl)-&quot;O&quot;,&quot;O&quot;-diethylthiophosphate, which is alkylated by methyl iodide, forming echothiophate.

<doc id="745318" wikidata="Q4874054" url="?curid=745318" title="Bay Park Square">
<text>Bay Park Square is a shopping mall owned by Simon Property Group, in the Green Bay, Wisconsin suburb of Ashwaubenon, in the United States. The mall opened in 1980 under the ownership of DeBartolo Corporation. Bay Park Square is located one mile (1.6 km) away from Lambeau Field on South Oneida Street (County Trunk Highway AAA).

The mall&#x27;s anchors are Kohl&#x27;s, Dave &amp; Buster&#x27;s, Marcus Cinemas, Steinhafels and Hy-Vee.

The mall also has an American football stadium-themed food court, known as the &quot;Supper Bowl&quot;.

==History==
Montgomery Ward announced plans for a new $10 million store and adjacent shopping mall in the town of Ashwaubenon, Wisconsin in 1969, which would replace their downtown Green Bay store. The mall was originally intended to open in 1971. Montgomery Ward hired E.D. Pehrson Associates of Chicago as developer. After delays, the Montgomery Ward store opened in 1972.

After the project stalled again in the mid-1970s, the Edward J. DeBartolo Corp. was brought in by Montgomery Ward as the new developer. By this time, the mall project was increased to . In 1979, Shopko was announced as the second anchor store of the new mall. Construction on the mall began in 1979, and the mall opened in 1980.

In 1981, the mall was expanded, adding an east wing and a Kohl&#x27;s Department Store. The project added of space to the mall.

In 1995, the mall underwent a major renovation, remodeling much of the interior of the mall. A new west wing was added, which included a food court taking up the former Marcus Theatres space and a new Elder-Beerman department store as the fourth anchor, which replaced the mall&#x27;s main entrance. The mall then added two new angled entrances, one that went through to the new food court, and another that went through to the mall walkway running parallel to the side of the new Elder-Beerman department store. Marcus Theatres built a new 16-screen movie theater on an outlot of the mall behind ShopKo. A addition was made to the Kohl&#x27;s store at the same time.

Simon Property Group acquired Bay Park Square when they merged with the mall&#x27;s owners, the DeBartolo Corporation.

Montgomery Ward closed in 2001. In 2003, the south wing was expanded and a new Younkers department store was built. Elder-Beerman closed in 2007 following their acquisition by Younkers&#x27; parent company, The Bon-Ton. A Younkers Furniture Gallery later replaced the Elder-Beerman store. Both stores closed in mid-2018 due to Bon-Ton&#x27;s bankruptcy and the entire chain going out of business. Shopko would meet the same fate on June 16, 2019, when the last of its stores, including the Bay Park Square store, closed (its corporate headquarters was located directly across from the mall and remains vacant).

In 2019, a plan was announced to have Dave &amp; Buster&#x27;s occupy the former Younkers Furniture space. Panda Express, Blaze Pizza and Mission BBQ also announced plans to build in outlets on the mall property.

Dave &amp; Buster&#x27;s opened in January 2021 after a delayed opening due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Panda Express opened in late 2020 in the parking lot of Dave &amp; Buster&#x27;s. Waukesha-based Steinhafels Furniture opened in the former Younkers space in early April 2022, with a portion of its southeast side subdivided into a future store space. Chick-fil-A opened its first northeastern Wisconsin location in the front of the mall near Dave &amp; Busters in March 2022. Supermarket chain Hy-Vee opened its largest store in the former Shopko space on November 8, 2022; it does not have an entrance in the actual mall.

<doc id="745321" wikidata="Q13320" url="?curid=745321" title="Savona">
<text>Savona (; ) is a seaport and (municipality) in the west part of the northern Italian region of Liguria, and the capital of the Province of Savona. Facing the Ligurian Sea, Savona is the main center of the Riviera di Ponente (the western section of the Italian Riviera).

One of the most celebrated former inhabitants of Savona was the navigator Christopher Columbus, who farmed land in the area while chronicling his journeys. &#x27;Columbus&#x27;s house&#x27;, a cottage situated in the Savona hills, lay between vegetable crops and fruit trees. It is one of several residences in Liguria associated with Columbus.

==History==

Inhabited in ancient times by Ligures tribes, it came under Roman influence in 180 BC, after the Punic wars in which the city had been allied to Carthage. After the fall of the Western Roman Empire, it passed under Lombard rule in 641 AD (being destroyed in the attack), after a short period as an Ostrogoth and then Byzantine possession. Later it recovered as a county seat in the Carolingian Empire. In the 10th century its bishops were Counts of Savona, but later the countship passed to the Marquesses of Montferrat (981) and afterwards to the Marquesses (1084).

After a long struggle against the Saracens, Savona acquired independence in the 11th century, becoming a free municipality allied with the Holy Roman Emperor (similar to a free imperial city). Savona was the center of religious culture (13th to 16th centuries) due to the work of two important monasteries: Dominican and Franciscan. Subsequently, it fought against the Republic of Genoa before being definitively conquered in 1528. The Genoese destroyed the upper town and buried the port. It then shared the fortunes of the Republic of Genoa until Napoleonic times. In 1809 the city received Pope Pius VII, prisoner of Napoleon Bonaparte, for a few years. Between April and mid-May 1800, Austrian forces besieged the city while a small British naval force maintained a blockade; the fortress surrendered on 15 May. Subsequently, Savona was annexed to the Kingdom of Sardinia-Piedmont (1815). Eventually, it became part of the unified Kingdom of Italy, now a republic.

During the 20th century Savona became a regional industrial hub.

==Main sights==

The construction was commissioned by Giovanni D&#x27;Aria and his brother Michele. The chapel is architecturally similar to the chapel dedicated to the Cardinal Pietro Riario in the Basilica of the Santi Apostoli, Rome. After years of deterioration, in 1765–1767 a reconstruction was ordered by the Genovese Doge Francesco Maria Della Rovere. This updated the chapel in a Rococo style, with ceiling painted by Paolo Gerolamo Brusco. The cathedral has a noteworthy 16th-century carved wooden choir seats.

<doc id="745324" wikidata="Q186581" url="?curid=745324" title="Jochi">
<text>Jochi (; ), also spelled Jüchi, was a prince of the early Mongol Empire. His life was marked by controversy over the circumstances of his birth and culminated in his estrangement from his family. He was nevertheless a prominent military commander and the progenitor of the family who ruled over the khanate of the Golden Horde.

Jochi was the son of Börte, the first wife of the Mongol leader Temüjin. For many months before Jochi&#x27;s birth, Börte had been a captive of the Merkit tribe, one of whom forcibly married and raped her. Although there was thus considerable doubt over Jochi&#x27;s parentage, Temüjin considered him his son and treated him accordingly. Many Mongols, most prominently Börte&#x27;s next son Chagatai, disagreed; these tensions eventually led to both Chagatai and Jochi being excluded from the line of succession to the Mongol throne.

After Temüjin founded the Mongol Empire in 1206 and took the name Genghis Khan, he entrusted Jochi with nine thousand warriors and a large territory in the west of the Mongol heartland; Jochi commanded and participated in numerous campaigns to secure and extend Mongol power in the region. He was also a prominent commander during the invasion of the Khwarazmian Empire (1219–1221), during which he subdued cities and tribes to the north. During the 1221 Siege of Gurganj, tensions arose between him, his brothers, and Genghis, which never healed. Jochi was still estranged from his family when he died of ill health . His son Batu was appointed to rule his territories in his stead.

==Birth and paternity==
Jochi&#x27;s mother, Börte, was born into the Onggirat tribe, who lived along the Greater Khingan mountain range south of the Ergüne river, in modern-day Inner Mongolia. At the age of ten, she was betrothed to a Mongol boy named Temüjin, son of the Mongol chieftain Yesugei. Seven years later (), after he had survived a violent adolescence, they married. They had their first child, a daughter named Qojin, in 1179 or 1180. By forming alliances with notable steppe leaders, such as his friend Jamukha and his father&#x27;s former ally Toghrul, and with the help of his charisma, Temüjin began to attract followers and gain power. Word of his rise spread and soon drew the attention of the Merkit tribe to the northwest, from whom Yesugei had abducted Temüjin&#x27;s mother Hö&#x27;elün, sparking a blood feud; they resolved to take revenge on Yesugei&#x27;s heir.

Because of their consequences, the subsequent events were considered controversial: most contemporary authors omitted any mention of the events, while the two that did include them (the &quot;Secret History of the Mongols&quot;, a mid-13th-century epic poem, and the 14th-century Persian historian Rashid al-Din&#x27;s &quot;Jami al-tawarikh&quot;) are contradictory. The following narrative, containing elements from both, is considered most plausible. In 1180 or 1181, a large force of Merkits raided Temüjin&#x27;s camp; while most of his family managed to escape, Börte was captured. She was forcibly married to Chilger-Bökö, the younger brother of Hö&#x27;elün&#x27;s original husband. Meanwhile, Temüjin had convinced his allies to assemble substantial forces to help him rescue Börte. Under Jamukha&#x27;s command, the combined army campaigned against the Merkits and defeated them, recovering Börte and taking large amounts of plunder.

Börte was heavily pregnant and gave birth to Jochi in Jamukha&#x27;s camp. As Chilger-Bökö had undoubtedly raped her, and as she had been among the Merkits for nearly nine months, Jochi&#x27;s paternity was uncertain; this was reflected in his name, meaning &quot;guest&quot; in Mongolian. While Temüjin always regarded Jochi as his son by blood and treated him accordingly, many Mongols, such as his younger brother Chagatai, viewed him as a bastard sired by Chilger-Bökö.

==Adulthood==
===Marriages and family===

Jochi does not reappear in historical sources until 1203. By this time, he was old enough for marriage. Temüjin intended to betroth him to a daughter of his ally Toghrul, but because of Jochi&#x27;s uncertain birth and Temüjin&#x27;s comparatively low status, this proposal was taken as insulting by Toghrul&#x27;s people and eventually led to war between the two leaders. After Toghrul&#x27;s defeat in 1204, Jochi was given one of his nieces, Begtütmish, as a wife. He also married other women: Börte&#x27;s niece Öki; her relative Sorghan; and several less powerful women, namely Qutlugh Khatun, Sultan Khatun, Nubqus, Shīr, Qarajin, and Kul. In addition, Jochi took concubines. It is unknown who Jochi&#x27;s senior wife was, but it was likely either Öki or Sorghan.

Jochi&#x27;s most important sons were Orda Khan and Batu Khan; they were the children of Sorghan and Öki respectively. Neither these women nor Begtütmish was the mother of Jochi&#x27;s other notable son, Berke. The names of eleven other sons are known, but none had significant careers, reflecting the junior status of their mothers. Descendants of younger sons nevertheless used their Jochid lineage to legitimise their right to rule: these included Khiḍr Khan of Shiban&#x27;s line, and Tokhtamysh who descended from Jochi&#x27;s youngest son Tuqa-Timur.

===Early commands===
In 1206, having united the tribes of Mongolia, Temüjin held a large assembly called a where he was acclaimed as &quot;Genghis Khan&quot;. He began to reorder his new nation, dividing it between members of his ruling dynasty. As the eldest son, Jochi received the largest share—nine thousand subject warriors, all with their own families and herds; Chagatai received eight thousand, and their younger brothers Ögedei and Tolui received five thousand each. As expected for a firstborn, Jochi received the territories furthest away from the homeland for his (domain): they were located in western Mongolia along the River Irtysh.
This allocation was made with the expectation that Jochi would expand his domains, and so in 1207–08 he campaigned against and subjugated the , a collection of tribes on the edge of the Siberian taiga between the Angara and Irtysh rivers. Jochi secured a marriage alliance with the Oirats, whose leader Qutuqa Beki guided the Mongols to the Yenisei Kyrgyz and other Hoi-yin Irgen. These tribes soon submitted, and Jochi took control of the region&#x27;s trade in grain and furs, as well as its gold mines. He subsequently reinforced Subutai&#x27;s army before it defeated the renegade Merkits at the battle of the Irtysh River in late 1208 or early 1209. Jochi would campaign intermittently against the Merkits and their Qangli allies for the next decade, finally destroying the last remnants of the people in 1217 or 1218 alongside Subutai. The historian Christopher Atwood has argued that this narrative minimised Jochi&#x27;s role, that in reality he, not Subutai, was the primary commander in all campaigns against the Merkit and Qangli, and that his right to rule the former Qangli lands was justified by the success of the campaigns.

Alongside his brothers Chagatai and Ögedei, Jochi commanded the right wing in the 1211 invasion of the Chinese Jin dynasty. The Mongols marched southwards from Genghis&#x27;s campaign headquarters in modern Inner Mongolia in November 1211: first they attacked the cities in the area between Hohhot and Datong, and then they followed the Taihang Mountains into Shanxi, where they pillaged and plundered in autumn 1213. He may have also taken part in the Irghiz River skirmish, an inconclusive engagement fought against the army of Muhammad II of Khwarazm. The &quot;Secret History&quot; records two conversations between Jochi and his father about his campaigns: once when Genghis declined Jochi&#x27;s request to spare the life of a renowned Merkit archer, and once when Jochi&#x27;s triumphant return from the subjugation of the Oirats garnered high praise from his father.

===Khwarazmian war and succession===
In 1218, Genghis was provoked into launching a campaign against the Central Asian Khwarazmian Empire after a Mongol trade caravan was killed by the governor of the border town of Otrar and subsequent diplomatic overtures failed. According to the &quot;Secret History&quot;, Yesui, one of Genghis&#x27;s secondary wives, requested that he decide the succession before setting out. Though Genghis appears not to have cared about Jochi&#x27;s possible illegitimacy, Chagatai vehemently objected to his brother becoming the next khan, shouting &quot;How can we let ourselves be ruled by this Merkit bastard?&quot; After a short brawl between the brothers was broken up, the &quot;Secret History&quot; continues, the suggestion of Ögedei as a compromise candidate was endorsed by both brothers and their father. Other sources record a less febrile gathering taking place after the war&#x27;s conclusion, so some historians speculate that the &quot;Secret History&quot; account was &quot;a later interpolation&quot; and that Jochi only lost his place as heir after making mistakes during the Khwarazmian campaign.
The Mongol armies, estimated to number 150,000 or 200,000 men, descended upon Otrar in late 1219. Leaving Chagatai and Ögedei to besiege the town, Genghis took their younger brother Tolui and traversed the Kyzyl Kum desert to attack the city of Bukhara. Meanwhile, Jochi was dispatched to march down the Syr Darya river in the direction of the Khwarazmian capital Gurganj and subdue all the cities &quot;en route&quot;, which Genghis intended to become part of Jochi&#x27;s territories. The towns of Sighnaq and Asanas offered particularly stiff resistance and their inhabitants were thus slaughtered, while Jand and Yanikant were occupied without much trouble. In late 1220, he travelled southwest along the shores of the Aral Sea to Gurganj, while his brothers Chagatai and Ögedei, having captured Otrar, converged on his position.

There are contradictory accounts of the siege of Gurganj and Jochi&#x27;s part in it. What is certain is that the siege was lengthy, lasting between four and seven months, and that it was exceptionally fierce: the defiant Khwarazmian defenders forced the Mongol army to engage in bitter house-by-house urban warfare, with much of the city destroyed either by burning naphtha or flooding from collapsed dams. After the city&#x27;s fall in 1221, its inhabitants were either killed or enslaved.

The usual narrative of the siege recounts that Jochi and Chagatai quarrelled on how best to conduct its progress, as Jochi presumed that the rich city would become part of his domain and wished to damage it as little as possible. Chagatai on the other hand held no such qualms. When Genghis heard about this infighting, he ordered that Ögedei be promoted to command his brothers. Atwood argues that this narrative was a later invention designed to buttress Ögedei&#x27;s rule as khan of the empire and that Jochi in reality retained primacy throughout the siege.

===Death and legacy===
Regardless of the narrative discrepancies, Jochi lost the favour of his father following the siege. Genghis likely considered it a military failure on account of its length and destruction; Jochi also erred by not sending his father his rightful share of the loot. After its conclusion, Chagatai and Ögedei departed southwards to join their father in his pursuit of the renegade Khwarazmian prince Jalal al-Din, while Jochi moved north, ostensibly to bring the Qangli to heel in his new territories, which included the steppes west of the river Chu. Some sources allege that he preferred to spend his time hunting, an activity he was very greatly fond of. It is unclear if he ever met his father again.

Although Jochi sent huge numbers of wild asses and 20,000 white horses to Genghis as a gift , relations were steadily worsening because of Jochi&#x27;s preoccupation with his territories. On his return home, Genghis ordered Jochi to join him, but the latter claimed he was too ill to do so. When a traveller claimed that he was not ill and merely hunting, Genghis resolved to bring him to heel. Before he could do so, in either 1225 or 1227, news came that Jochi had died of his illness. One account, likely fabricated, states that Jochi had been so offended by the destruction at Gurganj that he had made a secret alliance with the Khwarazmians, and that having found out, Genghis ordered that Jochi be poisoned.

Batu was confirmed as ruler of his father&#x27;s territories by Genghis—his elder brother Orda assumed a junior position, while their younger brothers each took a strip of land to rule. Jochi&#x27;s descendants would grow more independent, eventually ruling over the state known as the Golden Horde. Although a large mausoleum in Ulytau Region in Kazakhstan has traditionally been identified as the resting place of Jochi&#x27;s remains, radiocarbon dating indicates that it was built much later and that it is not the site of the grave.

<text>The German Bowl is the annual national championship game in the sport of American football in Germany. It is contested by the two best teams of the German Football League.

The New Yorker Lions, from Braunschweig, are the record winners of the German Bowl, with 12 successful participations out of 18 overall. The Düsseldorf Panther and the Berlin Adler both have six titles to their name, but Berlin has the best win–loss record of all clubs, 75 percent. Altogether, as of 2021, twelve clubs have won a German Bowl, while a further four clubs have reached the German Bowl once but lost their sole appearance (Stuttgart Scorpions, Badener Greifs, Marburg Mercenaries and Frankfurt Universe). The most-played match up in the history of the game is the Braunschweig Lions versus the Hamburg Blue Devils, having been played six times, last in 2005. The matchup between the Schwäbisch Hall Unicorns and the New Yorker Lions has occurred five times - all in the span from 2014 to 2019. German Bowl XIX to German Bowl XXX (inclusive) all had appearances by the Braunschweig Lions (later to be renamed for sponsorship reasons to &quot;New Yorker Lions&quot;) for twelve consecutive appearances over the space of over a decade.

Apart from the German Bowl, a Junior Bowl has also been contested in Germany since 1982. A Ladies Bowl was introduced in 1990. Other, related, national championship games in Germany include the German Flag Bowl (est. 2000), German Junior Flag Bowl (1999) and a German Indoor Flag Bowl (2000).

==History==
In 1979, the &quot;American Football Bundesliga&quot;, later to be renamed the German Football League, was formed, consisting of six clubs, the Frankfurter Löwen, Ansbach Grizzlies, Düsseldorf Panther, Munich Cowboys, Berlin Bears and Bremerhaven Seahawks. Of those six, the top two teams would contest the first ever German Bowl on 10 November 1979.

The early years of the league were dominated by two teams, Frankfurt and Ansbach, who met each other in the first three editions of the German Bowl. Of those, Frankfurt won the first two and Ansbach the last. The era of the Frankfurter Löwen came to an end soon afterwards and the club went defunct in the mid-1980s, while the Ansbach Grizzlies continued to be an outstanding team, playing in all of the first eight German Bowls. Unlike the first season, play-off semi-finals were played in 1980 and 1981 to determine the two German Bowl contestants. From 1982, the play-offs were enlarged to include a quarter-final round as well.

The 1982 season saw Ansbach repeat its title, this time against the Cologne Crocodiles. After that, the era of the Düsseldorf Panther versus Ansbach Grizzlies rivalry began, with the two teams meeting in the next four finals. Of those, the team from Düsseldorf won the 1983, 1984 and 1986 editions, while the Grizzlies earned their third championship in 1985. With the 1986 final, the golden age of the Ansbach Grizzlies ended and the club disappeared from the top level altogether by 1991. From 1986, a wild-card round was introduced as well, taking the number of teams in the play-offs to twelve.

The 1987 German Bowl saw two completely new teams compete against each other, the Badener Greifs making their only appearance in the championship game to date, while the Berlin Adler won their first of what would be six national championships by 2010. In 1988, Red Barons Cologne defeated the Düsseldorf Panther in the final, while, from 1989 onwards, the Berlin Adler became the first team to win three championships in a row, all against teams from Cologne. After the 1990 season, the play-offs were reduced to eight teams again, dropping the wild-card round, a system still in place as of 2010.
The Panther earned their fourth title in 1992, defeating the Munich Cowboys, which, in the following year, won the championship themselves, against Cologne Crocodiles, who suffered their fourth defeat in their fourth German Bowl. Munich&#x27;s title in 1993 was to be the last occasion for the next twelve years that a team from the South would reach the final, and the last time until 2011 that a team from the South would win the championship. The &quot;Bundesliga&quot; and the German Bowl were from then on dominated by the North.

In 1994 and 1995, the Düsseldorf Panther once more won the German Bowl, with the second title won against a new force in the game in Germany, the Hamburg Blue Devils. In 1996, the Blue Devils then reversed their previous misfortune and defeated the Panthers in the final.

The most dominant era of any team in the sport in Germany begun in 1997, when the Braunschweig Lions reached and won the German Bowl for the first time. The Lions would play in every one of the next twelve German Bowls until 2008, and win seven of those. Their first title, in 1997, was won against the Cologne Crocodiles, who now had the unenviable record of five losses in five German Bowl appearances. The following six seasons, the final was contested by the Lions and the Blue Devils on five occasions, with the Lions winning in 1998 and 1999, while the Blue Devils won in 2001, 2002 and 2003. Only in 2000 did neither of those two win the Bowl. Instead, the Cologne Crocodiles finally reversed their fortunes and won a championship in their sixth attempt. In between, in 1999, the &quot;Bundesliga&quot; was renamed to German Football League.

Braunschweig lost a fifth final in a row in 2004, when the Berlin Adler won their first title in 13 years. After that, the Braunschweig Lions set a new record, winning four German Bowls in a row, beating four different teams in the finals. In 2005, the Blue Devils were once more the opposition, followed by two southern teams, the Marburg Mercenaries in 2006 and the Stuttgart Scorpions in 2007. The seventh title for the Lions came in 2008, against the new force of the Kiel Baltic Hurricanes.

Kiel also played in the 2009 final, losing to the Berlin Adler, before finally being successful in 2010 and securing their first title against the same team.

German Bowl XXXIII was held on 8 October 2011 at the MDCC-Arena in Magdeburg. The 2011 season saw the end of an 18-year title drought for the south, when the Schwäbisch Hall Unicorns defeated Kiel 48–44 to carry off the national championship for the first time. The Unicorns repeated their 2011 title in 2012 in the highest-scoring German Bowl to date winning 56–53 on a late field goal, while the 2013 title went to a resurgent and renamed Braunschweig, now playing as the New Yorker Lions in a close 35–34 victory against the Dresden Monarchs in their first German Bowl appearance. Dresden missed an extra-point attempt after their first touchdown and went on to lose on a late fumble, the only turnover of the game, while driving towards good field position for a field goal. The Lions won their ninth German Bowl in 2014 with the highest-ever winning margin, defeating the Schwäbisch Hall Unicorns 47–9. Schwäbisch Hall scored no points in this game after a field goal on their first possession until the fourth quarter when most of the Braunschweig starters, including MVP quarterback Casey Therriault, were already off the field. The Lions repeated their 2014 success against the Unicorns in 2015, winning 41–31.

==North–South disparity==
Success in American football in Germany and at the German Bowl differs hugely between the clubs from the northern and the southern division, with the south only winning ten German Bowls and the north the remaining 32 (through XLII). Similarly (through XLII), southern clubs have only made 26 appearances in the Bowl, while northern clubs have appeared 58 times. After the first three German Bowls, the final was only contested by two southern clubs one other time; in the 2018 edition when another Frankfurt based team - Frankfurt Universe - did what had only been achieved before by the long since defunct Frankfurter Löwen - reaching a German Bowl against another GFL South representative - The Schwäbisch Hall Unicorns. Between the end of the golden era of the Ansbach Grizzlies in 1986 and the rise of the Schwäbisch Hall Unicorns (who first reached the German Bowl in 2011), southern clubs have only made five appearances in the championship game of which only one was successful (the Munich Cowboys in 1993). After first reaching the German Bowl in 2011, the Schwäbisch Hall Unicorns made all (as of 2021) subsequent German Bowls except the 2013 edition where they were upset by the Berlin Adler in the quarterfinal of the playoffs. As the 2018 German Bowl was an all Southern affair, balancing out the all Northern German Bowl 2013, the divisions have achieved parity in representation at the final for the period beginning in 2011. However, in terms of wins the North still has the edge even for the 2011-2019 period as Schwäbisch Hall won it all four times in that decade whereas Braunschweig&#x27;s New Yorker Lions won the Bowl five times in the same period.

The station signed on the air on . Its original call sign was WMNI-FM, the FM counterpart to WMNI 920 AM. The two stations mostly simulcast an easy listening format.

By 1978 the station&#x27;s call letters were WRMZ and, in the early &#x27;80s, it started to broadcast a country music format. Joe Hill former OM of WHRI/KWHR/WHRA was there in 1983. From 1987 to 1992, the station was known as WMGG, &quot;Magic 99-7&quot;, and played classic rock.

===The Blitz: 1992–2008===
&quot;The Blitz&quot; began at 4 p.m. on July 2, 1992. WBZX aired an active rock format. In morning drive time, it carried &quot;The Howard Stern Show&quot;, syndicated from New York City from 1997 to 2005.

===The Rock: 2008–10===
On April 3, 2008, WBZX began stunting with radio static and a voice mentioning that the &quot;station is rebooting&quot;. The last song played on &quot;The Blitz&quot; was Breaking Benjamin&#x27;s &quot;Until the End&quot;. The next day, at 5:00 P.M., WBZX relaunched as &quot;The Rock&quot;, along with the call letters changing to WRKZ. The new station premiered with Nirvana&#x27;s &quot;Smells Like Teen Spirit&quot;. &quot;The Rock&quot; still had the active rock format, but it focused less on new music and played popular rock music from the 1980s.

The station added the syndicated &quot;The Bob &amp; Tom Show&quot; during the Morning Drive in December 2008.

During the last few months as &quot;The Rock&quot;, the station added rock songs from the &#x27;60s and &#x27;70s into its playlist, shifting it into a Mainstream Rock direction. Only a few months later, the station hosted its first-ever &quot;Town Hall Meeting&quot;, with Program Director Hal Fish and on-air personalities Ronni Hunter and Blazor taking calls, emails and texts as to what Columbus area listeners wanted more and less of on 99.7. A week later, on April 1, 2010, they once again went to the airwaves and detailed an &quot;Action Plan&quot; as to what would happen on the station in the following weeks, including the return of such Blitz-era staples as &quot;Choose It Or Lose It&quot; as well as a showcase for local musical talent. In addition, a website was launched at blitzorrock.com to determine whether or not listeners wanted to keep the station named &quot;The Rock&quot; or for &quot;The Blitz&quot; to make a return.

===The Blitz: 2010–present===

On April 22, 2010, at a &quot;Blitz or Rock Reveal Party&quot; it was announced that the station would be once again called &quot;The Blitz&quot;. It premiered with Mudvayne&#x27;s &quot;Happy?&quot;, followed by Disturbed&#x27;s &quot;Down with the Sickness&quot;. Along with the changes, it was also announced that &quot;The Bob &amp; Tom Show&quot; would be dropped in a few weeks and be replaced by a local morning show. The show that replaced it was Blazor and Mo in the morning, which ironically was the same show that Bob &amp; Tom replaced in December 2008.

In early December 2011, Mo (Maurice Jovan) was no longer on the air. On February 6, 2012, Mark Blazor resigned.

<text>WLVQ (96.3 FM) — branded Q-FM 96 — is a commercial classic rock radio station licensed to Columbus, Ohio. Owned by Saga Communications (through its Franklin Communications licensee), and operated as part of its Columbus Radio Group, the station serves the Columbus metro area. The WLVQ studios are located in Upper Arlington, OH, and the station transmitter is in Columbus on the Twin Rivers Drive tower.

== History ==

The 96.3 MHz frequency was first occupied by WLWF, a station owned by the Crosley Broadcasting Corporation along with sister station WLWC (now WCMH-TV); WLWF broadcast from 1949–1953. WLVQ itself began on April 1, 1959, as WTVN-FM, owned by Taft Broadcasting Company along with sister stations and WTVN-TV (now WSYX). In 1966, WTVN-FM changed its callsign to WBUK and format to adult contemporary. The station again switched formats and started playing &quot;beautiful music&quot; (easy listening) in 1969. The station reverted to the WTVN-FM call sign in 1974, but continued to play &quot;beautiful music&quot;.

The station adopted the WLVQ call sign on February 14, 1977. The first song played was &quot;New Kid in Town&quot; by the Eagles. For many years the station&#x27;s mascot was The Q Kangaroo, a creature selected by a listener in a contest. Q-FM-96 was an early champion of, and outlet for, Columbus&#x27;s vibrant rock music community, and was particularly notable for its &quot;Hometown Album Project&quot;, a series of compilation LPs featuring local artists, which debuted shortly after the station signed on. Another program in the 1980s was the Sunday morning show &quot;Psychedelic Sunday,&quot; showcasing 1960s-era rock, much of it relatively obscure, and hosted by British DJ Russell Carey.

On November 4, 2015, Saga Communications announced it had agreed to purchase WLVQ from Wilks Broadcast Group. Saga owns and operates Columbus stations WSNY, WVMX, WNND and WNNP through its Franklin Communications, Inc. subsidiary. The purchase by Saga was consummated on February 3, 2016, at a price of $13 million.

==Current programming==
Currently WLVQ/Q-FM-96 airs the Torg &amp; Elliott morning show; Scott Torgerson and Jerry Elliott. Long time morning host Mark &quot;Daddy Wags&quot; Wagner is retired. Jerry Elliott and Kristie Kemper joined The Morning Show in 1990, Torg joined the show in 2013. Jerry was a stand-up comedian, Kristie came from the morning show at WAZU/Dayton, OH, and Torg, former afternoon drive personality on sports WBNS-FM/97.1 The Fan. Kristie Kemper also handles mid-days along with the Iconic Nooner feature. Archie steers the ship through afternoons with features like the 4:20 Haircut &amp; the Joe Show Drive at Five on Fridays. In September 2022 “DaveMan” returned to Qfm96 after 16 years to take over evenings from Doug Risher who accepted a new position on Nantucket Island.

<text>The Taipei Economic and Cultural Representative Office (TECRO), also known as Taipei Economic and Cultural Office (TECO), Taipei Representative Office (TRO) or Taipei Mission, is an alternative diplomatic institution serving as a &quot;de facto&quot; embassy or a consulate of the Republic of China (ROC, commonly referred to as Taiwan) to exercise the foreign affairs and consular services in specific countries which have established formal diplomatic relations with the People&#x27;s Republic of China (PRC, commonly referred to as China). The PRC denies the legitimacy of the ROC as a sovereign state and claims the ROC-controlled territories as an integral part of its territory. An exclusive mandate, namely One-China policy, requires that any country wishing to establish a diplomatic relationship with the PRC must first sever any formal relationship with the ROC. According to &quot;The Fletcher Forum of World Affairs&quot;, &quot;non-recognition of the Taiwanese government is a prerequisite for conducting formal diplomatic relations with the PRCin effect forcing other governments to choose between Beijing and Taipei.&quot; As a result, these countries only allow the ROC to establish representative offices instead of a fully-fledged embassy or consulate for the purpose of conducting practical bilateral relations without granting full diplomatic recognition.

Except in Lithuania and Somaliland (opened in 2020), all offices use the capital city &quot;Taipei&quot; and refrain from using the name &quot;Taiwan&quot; or the &quot;Republic of China&quot;, since the term &quot;Taipei&quot; avoids implying that Taiwan is a different country on par with the PRC or that there are &quot;Two Chinas&quot;, the PRC and the ROC, in order to diminish the obstacles of building pragmatic diplomacy and sidestep the Taiwan issue. The first attempt of using the name &quot;Taiwan&quot; in a Taiwanese diplomatic mission within a non-diplomatic state was when Lithuania broke the tradition with the name Taiwanese Representative Office in Lithuania in 2021. In response the PRC expelled Lithuania&#x27;s embassy staff from Beijing and downgraded diplomatic relations to charge d&#x27;affaires status. Attempts by other countries, including Fiji, to allow ROC government to change the representative office to indicate &quot;Taiwan&quot; later failed and were reversed under pressure from PRC government. 

On the other side, offices located in Taiwan usually also use the term &quot;Taipei&quot;, though the United States, Japan, and Somaliland (but not Lithuania) use &quot;Taiwan&quot; (for example the American Institute in Taiwan).

TECROs state that their aim is &quot;to promote bilateral trade, investment, culture, science and technology exchanges and cooperation, as well as better understanding&quot;, and provide common citizen services towards overseas Taiwanese, such as issuing visas and passports.

TECROs in the United States enjoy many diplomatic privileges such as extraterritoriality, providing consular protection and their staff have diplomatic immunity. Other countries also establish reciprocal representative offices in Taiwan, such as the American Institute in Taiwan, Canadian Trade Office in Taipei and Japan–Taiwan Exchange Association.

==History==

Following the admission of the PRC to the United Nations in 1971, many countries began to establish diplomatic relations with the government in Beijing, and as a consequence, ended diplomatic relations with the Nanjing-based ROC Government stationed in Taipei. In order to maintain trade and cultural ties with countries with which it no longer had diplomatic relations, Taiwan established representative offices in these countries, often replacing its former embassies.

Before the 1990s, the names of these offices would vary considerably from country to country, usually omitting any reference to &quot;Taiwan&quot; or &quot;Republic of China&quot;, instead referring to &quot;East Asia&quot;, &quot;Far East&quot; or &quot;Free China&quot;. They would also describe themselves as &quot;centres&quot; or &quot;offices&quot;, concerned with trade, tourism, culture or information, thereby emphasising their private and unofficial status, despite being staffed by Ministry of Foreign Affairs personnel.

For example, in Japan, the former ROC Embassy was replaced by the &quot;Association of East Asian Relations&quot; (AEAR) in 1972. In Malaysia, following the closure of the consulate general in Kuala Lumpur in 1974, an office known as the Far East Travel and Trade Centre was established. In the Philippines, the former embassy in Manila was replaced by the &quot;Pacific Economic and Cultural Center&quot;, established in 1975. In Thailand, the former embassy in Bangkok was replaced by the &quot;Office of the Representative of China Airlines&quot; in 1975. This was later renamed the Far East Trade Office in 1980.

In the United States, Taipei&#x27;s mission, established in 1979, was known as the &quot;Coordination Council for North American Affairs&quot; (CCNAA). As of 2019, it has been renamed &quot;Taiwan Council for US Affairs.&quot;

In the United Kingdom, Taiwan was represented by the &quot;Free Chinese Centre&quot;, established in 1963. In West Germany, it was represented by a &quot;Büro der Fernost-Informationen&quot; (&quot;Far East Information Office&quot;) established in 1972. In Spain, the office, established in 1973, was known as the &quot;Centro Sun Yat-sen&quot; (&quot;Sun Yat-sen Centre&quot;). In the Netherlands, the office was known as the &quot;Far East Trade Office&quot;.

However, in the late 1980s, these offices began using the name &quot;Taipei&quot; in their titles due to confusion on their functions, particular those needing visa to travel to ROC areas. Using the &quot;Taipei&quot; is more familiar as it was recently used in the Olympics after &quot;Chinese Taipei&quot; Olympics team rejoined in 1981. In May 1992, the AEAR offices in Japan became Taipei Economic and Cultural Representative Offices. The &quot;Free Chinese Centre&quot; in London was similarly renamed the &quot;Taipei Representative Office&quot;. In September 1994, the Clinton Administration announced that the CCNAA office in Washington could similarly be called the Taipei Economic and Cultural Representative Office.
Earlier in 1989, the &quot;Pacific Economic and Cultural Center&quot; in Manila became the &quot;Taipei Economic and Cultural Office in the Philippines&quot;. In 1991, the &quot;Taiwan Marketing Service&quot; office in Canberra, Australia, established in 1988, also became a &quot;Taipei Economic and Cultural Office&quot;, along with the &quot;Far East Trading Company&quot; offices in Sydney and Melbourne.

Other names are still used elsewhere; for example, the mission in Moscow is formally known as the &quot;Representative Office in Moscow for the Taipei-Moscow Economic and Cultural Coordination Commission&quot;, the mission in New Delhi is known as the &quot;Taipei Economic and Cultural Center&quot;. The mission in Pretoria is known as the &quot;Taipei Liaison Office&quot;.

The two most recent ones to change their official names, in Papua New Guinea and in Jordan, both use the name &quot;Taipei Economic and Cultural Office&quot; ().

==TECRO in the United States==

Originally called the Coordination Council for North American Affairs (CCNAA), the name of the CCNAA office in Washington, D.C. (the &quot;embassy&quot;) was changed to &quot;Taipei Economic and Cultural Representative Office&quot; (TECRO) as a result of the Clinton administration&#x27;s Taiwan Policy Review of 1994. Similarly, the names of the twelve other CCNAA offices (&quot;consulates&quot;) in the United States were changed to &quot;Taipei Economic and Cultural Office&quot; (TECO).

On May 24, 2019, Taiwan informed that &quot;the Coordination Council for North American Affairs&quot; was renamed &quot;the Taiwan Council for U.S. Affairs&quot;.

In September 2020, the US Ambassador to the United Nations Kelly Craft met with James K.J. Lee, director-general of the Taipei Economic and Cultural Office in New York, who was secretary-general in Taiwan&#x27;s Ministry of Foreign Affairs until July, for lunch in New York City in what was the first meeting between a top Taiwan official and a United States ambassador to the United Nations. Craft said she and Lee discussed ways the US can help Taiwan become more engaged within the U.N., and she pointed to a December 2019 email alert from Taiwan that WHO had ignored, recognizing and warning about the danger of the person-to-person transmission of the new highly contagious COVID-19 virus in China.

==TECRO in Japan==
Diplomatic relations between the Republic of China and Japan were broken off in September 1972. For practical reasons, the Association of East Asian Relations (AEAR), was established two months after the Japan-China Joint Communique was signed. EARA had offices in Taipei, Tokyo, Osaka, and Fukuoka. In 1992, Japan authorized the change in name of AEAR to TECRO.

==Representations in the PRC special administrative regions==
===Hong Kong===

In Hong Kong, from 1966, Taiwan was represented by the &#x27;Chung Hwa Travel Service&#x27;, a name chosen to avoid upsetting Beijing. On 20 July 2011, as a result of warming relations between Taiwan and Beijing, the name was formally changed to the Taipei Economic and Cultural Office, bringing it into line with other Republic of China representative offices around the world.

===Macau===
In Macau, from 1989 to 1999, Taiwan was represented by the &#x27;Taipei Trade and Tourism Office&#x27;, Taiwan&#x27;s first-time representation in Macau after Kuomintang&#x27;s expulsion from Macau as the consequence of the December 3rd Incident in 1966. From 1999 to 2011, Taiwan was represented by the &#x27;Taipei Economic and Cultural Center&#x27;. On 13 May 2012, the name was formally changed to the Taipei Economic and Cultural Office.

==TRO in the United Kingdom==
In 1950, the UK switched recognition from the Republic of China to the People&#x27;s Republic of China (PRC) shortly after its establishment, while maintaining the British Consulate in Tamsui, through which the UK continued to carry out consular and trade-related activities. The consulate was closed after the UK and the PRC upgraded relations to Ambassadorial level in March 1972, and in June 1980 the building and land of the consulate were returned to the Taiwanese government. The ROC government&#x27;s office in the UK was set up in September 1963, and at the time was known as the Free Chinese Centre. In 1992, this was revised to become the Taipei Representative Office in the UK.

== Taipei Representative Office in Norway ==
The Taipei Representative Office in Norway; () was a diplomatic mission of Taiwan to Norway that functioned as a &quot;de facto&quot; embassy. The first representative office of Taiwan in Norway was the Taipei Trade Centre, established in 1980.

In July 2017, the ROC Ministry of Foreign Affairs announced that the office will be suspended on 30 September 2017 and affairs related to Taiwanese in the country will be handled by Taipei Mission in Sweden. The decision was made to improve the efficiency of the foreign diplomatic missions of Taiwan.

<text>WXMG (95.5 MHz &quot;Magic 95.5&quot;) is a commercial FM radio station licensed to Lancaster, Ohio, and serving the Columbus metropolitan area. It is owned by Urban One and broadcasts an urban adult contemporary radio format. WXMG carries nationally syndicated shows from Rickey Smiley, D.L. Hughley and Al B. Sure! The radio studios and offices are on East First Avenue in Columbus.

WXMG&#x27;s effective radiated power (ERP) is 21,000 watts. The transmitter is on Stoney Hill Road SW in Delmont, Ohio, near U.S. Route 22.

==Station history==
=== Country (1958–2013) ===
The station first went on the air in December 1958 as WHOK-FM, making it one of Central Ohio&#x27;s oldest FM stations. It was the FM counterpart to WHOK (1320 AM, now WLOH). For decades, WHOK-FM was a country music station, using the &quot;K95.5&quot; moniker. From September 7, 2003, to January 8, 2007, WHOK-FM played mainly classic country as &quot;Country Legends K95.5&quot;.

The relaunch of the station in January 2007 (which saw its moniker changed to &quot;95.5 The Hawk&quot;, and a new 50/50 classic and current country balance taking place) coincided with a change in ownership from CBS Radio to Wilks Broadcasting. Accordingly, the station completely revamped its website and as of May 2007, the new WHOK.com was rolled out, offering artist and concert links as well as a streaming audio feature by which users can &quot;listen live&quot; anytime.

Beginning in January 2009, WHOK-FM incorporated more of the classic country back into its playlist, dating back to the 1950s with songs by Hank Williams, Sr., some early Johnny Cash and George Jones numbers, and rare gems by Tammy Wynette and Billy &quot;Crash&quot; Craddock, to name a few. However, the station did not present this to listeners as a change in format; the branding of the station was still &quot;95.5 The Hawk&quot; and the website still displayed the same look and feel as before, albeit with more classic country artists. The playlist extended into the 1990s and early 2000s (e.g. Garth Brooks, Alan Jackson, Faith Hill) but no current or recent titles were played outside of certain syndicated shows.

On January 16, 2012, the station reverted to the K95.5 branding, and readopted a mix of newer and classic country with the positioner &quot;New Country and the Legends&quot;. The classic component continued to differentiate WHOK-FM from its sister WNKK (Wink 107.1), which exclusively played new country.

=== Sports (2013–2015) ===
On Monday, April 1, 2013, at 6p.m., the station changed to &quot;95.5 The Game&quot;, broadcasting a sports format as an affiliate of CBS Sports Radio. K95 and its format moved to the former home of WINK 107.1 as &quot;K95 on 107.1&quot; and blowing up WINK 107.1 and staying with the former K95 branding, only switching frequencies from 95.5 to 107.1. The final song played on K95 on the 95.5 signal as a country format was &quot;Wide Open Spaces&quot; by The Dixie Chicks. On April 4, 2013, the station changed its call sign to WZOH-FM.

During its stint as a sports format, WZOH-FM was the Columbus affiliate for the Cleveland Browns and Cleveland Cavaliers. It was also the English flagship for Columbus Crew SC for the 2014 season.

=== Urban (2015–present) ===
The sports format lasted until midnight on November 12, 2015. At that time, WXMG&#x27;s format moved from 106.3 FM to 95.5 FM. The 95.5 frequency, along with WHOK-FM, had been purchased by Radio One.

==Translator==
Due to the poor signal in downtown Columbus, WZOH-FM operated a translator on 94.1 MHz as W272AT until June 25, 2013.

<doc id="745376" wikidata="Q7951723" url="?curid=745376" title="WKKJ">
<text>WKKJ (94.3 FM) is a radio station broadcasting a country music format. Licensed to Chillicothe, Ohio, United States. The station is owned by iHeartMedia, Inc. and features local news and high school sports with agricultural news from ABN Radio.

== History ==
On December 22, 1978, WFCB signed on the air. It was owned by Terins Enterprises and was powered at only 3,000 watts. It could only be heard in Chillicothe and nearby communities. In 1989, it was acquired by the Wyandot Radio Corporation, which also owned WCHI.

When Clear Channel Communications acquired WFCB, it switched the format to oldies.

In 2002, co-owned WKKJ (93.3 FM) was moved to the more lucrative Columbus media market, 50 miles north of Chillicothe, with Ashville as the new city of license. In order to clear this move from Chillicothe to Ashville, WFCB changed call letters to WKKJ, assumed the country music format heard on the previous WKKJ, and reassigned all on- and off-air personnel, effectively becoming the successor station to the previous WKKJ.

After the switch, WKKJ was re-imaged as &quot;94 Country&quot;.

<doc id="745387" wikidata="Q423005" url="?curid=745387" title="Malathion">
<text>Malathion is an organophosphate insecticide which acts as an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor. In the USSR, it was known as carbophos, in New Zealand and Australia as maldison and in South Africa as mercaptothion.

==Pesticide use==
Malathion is a pesticide that is widely used in agriculture, residential landscaping, public recreation areas, and in public health pest control programs such as mosquito eradication. In the US, it is the most commonly used organophosphate insecticide.

A malathion mixture with corn syrup was used in the 1980s in Australia and California to combat the Mediterranean fruit fly. In Canada and the US starting in the early 2000s, malathion was sprayed in many cities to combat west Nile virus. Malathion was used over the last couple of decades on a regular basis during summer months to kill mosquitoes, but homeowners were allowed an exemption for their properties if they chose..

In the United Kingdom, malathion was withdrawn from sale in 2002.

==Mechanism of action==
Malathion is an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor, a diverse family of chemicals. Upon uptake into the target organism, it binds irreversibly to the serine residue in the active catalytic site of the cholinesterase enzyme. The resultant phosphoester group is strongly bound to the cholinesterase, and irreversibly deactivates the enzyme which leads to rapid build-up of acetylcholine at the synapse.

==Production method==
Malathion is produced by the addition of dimethyl dithiophosphoric acid to diethyl maleate or diethyl fumarate. The compound is chiral but is used as a racemate.

==Medical use==
Malathion in low doses (0.5% preparations) is used as a treatment for:
* Head lice and body lice. Malathion is approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for treatment of pediculosis. It is claimed to effectively kill both the eggs and the adult lice, but in fact has been shown in UK studies to be only 36% effective on head lice, and less so on their eggs. This low efficiency was noted when malathion was applied to lice found on schoolchildren in the Bristol area in the UK, and is caused by the tested population of lice having developed resistance against malathion.
* Scabies

Preparations include Derbac-M, Prioderm, Quellada-M and Ovide.

==Safety==

===General===
Malathion is of low toxicity. In arthropods it is metabolized into malaoxon which is 61x more toxic, being a more potent inhibitor of acetylcholinesterase. According to the United States Environmental Protection Agency, no reliable information is available on adverse health effects of chronic exposure.

In 1989, Malathion was sprayed over a area to control an outbreak of Mediterranean fruit flies in California. In order to demonstrate the chemical&#x27;s safety, B. T. Collins, director of the California Conservation Corps, publicly swallowed a mouthful of dilute malathion solution.

===Carcinogenicity===
Malathion is classified by the IARC as probable carcinogen (group 2A). Malathion is classified by US EPA as having &quot;suggestive evidence of carcinogenicity&quot;. This classification was based on the occurrence of liver tumors at excessive doses in mice and female rats and the presence of rare oral and nasal tumors in rats that occurred following exposure to very large doses. Exposure to organophosphates is associated with non-Hodgkin&#x27;s lymphoma. Malathion used as a fumigant was not associated with increased cancer risk. Between 1993 and 1997, as part of the Agricultural Health Study, no clear association between malathion exposure and cancer was reported.

===Amphibians===
Malathion is toxic to leopard frog tadpoles.

==Risks==

Malathion is of low toxicity; however, absorption or ingestion into the human body readily results in its metabolism to malaoxon, which is substantially more toxic. In studies of the effects of long-term exposure to oral ingestion of malaoxon in rats, malaoxon has been shown to be 61 times more toxic than malathion, and malaoxon is 1,000 times more potent than malathion in terms of its acetylcholinesterase inhibition. Indoor spillage of malathion can thus be more poisonous than expected, as malathion breaks down in a confined space into the more toxic malaoxon. It is cleared from the body quickly, in three to five days.

==Resistance==
Because it is an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor, this resistance is a type of AChEI resistance. Malathion resistance is thought to always be due to either increased carboxylesterase concentrations or altered acetylcholinesterases. COE because it metabolizes malathion but into &quot;non&quot;-malaoxon products, altered AChEs because we mean specifically those altered to be less sensitive to malathion and malaoxon.

<text>WQIO is an FM radio station in Mount Vernon, Ohio. The station plays adult contemporary music as &quot;The New Super Q 93.7&quot;. Currently. WQIO is currently owned by BAS Broadcasting of Fremont, Ohio.

==History==
WQIO-FM and its former sister station WMVO were founded by Helen E. Zelkowitz in the 1950s and remained locally owned and operated under Mt. Vernon Broadcasting until its sale in 1994. During the 70s &amp; early 80s, the station was known as The New O94, playing Adult Contemporary music with OM/Morning host Ron Staats.

In spring of 1986, along with its power increase from 20 to 50 kW, the station changed its call letters to WQIO with a live Adult-leaning CHR format. With Mike Greene as General Manager, the change was supported with new air talent and jingles, contests and promotions, and live remotes throughout the region. Some of the on air talent at the time included Jan Chamberlain, Bill Moore, Jon Zellner, Joel Riley, Tony Coles, with Mike Greene, Ric Knight and the Super Q Morning Crew: Dave Macy, Stacy McKay &amp; Skip Bevington. These ventures, along with serious upgrades in branding and programming raised the station&#x27;s appeal in the region, and even pulled in significant ratings from the Columbus Market—giving Columbus based WNCI a run for its money in areas that received WQIO&#x27;s signal. It was during this time that branding such as &quot;93.7 WQIO, Ohio&#x27;s Super Station!&quot; and &quot;The Super Q&quot; were implemented; these mottos have recently been resurrected by WQIO&#x27;s present management. Known as &quot;93.7 WQIO&quot;, WQIO was the region&#x27;s most popular Top 40/CHR station, consistently rating first in Knox, Holmes, Ashland and Richland counties, and nearly beating WNCI multiple times in Licking and Delaware Counties.

In 1989, as a result of cost-cutting, majority of the staff left the station. The station continued its format until 1990, when it transformed into a simulcast of Transtar&#x27;s Bright AC. In 1996 WQIO became one of its area&#x27;s first Hot AC radio stations due to the competition of WYHT in Mansfield.

In 1994, Ashland Broadcasting purchased the stations to pair them with WNCO &amp; WNCO-FM in nearby Ashland. The company&#x27;s new name after the purchase from Zelkowitz was Knox Broadcasting, a division of Dean Stampfli&#x27;s Ohio Radio Group. Ohio Radio Group eventually become a local radio powerhouse, owning 7 stations, including WFXN-FM (102.3, Galion, Ohio), WMAN-FM (98.3, Fredericktown, Ohio) and WXXF (107.7 Loudonville, Ohio). At that time, it was rebranded into &quot;93Q&quot;, with a format closer to Hot AC programmed by Rod Staats aka Ric Knight from 1994 to 1997. Some of the air talent at that time, Trisha Moore, Joe Rinehart, Greg Burgess and Ric Knight. In 2000, Knox Broadcasting and the entire Ohio Radio Group was sold to Clear Channel Broadcasting for $32 Million.

WQIO and WMVO remained under Clear Channel ownership until October 1, 2005, when they were sold to the current owners, BAS Broadcasting. After that sale, WQIO adopted the name &quot;The New Eagle 93.7&quot;, sharing the name with sister station &quot;Eagle 99&quot; WFRO-FM in Fremont. Upon the name change, the station initially carried the &quot;Today&#x27;s hits and Yesterday&#x27;s favorites&quot; satellite format from ABC Radio before taking Dial Global Local&#x27;s &quot;AC Pure&quot; format.

On February 28, 2013, WQIO returned the &quot;Super Q&quot; branding, as well the iconic slogan &quot;Ohio&#x27;s Super Station!&quot; albeit retaining its AC format.

WQIO was also the callsign used by 1060 AM in Canton, Ohio during its brief but successful run as a Top 40/CHR station in the late 1970s as &quot;Q10&quot;. That station is now WILB, a Catholic broadcaster.

<text>WHIZ-FM (92.7 FM) is a commercial radio station licensed to South Zanesville, Ohio, featuring a contemporary hit radio format known as &quot;Z92&quot;. Owned by Marquee Broadcasting, WHIZ-FM&#x27;s studios are located on Downard Road in Zanesville and its transmitter is located near Crooksville, Ohio. WHIZ-FM was previously broadcast on 102.5 FM.

==History==

The 92.7 facilities, originally located at 2477 East Pike, on the east side of Zanesville, signed on January 5, 1983. It originally operated as WCVZ, a religious station owned by Christian Voice of Central Ohio.

The Christian Voice of Central Ohio had been serving Columbus and surrounding areas since 1972, with Christian programming on 104.9 WCVO-FM. Each station had an illuminated cross on the top of their broadcast tower.

WCVZ-FM programming was very similar to WCVO-FM, and featured many national Christian teaching, preaching, talk programs. These included Focus on the Family, with James Dobson, Turning Point, with Rev. David Jeremiah, Talk Back with Bob Larson, and many more. Seven days a week, a local &quot;Prayer Line&quot; program was broadcast, which invited listeners to share prayer needs, which would be prayed over by volunteer hosts.

Music programming consisted of a local morning drive and afternoon drive program, and the format was an eclectic mix of contemporary, praise, and southern gospel music. In a typical hour of drive time music, all three were featured in a continuous rotation. Friday evenings featured edgier youth oriented Contemporary Christian Music. Saturday evenings featured southern gospel music. Staff and volunteers produced several weekend music programs.

Several WCVZ on air hosts throughout the years include Robin (Sampson) Kelly, Chuck Case, Neil Snelling, Andy Shepherd, and Charles Rice. Locally produced weekend music shows included Gospel Ship (Farris Wilhite), Sunday Serenade (Charlie Swank), Street Light Radio (Michael Lanning), and Yesterday in Christian Music (Chuck Case).

WCVZ was known for including children&#x27;s programming on Saturday mornings. In 1994, the station began carrying &quot;The SonShine Radio Network&quot;, which broadcast children&#x27;s programming 24/7, via a subcarrier channel. Listeners could access the programming by purchasing a specially tuned receiver.

The station was also known for its &quot;Christmas Extravaganza&quot; that preempted most regular programming for two weeks each December. The &quot;Extravaganza&quot; featured many special Christmas radio productions, including vintage radio productions like &quot;A Christmas Carol&quot; from Campbells&#x27; Radio Playhouse.

WCVZ was underwritten by contributions from local businesses and the listening audience. Each September, &quot;Involvathon&quot; invited listeners to pledge gifts to provide for the station&#x27;s financial needs.

In 1994, a new transmitter site was constructed in rural Rose Farm, Ohio, where it remains today. The move allowed the station to increase its ERP from 6,000 watts to 16,000 watts.

In October 2001, WCVZ was relaunched as &quot;Joy FM&quot;. All previous programming was replaced by a 24 hour Contemporary Christian format. Michael James served as the morning show host.

On October 17, 2008, the Southeastern Ohio Broadcasting System, doing business as the WHIZ Media Group, announced the purchase of WCVZ, allowing 102.5 FM WHIZ to move out of the Zanesville area. Under a local marketing agreement, WCVZ then simulcast WHIZ-FM&#x27;s adult contemporary music format in preparation for this move until December 7, 2008, when WCVZ assumed WHIZ-FM&#x27;s identity as &quot;Z92&quot;, and WHIZ-FM became &quot;Highway 102&quot;, featuring an automated country music format.

When 102.5 FM moved to its new location serving Baltimore, Ohio, it took the WCVZ call sign from 92.7, allowing 92.7 to use the WHIZ-FM call sign.

Former owner Christian Voice of Central Ohio continues to serve the Zanesville area on WZNP (89.3 FM) licensed to Newark, Ohio, a part of the company&#x27;s &quot;River Radio Group&quot;. The WCVZ calls remained with WHIZ Media Group, and were used on 102.5 FM until December 23, 2010, when local marketing agreement operator Fun With Radio, LLC&#x27;s WWCD calls were moved to the frequency.

On October 2, 2014, WHIZ-FM transitioned from a hot adult contemporary format to contemporary hit radio. The Littick family announced the sale of the WHIZ Media Group, including WHIZ-FM, to Marquee Broadcasting on April 20, 2022; the deal was completed on July 15, 2022.

<doc id="745420" wikidata="Q5075487" url="?curid=745420" title="Charles Bean">
<text>Charles Edwin Woodrow Bean (18 November 1879 – 30 August 1968), usually identified as C. E. W. Bean, was a historian and one of Australia&#x27;s official war correspondents. 
He was editor and principal author of the 12-volume &quot;Official History of Australia in the War of 1914–1918&quot;, and a primary advocate for establishing the Australian War Memorial (AWM).

According to the &quot;Online International Encyclopedia of the First World War&quot;, no other Australian has been more influential in shaping the way the First World War is remembered in Australia.

When Bean died on 30 August 1968, aged 88, an obituary written by Guy Harriott, associate editor of &quot;The Sydney Morning Herald&quot; and a former war correspondent, described Bean as being &quot;one of Australia&#x27;s most distinguished men of letters&quot;.

== Early life and education ==
Charles Bean was born in Bathurst, New South Wales, the first of three sons of the Reverend Edwin Bean (1851–1922), then headmaster of All Saints&#x27; College, Bathurst, and Lucy Madeline Bean, née Butler (1852–1942).

In his paper &quot;Be Substantially Great in Thy Self: Getting to Know C.E.W. Bean: Barrister, Judge&#x27;s Associate, Moral Philosopher&quot;, Geoff Lindsay SC contended that Bean&#x27;s family and his formal education fostered his values which were influenced by &quot;The Arnold Tradition&quot;. This was the model of moral values and education championed by Dr Arnold of Rugby School, which emphasised individual self-worth and qualities associated with &quot;good character&quot;: trust and reliability, honesty, openness, self-discipline, self-reliance, independent thought and action, friendship, and concern for the common good over selfish or sectional interests&quot;. Further, according to Lindsay, Bean&#x27;s preoccupation with character was consistent with, if not a reflection of, the &quot;Arnold Tradition&quot;.
Bean&#x27;s formal education began in Australia at All Saints&#x27; College, Bathurst. In 1889, when Bean was nine, the family moved to England, where he was educated at Brentwood School, Essex (1891–1894), of which his father was the newly appointed headmaster. In 1894 Bean entered Clifton College, Bristol — his father&#x27;s alma mater, the ethos of which was also in the tradition of Arnold.

While at Clifton, Bean developed an interest in literature and in 1898 won a scholarship to Hertford College, Oxford, taking a Masters of Arts in 1903 and a Bachelor of Civil Law in 1904. During his schooling Bean served in the volunteer corps, both at Clifton College and at Oxford University.

==Early career==
In 1904, Bean taught at Brentwood and as a private tutor in Tenerife. Later that year he returned to Australia where he retained his parallel interests in teaching and writing, becoming an assistant master at Sydney Grammar School and writing articles for the &quot;Evening News&quot;, at that time edited by Andrew &#x27;Banjo&#x27; Paterson.

Admitted to the New South Wales Bar in 1905, Bean commenced his legal career in Australia as a barrister, and as a judge&#x27;s associate. As such he saw much of New South Wales on circuit in 1905–07 and, as Inglis noted, he was struck by the outback way of life.

In 1907, in his last days as a judge&#x27;s associate, he wrote articles about &quot;The Australian character&quot; which were published in the &quot;Sydney Morning Herald&quot; (&quot;SMH&quot;) under the banner &quot;Australia.&quot;

In 1908 Bean abandoned law for journalism and, at the suggestion of Paterson, applied to join the staff of the &quot;SMH&quot; 
In mid-1908, as a junior reporter he covered the waterside workers&#x27; strike and wrote a twelve-part series of articles on country NSW under the banner &#x27;Barrier Railway.&#x27;

Later in 1908, as a special correspondent for the &quot;SMH&quot; on HMS &quot;Powerful&quot;, the flagship of the Royal Navy squadron in Australia, Bean reported on the visit of the United States&#x27; Great White Fleet to Australia. The following year the articles were published in book form as &quot;With the Flagship in the South&quot; in which Bean advocated the establishment of an Australian Navy Fleet. The Imperial Naval Conference of 1909 decided that Australia should be advised to form her own Fleet unit, which occurred in 1911.

In 1909, Bean was sent by the &quot;SMH&quot; to far western New South Wales to write a series of articles on the wool industry. This event reinforced his views on the Australian character — mateship, resilience and laconic good humour in the face of adversity. Bean took that sense of an independent Australian character with him to war. His articles from this experience were subsequently reworked into two books: &quot;On the Wool Track,&quot; first published in 1910, reprinted many times and now accepted as an Australian classic, and the social documentary of the Darling River, &quot;The Dreadnought of the Darling&quot;, an account of his trip down the river on a small paddle steamer, first published in 1911.

In 1910, the &quot;SMH&quot; sent Bean to London as its representative. He travelled via America, writing a series of articles about the development of the cities he visited and the provision of open spaces. While in England, he continued this interest and took the opportunity to visit town planning experiments. In Scotland he was able to witness the building of the newly-established Australian fleet&#x27;s flagship, HMAS &quot;Australia&quot;, and the cruisers HMAS &quot;Melbourne&quot; and &quot;Sydney&quot;. His despatches to the &quot;SMH&quot; describing their construction were later incorporated in &quot;Flagships Three&quot; which was published in 1913.

Early in 1913, Bean returned to Sydney as a leader-writer for the &quot;SMH&quot;, continuing to write about town planning and the steps that should be taken to control the city&#x27;s future development. Among his initiatives was his call for a Chair of Town Planning and Architecture at Sydney University and for the resumption of land to allow a necessary expansion of the city&#x27;s railways.

Bean&#x27;s &quot;The Great Rivers&quot; series for the &quot;SMH&quot; was published in May 1914. At the outbreak of World War I, he was investigating social conditions in Aboriginal communities, intending to publish a series of articles on that topic. By mid-1914 however, he was writing a daily commentary on the crisis in Europe.

==World War I==

Following the declaration of war by Britain, and Australian forces becoming involved, the Australian Government requested the Australian Journalists&#x27; Association to nominate an official correspondent to accompany the Australian Imperial Force (A.I.F). In September 1914 Bean was elected by his peers, defeating Keith Murdoch in the national ballot. He became an embedded correspondent, whose despatches, reporting on Australia&#x27;s participation in the war, were to be available to all Australian newspapers and published in the Commonwealth of Australia Gazette.
He was accorded the honorary mess rank of captain, provided with a batman and driver and was required to submit his despatches to the British censor. On advice, however, he retained his civilian status in order to be free of unnecessary military restrictions in carrying out his duties as a correspondent. Whatever he wrote was to be subject to rigid censorship.

Senator George Pearce, Minister for Defence in the Commonwealth Labor Government, told Bean before he sailed to the war that he hoped Bean would write the history of the Australian part in it on his return to Australia. Bean’s work habits throughout the war were predicated on gathering material for that purpose. On 21 October 1914, Bean left Australia on the troopship HMAT &quot;Orvieto,&quot; which carried Major General Bridges and his headquarters. He was accompanied by Private Arthur Bazley, his formally designated batman, who became his invaluable assistant, researcher, lifelong friend and, later, acting Director of the AWM.

During the course of the war, although Bean developed close relationships with senior commanders, he was never far from the front line, reporting on the activities of the A.I.F. he could personally witness. He would position himself with his telescope &quot;about 1,200 yards from (or, on Gallipoli, almost right in) the frontline.&quot;

As well as reporting, Bean kept an almost daily diary record of events. These diary entries also reflected the feelings and views of an individual who witnessed those events which ranged from battles to planning and discussions in headquarters, and to men at rest and in training. He regarded his diaries as the foundation of the official history, “especially for the detail of what happened in and immediately behind the front line”. In later years he reviewed his diary comments and sometimes revised his wartime opinions, but the immediacy of each diary entry provides insight into the times and conditions as he was experiencing them.

Bean was aware of the limitations of the diaries and of eyewitness accounts. As a condition of the gift of his papers to the AWM in 1942 he stipulated that it attach to every diary and notebook a caveat which was amended in 1948 to read, in part: &#x27;These records should … be used with great caution, as relating only what their author, at the time of writing, believed&#x27;.

=== Egypt ===
Bean arrived in Egypt on 3 December 1914. He was asked by Senior A.I.F. Command to write a booklet, &quot;What to Know in Egypt … A Guide for Australian Soldiers&quot;, to help the troops better understand their new environment. Despite the advice contained in the guide &quot;a handful of rowdies&quot; was sent home from Egypt. Bean was asked to send a report covering the issue. The resulting newspaper coverage aroused concern with families in Australia and resentment towards him from among the troops in Egypt.

===Gallipoli Campaign===
Bean landed on Gallipoli about 10 am on 25 April 1915, a few hours after the dawn attack.

The Australian Dictionary of Biography entry on Bean notes: &quot;Australians at home read a detailed account of the landing in the papers of 8 May. It was not by Bean, whose first dispatch was held up by the British authorities in Alexandria until 13 May, but by the English correspondent Ellis Ashmead-Bartlett. Both accounts were reprinted many times. Bean&#x27;s was the more precise, for he had seen more. The English reporter betrayed surprise that untrained colonials had done so well; Bean was seeing what he hoped to see: the Australian soldiers, as he described them, were displaying qualities he had observed out in the country&quot;.

For the help he gave to wounded men under fire on the night of 8 May 1915 during the Australian charge at Krithia, Bean was recommended for the Military Cross, for which as a civilian he was not eligible. He was, however, Mentioned in Despatches. His bravery erased whatever hostility remained from his report from Egypt about those soldiers who were sent home. During the August Offensive, the last British throw at the Dardanelles, Bean was shot in the thigh. Reluctant to relinquish his post at a time of activity he refused to be evacuated from the peninsula to a hospital ship, convalescing in his dugout. The bullet remained lodged within millimetres of his femoral artery for the rest of his life.

The only Allied correspondent who stayed on Gallipoli throughout the campaign, Bean sent a stream of stories back to his newspapers. &quot;While some editors&quot;, according to The Oxford Companion to Australian Military History, &quot;complained that Bean’s despatches were insufficiently graphic, his writing was sober and painstakingly accurate and sought to convey within the limitations imposed on him, something of the experience of the Australians at the front.&quot;
As no official photographer was appointed to cover Gallipoli, Bean also recorded events with a camera. The AWM&#x27;s official photograph collection contains 1100 of his prints covering the first convoy, Egypt and Gallipoli.

Bean left Gallipoli on the night of 17 December 1915, watching and recording from the deck of HMS &quot;Grafton&quot; the final evacuation of A.I.F. troops from Anzac Cove.
Bazley had left for the island of Imbros on the previous night with 150 pieces of art, prose and verse, created under conditions of extreme hardship by soldiers in the trenches, and intended for a New Year magazine. The evacuation led to a change of plan — they would be published in the form of a book. Besides acting as editor, Bean contributed photographs, drawings, and two pieces of verse: &#x27;Abdul&#x27;, portraying the Turk as an honourable opponent, and &#x27;Non Nobis&#x27;, questioning why some, including Bean himself, had survived and others not. &quot;The Anzac Book&quot;, published in London in May 1916, became a reminder of the endurance, reckless bravery and humour in adversity that epitomised &#x27;the Anzac spirit&#x27;.

Although &quot;The Anzac Book&quot; presented a specially crafted image of the Anzac soldier, Bean did not want the historical record altered because of selective editing for its initial intended purpose. In February 1917, he wrote to the War Records Office with a suggestion that important documents – such as &quot;The Anzac Book&quot; manuscript and rejected contributions – be preserved so that they could one day be deposited in a museum. This request was granted and all contributions can now be viewed in the AWM&#x27;s archives.

=== Western Front ===

In late March 1916, Bean sailed with the A.I.F. from Egypt to France, where he reported on all but one of the engagements involving Australian soldiers. As evidenced by his diary entries, he moved back and forth along the Western Front with the Australian troops, often at the frontline under fire, running from shell hole to shell hole for protection. He sent press despatches back to Australia, continuing to record military actions, conversations, interviews, and the evidence of &quot;what actual experiences, at the point where men lay out behind hedges or on the fringe of woods, caused those on one side to creep, walk, or run forward, and the others to go back&quot;.

The website of the Sir John Monash Centre notes that Bean’s editorial opinions often contradicted military authorities, yet he was highly respected. Bean observed the &quot;fog of war&quot; (communication breakdown between commanders in the rear and troops at the frontline) and he described the devastating effects of shellshock. Intense artillery fire, he said, ripped away the conventions of psychological shelter and left men &quot;with no other protection than the naked framework of their character&quot;, an experience too much for many. The Centre’s website further notes that Bean&#x27;s reputation and influence grew and, in 1916, he was granted access to British Army war diaries, a privilege not extended to some British historians.

Having missed the poorly conceived and executed attack at Fromelles on 19 July 1916, the first big Australian action in France which had resulted in heavy losses, Bean was there the following morning moving among survivors getting their stories. It was the fallen at Fromelles to whom Bean dedicated his &quot;Letters from France,&quot; a selection of his first-hand observations from the Western Front published in 1917. The dedication reads; &quot;To those other Australians who fell in the Sharpest Action their Force has known, on July 19, 1916, before Fromelles, these Memories of a Greater, but not a Braver, Battle are herewith Dedicated&quot;.&quot; &quot;The author&#x27;s profits from the book were devoted to the fund for nursing back to useful citizenship Australians blinded or maimed in the war.&quot;

Several days after the battle of Fromelles ended, Bean witnessed the battle of Pozières. Over several weeks he was on the ground and sometimes in the trenches as the fighting raged. The experience shook him as it revealed the horror and destruction of modern warfare. The heavy casualties incurred there almost broke the back of the all-volunteer A.I.F. Bean recorded in his diary: &#x27;Pozieres is one vast Australian cemetery&#x27;.

The carnage on the Somme caused Bean to conceive the idea of a memorial where Australia could commemorate its war dead and view the relics its troops collected. Bean had noticed as early as the Gallipoli campaign that Australian soldiers were avid collectors of battlefield souvenirs and imagined a museum where they would be displayed. Several months after the fighting at Pozières, Bean returned to retrace the battle where he collected the first relics for what would eventually become the AWM.

Subsequently, at Bean&#x27;s prompting, the Australian War Records Section (AWRS) was established in London in May 1917, under the command of Lieutenant, later Lieutenant Colonel, John Treloar. The Section&#x27;s task was to collect and organise the documentary record of the Australian forces, so that it could be preserved for Australia, rather than be absorbed into Britain&#x27;s records. Over the next two years, the AWRS acquired approximately 25,000 objects, termed by Bean as &#x27;relics&#x27;, as well as paper records, photographs, film, publications, and works of art. These were brought back to Australia in 1919 and formed the basis of the collection of the AWM. Treloar, who was later appointed the AWM&#x27;s Director, contributed more than any other person to the realisation of Bean&#x27;s AWM vision.

Bean believed that photography was essential to the work of a modern historian, taking his own photographs on Gallipoli. On the Western Front, private cameras were banned in British armies. After lobbying, Bean succeeded in mid–1917 in having two Australians commissioned as official photographers to the A.I.F: polar adventurers Frank Hurley and Hubert Wilkins. Bean and Hurley, however, had opposing ideas, particularly over composite images some of which have become classics of the genre and priceless insights into the nature of the Great War. But for Bean the quest was for accuracy and honesty rather than artistry.

Bean, with Treloar, was also involved in the program for employing Australian war artists. Among those were Will Dyson (1880–1938) and George Lambert (1873–1930), who were already living in London, and Frank Crozier (1883–1948) who was already serving with the AIF.

In these three initiatives, namely the establishment of the AWRS, the commissioning of official Australian war artists, and the commissioning of official Australian war photographers, Captain H. C. Smart of the Australian High Commission in London played an important part.

Bean was further involved in the administration of the A.I.F., contributing to the formation and development of the A.I.F. Educational scheme for returning soldiers which was established in May 1918, with Bishop George Long as its inaugural Director of Education.

In 1918, when a successor to General Birdwood as commander of the Australian Corps was being chosen, Bean intervened on behalf of General Brudenell White, Birdwood&#x27;s Chief Staff Officer. According to Chadwick, Bean was one of many who considered that White, not General John Monash, should have the corps command. In his last book, &quot;Two Men I Knew: William Bridges and Brudenell White, Founders of the A.I.F.&quot; Bean told the story, related also in volume VI of the &quot;Official History&quot;, of his own &quot;high-intentioned but ill-judged intervention&quot; in this matter. Kelly viewed that intervention as having been, nonetheless, motivated by what Bean believed to be in the best interests of the A.I.F.

In correspondence to Brudenell White (28 June 1918) Bean wrote about the importance to Australia of a planned repatriation of the troops: &quot;To me repatriation means the future of Australia&quot;. Later, in October 1918, Bean urged Prime Minister, William Hughes, &quot;that it was all important to get some plan drawn up by the A.I.F. at the earliest possible moment – put Monash in charge – Birdwood is not the man for it at all. It was urgent, I said, if they did not want a catastrophe&quot;. Ten days after the armistice, on 21 November 1918, Monash was brought to London to be Director General of the A.I.F. Department of Demobilisation and Repatriation, taking command formally on 4 December.

On 11 November 1918, Armistice Day, Bean&#x27;s diary records that he returned to Fromelles with a photographer to revisit the battlefields where over two years earlier on the night of 19–20 July 1916, the Australians had endured their brutal introduction of warfare on the Western Front: &quot;...we found the old no man&#x27;s land simply full of our dead”. Bean returned to Melbourne with the returning troops on the transport &quot;Kildonan Castle&quot; in May 1919.

The Online International Encyclopedia of the First World War notes that &quot;Bean was the only Australian correspondent who was with the A.I.F. for the duration of Australia&#x27;s involvement in the War, from Gallipoli to the last battles Australia fought on the Western Front, a feat which had few parallels elsewhere in the Empire&quot;. In an article subtitled &quot;Tribute to Mr Bean&quot; in the Sydney Morning Herald on 9 June 1919, Sir Brudenell White said: &quot;That man faced death more times than any other man in the A.I.F., and had no glory to look for either. What he did – and he did wonders – was done from a pure sense of duty.&quot;

==Post-war==

Whilst still in France at the end of 1918 when the Germans were seeking an armistice, Bean resumed thinking of a post war Australia. He took leave and in several weeks wrote and published his tract, &quot;In Your Hands, Australians&quot;, exhorting Australians to pursue the aims of peace with the dedication, organisation and tenacity with which they had fought the war. He asked &quot;What can we do for Australia in the long peace which many who will not return have helped to win?&quot; Of the tract he wrote: &quot;….this little book is written to suggest a few ways in which every man, woman, and child can live for his country; ways in which you can all enlist in this great, generous fight for Australia, to place and keep your country, if possible, amongst the greatest countries in the world.&quot; 
In the tract Bean urged the creation of an &quot;Anglo-Saxon nation of free, happy brilliant people&quot;. At the time of writing it, Bean was a supporter of the White Australia ideology which, Rees has noted, he [Bean] would revisit and re-evaluate over the years ahead. Inglis also noted that &quot;The sense of values established in [Bean’s] boyhood remained constant; some of the opinions he derived from it were still changing. Before 1914 he had employed serenely the notion of an English race, and briskly defended White Australia.…By 1949 he was arguing for admission of limited numbers of immigrants from Asia rather than perpetrating a &#x27;quite senseless colour line&#x27;.&quot; In his essay &quot;Racism in Australia – A Contribution to the Debate&quot;, Ellis has charted Bean&#x27;s shift from support for a &quot;White Australia&quot; before World War I to a multi-racial immigration policy after experience of two World Wars and the horror of Nazi racialism.

Bean also envisaged a future Australia as being an agrarian society with millions of farms which thinking was, according to Bolleter, &quot;in the ascendant until the mid-twentieth century and beyond&quot;.

Despite Bean&#x27;s interest at the outbreak of World War I in investigating social conditions in Aboriginal communities to publish a series of articles, Aboriginal Australians are not mentioned in his vision or referred to by him in his text, but neither are they necessarily excluded from his vision or the text. There are instances in the tract where Bean uses inclusive language such as: &quot;…the making of a nation is in the hands of every man and woman, every boy and girl&quot;, and &quot;We must plan for the education of every person in the State in body, mind and character&quot;.

In London prior to his departure and on the boat voyage home, Bean put into writing his proposals for the official history and for a national war museum which he envisaged not only as the repository of official pictures, photographs, maps, records, dioramas and relics from the battlefield but also as a national memorial to Australians who had died in the War.

===The Australian Historical Mission===

In February–March 1919, on his homeward journey, Bean led a group of eight Australians including artist George Lambert, photographer Hubert Wilkins, and scribe John Balfour on a visit to Gallipoli. The aim of the group, the Australian Historical Mission, was to carry out research on the battlefields of the 1915 Anzac campaign; create new works of art and photographs to help convey the story of the trauma and tragedy; collect sacred relics; discuss a plan for the Gallipoli war graves, and to obtain from the Turks their story of the fighting. The mission was the subject of Bean&#x27;s &quot;Gallipoli Mission&quot; (1952), but he gave a good summary of its scope in a contemporary newspaper interview.

Bean returned to Australia in May 1919 after an absence of four and a half years.

===The Official History of Australia in the War of 1914–1918===

With a small staff, Bean took up his appointment as official historian in 1919, based first in the rural setting of Tuggeranong homestead, near the then unbuilt Federal Capital, Canberra, and later at Victoria Barracks, Sydney. The central stipulation that Bean laid down when he became official historian was that the history was to be free from government censorship, though he had to yield when the Australian Commonwealth Naval Board insisted on removing critical passages from Volume IX, A. W. Jose&#x27;s &quot;The Royal Australian Navy&quot;.

In 1916, the British War Cabinet had agreed to grant Dominion official historians access to the war diaries of all British Army units fighting on either side of a Dominion unit, as well as all headquarters that issued orders to Dominion units, including the GHQ of the British Expeditionary Force. By the end of the war, the Committee of Imperial Defence (CID) was less than willing to divulge this information, possibly fearing it would be used to criticise the conduct of the war. It took six years of persistence before Bean was allowed access and a further three years for a clerk to make copies of the enormous quantity of documents. Bean therefore had available to him resources that were denied to all British historians who were not associated with the Historical Section of the CID.

Bean was unwilling to compromise his values for personal gain or political expediency. He was not influenced by suggestions and criticism from British official historian, Sir James Edmonds, about the direction of his work. Edmonds reported to the CID that, &quot;The general tone of Bean&#x27;s narrative is deplorable from the Imperial standpoint.&quot; For his stance, it is likely that Bean was denied decorations from King George V, despite being recommended on two occasions during the war by the commander of the Australian Corps. Many years later when he was offered a knighthood, he declined.

As noted by Inglis, Bean had no exact model for the history he wanted to write. Bean wrote in &quot;Our War History&quot; published in &quot;The Bulletin&quot; in May 1942: &quot;We knew that – because of the opportunities given to us during the war of seeing what really happened at the cutting edge of battle as well as headquarters - Harry Gullett, Cutlack and I had material for a new kind of war history.&quot;

According to Stanley, in writing the Official History Bean was animated by a guiding principle: that the history was to be a memorial to those who had served, suffered and died, and the question which Bean set out to explore, as he later explained, was &quot;how did the Australian people … come through the first universally recognised test of this, their first great war?&quot; It was answered by his conclusion that through service and sacrifice in the war &quot;Australia became fully conscious of itself as a nation.&quot;
Partly reflecting his background as a journalist, Bean concentrated on both the ordinary soldier and the big themes of the First World War. The smaller size of the Australian Army contingent (240,000) allowed him to describe the action in many cases down to the level of individuals, which suited his theme that the achievement of the Australian Army was the story of those individuals as much as it was of generals or politicians.

With his interest in the Australian character, Bean used the history to describe, and in some way create, a somewhat idealised view of an Australian character that looked back at its British origins but had also broken free from the limitations of that society. As cited by Inglis, Bean later wrote in &quot;In Your Hands, Australians&quot;: &quot;It was character which rushed the hills at Gallipoli and held on there during the long afternoon and night, when everything seemed to have gone wrong and there was only the barest hope of success ...&quot;

In compiling the official history archivist Piggott has recorded that &quot;Bean and his research assistants &#x27;digested&#x27; an outstanding quantity of official and personal records.&quot; Bean&#x27;s paper to the Royal Australian Historical Society in 1938, &quot;The Writing of the Official History of Great War – Sources, Methods and Some Conclusions&quot; provided a list of forty main classes of records on which the work was based. One of the sources was the 45,000 responses to the 60,000 questionnaires (&quot;Roll of Honour&quot; forms) sent out in 1919 to the &quot;next of kin of the fallen&quot;, for the personal footnotes of the histories which, as Bean recorded, “have been noted by critics as an interesting and peculiar feature of the work”. In the matter of maps illustrating the text, Bean also recorded that &quot;the Australian history adopted its own system&quot; with the creation of detailed &quot;tiny scale&quot; maps able to be inserted into the margin of the relevant page of the history: &quot;It was the only means by which we could illustrate practically every movement described … on its own page (thus avoiding) the necessity for numerous large maps, likely to be quickly torn and lost&quot;.

The first two volumes of the history, &quot;The Story of Anzac&quot;, appeared in 1921 and 1924 respectively. Bean wrote both volumes, together with the next four on the A.I.F. in France. He edited the remaining six and, with H. S. Gullett, annotated the photographic volume (Volume XII). The last volume written by Bean, Volume VI, appeared in 1942. Its final paragraph recorded: &quot;What these men did nothing can alter now. The good and the bad, the greatness and smallness of their story will stand. Whatever of glory it contains nothing now can lessen. It rises, as it will always rise, above the mists of ages, a monument to great-hearted men; and, for their nation, a possession for ever.&quot;

In Stanley&#x27;s view Bean&#x27;s history is neither definitive nor flawless noting that he tended to lionise those whom he admired and to omit what he found uncomfortable. Grey further noted in &quot;Bean and official history&quot; that the history&#x27;s &quot;strengths are those of Bean the journalist; so are its weaknesses. His focus on the tactical level and front line experiences of the men meant there was little or nothing on training, doctrine, logistics, organisation or administration – all the things that make modern armies functional and successful armies victorious.&quot; Bean had earlier conceded that &quot;no technical histories were undertaken under the scheme drafted by me&quot; and that the &quot;Editor and writers had to decide with what general aims we should write. No history can tell the reader everything about its subject.&quot;

According to Pegram, historians generally agree that Bean&#x27;s belief in rural virtues does not adequately explain how the AIF transformed from an organisation of neophytes in 1914 to the effective fighting force that contributed to Germany’s defeat in 1918.

Nevertheless, Stanley maintained that while later studies have elaborated, revised and challenged many aspects of it, the Official History retains its integrity as the single greatest source of interpretation of Australia’s part in the First World War.

Bean also contributed the Australian section to volume three of Sir Charles Lucas&#x27; &quot;The Empire at War&quot;, Oxford, 1924.

=== Australian War Memorial ===
Bean&#x27;s idea was to create a national memorial where families and friends could grieve for those buried in places far away, as well as being a place that would contribute to an understanding of war itself. Accordingly, the style of the AWM reflects Bean&#x27;s desire for the building to at once be museum, monument, memorial, temple and shrine to Australians who lost their lives and suffered as a result of war. Bean&#x27;s vision for the AWM appears on the wall inside its front doors: &quot;Here is their spirit, in the heart of the land they loved; and here we guard the record which they themselves made.&quot;

The heart of the AWM – the Hall of Memory - embodies its spirit and aim. Its Napier Waller designed and executed stained glass windows depict the quintessential qualities, informing character of Australia&#x27;s fighting men and women, namely personal qualities: Resource, Candour, Devotion, Curiosity, Independence; social qualities: Comradeship, Ancestry, Patriotism, Chivalry, Loyalty; and fighting qualities: Coolness, Control, Audacity, Endurance, Decision - collectively referred to as the Anzac Spirit.

The AWM had been Bean&#x27;s conception emerging from the horror that the A.I.F. had endured at Pozieres in 1916. In 1919 an Australian War Museum committee was established with the hope that Bean would become the first director of the Memorial (the term now being used) as well as official historian, but it was evident to Bean that he could not undertake both tasks. H. S. Gullett (later Sir Henry), who had been in charge of the AWRS in Egypt and a war correspondent in Palestine, was appointed director. Bean and Lieutenant-Colonel Treloar conceived that the memorial and museum functions were philosophically and operationally inseparable and, with Gullett, they were to guide its creation and operations over a 40 year period.

From selecting the site in 1919, Bean worked on creating the AWM, and was present when the building opened on 11 November 1941. He served continuously as a member of the AWM Board from 1919 and was its chairman from 1952 to 1959 remaining on the Board until 1963. As the general editor and principal author of the Official History Bean was also associated with the AWM as publisher and as a donor and adviser on the collections including post-war art commissions. According to Piggott &quot;Dr Bean ..more than any other individual, expounded the philosophy of commemoration through exhibits, documentary collections and the roll of honour”. In the 1950s Bean drew up a list of exhibition principles, suggesting among other things that the galleries should &quot;avoid glorification of war and boasting of victory&quot; and &quot;perpetuating enmity … for both moral and national reasons and because those who have fought in wars are generally strongest in their desire to prevent war.&quot;

== Further post-war works: war-related; civil-related; publications ==

Both during and after the years in which he was engaged in the writing and editing of the Official History and in his work with the AWM, Bean promoted his ideals in various fields of national interest. Most reflected his concern to improve the nature of Australian society and the welfare of its people, particularly in relation to education, causing him to be described by Rees as a &quot;social missionary&quot;. Other Bean interests were linked with his wartime and pre-war occupations.

In some of the societies and organisations formed around these interests and occupations Bean held official positions: councillor of the National Fitness Council of New South Wales for ten years; councillor of the Town Planning Association of New South Wales; president of the New South Wales Institute of Journalists; vice–president of the Recreation and Leadership Movement; chairman of the NSW Standing Committee on Community Centres; member of the Australian Services Education Council; chairman of the Promotions Appeal Board of the Australian Broadcasting Commission (1947 to 1958) and vice president of the United Nations Association, NSW.

In support of these interests, Bean wrote to the press, maintained an output of articles (mostly for soldiers&#x27; journals), gave lectures and occasional broadcasts.

Underscoring his concern for open spaces and the natural environment, in 1930 he established the Parks and Playgrounds Movement of NSW and became the Movement&#x27;s honorary secretary. Its aims included the provision of suitable public spaces to enable sports, especially team sports; the preservation of adequate passive recreational spaces and reserves for flora and fauna; ensuring that existing and future parks and reserves were properly used; and maintaining the right of all Australians to enjoy the natural beauties of Australia and of healthy open-air sport and play.

In 1932 Bean persuaded the AWM to buy the Pozieres windmill ruins in France. In July 1916 he had written that the Pozieres ridge &quot;was more densely sown with Australian sacrifice than any other spot on earth&quot;. Today the site, a place of pilgrimage, is in the care of the Commonwealth War Graves Commission with a memorial tablet bearing Bean&#x27;s words.

Bean was an active member of the League of Nations Union, believing in the League as guardian of peace. Horror of war led him to support Chamberlain&#x27;s conciliation of Hitler in the hope that Hitler would keep his pledges. He retained that hope until the German invasion of Czechoslovakia. On 21 March 1939 in a letter which appeared in the &quot;S.M.H&quot; under the heading &quot;Recantation&quot;, Bean withdrew that support for Chamberlain’s position.

In 1940, with the Second A.I.F. at war, Bean wrote a pamphlet called &quot;The Old A.I.F and the New.&quot; In that same year he was employed by the Federal Department of Information to provide liaison between the chiefs of staff and the press.

Bean was also involved in the creation of the National Archives of Australia. In 1942 on retiring as Official War Historian of the First World War, he accepted Prime Minister Curtin&#x27;s invitation to chair what was then known as the War Archives Committee to recommend procedures for the collection and preservation of records created during the Second World War. Bean, along with other historians, had lobbied for this initiative as prior to that time Australia possessed no national archives resulting in World War I records being destroyed. After the war, during Bean&#x27;s seventeen year chairmanship, the Committee expanded its scope to include all Commonwealth records thereby establishing the foundations for the management of the official records of the Commonwealth of Australia.

In 1943 Bean published &quot;War Aims of a Plain Australian.&quot; Its message was much the same as that of &quot;In Your Hands, Australians&quot;: &quot;May we all play the game with larger wisdom than in 1918 and with our whole strength, so as to win not only the war but the peace – this time&quot;.

After some unsuccessful lobbying, Bean persuaded the Curtin Government to sponsor a history of the Second World War, recommending the appointment of journalist Gavin Long (son of Bishop Long, above) as official historian. Subsequently, in 1943, Long was appointed general editor of the Official History of Australia in the Second World War, which eventually comprised five series totalling twenty-two volumes of which he, Long, wrote three volumes.

Bean was a member of a committee of twenty-one representative citizens in Sydney, who in 1943, wrote to Prime Minister Curtin commending the Kimberley plan (a Jewish Settlement Proposal in the Kimberley) pointing out that &quot;Australia should acknowledge her increased moral and political responsibilities to the world at large, and extend all possible aid to persecuted peoples.&quot; The proposal was ultimately unsuccessful.

In 1944 Bean wrote the &quot;Anzac Requiem&quot; – a short meditation on Australian service and sacrifice in both World War I and the then current World War II. Bean recorded it in August 1946 for radio broadcast on Anzac Day, 25 April 1947, and possibly on subsequent Anzac Days.

In 1946 Bean produced a single-volume history of the Great War, &quot;Anzac to Amiens: A Shorter History of the Australian Fighting Services in the First World War&quot;. It contained the following statement: &quot;Anzac stood, and still stands, for reckless valour in a good cause, for enterprise, resourcefulness, fidelity, comradeship, and endurance that will never own defeat&quot;, thereby outlining what has become known as the Anzac tradition.

In 1948 Bean&#x27;s &quot;Gallipoli Mission&quot; was published. It told the story of the visit by the members of the Historical Mission to Gallipoli in 1919. The Mission had retraced the landing and the fight up the range, and with the assistance of a Turkish officer, Major Zeki Bey who served through the campaign, was able to follow the Turk defence system.

In 1950 Bean&#x27;s commissioned history of the independent corporate schools of Australia was published. The strength of &quot;The Arnold Tradition&quot;, as Bean there labelled it, is manifest in it. The title, &quot;Here, My Son&quot; was derived from Sir Henry Newbolt&#x27;s poem on the chapel at Clifton, Bean&#x27;s former school in England.

In 1951 Bean and his wife visited England and when they returned to Australia it was by a migrant ship, on which Bean was employed as a migration officer.

Towards the end of his life Bean planned to write a series of biographies but only one was written: &quot;Two Men I Knew: William Bridges and Brudenell White, Founders of the A.I.F.&quot;, which was published in 1957. It was his last book.

==Honours==
Bean did not seek personal honours. He declined a knighthood on more than one occasion but accepted other acknowledgments and honours for his work. In 1913 The Royal Society of the Arts awarded him its Silver Medal. He was Mentioned in Despatches (1915). In 1930, the Royal United Services Institute awarded him the Chesney Gold Medal. In the same year the University of Melbourne awarded him its degree of D.Litt. and in 1959 he was awarded an Honorary Doctorate of Laws by the Australian National University, an institution which he had been one of the first to foresee.

==Legacy==
Bean was admitted to Concord Repatriation Hospital in Sydney in 1964 suffering from dementia and died on 30 August 1968.

===Military Contribution and Civil Contribution===
====Bean&#x27;s Personal Papers and his Life Story====
The significance of Bean&#x27;s papers held by the AWM (and the State Library of NSW) was recognised by their listing on the 2021 UNESCO Memory of the World Programme. The listing citation states, inter alia: &quot;They document his role as one of the founders of the Australian War Memorial and other civic institutions, and are regarded as fundamental to an understanding of critical aspects of Australian identity and commemorative practices.&quot; Piggott has referred to the papers as &quot;riches&quot; and in the AWM publication, &quot;A guide to the Personal Family and Official papers of CEW Bean&quot;, has noted that they occupy 27 metres and document &quot;practically every aspect of his life.&quot; Lindsay has recognised the scope and significance of Bean’s papers as providing &quot;a resource for the study of Australian society, not limited to military affairs, during the course of his [Bean&#x27;s] long life&quot; observing that his &quot;constancy of character, his personal growth in the opinions he held, and his role in shaping national opinion provide a means of calibrating national change.&quot;

====Bean&#x27;s First World War notebooks, diaries and folders====
According to the Australian Media Hall of Fame: &quot;It is his [Bean&#x27;s] extraordinary, painstakingly detailed (and often harrowing) private notes and diaries written during the war that remain one of his greatest achievements.&quot; Their significance was recorded in the 2021 UNESCO Memory of the World Register: &quot;The heart of the (Bean) collection is an irreplaceable set of 286 diaries and notebooks that recount Australia&#x27;s part in the First World War. They describe the activities, conditions and experiences of the Australian Imperial Force (AIF) from the perspective of an eye-witness and a journalist who sought the best possible evidence from a wide range of participants, including enlisted men of all ranks, the military hierarchy and political decision-makers.&quot;

====The Official History of Australia in the War of 1914–1918====
The AWM website recognises that Bean’s work on the Official History established the tradition and set the standard for subsequent Australian official war histories and that the work is still used as an essential reference, often as a starting point for research today, because of Bean’s command of the sources and the clarity of his narrative. Bean&#x27;s history is further described as &quot;notable&quot; because &quot;it was the work of a participant, one who instigated the collection of the archive on which it was based, and was the product of an individual vision of one man who worked with a tiny staff of co-authors and dedicated colleagues&quot;.

====The Australian War Memorial, Canberra.====
The AWM has been listed on the Australian National Heritage Register. The AWM is unique in that it combines a shrine, museum, and an extensive archive.

====The Anzac Tradition and Charles Bean&#x27;s role in the construction of Australia&#x27;s cultural identity====
The citation for the listing of Bean’s papers on the 2021 UNESCO Memory of the World Register includes the following: &quot;In his writings and especially in the Australian War Memorial, Bean presented the story of the AIF as a basis for national pride that resonates to this day. Anyone seeking to understand how the newly federated nation of Australia sought to establish its own identity, loyal to Britain but with a distinct national character, must consult these records.&quot; In marking the centenary of Federation in 2001 the Sydney Morning Herald published &quot;One Hundred Most Influential Australians of the Century&quot; in which Charles Bean was stated &quot;as probably doing more than anyone to foster a sense of Australian nationhood&quot;.

====The National Archives of Australia====
The National Archives of Australia for which Bean was a leading advocate contains more than 40 million items, mainly Australian Government records from Federation in 1901 to the present - records about key events and decisions that have shaped Australian history. The collection is considered irreplaceable.

====Parks and Playgrounds Movement NSW====
As the founder of this movement, Bean was instrumental in bringing together the early town planning and conservation movements and ensuring the establishment of a network of green spaces throughout the Greater Sydney Region. These green spaces ranged from playgrounds and sporting fields to public gardens and bushland-parks.

== Personal life ==

In St Andrew&#x27;s Cathedral, Sydney, on 24 January 1921, Bean married Ethel Clara &quot;Effie&quot; Young of Tumbarumba, acting matron at Queanbeyan Hospital during the time Bean worked at Tuggeranong. Officiating at the ceremony was Albert Talbot, the Cathedral&#x27;s Dean, whom Bean had known as an A.I.F. chaplain. Effie died in Sydney in 1991, aged 97 years. The Beans adopted a daughter, Joyce, who was their only child.

<doc id="745422" wikidata="Q322400" url="?curid=745422" title="Ableton Live">
<text>Ableton Live is a digital audio workstation for macOS and Windows developed by the German company Ableton. 

In contrast to many other software sequencers, Live is designed to be an instrument for live performances as well as a tool for composing, recording, arranging, mixing, and mastering. It is also used by DJs, as it offers a suite of controls for beatmatching, crossfading, and other different effects used by turntablists, and was one of the first music applications to automatically beatmatch songs.

Live is available directly from Ableton in three editions: Intro (with fewer features), Standard, and Suite (with the most features). The Suite edition includes &quot;Max for Live&quot; functionality, developed in partnership with Cycling &#x27;74.

Ableton has also made a fourth version of Live, Lite, with similar limitations to Intro, which is only available bundled with a range of music production hardware, including MIDI controllers and audio interfaces.

==History==
Live was created by Gerhard Behles, Robert Henke and Bernd Roggendorf in the mid-1990s. Behles and Henke met while studying programming at Technische Universität Berlin, and wrote software in the music programming language Max to perform techno as their band Monolake. Henke and Behles identified a need in Berlin&#x27;s electronic music scene for user-friendly software for live performances, and worked with local acts to develop it. Though Live was not developed in Max, Max was used to prototype most of its features. 

Henke said later of Live&#x27;s creation, &quot;I think the feeling we had was [that] there was enough like-minded people in our closer community who could appreciate a product like this, and that it could work commercially. That gave us confidence to believe that a small company could actually survive on the market.&quot; He said one of the first industry figures to recognize Live&#x27;s potential was the Hollywood composer Hans Zimmer, who was impressed by Live&#x27;s ability to change the tempo of a loop without altering its pitch. Roggendorf, another programmer, joined Behles and Henke in the late 90s and helped them turn their Max patches into a general set of software for retail. They released the first commercial version of Live on October 30, 2001. 

Unlike Pro Tools, which focuses on multitrack recording, the first version of Live was designed for performing live with loops. It offered sophisticated tools for triggering loops, playing samples and time stretching audio, and was immediately popular with electronic music producers. Live&#x27;s time stretching algorithm, known as &quot;Warping&quot;, was particularly notable and gave DJs greater control over mixing and beatmatching, smoothly blending tracks of different tempos. 

In 2004, Live expanded to become a DAW with a MIDI sequencer and support for virtual studio technology (VST). 

In 2010, Ableton introduced Max for Live, enabling connectivity between Max and Live. Live made it easier for musicians to use computers as instruments in live performance without programming their own software, influencing the rise of global festival culture in the 2000s.

In 2016, Henke left Ableton to concentrate on his artistic project Monolake. 
== Features ==

===Views===
Live&#x27;s user interface is composed of two &#x27;Views&#x27; – Session View and Arrangement View. Live utilizes audio samples or MIDI sequences, referred to as Clips, which are arranged to be played live (i.e. &quot;launched&quot;) or played back in a pre-arranged order. MIDI information received by Live can trigger notes on Live&#x27;s built in instruments, as well as third party VST instruments or external hardware.

Session View offers a grid-based representation of all of the Clips in a Live Set. These clips can be arranged into scenes which can then be triggered as a unit. For instance a drum, bass and guitar track might comprise a single scene. When moving on to the next scene, which may feature a synth bassline, the artist will trigger the scene, activating the clips for that scene.

Arrangement View offers a horizontal music production timeline of Clips that is more similar to a traditional software sequencer interface. The Arrangement View is used for recording tracks from the session view and further manipulating their arrangement and effects. It is also used for manual MIDI sequencing.

===Instruments ===
Live Intro includes four instruments (Impulse, Simpler, Instrument Rack, and Drum Rack). Live Standard additionally includes External Instrument, with users having the option to purchase additional instruments. By contrast, Live Suite includes all available instruments.

* Analog - simulates an analog synthesizer.
* Bass - a monophonic virtual analog bass synthesizer.
* Collision - a mallet percussion physical modelling synthesizer.
* Drift - a subtractive synthesizer enabled with MIDI Polyphonic Expression functionality.
* Drum Rack - a sampler for drums. MIDI notes trigger individual &quot;Simplers&quot; so rather than triggering one sample at multiple pitches, individual samples are triggered at predefined pitches, as is suitable for MIDI drum programming. As is usual with Ableton almost anything can be drag dropped to or from the drum racks; for example, one can drop an audio clip or any MIDI device onto a drum rack note.
* Drum Synths - 8 devices for creating drum and percussion sounds via synthesis.
* Electric - an electric piano instrument.
* Granulator III - a granular synthesizer
* Impulse - a traditional drum triggering instrument which allows the user to define a kit of up to eight drum sounds, each based on a single sample. There are a number of effects available such as basic equalization, attack, decay, pitch shift, etc. Once the kit is defined, rhythms and beats are created through Live&#x27;s MIDI sequencer.
* Instrument Rack - allows the user to combine multiple instruments and effects into a single device, allowing for split and layered sounds with customized macro controls.
* Meld - A synthesizer with two macro oscillators, meaning the user can choose between multiple different synthesis modes.
* Operator - an FM synthesizer.
* Poli - a virtual analog synthesizer that combines subtractive and FM synthesis 
* Sampler - an enhanced sampler.

* Simpler - a basic sampling instrument. It functions using a single audio sample, applying simple effects, and envelopes, finally applying pitch transformations in the form of Granular synthesis. In this case, incoming MIDI does not trigger drums as it does in &quot;Impulse&quot;, but selects the final pitch of the sample, with C3 playing the sample at its original pitch.
* Tension - a string physical modelling synthesizer.
* Wavetable - a wavetable synthesizer featuring two oscillators and re-mappable modulation sources.

Ableton also offers a selection of Add-on Sample Packs with which a user can expand the sound libraries for their instruments. These include:
* Session Drums - a collection of sampled drum kits.
* Latin Percussion - a collection of sampled latin percussion hits and loops.
* Essential Instruments Collection - a large collection of acoustic and electric instrument samples.
* Orchestral Instrument Collection - a collection of four different orchestral libraries, which can be purchased individually or as a bundle: Orchestral Strings, Orchestral Brass, Orchestral Woodwinds and Orchestral Percussion. The Orchestral Instrument Collection is included upon purchase of Live Suite but must be downloaded separately.

===Dedicated hardware instruments===
Akai Professional makes the APC40 mk II, a MIDI controller designed to work solely with Live and closely maps the layout of Live&#x27;s Session View onto a physical control surface. A smaller version, the APC20, was released in 2010. Novation offers the Launchpad, a pad device that has been designed for use with Live.

Ableton has also released their own MIDI controller, the Push, which is the first pad-based controller that embraces scales and melody. In November 2015, Ableton released an updated MIDI controller, the Push 2, along with Live 9.5. Push 2 features a new color display, improved buttons and pads, and a lighter frame. In May 2023, Ableton released the Push 3 as Controller and as Standalone-Version.

===Effects===
Most of Live&#x27;s effects are already common effects in the digital signal processing world which have been adapted to fit Live&#x27;s interface. They are tailored to suit Live&#x27;s target audience – electronic musicians and DJs - but may also be used for other recording tasks such as processing a guitar rig. The effects featured in Live are grouped into two categories - MIDI effects and audio effects.

Live is also able to host VST plugins and, on the macOS version, Audio Unit plug-ins as well as Max for Live devices since Live 9.

===Working with audio clips===
 In addition to the instruments mentioned above, Live can work with samples. Live attempts to do beat analysis of the samples to find their meter, number of bars and the number of beats per minute. This makes it possible for Live to shift these samples to fit into loops that are tied into the piece&#x27;s global tempo.

Additionally, Live&#x27;s Time Warp feature can be used to either correct or adjust beat positions in the sample. By setting warp markers to a specific point in the sample, arbitrary points in the sample can be pegged to positions in the measure. For instance a drum beat that fell 250 ms after the midpoint in measure may be adjusted so that it will be played back precisely at the midpoint.

Live also supports Audio To MIDI, which converts audio samples into a sequence of MIDI notes using three different conversion methods including conversion to Melody, Harmony, or Rhythm. Once finished, Live will create a new MIDI track containing the fresh MIDI notes along with an instrument to play back the notes. Audio to midi conversion is not always 100% accurate and may require the artist or producer to manually adjust some notes.

===Envelopes===
Almost all of the parameters in Live can be automated by envelopes which may be drawn either on clips, in which case they will be used in every performance of that clip, or on the entire arrangement. The most obvious examples are volume and track panning, but envelopes are also used in Live to control parameters of audio devices such as the root note of a resonator or a filter&#x27;s cutoff frequency. Clip envelopes may also be mapped to MIDI controls, which can also control parameters in real-time using sliders, faders and such. Using the global transport record function will also record changes made to these parameters, creating an envelope for them.

===User interface===
Much of Live&#x27;s interface comes from being designed for use in live performance, as well as for production. There are few pop up messages or dialogs. Portions of the interface are hidden and shown based on arrows which may be clicked to show or hide a certain segment (e.g. to hide the instrument/effect list or to show or hide the help box).

Live now supports latency compensation for plug-in and mixer automation.

<text>WCOL-FM (92.3 MHz) – branded 92.3 WCOL – is a commercial country music radio station licensed to Columbus, Ohio, serving the Columbus metro area. Owned by iHeartMedia, the WCOL-FM studios are located in Downtown Columbus, while its transmitter resides northwest of downtown on the WBNS-TV tower. In addition to a standard analog transmission, WCOL-FM broadcasts over one HD Radio channel, and streams online via iHeartRadio.

==History==

WCOL-FM first came on the air in 1948. In the early 1970s, it carried religious programming in the daytime and rock music in the evening.

1970 through 1978, WCOL-FM was known as &quot;Stereo Rock 92&quot; and offered programming as an eclectic album-oriented rock (AOR) station, and was moderately popular. 
The on-air mix included Jazz, soul, country and spoken word recordings and focused on local and regionally recorded music. The programming had the support of management but even after dropping the religious programming and going 24 hour AOR, it was difficult for the station&#x27;s sales staff to understand, and thus to monetize. 
Where the station had modest financial success, the cultural impact has been proven over the decades.

And from 1978 and throughout the 1980s, the station used the WXGT call letters and relaunched as &quot;The All New 92X FM, WXGT&quot;. When 92X was launched it went to a Top 40/CHR format. During this period then locally famous Suzy Waud hosted evenings; in the latter part of the mid-to-late 1980s, 92X went into a Rock/40 format.

92X launched the careers of several major market disc jockeys during the 1980s, including the late great Joseph &quot;Smokin&#x27; Joe&quot; Dawson (later at B96 in Chicago), Gary Spears (also later at B96 and then at KIIS-FM in Los Angeles), Baltazar (who went to WQHT a.k.a. Hot 97 in New York after that, and then he went to WJMN, &amp; now he&#x27;s on WBQT both in Boston), and Douglas Ritterling, whose on-air name was Doug Ritter (who later went to KITS a.k.a. Live 105 in San Francisco) and Jonny Zellner who went on to run programming at Sirius XM and later at iHeartMedia formerly known as Clear Channel Communications. WXGT dominated the CHR/AOR a.k.a. the Rock/40 hybrid format in Columbus, Ohio during most of the decade.

On November 5, 1990, WXGT changed to oldies as &quot;Cool 92&quot; under the WCOL-FM call letters. When the country format was ushered in on February 14, 1994, the station stunted over the course of several days by broadcasting a computerized numeric countdown.

The WCOL call sign had also been used on an AM band station, which was the area&#x27;s primary Top 40 station in the 1960s and early 1970s and was branded as &quot;The New WCOL&quot; and &quot;Super &#x27;COL&quot; It briefly returned to its Top 40 roots in the early 1990s simulcasting &quot;Cool 92&quot; and in automated form as &quot;Real Oldies 1230 AM WCOL&quot; from 2003 to 2004. That station is now known as WYTS and is an affiliate of the Fox Sports Radio network.

WCOL-FM is one of two country music outlets in Columbus metro as it faces competition with WCLT-FM for country music listenership in Columbus. However, WCOL-FM is the only country station in Columbus that covers the entire metropolitan area with a full-powered signal.

<text>WCBE (90.5 FM) is a public radio station in Columbus, Ohio that began broadcasting in 1956. The WCBE call sign represents the station&#x27;s licensee, the Columbus Board of Education (Columbus City Schools).

The station was originally housed in the Columbus Normal School building, but moved to the Columbus Public Schools headquarters at 270 E. State Street in downtown Columbus, and then relocated to the historic Fort Hayes educational campus in 1992. The station&#x27;s tower is located on top of LeVeque Tower in downtown Columbus and is simulcast on 13 watt FM translator W292EA at 106.3 MHz in Newark, Ohio.
== Early years ==
The station went on-air in 1956 under the direction of General Manager John Sittig. Initially, the station carried only locally produced education programs designed to connect remote learners to classrooms and only with limited broadcast hours. In 1968, station management was approached by the Good Music Advisory Society to expand broadcast hours, launch classical music programming, and increase station power from 3000 to 10,000 watts. WCBE was the first station in Columbus to affiliate with National Public Radio and began carrying NPR programs with their first broadcast on May 3, 1971, with &quot;All Things Considered&quot;. Of note, Michael Feinstein, archivist and vocal interpreter of the Great American Songbook, interned at WCBE while he was a high school student in Columbus Public Schools in the mid-70s.

== Your True Alternative ==
WOSU-FM broadcast an exclusive classical music service, and in 1990, to avoid duplication in the market, especially on the FM band, WCBE, now led by General Manager and longtime staffer Sharon Miller, switched musical formats to music classified as adult album alternative (AAA or Triple-A), rebranding the station as &quot;Your True Alternative&quot;. Program Directors David Gordon and Norm Beeker managed the on-air programming during this period of unprecedented growth, revamping weekend programming, moving to a 24-hour broadcast with the BBC World Service and launching new local music and news programs. Programming received several awards during this era, including the eclectic music program &quot;Radio Free Columbus&quot;, hosted by Jon Peterson, honored as the 1993 Ohio Educational Broadcasting Program of the Year (OEBie Award), and &quot;Kids Sundae&quot;, a live children&#x27;s variety show co-hosted by Dan Mushalko, recipient of the 1994 OEBie Program of the Year. &quot;Kids Sundae&quot; featured live performances, and had children serve as reporters, producers, and co-hosts, one of whom was WCMH news anchor Kerry Charles.

In addition, &quot;Evening Journal&quot;, a half-hour daily local news broadcast, was honored as the 1992, 1993, and 1994 Best News Program by the Public Radio News Directors (PRNDI). The station also syndicated &quot;Toss the Feathers Christmas&quot;, an annual Celtic music Christmas program, hosted by Doug Dickson, between 1994 and 2004 across the globe through Public Radio International (PRI).

== Financial scandal and aftermath ==
The major public radio programs had also historically been broadcast on the WOSU (820 AM) signal, but a series of changes in 2010 allowed Ohio State University to move the classical broadcast to WOSA (101.1 FM), their AM news service to the WOSU-FM (89.7 FM) signal, and WCVZ (102.5 FM) became the new home for the former CD101 alternative rock station in a financial deal worth $4.8 million. Ohio State would then sell the 820 AM station to St. Gabriel Radio in a $2 million transaction. That station now broadcasts as WVSG.

This competition created financial pressures for WCBE and General Manager Dan Mushalko was let go in 2019 having been convicted of telecommunications fraud for altering invoices to hide station debt from Columbus City Schools leadership. Ohio State University and WOSU hired former Columbus Mayor Michael B. Coleman to negotiate with a private group called WCBE Ohio to take over station operations, but did not negotiate with the district. The district paid off station debt with public funds and elected to retain the license.

In October 2022, acknowledging the financial pressures on the station, General Manager Greg Moebius announced programming changes, including elimination of programs duplicated by WOSU-FM, dropping programs such as &quot;Morning Edition&quot;, &quot;All Things Considered&quot;, &quot;Fresh Air&quot;, and &quot;Marketplace&quot;. The station would instead focus on a near exclusive AAA music format and increasing involvement by Columbus City Schools students, modeling the format on WAPS (FM) in Akron, Ohio.

== Current programs ==

&quot;Global Village&quot;, a daily music program, has been on-air since 1990, with only three hosts in that history, having been started by Bill Munger, hosted for many years by Maxx Faulkner, and now hosted by Maggie Brennan, who began as a college intern at the station. WCBE broadcasts national music programs including &quot;The World Cafe&quot;, &quot;Afropop Worldwide&quot;, and &quot;Echoes&quot; as well as several locally produced specialty music programs. The station carries the BBC World Service overnight and, since 1980, WCBE has carried Ohio news from the Statehouse News Bureau, now led by Bureau Chief and former WCBE News Director Karen Kasler.

With the move to the Fort Hayes studios in 1992, the station began a series of live in-studio concerts, Live from Studio A, and recordings have been featured on promotional tapes and CDs. It&#x27;s Movie Time is a regular feature on WCBE, hosted by John DeSando, and has won awards from the Los Angeles Press Club (2010, best radio feature), the Hermes Award (2010, Gold Award), and the Marcom Awards (2010, Gold Award).

<doc id="745462" wikidata="Q2916801" url="?curid=745462" title="Elisheba">
<text>Elisheva (; ), or alternatively, Elisheba (; ), was the wife of the ancient Israelite prophet Aaron, who was the elder brother of Moses and the first High Priest of Israel, according to Exodus 6:23 in the Hebrew Torah and Christian Old Testament.

== In the Torah and Christian Bible ==
She was said to be a daughter of Amminadab from the Tribe of Judah and a sister of Nahshon, also from the Tribe of Judah. The Hebrew name is composed of two parts: in one interpretation, &quot;Eli&quot; means &quot;my God&quot; and &quot;sheva&quot; means &quot;oath.&quot; The name &quot;Elisheva&quot; can thus be translated as &quot;God is (my) oath.”

Exodus 6:23 in the Torah and Old Testament records that Elisheva and Aaron had four sons: Nadab and Abihu, Eleazar, and Ithamar. In order to be legitimately recognized as hereditary priests (Kohanim; ), Jews are required by &quot;halakha&quot; to be Levites of direct patrilineal descent from Eleazar and Ithamar, the two youngest sons of Aaron and Elisheva.

In the first chapter of the Gospel of Luke in the New Testament, a woman named Elisabet () is said to have been a descendant of Aaron and the wife of Zechariah, who was also a Jewish priest. Elisabet was a relative of Jesus&#x27; mother, Mary, and was the mother of John the Baptist with Zechariah.

== Derivations of the Name ==

=== In English ===
&quot;Elizabeth&quot; is the common English-language variant of &quot;Elisabet&quot;, which is derived from &quot;Elisheva&quot;.

=== In Spanish/Portuguese ===
&quot;Isabel&quot; is the Spanish and Portuguese version of the name &quot;Elisheva&quot; or &quot;Elizabeth&quot; in English.

=== In Italian ===
&quot;Elisabetta&quot; is the Italian version of &quot;Elizabeth,&quot; while &quot;Isabella&quot; is the Italian version of &quot;Elisheva&quot;.

=== In the Muslim world ===
&quot;Alishba&quot; is a modern name that is believed to have been derived from an Arabic-language translation of &quot;Elisheva&quot;. It is prevalent among Muslims in the Indian subcontinent.

<doc id="745466" wikidata="Q2307431" url="?curid=745466" title="Breathe (British band)">
<text>Breathe were an English pop band formed in London in 1984. The band enjoyed chart success in the late 1980s and early 1990s with hit singles &quot;Don&#x27;t Tell Me Lies&quot;, &quot;How Can I Fall?&quot;, and &quot;Say a Prayer&quot;. The group&#x27;s biggest hit was &quot;Hands to Heaven&quot;, which reached #2 in the United States in August 1988. 

== Early years ==
The members of Breathe were childhood friends who attended Yateley School, a comprehensive in north-east Hampshire. During 1982 they formed a five-piece jazz-infused outfit called Catch 22, performing covers and the occasional original song. The lineup consisted of David Glasper (vocals), Marcus Lillington (guitar &amp; keyboards), Phill Harrison (bass), Michael Delahunty (bass guitar), and Ian Spice (drums). In a 1990 interview, Glasper offered the following recollections: I was 17 when the band started, so the other guys were two years younger than myself, 15 ... we had bands that we loved, but it was so far apart in musical tastes... It was just this confusion of different styles. Marcus and Phill were into things like Led Zep and Floyd, that area. I was into things like the Eagles, Little Feat, some soul stuff. Spike was probably into heavier, sort of rock music. So we had all these different kind of styles, which at first was just like a terrible mixture... So we played around our local area quite a lot and that helped kind of formulate or create some kind of style. 

After Phill Harrison left Catch 22 to join the Fire Brigade, the band became known as Breathe.

==Career==
=== 1984–89 ===
In 1984, Breathe began working on some demos. These songs were introduced to personnel from Virgin Records, which led to a recording contract in 1985 with its subsidiary Siren Records.

By May 1985, Breathe was in the studio, and in January 1986, the band released the single &quot;Don&#x27;t Tell Me Lies&quot; in the United Kingdom. The song was a modest success, reaching #77 on the UK Singles Chart. Their second single, &quot;In All Honesty&quot;, was released in Britain in May 1986, but failed to chart.

It was a common industry practice to break a new artist with an up-tempo number, so in May 1987, an abbreviated mix of &quot;Jonah&quot; was chosen instead of &quot;Hands to Heaven&quot; as Breathe&#x27;s third UK single. Los Angeles-based label A&amp;M Records released the album &quot;All That Jazz&quot; in the United States on 24 August 1987, issuing &quot;Jonah&quot; as Breathe&#x27;s first stateside single. &quot;Jonah&quot; did not chart in either the United States or the United Kingdom.

At the end of August 1987, Siren Records released the single &quot;All That Jazz&quot; in Britain as a prelude to the full-length same-titled album, originally scheduled for an October UK release. Although this title track did not chart, the album would soon go on to score the group two of the band&#x27;s best-known hits, &quot;Hands to Heaven&quot; and &quot;How Can I Fall?&quot;. 

In September 1987, Breathe embarked on their first live national tour, The Big Blow Tour. Between 9 and 28 September, the band played 17 dates.

Faced with four unsuccessful singles after &quot;All That Jazz&quot; failed to reach the Top 100 Singles chart, Siren released &quot;Hands To Heaven&quot; in October 1987, while A&amp;M Records issued &quot;Hands To Heaven&quot; in January 1988 as Breathe&#x27;s second American single. Siren Records released a remix of &quot;Any Trick&quot; in March 1988. 

In America, &quot;Hands To Heaven&quot; debuted on the Billboard Adult Contemporary chart on 20 February 1988. With repeated rotation of the music video on VH1, &quot;Hands To Heaven&quot; crept onto the Billboard Hot 100 at #90 on 16 April and drifted about the lower regions of the chart for the following two months until it finally broke into the Top 40 in June. The single reached #2 in the US in 1988 and #4 on the UK Singles Chart.

In mid-1988, the group experienced managerial and personnel problems that led to the departures of manager Karl Adams and, more significantly, bass player Michael Delahunty. David Glasper stated that Delahunty had been fired, and that the decision &quot;had been made on purely musical terms.&quot;

As the band&#x27;s next single in the United States, A&amp;M chose &quot;How Can I Fall?&quot;. This song cracked the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot Adult Contemporary chart on 3 September and reached the Hot 100 one week later. In Britain, with the success of &quot;Hands to Heaven&quot;, Siren Records decided to revamp the album &quot;All That Jazz&quot;, which had not yet charted. A new cover was commissioned to reflect the changed band lineup, with the track listing altered by the addition of a remix of &quot;Don&#x27;t Tell Me Lies&quot;.

In the United Kingdom, Breathe toured between 14 and 27 September 1988 as the opening act for Belinda Carlisle during her Good Heavens Tour. 

&quot;All That Jazz&quot; was re-released in the UK on 26 September 1988, and debuted on the British album chart the week of 8 October 1988. That same month, Breathe performed at the Ku Club on the Mediterranean island of Ibiza as part of the Ibiza &#x27;88 music festival. Also in October, the remixed &quot;Jonah&quot; was released as Breathe&#x27;s seventh single in the UK, and found minor chart success with a peak of #60.

By September 1988, Breathe had also began to work on their second album titled &quot;Peace of Mind&quot;. 

In the United States, &quot;How Can I Fall?&quot; continued to climb the charts, hitting #1 on the Adult Contemporary chart for two weeks in November and peaking at #3 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100.

When Billboard&#x27;s Top 100 Singles of 1988 were calculated, &quot;Hands To Heaven&quot; came in at #9, while &quot;How Can I Fall?&quot; was ranked #27 the following year.

On 3 January 1989, A&amp;M issued a remixed version of &quot;Don&#x27;t Tell Me Lies&quot; as a single. When the single reached #10 on 18 March, Breathe became the first group in A&amp;M&#x27;s 27-year history to achieve three Top 10 singles from its debut album. The song also reached #5 on the adult contemporary chart. In the United Kingdom, Siren issued the remix of &quot;Don&#x27;t Tell Me Lies&quot; in early March. Neither of the successful US follow-ups translated to the British charts; &quot;How Can I Fall?&quot; peaked at #48, and &quot;Don&#x27;t Tell Me Lies&quot; at #45.

In April 1989, A&amp;M released &quot;All This I Should Have Known&quot; in the US as the final single from &quot;All That Jazz&quot;. While it made a respectable #34 placing on the Adult Contemporary chart, it missed the Hot 100.

In May 1989, Billboard Magazine named David Glasper (number 12) and Marcus Lillington (number 13) in its top 20 pop songwriters for 1988. Later in the year, they were honoured at the ASCAP annual pop awards, held in London on 27 September, for &quot;Hands To Heaven&quot; and &quot;How Can I Fall?&quot;

=== 1990-92 ===
David Glasper and Marcus Lillington continued to pen songs for the band&#x27;s second album &quot;Peace of Mind&quot; and by December 1989 Breathe was back in the studio with producer Bob Sargeant. This album also saw Glasper collaborate with prolific songwriter Francis &quot;Eg&quot; White on four tracks.

In 1990, David Glasper and Marcus Lillington were again honoured amongst songwriters whose songs had achieved the greatest airplay in the US during the previous year. At the ASCAP Pop awards, held on 26 September 1990, they were recognised for the success of &quot;How Can I Fall?&quot; and &quot;Don&#x27;t Tell Me Lies&quot;. 

&quot;Peace of Mind&quot; was released on 20 August 1990 in the UK, Europe and internationally, and issued in the United States on 4 September 1990.

Three commercial singles were released from &quot;Peace of Mind&quot; - the first being &quot;Say a Prayer&quot;, issued by A&amp;M in the United States during August 1990. The song reached #21 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 chart, and peaked at #3 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Adult Contemporary chart. In the United Kingdom, &quot;Say a Prayer&quot; was released by Siren in October 1990 as the second single from the album (after &quot;Say Hello&quot;) where it peaked at #93 in the Top 100.

&quot;Say Hello&quot; was issued on 3 September 1990 as a single in the UK and Europe only, achieving a modest top placing of #88 on the UK singles chart on 15 September.

&quot;Does She Love That Man?&quot; became the third, and final single lifted from &quot;Peace of Mind&quot;. Released in November 1990, it failed to enter the UK singles chart. In the United States, the single was issued with the artist billed as &quot;Breathe featuring David Glasper&quot;. It peaked at #34 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart in mid-January 1991 and #17 on the Adult Contemporary chart.

While a fourth commercial single did not eventuate from &quot;Peace of Mind&quot; or from Breathe, A&amp;M Records did issue &quot;Without Your Love&quot; to radio in the U.S. as a promotional single in early 1991. With this release, the artist was again billed as ‘Breathe featuring David Glasper’.

By 1992 Breathe had disbanded, allegedly due to their frustration with the lack of promotional support they were receiving from A&amp;M, which had been acquired by PolyGram (now Universal Music Group) in 1989. 

In a 2012 interview, Marcus Lillington stated that the band &quot;kind of fell apart as a band during the making of &quot;Peace of Mind&quot;. We just weren&#x27;t into promoting it in the same way as &quot;All That Jazz&quot;. ... I also don&#x27;t think the songs were quite up to the standard of the first album&quot;.

== Management ==
At the start of its recording career, Breathe was represented by Karl Adams of Spearhead Management, but after frustrations concerning the band&#x27;s direction, Breathe and Adams parted ways in early 1988. (Adams appeared in the credits for the original issue of the album A&quot;ll That Jazz&quot;, but not the 1988 re-release). David Glasper later stated, during promotion of &quot;Hands To Heaven&quot;, that &quot;What hurt the group was management&#x27;s emphasis on a major selling point for most bands – appearance. We were four young guys. It doesn&#x27;t take much business acumen to see we could have appealed to teen-age girls... Our first manager used to scream at us about image&quot;.

Following the departure of Karl Adams, Breathe employed the services of Paul King&#x27;s Outlaw Management.

Paul King

Paul King began his music career promoting live shows at Brunel University in 1970 whilst studying Nuclear Chemistry. Brunel became a major venue on the touring circuit with concerts by Elton John, Genesis, Humble Pie, The Kinks, The Sex Pistols and others.

Attempts by King to resurrect his pop career, promoting the likes of Morrissey, ended in liquidation, with Morrissey Tours left £33,000 out of pocket. King was also involved in fashion retailing and a telecoms firm, Marlin Telecom, which was wound up by Customs &amp; Excise in October 2000.

Paul King died in October 2015 following a battle with cancer. He was 63.

<doc id="745476" wikidata="Q159443" url="?curid=745476" title="Eleazar">
<text>Eleazar (; ) or Elazar was a priest in the Hebrew Bible, the second High Priest, succeeding his father Aaron after he died. He was a nephew of Moses.

==Biblical narrative==
Eleazar played a number of roles during the course of the Exodus, from creating the plating for the altar from the firepans of Korah&#x27;s assembly, to performing the ritual of the red heifer. After the death of his older brothers Nadab and Abihu, he and his younger brother Ithamar were appointed to the charge of the sanctuary. His wife, a daughter of Putiel, bore him Phinehas, who would eventually succeed him as High Priest.

Leviticus 10:16–18 records an incident when Moses was angry with Eleazar and Ithamar, for failing to eat a sin offering inside the Tabernacle in accordance with the regulations set out in the preceding chapters of Leviticus regarding the entitlement of the priests to a share of the offerings they made on behalf of the Israelite people.

As the Israelites moved through the wilderness during the Exodus journey, Eleazar was responsible for carrying the oil for the lampstand, the sweet incense, the daily grain offering and the anointing oil, and also for oversight of the carriage of the Ark of the Covenant, table for showbread, altar and other tabernacle fittings which were transported by the Kohathite section of the Levite tribe. Following the rebellion against Moses&#x27; leadership recorded in Numbers 16, Eleazar was charged with taking the rebels&#x27; bronze censers and hammering them into a covering for the altar, to act as a reminder of the failed rebellion and the restriction of the priesthood to the Aaronid dynasty.

On Mount Hor he was clothed with the sacred vestments, which Moses took from his father Aaron and put upon him as successor to his father in the high priest&#x27;s office, before Aaron&#x27;s death. Eleazar held the office of high priest for more than twenty years. He took part with Moses in numbering the people, and assisted at the inauguration of Joshua.

He assisted in the distribution of the land after the conquest. When he died, he &quot;was buried at Gibeah, which had been allotted to his son Phinehas in the hill country of Ephraim&quot;. The &quot;Hill of Phinehas&quot; related in the Bible is associated with the location of the village of Awarta in the Samarian section of the current day West Bank.

The high-priesthood remained in the family of Eleazar until the time of Eli, into whose family it passed. Eli was a descendant of Ithamar, Eleazar&#x27;s brother. The high priesthood was restored to the family of Eleazar in the person of Zadok after Abiathar was cast out by Solomon.

According to Jewish oral tradition, Eleazar was buried in Awarta.

==Commemorations==
Eleazar is commemorated as a saint in the Eastern Orthodox Church and Roman Catholic Church on September 2, and as one of the Holy Forefathers in the Calendar of Saints of the Armenian Apostolic Church on July 30.

==Other biblical figures named Eleazar==
Five other men named Eleazar are briefly mentioned in the Hebrew Bible:

* Eleazar, son of Abinadab, who was entrusted as a keeper of the Ark of the Covenant
* Eleazar (son of Dodai), one of King David&#x27;s warriors
* Eleazar, son of Pinhas, one of those in charge of the sacred vessels brought back to Jerusalem after the Babylonian Exile.
* Eleazar, called Avaran who slays a battle elephant in I Maccabees.
* Eleazar, the Hebrew scribe whose martyrdom under Antiochus IV Epiphanes was recounted in II Maccabees.

In the Gospel of Matthew, another Eleazar, the son of Eliud, is listed in the genealogy of Jesus as the great-grandfather of Joseph, husband of Mary.

<text>WTVN (610 AM) – branded as &quot;News Radio 610 WTVN&quot; – is a commercial news/talk radio station licensed to Columbus, Ohio. Owned by iHeartMedia, the station serves the Columbus metro area. The WTVN studios area located in the McKinley Avenue Corridor northwest of Downtown Columbus, and its transmitter site is near Obetz. In addition to a standard analog transmission, the station simulcasts over the HD digital subchannel of co-owned 93.3 WODC, and streams online via iHeartRadio. WTVN began broadcasting in HD Radio in June 2005, but the in-band on-channel subcarrier was discontinued by 2015.

With 5,000 watts of power, during the day the station can be heard as far away as Indianapolis, Fort Wayne, Detroit, and Cleveland. At night, a directional antenna protects stations operating on the same frequency, including KCSP in Kansas City, WTEL in Philadelphia, and WIOD in Miami. The nighttime signal is primarily radiated northward over central Columbus, and outlying suburbs in the direction of the nulls experience a degraded signal.

== Programming ==
WTVN&#x27;s programming is largely made up of co-owned Premiere Networks&#x27; nationally syndicated talk shows, including &quot;The Clay Travis and Buck Sexton Show&quot;, &quot;The Glenn Beck Program&quot; and &quot;Coast to Coast AM with George Noory&quot; live and &quot;The Sean Hannity Show&quot; on tape delay. WTVN has three local weekday talk hosts: Mike Elliott is heard in morning drive time, Mark Blazor hosts afternoons from 3-6pm and Chuck Douglas is in at 6:00pm as host of &quot;The Power Hour&quot;. . At night, WTVN also carries &quot;The Mark Levin Show&quot; from Westwood One.

Weekends feature shows on money, health, real estate, guns, home repair, cars and the law. Weekend syndicated programs include &quot;In the Garden with Ron Wilson&quot;, &quot;This Morning, America&#x27;s First News with Gordon Deal&quot; and &quot;Sunday Night with Bill Cunningham&quot;. World and national news is supplied by ABC News Radio.

==History==

Effective December 1, 1921, the Department of Commerce, which regulated radio at this time, adopted regulations setting aside two wavelengths for use by broadcasting stations: 360 meters (833 kHz) for &quot;entertainment&quot; programs, and 485 meters (619 kHz) for &quot;market and weather&quot; reports. WTVN&#x27;s first license, as WBAV, was issued on April 29, 1922, to the Erner &amp; Hopkins Company at 146 North Third Street in Columbus, for operation on 360 meters. The WBAV call letters were randomly assigned from an alphabetical roster of available call signs.

The station made its formal debut on the evening of May 8, 1922, which the &quot;Columbus Dispatch&quot; heralded as &quot;a success from every standpoint&quot;. A few months after receiving its initial license, WBAV was authorized to also broadcast on the 485 meter &quot;market and weather&quot; wavelength. In September 1922 the Department of Commerce set aside a second entertainment wavelength, 400 meters (750 kHz) for &quot;Class B&quot; stations that had quality equipment and programming. In May 1923 additional &quot;Class B&quot; frequencies were made available. One of the Ohio allocations was 770 kHz, and WBAV was assigned to this frequency on a time-sharing basis with WJAX in Cleveland. In mid-1924 WBAV was reassigned to 710 kHz, now sharing time with WLW in Cincinnati, which was changed in early 1925 to 1020 kHz, with a new timeshare partner of WEAO in Columbus.

In early November 1925, the American Insurance Union took over the station, changing the call letters to WAIU. WAIU was a charter member of the CBS Radio Network, being one of the 16 stations that aired the first CBS network program on September 18, 1927.

On June 15, 1927, the newly formed Federal Radio Commission (FRC) reassigned WAIU to 1060 kHz, still sharing time with WEAO. On November 11, 1928, the FRC made a major nationwide reallocation, implementing standards contained in its General Order 40. With these reassignments, most former &quot;Class B&quot; stations were granted a primary status on what were known as &quot;clear channel&quot; frequencies. However, WAIU was reduced to a secondary station on the clear channel frequency of 640 kHz. Also, now a &quot;limited time&quot; station, it had unrestricted daytime operating hours, but its evening hours were limited to operation only until sunset in Los Angeles, California, which was the location of the frequency&#x27;s primary station, KFI.

On July 1, 1936, WAIU&#x27;s call sign was changed to WHKC, to go with that of then commonly owned WHK in Cleveland.

===1945 move from 640 to 610 kHz===

In August 1941 the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) adopted a &quot;duopoly&quot; rule, which restricted licensees from operating more than one radio station in a city. At this time, in addition to owning WHKC in Columbus, United Broadcasting owned two stations in Cleveland: WHK and WCLE. As part of a successful plan to avoid having to give up one of its Cleveland stations, United arranged for a frequency swap between WCLE, then on 610 kHz, and WHKC on 640 kHz.

In order to conform to the duopoly restrictions, WCLE was moved from Cleveland to Akron. In conjunction with this transfer WCLE, which had been operating as a daytime-only station on 610 kHz, shifted to 640 kHz. This in turn made it possible for WHKC to move from 640 to 610 kHz. WHKC installed a directional antenna near Columbus, which allowed it to expand to full-time operation with 1,000 watts, starting in February 1945. In 1949 WHKC&#x27;s power was increased to 5,000 watts day and night.

The station became WTVN on July 23, 1954, when it was acquired by Radio Cincinnati Inc., which later become Taft Broadcasting. The sale to the Taft family made 610 AM a sister station to WTVN-TV (channel 6); in 1960 Taft launched an FM station in Columbus, WTVN-FM (96.3, now WLVQ). In 1987 Taft was reorganized as Great American Broadcasting after financier Carl Lindner, Jr. succeeded in a hostile takeover of the company. Great American retained WTVN and WLVQ but not WTVN-TV (now WSYX), which was sold to former Taft shareholder Robert Bass and his new company, Anchor Media. Great American Broadcasting was renamed Citicasters in 1993. Jacor Communications purchased Citicasters in 1996. WLVQ was split from WTVN when the FM station was acquired by CBS Radio in 1998, and a year later Jacor was absorbed into Clear Channel Communications.

At one time, when WTVN still aired music programming, the station broadcast using C-QUAM AM Stereo. The stereo equipment was installed in 1988 but it was not until 1992 that the station operated in full stereo. Analog stereo transmissions ended several years later, though the internet feed remains stereophonic. WTVN also broadcast using iBiquity&#x27;s HD Radio format in the late 2000s, though it was difficult to maintain a lock on the carrier and digital transmissions have since ceased.

An attempt was made to improve WTVN&#x27;s coverage, by installing a new antenna array and increasing power to 50,000 watts. However, zoning problems at the antenna site could not be resolved. WTVN tried to claim the right to build new towers as a &quot;public utility&quot;, but lost in court on May 12, 2002.

In 2006 the station replaced Pat Pagano and the meteorologists at Metro Weather Service with weather talent from WBNS-TV (channel 10), which was itself replaced by weather services from WSYX television., Metro Weather, based out of Valley Stream, New York, provided weather reports 24 hours, including Pagano during Bob Conners&#x27; morning show.

Afternoon drive was hosted by John Corby until his death on January 20, 2018.

==AIU Building==
American Insurance Union owned the AIU Building (now the LeVeque Tower) in Columbus, which at the time was the tallest building in the city. Various radio facilities were located at the top of the skyscraper, including the transmitting antennae for WLWC (channel 4, now WCMH-TV) and WTVN-TV (channel 6, now WSYX). American Insurance Union later became part of Nationwide Insurance, owner of Nationwide Communications - former parent company of WNCI, which is a current sister station to WTVN.

<doc id="745491" wikidata="Q2887490" url="?curid=745491" title="Los Angeles Basin">
<text>The Los Angeles Basin is a sedimentary basin located in Southern California, in a region known as the Peninsular Ranges. The basin is also connected to an group of east–west trending chains of mountains collectively known as the Transverse Ranges. The present basin is a coastal lowland area, whose floor is marked by elongate low ridges and groups of hills that is located on the edge of the Pacific plate. The Los Angeles Basin, along with the Santa Barbara Channel, the Ventura Basin, the San Fernando Valley, and the San Gabriel Basin, lies within the greater Southern California region. The majority of the jurisdictional land area of the city of Los Angeles physically lies within this basin.

On the north, northeast, and east, the lowland basin is bound by the Santa Monica Mountains and Puente, Elysian, and Repetto hills. To the southeast, the basin is bordered by the Santa Ana Mountains and the San Joaquin Hills. The western boundary of the basin is marked by the Continental Borderland and is part of the onshore portion. The California borderland is characterized by northwest trending offshore ridges and basins. The Los Angeles Basin is notable for its great structural relief and complexity in relation to its geologic youth and small size for its prolific oil production. Yerkes et al. identify five major stages of the basin&#x27;s evolution, which began in the Upper Cretaceous and ended in the Pleistocene. This basin can be classified as an irregular pull-apart basin accompanied by rotational tectonics during the post-early Miocene.

==Formation==

Before the formation of the basin, the area that encompasses the Los Angeles basin began above ground. A rapid transgression and regression of the shoreline moved the area to a shallow marine environment. Tectonic instability coupled with volcanic activity in rapidly subsiding areas during the Middle Miocene set the stage for the modern basin. The basin formed in a submarine environment and was later brought back above sea level when the rate of subsidence slowed. There is much discussion in the literature about the geologic time boundaries when each basin forming event took place. While exact ages may not be clear, Yerkes et al. (1965) provided a general timeline to categorize the sequence of depositional events in the LA Basin&#x27;s evolution and they are as follows:

===Phase 1: Pre-extension===
During pre-Turonian, metamorphosed sedimentary and volcanic rocks are present that serve as the two major basement rock units for the LA Basin. Large-scale movement along the Newport–Inglewood zone juxtaposed the two bedrock units along the east and west margins. During this phase, the basin was above sea level.

===Phase 2: Pre-basin phase of deposition===
The hallmarks of this phase were successive shoreline transgression and regression cycles. Deposition of older marine and non-marine sediments began to fill the basin. Towards the end of this phase, the shoreline began to retreat and deposition continued.

===Phase 3: Basin inception===
After the deposition of the pre-Turonian units, there was a large emergence and erosion that can be observed as a major unconformity at the base of the middle Miocene units. Emergence did not occur at the same rate or in all sections of the basin. During this time, the basin was covered by a marine embayment. Rivers sourced in the highlands brought large amounts of detritus to the northeastern edge of the basin. During this period, the Topanga formation was also being deposited.

===Phase 4: Principal phase of subsidence and deposition===
The present form and structural relief of the basin was largely established during this phase of accelerated subsidence and deposition which occurred during the late Miocene and continued through the early Pleistocene. Clastic sedimentary rocks from the highland areas (to the north and east) moved down the submarine slopes and infilled the basin floor. Subsidence and sedimentation most likely began in the southern portion basin. Subsidence and Deposition occurred simultaneously, without interruption, until the late Pliocene. Until the rate of deposition gradually overtook the rate of subsidence, and the sea level began to fall. Towards the end of this phase, the margins of the basin began to rise above sea level. During the early Pleistocene, deposition began to outpace subsidence in the depressed parts of the basin and the shoreline began to move southward. This phase also had movement along the Newport–Inglewood fault zone that resulted in the initiation of the modern basin. This movement caused the southwestern block to be uplifted relative to the central basin block.

===Phase 5: Basin disruption===
The central part of the basin continued to experience sediment deposition through the Pleistocene from flooding and erosional debris from the surrounding mountains and Puente Hills. This infill was responsible for the final retreat of the shoreline from the basin. Deposition in the Holocene is characterized by non marine gravel, sand and silt. This phase also includes the late-stage compressional deformation responsible for the formation of the hydrocarbon traps.

==Geology==
===Blocks===
Four major faults are present in the region and divide the basin in the central, northwest, southwest, and northeast structural blocks. These blocks not only denote their geographic location, but they indicate the strata present and major structural features. The southwestern block was uplifted prior to the middle Miocene and is composed mostly of marine strata and contains two major anticlines. This block also contains the steeply-dipping Palos Verdes Hills fault zone. The middle Miocene volcanics can be seen locally within the southwest block. The northwestern block consists of clastic marine sediments of Late Cretaceous to Pleistocene age. Middle Miocene volcanics are also present. This block has a broad anticline that is truncated by the Santa Monica fault zone. The central block contains both marine and non-marine clastic rock units interbedded with volcanic rocks that are late Cretaceous to Pliocene in age. Pliocene and Quaternary strata are most visible within the central block. Structurally, there is a synclinal trough. The northeastern block contains fine to coarse grained clastic marine rocks of Cenozoic age. Locally, middle Miocene volcanics can be seen as well as Eocene to Miocene aged non-marine sedimentary rocks. There is also an anticline in the northeastern block.

===Stratigraphy===

Homogeneous evolution of this basin did not occur due to dynamic tectonic activity. Despite the active setting, there are over 9,100 m of strata within the basin. The dynamic setting was also responsible for the heterogeneous deposition of each formation. It is common for rock units of the same depositional event to have different names in different locations within the basin. This may be a result of large variation in clast size as with the upper Pliocene Pico Formation in the northwestern part of the basin and the Upper Fernando Formation in the southwest part of the basin. 
The Los Angeles Basin contains what is known as the &quot;Great Unconformity&quot; which has been interpreted as a large-scale erosional event in the basement rock unit. This unconformity is used to correlate strata throughout the basin. The record of the Cenozoic activity begins above this unconformity. The stratigraphic record for this basin indicates that it began as a non-marine environment and then transgressed to a deep ocean system. The oldest basement units of this basin are of both sedimentary and igneous origin. The sedimentary unit was metamorphosed as a result of slippage of the Newport–Inglewood fault and is known as the Catalina Schist. The Catalina Schist can be found on the southwestern edge of the basin and is predominantly a chlorite-quartz schist. Closer to the Newport–Inglewood fault zone, garnet-bearing schists and metagabbros occur. The Santa Monica Slate can be observed in the northwestern block of the basin. The eastern complex is characterized by Santiago Peak Volcanics. This rock unit contains andesitic breccias, flow, agglomerates and tuffs.

The Sespe Formation is the first to appear above the great unconformity and is marked by interbedded mudstones, sandstones and pebbly sandstones. This bed sequence indicates an alluvial fan, meandering stream or braided stream origin. Upward from the Sespe Formation toward the Vaqueros, the grains become finer and the beds become thinner; indicating a transition to a shallow marine environment. The Vaqueros Formation is marked by two sandstone, siltstone and shale units. There are also characteristic mollusk fossils that indicate the area was dominately shallow marine.

The Topanga Group is the next major formation in the stratigraphic sequence and infills the topography on older rocks. It is a mixed sedimentary and volcanic unit whose base is an erosional unconformity.&lt;ref name=&quot;A/T Volcanics&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The unit consists of 3 parts: First is a basal marine conglomeratic sandstone, followed by a dominantly basaltic middle layer of multiple submarine lava flows and tuffs. The youngest part of this unit is a sedimentary breccia, conglomerate, sandstone, and a siltstone. The earliest deposits of the Topanga Group appear to reflect the continuation of a shift in shoreline that can be seen in both the Sespe and Vaqueros formations. Eruptions from one or more of volcanic centers locally and temporarily interrupted sedimentation.

The Puente Formation is a deep-marine formation that is characterized by pro-delta sediments and an overlapping fan system. This unit lies above the Topanga Group giving it a Late Miocene depositional age and is divided into four members. The La Vida Member is a micaceous, platy siltstone with subordinate amounts of thin-bedded feldspathic sandstone. The next member is the Soquel, which is a thick bedded to massive micaceous sandstone. Locally abundant siltstone, conglomerate, and intraformational breccia can also be seen in this member. Above the Soquel lies the Yorba Member. This member is a sandy siltstone that is interbedded with a fine-grained sandstone. The Sycamore Canyon Member contains lenses of conglomerate, conglomeratic sandstone, and sandstone. Sandy siltstone and fine-grained sandstones are interbedded with the aforementioned rock types.

The Monterey Formation is characterized by abnormally high silica content compared to most clastic rocks. There are also silica-cemented rocks known as porcelanite and porcelanite shale. While this formation has distinguishable beds, there are many shale, sandstone, and mudstone beds that have normal amounts of silica. This sequence of this formation indicates an off-shore marine environment.

The Fernando Formation is split into two sub-facies known as the Pico and Repetto Members. These members represent a distinct change in the depositional environment and are of Pleistocene age. The Repetto is the older of the two members and is composed of interbedded fine to coarse grained siltstone, mudstone, and sandstone. The Pico Member is mostly made of massive siltstones and sandstones interbedded with minor silty-sandstones. Holocene alluvium and Quaternary sediments is a largely unconsolidated unit and is composed mostly of gravel and floodplain sediments. The sediments that mark the top of the basin can be found in modern streams/rivers and at the base of the foothills.

===Tectonic setting===
The history of this basin begins with the subduction of Pacific plate underneath the North American plate in the beginning of the Mesozoic. During this subduction event, two smaller plates, the Monterey and Juan de Fuca plates, also began to subduct underneath the North American plate. Around 20Ma, the Monterey plate attached to and followed the motion of the Pacific plate. Later, subduction of the Pacific-Monterey ceased and the plate margin was converted to a transform boundary. The North America/Pacific-Monterey transform boundary began to move north and created crustal extension. This rifting was accompanied with the rotation of the western Transverse Ranges. This rotation is responsible for the placement and northwest–southeast orientation of the LA Basin. Early in the Miocene, before deposition of the Topanga, high heat flow and transtension caused the extension of the basin. As the crust thinned, the basin began to subside from isostatic pressure as a result of large amounts of sediment deposition.

Because the basin lies on the boundary of the Transverse and Peninsular Ranges, this basin experiences both compressional and strike slip tectonics. During the early Pliocene, also identified as the &quot;Basin Disruption&quot; phase, deformation and folding occurred as a result of fault movement and a slight rotation event. While movement along the San Andreas Fault is responsible for the placement of the basin, it is the Whittier and Newport–Inglewood faults that have dictated the seismic behavior within the basin.

==Earthquakes==
The Los Angeles basin is still active tectonically and the region continues to experience earthquakes as a result. Due to the number of faults and fault splays, seismic activity is not concentrated in one particular area. The cities that are overlain by the Newport–Inglewood and Whittier fault zones have a higher probability of experiencing seismic activity. The region experiences earthquakes that are mostly mild (magnitude ≤2.25). However moderate earthquakes (magnitude 4.9 to 6.4) have been reported. Earthquakes of moderate magnitude are very infrequent.

==Features==
===The Newport–Inglewood Fault Zone===
This fault zone is the most notable feature within the basin that is a single strand with local (fault) splays. The fault zone is also marked by low hills, scarps, and ten anticlinal folds in a right-stepping en echelon pattern. It is located in the southwest portion of the basin and is a strike-slip margin. There are several oil fields that run parallel to this fault.

===The Whittier Fault===
This fault lies on the eastern border of the basin and mergers with the Elsinore Fault in the canyon of the Santa Ana River, one of the upper branches of the fault. This fault is a reverse right-oblique fault. It is most known for the Whittier, Brea-Olinda, Sansinena, oil fields. There is an anticline that runs parallel to the Whittier fault that is evidence for compressional deformation during the late Miocene to early Pliocene. Thinning and pinch-out of the Pliocene sandstones are evidence for uplift during this same time period.

===The Anaheim Nose===
The Anaheim nose is a subsurface feature that was discovered by geophysical surveys and exploratory drilling in 1930. It is a mid-Miocene fault block that revealed a northwest trending ridge of Paleocene age rocks. This structural feature is important because it revealed many oil traps and orientation of the beds indicate the age of subsidence in this portion of the basin.

===The Wilmington Anticline===
This particular anticline is the most notable subsurface feature within the basin. Deformation events such as erosion of the uplifted crustal blocks, initiation of various faults, and the development of the submarine channel led to the anticline&#x27;s formation. Fold initiation began in the late-Miocene to early Pliocene period of deformation. There are many other anticlines within the basin and isopach data suggests that the formation of these folds occurred mostly during the Pliocene.

===The La Brea Tar Pits===

The La Brea Tar Pits are pools of stagnant asphaltum that have been found on the basin&#x27;s surface. These &quot;pools&quot; are important because hundreds of thousands of late Pleistocene bones and plants have been found. These pits allowed scientists to better understand the ecosystem at that particular point in the geologic past.

==Petroleum==

Accumulations of oil and gas occur almost wholly within strata of the younger sequence and in areas that are within or adjacent to the coastal belt. The Puente formation has proved to be the most notable reservoir for petroleum in the basin. The primary reason for the high abundance of oil is because the oil sands are well saturated within the basin. The thickness of these oil sands range from hundreds to thousands of feet. Anticlines and faulted anticlines are the structural features that are also responsible for trapping oil.

The first reported oil-producing well was discovered in 1892 on the land that is presently beneath Dodger Stadium. This basin was responsible for half of the states oil production until the (90&#x27;s?). This is remarkable due to the relatively small size and youth of the basin. The basin currently has about 40 active oil fields that collectively have 4,000 operating wells. In 1904, there were over 1,150 wells in the city of Los Angeles alone. Tight spacing and continued pumping of the wells resulted in most of the wells to dry up. Most recent data indicates that 255 million barrels of oil were produced in 2013. This is a large decline from the almost 1 billion barrels per year produced in the late 1970s.

<text>The Kativik Regional Government (, ARK) is the representative regional authority for most of the Nunavik region of Quebec. Nunavik is the northern half of the Nord-du-Québec administrative region and includes all the territory north of the 55th parallel. The administrative capital is Kuujjuaq, on the Koksoak River, about 50 kilometres inland from the southern end of the Ungava Bay.

In accordance with the 1975 James Bay and Northern Quebec Agreement, the KRG was established by the 1978 &quot;Act respecting Northern Villages and the Kativik Regional Government&quot; (Kativik Act).

==Representation==
The Kativik Regional Government includes 14 northern villages, 14 Inuit reserved lands and one Naskapi village municipality. Each Inuit reserved land is near a northern village; the Naskapi village municipality of Kawawachikamach (north of the 55th parallel) is near the Naskapi reserved land that is also called Kawawachikamach, south of the 55th parallel in the Côte-Nord region of Quebec. The Kativik Regional Government covers a territory of about and includes a population of just over 10,000 persons, of which about 90% are Inuit.

The Cree village Whapmagoostui, near the northern village of Kuujjuarapik, on the eastern shore of Hudson Bay, is an enclave in the Nunavik region and its inhabitants do not participate in the Kativik Regional Government. Whapmagoostui (village and reserved lands: ) is part of the Cree Regional Authority and the Grand Council of the Cree (Eeyou Istchee).

The Inuit of Nunavik are also represented by the Makivik Corporation in their relations with the governments of Quebec and Canada on issues specifically pertaining to their indigenous rights (hunting and land use). The Makivik Corporation supports greater autonomy for the Nunavik region and is headquartered in Kuujjuaq.

==Structure==
Each of the 14 municipal councils of the northern villages designates one of its elected members to serve as a regional councillor on the Kativik Regional Government. As such, all these councillors have been elected locally by municipal residents, whether Inuit and non-Inuit. An additional regional councillor is designated as a representative from Kawawachikamach, Quebec.

==Finances==
The Regional Government is financed by the Government of Quebec (50%) and the Government of Canada (25%).

==Services==

The KRG has mandates to provide the following services:
*Airport and marine infrastructure maintenance
*Economic and business development
*Policing, civil security and assistance to victims of crime
*Inuit hunting, fishing and trapping support and wildlife conservation
*Environmental research
*Parks management
*Employment, training and income support
*Childcare services
*Municipal infrastructure development and drinking water monitoring
*Internet access
*Sports and recreation

The police service is provided by the Kativik Regional Police Force, which also has its headquarters in Kuujjuaq.

<doc id="745523" wikidata="Q2282256" url="?curid=745523" title="Irises (painting)">
<text>Irises is an oil painting by Dutch artist Vincent van Gogh. Painted in 1889, the work is a landscape with a cropped composition and is one of several hundred paintings from a series of paintings that van Gogh made at the Saint Paul-de-Mausole asylum in Saint-Rémy-de-Provence, France, in the last year before his death in 1890. It has been in the permanent collection of The Getty in Los Angeles, California since 1990.

The painting depicts vibrantly blooming irises with dynamic brushstrokes. The flowers are a mix of deep blues and violets, contrasting with lush green leaves, red-orange earth, and yellow flowers in the background. Van Gogh&#x27;s characteristic impasto technique adds texture and movement within the painting, creating an energetic and expressive feeling. The overall cropped composition of Irises, includes broad areas of vivid color and monumental rippled irises overflowing the borders of the canvas which helps moves the viewer&#x27;s eye throughout the canvas.

== Background ==

=== Saint-Rémy ===
In May 1889, van Gogh voluntarily entered the Saint-Paul-de-Mausole asylum in nearby Saint-Rémy, where he painted around 150 canvases over the course of the next year. His initial confinement to the hospital grounds is reflected in his imagery, from depictions of its corridors to the irises and lilacs of its walled garden, visible from the window of the spare room allocated as his studio. Vincent was restricted to the premises, where his only connection with nature was the enclosed garden and the view from his bedroom window. He visited the garden to find solace in painting, an early example of what is now called art therapy. In a letter to his brother Theo, van Gogh mentioned that he had begun a painting of &#x27;violet irises&#x27;, a reference to &quot;Irises&quot;. Van Gogh was optimistic about the restorative effects of painting in the hospital garden, writing: &quot;I believe that all my faculties for work will come back to me quite quickly&quot;.

Van Gogh started painting &quot;Irises&quot; within a month of his one-year stay at Saint-Paul-de-Mausole, in May 1889, working from nature in the hospital garden. Van Gogh himself regarded this painting as a study, and there are no known drawings for it. &quot;Irises&quot; bears a direct trace of his work there: embedded in the paint is one of the pollen cones that fall in abundance from the umbrella pines in the garden.

During his stay at the Saint-Paul-de-Mausole asylum, van Gogh painted several variations of irises. A single iris is the subject of another painting. &quot;Iris&quot;, with one full bloom, may have been painted before &quot;Irises&quot; that was filled with blooms. &quot;Iris&quot; must have been painted earlier than &quot;Irises&quot; in the former there is just one full bloom and multiple swelling buds, while &quot;Irises&quot; is filled with blooms, some of which are beginning to fade. Bearded irises bloom for about three weeks (slightly longer if the weather is cool; more briefly if it is hot), so we can guess that these two paintings were separated by about ten days or so. Given the timeframe-Vincent tells his brother in a letter written from two to seven days after his arrival that he had &quot;I have two others on the go — violet irises and a lilac bush.&quot;

After its completion in 1889, van Gogh wrote to Theo to send him four rolls of canvases and seven studies, including &quot;Irises&quot;.

=== The Influence of Japanese Art ===
Van Gogh was a dedicated collector of Japanese prints. Like many European artists of his generation, van Gogh immersed himself in the art of Japan. Japanese artists used large areas of colour in their compositions, often with a sharp diagonal. Japanese artists regularly focused in on detail in the foreground. Van Gogh associated irises with Japan, where the native species were highly prized and had a prominent place in art. Van Gogh adopted these elements in his paintings. but even more curiously, in his imagination, he combined Japan and Provence. For him, both were exotic places that beckoned with a stronger sun, clearer skies and brighter colours.

The painting was most likely influenced by Japanese ukiyo-e woodblock prints like many of his earlier works and those by other artists of the time.

=== Color Scheme ===
A crucial part of van Gogh&#x27;s art was his ideas about color theory. Central to his understanding of color was the work of the French chemist Michel-Eugène Chevreul, whose law of simultaneous color contrast describes how our perception of a particular color is influenced by other colors in the vicinity. Chevreul postulated that each color has a specific complementary color. For example, red, yellow, and blue are complemented by green, purple, and orange. According to Chevreul, juxtaposing a primary color with its complementary secondary coloryellow next to violet, for exampleintensifies both. Many artists found Chevreul&#x27;s observations in Charles Blanc&#x27;s widely distributed G&quot;rammaire des arts du dessin&quot;. In this book, Blanc referred to the use of complementary colors by Eugène Delacroix, a painter van Gogh greatly admired.

=== Exhibition ===
&quot;Irises&quot; was first exhibited at the Société des Artistes Indépendants in September 1889, along with Starry Night Over the Rhone. Submitted by his brother Theo, he wrote to Vincent on 5 September 1889 to let him know the exhibition was open. Theo wrote, &quot;Now I still have to tell you that the exhibition of the Indépendants is open, and that your two pictures are there, the &#x27;Irises&#x27; and &#x27;The Starlit Night&#x27;...They have to put it on the narrow wall of the room, and it strikes the eye from afar. It is a beautiful study full of air and life.&quot;

Theo also wrote about these two pieces to Willemina 27 November 1889: &quot;I submitted two paintings to the exhibition of the Indépendants that made a very good impression. A field of irises and the starry night, view of Arles with the street-lamps and the stars reflecting in the Rhône.&quot;

== Painting Materials ==
The painting materials used in van Gogh&#x27;s artwork were analyzed by researchers and they used both &quot;non-invasive methods and invasive methods&quot; to analyze van Gogh&#x27;s painting materials, according to Devi Ormond, Associate Paintings Conservator at the J. Paul Getty Museum. Non-invasive techniques helped identify “remnants of the red paint that we can’t see with the naked eye,” while invasive methods, like creating cross-sections of the paint layers, revealed that beneath the blue top layer lies a faded violet. “As we go down deeper into the painting, you see this wonderful violet color,” Ormond noted, explaining that it was originally created by mixing geranium lake red and blue—a combination that has since faded to reveal only the blue. 

The analysis also identified cobalt blue and ultramarine pigments, creating &quot;many different shades and hues of violet&quot; across the petals. Dr. Beth Harris observed that some areas now appearing as &quot;muddy brown&quot; were once &quot;a brilliant orange,&quot; while Ormond pointed out that a “dirty-looking brown” in the flowers was initially a vivid red, showing the impact of color fading over time.

== Interpretations ==
Félix Fénéon, an early and avid spokesman for the Neo-Impressionists contributed his account of &quot;Irises&quot;, which appeared in the symbolist review La Vogue in September 1889. Fénéon wrote &quot;&quot;Irises&quot; violently slash into long strips their violet petals on sword-like leaves.&quot;

In a video by Smarthistory, Dr. Scott Allan raises the question of how to categorise the artwork, reflecting on its intriguing viewpoint, which suggests that van Gogh may have been sitting or kneeling. Dr. Allan notes that it doesn&#x27;t fit the traditional definitions of landscape - it lacks &quot;the scale and the space and the view&quot; - or the characteristics of a still life; it is not lifeless nor evokes &quot;nature morte&quot; or &quot;dead nature&quot;. Instead, he emphasises that the irises depicted are &quot;still rooted in the earth&quot; and &quot;intensely alive&quot;. This makes the subject a depiction of vibrant life rather than stillness, &quot;It&#x27;s a picture of moving life connected to the earth&quot;.

==Provenance==
The first owner was Julien &quot;Père&quot; Tanguy, a paint grinder and art dealer whose portrait van Gogh painted three times. In 1892 Tanguy sold &quot;Irises&quot; to art critic and anarchist Octave Mirbeau who was also one of van Gogh&#x27;s first supporters. Mirbeau paid 300 francs for it and later used it as a subject in his novel &quot;In the Sky&quot;.
In 1987, it became the most expensive painting ever sold, setting a record which stood for two and a half years. Then it was sold for US$53.9 million to Alan Bond, but Bond did not have enough money to pay for it. &quot;Irises&quot; was later re-sold in 1990 to the J. Paul Getty Museum in Los Angeles. &quot;Irises&quot; is currently (as of 2022) thirty-first on the inflation-adjusted list of most expensive paintings ever sold and in 102nd place if the effects of inflation are ignored.

<text>HMS &quot;Neptune&quot; was a light cruiser which served with the Royal Navy during World War II. &quot;Neptune&quot; was the fourth ship of its class and was the ninth Royal Navy vessel to carry the name.

==Construction and commissioning==
Built by Portsmouth Dockyard, &quot;Neptune&quot; was laid down on 24 September 1931, launched on 31 January 1933, and commissioned into the Royal Navy on 12 February 1934 with the pennant number 20.

==Operational history==
During World War II, &quot;Neptune&quot; operated with a crew drawn predominantly from the New Zealand Division of the Royal Navy. The ship also carried a large contingent of seconded South African personnel.

In December 1939, several months after war was declared, &quot;Neptune&quot; was patrolling in the South Atlantic in pursuit of German surface raider heavy cruiser . &quot;Neptune&quot;, with other patrolling Royal Navy heavy units, was sent to Uruguay in the aftermath of the Battle of the River Plate. However, she was still in transit when the Germans scuttled &quot;Graf Spee&quot; off Montevideo on 17 December.

&quot;Neptune&quot; was the first British ship to spot the Italian Fleet in the battle of Calabria, on 9 July 1940, marking also the first time since the Napoleonic Wars that the Mediterranean Fleet received the signal &quot;enemy battle fleet in sight&quot;. During the subsequent engagement, she was hit by the Italian light cruiser . The 6-inch shell splinters struck the aircraft catapult and damaged her floatplane beyond repair, its wreckage being thrown into the sea. Minutes later, &quot;Neptune&quot;&#x27;s main guns scored three hits on the heavy cruiser &quot;Bolzano&quot;, inflicting some damage on her torpedo room, below the waterline and the &quot;B&quot; turret.
During 1941, she led Force K, a raiding squadron of cruisers. Their task was to intercept and destroy German and Italian convoys en route to Libya. The convoys were supplying Rommel&#x27;s Afrika Korps in North Africa with troops and equipment.

===Sinking===
Force K was sent out on 18 December 1941, to intercept a convoy bound for Tripoli, right after the brief fleet engagement at sunset known as First Battle of Sirte.

On the night of 19–20 December, &quot;Neptune&quot;, leading the line, struck two mines, part of an Italian minefield laid by an Italian cruiser force in June 1941. The first struck the anti-mine screen, causing no damage. The second struck the bow hull. The other cruisers present, and , also struck mines.

While reversing out of the minefield, &quot;Neptune&quot; struck a third mine, which took off her propellers and left her dead in the water. &quot;Aurora&quot; was unable to render assistance as she was already down to and needed to turn back to Malta. &quot;Penelope&quot; was also unable to assist.

The destroyers and were sent into the minefield to attempt a tow. The former struck a mine and began drifting. &quot;Neptune&quot; then signalled for &quot;Lively&quot; to keep clear. &quot;Kandahar&quot; was later evacuated and scuttled with a torpedo by the destroyer , to prevent her capture.

&quot;Neptune&quot; hit a fourth mine and quickly capsized, killing 737 crew members. Initially some 30 others survived the sinking, but they also died of wounds and exposure in the subsequent days. As a result, only one was still alive when their carley float was picked up five days later by the Italian torpedo boat . The sole survivor, Norman Walton, spent 15 months in an Italian prisoner of war camp. In 1991, Walton travelled to the small city of Nelson, New Zealand, to unveil a memorial to &quot;Neptune&quot;. Of the 764 that perished, 150 were New Zealand sailors, including four from Nelson. A memorial service to &quot;Neptune&quot; and her crew is held each year in Nelson.

<text>Yahalom (Hebrew: יהל&quot;ם, meaning &quot;Diamond&quot;; also a backronym of יחידה הנדסית למשימות מיוחדות, &quot;Special Operations Engineering Unit&quot;) is a &quot;sayeret&quot; (special operations forces) unit of the Israeli Combat Engineering Corps of the Israel Defense Forces (IDF).

== Organization and activities ==
===Role===
Yahalom specializes in special engineering missions that include:
* Accurate demolition through pinpoint planting of explosives
* CBRNE consequence management
* Searching, extracting, and destroying CBRN weapons and explosives
* Tactical emergency medical service and medevac when injured by CBRN weapons, and after incidents associated with defusing and disposing of bombs or high-yield explosives 
* Commando-style raid operations
* Counterinsurgency and counterterrorism (CT)
* Military special operations against guerrilla warfare
* Defusing and disposal of bombs, land mines, and unexploded ordnance¹
* Developing advanced methods and tools for demolition and EOD
* Teaching and training engineering corps soldiers and other special units in demolition and EOD
* Maritime sabotage and obstacle breaching
* Route reconnaissance and clearing routes of IEDs
* Searching and destroying smuggling tunnels

=== General activities ===

Yahalom is a classified unit and almost none of its special activities are exposed to the public. Public accounts of its activities usually just credit a &quot;combat engineering force&quot;; a term that can equally describe regular Engineering sappers, IDF Caterpillar D9 operators and infantry engineering companies. Jane&#x27;s Defence Weekly has claimed that Yahalom are working closely with Sayeret Matkal and Shayetet 13, by providing them with demolition, explosive and sabotage skills. Most of the equipment that Yahalom has developed for its missions is classified. Yahalom maintains secrecy to make it more difficult for enemies to develop countermeasures.

=== Sub-units ===
* Yael (&quot;Ibex&quot;) - a commando demolition unit that conducts long range sabotage, combat engineering, counter terror, and maritime engineering missions. The YAEL team has destroyed military and civilian infrastructure that have been identified as hiding weapons caches, tunnels used to smuggle weapons, and firing positions.
* SAP (&quot;EOD Unit&quot;) - an EOD unit that removes land mines and missile warheads, handles nuclear, biological and chemical (NBC) threats, performs bomb disposal, and accompanies special operations units on missions where their units are at risk of encountering explosive booby traps. YACHSAP is constantly engaged in defusing large IEDs that Hezbollah has set along the Israel-Lebanon border and bombs Palestinians have planted in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip. They often use armored bulldozers when executing those missions. SAP is initials for Bomb disposal.
* Samur (&quot;Weasel&quot;) - a commando unit whose expertise is finding and destroying and if needed fighting in smuggling tunnels and hidden weapon caches. The unit dates back to 2004 when the IDF merged the Southern Command Philadelphi Route Smuggling tunnel experts team into Yahalom to form the Samur platoon.. Samur is also initials for Slikim (Caches) and Minharot (Caves or Tunnels)
* Midron Mushlag (&quot;Snowy Slope&quot;) - a unit whose expertise is penetrating buildings using hot breaching techniques using explosives charges, or cold breaching techniques using hydraulic expanders, crow bars and lock picks.
* Hevzek (&quot;Flash&quot;) - a unit that operated military robots - defunct.
* SAPIR (&quot;Sapphire&quot;) - Aerial ordnance EOD Unit, stationed at major IAF bases and tasked with removal of air ordnance such as bombs, missiles, rockets, etc. It is also tasked with safe removal of unexploded enemy ordnance inside the base perimeter. SAPIR is initials for SAP (Bomb disposal) and Avir (air.)
* Sayfan (&quot;Avocet&quot;) - CBRNE unit, trained to respond to threats from weapons of mass destruction, mostly focused on chemical weaponry.
* Givol (&quot;Flower stem&quot;) - CBRN disposal unit, composed of reserve service personnel.

===Arms and equipment===
*Firearms include the M4 Carbine, handguns, IWI Negev Commando SAW, sniper rifles and combat shotguns.
*Yahalom operates remote-controlled robots inserted into tunnels, obviating the need for human operators to risk their lives. EOD robots for handling improvised explosive devices (IEDs), bombs and explosive charges, and advanced EOD vehicles are standard equipment for all engineering units handling explosives. The Israel Border Police bomb disposal experts use similar equipment. Yahalom also uses the up-armored IDF Caterpillar D9 bulldozer and the remote-controlled Raam HaShachar (&quot;Morning thunder&quot;) version of the D9 (which were found extremely useful for special operation and CT duties), an armored excavator with drills, the IDF Puma combat engineering vehicle (CEV), and Nakpuma, a Nakpadon APC modified to Yahalom&#x27;s requirements.

==Recruitment and training ==
In order to be accepted into the unit one must enlist with the Israeli Engineering Corps and go through basic training (&quot;Tironut&quot;), where commanders identify the best trainees and select them for &quot;Gibbush&quot; (a grueling five-day test of physical and mental condition in intensive field trials). The best graduates of Gibbush are invited to join the unit and receive advance training, which takes another year. Because the training takes a total of 1.4 years, the volunteers must agree to serve an extra year (in addition to the mandatory three year service in the IDF). The training includes training in engineering, explosive ordnance disposal, advanced combat and counter-terrorism.

<text>Bert&#x27;s Big Adventure is a charity created by Bert Weiss of radio station WWWQ-FM (Q100) in Atlanta, United States.

Since 2003, the organization has allowed children who are chronically ill and/or physically challenged and between the ages of 5 and 12, and who prove financial need and live in the Bert Show radio listening area, with the opportunity to travel with their families to Walt Disney World in Orlando, Florida as the VIP guests of the foundation. Because of their special needs and financial strain, this is an experience that many of these children and families would not be able to experience without the help of the foundation.

The Bert&#x27;s Big Adventure trip begins with a chartered flight for these children, their families and a medical staff to Walt Disney World. While in Florida, the foundation will provide hotel accommodations, Walt Disney World park passes, transportation to and from the park, and meal coupons and spending cash for these guests of the foundation.

The inaugural trip in 2003 featured five families who stayed at the Dolphin hotel near Epcot. Air travel was provided by the Atlanta Hawks and Atlanta Thrashers. The 2004 trip featured seven families, who stayed at the Animal Kingdom Lodge near Animal Kingdom. Air travel was provided by Delta Air Lines. The 17th annual trip occurred in 2019. The organization hosted 12 children and their families on the trip.

In addition to the trip to Walt Disney World, Bert&#x27;s Big Adventure also provides the children certain additional charitable services that are necessary to the fulfillment of its charitable purpose. These additional charitable services are provided subsequent to any prior year&#x27;s trip and are available only to the children that have participated in the Walt Disney World trip.

<text>The Israel Police (; ) is the civilian police force of Israel. As with most other police forces in the world, its duties include crime fighting, traffic control, maintaining public safety, and counter-terrorism. It is under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of National Security. The National Headquarters of the Israel Police is located at Kiryat HaMemshala in Jerusalem.

The Israel Police operates throughout Israel, Area C of the West Bank, and the Golan Heights,—in all places in which Israel has civilian control. It is the sole civilian law enforcement agency in Israel: there are no municipal or regional police forces, though some municipalities operate municipal enforcement units that deal with low-level offenses and provide additional security and as such have the power to issue fines, but do not have police authority.

In an emergency, the police can be reached by dialing 100 from any telephone in Israel.

==History==

The Israel Police was established in 1948. It is responsible for public security, maintaining public order, securing public events and rallies, dismantling suspicious objects and explosives (EOD), riot and crowd control, law enforcement, crime fighting, detective work, covert operations against drug networks, investigating suspects, road traffic control, operating the Civil Guard, handling civilian complaints, handling youth violence, educational campaigns.

The Israel Police is a professional force, with some 35,000 persons on the payroll. There are also 70,000 Civil Guard volunteers who carry out part-time work in helping to police their own communities.

The police are divided into the following main divisional groups:



==Regional districts==
The Israel Police is divided into six regional district commands:

* Central District
* Southern District
* Northern District
* Judea and Samaria District
* Tel Aviv District
* Jerusalem District
* Coastal District Police

==Operational units==
* The Security and Community Policing Branch is responsible for ordinary law enforcement tasks such as conducting patrols in public and responding to emergency calls.
* The Israel Border Police (&quot;MAGAV&quot;) is the combat arm of the police and mainly serves in specific areas – the borders, Jerusalem, and the West Bank. It is responsible for law enforcement in the rural countryside and for putting down civil unrest, particularly rioting. It participates in counter-terrorism operations. The Border Police has both professional officers on payroll and conscripts who serve in the Border Police as their mandatory three-year national service. It also has volunteer personnel.
* The Yamam (acronym for Special Police Unit) is the police&#x27;s counter-terrorism and hostage rescue unit. It is known as one of the most experienced and specialized units of its kind in the world. The unit has taken part in hundreds of operations in and outside the borders of Israel.
* The Yasam is a riot police and crowd control unit, and also participates in counter-terror operations. The unit, originally started as Riot Police, was called upon to assist with counter-terror operations, as well as dismantling settlements in accordance with the Israeli court decisions. The Yasam has sub-units of Rapid Response Motorcycle Units.
* The Yamas is a counter-terrorist commando unit. Its operators are trained in conducting operations undercover, disguised as civilians. Although officially part of the Border Police, it is directly subordinate to Shin Bet, the Israeli internal security service.
* The National Traffic Police is the police&#x27;s traffic enforcement arm. It is divided into five regional districts and a national patrol unit.
* The Civil Guard is the police&#x27;s force of part-time volunteer officers, who comprise the majority of Israeli police officers. It is officially a division of the Security and Community Policing Branch. Civil Guard volunteers have limited police powers. They carry out patrols in public, are trained to provide the initial response to any security situation they encounter until regular police forces arrive, and partake in traffic control. The Civil Guard also has search and rescue teams.
* Lahav 433 is the police&#x27;s unit for investigations of serious crimes and corruption.
* The Police SIGINT Unit is responsible for signals intelligence (SIGINT) activities.
* The Dog Handling Unit is responsible for operating police dogs.
* The Police Aerial Unit operates police helicopters.
* The Police Marine Unit is responsible for operating boats and has police divers.
* The Israel Police Bomb Disposal Unit is the bomb squad of the police. It deals with operations and investigations which involve suspicious objects, explosive devices or military ordnance.
* The Seif Unit is responsible for tackling crime in the Israeli-Arab population.
* The Yoav Unit is responsible for enforcement of land use and construction regulations in the Negev, particularly among Bedouin communities.
* The Division of Identification and Forensic Science is responsible for forensic science in investigations. It has laboratories dealing with latent fingerprint analysis, arson investigation, mass spectrometry and explosive analysis, digital evidence, DNA and other areas of biology, firearms, and questioned document examination.
* The Internal Investigations Department is responsible for investigating wrongdoing by police personnel. It is officially independent from the police and under the jurisdiction of the Justice Ministry.

==Weapons and equipment==

Each patrol officer is armed with a pistol (handgun) which he or she usually also carries while off duty. Also, each patrol car must have at least one long-arm (i.e. rifle). Police volunteers are usually armed with an M1 Carbine, which they return to the armory after they finish their duty (they do not take the rifle home, but may sign one out for escorting field trips, etc.). Volunteers who have a gun license may use their own personal handgun as a personal defense weapon while on duty, under the condition that the gun and ammunition type is authorized by the police (9 mm). Common pistols owned and carried by volunteers include Glock and CZ-75 designs.

Specialized armaments such as automatic rifles, bolt-action rifles and non-lethal weapons are assigned according to activity and not on personal basis. Border Guard personnel, however, carry an M16 or M4 rifle as a standard personal weapon and can carry it home while off duty (like regular infantry in the Israel Defense Forces).

==Ranks==
==Awards and recognition==
* On July 6, 2004, the Israel Police received an award from the Anti-Defamation League for its counter-terror efforts and for passing seminars of counter-terror measures to the FBI and local police in the US.
* In October 2010, YAMAM, the counter-terrorism unit of the Israeli Police, won the &quot;Urban Shield&quot; SWAT competition held by the Alameda County Sheriff&#x27;s Office, setting a new record in the competition.
* In October 2011, YAMAM won the &quot;Urban Shield&quot; SWAT competition held by the Alameda County Sheriff&#x27;s Office a second time.

==General Commissioners==

==Women police==
In 2015, the editorial of &quot;Haaretz&quot; claimed &quot;Women constitute at least 30 percent of the police force&quot; and criticized there were no women who have reached the rank of major general.

==Controversies==
A 2014 analysis by Yesh Din questioned the professionalism of the police force of the Judea and Samaria District (also known as the West Bank) as only 7.4% of reported attacks by Israeli citizens on Palestinian persons and property had led to indictments.
In 2015, several senior officers resigned due to criminal investigations or accusations of sexual harassment of employees. Five police officers at the rank of major general resigned in the preceding 18 months amid scandal. The February 2015 announcement that another senior Israel Police officer was under investigation for sexual harassment was criticized by women&#x27;s and rape victim advocacy groups, who held protests at police headquarters in a number of cities.

An ongoing Israeli programme of inviting U.S. police groups to study Israeli policework in sponsored visits has been the object of controversy for several years.

<doc id="745601" wikidata="Q266917" url="?curid=745601" title="Valerie Bertinelli">
<text>Valerie Anne Bertinelli (born April 23, 1960) is an American actress and television personality. She first achieved recognition as an adolescent, portraying Barbara Cooper Royer on the sitcom &quot;One Day at a Time&quot; (1975–1984), for which she won two Golden Globe Awards for Best Supporting Actress in a Series, Miniseries or Television Film. She subsequently earned adult stardom as Gloria on the religious drama series &quot;Touched by an Angel&quot; (2001–2003), and Melanie Moretti on the sitcom &quot;Hot in Cleveland&quot; (2010–2015), which brought her a Screen Actors Guild Award nomination. In 2012, she received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.

Bertinelli has hosted several programs for Food Network, such as the cooking shows &quot;Valerie&#x27;s Home Cooking&quot; (2015–2023) and &quot;Kids Baking Championship&quot; (2015–2024), winning two Daytime Emmy Awards for the former out of six nominations. In December 2021, she signed a new deal with Food Network .

==Early life and education==
Bertinelli was born in Wilmington, Delaware to Nancy (née Carvin) and Andrew Bertinelli, a General Motors executive. Her father is of Italian descent and her mother of English descent. She has three brothers, David, Patrick, and Drew and young sister Gretchen. An older brother, Mark, died at 17 months from accidental poisoning before she was born.

Due to her father&#x27;s career, the family frequently moved. They lived in Claymont, Delaware; Clarkston, Michigan; Shreveport, Louisiana; Oklahoma City, Oklahoma; and the Los Feliz section of Los Angeles, where Bertinelli studied acting at the Tami Lynn School of Artists. She attended Granada Hills High School but never earned a diploma. She was raised Roman Catholic.

==Career==
Following her appearance in an episode of &quot;Apple&#x27;s Way&quot;, Bertinelli was approached by producer Norman Lear to audition for the role of cooperative daughter Barbara Cooper in the sitcom &quot;One Day at a Time&quot;, which debuted in late 1975 when Bertinelli was 15. She appeared in 208 of the 209 episodes before it left the air on May 28, 1984, and she won two Golden Globe Awards for her performances. In the 2005 &quot;One Day at a Time Reunion Special&quot;, she was reunited with cast members Bonnie Franklin, Mackenzie Phillips and Pat Harrington Jr. to watch memorable clips from the show&#x27;s nine seasons. They talked about actors who had appeared on the show as well as Phillips&#x27;s drug problem, which had wreaked havoc on-set and caused Phillips to be fired.

After &quot;One Day at a Time&quot;, Bertinelli starred in several TV films and miniseries and made many guest appearances on other television shows. In the 1990s, she starred in two short-lived sitcoms: &quot;Sydney&quot;, as the title character, a private detective (with Matthew Perry and Craig Bierko); and &quot;Café Americain&quot;. In 2001, she joined the cast of &quot;Touched by an Angel&quot; for its last two seasons.

In 2007, she became a spokeswoman for the Jenny Craig weight-loss program, and appeared in several commercials. The following year, she released the autobiography, &quot;Losing It: And Gaining My Life Back One Pound at a Time&quot;, which culminates in a description of her Jenny Craig diet experience. In 2009 she wrote the follow-up book &quot;Finding It: And Satisfying My Hunger for Life Without Opening the Fridge.&quot; From 2010 to 2015, she starred in the sitcom &quot;Hot in Cleveland&quot; with Betty White, Wendie Malick and Jane Leeves. After a successful six-season run, its final episode aired on June 3, 2015.

In 2015, Bertinelli began hosting &quot;Valerie&#x27;s Home Cooking,&quot; and &quot;Kids Baking Championship&quot; with cake artist Duff Goldman on the Food Network. She won two Daytime Emmy Awards for her work on &quot;Valerie&#x27;s Home Cooking&quot;. In 2019, she hosted two other Food Network shows, &quot;Family Food Showdown&quot; and &quot;Family Restaurant Rivals.&quot; In June 2021, it was announced that Bertinelli would star opposite Demi Lovato in NBC&#x27;s single-camera comedy pilot, &quot;Hungry&quot;. In December 2021, she signed a new deal with Food Network. In January 2022, she released her memoir &quot;Enough Already: Learning to Love the Way I Am Today&quot;. In January 2024, she confirmed that she had been cut from &quot;Kids Baking Championship&quot; by Food Network.

== Personal life ==
According to his autobiography, Paul Shaffer went on a &quot;few fun dates&quot; with Bertinelli when she was 16 and he was 27.
Bertinelli married rock musician Eddie Van Halen in 1981. They had a son, Wolfgang (born March 16, 1991). They separated in 2001 and divorced on December 20, 2007. In her autobiography, Bertinelli wrote that the main reasons for her divorce were her husband&#x27;s cocaine addiction, and his refusal to quit smoking despite being diagnosed with oral cancer and losing one-third of his tongue in the treatment process. After their divorce, they remained amicable, and she was at his bedside when he died.

In May 2010, Bertinelli announced her engagement to financial planner Tom Vitale, with whom she had begun a relationship in 2004. They were married on January 1, 2011, in Malibu, California. She has four step-children through her marriage to Vitale. Both her ex-husband, Eddie Van Halen, and their son, Wolfgang Van Halen, attended the wedding. Bertinelli filed for legal separation from Vitale on November 24, 2021, citing irreconcilable differences. Their divorce was finalized on November 22, 2022.

Bertinelli ran in the April 2010 Boston Marathon to benefit the Dana–Farber Cancer Institute, completing it in a time of 5:14:37. In 2014, she appeared on &quot;Who Do You Think You Are?&quot; and found out that she was descended from King Edward I of England.

<doc id="745602" wikidata="Q1054060" url="?curid=745602" title="Violin Concerto (Mendelssohn)">
<text>Felix Mendelssohn&#x27;s Violin Concerto in E minor, Op. 64, MWV O 14, is his last concerto. Well received at its premiere, it has remained among the most prominent and highly-regarded violin concertos. It holds a central place in the violin repertoire and has developed a reputation as an essential concerto for all aspiring concert violinists to master, and usually one of the first Romantic era concertos they learn. A typical performance lasts just under half an hour.

Mendelssohn originally proposed the idea of the violin concerto to Ferdinand David, a close friend and then concertmaster of the Leipzig Gewandhaus Orchestra. Although conceived in 1838, the work took another six years to complete and was not premiered until 1845. During this time, Mendelssohn maintained a regular correspondence with David, who gave him many suggestions. The work itself was one of the foremost violin concertos of the Romantic era and was influential on many other composers.

Although the concerto consists of three movements in a standard fast–slow–fast structure and each movement follows a traditional form, it was innovative and included many novel features for its time. Distinctive aspects include the almost immediate entrance of the violin at the beginning of the work (rather than following an orchestral preview of the first movement&#x27;s major themes, as was typical in Classical-era concertos) and the through-composed form of the concerto as a whole, in which the three movements are melodically and harmonically connected and played (each movement immediately following the previous one without any pauses).

Many violinists have recorded the concerto and it is performed in concerts and classical music competitions. It was recorded by Nathan Milstein and the New York Philharmonic as an album and released as the first LP record upon the format&#x27;s introduction in 1948.

== History ==

Following his appointment in 1835 as principal conductor of the Leipzig Gewandhaus Orchestra, Mendelssohn named his childhood friend Ferdinand David as the orchestra&#x27;s concertmaster. The work&#x27;s origins derive from this professional collaboration. In a letter dated 30 July 1838, Mendelssohn wrote to David: 

The concerto took another six years to complete. There are many possible reasons for the delay, including self-doubt, his third symphony and an unhappy period in Berlin after a request from King Frederick William IV of Prussia. Nevertheless, Mendelssohn and David kept up a regular correspondence during this time, with Mendelssohn seeking technical and compositional advice. Indeed, this violin concerto was the first of many to have been composed with the input of a professional violinist, and would influence many future collaborations.
The autograph score is dated 16 September 1844, but Mendelssohn was still seeking advice from David until its premiere. The concerto was first performed in Leipzig on 13 March 1845 with Ferdinand David as soloist. Mendelssohn was unable to conduct due to illness and the premiere was conducted by the Danish composer Niels Gade. Mendelssohn first conducted the concerto on 23 October 1845 again with Ferdinand David as soloist.

An autograph manuscript of the concerto re-emerged in 1989 in the Biblioteka Jagiellonska in Kraków, leading to some scholarly scepticism of the veracity of Breitkopf &amp; Härtel&#x27;s 1862 edition of the published score. Some notable differences include the tempo character of the first movement being handwritten as &quot;&quot;Allegro con fuoco&quot; (meaning: with fire) rather than the published &quot;Allegro molto appassionato&quot;&quot; (very impassioned) as well as significant differences in the solo violin&#x27;s passage-work.

== Instrumentation ==
The concerto is scored for solo violin and a standard orchestra of its period, consisting of two flutes, two oboes, two clarinets in A, two bassoons, two natural horns, two natural trumpets, timpani, and strings.

== Movements ==
The concerto consists of three movements with the following tempo markings:
# Allegro molto appassionato (E minor)
# Andante (C major)
# Allegretto non troppo – Allegro molto vivace (E major)

=== Allegro molto appassionato ===
12–14 minutes
&lt;score sound=&quot;1&quot;&gt; \relative c {\set Score.tempoHideNote = ##t \set Staff.midiInstrument = #&quot;violin&quot; \tempo &quot;Allegro molto appassionato&quot; 2 = 100 \key e \minor \time 2/2 \partial 2 b4.\p b8 b2( g4) e&#x27; e2( b4_) g&#x27;( fis e c e) b2. b4 c(b8 a8) a4 a e&#x27;2.( b4) c( b8 a) a4 a dis2 } &lt;/score&gt;
Instead of an orchestral tutti, the concerto opens with the almost immediate entry of the solo violin, playing the very tune in E minor that gave Mendelssohn no peace. Following a bravura of rapidly ascending notes, the opening theme is then restated by the orchestra. There is then a frenetic chromatic transition passage as the music subsides and modulates into a tranquil second subject theme in G major. The melody is initially played by the woodwinds with the soloist providing a pedal note on an open G string. The tune is played by the solo violin itself before a short codetta ends the exposition section of the opening movement. The opening two themes are then combined in the development section, where the music builds up to the innovative cadenza, which Mendelssohn wrote out in full rather than allowing the soloist to improvise. The cadenza builds up speed through rhythmic shifts from quavers to quaver-triplets and finally to semiquavers, which require ricochet bowing from the soloist. This serves as a link to the recapitulation, where the opening melody is played by the orchestra, accompanied by the continuing ricochet arpeggios by the soloist. During the recapitulation, the opening themes are repeated with the second theme being played in the E major before returning to E minor for the closing of the movement. The music gathers speed into the coda, which is marked &quot;Presto&quot;, before a variant of the original chromatic transition passage ends the first movement.

=== Andante ===
7–9 minutes
&lt;score sound=&quot;1&quot;&gt; \relative c&quot; {\set Score.tempoHideNote = ##t \set Staff.midiInstrument = #&quot;violin&quot; \tempo &quot;Andante&quot; 8 = 100 \key c \major \time 6/8 e4. f8( d b) a&#x27;4. g4. ~~ g8) f( e d a f&#x27;) e4.( d4) r8 g,8( c e) d4( b16 a) g8( c e) d4( b16 a) g8\&lt;( c e\!) g4( e16 d) c8( a f&#x27;) d4} &lt;/score&gt;
The bassoon sustains its B from the final chord of the first movement before moving up a semitone to middle C. This serves as a key change from the E minor opening movement into the lyrical C major slow movement. The movement is in ternary form and is reminiscent of Mendelssohn&#x27;s own &quot;Songs Without Words&quot;. The theme to the darker, middle section in A minor is first introduced by the orchestra before the violin then takes up both the melody and the accompaniment simultaneously. The tremulous accompaniment requires nimble dexterity from the soloist before the music returns to the main lyrical C major theme, this time leading towards a serene conclusion.

=== Allegretto non troppo – Allegro molto vivace ===
6–7 minutes
&lt;score sound=&quot;1&quot;&gt; \relative c&quot; {\set Score.tempoHideNote = ##t \set Staff.midiInstrument = #&quot;violin&quot; \tempo &quot;Allegro molto vivace&quot; 2 = 80 \key e \major \time 4/4 \partial 4 gis16\p( b_&quot;leggiero&quot; e gis b8-.) ais16( cis b8-.) e-.( b-. gis-. e-. fis-. gis-.) fisis16 (a! gis8) b-.( gis-. e-. b-.) dis16( cis b8) fis&#x27;16(e b8) dis16( cis b8) fis&#x27;16(dis b8) dis16( cis b8)} &lt;/score&gt;
Following the second movement, there is a brief fourteen-bar transitional passage in E minor for solo violin and strings only. This leads into the lively and effervescent finale, the whole of which is in E major and whose opening is marked by a trumpet fanfare. This movement is in sonata rondo form with an opening theme requiring fast passage work from the soloist. The opening exposition leads into a brief second B major theme which is played by the soloist and builds to a series of rapidly ascending and descending arpeggios, reminiscent of the cadenza from the first movement. The orchestra then plays a variation of the opening melody, after which the music moves into a short development section in G major. The recapitulation is essentially similar to the exposition, apart from the addition of a counter-melody in the strings. The second theme is repeated, this time in the home key of E major. There is almost a small cadenza near the end of the movement when the woodwinds play the main tune against prolonged trills from the solo violin. The concerto then concludes with a frenetic coda.

== Analysis ==
The concerto is innovative in many respects. In the first movement alone, Mendelssohn departs from the typical form of a Classical concerto in many ways, the most immediate being the entry of the soloist almost from the outset, which also occurs in his First Piano Concerto. Although the first movement is mostly in the conventional sonata form, Mendelssohn has the first theme played by the solo violin and then by the orchestra. Classical concertos typically opened with an orchestral introduction followed by a version of essentially the same material that incorporates the soloist.

The cadenza is also novel in that it is written out as part of the concerto and located before the recapitulation. In a typical Classical concerto, the cadenza is improvised by the performing soloist and occurs at the end of a movement, after the recapitulation and just before the final coda. Mendelssohn&#x27;s written cadenza was not included in the first published version of the concerto, but instead a &quot;streamlined&quot; version by Ferdinand David without the contrapuntal complexity of the original. This is the most played version today, although some artists, e.g. Arabella Steinbacher, play Mendelssohn&#x27;s original. Joshua Bell performs the concerto with his own cadenza.

The violin concerto stands out from previous concertos with its connected movements. There is no break between the first and second movements, with a bassoon note held between the two. The bridging passage between the last two movements begins almost immediately after the slow movement. The melody is similar to that of the opening, which hints at the cyclic form of the piece. The linking was designed to eliminate applause between movements. This would have come as a surprise to Mendelssohn&#x27;s audience, who, unlike today&#x27;s, were used to applauding between movements.

The concerto also calls on the soloist to function as an accompanist to the orchestra for extended periods, such as the ricochet arpeggios at the start of the recapitulation. This too was novel for a violin concerto of its time.

== Legacy ==
Mendelssohn&#x27;s Violin Concerto influenced the concertos of many other composers, who adopted aspects of it in their own concertos.
For example, the unusual placement of the cadenza before the recapitulation is reflected in the violin concerto of Tchaikovsky (where the cadenza is similarly placed) and the violin concerto of Sibelius (where the cadenza serves to extend the development section). Moreover, following this concerto it was very rare for a composer to leave a cadenza unwritten for the soloist to improvise as in the days of Mozart and Beethoven. The linking of the three movements also influenced other concertos, such as Liszt&#x27;s Second Piano Concerto.

The concerto itself was an instant success, warmly received at its premiere and well received by contemporary critics. By the end of the nineteenth century, the piece was already considered one of the greatest violin concertos in the repertoire. It would become one of Mendelssohn&#x27;s most popular pieces, and was still regularly performed even when interest in his music declined in the early twentieth century. In 1906, the year before his death, the celebrated violinist Joseph Joachim told the guests at his 75th birthday party:

The work has developed a reputation as an essential one for aspiring violin virtuosi to conquer. This has led to its becoming virtually ubiquitous in the discography of concert violinists, even including those who were only active at the very dawn of recorded sound and of whom very little recorded music exists, such as Eugène Ysaÿe. Even so, it remains technically challenging and is generally considered to be as difficult as many other famous counterparts.

<text>Ernesto Natali Lombardi (April 6, 1908 – September 26, 1977) was an American professional baseball player. He played in Major League Baseball (MLB) as a catcher for the Brooklyn Robins, Cincinnati Reds, Boston Braves, and New York Giants during a career that spanned 17 years, from 1931 through 1947. He had several nicknames, including &quot;Schnozz&quot;, &quot;Lumbago&quot;, &quot;Bocci&quot;, &quot;the Cyrano of the Iron Mask&quot;, and &quot;Lom&quot;. He was inducted into the National Baseball Hall of Fame in 1986.

Baseball writer Bill James called Lombardi &quot;the slowest man to ever play major league baseball well.&quot; Lombardi was an All-Star for seven seasons, he hit over .300 for ten seasons and finished his major league career with a .306 batting average despite infields playing very deep for the sloth-like baserunner. He is listed at 6&#x27;3&quot; and 230 lbs, but he probably approached 300 lbs towards the end of his career. He was also known as a gentle giant, and this made him hugely popular among Cincinnati fans.

==Early life==
Lombardi was born and raised in Oakland, California. He attended McClymonds High School, the same school from which baseball star Frank Robinson and basketball star Bill Russell later graduated.

==Baseball career==

===Minor League ===
Lombardi started his professional baseball career for his hometown Oakland Oaks of the Pacific Coast League. He hit over .350 with power in 1929 and 1930 and had a strong arm. His talents were soon noticed by the Brooklyn Robins, who purchased his contract for $50,000.

=== Major league ===

Lombardi played his rookie season for the Robins in 1931 and hit .297. However, Brooklyn had too many quality catchers at the time and Robins&#x27; manager Wilbert Robinson contemplated using the strong-armed Lombardi as a pitcher. Instead, he was traded to the Cincinnati Reds shortly before the start of spring training for the 1932 season. Lombardi flourished in his first year for Cincinnati, batting .303 with 11 home runs and 68 runs batted in. In 1935, he hit .343, but was not selected as an All-Star until 1936, when he hit .333 that season. In 1937, he hit .334 and made the All-Star team. In 1938, he was selected as an All-Star again, and hit a league-leading .342 with 19 home runs, drove in 95 runs, and won the National League (NL) Most Valuable Player Award. Lombardi became one of the Reds&#x27; most productive and popular players. He was the catcher for left-hander Johnny Vander Meer&#x27;s back-to-back no-hitters, accomplished on June 11 and June 15, 1938. He was again an All-Star the next two seasons, and his hitting skills and leadership helped the Reds to the National League pennant in 1939 and 1940, and the World Series title in 1940.
While Lombardi played for the Reds as the starting catcher, three-year teammate and backup catcher Willard Hershberger became the only major league player to commit suicide during a season. Hershberger, who thought he had been having difficulties playing as a replacement for an injured Lombardi for a few games in 1940, told manager Bill McKechnie in private that &quot;my father killed himself, and I&#x27;m going to do it, too!&quot; After failing to appear at the stadium the next day, the Reds checked Hershberger&#x27;s room at the hotel on August 3 to find that he had slit his throat and wrist.

In 1942, the Boston Braves (NL team) purchased Lombardi&#x27;s contract, and he became an All-Star and led the NL and Braves that season with a .330 batting average (albeit, in only 309 at-bats); the next batting title to be won by a catcher came more than 60 years later when Joe Mauer won the AL batting title in 2006. As of 2017, Lombardi remains only one of three NL catchers to win a batting title (the others are Cincinnati Reds catcher Bubbles Hargrove in 1926 and SF Giants catcher Buster Posey in 2012). His final All-Star selection was during the 1943 season (MLB cancelled the 1945 All-Star Game and no All-Stars were named that season), before Boston traded him to the New York Giants before the 1944 season began. He enjoyed three productive if unspectacular seasons with the Giants before seeing his playing time diminish over the next two seasons. Lombardi retired after the 1947 season, having compiled a .306 career batting average, 1,792 hits, 277 doubles, 27 triples, 190 home runs, 990 RBI, 601 runs and 430 walks.

The six foot, three inch, 230-pound Lombardi was legendarily slow-footed, and during the course of his major league career he grounded into 261 double plays. Aside from being the leader in grounding into double plays during four seasons, he also holds the MLB record for grounding into a double play once in every 25.3 plate appearances. An opposing manager once jokingly said that Lombardi was so slow, he ran like he was carrying a piano — and the man who was tuning it. Defenses would often position all four infielders in the outfield when Lombardi came to the plate. Despite this, he became an outstanding catcher on the basis of his strong, accurate arm and his ability to &quot;call&quot; a game.

Lombardi began the 1948 season with the Sacramento Solons. In May 1948, Sacramento sold Lombardi back to the Oakland Oaks.

==&quot;Lombardi&#x27;s Big Snooze&quot;==
During the fourth game of the 1939 World Series, in the 10th inning, with the score tied and runners on first and third, Joe DiMaggio singled. One run scored, then Reds outfielder Ival Goodman fumbled the ball. Yankees right fielder Charlie Keller, well known for his sturdy physique, beat the throw to catcher Lombardi and inadvertently hit &quot;The Schnozz&quot; in his groin. Unfortunately for the Reds and Lombardi, he had failed to wear his protective cup and Lombardi was in pain and dazed. DiMaggio raced around the bases and scored while the ball was just a few feet away from the afflicted Lombardi. The press was hugely critical of the sensitive catcher because of this and it came to be known as &quot;Lombardi&#x27;s Big Snooze&quot;. Bill James, in his &quot;Historical Baseball Abstract&quot;, says that &quot;Lombardi was now the Bill Buckner of the 1930s, even more innocent than Buckner, and Buckner has plenty of people who should be holding up their hands to share his disgrace.&quot; James called Lombardi&#x27;s selection as the Series goat &quot;absurd.&quot; James noted the Yankees were already ahead three games to none and that DiMaggio&#x27;s run merely made the final score 7–4 instead of 6–4.

==Later life==
In 1953, Lombardi had been battling depression and agreed to go to a sanatorium. While on his way to the facility, Lombardi slit his throat from ear to ear with a razor. He received blood transfusions and was initially listed in critical condition, but within a couple of days newspaper reports said that he would survive. Lombardi worked as an attendant in the Candlestick Park press office and later as a gas station attendant in Oakland, California. Lombardi was inducted into the Cincinnati Reds Hall of Fame in 1958. He died in 1977 and was buried at the Mountain View Cemetery in Oakland.

==Legacy==
Lombardi was posthumously inducted into the Bay Area Sports Hall of Fame in 1982 and the National Baseball Hall of Fame in 1986. In 1981, Lawrence Ritter and Donald Honig included him in their book &quot;The 100 Greatest Baseball Players of All Time&quot;. In 2004, The Cincinnati Reds dedicated a bronze statue of Lombardi at the entrance of Great American Ball Park. He was honored along with four other Crosley Field Era Reds: Joe Nuxhall, Ted Kluszewski, Frank Robinson, and Pete Rose.

The Cincinnati Chapter of the BBWAA annually award the Ernie Lombardi Award to the Reds&#x27; team MVP.

<text>WSB-TV (channel 2) is a television station in Atlanta, Georgia, United States, affiliated with ABC. It is the flagship television property of locally based Cox Media Group, which has owned the station since its inception, and is sister to radio stations WSB (750 AM), WSBB-FM (95.5), WSRV (97.1 FM), WSB-FM (98.5) and WALR-FM (104.1). The stations share studios at the WSB Television and Radio Group building on West Peachtree Street in Midtown Atlanta; WSB-TV&#x27;s transmitter is located on the border of the city&#x27;s Poncey-Highland and Old Fourth Ward neighborhoods.

WSB-TV is the second largest ABC-affiliated station by market size that is not owned and operated by the network (the largest being Tegna-owned WFAA in Dallas).

==History==
WSB-TV first began broadcasting on September 29, 1948, originally broadcasting on channel 8. It is the first television station in Georgia, and only the second station south of Washington, D.C., five months behind Richmond, Virginia&#x27;s WTVR-TV (channel 6). The station was founded by James M. Cox, publisher of &quot;The Atlanta Journal&quot;, and who also owned WSB radio (AM 750 and 104.5 FM, now on 98.5 FM). Cox Enterprises owned WSB AM-FM-TV under the banner of Miami Valley Broadcasting Inc., which later changed its name to the current Cox Media Group. The station was originally a primary NBC affiliate, owing to its radio sister&#x27;s longtime affiliation with NBC Radio. It also carried some ABC programming from 1948 until 1951.

In 1950, Cox bought Atlanta&#x27;s other major newspaper, &quot;The Atlanta Constitution,&quot; from its longtime owners, the Howell family. Both newspapers owned broadcast properties. Included in the latter were AM station WCON (550 kHz), which ceased operations May 31, 1950, in favor of the clear channel WSB; WCON-FM, which was merged with WSB-FM on the former&#x27;s 98.5 MHz frequency; and the construction permit for WCON-TV (channel 2), which before the merger had begun construction on its tower at 780 Willoughby Way that it billed as the world&#x27;s tallest. However, Cox now had a problem. At the time, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) did not permit the sale of television station construction permits, considering it &quot;trafficking&quot;. Cox thus had no choice but to keep the construction permit for WCON-TV rather than the already-operating WSB-TV. To solve the problem, Cox sold the channel 8 license for $525,000 to Broadcasting, Inc., a group of local businessmen, in 1951, with plans to move the WSB-TV call letters and intellectual unit to channel 2. The sale was challenged by applicants for additional stations that were affected by the then-ongoing freeze on new construction permits, including Georgia Tech (owners of WGST radio) and Decatur radio station owner, E. D. Rivers, in part because planned allocation changes meant that there would be no further commercial VHF stations for Atlanta and they sought to operate the channel as well.

The FCC dismissed the complaints and approved the sale of the channel 8 license to Broadcasting, Inc., in August 1951. In September 1951, channel 2 began broadcasting test patterns as WCON-TV—the only time the call letters were used on air—receiving reception reports from as far as away. On September 30, WSB-TV officially moved to channel 2; channel 8 returned at 5 p.m. that day as ABC affiliate WLTV. In 1953, WLTV became WLWA-TV (now WXIA-TV) and was moved to channel 11 in order to resolve interference with channel 9 at Rome, Georgia. (The channel 8 allocation was then moved to Athens and reserved for non-commercial educational use; it is now WGTV, a PBS member station, and also the flagship television station of Georgia Public Broadcasting.) Due to the way the 1950–51 transactions were structured legally, WXIA operates under the license originally granted to WSB-TV in 1948, while the latter&#x27;s present license is a new one dating from 1951.

With the move to channel 2, WSB-TV significantly increased its coverage area; it now provided at least secondary coverage from the Tennessee-Georgia state line to Albany, as far west as the Alabama-Georgia line, and as far east as the outer fringes of Upstate South Carolina. The analog channel 2 signal traveled a very long distance under normal conditions, and WSB-TV could now better penetrate the more rugged parts of the north Georgia mountains.

In 1956, the WSB stations moved into the noted &quot;White Columns&quot; building, designed and built according to the Colonial Revival style, a defining characteristic of Atlanta architecture. They would remain there for 43 years, until a much more modernist concrete and glass facility was built adjacent to it (on the same property) in 1998. The new building, which has been dubbed &quot;Digital White Columns&quot; by some, is located just off Atlanta&#x27;s famed Peachtree Street, on the dead-end northern portion of West Peachtree Street which is actually &quot;east&quot; of Peachtree Street. This is near the Brookwood Hills area, and just east of the &quot;Brookwood split&quot;, a highway interchange where the Downtown Connector splits into Interstates 75 and 85 on the north end. The older building was razed shortly after the new building was occupied. The original columns that stood on the front portico of the old building were placed in a garden area alongside the new building. Brand new white columns have been placed inside the glass-enclosed lobby of the newer building. WSB-TV is located less than one block south of the building formerly utilized by WXIA when that station moved its operations to WATL&#x27;s studios in 2008.

In December 1965, WSB was the first television station in Georgia to broadcast live in color, beginning with Ruth Kent&#x27;s &quot;Today in Georgia&quot; program.

In 1972, the station aired the name of a murdered rape victim in violation of Georgia&#x27;s shield law. The U.S. Supreme Court overturned the law in &quot;Cox Broadcasting Corp. v. Cohn&quot; in 1975.

ABC was the highest-rated network for most of the late 1970s and, at that time, was looking for stronger affiliates across the country, including Atlanta. ABC&#x27;s longtime Atlanta outlet, WXIA, frequently traded second place with WAGA. However, WSB-TV was the far-and-away market leader despite being affiliated with last-place NBC. In June 1980, WSB announced that it would drop NBC and affiliate with ABC; WXIA subsequently agreed to join NBC. Some network daytime shows changed stations in August, while the full affiliation switch occurred on September 1. In January 1986, the station debuted the current number &quot;2&quot; logo it continues to use to this day.

On March 12, 2011, WSB-TV and WGCL-TV turned on their ATSC-M/H signals for the first time, becoming the first stations in the Atlanta area to offer Mobile DTV broadcasts.

On July 24, 2018, WSB-TV parent Cox Enterprises announced that it was &quot;exploring strategic options&quot; for Cox Media Group&#x27;s television stations, which the company said could involve &quot;partnering or merging these stations into a larger TV company&quot;. Cox Media Group&#x27;s president, Kim Guthrie, subsequently clarified to trade publication &quot;Radio &amp; Television Business Report&quot; that the company was solely seeking &quot;a merger or partnership&quot; and not an outright sale of the television stations.

In February 2019, it was announced that Apollo Global Management would acquire Cox Media Group and Northwest Broadcasting&#x27;s stations. Although the group planned to operate under the name Terrier Media, it was later announced in June 2019 that Apollo would also acquire Cox&#x27;s radio and advertising businesses, and retain the Cox Media Group name. The sale was completed on December 17, 2019.

==Programming==
===Past programming preemptions and deferrals===
As an NBC affiliate, WSB-TV preempted programs airing from noon to 2 p.m. in favor of airing a feature film presentation during that time. It would also air at least one film from its lineup in prime time, and it would also preempt the non-NFL-related NBC Sports programs in favor of carrying still another film, plus &quot;The Lawrence Welk Show&quot;.

In 2004, WSB-TV and the other two ABC stations under Cox ownership (WSOC-TV in Charlotte and WFTV in Orlando) declined to telecast the Steven Spielberg film &quot;Saving Private Ryan&quot; due to the graphic violence and profanity in the film after the FCC stepped up its vigilance on these matters following the Janet Jackson–Justin Timberlake Super Bowl incident that year. The FCC declared the film as not indecent once the telecast of the war drama concluded.

===Sports programming===
The station was the original local television broadcaster of the relocated Atlanta Braves baseball team, carrying the games from 1966 to 1972, until the Braves telecasts moved to WTCG (now WPCH-TV) in 1973. Its sister AM station was the longtime radio flagship of the Braves, carrying the broadcasts for 38 out of the 46 years that the franchise has been in Atlanta, dating back to 1966. Ernie Johnson, Sr., a former Braves pitcher and father of his namesake Turner Sports broadcaster, with future Hall of Fame announcer Milo Hamilton (who simultaneously pulled double-duty anchoring Channel 2&#x27;s sportscasts during this time) were the main announcers for what was then the largest television network in the history of baseball. WSB-TV also aired all Braves games whenever they appeared on NBC&#x27;s coverage from 1966 to 1980, and then with ABC from 1981 to 1989, along with The Baseball Network regional coverage in 1994 and 1995, including games 1, 4, and 5 in the 1995 World Series, which the Braves won (games 2, 3, and the clinching game 6 aired on NBC, thus locally on WXIA).

WSB-TV has also been involved with the NFL&#x27;s Atlanta Falcons; from 1970 to 1979, it aired sold-out games at Atlanta Fulton County Stadium where Falcons hosted an AFC team from NBC, then from 1980 to 2005, &quot;Monday Night Football&quot; from ABC. The station has served as the local outlet for Falcons games which are a part of &quot;ESPN Monday Night Football&quot; since 2006, when it moved from ABC to ESPN as part of the NFL&#x27;s requirements to syndicate cable games to local markets. WSB-TV served as the official local broadcaster of Super Bowl XXXIV, held at the Georgia Dome.

The station airs select Atlanta Hawks games through ABC&#x27;s contract with the NBA.

===News operation===
WSB-TV presently broadcasts 47 hours, 35 minutes of locally produced newscasts each week (with 7 hours, 5 minutes each weekday, 5 hours, 35 minutes on Saturdays and 6 hours, 35 minutes on Sundays).

Local news programming has had a strong presence on channel 2 since its debut, and it has led the news ratings in Atlanta for as long as records have been kept. WSB-TV is one of the few Big Three affiliates to carry a midday newscast on weekends (sister stations WFTV in Orlando, WSOC-TV in Charlotte and WHIO-TV in Dayton also offer a half-hour noon newscast on weekends). In addition, WSB-TV&#x27;s weekend newscast output is larger than that of Fox owned-and-operated station WAGA-TV (channel 5), which offers a larger overall weekly (and weekday) newscast output than WSB-TV.

WSB-TV became the second station in the Atlanta market (behind WXIA-TV) and the second Cox-owned station (behind WFTV) to begin broadcasting its local newscasts in high definition. The first HD broadcast was on September 27, 2006; during its noon broadcast. With the switch came a new HD-ready set and a graphics package designed by Giant Octopus.

In mid-November 2009, reporter Tom Jones and a cameraman escaped serious injury when the telescoping radio mast of their electronic news-gathering van (holding a microwave antenna for the remote pickup unit used for outside broadcasting) contacted 115-kilovolt high-voltage powerlines while leaving the Fulton County Jail. Georgia Power staff were surprised that anyone survived, but the two were treated for minor burns and smoke inhalation at Grady Memorial Hospital and released later in the day. The massive electric spark caused an explosion, left a crater underneath the van, arced to and broke a water main, and caused a brief power outage; the vehicle was a total loss.

In August 2018, WSB-TV added two additional hours to its weekday morning newscast during &quot;Good Morning America&quot;, an expansion exclusive to its 24-hour streaming channel, &quot;WSB NOW,&quot; available on its website and apps.

In April 2020, WSB-TV changed the name of its 11 p.m. newscast to &quot;WSB Tonight&quot;. The station&#x27;s nightly newscast had been called the &quot;Channel 2 Action News Nightbeat&quot; since the early 1990s. The newscast began as a nightly update on the COVID-19 pandemic, but the name change appears to be permanent. The &quot;Nightbeat&quot; name was still used for weekend newscasts, but the station began using the new name for weekend newscasts later in the year. Unlike the &quot;Nightbeat&quot;, which was a rundown of the day&#x27;s top stories, &quot;WSB Tonight&quot; goes into detail about the biggest stories of the day.

On September 5, 2020, WSB-TV became the first station in the Atlanta market to expand its weekend morning newscast to 5 a.m.

==Technical information==

===Subchannels===
The station&#x27;s signal is multiplexed:


WSB&#x27;s digital channel went on the air on November 21, 1998. The over-the-air digital subchannel 2.2 started carrying the Retro Television Network on January 28, 2008. Prior to this, the channel was blank, or later with a small station ID in the lower corner. RTV programming was replaced with MeTV on June 1, 2011. Later on March 25, 2017, MeTV was replaced with Escape and on September 25, 2017, Escape was replaced with Bounce TV.

In 2021, a simulcast of WKTB-CD&#x27;s Telemundo subchannel moved to WSB-TV from WPXA-TV. After WGCL-TV&#x27;s owner, Gray Television, bought WKTB-CD the following year, the subchannel simulcast moved to WGCL-TV&#x27;s spectrum (remaining mapped to virtual channel 47.1).

===Analog-to-digital conversion===
WSB-TV shut down its analog signal, over VHF channel 2, on June 12, 2009, at 12:30 p.m., during a live broadcast from the station&#x27;s transmitter room on the noon newscast, as part of the federally mandated transition from analog to digital television. The switchover was led by Don McClellan, one of the station&#x27;s veteran journalists who was celebrating his 50th year at the station during the switchover. The station&#x27;s digital signal remained on its pre-transition UHF channel 39, using virtual channel 2.

During late August and into September 2009, the station removed its analog transmitter from the top of the tower, and moved its side-mounted digital antenna up from its previous lower location on the tower.

On September 6, 2019, at 9 a.m., WSB-TV shifted from physical channel 39 to 32 because of the spectrum incentive auction, which removed channels 38 to 51 from the television bandplan, repacking those stations into channels 2 to 36.

===Translators===
* WSB-TV (DRT) 17 Athens
* WSB-TV (DRT) 20 Gainesville
* WSB-TV (DRT) 17 Newnan (CP)

In March 2009, the station filed applications for two digital fill-in translators (both of which also carry the WSB-TV callsign), due to expected loss of signal strength toward the east and northeast of Atlanta as a result of the shortcomings of the ATSC digital broadcast standard. The station&#x27;s Gainesville-licensed translator broadcasts on UHF channel 20, and began operations on June 26. It is located on the same radio tower as Cox&#x27;s WSRV FM and WSBB-FM, and reaches as far into Atlanta&#x27;s north-northeastern suburbs as Lilburn. The Athens-licensed translator broadcasts on UHF channel 17, with its transmitter located southwest of Winder, and its signal also reaches as far west as Lilburn. WSB-TV requested special temporary authority to begin immediate operation of these stations, pending approval of its regular applications.

The signal coverage of both stations largely overlap with one another, and are almost entirely within the estimated coverage area of the main station; however, distributed transmission (on-channel boosters) would not be used. The translators are intended to overcome the terrain obstructions caused by Stone Mountain to the east of the WSB transmitter, and were in operation by January 2011. The Athens translator uses virtual channels 2.11 to 2.15 instead of 2.1 to 2.5, while the Gainesville translator uses 2.21 to 2.25, allowing viewers to choose whichever station whose signal is better receivable at a given time (certain ATSC tuners may have trouble with two stations using the same virtual channel, and even if not, the user would have to enter the channel number and press &quot;channel-up&quot; or &quot;channel-down&quot; buttons to access the alternates, which would not be separately labeled or identified by the tuner).

In late June 2009, the station also applied for a translator on channel 14 just southwest of Rome. That translator would cover a significant portion of northwest Georgia from the same tower as WQTU (102.3 FM) and WSRM (93.5 FM), and the same site as WGPB (97.7 FM), W212AR (90.3 FM), and W215BA (90.9 FM). The application was dismissed on August 21, 2019. In October 2010, WSB-TV applied for and later received a construction permit for another translator southwest of Atlanta in Newnan on channel 17. This translator would be co-located on the same tower as Cox-owned WALR-FM (104.1), and less than west of another tower holding WRDG (105.3 FM; which is not owned by Cox).

==Out-of-market coverage==
In northwest Georgia, WSB-TV was carried in some of the counties covered by the Chattanooga DMA: Catoosa, Dade, Murray, and Walker, but remains on line-ups in Whitfield County. WSB is carried in the far northeast Georgia counties in the Greenville–Spartanburg–Asheville DMA in Elbert, Franklin, Hart and Stephens counties.

In central Georgia, WSB-TV was available to subscribers of then-co-owned cable provider Cox Communications in the Macon area, although ABC programming was usually blacked out by another local ABC affiliate, WGXA-DT2. Given the long distance to Middle Georgia, it was likely that WSB-TV was uplinked to the AMC-10 TV satellite. WSB was also carried in Vidalia in the Savannah DMA.

In south Georgia (as far south as the Florida border), it was carried on Cox Communications, and virtually all TCI, later Mediacom systems, with the exception of the Columbus operation due to a historic lack of an ABC affiliate in the Albany media market covering southwest Georgia. Since the market&#x27;s NBC affiliate WALB began carrying ABC on its 10.2 digital subchannel in 2010, WSB has been dropped by almost all systems. Given the long distance to South Georgia, it was likely that WSB-TV was uplinked to the AMC-10 TV satellite. Charter Communications also carried WSB for its subscribers in the town of Douglas in Coffee County.

In western North Carolina it is carried in the Cherokee County town of Murphy, alongside Asheville ABC affiliate WLOS.

In northeast Alabama, it was carried on the cable systems in Gadsden (Comcast) and Anniston (New Channel, now Sparklight) in the 80s.

<doc id="745626" wikidata="Q2291325" url="?curid=745626" title="Cutout animation">
<text>Cutout animation is a form of stop-motion animation using flat characters, props and backgrounds cut from materials such as paper, card, stiff fabric or photographs. The props would be cut out and used as puppets for stop motion. The world&#x27;s earliest known animated feature films were cutout animations (made in Argentina by Quirino Cristiani), as is the world&#x27;s earliest surviving animated feature &quot;Die Abenteuer des Prinzen Achmed&quot; (1926) by Lotte Reiniger.

The technique of most cutout animation is comparable to that of shadow play, but with stop motion replacing the manual or mechanical manipulation of flat puppets. Some films, including &quot;Die Abenteuer des Prinzen Achmed&quot;, also have much of their silhouette style in common with shadow plays. Cutout animation pioneer Lotte Reiniger studied the traditions of shadow play and created several shadow play film sequences, including a tribute to François Dominique Séraphin in Jean Renoir&#x27;s film &quot;La Marseillaise&quot; (1938).

While sometimes used as a relatively simple and cheap animation technique in children&#x27;s programs (for instance in &quot;Ivor the Engine&quot;), cutout animation has also often been used as a highly artistic medium that distinguishes itself more clearly from hand-drawn animation.

Cutout animation can be made with figures that have joints made with a rivet or pin or, when simulated on a computer, an anchor. These connections act as mechanical linkage, which have the effect of a specific, fixed motion. Similar flat, jointed puppets have been in use in shadow plays for many centuries, such as in the Indonesian wayang tradition and in the &quot;ombres chinoises&quot; that were especially popular in France in the 18th and 19th century. The subgenre of silhouette animation is more closely related to these shadow shows and to the silhouette cutting art that has been popular in Europe especially in the 18th and 19th centuries. 

While many cutout animation puppets and other material is often purposely-made for films, ready-made imagery has also been heavily used in collage/photomontage styles, for instance in Terry Gilliam&#x27;s famous animations for &quot;Monty Python&#x27;s Flying Circus&quot; (1969-1975).

Lotte Reiniger, and movies like &quot;Twice Upon a Time&quot; (1983), used backlit animation, where the source of light comes from below. Animators like Terry Gilliam use light coming from above.

Cutout techniques were relatively often used in animated films until cel animation became the standard method (at least in the United States). Before 1934, Japanese animation mostly used cutout techniques rather than cel animation, because celluloid was too expensive.

Today, cutout-style animation is frequently produced using computers, with scanned images or vector graphics taking the place of physically cut materials. &quot;South Park&quot; is a notable example of the transition, since its pilot episode was made with paper cutouts before switching to computer software.

== Short films ==
* Edwin S. Porter used &quot;jumble captions&quot; in &quot;How Jones Lost His Roll&quot;, &quot;The Whole Dam Family and the Dam Dog&quot;, and &quot;Everybody Works But Father&quot; (all 1905). &quot;The Whole Dam Family&quot; also includes an animated silhouette of a dog with firecrackers attached to its tail.

<text>This is a list of Municipalities and their suburbs (neighbourhoods), townships, and rural localities in the greater metropolitan area of Melbourne, Victoria, Australia. Suburbs are defined here as localities within the legislated Urban Growth Boundary, all of which have some urban development. This line is the effective boundary of suburban Melbourne; outside it lie rural areas, and some townships of varying size.

Each suburb is followed by its postcode. Some suburbs share the same postcode.

Indented entries are recognised by the Geographic Names Board as unbounded neighbourhoods except when &quot;italicised&quot;. Those italicised usually have, or have had, Post Offices open under that name.

Information about exact suburb boundaries can be obtained from the Department of Environment Land Water and Planning.

In Australia, a suburb is a named and bounded locality of a city, with an urban nature, regardless of its location within that city. The term &quot;inner suburbs&quot; refers to the older, denser, urban areas closer to the original colonial centre of the cities and &quot;outer suburbs&quot; refers to the urban areas more remote from the centre of the metropolitan area. Sometimes the term &quot;middle ring suburb&quot; is used to refer to areas that were urbanised early in a city&#x27;s expansion after the inner suburbs had become established. This differs from British and North American usage, in which the term &quot;suburb&quot; is usually not applied to urban areas (neighbourhoods) that are close to a major city centre or inside the central city&#x27;s local government boundary.

<text>Birago Diop (11 December 1906 – 25 November 1989) to a wolof family was a Senegalese poet and storyteller whose work restored general interest in African folktales and promoted him to one of the most outstanding African francophone writers. A renowned veterinarian, diplomat and leading voice of the Négritude literary movement, Diop exemplified the &quot;African renaissance man&quot;.

== Early life ==
Son of Ismael and Sokhna Diop, Birago Diop was born on 11 December 1906 in Ouakam, a neighborhood in Dakar, Senegal. His mother raised him with his two older brothers, Massyla and Youssoupha; his father, for unknown reasons, disappeared two months before Diop was born. Diop&#x27;s childhood exposed him to many folktales, which he later used in his literary work.

In 1920, Diop earned a scholarship to attend the French-speaking school Lycée Faidherbe in Saint-Louis, which was then Senegal&#x27;s capital. During this time, he became fascinated with the poems and style of writing of Victor Hugo, Charles Baudelaire, Edgar Allan Poe and several others and began writing his own. In the late 1920s, he served as a nurse in a military hospital and later went on to study veterinary medicine at the University of Toulouse in France, graduating in 1933.

== Career ==
Although he was mostly recognized for his poems and folktales, Diop also worked as a veterinary surgeon for the French colonial government in several West African countries, spending 1937–39 in the French Sudan (now Mali), 1940 in the Ivory Coast and French Upper Volta (now Burkina Faso), and 1950 in Mauritania. Throughout his civil service career in 1934, he collected and reworked Wolof folktales, and also wrote poetry, memoirs, and a play. He also served as the first Senegalese ambassador to Tunisia from 1960 to 1965.

=== Early literary work ===

During his time in France as a veterinary student, Diop met numerous African, African-American and Caribbean students, among them Léopold Sédar Senghor, who later went on to become Senegal&#x27;s first president after its independence. Inspired by these young black intellectuals, artists and poets, Diop drafted his earliest poems in &quot;L&#x27;étudiant noir&quot; (&quot;the black student&quot;), a student review that established the idea of the Négritude movement, which protested against the assimilation theory in favour of African cultural values.

=== Inspiration ===

During his work as the head of the government&#x27;s cattle-inspection service for several regions in Senegal and Mali, he was introduced to traditional folktales, most of which he committed to memory. These served as the main inspiration for much of his literary work. Indeed, most of his poems and tales have their roots in oral African traditions. Generally recited to a group at night by a professional storyteller, called a griot, folktales were repeated in different places by the people who heard them. These ceremonies commonly consisted of songs and dances in addition to these folktales. Although the tales served as entertainment, they also had the greater purpose of teaching younger generations about the beliefs and values of their ancestors. By combining his mastery of the French language with his experience with African folktakes, Diop was able to spread the values and beliefs of his ancestors throughout the world.

=== During and after World War II ===
In the early 1940s, during World War II, Diop was forced to return to France for two years. Homesick, he began writing down adaptions of folktales as advised by his fellow Negritude writers. The following excerpt illustrating his homesickness can be found in &quot;The Humps&quot;:

:&quot;Here, far from my home in Senegal, my eyes are surrounded by closed horizons. When the greens of summer and the russets of autumn have passed, I seek the vast expanses of the Savannah, and find only bare mountains, sombre as ancient prostrate giants that the snow refuses to bury because of their misdeed...&quot; (from &quot;The Humps&quot;).

When Diop finally returned to Africa, he served as a director of zoological technical services in Ivory Coast and Upper Volta (modern day Burkina Faso). His first literary piece &quot;Les Contes d&#x27;Amadou Koumba&quot; was published in 1947. The work, totaling three volumes, managed to earn him the &quot;Grand prix littéraire&quot; award. Each volume contained a collection of short stories: animal-centred tales he directly transcribed from the griot Amadou Koumba&#x27;s accounts. These tales provided a combination of humor, fantasy and realism where people, supernatural beings, and animals interacted.

=== &quot;The broken pen&quot; ===
As soon as Senegal gained its independence, Diop was nominated as the first Senegalese ambassador in Tunisia. Upon accepting this position, he claimed to have &quot;broken his pen,&quot; suggesting that he was ready to give up writing altogether and focus on his diplomatic career. It was not until the mid-1970s, towards the end of his life, that his &quot;pen was mended.&quot; He published &quot;La plume raboutée&quot; in 1978, followed by &quot;À rebrousse-temps&quot; (1982), &quot;À rebrousse-gens&quot; (1982), and &quot;Senegal du temps de...&quot;(1986).

==Death==
Birago Diop died on 25 November 1989 in Dakar at the age of 82. He was survived by his wife of many years, Marie-Louise Pradére, and two children, Renée and Andrée. His legacy includes the titles of novelist, diplomat, a founder of the Negritude movement and veterinarian. Even now, decades after his death, his stories and poems remain, sharing African values and culture.

<text>Bombala is a town in the Monaro region of far southern New South Wales, Australia, in Snowy Monaro Regional Council. It is approximately south-southwest of the state capital, Sydney, and south of the town of Cooma. The name derives from an Aboriginal word meaning &quot;Meeting of the waters&quot;. The town lies on the banks of the Bombala River. At the , Bombala had a population of 1,892.

==History==

The Bombala area was inhabited by the Ngarigu Aboriginal people prior to the first European settlers arriving in the 1830s. Captain Ronald Campbell established a large property in 1833 that he named &#x27;Bombalo&#x27;. More European settlers arrived in the Bombala area in the 1840s during which time the small township developed. Bombala had a post office by 1849 and had a number of large commercial and public buildings by the mid 1850s.

Bombala was proposed in 1903 by King O&#x27;Malley as the site of the parliamentary seat of Australia. It was considered as a location because it was halfway between the two cities of Sydney and Melbourne. The proposal was ultimately rejected in favour of Canberra. The site proposed for the capital city was a little to the west of the town of Bombala, on the right bank of the Bombala River. The town of Bombala would have been a part of a new federal territory.

The town lies on the banks of the Bombala River and principal industries of the area include grazing and timber. Tourism is also growing in importance to the local economy. There is also a small amount of specialty producers with meat rabbits, lavender and many herbs being grown in the district. Delegate is situated 36 km west of Bombala and The Snowy River March which commenced from Delegate in 1916 went via Bombala to Goulburn.

The timber industry has slowly begun to overtake many of the historic properties surrounding Bombala, such as the more-than-150-year-old property of Aston, south-west of the township.

On 13 December 1962, Bombala post office received the last telegram to be transmitted using Morse code telegraphy in New South Wales.

The area is known for possibly the largest population of Platypus in New South Wales and is promoted as Platypus Country.

The Holy Transfiguration Monastery is a male monastic community of the Russian Orthodox Church Abroad. Founded in 1982, the monastic community presided over by Abbott Hieromonk Sergius, abides in the pristine and rugged valley of the MacLaughlin River situated between Cooma and Bombala.

The Facebook page &quot;Bombala History in Photos&quot; contains a wealth of information about the town&#x27;s history.

On January 15, 2022, a tornado touched down in the vicinity of the town.

Bombala has seen recent economic growth with the development of renewable energy projects in the region, contributing to local employment and sustainability initiatives. The annual &#x27;Bombala Show,&#x27; celebrating local agriculture, crafts, and community spirit, remains a key event in fostering regional pride and tourism. Recent census data highlights a diverse community, with increasing efforts towards cultural inclusivity and support for local Indigenous heritage projects.

Situated at 705 metres above sea level on the southeastern edge of the Monaro Tablelands, Bombala is known for its cold winters with frequent frost and regular dustings of snow. Snowfalls have even occurred in late spring and frosts can occur at the height of summer. A few kilometres to the east, the land slopes downwards to the South Coast, a flat coastal plain where summers are warmer and winter temperatures much milder. Examples are towns such as Bega and Merimbula, both about 80 kilometres east of Bombala. According to Köppen climate classification scheme, Bombala has an oceanic climate (&quot;Cfb&quot;).

Most rain in the area tends to fall as cold fronts, which at times allow for the development of severe thunderstorms in the spring and summer. Extreme temperatures have ranged from 41.5 °C (105.6 °F) to −10.0 °C (14.0 °F).

==Transport==

The railway reached Bombala in 1921 and closed in 1986. being an extension of the line from Queanbeyan to Cooma. The line was and still is known as the Goulburn to Bombala line. During the 1970s, service was provided by a small rail bus, taking 4 hours to cover the between Cooma and Bombala (compare road distance ).

The Monaro Highway (now route B23) which runs from Canberra to Cann River (Victoria) passes through Bombala.

<text>Bors (; ) is the name of two knights in Arthurian legend, an elder and a younger. The two first appear in the 13th-century Lancelot-Grail romance prose cycle. Bors the Elder is the King of Gaunnes (Gannes/Gaunes/Ganis) during the early period of King Arthur&#x27;s reign, and is the brother of King Ban of Benoic and the father of Bors the Younger and Lionel. His son Bors the Younger later becomes one of the best Knights of the Round Table and participates in the achievement of the Holy Grail.

==King Bors the Elder==
Bors the Elder is the brother of King Ban and the uncle of Hector de Maris and Lancelot. He marries Evaine, the sister of Ban&#x27;s wife Elaine. He has two sons: Bors the Younger and Lionel.

Ban and Bors become King Arthur&#x27;s early allies in his fight against eleven rebel kings in Britain, including Lot, Urien, and Caradoc, Arthur vows in return to help them against their Frankish enemy, King Claudas, who has been threatening their lands back in the continent. Arthur is late on his promise, though, and Claudas succeeds in his invasion, resulting in both kings&#x27; deaths. Ban&#x27;s son Lancelot is taken by the Lady of the Lake, but Bors&#x27;s children are raised in captivity by Claudas&#x27;s retainers.

==Sir Bors the Younger==
Sir Bors the Younger is better known than King Bors throughout Arthurian studies . Sir Bors and Lionel live for several years at Claudas&#x27;s court, but they eventually rebel against him and even slay his cruel son Dorin. Before Claudas can retaliate, the boys are rescued by a servant of the Lady of the Lake and are spirited off to be raised with their cousin Lancelot. They all grow up to be excellent knights and go to Camelot to join King Arthur&#x27;s retinue. Bors is recognisable by a distinctive scar on his forehead, and participates in most of the King&#x27;s conflicts, including the eventual battle with Claudas which liberates his father&#x27;s lands. Bors fathers Elyan the White when the beautiful daughter of King Brandegoris, Claire, tricks him into sleeping with her by way of a magic ring; he later introduces his son into the Round Table.

Sir Bors is always portrayed as one of the Round Table&#x27;s finest, but his real glory comes on the Grail Quest, where he proves himself worthy enough to witness the Grail&#x27;s mysteries alongside Galahad and Percival. Several episodes display his virtuous character; in one, a lady approaches Bors vowing to commit suicide unless he sleeps with her. He refuses to break his vow of celibacy; the lady and her maidens threaten to throw themselves off the castle battlements. As the ladies jump off, they reveal themselves to be demons set on deceiving him by playing to his sense of compassion. In another, Bors faces a dilemma where he must choose between rescuing his brother Lionel, being whipped with thorns by villains in one direction, and saving a young girl who has been abducted by a rogue knight in the other. Bors chooses to help the maiden, but prays for his brother&#x27;s safety. Lionel escapes his tormentors and tries to murder Bors, and Bors does not defend himself, refusing to raise a weapon against his kinsman. Fellow Knight of the Round Table Calogrenant and a hermit try to intervene, but Lionel slays them both when they get in the way. Before he can kill his brother, however, God strikes him down with an immobilising column of fire. Bors, Galahad, and Percival go on to achieve the Holy Grail and accompany it to Sarras, a mystical island in the Holy Land, where then Galahad and Percival pass away while there. Bors is the only one to return, and the text of the Vulgate &quot;Queste&quot; is presented as a purported written record of Bors telling the full story of the quest back in Camelot. At the end of the entire Vulgate Cycle, Bors further emerges as the only surviving main character and a successor to Arthur after the King&#x27;s death.

In Thomas Malory&#x27;s &quot;Le Morte d&#x27;Arthur&quot;, based on the French prose romance tradition, Sir Bors reluctantly agrees to fight as Queen Guinevere&#x27;s champion in a trial by combat after she is accused of poisoning a cousin of Sir Mador de la Porte. Refusing at first, as her usual champion Lancelot had left Camelot earlier because of her, Bors relents after the desperate Guinevere kneels before him. He is about to joust with Mador for her sake when Lancelot arrives to take his place incognito. Along with the rest of their family, Bors later takes Lancelot&#x27;s side after Lancelot&#x27;s affair with Guinevere is exposed and Arthur sentenced her to death. He helps to rescue the Queen from her execution at the stake and is one of Lancelot&#x27;s kinsmen who then accompany him into exile from England. Together with his brother Lionel, Bors becomes one of Lancelot&#x27;s most valorous and trusted aides in the ensuing war, during which he barely survives his horseback duel with Arthur&#x27;s second-in-command Gawain. On another occasion, Bors has an opportunity to kill the dehorsed Arthur himself, but is stopped by Lancelot. In return for his service, Lancelot crowns Lionel the King of France, while Sir Bors becomes the ruler of King Claudas&#x27; lands. While the factions are still fighting, Mordred betrays Arthur and takes the throne. Lancelot hears of this and goes to aid Arthur, but arrives too late. Lancelot searches for Guinevere; after some time without news, Lionel goes looking for him and is killed. Sir Bors sends most of the army home, and goes to look for Lancelot with a few other of their kinsmen. They eventually find him living as a priest and decide to join him.

In the Lancelot-Grail and the Post-Vulgate &quot;Mort d&#x27;Artu&quot;, Lancelot and his men return to Britain to fight Mordred&#x27;s sons, who have taken over. In the battle, Mordred&#x27;s elder son, Meleon or Melehan, mortally wounds Lionel. Bors kills Melehan with one blow, avenging his brother. Lancelot kills Mordred&#x27;s second, unnamed son.

==Modern portrayals==
*In &quot;Adventures of Sir Galahad&quot;, a serial from 1949, Sir Bors is played by &quot;overweight, mustached&quot; Charles King as a &quot;trusty off-sider&quot; for Galahad, and is &quot;permitted to play both comedy and drama
*In T. H. White&#x27;s 1958 novel &quot;The Once and Future King&quot;, Bors is described as a &quot;misogynist&quot; and an &quot;almost-virgin&quot;, and generally something of a curmudgeon.
*In 1975&#x27;s &quot;Monty Python and the Holy Grail&quot;, Sir Bors (played by Terry Gilliam) is the first Knight of the Round Table to succumb to the Killer Rabbit of Caerbannog. Bors appears in the stage musical adaptation of the film, entitled &quot;Spamalot&quot;.
*In 2004&#x27;s &quot;King Arthur&quot;, British actor Ray Winstone plays a different interpretation of Bors. He is one of Arthur&#x27;s Roman-Sarmatian soldiers, and is brash, bold and violent in a departure from the saintly earlier figure. He is brother to Dagonet, has a native lover Vanora, and more than ten illegitimate children.

<text>Broken Lizard is an American comedy troupe that comprises Jay Chandrasekhar, Kevin Heffernan, Steve Lemme, Paul Soter, and Erik Stolhanske. They collaborate on the screen-writing, acting and productions of their films, with Chandrasekhar and Heffernan being the primary directors; the team however does not have any single leader and they work collaboratively when choosing material and writing projects.

==History==
The group formed at Colgate University in 1989 when Jay Chandrasekhar was asked by a friend and fellow student, Ira Liss, to put together a comedy show. Chandrasekhar agreed and assembled a sketch comedy troupe which included Kevin Heffernan, Steve Lemme, Paul Soter, and Erik Stolhanske, all members of the Beta Theta Pi fraternity. The team performed a combination of live stage sketches and short videos under the name &quot;Charred Goosebeak&quot;. Charred Goosebeak continues to exist at Colgate to this day.

After graduation, the members reunited in New York City and spent the next few years performing at various clubs, mostly Greenwich Village mainstay The Duplex, under the name &quot;Broken Lizard&quot;. The group offered various explanations of the origin of this moniker over the years, ranging from a euphemism for loss of virility to a tribute to Chandrasekhar&#x27;s pet allergies. Most recently, the members admitted that Chandrasekhar simply made up the name &quot;off the top of his head&quot; when he had their first flyer printed. Another possible name that was discarded was &quot;Chocolate Speedo&quot;.

Broken Lizard spent the next few years performing at clubs and college campuses. Its membership dwindled to the five current performers. By the mid-1990s, the group&#x27;s interests shifted away from live material as they became more interested in filmed content. They wrote and acted in &quot;Dante&#x27;s Levels of Hell&quot;, a series of interstitial shorts for Comedy Central&#x27;s &quot;Is This On?&quot; feature.

At this time, the Broken Lizard members also made their first foray into long-form film, shooting the 30-minute 16 mm project, &quot;The Tinfoil Monkey Agenda&quot;, an absurdist media spoof that earned them a trip to the Ft. Lauderdale Film Festival, and cemented in the group&#x27;s minds that they should be creating full-length feature films.

The group put together the script for their next feature, and first wide-release movie &quot;Super Troopers&quot;. The film, which portrays rural highway patrolmen as regular men desperate to make their jobs entertaining, was shot in 2000, and was also invited to Sundance, where raucous screenings earned the film a distribution deal from Fox Searchlight Pictures, a unit of 20th Century Fox. The movie was released in February 2002 and only enjoyed moderate theatrical success, but it eventually developed a cult following.

Fox Searchlight sponsored and distributed the group&#x27;s next feature, 2004&#x27;s &quot;Club Dread&quot;, a parody of slasher films that takes place at an idyllic tropical resort.

After Chandrasekhar directed &quot;The Dukes of Hazzard&quot; for Warner Bros., Broken Lizard was offered a deal with the studio. This relationship resulted in Broken Lizard&#x27;s third feature, 2006&#x27;s &quot;Beerfest&quot;, about two brothers who discover an underground Oktoberfest beer-drinking Olympics and assemble a team to compete.

In late May 2010, Broken Lizard had completed their fourth feature, &quot;The Slammin&#x27; Salmon&quot;, about a group of waiters who are terrorized over the course of a busy night by their unstable boss (Michael Clarke Duncan). Heffernan directed &quot;The Slammin&#x27; Salmon&quot;.

In 2012, both Chandrasekhar and Heffernan confirmed that a sequel to &quot;Super Troopers&quot; was in the works, and that the script had been finished. In 2015, Broken Lizard had launched a crowdfunding campaign to fund filming of &quot;Super Troopers 2&quot;. On a Funemployment Radio episode May 26, 2016, Jay Chandrasekhar confirmed that a small test segment of the film has been shot and full production would start in August 2016. On August 2, 2017, Broken Lizard announced, via their website, that they had finished post-production on the movie. &quot;Super Troopers 2&quot; was released on April 20, 2018.

In 2023, Broken Lizard released Quasi and announced that &quot;Super Troopers 3&quot; would be next.

==Other projects==

Receiving financial support from 20th Century Fox enabled Chandrasekhar to establish a career as a television director. He directed episodes of the Fox television shows &quot;Undeclared,&quot; &quot;Andy Richter Controls the Universe,&quot; &quot;Arrested Development,&quot; &quot;Oliver Beene,&quot; and &quot;Cracking Up.&quot; In addition, he directed three episodes of &quot;Psych,&quot; including the episode &quot;Bollywood Homicide,&quot; in which he also guest starred. Chandrasekhar directed the 2005 film &quot;The Dukes of Hazzard,&quot; in which each of the members of Broken Lizard also appeared. He likewise appeared in &quot;Jackass 2&quot; as the taxi driver in the last main sketch of the movie, performing a &quot;prank on a prank.&quot;

Heffernan co-wrote the screenplay to the 2005 film &quot;On the One&quot; and also acted in the films &quot;Sky High&quot; and &quot;Strange Wilderness.&quot;

Lemme was a co-producer of the movies &quot;The Decade&quot; and &quot;Boxes,&quot; and also appeared in &quot;Open Water&quot; and &quot;Big Helium Dog.&quot;

Soter wrote and directed the film noir comedy film &quot;Watching the Detectives,&quot; which starred Cillian Murphy and Lucy Liu. Soter, Lemme, and Stolhanske also appeared in the film. He also directed the horror film &quot;Dark Circles&quot;.

Stolhanske acted in a number of television shows and films, including &quot;Curb Your Enthusiasm,&quot; &quot;Six Feet Under,&quot; &quot;Undeclared,&quot; and &quot;The Onion Movie.&quot; 
Stolhanske was also in the Plyometrics DVD that was part of the P90X program that fitness expert Tony Horton created.

Heffernan and Lemme co-created &quot;Tacoma FD&quot; for TruTV, which ran from 2019 to 2023.

<doc id="745648" wikidata="Q209974" url="?curid=745648" title="Béchamel sauce">
<text>Béchamel sauce (, ) is one of the mother sauces of French cuisine, made from a white roux (butter and flour) and milk, seasoned with ground nutmeg.

==Origin==

The first recipe of a sauce similar to béchamel is in the book by François Pierre de La Varenne in 1651, made with a roux, as in modern recipes. The name of the sauce was given in honour of Louis de Béchameil, a financier who held the honorary post of chief steward to King Louis XIV of France in the 17th century.

The first named béchamel sauce appears in &quot;The Modern Cook,&quot; written by Vincent La Chapelle and published in 1733, in which the following recipe for &quot;Turbots (a la Bechameille)&quot; appears:

==Adaptations==
There are many legends regarding the origin of béchamel sauce. For example, it is widely repeated in Italy that the sauce has been created in Tuscany under the name &quot;salsa colla&quot; and brought to France with Catherine de Medici, but this is an invented story, and archival research has shown that &quot;in the list of service people who had dealt with Catherine de Medici, since her arrival in France and until her death, there were absolutely no Italian chefs.&quot; Both the béchamel recipe and its name have been adopted, even adapted, in many languages and culinary traditions.

Béchamel, although not with this name, was already described in Italian texts of the Renaissance: in particular in the &quot;Book of cuisine of the 14th century&quot; by Anonimo Toscano, the recipe for a dish called &quot;biancomangiare&quot; is cited. The 14th century recipe required sifting the (rice) flour, then diluting it with goat&#x27;s, sheep&#x27;s or almond milk and finally boiling it in a pan. To this sauce was then added a finely chopped chicken breast, white lard, sugar and almonds.

Béchamel is referred to as:
* &quot;besciamella&quot; or &quot;balsamella&quot; in Italy, 
*&quot;μπεσαμέλ&quot; (spelled &quot;mpesamél&quot;, pronounced &quot;besamél&quot;) in Greece, 
*&quot;بشمل &quot;(&quot;bashamel&quot;) in Egypt, 
*&quot;:he:רוטב בשאמל&quot; in Israel,
*&quot;бешамель&quot; (&quot;biešamieĺ&quot;) in Russia,
*&quot;beszamel&quot; in Poland, and
* &quot;white sauce&quot; in the U.S.

These adaptations have also caused various erroneous claims for the recipe&#x27;s origin.

==Variants==
Béchamel can be used as the base for many other sauces, such as Mornay, which is béchamel with cheese. In Greek cuisine, béchamel (σάλσα μπεσαμέλ) is often enriched with egg.

== Uses ==
Béchamel is used in dishes such as the Italian lasagne al forno and &quot;canelons&quot; (Catalan; Castilian &quot;canelones&quot;), a Catalan version of Italian cannelloni. It was introduced to Greek cuisine by the chef Nikolaos Tselementes in the 1930s,
notably in moussaka and pastitsio. The Karelian-Finnish &quot;sipatti&quot; is smoked, cubed and sauteed pork belly in white sauce base, and &quot;kananmunakastike&quot; is boiled and sliced eggs in a white sauce base. These are typically eaten as main dishes with potatoes.

<text>The Cambridge–MIT Institute, or CMI, was a partnership between the University of Cambridge in Cambridge, England, and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in Cambridge, Massachusetts. In 2008, CMI issued a final report describing its activities from late 2000 to 2006, stating that it had &quot;evolved into the CMI Partnership Programme.&quot; The CMI website hosted by the University of Cambridge later noted that, &quot;CMI activities are now fully embedded within the two institutions.&quot;

It was proposed by former British Chancellor of the Exchequer Gordon Brown in the summer of 1998, who wanted to bring the entrepreneurial spirit of MIT to British universities. Cambridge University was chosen as MIT&#x27;s partner because of its strong record in science/engineering and the abundance of high-technology firms located in the Cambridge area known as Silicon Fen.

Funded both by government and industry partners, including BP and British Telecom, CMI experimented with new ways of bringing universities, industries, and government together to ensure that research findings are quickly exploited for the benefit of society and the economy of the United Kingdom. This included funding new ideas in research and education, and the study and assessment of knowledge exchange experiments.

Aiming ultimately to enhance competitiveness, productivity and entrepreneurship in the UK, CMI also worked with a network of partners across the UK, holding a range of events to share lessons learnt, to develop effective models for national uptake, and to facilitate the debate on issues ranging from the role of universities in stimulating innovation, to ways of teaching the new skills required by emerging technologies.

One of the major initiatives arising from the collaboration of MIT and Cambridge was the development of silent aircraft technologies.

<text>A celebrity chef is a kitchen chef who has become a celebrity. Today, chefs often become celebrities by presenting cookery advice and demonstrations, usually through the media of television and radio, or in printed publications. While television is ultimately the primary way for a chef to become a celebrity, some have achieved this through success in the kitchen, cookbook publications, and achieving awards such as Michelin stars, while others are home cooks who won competitions. In South Korea, a celebrity chef is referred as a &quot;cheftainer&quot;.

Celebrity chefs can also influence cuisines across countries, with foreign cuisines being introduced in their natural forms for the first time due to the work of the chef to inform their viewers. Sales of certain foodstuffs can also be enhanced, such as when Delia Smith caused the sale of white eggs across the United Kingdom to increase by 10% in what has since been termed the &quot;Delia effect&quot;. Endorsements are also to be expected from a celebrity chef, such as Ken Hom&#x27;s range of bestselling woks in Europe, but can also lead to criticism over which endorsements are chosen such as when Marco Pierre White teamed up with Bernard Matthews Farms, or when Darren Simpson advised and endorsed fast-food restaurant KFC.

==History==
Cooks rising to prominence date at least as far back as the Roman Empire. The Roman historian Livy dated the advent of Rome&#x27;s decline with the cook&#x27;s &quot;rise above his station&quot;. &quot;And it was then,&quot; he wrote, &quot;that the cook, who had formerly the status of the lowest kind of slave, first acquired prestige, and what had once been servitude came to be thought of as an art.&quot; He was not alone in this belief: Roman sumptuary laws were passed to curb what was seen as a culture of excess.

The earliest chef to be credited with being a celebrity was the 16th century Italian, Bartolomeo Scappi. He was the personal chef to Pope Pius V, and is credited with writing the first cookbook, &quot;Opera Dell&#x27;arte del Cucinare&quot; in 1577.

The 19th-century French chef Marie-Antoine Carême has also since been referred to as a celebrity of his era, due to the complexity of his recipes.

The first chef to achieve widespread fame and celebrity status was Alexis Soyer. Born in France, Soyer became the most celebrated cook in early Victorian England. In 1837, he became &quot;chef de cuisine&quot; at the Reform Club in London, where he designed the kitchens with Charles Barry. His exceptional cooking skills were combined with an excellent eye to marketing and self-publicity to ensure that he molded the public&#x27;s perception of him. His image was even successfully used as a trademark to market a range of bottled sauces produced by Crosse &amp; Blackwell.

Soyer also invented many popular new recipes and foods; he produced and marketed a popular drink made of a variety of fruits mixed with carbonated water, which he called Soyer&#x27;s Nectar Soda Water. His special dish at the club, Soyer&#x27;s Lamb Cutlets Reform, is still on the menu today. At the Reform Club, he instituted many innovations, including cooking with gas, refrigerators cooled by cold water, and ovens with adjustable temperatures. His kitchens were so famous that they were opened for conducted tours. When Queen Victoria was crowned on 28 June 1838, he prepared a breakfast for 2,000 people at the club.

He was also well known for his philanthropy. During the Great Irish Famine in April 1847, he implemented a network of soup kitchens to feed the poor. His &quot;famine soup&quot; was served to thousands of the poor for free. Soyer wrote a number of bestselling books about cooking, one of them even selling over a quarter of a million copies. His 1854 book &quot;A Shilling Cookery for the People&quot; was a recipe book for ordinary people who could not afford elaborate kitchen utensils or large amounts of exotic ingredients. Other works included &quot;The Gastronomic Regenerator &quot; (1846), &quot;The modern Housewife or, Ménagère&quot; and &quot;Soyer&#x27;s Culinary Campaign&quot; (1857).

===Television celebrity chefs===
The earliest television celebrity chef in Britain was Philip Harben.
The earliest television celebrity female chef in the UK was Fanny Cradock. She appeared on British television for over two decades, from the 1950s through the 1970s. She originally became popular following the publication of her first cookbook in 1949, &quot;The Practical Cook&quot;, and after gaining a cult following with cookery demonstrations in theatres around the country. Her television career came to an end when she appeared as a judge on reality television show &quot;The Big Time&quot; in 1976. She appeared to pretend to retch as contestant Gwen Troake described her menu for former Prime Minister Edward Heath. Presenter Esther Rantzen later described the incident as like &quot;Cruella de Vil meets Bambi&quot;.

Described as America&#x27;s first celebrity chef, Julia Child first appeared on American television in 1963 on the Boston-based WGBH-TV. She soon starred in her own show, &quot;The French Chef&quot;, which was followed by other shows. At the time of her death, she was credited by the media as having &quot;demystified the art of cuisine for the home cook and inspired many of today&#x27;s celebrity chefs&quot;. Such was her impact on American cuisine, her kitchen has been preserved on display at the Smithsonian Museum of American History.

In recent years, gaining a Michelin star has increased chefs&#x27; profiles sufficiently for them to be featured on television and become a household name. Marco Pierre White became the youngest chef in the world to achieve three Michelin stars, which went on to make him a household name and have one of his cookbooks, &quot;White Heat&quot;, described in 2005 as &quot;possibly the most influential recipe book of the last 20 years&quot; by food critic Jay Rayner. More typical of Michelin-starred restaurants in recent years, the success of Gordon Ramsay led to the commissioning of a five-part television series, &quot;Boiling Point&quot;, by the UK&#x27;s Channel 4, which followed the chef as he opened his first solo restaurant, Restaurant Gordon Ramsay. While Joël Robuchon, Alain Ducasse, and Gordon Ramsay all run restaurant empires that each hold more than 10 Michelin stars, Ramsay is arguably the more famous chef due to his number of television shows broadcast internationally in the UK, the United States, and around the world.

Dedicated food-related television channels have also become a medium for chefs to become household names, for example in the United States, the Food Network features shows from celebrity chefs such as Paula Deen and Bobby Flay. While in the UK, the Good Food Channel has shows with chefs such as Rick Stein and Jamie Oliver. Certain chefs, such as Nigella Lawson, have had shows featuring on channels in more than one country.

=== MasterClass and YouTube Celebrity Chefs ===
MasterClass has a number of celebrity chefs including Thomas Keller, Massimo Bottura, Alice Waters, Roy Choi, and Gordon Ramsay. YouTube has brought other celebrity chefs such as Chef Jean-Pierre and Jamie Oliver to a wider audience.

==Influences==
Celebrity chefs have changed the styles of food that the general public consume. For example, despite the fact that Asian cuisine had been available in the UK since before the Victorian era, only due to the influence of chefs such as Ken Hom and Madhur Jaffrey in the early 1980s did the public become aware that these anglicised meals were not the authentic article. Tying into his first television series in 1984, the book &quot;Ken Hom&#x27;s Chinese Cookery&quot; sold 1.2 million copies in the UK alone. Chef Jamie Oliver ran a campaign in the UK in his television show &quot;Jamie&#x27;s School Dinners &quot;to introduce supposedly better eating habits in school dinners for schoolchildren. The campaign caused a change in food-standard requirements across the United Kingdom.

===Endorsements===
Endorsements by celebrity chefs have led to increased demands for certain food products. Both Jamie Oliver and Nigella Lawson caused a surge in sales of goose fat after including it in recipes, and Ken Hom&#x27;s first television series caused a surge in sales of Peking ducks. Endorsements by Delia Smith became so well known that the &quot;Delia effect&quot; was added to the British dictionary in 2001.

Product range tie-ins on housewares have also becoming a staple part of a celebrity chef&#x27;s income. More than 4.7 million of Ken Hom-endorsed wok range have been sold in Europe. The writing of cookbooks has also been a regular product of the celebrity chefs, from both those who have gained Michelin stars, and homestyle cooks who have had books produced as a tie-in for television shows.

Certain endorsements by celebrity chefs have led to high levels of criticism from the food industry and the public. In 2011, Australian chef Darren Simpson created a range of burgers for fast-food restaurant Kentucky Fried Chicken, leading to comments being posted on Twitter such as &quot;Darren Simpson you complete and utter sell-out. KFC? Seriously?&quot;. Australian television chef Colin Fassnidge said that the move by Simpson resulted in him becoming a laughing stock, and that while celebrity chefs can make a fortune from such deals, they also risk their credibility. In the UK, Marco Pierre White drew criticism after teaming up with Bernard Matthews Farms in March 2010 to create a range of ready meals that were dropped after a year of production.

==Healthiness of recipes==
A 2012 paper published in the &quot;BMJ&quot; found that recipes in top-selling books by television chefs (Nigella Lawson, Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall, Jamie Oliver, and Lorraine Pascale) were less healthy than supermarket ready meals. Neither ready meals nor the chefs&#x27; recipes met national or international recommendations for a balanced diet.

<doc id="745657" wikidata="Q1063889" url="?curid=745657" title="Charles Caccia">
<text>Charles L. Caccia, (April 28, 1930 – May 3, 2008) was a Canadian politician. Caccia was a Liberal member of the House of Commons of Canada. He represented the Toronto riding of Davenport between 1968 and 2004.

==Background==
Caccia was born in 1930 in Milan, Italy. He became a professor of forestry at the University of Toronto, and was a co-founder of COSTI in Toronto. Caccia&#x27;s first wife, Mildred, was a candidate for the Ontario Liberal Party in a provincial election in the 1970s. They had two children, Nicolette and John, and were divorced. Caccia was survived by second wife Iva.

==Politics==
Caccia was best known for his strong pro-environment views on the left of the Liberal party. He served at various times during the ministries of Pierre Trudeau and John Turner as Minister of Labour, Minister of the Environment, Parliamentary Secretary to the Solicitor General of Canada, Parliamentary Secretary to the President of the Treasury Board, and Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Manpower and Immigration. He most recently was the Chair of the Standing Committee on Environment and Sustainable Development, and of the subcommittee on Agenda and Procedure of the Standing Committee on Environment and Sustainable Development. Caccia was one of only three cabinet members to endorse Jean Chrétien in the 1984 Liberal Party of Canada leadership election, along with David Collenette and Roméo LeBlanc. He was the Liberals&#x27; Environment critic from 1984 to 1989, and spent most of the rest of his career on the backbench.

One of the most left-leaning Liberal Members of Parliament (MPs) of the time, he was known for his stances on environmental issues and his staunch opposition to the 2003 invasion of Iraq, he was one of the few Liberal MPs to back Sheila Copps in the Liberal Party&#x27;s 2003 leadership election. His left-leaning politics and support of Copps ended his political career when the more right-leaning Paul Martin became Liberal leader and prime minister in 2004. Martin backed former Toronto city councillor Mario Silva for the Liberal Party nomination in Davenport. With Martin&#x27;s support, Silva signed up enough new members until it was obvious he would defeat Caccia for the nomination. Caccia pulled out of the race, and after some talk, chose to retire from politics rather than run as an independent or Green in the 2004 election.

In 1964, he was labelled as a communist by East York Mayor True Davidson for suggesting that Toronto city run day cares accept children from mothers in two parent working families. At the time, they only accepted children from single working mothers.

<text>Humayun Abdulali (19 May 1914, Kobe, Japan - 3 June 2001, Mumbai, India) was an Indian ornithologist and biologist who was also a cousin of the &quot;birdman of India&quot;, Salim Ali. Like other naturalists of his period, he took an initial interest in &quot;shikar&quot; (hunting). Unlike Sálim Ali, his main contributions were less field-oriented and based more on bird collections, particularly those at the Bombay Natural History Society where he worked for most of his life.

==Early years and education==
Humayun Abdulali was born to a Sulaymani Bohra Ismaili family in Kobe in 1914. His parents were Lulu and Najmuddin Faizalhussain Abdulali, a businessman who imported raw cotton and safety matches from India. In his unfinished autobiography (posthumously published in the book &quot;Humayan Abdulali - Naturalist Portrait and Tribute&quot;), he wrote that his interest in natural history may have been cultivated at an early age at the English Mission School in Kobe, while reading American stories on cowboys and the wild west. The Abdulali family relocated to Mumbai (then Bombay), India in 1924.

Humayun went to primary school at St Xavier&#x27;s High School and later graduated from St. Xavier&#x27;s College, Mumbai in 1936 with a Bachelor of Arts (Honours) degree while also receiving the Narayan Vasudev Prize. It was while studying zoology at St Xavier&#x27;s College in 1932 that he started collecting birds.

After graduating he worked for a year in his father&#x27;s business (Faiz and Co.) of exporting scrap iron to Japan. He bought a secondhand 10/12 HP (horsepower) Harley Davidson motorcycle to travel extensively in and around Bombay. He also bought an old Lancia Tourer, which he used for several months. In 1938, he and his friend Boman Patuck met with a motorcycle accident that left them seriously injured. A policeman who had hitched a ride with them died in the accident. Humayun was charged with rash and negligent driving and was subsequently acquitted by a court in Bombay. He replaced the motorbike with a Morris Minor in 1939, which he used until his death.

He went on numerous excursions to observe fauna as well as for hunts, accompanied by his naturalist friends and his cousin Salim Ali. These travels took him to Talegaon, Nashik, North Kanara, Travancore, Bharatpur, Assam (Manas and Kaziranga), Aurangabad, Western Ghats and the Kanheri Caves. In his unfinished autobiography, he describes his adventures and exploits in and around Bombay - shooting ducks, partridges, and tigers, as well as spotting various birds, animals, reptiles, and amphibians.

==Career==
Sálim Ali introduced Humayun to the Bombay Natural History Society (BNHS). He became a member of the Society in 1931, the year in which his first note titled &quot;Eleven Koel eggs in a Crow&#x27;s nest&quot; was published in the Journal of the Bombay Natural History Society (JBNHS). His second note, published in the journal in 1934, earned him further acclaim. He published 356 notes in his lifetime and these covered birds, snakes, frogs and other fauna. He authored 270 scientific papers and 50 book reviews. A six-part series based on the specimens he collected when at St Xavier&#x27;s college and of the birds he had spotted in and around Bombay, co-authored by Salim Ali, and titled &quot;The Birds of Bombay and Salsette&quot;, was published between 1936 and 1938 in the Journal of the Bombay Natural History Society. Subsequently, the two continued to document their observations of the birds spotted in these areas in the journal.

Charles McCann, the assistant curator at the BNHS, helped Humayun in identifying the specimens he had collected during his excursions. The two became good friends. After McCann&#x27;s death, Humayun donated money towards the Charles McCann Vertebrate Fieldwork Fund instituted by the BNHS to promote field research.

Humayun was elected to the Executive Committee of the BNHS in 1942. He was elected Joint Honorary Secretary of the BNHS along with Sálim Ali in 1949. During his tenure as the Honorary Secretary at BNHS (1949–62), three important milestones were achieved:
* He was instrumental in drafting the Bombay Wild Animals and Wild Birds Protection Act of 1951. The law aimed to curb the rampant poaching and subsequent destruction of wildlife that started after India gained independence in 1947.
* He obtained permission from the Prince of Wales Museum to house the BNHS in its premises. He negotiated a grant of 3.5 lakh (350,000) rupees from the Central Government for the BNHS building.
* He catalogued the specimens in the collection of the BNHS.

He was the editor of the &quot;Journal of the Bombay Natural History Society&quot; from 1960 to 1962, along with Sálim Ali and H. Santapau. After his stint as the honorary secretary of the BNHS ended in 1962, he continued to serve on the executive committee. From 1987 to 1992, he served as the vice president of the committee. In 1993, the BNHS conferred upon him the title of emeritus naturalist in recognition of his work at the BNHS.

===Specimen collections===
Humayun Abdulali collected specimens from in and around Bombay as well as from as far as the Andaman and Nicobar islands and added to the BNHS collection, which is now estimated to have around 50,000 specimens of reptiles, mammals, amphibians, and insects, and approximately 29,000 specimens of birds. He contributed about 3,000 bird specimens to the collection, now at the Bird Room of the BNHS. He played a crucial role in obtaining a grant for the housing and maintenance of the collection from the government of Maharashtra.

After Humayun&#x27;s tenure as the Honorary Secretary ended in 1962, he focused on re-examining and re-structuring the collection at BNHS. His studies resulted in the identification of 18 new sub-species. The catalogue, titled &quot;Catalogue of the Birds in the Collection of the Bombay Natural History Society&quot;, was published in the Journal of the BNHS between 1968 and 1996. After his death, the Bird Room at the BNHS was named after him.

Humayun contributed greatly to the production of the &quot;Handbook&quot; of Salim Ali and Dillon Ripley.

===Work in the Andaman and Nicobar Islands===

From 1963 to 1977, he made eight trips to the Andaman and Nicobar Islands, accompanied by various people on different trips—colleagues from BNHS, researchers, assistants from the Zoological Survey of India, his son Akbar, etc. The aim of the expeditions to the archipelago of around 225 islands was to gather specimens of unknown subspecies, or of subspecies that were till then taxonomically documented as merely &quot;Andamans&quot; or &quot;Nicobars&quot; or &quot;Andamans and Nicobars&quot;. Several specimens were obtained during these trips and added to the collection of BNHS: The &quot;Otus alius&quot; (Nicobar scops owl), the Nicobar pigeon, the Narcondam hornbill, other birds, fruit bats, flying foxes, frogs, toads, lizards, snakes, etc. His observations were published in the Journal of the BNHS, which brought to light the nature of fauna in the islands.

Humayun drew attention to the need to conserve the forests and biodiversity at the Andaman and Nicobar islands, particularly Barren Island, Narcondam Island and the Battye Malve Island. The Indian Navy ceased shooting practice at the Battye Malve, a nesting place of the Nicobar Pigeon, after Humayun made a representation to the navy during one of the trips. He also highlighted the flaws and pitfalls in the Wildlife (Protection) Act, 1972. These lacunae led to difficulties in obtaining permissions for gathering specimens at the islands for research. On the other hand, illegal killing and poaching of the animals protected by the Act continued to happen at the Andaman and Nicobar archipelago and elsewhere in the country.

===Taxa described by Humayun Abdulali===
Seventeen bird subspecies were described by Abdulali, but some of these may no longer be considered valid. These include:

===Wildlife protection and conservation===

====Bombay Wild Birds and Wild Animals Act, 1951====
Before India achieved independence in 1947, about 750 princely states in the country protected and preserved the local wildlife. With independence, poaching became rampant and new legislation to protect wildlife became a pressing necessity. A bill for the required law was drafted by Humayun Abdulali, who was then the Honorary Secretary of the BNHS, and J.A. Singh, a retired Chief Conservator of Forests. The Government of Bombay passed the Bombay Wild Birds and Wild Animals Act, which included areas designated as forests and those outside them, in 1951. It came into force in Bombay on 1 May 1953. A Special Wildlife Protection Officer and several Honorary Game Wardens, equipped with police powers, were appointed under the new law to patrol forest areas. After a tamarind tree that housed egrets was chopped down within the premises of the BSES in Mumbai, Humayun, as the Honorary Warden, collected a fine from the Managing Director of BSES.

For a few years after the implementation of the act, Humayun was an Honorary Game Warden with his authority spanning over the state of Maharashtra. Then his jurisdiction was reduced to Greater Bombay and Thane until his warden status was cancelled. As the game warden, he nabbed poachers, helped police officers file First Information Reports, and helped curb the sale of jackal and fox tails as decorative items.

The Act was later modified to draft the Wildlife Protection Act, 1972.

====Borivali National Park====
During his tenure as the Honorary Secretary of the BNHS, Humayun proposed that the forest areas located north of Aarey Milk Colony in Bombay up to the Vasai Creek be designated as a national park. These areas would include the wilderness around Tulsi lake and Vihar lake, and the Kanheri Caves. The 100-square-kilometre area was notified as the Borivali National Park by the government of India in the 1960s, and was renamed as the Sanjay Gandhi National Park in 1981. In 1975, the Government of Maharashtra started work on the construction of a highway that ran through the park, despite protests from environmental organisations and groups. Along with a few other members of BNHS, Humayun filed a Public Interest Litigation (PIL) petition in the Bombay High Court for halting the construction of the highway. The court ordered a stay on the construction of the road and work on the road was never restarted subsequently.

====Ban on the export of frogs&#x27; legs====
His work on frogs in agricultural ecosystems helped in the imposition of a ban by the Indian government on the export of frogs&#x27; legs.

In the early 1960s, Humayun learnt about the commercial export of the legs of the bullfrog (&quot;Rana tigrina&quot;) from India to be used as a delicacy. He was of the opinion that the frog, which ate insects and acted as a pest control, should not be eaten in the interest of preserving ecological balance and avoiding the use of chemical pesticides such as DDT. Humayun wrote to the editor of the &quot;Science Reporter&quot;, published by the Government of India, and to government bodies, trying to draw attention to the dwindling number of bullfrogs owing to export. In 1969, he referred the matter to the erstwhile Chief Minister of Maharashtra, Vasantrao Naik, who asked him to formally present the matter so that it could be examined. However, these efforts drew a blank.

A few years later he discussed the export of frogs&#x27; legs, and its probable impact on agriculture in Konkan and elsewhere, with Dr D.N. Srivastava, the then Assistant Director General of the Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR). Srivastava asked him to undertake a research study and offered to pay for his scientific assistants. Humayun undertook a three-year research project titled &#x27;Determination of Ecological Disturbances in Agricultural and Adjoining Lands Caused by the Removal of &quot;Rana tigrina&quot; and &quot;Rana hexadactyla&quot; for Export&#x27; as the Principal Investigator. The research project was undertaken through the BNHS in the rice fields of Thane and Colaba and a frog-processing factory at Karjat.

An examination of the contents obtained from the stomachs of frogs revealed that ninety percent of their food consisted of crabs, insects, and the larvae of insects, all of which harmed the rice crop. Based on the study, a paper &#x27;On the Export of Frogs&#x27; Legs from India&#x27; was published in the Journal of the BNHS. In 1979, a Parliamentary Committee examined a report based on the study and asked Dr Sálim Ali, then a Member of the Rajya Sabha, if a ban on the export of frogs&#x27; legs was feasible. Dr Sálim Ali supported the ban, which was ultimately recommended by the committee. All frogs of the genus &quot;Rana&quot; are now protected under Schedule IV of the Wildlife Protection Act 1972.

Humayun was also concerned about the cruelty practiced in the killing of these frogs.

The ban had its detractors, who believed that frogs and toads did not impact the population of insects and pests significantly. Even after the ban was imposed, Humayun was vigilant about the ban being lifted temporarily or permanently.

====Conservation of grey junglefowl====
Another species Humayun helped conserve in Bombay was the grey junglefowl. Its feathers were being sent mostly to the United States by post in the late 1940s. On being informed about a consignment of grey junglefowl feathers being dispatched from Calcutta, he contacted the Audubon Society in the US. The receivers of the parcel were prosecuted on three counts and fined $10,000 on each. This considerably reduced the dispatch of the feathers from India.

===Differences with Sálim Ali===
The scientific opinions of Sálim Ali and Humayun Abdulali would frequently differ and they would also often disagree with each other matters such as the style of functioning of the Society. The former was interested in ecology and field ornithology, the latter on taxonomy and the collection. The two came to loggerheads over the topic of the allotment of funds to the Society&#x27;s bird-ringing project. Sálim Ali, with the support of the Executive Committee, wanted the Reference Collection staff to work on the bird-ringing project. They also disagreed on what groups they should focus on; Ali favoured ringing passerines while Abdulali suggested that he work on waders. Humayun was of the view that the grant given by the state government for the collection should not be diverted to other projects. The disagreement led to Humayun not being nominated to the executive committee in the 1971 elections of the Societysss

<text>Chesham tube station is a London Underground station in the market town of Chesham in Buckinghamshire, England. It was opened on 8 July 1889 by the Metropolitan Railway (MR). It is the terminus station of the Chesham branch of the Metropolitan line, which runs from Chalfont &amp; Latimer. The station, a Grade II listed building, is in London fare Zone 9 (previously zone D).

Chesham station is northwest of Charing Cross, making it the furthest London Underground station from central London. It is both the northernmost and westernmost station in the system. The distance between Chesham and Chalfont &amp; Latimer is the longest between adjacent stations on the network, at .

==History==
The station was opened on 8 July 1889 by the Metropolitan Railway as the company&#x27;s temporary northern terminus when the railway was extended from . The line had been intended to extend to Tring railway station with connections to the London and North Western Railway″s West Coast Main Line. However, before work was begun, the MR chose an alternative route across the Chilterns via Aylesbury. The line to Chesham was retained as a branch from the new route and construction began in late 1887. Although the MR continued to buy land between Chesham and Tring for some years after the station&#x27;s opening, the route was never extended further. The station building complex has remained almost unchanged.

The station originally had a goods yard, which closed in July 1966. The goods yard site by 1994 was the car park for the station and a Waitrose supermarket. When the line was electrified a bay platform was added, but proved unnecessary and closed in November 1970.
On 16 and 17 August 2014 the branch line celebrated its 125th anniversary of operating. It was celebrated using London Underground&#x27;s first steam locomotive, Metropolitan 1. It ran from Rickmansworth to Chesham (with the first and last service of each day starting or ending at to allow stabling of the set at Ruislip), meaning that the line from Chalfont and Latimer to Chesham had to be closed for a period of time to allow for the special service.

==Grade II listed building==
The station is a Grade II listed building. The reasons for listing the station at this level were:
* Architectural interest: the most complete surviving example of a late-C19 rural Metropolitan station
* Historic interest: a vivid reminder of the Metropolitan Railway&#x27;s early expansion into London&#x27;s rural hinterland
* Ensemble value: the station building, signal box and water tower form an unusually coherent and intact group.

==Services==

Since 12 December 2010, Chesham has had an 8-car train every 30 minutes direct to Aldgate. In the morning and evening peak, trains run non-stop between Moor Park and Harrow-on-the-Hill, then calling at Finchley Road and all stations to Aldgate. During off-peak times, trains now call at all stations to . For Chesham residents this is a major improvement, as previously Chesham was served in the off-peak solely by a 4-car shuttle train to Chalfont &amp; Latimer, where passengers had to change onto a train to or from Amersham. Although the reasons for the new service pattern were largely technical (the S8 Stock, while designed as two four-car trains, cannot be split into four-car trains as they have driving cabs only at the outer end of each unit), it was expected to ease congestion on local roads by increasing Chesham&#x27;s attractiveness to park-and-ride commuters.

<doc id="745674" wikidata="Q1838543" url="?curid=745674" title="Crossmaglen">
<text>Crossmaglen (, ) is a village and townland in County Armagh, Northern Ireland. It had a population of 1,610 in the 2011 Census and is the largest village in South Armagh. The village centre is the site of a large Police Service of Northern Ireland base and formerly of an observation tower (known locally as the &quot;look-out post&quot;).

The square&#x27;s name commemorates Cardinal Tomás Ó Fiaich, a local man who became Primate of All Ireland (head of the Catholic Church in Ireland), and who died in 1990. However, the Cardinal originated from Crossmaglen&#x27;s close neighbour, Cullyhanna. Crossmaglen has its own GAA team, Crossmaglen Rangers GAC.

Travelling by road, Crossmaglen is to the north of Dublin, to the west of Newry, and to the south of Belfast.

==History==

On 13 January 1921, during the Irish War of Independence, the Irish Republican Army (IRA) shot dead an Ulster Special Constabulary (USC) constable in Crossmaglen. He was the first member of the USC to be killed whilst on duty.

Crossmaglen, along with the rest of South Armagh, would have been transferred to the Irish Free State had the recommendations of the Irish Boundary Commission been enacted in 1925.

===The Troubles===
The British Army had a major presence in the area during the Troubles. Crossmaglen and the wider South Armagh/South Down area was a republican stronghold and republican paramilitaries were very active, earning the area the nickname &quot;Bandit Country.&quot; Labour Party MP Clare Short said in 1983 &quot;It is ridiculous that British troops are here in Crossmaglen. The claim is that they&#x27;re in Ireland keeping the peace between the two communities. But there is only one community in South Armagh, so what the heck are they doing here?&quot; During the Troubles, at least 58 police officers and 124 soldiers were killed by the Provisional Irish Republican Army in South Armagh, many in Crossmaglen itself.

==Education==
*Anamar Primary School (burnt down)
*Clonalig Primary School
*St Brigid&#x27;s Primary School
*St Patrick&#x27;s Primary School
*Gael Scoil Phadraig Naofa
*St Joseph&#x27;s High School

==Governance==
Crossmaglen forms the Newry &amp; Armagh constituency for elections to the Westminster Parliament. The Member of Parliament is Dáire Hughes of Sinn Féin. He won the seat at the 2024 United Kingdom general election.

For Local Government purposes it belongs Newry, Mourne and Down (which was created on 1 April 2015 by merging Newry and Mourne District and Down District). The local authority is Newry, Mourne and Down District Council.

==Transport==
Crossmaglen is served by Ulsterbus, route no. 42.

==Gaelic games==

Crossmaglen in recent years has become known for its Gaelic football team, Crossmaglen Rangers, who won the All-Ireland Senior Club Football Championship in 1997, 1999, 2000, 2007, 2011 and again in 2012. The manager and several players of Rangers went on to win the All-Ireland Senior Football Championship with their county team in 2002 and reached the final again in 2003, only to lose to neighbours Tyrone. One of Crossmaglen&#x27;s most notable players is Oisín McConville, who is also Ulster&#x27;s top scoring player. The county team were also in the All-Ireland Senior Football Championship final in 1953; local players Gene Morgan and Frank Kernan were on the team but they were defeated by Kerry. Armagh also made it to the 1977 All-Ireland Senior Football Championship Final, but were beaten by Dublin.

There was an ongoing dispute for years between Crossmaglen Rangers, the Morgan family of Crossmaglen, and the British Army over the positioning of the army base which was placed on the Rangers pitch and on the back garden of the Morgan family home on Cardinal Ó Fiaich Square. This was remedied, beginning in April 1999.

Crossmaglen Rangers hold the national record of 39 county titles, including 13 in a row. They also hold the record of nine Ulster club titles.
