<text>Tegan and Sara () is a Canadian indie pop duo formed in 1998 in Calgary, Alberta. The band is led by identical twin sisters, Tegan Rain Quin and Sara Keirsten Quin (born September 19, 1980). Both musicians are songwriters and multi-instrumentalists.

The duo has released ten studio albums and earned a Grammy nomination in 2012 for their video album &quot;Get Along&quot;. Their most recent album, &quot;Crybaby&quot;, was released on October 21, 2022. Their memoir, &quot;High School&quot;, was released on September 24, 2019, and in the fall of 2022, the TV series based on the memoir was released on Amazon Freevee.

==History==
=== 1995–2002: Background and early work ===

Tegan and Sara began writing songs at 14. One of the first songs they wrote was &quot;Tegan Didn&#x27;t Go To School Today&quot;, written by Sara and recorded by the pair on cassette tape. The band was first called &quot;Plunk&quot;, short for &quot;light punk&quot;, due to their lack of a drummer and bassist. In 1997, they used their school&#x27;s recording studio to record two demo albums: &quot; So Who&#x27;s in Your Band?&quot; and &quot;Play Day&quot;. In 1998 they won Calgary&#x27;s &quot;Garage Warz&quot; competition, which awarded them studio time. They recorded their first professional demo called &quot;Yellow Tape&quot; under &quot;Sara and Tegan&quot; using this studio time. This was followed by &quot;Orange Tape&quot; and &quot;Red Tape&quot;. In May 1998, they opened for Hayden in Calgary, marking their first major show.

In 1999, they released their debut album, &quot;Under Feet Like Ours&quot;, as &quot;Sara and Tegan&quot;, with producer Jared Kuemper., After listening to it, Elliot Roberts flew up from Los Angeles to meet them at the Starfish Room in Vancouver, British Columbia, and he offered them a record deal that same night. Two songs from &quot;Red Tape&quot; and two from &quot;Orange Tape&quot; appeared on the album. They later changed their name to &quot;Tegan and Sara&quot; because people regularly misheard &quot;Sara and Tegan&quot; as &quot;Sara Antegan&quot;. They signed with Neil Young&#x27;s Vapor Records and released &quot;This Business of Art&quot; through the label in 2000. According to Tegan, having no manager for the first three years of their career taught them to be “very cognizant and present” in every decision.

=== 2002–2011: Mainstream success ===
In 2002, Tegan and Sara released their third album, &quot;If It Was You&quot;. Their fourth album, &quot;So Jealous&quot;, was released in 2004 and led to wider success and attention, both locally and internationally. This album was released through both Vapor and Sanctuary. The band&#x27;s 2007 album, &quot;The Con&quot;&quot;,&quot; was released by Vapor and Sire because Sanctuary no longer released new music in the United States. The album was co-produced by Chris Walla. Guests and collaborators on the album included Jason McGerr of Death Cab for Cutie, Matt Sharp of The Rentals (and previously Weezer), Hunter Burgan of AFI, and Kaki King.

On October 26, 2009, Tegan and Sara released their sixth album, &quot;Sainthood&quot;, produced by Chris Walla and Howard Redekopp. &quot;Sainthood&quot; debuted on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 chart at number 21, selling 24,000 copies in its first week. While recording the album, Tegan and Sara wrote songs together in New Orleans for a week. The song &quot;Paperback Head&quot; was the only song the pair wrote to appear on the album, making it the first song on any Tegan and Sara album they wrote together. Spin gave &quot;Sainthood&quot; four out of five stars and wrote, &quot;Tegan and Sara&#x27;s music may no longer be the stuff of teens, but its strength remains in how much it feels like two people talking.&quot; The duo also put out a three-volume book set titled &quot;ON, IN, AT&quot; that included stories, essays, journals, and photos of the band touring America in late 2008, writing together in New Orleans and touring Australia. Lindsey Byrnes and Ryan Russell took the photographs in the book.

In 2011, they launched &quot;2011: A Merch Odyssey&quot;, which saw at least one new item in the official online stores every month for the entire year. A live CD/DVD combination package titled &quot;Get Along&quot; was released on November 15 and contained three films titled &quot;States&quot;, &quot;India&quot;, and &quot;For the Most Part&quot;. It was nominated for Best Long-Form Music Video at the 2013 Grammy Awards.

=== 2012–2018: &quot;Heartthrob&quot;, &quot;Love You to Death,&quot; and &quot;The Con X: Covers&quot; ===
Tegan and Sara began recording their seventh studio album, &quot;Heartthrob&quot;, on February 20, 2012. Greg Kurstin produced eight songs. Joey Waronker contributed drums to these songs. Two songs were produced by Mike Elizondo, with Victor Indrizzo contributing drums, Josh Lopez contributing guitar, and Dave Palmer contributing piano. Justin Meldal-Johnsen had the last two songs. The first single, &quot;Closer&quot;, was released on September 25, 2012. The album was released on January 29, 2013, and debuted on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Top 200 at number 3, the band&#x27;s highest-charting record, selling 49,000 copies in its first week. &quot;Heartthrob&quot; debuted at number 2 on the Canadian chart and digital downloads chart and hit number 1 on the rock and alternative album charts. In July 2013, the album was shortlisted for the 2013 Polaris Music Prize. In March 2014, Tegan and Sara won three Juno Awards for Single of the Year, Pop Album of the Year and Group of the Year making them the first female band and the first duo to win this award.

Tegan and Sara finished their eighth studio album on November 30, 2015. On March 10, 2016, they announced that the album&#x27;s title would be &quot;Love You to Death&quot;, with the release date set for June 3 of that year. They released the album&#x27;s lead single, &quot;Boyfriend&quot;, on April 8. On April 25, tour dates were announced for their 2016 global tour to support the album. The duo released a music video for each track on the album.

Tegan and Sara collaborated with 17 artists, including Cyndi Lauper, to create &quot;The Con X: Covers&quot; in 2017 to commemorate the tenth anniversary of the release of The Con. The participating artists recorded covers of &quot;The Con&quot;&#x27;s original songs to benefit the Tegan and Sara Foundation. Tegan and Sara also toured an acoustic version of &quot;The Con&quot; in 2017, with some of the proceeds supporting the Tegan and Sara Foundation.

=== 2019–2020: &quot;Hey, I&#x27;m Just Like You&quot; and memoir ===
In May 2018, at Out Web Fest, Tegan stated they were working on a book, podcast and new record. On September 24, 2019, their memoir &quot;High School&quot; was released by MCD Books, a division of Farrar, Straus, and Giroux, alongside Simon &amp; Schuster Canada and Virago Press in the United Kingdom. The memoir details their teenage years, growing up in Canada and &quot;worshipping&quot; Nirvana, Green Day and the Smashing Pumpkins. The book also details the twins&#x27; exploration of their sexuality. While researching the book, Tegan and Sara found cassettes of some of their earliest songs.

In early 2019, Tegan and Sara announced they were working on their next record for release later that year. On July 9, 2019, they announced via Instagram that their ninth album would be called &quot;Hey, I&#x27;m Just Like You&quot; and would consist of 12 re-recorded songs they initially wrote as teenagers. It was released on September 27, 2019, three days after the release of their memoir.

In April 2020, the duo created a live &quot;show&quot; called &quot;Where Does the Good Grow&quot; to entertain their fans during the COVID-19 pandemic, with merchandise designed by EE Storey. The show was held every Thursday at 3 p.m. PST on their Instagram account until the series finale on July 23, 2020.

In 2021, it was announced that a TV show named &quot;High School&quot;, based on their memoir of the same name, would be filmed in Calgary and directed by Clea DuVall. Twins Railey and Seazynn Gilliland were cast as the main characters. The show was filmed from April to June 2022 and was released on Amazon Freevee in the fall of 2022.

=== 2021–2022: &quot;Still Jealous&quot;, new record label, and &quot;Crybaby&quot; ===
In July 2021, Tegan and Sara announced a return to the studio to work on their 10th album. On February 1, 2022, they announced &quot;Still Jealous&quot;, an utterly acoustic re-imagining of &quot;So Jealous&quot;. &quot;Still Jealous&quot; was released on February 11, 2022.

In April 2022, the duo announced they had left Warner Records and signed a new record deal with Mom + Pop. They also released the first single, &quot;Fucking Up What Matters&quot;, from their 10th studio album on April 28, 2022. On July 12, 2022, they unveiled the album title, &quot;Crybaby&quot;, and that it would be released on October 21, 2022. The second single, &quot;Yellow&quot;, was released on the same day, with the music video released on YouTube. The twins also announced their first tour in three years, which started in Philadelphia, PA, on October 26, 2022, and ended in Vancouver on November 20, 2022.

=== 2023–Present: &quot;Junior High&quot;, &quot;Substack&quot; and &quot;Not Tonight Tour&quot; ===
In 2023 the duo released their first graphic novel, titled &quot;Junior High&quot;, based on their youth, with artwork by Tillie Walden. It explores the themes of growing up, coming out, and self-discovery through music and sisterhood (loosely serving as a prequel to their adolescence memoir, &quot;High School&quot;. In February 2024, the duo announced they would be introducing a new subscription to their already popular &quot;Substack&quot; called The Loners Club. This included the reintroduction of the pandemic-era Instagram show &quot;Where does the good grow&quot;. In early 2024, the twins set out on tour to celebrate their album &quot;If It Was You&quot; (2002). The tour is centered around Ontario, Canada, starting in Richmond Hill in March 2024 and ending in Guelph in April 2024. In April 2024, the twins won the Juno Humanitarian award for their work with the Tegan and Sara Foundation.

==Influences==
Tegan and Sara have credited Green Day, Nirvana, and Hole for &quot;truly start[ing] to cement our desire to write and make our music&quot;. During their teenage years, the duo was influenced by Hayden, The Smashing Pumpkins, Violent Femmes, Dinosaur Jr., and Teenage Fanclub. Other artists who have influenced Tegan and Sara include Depeche Mode, Rihanna, Taylor Swift, Madonna, Kate Bush, David Bowie, Mike Elizondo, Pink, Lily Allen, Erasure, Ace of Base, Tom Petty, Britney Spears, Katy Perry, Ani DiFranco, the New Pornographers, Cyndi Lauper, Sinéad O&#x27;Connor, Against Me! and Bruce Springsteen.

==Personal lives==
Both twins are gay, and both are married. In August 2022, Sara welcomed her first child, a son.

At 19, both Quins moved from their hometown of Calgary, Alberta, to Vancouver, B.C. In 2003, Sara moved to Montreal. Tegan lived in Vancouver and Los Angeles for many years, while Sara lived in Montreal and New York City. As of 2019, Tegan and Sara had moved back to Vancouver.

Tegan and Sara are active politically and socially engaged. They advocate for LGBTQ equality, music education, literacy, and cancer research.

The sisters are cousins to musician Jen Twynn Payne, drummer and lead vocalist for the Vancouver-based band The Courtneys.

==Activism and involvement in the LGBTQ+ community==
In 2012, they appeared on the cover of &quot;Under the Radar&quot; magazine&#x27;s &quot;Protest&quot; issue. Both were photographed holding a sign: &quot;The rights of the minority should never be subject to the whim of the majority.&quot; Also, they actively supported Quebec students protesting against the provincial government in Canada. In the U.S., both were vocal during California&#x27;s Prop 8 debates.

In 2013, the band partnered with Coolhaus, their &quot;favourite ice cream sandwich truck&quot;, to create an ice cream sandwich in favour of same-sex marriage. The sandwich featured &quot;double chocolate&quot; cookies and salted caramel ice cream and was named &quot;Til Death Do Us Part&quot;. The duo partnered with Revel &amp; Riot to create a T-shirt that would fund Revel &amp; Riot&#x27;s mission for LGBTQ rights. The &quot;Animals&quot; T-shirt features Tegan and Sara, a turtle, fox, koala, penguin and a dragonfly, all labelled with their Latin names. The text at the bottom reads, &quot;Gay behaviour is found in over 1500 species. LGBTQ equality now.&quot; All sale proceeds go to benefit the work of Revel &amp; Riot.

Due to the expansion of their audience, Tegan and Sara have gained a higher profile in the LGBTQ community. They were awarded Outstanding Music Artist at the GLAAD Media Awards, beating out high-profile musicians, including Lady Gaga and Elton John. In June 2014, Tegan and Sara joined WorldPride to perform in the closing ceremonies at Yonge–Dundas Square in downtown Toronto.

On November 10, 2016, rather than boycotting North Carolina for HB2, Tegan and Sara performed at The Orange Peel and donated their proceeds to Equality North Carolina to fight the legislation. This inspired the band Matt and Kim to match their donation with merchandise proceeds.

In December 2016, in the wake of the United States presidential election, the sisters founded the Tegan and Sara Foundation to advocate for &quot;economic justice, health and representation for LGBTQ girls and women&quot;. They have since partnered with Kiehl&#x27;s to release Ultra Facial cleansers with limited-edition packaging to raise funds for the foundation. Profits from &quot;The Con X: Covers&quot; and a portion of ticket prices from &quot;The Con&quot;&#x27;s 10th-anniversary tour went to the Tegan and Sara Foundation. At the end of &quot;The Con&quot;&#x27;s 10th-anniversary tour in 2017, they stated their plan to take two years off from touring to focus on the foundation and to make a new record.

In 2024, Tegan and Sara began activism in response to new policy pitched by the United Conservative Party in Alberta. The proposed bill was posed to impact LGBTQ youth by outing them to parents if they used new pronouns or names in school, and limited medical care for trans youth. The Tegan and Sara Foundation published an open letter signed by more than 400 Canadian musicians denouncing the UCP policy. The two also used their Juno Awards speech time to speak against this policy.

==Touring==
Tegan and Sara began touring after graduating high school in 1998, travelling by car and Greyhound bus. In 2000, they toured with Neil Young and the Pretenders. Other notable touring mates include Ryan Adams, Weezer, Bryan Adams, Jack Johnson, the Black Keys, Ben Folds, Gogol Bordello, Cake, City and Colour, Death Cab for Cutie, Hot Hot Heat, the Killers, New Found Glory, Paramore, Rufus Wainwright, Eugene Francis Jnr, the Jezabels, An Horse, Steel Train, Holly Miranda and Speak.

<text>The RCA 474L Ballistic Missile Early Warning System (BMEWS, 474L System, Project 474L) was a United States Air Force Cold War early warning radar, computer, and communications system, for ballistic missile detection. The network of twelve radars, which was constructed beginning in 1958 and became operational in 1961, was built to detect a mass ballistic missile attack launched on northern approaches [for] 15 to 25 minutes&#x27; warning time also provided Project Space Track satellite data (e.g., about one-quarter of SPADATS observations).

It was replaced by the Solid State Phased Array Radar System in 2001.

==Background==
The Ballistic Missile Early Warning System (BMEWS) was a radar system built by the United States (with the cooperation of Canada and Denmark on whose territory some of the radars were sited) during the Cold War to give early warning of a Soviet intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) nuclear strike, to allow time for US bombers to get off the ground and land-based US ICBMs to be launched, to reduce the chances that a preemptive strike could destroy US strategic nuclear forces.

The shortest (great circle) route for a Soviet ICBM attack on North America is across the North Pole, so the BMEWS facilities were built in the Arctic at Clear Space Force Station in central Alaska, and Site J near Pituffik Space Base, Thule, Greenland. When it became clear in the 1950s that the Soviet Union was developing ICBMs, the US was already building an early-warning radar system in the Arctic, the DEW line, but it was designed to detect bombers and did not have the capability of tracking ICBMs.

The challenges of designing a system that could detect and track a massive strike of hundreds of ICBMs were formidable. The radar sites were located as far north in the Arctic as possible, to give maximum warning time of an attack. However, the time between when a Soviet missile would rise above the horizon and be detected and when it would reach its target in the US was only 10 to 25 minutes.

== Equipment ==
BMEWS consisted of two types of radars and various computer and reporting systems to support them. The first type of radar consisted of very large, fixed rectangular partial-parabolic reflectors with two primary feed points. They produced two fan-shaped microwave beams that allowed them to detect targets across a very wide horizontal front at two narrow vertical angles. These were used to provide wide-front coverage of missiles rising into their radar horizon, and by tracking them at two points as they climbed, enough information to determine their rough trajectory.

The second type of radar was used for fine tracking of selected targets, and consisted of a very large steerable parabolic reflector under a large radome. These radars provided high-resolution angular and ranging information that was fed to a computer for rapid calculation of the probable impact points of the missile warheads. The systems were upgraded several times over their lifetime, replacing the mechanically scanned systems with phased array radar that could perform both roles at the same time.

BMEWS equipment included:
*General Electric AN/FPS-50 Radar Set, a UHF (440 MHz) detector with transmitter having an organ-pipe scanner feed, fixed 1,500 ton parabolic-torus reflector, and receiver with Doppler filter bank to scan with two horizontally-sweeping fans for as many as ~12,000 observations per day for surveillance (determining range, position, and range rate) of space objects
*RCA AN/FPS-49 Radar Set, a five-horn monopulse tracker (e.g., three at Site III) and FPS-49A variant (different radome) at Thule (vacuum tubes 10 feet tall in transmitter buildings are used to warm the site)
*RCA AN/FPS-92 Radar Set, an upgraded FPS-49 featuring more elaborate receiver circuits and hydrostatic bearings at Clear
*Sylvania AN/FSQ-53 Radar Monitoring Set, with console and Signal Data Converter Group (&quot;data take-off unit&quot;)
*Sylvania AN/FSQ-28 Missile Impact Predictor Set, with duplex IBM-7090 TX solid-state computers e.g., in Building 2 at Thule and part of the AN/FPA-21 Radar Central Computer at Site III—Satellite Information Processor (SIP) software was later added at Site III for use on the backup IBM 7090.
*RCA Communications Data Processor (CDP), as used in the Western Electric Air Force Communications Network (AF DATACOM) of AUTODIN
*Western Electric BMEWS Rearward Communications System, a network to link the separate elements and one of six ADC comm systems: BMEWS Rearward Long-Lines System at CFS Resolution Island and CFS Saglek, (cf. Pole Vault system on the Pinetree Line, White Alice in Alaska, and to RAF Fylingdales, NARS)
*BMEWS Central Computer and Display Facility (CC&amp;DF) at Ent AFB (ZI portion of BMEWS), with RCA Display Information Processor (DIP)—DIPS displays were also at the Offutt AFB war room floor and balcony, as well as at the Pentagon
To predict when parts might break down, the contractor also installed RCA 501 computers with 32k high-speed memory, 5-76KC 556 bpi 3/4&quot; tape drives, and 200-track random-access LFE drums. The initially replaced portions of BMEWS included the Ent CC&amp;DF by the Burroughs 425L Missile Warning System at the Cheyenne Mountain Complex (FOC 1 July 1966.) The original Missile Impact Predictors were replaced (IOC on 31 August 1984), and BMEWS systems were entirely replaced by 2001 (e.g., radars were replaced with AN/FPS-120 SSPARS) after Satellite Early Warning Systems had been deployed (e.g., 1961 MIDAS, 1968 Project 949, and 1970 DSP satellites).

==Classification of radar systems==

Under the Joint Electronics Type Designation System (JETDS), all U.S. military radar and tracking systems are assigned a unique identifying alphanumeric designation. The letters “AN” (for Army-Navy) are placed ahead of a three-letter code.
*The first letter of the three-letter code denotes the type of platform hosting the electronic device, where A=Aircraft, F=Fixed (land-based), S=Ship-mounted, and T=Ground transportable.
*The second letter indicates the type of equipment, where P=Radar (pulsed), Q=Sonar, and R=Radio.
*The third letter indicates the function or purpose of the device, where G=Fire control, R=Receiving, S=Search, and T=Transmitting.

Thus, the AN/FPS-49 represents the 49th design of an Army-Navy “Fixed, Radar, Search” electronic device.

== Early tests ==
On 2 June 1955, a General Electric AN/FPS-17 &quot;XW-1&quot; radar at Site IX in Turkey that had been expedited was completed by the US in proximity to the ballistic missile launch test site at Kapustin Yar in the Soviet Union for tracking Soviet rockets and to demonstrate the feasibility of advanced Doppler processing, high-power system components, and computerized tracking needed for .

The first missile tracked was on 15 June, and the radar&#x27;s parabolic reflector was replaced in 1958, and its range was extended from 1000 to 2000 nautical miles after the 1957 Gaither Commission identified that because of expected Soviet ICBM development, there would be little likelihood of SAC&#x27;s bombers surviving since there was no way to detect an incoming attack until the first warhead landed.

BMEWS&#x27; General Operational Requirement 156 was issued on 7 November 1957 (BMEWS was designed to go with the active portion of the WIZARD system) and on 4 February 1958; the USAF informed Air Defense Command (ADC) that BMEWS was an &quot;all-out program&quot; and the &quot;system has been directed by the President, has the same national priority as the ballistic missile and satellite programs and is being placed on the Department of Defense master urgency list&quot;. By July 1958 after NORAD manning began, ADC&#x27;s 1954 blockhouse for the Ent AFB command center had inadequate floor space; and Ent&#x27;s &quot;requirement for a ballistic missile defense system display facility...brought renewed action...for a new command post&quot; (the JCS approved the nuclear bunker on 11 February 1959).

== Planning and development ==
On 14 January 1958, the US announced its decision to establish a Ballistic Missile Early Warning System with Thule to be operational in 1959—total Thule/Clear costs in a May 1958 estimate were ~$800 million (an October 13, 1958, plan for both estimated completion in September 1960.) The Lincoln Laboratory&#x27;s radar at Millstone Hill, Massachusetts, was built and provided data to a 1958 for trajectory estimates, e.g., Cape Canaveral missiles, and an adjunct high-power UHF test facility employed the Millstone transmitter to stress-test the components that were candidates for the operational BMEWS. (A twin of the Millstone Hill radar was dedicated at Saskatchewan&#x27;s Prince Albert Radar Laboratory on June 6, 1959.) A prototype AN/FPS-43 BMEWS radar completed at Trinidad in 1958 went operational on 4 February 1959, the date of an Atlas II B firing from Cape Canaveral Launch Complex 11 (lunar reflection was tested January–June 1960). On June 30, 1958, NORAD emphasized that the BMEWS could not be considered as a self-contained entity separate from the Nike Zeus, or vice versa.

On 18 March 1959, the USAF told the BMEWS Project Office to proceed with an interim facility for the &quot;AICBM control center&quot; with an anti-ICBM C3 computer (e.g., for when the USAF Wizard and/or Army Nike Zeus ABMs became operational), and the basement of the 1954 ADC blockhouse was considered for the interim center. A &quot;satellite prediction computer&quot; could be added to the planned missile warning center if Cheyenne Mountain&#x27;s &quot;hardened COC slipped considerably beyond January 1962&quot; (tunneling began in June 1961.) In early 1959 for use at Ent in September 1960, a BMEWS display facility with &quot;austere and economical construction with minimum equipment&quot; was planned in an &quot;annex to the current COC building&quot;. In late 1959, ARPA opened the 474L System Program Office, and BMEWS&#x27; &quot;12th Missile Warning Squadron at Thule...began operating in January 1960.&quot; Following a Nike ABM intercept of a test missile, the planned Cheyenne Mountain mission was expanded in August 1960 to &quot;a hardened center from which CINCNORAD would supervise and direct operations against space attack as well as air attack&quot; (NORAD assumed &quot;operational control of all space assets with the formation of&quot; SPADATS in October 1960.) The 1st Aerospace Surveillance and Control Squadron (1st Aero) was activated at Ent AFB on 14 February 1961; and Ent&#x27;s Federal Building was completed .

== Deployment ==
Clear AFS construction began in August 1958 with 700 workers and was completed 1 July 1961, and Thule Site J construction began by 18 May 1960, with radar pedestals complete by 2 June. Thule testing began on 16 May 1960, IOC was completed on 30 September, and the initial operational radar transmission was in October 1960 (initially duplex vacuum tube IBM 709s occupied two floors).

On 5 October 1960, when Khrushchev was in New York, radar returns during moonrise at Thule produced a false alarm. On 20 January 1961, CINCNORAD approved two-second FPS-50 frequency hoping to eliminate reception of echoes beyond artificial satellite orbits. On 24 November 1961, an AT&amp;T operator failure at their Black Forest microwave station northeast of Colorado Springs caused a BMEWS communications outage to Ent and Offutta B-52 near Thule confirmed the site still remained.

Training for civilian technicians included a February 1961 RCA class in New Jersey for a Tracking Radar Automatic Monitoring class. The &quot;Clear Msl Early Warning Stn, Nenana, AK&quot; was assigned to Hanscom Field, Massachusetts, by the JCA on 1 April 1961. By 16 May 1961, Ent&#x27;s &quot;War Room at NORAD&quot; had a glass map for plotting aircraft and had a &quot;map [that] lights up&quot; to show multiple impact ellipses and times &quot;before the huge missile[s] would burst&quot; (separate from Ent&#x27;s BMEWS CC&amp;DF building, the two-story blockhouse had a war room with, left of the main NORAD region display, a BMEWS display map and &quot;threat summary display&quot; with a count of incoming missiles.) The Trinidad Test Site transferred from Rome AFB to Patrick AFB on 1 July 1961 (closed as &quot;Trinidad Air Station&quot; on 1 October 1971) and the same month, the 1st Aero began using Ent&#x27;s Space Detection and Tracking System (SPADATS) operation center in building P4&#x27;s annex (Cheyenne Mtn&#x27;s Space Defense Center became fully operational in 1967.) The BRCS undersea cable was cut &quot;presumably by fishing trawlers&quot; in September, October, and November 1961 (the BMEWS teletype and backup SSB substituted); and in December 1961, Capt. Joseph P. Kaufman was charged &quot;with giving [BMEWS] defense data to ... East German Communists.&quot;

=== BMEWS surveillance wing ===
The 71st Surveillance Wing, Ballistic Missile Early Warning System, was activated on 6 December 1961, at Ent AFB (renamed 71st Missile Warning Wing on 1 January 1967, at McGuire AFB 21 July 1969 – 30 April 1971). Syracuse&#x27;s BMEWS Test Facility at GE&#x27;s High-Power Radar Laboratory became the responsibility of Rome Air Development Center on 11 April 1962 (Syracuse&#x27;s Eagle Hill Test Annex closed in 1970) and on 31 July 1962, NORAD recommended a tracking radar station at Cape Clear to close the BMEWS gap with Thule for low-angle missiles (versus those with the 15-65 degree angle for which BMEWS was designed.) By mid-1962, BMEWS &quot;quick fixes&quot; for ECCM had been installed at Fylingdales Moor, Thule and Cape Clear AK and by June 30, integration of BMEWS and SPADATS at Ent AFB was completed. During the Cuban Missile Crisis, the Moorestown AN/FPS-49 radar on 24 October was &quot;withdrawn from SPADATS and realigned to provide missile surveillance over Cuba.&quot; 1962 &quot;strikes and walkouts&quot; delayed Fylingdales&#x27; planned completion from March until September 1963 and on 7 November, the Pentagon BMEWS display subsytem installation was complete. At the end of 1962, NORAD was &quot;concerned over BMEWS&#x27; virtual inability to detect objects beyond a range of 1500 nautical miles.&quot; The Moorestown FPS-49 completed a BMEWS &quot;signature analysis program&quot; on scale models by January 1963.

== Air Defense Command / Aerospace Defense Command ==
Operations transferred from civilian contractors (RCA Government Services) to ADC on 5 January 1962 (renamed Aerospace Defense Command in 1968.) Fylingdales became operational on 17 September 1963, and Site III transferred to RAF Fighter Command on 15 January 1964.

Remaining BMEWS development responsibilities transferred to the &quot;Space Track SPO (496L)&quot; when the BMEWS SPO closed on 14 February 1964—e.g., the AN/FPS-92 with &quot;66-inch panels&quot; was added to Clear in 1966 (last of the five tracking radars), and in 1967, BMEWS modification testing was complete on 15 May, when the system cost totaled $1.259 billion, equivalent to $ in . 
In 1968, Ent&#x27;s 9th Division HQ had a Spacetrack/BMEWS Maintenance Section.

In 1975, SECDEF told Congress that Clear would be closed when Cobra Dane and the Beale AFB PAVE PAWS became operational. By 1976, BMEWS included IBM 7094, CDC 6000, and Honeywell 800 computers.

== USAF Space Command ==
On 1 October 1979, Thule and Clear transferred to Strategic Air Command when ADCOM was broken up then to Space Command in 1982. By 1981 Cheyenne Mountain had been averaging 6,700 messages per hour compiled via sensor inputs from BMEWS, the JSS, the 416N SLBM &quot;Detection and Warning System, COBRA DANE, and PARCS as well as SEWS and PAVE PAWS&quot; for transmission to the NCA. To replace AN/FSQ-28 predictors, a late 1970s plan for processing returns from MIRVs installed in new Missile Impact Predictor computers was complete by September 1984.

==Replacement==
The BMEWS was replaced by the Solid State Phased Array Radar System in 2001.

<doc id="736541" wikidata="Q4961369" url="?curid=736541" title="2003 Brent East by-election">
<text>A by-election for the United Kingdom parliamentary constituency of Brent East on 18 September 2003, following the death of Labour Party MP Paul Daisley on 18 June that year. It was won by the Liberal Democrat candidate Sarah Teather.

The Liberal Democrats held the seat in the 2005 general election.

== Result ==
The turnout was 36.23%. Liberal Democrat candidate Sarah Teather won with 39.12% of the vote, which was a swing of 29% from Labour. This was the largest swing from Labour to a Liberal or Liberal Democrat candidate since the Bermondsey by-election in 1983. Commentators linked the result to anger from traditional voters over the Iraq War, as well as to the private sector&#x27;s involvement in public services.







There were 109 spoilt ballots.

==Previous result==
Labour held the seat with 63.2% of the vote at the 2001 general election. The Liberal Democrats came third in the seat at that time, with only 10.6% of the vote.




== Aftermath ==
Lib Dem leader Charles Kennedy called the result &quot;a big boost for British politics&quot;. He said, &quot;We have shown that there is no such thing as a no-go area for the Liberal Democrats. In Britain&#x27;s most diverse community, we have shown that we can speak for every section of society and the Liberal Democrat message is one they want to hear and support.&quot;

In &quot;The Independent&quot;, psephologist John Curtice stated that &quot;the defeat is not simply a little local difficulty. The finger of blame lies with the [Labour] party nationally. And there are two obvious candidates – Iraq and the domestic agenda.&quot; He went on to say that, due to Brent East&#x27;s substantial Muslim and ethnic minority population, &quot;the war is likely to have been especially unpopular. And there are plenty of Labour MPs whose electoral fortunes depend in part on the votes of Britain&#x27;s ethnic minority communities.&quot;

Labour Party chairman Ian McCartney admitted that the invasion of Iraq had played a major role in the party&#x27;s defeat. &quot;It is the first time since 1988 that we have lost an election,&quot; he said. &quot;It&#x27;s been unprecedented in modern times, so I am very disappointed, particularly as we had an excellent candidate in Robert Evans and an excellent campaign. The backdrop of the controversy over Iraq in its many forms has caused difficulty in the by-election and generally in getting our message across about the big investment programme we have got in public services, the economy and tackling anti-social behaviour and crime.&quot;

The Conservative candidate, Uma Fernandes, was a local councillor. Her daughter Suella Fernandes, a young lawyer who was also on the list of parliamentary candidates, had to be persuaded not to seek the nomination, and in the event campaigned for her mother. In 2015, Suella Fernandes was elected for Fareham.

<text>Heydar Aliyev International Airport (; IATA: GYD, ICAO: UBBB) is one of the seven international airports serving Azerbaijan. It is the busiest airport both in Azerbaijan and in the South Caucasus as well as one of the busiest in the post-Soviet countries. Formerly, it was called Bina International Airport, after a suburb of the Azerbaijani capital Baku. The airport is 20 kilometers northeast of Baku, connected to the city by Baku Airport Highway. It serves as the hub for national carrier Azerbaijan Airlines as well as for Azal Avia Cargo and Silk Way West Airlines.

==History==
Baku Airport began its operations in 1933, when the first flight to Moscow through the Caucasus Mountains took place. The Baku-Moscow flight route was established four years later in 1937, and commenced its operations to carry 15 passengers daily. A year later, in 1938, Baku-Rostov and Baku-Grozny flights were introduced as well. After World War II, flights to Ashgabat were introduced to the public. In 1955, a multi-seat Ilyushin Il-14 plane was added to the airport&#x27;s aircraft. On 20 June 1959, the first flight of aircraft type Ilyushin Il-18 took place on the Baku-Moscow route.

On 9 February 1964, a new passenger terminal complex was opened and put into operation at Baku Airport.

On 31 August 1990, Baku Airport gained international status and opened up for flights outside of the Soviet Union, which dissolved a year later in 1991. In October 1997, the presentation of a new passenger terminal was held, which was attended by the President of the Republic of Azerbaijan Heydar Aliyev. The newly opened terminal was soon known as Terminal 2. A year later, in 1998, a new runway was opened. The new passenger terminal complex was put into operation in 1999. Its ceremony was attended by Heydar Aliyev, and President of Turkey Suleyman Demirel. The same year, a new air traffic control (ATC) center of Baku Airport was put into operation, and the new Aviation Petrol Complex (TC1) commenced its operations as well.

On 10 March 2004, by decree of the President of the Republic of Azerbaijan, the airport was renamed after Heydar Aliyev, the long-standing Soviet party boss in the Azerbaijan Soviet Socialist Republic and later president of Azerbaijan.

On 7 May 2004, a new passenger terminal for domestic flights at Heydar Aliyev International Airport was put into operation. Currently, it serves as a major hub for domestic flights within the country, flying to cities such as Ganja and Nakhchivan. In March of 2005, Baku Cargo Terminal (BCT) was opened. The opening ceremony was attended by the President of the Republic of Azerbaijan Ilham Aliyev.

President of Azerbaijan Ilham Aliyev attended the groundbreaking ceremony of a new terminal building at the airport on 17 March 2011, and reviewed the progress of construction that December. On 20 April 2012, a new runway at the airport was opened. The opening ceremony was attended by the President of the Republic of Azerbaijan Ilham Aliyev, and would get acquainted with the reconstruction and construction works at the existing air terminal complex. A new hangar complex of Silk Way Technics and the International Logistics Centre opened on 6 May 2013. Ilham Aliyev observed and reviewed two new Airbus A340-500 passenger liners. That October, a new building of the main air traffic control center of the AZANS Air Traffic Department under the Azerbaijan Airlines closed joint-stock company was held.

The opening of Terminal 1 of the Heydar Aliyev International Airport was held on 23 April 2014. The President of the Republic of Azerbaijan Ilham Aliyev and members of his family attended this ceremony. The first flight from Terminal 1 took place the same day, with the plane departing for Istanbul (Sabiha). The airport gained a direct link to North America when Azerbaijan Airlines began flying to New York City in September 2014.

In November of 2014, the airport received Skytrax&#x27; 4-star rank. The airport received this rank again on 24 December 2016.

The opening ceremony of the Azerbaijan Efficiency, Strategy, and Development Center (ASEC) took place at Heydar Aliyev International Airport on 8 November 2018.

In March, the airport would be recognized as the &quot;Best Airport of the Countries of CIS.&quot; The airport was named the &quot;Best Airport among Airports in Russia and the CIS Countries&quot; for the second time at Skytrax World Airport Awards 2018. On 7 May 2018, Heydar Aliyev International Airport was awarded a 5-star Regional Airport title by Skytrax.

On 11 May 2020, Heydar Aliyev International Airport&#x27;s status of the &quot;Best Airport among Airports in Russia and the CIS Countries&quot; was confirmed and assigned by Skytrax. On 12 April 2021, the airport received the highest rating for safety measures against the COVID-19 pandemic. In 2022, Heydar Aliyev International Airport topped the ranking of the best airports in Central Asia and the CIS for the fifth time in a row, according to Skytrax World Airport Awards 2022. It won an award for the &quot;Best Airport Staff in Central Asia and the CIS&quot; the same year. On 16 March 2023, the airport was recognized as the “Best Regional Airport in Central Asia and the CIS” for the second time in a row. It won the “Best Airport Staff in Central Asia and the CIS” category as well.

On 26 October 2023, Heydar Aliyev International Airport made history and officially became the first airport in the world to completely switch to cloud technologies. April 2024 saw the airport once again win the prestigious Skytrax World Airport Awards 2024. It won the “Best Airport in Central Asia and the CIS” and “Best Airport Staff in Central Asia and the CIS&quot; categories. On 19 April 2024, the airport joined the ranks of Airports Council International (ACI Europe), the only global organization of airport operators.

<text>The Via Aemilia (, ) was a trunk Roman road in the north Italian plain, running from &quot;Ariminum&quot; (Rimini), on the Adriatic coast, to &quot;Placentia&quot; (Piacenza) on the River &quot;Padus&quot; (Po). It was completed in 187 BC. The Via Aemilia connected at Rimini with the Via Flaminia, which had been completed 33 years earlier, to Rome.

== History ==

The land today known as northern Italy (&quot;Italia settentrionale&quot;) was known to the ancient Romans during the republican period (to 44 BC) as Gallia Cisalpina (literally: Gaul on the near – i.e. southern – side of the Alps) because it was then inhabited by Celtic tribes from Gaul, who had colonised the area in the 4th and 5th centuries BC.

&quot;Italia&quot; meant the area inhabited by Italic tribes: the border between &quot;Italia&quot; and &quot;Gallia Cisalpina&quot; was roughly a line between &quot;Pisae&quot; (Pisa) and &quot;Ariminum&quot;.
&quot;Gallia Cisalpina&quot; contained the Pianura padana (Po river plain). This vast country, by far the largest fertile plain in the mountainous peninsula, contained potentially its best agricultural land, and offered the Romans the opportunity to expand enormously their population and economic resources by mass colonisation.

The Romans subjugated the Gauls of the Pianura Padana in a series of hard-fought campaigns in the late 3rd century BC. By 220 BC, the Via Flaminia was completed, providing the Romans with ready access to the region. However, Roman expansion was delayed for some twenty years by the Second Punic War. During the Carthaginian general Hannibal&#x27;s invasion of Italy (218 BC–203 BC), Roman military control of the Pianura Padana was temporarily overthrown. Many of the recently defeated tribes (such as the Insubres and the Boii) rebelled and joined forces with Hannibal in the hope of regaining their independence. 

It was not until 189 BC that the rebel tribes had been pacified sufficiently to allow work on the Via Aemilia to begin.

The time-tested Roman method of expansion was to build a brand new road straight through the newly conquered territory, and then establish a string of colonies, either of civilian settlers or of military veterans along its route. The settlers would be allocated fertile plots from lands confiscated from the defeated native peoples. This was the precise function of the Via Aemilia: its period of construction also saw the foundation of Roman colonies along its whole length at &quot;Bononia&quot; (Bologna) (founded 189 BC), &quot;Mutina&quot; (Modena), &quot;Regium&quot; (Reggio Emilia), and Parma (all founded in 183 BC).

The Via Aemilia was completed by, and named after, the Roman consul Marcus Aemilius Lepidus in 187 BC. It was built, on elevated embankments, in part, on top of an older road system that linked the Adriatic to the Tyrrhenian Sea. The consular road ran, largely in a straight line, 176 Roman miles (260 km) NW from Rimini to its termination at Piacenza, connected pre-existing towns, such as Piacenza, Bologna and Rimini.

The road ran along the southern edge of the flat Pianura Padana within sight of the northern foothills of Italy&#x27;s Apennine Mountains, crossing numerous tributary rivers of the Po, notably the Rubicon near Rimini and the River Trebbia near Piacenza. In the century following the construction of the Via Aemilia, Piacenza became the key Roman road hub in the pianura padana. In 148 BC, the Via Postumia linked Piacenza to Aquileia on the north Adriatic coast. In 109 BC, the consul Marcus Aemilius Scaurus completed the Via Aemilia Scaura to &quot;Genua&quot; (Genoa) and &quot;Pisae&quot; (Pisa).

== Bridges ==

There are the remains of several Roman bridges along the road, including the Ponte d&#x27;Augusto, Ponte di Sant&#x27;Arcangelo di Romagna, Ponte San Vito, Ponte sul Reno, Ponte sul Rubicone, and Ponte sul Taro.

At Rimini, the starting point of the Via Aemilia, the road&#x27;s Ponte di Tiberio still exists, a massive structure spanning the River Marecchia, started by the Emperor Augustus and completed by his successor Tiberius. It still bears its twin dedicatory inscriptions.
At Bologna, milestone 78 was found in the bed of the River Reno. It records Augustus&#x27; reconstruction of the &quot;Aemilia&quot;, in 2 BC, from Rimini as far as the River Trebbia. Remains of the &quot;Aemilia&quot; bridge over the Reno were found in the 1890s, consisting of parts of the parapets from each side. These were originally 38.75 feet apart, of Veronese red marble. 

The bed of the river was found to have risen at least 20 feet since this bridge collapsed in the 9th century. Ruins of some of the other ancient Roman bridges still exist. 

At Savignano sul Rubicone a Roman bridge survived until it was demolished as recently as World War II. The current bridge is a reconstruction.

==Legacy==

The construction of the Via Aemilia launched the intensive Roman colonisation of the Pianura Padana. The vast agricultural potential of this region soon rendered it the most populous and economically important part of Italy, overshadowing Central Italy, Rome and the South.

The area remains economically preeminent in modern Italy. By the time of the Second Triumvirate (44 BC – 30 BC), Romanisation of this formerly Celtic country was so complete that the province of &quot;Gallia Cisalpina&quot; was abolished and its territory incorporated into the heartland province of &quot;Italia&quot;.

The road gave its name to that part of &quot;Gallia Cisalpina&quot; through which it ran. This area was, before the Roman conquest, the territory of the Gallic tribes Boii (who gave their name to the city of Bologna) and Senones. It was already commonly referred to as &quot;Aemilia&quot; by the time the Emperor Augustus assumed sole power. In around 7 BC, when Augustus divided the &quot;provincia&quot; of Italia into 11 &quot;regiones&quot; (administrative districts), the area became the eighth &quot;regio&quot;. This initially had the official name of &quot;Padus&quot;, but was later changed to &quot;Aemilia&quot;.

The western part of this area is still known as Emilia today. The boundaries of the Roman VIII regio roughly corresponded to those of the modern Italian administrative region of Emilia-Romagna. Its inhabitants are today known as &quot;Emiliani&quot;. The modern Italian State Road 9 is still officially called Via Emilia and follows the Roman route over much of its length. Indeed, the modern road in many parts lies directly above the Roman road.

==Early life==

Severina was born in Split, SR Croatia, SFR Yugoslavia on 21 April 1972, the youngest daughter of Ana (who was from Drniš) and Sever Vučković. Aljoša Vučković is her uncle. She also has two older sisters, Zdenka and Marijana. Severina has had a love for music and stage performance from an early age. When asked how did she got her name &quot;Severina&quot;, she responded by saying: &quot;&quot;My father wanted me to be Nataša, but my mom adored my father who&#x27;s name was Sever, and my grandfather was giving his children names by Cardinal directions&quot; (Serbo-Croatian: Sever - North)

From a young age, she was interested in music, dance, acting and the piano. She started singing as a girl in KUD Mozaik, which was led by Lepa Smoje, wife of Miljenko Smoje, who immediately recognized Severina as a future star. Lepa Smoje assigned her the role of Carmela in the musical &quot;Frane Štrapalo&quot;. Lepa Smoje once said: &quot;The moment I saw her on the stage of the Frano Štrapalo musical, I said: this little girl is a born star&quot;&quot; Later, she started singing in the Treća smena group and won first prizes at competitions, one of which was from the Student summer, where she was declared the best singer. After finishing elementary school, Severina enrolled in the Josip Hatze High School of Music in Split, but she stopped her education in order to devote herself to a musical career.

==Career==
===Beginnings (1982 - 1993)===
Severina&#x27;s career was launched in the late 1980s when she began performing in local festivals and competitions. In 1982, in Split, at the &quot;Dječji prvi pljesak&quot; (Children&#x27;s First Applause) competition, Severina won with the song &quot;Moja Milena&quot;. In 1987, at the Croatian amateur singer competition in Daruvar, Severina won with Josipa Lisac&#x27;s song &quot;O jednoj mladosti&quot; (&#x27;About one youth&#x27;). One of her first major performances came in 1989, when she was 17 in her hometown of Split. In Hotel Marjan, she performed &quot;Tata čuješ li muziku&quot; (&quot;Dad can you hear the music&quot;). She performed at various festivals, and in 1990 she moved to Zagreb where she won the radio competition &quot;Demo X&quot; at Radio Zagreb, which won her an opportunity to record her first album. Severina started playing music professionally in 1990. In July 1991, she performed &quot;Vodi me na ples&quot; (&quot;Take me to dance&quot;) at Split Festival. She released her first self-titled album called &quot;&quot;Severina&quot; in 1990. After meeting Zrinko Tutić in 1992, Severina recorded her second self-titled album &quot;Severina&quot;&quot;, released by Croatia Records. The album contained songs like &quot;Vodi me na ples&quot; (&quot;Take me to dance&quot;) and &quot;Kad si sam&quot; (&quot;When you’re alone&quot;), &quot;Idemo se ljubiti&quot; (&quot;Let&#x27;s kiss&quot;), which quickly won the hearts of the audience and became hits. During the collaboration with Tutić, she also recorded the albums &quot;Dalmatinka&quot;, &quot;Trava zelena&quot;, &quot;Moja stvar&quot; and &quot;Djevojka sa sela&quot;. She signed a six-year contract with the production company Tutico and Zrinko Tutić, who introduced her to Croatian singer and songwriter Gibonni. At the singer&#x27;s urging, Zrinko gave Gibonni the chance to record the song &quot;Zlatne godine&quot; (Golden Years), which he had written. In addition to the two of them, she also collaborated with Dino Dvornik.

That same year she won the first prize at the Zagreb Festival with the song &quot;Sklopi oči muzika dok svira&quot; (&quot;Close Your Eyes While the Music Is Playing&quot;). She soon became the host of the show &quot;Top Cup&quot; on Croatian Radiotelevision (HRT), which she hosted for a year, and at the end of the year she went on her first tour in Australia.

In 1993, Severina with her previous producer Zrinko Tutić recorded the album &quot;Dalmatinka&quot; (&quot;Dalmatian girl&quot;) for the same record company, which brought her great popularity. The title song can be considered one of Severina&#x27;s signature songs. The leading song from her third studio album, &quot;Dalmatinka&quot; (&quot;Dalmatian Woman&quot;), became a sensation and captured the emotions of many at the time of release. In the song, Severina sang about her love for her native Dalmatia, the color of white and Virgin Mary. The album had a total of 10 songs among which were &quot;Ne bi&#x27; ti oprostila&quot; (&quot;I Wouldn&#x27;t Forgive You&quot;), &quot;Ne spavaj mala moja&quot; (&quot;Don&#x27;t Sleep, My Baby Girl&quot;; Bijelo Dugme cover), &quot;Paloma nera&quot; (&quot;Black Dove&quot;), &quot;Ljubi me noćas&quot; (Kiss me tonight) and others. Both &quot;Paloma nera&quot; and the title track became number one hits on the national top list, and a very successful tour of Croatia and Slovenia followed.

===Further success (1993 - 1998)===

In 1995, the album &quot;Trava zelena&quot; (&quot;Green Grass&quot;) was released. Although it did not have as many hits as the previous ones, it was commercially successful. It contains ten tracks: &quot;Trava zelena&quot; (Green grass), &quot;Vatra i led&quot; (Fire and ice), &quot;Mr. Taliman&quot;, &quot;Bože moj&quot; (My God), &quot;Bambola&quot;, &quot;Lude godine&quot; (Crazy Years), &quot;Poželi me&quot; (Wish for me), &quot;Pruži mi ruku&quot; (Give me your hand), &quot;Ludo moja&quot; (Crazy mine), &quot;Ti si srce moje&quot; (You are my heart) a duet with Žera from Crvena Jabuka. Other collaborators on the album were Faruk Buljubasic, Nenad Ninčević, Rajko Dujmić, and for the first time Severina herself is credited as a writer on three songs. The title track was the most popular song of the year and Severina&#x27;s primacy on the Croatian media platform rose as a result. It was another collaboration with Tutić.

Her fifth studio album was &quot;Moja stvar&quot; (&quot;My Thing&quot;), released on 5 November 1996. The album was influenced by rock sounds. The title track was written and composed by Severina herself. To promote the album, Severina held a sold-out concert on 14 November 1996 in Dom Sportova venue in Zagreb. She opened the concert with the song &quot;Moja stvar&quot; (My thing). In &quot;Zrcalo&quot; interview on HRT, when asked why the album wasn’t dance influenced, she responded by saying: &quot;&quot;Why should we separate music on only dance and pop?&quot; &quot;. 

Her biggest breakthrough at the time was in 1998 when she released the album &quot;Djevojka sa sela&quot; (&quot;Girl from a village&quot;), which was composed and written partly by Tutić and partly by Severina. Severina wrote six songs. The title track is one of her biggest hits and was used by the Croatia national football team as their unofficial anthem during their campaign at the 1998 FIFA World Cup. &quot;Djevojka sa sela&quot; was her last album composed by Tutić and his production company Tutico. They parted ways following its release due to a contract dispute.

===Continued success (1999 - 2003)===

In early 1999, Severina went on a second tour of Australia, and in July of the same year she performed at the Melodies of Croatian Jadran (MHJ) festival with Đorđe Novković&#x27;s song &#x27;Da si moj&#x27;. She also released a new album &quot;Ja samo pjevam&quot;, which returned her to the top of all charts and from which the song &#x27;Ante&#x27; stood out. Severina cut off her long hair and started wearing more provocative tops. Severina&#x27;s seventh studio album, &quot;Ja samo pjevam&quot; (&quot;I&#x27;m just singing&quot;), was a continuation of the pop sounds heard on her previous albums. It was released in 1999 by Croatia Records, It had a total of 10 songs. The composer of this album was Đorđe Novković with whom Severina started working on her next album. &quot;Ja samo pjevam&quot; is Severina&#x27;s best selling album till this day, with more than 55,000 copies sold only in Croatia. The album includes a cover of the song &quot;Dodirni mi kolena&quot; (&quot;Touch my knees&quot;) by Serbian group Zana. Four singles from the album &quot;Da si moj&quot; (&quot;If you were mine&quot;), &quot;Ante&quot;, &quot;Ja samo pjevam&quot; and &quot;Dodirni mi koljena&quot; were released. The album was not supported by an indoor tour, but on 6 July 2000, she held a solo concert at the Stadion Stari plac in Split in front of more than 20,000 people.

Following the success of her album &quot;Pogled ispod obrva&quot; (&quot;The Look Underneath the Eyebrows&quot;) which was released on 15 May 2001, Severina&#x27;s 2002 concert tour and live album &quot;Virujen u te&quot; (&quot;I Believe in You&quot;) won her an award for best selling live album along with a nomination for hit song of the year. Virujen u Te was her first major tour during which she performed in most of the big cities on the Balkans including Sarajevo, Bosnia and Herzegovina and Ljubljana, Slovenia and confirmed her status as one of the most popular Croatian music artists. In 2001, she performed again at the MHJ with the song ‘Ajde, ajde, zlato moje’, and at the end of the year she went on her third tour of Australia. She, along with Dorđe Novković, was the primary author on that album. With the song ‘Virujen u te’, she won the MHJ that same year and won the Grand Prix, and the album ‘Pogled ispod obrva’ became the best-selling album of her career. The album has sold over 30,000 copies in Croatia.

In 2002, she released the live album &quot;Virujen u te (najbolje uživo!)&quot;, which was later awarded the award for the best-selling live album. ‘Pogled ispod obrva’ was nominated for album of the year at the Porin discography award, and the song ‘Virujen u te’ for hit of the year.

===Career setbacks and Eurovision Song Contest 2006 (2003 - 2010)===

In 2004, Severina made headlines internationally because of a sex scandal, when a sex tape from 2002 featuring her and Herzegovinian Croat Milan Lučić, leaked on the internet. She said that her manager Tomislav Petrović was the first person to tell her the news and she though it was a lie. According to her, the video tape was stolen from her property. Milan Lučić was married at the time the video was released and Severina was engaged to Srećko Vargek. Severina was publicly scrutinised, and had to call-off the wedding to Srećko Vargek.

After a two-year break, she released her ninth studio album &quot;Severgreen&quot; in 2004. This was her first major project and public appearance after the sex-tape scandal which occurred in 2003. The album was influenced by jazz music. Severina also collaborated with Lana Jurčević on the song &quot;Rođena da budem prva&quot; (&quot;Born to be first&quot;). In 2006, she won the Dora competition with the song &quot;Moja štikla&quot; (&quot;My high-heel&quot;) and represented Croatia at the Eurovision Song Contest 2006 in Athens, Greece, finishing in 13th place. The song caused controversy in Croatia when several journalists and musicologists claimed the song resembled the music of Serbia. However, prominent Croatian ethno musicians such as Dunja Knebl and Lidija Bajuk disagreed, and both the song&#x27;s composer Boris Novković and Severina herself have claimed that the song includes Croatian folk music influences from the Dalmatian Hinterland such as ganga and rere singing and lijerica instrumentation. In 2007, she sang the song &quot;Gardelin&quot; for the film &quot;Rooster&#x27;s Breakfast&quot;. She got the role of Baroness Kasteli in the theater play &quot;Gospoda Glembajevi&quot;, where her acting skills met with conflicting comments.
After the contest, she started working on her tenth studio album together with Goran Bregović, one of the most successful music composers in the Balkans, and soon Severina&#x27;s long-anticipated tenth studio album &quot;Zdravo Marijo&quot; (&quot;Hail Mary&quot;) was released in May 2008 by Dallas Records The album had songs: &quot;Gas, gas&quot;, &quot;Pucajte u tamburaše&quot;, &quot;Muškarcu treba samo kurva&quot; (A man only needs a whore), &quot;Gade&quot; (Bastard), &quot;Da nisi možda gej&quot; (If you&#x27;re not maybe gay), &quot;Ljute cigare&quot; (Spicy cigars), &quot;Tridesete&quot; (Thirties), &quot;What does she have that I don&#x27;t&quot;, &quot;Hail, Mary&quot;. The author and producer is Goran Bregović, and the texts were written by Marina Tucaković and Ljilja Jorgovanović. In terms of sales, the album reached first place on charts in Croatia and Slovenia, where Severina was presented with a gold plaque. She started her self-titled tour in Zagreb, which she crowned with a performance in the Belgrade Arena in front of 20,000 people. After having made several public appearances wearing clothes depicting religious imagery (most notably a tight shirt with an image of Virgin Mary with Severina showing ample cleavage), some protested the abuse of religious elements, calling them offensive. However, the album achieved popularity and Severina released four more official music videos for the singles &quot;Tridesete&quot; (&quot;Thirties&quot;; cover of Sezen Aksu&#x27;s &quot;Kaçın Kurası&quot;), &quot;Gade&quot; (&quot;Bastard&quot;), &quot;Haljinica boje lila&quot; (&quot;Little Lilac Dress&quot;; Nikola Pejaković cover) and the title track. Following the release of the album, Severina went on her second major regional tour. On 15 December 2009, Severina was featured on Miligram&#x27;s song &quot;Lola&quot;, which was included on their self-titled debut album. In 2010, Severina started dating Serbian businessman Milan Popović, and in 2012 gave birth to their first child - a son Aleksandar. She gave birth in Split, and baptized him in Rijeka.

In 1999, Severina entered into a brief relationship with the Croatian model Adnan Taletović, whom she met while filming her &quot;Da si moj&quot; (&quot;If You Were Mine&quot;) music video. In 2000, while still in a relationship with Bosnian-Herzegovinian Croat general Stanko Sopta, she began an affair with Milan Lučić, a married businessman with whom she recorded a sex tape, which was leaked to the public in 2004. At the time of the tape&#x27;s release, Severina was reported to be in a relationship with Srećko Vargek, but the two soon broke up. Severina soon entered into a relationship with the economist Mate Čuljak. The relationship lasted a year and a half, but the couple broke up one week before Severina&#x27;s 35th birthday. Severina soon began dating sports entrepreneur Slavko Šainović. After two and a half years of dating, the couple broke up.

In December 2010, Severina met wealthy Serbian businessman Milan Popović at his birthday celebration, where she was hired to perform. They soon began dating, and in August 2011 she announced that she was pregnant with her first child. On 21 February 2012, she gave birth to a boy named Aleksandar in Split. During the period she lived between Belgrade, Vršac and Zagreb. In October 2012, Severina announced that she and Popović have separated and that she has moved back to Zagreb. At the same time it was announced she had her son baptized in a Catholic church in Rijeka. Several months later the couple reunited until separating for good in August 2013. Since then the couple have been embroiled in custody disputes, with Popović claiming he was not allowed access to see their son, a claim Severina denied.

On 22 November 2015, Severina married 15-year younger Serbian footballer Igor Kojić (son of Serbian Musician Dragan Kojić Keba) in Bale, Istria. Severina and Igor&#x27;s wedding deservedly won the title of wedding of the year because 50,000 euros were invested in it and they had 600 guests. The celebration was held at the &quot;Genex Impuls Hall&quot; hotel in New Belgrade, and the couple came to the &quot;stojadina&quot;. The song to which they played the first dance was &quot;Zlato moje&quot;, sung by Petar Grašo. The wedding was attended by a large number of people from the entertainment industry such as Lepa Brena, Rada Manojlović, Željko Joksimović, Nada Topčagić, Goran Karan, Džej Ramadanovski, Aca Lukas and others. After 6 years the couple formally divorced in Zagreb on 19 August 2021.

In 2013, she publicly supported the LGBT community in Croatia ahead of the 2013 Croatian constitutional referendum.

===Controverises===

On 25 August 2024, when scheduled to perform at a birthday party in Belgrade, Vučković was denied entry into Serbia on the Bajakovo border crossing. According to media and herself, she was denied entry due to her comments on the Srebrenica genocide which she made shortly after the United Nations designated 11 July as the annual International Day of Reflection and Commemoration of the 1995 Genocide in Srebrenica. Additionally, she claimed that Serbian police asked her about Operation Storm, Jasenovac and Franjo Tuđman. She blamed this incident on Aleksandar Vučić and his political regime and claimed that he was the one who prohibited her from entering Serbia. Shortly after news of the incident broke, she stated that she will never enter Serbia while Aleksandar Vučić is in power. Serbian Minister of Internal affairs Ivica Dačić later stated that she will be removed from their list of &quot;verbal offenders&quot;.

<doc id="736555" wikidata="Q841506" url="?curid=736555" title="Galleria Borghese">
<text>The is an art gallery in Rome, Italy, housed in the former Villa Borghese Pinciana. At the outset, the gallery building was integrated with its gardens, but nowadays the Villa Borghese gardens are considered a separate tourist attraction. The Galleria Borghese houses a substantial part of the Borghese Collection of paintings, sculpture and antiquities, begun by Cardinal Scipione Borghese, the nephew of Pope Paul V (reign 1605–1621). The building was constructed by the architect Flaminio Ponzio, developing sketches by Scipione Borghese himself, who used it as a &quot;villa suburbana&quot;, a country villa at the edge of Rome.

Scipione Borghese was an early patron of Bernini and an avid collector of works by Caravaggio, who is well represented in the collection by his &quot;Boy with a Basket of Fruit&quot;, &quot;St Jerome Writing&quot;, &quot;Sick Bacchus&quot; and others. Additional paintings of note include Titian&#x27;s &quot;Sacred and Profane Love&quot;, Raphael&#x27;s &quot;Entombment of Christ&quot; and works by Peter Paul Rubens and Federico Barocci.

==History==
The &quot;Casino Borghese&quot; was erected in an area that in the seventeenth-century was outside the walls of Rome, with the closest access being the Porta del Popolo. At the origins, the villa grounds covered an area with a circumference of nearly 3 miles. The main building was designed by the Flemish architect Giovanni Vasanzio. The portico had spolia derived from the Arch of Claudius, once on the Via Flaminia.

By 1644, John Evelyn described it as &quot;an Elysium of delight&quot; with &quot;Fountains of sundry inventions, Groves and small Rivulets of Water&quot;. Evelyn also described the &quot;Vivarium&quot; that housed ostriches, peacocks, swans and cranes &quot;and divers strange Beasts&quot;. Prince Marcantonio IV Borghese (1730–1800), who began the recasting of the park&#x27;s formal garden architecture into an English landscape garden, also set out about 1775, under the guidance of the architect Antonio Asprucci, to replace the now-outdated tapestry and leather hangings and renovate the &quot;Casina&quot;, restaging the Borghese sculptures and antiquities in a thematic new ordering that celebrated the Borghese position in Rome. The rehabilitation of the much-visited villa as a genuinely public museum in the late eighteenth century was the subject of an exhibition at the Getty Research Institute, Los Angeles, in 2000, spurred by the Getty&#x27;s acquisition of fifty-four drawings related to the project.

In 1808, Prince Camillo Borghese, Napoleon&#x27;s brother-in-law, was forced to sell the Borghese Roman sculptures and antiquities to the Emperor. The result is that the &quot;Borghese Gladiator&quot;, renowned since the 1620s as the most admired single sculpture in Villa Borghese, must now be appreciated in the Musée du Louvre. The &quot;Borghese Hermaphroditus&quot; is also now in the Louvre.

The Borghese villa was modified and extended down the years, eventually being sold to the Italian government in 1902, along with the entire Borghese estate and surrounding gardens and parkland.

==Collection==
The Galleria Borghese includes twenty rooms across two floors.

The main floor is mostly devoted to classical antiquities of the 1st–3rd centuries AD (including a famous 320–30 AD mosaic of gladiators found on the Borghese estate at Torrenova, on the Via Casilina outside Rome, in 1834), and classical and neo-classical sculpture such as the &quot;Venus Victrix&quot;.

The main floor&#x27;s main large hall, called the &quot;Salone&quot;, has a large &quot;trompe-l&#x27;œil&quot; ceiling fresco in the first room by the Sicilian artist Mariano Rossi makes such good use of foreshortening that it appears almost three-dimensional. The fresco depicts &quot;Marcus Furius Camillus relieving the siege of the Capitoline Hill by the Gauls&quot;. The grotteschi decorations were painted by Pietro Rotari, and the animal decorations by Venceslaus Peter Boemo.

The first hall off the Salone, is the Camera di Cerere, with marble vase depicting &quot;Oedipus and the Sphinx&quot;. The second hall has a ceiling frescoed by Francesco Caccianiga with the &quot;Fall of Phaeton&quot;. The third hall houses Bernini&#x27;s &quot;Apollo and Daphne&quot;.

===Gian Lorenzo Bernini at the Borghese===
Many of the sculptures are displayed in the spaces for which they were intended, including many works by Gian Lorenzo Bernini, which comprise a significant percentage of his output of secular sculpture, starting with early works such as the &quot;Goat Amalthea with Infant Jupiter and Faun&quot; (1615) and &quot;Aeneas, Anchises &amp; Ascanius&quot; (1618–19) to his dynamic &quot;Rape of Proserpine&quot; (1621–22), &quot;Apollo and Daphne&quot; (1622–25) and &quot;David&quot; (1623) which are considered seminal works of baroque sculpture. In addition, several portrait busts are included in the gallery, including one of Pope Paul V, and two portraits of one of his early patrons, &quot;Cardinal Scipione Borghese&quot; (1632). The second Scipione Borghese portrait was produced after a large crack was discovered in the marble of the first version during its creation.

=== Halls ===
*Porch and Entrance Hall: The entrance hall houses a Roman statue of Augustus, the Gladiator Mosaic, as well as the sculpture &quot;The Truth&quot; by Bernini;

*Hall I of Pauline: Its walls are decorated with original antique reliefs and others dating from the 18th and 19th centuries. It houses busts of Valadier (Bacchus, Hermes), and in its center, the famous sculpture by Canova &quot;Pauline Borghese as Venus Victrix&quot;, which gave its name to the room;

*Hall II of David: this hall is also called the &quot;Room of the Sun&quot; because of the painting on its vault representing the fall of Phaethon. The statue of &quot;David&quot; by Bernini stands at its centre. It also features Annibale Carracci&#x27;s &quot;Samson in Prison&quot;, as well as Greek sarcophagi from the 2nd century;

*Hall III of Apollo and Daphne: it houses Bernini&#x27;s sculpture &quot;Apollo and Daphne&quot;, also the theme of the painted vault at the end of the 18th century. The hall also houses Hellenistic and Roman sculptures, and works by the painter Dosso Dossi;

*Hall IV of the Emperors: this sumptuous hall decorated with stucco, marble, frescoes and paintings, owes its name of Gallery of the Emperors to its Roman busts displayed along the walls. Antonio Asprucci carried out its decoration from 1778 to 1780, mixing precious materials and using the most advanced techniques of the time. The wall niches house antique statues, including the &quot;Artemis Borghese&quot;, a Greek original from the 4th century. Two major works by Bernini, &quot;The Rape of Proserpina&quot; in marble, and &quot;Neptune with Dolphin&quot; in bronze, stand alongside the &quot;Farnese Bull&quot; by Antonio Susini. The two dodecagonal tables are by Luigi Valadier and the four white marble vases with the &quot;Seasons&quot; by Maximilien Laboureur (1739-1812). The Rape of Proserpina, the paragon urns by Lorenzo Nizza and the porphyry tables and cups date from the time of Cardinal Scipione Borghese. The ceiling canvases were painted by Domenico De Angelis, who took up the theme of the myth of Galatea. The Sienese artist Giovan Battista Marchetti (1730-1800) created the perspective architecture of grotesques that frame them. The frieze painted under the impost of the ceiling and the stucco reliefs on the walls are inspired by the theme of sea divinities. The hexagonal tiles on a blue micromosaic background, imitating the antique, were designed by Tommaso Conca. The Roman mosaic pilasters are influenced by Raphaelesque models. The marble ornamentation of the floor is in harmony with the trompe-l&#x27;oeil decorations of the ceiling;

*Hall V of the Hermaphroditu: &quot;The Sleeping Hermaphroditus&quot; is one of the 2 copies of the original bronze sculpture of Polykleitos. The sculpture was restored by Bernini who transformed its marble base into a mattress on which the character rests. Also, a Roman mosaic from the 2nd century representing a fishing scene;

*Hall VI of Aeneas and Anchises: It houses the marble statue of &quot;Aeneas and Anchises&quot;, a work of Bernini&#x27;s youth;

*Egyptian Hall VII: made between 1778 and 1782, this hall, which houses numerous sculptures, including a marble &quot;Faun on Dolphin&quot; from the Roman period, was designed by Antonio Asprucci. The decoration is inspired by Ancient Egypt and is a model of the taste of the time, which mixes archaeological rarities and exotic oddities. Tommasso Conca painted the ceiling, including the central canvas with &quot;Cybele pouring out gifts on Egypt&quot;, and the &quot;History of Antony and Cleopatra&quot; on the walls. The architectural ornaments on the ceiling are by Giovan Battista Marchetti. On the floor, three mosaic fragments depict mascarons of &quot;Ocean&quot; and other marine personifications; the mosaic Roman calendar dates from the first half of the 3th century;

*Silenus&#x27;s Hall VIII: during the rearrangement of the 18th century, Antonio Asprucci installed the group of Lysippus of &quot;Silenus carrying the infant Bacchus&quot; in the center of the hall, which then took the name of &quot;Room of Silenus&quot;. All the decoration was then arranged on the theme of Silenus. The canvas with the &quot;Sacrifice of Silenus&quot; painted by Tommaso Conca is on the ceiling, surrounded by the monumental architectures of Giovan Battista Marchetti. Since 1834, the &quot;Dancing Satyr&quot; has replaced the Lysippos group, now in the Louvre Museum This hall is known for containing six masterpieces by Caravaggio: &quot;Boy with a Basket of Fruit&quot;, &quot;Young Sick Bacchus&quot;, &quot;Madonna and Child with Saint Anne (Dei Palafrenieri)&quot;, &quot;David and the Head of Goliath&quot;, &quot;Saint Jerome&quot;, and finally &quot;Saint John the Baptist&quot;;

*Hall IX of Dido: It is entirely dedicated to Italian or foreign artists of the Renaissance, such as Pinturicchio, Bronzino, Raphael, Botticelli or Del Sarto. There are two &quot;tondi&quot;, one by Botticelli (&quot;Madonna and Child with Angels&quot;) and one by Fra Bartolomeo (&quot;Adoration of the Child&quot;), as well as two paintings by Raphael, including the &quot;Young Woman with Unicorn&quot;. Also, a &quot;Madonna and Child&quot; by Perugino;

*Hall X of Hercules (or Hall of Sleep): This room was called the Hall of Sleep until the end of the 18th century because of the presence of a sculpture representing the allegory of sleep. Its name was later changed to the Hercules Room because of the paintings on the vault depicting the Labors of Hercules. Works by Italian Mannerists cover the walls, such as the &quot;Portrait of a Man&quot; by Parmesan, or the &quot;Danaë&quot; by Correggio. The famous painting &quot;Venus and Cupid the Honey Thief&quot; by Cranach the Elder is also there;

*Hall XI of Ganymede: the &quot;Conversion of St Paul&quot; (1545), by Garofalo is kept there;

*Hall XII of the Bacchae: It houses a &quot;Portrait of a Gentleman&quot; by Lorenzo Lotto (1535), and a &quot;Holy Family&quot; by Sodoma (1510);

*Hall XIII of Celebrity

*Hall XIV Lanfranco Gallery: this gallery was originally an open loggia from which one could admire the gardens behind the villa. Closed at the end of the 18th century, the loggia was transformed into a gallery, on this occasion the fresco of the &quot;Council of the Gods&quot; by Giovanni Lanfranco was preserved. Several works by Bernini can be seen there, as well as the terracotta statue of Louis XIV. Numerous paintings from the 17th century cover the walls, including four &quot;tondi&quot; by L&#x27;Albane with mythological subjects, &quot;The Prodigal Son&quot; by Guercino, as well as a self-portrait by Bernini;

*Hall XV of Aurora: &quot;The Last Supper&quot; by Bassano (1546), one of the masterpieces of Mannerist painting;

*Hall XVI of Flora: &quot;The Coral Fishing&quot;, by Jacopo Zucchi (1580), a student of Vasari, is kept there;

*Hall XVII of Gualtieri of Antwerp: It presents works by Flemish painters, such as Francken the Younger (&quot;The Antiquarian&#x27;s Shop&quot;) or David Teniers the Younger (&quot;Drinker&quot;);

*Hall XVIII of Jupiter and Antiope: two of the most important works by Rubens: &quot;Susan and the Elders&quot; and &quot;Lamentation over the Dead Christ&quot;, are kept there;

*Hall XIX of Paris and Helen: five paintings on the vault illustrate the episodes of the Trojan prince Paris. Among the many paintings, we will remember those of Domenichino (&quot;Hunt of Diana&quot;, 1617), Annibale Carracci (&quot;Jupiter and Juno&quot;, 1602) and Giovanni Lanfranco (&quot;Norandino and Lucina surprised by the ogre&quot;, 1624);

*Hall XX of Psyche (or Hall of the Centaur): the ceiling from the 18th century represents the loves of Eros and Psyche. The room is dedicated to the great Venetian masters of the 15th and 16th centuries: Giorgione (&quot;Passionate chorister&quot;, 1507), Titian (the &quot;Sacred and Profane Love&quot;, 1514), Veronese, Carpaccio, Giovanni Bellini, Lorenzo Lotto, but also the Sicilian Antonello of Messina (&quot;Portrait of a Man&quot;, 1475).

<text>76 Freia is a very large main-belt asteroid. It orbits in the outer part of the asteroid belt and is classified as a Cybele asteroid. Its composition is very primitive and it is extremely dark in color. Freia was discovered by the astronomer Heinrich d&#x27;Arrest on 21 October 1862, in Copenhagen, Denmark. It was his first and only asteroid discovery. It is named after the goddess Freyja in Norse mythology.

The sidereal orbital period of this asteroid is commensurable with that of Jupiter, which made it useful for ground-based mass estimates of the giant planet. A shape model for the asteroid was published by Stephens and Warner (2008), based upon lightcurve data. This yielded a sidereal rotation period of . They found two possible solutions for the spin axis, with the preferred solution in ecliptic coordinates being (λ, β) = (, ).

<text>77 Frigga is a large, M-type, possibly metallic main-belt asteroid. It was discovered by the German-American astronomer C. H. F. Peters on November 12, 1862. The object is named after Frigg, the Norse goddess. The asteroid is orbiting the Sun with a period of 4.36 years and completes a rotation on its axis every nine hours.

Frigga has been studied by radar. The of this asteroid displays a feature at a wavelength of 3 μm, indicating the presence of hydrated minerals on the surface. The near infrared spectrum is reddish and shows no spectral absorption features. Potential analogs of this spectrum include enstatite chondrites and nickel-iron meteorites.

Since 1999 there have been four stellar occultations by the asteroid. The first three were single chord observations, and the fourth was a 3-chord observation, and a miss. The best fit ellipse measures 60.0 × 74.0 kilometres at PA -14degrees.

<doc id="736575" wikidata="Q1407528" url="?curid=736575" title="Feronia (mythology)">
<text>In Etruscan and Sabine religion, Feronia was a goddess associated with wildlife, fertility, health, and abundance, also venerated by the Faliscans and later adopted into ancient Roman religion. As the goddess who granted freedom to slaves or civil rights to the most humble part of society, she was especially honored among plebeians and freedmen. Her festival, the &quot;Feroniae&quot;, was November 13 (the &quot;ides&quot; of November) during the &quot;Ludi Plebeii&quot; (&quot;Plebeian Games&quot;), in conjunction with Fortuna Primigenia; both were goddesses of Praeneste.

:Note that the similar-sounding &quot;Feralia&quot; on February 21 is a festival of Jupiter Feretrius, not Feronia.

==Etymology==
Feronia&#x27;s name is derived from a Sabine adjective corresponding to Latin &quot;fĕrus&quot;, but with a long vowel, i.e. &quot;Fērōnǐa&quot;. The root &quot;fer&quot; has cognate words in every Indo-European language (e.g. Greek , , English &quot;feral&quot;.) Latin &quot;fĕrus&quot; means &quot;not cultivated, untamed&quot; (&quot;Thesaurus Linguae Latinae&quot;), &quot;of the field, wood&quot;, &quot;untamed&quot;, &quot;not mitigated by any cultivation&quot; (Forcellini &quot;Totius Latinitatis Lexicon&quot;) which fits the environment of the sanctuaries of Feronia and is very close to &quot;rudis&quot; (rude).

Feronia is one of the Roman and Italic goddesses whose name is formed by a root ending with the suffix &quot;-ona&quot; or &quot;-onia&quot;. This form of a noun denotes a difficult or dangerous state or condition: The deity is a sovereign of that danger, only to help man to best avoid damage or get the greatest advantage, such as Angerona for the &quot;angusti dies&quot; near the winter solstice.

==Myths and functions==
Many versions of Feronia&#x27;s cult have been supposed, and it is not quite clear if she was only one goddess or if she had only one function in ancient times. Some Latins believed Feronia to be a harvest goddess, and honoured her with the harvest firstfruits in order to secure a good harvest the following year.

Festus&#x27;s entry on the &quot;picus Feronius&quot;
of Trebula Mutuesca testifies the goddess had also prophetic qualities among the Sabines, as did the &quot;picus martius&quot; of Tiora Matiena ascribed to the Aborigines. Feronia also served as a goddess of travellers, fire, and waters.

===Freedmen and Libertas===
Varro identified Feronia with Libertas, the goddess who personified Liberty.
According to Servius, Feronia was a tutelary goddess of freedmen (&quot;dea libertorum&quot;). A stone at the Terracina shrine was inscribed &quot;let deserving slaves sit down so that they may stand up free.&quot; Livy notes that in 217  freed women collected money as a gift for Feronia. 
Some sources state that slaves were set free at her temple near Terracina.

===Sabine tribal matron===
She was among the deities that Sabine moneyers placed on their coins to honor their heritage. She may have been introduced into Roman religious practice when Manius Curius Dentatus conquered Sabinum in the early 3rd century .

===Insistence on wild places===
Two stories about her sanctuary of Terracina highlight the character of Feronia as goddess of the wilderness: Servius writes that when a fire destroyed her wood and the locals were about moving the statues to another location, the burnt wood suddenly turned green.

Pliny states that all attempts at building towers in times of war between Terracina and the sanctuary of Feronia have been abandoned because all are without exception destroyed by lightning.
The goddess thus refused any continuity and linkage with the nearby town.

===Role in the Aeneid===
In Vergil&#x27;s &quot;Aeneid&quot;, troops from Feronia&#x27;s grove fight on the side of Turnus against Aeneas. The Arcadian king Evander recalls how in his youth he killed a son of Feronia, Erulus, who like Geryon had a triple body and a triple soul; Evander thus had to kill him three times.
Vergil identifies Erulus as the king of Praeneste, but he is otherwise unknown in literature.

===Dumézil&#x27;s interpretation===
Dumézil considers Feronia to be a goddess of wilderness, of untamed nature, and of nature&#x27;s vital forces – but honoured because she offers the opportunity to put those forces to good use in acquiring nurture, health, and fertility. She fecundates and heals, and therefore despite her being worshipped only in the wild, she receives the first-fruits of the harvest. Because she permits the people to domesticate the wild forces of vegetation, she could be seen as favouring the transformation of that which is uncouth into that which is cultivated.

Dumézil compares her to Vedic god Rudra: He and Feronia are similar in that Rudra represents that which has not yet been transformed by civilization – he is the god of the &quot;rude&quot;, of the jungle; at one time dangerous and uniquely useful: Healer, thanks to the herbs within his domain, protector of the freed slaves and of the outcast. Feronia, though, has only the positive or useful function of putting the forces of wild nature at the service of the people.

==Cult and cult sites==
Inscriptions to Feronia are found mostly in central Italy. Feronia&#x27;s shrines were all located in the wild, far from human settlements. Varro, however, places Feronia in his list of Sabine gods who had altars in Rome.

Feronia&#x27;s cults at Aquileia and Terracina were near springs that were used in her rites. The Augustan poet Horace speaks of the water &quot;(lympha)&quot; of Feronia, in which &quot;we bathe our face and hands.&quot;

===Capena, Etruria===
Her &quot;lucus&quot; at Capena was a place where everybody was allowed to come for worship and trade, attracting people from different nations, Sabines, Latins, Etruscans, and others from even farther away. The grove provided everybody with a neutral territory in which peace must not be perturbed.

Feronia&#x27;s temple at the base of Mt. Soracte which was near Capena. The &quot;Lucus Feroniae&quot;, or &quot;grove of Feronia&quot; (Fiano Romano) was the site of an annual festival in her honour,
which was in the nature of a trade fair.
The place, in the territory of Capena in southwestern Etruria, was plundered of its gold and silver by Hannibal&#x27;s retreating troops in 211 , when he turned aside from the Via Salaria to visit the sanctuary; later it became an Augustan &quot;colonia&quot;. Its status as a colony is recorded in a single inscription, copied in a manuscript of the rule of the Farfa Abbey as &quot;colonia Iulia Felix Lucoferonensis&quot;.

===Anxur, Terracina===
Another important site was near Anxur (Terracina, southern Latium), in a wood three Roman miles from the town, where Servius recorded a joint cult of &quot;the boy Jupiter&quot; (&quot;puer Iuppiter&quot;) under the name of Anxyrus and &quot;Juno the Virgin&quot; (&quot;Iuno virgo&quot;), whom he identifies as Feronia. According to another tradition, slaves who had just been freed might go to the shrine at Terracina and receive upon their shaved heads the &quot;pileus&quot;, a hat that symbolized their liberty.

===Campus Martius, Rome===
Her temple in the Campus Martius, in what is now Largo di Torre Argentina, was probably also located in a grove, according to an inscription found on the site.
It was established before 217 BCE. It may have been dedicated by Curtius Dentatus following his victory over the Sabines. His building program also included the Anio Vetus, a major new aqueduct, and a number of fountains near the temple.

===Late continuation===
Charles Godfrey Leland reported surviving traditions of the &quot;witch&quot; Feronia in 19th century Tuscany.

==Namesakes==
The asteroid 72 Feronia is named for her.

<text>Feronia () is the name of a mysterious ancient site (now disappeared) near the town of Posada (Sardinia, Italy), which was in Ptolemy&#x27;s maps and following until the Middle Ages.

It is supposed that, due to the peculiar character and history of the territory, the place was named after the Roman (or Etruscan) goddess.

Due to a few archaeological findings, recent studies tend to identify the site (and an eventual sacred area) in the Posada suburb of Santa Caterina, but a relevant group of opponents prefer to consider it was near the &quot;Portus Luguidonis&quot; (a Roman harbour), at San Giovanni di Posada. This second theory is also based on the fact that a port would have had a reason for being included in a nautical map, while a simple sacred area (and Sardinia has really many of them) would have not been so important for the sailors of that age.

<text>78 Diana is a large and dark main-belt asteroid. It was discovered by German astronomer Robert Luther on March 15, 1863, and named after Diana, Roman goddess of the hunt. The asteroid is orbiting the Sun at a distance of with a period of 4.24 years and an eccentricity (ovalness) of 0.207. The orbital plane is tilted at an angle of 8.688° relative to the plane of the ecliptic. Its composition is carbonaceous and primitive.

Photometric observations of this asteroid during 1986 and 2006–08 gave a light curve with a rotation period of 7.2991 hours and a brightness variation in the range 0.02–0.104 magnitude. Based upon radar data, the near surface solid density of the asteroid is 2.7. 78 Diana occulted a star on September 4, 1980. A diameter of 116 km was measured, closely matching the value given by the IRAS satellite.

Diana is expected to pass about from (29075) 1950 DA on August 5, 2150. Main-belt asteroid 4217 Engelhardt (~9 km in diameter) will pass about from (29075) 1950 DA in 2736.

<text>Sir Richard Quain, 1st Baronet, (30 October 1816 – 13 March 1898) was an Irish physician.

==Life==
He was born at Mallow-on-the-Blackwater, County Cork, and died in Harley Street, London.

Quain was the eldest child of John Quain of Carraig Dhúin (Carrigoon), Cork and Mary, daughter of Michael Burke of Mallow, Cork. He was sent to the Diocesan School at Cloyne for his early education and then, aged 15, apprenticed to the surgeon-apothecary Fraser in Limerick for five years. In 1837 he enrolled in medicine at the University College London where his cousins, Jones Quain, the anatomist and author of &quot;Quain&#x27;s Elements of Anatomy&quot;, and Richard Quain, FRCS, later the president of the Royal College of Surgeons, held teaching posts. He graduated M.B. with honours in 1840. 

He married Isabella Agnes Wray (21 Jun 1828 - 26 Oct 1891), the daughter of George Wray, on 31 January 1854 at Hampstead. He was a great-grandfather of author Ian Fleming.

==Career==

Quain received his early education at Cloyne, and was then apprenticed to a surgeon-apothecary in Limerick. 
In 1837, he entered University College London, where he graduated as M.B. with honours in 1840, and as MD (gold medal) in 1842. 
Six years later, he was chosen to be an assistant-physician to the Brompton Hospital for Diseases of the Chest. He retained his connection with that institution until his death, first as full physician (1855), and subsequently as consulting physician (1875).

In 1842, he received the gold medal for achievements in physiology and comparative anatomy, and later he became successively house surgeon and house physician at the University College Hospital and commenced practice in London, being in particular a protégé of professor Charles James Blasius Williams (1805–1889). 
He soon had a busy practice, numbering an important clientele, with contacts to the most highly recognised persons.

In 1848, Quain was appointed assistant physician at the Brompton Hospital for Diseases of the Chest. He was raised to full physician in 1855 and was made consulting physician in 1875. He held the same rank at the Seamen&#x27;s Hospital, Greenwich, and the Royal Hospital for Consumption in Ventnor.

In 1846, Quain became a member of the Royal College of Physicians and a fellow in 1851. 
In 1850, he vacated the Chair of Anatomy at the University College London and was succeeded by George Viner Ellis. In 1862 he served as a member of the council of the Royal College of Physicians, 1867 censor, 1877 senior censor. He was an early member of the Pathological Society of London in 1862, being elected its president in 1869. He was also a fellow and vice-president of the Royal Medical and Chirurgical Society and the Medical Society of London, as well as President of the Harveian Society of London (1853) and fellow of the Royal Statistical Society. 
He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1871. 
His address to the Society was &quot;On the mechanism by which the first sound of heart is produced&quot;.

He became a fellow of the Royal College of Physicians in 1851, and filled almost every post of honour it could offer, except the presidency, in the contest for which he was beaten by Sir Andrew Clark in 1888. 
In 1881, he was asked by Queen Victoria to attend prime minister Benjamin Disraeli during his last few days. 
He later, in 1890, became physician-extraordinary to the Queen, and was created a baronet of Harley Street in the County of London and of Carrigoon in Mallow in the County of Cork, in the following year.

He sat on the Royal Commission on Rinderpest (cattle plague) in 1865.

Quain was the author of several memoirs, dealing for the most part with disorders of the heart, but his name will be best remembered by the &quot;Dictionary of Medicine&quot;, the preparation of which occupied him from 1875 to 1882 (2nd edition, 1894; 3rd, 1902).

Quain&#x27;s article on fatty disease of the heart was published in 1850, but probably his major contribution was his editorship the multi-authored textbook of medicine, Quain&#x27;s &quot;Dictionary of Medicine&quot;, which became the bible of all medical practitioners in the United Kingdom. 
It was published in 1882 after seven years of meticulous preparation by Quain. The work filled a gap in contemporary medical writing and sold over 30,000 copies; a second edition followed in 1894.

Quain was very prominent in affairs of medicine, being a censor and council member of the Royal College of Physicians and was narrowly defeated by Sir Andrew Clark in 1888 in the election for the position of president. He became physician-extraordinary to Queen Victoria in 1890 and was created a baronet in the following year.

He was active on many committees but probably the most important of these contributions was the Royal Commission to enquire into the nature and causes and methods of prevention of cattle plague. This commission included a number of famous people such as Henry Bence Jones (1813–1873) and Edmond Alexander Parkes (1819–1876). Quain vehemently sided with the section that wanted the extermination of the plague at any price and was opposed in this by a number of the members of the commission, including Bence Jones. Quain&#x27;s work and particularly letters he wrote to newspapers and magazines turned the tide and the recommendations to exterminate were carried out with success.

Appointed a Crown nominee in 1863, Quain became chairman of its Pharmacopoeia Committee in 1874 and took a major part in the preparation of the Additions to the British Pharmacopoeia of 1867 (1874) and of the British Pharmacopoeias of 1885 and 1898. He was chosen as a member of the Senate of London University in 1860 and was one of the organisers of the Brown Institution.

Quain was regarded universally as a fine physician, but apparently achieved his results by intuition and instinct rather than by analysis of the patient&#x27;s problems. &quot;Utility and progress&quot; was his favourite motto. Quain&#x27;s renown as a physician was due not only to the sound commonsense that he brought to bear in diagnosis, but also to the good-humoured geniality that he showed to patients and friends,

He was famous for his epigrammatic quotes, and regarded as a fine raconteur and club member of the Garrick and Athenaeum, his broad Irish accent adding colour to the stories he told.

<text>80 Sappho (symbol: )is a large, S-type (stony) main-belt asteroid. It was discovered by English astronomer Norman Pogson on 2 May 1864, and is named after Sappho, the Archaic Greece poet. The asteroid is orbiting the Sun at a distance of with a period of 3.48 years and an eccentricity (ovalness) of 0.2. The orbital plane is inclined at an angle of 8.68° to the plane of the ecliptic.

13-cm radar observations of this asteroid from the Arecibo Observatory between 1980 and 1985 were used to produce a diameter estimate of . Hanuš et al. (2013) confirmed the polar axis has ecliptic coordinates = and listed a rotation period of 14.03087 h.

Sappho (at apparent magnitude 11.8) occulted the magnitude 7.2 star HIP 24403 in the constellation of Taurus on 16 September 2018 at 8:54 UT. Sacramento and Salt Lake City were the two major cities located underneath the shadow path. Data from this event will help improve the shape model of the asteroid. During the occultation the asteroid was roughly from Earth with an uncertainty of ±76 km.

<text>Claudia Brücken (born 7 December 1963) is a German singer and songwriter. She was the lead vocalist of the synth-pop band Propaganda for many years.

In 1996, Brücken started working with Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark co-founder Paul Humphreys, first without a name, and from 2004 as Onetwo. In March 2013, Brücken and Humphreys ceased working and living together, and she has subsequently returned to pursuing her solo career.

==Early career==
At age 14, Brücken joined her first band, Haarsträubend. Her second band was the all-female &quot;The Tripolinas&quot; together with Susanne Freytag, who also became a member of the band Propaganda.

==Propaganda==
In 1983, Brücken joined the German band Propaganda and relocated to London when they signed with ZTT Records. Propaganda had two UK top 30 hit singles with &quot;Dr Mabuse&quot; (1984) and &quot;Duel&quot; (1985). On 14 February 1985, Brücken married British music journalist Paul Morley, who was one of the founders of the ZTT label. In July 1985, the first Propaganda album &quot;A Secret Wish&quot; was released. While promoting their first album and writing songs for a new album, internal tensions rose within the group. This was mainly attributed to the relationship between Brücken and Morley, and the profitless contract the band had signed with ZTT. In 1986, Propaganda left ZTT, and Brücken left Propaganda to stay with ZTT.

==Act and solo career==
She joined Thomas Leer to form Act, who in 1988 released their only album &quot;Laughter, Tears and Rage&quot;. In 1991 she released a solo album &quot;&quot; for Island Records. In the United Kingdom two singles were released from this album &quot;Absolut(e)&quot; in 1990, and &quot;Kiss Like Ether&quot; in 1991. Throughout the rest of the 90s, Brücken concentrated mainly on motherhood (she has a daughter, Maddy, and a son, Daniel, with Paul Morley) and made some guest performances on albums of other artists. She had met Paul Humphreys (of OMD) in the early 1980s but it was in 1996 when the pair became close, as she was working on songs for a possible second solo album.

==Propaganda reunion==

In 1998, Brücken joined the part-reunion of Propaganda (in which founder Ralf Dörper, see also Die Krupps, did not take part) and they began working on new material. Several tracks were completed as demos, including a snippet of a video. A preview of this video was released via the band&#x27;s official website in early 2000, however, the reunion fell apart and no album materialized, although nine songs were leaked to the internet. Two of these were later released as Onetwo songs: &quot;Cloud Nine&quot;, co-written by Martin Gore of Depeche Mode, and &quot;Anonymous&quot;.

The original four-piece including founder Ralf Dörper performed together at the Trevor Horn Prince&#x27;s Trust extravaganza which took place at the Wembley Arena in 2004. Another attempt at a band reunion failed in 2010.

==2000–2018==
At the end of 2000, Brücken and Humphreys undertook a short tour of the United States as &quot;Paul Humphreys of OMD: OMD Revisited&quot;. The tour started in Salt Lake City, and they performed songs from OMD and Propaganda, but also some new songs they had written. As Onetwo, in June 2004 the pair became the first established artists to release new material exclusively on eBay with a 5-track EP format called &quot;Item&quot;. Onetwo made their live debut in September 2004 at the Carling Academy at Islington.

A collaboration between Brücken and pianist Andrew Poppy resulted in the album &quot;Another Language&quot; in 2005. On this album, they performed songs of other artists with just vocals and piano/guitar.

Onetwo finally released their debut album &quot;Instead&quot; on 26 February 2007, and performed some gigs in April 2007. They also supported Erasure and The Human League in the second half of 2007.

Her vocals can be heard in the hit 2011 video game &quot;L.A. Noire&quot;, as the singing voice of lounge singer, German immigrant and the main character&#x27;s love interest Elsa Lichtmann.

In 2011, Brücken released &quot;Combined&quot;, which contained eight previously released tracks and four new ones, including her duet with Andy Bell of Erasure and two tracks from Onetwo. She also did a duet with Paul Rutherford of Frankie Goes To Hollywood singing &quot;This Is Not America&quot; a song written by David Bowie and Pat Metheny for the soundtrack of the movie &quot;The Falcon and the Snowman&quot;.

In March 2011, Brücken performed at the Scala, Kings Cross, London. She performed a selection of songs from her work with Propaganda, Act, Andrew Poppy, OneTwo and several numbers from her solo career. She was joined onstage by a variety of guests including Paul Humphreys, Glenn Gregory, Martyn Ware, Andrew Poppy, Susanne Freytag, Ralf Dörper and Andy Bell. The concert was called &#x27;This Time: It&#x27;s Claudia Brücken&#x27;. The concert was recorded and released on 23 July 2012 as a CD/DVD entitled &quot;This Happened: Live at the Scala&quot;, and was produced by Paul Humphreys and Martin Gooch who also directed.

On 6 November 2012, Brücken released a new CD/vinyl set entitled &quot;The Lost Are Found&quot;, a collection of &quot;lost&quot; songs from artists such as the Pet Shop Boys, Julee Cruise and The Band, whose second album &quot;The Band&quot; contains &quot;Whispering Pines&quot; which lends the album its title. A video for &quot;Whispering Pines&quot; was released as the album&#x27;s first single in December.

Brücken played live in the UK in March 2013. Germany tour dates were postponed after an announcement on 7 March reporting that Paul Humphreys would have to withdraw from the original dates.

In October 2014, Brücken released a new solo album, entitled &quot;Where Else...&quot; (Cherry Red), a collaboration with co-writer and producer John Williams.

==2018–present: xPropaganda==
For two nights in March 2018, Brücken, along with Propaganda bandmate Susanne Freytag, performed the Propaganda album &quot;A Secret Wish&quot; in its entirety at The Garage in London under the name X-Propaganda. By 2021 the duo of Brücken and Freytag decided that their band&#x27;s name would be now styled as xPropaganda, with the duo recording a new album with producer Stephen Lipson called &quot;The Heart Is Strange&quot;. In February 2022, Universal Music announced that it would release &quot;The Heart Is Strange&quot; on the ZTT Label in May, a label the original line-up of Propaganda had signed to in the 1980s. &quot;The Heart Is Strange&quot; features the tracks &quot;The Night&quot;, &quot;Don&#x27;t (You Mess With Me)&quot; and &quot;No Ordinary Girl&quot;, with xPropaganda scheduled to play it live in 2022, with a line-up including Brücken, Freytag and Lipson. The album reached #11 on the UK charts, a higher position than the original Propaganda achieved forty years earlier.

<text>El Fuerte () is a city and El Fuerte Municipality its surrounding municipality in the northwestern Mexican state of Sinaloa. The city population reported in the 2010 census was 12,566 people.

El Fuerte, meaning &quot;The Fort&quot;, was given a Pueblo Mágico (&quot;Magical Town&quot;) touristic label in 2009, due to its many attractions, its historical importance and its appealing small-town colonial aura.

==History==
The city was founded in 1563 by the Spanish conquistador Francisco de Ibarra, the first European explorer of the lofty Sierra Madre Occidental mountains. In 1610 a fort was built to ward off the fierce Zuaque and Tehueco Native Americans, who constantly harassed the Spaniards. For years, El Fuerte served as the gateway to the vast frontiers of the northern territories of Sonora, Arizona and California, all of which were sparsely populated by unyielding tribes of native amerindians. 
For nearly three centuries it was the most important commercial and agricultural center of the vast northwestern region of Mexico. El Fuerte was a chief trading post for silver miners and gold seekers from the Urique and Batopilas mines in the nearby mountains of the Sierra Madre Occidental and its branches. 
In 1824, El Fuerte became the capital city of the newly created Mexican state of Sonora y Sinaloa (reaching up deep into modern-day Arizona). It remained the capital for several years until the split of this state into the states of Sinaloa and Sonora.

== Tourism ==
Tourism remains a major industry in town, although it has been diminished in recent years by tourists being wary of Mexican drug cartel violence in other parts of Sinaloa; however, violence declined by 2013 from a high in 2011. El Fuerte has several holidays and local &quot;Fiestas&quot; which are celebrated with pageants, &quot;Ferias&quot; and the like. Several hotels cater to hunters and fishermen, who hunt (deer, boar, wild hog, wild goat, rabbit, armadillo, a variety of snakes) in the foothills or fish in the nearby Rio Fuerte river which runs on the northwest part of the town&#x27;s commercial district. There are also local petroglyphs a short distance from the downtown. The city also serves as a gateway to the popular Barrancas del Cobre (Copper Canyon) situated in the nearby state of Chihuahua. There are no easily travelled roads to Copper Canyon from west of the Sierra Madre Occidental.

==Transportation==
===Passenger train===
Many visitors take the Ferrocarril Chihuahua al Pacífico railway, whose local station is a few miles south of town. The route is on the Chihuahua-Pacific Railroad, or ChePe, which passes through the scenic Copper Canyon, from Chihuahua, Chihuahua to the northeast, to Los Mochis, Sinaloa, near the Gulf of California, to the southwest.


===Aviation===

The town is also served by El Fuerte Airport.

<text>Dagmar Krause (born 4 June 1950) is a German singer, best known for her work with avant-rock groups including Slapp Happy, Henry Cow, and Art Bears. She is also noted for her coverage of songs by Bertolt Brecht, Kurt Weill and Hanns Eisler. Her unusual singing style makes her voice instantly recognisable and has defined the sound of many of the bands with whom she has worked.

==Biography==

===Bands and projects===

Dagmar Krause was born in Hamburg, West Germany on 4 June 1950. She began her professional career at the age of 14 as a singer in Hamburg clubs on the Reeperbahn. In 1968 she was invited to join the , a contemporary folk/protest group she once half-jokingly described as a German version of The Mamas &amp; the Papas. She contributed vocals to their 1968 album &quot;Der Kürbis, das Transportproblem und die Traumtänzer&quot; (&quot;The Pumpkin, the Problem of Transport and the Dream-dancers&quot;), a spin-off from a German TV show. The City Preachers broke up in 1969, but their lead singer Inga Rumpf and Krause reunited in 1970 to record &quot;I.D. Company&quot;, the name of a studio project where each vocalist sung lead on and determined the direction of one side of the LP (Krause&#x27;s side indicated her future direction with its avant-garde slant).

Hamburg had a thriving avant-garde scene that attracted numerous European musicians interested in pursuing aesthetic freedom and experimental music. It was here that Krause met, and later married, British experimental composer Anthony Moore. In 1972, Moore, Krause, and Moore&#x27;s visiting American friend, singer-songwriter Peter Blegvad, formed Slapp Happy, a self-described &quot;naive rock&quot; group which mixed simple pop structures with obfuscatory lyrics drawing equally from semiotic and symbolist traditions. Slapp Happy was the beginning of Krause&#x27;s international musical career. They recorded two albums in Germany for Polydor with Faust as their backing band, &quot;Sort Of&quot; (1972) and what subsequently became known as &quot;Acnalbasac Noom&quot; (not released at the time). Then they moved to London where they recorded a new arrangement of &quot;Acnalbasac Noom&quot; for Virgin Records, released as &quot;Slapp Happy&quot;, also known as &quot;Casablanca Moon&quot; (1974). The original &quot;Acnalbasac Noom&quot; only saw the light of day in 1980 when it was released by Recommended Records.

In 1974, Slapp Happy merged with Virgin label-mates Henry Cow, a politically oriented avant-rock group, and they made two albums, &quot;Desperate Straights&quot; (1974) and &quot;In Praise of Learning&quot; (1975). But differences in approach caused Moore and Blegvad to withdraw Slapp Happy from the merger. Krause, however, elected to remain with Henry Cow, which led to the end of Slapp Happy.

Krause&#x27;s singing added a new dimension to Henry Cow&#x27;s repertoire and their tricky time signatures enhanced her vocal powers. Henry Cow toured Europe for two years, during which time they released a live album &quot;Concerts&quot; (1976) which included Krause singing duos with Robert Wyatt. But in May 1976 she was forced to withdraw from Henry Cow&#x27;s hectic tour schedule due to ill health and returned to Hamburg. In October 1977, still unable to tour she left Henry Cow, but agreed to sing on their next studio album &quot;Hopes and Fears&quot;.

&quot;Hopes and Fears&quot; began in 1978 as a Henry Cow album but differences of opinion in the group about its content resulted in it being credited to Art Bears, a new band consisting of Krause, Chris Cutler and Fred Frith. Art Bears went on to make two more albums of songs, &quot;Winter Songs&quot; (1979) and &quot;The World as It Is Today&quot; (1981).

Kevin Coyne worked with her on the 1979 album &quot;Babble&quot;, with Virgin Records. At the stage presentation, Coyne suggested that the lovers&#x27; destructive relationship could have echoed The Moors Murderers. Negative publicity in &quot;The Sun&quot; and &quot;The Evening Standard&quot; resulted in short-notice cancellation of two performances at the Theatre Royal Stratford East by Newham Council. The show was put on at Oval House in Kennington for four nights. Reviewing the show for the &quot;NME&quot;, Paul Du Noyer wrote:

In 1983, Krause joined a new band News from Babel, featuring core members Krause, Chris Cutler, Lindsay Cooper and Zeena Parkins. They recorded two albums &quot;Work Resumed on the Tower&quot; (1984) and &quot;Letters Home&quot; (1985). After News from Babel, Krause was involved in a number of projects and collaborations. She performed on the Michael Nyman/Paul Richards art song, &quot;The Kiss&quot; with Omar Ebrahim on the Michael Nyman Band album &quot;The Kiss and Other Movements&quot; (1985). She also featured on &quot;Music for Other Occasions&quot; (1986) with Lindsay Cooper, &quot;Domestic Stories&quot; (1992) with Chris Cutler and Lutz Glandien, &quot;Each in Our Own Thoughts&quot; (1994) with Tim Hodgkinson, and &quot;A Scientific Dream and a French Kiss&quot; (1998) with Marie Goyette.

In 1984, Krause sang backing vocals on &quot;Here &amp; There&quot; by The Stranglers. The song appeared on the b-side of their single, &quot;Skin Deep&quot;. It was subsequently added to the 2001 remastered edition of the parent album, &quot;Aural Sculpture&quot;.

In 1991, Krause, Moore and Blegvad reunited to work on a &quot;Camera&quot; (Italian for &quot;Room&quot;) a specially written television opera, made by the UK production company After Image and commissioned by Channel 4 Television. It was based on an original idea by Krause, with words by Blegvad and music by Moore. Krause played the lead character &quot;Melusina&quot; and the opera was broadcast two years later on Channel 4. Slapp Happy reformed briefly in 1997 to record &quot;Ça Va&quot; and they toured Japan in 2000.

In 2010, Krause joined Comicoperando, a tribute to the music of Robert Wyatt whose line-up has included Richard Sinclair, Annie Whitehead, Gilad Atzmon, Alex Maguire, Chris Cutler, John Edwards, Michel Delville, Karen Mantler and Cristiano Calcagnile.

Krause, Moore and Blegvad reformed Slapp Happy again in November 2016 to perform with Faust at the Week-End festival in Cologne, Germany. The two groups also played together on 10–11 February 2017 at Cafe Oto in London. On 24 February 2017 Slapp Happy, without Faust, performed at Mt. Rainier Hall, Shibuya in Tokyo.

Krause contributed vocals to two albums by Matthew Edwards and the Unfortunates &quot;Folklore&quot; (2017) and &quot;The Birmingham Poets&quot; (2019).

===Solo work===
Krause&#x27;s fascination with Weimar-era cabaret and her love for the work of playwright Bertolt Brecht and his musical collaborators Kurt Weill and Hanns Eisler produced some of her most satisfying work. In 1978 she starred in a London art-theatre production of the Brecht and Weill play &quot;Rise and Fall of the City of Mahagonny&quot;, and in 1985 she sang Brecht and Weill&#x27;s &quot;Surabaya Johnny&quot; on the Hal Willner-produced &quot;Lost in the Stars: The Music of Kurt Weill&quot;. John Dougan wrote at AllMusic that Krause&#x27;s &quot;elegant alto was perfectly suited to the emotionally and politically charged music of Brecht and Weill&quot;.

In 1986, Krause made two solo albums: &quot;Supply and Demand: Songs by Brecht/Weill and Eisler&quot; and &quot;Tank Battles: The Songs of Hanns Eisler&quot;. These albums were also sung in German and released as &quot;Angebot und Nachfrage&quot; and &quot;Panzerschlacht: Die Lieder von Hanns Eisler&quot;. Lyrically they continued the trend of earlier songs of social conscience Krause had performed, for example on Henry Cow&#x27;s &quot;Living in the Heart of the Beast&quot;. &quot;Supply and Demand&quot; and &quot;Tank Battles&quot; are seen by many as Krause&#x27;s best work, while the latter is considered to be one of the finest interpretations of Eisler&#x27;s work. She performed selections from these albums live at various venues, most notably the Edinburgh Festival, which was documented on &quot;Voiceprint Radio Sessions&quot; (1993).

===Singing style===

As a vocalist, Krause has been described by some as an acquired taste. Her singing style is highly original and idiosyncratic. Her &quot;husky, vibrato-laden alto&quot; voice can range from a sweet melodious croon to the love-it-or-hate-it Armageddon style typified on albums like Henry Cow&#x27;s &quot;In Praise of Learning&quot;. Part of the intrigue of Krause&#x27;s singing are her German-inflected vocals, &quot;... but whether she sings in German or English (which she often does on the same record), she retains her impeccable phrasing and ability to inject the most oft-heard lyric with almost palpable emotion.&quot;

In a review of &quot;The 40th Anniversary Henry Cow Box Set&quot; (2009), critic John Kelman at &quot;All About Jazz&quot;, wrote that &quot;the kinds of intervallic leaps and harmonic sophistication required of a singer [in Henry Cow] make Krause an undervalued and underrated singer in this history of modern music.&quot;

<text>Tiger Temple, or Wat Pha Luang Ta Bua Yanasampanno (วัดป่าหลวงตาบัว ญาณสัมปันโน), was a Theravada Buddhist temple in the Sai Yok District of Thailand&#x27;s Kanchanaburi Province in the west of the country. It was founded in 1994 as a forest temple and sanctuary for wild animals, among them tigers, mostly Indochinese tigers. A &quot;commercial&quot; temple, Tiger Temple charged an admission fee.

The temple has been accused by animal rights activists of mistreating the tigers for commercial gain and even trafficking some of its animals, though in 2005 it was cleared of allegations of animal mistreatment in an investigation by wildlife officials and a raid by Thai soldiers. Charges were pressed for unlicensed possession of 38 protected birds found on the temple grounds.

In May 2016, the Thailand Wildlife Conservation Office (WCO) began capturing and relocating the tigers, intending to close the facility. Authorities counted 137 tigers on the premises, and the frozen bodies of 40 cubs, some of them dead for more than five years.

== The tigers ==


In 1999, the temple received its first tiger cub, one that had been found by villagers. It died soon after. Later, several tiger cubs were given to the temple. As of January 2016, the number of tigers confined at the temple exceeded 150.

The original eight tigers brought to the temple were rescues, and thus far DNA data is incomplete and therefore unavailable to the public, as the pedigree of the tigers is not entirely known. However, it is presumed that they are Indochinese tigers, except Mek, a Bengal tiger. It is possible that some may be the newly discovered Malayan tigers, as well as cross breeds or hybrids.

== Issues, reports, and controversy ==

Critics charged that the Tiger Temple is a criminal organization. An NGO, Care for the Wild International, in a 2008 report that the Tiger Temple is involved in the illegal wildlife trade with a facility in Laos and breeds tigers without a proper license.

According to Edwin Wiek, founder of Wildlife Friends of Thailand, the temple&#x27;s operations violate CITES, an international treaty on wildlife to which Thailand is a signatory, which bans commercial breeding of protected wild animals such as tigers. All previous attempts by authorities to remove the tigers from Wat Pha Luang Ta Bua Yanasampanno have failed, including one in May 2015. Wiek believes this is due to the influence wielded by the temple and its abbot, Phra Wisutthisarathen.

Based on the Care for the Wild International report, a coalition of 39 conservation groups, including the Humane Society International, the Association of Zoos and Aquariums, World Animal Protection, and the World Wide Fund for Nature, sent a letter to the director general of National Parks of Thailand under the name &quot;The International Tiger Coalition&quot;. The letter urged the director general to take action against the Tiger Temple over its import and export of 12 tigers with Laos, its lack of connection with accredited conservation breeding programs, and to genetically test the tigers at the Tiger Temple to determine their pedigree and value to tiger conservation programs. It concludes that the temple does not have the facilities, the skills, the relationships with accredited zoos, or even the desire to manage its tigers in an appropriate fashion. Instead, it is motivated purely by profit.

In December 2006, ABC News spent three days at the temple and did not see any evidence of drugging or mistreating the animals. Both Thai and Western employees who were interviewed claimed that the animals were well-treated. The abbot of the monastery stated that the eventual goal was to breed tigers for release into the wild.

In 2014, Care for the Wild International called for an end to &quot;tiger selfies&quot; in a global campaign coinciding with International Tiger Day. The charity&#x27;s CEO, Philip Mansbridge, was quoted as saying: &quot;I know people will immediately think we&#x27;re overreacting or just out to spoil people&#x27;s fun. But the reality is, one quick pic for you means a lifetime of suffering for that animal.&quot; The charity estimates that there are up to 60 incidents a year (of varying severity) of captive tigers mauling tourists or volunteers at places like Tiger Temple.

On 2 February 2015, an investigation of the temple commenced by forest officials. After initially being rebuffed, they returned the following day with a warrant, police, and soldiers. They seized protected wild birds and impounded the tigers on the premises. The head of the Wildlife Crime Suspension office stated the park did not have the proper permits for raising the birds. The tigers were impounded pending further investigation into the tigers&#x27; documentation.

In January and May 2016, two reports spanning nine years of investigations were released by the Australian organisation Cee4life (Conservation and Environmental Education 4 Life) The first Cee4life report contains CCTV, recordings, and witness statements regarding the disappearance of tigers at Tiger Temple. The second report contains evidence of tiger body part sales, gifting and international transport. &quot;National Geographic&quot; alleged that the Buddhist monks there are operating a for-profit breeding, sales, and exploitation business with the tigers at the temple. The following May, Thai authorities began seizing animals and attempting to shut down the facility. Breeding of tigers for commercial use or otherwise is prohibited by the CITES Convention, and tigers (being endangered) are regarded as state property in Thailand.

In late-May 2016, police and wildlife officials began an operation to remove all living tigers at Tiger Temple. During the operation, officials found over 40 tiger cub corpses as well as numerous body parts from other animals preserved in freezers. According to a representative of the Department of National Parks, the tiger cubs had died only a short time before the raid. The temple, however, had not reported the birth of any tigers for months. This was seen as a sign for hidden illegal breeding. Some twelve living hornbills were also confiscated as being possessed without a license. The abbot&#x27;s secretary was stopped from leaving the site with over 1000 amulets containing pieces of tiger skin, two whole tiger skins, and nine or ten tiger fangs. He and four other persons are investigated for alleged wildlife smuggling. The temple was closed to the public at the beginning of the raid. On 3 June, another thirty carcasses of tiger cubs were found in containers with English-language labels, suggesting that they might have been for sale. Since its founding in 1994, the temple has profited greatly from tourism while billing itself as a spiritual organization dedicated to wildlife conservation.

<text>The Reeh–Schlieder theorem is a result in relativistic local quantum field theory published by Helmut Reeh and Siegfried Schlieder in 1961.

The theorem states that the vacuum state formula_1 is a cyclic vector for the field algebra formula_2 corresponding to any open set formula_3 in Minkowski space. That is, any state formula_4 can be approximated to arbitrary precision by acting on the vacuum with an operator selected from the local algebra, even for formula_4 that contain excitations arbitrarily far away in space. In this sense, states created by applying elements of the local algebra to the vacuum state are not localized to the region formula_3.

For practical purposes, however, local operators still generate quasi-local states. More precisely, the long range effects of the operators of the
local algebra will diminish rapidly with distance, as seen by the cluster properties of the Wightman functions. And with increasing distance, creating a unit vector localized outside the region requires operators of ever increasing operator norm.
This theorem is also cited in connection with quantum entanglement. But it is subject to some doubt whether the Reeh–Schlieder theorem can usefully be seen as the quantum field theory analog to quantum entanglement, since the exponentially-increasing energy needed for long range actions will prohibit any macroscopic effects. However, Benni Reznik showed that vacuum entanglement can be distilled into EPR pairs used in quantum information tasks.

It is known that the Reeh–Schlieder property applies not just to the vacuum but in fact to any state with bounded energy. If some finite number &quot;N&quot; of space-like separated regions is chosen, the multipartite entanglement can be analyzed in the typical quantum information setting of &quot;N&quot; abstract quantum systems, each with a Hilbert space possessing a countable basis, and the corresponding structure has been called &quot;superentanglement&quot;.

<text>El Rosario () is a city and its surrounding municipality in the Mexican state of Sinaloa. It stands at .

The city reported 16,001 inhabitants in the 2010 census.

==Overview==
El Rosario, a small town about south of Mazatlán, is famous for the altar in the town church. The altar alone makes a visit to El Rosario somewhat worth the drive. El Rosario was once the richest town in Northwest Mexico because of the local mining operations. This small town was the home of the famous Mexican singer, Lola Beltrán. They have built a small museum in her honor although the museum is open only sporadically. The local economy produces pottery, furniture, and leather goods.

The city was founded on August 3, 1655. It is said that on that day a corporal named Bonifacio was looking for missing cattle. He walked along a river in what is now known as Loma de Santiago, from where the cattle was lost. He went for it and captured it. As it had turned to night he lit a fire. When he woke up he was in for a major surprise, under the ashes of the fire he saw large molten silver adhered to a rock. He then gave the news to his boss. But before he left to give the news he left rosary beads to mark the place. His boss ran to the location to confirm that it was silver and began to extract the silver.

==Cultural references==
Rosario Sinaloa is the town referred to as Tres Camarones in the writing of Luis Alberto Urrea.
The area now is known for growing amapola and marijuana in the hillsides, considered now the new gold mines for the area.

<doc id="736627" wikidata="Q3272164" url="?curid=736627" title="George Cadbury">
<text>George Cadbury (19 September 1839 – 24 October 1922) was an English Quaker businessman and social reformer who expanded his father&#x27;s Cadbury&#x27;s cocoa and chocolate company in Britain.

==Background==
George Cadbury was the son of John Cadbury, a tea and coffee dealer, and his wife Candia.

The Cadburys were members of the Society of Friends or Quakers.

He worked at a school for adults on Sundays with no pay, despite only going to the school himself till he was fifteen. At sixteen, he was apprenticed to Joseph Rowntree, in York, to learn the grocery trade. 

== Cadbury Brothers Limited ==
When his family firm was in trouble, due to his father’s declining health after his mother’s death from tuberculosis in 1855, he moved back to Birmingham without having completed his apprenticeship. His older brother Richard was already working in their father’s business, and the two brothers took over the chocolate producer Cadbury Brothers in 1861.

In 1878, they acquired 14 acres (57,000 m2) of land in open country, four miles (6 km) south-west of Birmingham, where they opened a new factory in 1879. When Cadbury Brothers was incorporated as a limited company on 16 June 1899, George and Richard owned 100% of the ordinary shares in their business.

Their father had previously been working on a blend of cocoa and lichen that he had hoped had medicinal properties. The brothers continued the work and launched the product as “Icelandic Moss”.  Although it was not the success that they had hoped for, they worked long hours and lived a very frugal lifestyle to keep the firm from insolvency with help from the £4000 that had been left to them by their mother. When George heard about a Dutch chocolatier, Coenraad van Houten, who had devised a method of extracting most of the unpalatable fat from cocoa, which made it a more appealing drink; he went to Holland to see Van Houten although he didn’t speak Dutch. He returned triumphant with a defatting machine. The machine proved to be a success and Cadbury’s launched their “Absolutely Pure Therefore Best” cocoa essence. It saved the company and enabled it to grow into a large and successful enterprise with a reputation for quality products and for treating its employees well.

The Cadbury brothers were concerned with the quality of life of their employees and provided an alternative to city life. As more land was acquired and the brothers moved the factory to a new country location, they decided to build a factory town (designed by architect William Alexander Harvey), which was not exclusive to the employees of the factory. This village became known as Bournville after the nearby river and French word for &quot;town&quot;. The houses were never privately owned, and their value stayed low and affordable. Bournville was a marked change from the poor living conditions of the urban environment. Here, families had houses with yards, gardens, and fresh air. By 1900, when Cadbury renounced his proprietorship of the estate and set up the Bournville Village Trust, there were 313 houses for various social classes; by 1960 the trust held 1,000 acres with 3,500 houses. To the present, the town offers affordable housing.

The brothers cared for their employees; they both believed in workers’s social rights and hence they installed canteens and sport grounds. Nineteen years after Richard died, George opened a works committee for each gender which discussed proposals for improving the firm. He also pressed ahead with other ideas, like an annuity, a deposit account and education facilities for every employee.

== Philanthropy ==
He rented &#x27;Woodbrooke&#x27; – a Georgian style mansion built by Josiah Mason, which he eventually bought in 1881. In 1903, he founded a Quaker higher educational institution for social-service oriented education – an institution that still functions as the Woodbrooke Quaker Study Centre. In the early 20th century, he and John Wilhelm Rowntree established a Quaker study centre in the building, and it remains the only such centre in Europe today, offering short educational courses on spiritual and social matters to Quakers and others.

In 1901, disgusted by the imperialistic policy of the Unionist Government dominated by Colonial Secretary Joseph Chamberlain, and opposed to the Boer War, George Cadbury bought the &quot;Daily News&quot; (afterward the &quot;News Chronicle&quot;) and used the paper to campaign for old age pensions and against the war and sweatshop labour. Cadbury was actively involved in politics and supported William Gladstone. Dismayed at how the Liberals took the country into the First World War (1914-1918), George switched his allegiance to the Independent Labour Party who were anti war.   

In 1907, George Cadbury bought Selly Manor, an old Tudor house menaced by destruction in the surroundings of Birmingham. He decided to rescue, preserve and move it to Bournville. This was completed in 1916 by architect William Alexander Harvey. Selly Manor is now a museum.

George Cadbury was one of the prime movers in setting up The Birmingham Civic Society in 1918. Cadbury donated the Lickey Hills Country Park to the people of Birmingham. He also donated a large house in Northfield to the Birmingham Cripples Union that was used as a hospital from 1909. It is now called the Royal Orthopaedic Hospital.

He died at home, Northfield Manor House, on 24 October 1922, aged 83 of natural causes.

==Family life==
George Cadbury married twice. In London, Middlesex, on 14 March 1872 he married Mary Tylor (born March 1849 at Stamford Hill, London; died June 1887 at Newton Abbot in Devon), daughter of Quaker author Charles Tylor and wife Gulielma Maria Sparkes. She was the mother of George Jr, Mary Isabel, Edward, Henry, and Eleanor Cadbury.

In Peckham Rye, Southwark, London, on 19 June 1888 he married Elizabeth Mary Taylor. They had six children together: Laurence John, George Norman, Elsie Dorothea, Egbert, Marion Janet, and Ursula.

==Legacy==
The George Cadbury Carillon School was opened in 2006 and is the only carillon school in the United Kingdom.

George Cadbury has a miniature locomotive named after him, originally owned by the husband of his daughter Elsie Dorothea, Geoffrey Hoyland.

<text>Mocorito () (From Cahita, meaning &quot;place where people speak macuri (dialect of Mayo)&quot; or &quot;place of the dead&quot;) is the municipality seat of the Municipality of Mocorito in the Mexican state of Sinaloa.

The city reported 5,926 inhabitants in the 2020 census.

== Indigenous Groups==

At the time of the Spanish contact, the Cáhita group of tribes were living in pueblos and permanent villages along the banks of the Mocorito, Sinaloa, Fuerte, Mayo and Yaqui Rivers in the coastal regions of both southern Sonora and northern Sinaloa. The Cáhitan group is part of the Uto-Aztecan Language Group and is most closely related to the Pima and Cora languages.

== Etymology ==
Professor Héctor R. Olea indicates that Mocorito is a Cáhita term, a variant of &quot;macori-to,&quot; composed of macuri, an apocopation of &quot;macorihui,&quot; a modification of the term &quot;macoyahuy,&quot; referring to a group of Mayo Indians or people who speak a dialect of the Cahita language; additionally, the suffix &quot;to&quot; denotes location, place; the place name means &quot;place of people who speak a dialect of the Cahita language, or where the Mayo Indians or macoritos reside.&quot;

Other historians, such as Mr. Eustaquio Buelna, lean towards translating Mocorito as &quot;place of the dead.&quot;

==History==
In the year 1531, with the arrival of the conqueror Nuño de Guzmán to the northwest of Mexico and the founding of the town of San Miguel de Navito, the geographic demarcation of the province of Culiacán began, subject to the governance of New Galicia. In 1532, Sebastián de Evora reached the valley of Mocorito and named it after himself, both the town and the river, becoming an encomendero under the major alcalde of the province of Culiacán, which from that year was delimited between the Evora River to the north and the Elota River to the south.

In 1594, the Mission of Mocorito was founded by Jesuits Juan Bautista Velasco and Hernando de Santarán.

By 1732, when the Spanish expansion reached beyond the Yaqui River, the territory was divided into provinces. That year, Sonora and Sinaloa were first located to form a single governance with its capital in the town of San Felipe and Santiago de Sinaloa, today Sinaloa de Leyva.

In Sinaloa territory, the internal division of 3 provinces persisted: Sinaloa, Culiacán, and Chametla, whose boundaries were the Mayo River to the north and the Cañas River to the south.

In 1749, the territory was divided into 5 provinces, and although Mocorito seemingly remained under the jurisdiction of the province of Culiacán, in the record of &quot;Los Pueblos, Villas, Lugares de Indios y Reales de Minas&quot; (The Towns, Villages, Indian Places, and Royal Mines), with expression of their jurisdictions made at that time, within the jurisdiction of Culiacán were the towns of Capirato, Comanito, and Palos Blancos; and within the jurisdiction of Sinaloa, the mission of Mocorito and the town of San Benito.

In 1813, the Constitution of Cádiz came into effect; Article 310 contemplated the installation of municipalities in populations that had more than 1,000 inhabitants.

In 1814, Ferdinand VII repealed the constitution, but it was reinstated in 1820. From this point on, the first municipalities of Sinaloa were established.

The creation of the Estado de Occidente in 1824, joining the provinces of Sonora and Sinaloa, and the internal division of this state into five departments with their respective districts, did not modify the internal situation of the Sinaloan territory with respect to Mocorito, as the department of Culiacán was formed with the district of its name and that of Cosalá, including the region of Mocorito within it, with the boundaries from the river of its name to the Elota River.

In 1830, the definitive separation of Sonora and Sinaloa was decreed to form their independent federal entities. The new state of Sinaloa was divided into eleven districts, with Mocorito being one of them, which within its jurisdiction, marked the limits on the north side of the coast, the town of Playa Colorada, and towards the mountains, the town of Corral Quemado, adjacent to the district of Badiraguato; by the same mountain range, to the south, it bordered the district of Culiacán and the town of Ocualtita; heading towards Jesús María almost reaching the coast, with the town of Aguapepe and with Los Toldos, opposite the island of Tachichilte.

Mocorito was established as a Municipality by decree published on April 8, 1915. In 1916, Mocorito experienced a reduction in its geographic extension when the political directorate of Angostura became a Municipality. In 1962, it underwent a new reduction upon the formation of the municipality of Salvador Alvarado.

===Meaning of the coat of arms===
During the tenure of mayor Luis Verduzco Leal, the coat of arms for the municipality of Mocorito was created in 1964 by Mr. Miguel Angel Velázquez Tracy. It was designed in an oval shape, split into four sections, with a border made out of stone to honor the indigenous origin, reflecting their unfamiliarity with metal and featuring footprints oriented from northwest to southeast in greater number and from southeast to northwest in fewer numbers. This symbolizes the Nahuatl pilgrimage that populated Sinaloa, and Mocorito in particular.

In the top left section of the shield, a black background represents the darkness of prehistory.

The top right section signifies the dawn of Mocorito&#x27;s history. At the top of the section there&#x27;s a small building alongside the Sinaloa River with a road crossing a river which represents the Mocorito River. The path ends at the convergences of the Humaya and Tamazula rivers with a larger building respresentin city of San Miguel de Culiacán.

In the bottom right section, on a silver background, an indigenous-styled hermitage with the date 1594 signifies the founding of the Mocorito mission.

In the bottom left section, a gold background symbolizes the zenith of the colonial history, the current church, and above it an orange drop originating from a hill symbolizing gold exploitation. The flame-like mantle outside the border signifies the patriotic movements, the open book with the dates 1857-1917 represents the constitutions, and the spread eagle in bronze signifies the nation, holding a banner with the words &quot;Estado de Sinaloa&quot; (State of Sinaloa).

==Culture and traditions==
===Carnival===
The carnival has been held in Mocorito years ago. On the first day people gather expecting the identity of temper that evening burn is known. The second day is the crowning of the Queen of the Floral Games. On the third day, the coronation of the Queen of Carnival takes place. On Sunday is the first tour of floats and bands. Monday is the coronation of the Kings and Children ride floats and to close with a flourish, on Tuesday, the traditional walk is performed, to the best allegorical cars and bands are rewarded and culminates with a large popular dance.

The music could not miss as it is one of the deepest traditions. José Rubio Quinonez heir of the Sinaloa music, promoter of the popular bands of Sinaloa. The band &quot;Los Hermanos Rubio Mocorito&quot; has toured the country from Tijuana to Mexico City, playing the merry notes of the drum: sones &quot;The Lost Child&quot;, &quot;El Toro Viejo&quot;, &quot;Brisas de Mocorito&quot;, &quot;The Sinaloa &quot;,&quot; El Palo Verde &quot;and many more.

<doc id="736663" wikidata="Q1955282" url="?curid=736663" title="Sir William Brereton, 1st Baronet">
<text>Sir William Brereton, 1st Baronet (13 September 1604 – 7 April 1661), was an English religious Independent, author, and landowner from Cheshire. He was Member of Parliament for Cheshire at various times between 1628 and 1653, and during the First English Civil War, commander of Parliamentarian forces in the North Midlands.

In the 1630s, he travelled extensively through France, the Dutch Republic, Scotland, and Ireland; his travel journals from 1634 and 1635 were published in the 19th century. His records and letters from the Civil War are a primary source for Parliamentary local administration in the period, as well as the internal divisions that led to the Second English Civil War.

Despite a lack of prior military experience, he proved an energetic and capable soldier, and was one of the most powerful men in England when the First Civil War ended in 1646. However, he gave up his local offices, and although nominated as a judge, refused to attend the trial of Charles I in January 1649. He was elected to the English Council of State in 1652 and 1653 but rarely attended, living in semi-retirement in London. He resumed his seat for Cheshire when the Long Parliament was reinstated in 1659, until its dissolution in March 1660, and died on 7 April 1661.

==Personal details==
Brereton was born 13 September 1604 at the family home, Handforth Hall, eldest son of William Brereton (1584–1610), and Margaret Holland (1585–1609). Orphaned at the age of six, he was made a ward of his maternal grandfather, Richard Holland of Denton (1549–1618).

As well as Handforth Hall, he inherited over 3,000 acres from his parents; in 1623, he married Susanna Booth, fourth daughter of another substantial local landowner, Sir George Booth, of Dunham Massey Hall, Cheshire.

George Moxon became his chaplain after being ordained in 1626.

Before her death in 1637, they had four children; Susanna (1627, after 1661), Thomas (1632–1674), Frances (1635–1676), and Catherine (c. 1637 – after 1661). He took a second wife in 1641, Cicely Mytton, a wealthy Staffordshire widow, who died in 1649, and they had a daughter, Cecilia (c. 1642–1704). His will left Catherine and Cecilia £1,000 each.

==Career; pre-1642==
He graduated from Brasenose College, Oxford, in 1621, and as was then common, studied law at Gray&#x27;s Inn prior to his marriage in 1623. It was here that he became friends with John Bradshaw, a lawyer from Cheshire who served as judge during the Trial of Charles I in January 1649.

Like his maternal grandfather and father-in-law, Brereton was a zealous Puritan, a generic term for anyone who wanted to reform, or &#x27;purify&#x27;, the Church of England. The most prominent were Presbyterians, who wanted to bring its doctrine and structure into line with the Church of Scotland, and included Parliamentary leaders like John Pym and John Hampden. Based on his support for the Congregationalist radical, Samuel Eaton, and the reforms advocated by Sir Henry Vane the Younger in 1641, Brereton appears to have sympathised with those who rejected the concept of state-ordained religion.

Appointed Deputy lieutenant for Cheshire, he was an unusually active Justice of the Peace, or JP, attending over 80% of sessions held between 1625 and 1641; in the same period, only one other person managed over 40%. In 1627, he was made a baronet in return for funding 30 soldiers in Ireland for three years. In the 1628 Parliament, Brereton was elected MP for Cheshire; Charles I dissolved Parliament in 1629, and did not call another until 1640, instituting a period of Personal Rule sometimes called the &quot;Eleven Year Tyranny&quot;.

In the summer of 1634, Brereton visited the Dutch Republic and later published a detailed account of his travels. He installed the Dutch system of duck decoys on his lands, leading to disputes with his neighbours, who claimed it interfered with their hunting and hawking. Another journal covered his trip through North East England, the Scottish Lowlands, and Ireland in 1635. He later visited France, and possibly Northern Italy, although these writings have not survived.

Despite his opposition in principle to taxes levied without Parliament, he paid Ship Money and took little part in the political debates that dominated the late 1630s. His main interests were religious and he strongly opposed Archbishop Laud&#x27;s reforms to the Church of England. In 1640, he was re-elected for Cheshire in both the Short and Long Parliaments, and appointed to a number of Parliamentary Committees on religion. In early 1641, he organised a petition from Cheshire demanding the expulsion of bishops from the Church of England, and also supported the removal of church monuments. Perhaps surprisingly, when Brereton visited Glastonbury in 1635 he made a point of taking &quot;a special view&quot; of the Holy Thorn, a notoriously papistical plant; he &quot;brought away many branches and leaves, and left the first letters of my name thereon upon record&quot;.

==First English Civil War==
Following the outbreak of the Irish Rebellion in October 1641, Brereton supervised the transport of troops and supplies from Chester to Ireland. When the First English Civil War began in August 1642, this made him an obvious choice for commander of Parliamentarian forces in the area. However, most of the Cheshire gentry was Royalist, including his cousin, William, Baron Brereton, and he was forced to withdraw to London.

Along with a number of other regions, at the beginning of the war some prominent Cheshire notables attempted to remain neutral, and in December 1642 issued the Bunbury Agreement, which demanded an end to fighting in the area. This proved impossible to enforce and in March 1643, Parliament sent Brereton back to Cheshire with 500 men, where he linked up with 2,000 local volunteers. Despite lacking military experience, he soon proved an energetic and resolute commander, winning two minor but significant victories at Middlewich and Hopton Heath. Establishing his headquarters at Nantwich, he soon attained superiority over Arthur Capell, Royalist commander in Shropshire, Cheshire, and North Wales.

Over the next few years, Brereton waged an aggressive and relentless campaign throughout the North Midlands, one of his key subordinates being Colonel Robert Venables, a long-time family connection and friend, who later served in Ireland. Their activities forced the Royalists to divert resources from other areas, as Chester was essential for funnelling men and material from their supporters in Ireland and North Wales.

In October 1643, Capell was replaced by Lord Byron, who assembled an army of over 5,000, many of them veterans from the war in Ireland. Defeated at Second Middlewich in December, Brereton appealed to Sir Thomas Fairfax for support. At Nantwich in January 1644, their combined force routed Byron, who lost over 1,500 men, most of his artillery, and baggage train and spent most of the next two years blockaded in Chester.

At Malpas in August 1644, Brereton added to his reputation by routing Royalist cavalry under Marmaduke Langdale who had escaped from the defeat at Marston Moor. Combined with his influence in the region, this meant Brereton was one of the few to be exempted from the February 1645 Self-Denying Ordinance, under which army officers could not also be MPs. Chester finally surrendered in February 1646, and in March Brereton fought in the last major battle of the war at Stow-on-the-Wold. He then besieged Lichfield, one of the last Royalist strongholds in England, which capitulated in July 1646.

More than 2,000 of his letters from this period survive, and are one of the most important sources for understanding Parliamentary administration during the war. They also provide insights into its internal politics; Brereton was a member of the &#x27;War Party&#x27;, those who viewed military victory as essential before any negotiations with Charles. The &#x27;Peace Party&#x27; included Denzil Holles, one of the Five Members whose failed arrest in January 1642 was a major step on the road to war.

==Post 1646==
Historian John Morrill writes that in 1646, Brereton was &#x27;one of the most powerful and influential men in England&#x27;. As a reward for his services, Parliament granted him possession of Eccleshall Castle, seat of the Bishop of Lichfield, and Croydon Palace, owned by the Archbishop of Canterbury. After Pride&#x27;s Purge in December 1648, he retained his seat in the Rump Parliament, and was appointed to the High Court of Justice for the trial of Charles I in January 1649, although he did not attend.

Despite being elected to the English Council of State in 1651 and 1652, during the Commonwealth he lived in semi-retirement in Croydon Palace. The precise reasons are unclear, although it has been suggested he was disillusioned by the post-war religious and political settlement. In the 1656 election, he unsuccessfully stood for Cheshire in opposition to the list proposed by Major-General Bridge.

When the Long Parliament re-assembled in 1659, he took his seat once more but did not stand for the Convention Parliament. After the 1660 Restoration, he was obliged to return the church properties awarded in 1646 but was apparently allowed to stay on at Croydon at Croydon Palace where he died on 7 April 1661. His body was originally conveyed to St Mary&#x27;s Church, Cheadle, Cheshire for burial, but whilst the funeral cortège made its way northwards a horse stumbled crossing a river in spate and the coffin was temporarily lost. It was finally extricated from the water and was returned to Croydon. Parish records show he was buried in Croydon Minster.

people, were Protestant.” That year there were also 32,783 Jehovah&#x27;s witnesses and over 180,000 people who reported no religion. 
Sinaloa Navolato is not very well known by most people, but it is a rather unusual place to know and learn about. For example, the name Sinaloa comes from the Chaita language. It is a combination of the words sina, which means pithaya (a plant with thorny stalks), and lobola, which means rounded. The pithaya is a common plant throughout the region, which has great meaning.

==Geography==
In Navolato according to the Junior Worldmark Encyclopedia of the Mexican States, &quot;Along the coastal plains of Sinaloa it remains hot even after cold times.” Temperatures in the daytime can be up to 90 degrees and in winter times like around December, January, and February can be up to 80 degrees. Most of the rain fall occurs in July, August, and September along with cooling temperatures by the coast. This part of Sinaloa is mostly watched by the Environmental Protection Agency due tremendous climate change. In the Junior Worldmark Encyclopedia of the Mexican States it says, “That this part of Mexico has teamed up with U.S. and Alaska to form a group called the Western Hemisphere Shorebird Reserve Network.” The reason why it was named this is because of the Pacific Flyway Shorebirds that breed in Canada, Alaska, and other West Coastal regions of the United States. According to MagnaVerno, “Watering prior to harvest allows the basil to be cut/harvested three times.” Plants here can range from oaks to poplars to cieba and mangroves, which is an evergreen that usually grows along the coast. Fruit like lemons, peaches and pears are also known to be found as well. Animals that can be found in this area are: dears, wildcats, badgers, wild boar, coyotes and tlacuaches. However, fishing is another great part of Navolato, which holds second place national level terms of value of production, and third in fish and other seafood.

==Government==
Navolato was part of the municipality of Culiacan until the year 1982 when it was constituted as a municipality. A decree was publicized in the official newspaper on August 27, constituting itself in a way as the eighteenth municipal of surrounding the community. There are a couple of historical monuments in Navolato according to the Encyclopedia of the Municipals of Mexico Sinaloa such as, &quot;The Temple of San Francisco de Asis, which was built in 1950 and the Chapel of San Jose, which was built in 1927.&quot;

The judicial system is called the Tribunal of Justice, which is the highest court system in the state of Mexico. The Supreme Tribunal of justice has eleven members that are assigned for fifteen years with no reappointment. There is a required retirement age of 70 years. According to Explorando Mexico,&quot;the state governor of Navolato office is assisted by the departments of director&#x27;s of liaisons and events, public relations. The Governor’s hearings are over seen by administrative and touring coordinators, as well private secretary and other auxiliary secretaries in charge of the Governor’s agenda, among other federal dependencies and autonomous organizations&quot;.

==Economy==
Resources are formed from a variety of products that are from harvest fields that grow wheat, bean, fruits, potatoes, zucchini and sugar cane. Navolato is the largest industry in the state that produces a large exporting capacity, which has become an integral part of the state. Infrastructure transports its food and vegetables from two important international airports, which are Mazatlan and Topolobampo. Harvest is transported from Navolato to difference parts of Mexico to supply their markets, as while as their income. Navolato also depends on local railroads to transport merchandise and other food produces. Navolato economy is slowly expanding and finding new ways to build their cities. For example, telecommunications and electricity generated throughout their cities. Navolato government and economy is maintaining their judicial system and keeping becoming more proficient.

Navolato is most known for its renowned agricultural industry. Because of their versatile location, Navolato produces a large array of agricultural products. Navolato leads in the production of sugar cane, rice, vegetables, wheat, beans, and sea food. The fishing and horticulture is second following Navolato&#x27;s natural resources, which are also leading asset to the nation income. “Agriculture and livestock account for about 21% of the economy&quot;. The list of agriculture and livestock is very abundant due to the location. Many of the crops are produced through irrigation near sea level, which is what makes these crops such a high demand. Navolato is so famous for their agriculture, Navolato would be expected to produce and export their product in a timely manner. “Its high productivity allows participation in international markets by exporting fruit and vegetable products which represents more than 60% of the total exports in Sinaloa&quot;. Navolatos agriculture is a highly prized business as well. “On a national level, it is among the first place in vegetables such a tomatoes, cucumber, pumpkins, potatoes, chilies, and eggplant, in fruits there are mangos, cantaloupes, and watermelon, and in grains, there corn, beans, soybeans, safflowers, rice, wheat, and sorgum&quot;. The second largest business would be the livestock and the breeding of livestock. They are also most known for the fishing industry as well. Navolato is known for this because they are located right off the Pacific Ocean. By breeding livestock, Navolato farmers are able to succeed in the business of producing sausage, cheese, and milk among with other products made from livestock.

<text>Deal is a coastal town in Kent, England, which lies where the North Sea and the English Channel meet, north-east of Dover and south of Ramsgate. It is a former fishing, mining and garrison town whose history is closely linked to the anchorage in the Downs. Close to Deal is Walmer, a possible location for Julius Caesar&#x27;s first arrival in Britain.

Deal became a &#x27;limb port&#x27; of the Cinque Ports in 1278 and grew into the busiest port in England; today it is a seaside resort, its streets and houses a reminder of its history along with many ancient buildings and monuments. In 1968, Middle Street was the first conservation area in Kent. The coast of France is approximately from the town and is visible on clear days. Deal Castle is a device fort commissioned by then-King, Henry VIII.

==History==
Deal is first mentioned as a village in the &quot;Domesday Book&quot; of 1086, where it appears as &quot;Addelam&quot;. It is referred to as &quot;Dela&quot; in 1158, and &quot;Dale&quot; in 1275. The name is the Old English &quot;dael&quot; meaning &#x27;valley&#x27;, cognate with the modern English &#x27;dale&#x27;. Deal developed into a port by the end of the 13th century. In 1495, the town was the site of an attempted landing by the pretender to the English throne Perkin Warbeck. His supporters were driven off by locals loyal to Henry VII at the Battle of Deal, fought on the beach. Sandown, Deal and Walmer castles were constructed around the town by Henry VIII to protect against foreign naval attack.
In 1699 the inhabitants petitioned for incorporation, since previously the town had been under the jurisdiction of Sandwich and governed by a deputy appointed by the mayor of that town; William III by his charter incorporated the town under the title of mayor, jurats and commonalty of Deal. Deal Town Hall, the former meeting place of Deal Borough Council, was completed in 1803.

In 1861, the Royal Marine Depot was established in the town. In 1989, it was bombed by the Provisional Irish Republican Army, killing 11 bandsmen.

===Maritime history===
The proximity of Deal&#x27;s shoreline to the Goodwin Sands has made its coastal waters a source of both shelter and danger through the history of sea travel in British waters. The Downs, the water between the town and the sands, provides a naturally sheltered anchorage. Positioned at the eastern end of the English Channel, this is where sailing vessels would wait for a favourable wind, either to proceed into the North Sea, or, heading to the west, down the Channel. Ships going from London (the largest port in the world for much of the age of sail) to the Channel would leave under a fair wind (largely westerly), would turn south past the North Foreland and then find the same wind to be against them to go any further. (The reverse is true for ships heading for London from the Channel: a westerly wind prevents the last part of their journey.) It was common to find four or five hundred ships waiting for a slight change in wind direction that would allow them to proceed. When a useful wind shift occurred, those in the anchorage would be hastily weighing anchor and setting sail, whilst some ships heading in the opposite direction might now be entering the Downs to anchor, as the wind had turned against them.

When the port of Sandwich silted up, the only way to provide ships in the Downs with fresh provisions, stores and equipment was in boats launched directly from the beach. This was an extensive trade for Deal, and lasted until steam ships took over from sail. Deal also provided a convenient landing place for passengers for London, potentially saving a long wait for a fair wind to finish a voyage; it also allowed outward bound ships to be caught up with and joined.

One problem with the Downs was the quality of the holding ground of the anchorage. It consists of chalk, which is not the best material. Hence it was common for ships in the roadstead to drag their anchors in strong winds, especially those from north round to east northeast or from the southeast, as these directions were less sheltered. This provided salvage work as an additional source of income for the town, with many ships being saved by help from the boatmen.

The importance of the Downs started to reduce from the late 1860s, as competition from steamships made speed an important commercial consideration. Sailing ships began to employ tugs to overcome adverse winds. By the 1880s, the only common usage of the anchorage was by small sailing vessels.

Deal was, for example, visited by Lord Nelson and was the first English soil on which James Cook set foot in 1771 on returning from his first voyage to Australia. The anchorage is still used today by international and regional shipping, though on a scale far smaller than in former times (some historical accounts report hundreds of ships being visible from the beach).

In 1672, a small Naval Yard was established at Deal, providing stores and minor repair facilities. Just outside the gates of the yard there is now a building originally used as a semaphore tower planned to be used as a communication link to the Admiralty in London but converted to a timeball tower, in 1855 and which remains today as a museum.

The Deal Maritime and Local History Museum is housed in an historic complex of light-industrial buildings in St George&#x27;s Road, dating from 1803. It contains a series of displays and artefacts, narrating the town&#x27;s maritime, industrial, domestic and leisure history.

====Boatmen====
The Deal boatmen were internationally famous for their skilled seamanship and bravery in operating their locally-built craft, launching and recovering from the open beach. Only the severest weather prevented the larger of the working boats from being able to launch. A range of work was done, with provisions and supplies being taken out to ships anchored in the Downs, and the Post Office paying for mail to be taken out or landed. Ballast (in the form of shingle loaded from the beach) would be sold. Passengers were taken to and from moored ships. It was not unusual for a ship in the Downs to lose her anchor – either slipping the cable in an emergency or if a cable or anchor chain parted, thereby providing two sources of work for the boatmen.

First, the Downs had to be kept as clear as possible of the obstruction that lost gear presented, otherwise the anchors of other ships could become entangled in them and prevent weighing. In 1607, two boatmen were awarded £30 a year for sweeping for and recovering lost anchors, with substantial numbers being salvaged. In the three years from 1866, over 600 anchors were swept up from the Downs – at that time the Board of Trade paid for this to be done. 

Secondly, a ship that had lost her anchor would need to replace it. A large store of ground tackle of every size was kept by the boatmen, from which a suitable example could be loaded into one of the larger luggers and taken out and sold to the ship which needed it. In ordinary weather, this charge would be the fair cost of the gear sold. In severe weather, provision of an anchor would be classed as salvage, since it often prevented the loss of the ship. After the Merchant Shipping Act 1854, the salvage claims became more fairly assessed than in prior years and substantial payments could be made to boatmen who launched into strong winds to provide this service. In November 1859, in 12 days 30 anchors and chains were supplied to ships in the Downs, 17 of them in one day. The lugger &quot;Albion&quot; earnt the most from this: £2,022 8s 6d, with other boats earning several hundred pounds each.

Other salvage work was also done by the boatmen —anything from supplying fresh men to man the pumps of a leaking vessel, to taking cargo off the wrecks of vessels that could not be saved—though with some instances when abandoned vessels aground on the Goodwins were saved, yielding significant awards by the Admiralty court.

An extensive smuggling trade existed from Deal, with a peak of activity in 1737. Special fast galleys (boats primarily propelled by oars) were built and used in calm misty weather, when the Revenue vessels had little chance of catching them. In response to this, in 1784 the government sent a punitive expedition of soldiers to Deal, supported by naval cutters stationed offshore. The boats were all smashed or burnt - so depriving the boatmen of a means to make a living. The resentment at this community punishment was set aside when the Napoleonic wars started, and the many naval vessels anchored in the Downs needed their services.

====Boats used by boatmen====
In the 19th century there were several types of boat used by the boatmen. The two largest were the Deal luggers. In the early part of the century, these were three-masted vessels, with a dipping lug on the fore and main masts and a standing lug mizzen. A jib was set on a bowsprit and the mizzen sheeted to a long outrigger. The mainmast could be dispensed with to give more working room in the boat or in the winter, so it was common for just two masts to be used. The mainmast ceased to be used altogether in the 1840s. The &quot;first class&quot; luggers (often called &quot;forepeakers&quot;) would be up to long, with a beam of , carrying six tons of ballast in a hull that weighed three-and-a-half tons. They were clinker built and had an enclosed forepeak in which the crew could shelter or sleep – but otherwise these were undecked, open boats. It was these larger luggers that would carry a replacement anchor out to a ship in the Downs. The smaller luggers were called &quot;cats&quot;, able to do most of the work of the larger boats, but instead of the enclosed forepeak they had a removable cabin that could be set up between the thwarts. There were 21 first class luggers operating from Deal in 1833 and 15 cats. In the same year, 54 four or six oared galleys worked from Deal. These were lighter boats of between in length. They could be sailed as well as rowed, setting a dipping lug on a single mast. They were used for taking passengers out to ships in the Downs and for boarding and landing pilots.

Luggers were launched bows first down the beach by slipping the chain that ran through the &quot;ruffles&quot; (a hole in the back of the keel) and travelled at gathering speed down greased wooden skids laid on the shingle. The intent was to gather enough momentum to get through the first waves encountered as the foresail was hoisted. A haul-off rope, led to an anchor set off-shore, could hold the boat up to the waves as the sail was hoisted and help the boat sheer off on the correct tack. If not enough speed was gained, unless the weather was calm, the boat would probably turn parallel to the beach and be smashed by the waves. At high water, the shorter run to the sea increased the difficulty of getting a good launch, as there was less space in which to pick up speed. When the boat&#x27;s work was complete, beaching was done by sailing on to the beach in front of the capstan, with a man standing in the sea ready to fasten the capstan rope to the chain strop that went through the front of the keel. For a large lugger it would take 20 or 30 men at the capstan to then haul the boat up the beach and then turn it round ready for the next launch. This was a hazardous task in which men could be killed or injured if control was lost of the large weights being moved.

===Naval and Military===

====The Navy Yard====
A naval storehouse was built in Deal in 1672, providing for ships anchored in the Downs. In time, the establishment grew to cover some five acres of land, to the north of the castle. There was also a victualling yard on site. In contrast to other naval yards, there was no place for ships to dock alongside at Deal, so instead a number of small supply boats were maintained at the yard; these would be launched from the shingle beach, carrying supplies, provisions, personnel or equipment as required. The Yard closed in 1864.

====The barracks====
The Royal Marines Depot was constructed shortly after the outbreak of the French Revolution. The layout originally consisted of adjacent cavalry and infantry barracks (later known as South Barracks), alongside which were separate hospitals for the Army and Navy. In due course the hospitals were also turned into barracks (known as North Barracks and East Barracks respectively). From 1861 the complex served as a sizeable Depot for the Royal Marines; latterly it was known in particular for the Royal Marines School of Music, which had moved there in 1930.

===Lifeboats===
===Piers===
The seafront at Deal has been adorned with three separate piers in the town&#x27;s history. The first, built in 1838, was designed by Sir John Rennie. After its wooden structure was destroyed in an 1857 gale, it was replaced by an iron pier in 1864. A popular pleasure pier, it survived until the Second World War, when it was struck and severely damaged by a mined Dutch ship, the &quot;Nora&quot;, in January 1940. This was not the first time the pier had been hit by shipping, with previous impacts in 1873 and 1884 necessitating extensive repairs.

The present pier, designed by Sir W. Halcrow &amp; Partners, was opened on 19 November 1957 by the Duke of Edinburgh. Deal&#x27;s current pier is the last remaining fully intact leisure pier in Kent and is a Grade II listed building.

===Museums===
Deal has several museums; most are related to Deal&#x27;s maritime history. Both Deal Castle and Walmer Castle are operated by English Heritage – Deal has a display on the events in the reign of Henry VIII that led to the invasion threat which caused its construction, along with some material on its subsequent history, whereas displays at Walmer concentrate on Walmer&#x27;s post-Tudor role as the Lord Warden&#x27;s residence. There is also a ruin of the third Tudor castle, Sandown Castle, in North Deal. The Deal Maritime and Local History Museum has exhibits of boats, smuggler galleys and model naval ships. It also contains extensive histories of the lifeboats as well as local parish registers. The Timeball Tower Museum, on the other hand, focuses on the importance of timekeeping for ships, and the role the building it occupies played. Kent Museum of the Moving Image (Kent MOMI) explores the deep history of the moving image — from the days of candle-lit magic lantern performances and hand-painted slides, through Victorian visual experimentation, to the advent and heyday of the cinema.

<text>Mohammad Ali Shah Qajar (‎; 21 June 1872 – 5 April 1925) was the sixth shah of the Qajar dynasty and remained the Shah of Iran from 8 January 1907 until being deposed on 16 July 1909. He was furthermore the grandson of Iran’s early moderniser Amir Kabir, through the maternal side.

==Biography==
Mohammad Ali Shah Qajar was opposed to the Persian Constitution of 1906, which had been ratified during the reign of his father, Mozaffar ad-Din Shah Qajar. Therefore, he was frequently criticized by the publications of the period, including a weekly newspaper &quot;Musavat&quot;. In 1907, Mohammad Ali dissolved the National Consultative Assembly and declared the Constitution abolished because it was contrary to Islamic law. He bombarded the Majles (Iranian parliament) with the military and political support of Russia and Britain.

In July 1909, pro-Constitution forces marched from Iran&#x27;s provinces to Tehran led by Sardar As&#x27;ad, Sepehdar A&#x27;zam, Sattar Khan, Bagher Khan and Yeprem Khan, deposed the Shah, and re-established the constitution.
On 16 July 1909, the parliament voted to place Mohammad Ali Shah&#x27;s 11-year-old son, Ahmad Shah on the throne. Mohammad Ali Shah abdicated following the new Constitutional Revolution and he has since been remembered as a symbol of dictatorship.

Having fled to Odesa, Russia (currently Ukraine), Mohammad Ali plotted his return to power. In 1911 he landed at Astarabad, Iran, but his forces were defeated. Mohammad Ali Shah returned to Russia, then in 1920 to Constantinople (present day Istanbul) and later to San Remo, Italy, where he died on 5 April 1925. He was buried at the Shrine of Imam Husain in Karbala, Iraq. Every Shah of Iran since Mohammad Ali has died in exile.

His son and successor, Ahmad Shah Qajar was the last sovereign of the Qajar dynasty.

<text>Tempest-Tost, published in 1951 by Clarke Irwin, is the first novel in &quot;The Salterton Trilogy&quot; by Canadian novelist Robertson Davies. The other two novels are &quot;Leaven of Malice&quot; (1954) and &quot;A Mixture of Frailties&quot; (1958). The series was also published in one volume as &quot;The Salterton Trilogy&quot; in 1986.

The trilogy revolves around the residents of the imaginary town of Salterton, Ontario.

==Plot summary==
Tempest-Tost could be considered theatre-fiction, which, as Graham Wolfe explains, refers to &quot;novels and stories that engage in concrete and sustained ways with theatre as artistic practice and industry&quot;. In the novel, an amateur theatrical group sets about mounting a production of Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;The Tempest&quot;. Romantic young scholar and assistant director Solomon (&quot;Solly&quot;) Bridgetower, womanizer Roger Tasset and repressed middle-aged math teacher Hector Mackilwraith vie for the rich, beautiful and indifferent leading lady Griselda Webster. As the production moves forward, each man presses his suit with characteristic blind-spots as small rivalries and ambitions are pursued by Griselda&#x27;s precocious sister Fredegonde (Freddy), the vain Professor Walter Vambrace, his socially awkward daughter Pearl Vambrace, and the mischievous musician Humphrey Cobbler.

<text>Leaven of Malice, published in 1954, is the second novel in &quot;The Salterton Trilogy&quot; by Canadian novelist Robertson Davies. The other two novels are &quot;Tempest-Tost&quot; (1951) and &quot;A Mixture of Frailties&quot; (1958). The series was also published in one volume as &quot;The Salterton Trilogy&quot; in 1986.

The trilogy revolves around the residents of the imaginary town of Salterton, Ontario.

Davies won the Stephen Leacock Award for Humour in 1955 for &quot;Leaven of Malice&quot;.

==Plot summary==

The book starts out with a false, anonymous engagement notice between Pearl Veronica Vambrace and Solomon (Solly) Bridgetower published in the local newspaper, the &quot;Bellman&quot;. The wedding is to be held on November 31 at the local cathedral. The notice creates a stir in the community. Professor Vambrace, the father of Pearl, is outraged, considering it an insult directed at himself and his family, due to his longtime feud with the Bridgetower family. He threatens the &quot;Bellman&#x27;s&quot; editor, Gloster Ridley, to sue the &quot;Bellman&quot; for libel. Mrs. Bridgetower is also outraged, although she confines this to her personal circle. Matters are not helped by the fact that Solly, while having once invited Pearl to a ball, is still besotted with Griselda Webster, a local beauty and heiress, who is definitely not interested in him (cf. &quot;Tempest-Tost&quot;).

Vambrace consults a lawyer, a relative of his wife, who suggests that he not go through with the case, and that the newspaper is as much a victim of the hoax as he is. The lawyer&#x27;s partner, Snelgrove, however, says otherwise, and offers to take the case himself.

The case is looked into by both Snelgrove and Ridley&#x27;s lawyer. Along with several major and minor characters in the novel, they pursue a quest for the person responsible for entering the false wedding notice, who is dubbed &#x27;X&#x27;. The climactic scene takes place at the &quot;Bellman&quot;, where the principal characters gather and the identity of X is revealed.

After all the chaos, Solly proposes to Pearl, who accepts. The &quot;Bellman&quot;&#x27;s editor, however, insists they deliver their engagement announcement to the paper in person.

The novel explores themes of innocence, guilt, and judgement.

<doc id="736674" wikidata="Q1340349" url="?curid=736674" title="Enterocyte">
<text>Enterocytes, or intestinal absorptive cells, are simple columnar epithelial cells which line the inner surface of the small and large intestines. A glycocalyx surface coat contains digestive enzymes. Microvilli on the apical surface increase its surface area. This facilitates transport of numerous small molecules into the enterocyte from the intestinal lumen. These include broken down proteins, fats, and sugars, as well as water, electrolytes, vitamins, and bile salts. Enterocytes also have an endocrine role, secreting hormones such as leptin.

==Function==
The major functions of enterocytes include:
*Ion uptake, including sodium, calcium, magnesium, iron, zinc, and copper. This typically occurs through active transport.
*Water uptake. This follows the osmotic gradient established by Na+/K+ ATPase on the basolateral surface. This can occur transcellularly or paracellularly.
*Sugar uptake. Polysaccharidases and disaccharidases in the glycocalyx break down large sugar molecules, which are then absorbed. Glucose crosses the apical membrane of the enterocyte using the sodium-glucose cotransporter. It moves through the cytosol (cytoplasm) and exits the enterocyte via the basolateral membrane (into the blood capillary) using GLUT2. Galactose uses the same transport system. Fructose, on the other hand, crosses the apical membrane of the enterocyte, using GLUT5. It is thought to cross into the blood capillary using one of the other GLUT transporters.
*Peptide and amino acid uptake. Peptidases in the glycocalyx cleave proteins to amino acids or small peptides. Enteropeptidase (also known as enterokinase) is responsible for activating pancreatic trypsinogen into trypsin, which activates other pancreatic zymogens. They are involved in the Krebs and the Cori Cycles and can be synthesized with lipase.
*Lipid uptake. Lipids are broken down by pancreatic lipase aided by bile, and then diffuse into the enterocytes. Smaller lipids are transported into intestinal capillaries, while larger lipids are processed by the Golgi and smooth endoplasmic reticulum into lipoprotein chylomicra and exocytozed into lacteals.
*Vitamin B12 uptake. Receptors bind to the vitamin B12-gastric intrinsic factor complex and are taken into the cell.
*Resorption of unconjugated bile salts. Bile that was released and not used in emulsification of lipids are reabsorbed in the ileum. Also known as the enterohepatic circulation.
*Secretion of immunoglobulins. Immunoglobulin A from plasma cells in the mucosa are absorbed through receptor-mediated endocytosis on the basolateral surface and released as a receptor-IgA complex into the intestinal lumen. The receptor component confers additional stability to the molecule.

==Disorders==
*Dietary fructose intolerance occurs when there is a deficiency in the amount of fructose carrier.
*Lactose intolerance is the most common problem of carbohydrate digestion and occurs when the human body doesn&#x27;t produce a sufficient amount of lactase enzyme to break down the sugar lactose found in dairy. As a result of this deficiency, undigested lactose is not absorbed and is instead passed on to the colon. There bacteria metabolize the lactose and in doing so release gas and metabolic products that enhance colonic motility. This causes gas and other uncomfortable symptoms.
*Cholera toxin may increase the secretion or decrease the intake of water and electrolytes, leading to possibly severe dehydration and electrolyte imbalance.
*Rotavirus selectively invades and kills mature enterocytes in the small intestine.

==Stem cell aging==
Intestinal stem cell aging has been studied in &quot;Drosophila&quot; as a model for understanding the biology of stem cell/niche aging. Using knockdown mutants defective in various genes that function in the DNA damage response in enterocytes, it was shown that deficiency in the DNA damage response accelerates intestinal stem cell aging, thus providing a better understanding of the molecular mechanisms of this aging process.

<doc id="736678" wikidata="Q4658301" url="?curid=736678" title="A Mixture of Frailties">
<text>A Mixture of Frailties, published by Macmillan in 1958, is the third novel in The Salterton Trilogy by Canadian novelist Robertson Davies. The other two novels are &quot;Tempest-Tost&quot; (1951) and &quot;Leaven of Malice&quot; (1954). The series was also published in one volume as The Salterton Trilogy in 1986.

The trilogy revolves around the residents of the imaginary town of Salterton, Ontario which bears some resemblance to Kingston where Davies studied at Queen&#x27;s University. Each book focuses on different protagonists but includes some characters from other books.

==Plot==

The protagonist in Frailties, Monica Gall, is a working-class girl with a beautiful but immature singing voice. But the novel begins before she is introduced, somewhat after &quot;Leaven of Malice&quot; ends, with two of its protagonists, Pearl Veronica Vambrace and Solly Bridgetower now married but stuck in a difficult situation. When Solly&#x27;s demanding mother Louisa Bridgetower dies, possessed of a much greater fortune than anyone except her lawyer knew about—over $1 million, more than $9 million today—she leaves instructions in her will to start a trust for the education in the arts of a young woman, in Europe, until such time as her son has a male child. The income from the rest all goes to the student. Until and unless the boy is born, Solly can&#x27;t touch the money; his only unencumbered inheritance is a measly $100 (and he and Veronica must live in and keep up his late mother&#x27;s house). This is Solly&#x27;s mother&#x27;s revenge on him and his wife for marrying against her wishes, an event that arises directly out of &quot;Leaven of Malice&quot;.

Monica becomes the beneficiary of the Bridgetower Trust, and goes to England to study with several teachers chosen for her by Sir Benedict Domdaniel, a theatrical knight who works as a conductor. Her experiences form the bulk of the novel. Meanwhile, back in Salterton, Solly deals with maintaining the Bridgetower estate on limited funds, and attempts more and more desperately to have a child with Veronica, so he will come into his conditional inheritance.

Monica is the daughter of a difficult mother also. Her family are Christian fundamentalists who exploit her talent by proselytizing on a local radio music show for which she is the best singer, but deprecate Monica&#x27;s talent.

Monica grows as an artist under the tutelage of several teachers, including the rakish Giles Revelstoke, a frustrated composer and underground newspaper publisher. Revelstoke&#x27;s character is based, in much biographical detail by Davies, on composer Peter Warlock (Philip Arnold Heseltine), whose own family were friends of the author&#x27;s in Wales. They eventually become lovers, with Monica supporting his aspirations. Monica&#x27;s mother dies, and when she returns for the funeral she finds how little she can now relate to her family and hometown. Returning to England, Revelstoke writes a critically acclaimed opera but embarrasses himself when he attempts to stand in for the conductor. In a fit of anger he insults Monica who writes him a letter breaking things off. When she goes to visit him, she finds that he has committed suicide by turning on the gas as suffocating himself, while clutching her letter. Fearing for her reputation, Monica takes the letter and leaves. She later learns from the coroner&#x27;s inquest that Revelstoke had still been alive when she found him. The metered gas had shut off after she left and he would have survived had he not aspirated on his vomit; Monica could have saved him if she had called for help, a decision which torments her.

Monica returns to Canada to find that Pearl has had a son and that the trust will be dissolved, which makes Monica happy. At loose ends, she receives a letter from the much older Sir Domdaniel, proposing marriage. The book ends with her cabling him with her answer, but the reader is not told her decision.

==Themes==
The book explores a broad range of life, melding the low and the high: dirty floors and unwashed feet in unheated flats, alongside the sublimity of soaring music and beautiful poetry. The omniscient narrator&#x27;s frequent asides are not digressions; they serve the novel&#x27;s themes.

==Reception==

The book was released to positive reviews, with Edmund Fuller, reviewing for &quot;The New York Times&quot;, saying &quot;(Davies) is lavish with character and laughter, wise and perceptive about life and art, capable of touching the sorrowful as well. In short, from Canada, a thoroughly rewarding writer with a fine new book.&quot; Each character is strikingly drawn, and, true to life, exhibit frailties, for which Davies shows considerable understanding, although he scorns the pompous and self-important. It&#x27;s a comic novel with its share of cruelty, cupidity and even tragedy, leavened with wisdom and triumph.

<text>The Vancouver Canadians are a Minor League Baseball (MiLB) team located in Vancouver, British Columbia. They are members of the Northwest League and the High-A affiliate of the Toronto Blue Jays. The Canadians play their home games at Nat Bailey Stadium. They are currently the only MiLB team based in Canada.

==History==
Prior to the 1999 season, the Vancouver Canadians Pacific Coast League franchise was purchased by a group led by Art Savage with the intention of relocating to Sacramento, California. Despite winning the Pacific Coast League title and the Triple-A World Series the Canadians moved to California&#x27;s capital city. Vancouver would not be without baseball as the Southern Oregon Timberjacks of the Northwest League announced relocation to fill the void in Vancouver. The Canadians name resumed as members of the Class A-Short Season Northwest League in 2000.

Like the predecessor Pacific Coast League franchise, the new Canadians signed a player development contract with the Oakland Athletics.
The Canadians had players such as Nick Swisher, Jeremy Brown, Jason Windsor, Joe Blanton, Rich Harden, Travis Buck, Dallas Braden, and Dan Straily on teams during this period.

In 2007, local Vancouver businessmen Jake Kerr and Jeff Mooney purchased the Vancouver Canadians and secured a 25-year lease with the City of Vancouver Parks Board. Extensive work began that offseason in a full-scale stadium renovation which improved washrooms, concessions, concourses, and children&#x27;s play area. Point-of-purchase concessions increased substantially.

In January 2008, former Washington Nationals executive Andy Dunn become the President and General Manager of the Canadians.

In the spring of 2010, the Vancouver Canadians and Scotiabank announced a long-term partnership that would see Nat Bailey Stadium renamed to Scotiabank Field at Nat Bailey Stadium.

The Canadians became the Short Season A affiliate of the Toronto Blue Jays following the 2010 season. This helped see the team&#x27;s attendance rise to 162,162 for the season, a team record. In September 2011, the Vancouver Canadians won their first Northwest League championship title, defeating the Tri-City Dust Devils, 9–2, to win the final series, 2–1. The following year, the Vancouver Canadians became back-to-back champions for the first time in franchise history, defeating the Boise Hawks, 12–9, to win the final series, 2–1.

In August 2013, outfielder Kevin Pillar became the first alumnus of the team to play in the major leagues for Toronto.

On September 9, 2013 the Canadians became just the third Northwest League team to win three straight championships, defeating the Boise Hawks, 5–0, at Scotiabank Field at Nat Bailey Stadium to win the final series, 2–1, in front of a sellout crowd. The 2013 season also saw the Vancouver Canadians draw over 195,000 fans to Scotiabank Field, a fifth consecutive team record which included 23 sold-out games.

On November 4, 2013, the Vancouver Canadians were named the 2013 recipient of the John H. Johnson President&#x27;s Award. The prestigious award is given to Minor League Baseball&#x27;s top organization. It was the first time that a Canadian-based franchise won MiLB&#x27;s top award.

In 2016, the Canadians led the Northwest League with a total attendance of 222,363, averaging 6,177 per game. This earned them the 2016 Esurance &quot;Home Field Advantage Award&quot; given to the organization in each affiliated minor league with the greatest attendance per percentage capacity. In 2017, the Canadians won another championship, defeating Eugene, 2–1, to win the series, 3–1. They beat their previous record in attendance with 239,527 people in total attendance for the 2017 season, averaging to 6,303 per game. On January 26, 2018, Toronto extended their player-development contract with Vancouver through the 2022 season.

While the Canadians were unable to make the playoffs in 2018, coming in a close second in both the first and second half of the season, they still lead the league in attendance with an impressive 239,086 in total attendance.

Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Minor League Baseball season was cancelled. In the winter of 2020 as part the reorganization of minor league baseball, Vancouver received an invitation to continue as the Blue Jays&#x27; High-A affiliate. In a further change, they were organized into the High-A West along with five other teams previously of the Northwest League.

The team began the 2021 season playing its home games at Ron Tonkin Field (the home field of the Hillsboro Hops) in Hillsboro, Oregon due to COVID-19 border restrictions. The Canadians finished 5th in 2021, missing out on playoffs.

Prior to the 2022 season, the High-A West became known as the Northwest League, the name historically used by the regional circuit prior to the 2021 reorganization. Vancouver finished 2nd in the 2022 season, qualifying for the first time to the new Northwest League playoffs system. Under the new playoffs system, a single best-of-5 series is played to determine the championship winner. Vancouver lost 3–0 to Eugene to finish runner-up.

In the 2023 season, the Canadians had the best overall record in the Northwest League at 77–54 and qualified for the playoffs by winning the first-half title with a 38–27 record. Vancouver defeated Everett 3–1 to win their first High-A Northwest League Championship.

The 2024 season saw the Canadians again qualify for the playoffs, but they lost the championship series 3–1 to Spokane.

==Early professional baseball in Vancouver==

Vancouver was an influential entity in the early history of the Northwest League. They were charter members of every version of the league that would eventually form the NWL, most notably as the sole team that survived the collapse of the Western International League (WIL) in 1922 when it reformed in 1937, winning four pennants in the WIL (1942, 1947, 1949, and 1954) as the Vancouver Capilanos (1939–1954). However, even though they were the final champions of the WIL, Vancouver was not part of its reformation into the Northwest League, due to the NWL&#x27;s shedding of all of its Canadian teams in order to focus on the American Pacific Northwest. Vancouver was without professional baseball in 1955, but in 1956 the highest calibre of minor league play, in the form of the Open classification Pacific Coast League, came to British Columbia when Oakland Oaks transferred there as the Vancouver Mounties. The Mounties played in the PCL from 1956 through 1962, and from 1965 through 1969.

<text>A barostat is a device used to maintain constant pressure in a closed chamber. Its main principle is providing constant pressures in a balloon by means of a pneumatic pump. Barostats are frequently used in neurogastroenterology research, where they are used for measuring gut wall tension or sensory thresholds in the gut.

A specially designed instrument is needed in neurogastroenterology research since the gut wall has an outstanding capacity to expand and contract spontaneously and by reflex. When this occurs, a balloon placed anywhere in the gut has to be inflated or deflated very rapidly in order to maintain a constant pressure in this balloon.

Barostat-balloon systems have been used anywhere in the gut, including the esophagus, stomach, small bowel, colon, and the rectum ampulla.

Computer-driven barostats have widely been used to assess sensation and pain thresholds in the gut. Assessment of pain thresholds in the ampulla recti has been proposed as diagnostic measure in irritable bowel syndrome.

<text>A model village is a mostly self-contained community, built from the late 18th century onwards by landowners and business magnates to house their workers. &quot;Model&quot; implies an ideal to which other developments could aspire. Although the villages are located close to the workplace, they are generally physically separated from them and often consist of relatively high-quality housing, with integrated community amenities and attractive physical environments.

==Great Britain and Ireland==
According to Jeremy Burchardt, the term model village was first used by the Victorians to describe the new settlements created on the rural estates of the landed gentry in the eighteenth century. As landowners sought to improve their estates for aesthetic reasons, new landscapes were created and the cottages of the poor were demolished and rebuilt out of sight of their country house vistas. However, according to the &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot; (2024), the first use of the term model village is post-Victorian, dating to 1906.

Starting in the 18th century, new villages were created at Nuneham Courtenay when the village was rebuilt as plain brick dwellings either side of the main road, at Milton Abbas the village was moved and rebuilt in a rustic style and Blaise Hamlet in Bristol had individually designed buildings, some with thatched roofs.

The Swing Riots of 1830 highlighted poor housing in the countryside, ill health and immorality and landowners had a responsibility to provide cottages with basic sanitation. The best landlords provided accommodation but many adopted a paternalistic attitude when they built model dwellings and imposed their own standards on the tenants charging low rents but paying low wages.

As the Industrial Revolution took hold, industrialists who built factories in rural locations provided housing for workers clustered around the workplace. An early example of an industrial model village was New Lanark built by Robert Owen. Philanthropic coal owners provided decent accommodation for miners from the early nineteenth century. Earl Fitzwilliam, a paternalistic colliery owner provided houses near his coal pits in Elsecar near Barnsley that were &quot;...of a class superior in size and arrangement, and in conveniences attached, to those of working classes.&quot; They had four rooms and a pantry, and outside a small garden and pig sty.

Others were established by Edward Akroyd at Copley between 1849 and 1853 and Akroydon 1861-63. Akroyd employed George Gilbert Scott. Titus Salt built a model village at Saltaire. Henry Ripley, owner of Bowling Dyeworks, began construction of Ripley Ville in Bradford in 1866. Industrial communities were established at Price&#x27;s Village by Price&#x27;s Patent Candle Company and at Aintree by Hartley&#x27;s, who made jam, in 1888. William Lever&#x27;s Port Sunlight had a village green and its houses espoused an idealised rural vernacular style. Quaker industrialists, George Cadbury and Rowntrees built model villages by their factories. Cadbury built Bournville between 1898 and 1905 and a second phase from 1914 and New Earswick was built in 1902 for Rowntrees.

As coal mining expanded villages were built to house coal miners. In Yorkshire, Grimethorpe, Goldthorpe, Woodlands, Fitzwilliam and Bottom Boat were built to house workers at the collieries. The architect who designed Woodlands and Creswell Model Villages, Percy B. Houfton was influential in the development of the garden city movement.

In the 1920s, Silver End model village in Essex was built for Francis Henry Crittall. Its houses were designed in an art deco-style with flat roofs and Crittall windows.

<text>Wizz Air Holdings Plc., stylized as W!ZZ, is a Hungarian ultra low-cost carrier group headquartered in Budapest, Hungary. The company includes subsidiaries Wizz Air Hungary, Wizz Air Malta, Wizz Air Abu Dhabi, and Wizz Air UK. The airlines serve numerous cities across Europe, as well as some destinations in North Africa, the Middle East, and South and Central Asia. As of 2023, the airline group has its largest bases at Budapest Ferenc Liszt International Airport, Bucharest Henri Coandă International Airport, and London Luton Airport and flies to 194 airports. Its parent company, Wizz Air Holdings plc, is registered in Jersey and listed on the London Stock Exchange and is a constituent of the FTSE 250 Index.

The oldest airline of the group is Wizz Air Hungary Ltd. () and has its head office in Budapest. Wizz Air Hungary has the largest fleet of any Hungarian airline.

==History==
===Foundation and early years===
Wizz Air Hungary was established in September 2003. The founder, József Váradi, was previously CEO of struggling Hungarian state-owned airline Malév Hungarian Airlines, until he was removed from office by the Medgyessy government in 2003. The lead investor is Indigo Partners, an American private equity firm specialising in transportation investments. The first flight was made from Katowice International Airport on 19 May 2004.

On 25 February 2015, Wizz Air shares began trading on the London Stock Exchange.

In November 2017, Wizz Air announced its planned launch of a British division called Wizz Air UK, based at London Luton mainly to take advantage of landing slots acquired when Monarch Airlines entered administration that year. The airline applied successfully to the CAA for an AOC and a Type A Operating Licence. The airline launched operations in March 2018 using British registered aircraft. Wizz Air UK was to start taking over UK-bound flights previously operated by Wizz Air, and plans called for the airline to employ up to 100 staff by the end of 2018.

In November 2019, Wizz Air dismissed concerns about its part in environmental damage raised by the &quot;flight shame&quot; movement, basing its response on the airline&#x27;s per-passenger emission level. The company said it would reduce per capita emissions by an additional 30 percent by 2030. Wizz Air also condemned inefficient airlines such as Lufthansa that offered business class and used outdated technologies, which according to Wizz Air cause far more environmental damage.

===Development since 2020===
By early 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic forced Wizz Air to ground its fleet. One-fifth of the staff were dismissed when it became clear that air travel across the continent was shutting down. In April 2020, Wizz Air became Europe&#x27;s largest low-cost airline with 78,000 passengers. By June, they had reached 40 percent of their previous year&#x27;s normal weekly revenue, while the proportion of no-shows fell from 80 percent in April to 30 percent. In July 2020, the airline announced that it would form a joint venture with the Abu Dhabi Developmental Holding Company. In October 2020, Wizz took delivery of an A330-200F cargo aircraft (HA-LHU, formerly Qatar Cargo), operating it on behalf of the Hungarian Government as &#x27;Hungary Air Cargo&#x27;.

In August 2021, company management announced that they plan to hire 4,600 new pilots by 2030, with the first part of their plan to train and hire nearly 500 pilots by the end of 2021. In September 2021, rival low-cost carrier EasyJet claimed it had rejected a takeover offer from Wizz Air. On 14 November 2021, on the first day of the Dubai Airshow, Wizz Air was one of four airlines that ordered additional A321neo jets. Wizz Air is due to receive a total of 75 A321neo and 27 A321XLRs, adding up to 102 new aircraft.

Following the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, four Wizz Air aircraft were stranded in Ukraine, three in Kyiv, and one in Lviv (the latter eventually being recovered and returned to service). In March 2022, amid the invasion, Wizz Air provided 100,000 free airline tickets to refugees for short-distance flights from Poland, Slovakia, Hungary and Romania. In May 2022, Wizz Air said it had signed a memorandum of understanding with Saudi Arabia&#x27;s Ministry of Investment to collaborate on potential investment and operating models to boost the country&#x27;s tourism industry and increase its connectivity. On 8 June 2022, the company signed a memorandum of understanding with European aircraft manufacturer Airbus to work on the development of hydrogen-powered aircraft.

In 2024 the company was named as the worst for flight delays in the United Kingdom for the third year in succession. On average flights departed over half an hour late. In 2024, Wizz Air had to ground hundred of planes after reported faults with Pratt &amp; Whitney&#x27;s geared turbofan engines. The CEO said he expected the issue to affect the fleet for two years while the aircraft are inspected. In September 2024, Wizz Air reported progress on the aircraft engine problems. The budget carrier had 41 aircraft grounded as of Sept. 30, six months earlier than it originally forecast. The company now expects to have 40-45 planes idled at a time over the next 18 months, down from the previous expectation of 50. In August 2024, the company announced an &quot;all you can fly&quot; subscription, costing €499 per year. The annual subscription sold out within 24 hours. Subscribers are charged an additional £8.90 per flight and have to pay extra for carry-on or checked luggage — only a small personal item is free.

==Corporate affairs==
=== Business trends ===
The key trends for the Wizz Air Group are (as at 31 March each year):
===Subsidiaries===
;Current subsidiaries
*Wizz Air Abu Dhabi was founded on 12 December 2019 as Wizz Air&#x27;s UAE subsidiary. The airline is a joint venture with state-owned Abu Dhabi Developmental Holding Company, which owns 51 per cent. Flights are operated from Abu Dhabi International Airport to destinations in Europe, Asia and Africa.
*Wizz Air UK was founded on 18 October 2017 as Wizz Air&#x27;s UK unit, following CAA approval the subsidiary commenced operations with 10 registered aircraft initially. The unit is currently operating flights from and to Luton on behalf of its Hungarian parent and has been set up to ensure Wizz Air retains full market access to the United Kingdom following Brexit.
*Wizz Air Malta was founded in 2022 and operated its first flight on 27 September 2022 from Rome Fiumicino to Malta International Airport.

;Former subsidiaries
*Wizz Air Bulgaria was Wizz Air&#x27;s Bulgarian unit set-up in 2005 and based at Sofia Airport with a fleet of 3 aircraft. It ceased operations on 31 March 2011, all flights merged back into Wizz Air Hungary Ltd.
*Wizz Air Ukraine, founded in 2008, was the Ukrainian unit of Wizz Air, which had its own air operator&#x27;s certificate and operated from Kyiv Zhuliany International Airport and Lviv International Airport with a fleet of 4 aircraft. As a result of the economic crisis caused by the Russo-Ukrainian War, Wizz Air Ukraine was terminated on 19 April 2015. Some routes to and from Kyiv were taken over by Wizz Air Hungary Ltd, while all others ceased. The airline eventually began expanding once again in Ukraine. As of October 2016, it operated flights to 13 cities in 7 countries from Kyiv.

== Incidents and accidents ==
*On 8 June 2013, Wizz Air Flight 3141, an Airbus A320-232 (registered as HA-LWM) with 165 passengers and 5 crew members on board, from Bucharest Henri Coandă Airport, Romania to Rome-Ciampino, Italy, made an emergency landing at Leonardo da Vinci–Fiumicino Airport when the crew encountered problems lowering the left main undercarriage and locking it into position. The aircraft diverted to Fiumicino for its longer runway, and firefighters applied foam after landing as a precautionary measure. The aircraft was evacuated using the emergency slides and three occupants were injured. Initial reports of injured passengers were denied by both Wizz Air and Rome Fiumicino Airport, who said some passengers requested medical checkups but reported no injuries.

<doc id="736713" wikidata="Q510675" url="?curid=736713" title="Disquisitiones Arithmeticae">
<text>(Latin for Arithmetical Investigations) is a textbook on number theory written in Latin by Carl Friedrich Gauss in 1798, when Gauss was 21, and published in 1801, when he was 24. It had a revolutionary impact on number theory by making the field truly rigorous and systematic and paved the path for modern number theory. In this book, Gauss brought together and reconciled results in number theory obtained by such eminent mathematicians as Fermat, Euler, Lagrange, and Legendre, while adding profound and original results of his own.

==Scope==
The &quot;Disquisitiones&quot; covers both elementary number theory and parts of the area of mathematics now called algebraic number theory. Gauss did not explicitly recognize the concept of a group, which is central to modern algebra, so he did not use this term. His own title for his subject was Higher Arithmetic. In his Preface to the &quot;Disquisitiones&quot;, Gauss describes the scope of the book as follows:

Gauss also writes, &quot;When confronting many difficult problems, derivations have been suppressed for the sake of brevity when readers refer to this work.&quot; (&quot;Quod, in pluribus quaestionibus difficilibus, demonstrationibus syntheticis usus sum, analysinque per quam erutae sunt suppressi, imprimis brevitatis studio tribuendum est, cui quantum fieri poterat consulere oportebat&quot;)

==Contents==

The book is divided into seven sections:

These sections are subdivided into 366 numbered items, which state a theorem with proof or otherwise develop a remark or thought.

Sections I to III are essentially a review of previous results, including Fermat&#x27;s little theorem, Wilson&#x27;s theorem and the existence of primitive roots. Although few of the results in these sections are original, Gauss was the first mathematician to bring this material together in a systematic way. He also realized the importance of the property of unique factorization (assured by the fundamental theorem of arithmetic, first studied by Euclid), which he restates and proves using modern tools.

From Section IV onward, much of the work is original. Section IV develops a proof of quadratic reciprocity; Section V, which takes up over half of the book, is a comprehensive analysis of binary and ternary quadratic forms. Section VI includes two different primality tests. Finally, Section VII is an analysis of cyclotomic polynomials, which concludes by giving the criteria that determine which regular polygons are constructible, i.e., can be constructed with a compass and unmarked straightedge alone.

Gauss started to write an eighth section on higher-order congruences, but did not complete it, and it was published separately after his death with the title &quot;Disquisitiones generales de congruentiis&quot; (Latin: &#x27;General Investigations on Congruences&#x27;). In it Gauss discussed congruences of arbitrary degree, attacking the problem of general congruences from a standpoint closely related to that taken later by Dedekind, Galois, and Emil Artin. The treatise paved the way for the theory of function fields over a finite field of constants. Ideas unique to that treatise are clear recognition of the importance of the
Frobenius morphism, and a version of Hensel&#x27;s lemma.

The &quot;Disquisitiones&quot; was one of the last mathematical works written in scholarly Latin. An English translation was not published until 1965, by Jesuit scholar Arthur A. Clarke. Clarke was the first dean at the Lincoln Center campus of Fordham College.

==Importance==
Before the &quot;Disquisitiones&quot; was published, number theory consisted of a collection of isolated theorems and conjectures. Gauss brought the work of his predecessors together with his own original work into a systematic framework, filled in gaps, corrected unsound proofs, and extended the subject in numerous ways.

The logical structure of the &quot;Disquisitiones&quot; (theorem statement followed by proof, followed by corollaries) set a standard for later texts. While recognising the primary importance of logical proof, Gauss also illustrates many theorems with numerical examples.

The &quot;Disquisitiones&quot; was the starting point for other 19th-century European mathematicians, including Ernst Kummer, Peter Gustav Lejeune Dirichlet and Richard Dedekind. Many of Gauss&#x27;s annotations are in effect announcements of further research of his own, some of which remained unpublished. They must have appeared particularly cryptic to his contemporaries; they can now be read as containing the germs of the theories of L-functions and complex multiplication, in particular.

The &quot;Disquisitiones&quot; continued to exert influence in the 20th century. For example, in section V, article 303, Gauss summarized his calculations of class numbers of proper primitive binary quadratic forms, and conjectured that he had found all of them with class numbers 1, 2, and 3. This was later interpreted as the determination of imaginary quadratic number fields with even discriminant and class number 1, 2, and 3, and extended to the case of odd discriminant. Sometimes called the class number problem, this more general question was eventually confirmed in 1986 (the specific question Gauss asked was confirmed by Landau in 1902 for class number one). In section VII, article 358, Gauss proved what can be interpreted as the first nontrivial case of the Riemann hypothesis for curves over finite fields (the Hasse–Weil theorem).

<text>The National University of Malaysia (, abbreviated as UKM) is a public research university located in Bandar Baru Bangi, Hulu Langat District, Selangor, Malaysia. Its teaching hospital, Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia Medical Centre (UKMMC), is located in Cheras and also has a branch campus in Kuala Lumpur. The university also has an overseas branch campus in Lusail City, Doha since 2023.

There are 170,500 undergraduate students enrolled, and 90,105 postgraduate students of which 40,368 are foreign students from 35 countries. Since its establishment in 1970, the Malay language was used as the university&#x27;s medium of instruction.

==History==
In 1968, Sabah Government&#x27;s Teachers Union (KGKS) and Angkatan Gaya Baru Sabah expressed their support for the establishment of UKM. The union in its statement said that the university&#x27;s establishment will &quot;provide a strong inspiration to students and the Malay intellectuals&quot;.

A Sponsoring Committee chaired by Syed Nasir Ismail, a Malay intellectual, was set up to prepare a report recommended the establishment of UKM. Other prominent members of this committee include Tun Dr. Mahathir Mohamad, Malaysia&#x27;s fourth Prime Minister, who was then the Education Minister, and Dr. Mohd Rashdan Haji Baba, who later became UKM&#x27;s first Vice-Chancellor.

Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia opened its doors on 18 May 1970 to 192 undergraduate students in Jalan Pantai Baru, Kuala Lumpur, a temporary campus housing three main faculties, the Faculties of Science, Arts and Islamic Studies. In October 1977, UKM moved to its present premises which form the main campus in Bangi. The campus has a size of . UKM has two health campuses, the Kuala Lumpur campus in Jalan Raja Muda Abdul Aziz, and the UKM Medical Centre in Cheras. The Kuala Lumpur campus consists of the Faculties of Health Sciences, Pharmacy, Dentistry and the Pre-Clinical Departments of the Medical Faculty. With a size of , the Kuala Lumpur campus was established in 1974.

The campus in Cheras consists of the Medical Faculty, the UKM Teaching Hospital (Hospital Canselor Tuanku Muhriz UKM (HCTM)) and the UKM Medical Molecular Biology Institute (UMBI). The Cheras campus was opened in 1997. Besides these campuses, UKM operates seven research stations (RS): The Tasik Chini RS, The Marine Ecosystem RS, The Langkawi Geopark RS, The Marine RS, The Fraser&#x27;s Hill RS, The Plant Biotechnology RS and in the main campus itself, the UKM Campus Living Laboratory, which comprises the UKM Permanent Forest Reserve, or its Malay name, Hutan Simpan Kekal UKM as well as the Fernarium and the Herbarium.

UKM was awarded the status of a Malaysian Research University in October 2006 by the Ministry of Higher Education, a move designed to try to propel the universities into leading research universities in line with the Higher Education Strategic Plan 2007–2020.

In 2006, UKM won the Prime Minister&#x27;s Quality Award.

In 2023, UKM established its first overseas branch campus in Lusail City, Qatar. The branch campus was established with the collaboration of The Regional Group of Qatar, who provided the facilities, infrastructure, equipments and meterials for the campus. The agreement to set up the Qatar campus was signed on 19 May 2022. The opening of the campus was inaugurated by Prime Minister Anwar Ibhrahim on 14 May 2024.

== Coat of arms ==

The current coat of arms of the UKM was first designed by university staffer Mohd Aris Atan and has been in use since 1972. It was modified to its present form by publications officer Zulkifli Ibrahim, which was launched on 29 July 2000 in conjunction with the university&#x27;s 30th anniversary, with stripes added to the tiger&#x27;s body. The arms is depicted as a quartered shield featuring an atomic symbol, a compass, a gear, a Malayan tiger and the national flower, Bunga Raya, or &quot;hibiscus rosa-sinensis&quot;, with an overlaid book placed on top of it. The atomic symbol represents science, the compasses and gear represent technology, the tiger represents strength and courage and the book represents knowledge. It is blazoned:

* Shield: &quot;Tierced per pall reversed, the dexter Or a conventional representation of an atom Sable, the sinister Azure a pair of Compasses erect and extended between a demi cogwheel Argent, the base Argent a Bunga Raya or hibiscus flower proper, a chief Gules thereon a tiger passant to the sinister also proper.&quot;
* Crest: &quot;An open book fesswise proper.&quot;

The first coat of arms of the university designed by the First Dean of the Faculty of Arts, Syed Muhammad Naquib al-Attas, was different from the present one. It was blazoned as:
 The crest featured a scroll inscribed with the words &#x27;Zidni Ilman&#x27;, which means increase me in knowledge, a reference to the word in Surah 20 Taha, Verse 114 of the Quran.

In 2010, the University&#x27;s corporate logo was created by its Centre for Corporate Communications, featuring the coat of arms accompanied by the names of the university in Malay and English. The Malay name (UNIVERSITI KEBANGSAAN MALAYSIA) is big and presented in upper case, with the letters U, K and M bigger than the rest. The English name (&quot;The National University of Malaysia&quot;) is small, italicised and presented in sentence case.

The National University of Malaysia is currently one of the three public universities in Malaysia to adopt its coat of arms, the other two are the University of Malaya and Universiti Sains Malaysia.

== Transportation access ==

=== Bangi campus ===
The Bangi campus is accessible by car through Jalan Bangi-Kajang (also known as Jalan Reko). 

The UKM KTM station is also connected to the northeastern side of the campus, but passengers from the railway station who wish to enter the campus must either use an e-hailing service, or walk to the KJ215 bus stop located around 200m away from the railway station, and then board the MRT feeder bus or the Zon 3 and Zon 4 bus (previously Zon 6) to enter the university compound.

Passengers from inside the campus could also travel to downtown Kuala Lumpur by taking the MRT feeder bus, which connects to Stadium Kajang MRT station and Kajang station, where passengers can then board the Kajang Line or Batu Caves-Pulau Sebang Line to continue their journey into downtown Kuala Lumpur.

For intra-campus travel between faculties and residential colleges, students can take the Zon 1, Zon 2, Zon 3, and Zon 4 buses, which came with 30 minutes frequency, except lunch time (1:00PM~2:00PM) and dinner time (7:00PM~8:00PM). These bus routes are free of charge and are operated by TMJ Travel &amp; Tours Sdn. Bhd. since 19 May 2024, before that they were operated by Kiffah Travel &amp; Tours Sdn. Bhd. 

Alternatively, students may also take the MRT feeder bus for intra-campus travel but a fee of RM1 will be charged as compared to the free Zon 1~4 buses.

=== Cheras campus ===
The campus is accessible by car through Jalan Yaacob Latif. The nearest MRT station to the Cheras campus is the Taman Midah MRT station, while the nearest LRT station is the Salak Selatan LRT station, and both stations can be reached by taking the MRT feeder bus. 

In the future, the campus will also be connected to the Jalan Yaacob Latif MRT station of the proposed MRT Circle Line, which will be located directly in front of the KKL Azman Hashim Sports Arena, and is expected to be completed and operational by 2032.

==Rankings==
When the &quot;Times Higher Education&quot; (THE) Guide University Rankings was published in October 2014, it was reported that UKM, along with Universiti Malaya, opted not to submit data for consideration. The UKM Strategic Centre deputy executive director Associate, Professor Dr. Masturah Markom, responded by saying that the rankings were unfair to the Malaysian educational context. She specifically cited the measurement of &quot;industry income&quot; in the THE methodology of university assessment, stating that Malaysian industry input cannot compete with other countries such as the United States of America. This is despite the fact that only a 2.5% weightage is allocated to &quot;industry income&quot; in the methodology, with more conventional categories such as teaching and research still making up 90%.

== Controversy ==

=== 2022 Convocation dress code ===
On 30 October 2022, an infographic poster published by the university and outlining the dress code for the upcoming 2022 convocation draws ire and went viral on social media. The poster in question shown examples of what attire is acceptable and unacceptable to be worn during the ceremony for both male and female graduates.

However, cheongsam and saree, both being the traditional dresses for Chinese and Indian women respectively, were listed as &quot;inappropriate&quot; and prohibited alongside short-sleeved blouse and knee-length skirt. This immediately sparked online accusations of racial discrimination or racial bias against the university. The poster hosted on the university&#x27;s website was then deleted on the same day.

A day later on 31 October 2022, UKM uploaded a revised version of its latest dress code guideline for the upcoming convocation. The new guidelines said graduands and guests attending the convocation ceremony will be allowed to wear &quot;baju kebangsaan&quot; (national attire), but it did not specify which national attire is allowed, only explicitly stating all items of clothing worn must be dark-coloured, fully sleeved and extend to one’s ankle.

=== Fahmi Reza ===

==== UKM frog logo ====
On 5 April 2021, Fahmi Reza, who is a political satirical artist and activist, uploaded an artwork resembling the coat of arms of UKM with the accompanying text &quot;Universiti Katak Kebangsaan&quot; (National Frog University), on his social media. The artwork was supposed to symbolise Communications Minister Saifuddin Abdullah’s reputation for political party hopping. Fahmi later claimed that “It is just a satirical, fictitious logo for a fictitious [frog] university that gave out that fictitious master’s degree” and has &quot;nothing to do with UKM&quot;.

Due to the resemblance of the artwork to UKM&#x27;s coat of arms, Fahmi Reza was hit with a letter of demand by UKM on 7 April 2021, claiming such artwork is an insult against the university and demanded him to delete the artwork from his social media within 7 days, failing which will result in legal action taken against him. However, Fahmi said he refuse to comply with such demand. Fahmi was also investigated and has his statement recorded by the Kajang police over the artwork.

==== &#x27;Kelas Demokrasi&#x27; shut down ====
In the month preceding the 15th General Election held on 19 November 2022, Fahmi Reza went on a tour at numerous universities around the country and held a forum titled &quot;Kelas Demokrasi&quot; (Democracy Class) with the aim to increase political literacy among the universities&#x27; youths. However, his &quot;Kelas Demokrasi&quot; forum held at the UKM Bangi campus on 10 November 2022, with over 200 students attending, was shut down by the university&#x27;s auxiliary police and security 10 minutes after it was started. UKM&#x27;s security shut down the sound system and told the crowd to disperse. UKM&#x27;s management said such event requires permission for it to be held on campus. The forum was later relocated to C&amp;P Coffee Company in Bandar Baru Bangi, which is located outside the campus.

=== Mohd Ekhwan Toriman&#x27;s resignation ===
On 3 February 2025, Mohd Ekhwan Toriman, the Vice-Chancellor of UKM since 2021 announced his resignation, effective 2 February 2025. Mohd Ekhwan in his resignation message also said &quot;Thank you for all the slander and accusations that have been thrown in my way, for which police reports and reports to the Malaysian Communications and Multimedia Commission (MCMC) have already been made&quot;. The police later confirmed they have received police reports from Mohd Ekhwan and two top management personnel of the university, and is investigating the case as a defamation case.

His resignation came amidst allegations that an audit has revealed his involvement in abuse of power, manipulation in the tender process and misappropriation of funds of the university. A Malay online tabloid alleged that Negeri Sembilan&#x27;s ruler and Chancellor of UKM, Tuanku Muhriz, was &quot;angered&quot; by the revelations and did not invite UKM&#x27;s top management to his birthday and titles awarding ceremony on 14 January of the same year. 

On 12 February 2025, Yang di-Pertuan Besar of Negeri Sembilan Tuanku Muhriz ordered the revocation of Mohd Ekhwan&#x27;s title &quot;Darjah Setia Bakti Negeri Sembilan&quot; (DBNS) with immediate effect. The Negeri Sembilan palace said this was done to &quot;uphold the dignity and honour of the Royal Institution in Negeri Sembilan&quot;.

<doc id="736725" wikidata="Q4589707" url="?curid=736725" title="1994 Mull of Kintyre Chinook crash">
<text>On 2 June 1994, a Chinook helicopter of the Royal Air Force (RAF), serial number &quot;ZD576&quot;, crashed on the Mull of Kintyre, Scotland, in foggy conditions. The crash resulted in the deaths of all twenty-five passengers and four crew on board. Among the passengers were almost all the United Kingdom&#x27;s senior Northern Ireland intelligence experts. The accident is the RAF&#x27;s fourth-worst peacetime disaster.

In 1995, an RAF board of inquiry ruled that it was impossible to establish the exact cause of the accident. This ruling was overturned by two senior reviewing officers, who stated that the pilots were guilty of gross negligence for flying too fast and too low in thick fog. This finding proved to be controversial, especially in light of irregularities and technical issues surrounding the then-new Chinook HC.2 variant which were uncovered, and in light of technical problems with the specific airframe involved in the weeks leading up to the crash. A Parliamentary inquiry conducted in 2001 found the previous verdict of gross negligence on the part of the crew to be &#x27;unjustified&#x27;. In 2011, an independent review of the crash cleared the crew of negligence and accepted that the RAF had falsely declared compliance with regulations in relation to the aircraft&#x27;s authority to fly.

==Incident==

===Crash===

Earlier on 2 June 1994, the helicopter and crew had carried out a trooping flight, as it was considered to be safer for British troops to fly around in certain parts of Northern Ireland at the time due to the threat posed by Provisional IRA attacks. This mission was safely accomplished and they returned to RAF Aldergrove (outside Belfast, Northern Ireland) at 15:20. They took off for Inverness at 17:42. Weather en route was forecast to be clear except in the Mull of Kintyre area. The crew made contact with military air traffic control (ATC) in Scotland at 17:55.

Around 18:00, Chinook ZD576 flew into a hillside in dense fog. The pilots were Flight Lieutenants Jonathan Tapper, 28, and Richard Cook, 30, both United Kingdom Special Forces pilots. There were two other crew. The helicopter was carrying 25 British intelligence experts from MI5, the Royal Ulster Constabulary and the British Army, from Aldergrove to attend a conference at Fort George (near Inverness) in Scotland. At the time of the accident, Air Chief Marshal Sir William Wratten called it &quot;the largest peacetime tragedy the RAF had suffered&quot;.

In the immediate aftermath of the accident, one commentator stated that the loss of so many top level Northern Ireland intelligence officers in one stroke was a huge blow to the John Major government, &quot;temporarily confounding&quot; its campaign against the IRA. That the crash killed so many British intelligence experts, without any witnesses in the foggy conditions, led to considerable speculation and conspiracy theories being devised regarding the potential of a cover-up. Among these were accusations that wake turbulence from a top-secret hypersonic US aircraft had been responsible for the crash, while another postulated that it was a deliberate assassination of the intelligence operatives on board in order to facilitate negotiations with republican factions during the then on-going Northern Ireland peace process.

===Initial inquiry===
In 1995, an RAF board of inquiry that investigated the incident determined that there was no conclusive evidence to determine the cause of the crash. An immediate suspicion that the helicopter could have been shot down by the Provisional IRA, with their known Strela 2 surface-to-air missile capability, had been quickly ruled out by investigators. A review of the evidence, carried out by two Air Chief Marshals of the Royal Air Force, found the two pilots to have been guilty of gross negligence by flying too fast and too low in thick fog. Both the incident and the first inquiry have been subject to controversy and dispute, primarily as to whether the crash had been caused by pilot error or by a mechanical failure. The 2011 Parliamentary report found the reviewing officers to have failed to correctly adhere to the standard of proof of &quot;absolutely no doubt&quot; in deciding the question of negligence.

==Subsequent inquiries==

The first inquiry and its conclusion proved to be highly controversial. A subsequent fatal accident inquiry (1996), House of Commons Defence Select Committee report (2000) and Commons Public Accounts Committee report have all either left open the question of blame or challenged the original conclusion. The campaign for a new inquiry was supported by the families of the pilots, and senior politicians, including former prime minister John Major and former defence secretary Malcolm Rifkind. The new inquiry took place in the House of Lords from September to November 2001. The findings were published on 31 January 2002, and found that the verdicts of gross negligence on the two pilots were unjustified.

In December 2007, Defence Secretary Des Browne agreed to conduct a fresh report into the crash. On 8 December 2008, Secretary of State for Defence John Hutton announced that &quot;no new evidence&quot; had been presented and the verdicts of gross negligence against the flight crew would stand. On 4 January 2010, doubts of the official explanation were raised again with the discovery that an internal MOD document, which had been written nine months prior to the incident, described the engine software as &#x27;positively dangerous&#x27; as it could lead to failure of both engines. The 2011 Review concluded that criticism that the original board had not paid enough attention to maintenance and technical issues was unjustified.

On 13 July 2011, the Defence Secretary Liam Fox outlined to MPs the findings of an independent review into the 1994 crash, which found that the two pilots who were blamed for the crash had been cleared of gross negligence. In doing so, the Government accepted Lord Philip&#x27;s confirmation that the Controller Aircraft Release was &quot;mandated&quot; upon the RAF. Issued in November 1993, the Controller Aircraft stated that the entire navigation and communications systems used on the Chinook HC2 were not to be relied upon in any way by the aircrew, and therefore it had no legitimate clearance to fly. Knowledge of this had been withheld from the pilots; by withholding this when issuing their Release to Service (RTS) (the authority to fly), the RAF had made a false declaration of compliance with regulations. In December 2012, the Minister for the Armed Forces, Andrew Robathan, confirmed such a false declaration did not constitute &quot;wrongdoing&quot;, despite it leading directly to deaths of servicemen.

==ZD576&#x27;s service history==

Boeing CH-47C Chinook, construction number B-868, RAF serial number ZD576 was originally delivered to the Royal Air Force as a Chinook HC.1 on 22 December 1983.

It was re-delivered to No 7 Squadron as a Chinook HC.2 on 21 April 1994. On arrival at RAF Odiham, its No. 1 engine had to be replaced due to a FADEC incident. Five days later, that same engine had to be replaced due to a second FADEC incident. On 10 May 1994, a post-flight fault inspection revealed a dislocated mounting bracket had caused the collective lever to have restricted and restrictive movement; this resulted in a &quot;Serious Fault Signal&quot; being sent as a warning to other UK Chinook operating units. On 17 May 1994, emergency power warning lights flashed multiple times and the No.1 engine was again replaced. On 25 May 1994, a serious incident occurred which had indicated the imminent failure of the No.2 engine.

On 31 May 1994, two days before the accident, two Chinook HC.1s were withdrawn from RAF Aldergrove and replaced by a single HC.2, ZD576.

==Possible causes==

===Pilot error===
Aviation safety author Andrew Brookes wrote that the true cause will never be known, but that pilot error induced by fatigue is likely to have played a part; the crew had been on flight duty for 9 hours and 15 minutes, including 6 hours flying time, before they took off on the crash flight. Had they made it to Fort George, they would have needed special permission from a senior officer to fly back to Aldergrove.

In his book, Steuart Campbell suggested that two errors by the pilots—failure to climb to a safe altitude upon entering cloud, and a navigational error made in the poor visibility (mistaking a fog signal station for a lighthouse)—together caused the crash. The Board of Inquiry had identified that several factors may have sufficiently distracted the crew from turning away from the Mull, and upon entering cloud, failed to carry out the correct procedure for an emergency climb in a timely manner.

RAF Visual Flight Rules (VFR) require the crew to have a minimum visibility of 5.5 kilometres above , or minimum visibility of one kilometre travelling below 140 knots; if VFR conditions are lost an emergency climb must be immediately flown. Nine out of ten witnesses interviewed in the inquiry reported visibility at ground level in the fog as being as low as ten to one hundred metres at the time of the crash; in-flight visibility may have been more or less than this. The tenth witness, a yachtsman who was offshore, reported it as being , though he is regarded as a less reliable witness as he changed his testimony.

If witness accounts of visibility are correct, the pilots should have transferred to Instrument Flight Rules, which would require the pilots to slow the aircraft and climb to a safe altitude at the best climbing speed. In the area around the Mull of Kintyre, the safe altitude would be above sea level, above the highest point of the terrain. The height of the crash site of ZD576 was , below the minimum safe level. The Board of Inquiry into the accident recommended formal procedures for transition from Visual Flight Rules to Instrument Flight Rules in mid-flight be developed, and the RAF has since integrated such practices into standard pilot training.

Regarding negligence on the part of the pilots, the 2011 Report said &quot;the possibility that there had been gross negligence could not be ruled out, but there were many grounds for doubt and the pilots were entitled to the benefit of it... [T]he Reviewing Officers had failed to take account of the high calibre of two Special Forces pilots who had no reputation for recklessness.&quot;

===FADEC problems===
At the time of the crash, new FADEC (Full Authority Digital Engine Control) equipment was being integrated into all RAF Chinooks, as part of an upgrade from the Chinook HC.1 standard to the newer Chinook HC.2 variant. The Ministry of Defence was given a £3 million settlement from Textron, the manufacturers of the system, after a ground test of the FADEC systems on a Chinook in 1989 resulted in severe airframe damage. Contractors, including Textron, had agreed that FADEC had been the cause of the 1989 incident and that the system needed to be redesigned.

The committee investigating the crash were satisfied that the destructive error in 1989 was not relevant to the 1994 crash. Information provided from Boeing to the investigation led to the following conclusion regarding FADEC performance: &quot;Data from the Digital Electronics Unit (DECU) of the second engine showed no evidence of torque or temperature exceedance and the matched power conditions of the engines post-impact indicate that there was no sustained emergency power demand. No other evidence indicated any FADEC or engine faults.&quot; It was expected that in a FADEC engine runaway, engine power would become asynchronous and mismatched. The investigation found the engines at the crash to have matched settings, decreasing the likelihood of a FADEC malfunction being involved.

EDS-SCICON was given the task of independently evaluating the software on the Chinook HC.2 in 1993. According to the House of Commons report: &quot;After examining only 18 per cent of the code they found 486 anomalies and stopped the review... intermittent engine failure captions were being regularly experienced by aircrew of Chinook Mk 2s and there were instances of uncommanded run-up and run-down of the engines and undemanded flight control movements&quot;.

Tests on the Chinooks performed by the MOD at Boscombe Down in 1994 reported the FADEC software to be &quot;unverifiable and ... therefore unsuitable for its purpose&quot;. In June 1994, the MoD test pilots at Boscombe Down had refused to fly the Chinook HC.2 until the engines, engine control systems and FADEC software had undergone revision. In October 2001, &quot;Computer Weekly&quot; reported that three fellows of the Royal Aeronautical Society had said that issues with either control or FADEC systems could have led to the crash.

The main submission to Lord Philip (see above) revealed that the FADEC Safety Critical software did not have a Certificate of Design, and was therefore not cleared to be fitted to Chinook HC2. It further revealed that John Spellar MP had been wrong when claiming the software was not Safety Critical, providing the original policy document governing this definition to Lord Philip.

===Other factors===
The onboard SuperTANS navigation computer, which retained only the last measured altitude, gave an altitude reading of . The investigation observed that it was possible for some of the avionics systems to interfere with the Chinook&#x27;s VHF radio, potentially disrupting communications.

Flight data recorders and cockpit voice recorders were not fitted to all RAF Chinooks at the time of the accident. The absence of these data greatly reduced the amount and quality of data available to subsequent investigations. Information on speed and height were derived from the position of cockpit dials in the wreckage and the condition of the wreckage. During 1994, the RAF had begun to fit these recording devices across the Chinook HC.2 fleet before the accident; this process was completed in 2002.

The aircraft had not been classified as airworthy. It was mandated upon the RAF that it was &quot;not to be relied upon in any way&quot;.

<text>Sir Oliver St John (; c. 1598 – 31 December 1673) was an English barrister, judge and politician who sat in the House of Commons from 1640-53. He supported the Parliamentary cause in the English Civil War.

== Early life ==
St John was the son of Oliver St John of Cayshoe and his wife Sarah Bulkeley, daughter of Edward Bulkeley of Odell, Bedfordshire and sister of Peter Bulkeley. Oliver St John of Cayshoe was the grandson of Oliver St John, 1st Baron St John of Bletso through the 1st Baron&#x27;s third son, Thomas St John. St John&#x27;s sister, Elizabeth St John, married Reverend Samuel Whiting and emigrated to Boston in the Massachusetts Bay Colony in 1636. 

St John matriculated from Queens&#x27; College, Cambridge at Lent 1616, and was admitted at Lincoln&#x27;s Inn on 22 April 1619. He was called to the bar in 1626. St John appears to have got into trouble with the court in connection with a seditious publication, and to have associated himself with the future popular leaders John Pym and Lord Saye. In 1638 he defended John Hampden, along with co-counsel Robert Holborne, on his refusal to pay Ship Money, on which occasion he made a notable speech which established him as a leading advocate. In the same year, he married as his second wife, Elizabeth Cromwell, a cousin of Oliver Cromwell, to whom his first wife also had been distantly related. The marriage led to an intimate friendship with Cromwell.

== Political career ==
In April 1640, St John was elected Member of Parliament for Totnes in the Short Parliament. He was re-elected MP for Totnes for the Long Parliament in November 1640. He acted in close alliance with Hampden and Pym, especially in opposition to the impost of Ship Money. In 1641, with a view to securing his support, the king appointed St John solicitor-general. This did not prevent him from taking an active role in the impeachment of Thomas Wentworth, 1st Earl of Strafford, and in preparing the bills brought forward by the popular party in the House of Commons. As a result, he was dismissed from the office of Solicitor General in 1643. He defended the decision to proceed against Strafford by way of attainder on the simple ground that there are people who are too dangerous to be given the benefit of the law; he told the Commons: &quot;it was never accounted cruelty or foul play for foxes and wolves to be knocked on the head.&quot; Edward Hyde, 1st Earl of Clarendon, although he may have voted in favour of the attainder, later denounced St. John&#x27;s speech as perhaps the most barbarous and inhumane ever made in the House of Commons.

On the outbreak of the Civil War, St John became recognised as one of the parliamentary leaders. In the quarrel between the parliament and the army in 1647 he sided with the latter, and was not excluded under Pride&#x27;s Purge in 1649. Throughout this period he enjoyed Cromwell&#x27;s confidence. Apart from Cromwell, he had few close friends: his manner was described as cold and forbidding, and he had little patience with those he regarded as less gifted than himself.

== Judicial and other activities ==

In 1648 St John was appointed Chief Justice of the Common Pleas and from then on he devoted himself to his judicial duties. He refused to act as one of the commissioners for the trial of King Charles I, and had no hand in the constitution of the Commonwealth. In 1651 he went to The Hague, where he led the mission (alongside Walter Strickland, with John Thurloe acting as his secretary) to negotiate a political union between England and the Dutch Republic. The mission failed entirely, leading to the First Anglo-Dutch War. In the same year he successfully conducted a similar negotiation with Scotland, after the Tender of Union. He became Chancellor of Cambridge University in 1651 and retained the post until 1660.

St John built Thorpe Hall at Longthorpe in Peterborough between 1653 and 1656. He was a member of the Council of State from 1659 to 1660.

== Apologia and exile ==
After the Restoration St John petitioned unsuccessfully to retain his office as Lord Chief Justice. He published an account of his past conduct (&quot;The Case of Oliver St John&quot;, 1660), and this apologia enabled him to escape any retribution worse than exclusion from public office. He retired to his country house in Northamptonshire until 1662, when he left England and went to Basel, Switzerland and afterwards to Augsburg, Germany.

== Family ==
St John married firstly Johanna Altham, only daughter of Sir John Altham of Latton, Essex, and by her had two sons and two daughters. In 1638 he married Elizabeth, daughter of Henry Cromwell, with whom he had two children. After her death he married, in 1645, Elizabeth Oxenbridge, daughter of Daniel Oxenbridge. His son Francis was MP for Peterborough. His daughter Johanna married Sir Walter St John of Lydiard Tregoze and was the grandmother of Viscount Bolingbroke. His third daughter, Elizabeth, married Sir John Bernard, 2nd Baronet and their daughter Johanna Bernard married Richard Bentley.

St John belonged to the senior branch of an ancient family. There were two branches: the St Johns of Bletsoe in Bedfordshire, and the St Johns of Lydiard Tregoze in Wiltshire, both descendants of the St Johns of Stanton St John in Oxfordshire. 

A distant cousin of the 4th Baron who was created Earl of Bolingbroke in 1624, Oliver took an active part on the parliamentary side of the English Civil War, his son, the 5th Baron St. John killed at the Battle of Edgehill. Oliver was a distant cousin of the King through Margaret Beauchamp of Bletso, grandmother of Henry VII, whose first husband was Sir Oliver St. John of Lydiard Tregoze (died 1437).

==Fictional portrayals==
Oliver St John plays a minor role in &quot;Traitor&#x27;s Field&quot; by Robert Wilton, published in May 2013 by Corvus, an imprint of Atlantic Books.

<doc id="736732" wikidata="Q1135214" url="?curid=736732" title="Wool church">
<text>A wool church is an English church financed primarily by donations from rich merchants and farmers who had benefitted from the medieval wool trade, hoping to ensure a place in heaven due to their largesse.

Wool churches are common in the Cotswolds and in the &quot;wool towns&quot; of upland East Anglia, where enormous profits from the wool business spurred construction of ever-grander edifices. A wool church was often built to replace a smaller or less imposing place of worship, in order to reflect the growing prosperity of the community in which it was situated. Many such building projects were undertaken by a small number of families in each village or town, who used the new church building to display their own wealth, status and faith. The building of wool churches largely ended with the English Reformation and the simultaneous decline of the wool trade between 1525 and 1600.

==Notable wool churches==

===Long Melford===
The Holy Trinity Church, Long Melford, Suffolk, is widely regarded as one of the finest wool churches in East Anglia. Built largely from 1467–1497 with funding from local cloth merchants, primarily John Clopton, the structure contains magnificent stained glass from the fifteenth century, the Clopton family chantry chapel and the soaring Lady Chapel, which extends at Holy Trinity&#x27;s east end. The Flushwork employed by the builders of Holy Trinity is some of the finest in England. The church stands as testimony to the wool business and its dizzying success in medieval times.
===Cirencester===
The Church of St. John the Baptist, Cirencester is the parish church for Cirencester, Gloucestershire. Dubbed &#x27;The Cathedral of the Cotswolds&#x27;, it is built of Cotswold stone and is one of the &quot;largest parish churches in England&quot;. It contains various tombs and monuments with some fragments of medieval stained glass and wall paintings. In 1508, major reconstruction took place funded by the wool trade making it an excellent example of a Wool church.

===Southwold===

Another grand Suffolk church is St. Edmunds in Southwold which retains medieval chancel screens.

===Cawston===
St. Agnes&#x27; Church at Cawston, Norfolk is also well known as a &quot;wool church.&quot; Its fifteenth century nave and western tower were financed by Michael de la Pole, Earl of Suffolk, who had grown rich from the wool business. As is typical of a &#x27;wool church,&#x27; St. Agnes&#x27;s scale is far grander than was required by a modest medieval village. And the Earl of Suffolk spared no expense in embellishing the interior: the de la Pole crest is carved above the entrance; French stone was used for the tower and nave; the roof, although the typical wooden East Anglian style, is an elaborate hammerbeam confection with elaborate angels curving off the beam ends, and a trio of angels on outstretched wings hovering over each clerestory window.

Clearly in East Anglian medieval times, sheep furnished the currency for architectural atonement.

===Worstead===
At St. Mary&#x27;s Church at Worstead, Norfolk, the village which gave its name to the cloth, the village church built by local weavers in the fourteenth-century towers over the small community, its tower jutting strikingly above the landscape. In other East Anglian communities, the wealth from wool poured in: Wymondham, Diss, North Walsham, East Harling, Attleborough, Aylsham. The churches basked in the refracted glory of wool wealth. Even in Norwich, which boasts more medieval churches than anywhere in Europe, it was wool money that got the stone lifted, the glass stained and the panels carved. Norfolk wool was best suited to heavier cloth, and so Norwich and Norfolk eventually gained almost a complete monopoly on worstead. Those profits fueled an extraordinary ecclesiastical building boom.

===Lavenham===

At Lavenham, Suffolk, the striking Perpendicular church is one of England&#x27;s largest parish churches. With its monumental flint and limestone tower, the Church of Saint Peter and Saint Paul, largely rebuilt in the fifteenth century in the prevailing style, dominates the small weaving village. It was financed largely by donations from two families; the Springs and the de Veres.

===Winchcombe===
St Peter&#x27;s Church, Winchcombe is another fine example of a Cotswold Wool Church. Situated close to the site of the former Winchcombe Abbey, the church is built in Cotswold stone in the traditional Wool Church style.

===St Clement&#x27;s, Ipswich===
St Clement&#x27;s Church, Ipswich was largely funded by the wool trade passing through the port. The tower was built by donations from wealthy wool merchants.

<text>The Vancouver Giants are a Canadian major junior ice hockey team playing based in Langley, British Columbia, and playing in the Western Hockey League (WHL). Founded in 2001, the Giants won the Ed Chynoweth Cup as league champions in 2006 and the Memorial Cup as Canadian junior champions in 2007. The team was based in the Pacific Coliseum in Vancouver, the former arena of the National Hockey League&#x27;s Vancouver Canucks, until moving to the Langley Events Centre in 2016.

==History==
British Columbia-based businessman Ron Toigo was granted a WHL expansion franchise for the city of Vancouver ahead of the 2001–02 season. In the following years, the club&#x27;s ownership group would grow to include Sultan Thiara, former Vancouver Canucks head coach Pat Quinn, the estate of Hockey Hall of Fame member Gordie Howe, and singer Michael Bublé. The team was first based out of Pacific Coliseum, the former Canucks arena in downtown Vancouver; in 2016, after 15 seasons, the team moved to the Langley Events Centre.

After a dismal inaugural season, typical for an expansion team, that saw the Giants win only 13 games, the team rapidly improved. In 2002, the Giants selected Gilbert Brule first overall in the WHL Bantam Draft—Brule would go on to become the team&#x27;s first major star player, beginning with winning the Jim Piggott Memorial Trophy as the WHL&#x27;s rookie of the year in 2004. That season, the team won its first playoff round, defeating the Kamloops Blazers before losing to the Everett Silvertips in the second round. Along with the Giants&#x27; improving play, the 2004–05 NHL lockout led to a boost in attendance for the club—nearly 9,000 fans attended the team&#x27;s season-opener, and the team averaged 8,400 spectators that season; Toigo later stated that the lockout was a definite factor in &quot;putting us on the map&quot;. The Giants capitalized by putting together a string of successful seasons that saw the team capture five consecutive B.C. Division titles between 2005 and 2010.

The run of success began with the hiring of former NHL coach Don Hay as head coach, replacing Dean Evason. Then, in 2005, general manager Scott Bonner acquired a number of key players including Kenndal McArdle, Wacey Rabbit, and goaltender Dustin Slade, who, along with Brule, would lead the team to its first championship. In 2006, the Giants captured their first league championship, defeating the Moose Jaw Warriors in the league final in four games, with Brule earning most valuable player honours. The win advanced the Giants to their first Memorial Cup tournament, in which they were eliminated in the semifinal by the host Moncton Wildcats. Despite the loss, Brule recorded 12 points in the tournament, the highest total in the tournament since 1997 and enough to secure the Ed Chynoweth Trophy as the leading scorer.

With the breakthrough of second-year forward Milan Lucic helping to make up for the off-season loss of Brule, the Giants returned to the WHL championship series in 2007 in a playoff run that also featured the debut of future star Evander Kane. In the final, they faced the Medicine Hat Tigers, narrowly losing the series in the second overtime period of game seven. However, the Giants were selected to host the 2007 Memorial Cup, which secured them a berth in the tournament despite their championship series defeat. The Giants secured a spot in the tournament final with an 8–1 semifinal win over the Plymouth Whalers, setting up a rematch with the Tigers. In the final, the Giants avenged their WHL title defeat with a 3–1 victory over the Tigers to secure the team&#x27;s first Memorial Cup championship. Lucic was named tournament MVP. In 2023, the 2007 Giants team was inducted into the B.C. Hockey Hall of Fame.

The Giants would set franchise records with 57 wins 119 points in 2008–09 and make consecutive runs to the Conference finals in 2009 and 2010. However, after the 2010, the team failed to win another playoff series until they returned to the championship final in 2019. During that stretch, Bonner stepped down as manager after 15 seasons, replaced first by Glen Hanlon and then, in 2018, by Barclay Parneta, who hired Michael Dyck as head coach. In the 2019 final, the Giants faced the regular season champion Prince Albert Raiders; the Giants fell behind in the series three games to one before forcing a decisive game seven in Prince Albert. In game seven, the Raiders won 3–2 in overtime, marking the second game seven overtime defeat in the finals in Giants history.

In 2022, the Giants made history by selecting Chloe Primerano in the thirteenth round of the WHL prospects draft, making Primerano the first-ever female skater selected in a Canadian Hockey League draft.

In 2023, when Michael Dyck left the organization to join the professional ranks, the Giants hired Manny Viveiros as their new head coach.

<text>Saturnino &quot;Nino&quot; Manfredi (22 March 1921 – 4 June 2004) was an Italian actor, voice actor, director, screenwriter, playwright, comedian, singer, author, radio personality and television presenter.

He was one of the most prominent Italian actors in the commedia all&#x27;italiana genre. During his career he won several awards, including six David di Donatello awards, six Nastro d&#x27;Argento awards and the Prix de la première oeuvre (Best First Work Award) at the 1971 Cannes Film Festival for &quot;Between Miracles&quot;. Typically playing losers, marginalised, working-class characters yet &quot;in possession of their dignity, morality, and underlying optimism&quot;, he was referred to as &quot;one of the few truly complete actors in Italian cinema&quot;.

== Life and career ==
=== Early life ===
Manfredi was born in Castro dei Volsci, Frosinone into a humble family of farmers. His father recruited in Public Safety, where he reached the rank of Maresciallo, and in the early 1930s, he was transferred to Rome, where Nino and his younger brother Dante spent their childhood in the popular neighborhood of San Giovanni. In 1937, he became seriously ill with bilateral pleurisy, and after a doctor gave him only three months to live, he remained several years hospitalized in a sanatorium; there he learned to play a banjo built by himself and he entered the musical band of the hospital. To please his family in October 1941, he enrolled at the university in the Faculty of Law, but already in the same year he showed an interest and a natural inclination for the stage, making his debut as a presenter and an actor in the theater of a parish in Rome.

After 8 September 1943, in order to avoid conscription, he took refuge for a year with his brother in the mountains above Cassino; returned to Rome in 1944, he resumed his university studies and, at the same time, he enrolled at the National Academy of Dramatic Art. In October 1945, he graduated in law with a thesis in criminal law, without ever practicing the profession, and in June 1947, he graduated from the academy.

=== Early career ===

Manfredi made his official stage debut in 1947, working in plays directed by Luigi Squarzina and Vito Pandolfi. The same year, he entered the Maltagliati-Gassman stage company, mostly acting in dramatic roles. 
In 1948, he entered the company of the Piccolo Teatro di Milano under Giorgio Strehler, playing in tragedies such as &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot; and &quot;The Storm&quot;. The same year he started working on radio as a comedian and an impersonator. In 1949, he made his film debut in the melodrama &quot;Monastero di Santa Chiara&quot;. In 1952, he worked with Eduardo De Filippo in &quot;Tre atti unici&quot;, along with Tino Buazzelli, Paolo Panelli and Bice Valori. The same year he entered the revue company of the Nava sisters, and started working as a voice actor and a dubber. In 1955, he took part to his first high-profile films, &quot;The Bachelor&quot; by Antonio Pietrangeli and &quot;Wild Love&quot; by Mauro Bolognini.

=== First successes ===

In 1958, Manfredi got his first film roles as main actor. The same year he formed a revue company with Delia Scala and Paolo Panelli, getting some success with the musical &quot;Un trapezio per Lisistrata&quot;. In 1959, the trio was chosen by RAI to host &quot;Canzonissima&quot;; the show marked the turning point of the career of Manfredi, who enjoyed a very large popularity, mainly thanks to the &quot;macchietta&quot; (i.e. comic caricature) of the &quot;Barman from Ceccano&quot;. The success immediately got him a contract with Dino De Laurentiis which he dropped after one year to be free to choose his favorite projects.

In 1962, Manfredi enjoyed an even larger success playing the title role in the stage musical &quot;Rugantino&quot;, with which he toured also in Canada, the US, and Argentina. The same year he directed the critically appreciated segment &quot;L&#x27;avventura di un soldato&quot; in the anthology film &quot;Of Wayward Love&quot;. In 1963 he starred in Luis García Berlanga&#x27;s masterpiece &quot;The Executioner&quot;.

=== Commedia all&#x27;italiana icon ===

Starting from the second half of the 1960s, Manfredi became a top actor at the Italian box office, starring in some of the most successful and critically acclaimed films in the Commedia all&#x27;italiana genre, often directed by Dino Risi. In 1969, with &quot;Nell&#x27;anno del Signore&quot;, he started a fruitful collaboration with the director Luigi Magni. In the same period he started collaborating, often uncredited, to the screenplays of his films.

In 1970, he enjoyed a large musical success with the Ettore Petrolini&#x27;s song &quot;Tanto pe&#x27; cantà&quot;; the song premiered, out of competition, at the Sanremo Music Festival and it peaked at third place on the Italian hit parade. In 1971, he made his feature film debut as director with the semi-autobiographical &quot;Between Miracles&quot;, with which he got almost unanimous critical acclaim, winning the Best Film Work Award at the Cannes Film Festival, the Italian Golden Globe for Best First Feature, two Silver Ribbons (for best screenplay and best original story) and a special David di Donatello. In 1972 he got a major television success playing Geppetto in the Luigi Comencini&#x27;s adaptation &quot;The Adventures of Pinocchio&quot;. In the 1970s and early 1980s, he continued alternating high-profile works and less ambitious comedies; among the most successful performances of the time, the emarginated immigrant of &quot;Bread and Chocolate&quot; (1973), the idealist worker of &quot;We All Loved Each Other So Much&quot; (1974), the old shanty town patriarch of &quot;Down and Dirty&quot; (1976), the Vatican&#x27;s magistrate of &quot;In the Name of the Pope King&quot; (1977), the abusive coffee-seller in &quot;Café Express&quot; (1980).
=== Later career ===
Following his last film as director (&quot;Portrait of a Woman, Nude&quot;) and two commercial hit films starred alongside Renato Pozzetto (&quot;Heads I Win, Tails You Lose&quot; and &quot;Questo e Quello&quot;), in the 1980s, Manfredi significantly slowed his cinema activities.

In 1983, he debuted as author with the book &quot;Proverbi e altre cose romanesche&quot;, while in 1984, he signed his first work as playwright and stage director (&quot;Viva gli sposi&quot;), an activity in which he gradually focused. In 1990 he received a David di Donatello career award. In 1992, after having first accepted to be a candidate at the elections with the Pannella List, he withdrawn the candidature to not give up his artistic commitments. In 1993, during the shooting of &quot;Un commissario a Roma&quot;, he suffered a hypoxia which compromised his memory functions. Starting from &quot;Un commissario a Roma&quot; his popularity revamped thanks to a series of successful RAI TV-series and miniseries, notably &quot;Linda e il brigadiere&quot;.

=== Last role and death ===
Manfredi&#x27;s last role was Galapago, an almost mute stranger with no memory in Miguel Hermoso&#x27;s Spanish drama film &quot;The End of a Mystery&quot;. On 7 July 2003, a few months after the release of the film, he was struck by a cerebral infarction in his home in Rome. In August, he received a Career Bianchi Prize at the Venice Film Festival. In September, an improvement allowed him to return home, but in December, he was hit by a new cerebral hemorrhage. After spending six months in a continuous alternation of improvements and deteriorations, he died on 4 June 2004, aged eighty-three years old.

== Personal life ==

Manfredi was married to model Erminia Ferrari from 1955 till his death. The couple had a son, Luca (who is a film and television director), and two daughters, Roberta (an actress, television presenter and producer) and Giovanna. He had another daughter, Tonina, from a Bulgarian woman.

From an early age, Manfredi suffered from a biliary disorder which forced him to a very strict diet, and his meals often consisted of just light tea or caffè d&#x27;orzo. He was an atheist. Active in volunteering, in 1991, he was nominated Goodwill Ambassador for UNICEF.

== Legacy ==
In 2007, an asteroid (73453 Ninomanfredi) was named after him. In 2009, a Nino Manfredi Prize was established at the Nastro d’Argento Awards. Manfredi also named a theatre in Ostia, Rome.

On the occasion of the tenth anniversary of his death, in 2014, Manfredi was remembered by &quot;Nino!&quot;, a series of events, held in various places including Los Angeles, New York, Rome and Paris, which included retrospectives, exhibitions, and the staging of an unreleased play of Manfredi. 

In 2017, his son Luca Manfredi directed a biographical film about Manfredi&#x27;s early years, &quot;In arte Nino&quot;; Manfredi was played by Elio Germano, while Miriam Leone played his wife Erminia.

==Early life==
He was born at the family home of Broughton Castle near Banbury, in Oxfordshire, the only son of Richard Fiennes, 7th Baron Saye and Sele, and his wife Constance, daughter of Sir William Kingsmill. He was educated at New College, Oxford. He was a descendant and heir of the sister of William of Wykeham, the college&#x27;s founder. Fiennes succeeded to his father&#x27;s barony in 1613.

==1620s==
During the latter part of James I&#x27;s reign, Saye was one of the most prominent opponents of the court. In 1621 he was active against Francis Bacon, and urged that he should be degraded from the peerage. In 1622 he opposed the benevolence levied by the king, saying that he knew no law besides parliament to persuade men to give away their own goods; he spent six months in the Fleet Prison, and then had a period of house arrest. When George Villiers, 1st Duke of Buckingham returned from Spain and proposed to break the Spanish match, the duke and baron became temporary allies. Saye became Viscount Saye and Sele in 1624. He pressed home the attack on Lionel Cranfield, 1st Earl of Middlesex.

In the parliament of 1626, Saye was back in opposition; he defended the privileges of the peerage against the new king Charles I in the cases of John Digby, 1st Earl of Bristol and Thomas Howard, 21st Earl of Arundel, and intervened on behalf of Dudley Digges when Buckingham accused him of speaking treason. In the autumn of the same year, he was among those who refused to pay the forced loan. In the parliament of 1628, he employed with success the right of peers to protest. In the debates on the Petition of Right, he opposed the reservations and amendments of the court party.

==Colonist==
During the personal rule of Charles I, Saye devoted time and money to schemes of colonisation: his motives were in part financial, but also religious and political.

===Providence Island===

In 1630 he established, together with Robert Greville, 2nd Baron Brooke, John Pym, and others from the group of Puritan entrepreneurs, a company to settle the Providence Island colony. It was to be developed on what is now known as Isla de Providencia in the Caribbean Sea, part of the Archipelago of San Andrés, Providencia and Santa Catalina, and a department of the nation of Colombia.

===New England===

Saye obtained a patent for a large tract of land on the Connecticut River on 19 March 1632 from Robert Rich, 2nd Earl of Warwick and the New England Company, again in association with Lord Brooke and ten others. 

They appointed John Winthrop the Younger to act as governor and established a fort at the mouth of the river, to which they gave the name of &quot;Sayebrook.&quot; Next they sent over a shipload of colonists. In 1633, Saye and Brooke also purchased a plantation at Cocheco or Dover, in what is now New Hampshire, from some Bristol merchants. 

The two men both contemplated settling in New England, but they demanded that an emigrant hereditary aristocracy be established as a preliminary, from which the governors were to be chosen. After Saye&#x27;s constitutional idea received a hostile reception, the partners in the colony compromised to obtain colonists.

===Aftermath===
Saye concentrated his energies on the settlement of Providence Island, while spreading disparaging reports about New England, including its climate and land. He soon abandoned his enterprises there and surrendered his rights. The New Hampshire settlements were made over to Massachusetts in 1641, and Sayebrook was sold to Connecticut three years later.

Saye was one of the commissioners for the government from Westminster of the plantations appointed on 2 November 1643.

Old Saybrook, Connecticut is named after Viscount Saye and Lord Brooke.

==1630s politics==
Leading puritans, including John Pym, who were members of the Providence Island Company met Saye at Broughton Castle to coordinate their opposition to the King. On several occasions, Saye outwitted the advisers of Charles I by his strict compliance with legal forms, earning him the nickname &quot;old subtlety&quot;.

Although Saye resisted the levy of ship money, he accompanied Charles on his march against the Scots in 1639; but, with only one other peer, he refused to take the oath binding him to fight for the king &quot;to the utmost of my power and hazard of my life&quot;. Then Charles I sought to win his favour by making him a Privy Councillor and Master of the Court of Wards.

==Civil War and Restoration==
When the Civil War broke out, however, Saye was on the committee of safety. He was appointed as Lord Lieutenant of Gloucestershire, Oxfordshire and Cheshire, and raised a regiment that occupied Oxford. He was a member of the committee of both kingdoms; was mainly responsible for passing the self-denying ordinance through the House of Lords; and in 1647 stood up for the army in its struggle with the parliament.

In 1648, both at the treaty of Newport and elsewhere, Saye was anxious that Charles should come to terms. After the king was executed, Saye retired into private life. In 1656 he recovered £500 damages from James Whinnel, gentleman of Wisbech. He agreed to donate £100 to the town of Wisbech in the Isle of Ely, with the interest to be used for providing clothing for the poor and administered by his son Richard Fiennes. 

Saye became a privy counsellor again upon the restoration of Charles II. He died at Broughton Castle on 14 April 1662.

==Family==
Fiennes married Elizabeth, youngest daughter of John Temple of Stowe, in 1600. She was born in May 1585 and was about fifteen at marriage. Their eldest son James (c. 1603–1674) succeeded him as 2nd viscount; other sons were the Parliamentarians Nathaniel Fiennes and John Fiennes. His daughter Bridget married her remote cousin Theophilus Clinton, 4th Earl of Lincoln, son of the 3rd Earl of Lincoln. Another daughter Ann married Sir Charles Wolseley, 2nd Baronet.

The viscounty of Saye and Sele became extinct in 1781, and the barony was subsequently held by the descendants of John Twisleton (died 1682) and his wife Elizabeth (died 1674), a daughter of the 2nd viscount.

<text>Hermitage is a village and civil parish, near Newbury, in the English county of Berkshire. The civil parish is made up of a number of settlements: Hermitage village, Little Hungerford and Wellhouse.

==Location==
The village is focused residentially on the B4009, north east of Newbury in the heart of the North Wessex Downs, an Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty. It is thus surrounded by protected woodlands and undulating fields providing a few elevated viewpoints.

==History==
On Oare Common are two curvilinear ditched enclosures which are probably of prehistoric date, although it has also been suggested that they may represent a motte and bailey castle. The hill fort of Grimsbury Castle is in Grimsbury Wood. A folly stands at its centre. A 2nd and 3rd century Roman villa of some pretensions was discovered at Wellhouse in the Victorian era. Between 1917 and 1918 D. H. Lawrence lived in Hermitage, at Chapel Farm Cottage in Chapel Lane. His novella &quot;The Fox&quot; is set in the area, with Bailey Farm based on Grimsby Farm. Three early 21st century housing areas were completed in the north and south. These include Forest Edge and Hermitage Green.

==Amenities==
It has a general store and post office, a church (Holy Trinity) and two public houses, The Fox and The White Horse of Hermitage, and a garden centre. The village primary school feeds into the Downs School. The area is predominantly agricultural and the main local employers are the village school, village pre-school, the garden centre and a small light industrial unit housing several small businesses.

Holy Trinity church dates from 1839, and was funded by local donations, under the patronage of the Marquess of Downshire who had a residence at Easthampstead Park near Bracknell, from Hermitage. The Dowager Queen Adelaide, widow of the late King William IV, gave the communion plate.

==Transport==
Access to the M4, which links London to Bristol and South Wales, is within and it passes through the edge of the parish. The A34, a major north–south road, also passes through the edge of the parish. From 1882 until the 1960s the village was served by Hermitage railway station, on the Didcot, Newbury and Southampton Railway. As of July 2022, Hermitage is served by buses 6 and 6A from Newbury.

<text>Nathaniel Fiennes, 1608 to 16 December 1669, was a younger son of the Puritan nobleman and politician, William Fiennes, 1st Viscount Saye and Sele. He sat in the House of Commons at various times between 1640 and 1659, and served with the Parliamentarian army in the First English Civil War. In 1643, he was dismissed from the army for alleged incompetence after surrendering Bristol and sentenced to death before being pardoned. Exonerated in 1645, he actively supported Oliver Cromwell during The Protectorate, being Lord Keeper of the Great Seal from 1655 to 1659. 

Elected to the Long Parliament in November 1640, Fiennes played a leading role in the opposition to Charles I prior to the outbreak of civil war in August 1642. In the early years of the war, his objections to any form of established church aligned him with Cromwell and the Independents, rather than the moderate Presbyterians who dominated Parliament. However, his belief in a balanced political solution meant that after Parliament&#x27;s victory in 1646, he supported a compromise peace settlement with Charles I. As a result, he was one of the MPs excluded by Pride&#x27;s Purge in December 1648 along with his younger brother John Fiennes, and played no part in the Execution of Charles I. 

Fiennes re-entered politics when Cromwell became Lord Protector in 1653, sitting as an MP in the Second and Third Protectorate Parliaments, as well as being made Lord Keeper of the Great Seal in June 1655. After Cromwell died in September 1658, he backed the succession of his son Richard Cromwell as Lord Protector, but lost office when the latter resigned in April 1659. Following the 1660 Stuart Restoration, he was pardoned under the Indemnity and Oblivion Act, and lived quietly at home in Newton Tony, Wiltshire, until his death on 16 December 1669. 

==Personal details==
Nathaniel Fiennes was born 1608 at Broughton Castle, Oxfordshire, second son of William Fiennes, 1st Viscount Saye and Sele (1582–1662), and Elizabeth Temple (died 1648). Siblings included his elder brother James (1602–1674), Bridget, John (1612–1708), Constance and Elizabeth. 

He was twice married, the first time in August 1636 to Elizabeth Eliot (1616–1648?), daughter of Sir John Eliot, an MP who played a leading role in passing the 1628 Petition of Right; he was later imprisoned by Charles I in the Tower of London, where he died in 1632. They had two surviving sons, Nathaniel (1637–1672), who inherited his fathers&#x27; estates, and William (1639–1698), who succeeded his uncle James as Third Viscount Saye and Sele in 1674. 

Elizabeth died sometime before 1650 when Fiennes married again, this time to Frances Whitehead (1621–1691). They had four daughters, Anne, Frances, Mary (1663–1737) and Celia (1662–1741), later well known for a series of books recording her travels around Britain.

Fiennes attended Winchester College, then entered New College, Oxford in 1619. He graduated in 1624 without a degree, but was made a perpetual fellow of the college as &quot;founder&#x27;s kin&quot;. Like his Puritan father, he strongly opposed Laudianism and Episcopacy in any form, opinions strengthened by his residence in the Calvinist stronghold of Geneva. 

He returned to Scotland in 1639, and established communications with the Covenanters and the Opposition in England. As Member of Parliament for Banbury in both the Short and Long Parliaments he took a prominent part in the attacks upon the church.

He spoke against the illegal canons on 14 December 1640, and again on 9 February 1641 on the occasion of the reception of the Root and Branch petition, when he argued against episcopacy as constituting a political as well as a religious danger and made an impression on the House of Commons, his name being added immediately to the committee appointed to deal with church affairs.

He took a leading part in the examination into the army plot; was one of the commissioners appointed to attend the king to Scotland in August 1641; and was nominated one of the committee of safety in July 1642. On the outbreak of hostilities he took arms immediately, commanded a troop of horse in the army of Lord Essex, was present at the relief of Coventry in August, and at the fight at Powick Bridge, Worcester in September, where he distinguished himself, and subsequently at Edgehill. Of the last two engagements he wrote accounts, viz. &quot;True and Exact Relation of both the Battles fought by ... Earl of Essex against the Bloudy Cavaliers&quot; (1642). (See also &quot;A Narrative of the Late Battle before Worcester taken by a Gentleman of the Inns of Court from the mouth of Master Fiennes&quot;, 1642).

In February 1643, Fiennes was sent down to Bristol, arrested Colonel Thomas Essex the governor, executed the two leaders of a plot (Robert Yeamans and George Bouchier) to deliver up the city, and received a commission himself as governor on 1 May 1643. On the arrival, however, of Prince Rupert on 22 July, although the place was in no condition to resist an attack, Fiennes held out until Rupert&#x27;s troops had forced an entry into the city and further resistance was both hopeless and a waste of life. He addressed to Essex a letter in his defence (&quot;Thomason Tracts&quot; E. 65, 26), drew up for the parliament a &quot;Relation concerning the Surrender ...&quot; (1643), answered by William Prynne and Clement Walker accusing him of treachery and cowardice, to which he opposed Col. Fiennes his &quot;Reply&quot; &quot;...&quot;. Dorothy Hazzard a local preacher gave evidence against him.

He was tried at St Albans by the council of war in December, was pronounced guilty of having surrendered the place improperly, and sentenced to death. He was, however, pardoned, and the facility with which Bristol subsequently capitulated to the parliamentary army induced Cromwell and the generals to exonerate him completely. His military career nevertheless came to an end. He went abroad, and it was some time before he reappeared on the political scene.

There has been debate over the legitimacy of the indictments brought against him by Walker and Prynne. Both had lost considerable amounts of money and property in the fall of Bristol and both were politically opposed to Fiennes and his family. Many of the witnesses at the trial could possibly have been politically motivated and there is some evidence Fiennes was the victim of a wider political campaign against his family&#x27;s political faction. After Bristol was recaptured in 1645, it became clear the problems he faced in 1643 had not been exaggerated, and he was restored as an MP. 

In September 1647, he was included in the army committee, and on 3 January he became a member of the committee of safety. He was, however, in favour of accepting the King&#x27;s terms at Newport in December, and in consequence was excluded from the House by Pride&#x27;s Purge. An opponent of church government in any form, he was opposed to the Presbyterianism of the day, and inclined to Independency and Cromwell&#x27;s party. He was a member of the council of state in 1654, and in June 1655 he received the appointment of commissioner for the custody of the great seal, for which he was poorly suited.

In the First Protectorate Parliament of 1654 he was returned for Oxfordshire and in the Second Protectorate Parliament of 1656 for Oxford University. In January 1658 he was included in Cromwell&#x27;s House of Lords. He was in favour of the Protector&#x27;s assumption of the royal title and urged his acceptance of it on several occasions. His public career closes with addresses delivered in his capacity as chief commissioner of the great seal at the beginning of the sessions of 20 January 1658, and 2 January 1659, in which the religious basis of Cromwell&#x27;s government is especially insisted upon, the feature to which Fiennes throughout his career had attached most value. He lived at No. 1 Great Piazza, Covent Garden from 1657 to 1659.

On the reassembling of the Long Parliament he was superseded; he took no part in the Restoration, and died at Newton Tony in Wiltshire on 16 December 1669.

==Works==
Besides the pamphlets already cited, a number of his speeches and other political tracts were published (see &quot;Gen. Catalogue&quot;, British Museum). Wood also attributed to him &quot;Monarchy Asserted&quot; (1660) (reprinted in Somers &quot;Tracts&quot;, vi. 346 ), but there seems no reason to ascribe to him with Clement Walker the authorship of Joshua Sprigge&#x27;s &quot;Anglia Rediviva&quot;.

<doc id="736781" wikidata="Q255808" url="?curid=736781" title="Maria Ouspenskaya">
<text>Maria Alekseyevna Ouspenskaya (; 29 July 1876 – 3 December 1949) was a Russian actress and acting teacher. She achieved success as a stage actress as a young woman in Russia, and as an older woman in Hollywood films. She was twice nominated for the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress for &quot;Dodsworth&quot; (1936) and &quot;Love Affair&quot; (1939).

==Life and career==
Ouspenskaya was born in Tula, Tsarist Russia. She studied singing in Warsaw and acting in Moscow. She was a founding member of the First Studio, a theatre studio of the Moscow Art Theatre. There she was trained by Konstantin Stanislavsky and his assistant Leopold Sulerzhitsky.

The Moscow Art Theatre traveled widely throughout Europe, and when it arrived in New York City in 1922, Ouspenskaya decided to stay there. She performed regularly on Broadway over the next decade. She taught acting to Lee Strasberg among others, at the American Laboratory Theatre, and in 1929, together with Richard Boleslawski, her colleague from the Moscow Art Theatre, she founded the School of Dramatic Art in New York City. One of Ouspenskaya&#x27;s students at the school was an unknown teenaged Anne Baxter.

Although she had appeared in a few Russian silent films many years earlier, Ouspenskaya stayed away from Hollywood until her school&#x27;s financial problems forced her to look for ways to repair her finances. According to ads from &quot;Popular Song&quot; magazine in the 1930s, around this time Ouspenskaya also opened the Maria Ouspenskaya School of Dance on Vine Street in Los Angeles. Her pupils included Marge Champion, the model for Disney&#x27;s &quot;Snow White&quot;.

In spite of her marked Russian accent, she did find work in Hollywood, playing European characters of various national origins. Her first Hollywood role was in &quot;Dodsworth&quot; (1936), which brought her a nomination for an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress. (Her onscreen appearance in that film was one of the briefest ever to garner a nomination.) She received a second Oscar nomination for her role in &quot;Love Affair&quot; (1939).

She portrayed Maleva, an old Romani fortuneteller in the horror films &quot;The Wolf Man&quot; (1941) and &quot;Frankenstein Meets the Wolf Man&quot; (1943), both with Lon Chaney Jr. and Bela Lugosi. Her films depicting World War II were Frank Borzage&#x27;s &quot;The Mortal Storm&quot; (1940), and Darryl F. Zanuck&#x27;s &quot;The Man I Married&quot; (1940). Other films in which she appeared were: &quot;The Rains Came&quot; (1939), &quot;Waterloo Bridge&quot; (1940), &quot;Beyond Tomorrow&quot; (1940), &quot;Dance, Girl, Dance&quot; (1940), &quot;Dr. Ehrlich&#x27;s Magic Bullet&quot; (1940), and &quot;Kings Row&quot; (1942).

==Death==
Ouspenskaya died several days after suffering a stroke and receiving severe burns in a house fire, which was reportedly caused when she fell asleep while smoking a cigarette. She was buried in Glendale&#x27;s Forest Lawn Memorial Park Cemetery.

==Famous quotes==
In the film &quot;The Wolf Man&quot;, Maleva, The Gypsy Woman (played by Maria Ouspenskaya) utters her iconic quote as the Wolf Man is dying:

&quot;The way you walked was thorny, through no fault of your own, but as the rain enters the soil, the river enters the sea, so tears run to a predestined end. Your suffering is over. Now you will find peace for eternity.&quot;

==In popular culture==
Bosley Crowther, criticizing the 1963 film &quot;Kings of the Sun&quot; for &quot;The New York Times&quot;, says about Richard Basehart&#x27;s performance: &quot;As the high priest of the Mayans, swathed in dirty dresses and adorned with a mountainous gray wig, he looks exactly like the late Maria Ouspenskaya.&quot;

In February 2024, an award-winning documentary &quot;She-Wolf in Hollywood:&quot; &quot;The Story of Maria Ouspenskaya&quot; (using material from Ouspenskaya&#x27;s archives at UCLA) became available on YouTube.

<doc id="736803" wikidata="Q2319304" url="?curid=736803" title="Expected utility hypothesis">
<text>The expected utility hypothesis is a foundational assumption in mathematical economics concerning decision making under uncertainty. It postulates that rational agents maximize utility, meaning the subjective desirability of their actions. Rational choice theory, a cornerstone of microeconomics, builds this postulate to model aggregate social behaviour.

The expected utility hypothesis states an agent chooses between risky prospects by comparing expected utility values (i.e., the weighted sum of adding the respective utility values of payoffs multiplied by their probabilities). The summarised formula for expected utility is formula_1 where formula_2 is the probability that outcome indexed by formula_3 with payoff formula_4 is realized, and function &quot;u&quot; expresses the utility of each respective payoff. Graphically the curvature of the u function captures the agent&#x27;s risk attitude.

Standard utility functions represent ordinal preferences. The expected utility hypothesis imposes limitations on the utility function and makes utility cardinal (though still not comparable across individuals).

Although the expected utility hypothesis is standard in economic modeling, it is violated in psychological experiments. Psychologists and economic theorists have been developing new theories to explain these deficiencies for many years. These include prospect theory, rank-dependent expected utility and cumulative prospect theory, and bounded rationality.

== Justification ==

=== Bernoulli&#x27;s formulation ===
Nicolaus Bernoulli described the St. Petersburg paradox (involving infinite expected values) in 1713, prompting two Swiss mathematicians to develop expected utility theory as a solution. Bernoulli&#x27;s paper was the first formalization of marginal utility, which has broad application in economics in addition to expected utility theory. He used this concept to formalize the idea that the same amount of additional money was less useful to an already wealthy person than it would be to a poor person. The theory can also more accurately describe more realistic scenarios (where expected values are finite) than expected value alone. He proposed that a nonlinear function of the utility of an outcome should be used instead of the expected value of an outcome, accounting for risk aversion, where the risk premium is higher for low-probability events than the difference between the payout level of a particular outcome and its expected value. Bernoulli further proposed that it was not the goal of the gambler to maximize his expected gain but to maximize the logarithm of his gain instead.

Daniel Bernoulli drew attention to psychological and behavioral components behind the individual&#x27;s decision-making process and proposed that the utility of wealth has a diminishing marginal utility. For example, an extra dollar or an additional good is perceived as less valuable as someone gets wealthier. In other words, desirability related to a financial gain depends on the gain itself and the person&#x27;s wealth. Bernoulli suggested that people maximize &quot;moral expectation&quot; rather than expected monetary value. Bernoulli made a clear distinction between expected value and expected utility. Instead of using the weighted outcomes, he used the weighted utility multiplied by probabilities. He proved that the utility function used in real life is finite, even when its expected value is infinite.

=== Ramsey-theoretic approach to subjective probability ===
In 1926, Frank Ramsey introduced Ramsey&#x27;s Representation Theorem. This representation theorem for expected utility assumes that preferences are defined over a set of bets where each option has a different yield. Ramsey believed that we should always make decisions to receive the best-expected outcome according to our personal preferences. This implies that if we can understand an individual&#x27;s priorities and preferences, we can anticipate their choices. In this model, he defined numerical utilities for each option to exploit the richness of the space of prices. The outcome of each preference is exclusive of each other. For example, if you study, you can not see your friends. However, you will get a good grade in your course. In this scenario, we analyze personal preferences and beliefs and will be able to predict which option a person might choose (e.g., if someone prioritizes their social life over academic results, they will go out with their friends). Assuming that the decisions of a person are rational, according to this theorem, we should be able to know the beliefs and utilities of a person just by looking at the choices they make (which is wrong). Ramsey defines a proposition as &quot;ethically neutral&quot; when two possible outcomes have an equal value. In other words, if the probability can be defined as a preference, each proposition should have to be indifferent between both options.
Ramsey shows that

=== Savage&#x27;s subjective expected utility representation ===
In the 1950s, Leonard Jimmie Savage, an American statistician, derived a framework for comprehending expected utility. Savage&#x27;s framework involved proving that expected utility could be used to make an optimal choice among several acts through seven axioms. In his book, &quot;The Foundations of Statistics&quot;, Savage integrated a normative account of decision making under risk (when probabilities are known) and under uncertainty (when probabilities are not objectively known). Savage concluded that people have neutral attitudes towards uncertainty and that observation is enough to predict the probabilities of uncertain events. A crucial methodological aspect of Savage&#x27;s framework is its focus on observable choices—cognitive processes and other psychological aspects of decision-making matter only to the extent that they directly impact choice.

The theory of subjective expected utility combines two concepts: first, a personal utility function, and second, a personal probability distribution (usually based on Bayesian probability theory). This theoretical model has been known for its clear and elegant structure and is considered by some researchers to be &quot;the most brilliant axiomatic theory of utility ever developed.&quot; Instead of assuming the probability of an event, Savage defines it in terms of preferences over acts. Savage used the states (something a person doesn&#x27;t control) to calculate the probability of an event. On the other hand, he used utility and intrinsic preferences to predict the event&#x27;s outcome. Savage assumed that each act and state were sufficient to determine an outcome uniquely. However, this assumption breaks in cases where an individual does not have enough information about the event.

Additionally, he believed that outcomes must have the same utility regardless of state. Therefore, it is essential to identify which statement is an outcome correctly. For example, if someone says, &quot;I got the job,&quot; this affirmation is not considered an outcome since the utility of the statement will be different for each person depending on intrinsic factors such as financial necessity or judgment about the company. Therefore, no state can rule out the performance of an act. Only when the state and the act are evaluated simultaneously is it possible to determine an outcome with certainty.

==== Savage&#x27;s representation theorem ====
The Savage representation theorem (Savage, 1954) A preference &lt; satisfies P1–P7 if and only if there is a finitely additive probability measure P and a function u : C → R such that for every pair of acts &quot;f&quot; and &quot;g&quot;.
&quot;f&quot; &lt; &quot;g&quot; ⇐⇒ Z Ω &quot;u&quot;(&quot;f&quot;(&quot;ω&quot;)) &quot;dP&quot; ≥ Z Ω &quot;u&quot;(&quot;g&quot;(&quot;ω&quot;)) &quot;dP&quot; 
*If and only if all the axioms are satisfied, one can use the information to reduce the uncertainty about the events that are out of their control. Additionally, the theorem ranks the outcome according to a utility function that reflects personal preferences.

The key ingredients in Savage&#x27;s theory are:

* &quot;States:&quot; The specification of every aspect of the decision problem at hand or &quot;A description of the world leaving no relevant aspect undescribed.&quot;
* &quot;Events:&quot; A set of states identified by someone
* &quot;Consequences:&quot; A consequence describes everything relevant to the decision maker&#x27;s utility (e.g., monetary rewards, psychological factors, etc.)
* Acts: An act is a finite-valued function that maps states to consequences.

=== Von Neumann–Morgenstern utility theorem ===
==== The von Neumann–Morgenstern axioms ====
There are four axioms of the expected utility theory that define a &quot;rational&quot; decision maker: completeness; transitivity; independence of irrelevant alternatives; and continuity.

&quot;Completeness&quot; assumes that an individual has well-defined preferences and can always decide between any two alternatives.
* Axiom (Completeness): For every formula_6 and formula_7 either formula_8 or formula_9 or both.
This means that the individual prefers formula_6 to formula_7, formula_7 to formula_6, or is indifferent between formula_6 and formula_7.

&quot;Transitivity&quot; assumes that, as an individual decides according to the completeness axiom, the individual also decides consistently.
* Axiom (Transitivity): For every formula_16 and formula_17 with formula_8 and formula_19 we must have formula_20.

&quot;Independence of irrelevant alternatives&quot; pertains to well-defined preferences as well. It assumes that two gambles mixed with an irrelevant third one will maintain the same order of preference as when the two are presented independently of the third one. The independence axiom is the most controversial..
* Axiom (Independence of irrelevant alternatives): For every formula_16 such that formula_22, the preference formula_23 must hold for every lottery formula_17 and real formula_25.

&quot;Continuity&quot; assumes that when there are three lotteries (formula_16 and formula_17) and the individual prefers formula_6 to formula_7 and formula_7 to formula_17. There should be a possible combination of formula_6 and formula_17 in which the individual is then indifferent between this mix and the lottery formula_7.
* Axiom (Continuity): Let formula_16 and formula_17 be lotteries with formula_37. Then formula_7 is equally preferred to formula_39 for some formula_40.

If all these axioms are satisfied, then the individual is rational. A utility function can represent the preferences, i.e., one can assign numbers (utilities) to each outcome of the lottery such that choosing the best lottery according to the preference formula_41 amounts to choosing the lottery with the highest expected utility. This result is the von Neumann–Morgenstern utility representation theorem.

In other words, if an individual&#x27;s behavior always satisfies the above axioms, then there is a utility function such that the individual will choose one gamble over another if and only if the expected utility of one exceeds that of the other. The expected utility of any gamble may be expressed as a linear combination of the utilities of the outcomes, with the weights being the respective probabilities. Utility functions are also normally continuous functions. Such utility functions are also called von Neumann–Morgenstern (vNM). This is a central theme of the expected utility hypothesis in which an individual chooses not the highest expected value but rather the highest expected utility. The expected utility-maximizing individual makes decisions rationally based on the theory&#x27;s axioms.

The von Neumann–Morgenstern formulation is important in the application of set theory to economics because it was developed shortly after the Hicks–Allen &quot;ordinal revolution&quot; of the 1930s, and it revived the idea of cardinal utility in economic theory. However, while in this context the &quot;utility function&quot; is cardinal, in that implied behavior would be altered by a nonlinear monotonic transformation of utility, the &quot;expected utility function&quot; is ordinal because any monotonic increasing transformation of expected utility gives the same behavior.

==== Examples of von Neumann–Morgenstern utility functions ====
The utility function formula_42 was originally suggested by Bernoulli (see above). It has relative risk aversion constant and equal to one and is still sometimes assumed in economic analyses. The utility function

:formula_43

It exhibits constant absolute risk aversion and, for this reason, is often avoided, although it has the advantage of offering substantial mathematical tractability when asset returns are normally distributed. Note that, as per the affine transformation property alluded to above, the utility function formula_44 gives the same preferences orderings as does formula_45; thus it is irrelevant that the values of formula_45 and its expected value are always negative: what matters for preference ordering is which of two gambles gives the higher expected utility, not the numerical values of those expected utilities.

The class of constant relative risk aversion utility functions contains three categories. Bernoulli&#x27;s utility function

:formula_47

Has relative risk aversion equal to 1. The functions

:formula_48

for formula_49 have relative risk aversion equal to formula_50. And the functions

:formula_51

for formula_52 have relative risk aversion equal to formula_53

See also the discussion of utility functions having hyperbolic absolute risk aversion (HARA).

== Formula for expected utility ==
When the entity formula_54 whose value formula_55 affects a person&#x27;s utility takes on one of a set of discrete values, the formula for expected utility, which is assumed to be maximized, is

:formula_56

Where the left side is the subjective valuation of the gamble as a whole, formula_57 is the &quot;i&quot;th possible outcome, formula_58 is its valuation, and formula_59 is its probability. There could be either a finite set of possible values formula_60, in which case the right side of this equation has a finite number of terms, or there could be an infinite set of discrete values, in which case the right side has an infinite number of terms.

When formula_54 can take on any of a continuous range of values, the expected utility is given by

:formula_62

where formula_63 is the probability density function of formula_64 The certainty equivalent, the fixed amount that would make a person indifferent to it vs. the distribution , is given by formula_65

===Measuring risk in the expected utility context===
Often, people refer to &quot;risk&quot; as a potentially quantifiable entity. In the context of mean-variance analysis, variance is used as a risk measure for portfolio return; however, this is only valid if returns are normally distributed or otherwise jointly elliptically distributed, or in the unlikely case in which the utility function has a quadratic form—however, David E. Bell proposed a measure of risk that follows naturally from a certain class of von Neumann–Morgenstern utility functions. Let utility of wealth be given by

:formula_66

for individual-specific positive parameters &quot;a&quot; and &quot;b&quot;. Then, the expected utility is given by
:formula_67
Thus the risk measure is formula_68, which differs between two individuals if they have different values of the parameter formula_69 allowing other people to disagree about the degree of risk associated with any given portfolio. Individuals sharing a given risk measure (based on a given value of &quot;a&quot;) may choose different portfolios because they may have different values of &quot;b&quot;. See also Entropic risk measure.

For general utility functions, however, expected utility analysis does not permit the expression of preferences to be separated into two parameters, one representing the expected value of the variable in question and the other representing its risk.

== Risk aversion ==

The expected utility theory takes into account that individuals may be risk-averse, meaning that the individual would refuse a fair gamble (a fair gamble has an expected value of zero). Risk aversion implies that their utility functions are concave and show diminishing marginal wealth utility. The risk attitude is directly related to the curvature of the utility function: risk-neutral individuals have linear utility functions, risk-seeking individuals have convex utility functions, and risk-averse individuals have concave utility functions. The curvature of the utility function can measure the degree of risk aversion.

Since the risk attitudes are unchanged under affine transformations of &quot;u&quot;, the second derivative &quot;u&quot;&quot; is not an adequate measure of the risk aversion of a utility function. Instead, it needs to be normalized. This leads to the definition of the Arrow–Pratt measure of absolute risk aversion:

: formula_70

where formula_71 is wealth.

The Arrow–Pratt measure of relative risk aversion is:

: formula_72

Special classes of utility functions are the CRRA (constant relative risk aversion) functions, where RRA(w) is constant, and the CARA (constant absolute risk aversion) functions, where ARA(w) is constant. These functions are often used in economics to simplify.

A decision that maximizes expected utility also maximizes the probability of the decision&#x27;s consequences being preferable to some uncertain threshold. In the absence of uncertainty about the threshold, expected utility maximization simplifies to maximizing the probability of achieving some fixed target. If the uncertainty is uniformly distributed, then expected utility maximization becomes expected value maximization. Intermediate cases lead to increasing risk aversion above some fixed threshold and increasing risk seeking below a fixed threshold.

== The St. Petersburg paradox ==
The St. Petersburg paradox presented by Nicolas Bernoulli illustrates that decision-making based on the expected value of monetary payoffs leads to absurd conclusions. When a probability distribution function has an infinite expected value, a person who only cares about expected values of a gamble would pay an arbitrarily large finite amount to take this gamble. However, this experiment demonstrated no upper bound on the potential rewards from very low probability events. In the hypothetical setup, a person flips a coin repeatedly. The number of consecutive times the coin lands on heads determines the participant&#x27;s prize. The participant&#x27;s prize is doubled every time it comes up heads (1/2 probability); it ends when the participant flips the coin and comes out in tails. A player who only cares about expected payoff value should be willing to pay any finite amount of money to play because this entry cost will always be less than the expected, infinite value of the game. However, in reality, people do not do this. &quot;Only a few participants were willing to pay a maximum of $25 to enter the game because many were risk averse and unwilling to bet on a very small possibility at a very high price.

==Criticism==
In the early days of the calculus of probability, classic utilitarians believed that the option with the greatest utility would produce more pleasure or happiness for the agent and, therefore, must be chosen. The main problem with the expected value theory is that there might not be a unique correct way to quantify utility or to identify the best trade-offs. For example, some of the trade-offs may be intangible or qualitative. Rather than monetary incentives, other desirable ends can also be included in utility, such as pleasure, knowledge, friendship, etc. Originally, the consumer&#x27;s total utility was the sum of independent utilities of the goods. However, the expected value theory was dropped as it was considered too static and deterministic. The classic counter example to the expected value theory (where everyone makes the same &quot;correct&quot; choice) is the St. Petersburg Paradox.

In empirical applications, several violations of expected utility theory are systematic, and these falsifications have deepened our understanding of how people decide. Daniel Kahneman and Amos Tversky in 1979 presented their prospect theory which showed empirically how preferences of individuals are inconsistent among the same choices, depending on the framing of the choices, i.e., how they are presented.

Like any mathematical model, expected utility theory simplifies reality. The mathematical correctness of expected utility theory and the salience of its primitive concepts do not guarantee that expected utility theory is a reliable guide to human behavior or optimal practice. The mathematical clarity of expected utility theory has helped scientists design experiments to test its adequacy and to distinguish systematic departures from its predictions. This has led to the behavioral finance field, which has produced deviations from the expected utility theory to account for the empirical facts.

Other critics argue that applying expected utility to economic and policy decisions has engendered inappropriate valuations, particularly when monetary units are used to scale the utility of nonmonetary outcomes, such as deaths.

===Conservatism in updating beliefs===
Psychologists have discovered systematic violations of probability calculations and behavior by humans. This has been evidenced by examples such as the Monty Hall problem, where it was demonstrated that people do not revise their degrees on belief in line with experimented probabilities and that probabilities cannot be applied to single cases. On the other hand, in updating probability distributions using evidence, a standard method uses conditional probability, namely the rule of Bayes. An experiment on belief revision has suggested that humans change their beliefs faster when using Bayesian methods than when using informal judgment.

According to the empirical results, there has been almost no recognition in decision theory of the distinction between the problem of justifying its theoretical claims regarding the properties of rational belief and desire. One of the main reasons is that people&#x27;s basic tastes and preferences for losses cannot be represented with utility as they change under different scenarios.

===Irrational deviations===
Behavioral finance has produced several generalized expected utility theories to account for
instances where people&#x27;s choices deviate from those predicted by expected utility theory. These deviations are described as &quot;irrational&quot; because they can depend on the way the problem is presented, not on the actual costs, rewards, or probabilities involved. Particular theories, including prospect theory, rank-dependent expected utility, and cumulative prospect theory, are considered insufficient to predict preferences and the expected utility. Additionally, experiments have shown systematic violations and generalizations based on the results of Savage and von Neumann–Morgenstern. This is because preferences and utility functions constructed under different contexts differ significantly. This is demonstrated in the contrast of individual preferences under the insurance and lottery context, which shows the degree of indeterminacy of the expected utility theory. Additionally, experiments have shown systematic violations and generalizations based on the results of Savage and von Neumann–Morgenstern.

In practice, there will be many situations where the probabilities are unknown, and one operates under uncertainty. In economics, Knightian uncertainty or ambiguity may occur. Thus, one must make assumptions about the probabilities, but the expected values of various decisions can be very sensitive to the assumptions. This is particularly problematic when the expectation is dominated by rare extreme events, as in a long-tailed distribution. Alternative decision techniques are robust to the uncertainty of probability of outcomes, either not depending on probabilities of outcomes and only requiring scenario analysis (as in minimax or minimax regret), or being less sensitive to assumptions.

Bayesian approaches to probability treat it as a degree of belief. Thus, they do not distinguish between risk and a wider concept of uncertainty: they deny the existence of Knightian uncertainty. They would model uncertain probabilities with hierarchical models, i.e., as distributions whose parameters are drawn from a higher-level distribution (hyperpriors).

===Preference reversals over uncertain outcomes===
Starting with studies such as Lichtenstein &amp; Slovic (1971), it was discovered that subjects sometimes exhibit signs of preference reversals about their certainty equivalents of different lotteries. Specifically, when eliciting certainty equivalents, subjects tend to value &quot;p bets&quot; (lotteries with a high chance of winning a low prize) lower than &quot;$ bets&quot; (lotteries with a small chance of winning a large prize). When subjects are asked which lotteries they prefer in direct comparison, however, they frequently prefer the &quot;p bets&quot; over &quot;$ bets&quot;. Many studies have examined this &quot;preference reversal&quot;, from both an experimental (e.g., Plott &amp; Grether, 1979) and theoretical (e.g., Holt, 1986) standpoint, indicating that this behavior can be brought into accordance with neoclassical economic theory under specific assumptions.

== Recommendations ==

Three components in the psychology field are seen as crucial to developing a more accurate descriptive theory of decision under risks.

# Theory of decision framing effect (psychology)
# Better understanding of the psychologically relevant outcome space
# A psychologically richer theory of the determinants

<text>In the field of video compression, a video frame is compressed using different algorithms with different advantages and disadvantages, centered mainly around amount of data compression. These different algorithms for video frames are called picture types or frame types. The three major picture types used in the different video algorithms are I, P and B. They are different in the following characteristics:
* I‑frames are the least compressible but don&#x27;t require other video frames to decode. 
* P‑frames can use data from previous frames to decompress and are more compressible than I‑frames.
* B‑frames can use both previous and forward frames for data reference to get the highest amount of data compression.

== Summary ==

Three types of &quot;pictures&quot; (or frames) are used in video compression: I, P, and B frames.

An I‑frame (intra-coded picture) is a complete image, like a JPG or BMP image file.

A P‑frame (Predicted picture) holds only the changes in the image from a previous frame. For example, in a scene where a car moves across a stationary background, only the car&#x27;s movements need to be encoded. The encoder does not need to store the unchanging background pixels in the P‑frame, thus saving space. P‑frames are also known as &quot;delta‑frames&quot;.

A B‑frame (Bidirectional predicted picture) saves even more space by using differences between the current frame and both the preceding and following frames to specify its content.

P and B frames are also called inter frames. The order in which the I, P and B frames are arranged is called the group of pictures. Video frames contain presentation timestamp (PTS) and decoding timestamp (DTS) values to keep the frames in correct order for decoding and displaying.

== Pictures/frames ==
While the terms &quot;frame&quot; and &quot;picture&quot; are often used interchangeably, the term &quot;picture&quot; is a more general notion, as a picture can be either a frame or a field. A frame is a complete image, and a field is the set of odd-numbered or even-numbered scan lines composing a partial image. For example, an HD 1080 picture has 1080 lines (rows) of pixels. An odd field consists of pixel information for lines 1, 3, 5...1079. An even field has pixel information for lines 2, 4, 6...1080. When video is sent in interlaced-scan format, each frame is sent in two fields, the field of odd-numbered lines followed by the field of even-numbered lines.

A frame used as a reference for predicting other frames is called a reference frame.

Frames encoded without information from other frames are called I-frames. Frames that use prediction from a single preceding reference frame (or a single frame for prediction of each region) are called P-frames. B-frames use prediction from a (possibly weighted) average of two reference frames, one preceding and one succeeding.

== Slices ==
In the H.264/MPEG-4 AVC standard, the granularity of prediction types is brought down to the &quot;slice level.&quot; A slice is a spatially distinct region of a frame that is encoded separately from any other region in the same frame. I-slices, P-slices, and B-slices take the place of I, P, and B frames.

== Macroblocks ==

Typically, pictures (frames) are segmented into &quot;macroblocks&quot;, and individual prediction types can be selected on a macroblock basis rather than being the same for the entire picture, as follows:
* I-frames can contain only intra macroblocks
* P-frames can contain both intra macroblocks and predicted macroblocks
* B-frames can contain intra, predicted, and bi-predicted macroblocks

Furthermore, in the H.264 video coding standard, the frame can be segmented into sequences of macroblocks called &quot;slices&quot;, and instead of using I, B and P-frame type selections, the encoder can choose the prediction style distinctly on each individual slice. Also in H.264 are found several additional types of frames/slices:
* SI‑frames/slices (Switching I): Facilitates switching between coded streams; contains SI-macroblocks (a special type of intra coded macroblock).
* SP‑frames/slices (Switching P): Facilitates switching between coded streams; contains P and/or I-macroblocks
* Multi‑frame motion estimation (up to 16 reference frames or 32 reference fields)
Multi‑frame motion estimation increases the quality of the video, while allowing the same compression ratio. SI and SP frames (defined for the Extended Profile) improve error correction. When such frames are used along with a smart decoder, it is possible to recover the broadcast streams of damaged DVDs.

== Intra-coded (I) frames/slices (key frames) ==

* I-frames contain an entire image. They are coded without reference to any other frame except (parts of) themselves.
* May be generated by an encoder to create a random access point (to allow a decoder to start decoding properly from scratch at that picture location).
* May also be generated when differentiating image details prohibit generation of effective P or B-frames.
* Typically require more bits to encode than other frame types.

Often, I‑frames are used for random access and are used as references for the decoding of other pictures. Intra refresh periods of a half-second are common on such applications as digital television broadcast and DVD storage. Longer refresh periods may be used in some environments. For example, in videoconferencing systems it is common to send I-frames very infrequently.

== Predicted (P) frames/slices ==
* Require the prior decoding of some other picture(s) in order to be decoded.
* May contain both image data and motion vector displacements and combinations of the two.
* Can reference previous pictures in decoding order.
* Older standard designs (such as MPEG-2) use only one previously decoded picture as a reference during decoding, and require that picture to also precede the P picture in display order.
* In H.264, can use multiple previously decoded pictures as references during decoding, and can have any arbitrary display-order relationship relative to the picture(s) used for its prediction.
* Typically require fewer bits for encoding compared to I-frames.

== Bi-directional predicted (B) frames/slices (macroblocks) ==
* Require the prior decoding of subsequent frame(s) to be displayed.
* May contain image data and/or motion vector displacements. Older standards allow only a single global motion compensation vector for the entire frame or a single motion compensation vector per macroblock.
* Include some prediction modes that form a prediction of a motion region (e.g., a macroblock or a smaller area) by averaging the predictions obtained using two different previously decoded reference regions. Some standards allow two motion compensation vectors per macroblock (biprediction).
* In older standards (such as MPEG-2), B-frames are never used as references for the prediction of other pictures. As a result, a lower quality encoding (requiring less space) can be used for such B-frames because the loss of detail will not harm the prediction quality for subsequent pictures.
* H.264 relaxes this restriction, and allows B-frames to be used as references for the decoding of other frames at the encoder&#x27;s discretion.
* Older standards (such as MPEG-2), use exactly two previously decoded pictures as references during decoding, and require one of those pictures to precede the B-frame in display order and the other one to follow it.
* H.264 allows for one, two, or more than two previously decoded pictures as references during decoding, and can have any arbitrary display-order relationship relative to the picture(s) used for its prediction.
* The heightened flexibility of information retrieval means that B-frames typically require fewer bits for encoding than either I or P-frames.

<text>The Rains Came is a 1939 20th Century Fox film based on an American novel by Louis Bromfield (published in June 1937 by Harper &amp; Brothers). The film was directed by Clarence Brown and stars Myrna Loy, Tyrone Power, George Brent, Brenda Joyce, Nigel Bruce, and Maria Ouspenskaya.

A remake of the film was released in 1955 under the name &quot;The Rains of Ranchipur&quot;.

==Plot==

The story centers on the redemption of Lady Edwina Esketh. Tom Ransome is an artist who leads a rather dissolute and socially active life in the fictional Hindu Princely State of Ranchipur, India. His routine is shattered with the arrival of Lady Edwina Esketh, his former lover, who has married the elderly Lord Esketh. Lady Edwina first tries to seduce but gradually falls in love with Major Rama Safti, who represents the &quot;new India.&quot;

Ranchipur is devastated by an earthquake, which causes a flood, which causes a cholera epidemic. Lord Esketh dies, and Lady Esketh renounces her hedonistic life in favor of helping the sick with Major Safti. She accidentally drinks from a glass that a patient has used, becomes infected, and dies, making it possible for Safti to become the ruler of a kingdom that he presumably will reform. Throughout the story, Fern Simon, a missionary&#x27;s daughter, and Ransome also fall in love.

==Cast==
* Myrna Loy as Lady Edwina Esketh
* Tyrone Power as Major Rama Safti
* George Brent as Tom Ransome
* Brenda Joyce as Fern Simon
* Nigel Bruce as Lord Albert Esketh
* Maria Ouspenskaya as Maharani
* Joseph Schildkraut as Mr. Bannerjee
* Mary Nash as Miss MacDaid
* Jane Darwell as Aunt Phoebe – Mrs. Smiley
* Marjorie Rambeau as Mrs. Simon
* Henry Travers as Rev. Homer Smiley
* H. B. Warner as Maharajah
* Laura Hope Crews as Lily Hoggett-Egburry
* William Royle as Raschid Ali Khan
* C. Montague Shaw as General Keith
* Harry Hayden as Rev. Elmer Simon
* Herbert Evans as Bates


==Casting==
The casting apparently was a lengthy process. Loy and Brown were lent to 20th Century Fox from MGM (as part of a deal wherein Power was loaned by Fox to MGM for &quot;Marie Antoinette&quot;). Brent was also on loan from his home studio of Warner Bros. The only cast member who was chosen for the role he or she played was Ouspenskaya, who was memorable as the Maharani. She later claimed that she learned all she needed to know about impersonating Indian royalty from her acquaintance with the Russian Grand Duchess Maria Pavlovna of Russia. Nigel Bruce is cast against what had become his established type.

==Production==
The budget was $2.5 million ($ million in ).

In later years, Loy recalled that her belief in director Clarence Brown made her willing to try his suggestion for her death scene: &quot;&#x27;people don&#x27;t die with their eyes closed...Why don&#x27;t you try dying with your eyes open? You&#x27;ve just got to hold your breath.&#x27; I held my breath, staring at some fixed object until I began to see stars and everything started to blur and run together. I was turning a little blue when he finally called &#x27;Cut!&#x27; When you trust a director, you&#x27;ll do anything for him.&quot;

Loy&#x27;s stylish bad girl role harks back to the vamps, villainesses and dramatic leads she was known for until her success in &quot;The Thin Man&quot; established her comedic talent. After a series of romantic comedies, Loy wanted a good dramatic role. According to Loy, Louis Bromfield told her &quot;I think you&#x27;re giving the best performance of your career.&quot; After the Second World War and her appearance in &quot;The Best Years of Our Lives&quot;, her image changed yet again to that of the ideal mother.

The special effects that produced the earthquakes and floods won the first Oscar issued in that category (see below). However, &quot;Variety&quot; praised the human drama: &quot;The simple heroics following the quake are more effective than the earth-rending sequences themselves.&quot;

TCM.com reports some of cinematographer Arthur Miller&#x27;s recollections about &quot;The Rains Came&quot;, including his &quot;obsession&quot; with the rain.

Original prints of the film were tinted sepia.

==Accolades==
It was nominated for five Academy Awards, winning in the category of Special Effects, for the earthquake and flood sequences. It became the first film to win an Academy Award for Best Special Effects, edging other nominees, including &quot;The Wizard of Oz&quot; and &quot;Gone with the Wind&quot;. It was on a preliminary list of submissions from the studios for an Academy Award for Cinematography (Black-and-White) but was not nominated.

===1955 adaptation===

&quot;The Rains Came&quot; was remade in 1955 as &quot;The Rains of Ranchipur&quot;, with Richard Burton, Lana Turner and Fred MacMurray in the Power, Loy and Brent roles. The 1939 film uses the original novel&#x27;s ending; the 1955 film provides different fates for Lord and Lady Esketh.

<text>Fortuneswell is a village in Underhill on the Isle of Portland, in Dorset, England. It lies on steeply sloping land on the northern edge of the island, known as Underhill, where Chesil Beach connects the island to the mainland. Adjoining Fortuneswell are Chiswell to the west and Castletown to the north. Fortuneswell occupies the steeper land above sea level, whereas Chiswell and Castletown occupy flat land close to sea level, next to Chesil Beach and Portland Harbour respectively. Fortuneswell has a main shopping street, and along with Easton, is the main hub of the island&#x27;s activities.

Fortuneswell now includes the former hamlets of Maiden Well and Mallams. As with the rest of Portland&#x27;s settlements, Fortuneswell has been designated as a conservation area, to protect its special architectural and historic interest, since 1976.

==History==
Fortuneswell was established around a natural watercourse and various springs. It is likely that the Romans developed the village pond and wells. The main well was situated within the centre of the village. The village name was first recorded as &quot;Fortunes Well&quot; in 1608, and evidence has suggested this originated from the belief in the occult star-telling power of its water, where one&#x27;s luck could be seen. Over the centuries the village was largely made up of open space, with high-quality houses spread out across the community.

From the 1840s onwards Portland saw a large increase within its population, due to the construction of Portland Harbour&#x27;s Breakwaters. The housing demands placed upon the island saw the originality of Fortuneswell altered. A large number of terraces were erected across the village area, and were crammed into any available open space. The expansion continued into the 20th century, when the site of Tillycoombe Farm became a large housing estate too. A new church was built between 1838 and 1840 at Fortuneswell, and was named St John&#x27;s. In 1865, Underhill became its own parish, with St John&#x27;s becoming the parish church. The influx of residents and visitors allowed Fortuneswell to flourish commercially, with many businesses becoming established there. The 1896 Kelly&#x27;s Directory lists 73 businesses within the village.

Following World War II, it became clear new housing on Portland was needed, and this led to the construction of a large housing estate across Verne Common. The new estate, which began construction in 1949, was made a part of Fortuneswell. The original project suggested the construction of high-quality villas, however, prefabricated buildings were erected instead. With the closure of the naval base in 1995, Fortuneswell has since seen some economic decline in business, although various independent stores remain active.

==Commerce and amenities==

Over the last few decades, many shops in Fortuneswell have changed hands frequently, while a few shops have lasted longer periods. The New Star Inn, Royal Portland Arms and the Britannia Inn are all pubs located in Fortuneswell. The no longer remaining Regal Cinema was built in Fortuneswell during 1932. It later became a Bingo hall, and then the Rumours Nightclub in the 1990s. A victim of suspected arson, the nightclub caught fire one evening in 1992 and the remaining shell was demolished soon after. The former primitive Methodists church is now the Royal Manor Theatre. The Theatre is one of only a few amateur dramatic company&#x27;s that actually own their own premises and the company itself is run entirely by volunteers. 

A reminder of industry in the back streets of Fortuneswell is an old Victorian steam laundry, built in 1900, which later housed a Defence Industry Contractor. In 1793 Robert Carr Brackenbury erected a small Methodist church within the village, known as Brackenbury&#x27;s Chapel. It was later replaced by the Underhill Methodist Church of 1899. Opposite the church is the Portland Council Offices, which were built in 1934, and possess a fine council chamber.
Located in Fortuneswell and close to the villages of Castletown and Chiswell is Victoria Gardens, which were opened in 1904 to mark the 1897 Diamond Jubilee of Queen Victoria. Towards the highest point of Fortuneswell, heading towards Priory Corner, is Old Hill – a very steep footpath linking Underhill with Tophill. It was once a main route for those travelling from Tophill.

Infant and primary education within the village became provided by Isle of Portland Aldridge Community Academy in 2012. The two schools within Fortuneswell, Brackenbury Infant School (including the Community Nursery) and Underhill Community Junior School, both closed in 2014, along with other schools on the island, all to be replaced by a new school situated at Southwell Business Park in 2016. Fortuneswell was also home to Brackenbury Day School, which is now the Brackenbury Centre.

===Grade listed features===
Fortuneswell has a wide array of architecture and buildings, a number of which are Grade Listed. There are some particularly older dwellings nestled beside Victorian and later built houses. Bow Cottage, and its boundary wall, at Artist Row, 116 and 118 Fortuneswell, 81 Fortuneswell, 6 and 8 Fortuneswell, 59 and 61 Fortuneswell, the ex-Post Office at 79 Fortuneswell, and 165 Fortuneswell are all Grade II Listed.

Queen Anne House at the top of Fortuneswell, was built circa 1720 by architect and quarry merchant Thomas Gilbert, The house, along with its boundary wall and gate piers became Grade II* Listed in May 1993. Another particularly grand house is The Captain&#x27;s House, located at the bottom of Mallams. The house has been subject to local stories, as it stood in ruin for over one hundred years before being privately renovated in the late 1990s. It is a Grade II listed building. At Old Hill is the Old Rectory, which was originally the rectory to St. George Church. It later became a private hotel, and then three dwellings. It is Grade II Listed. Overlooking Victoria Gardens is a former police station. The station and its courtroom are dated 1904 and 1906, and became Grade II Listed in May 1993. The front boundary wall and steps to the station are also Grade II Listed. 1, 2 and 3 Castle Road, former police dwellings, are Grade II Listed too.

High Street contains various notable houses, and was once a separate hamlet known as Maiden Well. This is past the upper end of Chiswell, where the road turns into Fortuneswell and becomes High Street. 58 High Street, 62 (Tenastelion) and 64 High Street, 147 High Street, 137 and 139 High Street, 163 High Street, 60 High Street, and its attached outbuilding, 165 High Street, 107 and 109 High Street, 135 High Street, 141 High Street, including its boundary walls, piers and gate, 159 and 161 High Street, and 10 High Street and its attached outbuilding, are all Grade II Listed. At the bottom of the street is Maiden Well, the remains of a boundary wall and well head or cistern, probably of 18th-century origin. It is also Grade II Listed.

The steep street Mallams was once a separate hamlet from Fortuneswell, and features various notable buildings - with the road having extensive terraces from the 18th and 19th centuries. 53 and 60 Mallams, 17 Mallams, 19 Mallams, 42 Mallams, 62 and 64 Mallams, 58 Mallams, and Fair Winds (63 Mallams) are all Grade II Listed. Also at Mallams is a K6 Telephone Kiosk found opposite No. 63 Mallams, and is also Grade II Listed. It was designed in 1935 by Sir Giles Gilbert Scott.

St. John&#x27;s Church was built on a steep hillside in Fortuneswell in 1838–40 by John Hancock of Weymouth. The building has been Grade II Listed since January 1951, and the churchyard walls, gate piers, railings, and steps, dating from 1839–1840, became Grade II Listed in September 1978 at the same time as two headstone monuments, about 5 metres north east from the west tower of the church.

The Royal Portland Arms is Grade II Listed, and dates from the mid-19th century and was often visited by King George III. Both the New Star Inn and the Britannia Inn are Grade II Listed too. At Hambro Road is a War Department/Admiralty boundary stone dating from the 19th century, which became Grade II Listed at the same time as two other similar boundary stones found at the junction of New Road and Old Hill.

<text>Renault Trucks is a French commercial truck manufacturer with corporate headquarters at Saint-Priest near Lyon. Originally part of Renault, it has been a subsidiary of Volvo since 2001.

From its beginnings in 1978 to 2002, the company was called  (&quot;Renault Industrial Vehicles&quot;), from 1992 on officially written as Renault V. I.. Until 2002, Renault Véhicules Industriels also manufactured buses.

==History==
Renault first began building dedicated commercial trucks in 1906. In 1956, however Renault stopped producing trucks and buses under its own name. Instead, the company Saviem was formed as a subsidiary of their own commercial products with the manufacturers Somua and Latil. Lighter commercials kept on using the Renault name, however. From 1957 on, Saviem was also used as the brand name for the trucks and buses produced by the company.

As a result of French industrial policy, in 1975 state-owned Renault also acquired the truck and bus manufacturer Berliet from Citroën (at that time a part of the Michelin corporation). In 1978, Berliet and Saviem were merged to form Renault Véhicules Industriels. Again, the old brand names were retained for two more years while the model lineups were gradually incorporated, until in 1980 they were replaced by the name Renault.

In 1971, Saviem became a member of the Euro Truck Development Group or &quot;Club of Four&quot;, a cooperation between four European truck producers (Saviem, Volvo, DAF and Magirus-Deutz, which soon after became a part of Iveco) for the production of medium-sized trucks. Since 1975 the truck models resulting from this cooperation were built by Saviem and later Renault, even until 2001. They were also sold on the North American market as the &quot;Mack Mid-Liner&quot; or &quot;Manager&quot;.

In 1978, PSA Group bought Chrysler&#x27;s European operations. Included in the deal were commercial vehicle operations in the UK and Spain, which at that time used the brand name Dodge. PSA however sold them on to RVI in 1983, having itself little interest in the commercial vehicle market. The newly acquired operations in the UK had their origins in the commercial vehicle branch of the Rootes Group which originally carried the brand names Karrier and Commer. Some of the models built there were continued in production for several years by RVI in Dunstable, Bedfordshire, who also kept the Dodge brand name for these models, albeit in combination with the Renault badge. In 1988 the company was subject to a Fire Brigades Union inquiry due to eight Dodge fire engines involved in crashes. Until 1992 the UK division was known as Renault Truck Industries, after which it then took the international Renault V.I. name.

In Spain, however, where Renault already was recognized as a local automobile producer, the Dodge trucks, which originally had been developed by the manufacturer Barreiros Diesel, were rebadged as Renaults and soon after replaced by French-designed models.

In 1987, Renault Véhicules Industriels took over from its parent company Renault a 42% stake in the American manufacturer Mack Trucks which became a fully owned subsidiary of Renault Véhicules Industriels in 1990.

In 1991, RVI purchased a 37.5% shareholding in French bodybuilder Heuliez Bus. In 1994, RVI purchased a 34% stake in the Czech bus manufacturer Karosa, increasing its ownership to a majority 51% in 1996 and 96% in 2000. In 1997 Renault V. I. entered into a cooperation agreement with the Finnish truck producer Sisu. In 2002 the company signed a deal with the Chinese company Dongfeng Motor to manufacture engines.

Renault Trucks took part in the FIA European Championship, running Renault Premium powered by 13-litre DXi13 engines. The Renault Trucks-MKR Technology team won in 2010.

Also, the Uruguayan plant of cars owned by Nordex S.A. in Uruguay has made since 2004 the Renault Trucks models like Midlum series.

The Volvo Group invested about €2 billion to develop a new line of Renault Trucks vehicles (C, D, K, T) which were introduced through 2013 replacing the previous models.

==Changes of ownership==
As part of Renault&#x27;s restructuring following privatisation in 1996, the heavy vehicles operations of bus and truck were divested. In 1999, the Renault and Karosa bus and coach operations were split off from Renault Véhicules Industriels and merged with Fiat-Iveco&#x27;s bus and coach operations to form the jointly owned subsidiary Irisbus. In 2003, Irisbus became a full subsidiary of Iveco and the brand Renault on its products was replaced by the brand Irisbus.

In April 2000, Renault agreed to terms with Volvo to purchase its truck manufacturing business with Volvo in turn to relinquish its 15% shareholding in Renault and Renault buy a 20% shareholding in Volvo. The transaction which included Mack Trucks, but not Renault&#x27;s stake in Irisbus, was completed on 2 January 2001. RVI was renamed Renault Trucks in 2002. In October 2010 Renault reduced its shareholding in Volvo to 5%. In December 2012, Renault sold its remaining shares in Volvo.

==Military vehicles==

The Renault Trucks Defense division is wholly owned by Renault Trucks and is based in Versailles, France. It trades on its 1975 acquisition of Berliet and claims to have over 30,000 vehicles in use around the world. Its status as the leading supplier to the French Army was put in jeopardy in 2010 when the government placed a $214m order to Italian competitor Iveco. In 2016, Volvo announced its intention of divesting Renault Trucks Defense, as part of the selling of its Government Sales division.

It manufactures a range of special vehicles aimed at the defense and security markets, including the Sherpa, VAB armoured personnel carrier, the AMC armoured multirole carrier and Kerax ranges.

In May 16, 2006 Renault Trucks took over ACMAT, but the defence and security vehicle manufacturer retained its own name and identity.

On 24 May 2018, Renault Trucks Defense was renamed as Arquus.

<text>Sinaloa de Leyva () is a town in the Mexican state of Sinaloa. 
Its geographical location is . The honorific &quot;de Leyva&quot; commemorates , an early supporter of Francisco I. Madero in the Mexican Revolution who was born there. Sinaloa serves as the municipal seat for the surrounding municipality &quot;(municipio)&quot; of Sinaloa, Sinaloa. The municipality reported 88,282 inhabitants in the 2010 census. It is a former capital of the state of Sinaloa.

==History==
The town was founded on 30 April 1583 as Villa de San Felipe y Santiago de Sinaloa by Don Pedro de Montoya. In 1585 the second foundation of the town was carried out by Antonio Ruiz, Bartolomé de Mondragón, Tomás de Soberanes, Juan Martínez del Castillo y Juan Caballero. By 1590, Ruiz was its mayor, and the town was home to nine people who eked out a living, but the situation improved through their discovery of the mines of Chínipas, and the arrival of the Jesuit missionaries Gonzalo de Tapia and Martín Pérez in 1591. At the end of the sixteenth century, Ruiz wrote an autobiography where he detailed the early history of San Felipe y Santiago, and Sinaloa.

In 1595, Luis de Velasco granted residents&#x27; petitions for a at San Felipe y Santiago, and dispatched Captain Alonso Díaz with 24 soldiers to found it. The of Sinaloa was the northwesternmost in New Spain until the 1689 founding of the Presidio de Fronteras.

This was the base for Diego de Hurdaide&#x27;s subjugation of the Sinaloas, Tehuecos, Ahomes and Zuaques and the extension of Spanish control over the Fuerte River valley, and thus to the northern edge of modern Sinaloa.

<text>John Phillip Jumper (born February 4, 1945) is a retired United States Air Force (USAF) general, who served as 17th chief of staff of the United States Air Force from September 6, 2001 to September 2, 2005. He retired from the USAF on November 1, 2005. Jumper was succeeded as chief of staff by General T. Michael Moseley. 

He is the son of U.S. Air Force Major-General Jimmy J. Jumper. During his career he served as a command pilot with more than 5,000 flying hours. He later served as the CEO of Leidos from 2012 to 2014.

==Early life ==


John Jumper was born on February 4, 1945 in Paris, Texas. Jumper has stated that his father general Jimmy Jefferson Jumper enlisted in the United States Army Air Forces in World War II &quot;probably for a way to get out of Paris, Texas&quot;, became a pilot, and retired as a two star general. 

While his father served in the occupation of Japan after World War II, John and his mother once traveled aboard a liberty ship to join his father there. John Jumper&#x27;s grandfather, Delbert Lee Jumper was a cotton farmer from Paris, Texas and served in the U.S. Navy during World War One. Delbert&#x27;s brother Samuel Augusta Jumper was also a veteran having served in the U.S. Army. Samuel Jumper was the grandfather of Stephen Franklin Jumper, a U.S. Army soldier who was a purple heart recipient killed in action and whose name is on the Vietnam Veteran&#x27;s Memorial. 

John went on to earn his commission as a distinguished graduate of Virginia Military Institute&#x27;s Air Force ROTC program in 1966. He has commanded a fighter squadron, two fighter wings, a Numbered Air Force, U.S. Air Forces in Europe and Allied Air Forces Central Europe.
== Education ==

* 1962 Hampton High School (Hampton, Virginia)
* 1966 Bachelor of Science degree in electrical engineering, Virginia Military Institute, Lexington
* 1975 Squadron Officer School, Maxwell AFB, Alabama
* 1978 Air Command and Staff College, Maxwell AFB, Alabama
* 1979 Master of Business Administration degree, Golden Gate University, San Francisco, California
* 1982 National War College, Fort Lesley J. McNair, Washington, D.C.

==Career==

By October 1967 he was serving in combat operations in Vietnam. He was assigned to the 459th Tactical Airlift Squadron at Phu Cat Air Base and was part of the unit based in Da Nang. In January 1968 during the Tet Offensive he flew missions into Khe Sanh six days a week. He flew in supplies of whole blood and would fly off before being spotted by the North Vietnamese Army. He also transported supplies to special forces units sometimes up to &quot;six or seven hours&quot; a day in twenty minutes stints. He later served in England from 1970 to 1974.

Prior to becoming Chief of Staff of the Air Force, the general served as commander of Air Combat Command at Langley Air Force Base. Jumper has also served at the Pentagon as deputy chief of staff for air and space operations, as the senior military assistant to two secretaries of defense, and as special assistant to the chief of staff for roles and missions. A command pilot with more than 5,000 flying hours, principally in fighter aircraft, Jumper served two tours in Southeast Asia, accumulating more than 1,400 combat hours. Jumper later retired from the Air Force on November 1, 2005.
During the 9/11 terrorist attacks he was stationed at the Pentagon having sworn in as Air Force Chief of Staff just five days earlier. By 9:33 am air traffic control warned that a third high jacked airplane was flying off course. Jumper stated in an interview “We knew instantly we were the likely target.” By 9:37 am the plane struck the opposite side of the building and Jumper stated “James Roche was standing at his desk on the telephone looking out his window. I grabbed him by the collar, and as I pulled him into the hallway, the whole building rattled.” Jumper and his staff retreated to the basement command center of the Pentagon to help ensure continuity of the U.S. Government.

In June 2007 Jumper joined board of directors of Science Applications International Corporation, a federal contractor company. On March 1, 2012 Jumper became SAIC&#x27;s CEO and was essential in splitting the company into two. After the split Jumper remained the CEO of the company which changed its name to Leidos. Jumper retired as CEO in July 2014, when Roger Krone succeeded him as the company&#x27;s new CEO, but Jumper stayed on as chairman of the company&#x27;s board of directors. 

==Personal life==

Jumper&#x27;s wife is named Ellen McGhee and they have three daughters Melissa, Catherine, and Janet, all of whom have served in the Air Force. 

On November 6, 2022 his daughter Catherine was promoted to brigadier general and Commander of the Virginia National Guard Air Component. John Jumper served as the presiding official over the ceremony.

Jumper has five grandchildren.

Jumper appeared as himself in the &quot;Stargate SG-1&quot; episode &quot;Lost City: Part 2&quot; (S07E22).

During the ceremony retired Air Force General Lori Robinson stated &quot;Today we are honoring a leader, warrior, mentor and visionary — someone who represents the heart and soul of our Air Force&quot;.

== Awards and decorations ==
*2000 Air Force Order of the Sword, U.S. Air Forces in Europe (USAFE press release)

==Effective dates of promotion==
==Tanker Lease Scandal==
On June 7, 2005 General Jumper apologized to Senator McCain for internal Air Force emails about the Senator in the context of the tanker lease scandal, calling them &quot;unprofessional and not worthy of a great Air Force.&quot;

==Thunderbirds &quot;Thundervision&quot; Scandal==
Members of the United States Air Force were under investigation by the FBI for having awarded a $50 million contract for audio-visual presentation services to Strategic Message Solutions of Plymouth Meeting, Pa. The contract involved the &quot;Thundervision&quot; project, meant to provide oversized video screens and perhaps content services during air shows that featured the Air Force Thunderbirds. The investigation revolves around possible involvement of Jumper, and then Chief of Staff of the Air Force T. Michael Moseley. 

It was suggested that the contract price was inflated, because a friend of the two generals, Air Force General (ret.) Hal Hornburg, was associated with Strategic Message Solutions. Two companies involved in the bidding process protested award of the contract, one having offered comparable services for half as much. The Air Force later cancelled the contract.

<text>The Isaac Newton Institute for Mathematical Sciences is an international research institute for mathematics and its applications at the University of Cambridge. It is named after one of the university&#x27;s most illustrious figures, the mathematician and natural philosopher Sir Isaac Newton, and occupies one of the buildings in the Cambridge Centre for Mathematical Sciences.

==History==

After a national competition run by SERC, the Science and Engineering Research Council (now known as EPSRC Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council), this institute was chosen to be the national research institute for mathematical sciences in the UK.
It opened in 1992 with support from St John&#x27;s College and Trinity College. St. John&#x27;s provided the land and a purpose-built building, Trinity provided running costs for the first five years and the London Mathematical Society provided other support.

Shortly afterwards at the institute, the British mathematician Andrew Wiles announced his approach to proving Fermat&#x27;s Last Theorem in three lectures on 21–23 June 1993. In 1999 the institute was awarded a Queen&#x27;s Anniversary Prize in recognition of &quot;world-class achievement in education.&quot;
Although it is part of the national infrastructure for mathematical research, it is formally part of the University of Cambridge, from which it receives some funding. Nowadays five UK Research Councils, BBSRC, EPSRC, ESRC, NERC, STFC support about 55% of its activity.
A number of philanthropic individuals, family and educational trusts, private companies and bodies associated with the University of Cambridge generously give their support.

==Scientific programmes==
There are typically two or three programmes at any one time, each with up to twenty people and lasting between 4 weeks and 6 months. During these periods of activity there are courses and workshops for the attendees.

Programmes are chosen from proposals that cover the entire range of mathematical sciences and their applications by a Scientific Steering Committee of mathematical scientists solely on their scientific merit and the likelihood that they will have significant impact in their subject.

Although programmes are normally residential and planned several years ahead, during the COVID-19 pandemic, an urgent 6-workshop virtual programme on the Infectious Dynamics of Pandemics was approved and ran from April to September 2020. This was a successor to a 2013 programme on Infectious Disease Dynamics, and was complemented by virtual study groups and commissioned modelling for government.

<text>The chief of staff of the Air Force (acronym: CSAF, or AF/CC) is the service chief of the United States Air Force. They are the principal military advisor to the secretary of the Air Force on matter pertaining to the Air Force. They are a member of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and thereby a military adviser to the National Security Council, the secretary of defense, and the president. The chief of staff is typically the highest-ranking officer on active duty in the Air Force, unless the chairman and/or the vice chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff are Air Force officers.

The chief of staff of the Air Force is an administrative position based in the Pentagon. The chief of staff does not have operational command authority over Air Force forces. That is within the purview of the combatant commanders who report to the secretary of defense. The chief of staff exercises supervision of Air Force units and organizations as the designee of the secretary of the Air Force.

The 23rd and current chief of staff of the Air Force is General David W. Allvin.

==Responsibilities==

===Department of the Air Force===
Under the authority, direction and control of the secretary of the Air Force, the chief of staff presides over the Air Staff. They act as the Secretary&#x27;s executive agent in carrying out approved plans, and exercises supervision, consistent with authority assigned to the commanders of the Unified Combatant Commands, over organizations and members of the Air Force as determined by the Secretary. The chief of staff may perform other duties as assigned by either the president, the secretary of defense or the secretary of the Air Force.

The vice chief of staff of the Air Force, also a four-star general, is the chief of staff&#x27;s principal deputy.

===Member of the Joint Chiefs of Staff===
The chief of staff of the Air Force is a member of the Joint Chiefs of Staff as prescribed by . When performing his JCS duties, the chief of staff is directly responsible to the secretary of defense. Like the other members of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, the chief of staff is an administrative position, with no operational command authority over the United States Air Force.

==Appointment and rank==

The chief of staff is nominated for appointment by the president, for a four-year term of office, and must be confirmed via majority vote by the Senate. Any Air Force officer with the rank of brigadier general and above may be appointed as chief of staff. Prospective nominees are typically laterally promoted from other four-star assignments. The chief can be reappointed to serve one additional term, but only during times of war or national emergency declared by Congress.

To qualify for the position, the nominee must have significant joint duty experience, and at least one full tour of duty in a joint duty assignment as a general officer, unless the President waives this requirement. By statute, the chief of staff is appointed as a four-star general without vacating his permanent rank.

===Special uniform cap===
The chief of staff is authorized to wear a special service cap with clouds and lightning bolts around the band of the hat. This cap is different from those worn by other general officers of the Air Force and it is for use by the Chief of Staff and Air Force officers serving as Chairman or Vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.

==List of chiefs of staff of the Air Force==
Prior to the creation of this position, General Henry H. Arnold was designated the first chief of the Army Air Forces and commanding general of the Army Air Forces during World War II. His successor, Carl A. Spaatz became the first chief of staff of the Air Force upon the establishment of the United States Air Force.

Four chiefs of staff would go on to serve as chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, namely Nathan F. Twining, George S. Brown, David C. Jones, and Charles Q. Brown Jr.

<doc id="736849" wikidata="Q2312679" url="?curid=736849" title="Calvillo">
<text>Calvillo () is a city in the Mexican state of Aguascalientes. The town serves as the municipal seat of the surrounding municipality of Calvillo. Calvillo is the second most populated city in the state, surpassed in importance only by the capital city. It is located about 52 kilometers from the city of Aguascalientes. It stands at in the southwestern corner of the state.

==History==
During the French invasion of Mexico, the north part of the valley of Huajuacar in which Calvillo lays, was occupied by the French. At the time, they intermixed with the descendants of Spaniards which already inhabited the south part of the valley. This fact made Calvillo the municipality with most Caucasian-origin inhabitants in the state, compared with the other municipalities.

Calvillo is the largest guava producer in Mexico and famous for its superb confectionery and liqueurs made from this fruit, which you can sample at the Guava Fair held during the first week of December.

The economy in Calvillo is centered on the guava, although there is other agriculture and a great deal of commerce. Calvillo is better known as the world capital of the guava.

==Demographics==
As of 2010, Calvillo had a total population of 19,742,

==Tourism==
Calvillo has a number of attractions of interest to tourists. One of them is the Main Square, which dates from 1778 and is famous for its orange trees. Calvillo is also home to the Temple of Our Lord of the Salitre; built in 1772, its interior features paintings that are considered jewels of religious art. The attractive dome topping the church has an exceptional size and diameter. Its rarest feature is that it is made as a single architectural piece; there are only five domes of this style worldwide. The interior of the dome features exquisite frescoes depicting the life of St. Joseph, the patron saint of the city. The Guadalupe Temple is another important church featuring majestic towers.

Another interesting place is the Malpaso Dam. The outskirts of Calvillo are a magnet for tourists. The Sierra del Laurel, south of the town, is a prolongation of Sierra Fría and highly sought-after by rock climbers because of its steep sides. Also nearby are the La Cordorniz Dam, and the ex-convent of the Tepozán, where, at the bottom of the gully, there is a rocky area with cave paintings. The prehistoric paintings of El Tepozan show diverse figures in different colors imprinted in various eras. Very close to these two attractions, in the town of La Panadera and chikis it is still practiced the old craft of embroidery and unthreading or &quot;deshilados&quot;, the state&#x27;s craft by excellence.

Calvillo has the leading position in exports of guava Mexico and famous for its superb confectionery and liqueurs made from this fruit, which you can sample at the Guava Fair held during the first week of December.

The economy in Calvillo is centered on the guava, although there is other agriculture and a great deal of commerce. Calvillo is better known as the world capital of the guava.
Calvillo has also been hit by floods in 1991 and 2008 causing damage (Estimated cost combined by inflation is 67 million.)
People from Calvillo are called &quot;calvillenses&quot;.

<text>Volvo Construction Equipment - Volvo CE - (originally Munktells, [[Bolinder-Munktell]], Volvo BM) is a major international company which develops, manufactures, and markets equipment for construction and related industries. It is a subsidiary and business of the Volvo Group.

== Overview ==
Volvo CE&#x27;s products include a range of wheel loaders, hydraulic excavators, articulated haulers, motor graders, soil and asphalt compactors, pavers, backhoe loaders, skid steers, and milling machines. Volvo CE has production facilities in the United States, Brazil, Scotland, Sweden, France, Germany, Poland, India, China, Russia, and South Korea.

Volvo CE sells machines under two brands: Volvo and SDLG.

== History ==
Three men laid the foundation for Volvo Construction Equipment: Johan Theofron Munktell and two brothers Jean Bolinder and Carl Gerhard Bolinder.

* In 1832, Johan Theofron Munktell who was then 27, began what became Volvo Construction Equipment in Eskilstuna, Sweden. In 1913, Munktell and his team produced Sweden&#x27;s first tractor. Elsewhere in Sweden, other entrepreneurs were making progress. Jean and Carl Gerhard Bolinder, who were brothers from Stockholm, had been manufacturing steam engines and crude engine oil since 1844.

* In 1932, a century after Johan Theofron Munktell’s began his company in Eskilstuna, Bolinder moved to Eskilstuna and both companies merged under the name AB Bolinder-Munktell. In 1934, Bolinder Munktell produced the legendary BM 25 tractor.

* In 1950, Volvo bought the machine manufacturer Bolinder-Munktell (BM). Four years later in 1954, the company produced its first wheel loader H10. It was the world&#x27;s first loader to feature a parallel lift arm system and attachment bracket, establishing Volvo as one of the leading construction companies in the world. They produced the world&#x27;s first articulated hauler: the Volvo DR 631 &quot;Gravel Charlie&quot;-in 1966.

* In 1973, the company changed its name to Volvo BM AB. In 1979, Valmet partnered with Volvo and produced tractors under the Volvo BM Valmet brand. Valmet and Massey Ferguson agreed to produce tractors at Massey Ferguson&#x27;s factory in Beauvais, France. The tractor manufacturing division was sold to Valmet in 1985. Also in 1985, Volvo BM joined the American manufacturer Clark Equipment and its subsidiary Euclid Trucks. The product name Clark Michigan was abbreviated to Michigan and the three brand names Volvo BM, Michigan, and Euclid were incorporated into the new company VME Group.

* In 1995, VME became a fully owned Volvo company and changed its name to Volvo Construction Equipment. In 1998, Volvo CE became the first foreign company to invest in Korea. The acquisition of Samsung Heavy Industries (Construction Equipment Division) increased its sales and presence in Asia.

* In January 2007, Volvo purchased 70% of SDLG. In April of the same year, Volvo also finalized the acquisition of a division of the American company Ingersoll Rand. The division manufactures machines for road construction. In July 2020, Volvo Construction sold Blaw-Knox pavers to Gencor Industries Inc. which is in Orlando.

* In December 2013, VCE agreed to pay US$160m for the heavy haul truck line of U.S. manufacturer Terex, Including Terex Equipment Ltd (TEL) of Scotland. 

* In December 2020, Volvo began delivering all-electric ECR25 Electric compact excavators to customers.

* In September 2021 VCE dropped the Terex name and rebranded the business Rokbak.

<doc id="736856" wikidata="Q1751470" url="?curid=736856" title="Volvo Penta">
<text>Volvo Penta is a Swedish marine and industrial engine manufacturer, a joint stock company within the Volvo Group. Volvo Penta evolved from a foundry in Skövde 1907, when the first marine engine, the B1, was manufactured. The name Penta was created about 1916. The Penta company soon became an established internal combustion engine manufacturer, which in 1927 delivered the engine for Volvo&#x27;s first passenger car.

Volvo acquired Penta in 1935 and Volvo Penta has been part of the Volvo Group since then. It now provides internal combustion engines (ICEs) and complete power systems to the marine industry, power-generating equipment, and similar industrial applications. The business also manufacturers sterndrive and inboard drive systems such as the Volvo Penta IPS. The engine program comprises petroleum fuel (diesel and gasoline) engines with power outputs of between .

==History==
In 1868, engineer Johan George Grönvall, also known as John G. Grönvall, founded a mechanical workshop and foundry in Skövde, Sweden. The company became limited in 1875, known as &quot;Sköfde Gjuteri och Mekaniska Verkstad&quot; or simply &quot;Gjuteriet&quot;. Products ranged from pots and vents to stoves and brewery equipment. Soon Gjuteriet also started manufacturing agricultural equipment and equipment for sawmills.

The company expanded heavily in the early 1900s, and started producing steam engines and water turbines for hydraulic power plants. In 1907, a very fruitful co-operation with the Stockholm-based engineering company &quot;Fritz Egnell&quot; began, with a one-cylinder 3 hp compression ignition engine. The engine was simply named &quot;B1&quot; - but a five-man committee was set to find a name that would catch on. The committee failed to agree on a catchy name, but because it had five members, settled for &quot;Penta&quot;.

In 1916, Egnell bought the company and the name changed to AB Pentaverken. Production was concentrated on engines, mostly for maritime applications. The years immediately after World War I were economically harsh, but a new product was introduced: a small two cylinder U2 outboard engine designed by Carl-Axel Skärlund. The U2 was slightly improved in 1926, and renamed U21 and remained in production until 1962. The U2/U21 was a great success and exported worldwide. In many countries, U21 is still synonymous with outboard engine.

In 1925, Penta was approached by Assar Gabrielsson, the founder of Volvo, who needed an engine for the first Volvo automobile. Penta then designed the four cylinder 28 hp side valve &quot;Typ DA&quot; engine for the Volvo ÖV 4. In 1935, Penta became a subsidiary of Volvo.

==Current operations==

===Marine engines and complete marine propulsion systems===

Volvo Penta has introduced several industry-first innovations to the marine engine market, including the sterndrive unit, contra-rotating propellers Duoprop, and Forward Drive. In 2005, Volvo Penta launched the first IPS (Inboard Performance System) engine, a new &quot;pod type&quot; boat drive system with counter rotating forward-facing propellers operated by a joystick. Its engines are used by more than 140 boat manufacturers, including Tiara Yachts, Fairline Boats, Sunseeker, Riviera, Four Winns, Sea Ray, Hanse, Bavaria and Cranchi. In conjunction with Volvo owned CPAC Systems, Volvo Penta and Yamaha Motor signed an agreement involving technological partnership in December 2010. Volvo Penta have a strong presence in the Marine Commercial segment; many passenger ferries, workboats, Military vessels, dive support vessels and fishing vessels utilise Volvo Penta engines for propulsion, power generation or auxiliary equipment such as bow thrusters. Most recently, Volvo Penta has been the number one choice of propulsion and power generation for offshore wind farm vessels, a.k.a. Crew transfer vessel (CTV). Operators can appreciate the reliability and performance from Volvo Penta engines and IPS propulsion systems. With ever-demanding focus on reducing emissions, Volvo Penta have released to market a hybrid solution for utilising electric motors mated to IPS drives. 

===Industrial engines===
The company sells its engines to a variety of users, including many generator manufacturers, such as Aggreko Sdmo, Genpower, Kohler and Shanghai Dingxin Electric Group. Its engines are also used in mining equipment and stone-crushing machinery.

===Manufacturing bases===
The company has a number of manufacturing bases for diesel engines at Vara, Sweden; Lingang, China; and Lexington, Tennessee, United States, for all gasoline engines and sterndrives. Volvo Penta operates worldwide and has around 4,000 dealers in 130 countries.

<doc id="736857" wikidata="Q5399470" url="?curid=736857" title="Loyola University Maryland">
<text>Loyola University Maryland is a private Jesuit university in Baltimore, Maryland. Established as Loyola College in Maryland by John Early and eight other members of the Society of Jesus in 1852, it is the ninth-oldest Jesuit college in the United States and the first college in the United States to bear the name of St. Ignatius of Loyola, the founder of the Society of Jesus.

Loyola&#x27;s main campus is in Baltimore and features Collegiate Gothic architecture and a pedestrian bridge across Charles Street. The university is academically divided into three schools: the Loyola College of Arts and Sciences, the Loyola School of Education, and the Sellinger School of Business and Management. It currently operates a Clinical Center at Belvedere Square in Baltimore. Loyola previously had graduate centers in Timonium (closed May 2024) and Columbia, Maryland (closed August 2023).

The student body comprises approximately 4,000 undergraduate and 1,900 graduate students, representing 39 states and 44 countries, and 84% of undergraduates reside on campus. The average class size is 20, with a student-to-faculty ratio of 12:1. Approximately 73% of the student body receives some form of financial aid. Campus groups include the Association of Latin American &amp; Spanish students (ALAS) and the Greyhound college newspaper. There is also the student-run, online-only publication, &quot;The Rival&quot;. This publication features opinion, commentary, and satire in its three sections: campus, culture, and current.

Notable alumni include Tom Clancy, author of many notable books such as &quot;The Hunt for Red October&quot;, and Mark Bowden, author of &quot;Black Hawk Down&quot;. Loyola&#x27;s sports teams are nicknamed the Greyhounds and are best known for the perennially ranked men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s lacrosse teams. The men&#x27;s lacrosse team&#x27;s biggest rival is nearby Johns Hopkins University. The annual lacrosse games played between these two institutions is known as the &quot;Battle of Charles Street&quot;. The school colors are green and grey.

==History==

===Founding===

Loyola College in Maryland was founded in 1852 by John Early and eight other members of the Society of Jesus (&quot;Jesuits&quot;), and was the first college in the United States to bear the name of St. Ignatius of Loyola. Loyola College in Maryland is the ninth-oldest among the nation&#x27;s 27 Jesuit colleges and universities.

The college&#x27;s first campus was in two large townhouses on Holliday Street between East Lexington Street (then called Orange Alley) and East Fayette Street, in downtown Baltimore. After only three years, in 1855, Loyola relocated to a newly built structure on North Calvert Street, between East Monument Street and East Madison Street, adjacent to and just south of newly established St. Ignatius Church in the city&#x27;s historic Mount Vernon-Belvedere neighborhood, and moved to its present &quot;Evergreen&quot; campus in north Baltimore on North Charles Street during 1922. Evening classes commenced in 1942.

===Expansion===

During the early 1930s, the high school section moved to nearby Towson, north of Baltimore. In 1949, the college established a graduate division in education, adding a graduate degree program in business management in 1968, a graduate program in speech pathology in 1971, and finance in 1973. Today, the college&#x27;s list of graduate programs has grown to include psychology, modern studies, pastoral counseling, computer science, and software engineering.

Loyola became coeducational in 1971, following its joining with Mount Saint Agnes College, a neighboring women&#x27;s college that was experiencing financial difficulties and closed following the joining. That same year, the college&#x27;s Board of Trustees elected its first lay chairperson.

Working from these foundations, Loyola has transformed itself from a small commuter college into a residential college with an undergraduate population of more than 4,000 students. In 1981, Loyola established a separate business school: The Rev. Joseph A. Sellinger, Jr., School of Business and Management. The school would expand geographically with two graduate centers in Timonium and Columbia, Maryland.

===Designation change===

The Executive Committee of the college&#x27;s Board of Trustees announced on August 20, 2008 its decision to change the institution&#x27;s name to Loyola University Maryland. Its request was approved on March 25, 2009 by the Maryland Higher Education Commission, with the change officially taking effect five months later on August 19. The Reverend Brian F. Linnane, SJ, the university&#x27;s president, stated that the &quot;college&quot; designation no longer fit the school and that its comprehensive array of academic fields, some with graduate programs, was better reflected in its new name.

===Jesuit tradition===
The Society of Jesus founded Loyola University Maryland in the tradition of Ignatius of Loyola. The Society of Jesus, and therefore Loyola University Maryland, operate according to the mandate Ad maiorem Dei gloriam (AMDG), directing their ends toward that which brings forth the &quot;greater glory of God.&quot; This cornerstone of the Jesuit philosophy functions to remind students that their education is meant to be applied toward the betterment of humanity and God&#x27;s worship, in particular. Loyola&#x27;s focus on cura personalis or the whole person&#x27;s education functions to attain that end. A broad base of knowledge, supported by a strong liberal arts core, prepares Jesuit students to undertake the goal of AMDG.

In keeping with this overarching principle, Loyola undergraduates must complete the core curriculum, including courses in English, philosophy, theology, ethics, history, fine arts, foreign language, mathematics, natural science, and social sciences. Though Loyola encourages plurality, its religious heritage is preserved and cultured by encouraging all of its students and faculty to cultivate and live by the core values of the Society of Jesus.

In 1950, following the admittance of Charles Henry Dorsey Jr., Loyola was awarded the Sidney Hollander Award for its contribution to the establishment of civil and political rights for African Americans in Maryland.

===Endowment===
Loyola&#x27;s endowment&#x27;s primary financial objective is to provide funds for the current and future support of the university&#x27;s operations and programs. The endowment consists of approximately 300 individual funds established for various purposes, including both donor-restricted endowment funds and funds designated by the Board of Trustees to function as endowments. As of May 31, 2018, the total assets of the endowment were $228.2 million.

Comprehensive capital campaigns have strengthened Loyola&#x27;s endowment. The recent &quot;Bright Minds, Bold Hearts&quot; campaign exceeded $100 million. The campaign, which concluded in May 2018, added over $54 million to the University&#x27;s endowment, created 115 new scholarships, increased the funding of 55 existing scholarships, enhanced athletic facilities, and strengthened Loyola&#x27;s academic experience, including programs in peace and justice studies, global studies, and Messina, an interdisciplinary living-learning experience for first-year students The campaign also supported the mission and ministry of the University through investment in the local community and Loyola&#x27;s York Road Initiative.

==Academics ==
The foundation of a Loyola education is a broad core program covering basic knowledge and concepts in the humanities, math, and science, and the social sciences. The purpose is to balance general education and specialized study in the major. Undergraduate degrees are awarded in three schools, Loyola College, the School of Education, and the Joseph A. Sellinger, S.J. School of Business and Management. The university operates on a semester system.

===Loyola College===
Coinciding with the university&#x27;s transition to its new name, the College of Arts and Sciences became Loyola College on August 19, 2009. It offers degrees in biology, chemistry, classics, communication, comparative cultures, and literary studies, computer science, economics, education, engineering science, English, fine arts, French, German, global studies, history, an honors program, interdisciplinary studies (including American, Asian, Catholic, film, gender, Latin American/Latino and medieval studies), law, mathematical science, military career, modern languages and literature, nursing, philosophy, physics, political science, pre-health curriculum/programs (including medicine, dentistry, veterinary medicine, and optometry/podiatry), psychology, sociology, Spanish, speech-language pathology/audiology, theology, forensic studies and writing.

===Sellinger School of Business and Management===
The Sellinger School of Business and Management offers degrees in accounting, business economics, finance, general business, international business, management, management information systems, marketing, and the Sellinger scholars program. In 1984 the business school was formally named the Joseph A. Sellinger, S.J. School of Business and Management in honor of the late Reverend Joseph A. Sellinger, earning accreditation in all programs by AACSB (The International Association for Management Education) in 1988. Loyola is the only private institution in the state of Maryland with a nationally accredited business school. In 1990, the accounting department earned specialized national accreditation from AACSB.

===School of Education===
Since 1946 the department of education has been one of the stronger academic pillars at Loyola. With the 2009 name designation change, President Linnane announced The School of Education&#x27;s opening, which was to be led by Peter C. Murrell, Jr. as the first dean. The School was officially opened on October 14, 2009. The School now offers undergraduate majors in Elementary Education and minors in Secondary Education and Special Education. Its graduate department offers Master of Arts (M.A.), Master of Arts in Teaching (MAT), Master of Education (M.Ed.), the Certificate of Advanced Study in School Management (C.S.M.), and the Certificate of Advanced Study in Education (CASE).

===Admission===
More than 10,000 students apply for admission as freshmen for approximately 1,000 spaces. The class of 2013 was the last applicant class that was required to submit SAT scores. The admission office has now begun a four-year pilot program that does not require standardized test scores, deeming them optional.

==Campus==

Loyola&#x27;s Evergreen campus spans along Charles Street in northern Baltimore. The college also owns in the mountains of western Maryland, used for the Rising Phoenix Retreat Center. The Loyola Clinical Centers have located just a short drive from the college&#x27;s main campus, in Belvedere Square. The Clinical Centers offer individuals in the community a broad range of services addressing educational, language, and psychological issues.

At the western side of the Quad on the Evergreen campus lies the Alumni Memorial Chapel of Our Lady. Formally dedicated on September 15, 1952, the chapel features Gothic architectural influences with large stained-glass windows and a long, narrow nave situated along the east-west axis. A statue of Our Lady of Evergreen, Queen of Peace, is situated above the front façade.

On the eastern side of the Quad, and in the center of campus, is the Tudor-style Humanities Center, originally built by the Garrett family in 1895 as a wedding gift for one of their children. Unfortunately, the child died during a trip to England, and the residence became a rehabilitation center for men blinded during the war. In 1921, Loyola&#x27;s Jesuits purchased the Garretts&#x27; Evergreen property and gradually moved the college from its location on Calvert Street. The mansion was originally used for classes but then became the Jesuit residence. In 1955, it suffered severe fire damage and was converted to offices following the restoration. Today, the Humanities Center houses 16 departments, including Admissions, Alumni Relations, Financial Aid, and the Philosophy, Theology, and History departments.

In the northern side of the Quad lies the Sellinger School of Business and Management, which opened in January 2000. The facility features a more contemporary style, with Spanish influences, including a soaring, five-story glass façade, open atrium, a four-story glass tower, and three seminar rooms.

On the southern side of the Quad lies Beatty Hall and Jenkins Hall. These buildings used to house classrooms, and Gothic and Edwardian architectural styles heavily influence various departments.

On the southwest side of the Quad is the Donnelly Science Center. The Donnelly Science Center was originally designed by J. Prentiss Browne, a prominent Baltimore architect, and built-in 1978. The academic building received an expansion in 2011 that included new laboratories.

The dormitories housing students are located west of the main campus and are connected by Loyola&#x27;s pedestrian bridge (or USF&amp;G Pedestrian Bridge), spanning Charles Street. In most cases, Loyola&#x27;s dormitories purchased apartment buildings, including Newman Towers, Campion Tower, and Seton Court. Further up North Charles Street is the Fitness and Aquatic Center, which opened in fall 2000, featuring a fitness center with treadmills, bikes, ellipticals, stair climbers, free weights, selectorized weight circuit, and stretching area. The Mangione Aquatic Center features an eight-lane, swim course; a shallow lane, and diving well as an on-deck sauna and hot tub. The indoor rock climbing wall and bouldering area is designed for all levels.
The FAC also has a two-court gymnasium used for club sports, intramural sports, and informal recreation. The Multi-Activity Court features a sports court surface ideal for indoor soccer, volleyball, and inline sports. The FAC also features an elevated walking/jogging track, two group exercise studios, an Outdoor Adventure Center, classroom and conference room, an equipment room, locker rooms, four racquetball, and two squash courts, and an outdoor grass field.

Loyola&#x27;s library is a shared facility with the adjacent Notre Dame of Maryland University (formerly College of Notre Dame of Maryland). The Loyola Notre Dame Library, located between the two schools, and features a interior; interactive study and instructional spaces; an exhibition area and curatorial space for special collections; expanded stack areas for humanities print collection; a café fully wired for voice, data, and video; five high-tech seminar rooms; digital studio for collaborative student and faculty projects; a media center with 96-seat auditorium; and a 24-seat, fully wired bibliographic classroom.

===Sustainability===
The University employs a full-time sustainability coordinator who serves and advises the sustainability committee to advance environmental sustainability on campus. Two roof-top solar panels were installed during the summer of 2008, and a green residence hall features recycled metal beams, a green roof, and geothermal heating and cooling. The student Environmental Action Club works to promote environmental stewardship and sustainability on campus. Loyola also partners with a hybrid-only taxi service to provide additional transportation resources. The University also began offering a Sustainability Management Major in 2020, the first in the state of Maryland. The major is accompanied by the student-run Loyola Sustainability Management Club.

== Student life ==
Loyola&#x27;s undergraduate body is composed of 3,580 students as of 2008. The racial diversity of the undergraduate student body was 85.0% white, 2.7% Asian, 5.1% black, and 3.4% Hispanic. Ninety-eight percent of freshmen and 81% of all undergraduate students live in college housing.

Loyola has more than 150 clubs and organizations, catering to a range of interests. The college operates a television station, WLOY TV, and a radio station, WLOY on 1620 kHz AM. The Greyhound is Loyola&#x27;s student-run newspaper. Loyola is also hosting an annual Relay for a Life event, raising $150,000 in 2007. ALANA (African, Latino, Asian and Native American) Student Services provides an array of activities to foster the academic, cultural, personal, spiritual, and leadership development of ALANA students, as well as create and maintain an environment of respect and awareness.

Loyola&#x27;s ROTC is an elective course taken along with a student&#x27;s required college courses. Students take one class and one lab each week, plus physical fitness training three times per week. Courses cover everything from the structure of the Army to military operations and tactics. Upon completion of the program, cadets are commissioned as officers in the U.S. Army. They must complete a service period in either the Active Duty, Army Reserve, or Army National Guard. Since its inception in 1952, the ROTC program has commissioned more than 1,100 cadets. Loyola&#x27;s Army ROTC program has a partnership with Towson University, Notre Dame of Maryland University, and Goucher College.

Sixty-five percent of Loyola&#x27;s undergraduate students studied abroad during their junior year. Students can choose from 21 different programs, exchanges, and affiliations in 16 countries.
*Loyola-sponsored programs include Alcala, Spain; Auckland, New Zealand; Bangkok, Thailand; Beijing, China; Cork, Ireland; Leuven, Belgium; Copenhagen, Denmark; Melbourne, Australia; Newcastle, England; Paris, France; and Rome, Italy.

*Milestone Reunion: Alumni and their families return to campus for their Milestone Reunion every five years since graduation to reconnect, remember, and relive their days on Evergreen. The reunion takes place the first weekend in June each year. Alumni celebrating their 50-year reunion are invited to a special ceremony and a dinner-dance to induct them as Golden Greyhounds. 
*Chordbusters: A twice-a-year concert where the male and female a cappella groups perform a set of songs. The concert happens at the end of each semester every year and features a comedic skit from each group and their arranged songs. The male group is called The Chimes and the female group is called The Belles.
*Black Student Association (BSA) Fashion Show: A one-night-only, student-led fashion show. The show aims to promote and celebrate diversity, where it is centered one a theme to focus on people of color.

===Activism===
Students at Loyola are very involved with advocacy and fundraising at a small and large level. The largest annually held event is called Relay For Life, which is a nationwide fundraising program for cancer research. As a university, Loyola has donated the most money in both 2006 and 2007.

==Center for Community Service and Justice==

More than half of the student population has participated in some community service activity during their time at Loyola. The Center for Community Service and Justice advances this Jesuit university&#x27;s objective of educating for the faith by offering a program of events and service experiences that supplement the classroom experience, engaging students by developing service opportunities a wide variety of areas. The center offers nearly 40 ongoing community service programs, more than 15 one-time service opportunities throughout the year, and several immersion programs. Students also can become involved through service learning, which pairs community service with academic coursework. In 2015 Loyola was rated by &quot;US News&quot; as among the top 25 colleges and universities for service learning.

The Center for Community Service and Justice is involved in several activities. Some examples include the Beans and Bread Center, which hosts 300 Baltimore&#x27;s poor for a meal each day. Loyola provides food and helps for this once a month. The Our Daily Bread Employment Center offers a meal, literacy training, general education, finding a job, and substance abuse recovery assistance. Volunteers from Loyola help with the meal program on scheduled Saturdays. The Immigration Awareness &amp; Advocacy Events include scheduled discussions and advocacy on issues such as the rights of migrant farmworkers, sex trafficking, and the situation of undocumented workers. The York Road Community Days involves students in improving the inner-city landscape, while building community with local churches and schools. Youth Education Awareness consists of service and advocacy opportunities, speakers, and panel discussions on the root causes of systemic problems affecting the schools and youth in Baltimore. 

During Spring Break, some activities that occur include Spring Break Outreach, Encounter El Salvador, a program in which students live with a rural family in El Salvador for a week, and Experience: Baltimore, which occurs in late August and involves introducing students to the various neighborhoods and the socioeconomic issues facing Baltimore, through various activities including service and conversations with the people.

==Athletics==

 Loyola fields 17 varsity teams and 22 club teams. The varsity teams participate in the NCAA&#x27;s Division I. All became members of the Patriot League on July 1, 2013. Previously all but two competed in the Metro Atlantic Athletic Conference (MAAC) from 1989 to 2013. The exceptions were the lacrosse teams – the men in the ECAC Lacrosse League and the women in the Big East Conference. The transition to a new conference was announced on August 29, 2012. Loyola has a student success rate for graduation of over 97% of its student athletes.

The school&#x27;s mascot is a Greyhound, and field sports are played at the Ridley Athletic Complex, located a few minutes from the Evergreen Campus on Cold Spring Lane. Loyola&#x27;s men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s lacrosse teams are particularly noteworthy as both have appeared in numerous NCAA tournaments and are highly ranked most years. The men&#x27;s lacrosse team won the NCAA Division I National Championship in 2012. The men&#x27;s soccer team has also enjoyed a great deal of success over time, winning the NCAA Division II National Championship in 1976, appearing various times in the NCAA Division I Tournament, and garnering several national rankings since its ascension into Division I in 1982. They also won against American to take the Patriot League tournament title home for the first time in 2021, and faced North Carolina in the NCAA tournament. 

Philip Scholz, a Paralympian, is an alumnus of the varsity men&#x27;s swimming team. Scholz is blind and holds various records for Paralympic swimming. Joe Wise, a paralympian, is a former student (2011-2015) and a member of the Loyola University Men&#x27;s Swim Team. Wise is a resident of Austin, Texas. Wise swam in the 2008 Beijing Paralympics and the 2012 London Paralympic Games. He holds several records for swimming in the United States. Katie Hoff, an Olympic medal winner, coached swimming at Loyola and attended classes at the school before leaving Baltimore to live in Fullerton, California. Brennan Morris, a member of the US National Team, is also a record-setting member of the swim team.

Loyola Maryland&#x27;s basketball team, under the leadership of Tavaras Hardy and the on-court presence of Santi Aldama, led them to the Patriot League Championship game after finishing 9th in the regular season. Santi Aldama scored 33 points in the Patriot League semifinals against Army, in a game where Loyola scored 67 points total. They also beat top-ranked Navy led by Ed Dechellis in their first game, who was at the time undefeated in the Patriot League that season. It was the most remarkable stretch of Loyola basketball since entering the Patriot League. 

Loyola&#x27;s Men&#x27;s and Women&#x27;s Rugby Teams have achieved national rankings operating under a unique model where both men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s teams share resources including Sean Lugano Memorial Field, an air dome facility suitable for all-weather play. https://www.urugby.com/urugby-news/loyola-university-maryland-announces-addition-womens-7s-rugby-program

<text>Volvo Aero was a Swedish aircraft, guided missiles and rocket engine manufacturer. It became &quot;GKN Aerospace Engine Systems&quot; following the company&#x27;s acquisition by British engineering conglomerate GKN during 2012.

It was originally established as &quot;Nohab Flygmotorfabriker AB&quot; in 1930 to produce aero engines. The firm became a part of SAAB during 1937; Volvo later purchased most of the stock, thus it was renamed &quot;Svenska Flygmotor AB&quot; (&quot;SFA&quot;) and later &quot;Volvo Flygmotor&quot;. It became the major engine supplier of the Swedish Air Force during the post-war period. During the 1970s, Volvo Flygmotor branched into the commercial aerospace sector, offering overhauls and subcomponent production for several international engine manufacturers, as well as into the European space sector.

During the 2000s, Volvo Aero focused on cooperative ventures with various partner companies around the globe. As a result of the Great Recession, Volvo Aero experienced a sustained downturn in business, resulting in layoffs and contributing to the firm&#x27;s sale. Parent company Volvo decided to sell their aerospace division amid the economic downturn; GKN emerged amongst several bidders as the frontrunner, finalising its purchase of Volvo Aero during 2012.
==History==

&quot;Nohab Flygmotorfabriker AB&quot; was founded in Trollhättan, Sweden, in 1930 to produce aircraft engines for the Swedish Board of Aviation. As reflected in the name of the company, it was a subsidiary of the Swedish manufacturing and railway locomotive specialist NOHAB. In 1937, the firm became a part of the newly-founded SAAB; however, during 1941, Volvo acquired a majority of the stock. Accordingly, the company&#x27;s name was changed to &quot;Svenska Flygmotor AB&quot; (&quot;SFA&quot;), and later on &quot;Volvo Flygmotor&quot;.

During the 1950s, the company leveraged partnerships with foreign engine manufacturers, helping it to acquire expertise in the recently developed turbojet engine. It undertook the licensed manufacture of several engines, such as the Rolls-Royce Avon (referred to in Swedish Air Force service as the &quot;RM5&quot; and &quot;RM6&quot;) and the Pratt &amp; Whitney JT8D (&quot;RM8&quot;). Throughout the post-war period, the company has served as the major engine supplier of the Swedish Air Force.

During the 1970s, the firm decided to apply the experience it had gathered on the production and service of military aircraft engines towards the commercial aerospace sector. The first overhaul services it offered were for the JT8 engine. Volvo Flygmotor soon expanded its activities into the manufacture of subcomponents for several international engine manufacturers, including General Electric, Pratt &amp; Whitney, and Rolls-Royce Plc.

Seeking to further growth of its commercial operations, Volvo Flygmotor became involved in the European Space Program, producing a number of components for the rocket engines that power the Ariane of heavy launch vehicles. The firm successfully expanded significantly beyond its domestic market. Recognised that that its name needed to be easily recognised internationally, the company changed its name to the &quot;Volvo Aero Corporation&quot; during the early 1990s.

By the late 1990s, Volvo Aero&#x27;s component range included fan cases, fan-compressor structures, compressor rotors, shafts, combustor structures, vanes, low-pressure turbine (LPT) cases, turbine structures, rocket nozzles, combustion chambers, and rocket engine turbines for both civilian and military purposes. By 2003, the firm&#x27;s workforce comprised 3,600 employees, it also recorded total sales of 0.9 billion euros during that year. Presently, Volvo Aero is a partner in more than ten commercial engine programmes and components produced by the company are installed in more than 90% of all large commercial aircraft engines sold.

During the 2000s, further efforts were made by Volvo Aero towards close cooperation with various industrial partners. During July 2008, Volvo Aero and Rolls-Royce signed a risk-and-revenue-sharing agreement for the Rolls-Royce Trent XWB turbofan engine, under which Volvo Aero developed and manufactured the intermediate compressor case, a key engine component; the firm estimated this contract&#x27;s value to be SEK40 billion over 40 years. In November 2008, Pratt &amp; Whitney and Volvo Aero Norge agreed for the latter to produce diffuser case components for the Pratt &amp; Whitney F135 engine; that same year, Volvo Aero secured work on the Pratt &amp; Whitney PW1000G engine as well. In June 2009, SNECMA and Volvo Aero agreed on the principles of a five-year partnership between the two companies in the space propulsion sector.

Following the start of the Great Recession in 2008, Volvo Aero shared in the general downturn in business activity. In January 2009, Volvo Aero announced the redundancy of 250 blue collar and 100 white collar employees; a further cut of 200 positions was announced as a result of the economic downturn in June 2009. A year-on-year downwards trend in its sales activity was observed in the years surrounding this time, stimulating parent company Volvo to examine the company&#x27;s future prospects. In September 2010, Volvo announced the sale of its US subsidiary, Volvo Aero Services, to a private equity firm.

By 2011, Volvo was seeking to dispose of its aero engine division to focus on its production of trucks and construction equipment. In March 2011, British engineering group GKN was reportedly being regarded as the frontrunner to acquire the company as several other bidders, including German engine specialist MTU Aero Engines, as well as private equity firms The Carlyle Group and Nordic Capital, decided to withdraw from their own acquisition ambitions. On 6 July 2012, Volvo Aero was acquired by the GKN in a SEK 6.9 billion deal. The sale was viewed as one step in a wider trend in the aerospace industry towards consolidation.

Following the Volvo Aero acquisition, GKN entered into a 15 month period of restructuring. During 2012, Volvo Aero declared that it intended to expand its engine component production range over the coming years.

==Test facility==

In the 1950s, the Swedish Air Board constructed an unusual test facility at Flygmotor. This was an engine test facility, a form of wind tunnel, which could operate at high inlet pressures, thus high Reynolds numbers. This tunnel was unique in being water-powered. A sealed underground chamber was blasted out of the granite beneath the Göta Canal. When the canal was allowed to flood the chamber, air was driven from it at high pressure and through the test chamber. A supersonic test of an engine could be carried out for around 10 minutes, after which it took 24 hours to pump the chamber dry again. Use of this test facility was shared with Rolls-Royce, who used it in 1953 to develop the afterburners of the Avon RA7 engine for the Supermarine Swift F3 and Saab 32 Lansen. The Avon RA14 afterburner would also be tested here, produced as the Flygmotor RM6B for the Saab 35 Draken.

==Products==

===Aircraft engines and components===
Volvo Aero is a supplier of single-engine systems for military aircraft. These have largely been in partnership with other engine manufacturers, such as the RM1 (de Havilland Goblin) for the Saab 21R, RM2 (de Havilland Ghost) for the Saab J29, RM5 and RM6 (Rolls-Royce Avon) for the Saab 32 Lansen, the RM6B for the Saab 35 Draken, and the RM8 (Pratt &amp; Whitney JT8D) for the Saab 37 Viggen. The Saab JAS 39 Gripen&#x27;s RM12 engine is a derivative of the General Electric F404.

Svenska Flygmotor also designed the B42, a horizontally-opposed four-cylinder engine, intended for the SAAB Safir. However, SAAB decided to use engines from de Havilland and Lycoming instead. In the end the B42 came to power the Infanterikanonvagn 103 assault gun. A follow-up called the B44 powered the Pansarbandvagn 301 armoured personnel carrier.

<text>Cerne Abbas () is a village and civil parish in the county of Dorset in southern England. It lies in the Dorset Council administrative area in the Cerne Valley in the Dorset Downs. The village lies just east of the A352 road north of Dorchester. Dorset County Council estimate that the population of the civil parish in 2013 was 820. In the 2011 census the population of the civil parish, combined with the small neighbouring parish of Up Cerne, was 784.

In 2008 it was voted Britain&#x27;s &quot;Most Desirable Village&quot; by estate agent Savills. It is the location of the Cerne Abbas Giant, a chalk figure of a giant naked man on a hillside.

==History==

The village of Cerne Abbas grew up around the great Benedictine abbey, Cerne Abbey, which was founded there in AD 987 (Abbas is Medieval Latin for &quot;abbot&quot;). The Domesday Book of 1086 recorded cultivated land for 20 ploughs, with 26 villeins and 32 bordars. The abbey dominated the area for more than 500 years. It was surrendered to Henry VIII in 1539 with the Dissolution of the Monasteries and was largely destroyed; a portion of the Abbot&#x27;s Porch and Abbey guesthouse remain. St Augustine&#x27;s Well, reputedly blessed by the saint, also remains. St Mary&#x27;s Church, built by the abbey for the parish in the late 13th century, is in the heart of the parish and retains many original features.

In the centuries after the Dissolution, the village thrived as a small market town. Its wealth was partly generated by brewing, its underground water making it famous for the quality of its beer, which was sold as far away as London and was even exported to the Americas. At one time, Cerne Abbas had 14 public houses, serving visitors and a population of about 1,500. The availability of water power also gave rise to milling, tanning, silk weaving, glove and hat making and many other small industries.

The coming of the railways in the 19th century bypassed Cerne and the village went into decline. By 1906, the population had halved and many of the houses had fallen into disrepair. In 1919, the village was sold by the Pitt-Rivers estate, which had owned it. The village now has a local school, a post office, three remaining historic public houses, tearooms and a number of other shops.

In &quot;Buildings of England&quot;, Nikolaus Pevsner claims that the Abbey Farm House, which was rebuilt after a fire in the mid-1700s, was formerly the main gateway to the abbey. When rebuilt, the central window of the former gateway projection was given an unusual &quot;Gothic Venetian&quot; window.

In 2023, archaeologists began digging to find the long lost ruins of Cerne Abbey.

==Tourist attractions==

Cerne Abbas attracts many tourists, who are drawn by the Cerne river, streets lined with historic stone houses, the Abbey, the Giant, and various events including a classical music festival. The church of St Mary is of 13th-century origin but was largely rebuilt in the 15th and early 16th centuries and partly reconstructed in the 17th century. Features of interest include the 17th-century pulpit and the great east window which probably came from the abbey.

=== Cerne Abbas Giant ===

The best known attraction is the Cerne Abbas Giant, a 55-metre (180 ft) naked figure carved into the chalk hillside. The giant, owned by the National Trust, is thought to be an Iron Age fertility symbol but, as it is unlikely that the monks of Cerne Abbey would have tolerated such a figure, and with no records before the 17th century, this cannot be confirmed. Many scholars think that it was created in the mid-17th century, although there is evidence of Iron Age settlement on the downs nearby.

=== Events ===
Each June, the Cerne Abbas Open Gardens can attract over a thousand visitors. Other events include horticultural shows, the annual village fete, the Cerne Abbas Music Festival, and the Wessex Morris Men often perform in the village on Bank Holidays. The four-day music festival began in 1990 and hosts classical artists of world renown.

==Notable people==
*Joseph Clark (1834–1926), painter, was born in Cerne Abbas
*Joseph Benwell Clark (1857–1938), artist, was born in Cerne Abbas and retired here
*Kate Adie (born 1945), journalist, lives at Cerne Abbas

==Literature==
* Cerne Abbas features in Thomas Hardy&#x27;s Wessex as &quot;Abbots Cernel&quot;.
* &quot;School of the Night&quot;, a mystery by Judith Cook set in Elizabethan England, contains scenes set in Cerne Abbas, and mentions the Cerne Abbas Giant.
* &quot;Unconquered&quot;, a historical novel by Neil Swanson set in pre-Revolutionary England and America, describes Abigail Hale&#x27;s upbringing in Cerne Abbas.
* In John Le Carré&#x27;s &quot;A Murder of Quality&quot;, the murder occurs in &quot;Carne Abbas&quot; in &quot;Dorsett&quot;.
* Australian authors Kate Forsythe and Kim Wilkins collaborated in 2017 on a book of short stories, &quot;The Silver Well&quot;, all set in Cerne Abbas. Each story is set in a different time in the village&#x27;s history, with the book spanning AD 44 and 2017.

<text>Chieveley is a village and large civil parish centred north of Newbury in Berkshire, close to the M4 motorway and A34 road. Chieveley services are within the parish.

==Geography==

A map of 1877 gave the area as . The landscape is of gently rolling chalk hills. The land is predominantly arable with some dairy, sheep and pigs. There is a healthy quantity of woodland and abundant wildlife. There is a network of green lanes and footpaths that afford good walking. The northern end of Chieveley village is known as Downend. As well as Chieveley, the civil parish also consists of the village of Curridge and the hamlets of Oare and Snelsmore Common. The original parish also included Leckhampstead and Winterbourne as well.

The structure has been much affected by roads. The M4 motorway, opened in 1971, passes east–west through the middle of the parish and has done much to cut Curridge and Oare off from Chieveley. The A34, a major trunk road, running north–south, quarters the parish. Its path has moved several times, the most recent development being a change to Junction 13 that opened in Autumn 2004. Chieveley services is at junction 13 of the M4, where these two roads meet. The landscape is dominated by farming. There are currently three working farms in the parish. Other industries include a garden centre, land-fill site, hotels, a baker and some small businesses.

==History==

There is archeological evidence that indicates early settlement in the area. The parish has an Iron Age hillfort in Snelsmore, called Bussock Camp. This is in private grounds, but is visible in May when they are opened to the public to view the bluebells. The name &quot;Chieveley&quot; is said to be derived from &quot;Field of Chives&quot;. The Women&#x27;s Institute&#x27;s Berkshire Book assures the reader that chives were noted in the area as far back as 951. This is the same year that King Eadred gave the village to his bailiff, Wulf. The Domesday Book of 1086 says this of Chieveley:
This text is a structured shorthand tax assessment and identifies 39 men, many of whom would have had their own households, and three serfs, a form of slavery done away with early in the feudal system, generally in the era of Magna Carta. In August 1207, King John seems to have had a good few days&#x27; hunting in West Berkshire. He is reported in Curridge on the 3rd and Chieveley on the 5th. Chieveley once had its own maypole, on the site now occupied by Maypole Cottage (on the corner of the High Street and Church Lane).

===St Mary&#x27;s Church===
It is likely that there was a Saxon church before it was replaced by the Normans. The present church is a Grade II* listed building and visible parts date from the 13th century. The chancel and lower stage of the bell tower date from then with the upper part of the tower from the following century. The 15th century saw the insertion of a window in the south-west of the chancel and the font is of this period. The church was heavily restored in the 19th century including rendering and buttresses outside. Chieveley parish registers start on 10 April 1560. There are still several families in the area who were recorded in those annals. The first vicar of Chieveley was Elias, appointed in 1154.

The church is equipped with eight bells (tenor in F) hung for English style change ringing. Two of the bells pre-date the Commonwealth period, the number 6 ( in A) of 1584 (founder Joseph Carter) and the number 4 ( in C) of 1633 (founder Ellis I Knight). In addition there is a Sanctus bell.

==Transport==
Chieveley is served by bus services 6, 6A and 107 from Newbury.

<text>Rudolf Jung (16 April 1882 – 11 December 1945) was a Nazi theoretician and the head of the German Bohemian Nazi movement from 1926 to 1933 before he immigrated to Germany. He joined the Nazi Party, was made an Honorary &quot;Gauleiter&quot; and became an SS-&quot;Gruppenführer&quot;. After the end of the Second World War, he was arrested and imprisoned by the Czechoslovak government but committed suicide before he could be brought to trial.

== Biography ==
=== Early life and education ===
Jung was born the son of a railway official in Plasy, Bohemia when it was part of Austria-Hungary, and attended the German-language &quot;Volksschule&quot; and &quot;Oberrealschule&quot; between 1888 and 1900 in Iglau (today, Jihlava). He studied mechanical engineering at the Technische Hochschule in Vienna, graduating with a degree in engineering in 1905. While a student, he joined the &quot;Burschenschaft Markomannia&quot;, a student association, and he was the student body chairman in 1903–1904. He passed his state engineering examination in July 1905. Beginning in October of that year, he performed military service as a one-year volunteer with the Austro-Hungarian Navy in the rank of &quot;Seekadett&quot;, and was assigned to the protected cruiser &quot;SMS Kaiserin Elisabeth&quot;. Returning to civilian life, Jung entered government service in October 1906 with the Imperial Royal Austrian State Railways as a mechanical engineer, later becoming an inspector and workshop manager in Vienna and Reichenberg (today, Liberec). In 1907, he joined the völkisch Reich League of German Railway Workers and became a member of the leadership from 15 June 1908.

=== Political activities in Austria-Hungary and Czechoslovakia ===

On 1 July 1909, Jung joined the pan-German German Workers&#x27; Party (DAP) and became an ardent party agitator. Jung was fired from his railway job in 1910 because of his political activism but the party put him on its payroll and he devoted himself to theoretical work. Along with Dr. Walter Riehl, Jung drafted a revised party program at Iglau in 1913 &quot;which contained a more detailed comparison of international Marxism and national socialism to highlight their ideological differences and a more pointed attack on capitalism, democracy, alien peoples, and Jews. Here, anti-Semitism ranked behind anti-Slavism, anti-clericalism and anti-capitalism&quot;. The Iglau program would serve as the basis from which Jung&#x27;s later political theories, and those of the forthcoming Nazi movement in Germany, would evolve. During this period Jung coined the slogan &quot;Gemeinnutz geht vor Eigennutz&quot; (common good comes before self-interest). This would become a central tenet of Nazi ideology. During the First World War, he advocated that Germans seize &quot;Lebensraum&quot; in the east.

In June 1913, Jung was elected as a DAP delegate to the Moravian &quot;Landtag&quot; (state parliament) and at the time was its youngest member. He also served as a city councilor in Iglau. In 1915, city authorities banned him from public speaking for allegedly arousing working class discontent over food shortages. At a meeting in Vienna in early May 1918, the DAP was renamed the &quot;Deutsche Nationalsozialistische Arbeiterpartei&quot; (DNSAP) and Jung became member number 85. He was also the chief author of the new DNSAP program, which advocated for Austrian union with the German Reich. The program predated the German Nazi Party&#x27;s 25-point Program by almost two years. Soon however, the DNSAP had split in two as a result of the establishment of the nation of Czechoslovakia, its Bohemian and Austrian branches forced to reconstitute themselves as separate independent parties. On 16 November 1919, Jung left the Austrian branch and became a member of the DNSAP of Czechoslovakia. Jung became Second Chairman of the Party under First Chairman Hans Knirsch, and also served as the Deputy Chairman of the Moravian-Silesian Region. He became the publisher of the German-language Party newspaper &quot;Neuen Zeit&quot; (New Time) in Troppau (today, Opava), as well as the co-editor of the monthly magazine &quot;Volk und Gemeinder&quot; (People and Community).

In 1919, Jung completed his theoretical work &quot;Der Nationale Sozialismus: Seine Grundlagen, Sein Werdegang, und Seine Ziele&quot; (National Socialism: its Foundations, its Development, and its Goals). In his introduction, he expressed the hope that his book would play the same role for National Socialism that &quot;Das Kapital&quot; had for Marxist international socialism.

The impact of Jung’s work cannot be overstated, despite its obscurity now. &quot;Nationale Sozialismus&quot; anticipated Gottfried Feder’s &quot;Der deutsche Staat auf nationaler und sozialer Grundlage&quot; (The German State on a National and Social Basis) by four years, Hitler’s &quot;Mein Kampf&quot; by six, and Alfred Rosenberg’s &quot;Der Mythus des zwanzigsten Jahrhunderts&quot; (The Myth of the 20th Century) by over a decade. It was the first major work dealing with National Socialist theory and ideology, and it was to provide all subsequent works with much of their tone, their substance, and their slogans … Jung’s book is one of the great overlooked works of National Socialist political theory.

From 18 April 1920 until 11 November 1933, Jung sat as a deputy in the Czechoslovak Chamber of Deputies, serving as the faction leader of the DNSAP deputies in that body. He is reported to have helped influence the German Workers&#x27; Party, the DNSAP&#x27;s counterpart in Germany, to include the term &quot;National Socialist&quot; in its name on 24 February 1920, to emphasize its anti-capitalist stance and to align itself with the Austrian and Czechoslovakian parties. Adolf Hitler, at that time a 30-year-old rising orator in the German DAP, wanted to rename it the &quot;Social Revolutionary Party&quot;. Jung first met Hitler on 7 August 1920 in Salzburg, at an inter-state conference of National Socialists from several central European nations. Though aimed at forging fraternal connections among them, Hitler characteristically avoided tying himself too closely to these other groups. Jung, however, frequently collaborated with the German Nazis throughout the 1920s. He spoke alongside Hitler on the theme of &quot;National Socialism and Germany&#x27;s Future&quot; at the &quot;Sofiensaal&quot; in Vienna on 17 June 1922. Jung dedicated the third edition of his book to Hitler in 1923 and, following Hitler&#x27;s imprisonment in the wake of the failed Beer Hall Putsch of November of that year, Jung frequently visited Hitler in Landsberg Prison. After one of these meetings, Jung described Hitler in a newspaper article as a martyr of the movement and compared him to Jesus. In March 1926, Jung attended a Nazi Party rally in Essen along with Joseph Goebbels, who was a leader of the Party in the Ruhr at that time. Together with his fellow DNSAP leader and parliamentarian Hans Krebs, Jung also attended the Nuremberg Nazi Party rally on 19–21 August 1927.

Jung advanced to First Chairman of the DNSAP on 17 May 1926, a post he would hold until the Party was officially banned by the Czech authorities in October 1933. On 1 May 1931, he also entered the leadership of the DNSAP&#x27;s paramilitary organization, the &quot;Volkssport Verband&quot; (People&#x27;s Sport Association). It was formed under the guise of a sporting and hiking organization but was based on the model of the Nazi Party &quot;Sturmabteilung&quot; (SA) in Germany. Its members wore brown uniforms like those of the SA and staged large rallies and marches agitating for unification with Germany. They held joint exercises with the SA and in one of these, in January 1931, SA troops crossed the border into Czech territory. The Czechoslovak government first banned the wearing of the brown uniform and, on 1 March 1932, outlawed the organization entirely. Several &quot;Volkssport Verband&quot; members were indicted and put on trial for high treason in Brno between 8 August and 24 September 1932. During the trial, Jung was implicated but was protected by parliamentary immunity. The DNSAP was banned by the Czechoslovak government on 4 October 1933; Jung was arrested that day and was expelled from his parliamentary seat on 11 November. Released from prison after seven months, his effectiveness was limited as he was deprived of his power base and placed under surveillance by the police.

=== Career in Nazi Germany ===
Jung left Czechoslovakia and emigrated to Germany on 14 September 1935. He joined the Nazi Party, was granted an effective date of 1 April 1925 and was assigned his old DNSAP party membership number of 85. He was granted German citizenship two months later and, on 1 December, was appointed as a lecturer at the &quot;Deutsche Hochschule für Politik&quot; (German Academy for Politics) in Berlin. The &quot;Technische Hochschule zu Berlin&quot; granted him an honorary doctorate in engineering on 9 April 1936. Hitler, on 9 June 1938, awarded the title of professor to Jung who then held a professorship at the Academy to 1940, lecturing in political theory and publishing numerous works on ideological issues as well as articles agitating against the Czech people and the Czech state. Jung also became involved in politics and, on 29 March 1936, he was elected as a deputy to the &quot;Reichstag&quot; for electoral constituency 6, Pomerania. After the 10 April 1938 election, he represented constituency 18, Westphalia-South. On 15 June 1938, Hitler appointed him an honorary &quot;Gauleiter&quot; of the Nazi Party. He was also awarded the Golden Party Badge.

Jung joined the SS (membership number 276,690) on 17 June 1936 with the rank of SS-&quot;Sturmbannführer&quot; and was attached to the staff of &quot;Reichsführer-SS&quot; Heinrich Himmler. He was also appointed as a part-time employee of the &quot;Sicherheitsdienst&quot; (SD). He progressively moved up the SS ranks to SS-&quot;Obersturmbannführer&quot; (9 November 1936), SS-&quot;Standartenführer&quot; (30 January 1937) SS-&quot;Oberführer&quot; (12 September 1937) SS-&quot;Brigadeführer&quot; (30 January 1941) and, finally, SS-&quot;Gruppenführer&quot; (16 April 1942).

In 1938, Jung was made a member of the Scientific Council of the German Foreign Institute in Stuttgart. In October of that year, following the Munich agreement and the cession of the Sudetenland to Germany, he hoped for a high level leadership appointment in the new territory but was only made the department head for economy and agriculture in the administration set up by &quot;Reichskommissar&quot; and &quot;Gauleiter&quot; Konrad Henlein. Reports in July 1939 indicated that he was to replace the rector of the Charles University in Prague, however the appointment went to . From 1 February 1940 to 1 September 1943, Jung was appointed by &quot;Reichsminister&quot; for Labor Franz Seldte as the President of the State Labor Office for central Germany (Thuringia, Saxony &amp; Anhalt) based in Erfurt. Additionally, in March 1942, he was placed on the technical staff of Fritz Sauckel, the General Plenipotentiary for the Allocation of Labor, and acted as his authorized representative. Sauckel proposed Jung for the post of undersecretary in the Labor Ministry, but this did not materialize. In March 1943, Jung&#x27;s name also was proposed as the &quot;Primátor&quot; (mayor) of Prague but no appointment was made. On 1 September 1943, Jung was made an honorary Inspector and head of the Reich Inspectorate for Labor Administration in Berlin but was placed in temporary retirement in November. He then was employed as the general director of the Prague Credit Union from 1 May 1944 and also served as honorary chairman of the Reinhard Heydrich Endowment in Prague. In December 1944, he obtained an appointment as the Plenipotentiary for Labor Deployment in the Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia.

In the SS, Jung was attached to the SS-&quot;Oberabschnitt&quot; Fulda-Werra in Bad Arolsen from 1 April to 1 December 1944, and then transferred to SS-&quot;Oberabschnitt Böhmen-Mähren&quot; headquartered in Prague. In March 1945, as the Red Army approached from the east, he sent his family back to Germany for safety but he remained at his post until the end of the war in Europe.

=== Post-war ===
On 5 May 1945, Jung was arrested in Prague during the Prague uprising and imprisoned in Pankrác Prison. On 11 December 1945, he committed suicide by hanging himself in his prison cell before being brought to trial for his role in the German occupation.

== Career dissatisfaction ==
Given Jung&#x27;s long history as a pioneer of Nazism, his early and close association with Hitler and his strong association with his homeland, his outlook for a successful career should have been assured once Nazi Germany took control of Czechoslovakia. However, it was not to be.
Jung, then, must have been particularly satisfied when the Reich finally annexed the Sudetenland in 1938, followed by the rest of the Czech lands in early 1939. Jung’s hope was that he would have a place in the administration of this new region of the Reich, aspiring to be made &quot;Gauleiter&quot;, mayor of Prague or, at the very least, &quot;Rektor&quot; of Prague University. Jung, to his chagrin, was to be passed over … He and his family did move back to the newly-christened ‘Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia’ in 1943, but only so Jung could take up the post of Reich Inspector for Labor Management in the Protectorate, a fairly unassuming public service role … Those who knew Jung in this period, so close to the end of the War and also (unbeknownst to him) to the end of his life, reported that he was an unsatisfied man. At one time Jung had been a key leader in an international political movement, a major thinker who saw himself (and was seen by others) as the ‘Karl Marx’ of a vital new economic worldview. Now, however, that same movement had passed Jung by, had grown beyond his control, and had left him behind as a minor official in a minor part of the Reich.

== Selected writings ==
Jung produced many books on the topic of Nazi theory and on the German-Czech conflict. Below is a sample of his most important works.

* &quot;Der nationale Sozialismus, Seine Grundlagen, sein Werdegang und seine Ziele&quot; (first edition, 1919; second edition, 1922; third edition, 1923)
