<text>Hōkūlea is a performance-accurate &quot;waa kaulua&quot;, a Polynesian double-hulled voyaging canoe. Launched on 8 March 1975 by the Polynesian Voyaging Society, it is best known for its 1976 Hawaii to Tahiti voyage completed with exclusively traditional navigation techniques. The primary goal of the voyage was to explore the anthropological theory of the Asiatic origin of native Oceanic people (Polynesians and Hawaiians in particular) as the result of purposeful trips through the Pacific, as opposed to passive drifting on currents or sailing from the Americas. DNA analysis supports this theory. A secondary project goal was to have the canoe and voyage &quot;serve as vehicles for the cultural revitalization of Hawaiians and other Polynesians.&quot;

Between the 1976 voyage and 2009, &quot;Hōkūle‘a&quot; completed additional voyages to Micronesia, Polynesia, Japan, Canada and the mainland United States, all using ancient wayfinding techniques of celestial navigation. On 19 January 2007, &quot;Hōkūle‘a&quot; left Hawaii with the voyaging canoe &quot;Alingano Maisu&quot; on a voyage through Micronesia (map) and ports in southern Japan. The voyage was expected to take five months. On 9 June 2007, &quot;Hōkūle‘a&quot; completed the &quot;One Ocean, One People&quot; voyage to Yokohama, Japan. On 5 April 2009, &quot;Hōkūle‘a&quot; returned to Honolulu following a roundtrip training sail to Palmyra Atoll, undertaken to develop skills of potential crewmembers for &quot;Hōkūle‘a&#x27;s&quot; eventual circumnavigation of the Earth.

On 18 May 2014 &quot;Hōkūle‘a&quot; and its sister vessel, &quot;Hikianalia&quot; embarked from Oahu for &quot;Malama Honua,&quot; a three-year circumnavigation of the earth. It returned to port in Hawaii on 17 June 2017. The journey covered 47,000 nautical miles with stops at 85 ports in 26 countries.

In between voyages, &quot;Hōkūle‘a&quot; is moored at the Marine Education Training Center (METC) of Honolulu Community College in Honolulu Harbor.

==Construction==
Polynesian voyaging canoes were made from wood, whereas &quot;Hōkūle‘a&quot; incorporates plywood, fiberglass and resin. &quot;Hōkūle‘a&quot; measures LOA, at beam, displaces when empty and can carry another of gear, supplies and 12 to 16 crew. Fully laden, with its sail area, it is capable of speeds of . The twin wood masts were built by LeVan Keola Sequeira. They are rigged either crab claw or Marconi style with a small jib. It is steered with a long paddle. It has no auxiliary motor. Its escort vessel tows it into harbor when necessary. Its name means &quot;star of gladness&quot; in Hawaiian, which refers to Arcturus, a guiding zenith star for Hawaiian navigators. Arcturus passes directly overhead at Hawaii&#x27;s latitude, helping sailors find the island.

==Pius &quot;Mau&quot; Piailug==
&quot;Hōkūle‘a&quot; navigates without instruments. In 1975, no living Hawaiian knew the ancient techniques for blue water voyaging. To enable the voyage, the Polynesian Voyaging Society recruited the Satawalese Master Navigator Mau Piailug (of the Weriyeng school in the Caroline Islands (map) of the Federated States of Micronesia (map)) to share his knowledge of non-instrument navigation. While as many as six Micronesian navigators had mastered these traditional methods as of the mid-1970s, only Mau was willing to share his knowledge.

Mau, who &quot;barely spoke English&quot;, decided that by reaching beyond his own culture, sharing what had been closely guarded knowledge, he could possibly save it from extinction. Through this collaboration, Mau&#x27;s mentorship helped &quot;spark pride in the Hawaiian and Polynesian culture&quot;, leading to &quot;a renaissance of voyaging, canoe building, and non-instrument navigation that has continued to grow, spreading across Polynesia (map) and reaching to its far corners of Aotearoa, New Zealand and Rapanui, Easter Island&quot;.

==Voyages==

=== Inaugural voyage (1976) ===

Led by Captain Elia David Kuualoha &quot;Kawika&quot; Kapahulehua* and Navigator Pius &quot;Mau&quot; Piailug, a Carolinian master navigator*, &quot;Hōkūlea&quot; departed Honolua Bay, Maui, Hawaii for Papeete, Tahiti, (voyage map) as part of the celebration of the United States Bicentennial. Mau navigated from Hawaii to Tahiti without instruments. Due to a conflict between crew members which escalated into physical violence, Mau abruptly returned home to Micronesia after reaching Tahiti. &quot;Hōkūleʻa&quot; had to be navigated back using western instruments (compass, nautical charts, sextant, chronometer, dividers, parallel rulers, pencil, nautical almanac).

On board the inaugural voyage was Hoku, a golden hair Hawaiian Poi Dog backbred by Jack L. Throp of the Honolulu Zoo. Razor-backed pigs and Polynesian chickens were also bred at the zoo for the voyage, but the director would not part with them at the last minute. Instead, the voyage hurriedly brought a white domesticated pig from Kōkeʻe, Kauai named Maxwell, and a cock and hen. The purpose of the animals was to study how to feed and care for these animals, which had been transported by the Polynesians during their voyages.

=== &quot;Kealaikahiki&quot; project (1977) ===

In English, the Hawaiian &quot;Ke ala i kahiki&quot; means &quot;the path to Tahiti.&quot; The &quot;Kealaikahiki Project&quot; recreated the traditional Kealaikahiki Point departure of ancient voyages to Tahiti. Gordon Piianaia&#x27;s idea to recreate traditional departures took &quot;Hōkūlea&quot; southeast, across Kealaikahiki Channel between Lānai and Kahoolawe Islands, past Kealaikahiki Point, into the Alenuihāhā Channel and the northeast trade winds. The object was to determine whether &quot;Hōkūlea&quot;, departing from west of the 1976 departure point, would bisect the more easterly 1976 voyage track, and so likely reach Tahiti were it to continue. After heading south for two days, &quot;Hōkūlea&quot; did not bisect the 1976 voyage track, but likely would have (further south than anticipated). It came about and returned to Hawaii. The traditional departure point would be used for subsequent sailings to Tahiti.

=== Tahiti voyage (1978) ===

Following the 1976 voyage, Nainoa Thompson attempted to teach himself how to navigate without instruments, using only the position of stars and ocean cues, based on information he learned from books, planetarium observations, and short voyages in Hawaiian waters. In 1978, the crew of &quot;Hōkūlea&quot; attempted a second voyage to Tahiti, which was aborted when &quot;Hōkūlea&quot; capsized in high wind and seas southwest of the Island of Molokai, five hours after departing Honolulu&#x27;s Ala Wai Harbor. The crew hung on to the capsized canoe through the night. Flares were unseen by passing aircraft; the emergency radio reached no help. By mid-morning, with no sign of imminent rescue and the capsized canoe drifting farther from land, Eddie Aikau, a North Shore, Oahu, lifeguard and big-wave surfer, volunteered to paddle a surfboard to Lānai for help. About nine hours later, flares launched by the crew were spotted by a Hawaiian Airlines flight which circled &quot;Hōkūlea&quot; and radioed the United States Coast Guard (&quot;USCG&quot;). Half an hour later, a USCG search and rescue helicopter was hovering overhead; &quot;Hōkūlea&quot; crew was rescued. The following morning, the USCGC Cape Corwin towed the vessel, from 22 miles southwest of Lāau Point, Molokai, back to Honolulu. Despite intensive land, air and sea search, Eddie Aikau was never seen again. &quot;Hōkūlea&quot; carries a plaque in his memory. Subsequent voyages were accompanied by an escort vessel.

=== Tahiti voyage (1980) ===

After the 1978 disaster, Mau returned and gave Nainoa further training on traditional navigation techniques. In 1980, Nainoa Thompson recreated the 1976 voyage to Tahiti to become the first Native Hawaiian in modern times to navigate a canoe thousands of miles without instruments. Mau sailed as an observer. After 29 days at sea, before sighting Mataiva on the way to Tahiti, Mau offered Nainoa only one correction; of Nainoa&#x27;s interpretation of sighting a land-based seabird in mid-morning flight. Such birds generally fly seaward for food at morning and return to land in the evening. While it can usually be assumed that land lies opposite the birds&#x27; morning flight direction, this bird spotted mid-morning (during nesting season), carried a fish in its beak. This detail suggested to Mau that the bird&#x27;s morning flight was not away from land but toward it. The bird was not flying seaward to find more fish, but rather, was returning to land, to feed its young. Leading up to the voyage, an extensive, formal crew training program helped to ensure a safe voyage. Escort boat &quot;Ishka&quot; followed for safety.

=== Voyage of Rediscovery (1985–1987) ===

In the &quot;Voyage of Rediscovery&quot;, &quot;Hōkūlea&quot; traveled to destinations throughout Polynesia. Inviting fellow Polynesians to join the crew on legs of the voyage extended &quot;Hōkūlea&#x27;s&quot; success in revitalizing interest in Polynesian culture. For instance, professional Tongan sea captain Sione Taupeamuhu was aboard during a night passage from Tongatapu to Nomuka in the northerly Haapai Islands group of Tonga (map). He was skeptical that &quot;Hōkūlea&quot; navigator Nainoa Thompson could find Nomuka without instruments. When Nomuka appeared on the horizon at dawn as anticipated, Taupeamuhu remarked, &quot;Now I can believe the stories of my ancestors.&quot; &quot;Dorcas&quot; and &quot;Maalea&quot; served as escort vessels.

==== Spring voyage segment ====
In the spring, &quot;Hōkūlea&quot;, along with sister ships &quot;Hawai‘iloa&quot; and &quot;Makali‘i&quot;, sailed from Hawaii to Tahiti. They participated in a gathering of voyaging canoes from across Oceania at nearby Marae Taputapuatea, Raiatea, which led to the lifting of a six-centuries-old tapu on voyaging from Raiatea. Then all the canoes returned to Tahiti, sailed to Nuku Hiva in the Marquesas and on to Hawaii. This was only the first part of a voyage spanning spring and summer known as &quot;Nā Ohana Holo Moana&quot; or The Voyaging Families of the Vast Ocean&quot;.&quot; &quot;Hōkūlea&quot; was escorted by &quot;Gershon II&quot; under Steve Kornberg; &quot;Rizaldar&quot;, under Randy Wichman, also escorted.

==== Summer voyage segment ====
In the summer: &quot;Hōkūlea&quot; and &quot;Hawai‘iloa&quot; sailed the West Coast of the United States. Both vessels were shipped from Hawaii to Seattle, Washington, after which they sailed to Vancouver, British Columbia. They visited intermediate ports, where local American Indian tribes often hosted them to a dinner and gift exchange. From Vancouver, &quot;Hawai‘iloa&quot; sailed as far north as Haines, Alaska. &quot;Hōkūlea&quot; sailed south to San Diego via Portland, Oregon, and the California ports of San Francisco, Santa Barbara, and Long Beach. The voyaging canoes were shipped back to Hawaii: &quot;Hōkūlea&quot; from San Pedro; &quot;Hawai‘iloa&quot; from Seattle. This summer part of the voyage promoted cultural and educational exchanges with Hawaiians (some of whom had never been to Hawaii), Native Americans, and other people living on the United States West Coast.

=== Navigating Change (2003–2004) ===

In 2003, &quot;Hōkūlea&quot; sailed to Nihoa, the closest of the &quot;leeward,&quot; or Northwestern Hawaiian Islands (maps: small and large scale), to set the stage for the 2004 voyage to the furthest, most westerly of them, Kure Atoll. &quot;Hōkūlea&#x27;s&quot; 2004 voyage took the canoe through the area now comprising the Papahānaumokuākea Marine National Monument to promote stewardship and awareness of this area. &quot;Hōkūlea&quot; participated in an interagency initiative with this voyage named after it, called &quot;Navigating Change&quot;. Upon reaching the remote islands, the crew helped remove hundreds of pounds of washed-up fishing nets that threatened Hawaiian monk seals and Hawaiian Green sea turtles and also helped with plant conservation. About 1,600 schoolchildren linked to the vessel by daily satellite phone calls. Teachers prepared with curriculum guides, video and web resources. Navigating Change was supported by US Fish &amp; Wildlife Service, Polynesian Voyaging Society, Bishop Museum, NOAA, Hawai&#x27;i Department of Education, Hawai&#x27;i Department of Land and Natural Resources, Hawaii Maritime Center, University of Hawaii, The Nature Conservancy, Western Pacific Regional Fishery Management Council, Coastal Zone Management Hawaii, National Fish and Wildlife Foundation, Harold K.L. Castle Foundation and the Pacific American Foundation. &quot;Kama Hele&quot; escorted the voyage.

=== One Ocean, One People (2007) ===

The One Ocean, One People theme united two voyages in celebration of Pacific voyaging, Pacific Islands, and cultural ties, in passages to Micronesia and Japan. These voyages were named &quot;Kū Holo Mau&quot; and &quot;Kū Holo Lā Komohana&quot;. &quot;Kama Hele&quot; escorted the voyage.

Accompanied by the canoe &quot;Alingano Maisu&quot; and specialized escort boat &quot;Kama Hele&quot;, (&quot;photo below, in gallery)&quot; &quot;Hōkūlea&quot; sailed from Hawaii to the Federated States of Micronesia, 23 January to 7 April 2007. This voyage is known as &quot;Kū Holo Mau&quot;, or &quot;Sail On, Sail Always, Sail Forever.&quot; While on the island of Satawal, the crew of the &quot;Hōkūlea&quot; presented the &quot;Alingano Maisu&quot; to Mau Piailug. While at Satawal, some &quot;Hōkūlea&quot; navigators who had proven their mastery of non-instrument sailing and navigation over many ocean passages were inducted into &quot;Pwo&quot;, pronounced &quot;poh.&quot; This was the first &quot;Pwo&quot; ceremony on &quot;Satawal&quot; in five decades, and the first time Polynesians were inducted.

<doc id="753661" wikidata="Q7705195" url="?curid=753661" title="Terry v. Ohio">
<text>Terry v. Ohio, 392 U.S. 1 (1968), was a landmark U.S. Supreme Court decision in which the court ruled that it is constitutional for American police to &quot;stop and frisk&quot; a person they reasonably suspect to be armed and involved in a crime. Specifically, the decision held that a police officer does not violate the Fourth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution&#x27;s prohibition on unreasonable searches and seizures when questioning someone even though the officer lacks probable cause to arrest the person, so long as the police officer has a reasonable suspicion that the person has committed, is committing, or is about to commit a crime. The court also ruled that the police officer may perform a quick surface search of the person&#x27;s outer clothing for weapons if they have reasonable suspicion that the person stopped is &quot;armed and presently dangerous.&quot; This reasonable suspicion must be based on &quot;specific and articulable facts,&quot; and not merely upon an officer&#x27;s hunch.

This permitted police action has subsequently been referred to in short as a &quot;stop and frisk&quot;, &quot;stop, question, and frisk,&quot; or simply a &quot;Terry stop.&quot; The &quot;Terry&quot; standard was later extended to temporary detentions of persons in vehicles, known as traffic stops; see Terry stop for a summary of subsequent jurisprudence. The rationale behind the Supreme Court decision revolves around the notion that, as the opinion argues, &quot;the exclusionary rule has its limitations.&quot; According to the court, the meaning of the rule is to protect persons from unreasonable searches and seizures aimed at gathering evidence, not searches and seizures for other purposes (like prevention of crime or personal protection of police officers).

Legal scholars have criticized this ruling stating that &quot;the people&#x27;s constitutional right against the use of abusive police power&quot; has been sacrificed in favor of a &quot;police-purported need for a workable tool short of probable cause to use in temporary investigatory detentions.&quot; Critics also state that it has led to negative legislative outcomes and permitting instances of racial profiling.

==Background==
===Legal history===
&quot;Stop-and-frisk&quot; is a practice in which a police officer stops a person suspected of involvement in a crime, briefly searches the person&#x27;s clothing for weapons, and then questions the person, all without requiring the person&#x27;s consent and without enough grounds to execute a lawful arrest. All major American police forces routinely employed the stop-and-frisk practice. It was historically viewed as a &quot;low visibility&quot; police procedure and was &quot;largely ignored by commentators and dealt with ambiguously by most courts.&quot;

In the early 1960s, several major changes in American criminal law raised the issue&#x27;s importance. In its 1961 decision &quot;Mapp v. Ohio&quot;, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that the exclusionary rule—which prevents the government from using evidence in criminal prosecutions if it had been illegally obtained—applies to the U.S. states as well as to the federal government. In 1966, the Supreme Court ruled in &quot;Miranda v. Arizona&quot; that the Fifth Amendment requires courts to suppress confessions that law-enforcement personnel obtain without first providing certain specific legal warnings to an arrestee. Stop-and-frisk quickly became a popular topic for law-review articles. Several cases forced state supreme courts to address the practice more directly, such as the Supreme Court of California&#x27;s 1963 decision in &quot;People v. Mickelson&quot;.

===Case background===
On October 31, 1963, police officer Martin McFadden was on duty in downtown Cleveland, Ohio when he noticed two men standing on a street corner. McFadden watched one of the men, John W. Terry, walk down the street, look through a store window, then walk a short distance further before turning around and returning to where he had started, stopping to peer in the store window again on his way back. The other man, Richard Chilton, then repeated Terry&#x27;s movements. As McFadden watched, the pair repeated this routine many times. A third man then joined them and the three began walking down the street toward the store. McFadden suspected the men had been &quot;casing&quot; the store in preparation for robbing it, so he followed and confronted them. He asked their names, but they offered only noncommittal, mumbling answers. McFadden then grabbed Terry and Chilton and frisked them, discovering they both had pistols in their jacket pockets.

McFadden arrested Terry and Chilton for suspicion of carrying illegally concealed weapons. Both men were charged and tried in the Ohio Court of Common Pleas for Cuyahoga County. Terry&#x27;s lawyer filed a motion to suppress the evidence of the discovered pistol, arguing McFadden&#x27;s frisk had been a violation of Terry&#x27;s Fourth Amendment rights and that the pistol should be excluded from evidence under the exclusionary rule. The trial judge denied his motion on the basis that the stop-and-frisk was generally presumed legal, and Terry was convicted. He appealed to the Ohio District Court of Appeals, which affirmed his conviction, and then to the Supreme Court of Ohio, which dismissed his appeal. He then appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court, which agreed to hear his case and granted &quot;certiorari&quot;.

==Supreme Court decision==
On June 10, 1968, the U.S. Supreme Court issued an 8–1 decision against Terry that upheld the constitutionality of the &quot;stop-and-frisk&quot; procedure as long as the police officer has a &quot;reasonable suspicion&quot; that the person is about to commit a crime, has committed a crime or is in the process of committing a crime, and may be &quot;armed and presently dangerous.&quot;

===Opinion of the court===
Eight justices formed the majority and joined an opinion written by Chief Justice Earl Warren. The court began by accepting Terry&#x27;s arguments, which Ohio had disputed, that policeman McFadden&#x27;s stopping, questioning, and frisking of Terry and Chilton constituted actual searches and seizures under the Fourth Amendment. But the court ruled that the Fourth Amendment &quot;searches&quot; and &quot;seizures&quot; that occurred during a &quot;stop-and-frisk&quot; were not &quot;unreasonable&quot; under the Amendment&#x27;s first clause. Both the initial &quot;stop&quot; and the subsequent &quot;frisk&quot; were so &quot;limited&quot; and &quot;brief&quot; that a lesser justification sufficed, rather than requiring the police to have probable cause beforehand.

Reasoning that police officers&#x27; need to protect themselves outweighed the limited intrusions involved, the court ruled that officers could &quot;stop&quot; a person if they had &quot;reasonable suspicion&quot; that criminal activity was afoot, and could then &quot;frisk&quot; the person who was stopped if they had &quot;reasonable suspicion&quot; that the person was &quot;armed and presently dangerous.&quot; Neither intrusion required that police have the higher level of &quot;probable cause&quot; that would be needed to arrest or to conduct a full search. The court defined this new, lesser standard of &quot;reasonable suspicion&quot; as being less than &quot;probable cause&quot; but more than just a hunch, stating that &quot;the police officer must be able to point to specific and articulable facts which, taken together with rational inferences from those facts, reasonably warrant [the] intrusion.&quot;

The court held that this &quot;reasonable suspicion&quot; standard must apply to both the initial stop and the frisk. It said that a police officer must have reasonable suspicion to stop a suspect in the first place and that an officer could then frisk a stopped suspect if he or she had reasonable suspicion that the suspect was armed and dangerous, or if, in the officer&#x27;s experience, the suspected criminal activity was of a type that was &quot;likely&quot; to involve weapons. The sole purpose of the officer&#x27;s frisk could only be to ensure the suspect was not armed, and so had to be limited to a pat-down of the suspect&#x27;s outer clothing.

The court then applied these legal principles to McFadden&#x27;s actions with Terry and found that they comported with the &quot;reasonable suspicion&quot; standard. McFadden had years of experience as a policeman and was able to articulate the observations that led him to suspect that Terry and the other men were preparing to rob the store. Since McFadden reasonably suspected that the men were preparing for armed robbery, he reasonably suspected that Terry was armed, and so his frisk of Terry&#x27;s clothing was permissible and did not violate Terry&#x27;s Fourth Amendment rights. 

The court ended its opinion by framing the issue very narrowly, saying the question it was answering was &quot;whether it is always unreasonable for a policeman to seize a person and subject him to a limited search for weapons unless there is probable cause for an arrest.&quot; In answer to this limited question, the court said it was not. It ruled that when a policeman observes &quot;unusual conduct which leads him reasonably to conclude in light of his experience that criminal activity may be afoot and that the persons with whom he is dealing may be armed and presently dangerous,&quot; it is not a violation of the Fourth Amendment for the policeman to conduct a &quot;stop-and-frisk&quot; of the people whom he suspects.

=== Concurring opinion of Justice White ===
Justice Byron White joined the opinion of the court but suggested:

There is nothing in the Constitution which prevents a policeman from addressing questions to anyone on the streets. Absent special circumstances, the person approached may not be detained or frisked but may refuse to cooperate and go on his way. However, given the proper circumstances, such as those in this case, it seems to me the person may be briefly detained against his will while pertinent questions are directed to him. Of course, the person stopped is not obliged to answer, answers may not be compelled, and refusal to answer furnishes no basis for an arrest, although it may alert the officer to the need for continued observation.

With regard to the lack of obligation to respond when detained under circumstances of &quot;Terry&quot;, this opinion came to be regarded as persuasive authority in some jurisdictions, and the court cited these remarks in dicta in &quot;Berkemer v. McCarty&quot;, , at 439. However, in &quot;Hiibel v. Sixth Judicial District Court of Nevada&quot;, , the court held that neither of these remarks was controlling in a situation in which a state law required a detained person to identify himself. 

=== Dissenting opinion of Justice Douglas===
Justice William O. Douglas strongly disagreed with the permissibility of performing a stop-and-frisk action absent probable cause:

We hold today that the police have greater authority to make a &#x27;seizure&#x27; and conduct a &#x27;search&#x27; than a judge has to authorize such action. We have said precisely the opposite over and over again.

To give the police greater power than a magistrate is to take a long step down the totalitarian path. Perhaps such a step is desirable to cope with modern forms of lawlessness. But if it is taken, it should be the deliberate choice of the people through a constitutional amendment.

===Later criticism===

Lewis Katz criticized &quot;Terry&quot; in 1997 for inaccurately summarizing the facts of the case itself. He also criticized it for &quot;fail[ing] to strike a meaningful Fourth Amendment balance between effective law enforcement and individual freedom.&quot;

==Subsequent jurisprudence==
&quot;Terry&quot; set precedent for a wide assortment of Fourth Amendment cases. The cases range from street stop-and-frisks to traffic stops in which pat-down searches could be conducted on the driver or passengers. In &quot;Michigan v. Long&quot;, the Supreme Court ruled that car compartments could be constitutionally searched if an officer has reasonable suspicion that the suspect is armed and dangerous. The compartments are thus viewed as an extension of the suspect&#x27;s person. This is known as &quot;frisking the lunge area,&quot; as an officer may protect himself by searching any areas from which the suspect could grab a weapon.

The &quot;Terry&quot; doctrine was markedly extended in the 2004 case of &quot;Hiibel v. Sixth Judicial District Court of Nevada&quot;, , in which the Supreme Court held that a state law requiring the suspect to identify himself during a &quot;Terry&quot; stop did not necessarily violate the Fourth Amendment prohibitions of unreasonable searches and seizures or the Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination (although it potentially could violate the Fifth Amendment if the citizen reasonably believed that such identification could be used to incriminate him). The court did not legalize this process in all states but instead left the decision to the individual states. To date, 24 states have passed such laws.

The court most recently cited &quot;Terry v. Ohio&quot; in the 2009 case of &quot;Arizona v. Johnson&quot;, in which the court unanimously ruled to further expand &quot;Terry,&quot; granting police the ability to frisk an individual in a stopped vehicle if there is reasonable suspicion to believe the individual is armed and dangerous. This fulfills only the second prong of &quot;Terry&quot; (the first prong—reasonable suspicion that a crime has, is or will be committed—is fulfilled by the traffic violation that prompted the initial stop). According to &quot;Whren v. United States&quot;, any traffic violation, no matter how small, is a legitimate basis for a traffic stop.

In &quot;Heien v. North Carolina&quot;, an 8–1 decision in December 2014, the court expanded the &quot;reasonable suspicion&quot; factor of the &quot;Terry&quot; decision to cover a police officer&#x27;s reasonable mistake of law that gives rise to &quot;reasonable suspicion&quot; that justifies a traffic stop under the Fourth Amendment.

<doc id="753673" wikidata="Q1515840" url="?curid=753673" title="Smoothie King Center">
<text>Smoothie King Center (locally referred to as SKC) is a multi-purpose indoor arena in New Orleans, Louisiana. It is located in the Central Business District, adjacent to the Caesars Superdome. The arena opened in 1999 as New Orleans Arena and has been home to the New Orleans Pelicans of the National Basketball Association (NBA) since 2002. The New Orleans VooDoo of the Arena Football League played their home games in the arena from 2004 until the team disbanded in 2008. The VooDoo resumed play at the arena in March 2011, until after the 2015 AFL season when the franchise folded.

==Arena information==
The arena was completed in 1999 at a cost of $114 million and officially opened on October 19, 1999. The arena seats 17,805 for concerts, 16,867 for Pelicans games, 18,500 for college basketball and Pelicans playoff games, and 16,900 for ice hockey and arena football. It has 2,800 club seats and 56 luxury suites.

The arena as a concert venue can seat 7,500 for half-stage shows, 17,221 for end-stage shows and 17,805 for a center-stage shows. For trade shows and conventions the arena features of space. The ceiling is 65 feet (20 m) to beam and roof, 70 feet (21.5 m) to the top of the arena.

==History==

In 1999, the arena&#x27;s first tenant, the New Orleans Brass ice hockey team of the ECHL played their first home game in the arena. The team played in the arena their last three seasons. When the New Orleans Hornets arrived in 2002, they persuaded the state government to demand that the Brass foot the cost of converting the arena between basketball and hockey configurations. That expense was more than the Brass were willing to pay, and they were forced to fold due to the lack of another suitable arena.

The Hornets played their first game at the Smoothie King Center versus the Utah Jazz on October 30, 2002. The Jazz had called New Orleans home from 1974 to 1979.

The New Orleans VooDoo, of the Arena Football League (AFL), began playing their home games in the arena starting in February 2004.

Following Hurricane Katrina on August 29, 2005, medical operations that had previously been housed in the Superdome were moved to the Arena. Medical personnel had been working in an area of the Superdome with poor lighting, leaking ceilings and soggy carpet. The Arena&#x27;s design was tested in 1996 by CPP, a wind engineering consulting firm, so it fared far better than the Superdome during the storm and was in better condition to house sensitive medical operations. Thus, unlike the Superdome, the Arena reopened to activities only one month after the storm. On March 8, 2006, the Hornets played their first home game at the arena since Hurricane Katrina and the start of the 2005–06 season. A sellout crowd of 17,744 watched the Los Angeles Lakers defeat the Hornets, 113–107.

In 2006, the arena installed an LED centerhung video and scoring system from Daktronics. The centerhung installation is made up of two ring displays and eight video displays, as well as scoreboards. This installation is fully integrated with the more than of ribbon display technology that was installed in the arena in 2002. In the summer of 2008, new Daktronics &quot;see through&quot; shot clocks were installed, replacing the existing box units.

The New Orleans VooDoo of the Arena Football League resumed play at the arena in March 2011.

In 2013, the arena underwent a significant upgrade. The 2013 renovations were primarily focused for the gameday experience inside the arena. These upgrades include updates to the Suites and Club Levels, expanding the Club Levels, Creating new Loge Boxes, and a new Party Perch. Other upgrades include upgraded concession stands, upgraded LED boards, and other in-house amenities for the teams and performers that use the arena.

On February 5, 2014, it was announced that a 10-year agreement was reached to rename New Orleans Arena the Smoothie King Center prior to the 2014 NBA All-Star Game.

In September and October 2014, exterior renovations were made to the Smoothie King Center, including new entrances, painting the center from bluish green to light gray, and a new outer LED lighting system similar to the Mercedes-Benz Superdome&#x27;s own. However, some original plans, such as to add an overhang to the building, were cancelled.

The Hornets/Pelicans have enjoyed a winning record of 341–275 () during the regular season and 15–9 () during the playoffs in home games played at the New Orleans Arena/Smoothie King Center as of the conclusion of the 2018–19 season.

<text>Fresh Gear is a television program on ZDTV then known as TechTV (now known as G4) that showcases the latest in personal technology. It was hosted by Stephanie Siemiller and Chris Leary. The original hosts were Jim Louderback and Sumi Das.

Fresh Gear started to air on ZDTV after its launch in May 1998. The show aired every Wednesday at 9:30 pm. It was cancelled after the May 2004 merger of G4 and TechTV into G4techTV. G4techTV continued to make episodes until the closure of the San Francisco studios. &quot;Fresh Gear&quot; was then aired in reruns until early December 2004.

Though &quot;Fresh Gear&quot; is gone, G4techTV Canada has recreated the show as &quot;Gadgets &amp; Gizmos&quot;.

Product review segments were often co-hosted by the &#x27;Lab Rats&#x27;: Roger Chang, Hahn Choi , Andrew Hawn, Robert Heron, James Kim, Brett Larson and Martin Sargent. Another show that airs on another Comcast-owned channel (G4 Media&#x27;s parent company) known as Geared Up has a very similar format to Fresh Gear.

<doc id="753692" wikidata="Q942843" url="?curid=753692" title="Desmond Cory">
<text>Desmond Cory (16 February 1928 in Lancing, Sussex – 31 January 2001 in Marbella, Spain) was a pseudonym used by British mystery/thriller writer Shaun Lloyd McCarthy.

Desmond Cory wrote over 45 novels, including the creation of serial characters such as Johnny Fedora, a debonair British secret agent. Cory also wrote screenplays for Graham Greene novels (such as &quot;England Made Me&quot;) and had a number of his own novels appear on the big-screen and in TV thriller series.

Desmond Cory was arguably one of Britain&#x27;s most prolific thriller writers. His writing spans over 40 years, during which time he used up to three different pen names, such was the demand for his work. Academics cover his works in such books as &quot;British Mystery and Thriller Writers Since 1940&quot;, and &quot;Detecting Men: A Reader&#x27;s Guide and Checklist for Mystery Series Written By Men&quot;.

==Critical acclaim==
:&quot;Even though Johnny Fedora predates James Bond, comparisons with Ian Fleming&#x27;s better known hero are inevitable. Agent 007&#x27;s popularity is often attributed to the admission by President John F. Kennedy that &quot;From Russia With Love&quot; was one of his favourite novels. After that revelation in 1957, sales of the Fleming spy novel soared. Seven years later when [Cory&#x27;s] &quot;Hammerhead&quot; was republished in the United States as &quot;Shockwave&quot;, the book jacket carried a quote from Anthony Boucher of &quot;The New York Times&quot; saying that Johnny Fedora &quot;more than deserves to take over James Bond&#x27;s avid audience.&quot; Reviews of &quot;Feramontov&quot; and Ian Fleming&#x27;s &quot;Octopussy&quot; appeared side by side in &quot;The New York Times Book Review&quot; of 1966. Of &quot;Feramontov&quot; a reviewer said, &quot;As one has come to expect from Cory, colorful action, copious carnage, elaborate intrigue, frequent surprises.&quot; &quot;Octopussy&quot;, however, was dismissed as &quot;a thin and even emaciated volume.&quot; In reviewing &quot;Timelock&quot;, Boucher commented, &quot;I must say once more that I find Cory&#x27;s Johnny Fedora a much more persuasive violent, sexy and lucky agent than James Bond.&quot;
:—Prof. Marcia Songer – taken from her white-paper on the Evolution of Desmond Cory – 2003 &quot;There is these days a comparatively slender band of first-class writers who are producing thrillers worthy of serious attention – among them authors like Margaret Allingham, John Creasy, Carter Dickenson, David Dodge, Ellery Queen, Simenon, and, of course Agatha Christie. Among them, too, is Desmond Cory, a man whose ingenuity, imagination, and good humour pervade his works with an agreeable excitement and read-ability.&quot;
:—&quot;Bristol Evening Post&quot; 1960

:&quot;You hear that there was a Golden Age of thrillers in Britain between the wars. When you read Cory you realize that it hasn&#x27;t ended.&quot;
:—&quot;Echo&quot; – 1993

:&quot;Readers who like their thrillers to complement their intelligence must on no account miss Mr. Cory&quot;.
:—Edmund Crispin, &quot;The Sunday Times&quot; 1971

<text> (, &quot;protected Jew&quot;) was a status for German Jews granted by the imperial, princely or royal courts. 

Within the Holy Roman Empire, except some eastern territories gained by the Empire in the 11th and 12th centuries (e.g. Brandenburg), Jews usually had the status of Servi camerae regis. This status included imperial protection and the levying of special taxes on the Jews for the Empire&#x27;s treasury (Latin: camera regis). But the emperors, always short of money, alienated – by sale or pledge – their privilege to levy extra taxes on Jews, not all at once, but territory by territory to different creditors and purchasers. Thus Jews lost their – not always reliable – imperial protection. 

Many territories that gained supremacy over the Jews living within their boundaries subsequently expelled them. After the general expulsions of the Jews from a given territory often only single Jews – if any at all – would be granted the personal privilege to reside within the territory. This personal privilege, documented by a &quot;Schutzbrief&quot; (writ of protection), a &quot;Geleitsbrief&quot; (writ of escort), or (in Brandenburg) a &quot;Patent&quot;, was sometimes inheritable by only one son (in rare instances, by all sons), and was sometimes uninheritable. Jews holding such a privilege were thus called &quot;Schutzjuden&quot;, &quot;vergeleitete Juden&quot;, or &quot;Patentjuden&quot;, as opposed to Jews who had no right of residence, who were known as &quot;unvergeleitete Juden&quot;. The latter were not allowed to marry, and might spend their life unmarried as a member of the household of a privileged relative or employer. 

For example, in October 1763 King Frederick II of Brandenburg-Prussia granted Moses Mendelssohn, until then under protection by being employed by a &quot;Patentjude&quot;, a personal, uninheritable privilege, which assured his right to undisturbed residence in Berlin. His wife and children, who had no independent permission to reside, lost their status of family member of a &quot;Patentjude&quot; when Mendelssohn died in 1786. They were later granted multi-son inheritable &quot;Patents&quot;. In 1810 Stein&#x27;s Prussian reforms introduced a freely inheritable Prussian citizenship for all subjects of the king, doing away with the different prior legal status of the Estates, such as the Nobility, the burghers of the chartered cities, the unfree peasants, the officialdom at the court, the Patent Jews, and the Huguenots.

<doc id="753703" wikidata="Q1153539" url="?curid=753703" title="Xiamen University">
<text>Xiamen University (XMU; ) is a public university in Siming, Xiamen, Fujian, China. It is affiliated with the Ministry of Education of China. The university is part of Project 211, Project 985, and the Double First-Class Construction.

Founded in 1921 by Tan Kah Kee, a Chinese patriotic expatriate businessman in Singapore, the university has been perennially regarded as one of the top academic institutions in Southern China, with strengths in mathematics, chemistry, oceanography, economics, management, law, communication and political science.

 over 45,000 students are enrolled at Xiamen University, including more than 21,000 undergraduates, over 19,000 master&#x27;s students, and over 5,000 doctoral candidates.

Xiamen University is proactive in international exchanges and collaboration. It has forged partnerships with 263 universities abroad and engages in substantial exchanges with 53 institutions. In July 2014, the groundwork for the Xiamen University Malaysia campus was initiated, marking it as the first Chinese university to pioneer an independent campus overseas.

== History ==
=== Private period ===
In 1919, Tan Kah Kee, a Chinese expatriate in Singapore, businessman, investor, and philanthropist, donated then 4 million dollars to endow Amoy University in the city of Amoy (former romanization of &#x27;Xiamen&#x27; until 1970s). When the university was founded in 1921, there were no more than 20 faculty members and just 98 students.

At the 1926 Sesquicentennial International Exposition in Philadelphia, United States, Amoy University was one of five institutions selected to participate in an exhibit on education in China, representing the country&#x27;s higher education system.

=== National university period ===
In 1937, Tan transferred administration of the university to the Nationalist government, and the institution became a national university.


In 1938, at the outbreak of the Second Sino-Japanese War, the university was temporarily relocated to Changting in western Fujian to escape Japanese invasion of Chinese coastal regions.

In 1946, after the war, the university moved back to Xiamen and resumed normal operations.

In 1952, it was transformed into a comprehensive university embracing both arts and science.

In 1963, it was designated as a key university in China.

In 1995, Xiamen University was selected to participate in Project 211, a Chinese government initiative to provide increased financial resources for the country&#x27;s most promising universities.

In 2000, the university was selected for 985 Project, a national and local government initiative to provide funding for facilities construction and faculty hiring to bolster China&#x27;s top universities.

On January 25, 2013, the Ministry of Higher Education of Malaysia submitted an invitation letter to Xiamen University to establish a branch campus in Malaysia.

On July 3, 2014, the foundation of Xiamen University Malaysia Campus was laid near Kuala Lumpur.

On February 22, 2016, Malaysia Campus officially opened.

In September 2017, the university was recognized as a Class A institution in the Double First Class University Plan, a Chinese government initiative to cultivate a group of elite Chinese universities into &quot;world-class&quot; institutions by 2050.

== International cooperation ==
Xiamen University has maintained a global presence since its creation in 1921, attracting students from overseas Chinese communities in Southeast Asia. The institution established an &quot;Overseas Correspondence Courses&quot; program in 1956 and accepted its first foreign students in 1981. Xiamen University now has an extensive portfolio of international collaborations, including an International Cooperative Program for Innovative Talents funded by the China Scholarship Council, and global exchange and cooperation relationships with over 300 universities. It has established 16 Confucius Institutes with partner institutions in 13 countries.

In 2011, China government and Malaysian government began high-level discussions about creating a Malaysian branch of Xiamen University. Subsequently, in 2015 the Xiamen University Malaysia Campus was established. Known as &quot;XMU Malaysia,&quot; the institution has been described as &quot;historic&quot; and is notable as the &quot;first ever large-scale international branch&quot; of a Chinese university. Professor Wang Ruifang was named the first chancellor of XMU Malaysia.

On May 23, 2016, Xiamen University sent a delegation to the Tokyo Institute of Technology in Tokyo, Japan to meet with leadership and professors. The delegation&#x27;s objective was to discuss the institutions&#x27; strategies for commercializing research findings, fostering university-industry collaboration, and encouraging international students to learn about local language and culture.

On November 18, 2016, Xiamen University and Cardiff University in Wales, United Kingdom initiated a &quot;strategic partnership&quot; including a program for co-supervision of doctoral students, and £1.2 million in seed funding for &quot;collaborative research projects&quot; to benefit the economy of Wales. Subsequently, a delegation from Cardiff University visited the Xiamen University School of International Relations to explore possible areas of research collaboration and student exchange.

Xiamen University also hosts recurring China study programs for University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Council for Christian Colleges and Universities, Eckerd College and Bentley College in USA, and University College Utrecht in the Netherlands.

In cooperation with Mae Fah Luang University in Thailand, Xiamen University operates a Confucius Institute at Mae Fah Luang University&#x27;s Sirindhorn Chinese Language and Culture Center.

The campus now hosts the College of Creativity and Innovation, International College, Gulei Petrochemical Research Institute, Institute of Industrial Technology, and XMU Tan Kah Kee College. It aims to be a hub for international cooperation, applied talent cultivation, result transformation, and talent gathering. In addition, the college actively organizes students to innovate and start businesses.

=== Xiang&#x27;an campus ===
In September 2012, Xiamen University began operations at its Xiang&#x27;an Campus, located 34 kilometers from the main campus. The three stated goals of the new campus are to provide facilities for &quot;newly developing disciplines and applied subjects&quot; such as bioscience and energy, to establish &quot;innovation platforms for applied sciences,&quot; and to house the southern headquarters of the Confucius Institute.

Currently, the Xiang&#x27;an Campus hosts over 10,000 students and faculty from ten schools: the Overseas Education College (which serves international students), the Medical College, the School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, the School of Life Sciences, the School of Public Health, the Nursing Department, the College of Earth Sciences, the College of Environment and Ecology, the School of Energy Research, and the School of Aerospace Engineering.

=== Malaysia campus (XMUM) ===
Upon the invitation of the Malaysian Ministry of Higher Education to set up a branch campus in Malaysia, Xiamen University accepted the offer and thus, Xiamen University Malaysia (XMUM) was born in 2015.

In keeping with the vision of our founder Mr. Tan Kah Kee, XMU began in earnest to build our first offshore campus in Malaysia and became the pioneer university from China to establish a branch campus in Malaysia. XMUM aspires to become a university with a distinct global outlook, featuring first-class teaching and research, and embracing cultural diversity.

<text>David Mach (born 18 March 1956) is a Scottish sculptor and installation artist. His artistic style is based on flowing assemblages of mass-produced objects. Typically these include magazines, vicious teddy bears, newspapers, car tyres, match sticks and coat hangers. Many of his installations are temporary and constructed in public spaces.

==Early life==
Mach was born in 1956 in Methil, Fife. Mach studied at Duncan of Jordanstone College of Art and Design (now a school of University of Dundee), Dundee, Scotland from 1974, graduating in 1979, then at the Royal College of Art, London between 1979 and 1982. Following several shows and public installations, Mach was nominated for the Turner Prize in 1988. Mach was elected Member of the Royal Academy of Arts in 1998, and was appointed Professor of Sculpture in 2000.

==Work==

One example of his early magazine pieces, &quot;Adding Fuel to the Fire&quot;, was an installation assembled from an old truck and several cars surrounded and subsumed by about 100 tons of magazines, individually arranged to create the impression that the vehicles were being caught in an explosion of flames and billowing smoke.

An early influential sculpture was &quot;Polaris&quot; in 1983, exhibited outside the Royal Festival Hall, South Bank Centre, London. This consisted of some 6,000 car tyres arranged as a life size replica of a Polaris submarine. Mach intended it as a protest against the nuclear arms race meant to stir controversy. A member of the public, James Gore-Graham from West Kensington, who took exception to the piece tried to burn it down; unfortunately, he got caught in the flames himself and suffered 90% burns from the explosion and died three days later.

In the early 1980s Mach started to produce some smaller-scale works assembled out of unstruck match sticks. These mostly took the form of human or animalistic heads and masks, like &quot;Elvis&quot;, with the coloured tips of the match heads arranged to construct the patterned surface of the face. After accidentally setting fire to one of these heads, Mach now often ignites his match pieces as a form of performance art. He constructed &quot;Gorilla&quot; from coat-hangers.
In 1997, Mach produced some larger-scale permanent public works such as &quot;Out of Order&quot; in Kingston upon Thames, the &quot;Brick Train&quot; (a depiction of an LNER Class A4 4468 Mallard steam engine which held the speed record of 126mph in 1934), made from 185,000 bricks, which can be seen near Morrison&#x27;s supermarket on the A66 just outside Darlington. and the &quot;Big Heids&quot; visible from the M8 between Glasgow and Edinburgh.

A second strand to Mach&#x27;s work are his collage pieces. Partly as a result of having access to thousands of reproduced images in the magazines left over from many of his installations, Mach began to experiment with producing collages. In 1999, he produced a mixed-media postcard and photo-collage of Sir Richard Branson, measuring 1.824 x 1.826 metres. he did a &quot;National Portrait,&quot; of 3 x 70 metres collage for the Millennium Dome that featured many images of British people at work and at play.

In 2011, he joined forces with the Museum of Edinburgh, to produce an explosive display celebrating the 400th anniversary of the King James Bible.

==Awards and honours==
*1988 Mach was nominated for the Turner Prize at the Tate Gallery, London.
*1992 Winner of the Lord Provost&#x27;s Prize for Services to the Visual Arts in Glasgow.

<doc id="753713" wikidata="Q1123297" url="?curid=753713" title="State Farm Arena">
<text>State Farm Arena is a multi-purpose arena located in Atlanta, Georgia. The arena serves as the home venue for the Atlanta Hawks of the National Basketball Association (NBA). It also served as home to the Atlanta Thrashers of the National Hockey League (NHL) from 1999 to 2011, before the team moved to Winnipeg, as well as the Atlanta Dream of the Women&#x27;s National Basketball Association (WNBA) from 2008 to 2016 and 2019, and the temporary home of Georgia Tech basketball in 2011. It opened in 1999 as Philips Arena at a cost of $213.5 million, replacing Omni Coliseum. It is owned by the Atlanta Fulton County Recreation Authority and operated by the Hawks, owned by Tony Ressler along with a group of investors including Grant Hill.

==Layout==
The arena seats 19,050 for basketball and 17,624 for ice hockey. The largest crowd ever for an Atlanta Hawks basketball game at the arena was Game 6 of the 2008 Eastern Conference First Round on May 2, 2008 (against the Boston Celtics), where there was an announced attendance of 20,425. The arena includes 92 luxury suites, 9 party suites, and 1,866 club seats. For concerts and other entertainment events, the arena can seat 21,000.

The arena was originally laid out in a rather unusual manner, with the club seats and luxury boxes aligned solely along one side of the playing surface, and the general admission seating along the other three sides (the arrangement was later emulated in Ford Field, Addition Financial Arena, Soldier Field, Levi&#x27;s Stadium, and other venues). This layout was a vast contrast to many of its contemporaries, which have their revenue-generating luxury boxes and club seats located in the &#x27;belly&#x27; of the arena, thus causing the upper deck to be 2–4 stories higher. The layout at Philips was done so as to be able to bring the bulk of the seats closer to the playing surface while still making available a sufficient number of revenue-raising club seats and loges. Renovations in 2017–18 removed the upper levels of the suite wall in favor of premium seating spread throughout the arena, turning those upper areas to standard seating.

On the exterior, angled steel columns supporting the roof facing downtown spell out &quot;ATLANTA.&quot; The side facing the Georgia World Congress Center originally spelled out &quot;CNN&quot; (whose headquarters adjoins the arena), but that section has since been altered to accommodate a Taco Mac restaurant. The GWCC/CNN Center rail station below the arena provides access to MARTA public transportation.

Eindhoven, Netherlands-based technology company Philips purchased the initial naming rights to the arena in February 1999 for $185 million over 20 years. In February 2018, it was reported that Philips would not renew its naming rights agreement for the arena when it expired in June 2019, primarily due to Philips&#x27; withdrawal from the consumer electronics market in 2013. On August 29, 2018, State Farm purchased the naming rights to the arena, in a 20-year deal that cost $175 million.

For the 2007–2008 season, State Farm Arena utilized the new &quot;see-through&quot; shot clock units which allow spectators seated behind the basket to see the action without having the clocks interfere with their view, joining FedExForum, Wells Fargo Center, TD Garden, United Center, Footprint Center and the Spectrum Center. Video advertising panels replaced the traditional scrolling panels.

==History==

During the late 1980s and early 1990s, many cities started building new state-of-the-art sporting venues for their NBA and/or NHL franchises, or in hopes of attaining one. Many of these arenas had modern amenities for their high-end customers, such as luxury boxes, club seats, and large, posh club-level concourses; some even had practice facilities on-site. These attractions were rarely found in arenas constructed in the early 1970s, when the Omni Coliseum was built. However, it was likely that the Omni would have had to be replaced in any event due to a serious design flaw. It had been built using Cor-Ten weathering steel that was intended to seal itself, ensuring it would last for decades. However, the Omni&#x27;s designers didn&#x27;t account for Atlanta&#x27;s humid subtropical climate. Rather than form a seal, the Cor-Ten steel never stopped rusting, causing the arena to deteriorate faster than anticipated.

Ted Turner, owner of the Hawks at the time, wanted to bring the NHL back to Atlanta; the city&#x27;s first NHL team, the Atlanta Flames, had moved to Calgary in 1980. However, the NHL determined that the Omni was not suitable even as a temporary facility due to its structural problems and lack of amenities. The league told Turner that it would only grant an expansion team on condition that a new arena be in place for the prospective team&#x27;s inaugural season. After much consideration of possible other sites both in Downtown Atlanta and in the suburbs, it was decided that the Omni would be demolished in 1997, and a new arena would be built in the same location; the Omni was demolished on July 26, 1997. The Hawks split their games between the Georgia Dome and Alexander Memorial Coliseum for the next two seasons while Philips Arena was under construction.

Philips Arena held its first event with a September 1999 concert by musician Elton John. The Omni&#x27;s &quot;center-hung scoreboard&quot; now hangs in the lobby of Philips Arena, where it still displays the Omni&#x27;s logo along with those of Philips Arena, the Hawks, and the Thrashers (who never played in The Omni). The scoreboard still functions and displays information relevant to the game taking place in the arena. On April 2, 2009, Philips Arena achieved LEED for Existing Building: Operations and Maintenance certification as specified by the United States Green Building Council (USGBC). It was the world&#x27;s first LEED certified NBA/NHL arena. It has been nicknamed the &quot;Highlight Factory&quot;, due to the number of exciting plays, or highlights, that occur and Philips&#x27; history with lights and electronics.

On March 14, 2008, an EF2 Tornado struck near the Arena as part of a tornado outbreak that hit the city. The arena only received minor exterior damage. Since the 2010s, several statues have been erected near the arena in honor of notable Atlantan athletes, including a statue of Dominique Wilkins and a statue of Evander Holyfield.

==Events==

The arena hosted the NBA All-Star Game in 2003 and 2021 and the Atlantic Coast Conference men&#x27;s basketball tournament in 2012. It also hosted the NHL All-Star Game in 2008.

The first playoff game in any professional league played in Philips Arena was in 2005, when the Georgia Force of the Arena Football League hosted, and won, its first home playoff game. The first NHL playoff game in Philips Arena was in 2007, the Thrashers&#x27; only appearance in the Stanley Cup Playoffs. The first NBA playoff game in Philips Arena was in 2008, when the Hawks made the 2008 NBA Playoffs after an eight-season drought of missing the playoffs. On April 10, 2011, the Thrashers lost to the Pittsburgh Penguins, 5–2, in their final game. Tim Stapleton scored the final goal for the Thrashers in team history.

The venue had been named the site of the 2005 Southeastern Conference Women&#x27;s Basketball Tournament; however, when the NHL announced in early 2004 that the 55th NHL All-Star Game, scheduled for February 2005 would be held in Atlanta, arena officials withdrew the Southeastern Conference women&#x27;s basketball tournament – which was then moved 140 miles to the northeast along Interstate 85 to the BI-LO Center in Greenville, South Carolina. Oddly, the arena would not even be the host of that planned All-Star Game due to the 2004–05 NHL lockout. As a result, Atlanta became the second (San Jose being the first) city to lose a planned All-Star Game because of a labor dispute. Philips Arena would later be announced as home to the 56th NHL All-Star Game in 2008. Also, Philips Arena hosted game three of the 2010 WNBA Finals, where the Seattle Storm defeated the Atlanta Dream.

In 2013, Philips Arena hosted the finals of the men&#x27;s NCAA Division II and Division III college basketball championships. The events were held as an undercard to the 2013 NCAA Final Four held at the Georgia Dome, in celebration of the 75th edition of the NCAA Men&#x27;s Division I Basketball Championship.

===MMA and wrestling===
The arena hosted UFC 88, UFC 145, UFC 201, and UFC 236 in 2008, 2012, 2016 and 2019 respectively. Philips Arena also hosted the 2011 WWE Hall of Fame induction ceremony, the night before WrestleMania XXVII which was held at the Georgia Dome. Philips Arena also hosted the Royal Rumble in 2002 and 2010, Backlash in 2007, Hell in a Cell in 2012, Survivor Series in 2015, and Day 1 in 2022. An edition of &quot;WCW Monday Nitro&quot; was also held when the arena was known as Philips Arena on June 5, 2000. The arena hosted the February 19, 2020 episode of &quot;AEW Dynamite&quot; featuring All Elite Wrestling&#x27;s first-ever Steel cage match.
The venue also hosted WWE Bad Blood 2024 on October 5, 2024.

===Concerts===
State Farm Arena is among the busiest arenas for concerts in the world, having sold well over 550,000 concert tickets in 2007 and ranked as the third-busiest arena in the U.S. in 2011. State Farm has hosted such concerts as Elton John, The Who, and The Weeknd.

===Other events===
The arena hosted the 2004 US Figure Skating Championships.

Every few years, in early January, the State Farm Arena hosts one of the largest Christian college aged conferences: Passion Conference, when Mercedes-Benz Stadium is unavailable; the Passion 2025 Conference will be held at the State Farm Arena. The conference typically takes place over the first weekend in the new year and features big names in the Christian world such as Louie Gigilio, Chris Tomlin, Matt Redman, Kristian Stanfill, John Piper, rap artist Lecrae and many more. The conference is typically sold out.

The arena served as the venue for the semifinals of the 2022 League of Legends World Championship. The semifinals saw South Korean teams T1 and DRX progress to the finals, held at the Chase Center in San Francisco. DRX would eventually win the finals and become the 2022 League of Legends World Champions.

The arena hosted Hot Wheels Monster Trucks Live in 2024 and hosted it again in 2025 

==Renovations==

Shortly after acquiring the Hawks and the operating rights to Philips Arena on June 24, 2015, Tony Ressler announced his intentions of remodeling the arena to keep the Hawks in Downtown Atlanta at a cost between $150 million and $250 million. The proposed renovation would rebuild the entire seating bowl to optimize its sightlines for basketball and remove the wall of suites which dominate one side of the arena and replace them with a more traditional suite configuration. The Hawks are also in discussions with the city about building a mixed-use entertainment district similar to L.A. Live around Philips Arena, to better connect it to other nearby attractions such as Centennial Olympic Park and Mercedes-Benz Stadium. On November 1, 2016, the Hawks and the city of Atlanta reached a financing agreement on renovating Philips Arena, with the city contributing $142.5 million and the Hawks $50 million plus cost overruns to the project. With the renovation, the Hawks signed a lease extension lasting through June 30, 2046, with an early termination penalty of $200 million plus the remaining balance of the arena&#x27;s bonds.

The first phase of renovations, completed during the Hawks&#x27; 2017 off-season, removed the upper levels of the suite wall, reducing the total number of suites from 90 to 40, and added the Courtside Club behind one of the baskets. Renovations for 2018 were described by Hawks chief operating officer Thad Sheely as a &quot;gut rehab&quot;. The arena renovations brought new premium seating areas, connected 360-degree concourses, a new center-hung videoboard three times larger than its predecessor as well as additional videoboards in the corners of the upper decks, new dining options including a bar and grill operated by country group Zac Brown Band and other unique features including an in-arena barber shop operated by Atlanta rapper Killer Mike and Topgolf suites. Over of former office and storage space within the arena was repurposed as &quot;fan space&quot;. The first ticketed event at the renovated State Farm Arena was So So Def&#x27;s 25th anniversary concert on October 21, 2018, while the Hawks&#x27; first regular season home game took place on October 24 against the Dallas Mavericks.

Due to the renovations conflicting with the WNBA schedule, the Dream announced that they would move their 2017 and 2018 home schedules to McCamish Pavilion on the campus of Georgia Tech, mirroring the Hawks&#x27; move to the same venue (then known as Alexander Memorial Coliseum) between the time the Omni was razed and State Farm Arena was built. With the release of the 2019 WNBA schedule on December 18, 2018, the Dream confirmed that they would be returning to State Farm Arena. However, following the conclusion of the 2019 WNBA regular season, team officials indicated that the Dream would not be returning to State Farm Arena for the next season (which would be in 2021 due to the 2020 WNBA season being played in a COVID-19 bubble), citing disagreements with the Hawks&#x27; management. On October 18, 2019, the Dream announced that they would move to the Gateway Center Arena in suburban College Park, sharing the venue with the Hawks&#x27; NBA G League affiliate, the College Park Skyhawks. On June 21, 2024, the Dream returned to State Farm Arena for the first time since 2019 when it hosted the Indiana Fever and its highly touted rookie Caitlin Clark. The game was originally slated for Gateway Center Arena, but high demand for tickets and Clark&#x27;s immense popularity led to the Dream relocating to State Farm Arena for this contest.

<text>Sir John Robert Vane (29 March 1927 – 19 November 2004) was a British pharmacologist who was instrumental in the understanding of how aspirin produces pain-relief and anti-inflammatory effects and his work led to new treatments for heart and blood vessel disease and introduction of ACE inhibitors. He was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1982 along with Sune Bergström and Bengt Samuelsson for &quot;their discoveries concerning prostaglandins and related biologically active substances&quot;.

==Education and early life==
Born in Tardebigge, Worcestershire, John Vane was one of three children and grew up in suburban Birmingham. His father, Maurice Vane, was the son of Jewish Russian immigrants and his mother, Frances Vane, came from a Worcestershire farming family. He attended a local state school from age 5, before moving on to King Edward&#x27;s School in Edgbaston, Birmingham. An early interest in chemistry was to prove the inspiration for studying the subject at the University of Birmingham in 1944.

During his undergraduate studies, Vane became disenchanted with chemistry but still enjoyed experimentation. When Maurice Stacey, the Professor of Chemistry at Birmingham, was asked by Harold Burn to recommend a student to go to Oxford and study pharmacology, Vane jumped at the chance and moved to Burn&#x27;s department in 1946. Under Burn&#x27;s guidance, Vane found motivation and enthusiasm for pharmacology, writing: &quot;[the] laboratory gradually became the most active and important centre for pharmacological research in the U.K. and the main school for training of young pharmacologists.&quot; Vane completed a Bachelor of Science degree in pharmacology and briefly went to work at the University of Sheffield, before coming back to Oxford to complete his Doctor of Philosophy degree in 1953 supervised by Geoffrey Dawes.

==Career and research==
After completing his DPhil, Vane worked as an assistant professor the Department of Pharmacology at Yale University before moving back to the United Kingdom to take up a post as a senior lecturer in the Institute of Basic Medical Sciences at the University of London in 1955.

===University of London===

Vane held a post at the University of London for 18 years, progressing from senior lecturer to Professor of Experimental Pharmacology in 1966 (at the Royal College of Surgeons). During that time he developed certain bioassay techniques and focussed his research on both angiotensin-converting enzyme and the actions of aspirin, eventually leading to the publication with Priscilla Piper of the relationship between aspirin and the prostaglandins that earned him the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1982.

===Wellcome Foundation===
In 1973, Vane left his academic post at the Royal College of Surgeons and took up the position as Director of Research at the Wellcome Foundation, taking a number of his colleagues with him who went on to form the Prostaglandin Research department. Under the leadership of Salvador Moncada, this group continued important research that eventually led to the discovery of prostacyclin.

===Return to academia===
In 1985, Vane returned to academic life and founded the William Harvey Research Institute at the Medical College of St Bartholomew&#x27;s Hospital (now Barts and The London School of Medicine and Dentistry. At the William Harvey Research Institute, Vane&#x27;s work focused on selective inhibitors of COX-2, and the interplay between nitric oxide and endothelin in the regulation of vascular function.

==Awards and honours==
Vane was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society (FRS) in 1974. He was also awarded honorary doctorate degrees from Jagiellonian University Medical College (formerly Copernicus Academy of Medicine) in 1977, Paris Descartes University in 1978, Mount Sinai School of Medicine in 1980, the University of Aberdeen in 1983 and Fu Jen Catholic University in 2011. He was awarded the Lasker Award in 1977 for the discovery of prostacyclin and was knighted in 1984 for his contributions to science. In 2000, Vane received the Golden Plate Award of the American Academy of Achievement.

==Personal life==
John Vane married, in 1948, (Elizabeth) Daphne Page and had 2 daughters. He died on 19 November 2004 in Princess Royal University Hospital, Kent, from long-term complications arising from leg and hip fractures he sustained in May of that year. Lady Vane died in 2021.

<text>Jim Chee is one of two Navajo Tribal Police detectives in a series of mystery novels by Tony Hillerman. Unlike his superior Joe Leaphorn, the &quot;Legendary Lieutenant&quot;, Chee is a staunch believer in traditional Navajo culture; indeed, he is studying to be a traditional healer at the same time that he is a police officer.

== Profile ==

===Personal life===

Jim Chee is an acting sergeant in the Navajo Tribal Police when he first appears in &quot;People of Darkness&quot;, working in the Crownpoint, New Mexico, office. He has two older sisters. His mother and his mother&#x27;s brother (his little father) and her two sisters (his little mothers) are still alive and also part of his life. His uncle, Hosteen Frank Sam Nakai, is frequently helpful to Chee, whose advice runs through Chee&#x27;s mind, and whose tapes of the words for various Navajo rituals aid Chee in memorizing them. From childhood on, Chee is remarked for his excellent memory, detailed and exact.

Chee&#x27;s education is similar to that of Lt. Leaphorn, as he studied anthropology at the University of New Mexico and attended a boarding high school, described in &quot;People of Darkness&quot;. In &quot;Coyote Waits&quot;, Chee mentions that he took about seven years to graduate from college, as he had to skip a term to earn tuition money. Both came from families or clans with many singers, or &quot;yataalii&quot;. Chee&#x27;s Navajo name, given him by his maternal uncle, is Long Thinker. When Chee first appears in the novels, he is younger than the age Lt. Leaphorn appeared, and still a single man.

===Police work===
Chee and Leaphorn first meet and work together in &quot;Skinwalkers&quot;, when an attempt was made on Chee&#x27;s life as he slept. Chee knows the reputation Leaphorn has for his success in police work, and after Leaphorn retires, Chee thinks of Leaphorn as legendary and always smarter than Chee is. Chee is willing to call on Leaphorn whenever he is stuck with a particular problem in a case.
==Development of the character==
Hillerman writes in his autobiography, &quot;Seldom Disappointed&quot; (2001), that he created Jim Chee as an alternative to Leaphorn for the novel &quot;People of Darkness&quot; (1980), because the novel is set on the Checkerboard Reservation, and Hillerman felt that Leaphorn was too hardened to fit into the plot. He needed someone more naive, and Chee fit the bill.

==Appearances in other media==
In the 1991 theatrical film adaptation of &quot;The Dark Wind&quot;, Chee was played by Lou Diamond Phillips.

Three of the Hillerman novels (&quot;Skinwalkers&quot;, &quot;Coyote Waits&quot;, and &quot;A Thief of Time&quot;) were adapted for television as part of the PBS series &quot;Mystery!&quot;, as part of its &quot;American Mystery!&quot; specials. In these adaptations, Chee was played by actor Adam Beach. &quot;Skinwalkers&quot; first aired November 24, 2002; &quot;A Thief of Time&quot; first aired July 11, 2004, and &quot;Coyote Waits&quot; first aired November 16, 2003.

Kiowa Gordon portrays Chee in the AMC TV series &quot;Dark Winds&quot;.

Robert Redford purchased the film rights to the characters in 1988, and served as the executive producer for all of the film and television adaptations.

<doc id="753723" wikidata="Q481794" url="?curid=753723" title="Amway Arena">
<text>Amway Arena (originally known as Orlando Arena and later TD Waterhouse Centre) was an indoor arena located in Orlando, Florida. It was part of the Orlando Centroplex, a sports and entertainment complex located in Downtown Orlando. The arena was the former home of the Orlando Magic of the NBA and the Orlando Titans of the NLL. It was also the home of the Orlando Solar Bears of the International Hockey League, and the Orlando Predators of the Arena Football League. It also hosted many other minor league sports teams, as well as various concerts and other events such as the PlayStation Pro event on the Dew Action Sports Tour and the Ringling Brothers and Barnum and Bailey Circus annually.

Amway Arena closed in 2010 and was demolished in 2012.

==History==

The city of Orlando wanted a downtown arena long before there was talk of an NBA franchise. The arena site on West Livingston Street was approved in December 1983, at a time when concerts and other large-scale events were held at the Orange County Convention Center, which is several miles away from downtown. Discussions on financing delayed the project for several years due to concerns of the convention center losing money if an arena was built, as an arena would be a better venue for many of the events previously held at the convention center. By the end of 1985, the city and county reached an agreement on a financing plan that would delay the opening of the arena until the end of the decade (unless the county agreed) so it would not compete with the convention center. The planned site grew 50% from its original plan and consumed three extra blocks south of Lake Dot.

In 1986, support was growing to attempt to bring an NBA franchise to Orlando, and general manager Pat Williams knew that having an arena already under construction would be critical for expansion being approved by the league. Considering the importance of the arena, the city voted to allow construction to begin before a study of its impact on the area was filed with state and regional planners. Ground broke in January 1987, four months before the NBA Board of Governors made their final decision to bring Orlando into the league.

Construction was completed in 1989 at a cost of $110 million ($2,099,903.23 as of 2020) – entirely publicly financed. The arena officially opened on January 29, 1989, with a ribbon cutting ceremony and public open house featuring the Orlando Magic Dancers and Curly Neal. In 1991, the facility was voted &quot;Arena of the Year&quot; by Performance Magazine. It was also nominated for &quot;Best Indoor Concert Venue&quot; in the Pollstar Concert Industry Awards. The arena&#x27;s design provided for an intimate atmosphere. Spectators in the upper bowl were still relatively close to the floor due to the number of seats in the lower and upper bowls being split almost 50/50, with the luxury suites near the ceiling. The arena originally seated 15,291 but all the original seats were replaced with narrower ones between 1994 and 1995, increasing capacity by over 2,000 to 17,519.

===Naming===

During its entire lifetime, the arena was colloquially known by the nickname of &quot;The O-Rena&quot;. It was officially named Orlando Arena, then TD Waterhouse Centre, and finally Amway Arena.

After considering several names, including Frederick Arena (suggested by Magic general manager Pat Williams), MagicDome, Quest, Apex and Centrum, then-Orlando Mayor Bill Frederick decided to name the building Orlando Arena in 1988. It was the city&#x27;s first choice.

The city agreed to allow the Magic to sell the naming rights of the arena in November 1998. It was part of a five-year extension of the team&#x27;s lease on the building. The search for a corporate sponsor began immediately, and speculation began that Amway would be chosen due to the fact that Magic owner Rich DeVos co-founded it. However, in 1999, TD Waterhouse, a division of Canadian finance company Toronto Dominion, purchased the naming rights at a cost of $7.8 million for five years. The building was then renamed to TD Waterhouse Centre.

The naming rights with TD Waterhouse expired on November 30, 2006, and the financial company which bought TD Waterhouse&#x27;s U.S. operations earlier in the year chose not to renew them. The venue was briefly known as &quot;The arena in Orlando&quot; before a new naming rights contract was signed, a period of approximately one week. On December 7, 2006, it was announced that Amway would become the new sponsor at a cost of $1.5 million over 4 years, or $375,000 a year, renaming the building as Amway Arena. As part of the deal, Amway received an initial exclusive option to negotiate for the right to name Orlando&#x27;s new arena, which had just been announced. The new arena would go on to be named Amway Center.

===Former tenants===
Defunct tenants of the arena include the IHL&#x27;s Orlando Solar Bears, the SPHL&#x27;s Orlando Seals, RHI&#x27;s Orlando Jackals, MISL&#x27;s Orlando Sharks, the WNBA&#x27;s Orlando Miracle, and the NLL&#x27;s Orlando Titans.

The Solar Bears folded in 2001 along with the IHL itself. After the 2002 WNBA season, all franchises were sold to the operators of the teams, and Magic owner Rich DeVos was not interested in keeping them. They relocated to Connecticut and were renamed the Sun. On August 22, 2004, the City of Orlando evicted the Seals and they were forced to sit out the first season of Southern Professional Hockey League play for 2004–05 as a result. They ultimately moved to Kissimmee&#x27;s Silver Spurs Arena and resumed play in 2005–2006 as the Florida Seals until they folded. In 2007, the Orlando Sharks, an expansion team in the Major Indoor Soccer League, were to play in the arena beginning that fall, but rent issues with the arena led them to eventually fold. The Orlando Titans played their first and only season at the arena before folding due to financial troubles.

==Renovation plans==
Attendance to Magic NBA games was strong, with a waiting list of 3,700 names on the season ticket list in 1996, even after a 1994 renovation made the seats narrower. However, experts stated that the arena was outdated since the day its doors first opened. Although it was built to NBA specifications at the time, construction began right before mid level luxury seating and lower-level club seating became the &quot;de facto&quot; standard, and the arena lacked both of these lucrative features. Also, the placement of the skyboxes gave them the worst sightlines in the arena, consequently &quot;Fortune&quot; 500 companies in the vicinity such as SunTrust, Lockheed Martin, Darden Restaurants, and Hughes Supply did not lease the luxury suites.

The Orlando Magic&#x27;s desire for a major renovation of the building dated to 1994, when the arena was only five years old, as the team was seeking to increase revenue by expanding the limited retail and concession space and luxury seating. In 1996, the team spent $100,000 to have Conventions Sports &amp; Leisure of Minneapolis study and determine renovation ideas. Major renovation seemed unfeasible in 1997, when the task-force determined that the cost of implementing everything that the team wanted would reach up to $75 million. However, even if luxury suites were relocated to the midlevel, the city had few corporations in the area willing to pay the $100,000-plus a year lease rates. The revenues brought in by the changes likely would not be enough to cover mortgage payments on money that would have to be borrowed to pay for the renovation. Also, at the time, the city still owed $40 million on the original construction of the building.

Beginning around 2000, the Magic began to push the City of Orlando for a brand new arena, replacing the TD Waterhouse Centre. Since the city, as well as Orange County, were not keen on picking up the tab for a second facility in a little over a decade, the Magic stated they would contribute to the cost of building it. They did not, however, say how much. They also indicated they expected public dollars to be used, too. Discussions became contentious in 2001, as the team threatened to look elsewhere if Orlando would not build a new arena, or contribute a significant amount to a renovation. At the time, the team was losing $8 million annually. Magic President Bob Vander Weide stated, &quot;If we can&#x27;t break even in the long term and we can&#x27;t stay competitive, maybe this isn&#x27;t the best place for us.&quot; The Magic outlined where an arena should be built, the potential cost, what type of tax should pay for it and what could be done with the existing building once it was abandoned by the team. In a meeting with county and city officials, team owner DeVos said he was seeking $200 million in public money, including $121.5 million from the tourist tax collected by the county, $50 million from the city of Orlando and $28.5 million from the state. Officials were staunchly opposed. Any plans for renovation or replacement relied on tourist-tax revenue, and after the terrorist attacks of 9/11, the numbers of tourists in the area declined sharply. Then-Orlando Mayor Glenda Hood and Orange County Mayor Rich Crotty were close to a deal for a major renovation, but talks were broken off for several years due to the sagging tourist tax dollars. At the grand opening of the Amway Center on October 1, 2010, Crotty remarked &quot;When I look around this building, I think to myself, &#x27;Boy, am I glad that didn&#x27;t work.&#x27; Sometimes good comes out of bad.&quot;

==Successor arena and demolition==
On September 29, 2006, the City of Orlando and Orange County finally came to an agreement on a $1.1-billion improvement package that included $480 million for a new arena. The Magic would provide $114 million in cash and up-front lease payments and guarantee $100 million in bonds toward the arena. The venue plan received final approval on July 26, 2007, and the arena was completed in time for the 2010–11 NBA season. Amway Arena&#x27;s last day of operation was September 30, 2010, as arena operations then moved to the new Amway Center.

The City of Orlando began demolition of Amway Arena&#x27;s interior on December 15, 2011, originally planning to take about six months to traditionally demolish the facility. The majority of the building was instead imploded at 7:30 a.m. on March 25, 2012, leaving only the corner columns standing, which would be removed along with the rest of the rubble over the following months. One man was injured after being hit by debris.

Currently, plans call for the remainder of the Centroplex to also be demolished to make way for a &quot;Creative Village&quot; complex on the site. It will be home to digital media companies and related industries. There will be 35% office space, 45% residential space, and 20% for other uses including education, hotels, retail, and entertainment. The goal of the complex is to redevelop the site into &quot;a place where high-tech companies locate; and employees of those businesses and other residents live, work, learn and play&quot;.

==Notable events==
===Sports===

Notable basketball events include the 1990 SEC men&#x27;s basketball tournament, as well as early rounds of the NCAA Tournament in 1993, 1996, 1999, and 2004. The 42nd annual NBA All-Star Game was held at the facility on February 9, 1992. Games 1 and 2 of the 1995 NBA Finals between the Magic and the Houston Rockets were held at the arena, as well as Games 3, 4, and 5 of the 2009 NBA Finals between the Magic and the Los Angeles Lakers. The final NBA game at Amway Arena was Game 5 of the Eastern Conference Finals against the Boston Celtics on May 26, 2010; the Magic won that game. The Celtics would then win Game 6 in Boston, advancing to face the Lakers in the 2010 NBA Finals.

Other sporting events include the 1992 United States Figure Skating Championships and the IHL Finals in 1996, 1999 and 2001, when the Orlando Solar Bears won the Turner Cup in the IHL&#x27;s last season of operations. During the 1993–94 NHL season, the Tampa Bay Lightning played five of their home games at the arena. In 2004, Orlando was selected as one of five cities to host the Dew Tour, an extreme sports franchise started in 2005. It was the site of the PlayStation Pro, the final event each season on the tour. Three ArenaBowl games were held at the facility. The Orlando Predators lost to the Detroit Drive in 1992 and Arizona Rattlers in 1994 before defeating the Nashville Kats in 2000. The final sporting event at Amway Arena was an Orlando Predators game on July 24, 2010, against the Oklahoma City Yard Dawgz.

===Political events===

On October 20, 2008, Democratic Presidential Candidate Barack Obama held a major outdoor rally immediately outside the Amway Arena north entrance that drew over 50,000 supporters and was televised nationally. Additional speakers at the rally included U.S. Senators Hillary Clinton and Bill Nelson, and Orlando Mayor Buddy Dyer. The major rally drew national attention to Florida as an election battle-ground state and was covered live on national evening newscasts on all major networks. A similar rally was held in 2004 by Democratic Presidential Candidate John Kerry inside the Amway Arena.

===Other Events===

R.E.M performed here on 4/30/1989. Songs from this and the previous night&#x27;s concert at Miami Arena were broadcast on Westwood One&#x27;s Superstars In Concert radio show.

Many professional wrestling pay-per-view events have been held at Amway Arena over the years, including the 1990 WWF Royal Rumble, 1994 WCW Bash at the Beach, and WWE Armageddon 2003. On March 29, 2008, the WWE held their Hall of Fame induction at the arena in conjunction with WrestleMania XXIV, which was held at the Florida Citrus Bowl.

Many Orange and Seminole County public high schools held their graduation ceremonies at the arena.

The final event at Amway Arena was the So You Think You Can Dance Tour on September 30, 2010.

<text>Johnny Fedora is a fictional British secret agent who was the protagonist of 16 novels published between 1951 and 1971. Written by Shaun Lloyd McCarthy, under the pseudonym of Desmond Cory, Fedora was dubbed by literary critics as the &#x27;thinking man&#x27;s James Bond&#x27;. Preceding Bond, Fedora was also a hired assassin (&quot;hired to kill&quot;), but for many the Fedora plots were more complex and intellectual. The son of a Spanish father and Irish mother, Fedora was driven as much by a need to avenge the death of his parents (at the hands of Spanish fascists) as by patriotism or loyalty to British Intelligence. He got his start working behind the lines during WWII, assassinating Nazis. The debonair Fedora was always a tough and competent agent, and his first adventures were written in a more light-hearted manner than the latter ones. Like Bond, he had passionate affairs with a wide variety of women around the world (though never as a ruse to gain intelligence), but his relationships tended to be more nuanced, and sometimes spanned several novels. The final books in the series featured his nemesis, Feramontov, a deadly and highly skilled Russian agent, whose ruthlessness went as far as trying to detonate a nuclear bomb in Spain. 1960&#x27;s &quot;The Head&quot;, atypical of the series as a whole, featured Johnny, temporarily without any mission from his handlers, getting involved in a publicity stunt for a film that involved carting a massive statue of Jesus to the top of a high Spanish mountain.

<doc id="753740" wikidata="Q321280" url="?curid=753740" title="Dick Vitale">
<text>Richard &quot;Dick&quot; John Vitale (; born June 9, 1939), also known as &quot;Dickie V&quot;, is an American basketball sportscaster. A former head coach in the college and professional ranks, he is well known for his 41-year tenure as a college basketball broadcaster for ESPN. He is known for catchphrases such as &quot;This is awesome, baby!&quot; and &quot;diaper dandy&quot; (outstanding freshman player), as well as his enthusiastic and colorful remarks during games. He has also written fourteen books and appeared in several films.

==Early life==
Vitale was born in Passaic, New Jersey, and grew up in Garfield, New Jersey. He moved to East Paterson (now Elmwood Park) His father, John, was a piecework clothing press operator and had a second job as a security guard. His mother, Mae, worked in a factory as a seamstress and sewed coats until she suffered a stroke.

== Education ==
Vitale graduated from East Rutherford High School in 1958. He attended Seton Hall University and graduated with a degree in business administration in 1962. As the first in his family to attend college, he is a first-generation college student. He later earned a master&#x27;s degree in education from William Paterson University, formerly known as Paterson State College.

==Coaching==

===High school coaching===
Vitale took his first job as a coach at an elementary school in Garfield, New Jersey in 1958. Eventually he moved up to the high school level to become head coach at Garfield High School for one season, and then at East Rutherford High School (his alma mater), where he had a record of 131–47 from 1964 to 1971 and led his teams to two New Jersey state championships.

===College coaching===
In 1971, Vitale moved to Rutgers University as an assistant coach under head coach Dick Lloyd. He was named head coach at the University of Detroit (now Detroit Mercy) on March 31, 1973. He took the Titans to the 32-team NCAA tournament in 1977. Vitale had a 78–30 record during his tenure at Detroit, which included a 21-game winning streak during the 1977 season. During that streak the Titans defeated the eventual champion Marquette, on the road, in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. Following the 1977 season, his fourth as Detroit head coach, Vitale was named the university&#x27;s athletic director.

===NBA coaching===
Vitale left the Titans to become head coach of the Detroit Pistons on May 1, 1978, succeeding Bob Kauffman who had served as an interim following the dismissal of Herb Brown months prior on December 15, 1977. He signed a 3‐year contract with a $100,000 annual salary and a new Cadillac. The Pistons finished with a 30–52 (.366) record in 1978–79. Vitale was hospitalized with stress related stomach issues during his first season on the bench in Detroit as the team struggled. In his second year, on November 8, 1979, Pistons owner Bill Davidson came to Vitale&#x27;s house and told him that the Pistons were making a coaching change. It was twelve games into the 1979–80 Detroit Pistons season, and with the Pistons off to a 4–8 start, Vitale was fired on November 8, 1979, with assistant coach Richie Adubato promoted to replace him on an interim basis.

A significant reason for Vitale&#x27;s downfall with the Pistons was the maneuver that brought Bob McAdoo to Detroit. M.L. Carr&#x27;s decision to sign with Boston as a free agent in 1979 spawned a transaction in which the Pistons, with Vitale in charge of player personnel, entitled to compensation for Carr, demanded McAdoo, whom the Celtics were looking to unload due to injuries. The Pistons sent two 1980 first-round draft picks (in addition to Carr) to the Celtics in exchange for McAdoo in a combination free agent signing/trade. The Pistons would have the worst season in franchise history in 1979–80, and their pick would become the first overall pick in the 1980 draft. Boston then traded the two picks to the Warriors (who selected Joe Barry Carroll with the number 1 pick and Rickey Brown with the number 13 pick) in exchange for Robert Parish and the number 3 pick (Kevin McHale).

==Broadcasting==
Following his departure as coach of the Detroit Pistons, Scotty Connal gave Vitale his first TV opportunity at ESPN cable network. His first reaction to the job of broadcaster was &quot;Absolutely no way. I know nothing about TV. I want to get back to where I belong and my spirit belongs.&quot; He was reluctant to accept the position but his wife Lorraine told him to &quot;go on TV and have some fun&quot;, so Vitale accepted on a temporary basis until another coaching job became available. He called ESPN&#x27;s first college basketball game on December 5, 1979, when DePaul defeated Wisconsin 90–77. His first play-by-play partner was Joe Boyle.

Vitale was not a natural at first for broadcasting. He missed his first-ever production meeting when he was walking the streets of Chicago. Also, he would talk while the producers were talking to him through his earpiece, during commercials, and while the play-by-play man was talking. Vitale himself was not sure if broadcasting would fit him. Connal, who had hired him, told him, &quot;You have a quality we can&#x27;t teach.&quot; Vitale did not understand this until many people wanted his autograph at the 1983 Final Four. He credits a lot of his success to working with Jim Simpson at the beginning of his career.

In 1985, after the American Broadcasting Company acquired ESPN, Vitale also began doing broadcasts on the ABC network.

In 1999, Vitale was featured in a series of thirty-second promo shorts for &quot;Hoops Malone&quot;. The shorts, which aired in heavy rotation on ESPN, were presented as a sitcom featuring Vitale, George Gervin and others, including a puppet called &quot;O&#x27;Hoolix&quot;. ESPN promoted &quot;Hoops&quot; with banners and other marketing premiums, with the idea of generating buzz about the show, but no actual episodes were ever produced. Though this led to an offer for Vitale to do an actual sitcom, he turned down the opportunity.

In December 2002, Vitale called a St. Vincent – St. Mary&#x27;s–Oak Hill Academy prep game, featuring then high school phenom LeBron James. He announced the game with Dan Shulman and NBA great Bill Walton.

By the 2004–05 season, Vitale was doing approximately 40 games a year.

Vitale is signed with ESPN through the 2023–24 college basketball season.

In February 2015, ESPN removed Vitale from covering Duke-UNC basketball. He had covered every Duke-UNC game televised by ESPN since 1979.

Vitale is a voter on the AP Top 25 men&#x27;s basketball polls, the annual Naismith Award and the John Wooden Award.

Vitale called his first NBA game on television since the 1984 NBA playoffs, along with Dan Shulman, on January 7, 2009, when the Miami Heat played the Denver Nuggets as ESPN swapped its NBA and NCAA crews. During ESPN&#x27;s first incarnation covering the NBA, he regularly covered games.

In January 2022, Vitale announced that he would take the remainder of the season off to rest his voice before undergoing planned vocal surgery and would not commentate any more college basketball games that season. He returned to broadcasting in November to provide coverage for the 2022 Champions Classic game between Kentucky and Michigan State.

===Broadcasting partners===
As of 2009, Vitale had called close to a thousand games. Vitale, a color commentator, is primarily paired with play-by-play announcers Mike Patrick, primarily those in the ACC games; and Dan Shulman for Saturday Primetime and other non-ACC games. During the postseason, he appears as an in-studio analyst with host Rece Davis and fellow analysts Jay Bilas, Digger Phelps, Hubert Davis, and Bob Knight. Previously, he has been paired with Keith Jackson, Roger Twibell, and Brent Musburger for ABC as well as Jim Simpson, Tim Brando, Mike Tirico, Dave O&#x27;Brien, Sean McDonough and Brad Nessler. He worked in the studio with Bob Ley, John Saunders, Tirico, and Chris Fowler as well as Jim Valvano.

<text>TD Waterhouse Canada Inc. is a Canadian financial services corporation headquartered in Toronto, Ontario. It is a wholly owned subsidiary of Toronto-Dominion Bank. The company does business through several divisions, namely TD Direct Investing, TD Wealth Financial Planning, and TD Wealth Private Investment Advice. The TD Waterhouse brand was also formerly used for TD&#x27;s American and British brokerages.

== History ==
TD&#x27;s original brokerage, Greenline Investor Services, was established in 1984. Greenline Investor Services merged with Gardiner Group Stockholders in 1987, becoming the first Canadian bank to purchase seats on the Toronto, Montreal, Vancouver and Alberta stock exchanges. In 1993, Greenline Investor Services acquired the operations of Marathon Brokerage, a Canadian discount brokerage. The TD Waterhouse brand originated as an American brand for discount brokerage when TD purchased Waterhouse Securities in 1996. The name TD Waterhouse was formed and was used for TD&#x27;s British, Canadian, and American brokerage activities. In Canada, TD Waterhouse thus replaced the brand Greenline.

In 1996, TD became the first online broker in Canada with the launch of WebBroker. In June 1999, TD spun off 42 million shares or 12.4% of TD Waterhouse in an IPO, with shares priced at $35.28 CAD or US$24 per share, earning US$1.01 billion. In 2001, with the bursting of the dot-com bubble and lower trade volumes that brought down Waterhouse&#x27;s share price, TD bought back that minority stake at US$9 per share for only US$378 million, earning a tidy profit on the privatization. The acquisition was conditional on TD owning at least 90 percent of Waterhouse&#x27;s outstanding common shares, and it owned almost 89 percent when the privatization was announced.

In 2003, Toronto–Dominion Bank held talks to merge Waterhouse with E*TRADE, which would have created the second-largest discount broker in the United States after Charles Schwab, but the two sides could not come to an agreement over control of the merged entity. Later in 2005, E*TRADE made an unsolicited offer for Ameritrade. However, Ameritrade instead purchased TD Waterhouse USA, with TD Bank holding a 39% stake in the new entity. As part of the deal, Ameritrade sold its Canadian operations to TD Bank who merged them with TD Waterhouse Canada. When TD merged its American brokerage activities with Ameritrade, the newly formed American broker formed the brand TD Ameritrade, but the Canadian division retained the TD Waterhouse brand.

In December 2012, TD replaced the TD Waterhouse Discount Brokerage brand with TD Direct Investing. TD Direct Investing Europe, a discount broking subsidiary in the United Kingdom, with headquarters in Leeds, which also used the TD Waterhouse brand, was sold in 2016 to Interactive Investor in a deal financed by JC Flowers.

In 2022, Charles Schwab purchased TD Ameritrade, and along with it, thinkorswim. At the time, thinkorswim as one of the electronic trading platforms TD Direct Investing customers use to perform trades. In light of this, TD Active Trader was announced in 2023 to serve clients that previously used thinkorswim. TD Waterhouse also began migrating TD Direct Investing clients off of thinkorswim the same year.

<text>Otto Rehhagel (; born 9 August 1938) is a German former football coach and player. 

Rehhagel is one of only two people who, as player and manager combined, has participated in over 1,000 Bundesliga matches (the other being Jupp Heynckes). In the Bundesliga, he holds the records for the most victories (387), most draws (205), most losses (228), and his teams have scored the most goals (1,473) and conceded more (1,142) than any other. He served as the head coach of Werder Bremen between 1981 and 1995 and won twice the Bundesliga and in 1992 the UEFA Cup Winners&#x27; Cup with them. After a rather unsuccessful intermezzo at Bayern Munich, he won the Bundesliga sensationally with the promoted team 1. FC Kaiserslautern.

Internationally, Rehhagel coached Greece from 2001 to 2010 in their most successful footballing era – during that period, Greece won the 2004 European Championship unexpectedly and qualified for the 2010 World Cup, their second World Cup finals appearance. A 2022 critically acclaimed film entitled, &quot;King Otto&quot;, was made on Otto Rehhagel&#x27;s triumph with the Greece national team for the 2004 European Championships.

==Playing career==
Born in Altenessen, Rehhagel began his playing career with local club TuS Helene Altenessen in 1948. He moved to Rot-Weiss Essen (1960–63), after the start of the Bundesliga for Hertha BSC (1963–65), and until 1972 for Kaiserslautern. He played 201 games in the Bundesliga. As a player, Rehhagel was known as a tough-as-nails defender.

==Managerial career==

===Early years===
In 1974, he took charge of Kickers Offenbach, but failed to make an immediate impact as a manager. Most famously, while in charge of Borussia Dortmund in 1978, he suffered a historic, record-setting 12–0 loss to Borussia Mönchengladbach, after which the tabloids called him &quot;Otto Torhagel&quot; (&quot;Tor&quot; means goal in German, and &quot;Hagel&quot; means a hailstorm). In 1980, Rehhagel won his first trophy as a manager, when his Fortuna Düsseldorf side won the DFB-Pokal.

===Werder Bremen===
Rehhagel managed Werder Bremen from 1981 to 1995. During these 14 golden years for the club, Rehhagel transformed Werder from a small minnow into a powerhouse, dazzling spectators with powerful up-tempo play and a smothering defence. During this spell, Werder Bremen established themselves as one of the main teams in the Bundesliga, overtaking hated rivals Hamburg as the top club in the north and sparking an intense feud with Bayern Munich. In the mid-eighties, Rehhagel often fell just short of success and had a string of second places and Cup Final losses. In that time, his nickname was &quot;Otto II&quot; or &quot;Vizeadmiral&quot; (&quot;Vice Admiral&quot;). However, Rehhagel led Werder Bremen to two German championships in 1988 and 1993, two DFB-Pokal victories in 1991 and 1994, as well as winning the European Cup Winners&#x27; Cup in 1992. In this period, Rehhagel produced a host of international stars, such as Rudi Völler, Karl-Heinz Riedle, Dieter Eilts, Marco Bode, Mario Basler, Hany Ramzy, Andreas Herzog and Rune Bratseth. Rehhagel&#x27;s Werder Bremen team of 1987–88 was at that time the squad which conceded the fewest goals ever in the Bundesliga (22), this record was surpassed by Bayern Munich in the 2007–08 season with 21 goals. His stint with Werder Bremen (14 years Bundesliga) is the second longest consecutive occupation as a manager ever in the Bundesliga. It was eventually surpassed by Volker Finke of Freiburg (16 years).

===Bayern Munich===
After 14 golden years at Werder Bremen, Rehhagel left to manage former hated rivals, Bayern Munich, before the start of the 1995–96 season. Prior to Rehhagel&#x27;s arrival, Bayern had a disappointing, but financially lucrative season in 1994–95 (a very poor sixth place in the Bundesliga, but semi-finals in the Champions League). In the summer of 1995, Bayern spent a lot of money, buying Jürgen Klinsmann, Andreas Herzog, and others, and Rehhagel was brought in as manager to replace Giovanni Trapattoni. It was widely expected that Munich would steamroll the opposition in 1995–96, but from day 1, Rehhagel clashed with the team and the team environment. His single-minded and occasionally eccentric ways did not mesh at all with Bayern, who quickly felt that Rehhagel was too rural at heart and had no clue about how to interact in the fancy environment of Munich. Moreover, Rehhagel&#x27;s old-school tactics and patronising of the Bayern players caused major antipathy in the Bayern team, especially from Klinsmann, who never missed an opportunity to take shots at Rehhagel. Despite Rehhagel getting Bayern to the UEFA Cup final, Bayern&#x27;s results in the Bundesliga dropped alarmingly in the second half of the season, and Rehhagel was famously sacked just 4 days before they were due to play in the first leg of the 1996 UEFA Cup final. Rehhagel&#x27;s job was taken over by Franz Beckenbauer, who led the team to victory in the 1996 UEFA Cup final, but saw no upturn in form in the last couple of weeks in the Bundesliga, leading Bayern to finished second, as Borussia Dortmund won their second German championship in a row.

===1. FC Kaiserslautern===
After being sacked by Bayern Munich, Rehhagel took over as manager of Kaiserslautern in 1996, after a season where the club had won the DFB-Pokal but had also been relegated from the top-flight following a catastrophic season in the Bundesliga. Rehhagel&#x27;s team won the 1996–97 2. Bundesliga by ten points, ending the season with a 7-6 win over SV Meppen.

In Rehhagel&#x27;s second season, Kaiserslautern won the Bundesliga title, the first and so far only German championship triumph by a team that had just been promoted the previous season. Going into the season, expectations were low and the team&#x27;s goal was only to avoid relegation. They started with a 1-0 win over reigning champions and Rehhagel&#x27;s former club, Bayern, and moved into first place after four matchdays. Kaiserslautern were still first when the two teams played again, and won again, giving them a seven point lead at the top of the table. Kaiserslautern secured the title with a win over VfL Wolfsburg in the penultimate game of the season. Kaiserslautern&#x27;s championship is regarded as one of the greatest achievements in German football history and was described as &quot;something that will never happen again&quot; by both Rehhagel and Rudi Völler.

As well as Jupp Heynckes, Rehhagel was offered the job of managing the Germany national team in summer 1998, but rejected it. In the season after the title, Rehhagel coached Kaiserslautern to the quarter-finals of the 1998–99 UEFA Champions League and a fifth-placed finish in the Bundesliga, having club captain Andreas Brehme and libero Miroslav Kadlec. Rehhagel resigned from Kaiserslautern in October 2000 after a bad start to the new season and pressure from supporters. His final year at the club had been marred by a public dispute with star player Ciriaco Sforza.

Rehhagel finished with a record of 87 wins, 39 draws, and 48 losses.

===Greece national team===
In August 2001, following Vassilis Daniil&#x27;s departure, Rehhagel was appointed as the new manager of Greece, ahead of other candidates, such as Marco Tardelli, Nevio Scala, Vanderlei Luxemburgo, and Terry Venables, who had also been considered for the managerial post. Rehhagel&#x27;s first match in charge was in October 2001, a 2002 World Cup qualifier against Finland, which ended in a 5–1 away defeat. As a result, he rebuilt the squad, and in October 2003, after a 1–0 win over Northern Ireland, Greece qualified automatically for Euro 2004, ahead of Spain and Ukraine. Ranked 150–1 outsiders, they nevertheless defeated host nation Portugal, holders France and the much more fancied Czech Republic on the way to the final, where they again defeated Portugal 1–0. Rehhagel, who was seen as the man most responsible for the team&#x27;s success, became the first foreign manager ever to win a European Championship and remains the only one to date. Despite not having a star-studded line-up, the Greek team won the championship, conceding no goals in the knockout stage.
Rehhagel adopted a defensive approach in playing his Greek side, using energetic midfielders to wear down the opponents and the policy of defending in numbers to numb the opposition&#x27;s attacks. When charged with boring play, he said, &quot;No one should forget that a coach adapts the tactics to the characteristics of the available players.&quot; His time at Werder Bremen, in contrast, saw play described as flashy and spectacular attacking football.

After Rudi Völler resigned as Germany coach in the wake of that country&#x27;s first-round exit in Euro 2004, Rehhagel was considered by many to be a strong candidate for his homeland&#x27;s job. He had the support of the public, despite being considered a maverick by the footballing establishment. After three other candidates removed themselves from consideration, Rehhagel received an offer to take over as Germany coach, which he officially turned down on 10 July.

In their qualifying group for the 2006 FIFA World Cup, the Greek side failed to make the grade, finishing fourth in a tough group which saw Ukraine advance as group winner and Turkey go on to the play-off. The team returned to success though by qualifying for Euro 2008, ending the qualifying stage with the highest points total of any team and ensuring they would be able to defend their title. On 30 March 2008, Rehhagel extended his contract with Greece until 2010. The Euro 2008 ended in disappointment after three group stage losses against Sweden, Russia, and eventual winners Spain.

For the 2010 FIFA World Cup qualifying group and having finished second in Group 2 behind Switzerland, coach Rehhagel and the national team faced Ukraine in a two-legged play-off and won 1–0 in Donetsk after a 0–0 draw in Piraeus, with Dimitris Salpingidis scoring the winner. The win against Ukraine allowed the Greek squad to compete in the 2010 FIFA World Cup held in South Africa and solidified the position of Otto Rehhagel as one of the most important people in the history of Greek sport. At the age of 71, he also became the oldest national team manager to coach in a FIFA World Cup, surpassing Cesare Maldini&#x27;s record from 2002.
Greece lost to South Korea, Argentina, defeated Nigeria 2–1 and exited the FIFA World Cup in the group stage, despite Salpingidis scoring Greece&#x27;s first ever goal in a World Cup against Nigeria. Rehhagel announced his intention to leave his coaching position after the World Cup. On 23 June 2010, he announced his resignation from Greece.

The 2021 documentary &quot;King Otto&quot; by New York-based director Christopher André Marks chronicles Rehhagel&#x27;s success in Greece. The film&#x27;s opening line quotes the first line of Homer&#x27;s &quot;Odyssey&quot;, &quot;Tell me, O muse, of that ingenious hero who travelled far and wide&quot;.

===Hertha BSC===

Rehhagel signed for ailing Bundesliga club Hertha BSC and was manager of the club between 18 February 2012 and 30 June 2012. His attempt to save Hertha from relegation however ended in a failure, after the Berliners were defeated by 2. Bundesliga club Fortuna Düsseldorf in a two-legged playoff. Rehhagel finished with a record of three wins, three draws, and eight losses.

==Style of management==
Rehhagel popularized the phrase &quot;kontrollierte Offensive&quot; (controlled offence). He prefers a grass-roots approach to football, stressing the importance of at least two (often also three) big, strong headers in central defence. His defensive schemes often use a dominant libero, such as Rune Bratseth, Miroslav Kadlec, or Traianos Dellas. In defence, Rehhagel usually prefers robustness and height over footballing abilities (the most notorious example being Ulrich Borowka). In the period of all-round, fluid defence, many have criticized this as dated and anachronistic, with Rehhagel rebutting the claims due to his success.

Rehhagel&#x27;s teams regularly develop pressure on the wings complemented with at least one dominant header as the central striker. Examples include Mario Basler/Marco Bode playing on the wings at Bremen or Andreas Buck/Marco Reich at Kaiserslautern while (Rudi Völler, Karl-Heinz Riedle, Frank Neubarth, Olaf Marschall, and Angelos Charisteas) at the top of the formation.

The backbone of his teams are usually older, more experienced players while younger talents rarely find themselves taking responsibility. At Kaiserslautern, Rehhagel often kept the young Michael Ballack on the bench as a substitute. Despite this, he is also known for being an excellent talent scout, having discovered Völler, Riedle, Marco Bode, Dieter Eilts, Marco Reich, Miroslav Klose, Angelos Charisteas, Sotiris Kyrgiakos, Theofanis Gekas and many others.

With Greece he used man-marking, which was an unusual tactical throwback at the time, meaning their opponents were unprepared to combat it.

Rehhagel is also known for being a good motivator. His teams possess a lot of team spirit, most famously the Greece national team, which he turned from a dead-end squad nobody wanted to play for into a must-be-there-at-all-costs team. He is also famous for reigniting the careers of older players, such as Manfred Burgsmüller, Mirko Votava, Olaf Marschall or Theodoros Zagorakis.

Rehhagel is also a deft and ruthless club politician. He is notorious for restructuring clubs by making friends with powerful people and using them to eliminate the opposition in order to wield absolute power, preferring the system of a benign dictatorship. His way of handling a club – in a competent and innovative, but also highly patronizing and condescending way – has been immortalized as &quot;ottocracy&quot;, a pun on his name alluding to the style of management/government; autocracy.

Finally, Rehhagel is considered somewhat of a maverick in Germany. In decades of interviews, he has established a reputation for being eccentric, similarly to José Mourinho and Brian Clough. However, seeing his impressive record, he is apparently able to back up his words.

Famous players associated with Rehhagel include Klaus Allofs, Mario Basler, Marco Bode, Rune Bratseth, Manfred Burgsmüller, Theofanis Gekas, Angelos Charisteas, Traianos Dellas, Dieter Eilts, Andreas Herzog, Marian Hristov, Miroslav Klose, Olaf Marschall, Hany Ramzy, Karl-Heinz Riedle, Wynton Rufer, Thomas Schaaf, Ciriaco Sforza, Rudi Völler, Theodoros Zagorakis, Andreas Brehme and Michael Ballack.

==Personal life==

Rehhagel is married to Beate Rehhagel from Steele, Essen since 1963. They have one child, Jens Rehhagel, who has played football at semi-professional level.

Rehhagel likes to call himself &quot;Kind der Bundesliga&quot; (&quot;Child of the Bundesliga&quot;), having played in the very first Bundesliga game, and spent his club career there, with nine teams. In Greece, he is occasionally called &quot;King Otto&quot; (βασιλιάς Όθων), probably in allusion to King Otto of Greece from Bavaria, however he already had this nickname during his coaching career in Germany. As a pun referring to Herakles, son of Zeus, he has been nicknamed &quot;Rehakles&quot; as well. Rehhagel is an honorary citizen of Athens.

<text>A Lissajous curve , also known as Lissajous figure or Bowditch curve , is the graph of a system of parametric equations

: formula_1

which describe the superposition of two perpendicular oscillations in x and y directions of different angular frequency (&quot;a&quot; and &quot;b).&quot; The resulting family of curves was investigated by Nathaniel Bowditch in 1815, and later in more detail in 1857 by Jules Antoine Lissajous (for whom it has been named). Such motions may be considered as a particular kind of complex harmonic motion.

The appearance of the figure is sensitive to the ratio . For a ratio of 1, when the frequencies match a=b, the figure is an ellipse, with special cases including circles (, radians) and lines (). A small change to one of the frequencies will mean the x oscillation after one cycle will be slightly out of synchronization with the y motion and so the ellipse will fail to close and trace a curve slightly adjacent during the next orbit showing as a precession of the ellipse. The pattern closes if the frequencies are whole number ratios i.e. is rational. 

Another simple Lissajous figure is the parabola (, ). Again a small shift of one frequency from the ratio 2 will result in the trace not closing but performing multiple loops successively shifted only closing if the ratio is rational as before. A complex dense pattern may form see below.

The visual form of such curves is often suggestive of a three-dimensional knot, and indeed many kinds of knots, including those known as Lissajous knots, project to the plane as Lissajous figures.

Visually, the ratio determines the number of &quot;lobes&quot; of the figure. For example, a ratio of or produces a figure with three major lobes (see image). Similarly, a ratio of produces a figure with five horizontal lobes and four vertical lobes. Rational ratios produce closed (connected) or &quot;still&quot; figures, while irrational ratios produce figures that appear to rotate. The ratio determines the relative width-to-height ratio of the curve. For example, a ratio of produces a figure that is twice as wide as it is high. Finally, the value of determines the apparent &quot;rotation&quot; angle of the figure, viewed as if it were actually a three-dimensional curve. For example, produces and components that are exactly in phase, so the resulting figure appears as an apparent three-dimensional figure viewed from straight on (0°). In contrast, any non-zero produces a figure that appears to be rotated, either as a left–right or an up–down rotation (depending on the ratio ).

Lissajous figures where , ( is a natural number) and

: formula_2

are Chebyshev polynomials of the first kind of degree . This property is exploited to produce a set of points, called Padua points, at which a function may be sampled in order to compute either a bivariate interpolation or quadrature of the function over the domain .

The relation of some Lissajous curves to Chebyshev polynomials is clearer to understand if the Lissajous curve which generates each of them is expressed using cosine functions rather than sine functions.

==Examples==
The animation shows the curve adaptation with continuously increasing fraction from 0 to 1 in steps of 0.01 ().

Below are examples of Lissajous figures with an odd natural number , an even natural number , and .

==Generation==
Prior to modern electronic equipment, Lissajous curves could be generated mechanically by means of a harmonograph.

=== Practical application ===
Lissajous curves can also be generated using an oscilloscope (as illustrated). An octopus circuit can be used to demonstrate the waveform images on an oscilloscope. Two phase-shifted sinusoid inputs are applied to the oscilloscope in X-Y mode and the phase relationship between the signals is presented as a Lissajous figure.

In the professional audio world, this method is used for realtime analysis of the phase relationship between the left and right channels of a stereo audio signal. On larger, more sophisticated audio mixing consoles an oscilloscope may be built-in for this purpose.

On an oscilloscope, we suppose is CH1 and is CH2, is the amplitude of CH1 and is the amplitude of CH2, is the frequency of CH1 and is the frequency of CH2, so is the ratio of frequencies of the two channels, and is the phase shift of CH1.

A purely mechanical application of a Lissajous curve with , is in the driving mechanism of the Mars Light type of oscillating beam lamps popular with railroads in the mid-1900s. The beam in some versions traces out a lopsided figure-8 pattern on its side.

==Application for the case of ==
When the input to an LTI system is sinusoidal, the output is sinusoidal with the same frequency, but it may have a different amplitude and some phase shift. Using an oscilloscope that can plot one signal against another (as opposed to one signal against time) to plot the output of an LTI system against the input to the LTI system produces an ellipse that is a Lissajous figure for the special case of . The aspect ratio of the resulting ellipse is a function of the phase shift between the input and output, with an aspect ratio of 1 (perfect circle) corresponding to a phase shift of ±90° and an aspect ratio of ∞ (a line) corresponding to a phase shift of 0° or 180°.

The figure below summarizes how the Lissajous figure changes over different phase shifts. The phase shifts are all negative so that delay semantics can be used with a causal LTI system (note that −270° is equivalent to +90°). The arrows show the direction of rotation of the Lissajous figure.

A Lissajous curve is used in experimental tests to determine if a device may be properly categorized as a memristor. It is also used to compare two different electrical signals: a known reference signal and a signal to be tested.

==In popular culture==

===In motion pictures===
*Lissajous figures were sometimes displayed on oscilloscopes meant to simulate high-tech equipment in science-fiction TV shows and movies in the 1960s and 1970s.

*The title sequence by John Whitney for Alfred Hitchcock&#x27;s 1958 feature film &quot;Vertigo&quot; is based on Lissajous figures.

===Company logos===

Lissajous figures are sometimes used in graphic design as logos. Examples include:
* The Australian Broadcasting Corporation (, , )
* The Lincoln Laboratory at MIT (, , )
* The open air club Else in Berlin (, , )
* The University of Electro-Communications, Japan (, , ).
* Disney&#x27;s Movies Anywhere streaming video application uses a stylized version of the curve
* Facebook&#x27;s rebrand into Meta Platforms is also a Lissajous Curve, echoing the shape of a capital letter M (, , ).
* Home State Brewing co. Used as their logo and signifying a single moment as well as the passage of time - Ichi-go ichi-e

===In modern art===
* The Dadaist artist Max Ernst painted Lissajous figures directly by swinging a punctured bucket of paint over a canvas.

===In music education===
Lissajous curves have been used in the past to graphically represent musical intervals through the use of the Harmonograph, a device that consists of pendulums oscillating at different frequency ratios. Because different tuning systems employ different frequency ratios to define intervals, these can be compared using Lissajous curves to observe their differences. Therefore, Lissajous curves have applications in music education by graphically representing differences between intervals and among tuning systems.

<doc id="753761" wikidata="Q3569735" url="?curid=753761" title="Wolstein Center">
<text>The Bert L. and Iris S. Wolstein Center is a 13,610-seat indoor arena located in downtown Cleveland, Ohio, United States, on the campus of Cleveland State University (CSU). It is home to the Cleveland State Vikings men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s basketball teams and previously served as the home of the Cleveland Crunch of the National Professional Soccer League and Major Indoor Soccer League from 1992 to 2005 and the Cleveland Charge of the NBA G League from 2021 to 2024. 

The building opened in 1991 as a replacement for Woodling Gym and was known until 2005 as the CSU Convocation Center. It is named for Bert Wolstein, a Cleveland area real estate developer, former owner of the Force, and CSU alumnus, and his wife Iris. The main arena is known as Henry J. Goodman Arena, named for a businessman and former chairman of the CSU Board of Trustees.

In its full configuration, it seats 13,610 for basketball, and with additional floor seating can hold 15,000 for concerts and professional wrestling. In addition to the arena, the Wolstein Center also has a practice gym and grand ballroom. It is the largest basketball arena in the Horizon League and the second-largest college basketball arena in Ohio by total seating capacity.

In recent years, Cleveland State has downsized capacity for basketball to 8,500 for most Vikings games. The basketball floor is placed closer to the eastern baseline, and the western third of the arena is curtained off. For many games only lower-level seating is available and upper-level seating sections are covered with tarps, further reducing available seating. The area behind the curtain is used for a variety of other purposes, including a &quot;Kids Fun Zone&quot; children&#x27;s play area during games. The curtain itself was adorned with a large American flag for several years and since 2023 features a video board and auxiliary scoreboards facing the court.

The Wolstein Center has also hosted numerous concerts, featuring artists such as David Bowie, Elton John, Martina McBride, TLC, Carrie Underwood, Justin Bieber, Janet Jackson, 311, The Beastie Boys, The Cure, The Blue Man Group and Twenty One Pilots. The arena was site of the 1998 NCAA Division I Wrestling Championships and served as host for first and second-round games of the 2000 and 2005 NCAA Division I men&#x27;s basketball tournaments as well as the 2019 NCAA Fencing Championships.

==History==

Construction on the Wolstein Center began in August 1989 in the aftermath of the team&#x27;s run to the Sweet Sixteen in the 1986 NCAA Division I men&#x27;s basketball tournament. Prior to its opening, the team played at Woodling Gym on campus or (for higher profile games) at the 10,000-seat Public Auditorium. The arena was completed on November 1, 1991, at a cost of $55 million. The 13,610 seats made the Wolstein Center the largest arena in downtown Cleveland until the opening of Gund Arena in 1994, and it was the largest university-owned arena in Ohio until 1998 when Value City Arena opened at Ohio State University.

The main arena is named Goodman Arena after Henry J. Goodman, former chairman of the Cleveland State board of trustees, while the building is named after Bert and Iris Wolstein, who donated $6.5 million towards the building&#x27;s construction, the largest philanthropic gift in CSU history. The building also contains a practice gym, a grand ballroom, six-room conference center, and eight concession stands. In the arena, there is a 100-seat party loge located above the seating in the west baseline.

===Cleveland Charge ===

From 2021 to 2024, the arena was home to the Cleveland Charge, the NBA G League affiliate of the Cleveland Cavaliers. The team, previously located in Canton, Ohio, as the Canton Charge, announced the move to Cleveland on June 9, 2021, and began play at the Wolstein Center in the 2021–22 season. 

The team announced a six-year agreement with the city of Cleveland in June 2024 to move home games to Public Auditorium in downtown Cleveland beginning with the 2024–25 season. 

While a rumored &quot;impending demolition&quot; of the Wolstein Center as part of Cleveland State University&#x27;s 2022 master plan was mentioned as a reason for the move to Public Auditorium, Cleveland State University stated that there are no immediate plans regarding the arena&#x27;s future.

<text>The Hawaiian monk seal (Neomonachus schauinslandi) is an endangered species of earless seal in the family Phocidae that is endemic to the Hawaiian Islands.

The Hawaiian monk seal is one of two extant monk seal species; the other is the Mediterranean monk seal. A third species, the Caribbean monk seal, is extinct.

The Hawaiian monk seal is the only seal native to Hawaii, and, along with the Hawaiian hoary bat, is one of only two mammals endemic to the islands.

&quot;N. schauinslandi&quot; is a conservation reliant endangered species. The small population of about 1,400 individuals is threatened by human encroachment, very low levels of genetic variation, entanglement in fishing nets, marine debris, disease, and past commercial hunting for skins. There are many methods of conservation biology when it comes to endangered species; translocation, captive care, habitat cleanup, and educating the public about the Hawaiian monk seal are some of the methods that can be employed.
== Etymology ==
Known to native Hawaiians as Ilio-holo-i-ka-uaua, or &quot;dog that runs in rough water&quot;, its scientific name is from Hugo Schauinsland, a German scientist who discovered a skull on Laysan Island in 1899. Its common name, and the first element of its scientific name, comes from short hairs on its head, said to resemble a monk. It is the official state mammal of Hawaii.

==Description==
Its grey coat, white belly, and slender physique distinguish them from the distantly related harbor seal (&quot;Phoca vitulina&quot;). The monk seal&#x27;s physique is ideal for hunting its prey: fish, lobster, octopus and squid in deep water coral beds. When it is not hunting and eating, it generally basks on the sandy beaches and volcanic rock of the Northwest Hawaiian Islands.

The Hawaiian monk seal is part of the family Phocidae, being named so for its characteristic lack of external ears and inability to rotate its hind flippers under the body. The Hawaiian monk seal has a relatively small, flat head with large black eyes, eight pairs of teeth, and short snouts with the nostril on top of the snout and vibrissae on each side. The nostrils are small vertical slits which close when the seal dives underwater. Additionally, their slender, torpedo-shaped body and hind flippers allow them to be very agile swimmers.

Adult males are in weight and in length while adult females tend to be, on average, slightly larger, at and in length. When monk seal pups are born, they average and in length. As they nurse for approximately six weeks, they grow considerably, eventually weighing between by the time they are weaned, while the mother loses up to .

Monk seals, like elephant seals, shed their hair and the outer layer of their skin in an annual catastrophic molt. During the most active period of the molt, about 10 days for the Hawaiian monk seal, the seal remains on the beach. The hair, generally dark gray on the dorsal side and lighter silver ventrally, gradually changes color through the year with exposure to atmospheric conditions. Sunlight and seawater cause the dark gray to become brown and the light silver to become yellow-brown, while long periods of time spent in the water can also promote algae growth, giving many seals a green tinge. The juvenile coat of the monk seal, manifest in a molt by the time a pup is weaned is silver-gray; pups are born with black pelage. Many Hawaiian monk seals sport scars from shark attacks or entanglements with fishing gear. Maximum life expectancy is 25 to 30 years.

==Evolution and migration==

The monk seals are members of the Phocidae. In an influential 1977 paper, Repenning and Ray proposed, based on certain unspecialized features, that they were the most primitive living seals. However, this idea has since been entirely superseded.

In an effort to inform the public and conserve the seals, the National Oceanic Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Fisheries Service developed a historical timeline to demonstrate that the Hawaiian islands has been home to the seals for millions of years and that the seals belong there. Evidence points to monk seals migrating to Hawaii between 4–11 million years ago (mya) through an open water passage between North and South America called the Central American Seaway. The Isthmus of Panama closed the Seaway approximately 3 million years ago.

Berta and Sumich ask how this species came to the Hawaiian Islands when its closest relatives are on the other side of the world in the North Atlantic and Mediterranean Sea. The species may have evolved in the Pacific or Atlantic, but in either case, came to Hawaii long before the first Polynesians.

==Ecology==

===Habitat===
The majority of the Hawaiian monk seal population can be found around the Northwest Hawaiian Islands but a small and growing population lives around the main Hawaiian Islands. These seals spend two-thirds of their time at sea. Monk seals spend much of their time foraging in deeper water outside of shallow lagoon reefs at sub-photic depths of or more. Hawaiian monk seals breed and haul-out on sand, corals, and volcanic rock; sandy beaches are more commonly used for pupping. Due to the immense distance separating the Hawaiian Islands from other land masses capable of supporting the Hawaiian monk seal, its habitat is limited to the Hawaiian Islands.

===Feeding===
Hawaiian monk seals mainly prey on reef dwelling bony fish, but they also prey on cephalopods, and crustaceans. Both juveniles and sub-adults prey more on smaller octopus species, such as &quot;Octopus leteus&quot; and &quot;O. hawaiiensis&quot;, nocturnal octopus species, and eels than the adult Hawaiian monk seals, while adult seals feed mostly on larger octopus species such as &quot;O. cyanea&quot;. Hawaiian monk seals have a broad and diverse diet due to foraging plasticity which allows them to be opportunistic predators that feed on a wide variety of available prey.

Hawaiian monk seals can hold their breath for up to 20 minutes and dive more than ; however, they usually dive an average of 6 minutes to depths of less than to forage at the seafloor.

===Predators===
Tiger sharks, great white sharks and Galapagos sharks are the main predators of the Hawaiian monk seal.

==Behavior==
===Reproduction===
Hawaiian monk seals mate in the water during their breeding season, which occurs between June and August. Females reach maturity at age four and give birth to one pup a year. The fetus takes nine months to develop, with birth occurring between March and June. Pups start around and are about long.

===Nursing===
The pups are born on beaches and nursed for about six weeks. The mother does not eat or leave the pup while nursing. After that time, the mother deserts the pup, leaving it on its own, and returns to the sea to forage for the first time since the pup&#x27;s arrival.

==Status==

Most seals are found on the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands.

The Hawaiian monk seal is endangered, although its cousin species, the Mediterranean monk seal (&quot;M. monachus&quot;), is even rarer, and the even more closely related Caribbean monk seal (&quot;N. tropicalis&quot;), last sighted in the 1950s, was officially declared extinct in June 2008. In 2010, it was estimated that only 1100 individuals remained. A later estimate in 2016, which included a more complete survey of small populations, was approximately 1400 individuals.

Seals nearly disappeared from the main islands, but the population has begun to recover. The growing population there was approximately 150 as of 2004 and 300 as of 2016. Individuals have been sighted in surf breaks and on beaches in Kauai, Niihau and Maui. Community volunteers on Oʻahu have made many anecdotal blog reports of sightings around the island since 2008. In early June 2010, two seals hauled out on Oahu&#x27;s popular Waikiki beach. Seals have hauled out at O&#x27;ahu&#x27;s Turtle Bay, and again beached at Waikiki on March 4, 2011, by the Moana Hotel. Another Monk Seal appeared at Punalu&#x27;u Black Sands Beach in July 2023. Yet another adult came ashore for a rest next to the breakwater in Kapiolani Park Waikiki on the morning of December 11, 2012, after first being spotted traveling west along the reef break from the Aquarium side of the Park. On June 29, 2017 monk seal #RH58 popularly known as &quot;Rocky&quot; gave birth to a pup on Kaimana Beach fronting Kapiolani park. Despite the fact Kaimana beach is popular and busy, Rocky has been routinely hauling out on this beach for several years. In 2006, twelve pups were born in the main islands, rising to thirteen in 2007, and eighteen in 2008. As of 2008 43 pups had been counted in the main islands.

The Hawaiian monk seal was officially designated as an endangered species on November 23, 1976, and is now protected by the Endangered Species Act and the Marine Mammal Protection Act. It is illegal to kill, capture or harass a Hawaiian monk seal. Even with these protections, human activity along Hawaii&#x27;s fragile coastlines (and in the world at large) still provides many stressors.

===Threats===
Natural factors threatening the Hawaiian monk seal include low juvenile survival rates, reduction of habitat/prey associated with environmental changes, increased male aggression, and subsequent skewed gender ratios. Anthropogenic or human impacts include hunting (during the 1800s and 1900s) and the resulting small gene pool, continuing human disturbance, entanglement in marine debris, and fishery interactions.

====Natural threats====
Low juvenile survival rates continue to threaten the species. High juvenile mortality is due to starvation and marine debris entanglement. Another contributor to the low juvenile survival rates is predation from sharks, including tiger sharks. Most mature monk seals bear scars from shark encounters, and many such attacks have been observed.

Reduced prey abundance can lead to starvation, with one cause being reduction in habitat associated with environmental change. Habitat is shrinking due to erosion in the Northwest Hawaiian Islands, reducing the size of islands/beaches. Lobsters, the seals&#x27; preferred food other than fish, have been overfished. Competition from other predators such as sharks, jacks, and barracudas leaves little for developing pups. The creation of Papahānaumokuākea Marine National Monument which encloses these islands may expand food supplies.

&quot;Mobbing&quot; is a practice among the seals that involves multiple males attacking one female in mating attempts. Mobbing is responsible for many deaths, especially to females.

Mobbing leaves the targeted individual with wounds that increase vulnerability to sepsis, killing the victim via infection. Smaller populations were more likely to experience mobbing as a result of the higher male/female ratio and male aggression. Unbalanced sex-ratios were more likely to occur in slow-growing populations.

Postmortem examinations of some seal carcasses revealed gastric ulcerations caused by parasites. Some of the infectious diseases that pose a threat to the Hawaiian monk seal populations include distemper viruses, West Nile Virus, &quot;Leptospira&quot; spp., and &quot;Toxoplasma gondii&quot;. Protozoal-related mortality, specifically due to toxoplasmosis, are becoming a great threat to the recovery of the endangered Hawaiian monk seal and other native Hawaiian marine life.

====Anthropogenic impacts====
In the nineteenth century, large numbers of seals were killed by whalers and sealers for meat, oil and skin. U.S. military forces hunted them during World War II, while occupying Laysan Island and Midway.

The Hawaiian monk seal has the lowest level of genetic variability among the 18 phocid species. This low genetic variability was allegedly due to a population bottleneck caused by intense hunting in the 19th century. This limited genetic variability reduces the species ability to adapt to environmental pressures and limits natural selection, thus increasing their risk of extinction. Given the monk seal&#x27;s small population, the effects of disease could be disastrous.

Monk seals can be affected by the toxoplasmosis pathogen in cat feces that enters the ocean in polluted runoff and wastewater, a new phenomenon. Since 2001, toxoplasmosis has killed at least eleven seals. Other human-introduced pathogens, including leptospirosis, have infected monk seals.

Human disturbances have had immense effects on the populations of the Hawaiian monk seal. Monk seals tend to avoid beaches where they are disturbed; after continual disturbance the seal may completely abandon the beach, thus reducing its habitat size, subsequently limiting population growth. For instance, large beach crowds and beach structures limit the seal&#x27;s habitat. Although the WWII military bases in the northwestern islands were closed, minimal human activities can be enough to disturb the species.

Marine fisheries can potentially interact with monk seals via direct and indirect relationships. Directly the seal can become snared by fishing equipment, entangled in discarded debris, and even feed on fish refuse. Although international law prohibits the intentional discarding of debris from ships at sea, entanglement still results in mortality because the seals get trapped in unintentional marine debris such as fishing nets and cannot maneuver or even reach the surface to breathe. Monk seals have one of the highest documented rates of entanglement of any pinniped species.

===Conservation===

In 1909, President Theodore Roosevelt created the Hawaiian Islands Reservation that included the Northwest Hawaiian islands. The Reservation later became the Hawaiian Islands National Wildlife Refuge (HINWR) and moved under the jurisdiction of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS). Throughout the 1980s, the National Marine Fisheries Service completed various versions of an Environmental Impact Statement that designated the Northwest Hawaiian Islands as a critical habitat for the Hawaiian monk seal. The designation prohibited lobster fishing in waters less than in the Northwest Hawaiian Islands and within of Laysan Island. The National Marine Fisheries Service designated all beach areas, lagoon waters, and ocean waters out to a depth of (later ) around the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands, except for one of the Midway group, Sand Island. In 2006, a Presidential Proclamation established the Papahanaumokuakea Marine National Monument, which incorporated the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands Coral Reef Ecosystem Reserve, the Midway Atoll National Wildlife Refuge, the Hawaiian Islands National Wildlife Refuge, and the Battle of Midway National Memorial, thus creating the largest marine protected area in the world and affording the Hawaiian monk seal further protection.

NOAA cultivated a network of volunteers to protect the seals while they bask or bear and nurse their young. NOAA is funding considerable research on seal population dynamics and health in conjunction with the Marine Mammal Center.

From NOAA, several programs and networks were formed to help the Hawaiian monk seal. Community programs such as PIRO have helped to improve community standards for the Hawaiian monk seal. The program also creates networks with the Native Hawaiians on the island to network more people in the fight for conservation of the seals. The Marine Mammal Response Network (MMRN) is partnered with NOAA and several other government agencies that deal with land and marine wildlife.

The &quot;Recovery Plan for the Hawaiian Monk Seal&quot; identifies public outreach and education as a key action for promoting the conservation of the Hawaiian monk seal and its habitat.

To raise awareness of the species&#x27; plight, on June 11, 2008, a state law designated the Hawaiian monk seal as Hawaii&#x27;s official State Mammal.

The task is to identify a manner of alleviation that is possible, cost-effective, and likely to maximize the organic return (in terms of growth potential) until much time has passed and natural conditions allow scientists to observe the effects.

====Protecting female pups====
One key natural factor affecting the seal populations is the male-biased sex-ratio, which results in increased aggressive behaviors such as mobbing. These aggressive behaviors decrease the number of females in the population. Two programs effectively aid female survival rates.

A headstarting project began in 1981, collecting and tagging female pups after weaning and placing them in a large, enclosed water and beach area with food and lacking disturbances. The female pups remain during the summer months, leaving at roughly age three to seven months.

Another project began in 1984 at French Frigate Shoals. It collected severely underweight female pups, placed them in protective care, and fed them. The pups were relocated to Kure Atoll and released as yearlings.

Some habitats are better suited to increase survival probability, making relocation a popular and promising method. Although no direct links between infectious diseases and seal mortality rates have been found, unidentified infectious diseases could prove detrimental to relocation strategies. Identification and mitigation of these and other possible factors limiting population growth represent ongoing challenges and are the primary objectives of the Hawaiian monk seal conservation and recovery effort.

It is also important to consider the mothers who nurse their pups. Seal milk is very rich in nutrients, allowing pups to gain weight rapidly. With the rich milk from the mother, the pup is more likely to quadruple its initial weight before weaning. The mother seal also loses a tremendous amount of weight while nursing.

====Draft environment impact statement====
In 2011, the National Marine Fisheries Service issued a controversial draft programmatic environmental impact statement intended to improve protections for the monk seal. The plan includes:
* Expanded surveys using technology such as remote cameras and unmanned, remotely operated aircraft.
* Vaccination studies and vaccination programs.
* De-worming program to improve juvenile survival.
* Relocation to the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands.
* Diet supplements at feeding stations in the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands.
* Tools to modify undesirable contact with people and fishing gear in the main islands.
* Chemical alteration of aggressive monk seal behavior.

<text>Photogravure (in French &quot;héliogravure&quot;) is a process for printing photographs, also sometimes used for reproductive intaglio printmaking. It is a photo-mechanical process whereby a copper plate is grained (adding a pattern to the plate) and then coated with a light-sensitive gelatin tissue which had been exposed to a film positive, and then etched, resulting in a high quality intaglio plate that can reproduce detailed continuous tones of a photograph.

The process was important in 19th-century photography, but by the 20th century was only used by some fine art photographers. By the mid-century it was almost extinct, but has seen a limited revival.

==History==

===History of process===
The earliest forms of photogravure were developed by two original pioneers of photography itself, first Nicéphore Niépce in France in the 1820s, and later Henry Fox Talbot in England. Niépce was seeking a means to create photographic images on plates that could then be etched and used to make prints on paper with a traditional printing press. He used prints (engravings etc.), waxing the paper to make it translucent, then laying this on a copper plate coated with light-sensitive bitumen. Niépce&#x27;s early images were among the first photographs, pre-dating daguerreotypes and the later wet collodion photographic process. But the process was little used, not least because the original engraving was all but destroyed. But once a &quot;transparent photographic positive&quot; became possible, interest revived.

Talbot, inventor of the calotype paper negative process, wanted to make paper prints that would not fade. He worked on his photomechanical process in the 1850s and patented it in 1852 (&#x27;photographic engraving&#x27;) and 1858 (&#x27;photoglyphic engraving&#x27;).

Photogravure in its mature form was developed in 1878 by Czech painter Karel Klíč, who built on Talbot&#x27;s research.:4 This process, the one still in use today, is called the Talbot-Klič process.

===History of use===
Because of its high quality and richness, photogravure was used for both original fine art prints in the form of photographs manipulated by various means on the negative and for photo-reproduction of works from other media such as paintings. From the 1880s, the Talbot-Klič process was used commercially for very high quality reproductions of old master prints, excelling in capturing variations in tone.

Photogravure practitioners, such as Peter Henry Emerson, brought the art to a high standard in the late 19th century. This continued with the work of Alfred Stieglitz in the early 20th century, especially in relation to his publication &quot;Camera Work&quot;. This publication also featured the photogravures of Alvin Langdon Coburn who was a fine gravure printer and envisioned his photographic work as gravures rather than other photo-based processes. 

The speed and convenience of silver-gelatin photography eventually displaced photogravure which fell into disuse after the Edward S. Curtis gravures in the 1920s. One of the last major portfolios of fine art photogravures was Paul Strand&#x27;s &quot;Photographs from Mexico&quot; from 1940, reissued as &quot;The Mexican Portfolio&quot; in 1967 by DeCapo Press. 

Many years later, photogravure has experienced a revival in the hands of &quot;Aperture&quot; and Jon Goodman, who studied it in Europe. Photogravure is now actively practiced in several dozen workshops around the world. Contemporary artists working in the medium include Sama Alshaibi. Photogravure may be used in combination with other print processes. 
==== Stamps ====
Photogravure has often been used to print stamps. For example, between 1934 and 1936, stamps of King George V were produced by the British postal service using photogravure. In the United States, the Bureau of Engraving and Printing began printing stamps in gravure from its own press in 1971.

==Qualities==

Photogravure registers a wide variety of tones, through the transfer of etching ink from an etched copper plate to special dampened paper run through an etching press. The unique tonal range comes from photogravure&#x27;s variable depth of etch, that is, the shadows are etched many times deeper than the highlights. Unlike half-tone processes which vary the size of dot, the depth of ink wells is varied in a photogravure plate. The human eye resolves these fine variations into a continuous tone image. 

Photogravure is distinguished from rotogravure in that photogravure uses a flat copper plate etched rather deeply and printed by hand, while in rotogravure, as the name implies, a rotary cylinder is only lightly etched, and it is a factory printing process for newspapers, magazines, and packaging. The Getty Conservation Institute&#x27;s The Atlas of Analytical Signatures of Photographic Processes provides guidelines for identifying photogravures and distinguishing them from rotogravure prints. 

In French, the correct term for photogravure is , while the French term refers to any photo-based etching technique.

==Technique==
Photogravure plates go through several distinct stages:

* First, a continuous tone film positive is made from the original photographic negative. A smaller negative can be enlarged onto a sheet of film, which is then processed to a range of continuous tones with specific densities.
* The second stage is to sensitize a sheet of pigmented gelatin tissue by immersion into a 3.5% solution of potassium dichromate for 3 minutes. Once dried against an acrylic (Plexiglas, Perspex) surface, it is ready for the next stage.
* The third stage (usually the next day) is to expose the film positive to the sensitized gravure tissue. The positive is placed on top of the sensitized sheet of pigmented gelatin tissue. The sandwich is then exposed to ultraviolet (UV) light. A separate exposure to a very fine stochastic or hard-dot mezzotint screen is made, or alternatively an aquatint grain of asphaltum or rosin is applied and fused to the copperplate usually before the exposed gelatin tissue is adhered to the plate. The UV light travels through the positive and screen (if used) in succession, each time hardening the gelatin in proportion to the degree of light exposed to it.
* The fourth stage is to adhere the exposed tissue to the copper plate. The gelatin tissue is adhered or &quot;laid down&quot; onto the highly polished copper plate under a layer of cool water. It is squeezed into place and the excess water is wiped clear.
* Once adhered, the fifth stage is to use a hot water bath to remove the paper backing and to wash away the softer, unexposed gelatin. The remaining depth of hardened gelatin is relative to the exposure. This layer of hardened gelatin forms a contoured resist on the copper plate. The resist is dried, and the edges and back of the copper are stopped out (staged).
* The sixth stage is to etch the plate in a series of ferric chloride baths, from the densest to slightly more dilute, in steps. The density of these baths is measured in degrees Baumé. The ferric chloride migrates through the gelatin, etching the shadows and blacks under the thinnest areas first. The etching progresses through the tonal scale from dark to light as the plate is moved to successively more dilute baths of ferric chloride. The image is etched onto the copperplate by the ferric chloride, creating a gravure plate with tiny &quot;wells&quot; of varying depth to hold ink. The pattern formed by the aquatint grain or the screen exposure creates minute &quot;lands&quot; around which the etching occurs, giving the copperplate the &quot;tooth&quot; to hold ink. The &quot;wells&quot; which hold the ink vary in depth, a unique aspect of photogravure.
* The final stage is to print the cleaned plate.

===Printing the plate===
Printing a photogravure is similar to printing any other intaglio plate, especially a finely etched aquatint. A stiff, oily intaglio printing ink is applied to the whole surface of the plate with a rubber brayer, or a small, stiff squeegee, or a rolled tamper. The plate is then gently wiped with tarlatans to remove the excess ink and drive it into the recesses (wells). It is finally wiped with the fatty part of the palm of the hand in quick glancing strokes. This removes all remaining ink from the polished highlights and high points and leaves ink only in the etched recesses. After the edges are cleaned, the plate is placed on the printing bed of an intaglio press. It is covered with a sheet of dampened rag paper and then two to three layers of thin wool blankets. It is then run through the press at high pressure. The high pressure pushes the fibers of the dampened paper into the wells of the plate which then transfers the ink onto the paper thereby creating the impression. The paper is carefully peeled off the plate and placed between blotters and weighted so it will dry flat. The plate can now be re-inked for another impression or it can be cleaned for storage.

Macdermid Autotype, the last manufacturer of the gelatin pigment paper (tissue) needed to make traditional copper plate photogravure, announced the end of their production in August 2009. Since then, other manufacturers, including Bostick &amp; Sullivan, Phoenix Gravure, and others in India, Taiwan, and Japan have begun supplying gelatin pigment paper (resist tissue) to the market. These products are used by practitioners of traditional photogravure etching and by commercial printers.

==Alternatives==
===Digital direct-to-plate photogravure===
Donald Farnsworth at the art workshop Magnolia Editions developed a digital direct-to-plate photogravure process that does not use gelatin. Instead, a series of &#x27;masks&#x27; (layers of resist) are printed onto a copper plate using a flatbed UV cured acrylic printer: &quot;The flatbed printer allows us to etch a stochastic [random] dot pattern into the plate in a completely controlled, precise way ... This process is an inversion of the traditional photogravure method, where you&#x27;re etching through a sheet of gelatin, and gradually the gelatin is getting thinner and more acid reaches the plate, so the last thing that&#x27;s etched are the light tones.&quot; Instead, the digital direct-to-plate method requires that the light values be etched first; then the printer is used to lay down a new layer of ink onto the plate between acid baths, masking out the lighter values to protect them from subsequent etches. The initial mask looks like it has barely been printed; the masks grow in density until the plate eventually appears almost completely black.

In another variation of the traditional process, where the acid baths are increasingly watered down as the process unfolds, the direct-to-plate process begins with a weak bath and is gradually etched in baths which are increasingly acidic.

===Photo-polymergravure/polymer photogravure===
Photopolymer plates, usually used for relief and letterpress printing, can be used to make photogravure plates. These polymer plates, when developed, are a hard plastic, which allows for fewer impressions to be made. Some feel that they rival the quality of traditional copper plate photogravure, while others find that the lack of differential depth in the polymer coating compromises quality.

The process involves a series of exposures of the polymer plate. First, it is exposed under strong light with a random dot screen placed on top of it (called an aquatint screen in fine art printing or a stochastic screen in commercial printing). Next, the plate is exposed to a positive transparency of an image. This transparency can be a continuous tone positive on film, but is most often made as a digital &#x27;positive&#x27; (made in the same way as a digital negative) printed with an inkjet printer. The plate is then developed; for most types and brands of plates, this is done in water.

After proper drying and curing, the plate can be inked and printed. The dual exposures produce an &quot;etched&quot; polymer plate with many thousands of indentations of varying depth which hold ink, which in turn are transferred as a continuous tone image to a sheet of paper. Depending on the quality, the resulting print may look similar to or the same as those produced with the traditional photogravure process, though without the same amount of three-dimensional depth on the surface of the plate, and arguably, the print itself.

Two polymer plates commonly in use are Printight plates made by the Toyobo Corporation and Solarplates.

<doc id="753777" wikidata="Q731363" url="?curid=753777" title="Consonant gradation">
<text>Consonant gradation is a type of consonant mutation (mostly lenition but also assimilation) found in some Uralic languages, more specifically in the Finnic, Samic and Samoyedic branches. It originally arose as an allophonic alternation between open and closed syllables, but has become grammaticalised due to changes in the syllable structure of the languages affected.

==Definition==
The term &quot;consonant gradation&quot; refers to a word-medial alternation of consonants between fortis and lenis realisations. The fortis strong grade appears in historically open syllables (ending in a vowel), while the lenis weak grade appears in historically closed syllables (ending in a consonant). The exact realisation of the fortis–lenis distinction differs between the branches. In the Samic languages it was realised through fortition, specifically lengthening, in the strong grade. In the Finnic and Samoyedic languages, there was instead lenition in the weak grade. Thus, the exact realization of the contrast is not crucial.

The language groups differ in regard to their treatment sequences of a vowel followed by &quot;j&quot; or &quot;w&quot; in Proto-Uralic. In the Samic languages, the second part of these remains phonologically a consonant, and can thus close the syllable before it, triggering the weak grade. It also takes part in gradation itself, lengthening in the strong grade. In Finnic, on the other hand, these were treated as diphthongs, and were equivalent to long vowels in terms of syllable structure. Consequently, they did not close the syllable and did not affect gradation.

Consonant gradation is understood to have originally been a predictable phonological process. In all languages that retain it, however, it has evolved further to a less predictable system of consonant mutation, of morphophonological or even purely morphological nature. This is a consequence of later changes in the structure of syllables, which made closed syllables open or vice versa, without adjusting the gradation. For example, in Northern Sami, the only difference between and (&#x27;language&#x27;, nominative and genitive singular respectively) is the grade; the consonant that originally closed the syllable in the genitive form has disappeared (the same is true of Estonian and Nganasan). Even in Finnish, which is relatively conservative with respect to consonants, there are many cases of strong grades in closed syllables and weak grades in open syllables, e.g. and (&#x27;rain&#x27;, nominative and genitive singular). These, again, are the result of changes in syllable structure, with the original Proto-Finnic &quot;*sadek&quot; and &quot;*sategen&quot; following the rules more obviously. In addition, not all Finnish words that hypothetically could have gradation undergo it: for instance, the genitive form of &#x27;car&#x27; is . Thus, the occurrence of gradation is not morphologically predictable anymore, it is a property of each individual word.

==Historical connections==
There is no consensus view on the ultimate origin of consonant gradation in the Uralic languages. Three broad positions may be distinguished:
* Gradation in Finnic, Samic and Samoyedic are all connected to one another.
* Gradation in Finnic and Samic are connected; gradation in Samoyedic is an unrelated phenomenon.
* There is no connection between gradation in any of the three language groups, and the similarities are accidental.

In all three groups, consonant gradation has the same conditioning, the distinction between open and closed syllables. In this light, and in the absence of any evidence of the same system having existed in any unrelated language in the world, Helimski (1995) has argued that the latter two options should be rejected as implausible.

If a connection exists, it is also disputed what its nature may be, again allowing for three broad positions:
* Gradation is common inheritance (from either Proto-Uralic or Proto-Finno-Samic).
* Gradation is an areal phenomenon that has developed through language contact.
* Gradation has developed independently in Finnic, Samic, and Samoyedic, based on a set of common s inherited from Proto-Uralic.
The great geographical distance between the Finnic and Samic peoples on one hand, and the Nganasans on the other, leads Helimski to reject the second option of these.

==Finnic languages==
The original effect of gradation in the Finnic languages can be reconstructed as a lenition of the consonant at the beginning of a closed syllable. Lenition resulted in geminate (long) stops and affricates being shortened, and in short voiceless obstruents /*p *t *k/ becoming voiced, while short voiced obstruents /*b *d *g/ became fricatives:

* *pp → *p̆p 
* *tt → *t̆t 
* *cc → *c̆c 
* *kk → *k̆k 
* *p → *b
* *t → *d
* *k → *g
**b → *β
**d → *ð
**g → *ɣ

Only stops and affricates were affected, not other consonants. Moreover, only the last member of a consonant cluster was subject to gradation, and single stops and affricates were only affected if they were not adjacent to another obstruent. Thus, two-obstruent combinations like &quot;kt&quot;, &quot;st&quot; and &quot;tk&quot; did not undergo lenition, nor did obstruent-sonorant combinations like &quot;kl&quot; and &quot;tr&quot;. The voiced stops &quot;*b&quot; &quot;*d&quot; &quot;*g&quot; generally lenited to fricatives unless they were preceded by a nasal. This change may have occurred already in Proto-Finnic, but is not found in Livonian and Veps. The fricatives later underwent further changes, and the dental and velar fricatives have been lost altogether in most Finnic varieties.

The weakened grades of geminate consonants did not merge with the strong grades of the singleton consonants in Proto-Finnic, and still counted as geminates for the purposes of syllabification. There remained for a period an intermediate quantity, half-long *&quot;-t̆t-&quot;, which still closed the preceding syllable. Consequently, a syllable ending with a geminate in the weak grade still triggered a weak grade on the preceding syllable as well. In Finnish, the half-long consonants eventually merged with the strong-grade singleton consonants, but in most other Finnic languages, the strong-grade singletons underwent a secondary lenition which prevented this merger.

Gradation later expanded to include a pattern &quot;*s&quot; ~ &quot;*h&quot;, presumed to reflect a former pattern &quot;*s&quot; ~ &quot;*z&quot;. This type of gradation only systematically appears in cases of word-final &quot;*s&quot;, which between vowels uniformly becomes &quot;*h&quot;: Finnish &#x27;bush&#x27; has the genitive &lt; . An example is also found after a stressed syllable, however, in the exceptional monosyllabic root &quot;*mees&quot; : &quot;*meehe-&quot; &quot;man&quot;; and in a fossilized form, in the postpositions &quot;lähellä&quot; &quot;near&quot; vs. &quot;läsnä&quot; &quot;present&quot;, reflecting the adessive and the essive of a root &quot;*läse-&quot; &quot;vicinity&quot;. In cases of root-internal &quot;*s&quot;, this pattern is not normally found (e.g. Finnish &quot;pesä&quot; &#x27;nest&#x27; : plural &quot;pesät&quot;), though Votic later reintroduced a gradation pattern : here (&quot;pezäd&quot;).

Veps and Livonian have largely leveled the original gradation system, and reflect both weak and strong grades of single stops as ; this may be an archaism or a substitution of voiced stops for fricatives due to foreign influence (Russian for Veps, Latvian for Livonian). Except for northernmost Veps dialects, both grades of geminate stops are also reflected as .

===Finnish===

Finnish consonant gradation generally preserves the Proto-Finnic pattern fairly well. The conditioning of syllable structure is still visible in most cases, but it is no longer productive: gradation has become a grammatical feature.

====Historical sound changes affecting realization of weak grades====

* The weak grades *p̆p, *t̆t, *k̆k of geminates coincided with plain *p, *t, *k.
* The weak grades *mb, *nd, *ŋg of nasal+stop clusters were assimilated to geminate nasals , , (&quot;ng&quot;).
* The weak grades *lð, *rð of liquid+ clusters were similarly assimilated to geminate liquids , .
* *β merged with *ʋ (&quot;v&quot;). This may have been lost later. For example, the 3rd person singular suffix *-pi is represented by a chroneme, i.e. a lengthening of the preceding vowel; e.g. *tule-βi &#x27;s/he comes&#x27; → Old Finnish &quot;tuleu&quot; → Modern Finnish &quot;tulee&quot;.
* Between two unstressed short vowels (i.e. in the weak grade of suffixal gradation), *ð and *h were lost (but not after a diphthong, cf. illative plurals in &quot;-oihin&quot;, verbs in &quot;-oida&quot;); these may be preserved in a variety of dialects.
* After a stressed vowel, *ð remained up until the dissolution of the Finnish dialects. It was lost entirely in Eastern Finnish, while Western Finnish dialects have varying reflexes: or in multiple western dialects, in the old Tavastian dialects, in archaic Southwestern and Northwestern dialects. As the area of shrunk throughout the 17th—19th centuries, standard Finnish developed as a spelling pronunciation of orthographical &quot;d&quot;, modeled after other languages such as Swedish, German and Russian.
* *ɣ also remained until the dissolution of the Finnish dialects. It was generally lost, but in the western dialects it may have become (most widely between a liquid and , as in &quot;kylki&quot;, &quot;järki&quot; below) or (between two close labial vowels, as in &quot;puku&quot; below).
* The geminate affricate *cc : *c̆c (found in e.g. *meccä &#x27;forest&#x27;) was fronted to a dental fricative *θθ : *θ. This sound has been lost in most dialects. Widely in Eastern dialects, both grades became , leading to loss of gradation. Standard Finnish was left with an unalternating (&quot;metsä&quot; : &quot;metsän&quot;), a spelling pronunciation similar to the case of . Other patterns found include unalternating ; alternating : (coinciding with original *tt); alternating : (in Eastern dialects, coinciding with original *ht); alternating : ; and alternating ~ .

These changes have made qualitative gradation become more complex, especially in the case of &quot;k&quot;. In standard Finnish, &quot;k&quot; is the phoneme with the most possible changes. It can disappear as in &quot;jalka&quot; &#x27;foot&#x27; → &quot;jalan&quot; &#x27;foot-Gen&#x27;, or: 

/j/ has been lost in this position in Southeastern Tavastian, Northern Bothnian and Eastern dialects, resulting in &quot;kurki&quot; (crane) : &quot;kuren&quot; (crane&#x27;s) instead of the standard form &quot;kurjen&quot;.

Short &quot;t&quot; also has developed more complex gradation due to various assimilations. Patterns include &quot;t&quot; : &quot;d&quot; (tietää : tiedän), &quot;rt&quot; : &quot;rr&quot; (kertoa : kerron), &quot;lt&quot; : &quot;ll&quot; (pelto : pellon), and &quot;nt&quot; ~ &quot;nn&quot; (antaa ~ annan).

Alternation patterns for &quot;p&quot; include &quot;p&quot; : &quot;v&quot; (tapa : tavan) and &quot;mp&quot; : &quot;mm&quot; (lampi : lammen).

====Analogical extension of gradation====

The consonant clusters and were, comprising two obstruents, not originally subject to gradation (as is still the case for similar clusters such as , , ). However, gradation pairs &quot;ht : *hð&quot; and &quot;hk : *hɣ&quot; were at one point introduced. The first of these patterns remains common in modern Finnish, e.g. &quot;vahti : vahdit&quot; &quot;. The second is only found in a limited number of words, e.g. &quot;pohje : pohkeet&quot; &#x27;calf : calves&#x27;, but &quot;rahka : rahkat&quot; &quot;. Usage varies for some words with , e.g. for the plural of &quot;nahka&quot; &#x27;leather, hide&#x27;, both &quot;nahat&quot; and &quot;nahkat&quot; are acceptable.

Quantitative consonant gradation has expanded to include in addition to the pairs &quot;kk : k&quot;, &quot;pp : p&quot;, &quot;tt : t&quot;, also &quot;gg : g&quot; and &quot;bb : b&quot; (but not &quot;dd : d&quot;) in a number of recent loanwords, such as &#x27;to blog&#x27;; &#x27;to lobby&#x27;.

====Historical sound changes affecting conditions of gradation====

One important change was the loss of word-final *-k and *-h early on in the history of Finnish. This resulted in many open syllables with weak grades. In particular, the majority of nouns ending in &quot;-e&quot; are affected by this, with a weak grade in the nominative form. The imperative form of verbs also ended in a now-lost &quot;-k&quot;. For examples, &quot;side&quot; &#x27;bandage&#x27;, from *&quot;siðe&quot;, earlier *&quot;siðek&quot; (cf. Veps &quot;sideg&quot;, Eastern Votic &quot;sidõg&quot;); &#x27;to get&#x27; → &quot;hae!&quot; &#x27;get! (imp.)&#x27; from *&quot;haɣe&quot;, earlier *&quot;haɣek&quot;. Traces of the original syllable closure can be seen in sandhi effects: these classes of words can still be analyzed to contain the assimilative word-final &#x27;consonant&#x27; ˣ, realized as lengthening of the next word&#x27;s initial consonant. Therefore, &quot;hae side varastosta&quot; &#x27;get a bandage from storage!&#x27; is pronounced , where the weak grades indeed occur in closed syllables.

The loss of &quot;-k&quot; combined with loss of &quot;d&quot; gave rise to the modern Finnish infinitive ending, which was historically *&quot;-tak/täk&quot;. The final *&quot;-k&quot; triggered gradation, so that the ending normally became *&quot;-dak/däk&quot;. In turn, following the loss of &quot;d&quot; between unstressed vowels, and the loss of final *&quot;-k&quot; only *&quot;-aˣ/äˣ&quot; remained. Thus, (originally *) has only &quot;-a&quot; as the &quot;d&quot; was lost. But in verbs like &quot;juo-da&quot; &#x27;to drink&#x27; the /d/ remained since it followed a stressed syllable. In the case of verbs like &quot;tulla&quot; &#x27;to come&#x27;, the earlier form was *&quot;tul-ðak&quot;, but the &quot;*ð&quot; was assimilated to the /l/ according to the patterns described above. The original strong grade was preserved in verbs like &quot;hais-ta&quot; &#x27;to stink&#x27; since gradation did not take place when a consonant followed /s/.

The situation appears differently in the many verbs ending in &quot;-ata/ätä&quot;. These verbs seem to have preserved the strong grade in the infinitive ending, going counter to the rules of gradation. However, historically it is in fact a weak grade: the stem of the verb itself ended in *&quot;-at/ät-&quot;, and this is still visible in the 3rd person imperative ending &quot;-atkoon/ätköön&quot;. Thus, when combined with the infinitive ending, the verb ended in *&quot;-attak/ättäk&quot; (similar to the origin of the &quot;-ton/tön&quot; suffix described above). The &quot;-k&quot; then weakened the consonant from a geminate *&quot;-tt-&quot; to a single *&quot;-t-&quot;, and later loss of &quot;-k&quot; resulted in the final form &quot;-ata/ätä&quot;. However, even though this is now a single consonant, it was originally a geminate and therefore triggers the weak grade on the syllable before it. So whereas the infinitive may be for example &quot;hypätä&quot; &#x27;to jump&#x27;, its original stem was *&quot;hyppät-&quot;, as can be seen in the first-person singular form &quot;hyppään&quot; &#x27;I jump&#x27;, from earlier *&quot;hyppäðen&quot; with loss of &quot;*-ð-&quot;.

An opposite effect was caused by the loss of *&quot;h&quot; and *&quot;ð&quot; between unstressed vowels. Loss of &quot;h&quot; affected nouns and adjectives ending in *&quot;-s&quot; or *&quot;-h&quot;, such as &quot;kuningas&quot; &#x27;king&#x27;. In the nominative, this &quot;-s&quot; appeared as usual, and as the preceding syllable was closed, the weak grade &quot;ng&quot; appeared. But when a case ending such as the genitive was added, the result was originally *&quot;kuninkasen&quot;, which was then weakened to *&quot;kuninkahen&quot;, and the loss of &quot;-h-&quot; then resulted in the modern form &quot;kuninkaan&quot;. The intermediate steps are seen in &quot;mies&quot; &#x27;man&#x27;. Here, following a stressed syllable, the &quot;-h-&quot; was not lost, so that its genitive is &quot;miehen&quot;.

Similar changes affected the illative ending, which was &quot;-hVn&quot; where V was the same as the vowel preceding the ending. The &quot;h&quot; is preserved after stressed syllables, as in &quot;maahan&quot; &#x27;into the land&#x27; (from &quot;maa&quot;), but lost otherwise as in &quot;kotiin&quot; &#x27;into the home&#x27; (from earlier *&quot;kotihin&quot;, from &quot;koti&quot;). This explains why &quot;kotiin&quot; retains a strong grade even though a closed syllable follows it. The Pohjanmaa dialect of Finnish retains the &quot;-h-&quot;, however.

Words that now end in &quot;-e&quot; are in fact very similar to those ending in &quot;-s&quot;. These originally ended with &quot;-k&quot; or &quot;-h&quot; so that the nominative ended in a consonant just as &quot;kuningas&quot; and therefore the preceding syllable was in the weak grade. But after an ending was added, the weak grade &quot;g&quot; appeared, which eventually disappeared just as &quot;h&quot; did.

====Analogical limitation of gradation====
While syllabic gradation remains generally productive, the distortions of its original phonetic conditions have left it essentially a morphologically conditioned process. This is particularly visible in forms that display a strong grade where a weak would be historically expected, or vice versa. Possessive suffixes, in particular, are always preceded by the strong grade, even if the suffix may cause the syllable to be closed. For example, &#x27;our bed&#x27; is &quot;sänkymme&quot;, not &quot;ˣsängymme&quot;.

Strong grades may also be found in closed syllables in contractions such as &quot;jotta en&quot; → &quot;jotten&quot;.

Several recent loans and coinages with simple are also left entirely outside of gradation, e.g. &quot;auto&quot; (: &quot;auton&quot;) &#x27;car&#x27;, &quot;eka&quot; (: &quot;ekan&quot;) &#x27;first&#x27;, &quot;muki&quot; (: &quot;mukin&quot;) &#x27;mug&#x27;, &quot;peti&quot; (: &quot;petin&quot;, sometimes &quot;pedin&quot; ) &#x27;bed&#x27;, &quot;söpö&quot; (: &quot;söpön&quot;) &#x27;cute&#x27;. A number of proper names such as Alepa, Arto, Malta, Marko belong in this class as well.

Suffixal gradation has been largely lost, usually in favor of the weak grade. While the partitive plurals of &quot;kana&quot; &#x27;hen&#x27; and &quot;lakana&quot; &#x27;bedsheet&#x27; still show distinct treatment of the original &quot;*-ta&quot; (&quot;kanoja&quot;, &quot;lakanoita&quot;), the partitive singulars in modern Finnish both have the weak grade (&quot;kanaa&quot;, &quot;lakanaa&quot;), although in several dialects of older Finnish the form &quot;lakanata&quot; occurred for the latter. Similarly the participle ending &quot;*-pa&quot; is now uniformly &quot;-va&quot;, even after stressed syllables; e.g. &quot;syö-vä&quot; &#x27;eating&#x27;, &quot;voi-va&quot; &#x27;being able&#x27;. (The original forms may remain in diverged sense or fossilized derivatives: &quot;syöpä&quot; &#x27;cancer&#x27;, &quot;kaikki-voipa&quot; &#x27;almighty&#x27;.)

===Karelian===

Karelian consonant gradation is quite similar to Finnish: *β *ð *ɣ have been lost in a fashion essentially identical to Eastern Finnish (and may have occurred in the common ancestor of the two), with the exception that assimilation rather than loss has occurred also for *lɣ and *rɣ. E.g. the plural of &quot;jalka&quot; &#x27;foot&#x27; is &quot;jallat&quot;, contrasting with &quot;jalat&quot; in Finnish and &quot;jalad&quot; in Estonian.

Karelian still includes some gradation pairs which Finnish does not. The consonants undergo consonant gradation when following a coronal obstruent : &quot;muistua&quot; &#x27;to remember&#x27; → &quot;muissan&quot; &#x27;I remember&#x27;, &quot;matka&quot; → &quot;matan&quot; &#x27;trip&#x27; (nom. → gen.). This development may be by analogy of the corresponding liquid clusters. On the other hand, some Karelian dialects (such as Livvi or Olonets) do not allow for gradation in clusters beginning on nasals. Thus, the Olonets Karelian equivalent of Finnish &quot;vanhemmat&quot; (cf. &quot;vanhempi&quot; &#x27;older&#x27;) is &quot;vahnembat&quot;.

The Karelian phoneme inventory also includes the affricate (represented in the orthography as &quot;č&quot;), which may be found geminated and is such subject to quantitative gradation: &quot;meččä&quot; &#x27;forest&#x27; → &quot;mečäššä&quot; &#x27;in (the) forest&#x27;.

===Votic===
Votic has two quantities for consonants and vowels, which basically match up with the Finnish counterparts. The Votic phoneme inventory includes a set of fully voiced stops, which Paul Ariste (&quot;A Grammar of the Votic Language&quot;) describes as being the same as in Russian. Thus, in addition to quantitative alternations between and , Votic also has a system of qualitative alternations in which the distinguishing feature is &quot;voicing&quot;, and so the voiceless stops are known to alternate with .

As in Estonian, Karelian, and Eastern dialects of Finnish, the weak grade *ð of in inherited vocabulary has been lost or assimilated to adjacent sounds in Votic; the weak grade *β of has similarly become , or assimilated to in the cluster . However, the weak grade of survives, as before a back vowel or before a front vowel.

A noticeable feature of Votic is that gradation has been extended to several consonant clusters that were not originally affected. As in Finnish, this includes the clusters and with a voicing-neutral first member, but also further clusters, even several ones introduced only in Russian loans.

The alternations involving the voiced affricate dž are only found in the Eastern dialects. In the Western dialects, there are several possible weak grade counterparts of tš:

Further minor variation in these gradation patterns was found down to the level of individual villages.

Votic also has a number of alternations between continuants which are short in the &#x27;weak&#x27; grade, and geminates in the &#x27;strong&#x27; grade (&quot;kassā&quot; &#x27;to sprinkle/water&#x27; vs. &quot;kasan&quot; &#x27;I sprinkle/water&#x27;), as well as more voicing alternations between palatalized stops, and the alternations between nasal+consonant~nasal+chroneme found in Finnish. Votic also includes alternations in which the &#x27;strong&#x27; grade is represented by a short consonant, while the &#x27;weak&#x27; grade is represented by a geminate: &quot;ritõlõn&quot; vs. &quot;riďďõlla&quot;. For comparison, the Finnish equivalents of these is &quot;riitelen&quot; &#x27;I quarrel&#x27; vs. &quot;riidellä&quot; &#x27;to quarrel&#x27;.

===Estonian===

Though otherwise closely related to Votic, consonant gradation in Estonian is quite different from the other Finnic languages. One extremely important difference is the existence of three grades of consonants (alternations like strong grade &quot;pada&quot; &#x27;pot (nom.)&#x27;, weak grade &quot;paja&quot; &#x27;pot (gen.)&#x27;, overlong grade &quot;patta&quot; &#x27;pot (ill.)&#x27;). This can be said to generally correlate with the existence of three degrees of consonant length (e.g. &quot;d&quot;, &quot;t&quot;, and &quot;tt&quot;), but since the alternation &quot;d&quot; ~ &quot;t&quot; occurs only after heavy syllables, and the alternations &quot;d&quot; ~ &quot;tt&quot; and &quot;t&quot; ~ &quot;tt&quot; occur only after light syllables, there is no single paradigm that has this simple alternation. However, weak grades like &quot;v&quot;, &quot;j&quot;, or &quot;∅&quot; that alternate with stops like &quot;b&quot;, &quot;d&quot;, or &quot;g&quot; originate from the weak grade of these stops, and these may still synchronically alternate with the over-long grades (&quot;pp&quot;, &quot;tt&quot;, &quot;kk&quot;) within the same paradigm, giving paradigms with three underlying grades.

Another extremely important feature of Estonian gradation is that, due to the greater loss of word-final segments (both consonants and vowels), the Estonian gradation is an almost entirely opaque process, where the consonant grade (short, long, or overlong) must be listed for each class of wordform. So, for example, &#x27;embrace&#x27; has the same form for all cases (e.g. genitive ), while &quot;hammas&quot; &#x27;tooth&#x27; has weak grade &quot;mm&quot; in the nominative &quot;hammas&quot; and partitive &quot;hammast&quot;, but strong form &quot;mb&quot; in the genitive &quot;hamba&quot; and all other cases of the singular. There is a large number of cases in which inflectional endings are identical except for how they affect the consonant grade, e.g. &quot;leht&quot; &#x27;leaf&#x27; belongs to a declension class in which both the genitive and the partitive singular are formed by adding &quot;-e&quot;, but the genitive takes the weak form (&quot;leh-e&quot;), while the partitive takes the strong form (&quot;leht-e&quot;). In the end, the types of generalizations that can be made are that some inflectional categories always take the strong form (e.g. partitive plural, &quot;-ma&quot; infinitive), some always take the weak form (e.g. &quot;-tud&quot; participle), some forms may take the overlong form (some partitive singulars, short illative singular), while other inflectional categories are underdetermined for whether they occur with weak or strong grade. In this last case, within a paradigm some forms are constrained to have the same grade and others are constrained to have the opposite grade; thus all present tense forms for the same verb have the same grade, though some verbs have strong (&quot;hakkan&quot; &#x27;I begin&#x27;, &quot;hakkad&quot; &#x27;you begin&#x27;, etc.) and others have weak ( &#x27;I read&#x27;, , &#x27;you read&#x27;, etc.), and the &quot;-da&quot; infinitive has the opposite grade from the present (&quot;hakata&quot; &#x27;to begin&#x27;, &quot;lugeda&quot; &#x27;to read&#x27;).

The system of gradation has also expanded to include gradation of all consonant clusters and geminate consonants (generally quantitative), when occurring after short vowels, and vowel gradation between long and overlong vowels, although these are not written except for the distinction between voiceless stops and geminate voiceless stops (e.g. overlong strong grade &quot;tt&quot; with weak grade &quot;t&quot;). E.g. &quot;linn&quot; , &#x27;city (nom.)&#x27; vs. &quot;linna&quot; &#x27;city (gen.)&#x27;. In consonant clusters, in the strong grade the first consonant is lengthened, e.g. &quot;must&quot; , &#x27;black (nom.)&#x27; vs. &quot;musta&quot; &#x27;black (gen.)&#x27;. Before single consonants, long vowels and diphthongs also become overlong in strong forms and remain merely long in weak forms, e.g. &quot;kool&quot; , &#x27;school (nom.)&#x27; vs. &quot;kooli&quot; &#x27;school (gen.)&#x27;.

==Samic languages==
Gradation was present in Proto-Samic, and is inherited in most Samic languages. It is different from the gradation found in the Finnic languages in some important aspects:
* Gradation applies to all consonants, even consonant clusters.
* Geminate stops and affricates were realised with preaspiration in Proto-Samic, and were thus phonetically distinct from singletons in more than length alone.
* Rather than featuring lenition in the weak grade, the weak grade generally reflects the original consonant. Instead, it is the strong grade that was modified: single consonants were lengthened into half-long in the strong grade, geminate consonants were lengthened to overlong.
* It only applies in consonants at the end of a stressed syllable; consonants following unstressed syllables remain unlengthened and do not show grade alternations.

Similar to the cases of Veps and Livonian within Finnic, the Southern Sami language at the westernmost end of the Sami language continuum has lost all gradation. In the remaining Sami languages, the strong grade of the singletons merged with the weak grade of geminates, creating a three-quantity distinction between short, long and overlong consonants. In Kildin and Ter Sami, this merger did not affect stops and affricates, due to the additional preaspiration found on original geminates. In the others, the merger affected stops and affricates as well, with the strong grade of singletons receiving secondary preaspiration.

In the Western Samic languages, geminate nasals became pre-stopped, which affected the strong grade of singletons as well (outside Southern Sami) due to the historical merger of these grades. In the languages in closest contact to Finnic (Northern, Inari and Skolt), a number of developments towards the situation in Finnish and Karelian have occurred, such as the change of unlengthened &quot;*t&quot; to .

===Northern Sami===

Northern Sami has a system of three phonological lengths for consonants, and thus has extensive sets of alternations. Quantity 3 is represented as lengthening of the coda part of a geminate or cluster, which is absent in quantity 2. Quantity 1 consists of only an onset consonant, with the preceding syllable having no coda. In addition, most dialects of Northern Sami feature &quot;coda maximisation&quot;, which geminates the last member of a cluster in various environments (most commonly in two-consonant clusters of quantity 2, in which the first member is voiced).

Most sonorants and fricatives are only subject to quantitative gradation, but nasals, stops, affricates and the glide are subject to both quantitative and qualitative changes. Some words alternate between three grades, though not all words do. Note that the following apostrophe marking the over-long grade is not used in the official orthography, although it is generally found in dictionaries.

Some gradation triads include the following:

==Samoyedic languages==

===Nganasan===

Nganasan, alone of the Samoyedic languages (or indeed any Uralic languages east of Finnic), shows systematic qualitative gradation of stops and fricatives. Gradation occurs in intervocalic position as well as in consonant clusters consisting of a nasal and a stop. Note that /h/ and /ŋh/ descend from historical /p/ and /mp/, respectively. Examples of Nganasan consonant gradation can be seen in the table below. The first form given is always the nominative singular, the latter the genitive singular (which was marked in Proto-Samoyedic by the suffix *&quot;-n&quot;, resulting in a closed syllable).

The original conditions of the Nganasan gradation can be shown to be identical to gradation in Finnic and Samic; that is, radical/syllabic gradation according to syllable closure, and suffixal/rhythmic gradation according to a syllable being of odd or even number, with rhythmic gradation particularly well-preserved.

===Selkup===
A limited form of consonant gradation is found in the Ket dialect of Selkup. In certain environments, geminate stops can alternate with short (allophonically voiced) ones, under the usual conditions for radical gradation. E.g.:

<doc id="753781" wikidata="Q818735" url="?curid=753781" title="Wells Fargo Center (Philadelphia)">
<text>Wells Fargo Center is a multi-purpose indoor arena located in Philadelphia. It serves as the home of the Philadelphia Flyers of the National Hockey League (NHL), the Philadelphia 76ers of the National Basketball Association (NBA), and the Philadelphia Wings of the National Lacrosse League (NLL). The arena lies at the southwest corner of the South Philadelphia Sports Complex, which includes Lincoln Financial Field, Citizens Bank Park, and Xfinity Live!.

Wells Fargo Center, originally called Spectrum II, was completed in 1996 to replace the Spectrum as the home arena of the 76ers and Flyers, on the former site of John F. Kennedy Stadium at a cost of $210 million, largely privately financed (though the city and state helped to pay for the local infrastructure). It is owned by Comcast Spectacor, which also owns the Flyers, and is operated by its arena-management subsidiary, Global Spectrum. Since opening, it has been known by a number of different names through naming rights deals and bank mergers, including CoreStates Center from 1996 to 1998, First Union Center from 1998 to 2003, and Wachovia Center from 2003 to 2010. Since 2010, naming rights have been held by financial services company Wells Fargo, after their acquisition of Wachovia. CoreStates Financial Corporation was acquired by First Union, which later also purchased Wachovia National Bank to rename itself Wachovia Corporation; the combined company was acquired by Wells Fargo in 2008.

In addition to hosting home games for its main tenants, the arena has been the site of a number of other notable athletic events including games of the 1997 and 2010 Stanley Cup Finals, three games of the 2001 NBA Finals, and various collegiate events for the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA). Wells Fargo Center has hosted two political conventions, hosting the 2000 Republican National Convention and 2016 Democratic National Convention. The arena is a regular venue for concerts and WWE events. The arena has a concert seating capacity of 21,000 seated and at least 21,500 standing.

On January 12, 2025, Comcast Spectacor, Harris Blitzer Sports &amp; Entertainment and the City of Philadelphia announced a deal to replace the Wells Fargo Center with a new $1.3 billion privately financed arena to open by 2031. Comcast Spectacor and Harris Blitzer Sports &amp; Entertainment will jointly own the new arena.

==Naming rights==
Prior to its construction, the proposed arena was tentatively called &quot;Spectrum II&quot;. Wells Fargo Center was originally named for CoreStates Financial Corporation, which agreed to pay $40 million over 21 years for the naming rights, with additional terms to be settled later for an additional eight-year period at the end of the contract.

The contract went through multiple hands due to various bank mergers; first by First Union in 1998, Wachovia in 2003, and currently by Wells Fargo since July 2010. Installation of the new Wells Fargo Center branding began on July 27, 2010, with the removal of the Wachovia Center signage, followed by the installation of the new Wells Fargo Center signage. Work was completed in September 2010.

During the 2015–16 NBA season for a short time, the 76ers ceased recognizing Wells Fargo&#x27;s naming rights and referred to the facility exclusively as &quot;The Center&quot;, as the institution was not a sponsor of the team. The Wells Fargo Center logo decal which sat on the 76ers court was in the most minimal text discernible by television cameras, colored in white to blend in with the floor. (Reportedly, 76ers CEO Scott O&#x27;Neil&#x27;s first idea was to color it with clear-coat paint only visible with UV blacklighting showing the logo during the opening of Sixers games when the arena lights were drawn down; however, the team, after discussion with their lawyers, elected not to do so.) With the start of the new year in January 2016 with input from Comcast Spectacor, the logo decal was enlarged and repainted in black. The 76ers then signed a non-signage sponsorship agreement with Firstrust Bank as their official banking sponsor.

On July 24, 2024, Wells Fargo announced that it would not renew its naming rights deal with Comcast Spectacor, the owner of the arena, once it expires in August 2025, ending a 29-year relationship that dates back to one of company&#x27;s predecessors, CoreStates, sponsoring the arena when it first opened in 1996.

==Facilities==

Wells Fargo Center officially seats 21,000 for NBA and NCAA basketball and 19,173 for NHL hockey and indoor NLL lacrosse. With additional standing-room admissions available in luxury and club-box suites, the total paid capacity increases. Wells Fargo Center has 126 luxury suites, 1,880 club-box seats, and a variety of restaurants and clubs (both public and private) available for use by patrons. In addition, the offices, studios, and production facilities of NBC Sports Philadelphia are all located in the facility.

On June 10, 2005, the Wachovia Center set a record for the highest attendance for an indoor hockey game in the commonwealth of Pennsylvania (20,103) when the Philadelphia Phantoms won Game 4 of the 2005 Calder Cup Finals over the Chicago Wolves to win the Calder Cup. The attendance record was broken on June 9, 2010, as the Wachovia Center set another attendance record of 20,327 for Game 6 of the 2010 Stanley Cup Finals; the Flyers lost to the Chicago Blackhawks in overtime, which gave Chicago its first Stanley Cup since . Wells Fargo Center also set a record for the highest attendances for a college basketball game in the commonwealth of Pennsylvania on January 29, 2017, when Villanova played and defeated Virginia before a crowd of 20,907.

On August 1, 2006, Comcast Spectacor announced it would install a new center-hung scoreboard to replace the original one made by Daktronics. The new scoreboard, manufactured by ANC Sports, is similar to other scoreboards in new NBA &amp; NHL arenas. An additional linear LED display lining the entire arena was also installed between the suite and mezzanine levels. Other renovations for the Wachovia Center&#x27;s ten-year anniversary included upgrading the suites with more flat screen HDTV&#x27;s, as well as changing ticket providers from Ticketmaster to New Era Tickets, which is owned by Comcast Spectacor.

The public address (PA) announcer at Wells Fargo Center for Flyers games is Lou Nolan, who moved with the team from the Spectrum, where he worked since 1972. Matt Cord is the PA announcer for 76ers games. Jim Bachman is the PA announcer for Villanova basketball games. Vinnie Caligiuri was the PA announcer for the Philadelphia Soul during their tenure. Kevin Casey handled PA duties for the original Philadelphia Wings during their tenure. Marc Farzetta is the PA announcer for the current Philadelphia Wings.

Wells Fargo Center continued further renovations as part of a $265 million &quot;Transformation 2020&quot; initiative. It debuted a new kinetic 4K-resolution scoreboard in September 2019 also by ANC Sports, which features two main arrays of outside displays that can expand outwards to a width of , and two &quot;crown&quot; panels that can be raised and lowered as part of sequences. The arena also unveiled a new premium area for selected ticketholders known as the &quot;Center City Club&quot;, and—as part of a partnership with Rivers Casino Philadelphia—two sportsbook lounges open to all visitors, which will feature a bar and seating areas, televisions and odds boards, and Rivers Casino ambassadors promoting use of the casino&#x27;s sports betting app.

The arena also announced the New City Terrace, a revamp of the standing room deck into a &quot;Assembly Room&quot; (inspired by Independence Hall), with bars and eateries, fireplaces, and communal areas. The area is designed to provide a &quot;first-class experience at an accessible price point&quot;; the arena&#x27;s cheapest tickets will feature access to the level.

==Concerts==
* On August 12, 1996, a private concert by Ray Charles was the first event at the CoreStates Center, with a crowd of nearly 12,000. Each spectator was given a commemorative key acknowledging they helped &quot;open the arena&quot;. The inaugural concert, on September 2, 1996, featured Oasis, with The Manic Street Preachers and Screaming Trees, before an estimated crowd of 12,000. Wells Fargo Center has since held other concerts by many famous artists.
* On December 6, 2002, hard rock band Guns N&#x27; Roses was scheduled to perform there on its Chinese Democracy Tour. The opening bands CKY and Mix Master Mike performed, but Guns N&#x27; Roses never appeared, fueling a riot in the arena and causing about $30,000 to $40,000 in damage. No reason was ever given for the non-appearance by Guns N&#x27; Roses, other than the public announcement that one of the band members was ill.
* In 2006, Billy Joel set a record when he sold-out his 18th Wachovia Center concert.
* In 2016, American rock band Pearl Jam played two shows, during which they were awarded a banner for ten sell out shows. This then prompted the band on the second night to play their debut album &quot;Ten&quot; from start to finish.

In addition, hanging from the rafters of Wells Fargo Center are three banners in the orange and black colors of the Flyers honoring Pearl Jam&#x27;s 10, Billy Joel&#x27;s 48 Philadelphia sellouts and Bruce Springsteen&#x27;s 56 Philadelphia sellouts respectively.

<doc id="753785" wikidata="Q5501901" url="?curid=753785" title="French Revolution from the summer of 1790 to the establishment of the Legislative Assembly">
<text>The [[French Revolution]] was a period in the history of France covering the years 1789 to 1799, in which Republicans overthrew the Bourbon monarchy and the Roman Catholic Church perforce underwent radical restructuring. This article covers a period of time slightly longer than a year, from 14 July 1790, the first anniversary of the storming of the Bastille, to the establishment of the Legislative Assembly on 1 October 1791.

This article is a continuation of the abolition of feudalism in France, which covers the period of the Revolution from the abolition of feudalism to the Civil Constitution of the Clergy. Please see that article for background and historical context.

==From the anniversary of the Bastille to the death of Mirabeau==
===The anniversary of the Bastille===

The National Constituent Assembly declared a celebration for 14 July 1790 on the Champ de Mars. By way of prelude to this patriotic fête, on 20 June, the Assembly, at the urging of the popular members of the nobility, abolished all titles, armorial bearings, liveries and orders of knighthood, destroying the symbolic paraphernalia of the &quot;ancien régime&quot;. This further alienated the more conservative nobles, and added to the ranks of the &quot;émigrés&quot;.

On the 14th, Talleyrand performed a mass; participants swore an oath of &quot;fidelity to the nation, the law, and the king&quot;; the king and the royal family actively participated in the celebrations, which went on for several days.

===The Constituent Assembly continues===
The members of the Estates-General had originally been elected to serve for a single year. By the Tennis Court Oath, the &quot;communes&quot; (representatives of the Third Estate) had bound themselves to meet continuously until France had a constitution, a goal which had not yet been achieved in the course of a year. Right-wing elements, such as the abbé Jean-Sifrein Maury, argued for a new election—by each of the three estates, separately—hoping that the events of the last year would encourage far more conservative representatives of at least the first two estates. Isaac le Chapelier described this at the time as &quot;the hope of those who wish to see liberty and the constitution perish.&quot; Maury responded by characterizing the effort to avoid an election as &quot;calculated to limit the rights of the people over their representatives.&quot; However, Mirabeau carried the day, asserting that the status of the Assembly had fundamentally changed, and that no new election would take place before completing the constitution: &quot;It is asked how long the deputies of the people have been a national convention? I answer, from the day when, finding the door of their session-house surrounded by soldiers, they went and assembled where they could, and swore to perish rather than betray or abandon the rights of the nation... Whatever powers we may have exercised, our efforts and labours have rendered them legitimate...&quot;

===Intrigues===
In late 1790, several small counter-revolutionary uprisings broke out and efforts took place to turn all or part of the army against the revolution. These uniformly failed. The court, in Mignet&#x27;s words &quot;encouraged every anti-revolutionary enterprise and avowed none&quot;, while negotiating with Mirabeau for more favorable treatment under a constitution, if one could not be prevented.

By this time, the royal family were living in the Tuileries, under the generally benevolent guardianship of Lafayette and his National Guards. These guards protected them from occasional popular outbursts, but also fended off several efforts by royalists to spirit them out of Paris.

===Turmoil in the military===
The army faced considerable internal turmoil: in Nancy, in August 1790, three regiments, those of , Maître-de-camp, and the King&#x27;s own regiment, rebelled against their chiefs. General Bouillé successfully put down the rebellion, which added to his (accurate) reputation for counter-revolutionary sympathies.

Under the new military code promotion depended on seniority and proven competence, rather than on nobility. In one detrimental consequence of this generally sound policy, large portions of the existing officer corps, seeing that they would no longer stand to gain promotion, left the army, and even the country, and attempted to stir up international diplomatic and even military opposition to the new, more democratic order. Others (such as Bouillé) stayed inside the military, but remained insincere in their oaths to the new regime, and became a counter-revolutionary threat from within.

===Rise of the Clubs===

This same period saw an increase of the importance of political &quot;clubs&quot; in French politics. Foremost among these was the Jacobin Club. While the Assembly met in Versailles, it was an unnamed group of Breton deputies to propose legislation. With the move to Paris, the group acquired a name and expanded its membership, first to other like-minded members of the Assembly, then to members of the general populace in Paris, and later throughout France. According to the 1911 Encyclopædia Britannica, by 10 August 1790 there were already one hundred and fifty-two affiliated clubs. Despite the Jacobins&#x27; later prominence during the Reign of Terror, in the summer and fall of 1790 they were still well within the mainstream of the popular or national party.

As the Jacobins became a broad popular organization, some of its founders abandoned it to form the alternative Club of 1789. Key members of this club included abbé Sieyès, Chapelier, Lafayette, and La Rochefoucauld. Mirabeau was active in both the Jacobins and the Club of 1789.

Royalists established first the short-lived Club des Impartiaux and later the Club Monarchique. They attempted unsuccessfully to curry public favor by distributing bread; nonetheless, they were the frequent target of protests and even riots, and were finally closed down by the Paris municipal authorities in January 1791.

===Work on a constitution continues===
Amidst these intrigues, the Assembly continued to work on developing a constitution. A new judicial organization made all magistracies temporary and independent of the throne. The legislators abolished hereditary offices, except for the monarchy itself. Jury trials started for criminal cases. The king would have the unique power to propose war, with the legislature then deciding whether to declare war.

On 31 October 1790 the Assembly abolished all internal trade barriers. Prior to that date, goods being shipped around France had to pass through various customs posts, often corresponding to the way territories had accreted to the French crown. After that date, all of France formed a single unit from the point of view of customs barriers.

The d&#x27;Allarde Law of 2 March 1791 suppressed guilds and masterships and freed any individual to practice a trade through the purchase of a license. The Le Chapelier Law of 14 June 1791 proscribed workers&#x27; organizations and banned strikes: the rising professionals, merchants and owners of industry had overthrown the power of the aristocracy on their own behalf, not that of their workers.

===Death of Mirabeau===
Mirabeau died 2 April 1791. In Mignet&#x27;s words, &quot;No one succeeded him in power and popularity.&quot; Historians argue whether his death was a major factor in the rise of factionalism and the decline of a consensus among the revolutionaries, or whether it merely coincided with these events, but the breakdown of that consensus is as clear as the death of the man.

Shortly before Mirabeau&#x27;s death the Assembly considered, for the first time, legislation against the &quot;émigrés&quot;. Because nobles were leaving France and intriguing against the State, some deputies wished to declare &quot;civil death&quot; for all who left France. The debate pitted the safety of the state against the liberty of individuals to leave. Mirabeau carried the day against the measure, which he referred to as &quot;worthy of being placed in the code of
Draco.&quot; However, before the end of the year, the new French Legislative Assembly would adopt this &quot;draconian&quot; measure.

==The Flight to Varennes==
For some time, the revolutionaries had feared that the royal family would attempt to escape Paris. When Louis tried to leave the Tuileries for Saint-Cloud at Easter 1791, in order to enjoy the ministrations of a nonjuring priest, they would not let him budge.

Encouraged by the &quot;émigrés&quot; to believe that revolutionary France was without effective military means of defense, representatives of Austria, Switzerland, Sardinia, and Spain, met at Mantua and on 20 May 1791 reached a secret agreement to go to war against France, supposedly on behalf of King Louis. However, when the plan was conveyed to the king, he rejected this potentially treacherous source of aid, casting his lot instead with General Bouillé, who condemned both the emigration and the Assembly, and promised him refuge and support in his camp at Montmédy.

On the night of 20 June 1791 the royal family fled the Tuileries. A carriage took them on the road to Châlons aiming towards Montmedy.

In the morning, their disappearance was discovered. Despite an angry crowd, the Assembly soon established their control of the situation, seizing executive power and obtaining oaths from the troops to the Assembly (rather than to the king).

The overconfident king had the imprudence to show himself, and was recognised and arrested at Varennes late on the 21st, and brought back to Paris under guard.

Pétion, Latour-Maubourg, and Barnave, representing the Assembly, met the royal family at Épernay and returned with them. From this time, Barnave became a counsellor and supporter of the royal family.

When they reached Paris, the crowd was silent. The Assembly provisionally suspended the king and kept him and Queen Marie Antoinette under guard.

==The last days of the National Constituent Assembly==
===Republicanism and the Champ de Mars massacre===

From this point forward, the possibility not only of the forced abdication of this particular king but of the establishment of a republic entered the political discourse. To fend this off, a compromise was reached, but one that left Louis XVI little more than a figurehead: he was made to swear an oath to the constitution and it was decreed that he would be considered as abdicating, &quot;de facto&quot;, if he retracted the oath or if he headed an army for the purpose of making war upon the nation, or permitted any one to do so in his name. In case of such a &quot;de facto&quot; abdication, he would become a simple citizen, with no immunity from prosecution.

Jacques Pierre Brissot drafted a petition, denying the competency of the Assembly, appealing to the sovereignty of the nation, insisting that in the eyes of the nation Louis XVI was deposed since his flight, and demanding that if the monarchy were to continue it should be under a different monarch. On 17 July an immense crowd gathered at the altar of the country in the Champ de Mars to sign the petition. The Assembly called for the municipal authorities to &quot;preserve the public tranquility.&quot; Under Lafayette&#x27;s command, the National Guard at first dispersed the crowd without bloodshed, but the crowd re-formed, with Georges Danton and Camille Desmoulins giving fiery speeches. This time, when Lafayette and mayor Jean-Sylvain Bailly ordered the crowd to disperse, they were answered with a barrage of stones. Lafayette ordered his men to fire in the air; the crowd did not back down; Lafayette ordered his men to fire into the crowd. Reports on the number killed vary, but it may have been as many as fifty people. It has been debated upon, but many believe that the 
king caused this massacre. A note written in his handwriting communicated to Lafayette that if 
citizens arise, dispose of them.

In the wake of the massacre, the authorities closed many of the patriotic clubs, as well as radical newspapers such as Jean-Paul Marat&#x27;s &quot;L&#x27;Ami du Peuple&quot;. Danton fled to England; Desmoulins and Marat went into hiding.

===Renewed threat from abroad===
Leopold II, Holy Roman Emperor, Frederick William II of Prussia, and the king&#x27;s brother Charles-Phillipe, comte d&#x27;Artois met at Pillnitz Castle in Dresden, where on 27 August 1791 they issued a declaration which considered the cause of Louis XVI as their own, demanded his total liberty and the dissolution of the Assembly, and promised an invasion of France on his behalf if its conditions were refused.

If anything, the Declaration of Pilnitz further imperilled Louis. The French people were in no temper to be dictated to by foreign monarchs, and the threat of force merely resulted in the militarization of the frontiers. King Louis was saved for the present by the fact that those in the Assembly who favored a constitutional monarchy over a republic desperately needed him to continue in his role.

===Constitution of 1791===

Even before the Flight to Varennes, the Assembly had determined that they themselves would be excluded from the legislature that was to succeed them, the Legislative Assembly. Mirabeau had opposed this limitation, and Adrien Duport memorably asked, &quot;While every one is pestering us with new principles of all sorts, how is it overlooked that stability is also a principle of government?&quot; but their views did not carry the day.

The Assembly now gathered the various constitutional laws they had passed into a single constitution, the Constitution of 1791. Showing remarkable fortitude in not using this occasion as an opportunity for major revisions, the Assembly submitted the constitution to the recently restored Louis XVI, who accepted it, writing &quot;I engage to maintain it at home, to defend it from all attacks from abroad; and to cause its execution by all the means it places at my disposal.&quot;

Once again, the king and the Assembly seemed to have reconciled. The king&#x27;s letter excited general approbation. Lafayette demanded and procured an amnesty in favor of those who were under prosecution for favouring the king&#x27;s flight, or for proceedings against the revolution. The king addressed the Assembly and was enthusiastically applauded by them and by the spectators.

The close of the Assembly was set for 29 September 1791.

Mignet has written, &quot;The constitution of 1791... was the work of the middle class, then the strongest; for, as is well known, the predominant force ever takes possession of institutions... In this constitution the people was the source of all powers, but it exercised none; it was entrusted only with election in the first instance, and its magistrates were selected by men chosen from among the enlightened portions of the community.&quot;

<text>John F. Kennedy Stadium, formerly Philadelphia Municipal Stadium and Sesquicentennial Stadium, was an open-air stadium in Philadelphia that stood from 1926 to 1992. The South Philadelphia stadium was on the east side of the far southern end of Broad Street at a location now part of the South Philadelphia Sports Complex. Designed by the architectural firm of Simon &amp; Simon in a classic 1920s style with a horseshoe seating design that surrounded a track and football field, at its peak the facility seated in excess of 102,000 people. Bleachers were later added at the open (North) end. The shape of the stadium resembles the horseshoe configuration of Harvard Stadium built in 1903.

Each section of the main portion of the stadium contained its own entrance, which displayed the letters of each section above the entrance, in a nod to ancient Roman stadia. Section designators were divided at the south end of the stadium (the bottom of the &quot;U&quot; shape) between West and East, starting with Sections WA and EA and proceeding north. The north bleachers started with Section NA.

It was built of concrete, stone, and brick on a tract.

==Opening and names==
Leaders of Philadelphia&#x27;s sports organizations gathered at the Philadelphia Chamber of Commerce in March 1920 and announced their intention to build a 200,000 seat sports stadium to attract national and international sporting events. The city immediately submitted its candidacy to host the 1924 Summer Olympics. At the time, the University of Pennsylvania&#x27;s Franklin Field was the city&#x27;s largest ballpark with a capacity of 30,000 seats; the Philadelphia Athletics&#x27; Shibe Park sat 23,000, and the Phillies&#x27; National League Park sat 18,000. The initial meeting in 1920 favored building the stadium as a memorial to the nation&#x27;s war dead and placing it in Fairmount Park at its entrance to the Benjamin Franklin Parkway.

The stadium was built as part of the 1926 Sesquicentennial International Exposition. Originally known as Sesquicentennial Stadium when it opened April 15, 1926, the structure was renamed Philadelphia Municipal Stadium after the Exposition&#x27;s closing ceremonies. In 1964, it was renamed John F. Kennedy Stadium in memory of the 35th President of the United States who had been assassinated the year before.

==Football==

The stadium&#x27;s first tenants (in 1926) were the Philadelphia Quakers of the first American Football League, whose Saturday afternoon home games were a popular mainstay of the Exposition. The Quakers won the league championship but the league folded after one year.

The Frankford Yellow Jackets also played here intermittently until the team&#x27;s demise in 1931. Two years later, the National Football League awarded another team to the city, the Philadelphia Eagles. The Eagles had a four-season stint as tenants of the stadium before moving to Shibe Park for the 1940 season, although the team did play at Municipal in 1941. The Eagles also used the stadium for practices in the 1970s and 1980s, even locating their first practice bubble there before moving it to the Veterans Stadium parking lot following the stadium&#x27;s condemnation.

The stadium became known chiefly as the &quot;neutral&quot; venue for a total of 41 annual Army–Navy Games played there between 1936 and 1979. The streak was briefly broken during World War II, when travel restrictions forced three games to be held on campus and one game to be played in Baltimore. From 1960 to 1970 the stadium served as Navy&#x27;s home field when they played Notre Dame. It also hosted the Notre Dame-Army game in 1957, marking the only time the Cadets have hosted the Fighting Irish outside of New York or New Jersey. The Pennsylvania Railroad and its successors, Penn Central and Conrail, offered game-day service to all Army-Navy games, using a sprawling temporary station constructed each year on the railroad&#x27;s nearby Greenwich freight yard. The service, with 40-odd trains serving as many as 30,000 attendees, was the single largest concentrated passenger rail movement in the country.

A.F. &quot;Bud&quot; Dudley, a former Villanova University athletic-director, created the Liberty Bowl in Philadelphia in 1959. The game was played at Municipal Stadium and was the only cold-weather bowl game of its time. It was plagued by poor attendance; the 1963 game between Mississippi State and NC State drew less than 10,000 fans and absorbed a loss in excess of $40,000. The Liberty Bowl&#x27;s best game was its first in 1959, when 38,000 fans watched Penn State beat Alabama 7–0. However, even that crowd was swallowed up in the environment. Atlantic City convinced Dudley to move his game from Philadelphia to Atlantic City&#x27;s Convention Hall for 1964. 6,059 fans saw Utah rout West Virginia in the first indoor bowl game. Dudley moved the game to Memphis in 1965 where it has been played since.

The stadium hosted Philadelphia&#x27;s City Title high school football championship game in 1939 and 1978. St. Joe&#x27;s Prep defeated Northeast, 27-6, in 1939. Frankford beat Archbishop Wood, 27-7, in heavy rain in 1978.

On September 16, 1950, the Cleveland Browns, playing their first season in the NFL after dominating the defunct All-America Football Conference (winning all four league titles), played their first NFL game against the two-time defending NFL Champion Philadelphia Eagles as a prelude to what would eventually in time become the NFL Kickoff Game. Philadelphia was the center of the professional football universe at the time; not only did the city host the defending NFL champions, but the league offices were also in town, headed up by NFL commissioner (and Philadelphia native) Bert Bell. To accommodate the anticipated ticket demand, the game was moved from Shibe Park; this proved to be a wise decision, as the contest drew a then NFL-record 71,237 — virtually doubling the Eagles&#x27; prior attendance record of 38,230. Many thought Bell had scheduled this game of defending league champions to teach the upstarts from the AAFC a lesson. Instead, the Browns shredded the Eagles&#x27; vaunted defense in a 35-10 rout and went on to win the NFL Championship that first year in the league.

In 1958, some 15,000 fans attended a CFL game between the Hamilton Tiger-Cats and the Ottawa Rough Riders with proceeds from ticket sales going to local charities. (Hamilton won, 24-18, in what remains the only regular-season CFL game played between two Canadian teams outside of Canada.)

The stadium was home to the Philadelphia Bell of the World Football League in 1974. The Bell seemed to give the WFL instant credibility when it announced a crowd of 55,534 for the home opener, and 64,719 for the second home game. However, when the Bell paid city taxes on the attendance figures two weeks later, it emerged that the gates had been wildly inflated. The team sold block tickets to area businesses at a discount, and the tax revenue was not reported. In turn, many of these businesses gave away the tickets for free. The actual paid attendance for the home opener was only 13,855, while the paid attendance for the second game was only 6,200—and many of &quot;those&quot; tickets were sold well below face value. The &quot;Papergate&quot; scandal made the Bell and the WFL look foolish, and proved to be a humiliation from which neither recovered. The team played at Franklin Field in 1975; the league folded late into that season.

==Other sports==
On September 23, 1926, an announced crowd of 120,557 packed the then-new Stadium during a rainstorm to witness Gene Tunney capture the world heavyweight boxing title from Jack Dempsey. Undefeated Rocky Marciano knocked out Jersey Joe Walcott at the stadium on September 23, 1952 to win boxing&#x27;s heavyweight championship.

On June 26, 1957, a 150-lap NASCAR convertible race was held at the Stadium, which was won by Bob Welborn in a 1957 Chevrolet.

JFK Stadium hosted Team America&#x27;s soccer match against England on May 31, 1976, as part of the 1976 U.S.A. Bicentennial Cup Tournament. In the game, England defeated Team America, 3-1, in front of a small crowd of 16,239. England and Italy had failed to qualify for the 1976 European Championship final tournament and so they joined Brazil and Team America, composed of international stars playing in the North American Soccer League, in the four team competition. Because Team America was composed of international players and was not the American national team, the Football Association does not regard England&#x27;s match against Team America as an official international match.

JFK Stadium was one of fifteen United States stadia (and along with Franklin Field, also in Philadelphia) inspected by a five-member FIFA committee in April 1988 in the evaluation of the United States as a possible host of the 1994 FIFA World Cup. By the time the World Cup was held in 1994, JFK Stadium had already been demolished two years prior.

==Other events==
The Philadelphia Flyers won their second Stanley Cup on May 27, 1975. The next day they celebrated with a parade down Broad Street that ended at the stadium. Five years later, the Philadelphia Phillies won their first World Series on October 21 of that year. The following day, the team paraded the exact route.
In 1981, The Rolling Stones announced their World Tour via a press conference at JFK.
Through 1989, the Broad Street Run course ended with a lap around the track at the stadium.

==Concerts==
JFK Stadium was known for hosting some of the largest and most prominent rock music acts of the late 20th century, including (but by no means limited to):
===1960s===

*September 10, 1965: The Supremes performed at the stadium.
*August 16, 1966: The Beatles played their second and final Philadelphia concert here.
*July 20, 1968: Judy Garland performed her last concert in the U.S., singing in part with the Count Basie band.

===1970s===
*June 12, 1976: Yes, Peter Frampton, Gary Wright, and others played the &quot;1976 Bicentennial Concert&quot; at the stadium.
*August 13, 1977: Led Zeppelin was scheduled to conclude their 1977 North American tour at the stadium, but the final five concerts of the tour were cancelled following the death of Robert Plant&#x27;s five-year-old son Karac. The original Led Zeppelin never played in the U.S. again, although the surviving members, including Plant, Jimmy Page, and John Paul Jones (drummer John Bonham died in 1980 from pulmonary aspiration following excessive alcohol intake) reunited to perform at Live Aid at John F. Kennedy Stadium on July 13, 1985.
*June 11, 1977: Peter Frampton returned from a seven-month lay-off and played at the stadium accompanied by Lynyrd Skynyrd, The J. Geils Band, Dickey Betts, and Great Southern, before 91,000 fans, on June 11, 1977.
*June 17, 1978: The Rolling Stones performed in front of 90,000 fans during the fifth concert of their 1978 U.S. tour following release of their album, &quot;Some Girls&quot;. Opening acts included Bob Marley&#x27;s former bandmate Peter Tosh and Foreigner.
*July 30, 1978: An all-day concert was held at the stadium, featuring Sanford-Townsend Band, Bob Welch, Steve Miller Band, and Fleetwood Mac. Bob Welch and Steve Miller sets were marred by public address system problems. The Fleetwood Mac set was marred by the unreliable vocals of Stevie Nicks, who was disinterested at best and off-key or off-tempo at worst. The rest of the band was strong, however, especially Lindsey Buckingham&#x27;s guitar work and Christine McVie&#x27;s vocals.

===1980s===
*June 20, 1981: An all-day concert called The Roundup started at 10am, including southern rock bands .38 Special, the Marshall Tucker Band, Molly Hatchet, The Outlaws, and the Allman Brothers.
*September 25 and 26, 1981: The Rolling Stones opened their 1981 U.S. Tour in support of their new album &quot;Tattoo You&quot; with two shows at JFK Stadium, in front of 90,000 fans each night. Opening acts included Journey and George Thorogood &amp; the Destroyerss. Mick Jagger met the press at JFK Stadium on August 26, 1981, to announce the tour. Apparently in honor of the old stadium&#x27;s football heritage and the Philadelphia Eagles&#x27; recent NFC championship, Jagger performed in something resembling a pair of football trousers and knee pads and a Philadelphia Eagles jersey that became part of his stage wardrobe for the rest of the tour. The Rolling Stones pre-opened the tour with a warm-up show at the Sir Morgan&#x27;s Cove club in Worcester, Massachusetts, on September 14, 1981.
*June 19, 1982: An all-day festival called the J.F.K jam featured Huey Lewis &amp; the News, Joan Jett and the Black Hearts, Loverboy, The Kinks and headliner Foreigner, who were touring their 6x-platinum &quot;4&quot; album and inflated a colorful, 30-foot-high facsimile of a Wurlitzer-style jukebox as they performed &quot;Juke Box Hero&quot; in the show&#x27;s final minutes.
*July 3, 1982: Rick James performed a concert called &quot;The Throwdown in Phillytown&quot;, which also featured Frankie Beverly and Maze, Kool and the Gang, Atlantic Starr, and One Way featuring Al Hudson.
*August 21, 1982: Blondie concluded their Tracks Across America Tour at the stadium. They disbanded shortly after it when guitarist Chris Stein was diagnosed with a rare life-threatening disease known as pemphigus; the band&#x27;s final album, &quot;The Hunter&quot;, had also sold poorly. They did not perform live again until 15 years later, in 1997. Genesis was the headliner and used the open air stadium for one of their spectacular nighttime laser and fireworks shows. The show started at 3pm and also featured Elvis Costello &amp; The Attractions, A Flock of Seagulls, and Robert Hazard &amp; The Heroes.
*September 25, 1982: The Who performed at the stadium early in what was then labeled their Farewell Tour, which also supported their album &quot;It&#x27;s Hard&quot;. Opening acts were Santana, The Clash, and The Hooters. Total attendance was 91,451, one of the largest ticketed single-show, non-festival stadium concerts ever held in the U.S., according to &quot;Billboard&quot;.
*June 4, 1983: Journey headlined a concert that also featured Bryan Adams, The Tubes, Sammy Hagar, and John Cougar. This show provided the majority of the concert footage for the NFL Films documentary, &quot;Journey, Frontiers and Beyond&quot;.
*August 20, 1983: The Police headlined a festival with opening acts R.E.M., Madness, and Joan Jett.
*September 1984: The Jacksons performed at the stadium for four sold-out shows during their Victory Tour with 200,000 in attendance, one of the largest audiences of the tour.
*July 13, 1985: Live Aid, a dual-venue concert at JFK stadium in Philadelphia (attended by 89,484 people) and Wembley Stadium in London (attended by 72,000 people). Musical acts that appeared at JFK included Madonna, Simple Minds, The Beach Boys, Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers, REO Speedwagon, The Hooters, Bryan Adams, Eric Clapton, The Cars, Black Sabbath, Run-DMC, Judas Priest, Hall &amp; Oates, the surviving members of Led Zeppelin, Crosby, Stills, Nash, &amp; Young, Tina Turner, Bob Dylan, Mick Jagger, Keith Richards, and Ronnie Wood, of The Rolling Stones, and dual appearances by Phil Collins, who performed first at Wembley, traveled by helicopter to Heathrow Airport, flew to Philadelphia via Concorde, and performed at JFK.
*July 10, 1987: Bob Dylan and The Grateful Dead performed in front of 70,000-plus on a day when it was 90 °F in the shade and fans near the stage were sprayed with water.
*September 19, 1987: Pink Floyd performed at the stadium in front of a crowd of over 120,000, which included general admission on the field, and the show was still not sold out to full capacity.
*September 25, 1987: U2 performed at the stadium during their Joshua Tree Tour in front of a crowd of 86,145.
*June 11, 1988: The Monsters of Rock Tour featuring Van Halen, the Scorpions, Dokken, Metallica, and Kingdom Come, was held at the stadium.
*September 19, 1988: Amnesty International&#x27;s Human Rights Now! benefit concert was held at the stadium with approximately 80,000 attendees. The show was headlined by Bruce Springsteen and the E Street Band with opening acts Sting, Tracy Chapman, Peter Gabriel, Youssou N&#x27;Dour, and Joan Baez.
*July 7, 1989: The stadium&#x27;s last concert was Grateful Dead with Bruce Hornsby &amp; The Range as the opening act. Fans at the show recall concrete crumbling and the stadium&#x27;s bathrooms in poor shape. The Dead closed the show with &quot;Knockin&#x27; on Heaven&#x27;s Door&quot;, which proved to be the last live song played at the last official performance in the stadium. Twenty-one years later, in 2010, the recording of this concert was released on a CD/DVD combination, titled &quot;Crimson White &amp; Indigo&quot;.
*August 28 and 29, 1989: In preparation for opening their 1989 Steel Wheels Tour at Veterans Stadium in Philadelphia on August 31, 1989, The Rolling Stones set up their stage inside JFK Stadium for two full dress-rehearsal performances on August 28 and 29, 1989. A few dozen fans were allowed to enter the stadium to attend these rehearsals.

==Closing and demolition==
Six days after the Grateful Dead&#x27;s 1989 show, Mayor Wilson Goode condemned the stadium due to multiple findings by city inspectors that the stadium was structurally unsafe as well as a potential fire hazard. Just hours before the concert, city inspectors had discovered piles of combustible materials, numerous electrical problems, and crumbling and/or falling concrete. By this time, some 20,000 people were already in the stadium, with another 20,000 in line waiting to enter. The Grateful Dead were only allowed to perform due to strict no-smoking regulations that had been enacted some time before.

While renovation and repairs of the stadium were discussed, this was quickly rejected due to the exceedingly high costs, and it was demolished on September 23, 1992.

The 1993 Philadelphia stop for the Lollapalooza music festival was held at the JFK Stadium site on July 18, 1993. The site was an open field, as construction had not yet begun on the then still tentatively named &quot;Spectrum II&quot; (Wells Fargo Center). This was the show at which Rage Against the Machine stood on stage without playing in protest of the Parents Music Resource Center.

The Wells Fargo Center now stands on the site. The Center is part of the Sports Complex that also includes Lincoln Financial Field and Citizens Bank Park.

<text>Robert Frank Knoop ( ; born October 18, 1938) is an American former Major League Baseball second baseman and coach. In his nine-year MLB career, he appeared in 1,153 games as a member of the Los Angeles / California Angels (1964–69), Chicago White Sox (1969–70) and Kansas City Royals (1971–72). He threw and batted right-handed, stood tall and weighed .

== Early life ==
Knoop was born on October 18, 1938, in Sioux City, Iowa to parents Frank and Mabel Knoop. His father was a German immigrant while his mother was a descendant of Swiss and Norwegian immigrants. Frank lived to be 101. After attending Montebello High School in Montebello, California, he was signed by the Milwaukee Braves in 1956. 

== Baseball career ==

=== Minor league player ===
He played for ten different minor league teams between 1956 and 1963, his best year being in 1963 with the Hawaiin Islanders of the Triple-A Pacific Coast League, where he had a .283 batting average, with 20 homeruns, 72 runs scored, 67 RBI, and a .965 fielding percentage.

=== Major league player ===
Nicknamed &quot;Nureyev&quot; by sportswriters for his exciting and acrobatic fielding plays, Knoop played a deep second base, with exceptional range and a strong arm. In another version, Knoop says the nickname derived from not only his acrobatic skills at second base, but a fabricated story he told the writers that his mother had made him take ballet lessons.

In December 1963, the Los Angeles Angels obtained him via the Rule 5 draft, by the rules of which he was required to remain on the 1964 major-league roster. He in fact played in every game that season and remained the Angels&#x27; regular second baseman for the next five and a half years (the name changing to California Angels in 1965), winning the club&#x27;s MVP award four times in the span, a mark tied by Garret Anderson and Mike Trout.

He turned the double play well along with shortstop Jim Fregosi, to give the Angels outstanding keystone defense. Fregosi was his roommate and closest friend in baseball, as well as a teammate. In , the pair both won the Gold Glove award at their respective positions—the second of three Gold Gloves Knoop would capture from 1966 to 1968. He was the American League&#x27;s starting second baseman in the 1966 Major League Baseball All-Star Game, and went hitless in two at bats. As a hitter, he had his best season during , with career-highs of 17 home runs, 72 RBI, 54 runs and 11 triples.

Knoop was sent to the White Sox in mid-1969 and then was traded to the Royals in 1971, where he also rejoined former Angels third baseman Paul Schaal. With Kansas City, he played mostly as a backup for Cookie Rojas.

In his career, Knoop batted .236, with 56 home runs, 331 RBIs, 337 runs, 856 hits, 129 doubles, 29 triples, and 16 stolen bases in 1153 games. He is tied for the record of most double plays in a game by a second basemen, six, held with Alfonso Soriano and Bill Doran, which Knoop did on May 1, 1966. He is also tied for the record of most putouts in a game by a second baseman, twelve, being the most recent person to accomplish this (August 30, 1966).

=== Coaching ===
After retiring, Knoop worked for over 40 years as a minor league and major league coach, scout and adviser, including stints with the Chicago White Sox (1977–78, assistant coach), California Angels (1979–96 as first base and third base coach), Toronto Blue Jays (2000, as first base coach) and Colorado Rockies (2008–12, 2008 as pro scout and 2009 as senior advisor for player development), and Los Angeles Angels (2014–18 as infield coach or infield instructor). In 1997 and 1998, he was head coach at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia. In 1994, Knoop served as manager of the Angels for two games, posting a 1–1 record. In February 2019, Knoop retired from Major League Baseball, after a career that lasted 53 years.

=== Honors ===
He was inducted into the Angels Hall of Fame in 2013. Knoop was inducted into the Orange County, California Sports Hall of Fame in 1991.

<text>Manning Coles was the pseudonym of two British writers, Adelaide Frances Oke Manning (1891–1959) and Cyril Henry Coles (1899–1965), who wrote many spy thrillers from the early 1940s through the early 1960s. The fictional protagonist in 26 of their books was Thomas Elphinstone Hambledon, who works for a department of the Foreign Office, usually referred to in the novels as &quot;MI5&quot;.

==Biography==
Manning and Coles were neighbours in East Meon, Hampshire. Coles worked for British Intelligence in both the World Wars. Manning worked for the War Office during World War I. Their first books were fairly realistic and with a touch of grimness; their postwar books perhaps suffered from an excess of lightheartedness and whimsy. They also wrote a number of humorous novels about modern-day ghosts, some of them involving ghostly cousins named Charles and James Latimer. These novels were published in England under the pseudonym of Francis Gaite but released in the United States under the Manning Coles byline.
Many of the original exploits were based on the real-life experiences of Coles, who lied about his age and enlisted under an assumed name in a Hampshire regiment during World War I while still a teenager. He eventually became the youngest officer in British intelligence, often working behind German lines, due to his extraordinary ability to master languages.

==Tommy Hambledon==
Thomas Elphinstone Hambledon works for a department of the Foreign Office, usually referred to in the novels as &quot;MI5&quot; (counter-intelligence), although in the earliest books he is clearly working for the active overseas department MI6. The character is thought to have been based by Coles on a former teacher of his.

<text>Henry Jackson Hunt (September 14, 1819 – February 11, 1889) was Chief of Artillery in the Army of the Potomac during the American Civil War. Considered by his contemporaries the greatest artillery tactician and strategist of the war, he was a master of the science of gunnery and rewrote the manual on the organization and use of artillery in early modern armies. His courage and tactics affected the outcome of some of the most significant battles in the war, including Malvern Hill, Antietam, Fredericksburg, and most notably at Gettysburg, where his operational decisions regarding strategic cannon placement and conservation of ammunition for the Confederate main assault, contributed greatly to the defeat of Pickett&#x27;s Charge.

==Early life and family==
Hunt was born in the frontier outpost of Detroit to Samuel Wellington Hunt, an Army infantry officer who entered West Point in 1814 and died in 1829. He was named after his uncle, Henry Jackson Hunt, who was the second mayor of Detroit. His grandfather was Colonel Thomas Hunt, who served with distinction in the Continental Army throughout the American Revolution and served in the United States Army after the war until his death in 1808. Thus, Hunt was a hereditary member of the Massachusetts Society of the Cincinnati by right of his grandfather&#x27;s service.

As a child in 1827, he accompanied his father on the expedition to the future Kansas Territory that founded Fort Leavenworth.

His brother, Lewis Cass Hunt, served throughout the Civil War in the infantry, becoming a brigadier general of volunteers in 1862, and brevet brigadier general in the Regular Army in 1865.

==Career==
===Mexican-American War and &quot;Instructions for Field Artillery&quot;===
He graduated from the United States Military Academy in 1839 as a brevet second lieutenant in the 2nd U.S. Artillery. He served in the Mexican War under Winfield Scott, and was appointed a brevet captain for gallantry at Contreras and Churubusco and to major at Chapultepec. Hunt was a veteran member of the Aztec Club of 1847 and a First Class Companion of the Military Order of the Loyal Legion of the United States which were military societies of United States officers who had served in the Mexican War and Civil War respectively.

On October 5, 1856, Brevet Major Hunt commanded Company M, 2nd U.S. Artillery from Fort Leavenworth, that protected the polls at Eaton, Kansas, during the territorial legislature elections. Hunt served with the same unit during the Utah War in 1857 against the Mormons. His permanent (regular army) promotions to captain and major were in 1852 and 1861, respectively.

In 1856 Hunt was a member of a three-man board that revised field artillery drill and tactics for the army. The &quot;Instructions for Field Artillery&quot; manual written by the three (Hunt, William H. French, and William F. Barry) was published by the War Department in 1861 and was the &quot;bible&quot; of Northern field artillerists during the war. He was a principal proponent of the organizational doctrine that allowed infantry brigades to retain artillery batteries for close-in support, but that moved batteries formerly assigned to divisions and corps to an Artillery Reserve at the army level for more strategic control.

===Civil War===

====First Bull Run through Chancellorsville====

Hunt achieved some fame in the First Battle of Bull Run in 1861, when his four-gun battery covered the retreat of a Union force with a close-in artillery duel. He soon afterward became chief of artillery in the Department of Northeast Virginia, defending Washington, D.C.

As a colonel on the staff of Maj. Gen. George B. McClellan, Hunt organized and trained the artillery reserve of the Army of the Potomac and fought with it in the Peninsula Campaign. Throughout the war he contributed more than any officer to the effective employment of the artillery arm. With the artillery reserve at the Battle of Malvern Hill, his 250 guns repelled repeated Confederate infantry assaults with such gruesome efficiency that the Union infantry had little to do. He personally commanded a group of 60 guns that he employed as if they were a single battery (usually Union batteries contained six guns).

On September 15, 1862, the day after the Battle of South Mountain, Hunt was promoted to brigadier general of volunteers and McClellan assigned him as chief of artillery in the Army of the Potomac for the imminent Battle of Antietam, where he deployed the Artillery Reserve to great effect. At the Battle of Fredericksburg in December, his gun emplacements on Stafford Heights effectively eliminated any possibility that Gen. Robert E. Lee could counterattack Union forces across the Rappahannock River.

In the run-up to the Battle of Chancellorsville in May 1863, Hunt fell out of favor of Army of the Potomac commander Maj. Gen. Joseph Hooker and lost direct command of the Artillery Reserve, reducing him in effect to an administrative staff role. The lack of coordination of the artillery forces that resulted from this snub were well recognized as a contributing factor in the embarrassing Union defeat. Although Hooker restored Hunt&#x27;s command after three days of battle, it was too late to affect the outcome.

Hunt was also a proponent of artillery practices that reflected his conservative nature. Although acknowledging the power of massed batteries to repel infantry assaults (such as at Malvern Hill or against Pickett&#x27;s Charge in the Battle of Gettysburg), he urged his gun crews to fire slowly and deliberately and reprimanded them if they exceeded an average of one shot per minute. He believed that faster rates impaired accurate targeting and depleted ammunition faster than could be replenished. A story often told about Hunt was when he exclaimed to a gunner of a fast-firing gun, &quot;Young man, are you aware that every round you fire costs $2.67?&quot; Fast firing also implied to him that the gun crew was not brave enough to stand fast on the battlefield, wanting to get back behind the lines for resupply.

====Success at Gettysburg====
Hunt&#x27;s most famous service in the war was at the Battle of Gettysburg in July 1863. His new commander, Maj. Gen. George G. Meade, had considerably more respect for Hunt than Hooker did and not only gave him great latitude in directing the artillery, but also used him on occasion as his personal representative. For example, on July 2, Meade sent Hunt to visit III Corps commander Maj. Gen. Daniel E. Sickles in an attempt to get his defensive lines to conform to orders. (Sickles&#x27; insubordinate movement from Cemetery Ridge, where he had been ordered to defend, to the Peach Orchard caused considerable difficulty for the entire Union defense.) Hunt was unable to influence the irascible political general, but his masterful analysis of terrain and placement of batteries on the ridge were important factors in the Union&#x27;s eventual success on the second day.

His handling of the artillery was conspicuous in the repulse of Pickett&#x27;s Charge on July 3. During a morning inspection, Hunt observed activity in the Confederate lines and rightly concluded an assault was being readied. Later, with the Union line on Cemetery Ridge under massive bombardment from Longstreet&#x27;s corps artillery chief, Col. Edward Porter Alexander, Hunt was able to resist command pressure from fiery II Corps commander Maj. Gen. Winfield S. Hancock who had demanded Union fire to lift the spirits of the infantrymen pinned down under Alexander&#x27;s bombardment. Hunt ordered that counter-battery fire cease to conserve ammunition, reserving sufficient amounts for anti-personnel fire in the attack he knew was coming. Hunt also directed his cannons to cease fire slowly to create the illusion that they were being destroyed one by one, which fooled the Confederates into thinking his batteries were destroyed and triggered their disastrous charge. His concealed placement of Lt. Col. Freeman McGilvery&#x27;s batteries north of Little Round Top caused massive casualties in the infantry assault. Hunt was rewarded for his service with the brevet of colonel in the Regular Army. Hunt reported in detail on the artillery&#x27;s role at Gettysburg. He always maintained that the Confederate attack would never have happened had he been allowed to do what he&#x27;d intended—conserve his long-range ammunition during the initial southern bombardment, then hit them with everything he had when they lined up for their advance.

In addition to &quot;Instructions for Field Artillery&quot;, Hunt was the author of papers on Gettysburg in the &quot;Battles and Leaders&quot; series.

====Siege of Petersburg====
The rest of the war was an anticlimax for Hunt. He served in Virginia to the end of the war, managing the siege operations of Petersburg in 1864 and 1865. He was breveted major general both in the volunteers and in the Regular Army.

====Postwar====
When the U.S. Army was reorganized in 1866, Hunt became colonel of the 5th U.S. Artillery. He served as commanding officer of Fort Adams in Newport, Rhode Island, from May 20, 1869, until November 10, 1875, and as president of the permanent Artillery Board. Hunt held various commands until retirement from the Army in 1883.

==Later life==
Upon retirement in 1883, Hunt become governor of the Soldiers&#x27; Home in Washington, D.C. He died in 1889 and is buried in the Soldiers&#x27; Home National Cemetery. Fort Hunt Park in Northern Virginia is named after Hunt.

==In popular media==
Hunt is featured prominently in the alternate history novel &quot;&quot; by Newt Gingrich and William R. Forstchen. He also appears in the sequel novels of the series, &quot;Grant Comes East&quot; and &quot;Never Call Retreat: Lee and Grant: The Final Victory&quot;.

<text>Count Oktavian Kinsky (1813–1896) was a member of the Kinsky dynasty and noted horse breeder. He married Agnes Schaffgotsch genannt Semperfrei von und zu Kynast und Greiffenstein (1810–1888). Recorded in the Almanach de Gotha, the couple were amongst the grandest elite of the Austro-Hungarian Empire. They had no children.

Kinsky was Bohemia&#x27;s and Europe&#x27;s most successful horse breeder. In 1834 he expanded the already renowned family stud farm in Eastern Bohemia. The gold-coloured horses he bred there were some of the finest in the world, and remained so until the mid 20th century.

The breeding programme of the Kinsky horse placed huge importance upon temperament, stamina and agility.

Later in his life Kinsky introduced European style fox hunting to Bohemia, and in 1846 he introduced English style point-to-point racing. Finally in 1874 he created a Grand National style race, known today as the Pardubice Grand National, Europe&#x27;s most strenuous test of equine stamina.

<text>Honda Center (formerly known as the Arrowhead Pond of Anaheim) is an indoor arena located in Anaheim, California. The arena is home to the Anaheim Ducks of the National Hockey League.

Originally named the Anaheim Arena during construction, it was completed in 1993 at a cost of US$123 million. Arrowhead Water paid $15 million for the naming rights over 10 years in October 1993. In the short period of time after the Mighty Ducks franchise was awarded and before the naming rights deal with Arrowhead, Disney referred to the Arena as the Pond of Anaheim. In October 2006, Honda paid $60 million for the naming rights over 15 years, and renewed the deal for another decade in 2020.

==History==
 


The idea for a large indoor arena in Anaheim emerged from entertainment attorney Neil Papiano, who in 1987 randomly selected two of the city&#x27;s councilmen from the telephone directory to sell them his idea. They approved of the concept, and one year later following location surveys, the placement was chosen at a seven-acre parcel at Douglass Road and Katella Avenue, that at the time was owned by the German social group Phoenix Club. Papiano also managed to get financial backing from two New York-based firms, Ogden Corporation and Nederlander Organization. Even if there was a dispute to build an arena in Orange County with a Santa Ana project led by Spectacor, and there were discussions of feasibility of the arena given the National Basketball Association and National Hockey League were at the time unwilling to expand to the area, the city of Anaheim pushed forward to build the Hellmuth, Obata &amp; Kassabaum, Inc.-designed arena, which broke ground in November 1990. A tenant was finally found in 1992, as The Walt Disney Company had just been awarded an NHL franchise for Anaheim, entering negotiations to lease the arena. Once the deal was broken, the arena&#x27;s final cost ended at $121 million, as $18 million were added to finance hockey franchise fees and facility improvement.

The arena opened on June 19, 1993, with a Barry Manilow concert as its first event. The then-Arrowhead Pond&#x27;s first NHL game was also the Mighty Ducks of Anaheim season opener on October 8, 1993, against the Detroit Red Wings, preceded by a 20-minute pregame show at the cost of $450,000. The Ducks lost 7–2. Since then, the arena has been host to a number of events, such as the 2003 and 2007 Stanley Cup Finals. On June 6, 2007, the Anaheim Ducks defeated the Ottawa Senators, 6–2, in game five of the Final at Honda Center to clinch the franchise&#x27;s first Stanley Cup championship.

Honda Center has hosted several UFC events, starting with UFC 59 in 2006. It hosted the 2005 IBF World Championships for badminton in 2005.

From 1994 to 1999, it served as a second home for the NBA&#x27;s Los Angeles Clippers. It was the home arena for the Anaheim Bullfrogs of Roller Hockey International from 1994 to 1999 and for the Anaheim Piranhas of the Arena Football League from 1996 to 1997.

This arena has also hosted a PBR Bud Light Cup (later Built Ford Tough Series) event annually since 1998. Since 1994, the arena has hosted the annual Wooden Legacy basketball tournament.

In 2011, the arena began hosting the Big West Conference Men&#x27;s and Women&#x27;s Basketball tournaments. The arena has also hosted the NCAA men&#x27;s basketball tournament seven times, as the West Regional site – 1998, 2001, 2003, 2008, 2011, 2014, 2016 and 2019. It even hosted the Frozen Four, the semifinals and final of the NCAA Men&#x27;s Ice Hockey Championship, in 1999, underscoring the popularity of hockey in the region.

On December 6, 2000, music legend Tina Turner played her last concert at the arena for the record breaking Twenty Four Seven Tour, but after popular demand, Turner returned to the arena before a sellout crowd on October 14, 2008, for her Tina!: 50th Anniversary Tour.

Honda Center lies northeast across California State Route 57 from Angel Stadium (the home stadium of Major League Baseball&#x27;s Los Angeles Angels) and roughly from Disneyland Park. It is also across the street from Anaheim Regional Transportation Intermodal Center with service by Amtrak (&quot;Pacific Surfliner&quot;), Metrolink (&quot;Orange County Line&quot;), Anaheim Resort Transit, Orange County Transportation Authority and private transportation companies.

The arena seats up to 17,174 for its primary tenant, the Ducks. It takes only five hours to convert Honda Center from a sporting arena to an 8,400-seat amphitheater. There are 84 luxury suites in the building, which has hosted 17.5 million people, as of 2003. In 2005, the arena became the first in the U.S. to have two full levels of 360° ribbon displays installed. Daktronics of Brookings, South Dakota, designed, manufactured and installed the of full-color LED technology. Outside the venue, the marquee was upgraded with two large video displays measuring high by , and a new marquee was built with more LED video displays.

Broadcom chairman Henry Samueli owns the company that operates the arena, Anaheim Arena Management, LLC, and the arena&#x27;s primary tenant, the Ducks, giving him great flexibility in scheduling events and recruiting new tenants. AAM was founded in 2003 to take over operations of the arena from the bankrupt Ogden Corp., which had already sold the arena&#x27;s concession deal to Aramark in 2000 - who remained providing foods and drinks until 2013, when concessions became an in-house operation.

During the 2014–2015 NHL Season, it was announced that Honda Center would get a new scoreboard that will replace the one that was in place since its opening in 1993. The new scoreboard made its debut in a Ducks pre-season game against the Los Angeles Kings.

In March 2020, the arena would lose all its scheduled events because of the COVID-19 pandemic. For the rest of the year, Honda Center would instead host charity events, such as blood drives, food bank distributions, and a collective wedding, along with serving as a drive-through voting location for the 2020 United States presidential election. The Ducks would only play again in the arena once the following NHL season started in January 2021, with a reduced audience of 2,000 being allowed to attend the final five games of the season, starting with an April 17 matchup with the Vegas Golden Knights.

<text>Thomas Elphinstone Hambledon (Tommy Hambledon) is the fictional protagonist of many spy novels written by the British author &quot;Manning Coles&quot; (actually the two-person writing team of Adelaide Frances Oke Manning and Cyril Henry Coles) from 1940 through 1963. He works for a department of the Foreign Office, usually referred to in the novels as &quot;MI5&quot; (counter-intelligence), although in the earliest books he is clearly working for the active overseas department MI6.

==Character background==
Hambledon is a teacher in a British boarding school in his first appearance in &quot;Drink to Yesterday&quot; (1940) and, during school holidays, a spy in Germany for the Foreign Office. At the end of this book, which takes place in World War I and in which he is known only as Tommy Hambledon, he disappears at sea and is presumed dead. He reappears as the hero of the next book, &quot;Pray Silence&quot; (1940) (known in the U.S. by the title &quot;Toast to Tomorrow&quot;), which begins in the 1920s. He is an amnesiac in Germany who gradually works his way up in the fledgling Nazi Party until, in 1933, he becomes Hitler&#x27;s Chief of Police. He recovers his memory on the night of the Reichstag fire, and thereafter battles to defeat Hitler and his plans. His full name is revealed to be Thomas Elphinstone Hambledon. At the end of the book he fakes his own death in Danzig (Hitler himself delivers the eulogy at his &#x27;funeral&#x27;) and stows away with his colleague, Alfred Reck, on a British cargo ship bound for Cardiff. On their return to Britain he and Reck are faced with the problem of a series of unexplained sinkings of ships not long out of harbour in Portsmouth in &quot;They Tell No Tales&quot; (1941).

In &quot;Green Hazard&quot; (1945) the Gestapo mistake him for Professor Ulseth, inventor of a new and extremely powerful high explosive, and kidnap him. He then finds himself once again in Berlin where he has to fool his &#x27;hosts&#x27; into believing that he actually knows something about chemistry whilst praying that they will fail to recognise a former colleague. After World War II, he continues his career in the Foreign Office and helps defeat a number of Communist plots. In these later adventures, he is frequently aided by Forgan and Campbell, a semi-comic team of model-makers from the Clerkenwell Road in London, who first appear in &quot;A Brother for Hugh&quot; (1947). In this and some other of Manning Coles&#x27; subsequent novels Hambledon actually occupies quite a minor role — in &quot;The Man in the Green Hat&quot; (1955) he hardly appears at all in the first half of the book.

Hambledon is thought to have been based by Coles on a former teacher of his. He eventually became the youngest officer in British intelligence, often working behind German lines, due to his extraordinary ability to master languages.

Cyril Coles himself was a model maker and was, at the time of his death, building a train set from scratch for his young grandson.

==In popular culture==
In the season four premiere episode of &quot;Archer&quot;, the titular secret agent character is similarly suffering from amnesia, believing himself to be the eponymous hamburger chef character of the animated series &quot;Bob&#x27;s Burgers&quot;. The &quot;daily special&quot; on the menu board is &quot;Thomas Elphinstone Hambledurger with Manning Coleslaw&quot;.

<text>Tawana Vicenia Brawley (born December 15, 1971) is an African American woman from New York who gained notoriety in November 1987 at age 15 when she falsely accused four white men of kidnapping and raping her over a four-day period. 

On November 28, 1987, Brawley was found in a trash bag after having been missing for four days from her home in Wappingers Falls, New York. She had racial slurs written on her body and was covered in feces. The feces came from a collie owned by a resident of the building where Brawley was found. Brawley accused four white men of having raped her. The charges received national attention in part because of the appalling condition in which she had been left, her young age, and the professional status of the persons she accused of the crime (including police officers and a prosecuting attorney). Brawley&#x27;s advisers—Al Sharpton, Alton H. Maddox, and C. Vernon Mason—helped in bringing the case to national prominence. 

After hearing evidence, a grand jury concluded in October 1988 that Brawley had not been the victim of a forcible sexual assault, and that she may have created the appearance of such an attack herself. Steven Pagones, the Greek American New York prosecutor whom Brawley had accused as being one of her assailants, later successfully sued Brawley and her three advisers for defamation.

Brawley received support from the African American community. Some academics have suggested that Brawley was victimized by biased reporting that was influenced by racial stereotypes. The mainstream media&#x27;s coverage drew heated criticism from the African American press, and from many black leaders who believed the teenager and her story. The grand jury&#x27;s conclusions decreased support for Brawley and her advisers; Brawley&#x27;s family have maintained that the allegations were true.

== Origins of the case ==
On November 28, 1987, Tawana Brawley, who had been missing for four days from her home in Wappingers Falls, New York, was found seemingly unconscious and unresponsive, lying in a garbage bag several feet from an apartment where she had once lived. Her clothing was torn and burned, her body smeared with feces. She was taken to the emergency room, where the words &quot;Pimp-Nigger&quot; and &quot;KKK&quot; were discovered written on her torso with charcoal.

A detective from the sheriff&#x27;s juvenile aid bureau, among others, was summoned to interview Brawley, but she remained unresponsive. The family requested a black officer, which the police department was able to provide. Brawley, described as having an &quot;extremely spacey&quot; look on her face, communicated with this officer with nods of the head, shrugs of the shoulder, and written notes. The interview lasted 20 minutes, during which she uttered only one word: &quot;neon&quot;. Through gestures and writing, however, she indicated she had been raped repeatedly in a wooded area by six white men, at least one of whom, she said, was a police officer.

A sexual assault kit was administered, and police began building a case. Brawley provided no names or descriptions of her assailants. She later told others that there had been no rape, only other kinds of sexual abuse. Forensic tests found no evidence of sexual assault or sexual intercourse. There was no evidence of exposure to elements, which would have been expected in a victim held for several days in the woods at a time when the temperature dropped below freezing at night.

==Public response==

The initial public response to Brawley&#x27;s story was mostly sympathetic. Bill Cosby offered a $25,000 reward for information on the case, while Don King pledged $100,000 toward Brawley&#x27;s education. In December 1987, more than one thousand people, including Nation of Islam leader Louis Farrakhan, marched through the streets of Newburgh, New York, in support of Brawley.

Brawley&#x27;s claims in the case captured headlines across the country. Public rallies were held denouncing the incident. When civil rights activist Al Sharpton, with attorneys Alton H. Maddox and C. Vernon Mason, began handling Brawley&#x27;s publicity, the case quickly became highly controversial. Sharpton, Maddox, and Mason generated a national media sensation. The three said that officials all the way up to the state government were trying to cover up defendants in the case because they were white. They further suggested that the Ku Klux Klan, the Irish Republican Army, and the Mafia had conspired with the U.S. government in the alleged cover-up. 

Harry Crist Jr. became a suspect in the case because he committed suicide shortly after the period when Brawley was allegedly held captive and was a part-time police officer in Fishkill, New York, which borders Brawley&#x27;s hometown. Steven Pagones, an assistant district attorney in Dutchess County, New York, attempted to establish an alibi for Crist, stating that he had been with Crist during that period of time. Sharpton, Maddox, and Mason then said that Crist and Pagones were two of the rapists. They also accused Pagones, a Greek American, of being a racist and a white supremacist. Based on Crist&#x27;s suicide note, &quot;The New York Times&quot; reported that he killed himself because his girlfriend ended their relationship shortly before his death, and because he was upset that he was unable to become a state trooper.

The mainstream media&#x27;s coverage drew heated criticism from the African American press and leaders for its treatment of the teenager. They cited the leaking and publication of photos taken of her at the hospital, and the revelation of her name despite her being underage. In addition, critics were concerned that Brawley had been left in the custody of her mother, stepfather, and advisers, rather than being given protection by the state. In an opinion piece in &quot;The New York Times&quot;, Martha Miles and Richard L. Madden wrote:
State law provides that if a child appears to have been sexually molested, then the Child Protective Services Agency is supposed to take jurisdiction and custody of that child. Now, Tawana Brawley was 15 at the time of the incident. If that had been done... early on, the agency would have given her psychiatric attention and preserved evidence of rape...

Sharpton&#x27;s former aide, Perry McKinnon, said that Sharpton, Maddox, and Mason were unconcerned with Brawley, and were using the case to &quot;tak[e] over the town,&quot; as he had heard Sharpton say that the case could make him and Brawley&#x27;s other two advisers &quot;the biggest niggers in New York.&quot; In June 1988, at the height of the controversy surrounding the case, a poll showed a gap of 34 percentage points between blacks (51%) and whites (85%) on the question of whether Brawley was lying.

==Grand jury hearings==
Faced with an uncooperative Brawley, who was advised by Sharpton, Maddox, and Mason to not answer questions, New York governor Mario Cuomo eventually appointed the state&#x27;s attorney general, Robert Abrams, as special prosecutor for the case. A grand jury was convened to hear evidence, with John M. Ryan, Abrams&#x27;s assistant in charge of criminal prosecutions, delegated the responsibility of leading the investigation. Brawley&#x27;s team employed a general strategy of discouraging Brawley and her family from testifying, which they justified by claiming that an unjust refusal by the state to prosecute the alleged attackers was inevitable. Their inflammatory rhetoric and tactics, such as conditioning interviews with investigators on Cuomo, Abrams and Ryan undergoing psychological evaluations, were viewed by many as flippant and inappropriate. Sharpton, in particular, drew criticism for comparing requests to meet with Abrams, known for his strong record on civil rights, to &quot;asking someone who watched someone killed in the gas chamber to sit down with Mr. Hitler.&quot; When Roger L. Green, an influential Black member of the New York State Assembly, spoke out against language he perceived as unhelpful and needlessly divisive, Sharpton responded by calling him &quot;a state-sponsored Uncle Tom.&quot; On October 6, 1988, the grand jury released its 170-page report that concluded Brawley had not been abducted, assaulted, raped, or sodomized, as Brawley and her advisers said. The report further concluded that the allegations against Pagones were false and had no basis in fact. Before issuing the report, the grand jury heard from 180 witnesses, saw 250 exhibits, and recorded more than 6,000 pages of testimony.

In the decision, the grand jury noted many problems with Brawley&#x27;s story. Among these were that the rape kit results did not indicate sexual assault. Additionally, despite saying she had been held captive outdoors for days, Brawley was not suffering from hypothermia, was well-nourished, and appeared to have brushed her teeth recently. Despite her clothing being charred, there were no burns on her body. Although a shoe she was wearing was cut through, Brawley had no injuries to her foot. The racial epithets written on her were upside down, which led to suspicion that Brawley herself had written the words. Testimony from her schoolmates indicated she had attended a local party during the time of her supposed abduction. One witness claimed to have observed Brawley&#x27;s climbing into the garbage bag. The feces on her body were identified as coming from her neighbor&#x27;s dog. Brawley never testified, despite a subpoena ordering her to do so.

On June 6, 1988, Tawana&#x27;s mother, Glenda Brawley, was sentenced to 30 days in prison, and fined $250 for contempt of court for refusing to testify at the grand jury hearing. She evaded arrest by hiding in churches, with the police failing to arrest her, arguing it would lead to violence. The Brawley family then fled New York state, travelling around the country for several months before settling in Virginia Beach.

===Possible motives===
Much of the grand jury evidence pointed to a possible motive for Brawley&#x27;s falsifying the incident: trying to avoid violent punishment from her mother and particularly her stepfather, Ralph King. Witnesses testified that Glenda Brawley had previously beaten her daughter for running away, and for spending nights with boys. King had a history of violence that included stabbing his first wife 14 times, which later escalated into him shooting and killing her. There was considerable evidence that King could and would violently attack Brawley: when Brawley had been arrested on a shoplifting charge the previous May, King attempted to beat her for the offense while at the police station. Witnesses also described King as having talked about his stepdaughter in a sexualizing manner. 

On the day of her alleged disappearance, Brawley had skipped school to visit her boyfriend, Todd Buxton, who was serving a six-month jail sentence. When Buxton&#x27;s mother (with whom she had visited Buxton in jail) urged her to get home before she got in trouble, Brawley told her, &quot;I&#x27;m already in trouble.&quot; She described how angry King was over a previous incident of her staying out late.

Neighbors also told the grand jury that in February they overheard Glenda Brawley saying to King, &quot;You shouldn&#x27;t have took the money because after it all comes out, they&#x27;re going to find out the truth.&quot; Another neighbor heard Mrs. Brawley say, &quot;They know we&#x27;re lying, and they&#x27;re going to find out and come and get us.&quot;

In April 1989, &quot;New York Newsday&quot; published claims by a boyfriend of Brawley, Daryl Rodriguez, that she had told him the story was fabricated, with help from her mother, to avert the wrath of her stepfather. Writing about the case in a 2004 book on perceptions of racial violence, sociologist Jonathan Markovitz concluded that &quot;it is reasonable to suggest that Brawley&#x27;s fear and the kinds of suffering that she must have gone through must have been truly staggering if they were enough to force her to resort to cutting her hair, covering herself in feces, and crawling into a garbage bag.&quot;

==Aftermath==
 The case highlighted mistrust of legal institutions within the black community. Legal scholar Patricia J. Williams wrote in 1991 that the teenager &quot;has been the victim of some unspeakable crime. No matter how she got there. No matter who did it to her—and even if she did it to herself.&quot; These comments aroused controversy as well; Daniel A. Farber and Suzanna Sherry responded to Williams in their book &quot;Beyond All Reason: The Radical Assault on Truth in American Law&quot;, writing &quot;The radical multiculturalists seem unable or unwilling to differentiate between Brawley&#x27;s fantasized rape and another woman&#x27;s real one. Indifference to the distinction between fact and fiction minimizes real suffering by implying that it is no worse than imagined or self-inflicted suffering.&quot; 

Reviewing Spike Lee&#x27;s film &quot;Do the Right Thing&quot;, cultural critic Stanley Crouch wrote negatively of &quot;men like Vernon Mason who sold out a good reputation in a cynical bid for political power by pimping real victims of racism in order to smoke-screen Tawana Brawley&#x27;s lies.&quot; On May 21, 1990, Alton H. Maddox was indefinitely suspended by the Appellate Division of the State Supreme Court in Brooklyn after failing to appear before a disciplinary hearing to answer allegations regarding his conduct in the Brawley case. Vernon Mason was disbarred for 66 cases of misconduct in 1995; while the Brawley case was not specifically cited, Mason claimed that he was being punished for his role in promoting Brawley&#x27;s accusations.

In 1998 Pagones was awarded $345,000 through a lawsuit for defamation of character that he had brought against Sharpton, Maddox and Mason; Pagones initially sought $395 million. The jury found Sharpton liable for making seven defamatory statements about Pagones, Maddox for two and Mason for one. The jury deadlocked on four of the 22 statements over which Pagones had sued, and it found eight statements to be non-defamatory. In a later interview, Pagones said the turmoil caused by the accusations of Brawley and her advisers had cost him his first marriage and much personal grief.

Pagones also sued Brawley. She defaulted by not appearing at the trial, and the judge ordered her to pay Pagones damages of $185,000. The $65,000 judgment levied against Al Sharpton was paid for him in 2001 by supporters, including attorney Johnnie Cochran and businessman Earl G. Graves, Jr. In December 2012, the &quot;New York Post&quot; reported that Maddox had paid his judgment of $97,000 and Mason was making payments on the $188,000 which he owed. Brawley reportedly had not made any payments. The following month a court ordered her wages garnished to pay Pagones.

In a 1997 appearance Brawley maintained she did not invent the story; she still had supporters. In November 2007, Brawley&#x27;s stepfather and mother, in a 20th-anniversary feature for the &quot;New York Daily News&quot;, contended the attack happened. &quot;How could we make this up and take down the state of New York? We&#x27;re just regular people,&quot; Glenda Brawley said. They said they had asked New York State Attorney General Andrew Cuomo and Governor Eliot Spitzer to reopen the case. They also said that Brawley would speak at any legal proceedings. As of 2013, Brawley works as a nurse in rural Virginia, under a new name. Influenced by her interactions with Louis Farrakhan who had supported her, Brawley converted to Islam during the trial and, according to a &quot;NY Daily News&quot; report in November 2007, she remains a member of the Nation of Islam.

Michael Hardy, who served as Sharpton&#x27;s defense lawyer in Pagones&#x27; defamation case against him, would in 1991 become a prominent founder of Sharpton&#x27;s organization National Action Network, where he served as Executive Vice President and later also General Counsel.

<text>Sugarland is an American country music duo founded in Atlanta, Georgia. The duo consists of singer-songwriters Jennifer Nettles (lead vocals) and Kristian Bush (vocals, guitar, mandolin). They were founded in 2002, at which point Kristen Hall (vocals, guitar) was also a member. All three had experience in folk rock: Nettles had recorded in the groups Soul Miner&#x27;s Daughter and Jennifer Nettles Band, Bush had recorded two albums as one-half of the duo Billy Pilgrim, and Hall had recorded two solo albums. After Hall left in 2006, Nettles and Bush continued as a duo.

Signed to Mercury Nashville Records in 2004, Sugarland recorded four studio albums, one Christmas album, and one live album for that label between then and 2010. These albums accounted for fifteen singles on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot Country Songs charts, including the number-one singles &quot;Want To&quot;, &quot;Settlin&#x27;&quot;, &quot;All I Want to Do&quot;, &quot;Already Gone&quot;, and &quot;It Happens&quot;. Nettles was also a featured vocalist on rock band Bon Jovi&#x27;s late 2005-early 2006 single &quot;Who Says You Can&#x27;t Go Home&quot;, which also topped the country music charts. Their four studio albums for this label — &quot;Twice the Speed of Life&quot;, &quot;Enjoy the Ride&quot;, &quot;Love on the Inside&quot;, and &quot;The Incredible Machine&quot; — are all certified platinum or higher by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). The duo went on hiatus in 2012, during which time both Nettles and Bush recorded solo albums. They reunited officially in 2017 for &quot;Bigger&quot;, a studio album issued on Big Machine Records.

==Career==
===2004–2005: &quot;Twice the Speed of Life&quot;===
Singers Jennifer Nettles, Kristian Bush, and Kristen Hall were regulars in Atlanta&#x27;s folk-rock scene in the 1990s and early 2000s before Sugarland was formed, playing frequently at Eddie&#x27;s Attic in Decatur, Georgia, which Nettles&#x27; ex-husband owned for a time.

Sugarland&#x27;s debut album, &quot;Twice the Speed of Life&quot;, was released October 26, 2004. Serving as its lead-off single was the song &quot;Baby Girl,&quot; which peaked at No. 2 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot Country Songs charts and set a record for the longest chart run since the inception of Nielsen SoundScan in 1990; it was also the highest-peaking debut single for a group in 13 years. Also released from the album were the singles &quot;Something More&quot;, &quot;Just Might (Make Me Believe),&quot; and &quot;Down in Mississippi (Up to No Good),&quot; which peaked on the country charts at No. 2, No. 7, and No. 17, respectively. The album received Multi-Platinum certification for sales of three million copies, becoming their first album to achieve that status. In late 2005, the trio performed with Bon Jovi on Country Music Television&#x27;s musical fusion show, &quot;Crossroads.&quot; Nettles sang with Bon Jovi on their single &quot;Who Says You Can&#x27;t Go Home.&quot; The song later went on to become a No. 1 hit on the country charts. They toured the U.S. and Canada performing with Brad Paisley in 2005 and with Kenny Chesney on his &quot;Flip Flop Summer Tour&quot; in 2006–2007&quot;.&quot;

===2006–2007: &quot;Enjoy the Ride&quot;===

Kristen Hall left the group in December 2005. According to a statement released on January 17, 2006, by Nettles and Bush, Hall left the group to &quot;stay home and write songs.&quot;

Sugarland was nominated for the Best New Artist Grammy and performed the song &quot;Something More&quot; at the 48th Annual Grammy Awards on February 8, 2006. They also performed at the 2006 CMT Music Awards, where they received multiple nominations including Group/Duo Video of the Year for &quot;Just Might (Make Me Believe)&quot;, Breakthrough Video of the Year for &quot;Something More,&quot; and Collaborative Video of the Year for &quot;Who Says You Can&#x27;t Go Home.&quot; On November 7, 2006, the duo released their second album &quot;Enjoy the Ride.&quot; It sold 211,000 during its first week and opened at No. 4 on the US Top 200 and No. 2 on the Top Country Albums charts. It went on to become their second album to achieve multi-platinum status for selling three million copies. The first two singles from this album—&quot;Want To&quot; and &quot;Settlin&#x27;&quot;—both reached Number One on the country music charts, while &quot;Everyday America&quot; and &quot;Stay&quot; were both Top Ten hits. A limited-edition version of the CD, sold exclusively at Wal-Mart, was released in late 2007 and included a 5-song Christmas EP. The EP contained one original song—&quot;Little Wood Guitar&quot;— written by Bush and Ellis Paul. &quot;USA Today&quot; included the song in a list of new Christmas songs released in 2007 &quot;that might have some staying power.&quot;

In 2007, Sugarland performed at multiple award ceremonies, including the 2007 CMT Music Awards and the 2007 ACM awards. They performed a cover of Beyoncé Knowles&#x27; &quot;Irreplaceable&quot; at the American Music Awards. Knowles joined Sugarland on stage starting with the second verse. The performance drew some poor reviews with &quot;The Village Voice&quot; calling it &quot;a well-intentioned mess,&quot; although other critics also noted that the crowd enjoyed the performance.

They appeared on &quot;The Tonight Show,&quot; and late in the year, they headlined their first concert tour: the Change for Change Tour along with opening acts Little Big Town and Jake Owen. At the 41st CMA Awards, the group won the award for Vocal Duo of the Year.

Sugarland also appeared on a Sesame Street episode that first aired during Season 38 on September 14, 2007. During the segment, they performed &quot;Songs&quot; with Elmo. On November 26, 2007, they made a guest appearance in the &quot;Car&quot; episode of &quot;Yo Gabba Gabba!.&quot;

===2008–2009: &quot;Love on the Inside&quot;===

In February 2007, Nettles and Bush began recording &quot;Love on the Inside&quot; as a follow-up to &quot;Enjoy the Ride&quot;. The Deluxe Fan Edition was released on July 22, 2008, with the regular edition released one week later. The fan edition includes the duo&#x27;s collaboration with Little Big Town and Jake Owen, a cover of The Dream Academy&#x27;s 1985 hit &quot;Life in a Northern Town.&quot; It also introduces four other bonus tracks, including &quot;Fall Into Me,&quot; &quot;Operation: Working Vacation,&quot; &quot;Wishing,&quot; and a cover of Matt Nathanson&#x27;s &quot;Come On Get Higher.&quot;

The lead-off single was &quot;All I Want to Do&quot; (completely different from the Sheryl Crow song of the same title) which debuted at No. 27 on the country charts, the highest debut for the duo. In August 2008 the song became their third No. 1 single. The following single, &quot;Already Gone,&quot; released on September 8, 2008, became their fourth No. 1 in January 2009.
Sugarland started the &quot;Love on the Inside Tour&quot; on September 13, 2008, in Asheville, North Carolina. It was their second headlining tour. They were supported by Ashton Shepherd and Kellie Pickler and the tour concluded after 25 performances on November 16, 2008, in Bossier City, Louisiana.

In early December 2008, Sugarland received three Grammy Award nominations and performed on the 51st Annual Grammy Awards show on February 8, 2009. They won awards for Best Country Song and Best Country Performance by a Duo or Group.

On February 11, 2009, Sugarland received two nominations from the Academy of Country Music. They were nominated for Top Vocal Duo and Vocal Event of the Year for &quot;Life in a Northern Town.&quot; During the broadcast of the April 5, 2009 awards show, Sugarland was presented with the Vocal Duo of the Year award, ending Brooks &amp; Dunn&#x27;s nine-year run. Nettles also received a Milestone award, presented to her by Reba McEntire.

In March 2009, Sugarland toured in Europe starting with performances at military stations in Italy. They were scheduled to perform in France, the Netherlands, Germany, England, Scotland, and Ireland. Later in 2009 they joined Keith Urban in select cities as part of his Escape Together World Tour and joined Kenny Chesney on his Sun City Carnival Tour.
The third single from &quot;Love on the Inside,&quot; and 11th single overall, &quot;It Happens,&quot; was released in February 2009 and became their fifth No. 1 in May 2009. The album&#x27;s fourth single, &quot;Joey&quot; is a warning about drunk driving, encouraging those sober to &quot;take the keys,&quot; and thematically is heavily influenced by Concrete Blonde&#x27;s 1990 single of the same name. It peaked at No. 17 on the US country charts.

On May 19, 2009, Sugarland received five CMT Award nominations including a nomination for Video of the Year. They were presented the award for Video Duo of the Year at the award show that broadcast on June 16, 2009. During the awards show, they also performed &quot;Love Shack&quot; with a surprise appearance by the B-52&#x27;s.

On July 2, 2009, a performance that Sugarland recorded for Soundstage debuted on many PBS channels.

Sugarland&#x27;s first live DVD/CD &quot;Live on the Inside&quot; was released exclusively through Wal-Mart stores on August 4, 2009.

Sugarland released their first holiday album, &quot;Gold and Green&quot; on October 13, 2009. The album features five original songs and five traditional carols.

Country Universe, a country music blog website, published a list of the top selling country albums of 2009. Sugarland had four albums on the list with &quot;Love on the Inside&quot; (#10), &quot;Gold and Green&quot; (#149), &quot;Live on the Inside&quot; (#168), and &quot;Enjoy the Ride&quot; (#180).

===2010–2011: &quot;The Incredible Machine&quot;===

Sugarland&#x27;s &quot;It Happens&quot; was nominated for a Grammy Award in the category Best Country Performance by a Duo or Group With Vocals when nominees for 52nd Annual Grammy Awards were announced on December 2, 2009. They lost to Lady Antebellum&#x27;s &quot;I Run To You&quot;. During the awards show, Jennifer Nettles teamed with Jon Bon Jovi for &quot;Who Says You Can&#x27;t Go Home&quot;.

On February 1, 2010, Sugarland appeared with many other artists in the making of &quot;We Are the World: 25 for Haiti&quot; to benefit the Haiti earthquake relief efforts and the rebuilding of Haiti.

On September 10, 2010, Sugarland appeared on &quot;The Today Show&quot; and performed &quot;Stuck Like Glue&quot; – the first single from their album &quot;The Incredible Machine,&quot; which was released on October 19, 2010, in the U.S., Canada, and Australia. The album was released in the United Kingdom on February 7, 2011. Influences on the record included English electronic group Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark (OMD) and progressive rock musician Peter Gabriel.

The American Express concert series &quot;Unstaged&quot; pairs Sugarland with director Kenny Ortega for a performance from New York City streamed live on October 18, 2010.

On November 29, 2010, Jennifer Nettles hosted the first CMA Country Christmas during which Sugarland also performed two holiday songs from their Christmas CD, &quot;Gold and Green&quot;.

On December 5, 2010, Sugarland performed at &quot;The VH1 Divas Salute The Troops&quot; show, hosted by Kathy Griffin, which aired on VH1. Other performers included Katy Perry, Keri Hilson, Nicki Minaj, Paramore, and Grace Potter. Sugarland performed their country crossover single &quot;Stuck Like Glue,&quot; after an introduction by supermodel Marisa Miller and Jennifer Nettles&#x27; brother, a member of the Air Force.

It was announced on January 11, that Sugarland was the No. 5 selling country album of 2010 with &quot;The Incredible Machine&quot; and the No. 3 selling digital country track of 2010 with their single &quot;Stuck Like Glue.&quot;

Sugarland graced the stage of &quot;American Idol&quot; in March, performing the hit &quot;Stuck Like Glue.

On April 3, 2011, Sugarland hosted and performed at the first annual ACM Fan Jam during the ACM awards show. Sugarland was nominated for Vocal Duo of the Year and Video of the Year for &quot;Stuck Like Glue&quot;, and won for Vocal Duo of the Year at the 46th annual Academy of Country Music Awards. Nettles performed alongside pop star Rihanna at the ceremony, performing &quot;California King Bed&quot;.

&quot;Tonight&quot; is the second single released in the U.K. from &quot;The Incredible Machine&quot; as well as the third country radio single, released April 11.

In April 2011, Sugarland began a radio station, launched by A.P.E. Radio. The station is programmed by Nettles and Bush and allows fans to hear experiences from both singers&#x27; lives and their current musical endeavors.

The duo appeared at the 2011 CMT Music Awards, winning for &quot;Duo Video of the Year&quot; but losing to Taylor Swift&#x27;s &quot;Mine&quot; for video of the year. They also performed their donation song &quot;Stand Up&quot;.

The duo recorded the song &quot;Run&quot; with Matt Nathanson on his album &quot;Modern Love&quot; but Nettles and Bush are credited individually on the track.

====Indiana State Fair stage collapse====
On August 13, 2011, an outdoor stage collapsed due to high winds at the duo&#x27;s concert at the Indiana State Fair for their Incredible Machine Tour, killing seven people and injuring more than 45. Moments after the crash, Jennifer Nettles and Kristian Bush posted on their Twitter account: &quot;We are all right. We are praying for our fans, and the people of Indianapolis. We hope you&#x27;ll join us. They need your strength.&quot; Sugarland subsequently canceled their concert scheduled for the following day, August 14, 2011, at the Iowa State Fair. The band also posted a letter on their website explaining their resulting emotional experiences from the stage collapse, as well as a tribute for the families. Two months later, on October 28, 2011, Sugarland held a free benefit concert in honor of the victims of the stage collapse. One month later, on November 23, it was announced that forty-four lawsuits had been brought against Sugarland and a handful of organizations involved with the show, citing an unspecified damage amount for compensation.

====End of 2011====
2011 ended in a busy series of events for the duo, as they won Vocal Duo and performed &quot;Run&quot; with Matt Nathanson at the 2011 CMA awards, they performed with Lady Gaga at the Grammy Nominations Concert, a performance (as well as hosting duties for Jennifer) at the 2011 CMA Country Christmas Special, two nominations from the ACAs in the categories of Artist of the Year-Duo or Group and Single of the Year-Duo or Group for &quot;Stuck Like Glue,&quot; and finally they performed in Oslo, Norway on December 11 for the Nobel Peace Prize Concert.

On Saturday, November 26, 2011, Jennifer Nettles married her boyfriend of two years, Justin Miller, in a sunset ceremony at Blackberry Farms in East Tennessee. Miller, a former model was featured in the band&#x27;s 2006 hit song, &quot;Want To&quot;.

Sugarland took some time off at the beginning of 2012, to &quot;chill and relax and sleep in our own beds and contemplate how we want to approach what&#x27;s next.&quot;

===2012–2016: Hiatus and solo projects===
Sugarland&#x27;s Jennifer Nettles paired with Pepsi Max and recorded a commercial for Super Bowl XLVI. Nettles recorded Hank Williams&#x27; &quot;Your Cheatin&#x27; Heart&quot; which is featured in the commercial as a Coke Zero delivery man tries to buy a Pepsi Max without being discovered.

Sugarland recorded a song for the 2012 movie, &quot;Act of Valor&quot;. The soundtrack to the movie was released on February 21, 2012. The song is titled &quot;Guide You Home&quot;. Kristian Bush confirmed in late January that Sugarland will be touring in &quot;mid to late Spring&quot; and that they&#x27;re &quot;going to source our fans for our set list.&quot; On April 5, 2012, the duo commenced their fourth headlining tour: In Your Hands tour 2012. On June 18, it was announced that Nettles was pregnant and due in November, two months after their summer tour concluded. Her son, Magnus Hamilton Miller, was born on December 6, 2012.

With Nettles on maternity leave, Bush made his solo debut in March 2013 at the inaugural C2C: Country to Country Festival at the O2 Arena in London, England; his first song as a solo act, &quot;Love or Money,&quot; debuted on iTunes in Europe the following week. He often takes part in the Country Music Association&#x27;s Songwriters Series, which has included various appearances across the United States, as well as time spent abroad with the CMA&#x27;s first-ever international initiative showcasing Nashville songwriters and their work to foreign audiences in clubs and theaters.
In August 2013, Nettles released a solo single, &quot;That Girl&quot;, for Mercury. It is the lead single to her solo album of the same name, released on January 14, 2014. Rick Rubin produced the album. Her second album Playing with Fire was released in 2016 and, as Bush did in 2013, Nettles played the 2017 C2C: Country to Country Festival.

In 2014, Bush signed to producer Byron Gallimore&#x27;s Streamsound Records as a solo artist. His debut solo single, &quot;Trailer Hitch&quot;, was released to radio and retailers on July 28, 2014. His debut solo album, &quot;Southern Gravity&quot;, was released on April 7, 2015. He wrote 300 songs for the project, which he refers to as a &quot;mainstream country record that is meant to be played on the radio.&quot; Nettles released two solo albums in 2016, &quot;Playing with Fire&quot; on May 13, and &quot;To Celebrate Christmas&quot; on October 28.

===2017–2023: Reunion and &quot;Bigger&quot;===
In 2017, at the 51st Annual Country Music Association Awards, Bush and Nettles reunited to present the Vocal Duo of the Year award and announced that they were working on new music together as Sugarland. Their single &quot;Still the Same&quot; was released on December 21, 2017, and reached number 1 on the country iTunes charts as well as number 9 on the general iTunes chart. Their first official performance as a duo in over five years was at Dick Clark&#x27;s New Year&#x27;s Rockin Eve With Ryan Seacrest 2018 and their first full band shows were as part of the C2C: Country to Country festival in the UK and Ireland. On March 30, 2018, it was announced that Sugarland&#x27;s new album, &quot;Bigger&quot;, would be released on June 8, 2018. The album contains the song &quot;Babe&quot; featuring American singer-songwriter Taylor Swift. The song was written by Swift, which makes &quot;Babe&quot; the first song Sugarland has recorded that wasn&#x27;t written by Bush and Nettles. In March 2019 Sugarland ended their 15-year relationship with UMG Nashville and will now record exclusively for Big Machine Records. In December 2019 Sugarland signed with Big Machine Records exclusively they had signed a joint venture with their former label UMG Nashville and Big Machine in 2018, Nettles also records as a solo artist for Big Machine. Bush and Nettles resumed focusing on their solo careers following the release of &quot;Bigger&quot; and the subsequent tour. 

===2024–present: Little Big Town collaboration and tour===
In April 2024, they reunited for a performance of Phil Collins&#x27; &quot;Take Me Home, at the 2024 CMT Music Awards alongside Little Big Town. It was released as single the same day. Sugarland will be co-headlining the Take Me Home Tour with Little Big Town from October 24 to December 13, 2024. 

Sugarland released their EP &quot;There Goes the Neighborhood&quot; on August 9.

==Hall lawsuit==
Kristen Hall left the band unexpectedly in December 2005. According to both Bush and Nettles, Hall&#x27;s reason for her departure was to &quot;stay home and write songs&quot; and they both supported the decision. In July 2008, less than three years after Hall left Sugarland, she filed a lawsuit for $14 million against Bush and Nettles stating that she was being excluded from sharing profits as had been agreed upon after her departure. Hall claims to have coined the name of the band and allowed Bush and Nettles &quot;to obtain equal co-ownership of the trademark and service mark&quot;; Hall&#x27;s name is listed on the trademark for &quot;Sugarland&quot;. Both Nettles and Bush had countered Hall by stating that no profit-sharing agreement had been made with the duo before Hall&#x27;s departure. The lawsuit was eventually settled out of court in November 2010, although the details regarding the settlement agreement were not disclosed; both parties were given until December 13, 2010, to complete the agreement.

<text>Desert Diamond Arena (originally Glendale Arena and formerly Jobing.com Arena and Gila River Arena) is an indoor entertainment arena located in Glendale, Arizona, which anchors the 223-acre, $1 billion Westgate Entertainment District.

Located about northwest of downtown Phoenix, the arena was built east of Arizona Loop 101 (Agua Fria Freeway) and on the north side of West Maryland Avenue at a cost of $220 million. Owned by the City of Glendale and managed by ASM Global, Desert Diamond Arena is currently home to the Indoor Football League&#x27;s Arizona Rattlers (since 2024) and was home to the National Hockey League’s (NHL) Arizona Coyotes from 2003 until 2022. Since then it hosts concerts and other entertainment acts throughout the year. Desert Diamond Arena has a seating capacity of 17,125 for ice hockey, 18,300 for basketball and about 19,000 for concert events. The arena has 3,075 club seats and 87 luxury suites.

==History==
After the Winnipeg Jets relocated to Phoenix in 1996, they spent their first 7+ seasons playing at America West Arena (AWA) as the Phoenix Coyotes. AWA had been designed as the new home of the NBA&#x27;s Phoenix Suns only four years earlier, so it had to be quickly retrofitted for hockey. The arena floor was barely large enough to fit an NHL regulation size hockey rink and some seats on the upper level hung over the boards. That obstructed the views for up to 3,000 spectators. As a result, before the team&#x27;s second season in Phoenix, its hockey seating capacity was reduced from 18,000+ seats to 16,210 — then the second-smallest capacity in the NHL. After the Colorado Avalanche moved from McNichols Sports Arena into the Pepsi Center in 1999 and the Toronto Maple Leafs from Maple Leaf Gardens into the Air Canada Centre later that same season, America West Arena became the smallest NHL venue.

When the Coyotes were sold to a partnership led by Phoenix real estate developer Steve Ellman, they committed to build a new arena in the Phoenix suburb of Glendale. A lease agreement was signed with the City of Glendale in 2001, construction began on April 3, 2002, and the arena opened midway through the 2003–04 NHL season. The National Lacrosse League&#x27;s Arizona Sting hosted the first sporting event in the arena, a 16–12 2004 NLL season opening victory against the Vancouver Ravens on December 26, 2003. The next evening, the Phoenix Coyotes hosted their first game before a standing room-only crowd of 19,052 ending in a 3–3 tie against the Nashville Predators. Their first win in Glendale was on December 31, 2003, with a 4-0 victory over the Los Angeles Kings.

On August 19, 2021, the city of Glendale chose not to renew its contract with the team after the 2021–22 season, putting the franchise&#x27;s future in Arizona into question. The Coyotes announced they would be seeking to build a new venue in Tempe in response. The final Coyotes home game at the arena was played April 29, 2022, a 5–4 comeback win against the Nashville Predators. After the season, the Coyotes moved their home games to Mullett Arena at Arizona State University, where they played for the 2022–23 and 2023–24 seasons.

Two years after their move, it was discovered through a report in April 2024 that the team management did not bother to collect their belongings bearing the Coyotes branding, including Shane Doan&#x27;s jersey retirement banner. It was recovered by an arena worker, who gave it to Doan when the word surfaced days after the Coyotes&#x27; final NHL game.

===Concerts and events===
Desert Diamond Arena has hosted numerous concerts and events since opening in December 2003. A string of concerts in the arena’s inaugural year included performances by Prince, Rod Stewart, Toby Keith, Britney Spears, and Usher. Since then, other acts performing there included U2, RBD, Elton John, The Rolling Stones, Paul McCartney, Bruce Springsteen, Rage Against the Machine, Billie Eilish, Kenny Chesney, Mötley Crüe, Justin Timberlake, Katy Perry, The Eagles, Taylor Swift, The Weeknd, Harry Styles, Celine Dion, Coldplay, Eric Church, Justin Bieber, Kendrick Lamar, Ed Sheeran, Shawn Mendes, Sam Smith, Bon Jovi, Khalid, Madonna, Pearl Jam, Red Hot Chili Peppers, Usher, John Mayer, Tim McGraw, Faith Hill, The Killers, and For King &amp; Country.

Desert Diamond Arena events in recent years included &quot;UFC on Fox: Poirier vs. Gaethje&quot;, &quot;UFC 263: Adesanya vs. Vettori 2&quot;, Jake Paul vs. Anderson Silva, Nitro Circus Live, WWE Raw, WWE SmackDown, Stars on Ice, 2021 Gold Over America Tour, Street League Skateboarding, and WEC 53. The arena has hosted the traveling family-oriented shows Radio City Christmas Spectacular, Sesame Street Live, the Harlem Globetrotters and Cirque du Soleil.

Since 2005, the arena has hosted the Arizona state high school basketball, volleyball, wrestling and cheerleading tournaments in an event called &quot;February Frenzy,&quot; resulting from a formal agreement between the City of Glendale and the Arizona Interscholastic Association (AIA).

The highest grossing event in venue history was &quot;UFC 263: Adesanya vs. Vettori 2&quot; on June 12, 2021, with 17,208 guests in attendance and $4,281,800 in revenue.

The arena was the temporary home of the Arizona Rattlers arena/indoor football team when their home arena, the PHX Arena, was unavailable due to other events. It hosted the Arena Football League&#x27;s ArenaBowl XXIX in 2016, the Indoor Football League&#x27;s playoffs in 2019 and was scheduled to host the team&#x27;s IFL home season in 2020 prior to the COVID-19 pandemic in Arizona.

Prior to the 2018–19 season, the Coyotes purchased and installed the center-hung scoreboard that was formerly used by the defunct The Palace of Auburn Hills.

The arena was a regular stop for the Professional Bull Riders (PBR)&#x27;s Premier Series for several years. Since 2022, it has become the home of the PBR&#x27;s Arizona Ridge Riders during the PBR Team Series season held from the summer to autumn.

The Arizona Rattlers announced that they would be moving to Desert Diamond Arena in 2024, after using the arena as a temporary home previously. This gives the arena their first tenant after the Arizona Coyotes had left in 2022.

On February 19, 2025, it was announced that All Elite Wrestling would hold their Double or Nothing pay-per-view at the arena on May 25, 2025.

==Naming rights==
The arena was initially named &quot;Jobing.com Arena&quot; after a Phoenix-based employment website under a ten-year, $30 million contract established in October 2006.

The Coyotes terminated their agreement with Jobing.com and immediately announced a new nine-year naming and sponsorship deal on August 13, 2014, with Gila River Casinos — a group of tribal casinos that are controlled by the Gila River Indian Community. Former Coyotes President/CEO and Alternate Governor Anthony LeBlanc described the new agreement as the &quot;most significant deal&quot; made by the team under its new IceArizona ownership. With it, the Gila River community became the first federally recognized Native American tribe to hold a naming rights deal with a venue for one of the major professional sports leagues in the United States and Canada.

On August 23, 2022, the arena reached an agreement with Desert Diamond Casino to rename the arena as Desert Diamond Arena.

<doc id="753885" wikidata="Q5401315" url="?curid=753885" title="Esther Vanhomrigh">
<text>Esther Vanhomrigh or Van Homrigh (known by the pseudonym Vanessa; c. 1688 – 2 June 1723), an Irish woman of Dutch descent, was a longtime lover and correspondent of Jonathan Swift. Swift&#x27;s letters to her were published after her death. Her fictional name &quot;Vanessa&quot; was created by Swift by taking &quot;Van&quot; from her surname, Vanhomrigh, and adding &quot;Esse&quot;, a pet form of her first name, Esther.

She was fictionalized as &quot;Vanessa&quot; in Swift&#x27;s poem &quot;Cadenus and Vanessa&quot; (1713). In the poem, he wrote:

:&quot;Each girl, when pleased with what is taught,&quot;
:&quot;Will have the teacher in her thought.&quot;

==Life==
Esther was the daughter of Bartholomew Van Homrigh, a merchant of Amsterdam and afterwards of Dublin, who was appointed commissary of the stores by King William upon his expedition into Ireland: he was Lord Mayor of Dublin 1697–8. Her mother, also named Esther, was the daughter of John Stone, an Irish commissioner of revenue. She grew up at Celbridge Abbey in County Kildare.

Her father died in 1703, and his widow moved her family to London in 1707. Esther became acquainted with Swift in December of that year while the family was en route for London, at Dunstable, and it was here that their intense 17-year relationship began. She was 22 years younger than Swift, and it was obvious from the beginning that he admired Esther for her rugged qualities; he did not admire very delicate women. Esther was said &quot;not to be a beauty&quot;, although it is difficult to be sure about this since no contemporary portrait of her exists (the famous 1868 Millais portrait is a work of artistic imagination). Swift later served as her tutor. After her mother died in 1714, Esther followed Swift to Ireland, and returned to Celbridge Abbey, but she was desperately miserable there.

Their relationship was fraught. It was broken up after 17 years by Swift&#x27;s relationship with another woman, Esther Johnson, whom he called &quot;Stella&quot;, in 1723. Swift had known Stella since about 1690, when she was a little girl in the household of his employer Sir William Temple; their relationship was intense and it is possible that they had secretly married in 1716. Esther is thought to have asked Swift not to see Stella again, and he apparently refused, thus putting an end to their relationship.

Esther never recovered from his rejection and died on 2 June 1723, probably from tuberculosis contracted from nursing her sister Mary, who had died of the same disease in 1720, as had their mother before her; some accused Swift of inadvertently causing her death.

Her father had left her well provided for, but she was burdened by debts accumulated by her mother and her spendthrift brother Bartholomew. In her will, she named the barrister Robert Marshall and George Berkeley, the celebrated philosopher and future Bishop of Cloyne, executors and joint residuary legatees of her estate, although she knew neither man well. Due to the debts, a protracted lawsuit ensued and a large part of the estate was lost in legal costs. It was widely reported that she had made it a condition of the inheritance that her executors publish all her correspondence with Swift, but in fact, no such stipulation seems to have been made.

Swift, whose letters to her were published after her death, is not mentioned in her will, perhaps a final retaliation against a man whose neglect made her &quot;live a life like a languishing death&quot;.

==Legacy==

A ward in St Patrick&#x27;s University Hospital is named “Vanessa” in her honour.

Pre-Raphaelite artist John Everett Millais painted a fancy portrait of her in 1868, over 100 years after her death: &quot;Vanessa&quot;. The painting depicts Esther holding a letter, presumably written to or from Swift. The portrait is an imagined likeness: no contemporary portrait of Esther is known to survive and there are only a few rather vague descriptions of her appearance.

Margaret Louisa Woods wrote a novel inspired by her life titled &quot;Esther Vanhomrigh&quot; (1891).

Elizabeth Myers, wife of Littleton C. Powys, who was a brother of John Cowper Powys, wrote a novel titled &quot;The Basilisk of St. James&quot;, (London, 1945, Chapman and Hall), which has as its protagonist Jonathan Swift. Central to the plot is the personal conflict that arose from Swift&#x27;s relationships with both Esther Vanhomrigh (Vanessa) and Esther Johnson, nicknamed Stella by Swift.

In the 1994 film &quot;Words Upon the Window Pane&quot;, based on the play by William Butler Yeats, she is played by Orla Brady: the plot turns on a seance in Dublin in the 1920s where the ghosts of Swift, Stella, and Vanessa appear to resume their 200-year-old quarrel.

<text>Rice wine is an alcoholic beverage fermented from rice, traditionally consumed in East Asia, Southeast Asia and South Asia, where rice is a quintessential staple crop. Rice wine is made by the fermentation of rice starch, during which microbes enzymatically convert polysaccharides to sugar and then to ethanol. The Chinese &quot;mijiu&quot; (most famous being &quot;huangjiu&quot;), Japanese &quot;sake&quot;, and Korean &quot;cheongju&quot;, &quot;dansul&quot; and &quot;takju&quot; are some of the most notable types of rice wine. 

Rice wine typically has an alcohol content of 10–25% ABV, and is typically served warm. One panel of taste testers arrived at as an optimum serving temperature. Rice wines are drunk as a dining beverage in East Asian, Southeast Asian and South Asian cuisine during formal dinners and banquets, and are also used as cooking wines to add flavors or to neutralize unwanted tastes in certain food items (e.g. seafood such as fish and shellfish).

==History==

The production of rice wine has thousands of years of history. In ancient China, rice wine was the primary alcoholic drink. The first known fermented beverage in the world was a wine made from rice and honey about 9,000 years ago in central China. In the Shang Dynasty (1750-1100 BCE), funerary objects routinely featured wine vessels. The production of rice wine in Japan is believed to have started around third century BCE, after the introduction of wet rice cultivation. 

As a result of Alexander the Great&#x27;s expedition to India, the Roman Empire had begun importing rice wine by the first century BCE.

==Production==
Despite being called a &quot;wine&quot;, the rice wine&#x27;s production process has some similarities to that of brewing beer, reflecting its chief ingredient being a grain rather than a fruit. The specific approaches to making rice wine vary by type. Some rice wine (such as the Chinese rice wine, or Mijiu) is made from glutinous rice, while others (such as the Japanese Sake) is made from non-glutinous rice. However, all systems combine rice with some fungal culture in some ways. The fungal culture is called &quot;jiuqu&quot; in Chinese and &quot;koji&quot; in Japanese. In the traditional Chinese rice-wine-making approach, the glutinous rice is soaked for several days before being steamed, and subsequently is left to cool in a ceramic vat at near room temperature. Then, the jiuqu is added and mixed with the rice. The primary functions of &quot;jiuqu&quot; are to supply enzymes to convert starch to sugar and to supply yeast for ethanol production. After a few days, the liquid formed in the ceramic vat is combined with an additional mix of water and fungi to adjust the rice wine&#x27;s water content.

<doc id="753887" wikidata="Q1099181" url="?curid=753887" title="Clay Allison">
<text>Robert A. Clay Allison, also known as Clay Allison (September 2, 1841 – July 1, 1887) was a cattle rancher, cattle broker, and sometimes gunfighter of the American Old West. He fought for the Confederacy in the Civil War. Allison had a reputation for violence, having survived several one-on-one knife and gunfights (some with lawmen), as well as being implicated in a number of vigilante jail break-ins and lynchings. A drunken Allison once rode his horse through town nearly naked—wearing only his gunbelt. Later most reports stated that he was dangerous not only to others but to himself, accidentally shooting himself in the foot.

== Early life ==
Allison was born on September 2, 1841. He was the fourth of the nine children of Jeremiah Scotland Allison and his wife, Mariah Ruth (née Brown) Allison. His father was a Presbyterian minister who raised cattle and sheep to support the family. Allison helped on the family farm near Waynesboro, Tennessee, until the Civil War began, enlisting in the Confederate Army when he was 20.

==American Civil War==
On October 15, 1861, he enlisted with the Confederate States Army in Captain W. H. Jackson&#x27;s artillery battery. Three months later, however, he was medically discharged due to an old head injury hindering his ability to serve. On September 22, 1862, Allison re-enlisted, this time in the 9th Tennessee Cavalry Regiment, where he served under the Confederate &quot;Wizard of the Saddle,&quot; General Nathan Bedford Forrest. He surrendered at Gainesville, Alabama—along with Forrest&#x27;s men—on May 4, 1865 (at the war&#x27;s end). After briefly being held as a prisoner of war, Allison and the others were paroled on May 10, and allowed to return home.

==Post civil war==
Once back home, Allison was involved in several violent confrontations. A popular – possibly – story relates that a corporal from the 3rd Illinois Cavalry arrived at the Allison family&#x27;s farm with the intention to seize it. After a confrontation and the breaking of his mother&#x27;s vase (which had been an anniversary present to her from his father), Allison took a rifle from the house and killed the man. Whatever the reason, Clay Allison, along with his brothers Monroe and John, and sister Mary and her husband (Lewis Coleman), soon moved west.

In the New Mexico towns of Cimarron and Elizabethtown, Allison began to develop a reputation as a dangerous man during the Colfax County War. In the fall of 1870, a man named Charles Kennedy was being held in the local jail in Elizabethtown, accused of going mad and suspected in the disappearance of several strangers and his own son. A mob, led by Allison, broke into the jail, took Kennedy from his cell, and hanged him. When Kennedy&#x27;s house was later searched, the bodies of those missing (including his son), were found. Allegedly, Allison cut off the man&#x27;s head and carried it in a sack for 29 miles (47 km) to Cimarron, where he placed it on display on a pole in front of the St. James Inn. He believed himself fast with a gun, but this changed when he was outdrawn in a friendly competition with Mason Bowman. Bowman and Allison became friends, and Bowman helped Allison to improve his &#x27;fast-draw&#x27; skills.

At one point on October 31, 1878, Allison was entangled in a small skirmish with Comanches during the ongoing Texas-Indian War in Wheeler County, Texas. While riding, Allison came upon a small family home being besieged by Indians. After his request for assistance from the U.S. cavalry was denied, he personally collected a group of ranchers and cowboys to mount a rescue party. They charged at the Indians and killed one of them before the rest fled.

==Notoriety as a gunfighter==
On January 7, 1874, Allison killed a gunman named Chunk Colbert, who was known to have already fought and killed seven men by this time. After first racing their horses, Colbert and Allison entered the Clifton House, an inn located in Colfax County, New Mexico, where they sat down together for dinner. Colbert had quarreled with Allison years earlier, as Allison had physically beaten Colbert&#x27;s uncle, Zachary Colbert, when he tried to overcharge Allison for a ferry ride across the Brazos River. During their meal, Colbert suddenly drew his pistol and attempted to shoot Allison; however, the barrel of his gun struck the dinner table, allowing Allison to quickly draw his own revolver. He fired one shot, which struck Colbert in the head. Asked afterward why he had accepted a dinner invitation from a man likely to try to kill him, Allison replied, &quot;Because I didn&#x27;t want to send a man to hell on an empty stomach.&quot;
Allison&#x27;s reputation as a gunman grew, as did his notoriety.

On October 30, 1875, during the Colfax County War, Allison is alleged to have led a lynch-mob to kill Cruz Vega, who was suspected of murdering Reverend F.J. Tolby, a Methodist circuit-rider. The mob hanged the man from a telegraph pole near Cimarron. On November 1, Vega&#x27;s family members, led by his uncle Francisco Griego, began making threats of revenge. They went to the Lambert Inn (now the St. James Hotel), where they confronted Allison and accused him of taking part in the lynching. Griego reached for his revolver but Allison was faster and shot Griego twice, killing him. On November 10, Allison was charged with the murder of Griego, but after an inquiry, the charge was dropped and the shooting was ruled self-defense.

In December 1876, Allison and his brother, John, rode into Las Animas, Colorado, where they stopped at a local saloon. Constable Charles Faber of Bent County told the Allisons they needed to surrender their pistols, as an ordinance made it illegal to carry weapons inside the town limits. When the Allisons refused, Constable Faber left. He deputized two men and returned with them to the saloon. When the posse stepped inside, someone yelled, &quot;Look out!&quot; The constable and his men promptly opened fire. John Allison was hit three times (in the chest, arm, and leg). Clay Allison fired four shots, one of which killed Faber. The two deputized men fled. Both Allison brothers were arrested and charged with manslaughter, but the charges were dismissed as the constable had initiated the gunfight. 

===Alleged confrontation with Wyatt Earp===
In March 1877, Clay Allison sold his ranch to his brother, John. He relocated to Sedalia, Missouri, and eventually moved to Hays City, Kansas, where he established himself as a cattle broker. When he first arrived in Dodge City, Kansas, on business, his reputation had preceded him. Dodge City was a cattle town, and Wyatt Earp was the deputy marshal at the time. One time, several cowboys working for Allison were purportedly mistreated by the local marshal&#x27;s office. Earp and his biographer both claimed Earp and friend Bat Masterson confronted Allison and his men in a saloon, and that Allison backed down before them. However, Masterson was not in town at the time and there is no evidence the encounter ever took place. Earp did not make his claim until after Allison&#x27;s death. According to contemporaneous accounts, a cattleman named Dick McNulty and Chalk Beeson (owner of the Long Branch Saloon), convinced Allison and his cowboys to surrender their guns. Charlie Siringo, a cowboy at the time, but later a well-known Pinkerton detective, had witnessed the incident and left a written account. Siringo&#x27;s account relates that it was McNulty and Beeson who ended the incident; He further wrote that Earp had not even approached Clay Allison that day.

==1880s==
Allison maintained his ranch from 1880 to 1883 with his brothers, John and Jeremiah. Their ranch was 12 miles northeast of Mobeetie, Texas, at the junction of the Washita River and Gageby Creek in what was then Wheeler County, Texas (now Hemphill County, Texas). One story of the time tells of an intoxicated Allison riding through Mobeetie in the nude, wearing only his holster and revolver.

==Family life==
In Mobeetie, on February 15, 1881, Allison married America Medora &quot;Dora&quot; McCulloch (of Sedalia, Missouri).

By 1883, Allison had sold his ranch and moved to Pope&#x27;s Wells (a landmark along the Goodnight–Loving Trail), purchasing a ranch near the Pecos River crossing of the Texas-New Mexico line (50 miles northwest of Pecos, Texas).

Clay and his wife had two daughters: Patti Dora Allison (born August 9, 1885; Cimarron, New Mexico), and Clay Pearl Allison (born February 10, 1888; Pecos, Texas — seven months after her father&#x27;s death).

==Death==

Clay Allison died on July 1, 1887. He was hauling a wagon load of supplies when the load shifted, and a sack of grain fell from the wagon. Allison fell from the wagon as he tried to catch it, and a wagon wheel rolled over him, breaking his neck. He was 45 years old. Allison was buried the next day in Pecos Cemetery.

==Tributes==
In a special ceremony held on August 28, 1975, Clay Allison&#x27;s remains were re-interred at Pecos Park, just west of the Pecos Museum. His grave marker (which has the incorrect birth date of 1840), reads:
A second marker was later placed at the foot of the grave (see above); with the added phrase: &quot;He never killed a man that did not need killing&quot;.

<text>Chuvash ( , ; , , ) is a Turkic language spoken in European Russia, primarily in the Chuvash Republic and adjacent areas. It is the only surviving member of the Oghur branch of Turkic languages, one of the two principal branches of the Turkic family.

The writing system for the Chuvash language is based on the Cyrillic script, employing all of the letters used in the Russian alphabet and adding four letters of its own: Ӑ, Ӗ, Ҫ and Ӳ.

==Distribution==

Chuvash is the native language of the Chuvash people and an official language of Chuvashia. There are contradictory numbers regarding the number of people able to speak Chuvash nowadays; some sources claim it is spoken by 1,640,000 persons in Russia and another 34,000 in other countries and that 86% of ethnic Chuvash and 8% of the people of other ethnicities living in Chuvashia claimed knowledge of Chuvash language during the 2002 census. However, other sources claim that the number of Chuvash speakers is on the decline, with a drop from 1 million speakers in 2010 to 700,000 in 2021; observers suggest this is due to Moscow having a lack of interest in preserving the language diversity in Russia. Although Chuvash is taught at schools and sometimes used in the media, it is considered endangered by the UNESCO, because Russian dominates in most spheres of life and few children learning the language are likely to become active users.

A fairly significant production and publication of literature in Chuvash still continues. According to UNESCO&#x27;s &quot;Index Translationum&quot;, at least 202 books translated from Chuvash were published in other languages (mostly Russian) since ca. 1979. However, as with most other languages of the former USSR, most of the translation activity took place before the dissolution of the USSR: out of the 202 translations, 170 books were published in the USSR and just 17, in the post-1991 Russia (mostly, in the 1990s). A similar situation takes place with the translation of books from other languages (mostly Russian) into Chuvash (the total of 175 titles published since ca. 1979, but just 18 of them in post-1991 Russia).

==Classification==
Chuvash is the most distinctive of the Turkic languages and cannot be understood by other Turkic speakers, whose languages have varying degrees of mutual intelligibility within their respective subgroups. Chuvash is classified, alongside the long-extinct Bulgar, as a member of the Oghuric branch of the Turkic language family, or equivalently, the sole surviving descendant of West Old Turkic. Since the surviving literary records for the non-Chuvash members of Oghuric (Bulgar and possibly Khazar) are scant, the exact position of Chuvash within the Oghuric family cannot be determined.

Despite grammatical similarity with the rest of Turkic language family, the presence of changes in Chuvash pronunciation (which are hard to reconcile with other members of the Turkic family) has led some scholars to see Chuvash as originating not from Proto-Turkic but from another proto-language spoken at the time of Proto-Turkic (in which case Chuvash and all the remaining Turkic languages would be part of a larger language family).

Italian historian and philologist Igor de Rachewiltz noted a significant distinction of the Chuvash language from other Turkic languages. According to him, the Chuvash language does not share certain common characteristics with Turkic languages to such a degree that some scholars consider Chuvash as an independent branch from Turkic and Mongolic. The Turkic classification of Chuvash was seen as a compromise solution for classification purposes.

The Oghuric branch is distinguished from the rest of the Turkic family (the Common Turkic languages) by two sound changes: &quot;r&quot; corresponding to Common Turkic &quot;z&quot; and &quot;l&quot; corresponding to Common Turkic &quot;š&quot;. The first scientific fieldwork description of Chuvash, by August Ahlqvist in 1856, allowed researchers to establish its proper affiliation.

Some scholars suggest Hunnish had strong ties with Chuvash and classify Chuvash as separate Hunno-Bulgar. However, such speculations are not based on proper linguistic evidence, since the language of the Huns is almost unknown except for a few attested words and personal names. Scholars generally consider Hunnish as unclassifiable. Chuvash is so divergent from the main body of Turkic languages that some scholars formerly considered Chuvash to be a Uralic language. Conversely, other scholars today regard it as an Oghuric language significantly influenced by the Finno-Ugric languages. 

The following sound changes and resulting sound correspondences are typical:
Most of the (non-allophonic) consonant changes listed in the table above are thought to date from the period before the Bulgars migrated to the Volga region in the 10th century; some notable exceptions are the &quot;č&quot; &gt; &quot;ś&quot; shift and the final stage of the &quot;-d&quot; &gt; &quot;-ð&quot; &gt; &quot;-z&quot; &gt; &quot;-r&quot; shift, which date from the following, Volga Bulgar period (between the 10th-century migration and the Mongol invasions of the 13th century). The vowel changes mostly occurred later, mainly during the Middle Chuvash period (between the invasions and the 17th century), except for the diphthongisation, which took place during the Volga Bulgar period. Many sound changes known from Chuvash can be observed in Turkic loanwords into Hungarian (from the pre-migration period) and in Volga Bulgar epitaphs or loanwords into languages of the Volga region (from the Volga Bulgar period). Nevertheless, these sources also indicate that there was significant dialectal variation within the Oguric-speaking population during both of these periods.

== Comparison with Turkic languages ==
In the 8-10th centuries in Central Asia, the ancient Turkic script (the Orkhon-Yenisei runic script) was used for writing in Turkic languages. Turkic epitaphs of 7-9th centuries AD were left by speakers of various dialects (table):

* Often in the Chuvash language, the Common Turkic sounds of /j/ (&quot;Oghuz&quot;), /d/ (&quot;Karluk&quot;), /z/ (&quot;Kipchak&quot;) are replaced by /r/, example &quot;rhotacism&quot;:

Words for &quot;leg&quot; and &quot;put&quot; in various Turkic languages:

j - languages (Oguz): &quot;ajaq, qoj-&quot;

d - languages (Karluk): &quot;adaq, qod-&quot;

z - languages (Kypchak): &quot;azaq, qoz-&quot;

r - languages (Oghur): &quot;ura, hur- (dial. ora, hor-)&quot; 

* Often in the Chuvash language, the Turkic sound /q/ is replaced by /h/, example &quot;hitaism&quot;:

Comparison table

Сhitacism (Q &gt; H)
* The -h- sound disappears if it is the final sound of a syllable.

&quot;Dudaq - Tuta - Lips&quot; instead of &quot;Tutah&quot;

&quot;Ayaq - Ura - Leg&quot; instead of &quot;Urah&quot;

&quot;Balyq - Pulă - Fish&quot; instead of &quot;Pulăh&quot;

&quot;Ineq&quot; - &quot;Ĕne - Cow&quot; instead of &quot;Ĕneh&quot; 

* Turkic sound -j- (&quot;oguz&quot;) and -ž- (&quot;kipchaks&quot;) is replaced by chuvash -&quot;ş&quot;-, example:

Words in Turkic languages: &quot;egg, snake, rain, house, earth&quot;

Oguz: &quot;jumurta&quot;, &quot;jylan, jagmur, jurt, jer (&quot;turk., azerb., tat.,&quot;)&quot;

Kipchaks: &quot;žumurtka, žylan, žamgyr, žort, žer (&quot;kyrgyz., kazakh.&quot;)&quot;

Chuvash: &quot;şămarta, şĕlen, şămăr, şurt, şĕr&quot; 

* The Turkic sound -š- is replaced by the Chuvash -L-, example &quot;lambdaism&quot;:

Comparison table
* In the field of vowels, we observe the following correspondences: the common Turkic -a- in the first syllable of the word in Chuvash correspond to -u- and -o-.

In modern times, in Chuvash [a] remains, Tatar &quot;kapka&quot; ~ Chuvash &quot;hapha&quot; (gate), when there should be a &quot;&quot;hupha&quot; from the root &quot;hup - close&quot;&quot;.

* In the field of vowels, G. F. Miller observes another example when -u- is replaced by -wu- or -wă-

* The fricative -g- in some words in Chuvash corresponds to -v-

Comparison table

Ogur and Oguz

It is well known that the &quot;Oguz&quot; group of Turkic languages differs from the &quot;Kipchak&quot; in that the word “I” was pronounced by the Oguz&quot;es&quot; and Ogurs in ancient times by &quot;bä(n)&quot;, and the rest of the Turks - by &quot;&quot;män&quot;.&quot; Transition &quot;b &lt; m&quot;. There is such a difference in the modern Turkic languages of the Volga region:

tat., bash. &quot;Min&quot;, ogur/chuv. &quot;Epĕn&quot; (&lt; *pen), turk. &quot;Ben&quot;, eng. «&quot;I am&quot;»; 

tat., bash. &quot;Mең&quot;, ogur/chuv. &quot;Pin&#x27;,&quot; turk. &quot;Bin,&quot; eng. «thousand»; 

tat., bash. Milәš, ogur/chuv. Pileš, eng. «rowan»; 

tat. &quot;Мәçә&quot;, ogur/chuv. &quot;Pĕşi, Pĕşuk,&quot; az. &quot;Pišik,&quot; eng. «cat»; 

tat. &quot;Miçеү&quot;, ogur/chuv. &quot;Piçev,&quot; eng. «buckle» 

==Dialects==
The linguistic landscape of the Chuvash language is quite homogeneous, and the differences between dialects are insignificant. Currently, the differences between dialects becoming more and more leveled out.

Researchers distinguish three main dialects:

* Upper dialect (Viryal) - upstream of the Sura, preserves the /o/ sound in words like &quot;ot&quot; &quot;horse&quot;
* Middle dialect (mixed, transitional);
* Lower dialect (Anatri) - downstream of the Sura, changes the /o/ sound to /u/ in words like &quot;ut&quot; &quot;horse&quot;

The &quot;Upper dialect&quot; is closer to the Oguz, the &quot;lower dialect&quot; - which is closer to the Kipchaks.

The &quot;Malokarachinsky dialect&quot; is designated as occupying a separate position.

The literary language is based on both the Lower and Upper dialects. Both Tatar and the neighbouring Uralic languages such as Mari have influenced the Chuvash language, as have Russian, Mongolian, Arabic and Persian, which have all added many words to the Chuvash lexicon.

All dialects established to date have their own sub-dialects, which have their own exceptional features and peculiarities, thereby they are divided into even smaller dialect forms. It turns out a dialect matryoshka where there are basic dialects, and these dialects are divided in turn into sub-dialects.

The following dialect ramifications in the Chuvash language have been identified:


Phonetic differences:

a) All words of the Upper dialect (except exc. Kalinin-Alikov subgroup) in the initial syllable, instead of the &quot;lower&quot; sound -U- is used -O- for example:

In English: &quot;yes, six, found&quot;

in Turi: &quot;por, olttă, toprăm&quot;

in Anatri: &quot;pur, ulttă, tuprăm&quot;

b) In the upper dialect in the Sundyr sub-dialect, instead of the sound -ü- (used in all other dialects), the sound -ö- is used, which is a correlative soft pair of the posterior -o-, for example:

in English: &quot;hut, back, broth&quot;

in Turi: &quot;pӧrt, tӧrt, šӧrpe&quot;

in Anatri: &quot;pürt, türt, šürpe&quot;

с) In the upper dialect (in most sub-dialects) the loss of the sound -j- before the sonorant -l-, -n-, -r- and stop -t- is characterized, which in turn entails palatalization of these consonants, for example:

in English: &quot;russian woman, choose&quot;

in Turi: &quot;mar&#x27;a, sul&#x27;l&#x27;a&quot;

in Anatri: &quot;majra, sujla&quot;

d) In the higher dialect (for most sub-dialects), gemination of intervocalic consonants is characteristic, as in the Finnish language, for example:

in English: &quot;shawl, drunk, crooked&quot;

in Turi: &quot;tottăr, ĕssĕr, kokkăr&quot;

in Anatri: &quot;tutăr, üsĕr, kukăr&quot;

In general, gemination itself is the norm for the Chuvash language, since many historically root words in both dialects contain gemination, for example: &quot;anne (mather), atte (father), picche (brother), appa (sister), kukka (uncle), pĕrre (one), ikkĕ (two), vişşĕ (three), tvattă (four), pillĕk (five), ulttă (six), şiççĕ (seven), sakkăr (eight), tăhhăr (nine), vunnă (ten),&quot; etc. Some linguists are inclined to assume that this is the influence of the Volga Finns at the turn of the 7th century when the ancestors of the Chuvash moved to the Volga, there are those who disagree with this statement. In one of the subgroups of the Trans-Kama Chuvash, in the same words there is no gemination at all, for example, the word father is pronounced as Adi, and mother as Ani, their counting looks like this: &quot;pĕr, ik, viş, tvat, pül, şiç, sagăr, tăgăr, vun&quot; - but many scientists assume that this is a consequence of the influence of the Tatar language. They also have many words in the Tatar style, the word “hare - kuşana” (tat.kuyan) is “mulkach” for everyone, “pancakes - kujmak” for the rest is ikerchĕ, “cat - pĕşi” for the rest is “sash”, etc.

e) In the middle and upper dialects there are rounded vowels -ă°-, -ĕ°- (pronounced with the lips rounded and slightly pulled forward), in the lower dialect this is not observed, here they correspond to the standard sounds -ă-, -ĕ-.

f) In the upper and lower dialects, consonantism is distinguished by the pronunciation of the affricate sound -ç-. Among the upper Chuvash and speakers of the middle dialect, the sound -ç- is almost no different from the pronunciation of the Russian affricate; in the lower dialect it is heard almost like a soft -ç-, as in the Tatar language.

Morphological differences:

a) In the upper dialect there are synharmonic variants of the plural affix &quot;-sam/-sem,&quot; and in the lower dialect only &quot;-sem&quot;, for example:

in English: &quot;horses, sheep, meadows, cows, flowers&quot;

in Turi: &quot;lašasam, surăhsam, şaramsam, ĕnesem, çeçeksem&quot;

in Anatri: &quot;lašasem, surăhsem, şeremsem, ĕnesem, çeçeksem&quot;

b) In the upper dialect (in most sub-dialects) the affix of the possessive case is -jăn (-jĕn), the dative case is -ja (-je), while in the lower dialect -năn (-nĕn, -n), -na (-ne) , For example:

in Turi: &quot;lašaiăn, ĕnejĕn, lašaja, ĕneja, ĕneje&quot;

in Anatri: &quot;lašan(ăn), ĕnen(ĕn), lašana, ĕnene&quot;

c) in the upper dialect, affixes of belonging, with the exception of the 3rd person affix -i (-ĕ), have almost fallen out of use or are used extremely rarely. In the latter case, the 2nd person affix -u (-ü) of the upper dialect usually corresponds to -ă (-ĕ) in the lower dialect;

in English: &quot;your head, your daughter&quot;

in Turi: &quot;san puşu, san hĕrü&quot;

in Anatri: &quot;san puşă, san hĕrĕ&quot;

There is also a mixed type

d) In the upper dialect, the gemination of the temporal index -t- and -p- is used in the affixes of the 2nd person plural of the verb of the present tense, for example:

in English: &quot;are you reading, we are going&quot;

in Turi: &quot;esĕr vulattăr, epĕr pyrappăr&quot;

in Anatri: &quot;esir vulatăr, epir pyrapăr&quot;

The influence of Russian: &quot;we are going &lt; epir pyratpăr&quot;

There is also a mixed type, as already mentioned above.

e) In the upper dialect, the affix of the possibility of verbs -aj (-ej), due to contraction, turned into a sound -i:

in English: &quot;Couldn&#x27;t tell, couldn&#x27;t find out&quot;

in Turi: &quot;kalimarăm,pĕlimarăm , pĕlimerĕm&quot; 

in Anatri: &quot;kalajmarăm , pĕlejmerĕm&quot;

f) In the upper dialect, the singarmonic variant of the interrogative particle -i is common, in the dialects of the lower dialect, variants -a (-e) are used:

in English: &quot;Have you left? Do you know?&quot;

in Turi: &quot;esĕ kajrăn-i? esĕ pĕletĕn-i / es pĕletni?&quot;

in Anatri: &quot;esĕ kajrăn-a? esĕ pĕletĕn-e? es pĕletnĕ?&quot;

g) in the upper dialect, individual phrases turn into a complex word by shortening (contraction):

in English: apple tree, frying pan handle, earring, monkey, belt

in Turi: &quot;ulmuşşi (olmaşşi), şatmari, hălhanki, upăte, pişĕhe&quot; 

in Anatri: &quot;ulma jyvăşşi / jyvăşĕ&quot;, &quot;şatma avri, hălha şakki (ear pendant), upa-etem (bear-man), pilĕk şihhi (lower back tie)&quot;

Syntactic differences:

a) In the upper dialect (in most dialects), the adverbial participle -sa (-se) performs the function of a simple predicate, which is not allowed in the middle and lower dialects:

in English: &quot;I wrote&quot;

in Turi: &quot;Ep şyrsa&quot;

in Anatri: &quot;Epĕ şyrtăm&quot;

b) In the upper dialect, analytical constructions are used instead of the lower synthetic one:

in English: &quot;Go to lunch, It says in the newspaper&quot;

in Turi: &quot;Apat şima kilĕr, Kaşit&#x27; şinçe şyrnă&quot; 

in Anatri: &quot;Apata kilĕr, Xaşatra şyrnă&quot; 

There is also a mixed type.

Other lexical differences:

Another feature between the upper and lower dialects:

in English: &quot;We, you&quot;

in Turi: &quot;Epĕr, Esĕr&quot;

in Anatri: &quot;Epir, Esir&quot;

There are also those grassroots Chuvash (living in Kama) with a biting dialect who use the riding version of Epĕr, Esĕr. It has been established that the correct historical form is the pronunciation of &quot;Epĕr, Esĕr&quot;, A comparison with the Tatar Turkic languages, which are close to the Chuvash language, determined historical justice.

Ep / Epĕ - I , Epĕ+r - We

Es / Esĕ - You, Esĕ+r - You

Affixes -ĕr/-ăr are converted from singular to plural:

Epĕ şitrĕm - Ep+ĕr şitrĕm+ĕr / I got there - We&#x27;ve reached it

Epĕ şyrtăt - Ep+ĕr şyrtăm+ăr / I wrote - we wrote

Ham vularăm - Ham+ăr vularăm+ăr / I read it - we read it

There is no suffix in the Chuvash language &quot;+ir&quot; so this is a big mistake. No one says &quot;kiltĕm+ir&quot;, vularăm+ir&quot;, çitrĕm+ir&quot;. Don&#x27;t say &quot;Hamir turăm+ir&quot;. There is a dialect with pronunciation &quot;Ep+ĕr+ĕn&quot; - instead of &quot;Pir+ĕn&quot; (our), and &quot;Es+ĕr+ĕn&quot; - instead of &quot;Sir+ĕn&quot; (your) on this we can assume that their pronunciation was historical, because the structure is more correct, but because of what evolution it transformed into &quot;pirĕn/sirĕn&quot;.

Ep+ĕr pĕr+le - We are one

Es+ĕr ik+sĕr - The two of you

There are also very different words.

The dispute over the literary language

The modern Chuvash literary language was formed on the basis of a grassroots dialect, before this period an old literary language based on an upper dialect was in use. There are linguists who believe that the mother tongue was still the riding dialect of the Chuvash, when now it is considered to be the primary grassroots dialect. Their arguments are based on certain factors, here are some of them: 1) the migration of the Chuvash in the post-Horde period was from north to south, and not vice versa, the further they moved away from the root region towards the south and east, the more their language was subject to changes. Russian language was strongly influenced by the Kipchak languages (steppe raids), and after the settlement of Simbirsk by Russian people (at that time a very large city, much larger than Cheboksary), the dialect of the grassroots Chuvash in the area of Buinsk was strongly influenced by the Russian language, which is easily provable, all the most ancient records of the Chuvash language made by different travelers, such as G. F. Miller and others, contain words only of the upper-level dialect and not one of the lower-level. . 3) The U-dialect of the grassroots Chuvash is the influence of the Kipchak language, the O-dialect is the influence of the Oguz language. 4) One of the rules says that the sound -T- standing at the end of a borrowed word in Chuvash falls out, for example: &quot;friend - dust - tus, cross - krest - hĕres...&quot; The auslaut [t] is not pronounced in oral speech, it disappears in the position after the consonant [s] (the latter in this case is replaced by a soft [ş]): &quot;vlast&#x27; ~ vlaş, vedomost&#x27; - vetămăş, volost&#x27; - vulăs, pakost&#x27; - pakăş, sançast&#x27; - sançaş, oblast&#x27; - oblaş.&quot; In addition, the affixal [t] is not pronounced orally and in certain verb forms established as a literary language: &quot;pulmast&#x27; &lt; [pulmaş] ~ It doesn&#x27;t happen,&quot; the correct historical form: &quot;&quot;pulmas&quot;.&quot; As well &quot;kurmast&#x27; &lt; [kurmaş] ~ He doesn&#x27;t see it,&quot; the correct historical form: &quot;kurmas&quot;. As well &quot;kilmest&#x27; &lt; [kilmeş] ~ It doesn&#x27;t come,&quot; the correct historical form: &quot;kilmes&quot;. The historically correct affix is &quot;-mas/-mes&quot;, instead of &quot;-mast&#x27;/-mest&#x27; &quot;, which appeared as a result of the influence of the Russian language. As is known, the form with the ending &quot;-st&quot;&#x27; and &quot;-st&quot; is not peculiar to the Chuvash language by its nature, which means it is a late influence of the Russian language on the dialect of the lower Chuvash. Affixes: -mes/-mas, -mep/-map, -men/-man. 5) The letter T softens only when it is preceded by the sounds E, Ĕ, Ü, I, for example: kilet&#x27;, peret&#x27;, Üket&#x27;, Kĕtet&#x27;, if the letter T is preceded by the sounds A, Ă, O, Ü, then it does not soften Jurat, Kalat, Urat, Păhat, Kajat. In the grassroots dialect, all the end T&#x27;s soften. 6) A simple shortened address in the literary language has become unacceptable, only respectful treatment has been left with the correct pronunciation: Instead of &quot;Es juratan&quot; - &quot;Esĕ juratatăn&quot; - &quot;do you love&quot;. &quot;Ep pyrap&quot; - &quot;Epĕ pyratăp&quot; - &quot;I&#x27;m coming&quot;. 7) Instead of the supreme dialect &quot;Kaja&quot;pp&quot;ăr - Уходим, Uta&quot;pp&quot;ăr - Приходим, Vula&quot;pp&quot;ăr - Читаем&quot; , it is customary to write and speak in a grassroots dialect subject to Russification: &quot; Kaja&quot;tp&quot;ăr, Uta&quot;tp&quot;ăr, Vula&quot;tp&quot;ăr&quot;. Gemination as a primary phenomenon, as in the Upper, and not the influence from Finnish, is argued on the basis of the words: Anne - Mom, Atte - Dad, Šăllăm - Brother, Pĕrre - One, Şulla - Summer, Hĕlle - Winter ... 
*There is also a mixed type, where all variants of the case are used at once, this is especially noticeable in those settlements that arose at the turn of the 17th-20th centuries, such villages created by combining speakers of upper and lower dialects gave birth to a more universal dialect where both options were used .

==Writing systems==
===Official===
Letters in bold with light-yellow background are solely used in loanwords. 
==== Latin alphabet ====
Latin alphabet used by Chuvash people living in the USA and Europe, used for the convenience of writing Chuvash words
Examples of written text:

Transliteration of the Chuvash alphabet 
===1873–1938===
The modern Chuvash alphabet was devised in 1873 by school inspector Ivan Yakovlevich Yakovlev.

In 1938, the alphabet underwent significant modification which brought it to its current form.

===Previous systems===
The most ancient writing system, known as the Old Turkic alphabet, disappeared after the Volga Bulgars converted to Islam. Later, the Arabic script was adopted. After the Mongol invasion, writing degraded. After Peter the Great&#x27;s reforms Chuvash elites disappeared, blacksmiths and some other crafts were prohibited for non-Russian nations, the Chuvash were educated in Russian, while writing in runes recurred with simple folk.

==Phonology==
===Consonants===
The consonants are the following (the corresponding Cyrillic letters are in brackets): The stops, sibilants and affricates are voiceless and fortes but become lenes (sounding similar to voiced) in intervocalic position and after liquids, nasals and semi-vowels. Аннепе sounds like &quot;annebe&quot;, but кушакпа sounds like &quot;kuzhakpa&quot;. However, geminate consonants do not undergo this lenition. Furthermore, the voiced consonants occurring in Russian are used in modern Russian-language loans. Consonants also become palatalized before and after front vowels. However, some words like пульчӑклӑ &quot;dirty&quot;, present palatalized consonants without preceding or succeeding front vowels, and should be understood that such are actually phonemic: , , .
* can have a voiced allophone of .

===Vowels===

According to Krueger (1961), the Chuvash vowel system is as follows (the precise IPA symbols are chosen based on his description since he uses a different transcription).

András Róna-Tas (1997) provides a somewhat different description, also with a partly idiosyncratic transcription. The following table is based on his version, with additional information from Petrov (2001). Again, the IPA symbols are not directly taken from the works so they could be inaccurate.

The vowels ӑ and ӗ are described as reduced, thereby differing in quantity from the rest. In unstressed positions, they often resemble a schwa or tend to be dropped altogether in fast speech. At times, especially when stressed, they may be somewhat rounded and sound similar to and .

Additionally, (о) occurs in loanwords from Russian where the syllable is stressed in Russian.

===Word accent===
The usual rule given in grammars of Chuvash is that the last full (non-reduced) vowel of the word is stressed; if there are no full vowels, the first vowel is stressed. Reduced vowels that precede or follow a stressed full vowel are extremely short and non-prominent. One scholar, Dobrovolsky, however, hypothesises that there is in fact no stress in disyllabic words in which both vowels are reduced.

=== Morphonology ===

==== Vowel harmony ====
Vowel harmony is the principle by which a native Chuvash word generally incorporates either exclusively back or hard vowels (а, ӑ, у, ы) and exclusively front or soft vowels (е, ӗ, ӳ, и). As such, a Chuvash suffix such as -тен means either -тан or -тен, whichever promotes vowel harmony; a notation such as -тпӗр means either -тпӑр, -тпӗр, again with vowel harmony constituting the deciding factor.

Chuvash has two classes of vowels: &quot;front&quot; and &quot;back&quot; (see the table above). Vowel harmony states that words may not contain both front and back vowels. Therefore, most grammatical suffixes come in front and back forms, e.g. Шупашкарта, &quot;in Cheboksary&quot; but килте, &quot;at home&quot;.

Two vowels cannot occur in succession.

===== Exceptions =====

Vowel harmony does not apply for some invariant suffixes such as the plural ending -сем and the 3rd person (possessive or verbal) ending -ӗ, which only have a front version. It also does not occur in loanwords and in a few native Chuvash words (such as анне &quot;mother&quot;). In such words suffixes harmonize with the final vowel; thus Аннепе &quot;with the mother&quot;.

Compound words are considered separate words with respect to vowel harmony: vowels do not have to harmonize between members of the compound (so forms like сӗтел|пукан &quot;furniture&quot; are permissible).

==== Other processes ====
The consonant т often alternates with ч before ӗ from original *&quot;i&quot; (ят &#x27;name&#x27; - ячӗ &#x27;his name&#x27;). There is also an alternation between т (after consonants) and р (after vowels): тетел &#x27;fishing net (nom.)&#x27; - dative тетел-те, but пулӑ &#x27;fish (nom.)&#x27; - dative пулӑ-ра.

Consonants

Voiceless consonant sounds, if they stand in the middle and end of words become voiced:

Geminated voiceless consonants are not voiced:

&quot;ikkĕ - two, piççe - brother, sakkăr - eight, appa - sister.&quot;

==Grammar==
As characteristic of all Turkic languages, Chuvash is an agglutinative language and as such, has an abundance of suffixes but no native prefixes or prepositions, apart from the partly reduplicative intensive prefix, such as in: - &quot;white&quot;, - &quot;snow-white&quot;, - &quot;black&quot;, - &quot;jet black&quot;, - &quot;flat&quot;, - &quot;absolutely flat&quot;, - &quot;full&quot;, - &quot;chock full&quot; (compare to Turkish - &quot;white&quot;, &quot;snow-white&quot;, - &quot;black&quot;, - &quot;jet black&quot;, - &quot;flat&quot;, - &quot;absolutely flat&quot;, - &quot;full&quot;, - &quot;chock full&quot;). One word can have many suffixes, which can also be used to create new words like creating a verb from a noun or a noun from a verbal root. See Vocabulary below. It can also indicate the grammatical function of the word.

Chuvash nouns decline in number and case and also take suffixes indicating the person of a possessor. The suffixes are placed in the order possession - number - case. There are six noun cases in the Chuvash declension system:

In the suffixes where the first consonant varies between р- and т-, the allomorphs beginning in т- are used after stems ending in the dental sonorants -р, -л and -н. The allomorphs beginning in р- occur under all other circumstances. The dative-accusative allomorph beginning in н- is mostly used after stems ending in vowels, except in -и, -у, and -ӑ/-ӗ, whereas the one consisting only of a vowel is used after stems ending in consonants.

The nominative is used instead of the dative-accusative to express indefinite or general objects, e.g. утӑ типӗт &#x27;to dry hay&#x27;. It can also be used instead of the genitive to express a possessor, so that the combination gets a generalised compound-like meaning (лаша пӳҫӗ &#x27;a horse head&#x27; vs лашан пӳҫӗ &#x27;the horse&#x27;s head&#x27;); with both nominative and genitive, however, the possessed noun has a possessive suffix (see below).

In the genitive and dative-accusative cases, some nouns ending in -у and -ӳ were changed to -ӑв and -ӗв (ҫыру → ҫырӑван, ҫырӑва, but ҫырура; пӳ → пӗвен, пӗве, but пӳре). In nouns ending in -ӑ, the last vowel simply deletes and may cause the last consonant to geminate (пулӑ &#x27;fish&#x27; &gt; пуллан). Nouns ending in consonants sometimes also geminate the last letter (ҫын &#x27;man&#x27; → ҫыннан).

There are also some rarer cases, such as:
* Terminative–antessive (to), formed by adding -(ч)чен
* relic of distributive, formed by adding -серен: кунсерен &quot;daily, every day&quot;, килсерен &quot;per house&quot;, килмессерен &quot;every time one comes&quot;
* Semblative (as), formed by adding пек to pronouns in genitive or objective case (ман пек, &quot;like me&quot;, сан пек, &quot;like you&quot;, ун пек, &quot;like him, that way&quot;, пирӗн пек, &quot;like us&quot;, сирӗн пек, &quot;like you all&quot;, хам пек, &quot;like myself&quot;, хӑвӑн пек, &quot;like yourself&quot;, кун пек, &quot;like this&quot;); adding -ла, -ле to nouns (этемле, &quot;humanlike&quot;, ленинла, &quot;like Lenin&quot;)
* Postfix: ха (ha); adding -шкал, -шкел to nouns in the dative (actually a postposition, but the result is spelt as one word: унашкал &#x27;like that&#x27;).

Taking кун (day) as an example:

Possession is expressed by means of constructions based on verbs meaning &quot;to exist&quot; and &quot;not to exist&quot; (&quot;пур&quot; and &quot;ҫук&quot;). For example, to say, &quot;The cat had no shoes&quot;:
: 

which literally translates as &quot;cat-of foot-cover(of)-plural-his non-existent-was.&quot;

The possessive suffixes are as follows (ignoring vowel harmony):
Stem-final vowels are deleted when the vowel-initial suffixes (-у, -и, -ӑр) are added to them. The 3rd person allomorph -ӗ is added to stems ending in consonants, whereas -и is used with stems ending in vowels. There is also another postvocalic variant -шӗ, which is used only in designations of family relationships: аппа &#x27;elder sister&#x27; &gt; аппа-шӗ. Furthermore, the noun атте &#x27;father&#x27; is irregularly declined in possessive forms:
When case endings are added to the possessive suffixes, some changes may occur: the vowels comprising the 2nd and 3rd singular possessive suffixes are dropped before the dative-accusative suffix: (ывӑл-у-на &#x27;to your son&#x27;, ывӑл-ӗ-нe &#x27;to his son&#x27; &gt; ывӑлна, ывӑлнe), whereas a -н- is inserted between them and the locative and ablative suffixes: ывӑл-у-н-та &#x27;in/at your son&#x27;, ывӑл-ӗ-н-чен &#x27;from his son&#x27;.

====Adjectives====
Adjectives do not agree with the nouns they modify, but may receive nominal case endings when standing alone, without a noun. The comparative suffix is -рах/-рех, or -тарах/терех after stems ending in -р or, optionally, other sonorant consonants. The superlative is formed by encliticising or procliticising the particles чи or чӑн to the adjective in the positive degree. A special past tense form meaning &#x27;(subject) was A&#x27; is formed by adding the suffix -(ч)чӗ. Another notable feature is the formation of intensive forms via complete or partial reduplication: кǎтра &#x27;curly&#x27; - кǎп-кǎтра &#x27;completely curly&#x27;.

====The &#x27;separating&#x27; form====

Both nouns and adjectives, declined or not, may take special &#x27;separating&#x27; forms in -и (causing gemination when added to reduced vowel stems and, in nouns, when added to consonant-final stems) and -скер. The meaning of the form in -и is, roughly, &#x27;the one of them that is X&#x27;, while the form in -скер may be rendered as &#x27;(while) being X&#x27;. For example, пӳлӗм-р(е)-и-сем &#x27;those of them who are in the room&#x27;. The same suffixes may form the equivalent of dependent clauses: ачисем килте-скер-ӗн мӗн хуйхӑрмалли пур унӑн? &#x27;If his children (are) at home, what does he have to be sad about?&#x27;, йӗркеллӗ çынн-и курӑнать &#x27;You (can) see that he is a decent person&#x27;, эсӗ килт(e)-и савӑнтарать (lit. &#x27;That you are at home, pleases one&#x27;).

==== Pronouns ====
The personal pronouns exhibit partly suppletive allomorphy between the nominative and oblique stems; case endings are added to the latter:
Demonstratives are ку &#x27;this&#x27;, çак &#x27;this&#x27; (only for a known object), çав &#x27;that&#x27; (for a somewhat remote object), леш &#x27;that&#x27; (for a remote object), хай &#x27;that&#x27; (the above-mentioned). There is a separate reflexive originally consisting of the stem in х- and personal possessive suffixes:

Interrogatives are кам &#x27;who&#x27;, мӗн &#x27;what&#x27;, хаш/хӑшӗ &#x27;which&#x27;. Negative pronouns are formed by adding the prefix ни- to the interrogatives: никам, ним(ӗн), etc. Indefinite pronouns use the prefix та-: такам etc. Totality is expressed by пур &#x27;all&#x27;, пӗтӗм &#x27;whole&#x27;, харпӑр &#x27;every&#x27;.

Among the pronominal adverbs that are not productively formed from the demonstratives, notable ones are the interrogatives хăçан &#x27;when&#x27; and ăçта &#x27;where&#x27;.

===Verbs===
Chuvash verbs exhibit person and can be made negative or impotential; they can also be made potential. Finally, Chuvash verbs exhibit various distinctions of tense, mood and aspect: a verb can be progressive, necessitative, aorist, future, inferential, present, past, conditional, imperative or optative.

The sequence of verbal suffixes is as follows: voice - iterativity - potentiality - negation - tense/gerund/participle - personal suffix.

==== Finite verb forms ====
The personal endings of the verb are mostly as follows (abstracting from vowel harmony):

The 1st person allomorph containing -п- is found in the present and future tenses, the one containing -м- is found in other forms. The 3rd singular is absent in the future and in the present tenses, but causes palatalisation of the preceding consonant in the latter. The vowel-final allomorph of the 3rd plural -ҫӗ is used in the present. The imperative has somewhat more deviant endings in some of its forms:
To these imperative verb forms, one may add particles expressing insistence (-сам) or, conversely, softness (-ччӗ) and politeness (-ах).

The main tense markers are:

The consonant -т of the present tense marker assimilates to the 3rd plural personal ending: -ҫҫĕ. The past tense allomorph -р- is used after vowels, while -т- is used after consonants. The simple past tense is used only for witnesses events, whereas retold events are expressed using the past participle suffix -н(ӑ) (see below). In addition to the iterative past, there is also an aspectual iterative suffix -кала- expressing repetitive action.

There are also modal markers, which do not combine with tense markers and hence have sometimes been described as tenses of their own:

The concessive suffix -ин is added after the personal endings, but in the 2nd singular and plural, a -с- suffix is added &quot;before&quot; them: кур-ӑ-сӑн(-ин) &#x27;alright, see it&#x27;. If the particle -ччӗ is added, the meaning becomes optative.

Potentiality is expressed with the suffix -(а)й &#x27;be able to&#x27;.

The negative is expressed by a suffix inserted before the tense and modal markers. It contains -м- and mostly has the form -м(а)-, but -мас- in the present and -мӑ- in the future. The imperative uses the proclitic particle ан instead (or, optionally, an enclitic мар in the 1st person).

A change of valency to a passive-reflexive &#x27;voice&#x27; may be effected by the addition of the suffixes -ӑл- and -ӑн-, but the process is not productive and the choice of suffix is not predictable. Still, if both occur with the same stem, -ӑл- is passive and -ӑн- is reflexive. A &#x27;reciprocal voice&#x27; form is produced by the suffixes -ӑш and -ӑҫ. There are two causative suffixes - a non-productive -ат/ар/ӑт and a productive -(т)тар (the single consonant allomorph occurring after monosyllabic stems).

There are, furthermore, various periphrastic constructions using the non-finite verb forms, mostly featuring predicative use of the participles (see below).

==== Non-finite verb forms ====
Some of the non-finite verb forms are:

I. Attributive participles

# Present participle: -акан (вӗренекен &#x27;studying&#x27; or &#x27;being studied&#x27;); the negative form is the same as that of the past participle (see below);
# Past participle: -н(ӑ) (курнӑ &#x27;which has seen&#x27; or &#x27;which has been seen&#x27;); the final vowel disappears in the negative (курман)
# Future participle: -ас (каяс &#x27;who will go&#x27;)
# Present participle expressing a permanent characteristic: -ан (вӗҫен &#x27;flying&#x27;)
# Present participle expressing pretence: -анҫи, -иш
# Necessitative participle: -малла (пулмалла &#x27;who must become&#x27;); the negative is formed by adding the enclitic мар
# Satisfaction participle: -малӑх (вуламалӑх &#x27;which is enough to be read&#x27;)
# Potentiality participle: -и (ути &#x27;which can go&#x27;)

The suffix -и may be added to participles to form a verbal noun: ҫыр-нӑ ;&#x27;written&#x27; &gt; ҫыр-н-и &#x27;writing&#x27;.

II. Adverbial participles (converbs)

# -са (default: doing, having done, while about to do&#x27;) (-сар after a negative suffix)
# -а &#x27;doing Y&#x27; (the verb form is usually reduplicated)
# -нӑҫем(-ен) &#x27;the more the subject does Y&#x27;: 
# -уҫӑн &#x27;while doing Y&#x27;
# -сан &#x27;having done Y&#x27;, &#x27;if the subject does Y&#x27;
# -нӑранпа &#x27;after/since having done Y&#x27;
# -массерен &#x27;whenever the subject does Y&#x27;
# -иччен &#x27;before/until doing Y&#x27;

III. Infinitives

The suffixes -ма and -машкӑн form infinitives.

There are many verbal periphrastic constructions using the non-finite forms, including:
# a habitual past using the present participle and expressing periodicity (эпĕ вулакан-ччĕ, lit. &#x27;I was [a] reading [one]&#x27;);
# an alternative pluperfect using the past participle (эпĕ чĕннĕ-ччĕ, lit. &#x27;I [was] one that had called&#x27;; negated by using the negatively conjugated participle эпĕ чĕнмен-ччĕ);
# a general present equal to the present participle (эпĕ ҫыракан, lit. &#x27;I [am a] writing [one]&#x27;; negated with the enclitic мар), 
# an alternative future expressing certainty and equal to the future participle (эпĕ илес &#x27;I [am] one who will get&#x27;; negated with an encliticised ҫук),
# a necessitative future using the necessitative participle (ман/эпĕ тарант(ар)малла &#x27;I [am] one who must feed&#x27;; negated with мар), 
# a second desiderative future expressing a wish and using the converb in -сан (эпĕ ҫĕнтерсен-ччĕ, &#x27;I wish I&#x27;d win&#x27;), 
# another desiderative form expressing a wish for the future and using the future participle followed by -чĕ (эпĕ пĕлес-чĕ &#x27;I wish/hope I know&#x27;, negated by мар with an encliticised -ччĕ).

===Word order===
Word order in Chuvash is generally subject–object–verb. Modifiers (adjectives and genitives) precede their heads in nominal phrases, too. The language uses postpositions, often originating from case-declined nouns, but the governed noun is usually in the nominative, e.g. тĕп çи-не &#x27;onto (the surface of) the ground&#x27; (even though a governed &quot;pronoun&quot; tends to be in the genitive). Yes/no-questions are formed with an encliticised interrogative particle -и. The language often uses verb phrases that are formed by combining the adverbial participle in -са and certain common verbs such as пыр &#x27;go&#x27;, çӳре &#x27;be going&#x27;, кай &#x27;go (away from the speaker)&#x27;, кил &#x27;go (towards the speaker)&#x27;, ил &#x27;take&#x27;, кала &#x27;say&#x27;, тăр &#x27;stand&#x27;, юл &#x27;stay&#x27;, яр &#x27;let go&#x27;; e.g. кĕрсe кай &#x27;go entering &gt; enter&#x27;, тухса кай &#x27;go exiting &gt; leave&#x27;.

==Numerals==
The number system is decimal. The numbers from one to ten are:
* 1 – pĕrre &quot;(пӗрре)&quot;, pĕr &quot;(пӗр)&quot;
* 2 – ikkĕ &quot;(иккӗ),&quot; ikĕ &quot;(икӗ)&quot;, ik &quot;(ик)&quot;
* 3 – wişşĕ &quot;(виҫҫӗ)&quot;, wişĕ &quot;(виҫӗ)&quot;, wiş &quot;(виҫ)&quot;
* 4 – tăwattă &quot;(тӑваттӑ&quot;) tvată &quot;(тватӑ)&quot;, tăwat &quot;(тӑват),&quot; tvat &quot;(тват)&quot;
* 5 – pillĕk &quot;(пиллӗк)&quot;, pilĕk &quot;(пилӗк),&quot; pil &quot;(пил)&quot;
* 6 – ulttă &quot;(улттӑ)&quot;, , ultă &quot;(ултӑ)&quot;, , ult &quot;(улт)&quot;, /
* 7 – şiççĕ &quot;(ҫиччӗ)&quot;, , şiçĕ &quot;(ҫичӗ)&quot;, , şiç &quot;(ҫич)&quot;, 
* 8 – sakkăr &quot;(саккӑр)&quot;, , sakăr &quot;(сакӑр)&quot;, 
* 9 – tăhhăr &quot;(тӑххӑр)&quot;, tăhăr &quot;(тӑхӑр)&quot;
* 10 – wunnă &quot;(вуннӑ)&quot;, wun &quot;(вун)&quot;

The teens are formed by juxtaposing the word &#x27;ten&#x27; and the corresponding single digit:
* 11 – wun pĕr &quot;(вун пӗр)&quot;
* 12 – wun ikkĕ &quot;(вун иккӗ)&quot;, wun ikĕ &quot;(вун икӗ)&quot;, wun ik &quot;(вун ик)&quot;
* 13 – wun vişşĕ &quot;(вун виҫҫӗ)&quot;, wun vişĕ &quot;(вун виҫӗ)&quot;, wun viş &quot;(вун виҫ)&quot;
* 14 – wun tăwattă &quot;(вун тӑваттӑ)&quot;, wun tvată &quot;(вун тватӑ)&quot;, wun tvat &quot;(вун тват)&quot;
* 15 – wun pillĕk &quot;(вун пиллӗк)&quot;, wun pilĕk &quot;(вун пилӗк)&quot;, wun pil &quot;(вун пил)&quot;
* 16 – wun ulttă &quot;(вун улттӑ)&quot;, wun ultă &quot;(вун ултӑ)&quot;, wun ult &quot;(вун улт)&quot;
* 17 – wun şiççĕ &quot;(вун ҫиччӗ)&quot;, wun şiçĕ &quot;(вун ҫичӗ)&quot;, wun şiç &quot;(вун ҫич)&quot;
* 18 – wun sakkăr &quot;(вун саккӑр)&quot;, wun sakăr &quot;(вун сакӑр)&quot;
* 19 – wun tăhhăr &quot;(вун тӑххӑр)&quot;, wun tăhăr &quot;(вун тӑхӑр)&quot;

The tens are formed in somewhat different ways: from 20 to 50, they exhibit suppletion; 60 and 70 have a suffix -мӑл together with stem changes; while 80 and 90 juxtapose the corresponding single digit and the word &#x27;ten&#x27;.
* 20 – şirĕm &quot;(ҫирӗм)&quot;
* 30 – wătăr &quot;(вӑтӑр)&quot;
* 40 – hĕrĕh &quot;(хӗрӗх)&quot;
* 50 – allă &quot;(аллӑ)&quot;, ală &quot;(алă)&quot;, al &quot;(ал)&quot;
* 60 – utmăl &quot;(утмӑл)&quot;
* 70 – şitmĕl &quot;(ҫитмӗл)&quot;
* 80 – sakăr wunnă &quot;(сакӑр вуннӑ)&quot;, sakăr wun &quot;(сакӑр вун)&quot;
* 90 – tăhăr wunnă &quot;(тӑхӑр вуннӑ)&quot;, tăhăr wun &quot;(тӑхӑр вун)&quot;

Further multiples of ten are:
* 100 – şĕr &quot;(ҫĕр)&quot;
* 1000 – pin &quot;(пин)&quot;
* Example: - sakăr şĕr wătăr tvată pin te ik şĕr wătăr ulttă &quot;(сакӑр ҫӗр вӑтӑр тӑватӑ пин те ик ҫӗр вӑтӑр улттӑ)&quot;, 

Ordinal numerals are formed with the suffix -mĕš (&quot;-мӗш)&quot;, e.g. pĕrremĕš &quot;(пӗррӗмӗш)&quot; &#x27;first&#x27;, ikkĕmĕš &quot;(иккӗмӗш)&quot; &#x27;second&#x27;. There are also alternate ordinal numerals formed with the suffix -ӑм/-ĕм, which are used only for days, nights and years and only for the numbers from three to seven, e.g. wişĕm &quot;(виҫӗм)&quot; &#x27;third&#x27;, tvatăm &quot;(тватӑм)&quot;, pilĕm &quot;(пилӗм)&quot;, ultăm &quot;(ултӑм)&quot;, şiçĕm &quot;(ҫичӗм)&quot;, wunăm &quot;(вунӑм)&quot;.

==Word formation==
Some notable suffixes are: -ҫӑ for agent nouns, -лӑх for abstract and instrumental nouns, -ӑш, less commonly, for abstract nouns from certain adjectives, -у (after consonants) or -v (after vowels) for action nouns, -ла, -ал, -ар, and -н for denominal verbs. The valency changing suffixes and the gerunds were mentioned in the verbal morphology section above. Diminutives may be formed with multiple suffixes such as -ашка, -(к)ка, -лчӑ, -ак/ӑк, -ача.

==Sample text==
1. Хӗвелӗн икӗ арӑм: Ирхи Шуҫӑмпа Каҫхи Шуҫӑм.
1. The Sun has two wives: Dawn and Afterglow (lit. &quot;the Morning Glow&quot; and &quot;the Evening Glow&quot;).
2. Ир пулсан Хӗвел Ирхи Шуҫӑмран уйрӑлса каять
2. When it is morning, the Sun leaves Dawn
3. те яра кун тӑршшӗпе Каҫхи Шуҫӑм патнелле сулӑнать.
3. and during the whole day (he) moves towards Afterglow.
4. Ҫак икӗ мӑшӑрӗнчен унӑн ачасем:

5. Этем ятлӑ ывӑл тата Сывлӑм ятлӑ хӗр пур.
5. a son named Etem (Human) and a daughter named Syvlăm (Dew).
6. Этемпе Сывлӑм пӗррехинче Ҫӗр чӑмӑрӗ ҫинче тӗл пулнӑ та,
6. Etem and Syvlăm once met on the globe of the Earth,
7. пӗр-пӗрне юратса ҫемье чӑмӑртанӑ.

<text>The Chartered Institute of Library and Information Professionals (CILIP, pronounced ) is a professional body for librarians, information specialists and knowledge managers in the United Kingdom.

It was established in 2002 as a merger of the Library Association (LA, sometimes LAUK) and the Institute of Information Scientists (IIS).

CILIP in Scotland (CILIPS) is an independent organisation which operates in Scotland in affiliation with CILIP and delivers services via a service level agreement.

CILIP&#x27;s 2020 goal is to &quot;put information and library skills and professional values at the heart of a democratic, equal and prosperous society&quot;.

==History==
CILIP was formed in 2002 by the merger of the Library Association (abbreviated as LA or sometimes LAUK) – founded in 1877 as a result of the first International Conference of Librarians and awarded a Royal Charter in 1898 – and the Institute of Information Scientists (IIS), founded on 23 January 1958.

The first President of the Library Association had been John Winter Jones and other notable Presidents had included Richard Garnett (1893), Frederic G. Kenyon (1910), W. C. Berwick Sayers (1938), Lionel McColvin (1952) and Douglas John Foskett (1976). The jubilee (50th year) of the Association was celebrated in 1927. Library associations from fourteen European countries and the United States signed a resolution at the celebration of the 50th anniversary of the Library Association of the United Kingdom held in Edinburgh which brought the International Federation of Library Associations into existence.

The Library Association offered professional recognition at the level of Associate of the Library Association (ALA), the basic professional qualification, and Fellow of the Library Association (FLA), awarded for a higher level of professional achievement.

Membership of the CILIP on unification in 2002 was estimated at 23,000. Sheila Corrall was the first President of CILIP, succeeded in 2003 by Margaret Watson.

In 2017, the &quot;Chartered Institute of Library and Information Professionals&quot; was rebranded to CILIP: The library and information association.

==Description==

CILIP has its headquarters in the British Library in London. Until 2023, CILIP had been based at number 7 Ridgmount Street, in the building purpose-built in 1965 as the headquarters of the Library Association.

CILIP is a registered charity.

==Activities==
CILIP launched a monthly journal, &quot;Information Professional&quot; in 2017, providing news, interviews, and analysis. This publication succeeded &quot;Library &amp; Information Update&quot; which was published from 2002 to 2017 and the &quot;Library Association Record&quot; published from 1899 to 2002. CILIP publications also include Lisjobnet (a recruitment website), and Facet Publishing (professional books).

CILIP hosts an annual conference for members and non-members. Past keynote speakers include Dr Carla Hayden (Librarian of Congress in the US), Professor Luciano Floridi and Sir Nigel Shadbolt.

CILIP works to raise the profile of the work of librarians and information professionals through campaigns, public affairs activity, and awards and medals, as well as promoting best practice. Campaigns have included My Library By Right (publicising local government&#x27;s statutory obligation to provide library services), Facts Matter (championing the value of quality information during the 2017 UK General Election), and the annual Libraries Week campaign and Libraries Change Lives Award.

CILIP awards the Carnegie and Kate Greenaway Medals for children&#x27;s books. CILIP works in partnership to award the Amnesty CILIP Honour, a special commendation which is part of the Carnegie and Kate Greenaway Medals. Special interest groups also make their own awards, such as the Jason Farradane Award and Tony Kent Strix Award of UKeiG.

There are over 20 special interest groups for members working with, for instance, rare books and prison libraries and a similar number of &#x27;organisations in liaison&#x27; with CILIP, such as Information for Social Change, the National Acquisitions Group, and the Society of Indexers. CILIP, in its previous incarnation as the Library Association, was a founder member of the International Federation of Library Associations and Institutions (IFLA) in 1927.

Some specialist groups organise conferences such as the annual LILAC (Librarians&#x27; Information Literacy Conference), held since 2005 by the CILIP&#x27;s Information Literacy Group, or the Health Libraries Group conference, held every two years. 

CILIP&#x27;s archives are held by University College London Special Collections, having been deposited with the institution between 2002 and 2007. 

== Professional development ==
CILIP accredits degree courses in library and information science at universities in the UK, as well as a number of overseas programmes in China, Germany, Hong Kong, Kuwait, Oman, Thailand and Qatar.

There are three levels of professional registration with corresponding postnominal letters:
* Certified Affiliate (ACLIP), suitable for paraprofessionals without an accredited qualification
* Chartered Member (MCLIP)
* Chartered Fellow (FCLIP)
Honorary Fellowship (HonFCLIP), akin to an honorary degree, is granted to a small number of people who have rendered distinguished service to the profession. 
CILIP provides opportunities for continuing professional development and a self-assessment tool, the Professional Knowledge and Skills Base. Registered members may revalidate their registration annually.

Membership of CILIP is not compulsory for practice.

== Membership ==

The following information on CILIP membership is taken from CILIP Council reports with the exceptions of the estimates for 2002, 2003 and 2005. Membership numbers for 2004 and 2006 are not available.

The method of calculation was changed in 2018 to count &#x27;Life Members&#x27; as a separate category in published membership statistics and hence these figures do not represent a continuous series. As at January 2019 there were approximately 1,000 &#x27;Life Members&#x27; of CILIP.

==CILIP in Scotland==

The Chartered Institute of Library and Information Professionals in Scotland (CILIP in Scotland, or CILIPS) is a charitable incorporated organisation affiliated to CILIP. All CILIP members working or living in Scotland are automatically members of CILIPS. Policy, finances, operational matters and advocacy are devolved to CILIPS Trustee Board and staff and CILIP services are delivered via a service level agreement. CILIPS works with the Scottish Library and Information Council (SLIC), the advisory body for the Scottish Government on library and information matters.

CILIP in Scotland was originally established as the Scottish Library Association in 1908 and affiliated with the Library Association in 1931. When CILIP was established in 2002, the Scottish Library Association voted to change its name to CILIPS. CILIPS published a professional journal, &quot;Information Scotland&quot; (), between 2003 and 2009, which subsequently became a newsletter.

<doc id="753905" wikidata="Q2597535" url="?curid=753905" title="XML data binding">
<text>XML data binding refers to a means of representing information in an XML document as a business object in computer memory. This allows applications to access the data in the XML from the object, rather than using the DOM or SAX to retrieve the data from a direct representation of the XML itself.

It makes it possible to read and write XML data using a programming language class library (e.g. C++, C#, Java), specifically created for a given XML data format. Whilst it is possible to manually write a computer program to achieve this, XML data binding tools generate the source code to perform these tasks.

==Description==
An XML data binder accomplishes this by automatically creating a mapping between elements of the XML schema of the document we wish to bind and members of a class to be represented in memory.

When this process is applied to convert an XML document to an object, it is called unmarshalling (also called deserialization). The reverse process, to serialize an object as XML, is called marshalling.

Approaches to data binding can be distinguished as follows:

* XML schema based: Based on an existing XML schema, classes that correspond to the schema are generated.
* Class based: Based on a set of classes to be serialized, a corresponding XML schema is generated.
* Mapping-based: A mapping description, usually itself an XML document, describes how an existing XML schema maps to a set of classes, and vice versa.

==Difficulties==

Since XML is a document-oriented format and objects are (usually) not document-oriented, simple XML data binding mappings may ignore some of the structural information embedded in an XML document. Specifically, information such as comments, XML entity references, and sibling order may not be preserved in the object representation created by the binding application. However, this is not always the case; sufficiently powerful XML data binding tools are capable of preserving 100% of the information stored in an XML document.

Similarly, since objects residing in computer memory are not inherently sequentially stored, and may include links to other objects (including self-referential links), simple XML data binding mappings may not be capable of preserving all the information about an object when it is marshalled to XML. However, sufficiently powerful data binding tools perform graph structure analysis on objects residing in memory to marshall (cyclic) object graph structures in XML by utilizing standard XML reference attributes.

==Alternatives==

An alternative approach to automatic data binding relies instead on hand-crafted XPath expressions that extract data from XML. This approach has some benefits but also has some drawbacks. First, the approach only needs proximate knowledge (e.g., topology, tag names, etc.) of the XML tree structure, which developers can determine by looking at the XML data. Furthermore, XPath allows the application to bind the relevant data items and filter out everything else, avoiding the unnecessary processing that would be required to completely unmarshall the entire XML document. The drawback of this approach is the lack of automation in implementing the object model and XPath expressions. Instead, the application developers have to create these artifacts manually, which is time-consuming, potentially error-prone, and hampers application maintenance when XML schemas and XML content models are updated. Another drawback is the lack of XML schema verification, which XML data bindings typically apply automatically during unmarshalling. Schema validity is typically required in secure applications.

==Data binding in general==
One of XML data binding&#x27;s strengths is the ability to deserialize objects across programs, languages, and platforms. You can dump a time series of structured objects from a datalogger written in C (programming language) on an embedded processor, bring it across the network to process in Perl and finally visualize in Octave. The structure and the data remain consistent and coherent throughout the journey, and no custom formats or parsing is required. This is not unique to XML. YAML, for example, is emerging as a powerful data-binding alternative to XML. JSON (which can be regarded as a subset of YAML) is often suitable for lightweight or restricted applications.

<text>Beale Street is a street in Downtown Memphis, Tennessee, which runs from the Mississippi River to East Street, a distance of approximately . It is a significant location in the city&#x27;s history, as well as in the history of blues music. Today, the blues clubs and restaurants that line Beale Street are major tourist attractions in Memphis. Festivals and outdoor concerts frequently bring large crowds to the street and its surrounding areas.

==History==


Beale Street was created in 1841 by entrepreneur and developer Robertson Topp (1807–1876), who soon named it later in the decade for Edward Fitzgerald Beale, a military hero from the Mexican–American War. (The original name was Beale Avenue.) Its western end primarily housed shops of trade merchants, who traded goods with ships along the Mississippi River, while the eastern part developed as an affluent suburb. In the 1860s, many black traveling musicians began performing on Beale. The first of these to call Beale Street home were the Young Men&#x27;s Brass Band, who were formed by Sam Thomas in 1867.

In the 1870s, the population of Memphis was rocked by a series of yellow fever epidemics, leading the city to forfeit its charter in 1879. During this time, Robert Church purchased land around Beale Street that eventually led to his becoming the first black millionaire from the south. In 1890, Beale Street underwent renovation with the addition of the Grand Opera House, later known as the Orpheum. In 1899, Church paid the city to create Church Park at the corner of 4th and Beale. It became a recreational and cultural center, where blues musicians could gather. A major attraction of the park was an auditorium that could seat 2,000 people. Speakers at the Church Park Auditorium included Woodrow Wilson, Booker T. Washington, and Franklin D. Roosevelt.

Beale Street Baptist Church, Tennessee&#x27;s oldest surviving African American Church edifice built beginning in 1869, was also important in the early civil rights movement in Memphis. In 1889, NAACP co-founder Ida B. Wells was a co-owner and editor of an anti-segregationist paper called &quot;Free Speech&quot; based on Beale before her presses were destroyed by a white mob.

In the early 1900s, Beale Street was filled with many clubs, restaurants and shops, many of them owned by African-Americans. In 1903, Mayor Thornton was looking for a music teacher for his Knights of Pythias Band and called Tuskegee Institute to talk to his friend, Booker T. Washington, who recommended a trumpet player in Clarksdale, Mississippi named W. C. Handy. Mayor Thornton contacted Handy, and Memphis became the home of the musician who created the &quot;Blues on Beale Street&quot;. Mayor Thornton and his three sons also played in Handy&#x27;s band.

In 1909, W. C. Handy wrote &quot;Mr. Crump&quot; as a campaign song for political machine leader E. H. Crump. The song was later renamed &quot;The Memphis Blues.&quot; Handy also wrote a song called &quot;Beale Street Blues&quot; in 1916 which influenced the change of the street&#x27;s name from Beale Avenue to Beale Street. From the 1920s to the 1940s, Louis Armstrong, Muddy Waters, Albert King, Memphis Minnie, B. B. King, Rufus Thomas, Rosco Gordon and other blues and jazz legends played on Beale Street and helped develop the style known as Memphis Blues. As a young man, B. B. King was billed as &quot;the Beale Street Blues Boy.&quot; One of Handy&#x27;s proteges on Beale Street was the young Walter Furry Lewis, who later became a well known blues musician. In his later years Lewis lived near Fourth and Beale, and in 1969 was recorded there in his apartment by Memphis music producer Terry Manning.

In 1934, local community leader George Washington Lee authored &quot;Beale Street: Where the Blues Began&quot;; the first book by a black author to be advertised in the &quot;Book of the Month Club News&quot;.

In 1938, Lewis O. Swingler, editor of the &quot;Memphis World Newspaper&quot;, a Negro newspaper, in an effort to increase circulation, conceived the idea of a &quot;Mayor of Beale St.,&quot; having readers vote for the person of their choice. Matthew Thornton Sr., a well-known community leader, active in political, civic and social affairs and one of the charter members of the Memphis Branch of the NAACP, won the contest against nine opponents and received 12,000 of the 33,000 votes cast. Mr. Thornton was the original &quot;Mayor of Beale St.&quot; an honorary position that he retained until he died in 1963 at the age of 90.

By the 1960s, Beale had fallen on hard times and many businesses closed, even though the section of the street from Main to 4th was declared a National Historic Landmark on May 23, 1966. On December 15, 1977, Beale Street was officially declared the &quot;Home of the Blues&quot; by an act of Congress. Despite national recognition of its historic significance, Beale was a virtual ghost town after a disastrous urban renewal program that razed blocks of buildings in the surrounding neighborhood, as well as a number of buildings on Beale Street.

In 1973, the Beale Street Development Corporation (BSDC) was formed by George B. Miller and others as a racially diverse, cooperative effort for the redevelopment of Beale Street. The corporation was selected by the City of Memphis to participate in the redevelopment of the blocks on Beale between Second and Fourth streets in August, 1978. The corporation dedicated its efforts to the success of the Beale Street project for the preservation of the street&#x27;s rich history, and to its cultural as well as physical development. The BSDC secured $5.2 million in grants for the renovation of Beale Street.

In 1982, the City of Memphis recommended that the BSDC hire a management company led by John A. Elkington to assist in the development of the street by securing new tenants, collecting rents and handling certain maintenance and security issues. Each new lease had to be agreed upon by BSDC, the City of Memphis and the management company, Performa.

The day-to-day management of Beale Street was turned over to the City of Memphis in an October, 2012 court decision after a long legal dispute involving the city, BSDC and Performa.

During the first weekend of May (sometimes including late April), the Beale Street Music Festival brings major music acts from a variety of musical genres to Tom Lee Park at the end of Beale Street on the Mississippi River. The festival is the kickoff event of a month of festivities citywide known as Memphis in May.

In 2020, in Memphis, the Beale Street Historic District and the WDIA radio station were added to the U.S. Civil Rights Trail.

==TEI guidelines==

The &quot;TEI Guidelines&quot; collectively define a type of XML format, and are the defining output of the community of practice. The format differs from other well-known open formats for text (such as HTML and OpenDocument) in that it is primarily semantic rather than presentational: the semantics and interpretation of every tag and attribute are specified. There are some 500 different textual components and concepts: , , , , ,
etc. Each is grounded in one or more academic disciplines and examples are given.

===Technical details===

The standard is split into two parts, a discursive textual description with extended examples and discussion and set of tag-by-tag definitions. Schemata in most of the modern formats (DTD, RELAX NG and XML Schema (W3C)) are generated automatically from the tag-by-tag definitions. A number of tools support the production of the guidelines and the application of the guidelines to specific projects.

A number of special tags are used to circumvent restrictions imposed by the underlying Unicode; to allow representation of characters that do not qualify for Unicode inclusion and to allow overcome the required strict linearity.

Most users of the format do not use the complete range of tags, but produce a customisation using a project-specific subset of the tags and attributes defined by the Guidelines. The TEI defines a sophisticated customization mechanism known as ODD for this purpose. In addition to documenting and describing each TEI tag, an ODD specification specifies its content model and other usage constraints, which may be expressed using schematron.

&quot;TEI Lite&quot; is an example of such a customization. It defines an XML-based file format for exchanging texts. It is a manageable selection from the extensive set of elements available in the full TEI Guidelines.

As an XML-based format, TEI cannot directly deal with overlapping markup and non-hierarchical structures. A variety of options to represent this sort of data is suggested by the guidelines.

===Examples===

The text of the TEI guidelines is rich in examples. There is also a samples page on the TEI wiki, which gives examples of real-world projects that expose their underlying TEI.

====Prose tags====

TEI allows texts to be marked up syntactically at any level of granularity, or mixture of granularities. For example, this paragraph (p) has been marked up into sentences (s) and clauses (cl).

 &lt;s&gt;
 &lt;cl&gt;It was about the beginning of September, 1664,
 &lt;cl&gt;that I, among the rest of my neighbours,
 heard in ordinary discourse
 &lt;cl&gt;that the plague was returned again to Holland; &lt;/cl&gt;
 &lt;/cl&gt;
 &lt;/cl&gt;
 &lt;cl&gt;for it had been very violent there, and particularly at
 Amsterdam and Rotterdam, in the year 1663, &lt;/cl&gt;
 &lt;cl&gt;whither, &lt;cl&gt;they say,&lt;/cl&gt; it was brought,
 &lt;cl&gt;some said&lt;/cl&gt; from Italy, others from the Levant, among some goods
 &lt;cl&gt;which were brought home by their Turkey fleet;&lt;/cl&gt;
 &lt;/cl&gt;
 &lt;cl&gt;others said it was brought from Candia;
 others from Cyprus. &lt;/cl&gt;
 &lt;/s&gt;
 &lt;s&gt;
 &lt;cl&gt;It mattered not &lt;cl&gt;from whence it came;&lt;/cl&gt;
 &lt;/cl&gt;
 &lt;cl&gt;but all agreed &lt;cl&gt;it was come into Holland again.&lt;/cl&gt;
 &lt;/cl&gt;
 &lt;/s&gt;

====Verse====

TEI has tags for marking up verse. This example (taken from the French translation of the TEI Guidelines) shows a sonnet.
&lt;div type=&quot;sonnet&quot;&gt;
 &lt;lg type=&quot;quatrain&quot;&gt;
 &lt;l&gt;Les amoureux fervents et les savants austères&lt;/l&gt;
 &lt;l&gt; Aiment également, dans leur mûre saison,&lt;/l&gt;
 &lt;l&gt; Les chats puissants et doux, orgueil de la maison,&lt;/l&gt;
 &lt;l&gt; Qui comme eux sont frileux et comme eux sédentaires.&lt;/l&gt;
 &lt;/lg&gt;
 &lt;lg type=&quot;quatrain&quot;&gt;
 &lt;l&gt;Amis de la science et de la volupté&lt;/l&gt;
 &lt;l&gt; Ils cherchent le silence et l&#x27;horreur des ténèbres ;&lt;/l&gt;
 &lt;l&gt; L&#x27;Érèbe les eût pris pour ses coursiers funèbres,&lt;/l&gt;
 &lt;l&gt; S&#x27;ils pouvaient au servage incliner leur fierté.&lt;/l&gt;
 &lt;/lg&gt;
 &lt;lg type=&quot;tercet&quot;&gt;
 &lt;l&gt;Ils prennent en songeant les nobles attitudes&lt;/l&gt;
 &lt;l&gt;Des grands sphinx allongés au fond des solitudes,&lt;/l&gt;
 &lt;l&gt;Qui semblent s&#x27;endormir dans un rêve sans fin ;&lt;/l&gt;
 &lt;/lg&gt;
 &lt;lg type=&quot;tercet&quot;&gt;
 &lt;l&gt;Leurs reins féconds sont pleins d&#x27;étincelles magiques,&lt;/l&gt;
 &lt;l&gt; Et des parcelles d&#x27;or, ainsi qu&#x27;un sable fin,&lt;/l&gt;
 &lt;l&gt;Étoilent vaguement leurs prunelles mystiques.&lt;/l&gt;
 &lt;/lg&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
====Choice tag====

The tag is used to represent sections of text that might be encoded or tagged in more than one possible way. In the following example, based on one in the standard, is used twice, once to indicate an original and a corrected number, and once to indicate an original and regularised spelling.
&lt;p xml:id=&quot;p23&quot;&gt;Lastly, That, upon his solemn oath to observe all the above
articles, the said man-mountain shall have a daily allowance of
meat and drink sufficient for the support of &lt;choice&gt;
 &lt;sic&gt;1724&lt;/sic&gt;
 &lt;corr&gt;1728&lt;/corr&gt;
 &lt;/choice&gt; of our subjects,
with free access to our royal person, and other marks of our
&lt;choice&gt;
 &lt;orig&gt;favour&lt;/orig&gt;
 &lt;reg&gt;favor&lt;/reg&gt;
 &lt;/choice&gt;.

==ODD==

One Document Does it all (&quot;ODD&quot;) is a literate programming language for XML schemas.

In literate-programming style, ODD documents combine human-readable documentation and machine-readable models using the Documentation Elements module of the Text Encoding Initiative. Tools generate localised and internationalised HTML, ePub, or PDF human-readable output and DTDs, W3C XML Schema, Relax NG Compact Syntax, or Relax NG XML Syntax machine-readable output.

The Roma web application is built around the ODD format and can use it to generate schemas in DTD, W3C XML Schema, Relax NG Compact Syntax, or Relax NG XML Syntax formats, as used by many XML validation tools and services.

ODD is the format used internally by the Text Encoding Initiative for the TEI technical standard. Although ODD files generally describe the difference between a customized XML format and the full TEI model, ODD also can be used to describe XML formats that are entirely separate from the TEI. One example of this is the W3C&#x27;s Internationalization Tag Set which uses the ODD format to generate schemas and document its vocabulary.

==TEI customizations==

TEI customizations are specializations of the TEI XML specification for use in particular fields or by specific communities.
* EpiDoc (Epigraphic Documents)
* Charters Encoding Initiative
* Medieval Nordic Text Archive (Menota)

Customization in the TEI is done through the ODD mechanism mentioned above. In truth since its P5 version, all so-called &#x27;TEI Conformant&#x27; uses of the TEI Guidelines are based on a TEI customization documented in a TEI ODD file. Even when users choose one of the off-the-shelf pre-generated schemas to validate against, these have been created from freely available customization files.

==Projects==
The format is used by many projects worldwide. Practically all projects are associated with one or more universities. Some well-known projects that encode texts using TEI include:

==History==
Prior to the creation of TEI, humanities scholars had no common standards for encoding electronic texts in a manner that would serve their academic goals (Hockey 1993, p. 41). In 1987, a group of scholars representing fields in humanities, linguistics, and computing convened at Vassar College to put forth a set of guidelines known as the “Poughkeepsie Principles”. These guidelines directed the development of the first TEI standard, &quot;P1&quot;.

* 1987 – Work started by the Association for Computers and the Humanities, the Association for Computational Linguistics, and the Association for Literary and Linguistic Computing on what would become the TEI. This culminated in the &quot;Closing statement of the Vassar Planning Conference&quot;.
* 1994 – TEI P3 released, co-edited by Lou Burnard (at Oxford University) and Michael Sperberg-McQueen (then at the University of Illinois at Chicago, later at the W3C).
* 1999 – TEI P3 updated.
* 2002 – TEI P4 released, moving from SGML to XML; adoption of Unicode, which XML parsers are required to support.
* 2007 – TEI P5 released, including integration with the codice_1 and codice_2 attributes from the W3C (these had previously been attributes in the TEI namespace), regularization of local pointing attributes to use the hash (as used in HTML) and unification of the ptr and xptr tags. Together these changes with many more new additions make P5 more regular and bring it closer to current xml practice as promoted by the W3C and as used by other XML variants. Maintenance and feature update versions of TEI P5 have been released at least twice a year since 2007.
* 2011 – TEI P5 v2.0.1 released with support for genetic editing (among many other additions, the genetic-editing features allow encoding of texts without interpretation as to their specific semantics).
* 2017 – TEI was awarded the Antonio Zampolli Prize from the Alliance of Digital Humanities Organizations.

<doc id="753917" wikidata="Q1237181" url="?curid=753917" title="Civic Arena (Pittsburgh)">
<text>The Civic Arena, formerly the Civic Auditorium and later Mellon Arena, was an arena located in Downtown Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. The Civic Arena primarily served as the home to the Pittsburgh Penguins, the city&#x27;s National Hockey League (NHL) franchise, from 1967 to 2010.

Constructed in 1961 for use by the Pittsburgh Civic Light Opera (CLO), it was the brainchild of department store owner Edgar J. Kaufmann. It was the first retractable roof major-sports venue in the world, covering , constructed with nearly 3,000 tons of Pittsburgh steel and supported solely by a massive cantilevered arm on the exterior. Even though it was designed and engineered as a retractable-roof dome, the operating cost and repairs to the hydraulic jacks halted all full retractions after 1995, and the roof stayed permanently closed after 2001. The first roof opening was during a July 4, 1962, Carol Burnett show to which she exclaimed &quot;Ladies and Gentlemen ... I present the sky!&quot;

The Civic Arena hosted numerous concerts, the circus, political and religious rallies, roller derbies as well as contests in hockey, basketball, fish tournament weigh-ins, pro tennis, boxing, wrestling, lacrosse, football, ice skating championships, kennel shows, and soccer. The structure was used as the backdrop for several major Hollywood films, most prominently &quot;Sudden Death&quot; in 1995. Prior to its demise, it was known as Mellon Arena, named for Mellon Financial, specifically American businessman and 49th Secretary of the Treasury Andrew W. Mellon, which purchased the naming rights in 1999. Their naming rights expired on August 1, 2010, and the arena once again adopted the name of Civic Arena.

The Civic Arena closed on June 26, 2010. The former Mellon naming rights expired soon after, and the Penguins and all other events moved across the street to the new Consol Energy Center (now PPG Paints Arena). After various groups declined historic status for the venue, it was demolished between September 2011 and March 2012. In its place, existing public parking lots in the area were expanded over the entire site. Two of the many streets stricken from the city&#x27;s street plan when the arena was originally built were subsequently re-extended back through the site: Wylie Avenue and Fullerton Street. The Penguins have the rights to redevelop the property and a preliminary plan exists for residential units, retail space and office space.

==Construction and design==

The $22 million ($ in dollars) arena was completed for the CLO in 1961. Mayor David L. Lawrence had publicly announced plans for a &quot;civic theater&quot; as early as February 8, 1953 after years of public pressure had built after CLO president, civic leader and owner of Kaufmann&#x27;s department store Edgar J. Kaufmann announced his intention on December 1, 1948, to find a new home for the group. Funding was provided by a combination of public and private money, including grants from Allegheny County, the City of Pittsburgh, and Kaufmann. The arena&#x27;s design incorporated 2,950 tons of stainless steel from Pittsburgh.

To make room for the arena, the city used eminent domain to displace 8,000 residents and 400 businesses from the lower Hill District, the cultural center of black life in Pittsburgh. Demolition began in 1955 and was finished by 1960. The last structure to be demolished was Bethel African Methodist Episcopal (AME) Church, built in 1908. The city charter prohibited using eminent domain on churches, but the Urban Redevelopment Authority of Pittsburgh was able to do so because it was not a city entity. On July 21, 1959, a steel strike halted work on the arena and delayed its opening date.

The Arena was designed for the CLO, which previously held productions at Pitt Stadium. The roof, which was supported by a arch, was free of internal support leaving no obstruction for the seats within. The roof, which had a diameter of , was divided into eight sections. Six of the sections could fold underneath two—in 2½ minutes—making the Civic Arena the world&#x27;s first major indoor sports stadium with a retractable roof. A total of 42 trucks mounted on 78 wheels, 30 of which were individually driven, supported and moved the six moveable sections. The trucks, gear motors and 480-volt AC motor drive that moved the roof sections were designed and manufactured by Heyl &amp; Patterson Inc., a local specialist engineering firm.

The arena&#x27;s capacity fluctuated depending on the event being hosted, but was increased due to additions between 1972 and 1991. The arena originally consisted only of lower bowl seating, but over time, upper decks were installed in the arena&#x27;s &quot;end zones&quot; to increase capacity. In December 1999, Mellon Financial purchased the Arena&#x27;s naming rights in a 10-year, $18 million agreement, which renamed the arena Mellon Arena.

The original center scoreboard was an electromechanical Nissen scoreboard with digital clock display, which appears in the 1979 movie &quot;The Fish That Saved Pittsburgh&quot;. That board was replaced during the 1986 renovations by an American Sign and Indicator scoreboard with a black-and-white three-line matrix animation/messageboard on each side, which appears in &quot;Sudden Death.&quot; White Way Sign created the arena&#x27;s final center scoreboard, this one with a Sony JumboTron videoboard on each side, which remained for the arena&#x27;s final sixteen years of use.

==History and events==
On September 17, 1961, the Ice Capades hosted the arena&#x27;s first event. Globally televised figure skating was hosted by the arena three times: The 1983 United States Figure Skating Championships, 1994 and 2004 editions of Skate America all having nearly week-long competitions.

===Political events===
Major political rallies were part of the early history of the arena. Former President Dwight Eisenhower appeared at a Republican rally on October 12, 1962. President Lyndon B. Johnson delivered a campaign address on October 27, 1964, and Sen. Barry Goldwater on October 29, 1964. On April 26, 1964, the 2-week long International Conference and Debate of the Methodist Church opened at the Arena. Vice President Nixon visited for a campaign rally at the arena on October 28, 1968. Henry Kissinger, Frank Borman, and Li Choh-ming visited for the University of Pittsburgh commencement on April 27, 1969.

===Boxing matches===
Muhammad Ali KO&#x27;ed Charley Powell on January 24, 1963, to a global television audience from the Civic Arena. Sugar Ray Robinson, Sonny Liston and Floyd Patterson also participated in boxing matches at the arena. On November 6, 1981, the globally televised World Heavyweight Title was fought at the arena between Larry Holmes and Renaldo Snipes with an undercard bout between Buster Douglas and David Bey.

===Professional wrestling===
* WWF SummerSlam – 1995
* WWF King of the Ring – 1998
* WWF Unforgiven – 2001
* WWE No Way Out - 2005
* WWE Armageddon - 2007
* WWE Bragging Rights - 2009

King of the Ring in 1998 is remembered for the Hell in a Cell match between Mick Foley and the Undertaker, where Foley would fall from the top of the cell, suffering multiple injuries. Journalist Michael Landsberg called it &quot;maybe the most famous match ever.&quot; In 2011, this incident was named as the number one &quot;!&quot; incident in the WWE history. The final WWE event was a Monday Night Raw episode on May 10, 2010. The future events would now be taking place at PPG Paints Arena.

===Basketball===
America&#x27;s first high school basketball All-Star game, The Dapper Dan Roundball Classic was held at the arena annually between 1965 and 1992. The men&#x27;s basketball programs of both of the city&#x27;s NCAA Division I institutions, the University of Pittsburgh and Duquesne University, frequently used it either as a primary or secondary home court, and the last basketball game played at the arena was the two schools&#x27; annual rivalry game in 2009. Among the two schools, Duquesne made the most extensive use of the arena, using it as their home from 1964 until 1988. From 1984 to 2002, Pitt used the arena for select games against popular opponents.

The Philadelphia 76ers, Pittsburgh Pipers, Pittsburgh Condors, Pittsburgh Rens, Pittsburgh Piranhas, and the Harlem Globetrotters hosted regular-season basketball games at the Arena. The first and second-round games of both the 1997 and 2002 NCAA Division I men&#x27;s basketball tournaments were held at the Arena.

===Tennis===
The Pittsburgh Triangles of World TeamTennis hosted three Eastern Division Championships at the arena from 1974 through 1976 and the Bancroft Cup finals in 1975, winning the title on August 25, 1975, with paid attendance of 6,882.

===Indoor soccer===
The Pittsburgh Spirit Major Indoor Soccer League team also hosted matches at the Arena.

===Roller derby===
Roller Derby featuring the hosting New York Chiefs took place at the Arena as well.

===Gymnastics===
Olympic Gold Medal winner Mary Lou Retton performed at the Arena as part of the &quot;Tour of Champions&quot; event on November 2, 1990.

===Notable musical events===
The first rock concert at the arena was emceed by Porky Chedwick on May 11, 1962, as a DiCesare Engler production and featured Jackie Wilson, The Drifters, The Coasters, The Castelles, Jerry Butler, The Flamingos, The Angels, The Blue-Belles, and The Skyliners.

On September 14, 1964, the Beatles played the arena during their first United States tour. Opening acts were the Bill Black Combo, The Exciters, Clarence &quot;Frogman&quot; Henry, and Jackie DeShannon. A sell-out crowd of over 12,000 paid $5.90 to attend

Motown came to the arena on March 6, 1969, with a Temptations concert.

On July 11, 1971, the world&#x27;s first &quot;authorized&quot; production of &quot;Jesus Christ Superstar&quot; opened at the Civic Arena.

Black Sabbath played the arena on February 1, 1974. &quot;Circus&quot; reported, &quot;They broke the existing box office record by grossing $76,000.&quot;

On August 14, 1974, Canadian rock band Rush played the first show on their debut US tour with new drummer Neil Peart at the Civic Arena. They were opening for Uriah Heep at this show.

Pink Floyd was at the Civic Arena for The Dark Side of the Moon Tour on June 19, 1973.

Elvis Presley played his final New Year&#x27;s Eve show at the Civic Arena on December 31, 1976, and played to a sellout on June 25 and 26, 1973. The arena has hosted other major concerts by every act from Frank Sinatra to Garth Brooks to Jimmy Page and Robert Plant.

By the mid-1970s the arena was among the premier venues in the nation, with Billboard magazine naming it the 9th best in the U.S. on December 30, 1976. Sly and the Family Stone, The Steve Miller Band, Grand Funk Railroad, Boz Scaggs, and The Beach Boys all played the arena in 1974.

The Bee Gees performed two concerts here on September 4–5, 1979 during their Spirits Having Flown Tour.

The Jacksons performed at Pittsburgh Civic Arena on August 13, 1981, during their Triumph Tour.

Guitarist Randy Rhoads played one of his final shows here with Ozzy Osbourne on February 2, 1982. He would die 45 days later.

Duran Duran performed February 28, 1984, during a snowstorm and their Grammy win was announced onstage.

Pop superstar Michael Jackson performed three concerts at Pittsburgh Civic Arena on September 26, 27 and 28, 1988 during his Bad World Tour.

Pop singer Britney Spears performed at the arena once in 2001 on her Dream Within a Dream Tour and in 2009 to a sell-out crowd as a part of her Circus Tour.

Then country singer Taylor Swift played a show in the arena during her Fearless Tour on October 1, 2009.

The Doors recorded their May 2, 1970, concert at the Civic Arena. This would be released 38 years later as &quot;Live in Pittsburgh 1970&quot; aka &quot;Pittsburgh Civic Arena&quot;. It is considered by most music critics to be The Doors very best live recording.

The Grateful Dead&#x27;s performances, on April 2–3, 1989, were recorded and later released as a live album, entitled &quot;Download Series Volume 9&quot;, as well as sparking a riot by &quot;Dead Heads&quot; on the final day of the concert, an event that was national news and featured by Kurt Loder on MTV News following the arrest of 500 by the Pittsburgh Police.

The Rolling Stones performed three times in the arena: July 22, 1972; March 11, 1999; and January 10, 2003.

Josh Groban performed here in August 2007 as part of his &#x27;Awake&#x27; tour.

The final event was to be a Maxwell concert on July 10, 2010. However, the show was canceled. On June 8, 2010, the arena&#x27;s management group, SMG, announced that James Taylor and Carole King&#x27;s Troubadour Reunion Tour concert stop would be the final event at Mellon Arena on June 26, 2010.

===Hockey===
====AHL Hornets====

The Pittsburgh Hornets, members of the American Hockey League (AHL) played home games at the Duquesne Gardens, located in the Oakland section of Pittsburgh. The team played 20 seasons in the Gardens prior to its demolition, which made room for an apartment building. The Arena opened on September 17, 1961. With the Arena available, the Hornets resumed play in the 1961–62 season and went on to win the Calder Cup in the 1966–67 season.

====Penguins====
As part of the 1967 NHL expansion, the city of Pittsburgh was selected to host one of six new franchises. With a hockey seating capacity of 12,508, Pittsburgh&#x27;s Mellon Arena was eight seats over the NHL&#x27;s minimum seating benchmark. Due to its outward appearance, the arena was nicknamed &quot;The Igloo&quot; which led to the naming of the Penguins. The Penguins debuted at the Civic Arena on October 11, 1967, in a 2–1 loss to the Montreal Canadiens. Andy Bathgate scored the Penguins&#x27;s first goal in the arena. It was the first NHL game played between an expansion team and an &quot;Original Six&quot; team. The Penguins won their first game at the Arena on October 21, when they became the first expansion team to beat an &quot;Original Six&quot; franchise by beating the Chicago Black Hawks 4–2. On January 21, 1990, the Civic Arena hosted the 41st National Hockey League All-Star Game. Pittsburgh&#x27;s Mario Lemieux scored three goals on his first three shots—the first coming 21 seconds into the game. He later scored a fourth goal and was named the game&#x27;s Most Valuable Player. The arena also hosted the 1997 NHL entry draft, as well as games of the 1991, 1992, 2008, and 2009 Stanley Cup Finals. The 2008 Finals marked the only occasion that the Stanley Cup was presented on Mellon Arena ice, after the Penguins were defeated by the Detroit Red Wings in six games.

The Penguins originally planned to wear a jersey patch to commemorate their final season in the Igloo, but it was later scrapped.

The Pittsburgh Penguins played their final regular season game at the Mellon Arena on April 8, 2010, when they defeated the New York Islanders 7–3. More than 50 former Penguins were in attendance for a pre-game ceremony and &quot;team picture&quot;.

The Pittsburgh Penguins played their last game in Mellon Arena on May 12, 2010; a 5–2 defeat at the hands of the Montreal Canadiens to eliminate them from the 2010 Stanley Cup playoffs in Game 7 of the Eastern Conference Semifinals. This means the Canadiens both opened and closed the Penguins&#x27; career at the arena, handing out defeats at both events.

====Seating capacity====
The seating capacity of Civic Arena over time went as follows:

*10,732 (1961–1967)
*12,508 (1967–1968)
*12,580 (1968–1972)
*12,866 (1972–1973)
*13,431 (1973–1974)
*13,402 (1974–1975)

*16,404 (1976–1977)
*16,033 (1977–1987)
*16,168 (1987–1988)
*16,025 (1988–1990)
*16,164 (1990–1993)
*17,537 (1993–1994)
*17,181 (1994–1997); 17,355 with standing room
*16,958 (1997–2004); 17,148 with standing room
*16,940 (2004–2010); 17,132 with standing room

===Basketball===

====NCAA tournaments====
The Civic Arena hosted the first and second round regional games of both the 1997 and 2002 NCAA men&#x27;s tournament. The arena&#x27;s successor Consol Energy Center also hosted them in 2012. It also hosted the women&#x27;s first and second-round games in 2001.

====Eastern Eight championships====
For five seasons the arena hosted the Eastern 8 Conference men&#x27;s basketball tournament every March. From 1978 to 1982 many of the current Big East Conference powers Atlantic 10 powers fought for their conference crown at the center. For the final season, the Mellon Arena hosted a record crowd of 16,056, the third-largest conference basketball championship crowd in the nation that year.

====NBA regular season games====
Between 1964 and 1973, the arena hosted 14 regular season NBA games, primarily as a satellite city for the Philadelphia 76ers. On February 24, 1967, at the arena, Wilt Chamberlain set the all-time record for consecutive NBA field goals as well as single NBA game field goal percentage, a record that still stands. On October 10, 1971, the world champion Milwaukee Bucks led by Kareem Abdul-Jabbar played the Condors at the arena. The Arena also hosted dozens of pre-season NBA contests from the 1960s until 2009, many of them hosted by the nearby Cleveland Cavaliers, the closest NBA team to Pittsburgh.

====ABA Pipers and Condors====
The arena was the home of the American Basketball Association (ABA) Pittsburgh Pipers in 1967–68 and 1969–70 and the Pittsburgh Condors from 1970 to 1972. The team moved to Minneapolis for the 1968–69 season before returning. The team was disbanded following the 1971–72 season as the ABA struggled.

The Pipers were part of the inaugural season of the ABA in 1967–68, which quickly established a rivalry to the older National Basketball Association. On May 4, 1968, the Pipers, led by future Hall of Famer Connie Hawkins, claimed the ABA&#x27;s first ever championship, defeating the New Orleans Buccaneers before a Game 7 sold-out crowd of 11,457 in the Civic Arena.

==Naming==

In 1957, before the arena was opened, the under-construction building was officially known as the Civic Auditorium Amphitheater. By 1961, when it opened, Pittsburgh sign makers had decided that Civic Arena fit better on street signs, and the new, shorter name stuck. Still though, for the few years after it opened, it was sometimes referred to as the Civic Auditorium.

In the early days, The Pittsburgh Dome was also popular name choice, but nothing came of it.

In April 1988, city Councilman Mark Pollock proposed renaming it the Richard S. Caliguiri Arena, after the city&#x27;s popular mayor who was diagnosed with amyloidosis. Caliguiri died a month later, and nothing came of this name, either.

Allegheny County Commissioner Pete Flaherty believed that officially renaming the arena The Igloo would bring marketing potential in 1992. Again, the Civic Arena name stayed.

In 1997, the Penguins sold naming rights to Allegheny Energy for $5 million, which would&#x27;ve renamed the arena Allegheny Energy Dome. However, the Penguins did not own the building nor its naming rights – the Sports Commission of Pittsburgh and Allegheny County did, and the deal fell through.

But, by 1999, this had changed. When Mario Lemieux bought the Penguins out of bankruptcy, the naming rights were also awarded to him. They then sold the rights to Mellon Financial for $18 million, and the arena was finally renamed Mellon Arena. The arena kept the name after Mellon merged with The Bank of New York to form The Bank of New York Mellon in 2007 and didn&#x27;t go through with the &quot;BNY Mellon&quot; rebranding like other buildings bearing the Bank of New York or Mellon name such as One Mellon Center.

The Mellon Arena name was allowed to expire on August 1, 2010, with the building now vacant and the Penguins moving to the new Consol Energy Center (later renamed PPG Paints Arena) across the street. The closed building officially became the Civic Arena again.

==Replacement, debate, and demolition==
At its closing in 2010, the Civic Arena was the oldest and third-smallest arena in the NHL by official capacity (the Islanders and Oilers arenas seated fewer). In later years, the arena&#x27;s staff was forced to use space for multiple purposes never intended in the building&#x27;s original design. The Penguins franchise agreed to a deal with city and state officials to fund a new home arena for the franchise in March 2007. The PPG Paints Arena is located across the street from the site of Civic Arena and has a higher seating capacity and a standard seating layout. The Penguins played their first game at PPG Paints Arena October 7, 2010.
A March 2007 agreement between the SEA and the Penguins states that Civic Arena would be demolished after completion of PPG Paints Arena in July 2010. During this time, SEA conducted a historic assessment of the arena. It was eligible to be considered for the National Register of Historic Places, mainly because of its unique, retractable dome. A private consultant to SEA was hired to conduct the survey. The consultant followed the state Historic and Museum Commission guidelines to determine whether demolishing the arena, or reusing it, would adversely affect historic structures or artifacts in the area. The recommendations of the consultant to SEA were scheduled to be delivered in June 2010.
On September 16, 2010, the Allegheny County Sports and Exhibition Authority voted unanimously to demolish the Civic Arena. SEA Board chairman, State Senator Wayne Fontana, D–Brookline, said the board&#x27;s decision will not be final unless someone comes forward with a better idea on the use of the Arena. During the summer of 2010, workers removed asbestos from the building while a demolition plan was designed. The board also decided to sell assets (handled by the auction company Asset Auctions) from inside and would later award a demolition contract in February 2011. Proponents for retaining the building opposed the demolition decision in court, and attempted to seek landmark status.

On November 24, 2010, the building&#x27;s demolition was delayed due to a last-minute nomination as a National Historic Landmark. Also, on January 5, 2011, the Pittsburgh Historic Review Commission voted 5–1 in favor for preliminary approval of the arena&#x27;s historic nomination status. The vote paved the way for a formal hearing on the proposed designation on March 2. The HRC ultimately voted against landmark status on March 2. After also failing to get historic status approval from City Planning and City Council, Preservation Pittsburgh filed a federal lawsuit in another attempt to save the arena. The 3rd appeals court denied the lawsuit saying it had no jurisdiction in the matter, and demolition began Monday, September 26, 2011. The demolition was not a traditional type of demolition for sports arenas. In November 2011, the Penguins started selling Christmas ornaments crafted from the Civic Arena&#x27;s steel roof. The team used the promotion to raise money for its charitable foundation. Grove City-based Wendell August Forge, the oldest and largest forge in the United States, created two types of ornaments: one with the arena and the Pittsburgh skyline and another with the arena with the Penguins&#x27; logo. The Penguins had originally planned to sell 6,000 ornaments, but due to demand, the team ended selling over 40,000 pieces. The arena was being disassembled over time, and originally expected to be complete in May 2012. However, demolition was finished early as the last panel of the retractable roof fell down on March 31, 2012. The site&#x27;s footprint now serves as a surface lot for its successor arena, with the pre-1955 street grid re-established across the site as much as possible to allow future redevelopment.

==Use as a filming/recording location==
Civic Arena has served as a filming location for several major Hollywood productions including:
*&quot;The Fish That Saved Pittsburgh&quot;, a 1979 basketball film starring Flip Wilson, Stockard Channing, and Julius Erving as members of the fictional Pittsburgh Pisces NBA team.
*&quot;Grateful Dead Download Series Volume 9&quot;, 1989
*&quot;Sudden Death&quot;, a 1995 film starring Jean-Claude Van Damme as a retired Pittsburgh firefighter who tries to save his children and the Vice President from terrorists during the pivotal Game 7 of the Stanley Cup Finals. In an intermission between the game&#x27;s periods, the retractable-roof is opened for a fireworks show. It is opened once more in the climax of the film by Van Damme&#x27;s character.
*&quot;Rock Star&quot;, a 2001 film starring Mark Wahlberg as a musician heading to the Pittsburgh arena for a concert in 1987.
*&quot;Zack and Miri Make a Porno&quot;, a 2008 Kevin Smith film; one of the final scenes is shot outside the arena.
*&quot;She&#x27;s Out of My League&quot;, a 2010 romantic comedy; the arena and the Pittsburgh Penguins are featured as the backdrop to a date night.

Also, the Russian movie &quot;Brother 2&quot; was filmed at the arena. According to the script, the protagonist, Danila Borgov, arrived in the United States to help his friend&#x27;s brother, Penguins player Dmitry Gromov (though events of the film take place in Chicago). Notable hockey players Aleksei Morozov, Jaromír Jágr and Darius Kasparaitis appeared in the movie.

The arena also served as the recording location for The Doors album &quot;Live in Pittsburgh 1970&quot;, and was a constant background representing the city and its sports franchises for its television stations, most prominently in the production card for national productions from PBS member station WQED.

<doc id="753928" wikidata="Q288006" url="?curid=753928" title="Université TÉLUQ">
<text>Université TÉLUQ is a public French-language distance learning university, part of the Université du Québec system. Originally founded in 1972 as the Telé-université, Université du Québec commission to develop distance education courses, Université TÉLUQ is now a full university which offers programs in undergraduate and graduate studies. It is the only French-language university education institution in North America to offer all of its courses and programs at all three university cycles remotely and continuously. Though it is based in Quebec City, Quebec, about two thirds of its professors work from its Montreal offices.

== Legal status ==
Télé-université was established as a higher school by letters patent under the great seal, under decree 264-92 issued on February 26, 1992. On October 26, 2005, its letters patent were transferred to the Université du Québec à Montréal (UQAM), to which it was attached. The Télé-université was re-established on December 14, 2011 as a higher school. A member of the Université du Québec network since 1972, it has had its own board of directors since 1992. Its head office is located in Quebec, but it also has offices in Montreal.

==Students==
It has over 20,000 distant learning students per year, more than half of them in the Montreal area. Most students (71%) are females and over the age of 35 (60%). About a third of all students (35%) taking courses at TÉLUQ are from other universities or in on-campus programs. About a fifth of the student population (22%) holds a degree. 

There is a student union AÉTÉLUQ. It was created on October 3, 1994 and has as its principles democracy within its bodies, full participation within university bodies, transparency, accessibility to public education.

===Programs of study===
Université TÉLUQ offers hundreds of programs at all levels of study, from bachelor&#x27;s degrees to master&#x27;s and Ph.D.s, offered jointly with UQAM. Programs are offered by four departments:
*School of Administrative Sciences
*Department of Education
*Department of Science and Technology
*Department of Humanities, Languages, and Communication
Once a program is completed, the diploma is awarded by the Université du Québec.

=== Free access courses ===
Since the fall of 2014, TÉLUQ University has been offering Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs). Also, several courses offer everyone access to all or a substantial part of their content. Some are released under a Creative Commons (CC) license.

==Teaching methods==

Université TÉLUQ offers several types of courses. Support format includes paper, DVDs, and Web sites (using content management tools such as SPIP).

Courses are designed by teams led by a professor. Teams include research assistants, associate designers, education science specialists, proof readers and other edition staff.

Under the authority of a professor, tutors help students and mark assignments. Further information in the French version

==Research==
The strategic research sectors of TÉLUQ University are:

* Distance education, educational sciences
* Cognitive Computing
* Issues of the knowledge economy
* Society, culture and communication
* Health
* Environment

As a pioneer in distance education in North America, TÉLUQ University has developed a field of research skills in the fields of distance education, which relies on a critical mass of professors and researchers who work in particular on:

<text>Amerant Bank Arena (previously known as the National Car Rental Center, Office Depot Center, BankAtlantic Center, BB&amp;T Center, and FLA Live Arena) is an indoor arena in Sunrise, Florida. United States It is the home venue for the Florida Panthers of the National Hockey League. It was completed in 1998, at a cost of US$185 million, almost entirely publicly financed, and features 70 suites and 2,623 club seats.

==History==


In 1992, Wayne Huizenga obtained a new NHL franchise that would eventually become the Florida Panthers. Until the team had an arena of their own, they initially played at the now-demolished Miami Arena, sharing the venue with the NBA&#x27;s Miami Heat. Sunrise City Manager Pat Salerno made public a $167-million financing and construction plan for a civic center near the Sawgrass Expressway in December 1995, and Broward County approved construction in February 1996. In June 1996, the site was chosen by the Panthers, and in July, Alex Muxo gathered more than a dozen architects, engineers and contractors for the first major design brainstorming session. Architects Ellerbe Becket were given 26 months to build the arena, which had to be ready by August 30, 1998, to accommodate the 1998–99 NHL season. Despite never having designed a facility that had taken less than 31 months from start to finish, they accepted the job.
Seventy suites were completed with wet bars, closed circuit monitors and leather upholstery. Also home to private lounge box seating, all construction activity was generated by over fifty subcontractors and 2.3 million man hours without a single injury. Known as the Broward County Civic Center during construction, the naming rights were won in July 1998 by National Car Rental — a company purchased by Huizenga in January 1997 — leading to the venue being named the National Car Rental Center. A certificate of occupancy was given on September 12, 1998, and the arena opened on October 3, 1998, with a Celine Dion concert. The next day, Elton John performed, and on October 9, 1998, the Florida Panthers had their first home game at their new arena, a 4–1 win against their cross-state rival, The Tampa Bay Lightning.

As NRC&#x27;s new parent company, ANC Rental, went bankrupt in 2002, the Panthers sought a new sponsor for the arena. It became the Office Depot Center in the summer of 2002. Just over three years later, the arena&#x27;s name changed again; it became the BankAtlantic Center on September 6, 2005 (BankAtlantic was headquartered in nearby Fort Lauderdale). After BB&amp;T acquired BankAtlantic in July 2012, the arena was rebranded as the BB&amp;T Center.

In October 2012, Sunrise Sports and Entertainment completed installation of the Club Red [now Amerant Vault] which is a 12,000+ square-foot exclusive lounge for concerts, shows, and events including a center ice view for hockey games.

On May 14, 2013, Broward County voted to fund a new scoreboard for the county-owned arena. On October 11, 2013, the scoreboard made its debut for the Panthers&#x27; 2013–14 home opener.

In February 2019, it was announced that BB&amp;T would be merging with SunTrust Banks to form Truist Financial Corporation. The merged company decided to not renew the naming rights agreement after it expired in 2021. The arena was temporary named FLA Live Arena until a new rights partner was found. On September 19, 2023, it was announced that Amerant Bank, a South Florida-based bank, would be the new rights partner, renaming the arena to Amerant Bank Arena.

The arena is currently the largest in Florida.

<text>Anne Kirkbride (21 June 1954 – 19 January 2015) was an English actress, best known for her long-running role as Deirdre Barlow in the ITV soap &quot;Coronation Street&quot;, which she played for 42 years from 1972 to 2014. For this role, she posthumously received the Outstanding Achievement Award at the 2015 British Soap Awards.

==Early life==
She was born in Oldham, Lancashire, the daughter of Jack Kirkbride, a cartoonist for the &quot;Oldham Evening Chronicle&quot;. She attended Counthill Grammar School, Oldham, and then joined Oldham Repertory Theatre as an assistant stage manager, before progressing to acting roles.

==Career==

===&quot;Coronation Street&quot;===
Kirkbride was noticed by casting directors for the British soap opera &quot;Coronation Street&quot; when she acted in a Jack Rosenthal play, &quot;Another Sunday and Sweet F.A.&quot; (1972), for Granada Television. She played the bit part of Deirdre Hunt in &quot;Coronation Street&quot; from November 1972. The character&#x27;s role grew and after further appearances in 1973, Kirkbride signed a contract with the serial in 1974. From then on, the character of Deirdre Langton, later Barlow became known for her very large spectacles and her husky voice (a result of Kirkbride&#x27;s own chain smoking).

On 29 September 2014, it was announced Kirkbride would have a three-month break from the show and prior to her death, she had filmed no official last scenes, making her final scenes the ones aired on 8 October 2014 with her character&#x27;s absence in the soap being explained as staying with a friend until July 2015, when the death of her character Deirdre was announced by Bev Unwin (Susie Blake) returning to tell Ken and Tracy that she died on the day of her 60th birthday party and homecoming. At the 2015 British Soap Awards, she posthumously received the Outstanding Achievement award, which was accepted by her husband.

===Other television appearances===
Kirkbride was the subject of &quot;This Is Your Life&quot; in 1998, when she was surprised by Michael Aspel on the set of &quot;Coronation Street&quot;.

In 2012, Kirkbride completed a documentary entitled &quot;Deirdre &amp; Me&quot;, a 60-minute special to celebrate her 40th year of playing Deirdre. She also completed a documentary in 2001 also entitled &quot;Deirdre &amp; Me&quot;. Her late father Jack Kirkbride also gave an interview in the documentary in 2001.

In 2007, Kirkbride starred in the first episode of &quot;You Don&#x27;t Know You&#x27;re Born&quot;, a genealogy documentary on ITV1. It was revealed she had Irish ancestry in Gort, County Galway.

==Personal life==
In October 1983 Kirkbride was fined £250 and ordered to pay £25 costs for cannabis possession. Kirkbride married former actor David Beckett on 24 June 1992 at Holy Trinity Church, Dobcross. They met on the set of &quot;Coronation Street&quot;, when Beckett joined the cast as her character Deirdre&#x27;s boyfriend. She was a lifelong heavy smoker.

In 1993, Kirkbride was diagnosed with non-Hodgkin&#x27;s lymphoma. She spoke to the British press about her bout of depression following the diagnosis. She was cured within a year of being diagnosed.

==Death==

Kirkbride died at a Manchester hospital on 19 January 2015, aged 60, of breast cancer, which had metastasised to her brain. Her funeral was held on 27 January 2015 in a private ceremony. William Roache, Beverley Callard, Kate Ford and former co-star Johnny Briggs were in attendance.
At the 20th National Television Awards, held two days after Kirkbride&#x27;s death, her on-screen partner and close friend from &quot;Coronation Street&quot;, William Roache, paid tribute to Kirkbride during the ceremony. The actor Adam Woodyatt dedicated the Best British Soap award &quot;EastEnders&quot; won to Kirkbride, referring to her as &quot;the Weatherfield One&quot;, referencing the &quot;Coronation Street&quot; storyline which saw Deirdre wrongly imprisoned for fraud.

A public memorial service for Kirkbride was held at Manchester Cathedral on 30 May 2015.

<doc id="753939" wikidata="Q5177956" url="?curid=753939" title="Coup (bridge)">
<text>In contract bridge, coup is a generic name for various techniques in play, denoting a specific pattern in the lie and the play of cards; it is a special play maneuver by declarer.

There are various types of coup which can be effected.

==Pure coups==
There are many coups which the opponents can do little to prevent.

;Bath coup
The original coup was referred to as the Bath Coup, whereby a player holding the Ace, Jack and small card(s) plays small against the lead of a King-Queen sequence, so as to get two tricks (if the suit is continued) or gain tempo.

;Belladonna coup
The declarer&#x27;s act of playing low card below king from Kx-Jxx combination in a suit contract, in order to tangle defender&#x27;s communications for trumping, ensuring either a trick in the suit or a third-round ruff.

;Crocodile coup
The crocodile coup is a technique used by the defense. It is executed by second hand, following suit with a higher card than apparently necessary, to keep fourth hand from winning and thereby being endplayed.

;Deschapelles coup
The act of sacrificing a card that would ordinarily be an eventual winner (such as an offside King) to establish an entry into partner&#x27;s hand.

;Devil&#x27;s coup
The Devil&#x27;s coup is the act of stopping defenders getting a trump trick from Qx opposite Jxx - surely the work of the Devil?

;Coup en passant
The act of ruffing through the player who has bigger trump(s), so that the trump is taken either by ruffing or by making it master trump if the other player ruffs.

;Galileo coup
The Galileo coup is so named because Galileo Galilei is usually credited with the invention of the telescope; this coup arises when the contract is in a suit in which the declaring side is missing both the Ace and King; if successful, the defenders end up being forced to play the Ace and King of trumps to the same trick, thus &quot;telescoping&quot; their two trump tricks into one.

;Grand coup
A trump coup where the cards ruffed in order to execute a trump reduction are winners.

;Merrimac coup
The Merrimac coup is the act of sacrificing an honour (usually a King) in order to remove an entry from an opponent&#x27;s hand.

;Morton&#x27;s fork coup
The forcing of an opponent to choose between establishing one or more extra tricks in the suit led and losing the opportunity to win a trick in the suit led.

;Scissors coup
The Scissors coup is so named because it cuts communications between defenders, most commonly by discarding a key card from either the declarer&#x27;s own hand or dummy. This enables declarer to prevent the defenders transferring the lead; usually for a defensive ruff.

;Trump coup
The Trump coup happens in the end-game when declarer needs to finesse in trumps but doesn&#x27;t have one to lead up. It is often associated with a Trump Reduction.

;Vienna coup
The Vienna coup is the act of cashing an ace opposite the queen (or, more generically, an immediate winner opposite a menace) in order to enable a squeeze to work on either opponent.

==Deceptive coups ==
Some coups rely on the opponents making a mistake.

;Grosvenor gambit
The act of deliberately misplaying a hand in order to induce a mistake by an opponent which results in either the same or a superior result. Even when the gambit does not yield a material gain, it usually induces a big psychological impact on the opponents who were offered a trick for free but couldn&#x27;t have believed it were possible.

;Idiot coup
The act of only losing one trick when missing AKx of trumps. Declarer leads through one of the defenders hoping they will play the king from Kx which then falls under their partner&#x27;s stiff ace. Obviously going up with the king is foolish because if declarer holds the ace, he has a legitimate line whereby he can escape a loser (play the ace and hope for stiff king or take a finesse), hence the name.

An Idiot coup can also refer to a play that appears to present an alternative (losing) option to an opponent, but upon closer inspection could not possibly be the right one. For example, suppose declarer holds xx opposite KT in dummy. During the play of another suit LHO, who is holding AJx, discards the jack, knowing that he is only entitled to one trick in the suit in any case. Now when declarer leads the small card toward dummy and LHO follows low, he might think he has a &quot;guess&quot; in the suit, when in fact LHO would have no reason to discard the jack if he also had the queen. (That is, unless LHO is trying to Grosvenor him.)

==Illegal coups==
There are also a number of illegal coups:

;Alcatraz coup
The Alcatraz coup is performed by purposely revoking when declarer is uncertain which defender to finesse. After the trick is over, declarer knows which defender to finesse, &quot;notices&quot; and corrects his misplay, and finesses the correct defender.

;Superglue coup
The Superglue Coup is where a defender pulls out two cards together (as if they were superglued together). Declarer sees the cards and assumes they are adjacent in rank in the defender&#x27;s hand. For example, if declarer is missing K103 and one defender pulls the K and 3 out together declarer can assume that the defender does not have the 10.

<doc id="753941" wikidata="Q39177" url="?curid=753941" title="Lenovo Center">
<text>Lenovo Center (originally Raleigh Entertainment &amp; Sports Arena and formerly RBC Center and PNC Arena) is an indoor arena located in Raleigh, North Carolina, United States. The arena seats 18,700 for ice hockey and 19,500 for basketball, including 61 suites, 13 luxury boxes and 2,045 club level seats. The building has three concourses and a 300-seat restaurant.

Lenovo Center is home to the Carolina Hurricanes of the National Hockey League and the men&#x27;s basketball program of North Carolina State University. The arena neighbors Carter–Finley Stadium, home of the North Carolina State University football team and the North Carolina State Fairgrounds. The arena also hosted the Carolina Cobras of the Arena Football League from 2000 to 2002. It is the fourth-largest arena in the ACC (after the JMA Wireless Dome, KFC Yum! Center and the Dean Smith Center) and the eighth-largest arena in the NCAA.

The arena opened in 1999 at an estimated construction cost of $158 million. Taxpayers covered half of the construction cost while the team paid the other half. In 2023, the Hurricanes signed an agreement with local government to lease the arena for 20 years in exchange for $300 million in public subsidies for renovations to the arena. As part of the deal, Hurricanes billionaire owner Tom Dundon said he would develop surrounding vacant land into an $800 million mixed-use development.

==History==
The idea of a new basketball arena to replace the Wolfpack&#x27;s longtime home, Reynolds Coliseum, first emerged in the 1980s under the vision of then-Wolfpack coach Jim Valvano. In 1989, the NCSU Trustees approved plans to build a 23,000-seat arena. The Centennial Authority was created by the North Carolina General Assembly in 1995 as the governing entity of the arena, then financed by state appropriation, local contributions, and university fundraising. The Centennial Authority refocused the project into a multi-use arena, leading to the 1997 relocation agreement of the then-Hartford Whalers, who would become the Carolina Hurricanes. Construction began that year and was completed in 1999 with an estimated cost of $158 million, which was largely publicly financed by a hotel and restaurant tax. The Hurricanes agreed to pay $60 million of the cost, and the state of North Carolina paid $18 million. As part of the deal, the Hurricanes assumed operational control of the arena.

Known as the Raleigh Entertainment and Sports Arena (ESA) from 1999 to 2002, it was renamed the RBC Center after an extended search for a corporate sponsor. RBC Bank, the US division of the Royal Bank of Canada (whose headquarters were in Raleigh), acquired 20-year naming rights for a reported $80 million. On June 19, 2011, it was announced that PNC Financial Services bought US assets of RBC Bank and acquired the naming rights to the arena pending approval by the regulatory agencies. On December 15, 2011, the Centennial Authority, the landlord of the arena, approved a name change for the facility to PNC Arena. The name change officially took place on March 15, 2012. PNC&#x27;s naming rights expired on August 31, 2024. On September 12, 2024, the Centennial Authority approved a name change to Lenovo Center after the Chinese technology company Lenovo, whose American headquarters are based in nearby Morrisville, secured naming rights for ten years. On a normal hockey day, Lenovo Center has more than 400 people on duty for security and concessions.

The arena has also seen use in fictional media, as a season four episode of The CW series &quot;One Tree Hill&quot; saw the Tree Hill High School Ravens playing a NCHSAA championship game in the venue. It was also the taping site for the 2005 &quot;Jeopardy! College Tournament&quot;.

===Hockey===
Raleigh experienced its first NHL game on October 29, 1999, when the Hurricanes hosted the New Jersey Devils on the building&#x27;s opening night. The first playoff series at the Entertainment and Sports Arena were held in 2001 when the Hurricanes hosted the Devils in games 3, 4, and 6, of the 2001 Stanley Cup playoffs, but the Hurricanes lost in 6. The ESA (by then the renamed RBC Center) hosted games of both the 2002 Stanley Cup playoffs and Stanley Cup Finals; however, the Hurricanes lost in the Stanley Cup Finals. On June 19, 2006, the Hurricanes were on home ice for a decisive game seven of the Stanley Cup Finals, defeating the Edmonton Oilers 3–1 to bring the franchise its first Stanley Cup and North Carolina its first and only major professional sports championship. The arena hosted the playoffs again in 2009, with the Hurricanes losing in the Eastern Conference Finals. In 2019, the arena hosted the Stanley Cup playoffs for the first time in 10 years, with fans setting a single-game record attendance of 19,495 in game 4 of the second round versus the New York Islanders. This record would be further extended on May 14, 2022, when the Hurricanes defeated the Boston Bruins 3–2 in game 7 of the first round, to advance to the Second Round, in front of 19,513 fans.

In March 2025, the arena will host a neutral site match between the Minnesota Frost and Ottawa Charge of the Professional Women&#x27;s Hockey League during the 2024–25 PWHL season.

==Renovations==

In 2003, a ribbon board which encircles the arena bowl was installed. In 2008, the arena renovated its sound system. Clair Brothers Systems installed a combination of JBL line arrays to provide improved audio coverage for all events. In June 2009, video crews installed a new Daktronics HD scoreboard. It replaced the ten-year-old scoreboard that had been in the arena since its opening in 1999. The scoreboard was full LED and four-sided with full video displays, whereas the previous scoreboard was eight-sided; four of those sides featured alternating static dot-matrix displays (very much outdated for today&#x27;s standards). In addition, the scoreboard featured an octagonal top section with full video capability, along with two rings above and below the main video screens; they were similar to the ribbon board encircling the arena.

In October 2015, architects met with the Centennial Authority to discuss a potential arena renovation. Their proposal includes all-new entrances, a new rooftop restaurant and bar, covered tailgating sections, and moving the administrative offices elsewhere in the arena as a result. The plans also call for new office spaces, additional meeting spaces, removing stairwells and aisles, adding wider seats, and perhaps building lounges on the mezzanine levels below the main concourse level. Project costs were not decided, as the architects were given until May/June 2016 to come up with estimates. The cost was estimated to be almost $200 million. The Centennial Authority would have to approve the estimates before official voting. If the funds had been approved the renovation would&#x27;ve started in 2020 and been completed by 2022 at the earliest. However, this would not come to pass.

During mid-2016, the ribbon boards were upgraded and a second ribbon board was added to the upper level fascia. Static advertising signs inside the lower bowl of the arena were replaced with LED video boards. In 2018, they renovated the NHL home locker rooms and replaced the seating in the upper bowl as well as an ice/court projection system that was first used December 23 at a Hurricanes game against the Boston Bruins.

In April 2019, it was announced that the arena would receive a new Daktronics video board later that year. The board would be nearly three times as large as the then-current board. The new video board would feature a full 360 degree display, two underbelly screens and two underbelly static advertising signs. It will also be the first of its kind and one of only a few 360 degree video boards in the NHL. The board would cost $4.7 million, would stretch blue line to blue line, and would be . Original plans called for a 2018 installation, but the project was postponed due to structural/roof issues. The old video board was taken down on June 1, 2019. The new board debuted on September 18, 2019.

In November 2019, Raleigh approved funding for the arena at $9 million a year for 25 years for arena enhancements, putting the grand total to $200 million. Some concessions in the arena were updated in 2019 in addition to the LED upgrade. These included a new marketplace in the upper concourse as well as other concessions renovated and a new color changing lighting system on the exterior of the South End. The Centennial Authority (operating group) and the Hurricanes are also meeting to further discuss the future renovations and the future of the Hurricanes at Lenovo Center. Most offices were expected to move out before the 2020–21 NHL season and renovations were to start. Plans for renovations are currently on hold.

In April 2022, it was announced that Invisalign would become an official arena partner, extending their partnership with the Carolina Hurricanes. Following this announcement, the East and West arena entrances were respectively renamed to become the &quot;Invisalign East Entrance&quot; and &quot;Invisalign West Entrance.&quot;

After being put on hold during the COVID-19 pandemic, the renovation project was reconsidered. The Centennial Authority met with local officials, the Carolina Hurricanes, and National Hockey League Commissioner Gary Bettman in May 2022. After discussion, the Centennial Authority approved the continuation of the project, while also inviting CAA ICON to design the project. Plans call for renovations inside the arena, as well as on surrounding land to become &quot;one of the top entertainment venues in the Southeast.&quot; Additionally, there are plans for a new outdoor concert venue on site.

In June 2022, the arena board approved a $25.8 million budget for the fiscal year (begins July 2022), that would be utilized on 17 different enhancement projects, including a $7.8 million replacement of the arena roof.

On August 15, 2023, the Centennial Authority, Carolina Hurricanes, and NC State University announced intentions to move forward with renovation &amp; redevelopment plans. Expected to begin in 2024, the arena will see $300M in renovations from public funding. In addition, the Hurricanes promised to privately fund and develop the 80 acres of land at a cost of $200M within 5 years, $400M within 10 years, and $800M within 20 years. Phase one will include at least 100,000 sq ft of retail/dining, 150,000 sq ft of office space, 200 multi-family residential units, a 150-room hotel, and a 3,000-5,000 capacity indoor music venue. 10% of residential units throughout all phases will not exceed 80% of the area&#x27;s median income levels. In addition, 95% of the 4,000 surface parking spaces lost will be replaced with parking decks.

<doc id="753942" wikidata="Q466575" url="?curid=753942" title="Middle-square method">
<text>In mathematics and computer science, the middle-square method is a method of generating pseudorandom numbers. In practice it is a highly flawed method for many practical purposes, since its period is usually very short and it has some severe weaknesses; repeated enough times, the middle-square method will either begin repeatedly generating the same number or cycle to a previous number in the sequence and loop indefinitely.

== History == 
===In mathematics===
The method was invented by John von Neumann, and was described by him at a conference in 1949.

In the 1949 talk, Von Neumann quipped that &quot;Anyone who considers arithmetical methods of producing random digits is, of course, in a state of sin.&quot; What he meant, he elaborated, was that there were no true &quot;random numbers&quot;, just means to produce them, and &quot;a strict arithmetic procedure&quot;, like the middle-square method, &quot;is not such a method&quot;. Nevertheless, he found these methods hundreds of times faster than reading &quot;truly&quot; random numbers off punch cards, which had practical importance for his ENIAC work. He found the &quot;destruction&quot; of middle-square sequences to be a factor in their favor, because it could be easily detected: &quot;one always fears the appearance of undetected short cycles&quot;. Nicholas Metropolis reported sequences of 750,000 digits before &quot;destruction&quot; by means of using 38-bit numbers with the &quot;middle-square&quot; method.

The book &quot;The Broken Dice&quot; by Ivar Ekeland gives an extended account of how the method was invented by a Franciscan friar known only as Brother Edvin sometime between 1240 and 1250. Supposedly, the manuscript is now lost, but Jorge Luis Borges sent Ekeland a copy that he made at the Vatican Library.

Modifying the middle-square algorithm with a Weyl sequence improves period and randomness.

== The method == 
To generate a sequence of &quot;n&quot;-digit pseudorandom numbers, an &quot;n&quot;-digit starting value is created and squared, producing a 2&quot;n&quot;-digit number. If the result has fewer than 2&quot;n&quot; digits, leading zeroes are added to compensate. The middle &quot;n&quot; digits of the result would be the next number in the sequence and returned as the result. This process is then repeated to generate more numbers. 

The value of &quot;n&quot; must be even in order for the method to work if the value of &quot;n&quot; is odd, then there will not necessarily be a uniquely defined &quot;middle &quot;n&quot;-digits&quot; to select from. Consider the following: If a 3-digit number is squared, it can yield a 6-digit number (e.g. 540&quot;2&quot; = 291600). If there were to be middle 3 digits, that would leave 6 − 3 = 3 digits to be distributed to the left and right of the middle. It is impossible to evenly distribute these digits equally on both sides of the middle number, and therefore there are no &quot;middle digits&quot;. It is acceptable to pad the seeds with zeros to the left in order to create an even valued &quot;n&quot;-digit number (e.g. 540 → 0540).

For a generator of &quot;n&quot;-digit numbers, the period can be no longer than 8&quot;n&quot;. If the middle &quot;n&quot; digits are all zeroes, the generator then outputs zeroes forever. If the first half of a number in the sequence is zeroes, the subsequent numbers will be decreasing to zero. While these runs of zero are easy to detect, they occur too frequently for this method to be of practical use. The middle-squared method can also get stuck on a number other than zero. For &quot;n&quot; = 4, this occurs with the values 0100, 2500, 3792, and 7600. Other seed values form very short repeating cycles, e.g., 0540 → 2916 → 5030 → 3009. These phenomena are even more obvious when &quot;n&quot; = 2, as none of the 100 possible seeds generates more than 14 iterations without reverting to 0, 10, 50, 60, or a 24 ↔ 57 loop.

=== Example implementation ===
Here, the algorithm is rendered in Python 3.12.

seed_number = int(input(&quot;Please enter a four-digit number:\n[####] &quot;))
number = seed_number
already_seen = set()
counter = 0

while number not in already_seen:
 counter += 1
 already_seen.add(number)
 number = int(str(number * number).zfill(8)[2:6]) # zfill adds padding of zeroes
 print(f&quot;#{counter}: {number}&quot;)

print(f&quot;We began with {seed_number} and&quot;
 f&quot; have repeated ourselves after {counter} steps&quot;
 f&quot; with {number}.&quot;)

<doc id="753944" wikidata="Q1091134" url="?curid=753944" title="Commensurability (mathematics)">
<text>In mathematics, two non-zero real numbers &quot;a&quot; and &quot;b&quot; are said to be commensurable if their ratio &quot;&quot; is a rational number; otherwise &quot;a&quot; and &quot;b&quot; are called incommensurable. (Recall that a rational number is one that is equivalent to the ratio of two integers.) There is a more general notion of commensurability in group theory.

For example, the numbers 3 and 2 are commensurable because their ratio, , is a rational number. The numbers formula_1 and formula_2 are also commensurable because their ratio, formula_3, is a rational number. However, the numbers formula_4 and 2 are incommensurable because their ratio, formula_5, is an irrational number. 

More generally, it is immediate from the definition that if &quot;a&quot; and &quot;b&quot; are any two non-zero rational numbers, then &quot;a&quot; and &quot;b&quot; are commensurable; it is also immediate that if &quot;a&quot; is any irrational number and &quot;b&quot; is any non-zero rational number, then &quot;a&quot; and &quot;b&quot; are incommensurable. On the other hand, if both &quot;a&quot; and &quot;b&quot; are irrational numbers, then &quot;a&quot; and &quot;b&quot; may or may not be commensurable.

==History of the concept==
The Pythagoreans are credited with the proof of the existence of irrational numbers. When the ratio of the &quot;lengths&quot; of two line segments is irrational, the line segments &quot;themselves&quot; (not just their lengths) are also described as being incommensurable.

A separate, more general and circuitous ancient Greek for geometric magnitude was developed in Book V of Euclid&#x27;s &quot;Elements&quot; in order to allow proofs involving incommensurable lengths, thus avoiding arguments which applied only to a historically restricted definition of number.

Euclid&#x27;s notion of commensurability is anticipated in passing in the discussion between Socrates and the slave boy in Plato&#x27;s dialogue entitled Meno, in which Socrates uses the boy&#x27;s own inherent capabilities to solve a complex geometric problem through the Socratic Method. He develops a proof which is, for all intents and purposes, very Euclidean in nature and speaks to the concept of incommensurability.

The usage primarily comes from translations of Euclid&#x27;s &quot;Elements&quot;, in which two line segments &quot;a&quot; and &quot;b&quot; are called commensurable precisely if there is some third segment &quot;c&quot; that can be laid end-to-end a whole number of times to produce a segment congruent to &quot;a&quot;, and also, with a different whole number, a segment congruent to &quot;b&quot;. Euclid did not use any concept of real number, but he used a notion of congruence of line segments, and of one such segment being longer or shorter than another.

That &quot;&quot; is rational is a necessary and sufficient condition for the existence of some real number &quot;c&quot;, and integers &quot;m&quot; and &quot;n&quot;, such that

:&quot;a&quot; = &quot;mc&quot; and &quot;b&quot; = &quot;nc&quot;.

Assuming for simplicity that &quot;a&quot; and &quot;b&quot; are positive, one can say that a ruler, marked off in units of length &quot;c&quot;, could be used to measure out both a line segment of length &quot;a&quot;, and one of length &quot;b&quot;. That is, there is a common unit of length in terms of which &quot;a&quot; and &quot;b&quot; can both be measured; this is the origin of the term. Otherwise the pair &quot;a&quot; and &quot;b&quot; are incommensurable.

==In group theory==

In group theory, two subgroups Γ1 and Γ2 of a group &quot;G&quot; are said to be commensurable if the intersection Γ1 ∩ Γ2 is of finite index in both Γ1 and Γ2. 

Example: Let &quot;a&quot; and &quot;b&quot; be nonzero real numbers. Then the subgroup of the real numbers R generated by &quot;a&quot; is commensurable with the subgroup generated by &quot;b&quot; if and only if the real numbers &quot;a&quot; and &quot;b&quot; are commensurable, in the sense that &quot;a&quot;/&quot;b&quot; is rational. Thus the group-theoretic notion of commensurability generalizes the concept for real numbers. 

There is a similar notion for two groups which are not given as subgroups of the same group. Two groups &quot;G&quot;1 and &quot;G&quot;2 are (abstractly) commensurable if there are subgroups &quot;H&quot;1 ⊂ &quot;G&quot;1 and &quot;H&quot;2 ⊂ &quot;G&quot;2 of finite index such that &quot;H&quot;1 is isomorphic to &quot;H&quot;2.

==In topology==
Two path-connected topological spaces are sometimes said to be &quot;commensurable&quot; if they have homeomorphic finite-sheeted covering spaces. Depending on the type of space under consideration, one might want to use homotopy equivalences or diffeomorphisms instead of homeomorphisms in the definition. If two spaces are commensurable, then their fundamental groups are commensurable.

Example: any two closed surfaces of genus at least 2 are commensurable with each other.

<text>The National Guard () is a French military, gendarmerie, and police reserve force, active in its current form since 2016 but originally founded in 1789 during the French Revolution.

For most of its history the National Guard, particularly its officers, has been widely viewed as loyal to middle-class interests.
It was founded as separate from the French Army and existed both for policing and as a military reserve. However, in its original stages from 1792 to 1795, the National Guard was perceived as revolutionary and the lower ranks were identified with sans-culottes. It experienced a period of official dissolution from 1827 to 1830 but was reestablished. Soon after the Franco-Prussian War of 1870–71, the National Guard in Paris again became viewed as dangerously revolutionary, which contributed to its dissolution in 1871.

In 2016, France announced the reestablishment of the National Guard for the second time, in response to a series of terrorist attacks in the country.

==Creation==
The raising of a &quot;Bourgeois Guard&quot; (&quot;garde bourgeoise&quot;) for Paris was discussed by the National Assembly on 11 July 1789 in response to the King&#x27;s sudden and alarming replacement of minister for finance and state, Jacques Necker, with the Baron de Breteuil on that day. The replacement caused rapidly spread anger and violence throughout Paris. The National Assembly declared the formation of a &quot;Bourgeois Militia&quot; (&quot;milice bourgeoise&quot;) on 13 July. In the early morning of the next day, the search for weapons for this new militia led to the storming of the town hall, the Hotel des Invalides and then the storming of the Bastille.

Lafayette was elected to the post of commander in chief of the Bourgeois Militia on 14 July, and it was renamed the &quot;National Guard of Paris&quot;. When the French Guards mutinied and were disbanded during the same month, the majority of this former royal regiment&#x27;s rank and file became the full-time cadre of the Paris National Guard. Similar bodies of National Guards were spontaneously created in the towns and rural districts of France in response to widespread fears of chaos or counter-revolution. &quot;Bourgeois Militia&quot; changed its name to National Guard, like in Limoges in November 1789, where no other military bodies were allowed.

Initially, each city, town and village maintained National Guard units operated by their respective local governments in the districts for not more than a year. They were united on 14 July 1790 under Lafayette, who was appointed &quot;Commandant General of all the National Guards of the Kingdom&quot; and was responsible to the King as commander-in-chief of the armed forces.

===Organization===
On 5 December 1790 Robespierre held a speech on the urgent topic of the National Guard; envisaging an evolution from semi-organised militia to citizen-soldiers independent from the regular army. He repeated his ideas in the following year. On 18 December it was decreed to supply the National Guard with 50,000 fusils. In January 1791 Robespierre promoted the idea not only the National Guard but also the people had to be armed if necessary with pikes. On 27 April 1791, Robespierre again opposed the plans for reorganizing the National Guard and restricting its membership to active citizens. On 22 April and 15 June 1791, the Parliament recruited 400,000 National volunteers from the entire French National Guard. On 17 July 1791 Champ de Mars massacre took place. At the end of September a law passed to reorganize the National Guard formations in cantons and districts; each year officers and non-commissioned officers could be elected on 14 July.

Under the law of 14 October 1791, all active citizens and their children over 18 years were obliged to enlist in the National Guard. Their role was the maintenance of law and order and, if necessary, territorial defense in wartime. Following a nationwide scheme decided on in September 1791, the National Guard was organised on the basis of district or canton companies. Five of these neighbourhood units (designated as fusiliers or grenadiers) made up a National Guard infantry battalion. Eight to ten battalions comprised a &quot;legion&quot;. Districts might also provide companies of veterans and young citizens, respectively drawn from volunteers over 60 or under 18. Where possible, there was provision for mounted detachments and artillery batteries under the Guard.

* The 23-years-old Napoleon Bonaparte began his &quot;political career&quot; as lieutenant-colonel of a Battalion of Corsican Volunteers in the National Guards (la Garde nationale des Volontaires corses) in February 1792. 
* Chevalier de Saint-Georges was one of the first in Lille to join its &quot;Garde Nationale&quot;.

On 2 July 1792, the Assembly authorized the National Guard&#x27;s attendance as part of the Festival of Federation on 14 July, thus circumventing a royal veto. Section assemblies were permitting &quot;passive&quot; citizens to join their National Guard companies without seeking formal permission. On 11 July, the Jacobins won an emergency vote in the wavering Assembly, declaring the nation in danger and drafting all Parisians with pikes or pistols into the National Guard. On 17 July the municipality of Paris accepted all citizens armed with a pike for enlistment as part of the capital&#x27;s own National Guard unit.

The citizens kept their weapons and their uniforms at home and set forth with them when required. The initially multi-coloured uniforms of the various provincial National Guard units were standardised in 1791, using as a model the dark blue coats with red collars, white lapels and cuffs worn by the Paris National Guard since its creation. This combination of colours matched those of the then young revolutionary tricolour flag. The uniform headdress was the tricorne.

==From French Revolution until 1827==

===Role during the Revolution===
The formation of the National Guard can be seen as a response to public demand for maintaining order, while at the same time reducing or ending its dependence on the monarchy. The former Guet royal had held responsibility for the maintenance of law and order in Paris from 1254 to 1791, when the National Guard took over this role. In fact, the last commander of the Guet royal (&quot;Chevalier du Guet&quot;), de La Rothière, was elected to head the National Guard in 1791. In the summer of 1792, the fundamental character of the guard changed. The &quot;fédérés&quot; were admitted to the guard and the subsequent takeover of the guard by Antoine Joseph Santerre when Mandat was murdered in the first hours of the insurrection of 10 August placed a radical revolutionary at the head of the Guard. After the abolition of the monarchy (21 September 1792), the National Guard fought for the Revolution and it had an important role in forcing the wishes of the capital on the French National Assembly which was obliged to give way in front of the force of the &quot;patriotic&quot; bayonets. The Insurrection of 31 May started after François Henriot was chosen by the Commune to lead the Paris Guards.

After 9 Thermidor, year II (27 July 1794), the new government of the Thermidorian Reaction placed the National Guard under the control of more conservative leadership. Part of the National Guard then attempted to overthrow the Directory during the royalist insurrection on the 13 Vendémiaire, year IV (5 October 1795), but was defeated by forces led by Napoleon Bonaparte in the Battle of 13 Vendémiaire. The Paris National Guard thereafter ceased to play a significant political role.

===First Empire===
Napoleon did not believe that the middle-class National Guard would be able to maintain order and suppress riots. Therefore, he created a &quot;Municipal Guard of Paris&quot;, a full-time gendarmerie which was strongly militarized. However, he did not abolish the National Guard but was content to partially disarm it. He kept the force in reserve and mobilised it for the defence of French territory in 1809 and 1814. In Paris during this period the National Guard comprised twelve thousand bourgeois property owners, serving part-time and equipped at their own expense, whose prime function was to guard public buildings on a roster basis. Between 1811 and 1812 the National Guard was organized in &quot;cohorts&quot; to distinguish it from the regular army, and for home defence &quot;only&quot;. By a skilful appeal to patriotism, and judicious pressure applied through the prefects, it became a useful reservoir of half-trained men for new battalions of the active army.

After the disastrous campaign in Russia in 1812, dozens of National Guard cohorts were called up for field duty the next year; four cohorts being combined to form one line infantry regiment. The 135ème to 156ème &quot;Régiments d&#x27;Infanterie de Ligne&quot; were thus formed. Many of these fought in the campaigns in Germany in 1813 and the invasion of north-east France by Coalition forces in 1814. Existing National Guard units, such as those of Paris, were deployed as defence corps in their areas of recruitment. Mass conscription was extended to age groups previously exempt from military service, to provide more manpower for the expanded National Guard. Students and volunteers from gamekeepers and other professional groups formed separate units within the National Guard. Clothing and equipment were often in short supply and even the Paris National Guard was obliged to provide pikes as substitute weapons for some of its new recruits. These field and regional units were disbanded in 1814 after the abdication of Napoleon I.

Six thousand national guardsmen took part in the Battle of Paris in 1814. Following the occupation of Paris by the allied armies, the National Guard was expanded to 35,000 men and became the primary force for maintaining order within the city.

===The Restoration===
Under the Restoration in 1814, the National Guard was maintained by Louis XVIII of France. Initially, the Guard, purged of its Napoleonic leadership, maintained good relations with the restored monarchy. The future Charles X served as its Colonel-General, reviewed the force regularly and intervened to veto its proposed disbandment on the grounds of economy by the &quot;Conseil&quot;. However, by 1827, the middle-class men who still composed the Guard had come to feel a degree of hostility towards the reactionary monarchy. Following hostile cries, at a review on 29 April Charles X dissolved the Guard the following day, on the grounds of offensive behaviour towards the crown. He neglected to disarm the disbanded force, and its muskets resurfaced in 1830 during the July Revolution.

==National Guard from 1831 to 1872==

A new National Guard was established in 1831 following the July Revolution in 1830. It played a major role in suppressing the Paris June Rebellion of 1832 against the government of King Louis-Phillipe. However, the same National Guard fought in the Revolution of 1848 in favour of the republicans. This change in allegiance reflected a general erosion in the popularity of Louis-Phillipe and his &quot;Bourgeois Monarchy&quot;, rather than any fundamental change in the make-up of the National Guard, which remained a middle-class body.

===Second Empire===
Napoleon III confined the National Guard during the Second Empire to subordinate tasks to reduce its liberal and republican influence. During the Franco-Prussian War the Government of National Defense of 1870 called on the Guard to undertake a major role in defending Paris against the invading Prussian army. During the uprising of the Paris Commune, from March to May 1871, the National Guard in Paris was expanded to include all able-bodied citizens capable of carrying weapons. Following the Commune&#x27;s defeat by the regular French Army, the National Guard was officially abolished and its units disbanded. Also disbanded was the Mobile National Guard (&quot;Garde Nationale Mobile&quot;) raised in 1866 to provide personnel and officers for rapid deployment operations nationwide, as well as to provide reserve personnel for the armed forces.

===End of the National Guard (1872)===
Despite its major role in the Franco-Prussian War, the National Guard was disbanded soon after the establishment of the Third Republic. Having been converted from a volunteer reserve into a much larger force composed mainly of conscripts, the National Guard had lost its identity and &quot;raison d&#x27;être&quot;. It also faced opposition from the regular army which was opposed to such a large armed force outside its direct control. The role of the Paris units of the National Guard in the uprising of the Paris Commune led to a great degree of hostility towards the National Guard, especially from the army.

Perceived as an embodiment of the revolutionary republican &quot;nation in arms&quot; at the time of the Revolution of 1789, the National Guard was formally disbanded on 14 March 1872 as a threat to the security and order of the new Third Republic.

The National Guard was superseded by the creation of territorial regiments, made up of older men who had completed their period of full-time military service. These reserve units were embodied only in times of general mobilisation but remained an integral part of the regular army, distinguished only by details of insignia.

==Resurrection (2016–present)==
After several terror attacks in France, which intensified in 2014–15, French President François Hollande declared the establishment of a new third National Guard. By his words, the Guard would be formed using military reserve forces.

On 12 October 2016, during a weekly meeting of the Cabinet, the National Guard was officially reconstituted after 145 years, as the fifth service branch of the French Armed Forces under the Ministry of the Armed Forces. The revitalized Guard would also reinforce elements of the National Gendarmerie and the National Police in securing major events nationwide while it would perform its historical responsibility as a national military and police reserve service.

It was expected that the new Guard would grow to a 72,500-member force in 2017 and grow to an 86,000-member national reserve in 2018. The formation of the revived Guard would be assisted with a dedicated 311-million euro budget and its personnel come from the reserves, members from the private sector and active personnel seconded to the service. Unlike the Guard of the Revolutionary Wars, its officers are now seconded from both the Army and the National Gendarmerie and are graduates of their respective academies.

As of 2024, Division General François-Xavier Poisbeau serves as the Secretary-General for the National Guard, who reports to the Chief of Defence Staff and the Minister of the Armed Forces.

<text>Macomb&#x27;s Purchase is a large historical area of northern New York in the United States purchased from the state in 1791 by Alexander Macomb, a merchant who had become wealthy during the American Revolutionary War. He acted as a land speculator, selling off portions of this land.

==History and geography==
In 1792 in the aftermath of the Revolutionary War, the state of New York was struggling financially. It opened for sale nearly five million acres of land which state officials, under pressure from land speculators and other business interests, had forced the Iroquois tribes to cede. Alexander Macomb, William Constable, and Daniel McCormick agreed to purchase nearly from the state at the extremely low price of 8 pence (New York state money) per acre. This was an enormous amount of land, about one-eighth of the entire state of New York. Convinced something illegal must have occurred, the New York State Legislature held exhaustive hearings into the land purchase, but no wrongdoing was uncovered.

Macomb, however, was unable to sell his land to settlers and developers fast enough to fund his massive purchase. He went bankrupt and was sentenced to debtor&#x27;s prison six months after the purchase was made. Macomb sold to Constable for 50,000 pounds (New York money), who six months later sold to banker Samuel Ward for 100,000 pounds. Ward, in turn, sold to James Greenleaf, the son of a wealthy Bostonian merchant.

Constable subdivided his land into numerous plots. He found buyers worldwide for the property as well. The High Sheriff of London, England purchased for a shilling an acre.

Greenleaf had purchased a cargo of tea from Rhode Island merchant John Brown (whose family funded and lent its name to Brown University). Greenleaf paid for the cargo partly in cash, and partly with the land he owned in New York. This became known as Brown&#x27;s Tract.

==Description of the area==
Macomb&#x27;s Purchase was in size. The tract included much of northern New York along the St. Lawrence River and eastern Lake Ontario (including the Thousand Islands). The purchase was eventually divided into 10 large townships. From this purchase are derived the deeds for all the lands that are now included in Lewis, Jefferson, and St. Lawrence counties, as well as portions of Franklin, Herkimer, and Oswego counties.
