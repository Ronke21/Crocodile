<text>Kermit&quot;Kim&quot;Roosevelt Jr. (February 16, 1916 – June 8, 2000) was an American intelligence officer who served in the Office of Strategic Services during and following World War II. A grandson of Theodore Roosevelt, the 26th President of the United States, Roosevelt went on to establish American Friends of the Middle East and then played a lead role in the CIA&#x27;s efforts to overthrow Mohammad Mosaddegh, the democratically elected Majlis-appointed prime minister of Iran, in August 1953.

== Early life ==
Kermit Roosevelt Jr. (called &quot;Kim,&quot; as was standard for alternating generations of Kermits in the Roosevelt family) was born to Kermit Roosevelt Sr., son of U.S. President Theodore Roosevelt, and Belle Wyatt Roosevelt (née Willard) in Buenos Aires in 1916. At the time, Kermit Roosevelt Sr. was an official for a shipping line and then a manager of the Buenos Aires branch of the National City Bank. The Roosevelt family returned to the US, and Kim, his two brothers, Joseph Willard and Dirck, and his sister, Belle Wyatt, grew up in Oyster Bay, New York, a homestead near Sagamore Hill, the Long Island home of the Roosevelt clan.

Kim attended Groton School as a young man. He graduated from Harvard University in 1937, a year ahead of his class. After graduating from Harvard, Roosevelt taught history at Caltech.

==Intelligence career==
===OSS===
With the outbreak of World War II, Roosevelt joined the Office of Strategic Services (OSS), the forerunner to the CIA. On June 4, 1943, when Kim was 27, his father, Kermit Sr., committed suicide at Fort Richardson in Alaska where he was posted. Roosevelt Jr. remained with the OSS after the war and wrote and edited its history.

===Postwar period===
Roosevelt went on to serve on the advisory board of a largely-Arab organization, the Institute of Arab American Affairs, a New York City-based organization, and Roosevelt wrote an essay in 1948 about his views on American Zionism and the partition of Palestine. In February 1948 Roosevelt joined more than 100 like-minded individuals to form a &quot;Christian group&quot; to aid the fight of the largely rabbinical American Council for Judaism to reverse the ongoing partition of Palestine into separate Jewish and Arab states. The Committee for Justice and Peace in the Holy Land (CJP) was founded on March 2, 1948, with Dean emeritus Gildersleeve serving as CJP chair, former Union Theological Seminary president Henry Sloane Coffin as vice-chair, and Roosevelt as executive director.

In 1951, Roosevelt, Virginia Gildersleeve; Dorothy Thompson; and a further group of 24 American educators, theologians, and writers (including Harry Emerson Fosdick) founded the American Friends of the Middle East (AFME), a pro-Arab organization often critical of US support for Israel. The CJP, which Roosevelt had helped form in 1948, was subsumed into the AFME in 1951, and Roosevelt served for a time as the AFME executive secretary for the group of intellectuals and spokespersons. The historians Robert Moats Miller, Hugh Wilford, and others have stated that from its early years, AFME was a part of an Arabist propaganda effort within the US that was &quot;secretly funded and to some extent managed&quot; by the CIA, with further funding from the oil consortium ARAMCO.
===Cold War and CIA===
Roosevelt was recruited to the CIA&#x27;s Office of Policy Coordination (OPC) in 1950 by its chief, Frank Wisner. Assigned to Egypt, Roosevelt impressed his colleagues with Project FF, which encouraged the Free Officers Movement to carry out a coup d&#x27;état in 1952, and Roosevelt developed close CIA links to the new leader, Gamal Abdel Nasser.

The historian Hugh Wilford attempts to describe Roosevelt&#x27;s motivations and views underpinning his intelligence efforts and states:

The views of the CIA Arabists were not in isolation since Wilford notes that the &quot;Eisenhower administration [including Secretary of State John Foster Dulles, was] initially quite sympathetic towards... Roosevelt&#x27;s Arabist agenda&quot; and willing to oppose Middle Eastern regimes seen &quot;as backing the Soviet Union rather than the U.S.&quot; Ultimately, the emergence of American public support for Israel and the administration&#x27;s evolving framework to respond to its principal Cold War adversary, the Soviet Union, would lead to failure of the Arabist agenda of Roosevelt and his colleagues. In discussing Roosevelt&#x27;s role, Wilford describes him as being among &quot;the most important intelligence officers of their generation in the Middle East.&quot;

Roosevelt played a highly-critical role in Operation Ajax as the ground operational planner, especially in getting the Shah to issue the &quot;firmans&quot;, or decrees, dismissing Mossadegh. He established networks of Anglophiles and sympathizers in Iran, who were willing to take part in various aspects of the coup. The tactics aided in dividing and dissolving Mossadegh&#x27;s political power base within the National Front, the Tudeh, and the clerics. However, the first attempt at the coup failed, likely because Mossadegh had learned of his impending overthrow. Although the CIA sent Roosevelt a telegram to flee Iran immediately, he began work on the second coup and circulated a false account that Mossadegh attempted to seize the throne and bribed Iranian agents. The coup was a success and hence was adapted for use in other Third World countries during the Cold War. Eisenhower secretly awarded Roosevelt the National Security Medal in 1954 for his work. In 2014, the National Security Archive released telegrams and accounts of the CIA operation, many of which are revealing as to the part he played in the operation.

Roosevelt, 26 years after the Mossadeq coup, wrote a book about how he and the CIA had carried out the operation, &quot;Countercoup&quot;. According to him, he had slipped across the border under his CIA cover as &quot;James Lochridge&quot; on July 19, 1953.

Roosevelt submitted his &quot;Countercoup&quot; manuscript to the CIA for pre-publication approval. The agency proposed various alterations, and in the perspective of a CIA reviewer, &quot;Roosevelt has reflected quite faithfully the changes that we suggested to him. This has become, therefore, essentially a work of fiction.&quot; The conclusion allowed the release of the book; a catalog of the actual changes made during the review is available.

A former senior adviser to the Obama administration and Council on Foreign Relations Iran expert, Ray Takeyh, wrote in 2014 that &quot;Contrary to Roosevelt&#x27;s account [in &quot;Countercoup&quot;], the documentary record reveals that the Eisenhower administration was hardly in control and was in fact surprised by the way events played out.&quot; William Blum wrote that Roosevelt had provided no evidence for his claim that a communist takeover in Iran was imminent but rather &quot;mere assertions of the thesis which are stated over and over.&quot; Abbas Milani wrote, &quot;Roosevelt&#x27;s memoir inflated his own and, in turn, America&#x27;s centrality to the coup. He tells the story with the relish of a John le Carré knock-off... Eisenhower, for one, considered reports like this to be the stuff of &#x27;dime novels.&#x27;&quot;

After Iran, Roosevelt became assistant deputy director of the Directorate of Plans.

Dulles asked Roosevelt to lead the CIA-sponsored 1954 coup in Guatemala, which deposed the government of Jacobo Árbenz. Roosevelt refused: &quot;AJAX had succeeded, he believed, chiefly because the CIA&#x27;s aims were shared by large numbers of Iranians, and it was obvious that the same condition did not obtain among Guatemalans.&quot; Noting that Árbenz&#x27;s resignation had been forced largely by rumors &quot;that a full-scale U.S. invasion was imminent,&quot; Roosevelt later remarked, &quot;We had our will in Guatemala, [but] it wasn&#x27;t really accomplished by clandestine means.&quot;

Roosevelt left the CIA in 1958 to work for American oil and defense firms. He often visited former operatives and the Shah in Iran.

==Personal life==
Roosevelt married Mary Lowe &quot;Polly&quot; Gaddis in 1937, and they had four children: Kermit III (father of Kermit IV, who also goes by Kermit III), Jonathan, Mark, and Anne.

==Death==
Roosevelt died in 2000 at a retirement community in Cockeysville, Maryland. He was survived by his wife, children, a brother, and seven grandchildren.

===Awards===
Roosevelt was the recipient of the National Security Medal which was awarded by Dwight D. Eisenhower to him in a secret ceremony on March 26, 1956 for his services in Egypt and Iran.

<doc id="748885" wikidata="Q2337721" url="?curid=748885" title="San Jacinto Mountains">
<text>The San Jacinto Mountains () are a mountain range in Riverside County, located east of Los Angeles in southern California in the United States. The mountains are named for one of the first Black Friars, Saint Hyacinth (), who is a popular patron in Latin America.

==Geography==
The range extends for approximately from the San Bernardino Mountains southeast to the Santa Rosa Mountains. The San Jacinto Mountains are the northernmost of the Peninsular Ranges, which run from Southern California to the southern tip of the Baja California Peninsula. The highest peak in the range is San Jacinto Peak (3,302 m; 10,834 ft), and the range is also a Great Basin Divide landform for the Salton Watershed to the east. The hills east of Live Oak Canyon Road, in San Bernardino County, are the northernmost extent of the range.
The Coachella Valley stretches along the eastern side of the range, including the cities of Palm Springs and Rancho Mirage. San Gorgonio Pass separates the range from Mount San Gorgonio to the north. The western slope holds the community of Idyllwild. The range is the eastern boundary of the San Jacinto Valley, location of Hemet; it also marks the eastern edge of the fast-growing Inland Empire region and Greater Los Angeles as a whole.

Much of the range is embraced by the Santa Rosa and San Jacinto Mountains National Monument created in 2000. Mount San Jacinto State Park is located along the flank of San Jacinto Peak. Part of the eastern flank of the range is located within the Agua Caliente Indian Reservation. In 1990, the California Legislature created the Coachella Valley Mountains Conservancy to protect the mountains surrounding the valley.

==Geology==
The range is a fault block of granitic rocks squeezed between the San Jacinto fault on the west and the San Andreas fault system on the east. The fault scarp on the northern and eastern side is one of the most abrupt in North America, going from sea level to 10,000 feet in a few miles. The height and steepness of the range points out that the San Jacinto fault and San Andreas fault are very active and very capable of producing major earthquakes (well in excess of magnitude 7). The last massive quake struck the southern segment of the San Andreas-San Jacinto fault complex more than 200 years ago making another major earthquake likely but not currently possible to predict. Rock slides from the range are possible during major earthquakes in the future, as they have been in the past. These slides may potentially impact the communities built directly adjacent to the steep escarpment on the desert side of the range.

==Climate==
The San Jacinto Mountains, like the neighboring San Bernardino Mountains, are a humid island above the surrounding desert and semi-desert. Annual precipitation ranges from about 15 inches at the western base (and only 6 inches on the eastern, desert base) to as much as 32 inches above 5,500 feet (the mountain town of Idyllwild averages 27 inches per year). The coastal (western) side of the range receives more precipitation than the eastern (desert) side. Most of the precipitation falls between November and March, with a secondary maximum associated with thunderstorms during the summer monsoon season between July and September. The precipitation totals are highly variable from year to year. Snow usually falls above 4,000 feet elevation in winter. Above 8,000 feet, snow sometimes persists until June. Near the crest, there are often a few patches of snow that may persist all year in shady spots.

==Flora and fauna==

The range can be thought of as a sky island, as it contains numerous species of flora and fauna that cannot tolerate the triple-digit-Fahrenheit heat of the surrounding valleys. Vegetation found on the mountain flanks is strongly influenced by elevation and climate. Near the valley floor, conditions are often arid and hot, limiting the vegetative palette to species that are adapted to such conditions. At lower elevations forestation of the San Jacinto Mountains includes considerable California black oak associated with Coulter pine. At higher elevations, forests include Ponderosa pine, Jeffrey pine, Lodgepole pine, Incense cedar, White fir, Red fir, Manzanita, and deciduous oak. There is also a grove of over 150 giant sequoia trees on the northeast facing slope. The sequoias (native to the Sierra Nevada Mountains) were planted by the U.S. Forest Service in the 1970s, and are now apparently healthy and producing seedlings. As in many other western U.S areas, bark beetle infestations have caused loss of some of the forest trees in recent years, especially during droughts. Wildfires, such as the Mountain Fire and the Cranston Fire, have also temporarily denuded some areas.

Like many other isolated high elevation mountains in California, the San Jacinto mountains are home to several endemic species, including the San Jacinto shieldback katydid and shaggy-haired alumroot.

==Human use==
The communities of Idyllwild-Pine Cove, Mountain Center, and Pinyon Pines are located in the San Jacinto Mountains.

The indigenous Cahuilla live in the deserts around the San Jacinto Mountains and used the range for hunting, foraging, and to escape the summer heat.

The range was a frequent subject for Palm Springs artists Carl Eytel (1862–1925) and Paul Grimm (1892–1974).

Hollywood film directors have used the mountains to shoot film scenes. In Frank Capra&#x27;s 1937 film, &quot;Lost Horizon&quot;, the Tahquitz Falls in Tahquitz Canyon was used as a scene.

Today, the range is a destination for outdoor recreation. The Pacific Crest Trail runs along the spine of the range. A popular walking route runs from the Palm Springs Aerial Tramway Mountain Station above Palm Springs, to the high point of the range, with a relatively mild climb of compared to other routes with more elevation gain.

Above Idyllwild is historic Tahquitz Peak and other rock climbing areas.

==Wilderness==
Established in 1964 by the U.S. Congress with the original Wilderness Act, the San Jacinto Wilderness protects two areas to the north and south of Mount San Jacinto State Park (the location of San Jacinto Peak). The 32,168 acre wilderness area is all within the San Bernardino National Forest and is managed by the U.S. Forest Service.

<text>Oak is used in winemaking to vary the color, flavor, tannin profile and texture of wine. It can be introduced in the form of a barrel during the fermentation or aging periods, or as free-floating chips or staves added to wine fermented in a vessel like stainless steel. Oak barrels can impart other qualities to wine through evaporation and low level exposure to oxygen.

==History==

In early wine history, the amphora was the vessel of choice for the storage and transportation of wine. Due to the perishable nature of wood material it is difficult to trace the usage of barrels in history. The Greek historian Herodotus noted that ancient Mesopotamians used barrels made of palm wood to transport wine along the Euphrates. Palm is a difficult material to bend and fashion into barrels, however, and wine merchants in different regions experimented with different wood styles to find a better wood source. The use of oak has been prevalent in winemaking for at least two millennia, first coming into widespread use during the time of the Roman Empire. In time, winemakers discovered that beyond just storage convenience, wine kept in oak barrels took on properties that improved it by making it softer and, in some cases, better-tasting.

==Effects on wine==
The porous nature of an oak barrel allows evaporation and oxygenation to occur in wine but typically not at levels that would cause oxidation or spoilage. The typical 59-gallon (225-liter) barrel can lose anywhere from 5 to 6 gallons (21 to 25 liters) (of mostly alcohol and water) in a year through evaporation. This allows the wine to concentrate its flavor and aroma compounds. Small amounts of oxygen are allowed to pass through the barrel and act as a softening agent upon the wine&#x27;s tannins.

The chemical properties of oak can have a profound effect on wine. Phenols within the wood interact to produce vanilla type flavors and can give the impression of tea notes or sweetness. The degree of &quot;toast&quot; on the barrel can also impart different properties affecting the tannin levels as well as the aggressive wood flavors. The hydrolyzable tannins present in wood, known as ellagitannins, are derived from lignin structures in the wood. They help protect the wine from oxidation and reduction.
Characteristics of white wines fermented in oak include a pale color and extra silky texture. White wines fermented in steel and matured in oak will have a darker coloring due to heavy phenolic compounds still present. Flavor notes commonly used to describe wines exposed to oak include caramel, cream, smoke, spice and vanilla. Chardonnay is a varietal with very distinct flavor profiles when fermented in oak, which include coconut, cinnamon and cloves notes. The &quot;toastiness&quot; of the barrel can bring out varying degrees of mocha and toffee notes in red wine. It is a common misconception that oak imparts butter flavors to wine. The butter flavors come from lactic acid, naturally present in the wine, converted during malolactic fermentation to diacetyl. This process reverses itself, although the addition of sulfur dioxide prevents this, and the diacetyl remains. 

Wines can be barrel fermented in oak or placed in oak after fermentation for a period of aging or maturation. Wine matured in oak receives more oak flavors and properties than wine fermented in oak because yeast cells present in fermentation interact with and &quot;latch on&quot; to oak components. When dead yeast cells are removed as lees some oak properties go with them.

The length of time a wine spends in the barrel is dependent on the varietal and finished style the winemaker desires. The majority of oak flavoring is imparted in the first few months the wine is in contact with oak, while longer term exposure adds light barrel aeration, which helps precipitate phenolic compounds and quickens the aging process. New World Pinot noir may spend less than a year in oak. Premium Cabernet Sauvignon may spend two years. The very tannic Nebbiolo grape may spend four or more years in oak. High end Rioja producers will sometimes age their wines up to ten years in American oak to get a desired earthy cedar and herbal character.

==Oak types and sources==

The species of oak typically used for American oak production is the &quot;Quercus alba&quot; which is a white oak species that is characterized by its relatively fast growth, wider grains and lower wood tannins. It is found in most of the Eastern United States as well as Missouri, Minnesota and Wisconsin where many wine barrels are from. In Oregon the &quot;Quercus garryana&quot; white oak has started to gain usage due to its closer similarities to European oak.

In France, both the &quot;Quercus robur&quot; (English oak) and &quot;Quercus petraea&quot; (sessile oak) are considered apt for wine making; however, the latter is considered far superior for its finer grain and richer contribution of aromatic components like vanillin and its derivates, methyl-octalactone and tannins, as well as phenols and volatile aldehydes.
French oak typically comes from one or more primary forests: Allier, Limousin, Nevers, Tronçais and Vosges. The wood from each of these forests has slightly different characteristics. Many winemakers utilize barrels made from different cooperages, regions and degrees of toasting in blending their wines to enhance the complexity of the resulting wine.

Italian winemakers have had a long history of using Slavonian oak from the &quot;Quercus robur&quot; which is known for its tight grain, low aromatics and medium level tannins. Slavonian oak tends to be used in larger barrel sizes (with less surface area relative to volume) with the same barrels reused for many more years before replacement. Prior to the Russian Revolution, &quot;Quercus petraea&quot; oak from Hungary was the most highly sought after wood for French winemaking. The trees in the Hungarian Zemplén Mountains grow more slowly and smaller in the volcanic soil, creating fine tight grain which sequentially lends itself to a very delicate extraction.

The hemicellulose in the Hungarian oak breaks down more easily, and conveys an exceptional selection of toasted, vanilla, sugary, woody, spicy and caramel-like flavors – imparting these aromas with less intensity, and more slowly than American or French oak.

Many winemakers favor the softer, smoother, creamier texture that Hungarian oak offers their wines. French winemakers preferred to use Hungarian barrels until the early 20th century, then – because of world wars, supply cut – the French wine industry was forced to find its own source in France, similar to the unique quality, legendary Hungarian Zemplén oak.

However, after the fall of the Iron Curtain, the cooperages from France again became major consumers of the exclusive &quot;Quercus petraea&quot;/Sessile Hungarian Oak trees originating in the Zemplén Mountain Forest.

The Russian oak from the Adygey region along the Black Sea is being explored by French winemakers as a cheaper alternative to French and Hungarian oak. Canadian wineries have been experimenting with the use of Canadian oak, which proponents describe as a middle ground between American and French oak even though it is the same species as American oak.

Oak trees are typically between 80–120 years old prior to harvesting with the ideal conditions being a cool climate in a dense forest region that gives the trees opportunity to mature slowly and develop a tighter grain. Typically one tree can provide enough wood for two barrels. The trees are typically harvested in the winter months when there is less sap in the trunk.

===Differences between French and American oak===

American oak tends to be more intensely flavored than French oak with more sweet and vanilla overtones due to the American oak having two to four times as many lactones. Winemakers choose American oak typically for bold, powerful reds, base wines for &quot;assemblage&quot;, or for warm climate Chardonnays. Besides being derived from different species, a major difference between American and French oak comes from the preparation of the wood. The tighter grain and less watertight nature of French oak obliges coopers to split the wood along the grain. The wood is then aged or &quot;seasoned&quot; for 24 to 36 months in the open air, in a so-called wood-yard.
Even though American coopers may use a kiln-dry method to season the wood, almost all others will season American oak in exactly the same way as French. Open air seasoning has the advantage of leaching undesirable chemical components and bitter tannins, mellowing the oak in a manner that kiln-dry methods are incapable of replicating. 
Even though sun, rain, and wind may suffice in most cases to season oak, in drier climates coopers - such as Tonelería Nacional - apply up to 2000 mm (80 in) of water a year to their wood stacks in order to facilitate the seasoning process.

Since French oak must be split, only 20 to 25% of the tree can be utilized; American oak may be sawn, which makes it at least twice as economical. Its more pronounced oxidation and a quicker release of aromas help wines to lose their astringency and harshness more quickly, which makes this the wood of choice for shorter maturations - six to ten months. Because of American oak’s modest tannin contribution, the perfect first fill is a wine with abundant tannins and good texture; it allows the fruit to interact harmoniously with the wood, which contributes a wide array of complex aromas and soft, yet very palatable tannins.

French oak, on the other hand, generates silky and transparent tannins, which transmit a sensation of light sweetness combined with fruity flavors that persist in the mouth. Spices and toasted almond are noteworthy, combined with flavors of ripe red fruit in red wines, and notes of peach, exotic fruits and floral aromas like jasmine and rose in whites, depending on the grape variety employed.

==Wine barrel==
 
Wine barrels, especially those made of oak, have long been used as containers in which wine is aged. Aging in oak typically imparts desirable vanilla and spice flavors to wine. The size of the barrel plays a large role in determining the effects of oak on the wine by dictating the ratio of surface area to volume of wine with smaller containers having a larger impact. The most common barrels are the Bordeaux style barrel, which holds , followed by the Burgundy style barrel, which holds . Some New World winemakers are now also using the larger hogshead barrel. Larger barrels are also traditionally used in parts of Italy such as Barolo, as well as the south of France.

New barrels impart more flavors than do previously used barrels. Over time many of the oak properties get &quot;leached&quot; out of the barrel with layers of natural deposits left from the wine building up on the wood to where after 3 to 5 vintages there may be little or no oak flavors imparted on the wine. In addition, oxygen transport through the oak and into the wine, which is required for maturation, becomes severely limited after 3–5 years. The cost of barrels varies due to the supply and demand market economy and can change with different features that a cooperage may offer. As of late 2007 the price for a standard American oak barrel was US$600 to 800, French oak US$1200 and up, and Eastern European US$600. Due to the expense of barrels, several techniques have been devised in an attempt to save money. One is to shave the inside of used barrels and insert new thin inner staves that have been toasted.

===Barrel construction===

Barrels are constructed in cooperages. The traditional method of European coopers has been to hand-split the oak into staves (or strips) along the grain. After the oak is split, it is allowed to &quot;season&quot; or dry outdoors while exposed to the elements. This process can take anywhere from 10 to 36 months during which time the harshest tannins from the wood are leached out. These tannins are visible as dark gray and black residue left on the ground once the staves are removed. The longer the wood is allowed to season the softer the potential wine stored in the barrels may be but this can add substantially to the cost of the barrel. In some American cooperage the wood is dried in a kiln instead of outdoor seasoning. While this method is much faster, it does not soften the tannins quite as much as outdoor seasoning.

The staves are then heated, traditionally over an open fire, and, when pliable, are bent into the desired shape of the barrel and held together with iron rings. Instead of fire, a cooper may use steam to heat up the staves but this tends to impart less &quot;toastiness&quot; and complexity to the resulting wine. Following the traditional, hand worked style, a cooper is typically able to construct one barrel in a day&#x27;s time. Winemakers can order barrels with the wood on the inside of the barrel having been lightly charred or toasted with fire, medium toasted, or heavily toasted. Typically the &quot;lighter&quot; the toasting the more oak flavor and tannins that are imparted. Heavy toast or &quot;charred&quot; which is typical treatment of barrels in Burgundy wine have an added dimension from the char that medium or light toasted barrels do not impart. Heavy toasting dramatically reduces the coconut note lactones, even in American oak, but create a high carbon content that may reduce the coloring of some wines. During the process of toasting, the furanic aldehydes in the wood reach a higher level of concentration. This produces the &quot;roasted&quot; aroma in the wine. The toasting also enhances the presences of vanillin and the phenol eugenol which creates smokey and spicy notes that in some wines are similar to the aromatics of oil of cloves.

==Barrel alternatives==
Although oak barrels have long been used by winemakers, many wineries now use oak wood chips for aging wine more quickly and also adding desired woody aromas along with vanilla flavors. Oak chips can be added during fermentation or during aging. In the latter case, they are generally placed into fabric sacks and placed into the aging wine. The diversity of chips available gives winemakers numerous options. Oak chips have the benefit of imparting intense oak flavoring in a matter of weeks while traditional oak barrels would need a year or more to convey similar intensity. Critics claim that the oak flavoring from chips tend to be one-dimensional and skewed towards the vanilla extract with the wines still lacking some of the physical benefits that barrel oak imparts. The use of oak powder is also less common than chips, although they are a very practical alternative if oak character is to be introduced during fermentation. Oak planks or staves are sometimes used, either during fermentation or aging. Wines made from these barrel alternatives typically do not age as well as wines that are matured in barrels. Improvements in micro-oxygenation have allowed winemakers to better mimic the gentle aeration of oak barrels in stainless steel tanks with oak chips.

Prior to 2006, the practice of using oak chips was outlawed in the European Union. In 1999, the Bordeaux court of appeals fined four wineries, including third growth Chateau Giscours, over $13,000 USD for the use of oak chips in their wine.

==Other wood types==

Throughout history other wood types, including chestnut, pine, redwood, and black locust, have been used in crafting winemaking vessels, particularly large fermentation vats. However, none of these wood types possess the compatibility with wine that oak has demonstrated in combining its water tight, yet slightly porous, storage capabilities with the unique flavor and texture characteristic that it can impart to the wine that it is in contact with. Chestnut is very high in tannins and is too porous as a storage barrel and must be coated with paraffin to prevent excessive wine loss through evaporation. Redwood is too rigid to bend into the smaller barrel shapes and imparts an unpleasant flavor. Black Locust imparts a yellow tint to the wine. Other hardwoods like apple and cherry wood have an off putting smell. Austrian winemakers have a history of using black locust barrels. Historically, chestnut was used by Beaujolais, Italian and Portuguese wine makers. Some Rhône winemakers still use paraffin coated chestnut barrels but the coating minimizes any effect from the wood making its function similar to a neutral concrete vessel. In Chile there are traditions for using barrels made of rauli wood but it is beginning to fall out of favor due to the musky scent it imparts on wine.

<text>is a 1991 Japanese drama film written, edited and directed by Takeshi Kitano starring Claude Maki.

==Plot==
A deaf garbage collector happens upon a broken and discarded surfboard. The discovery plants in him dreams of becoming a surf champion. Encouraged by his also deaf girlfriend, he persists against all odds.

==Production==
This movie was a break from previous Kitano fare in that it features no gangsters or police. However, Kitano did return to darker themes in his next film, &quot;Sonatine&quot;, as well as many later works. In the film, Kitano develops his more delicate, romantic side along with his trademark deadpan approach. In 2002, the Japanese filmmaker directed a similar movie, &quot;Dolls&quot;, a romantic tale about three pairs of lovers.

This film marks the first collaboration between Kitano and composer Joe Hisaishi, who had previously created the acclaimed soundtracks of many of Hayao Miyazaki&#x27;s anime films, including &quot;Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind&quot;. Hisaishi would go on to compose the soundtracks for all of Kitano&#x27;s films until &quot;Dolls&quot;, after which their collaboration ended.

Occasional Office Kitano actor, Claude Maki, who plays the mute main character, went on to appear in Kitano&#x27;s film &quot;Brother&quot; as Ken, a Japanese-American punk set to become leader of a yakuza clan. In &quot;Brother&quot;, Claude speaks mostly in American-English with some occasional Japanese.

== Soundtrack ==

The soundtrack CD was originally released on November 25, 1992, by Toshiba EMI; then, re-released many times by Milan Records and Wonderland Records.

<text>is a 1993 Japanese yakuza film directed, written and edited by Takeshi Kitano, who also stars in the film. It won numerous awards and became one of Kitano&#x27;s most successful and praised films, garnering him a sizable international fan base.

==Plot==
Murakawa, a Tokyo-based &quot;yakuza&quot; enforcer, has grown tired of gangster life. He is sent by his boss to Okinawa, supposedly to mediate a dispute between their allies, the Nakamatsu and Anan clans. Murakawa openly suspects the assignment is an attempt to have him removed and even beats up one of his colleagues, Takahashi, but ends up going with his men. He finds that the dispute is insignificant; the group&#x27;s temporary headquarters is bombed and his men are ambushed in a bar, leaving several of them dead.

Fleeing to the seaside, the survivors take refuge in a remote beach house belonging to the brother of one of the Nakamatsu members and decide to wait for the trouble to blow over. Whilst spending time at the beach, the group engages in childish games and pranks and begins to enjoy themselves. However, the games frequently have a violent undertone. When two of his men alternate shooting at a beer can on each other&#x27;s head, Murakawa turns it into a game of Russian roulette. Putting the gun to his head, he pulls the trigger on the last chamber, which is only then revealed to be empty.

Murakawa later dreams of the Russian roulette game, although in his dream, the revolver is loaded and he dies. When he wakes up, he walks down to the shore and witnesses a man attempting to rape a woman. Murakawa shoots the man, but to his companions he claims the woman shot him. She then joins Murakawa and the gang at the beach house and frequently visits, spending time with Murakawa. Later, an assassin, disguised as a fisherman, kills the boss of the Nakamatsu clan and one of Murakawa&#x27;s men. Learning that Takahashi is arriving in Okinawa, Murakawa and two of his surviving men visit his hotel.

Unable to find him at first, they unexpectedly run into Takahashi and the assassin in the elevator, which results in a shootout, killing the assassin and Murakawa&#x27;s men. Murakawa learns from interrogating Takahashi that their boss had intended all along to partner with the Anan clan and had sent Murakawa on a suicide mission to take over his turf. He also learns that the boss will be meeting with the Anan that night in another hotel. Takahashi is killed and Murakawa sets off with the only survivor of the group, a member of the Nakamatsu clan, who helps him by rigging the electricity in the hotel to go off at a certain time. Murakawa tells the woman that he might come back.

Later that night, Murakawa goes into the hotel and slaughters both clans with an assault rifle. The next morning, while the woman continues to wait for him, Murakawa is dropped off nearby. He gets into the woman&#x27;s car alone and commits suicide by shooting himself in the head.

==Production==
The film was conceived with four basic scenes; yakuza having to go to Okinawa, yakuza arriving in Okinawa, the machine-gun shootout, and the main character shooting himself in the head. Kitano said his shooting technique is spontaneous in that he allowed the film to fill in the space between these four scenes itself.

The title &quot;Sonatine&quot; comes from the musical term sonatina. Kitano said that when learning the piano, when the learner gets to sonatinas they have to decide where they want to go, whether it is to classical, jazz or popular music; marking the point of crucial decision making. This refers to the character Murakawa in the film. The film&#x27;s original title, &quot;Okinawa Pierrot&quot;, was a possible reference to Jean-Luc Godard&#x27;s &quot;Pierrot le fou&quot;.

The film&#x27;s poster is of a Napoleon fish being pierced with a spear. Kitano said this type of fish used to be very common in the oceans south of Japan, but has been decreasing. He used the image simply because the contrast of the &quot;beautifully shaped&quot; fish being speared seemed striking to him.

==Soundtrack==

The soundtrack to &quot;Sonatine&quot; was composed by Joe Hisaishi. It won the Japanese Academy Award for Music in 1994. The CD soundtrack was released in 1993 by Toshiba EMI, and later in France by Milan Records.

==Reception==
Review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes reports that 92% of 25 professional critics have given the film a positive review, with a rating average of 7.4 out of 10. Metacritic assigned the film a weighted average score of 73 out of 100, based on 22 critics, indicating &quot;generaly favourable reviews&quot;.

Roger Ebert, who gave the film three and a half out of four stars, said it shows that gangster films do not need to have &quot;stupid dialogue, nonstop action and gratuitous gore&quot; and that it reminded him of &quot;Le Samouraï&quot;. &quot;The Guardian&quot;″s Rob Mackie called it &quot;a largely peaceful, contemplative work, punctuated by moments of extreme violence&quot; and gave it four out of five stars. Scott Tobias of &quot;The A.V. Club&quot; summed the movie up as &quot;a fresh take on the age-old yakuza genre that&#x27;s infused by odd flourishes of style and playfulness, and jarring outbursts of humor and violence.&quot; &quot;Complex&quot; named &quot;Sonatine&quot; second on their list of The 25 Best Yakuza Movies, behind only &quot;Battles Without Honor and Humanity&quot;. Jasper Sharp, writing for the British Film Institute, listed it as one of the ten great Japanese gangster movies.
&quot;Sonatine&quot; was screened in the Un Certain Regard section at the 1993 Cannes Film Festival. French publisher and notorious movie-goer, Jean-Pierre Dionnet (Canal +/Studio Canal), reported in an interview, that someone convinced Alain Delon to watch &quot;Sonatine&quot; arguing that Kitano was a fan of &quot;Le Samouraï&quot;. Delon was taken aback, and talking about Kitano&#x27;s acting, said: &quot;What&#x27;s THAT? [...], this is not an actor [...], he only has three facial expressions and he almost doesn&#x27;t talk on top of this.&quot; Most professionals around Dionnet had the same reaction, but the French publisher was both struck and puzzled by this new genre. He contacted the Japanese distributor in order to buy the license for &quot;Sonatine&quot;, but his request was rejected. Dionnet had to insist for several months to finally discover that Shochiku didn&#x27;t want to release &quot;Sonatine&quot; abroad, claiming the film was &quot;too Japanese&quot; and would not be accepted, nor understood, by western audiences. Eventually Dionnet learned that the distributor didn&#x27;t want to release the license because of its commercial failure in Japan. Dionnet had an agreement with Shochiku arguing that French audiences did not know Kitano&#x27;s career and would accept his violent character more easily. He bought &quot;Sonatine&quot; and three additional Kitano films, &quot;Violent Cop&quot;, &quot;Boiling Point&quot; and the latest, &quot;Kids Return&quot;. With the exception of &quot;Kids Return&quot;, all had performed poorly in Japan. In 1995, &quot;Sonatine&quot; entered the 13th Festival du Film Policier de Cognac in France, where it was critically acclaimed. &quot;Sonatine&quot;, followed by the three other films were broadcast on the French channel Canal+ a few months later. They were show again a couple of years later on the Franco-German public channel Arte. A video release followed, including a DVD edition available in Dionnet&#x27;s collection &quot;Asian Classics&quot;.

As soon as 1995, Takeshi Kitano played the role of a yakuza in American director Robert Longo&#x27;s SF thriller, &quot;Johnny Mnemonic&quot;. In North America, &quot;Sonatine&quot; was released in theaters in April 1998 and Quentin Tarantino released a subtitled video edition in 2000 as part of his Rolling Thunder Pictures collection. The same year, Kitano was convinced by his producer to go to the United States, where he filmed his first (and last) film outside Japan. &quot;Brother&quot; was shot in Los Angeles with an American crew and local actors, including Omar Epps. In an interview, Kitano admitted he was not fully satisfied with the final result of &quot;Brother&quot; and that he regretted his &quot;Hollywood&quot; adventure which was supposed to bring him a broader audience with a higher exposure. Kitano confessed he had no intention of shooting outside Japan any more.

==Awards==
&quot;Sonatine&quot; won the Cariddi D&#x27;oro award for Best Film at the 1993 Taormina Film Fest. Aya Kokumai received the Best New Encouragement award at the 3rd Japan Film Professional Awards for her performance. The film&#x27;s soundtrack won the Japanese Academy Award for Music in 1994. In 1995, it was awarded Critic&#x27;s Choice at the Festival du Film Policier de Cognac.

<doc id="748898" wikidata="Q3269995" url="?curid=748898" title="Coca-Cola C2">
<text>Coca-Cola C2 (also referred to as Coke C2, C2 Cola, or simply C2) was a cola-flavored beverage produced in response to the low-carbohydrate diet trend. This Coke product was marketed as having half the carbohydrates, sugars and calories compared to standard Coca-Cola. It contained aspartame, acesulfame potassium, and sucralose in addition to the high fructose corn syrup (and Sugar in Japan) typically found in cola beverages distributed in America.

==History==
Codenamed as &quot;Coca-Cola Ultra&quot;, The Coca-Cola Company unrevealed C2 in April 2004, announcing that the drink would be released in Japan prior to its release in United States.

The drink launched in Japan on June 7, 2004, with an advertising campaign featuring Japanese footballer Hidetoshi Nakata. The drink&#x27;s launch in the United States at the end of the month was promoted on radio and television, and movie theaters initially using The Rolling Stones&#x27; &quot;You Can&#x27;t Always Get What You Want&quot; and later Queen&#x27;s &quot;I Want to Break Free&quot;. Eight different NASCAR Cup Series drivers ran paint schemes in the 2004 Pepsi 400 race to promote the new drink. The drink was released in Canada shortly afterwards. A planned launch for C2 in the United Kingdom was aborted in December 2004 after research had showed fears that the drink would overtake Diet Coke in sales.

American sales did not live up to early expectations mainly due to customer disinterest in a mid-calorie soda; however, Coca-Cola said the brand would remain in its lineup, even while Pepsi discontinued its equivalent product, Pepsi Edge, in late 2005, just one year after its introduction.

By 2005, many store shelves completely replaced the product with Coca-Cola Zero due to display, shelving and storage limitations. The drink was silently discontinued in Japan in 2006 for similar reasons as in the United States, and by 2007 the drink had disappeared from all store shelves where it had previously remained in favor of Coca-Cola Cherry Zero.

In 2013, The Coca-Cola Company introduced a similar product - Coca-Cola Life, another mid-calorie variant of Coca-Cola which used Stevia leaf extract in addition to sugar or corn syrup. Coca-Cola Life, while having had a larger availability rate than C2, shared similar low sales and was entirely discontinued by 2020.

<doc id="748902" wikidata="Q742882" url="?curid=748902" title="Getting Any?">
<text>is a 1995 Japanese film, written, directed, edited, and starring Takeshi Kitano. &quot;Yatteru&quot; (やってる) is the colloquial form for &quot;yatteiru&quot; (やっている), &quot;yatteru&quot; coming from the Japanese verb &quot;yaru&quot;, which is an informal word meaning &#x27;to do&#x27;, and has become slang for sexual intercourse. The film is a sex comedy. It showed Beat Takeshi, originally a very popular manzai performer, returning to his comedic roots. The movie features an &quot;Airplane!&quot;-like assemblage of comedic scenes centering on a Walter Mitty-type character whose obsession is to have sex.

The film met with little acclaim in Japan where its release was barely noticed. Kitano said in 2003 (while in production for &quot;Zatoichi&quot;), that &quot;Getting Any?&quot; was one of his three favourite movies among the ten he had directed by that time. According to him, this work was the basis for many of the movies that followed, including the acclaimed &quot;Hana-bi&quot;, as it features all his recurrent themes plus its shares of violence and sorrow.

According to Kitano, his purpose in this movie was to laugh at his own gags, to make a mockery of them. He also wanted to laugh at the young Japanese men, those born after World War II, who were simple-minded and much too direct and simplistic when it came to talking with girls about having sex. Kitano denied satirizing Japanese society, and claimed that his aim in this movie was to make the audience laugh.

==Plot==
Asao, a naive and goofy man, lives with his grandfather in Saitama Prefecture. Even though Asao is 35 years old, he is very inexperienced with girls, but he absolutely wants to have sex. One day as he watches an erotic TV film, he realizes that all he needs to get girls and sex is a fancy car, so he runs to the closest car dealer.

In the TV film, the male character had a Porsche 911 Cabriolet, so Asao aims for a luxury import car dealer. The car dealer asks what kind of car he is looking for, and Asao naively answers that he wants &quot;a car for having sex&quot;. After trying a cabriolet, with the assistance of a very helpful and somewhat helpless hostess, Asao confesses he is short of money. All he can afford is a used domestic budget-car, so he is forced to buy a Honda Today, a modest kei car which is very cheap compared to the Mercedes-Benz, Rolls-Royce, Aston Martin and Ferrari cars displayed in the show room.

Then, he quickly restages the scene he has seen in the TV film, with the help of a female mannequin, before aiming for girls passing by on the street. Quickly, Asao realizes that male-female social relations are not as simple as in porn, and that real life girls are not as naive as in fictional works.

After several humiliating and unsuccessful tries, Asao comes to the conclusion that roadsters are more efficient. Such cars are expensive but Asao lacks money, so he asks his grandfather to help him. After selling his grandfather&#x27;s liver and kidneys, he returns to the car dealer. The man convinces him to buy an Austin Healey Sprite MkI, a classic British roadster, but once he learns how much money Asao really has, he changes his mind and sells him a Mazda Eunos Roadster (Mazda Miata), a popular Japanese roadster, claiming it is the same car. When Asao protests, the dealer claims the &#x27;50s Austin-Healey was old-fashioned and the Eunos is a better model for cruising. The Eunos is driven a few meters and starts falling apart. Asao complains to the dealer, but the latter refuses to talk with him any more, so Asao picks up the fallen pieces and attaches them to the back of his car.

The young man tries his luck anyway with girls on the street, but does not succeed, so he finally sells his wrecked car to a local salvage company.

As he walks home, he finds an apparently abandoned, parked, Mazda RX-7 Series 5 Turbo (FC), and he decides to steal it. Asao drives a few miles when he encounters a young woman walking along the road and decides to talk to her, as shown in the erotic film, but the sports car&#x27;s brakes no longer work and he runs over the girl, and crashes the car into a billboard. He is lucky enough to not get hurt and he ditches the coupé.

Asao imagines airline stewardesses offer naked &quot;on-board sex service&quot; to first class 747 customers, so he decides to travel by plane. Since he does not have any money, he will do an armed bank robbery, but first he needs a weapon, so he heads to Kawaguchi City (near Tokyo) where he will be able to make his own revolver in the local iron foundry.

Eventually, he has many adventures such as joining the yakuza, becoming Zatoichi, becoming invisible, and getting transformed into a giant fly-man similar to the film &quot;The Fly&quot;. The movie ends with his capture after diving into a large reservoir of feces. After the credits, there is a scene where Asao jumps around Tokyo as the fly-man before getting impaled on Tokyo Tower.

== Cast ==
*Dankan (Minoru Iizuka) - Asao
*Hideo Higashikokubaru - Yaku 
*Takeshi Kitano - Scientist
*Akiji Kobayashi - Chief of World Defence Force
*Masumi Okada - Russian actor
*Susumu Terajima - Injured Yakuza
*Ren Osugi - Head Yakuza 3

==References and parodies==
Much of the film appears to satirize popular Japanese culture from the 1950s up to the &#x27;80s, including cinema, TV series, anime, and pop music; although, Kitano himself denied it.

References to the gangster films of Joe Shishido abound, as well as to the videos of Michael Jackson. The inspiration for the fly-man and the &quot;toumei ningen&quot; (transparent man) may have been a 1957 horror movie directed by Mitsuo Murayama, called &quot;Transparent Man &amp; Fly-Man&quot; (透明人間と蝿男). The manner in which the &quot;fly man&quot; is formed is directly taken from David Cronenberg&#x27;s 1986 remake of &quot;The Fly&quot;, so the gag is also at least partially based on the Hollywood film. Hunting suits worn by the Doctor and his assistant are a reference to Ivan Reitman&#x27;s 1984 SF-comedy &quot;Ghostbusters&quot;. The alternative ending, which comes after the end credits, features the familiar reference to Steven Spielberg &quot;E.T.&quot;, the character flying by the moon.

&quot;Getting Any?&quot; also features some guest stars including Masumi Okada (playing Joseph Stalin) and Akiji Kobayashi (as leader of the Terrestrian Forces from &quot;Ultraman&quot;).

==Scatological humour==
Questioned about the scatological gags used in his movie, Takeshi Kitano answered that excrements and manure were a common source of humor in Japan, since the country was traditionally an agricultural workers&#x27; land.

A French interviewer even asked the film maker if the giant turd, seen near the end of the movie, was a metaphor for the decadence of the Japanese society, but Kitano laughed and answered that it was not and only meant as a &quot;local color&quot; joke.

<doc id="748923" wikidata="Q670964" url="?curid=748923" title="Kids Return">
<text>is a 1996 Japanese film written, edited and directed by Takeshi Kitano. The film was made directly after Kitano recovered from a motorcycle wreck that left one side of his body paralyzed. After undergoing extensive surgery and physical therapy, he quickly went about making &quot;Kids Return&quot; amidst speculation that he might never be able to work again. The movie is about two high school dropouts, Masaru (Ken Kaneko) and Shinji (Masanobu Andō), who try to find a direction and meaning in their lives—one by becoming a yakuza lieutenant, the other by becoming a boxer.

The music was composed by Joe Hisaishi, and the cinematographer was Katsumi Yanagishima.

==Plot==
Shinji and Masaru are high school delinquents, terrifying their classmates, stealing money, and even setting their teacher&#x27;s car on fire. After some of their victims hire a boxer to beat up Masaru, he decides to get revenge, and takes his shy friend Shinji along with him to a boxing gym. To their trainers&#x27; surprise, Shinji is naturally-talented at boxing and easily defeats Masaru in a sparring session. Masaru encourages his friend to keep going at it, and quits boxing, opting instead to join the yakuza. As Shinji focuses on becoming a successful boxer, Masaru aims to become a gang leader, and their paths diverge.

While the two of them climb to the top in their respective areas, Shinji adopts an unhealthy lifestyle that results in the end of his boxing career. Likewise, Masaru&#x27;s arrogance and disrespect for his boss gets him kicked out of the yakuza. In the end, they are both left with nothing, and meet again. As they ride their bike together in the schoolyard, Shinji wonders if this is the end of their lives, but Masaru assures him that &quot;it&#x27;s only the beginning&quot;.

==Reception==
===Critical reception===
At the time of its release, &quot;Kids Return&quot; was Takeshi Kitano&#x27;s most successful film yet in his native Japan, which until then had been notedly less enthusiastic about his films than international viewers. Rotten Tomatoes gives this film a 100% approval rating based on reviews from five critics, with an average score of 7.8 out of 10. David Wood, writing for the BBC, described it as &quot;a tender, funny and melancholy affair which will come as a delight to ardent admirers after the recent &quot;Kikujiro.&quot;&quot; He gave the film 4 out of 5 stars.

===Accolades===
At the 1997 Japanese Academy Awards, &quot;Kids Return&quot; was nominated for three awards and won two of them.
==Sequel==
In 2013 a sequel to the film titled &quot;Kids Return: The Reunion&quot; was released, directed by the assistant director of the original, Hiroshi Shimizu. It is set ten years after the original and follows an older Shinji (Yuta Hiraoka) and Masaru (Takahiro Miura). The two of them meet after their failures in boxing and crime, respectively, and they work together to improve their situation. The new film was created with minimal input from Kitano.

<doc id="748925" wikidata="Q387379" url="?curid=748925" title="African darter">
<text>The African darter(Anhinga rufa), sometimes called the snakebird, is a water bird of sub-Saharan Africa and Iraq.

==Taxonomy==

The African darter is a member of the darter family, Anhingidae, and is closely related to American (&quot;Anhinga anhinga&quot;), Oriental (&quot;Anhinga melanogaster&quot;), and Australasian (&quot;Anhinga novaehollandiae&quot;) darters.

==Description==

The African darter is long. Like other anhingas, it has a very long neck. The male is mainly glossy black with white streaking; females and immature birds are browner. The African darter differs in appearance from the American darter most recognisably by its thin white lateral neck stripe against a rufous background colour. The pointed bill prevents confusion with cormorants.

==Distribution==

The African darter is found throughout sub-Saharan Africa wherever large bodies of water occur; overall the species remains widespread and common.

The only non-African subspecies, the Levant darter (&quot;Anhinga rufa chantrei&quot;), occurred at Lake Amik (Amik Gölü) in south-central Turkey, in the Hula Valley lake and marshes in northern Israel and in the Mesopotamian Marshes of the lower Euphrates and Tigris rivers in southern Iraq. The Turkish population disappeared during the 1930s and the Israeli population during the drainage of the Hula in the 1950s. In Khuzestan, 110 birds were counted in 1990, but the subspecies was feared extinct as a result of oil spills during the Gulf War and the drainage of the Mesopotamian Marshes that followed it. However, a small population was documented in the Hawizeh Marshes in 2007. The drainage of the marshes was interrupted and reversed after the Iraq War.

==Behavior==
This species builds a stick nest in a tree and lays 3–6 eggs. It often nests with herons, egrets and cormorants.

It often swims with only the neck above water, hence the common name &quot;snakebird&quot;. This, too, is a habit shared with the other anhingas. It feeds on fish, which it catches by diving.

Unlike many other waterbirds the feathers of the African darter do not contain any oil and are therefore not waterproof. Because of this, the bird is less positively buoyant and its diving capabilities are enhanced. After diving for fish, the feathers can become waterlogged. In order to be able to fly and maintain heat insulation, it needs to dry its feathers. Thus the African darter is often seen sitting along the waterside spreading its wings and drying its feathers in the wind and the sun along with cormorants, which may share its habitat.

<doc id="748930" wikidata="Q275136" url="?curid=748930" title="Propylaea">
<text>In ancient Greek architecture, a propylaion, propylaeon or, in its Latinized form, propylaeum—often used in the plural forms propylaia or propylaea (; Greek: προπύλαια)—is a monumental gateway. It serves as a partition, separating the secular and religious parts of a city. The prototypical Greek example is the propylaea that served as the entrance to the Acropolis of Athens. The Greek Revival Brandenburg Gate of Berlin and the Propylaea in Munich both evoke the central portion of the Athens Propylaea.

==Etymology==
The Greek word προπύλαιον, &quot;propylaeon&quot; (&quot;propylaeum&quot; is the Latin version), is the union of the prefix προ-, &quot;pro-&quot;, &quot;before, in front of&quot;, plus the plural of πύλη, &quot;pyle&quot;, &quot;gate&quot;, meaning literally &quot;that which is before the gates&quot;, but the word has come to mean simply &quot;gate building&quot;.

The propylaea were the monumental gates to the Acropolis, commissioned by the Athenian leader Pericles in order to rebuild the Acropolis at the conclusion of the Greco-Persian Wars. These propylaea were built wide enough to allow chariots through. The construction was part of Pericles&#x27; great rebuilding program for Athens in BCE. The project of the Propylaea began once the Parthenon was almost done. It was overseen by the Athenian architect Mnesicles. Though the work was suspended due to the Peloponnesian War, the important pieces of Mnesicles&#x27; vision were able to come through. The architecture is unique in that the horizontal beams across the roof were supported by marble girders, which were supported by iron bars. The only other known use of metal in Greek architecture for structural purposes is the Temple of Zeus at Agrigento.

==Propylaea outside the Greco-Roman world==
The oldest known freestanding &quot;propylaeum&quot; is the one located at the palace area in Pasargadae, an Achaemenid capital.

A covered passage, called &quot;the Propylaeum&quot;, used to face the Palace of Darius in Susa.

In the 18th century, the Athenian Propylaea inspired Carl Gotthard Langhans in construction of the Brandenburg Gate in Berlin.

<doc id="748931" wikidata="Q904997" url="?curid=748931" title="Slide show">
<text>A slide show, or slideshow, is a presentation of a series of still images (slides) on a projection screen or electronic display device, typically in a prearranged sequence. The changes may be automatic and at regular intervals or they may be manually controlled by a presenter or the viewer. Slide shows originally consisted of a series of individual photographic slides projected onto a screen with a slide projector, as opposed to the video or computer-based visual equivalent, in which the slides are not individual physical objects.

A slide show may be a presentation of images purely for their own visual interest or artistic value, sometimes unaccompanied by description or text, or it may be used to clarify or reinforce information, ideas, comments, solutions or suggestions which are presented verbally. Slide shows are sometimes still conducted by a presenter using an apparatus such as a carousel slide projector or an overhead projector, but now the use of an electronic video display device and a computer running presentation software is typical.

==History==
Slide shows had their beginnings in the 1600s, when hand-painted images on glass were first projected onto a wall with a &quot;magic lantern&quot;. By the late 1700s, showmen were using magic lanterns to thrill audiences with seemingly supernatural apparitions in a popular form of entertainment called a phantasmagoria. Sunlight, candles and oil lamps were the only available light sources. The development of new, much brighter artificial light sources opened up a world of practical applications for image projection. In the 1800s, a series of hand-painted glass &quot;lantern slides&quot; was sometimes projected to illustrate story-telling or a lecture. Widespread and varied uses for amusement and education evolved throughout the century. By 1900, photographic images on glass had replaced hand-painted images, but the black-and-white photographs were sometimes hand-colored with transparent dyes. The production of lantern slides had become a considerable industry, with dimensions standardized at 3.25 inches high by 4 inches wide in the US and 3.25 inches square in the UK and much of Europe.

&quot;Magic lantern shows&quot; also served as a form of home entertainment and were especially popular with children. They continued to have a place among commercial public amusements even after the coming of projected &quot;moving pictures&quot;. Between films, early movie theaters often featured &quot;illustrated songs&quot;, which were community sing-alongs with the lyrics and illustrations provided by a series of projected lantern slides. Theaters also used their lanterns to project advertising slides and messages such as &quot;Ladies, kindly remove your hats&quot;.

After 35 mm Kodachrome color film was introduced in 1936, a new standard 2×2 inch (5×5 cm) miniature lantern slide format was created to better suit the very small transparencies the film produced. In advertising, the antique &quot;magic lantern&quot; terminology was streamlined, so that the framed pieces of film were simply &quot;slides&quot; and the lantern used to project them was a &quot;slide projector&quot;.

Home slide shows were a relatively common phenomenon in middle-class American homes during the 1950s and 1960s.

An image on 35 mm film mounted in a 2×2 inch (5×5 cm) metal, card or plastic frame is still by far the most common photographic slide format.

==Uses==
A well-organized slide show allows a presenter to fit visual images to an oral presentation. The old adage &quot;A picture is worth a thousand words&quot; holds true, in that a single image can save a presenter from speaking a paragraph of descriptive details. As with any public speaking or lecturing, a certain amount of talent, experience, and rehearsal is required to make a successful slide show presentation.

Presentation software is most commonly used in the business world, where millions of presentations are created daily. Another very important area where it is used is for instructional purposes, usually with the intention of creating a dynamic, audiovisual presentation. The relevant points to the entire presentation are put on slides, and accompany a spoken monologue.

Slide shows have artistic uses as well, such as being used as a screensaver, or to provide dynamic imagery for a museum presentation, for example, or in installation art. David Byrne, among others, has created &quot;PowerPoint&quot; art. Slide shows have also been used for creating animations and games.

==In art==
Since the late 1960s, visual artists have used slide shows in museums and galleries as a device, either for presenting specific information about an action or research or as a phenomenological form in itself. According to the introduction of &quot;Slide Show&quot;, an exhibition organized at the Baltimore Museum of Art: “Through the simple technology of the slide projector and 35 mm color transparency, artists discovered a tool that enabled the transformation of space through the magnification of projected pictures, texts, and images.” Although some artists have not necessarily used 35 mm or color slides, and some, such as Robert Barry, have even abandoned images for texts, 35 mm color film slides are most commonly used. The images are sometimes accompanied by written text, either in the same slide or as an intertitle. Some artists, such as James Coleman and Robert Smithson, have used a voice-over with their slide presentations.

Slide shows have also been used by artists who use other media such as painting and sculpture to present their work publicly. In recent years there has been a growing use of the slide show by a younger generation of artists. The non-profit organization &quot;Slideluck Potshow&quot; holds slide show events globally, featuring works by amateur and professional artists, photographers, and gallerists. Participants in the event bring food, potluck style, and have a social dinner before the slide show begins.
Other known artists who have used slide shows in their work include Bas Jan Ader, Francis Alys, Jan Dibbets, Dan Graham, Rodney Graham, Nan Goldin, Louise Lawler, Ana Mendieta, Jonathan Monk, Dennis Oppenheim, Allan Sekula, Carey Young and Krzysztof Wodiczko.

==Digital==

Digital photo slide shows can be custom-made for clients from their photos, music, wedding invitations, birth announcements, or virtually any other scannable documents. Some producers call the resulting DVDs the new photomontage. Slide shows can be created not only on DVD, but also in HD video formats and as executable computer files. Photo slide show software has made it easy to create electronic digital slide shows, eliminating the need for expensive color reversal film and requiring only a digital camera and computer.

Photo slide show software often provides more options than simply showing the pictures. It is possible to add transitions, pan and zoom effects, video clips, background music, narration, captions, etc. By using computer software one therefore has the ability to enhance the presentation in a way that is not otherwise practical. The finished slide show can then be burned to a DVD, for use as a gift or for archiving, and later viewed using an ordinary DVD player.

==Web-based slide show==
A web-based slide show is a slide show which can be played (viewed or presented) using a web browser. Some web based slide shows are generated from presentation software and may be difficult to change (usually unintentionally so). Others offer templates allowing the slide show to be easily edited and changed.

Compared to a fully fledged presentation program the web based slide shows are usually limited in features.

A web-based slide show is typically generated to or authored in HTML, JavaScript and CSS code (files).

<doc id="748933" wikidata="Q1125897" url="?curid=748933" title="Hana-bi">
<text>Hana-bi (), released in the USA as Fireworks, is a 1997 Japanese crime drama film written, directed and edited by Takeshi Kitano, who also stars in it. The film&#x27;s score was composed by Joe Hisaishi in his fourth collaboration with Kitano.

&quot;Hana-bi&quot; received critical acclaim and won the Golden Lion at the 54th Venice International Film Festival, helping to establish Kitano as an internationally acclaimed filmmaker; the film has developed a cult following.

==Plot==
Yoshitaka Nishi is a violent former police detective who had to retire after a tragic accident during a botched arrest in which another detective, Tanaka, was killed by the suspect while two others, Nakamura and Horibe, were severely injured. Becoming unemployed, Nishi spends most of his time taking care of his sick wife Miyuki, who has terminal leukemia. To pay for his wife&#x27;s care, Nishi borrows money from the &quot;yakuza&quot; but is having difficulty repaying them.

Meanwhile, Horibe, who has been paralyzed since the incident, suffers deep depression after his wife and daughter leave him. In a conversation with Nishi, Horibe hints at committing suicide, while adding that he would like to paint but cannot afford to buy himself the necessary materials. After a botched suicide attempt, Horibe receives art supplies mailed to him by Nishi. He then takes up painting and creates surreal works of art, and later in a pointillist style.

Nishi buys a second-hand taxicab and repaints it in police colors. He arms himself with a revolver and robs a bank dressed as a policeman. Using the money, he pays off the &quot;yakuza&quot; and gives some to Tanaka&#x27;s widow. Nishi then leaves with his wife for a road trip. Nakamura learns from Tanaka&#x27;s widow about the gift and advises her to keep the money. He also learns about the paints for Horibe and soon realizes who committed the robbery. Nakamura and his partner attempt to reach Nishi, eventually tracing his route as he and his wife embark on their trip.

Meanwhile, even though Nishi has paid his debt to them, the &quot;yakuza&quot; deduce Nishi committed the robbery and attempt to extort additional money from him. The &quot;yakuza&quot; track down and confront Nishi, but he kills them all in a violent shootout. The next day, Nishi and his wife are at a beach when they are found by Nakamura and his partner. They prepare to arrest Nishi, but Nishi asks Nakamura to spare him a moment of time and lies alongside his wife on the beach. The couple comforts each other before the camera pans away towards the ocean before two gunshots are heard in the distance.

==Production==
In the film, Horibe takes up painting in the pointillist style in order to compensate for his paralysis. In reality, these paintings were painted by Kitano himself, whilst in recovery from an infamous motorcycle accident in August 1994 that left half of his face paralyzed.

Kitano&#x27;s daughter and former singer, Shoko Kitano, makes a cameo appearance playing a nameless girl flying a kite in the film&#x27;s closing scenes.

The film&#x27;s title is sometimes listed as &quot;&quot;Hana-bi&quot;, &quot;hana-bi&quot; or &quot;Hanabi&quot;&quot; on the covers of international DVD releases and other references to the film in the West. However, the official title is actually &quot;HANA-BI&quot;, fully capitalized, and is used on all Japanese licensed products, including theatrical posters, video covers and OST covers.

Kitano himself said it was not until he won the Golden Lion that he was accepted as a serious director in his native Japan; his prior films had been looked at as just the hobby of a famous comedian.

It also won the Grand Prix of the Belgian Syndicate of Cinema Critics.

Review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes reports that 96% of 24 critics have given the film a positive review, with a rating average of 8.4 out of 10. Metacritic assigned the film a weighted average score of 83 out of 100, based on 17 critics, indicating &quot;universal acclaim&quot;. American film critic Roger Ebert rated it three stars out of four, citing its unusual approach toward serenity and brutality, calling it &quot;a Charles Bronson &quot;Death Wish&quot; movie so drained of story, cliché, convention and plot that nothing is left, except pure form and impulse.&quot; Jaime N. Christley of &quot;Slant Magazine&quot; gave the film a perfect four star rating. David Stratton of The Movie Show called Hana-bi &quot;an unclassifiable film&quot; and &quot;quite extraordinary,&quot; with co-host Margaret Pomeranz stating &quot;I was ultimately so moved by it. It did what cinema is meant to do, for me anyway, and that&#x27;s take me on a journey that is mine, that ultimately ends up inside me, in my heart.&quot; Stratton concluded that &quot;Hana-bi&quot; is &quot;hard to describe to audiences, but all I can say is: Go and see it. It&#x27;s great.&quot; The duo both awarded the film five stars out of five.

==Legacy==
The film is included in the book 1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die. The Japanese filmmaker Akira Kurosawa cited the film as one of his 100 favorite films.

<doc id="748935" wikidata="Q1014848" url="?curid=748935" title="Heights of presidents and presidential candidates of the United States">
<text>A record of the heights of the presidents and presidential candidates of the United States is useful for evaluating what role, if any, height plays in presidential elections in the United States. Some observers have noted that the taller of the two major-party candidates tends to prevail, and argue this is due to the public&#x27;s preference for taller candidates.

The tallest U.S. president was Abraham Lincoln at , while the shortest was James Madison at .

Donald Trump, the current president, is according to a physical examination summary from February 2019.

==U.S. presidents by height order==
 
==Electoral success as a function of height==

Folk wisdom about U.S. presidential politics holds that the taller of the two major-party candidates always wins or almost always wins since the advent of the televised presidential debate. The topic is also popular among essayists and popular science writers. 

A number of studies have been published, but many have methodological issues, including varied and unjustified date ranges from which elections are sampled in order to calculate percentages of elections in which taller candidates have won. One 2001 study approached the issue by measuring the support of candidates in terms of popular votes, giving evidence for an advantage for taller candidates. Other studies have also compared presidential height to the average height of the population.

According to a 2013 study, significantly taller candidates were more likely to win the popular vote, while they were not more likely to win U.S. presidential elections: the number of taller candidates who won elections did not differ in a statistically significant manner from chance. It also found that the winning probability of the taller candidate increases to the present day, affecting studies which only analyze elections from the recent past.

=== Mentions in popular culture ===
* In Ray Bradbury&#x27;s 1953 dystopian novel &quot;Fahrenheit 451&quot;, when Mildred and her friends discuss the success of one presidential candidate over the other in a recent election, they talk only about the attractiveness of the winning candidate over the loser. One of their points is &quot;You just don&#x27;t go running a little short man like that against a tall man.&quot;
* A 1975 book called &quot;First Impressions: The Psychology of Encountering Others&quot; notes: &quot;Elevator Shoes, Anyone? One factor which has a far-reaching influence on how people are perceived, at least in American society, is height. From 1900 to 1968 the man elected U.S. president was always the taller of the two candidates. (Richard Nixon was slightly shorter than George McGovern.)&quot;
* A 1978 book titled &quot;The Psychology of Person Identification&quot; states: &quot;They also say that every President of the USA elected since the turn of the [20th] century has been the taller of the two candidates (Jimmy Carter being an exception).&quot;
* A 1988 article in the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; fashion section about a haberdasher devoted to clothing shorter men included a variation of the tale: &quot;Stern says he just learned that Dukakis is 5 feet, 8 inches. &#x27;Did you know,&#x27; he adds, noticeably disappointed, &#x27;that since 1900 the taller of the two candidates always wins?&#x27;&quot;
* A 1997 book called &quot;How to Make Anyone Fall in Love with You&quot; discusses the issue in a section about the importance of height: &quot;What about height? One assumes the taller the better, because our culture venerates height. In fact, practically every president elected in the United States since 1900 was the taller of the two candidates.&quot;
* A 1999 book, &quot;Survival of the Prettiest&quot; by Nancy Etcoff, repeated a version of the legend in a section on the power of heights: &quot;... Since 1776 only [two Presidents,] James Madison and Benjamin Harrison[,] have been below-average height. The easiest way to predict the winner in a United States election is to bet on the taller man: in this century you would have had an unbroken string of hits until 1972 when Richard Nixon beat George McGovern.&quot;
* A chapter titled &quot;Epistemology at the Core of Postmodernism&quot; in the 2002 book &quot;Telling the Truth: Evangelizing Postmodernisms&quot; makes this observation: &quot;I remember the subversive effect the observation had on me that in every U.S. presidential race, the taller of the two candidates had been elected. It opened up space for a counterdiscourse to the presumed rationality of the electoral process.&quot;

==Comparative table of heights of United States presidential candidates==

 
Notes:

** Lost the House of Representatives vote, but received the most popular votes and a plurality of electoral votes; however, not the majority needed to win.

† Ran unopposed

==Extremes==

The tallest president elected to office was Abraham Lincoln (). Portrait artist Francis Bicknell Carpenter supplies the information for Lincoln:

A disputed theory holds that Lincoln&#x27;s height is the result of the genetic condition multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2b (MEN2B); see medical and mental health of Abraham Lincoln.

Only slightly shorter than Lincoln was Lyndon B. Johnson (), the tallest president who originally entered office without being elected directly.

The shortest president elected to office was James Madison (); the shortest president to originally enter the office by means other than election is tied between Millard Fillmore and Harry S. Truman (both were ).

The tallest unsuccessful presidential candidate (who is also the tallest of all presidential candidates) is Winfield Scott, who stood at and lost the 1852 election to Franklin Pierce, who stood at . The second-tallest unsuccessful candidate is John Kerry at . The shortest unsuccessful presidential candidate is Stephen A. Douglas at . The next shortest is Kamala Harris, who lost the 2024 election and is .

The largest height difference between two presidential candidates (out of the candidates whose heights are known) was in the 1860 election, when Abraham Lincoln stood taller than opponent Stephen A. Douglas. The second-largest difference was in the 1812 election, with DeWitt Clinton standing taller than incumbent James Madison. The 2024 election between Donald Trump and Kamala Harris had the third-largest difference at .

<doc id="748937" wikidata="Q1091097" url="?curid=748937" title="Kikujiro">
<text>Kikujiro () is a 1999 Japanese road drama film written, directed and co-edited by Takeshi Kitano, who also stars in the film with Yusuke Sekiguchi. Its score was composed by Joe Hisaishi. The film was entered into the 1999 Cannes Film Festival.

&quot;Kikujiro&quot; tells the story of a young boy searching for his mother during his summer vacation. The film is mostly divided into smaller chapters, listed as entries in the boy&#x27;s summer vacation diary. Kitano&#x27;s inspiration for the character (not the film) was his own father, Kikujiro Kitano, a gambler who struggled to feed his family and pay the rent.

Similar to his earlier works &quot;Getting Any?&quot; and &quot;A Scene at the Sea&quot;, Kitano references the yakuza only tangentially in &quot;Kikujiro&quot;, a departure from his work in crime dramas such as &quot;Sonatine&quot; and &quot;Hana-bi&quot;. Aimed at the whole family, the film was allegedly inspired by &quot;The Wizard of Oz&quot; with the basic premise being a road trip. Kitano&#x27;s familiar elements and locales are present: drawings, vignettes, the seaside, and angels. Although the plot is composed largely of sad events, the film often has a light-hearted atmosphere, achieved mostly through Kitano&#x27;s character and his somewhat bizarre encounters.

==Plot==
Masao, who lives alone with his grandmother in an old Shitamachi area of Tokyo, receives a package, and in looking for a seal finds a photo of his long lost mother. He finds her address in Toyohashi, several hundred miles to the west. Leaving home to see his mother, he meets his grandmother&#x27;s neighbors, Kikujiro and his wife. Kikujiro&#x27;s wife forces Kikujiro to accompany Masao on a journey to see his mother, telling Masao&#x27;s grandmother that they are going to the beach.

At the start of their journey, Kikujiro is not serious about reaching Toyohashi. He gets absorbed in track cycling races and gambles away their winnings. Later, left outside a yakitori restaurant, Masao encounters a molester. After a narrow escape, Kikujiro promises to keep to the journey and take Masao to his mother.
When the taxi Kikujiro steals breaks down, they are forced to hitchhike to Toyohashi, meeting various people along the way. They get lifts from a juggler and her boyfriend on a date, and a travelling poet who delivers them to Toyohashi. When they finally reach the address of Masao&#x27;s mother, Kikujiro finds her living as a housewife with another man and their daughter. Masao&#x27;s mother lives a completely different life from what he expected. It is almost as if she has forgotten him. Kikujiro tells Masao that she has just moved away, pretending not to have seen her. He tries to comfort Masao with a small blue bell shaped like an angel bullied from two bikers whom he happens to come across.

Masao is so disappointed that Kikujiro cannot help but try to brighten up their return trip to Tokyo. He tells him an angel will come at the sound of the bell.

They visit a summer matsuri held in a local Shinto shrine. While Kikujiro gets into trouble with some yakuza over a fixed shooting game, Masao dreams of dancing &quot;tengu&quot;.

Back on the road, they meet the poet and the two bikers again. They decide to camp a few days together. Masao enjoys playing some traditional games with them.

Kikujiro is reminded of his own mother (it is implied that she, like Masao&#x27;s mother, also left him as a child). Kikujiro gets one of the bikers to take him from their camp to his mother&#x27;s nursing home in Daito-cho, a small country town, but he eventually decides not to see her and returns to the camp.

The men continue to do their best to entertain Masao by larking about for a few more days. Before they are to return to Tokyo, Masao dreams about them appearing over the Milky Way. In the morning, the bikers say goodbye to them and leave the camp. Masao and Kikujiro get a lift in the poet&#x27;s car to Tokyo. After dropping them off at a bridge, the poet continues on his way to Osaka and Kyūshū.

Before Masao and Kikujiro part, Kikujiro says, &quot;Let&#x27;s do it again sometime,&quot; and Masao thanks him. Kikujiro tells Masao to take care of his grandmother. Masao asks Kikujiro&#x27;s name and Kikujiro answers, &quot;Kikujiro! Now scram!&quot; Masao passes a small bridge with the angel bell ringing, mirroring the first shot of Masao at the start of the film.

==Themes==
The film explores alienation and inclusion in Japanese society. The main characters, and those who help them along the way, are all considered outcasts from accepted social norms, not being part of a traditional family or group structure. Characters who maintain a more accepted lifestyle are frequently at odds with the protagonists.

Early in the film, the protagonists react to their alienation with anger (Kikujiro) and sadness (Masao). Along their journey, they start to discover how alike they are and the events in Toyohashi act as a turning point from which the characters begin to find comfort in their shared isolation.

<text>Peter Denis Sutherland (25 April 1946 – 7 January 2018) was an Irish businessman, barrister and Fine Gael politician who served as UN Special Representative for International Migration from 2006 to 2017. He was known for serving in various international organisations, political and business roles.

Sutherland was the UN Special Representative of the Secretary-General for International Migration until March 2017. Appointed in January 2006, he was responsible for the creation of the Global Forum on Migration and Development (GFMD). He also served as President of the International Catholic Migration Commission, as well as a member of the Migration Advisory Board of the International Organization for Migration. He was a board member of Wallenberg-owned ABB and the Wallenbergs&#x27; conglomerate holding company, Investor AB.

A barrister by profession, Sutherland was a Senior Counsel of the Bar Council of Ireland. He previously served as Attorney General of Ireland (1981–1982, 1982–1984); European Commissioner for Competition (1985–1989); founding Director-General of the World Trade Organization, formerly GATT (1993–1995); and chairman of Goldman Sachs International (1995–2015). He received numerous awards, including the European Person of the Year Award (1988).

== Early and personal life ==

Sutherland was born in Dublin in 1946 to William George Sutherland and Barbara Sutherland (). He was educated at Gonzaga College in Ranelagh, Dublin. He graduated in Civil Law at University College Dublin and practised at the Irish Bar between 1969 and 1980. He married Maruja, a Spaniard, in 1974.

== Political career ==
He was a Fine Gael candidate at the 1973 general election for the Dublin North-West constituency. He received 1,969 (6.2%) of the first-preference votes but was not elected.

=== Attorney General of Ireland ===

Sutherland was appointed Attorney General of Ireland in June 1981, serving until March 1982. He retook the post from December 1982 to December 1984.

=== European Commissioner ===
Sutherland was appointed to the European Commission (EC) in 1985 and had responsibility for competition policy and, initially for 1985 only, also for education. He said that he was especially pleased to have proposed the establishment of the Erasmus Programme that allows European university students to study in other member states.

He was chairman of the Committee that produced the Sutherland Report on the completion of the Internal Market of the European Economic Community (EEC), commissioned by the EC and presented to the European Council at its Edinburgh meeting in 1992.

Sutherland was the youngest ever European Commissioner. He served in the first Delors Commission, where he played a crucial role in opening up European competition, particularly in the airline, telecoms, and energy sectors. He also played a major role in reinforcing state aid control, notably through the high-profile Boussac case.

== GATT/WTO ==
In 1993, he became Director-General of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (now the World Trade Organization). Later Mickey Kantor, the United States Trade Representative, credited him with being the father of globalisation and said that without him there would have been no WTO. The Uruguay round of global trade talks, concluded in December 1993 with Sutherland as chair of GATT, produced a &quot;comprehensive, rules-based and global trade regime&quot; which was the biggest trade agreement in history and established the WTO. His integral role in the successful conclusion of these negotiations has been cited as &quot;indispensable&quot;. Chairing the Uruguay Round, Sutherland &quot;employed tactics the likes of which had never been seen before in GATT…he worked to create the sense of unstoppable momentum&quot; by mobilising the press and media and instigating &quot;a more aggressive public relations than the staid GATT had ever before seen&quot;.

A 2013 book by Craig VanGrasstek of the Harvard Kennedy School, published by the WTO, &quot;The History and Future of the World Trade Organization&quot;, details Sutherland&#x27;s role in the formation and establishment of the body.

On the elevation of the role of director-general, VanGrasstek writes, &quot;The office is shaped to a great degree by the person who occupies it, and Director-General Peter Sutherland – who served both as the last GATT director-general and the first WTO director-general – redefined the role and the links between that office and the leadership in the members in a way that gave him and his successors additional options for the conduct of negotiations&quot;. Sutherland was instrumental in elevating the office of director-general to one that dealt directly with presidents and prime ministers, not just ministers, a key factor in the success of negotiations and the political esteem of the body going forward. He served as Chairman of the Advisory Council to the Director-General, which produced the report on the future of the WTO, published in 2005.

== Business career ==

Sutherland was the chairman of Allied Irish Banks (AIB) from 1989 until 1993. 

He was non-executive chairman of Goldman Sachs International (a registered UK broker-dealer, a subsidiary of Goldman Sachs) until June 2015. 

Until June 2009, he was non-executive chairman of BP, being replaced by Carl-Henric Svanberg, formerly chief executive officer of Ericsson. Sutherland was a director of the Royal Bank of Scotland Group until the UK government took it over to avoid bankruptcy. He also formerly served on the board of ABB. He was also a non-executive director of construction materials giant CRH plc from 1989 to July 1993. CRH plc was fined in 1994 by the European Competition Directorate General for its role in the pan-European cement cartel 

He served on the steering committee of the Bilderberg Group until May 2014, and was Honorary Chairman of the Trilateral Commission (from 2010), formerly Chairman of the Trilateral Commission (Europe) (2001–2010); and vice chairman of the European Round Table of Industrialists (2006–2009).

He was chairman of the Board of Governors of the European Institute of Public Administration (Maastricht) from 1991 to 1996. He was also Honorary President of the European Movement Ireland.

He was a member of the Hong Kong Chief Executive&#x27;s Council of International Advisers between 1998 and 2005.

He produced the Sutherland Report for the Portuguese government on the handover of Macao to China in January 2000.

He was President of the Federal Trust for Education and Research, a British think tank; chairman of The Ireland Fund of Great Britain from 2001 to 2009, part of The Ireland Funds; and a member of the advisory council of Business for New Europe, a British pro-European think-tank.

In 2002, Sutherland was elected a member of the Royal Irish Academy (MRIA).

He was a member of the Commission on Human Security set up by the Japanese government that reported to the United Nations in 2003.

In 2005, he was appointed as Goodwill Ambassador for the United Nations Industrial Development Organization. In Spring 2006 he was appointed Chair of the London School of Economics (LSE) Council commencing in 2008, a position he held until February 2015.

Sutherland also served on the International Advisory Board of IESE Business School, the graduate business school of Spain&#x27;s University of Navarra.

In January 2006, he was appointed by UN secretary-general Kofi Annan as his Special Representative for Migration. In this position, he was responsible for promoting the establishment of a Global Forum on Migration and Development, a state-led effort open to all UN members to help governments better understand how migration can benefit their development goals. UN member states acclaimed the Global Forum at the UN High-Level Dialogue on International Migration and Development in September 2006, 

On 5 December 2006, he was appointed as Consultor of the Extraordinary Section of the Administration of the Patrimony of the Apostolic See (a financial adviser to the Vatican). He received a Papal knighthood for his service, in 2008 (KCSG).

Sutherland was also co-chairman of the High Level Group appointed by the governments of Germany, the United Kingdom, Indonesia and Turkey to report on the conclusion of the Doha Round and the future of multilateral trade negotiations. Its report was issued in May 2011.

In May 2012, Sutherland was named Honorary President of the European Policy Centre, a Brussels-based independent think tank.

== Later years ==
In an interview with &quot;The Irish Times&quot; in early 2010, Sutherland revealed that in summer 2009, during a holiday, one of his children noticed a swelling on his throat while they sat on a beach. He was back home in London within a week, undergoing a major operation. Sutherland had an operation for throat cancer in August 2009, and following the procedure, he underwent chemotherapy and radiotherapy.

For Sutherland, a Europhile, the worst part about his illness was missing the &quot;mortal combat&quot; of fighting for the Yes vote in the second Lisbon referendum.

Sutherland visited Fianna Fáil politician Brian Lenihan to tell him what a great job he thought he was doing and to say that Lenihan had the potential to be one of the great &quot;taoisigh&quot; of the 21st century. Lenihan was taken aback, he said. Sutherland believed Ireland failed in economic terms over most of the past four decades except for a &quot;sparkling period&quot; from 1994 to 2002 when the state took advantage of European Union (EU) changes freeing up the movement of goods, capital and services across Europe.

In November 2010, he renewed his involvement in trade issues when he was appointed co-chair of an Experts Group created by the heads of government of Germany, Great Britain, Indonesia and Turkey to report on the priority actions to combat protectionism and to boost global trade. The Trade Experts Group&#x27;s interim report was launched at Davos on 28 January 2011.

Kofi Annan twice offered him the job of United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, a fact, he said, that he had never disclosed publicly before, but he declined both times due to other commitments. He cited his work at GATT and the introduction of the Erasmus student exchange programme when he briefly held the education portfolio at the Commission in 1986 as his two most rewarding achievements.

== Death ==
In September 2016, Sutherland suffered a heart attack while attending mass at a Catholic church in London. Six months later, he resigned from his post as UN Special Representative of the Secretary-General for International Migration because of poor health. After a long illness, Sutherland died in Dublin on 7 January 2018, of complications from an infection, aged 71.

== Immigration policy ==
Sutherland strongly advocated unrestricted immigration into the EU. Sutherland gave his opinion to the UK&#x27;s House of Lords Home Affairs Committee on 21 June 2012 as being 

(a) that &quot;at the most basic level individuals should have freedom of choice&quot; about working and studying in other countries and that EU states should stop targeting &quot;highly skilled&quot; migrants (and, conversely, placing restrictions on low-skilled migrants). Sutherland also argued (b) that migration is a &quot;crucial dynamic for economic growth&quot; and that this is the case &quot;however difficult it may be to explain this to the citizens of those states&quot;. Sutherland&#x27;s stated opinions on policy were (a) that &quot;it was fundamentally important for states to cooperate on migration policy rather than developing their own policies in isolation as &#x27;no state is or can be an island 

(b) that multiculturalism is both inevitable and desirable: &quot;It&#x27;s impossible to consider that the degree of homogeneity which is implied by the other argument can survive because states have to become more open states, in terms of the people who inhabit them&quot; and also

(c) that &quot;the European Union, in my view, should be doing its best to undermine&quot; any &quot;sense of our homogeneity and difference from others&quot;. An ageing or declining native population in countries like Germany or southern EU states was the &quot;key argument and, I hesitate to the use word because people have attacked it, for the development of multicultural states&quot;, he added.

Sutherland restated his view in the syndicated article co-authored with Cecilia Malmström titled &quot;Europe&#x27;s Immigration Challenge&quot;, the opening paragraph of which declares:

In June 2014, Sutherland was appointed President of the International Catholic Migration Commission (ICMC).

<text>Randolph Farms Landfill is a 120-acre (486,000 m2) landfill owned by the Balkema family of Kalamazoo, Michigan, located in Modoc, Indiana. In addition to Randolph County, it serves Delaware, Madison, Jay, Wayne, and Henry Counties in Indiana, as well as Darke and Miami Counties in Ohio.

The owners of the landfill are, as of June 22, 2004, petitioning the Randolph County Board of Zoning Appeals to allow for an expansion, nearly three times its current size, in order that the landfill continue operation for another 50 years. Similar attempts at expansion were denied twice in the 1990s.

Opponents of expansion, in the majority in largely rural Randolph County, point out that only 6% of the trash in the landfill is from Randolph County, whereas most of it is from Miami County. The landfill could likely reach a height of 165 feet (50 m), which would make it not only one of the largest landfills in the state, but also the highest point of elevation in Indiana. The landfill would allegedly be visible for over a mile (2 km) away.

Randolph Farms was built on a limestone hill, directly over sand and gravel aquifers, near the drainage basins of White River and Whitewater River.

Opponents, citing the previous denials of expansion, say it should again be denied due to groundwater contamination, as well as increased traffic, odor, and lower aesthetics and property values. Organic farmers have claimed that toxins could affect their produce yields.

In the mid 1990s, groundwater monitoring wells detected low levels of volatile organic compounds, due to the landfill gas produced by the landfill. Tests dating to 1999 show that the high permeability of the underground aquifer point to a high risk for water pollution.

<doc id="748951" wikidata="Q7996484" url="?curid=748951" title="Whitgift Centre">
<text>The Whitgift Centre is a large shopping centre in the town centre of Croydon, opening in stages between 1968 and 1970. The centre comprises of retail space, and was the largest covered shopping development in Greater London until the opening of Westfield London at White City in 2008. The Whitgift Centre has a monthly footfall of 2.08 million. The complex includes an office development.

The shopping centre has been synonymous with Croydon since its opening. In 2013, Hammerson and the Westfield Group formed a joint venture to redevelop the shopping mall and combine it with neighbouring Centrale. After years of delays, work was expected to begin in 2020, although the future of the project was under review in February 2019 citing concerns over Brexit and structural changes on the high street.

The shopping centre is managed by Hammerson Leasing. In 2023 Unibail-Rodamco-Westfield acquired full ownership of the Whitgift Centre, along with the nearby Centrale centre.

==Background==

The name of the centre comes from John Whitgift, a former archbishop of Canterbury who is buried nearby in Croydon Minster. The Centre&#x27;s Land freehold is owned by the Whitgift Foundation, a charity registered in England and Wales. The Foundation sold a long-term lease to a company 75% owned and controlled by Howard Holdings plc, and 25% by the Foundation. Designed by Geddes Architects, the centre was built after the demolition of the historic buildings of Whitgift School, which had more recently been occupied from 1931 to 1965 by Whitgift Middle School, known from 1954 as the Trinity School of John Whitgift, both schools having subsequently moved away to new sites. 

==History==

The centre was designed by Anthony Minoprio and built between 1965 and 1970 by Fitzroy Robinson &amp; Partners. Commenting in 1971, architectural historians Ian Nairn and Nikolaus Pevsner stated that &quot;most of the architectural details are banal, but the centre functions unusually well as a shopping precinct&quot;.

In the first two decades of its existence, the Whitgift Centre had no roof and was open to the elements.

The first shop to open was Boots on 17 October 1968, and the centre itself was officially opened in October 1970 by the Duchess of Kent. In the middle of the Whitgift Centre there was a Roman-themed pub called The Forum.
In the 1990s, the centre was almost completely rebuilt to an atrium design, and the Forum pub was demolished.

Some businesses of the former Croydon Village Outlet, based at the former Allders site, moved into Whitgift after the Outlet was taken over by Croydon Council in 2019.

==Structure==
The shopping centre is on three storeys. The upper two are for retail, and the basement provides vehicle access to all the retail units, with a network of service roads.

The Centre adjoins the now closed Allders department store, which has substantial frontage onto the Centre. The office accommodation consists of five tower blocks rising above the shopping centre.

The other major shopping centre in central Croydon is Centrale, owned by Hammerson, on the other side of the street named North End. Both centres are jointly marketed.

==Redevelopment==

As part of Croydon Vision 2020, plans to develop and expand the centre were formalised by leaseholder and landlord Howard Holdings, for which a planning application was submitted. Construction of the extension was due to start in 2009 and be finished in 2014, as promised by Geddes Architects who were the main contractor.

In 2010, Howard Holdings went into administration. Their 75% of the lease company and management of the centre is now managed by their administrators, on behalf of Royal London Asset Management and the Irish Bank Resolution Corporation.

In mid-2011, two companies were invited to pitch for the redevelopment: Australian-based Westfield Group and UK-French based Hammerson. The Whitgift Foundation came to a binding agreement with Westfield for a £1bn redevelopment scheme. However, RLAM/IBRC preferred Hammerson, and so came to an alternate agreement, announcing Hammerson as the winner in April 2012. Although RLAM/IBRC owned 75% of the leasehold company, no development could take place without the agreement of the freeholder, the Whitgift Foundation. In mid-2012, the joint leaseholders agreed on a public consultation of the two rivals and their schemes. The winner was to be granted a long-term lease, subject to redevelopment.

In January 2013, Hammerson and Westfield formed a joint venture to redevelop the shopping mall. The joint venture company will purchase a 25% interest in the Whitgift Centre, following completion of Hammerson&#x27;s conditional acquisition agreement with Royal London. Under the new agreement, they intend to redevelop and combine the two main Croydon shopping centres, the Whitgift Centre and Centrale. The mixed use scheme of around 200,000 m2 will include retail, leisure and residential use with the potential for hotels and offices.

On 25 November 2013, the redevelopment plan was approved by Croydon Council, subject to final approval by the Mayor of London on 27 November. Subsequently, plans were revised; in 2016, the expected start date for works was 2017, with completion due by 2020. These were later revised again with the planning application being decided upon in 2017 with construction to commence in 2018, later delayed until September 2019. , shop owners and council leaders did not know when redevelopment would begin. In February 2020 it was reported that the plan was delayed again as it was under &quot;review&quot;.

The delays and uncertainty regarding the future of Whitgift has led to a reduced footfall and some traders moving out. Following the pandemic the uncertainty did not lessen.

In 2023 Unibail-Rodamco-Westfield acquired full ownership of the Whitgift and Centrale shopping centres.

==In popular culture==
The shopping centre sign appears in Andrew Haigh&#x27;s 2023 film &quot;All of Us Strangers&quot;.

The shopping centre also appears in Season 4, Episode 5 of the IT Crowd

<doc id="748953" wikidata="Q961235" url="?curid=748953" title="Brother (2000 film)">
<text>is a 2000 crime film starring, written, directed, and edited by Takeshi Kitano. The film premiered on September 7, 2000 at the Venice Film Festival. The plot centers on a mature yakuza gangster who has to flee to America, where he unites forces with his little brother and his brother’s gang in Los Angeles.

It is the only American production directed by Kitano and also the only such film in which he starred.

==Plot==
Yamamoto (Takeshi Kitano) is a brutal and experienced yakuza enforcer whose boss was killed and whose clan was defeated in a criminal war with a rival family. Surviving clan members have few options: either to join the winners, reconciling with shame and distrust, or to die by committing seppuku. Yamamoto, however, decides to escape to Los Angeles along with his associate Kato (Susumu Terajima). There he finds his estranged half-brother Ken (Claude Maki), who runs a small-time drug business together with his local African-American friends. At the first meeting, Yamamoto badly hurts one of them, Denny (Omar Epps), for an attempt to scam him. Later, Denny becomes one of the Yamamoto&#x27;s closest friends and associates.

Used to living in a clan and according to its laws, Yamamoto creates a hapless gang out of Ken&#x27;s buddies. The new gang quickly and brutally attacks Mexican drug bosses and takes control of their territory in LA. They also form an alliance with Shirase (Masaya Kato), a criminal leader of Little Tokyo district, making their group even stronger. As time passes, Yamamoto and his new gang emerge as a formidable force, gradually expanding their turf to such an extent that they confront the powerful Italian Mafia. Now everybody respectfully addresses Yamamoto as Aniki (兄貴, elder brother). But soon Aniki suddenly loses any interest in their now successful but dangerous business, spending his time with a girlfriend or just sitting silently thinking about something. However, the Mafia ruthlessly strikes back, and soon Yamamoto and his gang are driven into a disastrous situation of no return as they are hunted down one by one.

== Soundtrack ==

===Track listing===
== Production ==
Impressed with Europeans&#x27; interest in yakuza, Kitano wrote what he described as an old-fashioned yakuza film. To greater contrast the character against more familiar elements, he set it in a foreign country, choosing Los Angeles as a place-holder. When producer Jeremy Thomas asked Kitano if he was interested in foreign productions, Kitano told him about the script. Thomas promised him complete creative control, which Kitano said he got. Commenting on the differing styles of filmmaking, Kitano said that American productions are more focused on the business side and are less sentimental. Kitano cited their strong pride in their professionalism as a positive aspect.

== Release ==
Several scenes were censored for the U.S. release.

== Reception ==
At the time of its release, &quot;Brother&quot; was hyped as Kitano&#x27;s vehicle for breaking into the United States film market. The film has a 47% rating on Rotten Tomatoes based on 74 reviews, and an average rating of 5.2/10. The website&#x27;s critical consensus states: &quot;There is too much hollow bloodshed in &quot;Brother&quot;, and the characters are stereotypically flat&quot;. Metacritic assigned the film a weighted average score of 47 out of 100, based on 23 critics, indicating &quot;mixed or average reviews&quot;.

Roger Ebert, who has praised all of Kitano&#x27;s films he has seen, complimented Kitano in his review but ultimately rated the film two out of four stars, writing that &quot;&quot;Brother&quot; is a typical Kitano film in many ways, but not one of his best ones.&quot; Marc Savlov of the &quot;Austin Chronicle&quot; gave the film two and half stars out of five, stating: &quot;Kitano&#x27;s beat is an altogether grimmer affair, laden with dark irony and unexpurgated scenes of violence. It&#x27;s rougher stuff than most would expect, though not unrewarding in its own horrific way.&quot; A reviewer of &quot;Time Out&quot; commented: &quot;A film of almost diagrammatic clarity, in which questions of loyalty, honour and, yes, brotherhood are mere pieces on the chessboard.&quot;

In his review for &quot;Variety&quot;, David Rooney wrote: &quot;Kitano frequently tips his hat to the American gangster movie in Coppola-styled scenes of confrontation and carnage. But while many of the action set pieces are enlivened by the director’s customary verve and humor, the plot advances clumsily with the narrative engine continually sputtering and stopping. Characters are so unsatisfyingly developed that the film delivers only on a basic level as a tale of gangster rivalry, greed, elimination and expansion, with its larger themes struggling to register... &quot;Brother&quot; is full of elegant compositions and poised, deliberate camera movement but rarely matches the visual impact of earlier Kitano features.&quot;

===Response from Takeshi Kitano===
Kitano stated in an interview that he was not fully satisfied with the final result of &quot;Brother&quot; and that he regretted his &quot;Hollywood&quot; adventure, which was supposed to bring him a broader audience with a higher exposure. Kitano said he had no intention of shooting outside Japan again.

<doc id="748955" wikidata="Q4916718" url="?curid=748955" title="2004 Birmingham Hodge Hill by-election">
<text>A by-election was held for the United Kingdom Parliament seat of [[Birmingham Hodge Hill (UK Parliament constituency)|Birmingham Hodge Hill]], on 15 July 2004. The by-election was called following the resignation of Labour Party Member of Parliament (MP), Terry Davis, on 22 June 2004. Davis had been appointed as Secretary General of the Council of Europe. The by-election was held on the same day as the Leicester South by-election, which saw Labour lose the seat to the Liberal Democrats on a 21% swing.

The by-election was won by Labour candidate Liam Byrne, but with a much reduced majority of 460 votes over the Liberal Democrat candidate, Nicola Davies.

==Background==
Birmingham Hodge Hill has had a Labour MP since the 1950 general election, the only break being a Conservative Party victory at a 1977 by-election for the Birmingham Stechford constituency, which returned to Labour at the 1979 general election.

==Campaign==
The by-election was heavily contested by the Labour Party and the Liberal Democrats, with both parties alleging &quot;dirty tricks&quot; by the other. Liam Byrne&#x27;s campaign team, led by West Bromwich East MP Tom Watson, produced leaflets with slogans such as &quot;Labour is on your side, the Lib Dems are on the side of failed asylum seekers.&quot; Another flier stated: &quot;While Labour were tough the Lib Dems were wimps—they tried to stop us taking away benefits from failed asylum seekers and they voted against plans to speed up deportations.&quot;

Meanwhile, the Lib Dems reminded voters of Labour&#x27;s decision to invade Iraq the previous year and, in the constituency&#x27;s predominantly Muslim Washwood Heath ward, produced a leaflet carrying a picture of Charles Kennedy and Nicola Davies surrounded by South Asian voters.

During the campaign, Labour pledged to &quot;smash teen gangs&quot; and create &quot;yob-free zones&quot;. Domestic issues such as schools, hospitals and crime also featured prominently.

==Results==
At the by-election, the seat was retained by Labour, but with a vastly reduced majority of only 460 votes. The Lib Dems narrowed the gap with a 26.7% swing, which at the time was the eleventh largest in United Kingdom by-election history.




==Previous result==





==Aftermath==
Some senior Labour strategists saw the election, as well as the one in Leicester South that took place the same day, as among the worst by-election results ever for Labour. They pointed out that the Lib Dems would very likely have won in Birmingham Hodge Hill were it not for the Respect Party, who secured some of the anti-Iraq War vote. Charles Kennedy agreed, pinpointing anger about the war as a critical factor in his party&#x27;s success. He said, &quot;The story of the night is of two-party politics in the cities - the Liberal Democrats versus Labour.&quot;

&quot;The Independent&quot;″s Editorial on 17 July stated: &quot;If the prime minister had hoped for &#x27;closure&#x27; on Iraq following the Butler Committee report, the voters of Birmingham and Leicester have told him in no uncertain terms that he won&#x27;t get it. Of course Iraq and the failure to find WMDs are not the only reasons for the anti-Blair vote so dramatically demonstrated in these two by-elections. The state of public services and local concerns also played a part. Nor should anything detract from the achievement of the Liberal Democrats...The Lib Dem leader, Charles Kennedy, had every right to declare as the results came in that this was &#x27;no flash in the pan&#x27; ... The fact is that, in these two votes, as in other recent results, the Lib Dems have shown that they can unseat a ruling Labour majority as much as a Tory one.&quot;

The &quot;Daily Mirror&quot;″s Editorial stated: &quot;It isn&#x27;t often that defeat can leave you smiling, but Tony Blair must have been grinning all over his face [on Friday]. The night before Labour had lost one safe seat to the Lib Dems and only clung on to another by a few hundred votes. Yet what could have been a by-election disaster was not. For it was a catastrophe for [Conservative Party leader] Michael Howard. The Tories crawled in a poor third in both elections ... The voters of Leicester South and Birmingham Hodge Hill confirmed what the polls are saying - the British people have had enough of the Tories.&quot;

<doc id="748964" wikidata="Q1044697" url="?curid=748964" title="Carousel slide projector">
<text>A carousel slide projector is a slide projector that uses a rotary tray to store slides, used to project slide photographs and to create slideshows. It was first patented on May 11, 1965, by David E. Hansen of Fairport, New York. Hansen was an industrial designer at the Eastman Kodak Company. A patent for the rotary tray was granted in 1966 after a 1962 application by the Eastman Kodak Company.

The original concept for the carousel slide projector is credited to Italian-American Louis Misuraca, who brought his design to the Kodak company, and sold it for a lump sum. Kodak released their first Carousel projector, the Model 550, in 1961 and sold it until 1966. The 1963 Carousel Model S (Carousel-S), a professional model sold only in Germany, was designed by Hans Gugelot and Reinhold Häcker for Kodak AG in Stuttgart and is in the permanent collection of the Museum of Modern Art.

==Physical form==
A separate, circular tray holds several (usually 80 or 140) 35mm slides, and is filled with each slide placed in upside down and backwards, so that the image is projected with the correct orientation. The tray is in a horizontal orientation, like a merry-go-round or carousel, whence the name. The tray has a metal plate on the bottom with an opening approximately wide, barely large enough to pass a single slide to the projection gate below it.

The projector body contains a motor which rotates the plastic main body of the tray (containing the slides) while the metal plate is fixed with the opening over the projection gate. As the tray is advanced, a reciprocating mechanism pushes the currently loaded slide back out into the tray, then the tray is rotated, dropping the next slide into position between the light source and lens. A shutter in the projector closed during slide changes; on projectors built from 1981 on, that shutter remained closed when no slide was in the gate.

A common series of carousel projectors with a horizontally mounted tray was introduced in the spring of 1962 by Kodak (Kodak Carousel/Ektagraphic). The earliest Carousel models (mostly known as the 500-series) are compatible only with the 80-slide trays.

The Kodak system offered three advantages over the straight-tray, horizontal-feed systems that were then common on the market. The Carousel tray held slides in place with a locking ring on its hub, preventing slides from accidentally spilling out of the tray if it was dropped. By using gravity to lower the slide into the projector, the chance of jamming was greatly reduced, since a warped slide would not descend past the point at which it encountered resistance in the mechanism. The circular tray also enabled the projector to display automated shows without the need to manually reset the slide tray between performances.

Kodak also offered a stack loader that allowed running a stack of up to 40 slides without using a tray, but forward only; and clip sets holding up to 36 slides per clip. A box of 12 clips could store up to 432 slides, and keep them organized.

A more robust version, the Ektagraphic Carousel projector, was produced for the industrial and trade show market. It was basically the same projector, but designed for operation for events lasting for days or weeks. It was available with a zoom lens, enabling the projector to be positioned away from the middle of the audience.

During the 1970s, Kodak also produced a &quot;Pocket Carousel&quot; projector for use with miniature 110 format Kodachrome and Ektachrome slides.

The Kodak Carousel projector was discontinued in October 2004.

===Vertical carousel variants===

Less well-known but plentiful is a family of projectors based around a design originated by Sawyer&#x27;s and later sold under other brand names. That manufacturer&#x27;s first slide projectors, in the late 1950s, had used straight trays. In 1963, Sawyer&#x27;s Rotomatic, the first version using circular trays (called Rototrays), was introduced. These are distinguished from Kodak Carousel projectors by the round tray being in an &quot;upright&quot; orientation, like a Ferris wheel. Unlike the Carousel tray&#x27;s use of a locking collar to hold the slide in the tray, the Rototray held slides in place using friction and a metal spring against the side of each slide. 

Projectors using the 100-slide Rototray were backward-compatible with the Bell &amp; Howell TDC-Universal straight slide trays that had been popular since the late 1950s. The 1960s would also see the introduction of a plethora of less popular tray designs, most incompatible with each other, introduced by manufacturers possibly hoping to profit from the razor-and-blades business model.
==Nomenclature and history==
The first Kodak Carousel projector was targeted toward the consumer and carried the model designation &#x27;550&#x27;. In 1963, the first professionally oriented model was marketed in Germany as the Model S. Other models include:
* 1964–72: Carousel 800 (consumer)
* 1967–69: Ektagraphic (professional)
* 1969–71: Ektagraphic AF, E, and B (professional)
* 1971–84: Ektagraphic E-2, B2, F-2, AF-3 (professional)
* 1972–81: Carousel &#x27;H&#x27; (models 600H, 650H, 750H, 760H, 850H, consumer)
* 1975–84: Ektagraphic AF-2K, AF-1
* 1979–84: Ektagraphic B-2AR, S-AV 1020, 1030, 2000, 2030, 2050
* 1981–2004: Carousel 4000, 4200, 4400, 4600, 5200, 5400, 5600
* 1981–2004: Ektagraphic III (E plus, A, AMT, ATS, Br, ABR)
* 1992–2004: Ektapro (320, 3000, 9020)
* 1992–2004: Ektalite (1000, 1500, 2000)

The manufacturing date may be decoded using the CAMEROSITY code, which is a four or six-letter code which corresponds to the month and year (four-letter) or month, day, and year (six-letter) of manufacture, using the substitution cipher C=1, A=2, M=3, E=4, R=5, O=6, S=7, I=8, T=9, Y=0. The code is located either on a silver label inside the cord storage compartment or pressed into the plastic of the bottom-mounted cord wrap.

==In popular culture==
The Kodak Carousel slide projector was part of the plot of the 2007 episode &quot;The Wheel&quot; in season 1 of the TV series &quot;Mad Men&quot;. In the episode, the advertising agency comes up with the name &quot;Carousel&quot;, in place of the Kodak executives&#x27; name for it, &quot;The Wheel&quot;, pitching the device as a nostalgic conveyance that let its viewers travel through their memories as a child would, &quot;around and around and back home again to a place where we know we are loved&quot;. In reality Kodak&#x27;s advertising at the time concentrated on the features of the device.

<text>Nipton is an unincorporated community in the Ivanpah Valley in San Bernardino County, California. With a population of about 15 – 20, it is located on the northeastern border of Mojave National Preserve, approximately southeast of Primm, Nevada and the Ivanpah Solar Power Facility. It is accessible via Nevada State Route 164 (also known as Nipton Road).

==History==
A mining camp was established here at the crossroads of two wagon trails. The town was founded on February 9, 1905, with the coming of the first train on the newly constructed San Pedro, Los Angeles &amp; Salt Lake Railroad. It was called &quot;Nippeno Camp&quot; following a nearby discovery of gold. The name was changed to Nipton when the San Pedro, Los Angeles &amp; Salt Lake Railroad merged with the Union Pacific Railroad around 1910. In addition to being a cattle-loading station for several local ranches, the town and depot also supplied numerous mines in the area, becoming a social center for the sparse population of the region.

On April 10, 1940, President Roosevelt approved transferring title of Nipton to Harry Trehearne under the Homestead Act. It stayed in the family’s hands until 1956, when it passed to six owners.

In 1985 Gerald &quot;Jerry&quot; Freeman and Roxanne Lang purchased Nipton for about $200,000. They restored the cafe and five-room hotel and planted a grove of eucalyptus trees. When Freeman&#x27;s health deteriorated in 2016, they put the town up for sale.

In September 2017, Nipton was purchased by American Green Inc., for US$5 million with plans to turn the town into a cannabis tourism destination. The CEO of the company hoped to make this into the first &quot;Pot Town, USA&quot;. American Green Inc. sold the town in March 2018 after failing to attract the capital investment necessary to continue the project. The town was sold to Delta International Oil &amp; Gas for a total of $7.7 million in debt assumption and Delta preferred stock, along with a provision that it continue with the project to transform the town on the edge of the Mojave Desert into a cannabis-themed resort. The town was listed for sale again in November 2020 for $2.75 million.

In January 2023, Nipton was purchased by Spiegelworld, an American theater company, for $2.5 million. Spiegelworld has stated that Nipton will become their new base of operations and will become a place &quot;where Spiegelworld artists and performers will retreat to dream, create and undertake unfettered artistic experimentation.&quot;

==Townsite==
A five-room adobe hotel was built in the Mexican Territorial style in 1910. The town also has a general store, a trading post, the Whistle Stop Cafe, a RV park, five eco-cabins, and ten sites with teepees on them. There is also a historic schoolhouse and art exhibits connected to the Burning Man event.

==Climate==
The area receives significant sunshine year round due to its stable descending air and high pressure. According to the Köppen Climate Classification system, Nipton has a hot desert climate, abbreviated &quot;Bwh&quot; on climate maps.

== In popular culture ==
Nipton appears as a town in the 2010 video game &quot;,&quot; burned and ransacked by the in-game Caesar&#x27;s Legion faction.

<doc id="748976" wikidata="Q76889" url="?curid=748976" title="Ernst Heinrich Weber">
<text>Ernst Heinrich Weber (24 June 1795 – 26 January 1878) was a German physician who is considered one of the founders of experimental psychology. He was an influential and important figure in the areas of physiology and psychology during his lifetime and beyond. His studies on sensation and touch, along with his emphasis on good experimental techniques led to new directions and areas of study for future psychologists, physiologists, and anatomists.

Ernst Weber was born into an academic background, with his father serving as a professor at the University of Wittenberg. Weber became a doctor, specializing in anatomy and physiology. Two of his younger brothers, Wilhelm and Eduard, were also influential in academia, both as scientists with one specializing in physics and the other in anatomy. Ernst became a lecturer and a professor at the University of Leipzig and stayed there until his retirement.

==Early life and education==
Ernst Heinrich Weber was born on 24 June 1795 in Wittenberg, Saxony, Holy Roman Empire. He was son to Michael Weber, a professor of theology at the University of Wittenberg. At a young age, Weber became interested in physics and the sciences after being heavily influenced by Ernst Chladni, a physicist often referred to as the “father of acoustics”. Weber completed secondary school at Meissen and began studying medicine at the University of Wittenberg in 1811. He went on to receive his MD in 1815 from the University of Halle.

==University career==
Weber spent his entire academic career at the University of Leipzig. He completed his &quot;Habilitation&quot; in 1817 and became an assistant in J.C. Clarus’ medical clinic in the same year. He became professor of comparative anatomy in 1818 and chair of human anatomy at the university in 1821. Ernst Weber’s first direct contribution to psychology came in 1834 when trying to describe the sensation of touch (&quot;De Pulsu, Resorptione, Auditu et Tactu&quot;. Leipzig 1834). He was professor of physiology and anatomy from 1840 to 1866, and returned to the position of professor of anatomy from 1866 to 1871.

In his later life, Weber became less involved in testing and experimenting, although he was still interested in sensory physiology. Ernst Heinrich Weber retired from the University of Leipzig in 1871. He continued to work with his brother, Eduard and their work with nerve stimulation and muscle suppression lead to inhibitory responses as a popular therapy of the time. Ernst Weber died in 1878 in Leipzig, Germany.

==Contributions==
=== Just-Noticeable Difference ===

Weber described the just-noticeable difference or jnd as follows: “in observing the disparity between things that are compared, we perceive not the difference between the things, but the ratio of this difference to the magnitude of things compared.” In other words, we are able to distinguish the relative difference, not the absolute difference between items. Or, we can distinguish between stimuli having a constant ratio, not a constant difference. This ratio is known as the Weber fraction. Weber’s first work with the jnd had to do with differences in weight. He stated that the jnd is the &quot;minimum amount of difference between two weights necessary to tell them apart&quot;. He found that the finest discrimination between weights was when they differed by 8–10%. For example, if you were holding a 100 g block, the second block would need to weigh at least 108 g in order to be distinguishable. Weber also suspected that a constant fraction applied for all senses, but is different for each sense. When comparing the differences in line length, there must be at least 0.01 difference in order to distinguish the two. When comparing music pitch, there must be at least 0.006 vibrations per second difference. So for every sense, some increase in intensity is needed in order to tell a difference.

=== Weber&#x27;s Law ===
Weber’s Law, as labeled by Gustav Theodor Fechner, established that sensory events can be related mathematically to measurable relative changes in physical stimulus values.
:formula_1
::formula_2: amount of stimulation that needs to be added to produce a jnd
::formula_3: amount of existing stimulation (formula_3 from the German &quot;&quot;, meaning stimulus)
::formula_5: constant (different for each sense)

Weber’s law is invalid when the stimulus approaches the upper or lower limits of a sensory modality. Fechner took inspiration from Weber’s Law and developed what we know today as Fechner’s Law, claiming that there was a logarithmic relation between stimulus intensity and perceived intensity. Fechner’s Law was more advanced than Weber&#x27;s Law, partly because Fechner had developed new methods for measuring just-noticeable differences in different sense modalities, making the measured results more accurate.

=== Experimental Psychology ===

For most of his career, Weber worked with his brothers, Wilhelm and Eduard, and partner Gustav Theodor Fechner. Throughout these working relationships, Weber completed research on the central nervous system, auditory system, anatomy and function of brain, circulation, etc., and a large portion of research on sensory physiology and psychology. The following items are part of Weber’s contributions the experimental psychology:

==== Experimental Wave Theory ====

Studied flow and movement of waves in liquids and elastic tubes.

==== Hydrodynamics ====

Weber discovered laws and applied them to circulation. In 1821, Weber launched a series of experiments on the physics of fluids with his younger brother Wilhelm. This research was the first detailed account of hydrodynamic principles in the circulation of blood. Weber continued his research on blood and in 1827, he made another significant finding. Weber explained the elasticity of blood vessels in the movement of blood in the aorta in a continuous flow to the capillaries and arterioles.

==== Two-point Threshold Technique ====

This technique helped map sensitivity and touch acuity on the body using compass technique. Points of a compass would be set at varying distances in order to see at what distance are the points of the compass perceived as two separate points instead of one single point. Weber also wrote about and tested other ideas on sensation including a terminal threshold, which is the highest intensity an individual could sense before the sensation could not be detected any longer.

==== Weber’s Illusion ====

Weber’s Illusion is an &quot;experience of divergence of two points when stimulation is moved over insensitive areas and convergence of two points when moved over sensitive areas&quot;.
Weber’s use of multivariate experiment, precise measurements, and research on sensory psychology and sensory physiology laid the groundwork for accepting experimental psychology as a field and providing new ideas for fellow 19th century psychologists to expand.

==Publications==

Weber&#x27;s work on the tactile senses was published in Latin as &quot;De Subtilitate Tactus&quot; (1834), and in German as &quot;Der Tastsinn und das Gemeingefühl&quot; in 1846. Both works were translated into English by Ross and Murray as &quot;E.H.Weber: The Sense of Touch&quot; (Academic Press, 1978) and reprinted as &quot;E.H.Weber on the Tactile Senses&quot; (Erlbaum, Taylor &amp; Francis, 1996). Weber proposed there was a threshold of sensation in each individual. The two-point threshold, the smallest distance between two points where a person determines that it is two points and not one, was Weber’s first discovery.

Weber’s work made a significant impact on the field of experimental psychology, as he was one of the first scientist to test his ideas on humans. His meticulous notes and new ideas of testing subjects described in his book &quot;Der tastsinn und das gemeingefühl&quot; (English: &quot;The sense of touch and the common sensibility&quot;) led E. B. Titchener to call the work &quot;the foundation stone of experimental psychology&quot;.
The book that described blood circulation research, &quot;Wellenlehre, auf Experimenten gegrϋndet&quot; (English: &quot;Wave Theory, Founded on Experiments&quot;) became instantly recognized as very important to physics and physiology. This research lead the way for future investigating, although it was not formally published until 1850 with the culmination of the rest of his research on blood in a book entitled, &quot;Ueber die Anwendung der Wellenlehre auf die Lehre vom Kreislauf des Blutes und insbesondere auf die Pulslehre&quot; (English: &quot;Concerning the application of the wave theory to the theory of the circulation of the blood and, in particular, on the pulse teaching&quot;).

* &quot;Tractatus de motu iridis&quot; (1821)
* &quot;Wellenlehre auf Experimente gegründet&quot; (1825)

* &quot;Zusätze zur Lehre vom Bau und von der Verrichtung der Geschlechtsorgane&quot; (1846)
* &quot;Die Lehre vom Tastsinn und Gemeingefühl&quot; (1851)
* &quot;Annotationes anatomicae et physiologicae&quot; (1851)

==Legacy and influence==
Weber is often cited as the pioneer or father of experimental psychology. He was the first to conduct true psychological experiments that held validity. While most psychologists of the time conducted work from behind a desk, Weber was actively conducting experiments, manipulating only one variable at a time in order to gain more accurate results. This paved the way for the field of psychology as an experimental science and opened the way for the development of even more accurate and intense research methods.
One of Weber’s greatest influences was on Gustav Fechner. Weber was appointed the Dozent of Psychology at the University of Leipzig the same year that Fechner enrolled. Weber’s work with sensation inspired Fechner to further the work and go on to develop Weber’s law. At the time of his sensation work, Weber did not fully realize the implications that his experiments would have on understanding of sensory stimulus and response.

<text>Fairfield Halls is an arts, entertainment and conference centre in Croydon, London, England, which opened in 1962 and contains a theatre and gallery, and a large concert hall regularly used for BBC television, radio and orchestral recordings. Fairfield Halls closed for a £30 million redevelopment in 2016, and reopened in 2019. As part of the building&#x27;s re-opening Talawa Theatre Company relocated to the building, taking up a 200-seat theatre space and offices.

Although the venue has been a major venue for professional music, plays, musicals, stand-up comedy and classical music, a significant proportion of Fairfield&#x27;s programme has been for community events. It was frequently used by local schools as the venue for their annual choral concerts, as well as being regularly used by local music, opera, amateur dramatic and religious organisations. The Concert Hall features a cinema with Croydon&#x27;s largest cinema screen.

In 2021, Fairfield Halls was used as a mass vaccination centre as part of the COVID-19 vaccination in the United Kingdom.

==History==
The halls are built on the site of Croydon&#x27;s historic &quot;Fair Field&quot;, which hosted a well-known fair up until around 1860, and above disused railway cuttings which used to link the main London to Brighton railway to Croydon Central Station in what is now Queen&#x27;s Gardens. Between 1930 and 1962 the land was home to both a car park and air raid shelters during the war.

The venue was 50 years old in 2012 and an anniversary concert by the London Mozart Players was attended by the Earl of Wessex. A website was also launched to celebrate both the venue&#x27;s history and to act as an ongoing archive, containing 2,000 digitised images accessed via text and keyword searches. This makes it one of the largest digitised venue archives in Europe.

In the summer of 2014 the council paid for the refurbishment of the Arnhem Gallery, the conversion of the former Green Room into the New Studio and the installation of modern digital projection equipment with Dolby Surround 7.1 in the Concert Hall.

Fairfield was run from 1993 to 2016 by a self-financing charity with a board of trustees. The charity was in receipt of an operating grant from Croydon Council; it was placed into administration in July 2016.

===2016 redevelopment===
Croydon Council, the freeholder of the land, had various plans to refurbish Fairfield over the years but none of these plans came to fruition. In the spring of 2015 a new set of consultants led by Croydon firm Mott MacDonald was appointed by Croydon Council to deliver a £12m programme on the Fairfield Halls and a separate programme for the remainder of the College Green site. Around £30m would be spent on redeveloping and modernising Fairfield Halls in the period between 2016 and 2018.

In February 2016, it was confirmed that the venue would close for two years for redevelopment starting July 2016 as part of the Croydon council&#x27;s plan for the cultural and educational quarter in the town centre, with new homes, offices, shops and a building for Croydon College being constructed. The opening was postponed a few times. The cost of the project increased substantially and not all parts of the project were completed. It reopened on 16 September 2019 for six months, but closed again due to the Covid pandemic until 2021.

==As a venue==

The building&#x27;s concert hall has 1,801 seats (counting the choir stalls), the Ashcroft Theatre has 755, and the Arnhem Gallery is used for standing concerts of up to 400.

Many famous acts have performed at the Fairfield Halls, including David Bowie, Kraftwerk, Elton John, the Beatles, Pink Floyd, Stevie Wonder, the Who, Queen, Sister Sledge, Morrissey, Status Quo, Free, Genesis, Petula Clark, Mott the Hoople, Wishbone Ash, The Stranglers and Shane Filan of Westlife. Delaney &amp; Bonnie &amp; Friends recorded their live album &quot;On Tour with Eric Clapton&quot; in the halls, with a band that also featured George Harrison. 

The Nice recorded most of their album &quot;Five Bridges&quot; live at the concert hall on 17 February 1969, with King Crimson as their opening act for the concert. Family performed there in July 1970 and recorded their concert, eventually releasing recordings of three previously unavailable songs and a non-album single from that concert on their November 1970 album &quot;Anyway&quot;. Free recorded part of their album &quot;Free Live!&quot; at the venue on 13 September 1970. Rat Scabies and Captain Sensible of the Damned both worked as toilet cleaners at Fairfield Halls, Captain Sensible remarking that he was inspired to take music more seriously after witnessing a T. Rex concert there. Sensible referenced his employment at the venue in his song &quot;Croydon&quot;. Morecambe and Wise&#x27;s appearance at the halls in 1973 was filmed, the only time that their live stage act was recorded. In March 1980, the halls hosted the inaugural concert of the Salvation Army&#x27;s International Staff Songsters.

Fairfield Halls was also used for British professional wrestling for many years, with various cards having been featured on ITV&#x27;s &quot;World of Sport&quot; in the 1970s and 1980s and the second season (1987-1988) of the later standalone &quot;Wrestling&quot; show. In particular All Star Wrestling treated the venue as a showcase location for major cards from 1985 to the mid 2010s. A pilot episode of &quot;World of Sport Wrestling&quot; was filmed there in 2013. The stage was mechanically lowered to floor level especially for wrestling shows with extra rigside seating places on the stage around three sides of the ring. This was stored in the corridors leading to the front row entrances when the venue was not in wrestling mode. Fairfield has featured as a location in many films, TV productions and commercials. It was featured in the opening titles of the BBC sitcom &quot;Terry and June&quot;.

Fairfield Halls is also notable for being the location of a Tangerine Dream concert on 31 October 1982, only a week before the recording of their live album, &quot;Logos Live&quot;. It was also the venue for Part 2 of their 1975 live/studio album &quot;Ricochet&quot;.

==In cinema==
Fairfield&#x27;s concert hall appeared briefly in the film &quot;The Da Vinci Code&quot; as the location of Robert Langdon&#x27;s speech to students. The venue also featured in the films &quot;Made in Dagenham&quot; and &quot;Cuban Fury&quot;.

<text>The , the , is a long motorsport race track located in Ino, Suzuka City, Mie Prefecture, Japan and operated by Honda Mobilityland, a subsidiary of Honda Motor Co, Ltd. It has a capacity of 155,000.

==Introduction==

Soichiro Honda decided to develop a new permanent circuit in Mie prefecture in the late 1950s. Designed as a Honda test track in 1962 by Dutchman John &quot;Hans&quot; Hugenholtz, the track has a figure-of-eight layout, with the long back straight passing over the front section by means of an overpass. It is the only FIA Grade 1 licensed track to have such a layout, after the Fiorano Circuit was downgraded to Grade 2 in 2024.

The circuit has been modified at least eight times:

In 1983 a chicane was inserted at the last curve to slow the cars into the pit straight; the original circuit was an extremely fast track with only one slow corner; without the Casio chicane some cars would go through the final long right-hand corner flat out and then would go past the pits at more than . In 1984 the first part of Spoon was made slightly slower and the corner was brought closer to the track to expand run-off area there, and in 1985 the first corner was made slightly slower.

In 1987 the circuit was brought up to F1 and Grand Prix motorcycle standards for both Japanese Grands Prix of their respective championships, the F1 Grand Prix being the first held at Suzuka. The Degner curve was made into two corners instead of one long curve, and more crash barriers, more run-off areas were added, exposed vegetation was barricaded off and straw bales were removed (but still used for the Japanese motorcycle Grand Prix).

In 2002, the chicane was slightly modified, 130R (marked as 15 on the diagram) was also modified and some of the snake curves were made a bit straighter and faster; additionally, the runoff area at the Dunlop Curve was doubled from 12 metres to 25 metres, and the corner itself was made slightly tighter.

In 2003, the chicane was made slightly faster and closer to the 130R.

Following the death of Daijiro Kato at the 2003 Japanese motorcycle Grand Prix, Suzuka reconfigured the motorcycle variant of what is now known as the Hitachi Automotive Systems Chicane before the final turn, and added a second chicane, between the hairpin and 200R.

The circuit can be used in five configurations; the car full circuit, the motorcycle full circuit, the &quot;Suzuka east,&quot; &quot;Suzuka west car,&quot; and &quot;Suzuka west motorcycle&quot; configurations. The &quot;east&quot; portion of the course consists of the pit straight to the first half of the Dunlop curve (turn seven), before leading back to the pit straight via a tight right-hander. The &quot;west&quot; course is made up of the other part of the full circuit, including the crossover bridge; the straight leading to the overpass is used for the start/finish line and the grid. The chicane between the hairpin and 200R separates the west and full course sections between cars and motorcycles.

The Degner curve was named in honour of Ernst Degner after he crashed his factory Suzuki 50 there during Suzuka&#x27;s inaugural All Japan Championship Road Race meeting on 3 November 1962.

At the 2014 Japanese Grand Prix, F1 driver Jules Bianchi suffered serious injuries after colliding with a recovery vehicle, and died in hospital as a result nine months later. In the wake of the accident, the &quot;Dunlop&quot; corner was slightly changed and revised in safety standards, and the organisers of the Japanese Grand Prix installed a large crane in place of the tractor that Bianchi hit.

==Motorsport events==

Suzuka, openly touted by F1 drivers and fans as one of the most enjoyed, is also one of the oldest remaining tracks of the Formula One World Championship, and has a long history of races as venue of the Japanese Grand Prix since 1987. Its traditional role as one of the last Grands Prix of the season means numerous world championships have been decided at the track. Four years consecutively in its early history the circuit saw the world championship decided. These include the 1988 championship, which went to Ayrton Senna, the controversial 1989 championship, which went to Alain Prost, and the 1990 and 1991 world championships, which both went to Senna.

Suzuka was dropped from the Formula One calendar for the and seasons in favour of the Toyota-owned Fuji Speedway, after the latter underwent a transformation and redesign by circuit designer Hermann Tilke. Suzuka and Fuji were to alternate hosting the Japanese Grand Prix from 2009. However, after Fuji announced in July 2009 that it would no longer be part of the F1 calendar, Suzuka signed a deal to host the Japanese Grand Prix in , and .

The circuit closed for a year for renovations to make it F1-compliant for 2009, with the last major event held on November 18, 2007, although some annual events (for example, the Suzuka 8 Hours and Suzuka 1000 km) were still held. The track held a re-opening day on April 12, 2009.

Suzuka also hosts other motorsport events including the Suzuka 1000 km endurance race. Previously a part of multiple GT racing series including the now defunct group C class of the All Japan Sports Prototype Championship, the Suzuka 1000 km as of 2006 is now a points round of the Super GT Series, and is the only race of such length in that series. In 2010, the GT500 pole position time was 1:55.237. In 2007, the GT300 pole position time was 2:06.838.

Another major motorsport event is the Suzuka 8 Hours for motorcycles, which has been run since 1978. This event usually attracts big name riders and with the exception of 2005, due to the importance of the major manufacturers&#x27; involvement, the FIM ensures that no motorcycle races clash on the date.

NASCAR organized the NASCAR Thunder 100, a pair of exhibition 100-lap races on the east circuit, a layout which utilizes the pit straight and esses, before rejoining the main circuit near the Casio triangle. The cars were Sprint Cup Series and Camping World West Series cars and the field was by invitation for the two races, run after the 1996 and 1997 seasons. The 1996 event was marred by tragedy when during practice, pace car driver Elmo Langley died of a heart attack in the Chevrolet Corvette pace car at the esses during an evaluation run. The pole position speed was . During qualifying for the 1997 race, rain caused Goodyear to use rain tires on Winston Cup cars for the first time in the modern era.

It was announced on June 21, 2010, that the east section of the Suzuka Circuit would host the Japan round of the 2011 WTCC season instead of the Okayama International Circuit. At the 2012 event, the pole position time was 52.885 seconds, for an average speed of .

== 130R corner ==
Following two major accidents in 2002 and 2003, one of the main issues in safety has been at the corner 130R (marked 15 in the track map above). In 2002, Toyota F1 driver Allan McNish suffered a high-speed crash through the bump, which sent him through a metal fence; he was not seriously injured.

Track officials revised the 130R, redesigning it as a double-apex section, one with an radius, and then a second featuring a radius, leading to a much closer Casio triangle (chicane), with the chicane becoming a &quot;bus stop&quot; type for motorcycles.

However, the problem continued for the new revised section. During the 2003 MotoGP Grand Prix of Japan, the track&#x27;s first major event since the revisions, MotoGP rider Daijiro Kato was killed when he crashed in the new section, on his way to the braking zone for the Casio triangle. MotoGP has not returned to Suzuka since the incident.

== In video games ==
Along with Fuji Speedway, the Suzuka Circuit was one of the four tracks featured in the video game &quot;Pole Position II&quot;. The track is referred to in the &quot;Namco Museum&quot; versions of the game as the &quot;Wonder Circuit&quot; (&quot;Orange Circuit&quot; in &quot;Namco Museum: Virtual Arcade&quot;), after Namco&#x27;s &quot;Wonder&quot; series of amusement parks, despite its logo appearing on the starter&#x27;s box since 1983.

The Suzuka Circuit is also featured in the &quot;Final Lap&quot; series of games which first appeared in 1987. Another Namco racing game, &quot;Suzuka 8 Hours&quot;, based on the motorcycle race of the same name was released for arcades in 1992, followed by a port for the Super NES in 1993. It can also be seen in arcade games and video games such as &quot;Ferrari F355 Challenge&quot;, &quot;Super Monaco GP&quot;, &quot;Forza&quot; series, &quot;Gran Turismo&quot; series, &quot;RaceRoom&quot;, &quot;iRacing&quot;, &quot;&quot;, &quot;Shift 2 Unleashed&quot;, &quot;Le Mans 24 Hours&quot;, &quot;The Cycles&quot;, &quot;MotoGP 3 of PlayStation 2&quot;, &quot;MotoGP 4&quot;, &quot;Tourist Trophy&quot;, &quot;Auto Modellista&quot;, &quot;Racing Battle: C1 Grand Prix&quot;, &quot;Real Racing 3&quot;, and as the final race in Taito&#x27;s racing game &quot;Continental Circus&quot;. The east course was featured in &quot;NASCAR 98&quot;. Suzuka&#x27;s Ferris wheel was paid homage in the &quot;Big Forest Track&quot; in &quot;Virtua Racing&quot;. The track has been modded into &quot;Mario Kart Wii&quot;.

&quot;Project CARS&quot; and &quot;Project CARS 2&quot; have a Japanese circuit inspired by Suzuka, called &quot;Sakitto Circuit&quot;. Sakitto has numerous visual differences from the original Suzuka, including the change of position of the Ferris wheel near to Degner curves, as well as the absence of the Casio triangle and the hairpin, a very modified esses section, and a road pass through the real life location of the Ferris wheel.

<text>Talakaveri or Talacauvery is the place that is generally considered to be the source of the river Kaveri and a holy place for many Hindus. It is located on Brahmagiri hills near Bhagamandala in Kodagu district (Coorg), in the South Indian state of Karnataka. It is located close to the border with Kasaragod district, Kerala. Talakaveri stands at a height of 1,276 meters above sea level. Despite its traditional status as the source of the Kaveri, there is no permanent visible flow from this place to the main rivercourse, except during the monsoon rains.

A tank or is erected on a hillside, at the place that is said to be the river&#x27;s origin. It is also marked by a small temple, and the area is frequented by pilgrims. The river originates as a spring feeding this tank, which is considered to be a holy place to bathe on special days. The waters are then said to flow underground to emerge as the Kaveri river some distance away. The temple has been renovated extensively, most recently in 2007 by the state government.

On &quot;Kaveri sankramana&quot; (colloquially &quot;changrandi&quot;) day, the first day of &quot;Tula Masa&quot; month of the Hindu calendar, which normally falls in mid-October, thousands of pilgrims from neighboring flock to the river&#x27;s birthplace to witness the rise of the fountainhead, when water gushes up from the spring at a predetermined moment. The day is observed across pilgrim towns on the Kaveri&#x27;s banks.

Talakaveri is about away from Bhagamandala, from Panathur (Kerala) and from Madikeri, the headquarters of Kodagu district.

==Pilgrim center==
The temple here is dedicated to Goddess Kaveramma. Other deities worshipped here are Lord Agasthiswara, which denotes the link between Kaveri and Sage Agasthya.

The link between Kaveri and Lord Ganesha extends to Srirangam, in Lord Ganesha&#x27;s role in setting up the Ranganatha temple there.

The temple at Tirumakudalu Narasipura (confluence of Kabini, Kaveri and the legendary Spatika Sarovara)) is also dedicated to Agasthiwara.

== History of the temple priests of Talakaveri ==

It is believed that Mayura Varma, and the Kadamba king Narasimman, who ruled vast areas of southern and central India in the 4th Century A.D., brought Brahmins from Ahi Kshetra and put them in charge of various temples in Tulu Nadu.

The Brahmins who first landed in Shivalli in Tulunadu and then spread across 31 villages came to be known as Shivalli Brahmins or Tulu Brahmins. It is from Shivalli and Tulu Brahmins, that the priests of Talakaveri temple have come from.

== Achar Family of Talakaveri ==
The beginning of the Achar family in Talakaveri starts ten generations or about 220 to 240 years ago. A Brahmin named Venkappayya and his two brothers, along with their families came to Talakaveri on a pilgrimage. Lingaraja the First was the ruler of Kodagu from 1780 to 1790 AD. One night God appeared in Lingaraja&#x27;s dream and indicated that there was a Brahmin family currently visiting Talakaveri. God commanded Lingaraja to appoint this Brahmin to be the priest at the temple. After the king arose from his dream, he sent for this Brahmin family. The king&#x27;s messengers found Venkappayya in Talakaveri and informed him about the king&#x27;s desire. Venkappayya accompanied the king&#x27;s messengers from Talakaveri to Madikeri, a distance of about 24 miles to meet the king. 

Lingaraja received Venkappayya and requested him to start daily puja at the temple. The king set up an endowment to pay Venkappayya for his services at the temple. This was the beginning of the Achar family of Talacauvery. The priesthood bestowed by Lingaraja upon Venkappayya has passed on through many generations to his heirs. It is hereditary as most priesthoods are, and all male members of the family have the birthright to become priests at the temple. The current Achars are the ninth generation from Venkappayya.

Venkappayya came from Shivalli Halli (village) of South Canara district. The Brahmins here were called Putturayas, probably meaning priests from Puttur. This Puttur is near Udupi. Venkappayya Putturaya&#x27;s descendants are the Achars. It is not known why the descendants of Venkappayya took on the surname of Achar. Although Venkappayya came to Talakaveri with his two brothers, only Venkappayya&#x27;s descendants are documented.

From there, one can have a 360 degree view of the surrounding hills. The nearest International Airport is in Kannur at a distance of ,The nearest Railway station is in Kanhangad kerala at a distance of .

<text>George James Webb (June 24, 1803 - October 7, 1887) was an English-born American composer, conductor, music educator, and organist. He was known for writing &quot;Stand Up, Stand Up for Jesus&quot;. Webb composed the hymn-tune known as &quot;Webb&quot; whilst sailing from England to the United States: the tune is also known as &quot;Morning Light&quot;.

==Life and career==
George James Webb was born in Salisbury, Wiltshire, England on June 24, 1803. He trained as a musician in his native city under Alexander Lucas, and began his career as an organist in Falmouth, Cornwall. In 1830 he resigned his post and immigrated to the United States where he initially settled in Boston, Massachusetts as the organist at Old South Church.

In Boston, Webb taught on the faculty of the Boston Academy of Music where he was conductor of the school&#x27;s orchestra. He also worked as conductor of both the Handel and Haydn Society and The Musical Fund Society. He became a protege of Lowell Mason, and collaborated with him on a variety of music, education, and publication projects; including co-editing music periodicals together and building choral collections together. Webb&#x27;s daughter married Mason&#x27;s son, the composer William Mason. 

In 1870 Webb moved to Orange, New Jersey where he lived until his death in that city on October 7, 1887. He spent his final years teaching in New York City, and is buried in Orange at Rosedale Cemetery.

The venue, which forms part of the 19th-century Town Hall, was opened as an arts and museum complex by Queen Elizabeth II in 1994. A notable early success was the Picasso exhibition in March to May 1995 named &quot;Picasso&#x27;s Croydon Period&quot;.

The venue contains the Museum of Croydon, Clocktower Café and the Croydon Central Library. Other facilities which can be accessed from Croydon Clocktower include the David Lean Cinema, which offers a regular programme of art house and independent films, and the Braithwaite Hall, which is used for concerts, theatre and children&#x27;s shows.

<text>A current source is an electronic circuit that delivers or absorbs an electric current which is independent of the voltage across it.

A current source is the dual of a voltage source. The term &quot;current sink&quot; is sometimes used for sources fed from a negative voltage supply. Figure 1 shows the schematic symbol for an ideal current source driving a resistive load. There are two types. An &quot;independent current source&quot; (or sink) delivers a constant current. A &quot;dependent current source&quot; delivers a current which is proportional to some other voltage or current in the circuit.

An ideal current source generates a current that is independent of the voltage changes across it. An ideal current source is a mathematical model, which real devices can approach very closely. If the current through an ideal current source can be specified independently of any other variable in a circuit, it is called an &quot;independent&quot; current source. Conversely, if the current through an ideal current source is determined by some other voltage or current in a circuit, it is called a dependent or controlled current source. Symbols for these sources are shown in Figure 2.

The internal resistance of an ideal current source is infinite. An independent current source with zero current is identical to an ideal open circuit. The voltage across an ideal current source is completely determined by the circuit it is connected to. When connected to a short circuit, there is zero voltage and thus zero power delivered. When connected to a load resistance, the current source manages the voltage in such a way as to keep the current constant; so in an ideal current source the voltage across the source approaches infinity as the load resistance approaches infinity (an open circuit).

No physical current source is ideal. For example, no physical current source can operate when applied to an open circuit. There are two characteristics that define a current source in real life. One is its internal resistance and the other is its compliance voltage. The compliance voltage is the maximum voltage that the current source can supply to a load. Over a given load range, it is possible for some types of real current sources to exhibit nearly infinite internal resistance. However, when the current source reaches its compliance voltage, it abruptly stops being a current source.

In circuit analysis, a current source having finite internal resistance is modeled by placing the value of that resistance across an ideal current source (the Norton equivalent circuit). However, this model is only useful when a current source is operating within its compliance voltage.

==Implementations==

===Passive current source===
The simplest non-ideal current source consists of a voltage source in series with a resistor. The amount of current available from such a source is given by the ratio of the voltage across the voltage source to the resistance of the resistor (Ohm&#x27;s law; ). This value of current will only be delivered to a load with zero voltage drop across its terminals (a short circuit, an uncharged capacitor, a charged inductor, a virtual ground circuit, etc.) The current delivered to a load with nonzero voltage (drop) across its terminals (a linear or nonlinear resistor with a finite resistance, a charged capacitor, an uncharged inductor, a voltage source, etc.) will always be different. It is given by the ratio of the voltage drop across the resistor (the difference between the exciting voltage and the voltage across the load) to its resistance.

For a nearly ideal current source, the value of the resistor should be very large but this implies that, for a specified current, the voltage source must be very large (in the limit as the resistance and the voltage go to infinity, the current source will become ideal and the current will not depend at all on the voltage across the load). Thus, efficiency is low (due to power loss in the resistor) and it is usually impractical to construct a &#x27;good&#x27; current source this way. Nonetheless, it is often the case that such a circuit will provide adequate performance when the specified current and load resistance are small. For example, a 5 V voltage source in series with a 4.7 kΩ resistor will provide an &quot;approximately&quot; constant current of to a load resistance in the range of 50 to 450 Ω.

A Van de Graaff generator is an example of such a high voltage current source. It behaves as an almost constant current source because of its very high output voltage coupled with its very high output resistance and so it supplies the same few microamperes at any output voltage up to hundreds of thousands of volts (or even tens of megavolts) for large laboratory versions.

===Active current sources without negative feedback===
In these circuits the output current is not monitored and controlled by means of negative feedback.

====Current-stable nonlinear implementation====
They are implemented by active electronic components (transistors) having current-stable nonlinear output characteristic when driven by steady input quantity (current or voltage). These circuits behave as dynamic resistors changing their present resistance to compensate current variations. For example, if the load increases its resistance, the transistor decreases its present output resistance (and &quot;vice versa&quot;) to keep up a constant total resistance in the circuit.

Active current sources have many important applications in electronic circuits. They are often used in place of ohmic resistors in analog integrated circuits (e.g., a differential amplifier) to generate a current that depends slightly on the voltage across the load.

The common emitter configuration driven by a constant input current or voltage and common source (common cathode) driven by a constant voltage naturally behave as current sources (or sinks) because the output impedance of these devices is naturally high. The output part of the simple current mirror is an example of such a current source widely used in integrated circuits. The common base, common gate and common grid configurations can serve as constant current sources as well.

A JFET can be made to act as a current source by tying its gate to its source. The current then flowing is the of the FET. These can be purchased with this connection already made and in this case the devices are called current regulator diodes or constant current diodes or current limiting diodes (CLD). Alternatively, an enhancement-mode N-channel MOSFET (metal–oxide–semiconductor field-effect transistor) could be used instead of a JFET in the circuits listed below for similar functionality.

====Following voltage implementation====
An example: bootstrapped current source.

====Voltage compensation implementation====
The simple resistor passive current source is ideal only when the voltage across it is zero; so voltage compensation by applying parallel negative feedback might be considered to improve the source. Operational amplifiers with feedback effectively work to minimise the voltage across their inputs. This results in making the inverting input a virtual ground, with the current running through the feedback, or load, and the passive current source. The input voltage source, the resistor, and the op-amp constitutes an &quot;ideal&quot; current source with value, . The transimpedance amplifier and an op-amp inverting amplifier are typical implementations of this idea.

The floating load is a serious disadvantage of this circuit solution.

====Current compensation implementation====
A typical example are Howland current source and its derivative Deboo integrator. In the last example (Fig. 1), the Howland current source consists of an input voltage source, , a positive resistor, R, a load (the capacitor, C, acting as impedance ) and a negative impedance converter INIC ( and the op-amp). The input voltage source and the resistor R constitute an imperfect current source passing current, through the load (Fig. 3 in the source). The INIC acts as a second current source passing &quot;helping&quot; current, , through the load. As a result, the total current flowing through the load is constant and the circuit impedance seen by the input source is increased. However the Howland current source isn&#x27;t widely used because it requires the four resistors to be perfectly matched, and its impedance drops at high frequencies.

The grounded load is an advantage of this circuit solution.

===Current sources with negative feedback===

They are implemented as a voltage follower with series negative feedback driven by a constant input voltage source (i.e., a &quot;negative feedback voltage stabilizer&quot;). The voltage follower is loaded by a constant (current sensing) resistor acting as a simple current-to-voltage converter connected in the feedback loop. The external load of this current source is connected somewhere in the path of the current supplying the current sensing resistor but out of the feedback loop.

The voltage follower adjusts its output current flowing through the load so that to make the voltage drop across the current sensing resistor R equal to the constant input voltage . Thus the voltage stabilizer keeps up a constant voltage drop across a constant resistor; so, a constant current flows through the resistor and respectively through the load.

If the input voltage varies, this arrangement will act as a voltage-to-current converter (voltage-controlled current source, VCCS); it can be thought as a reversed (by means of negative feedback) current-to-voltage converter. The resistance R determines the transfer ratio (transconductance).

Current sources implemented as circuits with series negative feedback have the disadvantage that the voltage drop across the current sensing resistor decreases the maximal voltage across the load (the &quot;compliance voltage&quot;).

====Simple transistor current sources====

=====Constant current diode=====

The simplest constant-current source or sink is formed from one component: a JFET with its gate attached to its source. Once the drain-source voltage reaches a certain minimum value, the JFET enters saturation where current is approximately constant. This configuration is known as a constant-current diode, as it behaves much like a dual to the constant voltage diode (Zener diode) used in simple voltage sources.

Due to the large variability in saturation current of JFETs, it is common to also include a source resistor (shown in the adjacent image) which allows the current to be tuned down to a desired value.

=====Zener diode current source=====
In this bipolar junction transistor (BJT) implementation (Figure 4) of the general idea above, a &quot;Zener voltage stabilizer&quot; (R1 and DZ1) drives an &quot;emitter follower&quot; (Q1) loaded by a &quot;constant emitter resistor&quot; (R2) sensing the load current. The external (floating) load of this current source is connected to the collector so that almost the same current flows through it and the emitter resistor (they can be thought of as connected in series). The transistor, Q1, adjusts the output (collector) current so as to keep the voltage drop across the constant emitter resistor, R2, almost equal to the relatively constant voltage drop across the Zener diode, DZ1. As a result, the output current is almost constant even if the load resistance and/or voltage vary. The operation of the circuit is considered in details below.

A Zener diode, when reverse biased (as shown in the circuit) has a constant voltage drop across it irrespective of the current flowing through it. Thus, as long as the Zener current () is above a certain level (called holding current), the voltage across the Zener diode () will be constant. Resistor, R1, supplies the Zener current and the base current () of NPN transistor (Q1). The constant Zener voltage is applied across the base of Q1 and emitter resistor, R2.

Voltage across () is given by , where is the base-emitter drop of Q1. The emitter current of Q1 which is also the current through R2 is given by
:formula_1

Since is constant and is also (approximately) constant for a given temperature, it follows that is constant and hence is also constant. Due to transistor action, emitter current, , is very nearly equal to the collector current, , of the transistor (which in turn, is the current through the load). Thus, the load current is constant (neglecting the output resistance of the transistor due to the Early effect) and the circuit operates as a constant current source. As long as the temperature remains constant (or doesn&#x27;t vary much), the load current will be independent of the supply voltage, R1 and the transistor&#x27;s gain. R2 allows the load current to be set at any desirable value and is calculated by
:formula_2

where is typically 0.65 V for a silicon device.

( is also the emitter current and is assumed to be the same as the collector or required load current, provided is sufficiently large). Resistance is calculated as
:formula_3

where = 1.2 to 2 (so that is low enough to ensure adequate ),
:formula_4

and is the lowest acceptable current gain for the particular transistor type being used.

=====LED current source=====
The Zener diode can be replaced by any other diode; e.g., a light-emitting diode LED1 as shown in Figure 5. The LED voltage drop () is now used to derive the constant voltage and also has the additional advantage of tracking (compensating) changes due to temperature. is calculated as
:formula_5

and as
:formula_6, where &quot;I&quot;D is the LED current

=====Transistor current source with diode compensation=====
Temperature changes will change the output current delivered by the circuit of Figure 4 because is sensitive to temperature. Temperature dependence can be compensated using the circuit of Figure 6 that includes a standard diode, D, (of the same semiconductor material as the transistor) in series with the Zener diode as shown in the image on the left. The diode drop () tracks the changes due to temperature and thus significantly counteracts temperature dependence of the CCS.

Resistance is now calculated as
:formula_7

Since ,
:formula_8

(In practice, is never exactly equal to and hence it only suppresses the change in rather than nulling it out.)

 is calculated as
:formula_9

(the compensating diode&#x27;s forward voltage drop, , appears in the equation and is typically 0.65 V for silicon devices.)

Note that this only works well if DZ1 is a reference diode or another stable voltage source. Together with &#x27;normal&#x27; Zener diodes especially with lower Zener voltages (&lt;5V) the diode might even worsen overall temperature dependency.

=====Current mirror with emitter degeneration=====
Series negative feedback is also used in the two-transistor current mirror with emitter degeneration. Negative feedback is a basic feature in some current mirrors using multiple transistors, such as the Widlar current source and the Wilson current source.

=====Constant current source with thermal compensation=====
One limitation with the circuits in Figures 5 and 6 is that the thermal compensation is imperfect. In bipolar transistors, as the junction temperature increases the drop (voltage drop from base to emitter) decreases. In the two previous circuits, a decrease in will cause an increase in voltage across the emitter resistor, which in turn will cause an increase in collector current drawn through the load. The end result is that the amount of &#x27;constant&#x27; current supplied is at least somewhat dependent on temperature. This effect is mitigated to a large extent, but not completely, by corresponding voltage drops for the diode, D1, in Figure 6, and the LED, LED1, in Figure 5. If the power dissipation in the active device of the CCS is not small and/or insufficient emitter degeneration is used, this can become a non-trivial issue.

Imagine in Figure 5, at power up, that the LED has 1 V across it driving the base of the transistor. At room temperature there is about 0.6 V drop across the junction and hence 0.4 V across the emitter resistor, giving an approximate collector (load) current of amps. Now imagine that the power dissipation in the transistor causes it to heat up. This causes the drop (which was 0.6 V at room temperature) to drop to, say, 0.2 V. Now the voltage across the emitter resistor is 0.8 V, twice what it was before the warmup. This means that the collector (load) current is now twice the design value! This is an extreme example of course, but serves to illustrate the issue.

The circuit to the left overcomes the thermal problem (see also, current limiting). To see how the circuit works, assume the voltage has just been applied at V+. Current runs through R1 to the base of Q1, turning it on and causing current to begin to flow through the load into the collector of Q1. This same load current then flows out of Q1&#x27;s emitter and consequently through to ground. When this current through to ground is sufficient to cause a voltage drop that is equal to the drop of Q2, Q2 begins to turn on. As Q2 turns on it pulls more current through its collector resistor, R1, which diverts some of the injected current in the base of Q1, causing Q1 to conduct less current through the load. This creates a negative feedback loop within the circuit, which keeps the voltage at Q1&#x27;s emitter almost exactly equal to the drop of Q2. Since Q2 is dissipating very little power compared to Q1 (since all the load current goes through Q1, not Q2), Q2 will not heat up any significant amount and the reference (current setting) voltage across will remain steady at ≈0.6 V, or one diode drop above ground, regardless of the thermal changes in the drop of Q1. The circuit is still sensitive to changes in the ambient temperature in which the device operates as the BE voltage drop in Q2 varies slightly with temperature.

====Op-amp current sources====
The simple transistor current source from Figure 4 can be improved by inserting the base-emitter junction of the transistor in the feedback loop of an op-amp (Figure 7). Now the op-amp increases its output voltage to compensate for the drop. The circuit is actually a buffered non-inverting amplifier driven by a constant input voltage. It keeps up this constant voltage across the constant sense resistor. As a result, the current flowing through the load is constant as well; it is exactly the Zener voltage divided by the sense resistor. The load can be connected either in the emitter (Figure 7) or in the collector (Figure 4) but in both the cases it is floating as in all the circuits above. The transistor is not needed if the required current doesn&#x27;t exceed the sourcing ability of the op-amp. The article on current mirror discusses another example of these so-called &quot;gain-boosted&quot; current mirrors.

====Voltage regulator current sources====
The general negative feedback arrangement can be implemented by an IC voltage regulator (LM317 voltage regulator on Figure 8). As with the bare emitter follower and the precise op-amp follower above, it keeps up a constant voltage drop (1.25 V) across a constant resistor (1.25 Ω); so, a constant current (1 A) flows through the resistor and the load. The LED is on when the voltage across the load exceeds 1.8 V (the indicator circuit introduces some error). The grounded load is an important advantage of this solution.

====Curpistor tubes====
Nitrogen-filled glass tubes with two electrodes and a calibrated Becquerel (decays per second) amount of 226Ra offer a constant number of charge carriers per second for conduction, which determines the maximum current the tube can pass over a voltage range from 25 to 500 V.

==Current and voltage source comparison==

Most sources of electrical energy (mains electricity, a battery, etc.) are best modeled as voltage sources, however some (notably solar cells) are better modeled using current sources. Sometimes it is easier to view a current source as a voltage source and vice versa (see conversion in Figure 9) using Norton&#x27;s and Thévenin&#x27;s theorems.

Voltage sources provide an almost-constant output voltage as long as the current drawn from the source is within the source&#x27;s capabilities. An ideal voltage source loaded by an open circuit (i.e., an infinite impedance) will provide no current (and hence no power). But when the load resistance approaches zero (a short circuit), the current (and thus power) approach infinity. Such a theoretical device has a zero ohm output impedance in series with the source. Real-world voltage sources instead have a non-zero output impedance, which is preferably very low (often much less than 1 ohm).

Conversely, a current source provides a constant current, as long as the impedance of the load is sufficiently lower than the current source&#x27;s parallel impedance (which is preferably very high and ideally infinite). In the case of transistor current sources, impedances of a few megohms (at low frequencies) are typical. Because power is current squared times resistance, as a load resistance connected to a current source approaches zero (a short circuit), the current and thus power both approach zero.

&quot;Ideal&quot; current sources don&#x27;t exist. Hypothetically connecting one to an &quot;ideal&quot; open circuit would create the paradox of running a constant, non-zero current (from the current source) through an element with a defined zero current (the open circuit). As the load resistance of an ideal current source approaches infinity (an open circuit), the voltage across the load would approach infinity (because voltage equals current times resistance), and hence the power drawn would also approach infinity. The current of a real current source connected to an open circuit would instead flow through the current source&#x27;s internal parallel impedance (and be wasted as heat).

Similarly, &quot;ideal&quot; voltage sources don&#x27;t exist. Hypothetically connecting one to an &quot;ideal&quot; short circuit would result a similar paradox of finite non-zero voltage across an element with defined zero voltage (the short circuit).

Just like how voltage sources should not be connected in parallel to another voltage source with different voltages, a current source also should not be connected in series to another current source. Note, some circuits use elements that are similar &quot;but not identical&quot; to voltage or current sources and may work when connected in these manners that are disallowed for actual current or voltage sources. Also, just like voltage sources may be connected in series to add their voltages, current sources may be connected in parallel to add their currents.

=== Charging a capacitor ===
Because the charge on a capacitor is equal to the integral of current with respect to time, an ideal constant current source charges a capacitor linearly with time, regardless of any series resistance. The Wilkinson analog-to-digital converter, for instance, uses this linear behavior to measure an unknown voltage by measuring the amount of time it takes a current source to charge a capacitor to that voltage. A voltage source instead charges a capacitor through a resistor non-linearly with time, because the charging current from the voltage source decreases exponentially with time.

<doc id="749018" wikidata="Q7653285" url="?curid=749018" title="Swami and Friends">
<text>Swami and Friends is a 1935 novel by R. K. Narayan, marking his debut as an English-language novelist from India. It is the first book in a trilogy set in the fictional town of Malgudi during British India. The novel is followed by &quot;The Bachelor of Arts&quot; and &quot;The English Teacher&quot;, completing the trilogy.

The novel follows a ten-year-old schoolboy, Swaminathan, and his attempts to court the favour of a much wealthier schoolboy, Rajam. &quot;Malgudi Schooldays&quot; is a slightly abridged version of &quot;Swami and Friends&quot;, and includes two additional stories featuring Swami from &quot;Malgudi Days&quot; and &quot;Under the Banyan Tree&quot; (1985).

== Summary ==
Swaminathan is a lazy schoolboy who lives with his father, mother, and grandmother in Malgudi. He attends the Albert Mission School with his friends Samuel, Sankar, Somu, and Mani. The arrival of a new student, Rajam—the son of a wealthy police superintendent—threatens Swami&#x27;s popularity. After an initial rivalry, Swami and Rajam reconcile and become friends.

A protest, part of Gandhi&#x27;s non-cooperative movement, erupts through the town. Swaminathan, participating in the protests, breaks the window of the headmaster&#x27;s room. Rajam&#x27;s father leads a violent crackdown of the protest. The next day, a distressed Swami runs away from the school after the headmaster vows to punish participating students. He is subsequently expelled from Albert Mission and is compelled to enroll in the stricter and more rigorous Board High School.

Rajam and Swaminathan start a cricket club, gathering friends together for practice after school, in which Swami is chronically tardy due to his relatively late-afternoon dismissal from Board High School. With a match scheduled, Swami pleads with his new headmaster to allow him to leave class early; he refuses. An undeterred Swami is caught committing truancy after asking a doctor to write a note of absence and is beaten and expelled by the headmaster.

Now expelled from two schools, and fearing his father&#x27;s wrath at home, Swami runs away from town. Becoming lost and hungry, Swami regrets his decision. Meanwhile, Swami&#x27;s father attempts to locate his missing son. Swami is discovered by a man carrying a cart who promptly contacts his parents. Swami&#x27;s relief at returning home turns to dismay when his friends report that they have lost their cricket game, and Rajam declares the end of their friendship.

One night, Mani informs Swami that Rajam and his family are relocating to another city. Swami wakes up early the next day to attempt to reconcile and bid his farewell to Rajam, gifting him a copy of Hans Christen Anderson&#x27;s &quot;Fairy Tales&quot;. He asks Rajam, as the train speeds away, if he would ever return, but his reply is drowned out by the sound of the locomotive. Swami weeps, wondering if Rajam would ever think of him again.

== Publication ==
&quot;Swami and Friends&quot; is the first novel written by Sir R. K Narayan. It was published through the intervention of a friend and neighbour, &quot;Kittu&quot; Purna, who was studying at Oxford. Through him, Graham Greene came into contact with Narayan&#x27;s work, became especially interested in it and took it upon himself to place the book with a reputable English publisher, Hamish Hamilton. Graham Greene was responsible for the title &quot;Swami and Friends&quot;, changing it from Narayan&#x27;s &quot;Swami, the Tate&quot;, suggesting that it would have the advantage of having some resemblance to Rudyard Kipling&#x27;s &quot;Stalky &amp; Co.&quot;

Greene arranged the details of the contract and remained closely involved until the novel was published. Narayan&#x27;s indebtedness to Greene is inscribed on the front endpaper of a copy of &quot;Swami and Friends&quot; Narayan presented to Greene: &quot;But for you, Swami should be in the bottom of Thames now&quot;.

<text>The Horniman Museum and Gardens is a museum in Forest Hill, London, England. Commissioned in 1898, it opened in 1901 and was designed by Charles Harrison Townsend in the Modern Style. It has displays of anthropology, natural history and musical instruments, and is known for its large collection of taxidermied animals. The building is Grade II* listed.

It is a non-departmental public body of the Department for Culture, Media and Sport and is constituted as a company and registered charity under English law. In 2022 the museum won Museum of the Year, an award made by the Art Fund.

== History ==
The museum was founded in 1901 by Frederick John Horniman. Frederick had inherited his father&#x27;s Horniman&#x27;s Tea business, which by 1891 had become the world&#x27;s biggest tea trading business.

The proceeds from the business allowed Horniman to indulge his lifelong passion for collecting, and which after travelling extensively had some 30,000 items in his various collections, covering natural history, cultural artefacts and musical instruments.

In 1911, an additional building to the west of the main building, originally containing a lecture hall and library, was donated by Frederick Horniman&#x27;s son Emslie Horniman. This was also designed by Townsend. A new extension, opened in 2002, was designed by Allies and Morrison.

In 2007, the museum held the Walking with Beasts Exhibition. The exhibition featured life-sized models of extinct animals featured in the BBC series of the same name, such as Smilodon and the Woolly Mammoth.

The museum won the Art Fund&#x27;s Museum of the Year award in 2022. In November 2022, the museum returned a collection of 72 items that were stolen from the Kingdom of Benin, including Benin Bronzes, to Nigeria&#x27;s National Commission for Museums and Monuments.

==Collections==
The Horniman specialises in anthropology, natural history and musical instruments and has a collection of 350,000 objects. The ethnography and music collections have Designated status. One of its most famous exhibits is the large collection of stuffed animals. It also has an aquarium noted for its .

The Horniman housed some of the Benin Bronzes until 28 November 2022, when they were signed back unconditionally to Nigeria, from where the pieces were looted in 1897 by British troops.

==Gardens==

The museum is set in of gardens, which include the following features:
* A Grade II listed conservatory from 1894 which was moved from Hornimans&#x27; family house in Croydon to the present site in the 1980s.
* A bandstand from 1912
* An enclosure for small animals
* A Butterfly House
* A nature trail
* An ornamental garden
* Plants for materials, medicines, and foods and dyes 
* A sound garden with large musical instruments for playing
* A new building, the Pavilion, for working on materials that are outside of the collections, such as from the gardens.
The gardens are also Grade II listed on the Register of Historic Parks and Gardens of Special Historic Interest in England.

===Mosaic===

On the London Road wall of the main building is a neoclassical mosaic mural entitled &quot;Humanity in the House of Circumstance&quot;, designed by Robert Anning Bell and assembled by a group of young women over the course of 210 days. Composed of more than 117,000 individual tesserae, it measures and symbolises personal aspirations and limitations.

The three figures on the far left represent Art, Poetry and Music, standing by a doorway symbolising birth, while the armed figure represents Endurance. The two kneeling figures represent Love and Hope, while the central figure symbolises Humanity. Charity stands to the right bearing figs and wine, followed by white-haired Wisdom holding a staff, and a seated figure representing Meditation. Finally, a figure symbolising Resignation stands by the right-hand doorway, which represents death.

===Totem pole===

A totem pole, carved from red cedar, stands outside the museum&#x27;s main entrance. It was carved in 1985 as part of the American Arts Festival by Nathan Jackson, a Tlingit native Alaskan. The carvings on the pole depict figures from Alaskan legend of a girl who married a bear, with an eagle (Jackson&#x27;s clan crest) at the top. The pole is one of only a handful of totem poles in the United Kingdom, others being on display at the British Museum, the National Museum of Scotland in Edinburgh, Windsor Great Park, Bushy Park, the Yorkshire Sculpture Park, the Pitt Rivers Museum at Oxford, and at Alsford&#x27;s Wharf in Berkhamsted. There is also a totem pole in the Royal Albert Memorial Museum in Exeter. It is displayed in their World Cultures galleries.

===CUE building===
The Horniman Museum contains the CUE (Centre for Understanding the Environment) building. This opened in 1996 and was designed by local architects Archetype using methods developed by Walter Segal. The building has a grass roof and was constructed from sustainable materials. It also incorporates passive ventilation.

<text>Mind Your Language is a British sitcom that premiered on ITV in 1977. It was produced by London Weekend Television and directed by Stuart Allen. Three series were made by London Weekend Television between 1977 and 1979, and it was briefly revived in 1985 (or 1986 in most ITV regions) with six of the original cast members. 

The series shows people of different countries with different social background, religions, and languages existing in the same classroom, learning English as a foreign language.

==Summary==
The show is set in an adult education college in London and focuses on the class in ESL (English as a Second Language) taught by Mr Jeremy Brown, who teaches a group of enrolled foreigners.

==Cast and characters==
===Series 1–3===
* Barry Evans (42 episodes) as Jeremy Brown, the ESL teacher and focal point of most of the series. He is a good-natured, earnest single man in his thirties who lives alone (apart from his Siamese cat Josephine, whom he mentions in &quot;The Examination&quot;) and holds a Bachelor of Arts from Oxford University. He was hired in Series 1 Episode 1, Pilot, in which he was warned that the students drove the previous teacher insane. Mr Brown is up to the challenge but often exasperated by the students&#x27; creative interpretations of the English language.
* George Camiller (42 episodes) as Giovanni Cupello, a stereotypical Italian British Catholic chef, the class&#x27;s spokesman and de facto class monitor. He is best friends with Max, who becomes his flatmate. Giovanni&#x27;s main problem with English is understanding metaphors and long words, although he often answers wrongly on purpose to amuse the class. He often calls Mr Brown &quot;Professori&quot;. When shocked or surprised, he often uses catchphrases like &quot;Santa Maria&quot;, &quot;Whoops ada Daisy&quot;, &quot;Okey cokey&quot;, &quot;Buona sera&quot; or &quot;Holy ravioli&quot;. He apologises by saying &quot;scusi&quot;, which is Italian for &quot;I&#x27;m sorry&quot;. He has an elaborate set of first names: Giovanni Vincenzo Marco Dino Alberto Leonardo etc. His last name is sometimes spelled &quot;Capello&quot; in the closing credits.
* Kevork Malikyan (29 episodes) as Maximillian Andrea Archimedes Papandrious (Series 1–3), stereotypical Greek Orthodox shipping agency worker from Athens who is often paired with Giovanni. He, like Giovanni, is attracted to Danielle, but as the show progresses, the three become friends. Max tends to misunderstand metaphors and long words. An example of a mistake was when Mr Brown asked him to give a word beginning with the letter &quot;l&quot; and he said &#x27;elephant&#x27; (from &quot;Hello Sailor&quot; - Season 1, Episode 10). He also has a heavy accent, which causes him to add &quot;h&quot; to the beginning of almost every word that starts with a vowel sound. Later, he shares his flat with Giovanni, with whom he is close friends; these two characters have the best command of the English language of all the students in the series.
* Robert Lee (29 episodes) as Tarō Nagazumi (Series 1–3), a Japanese electronics executive who works as a representative for the London branch of the fictional Japanese electronic company Bushido Electronics. He speaks English quite fluently, but has a habit of adding &quot;-o&quot; to almost every word he says (as in &quot;thank-o,&quot; &quot;England-o,&quot; and so on) and always replies &quot;Ah so!&quot; and bows whenever he is addressed. Early in the series he is at odds with Su-Lee due to Japan and China&#x27;s own political differences in the 1970s but they become friends later on. Most of the time he is seen with his camera.
* Jamila Massey (29 episodes) as Jamila Ranjha (Series 1–3), a stereotypical Indian housewife from Shimla. When she first joins the class she barely speaks any English - she rants in Hindi when Mr Brown asks her name, and when she finally does understand, she writes her name on the blackboard in Urdu because she cannot write it in English. Although she needs Ali to translate for her in Series 1, by Series 3 she shows a marked improvement and is able to communicate in English without needing any help. She often calls Mr Brown &quot;Masterji&quot; (Hindi roughly meaning &quot;teacher&quot; or &quot;professor&quot; with respect), and her catchphrase early in the series is &quot;gud hefening&quot; (which is how she pronounces &quot;good evening&quot;). She often brings her knitting to class. She is shown to be a Christian in the episode &quot;Guilty or Not Guilty&quot;, when she swears on the Bible to tell the truth. From &quot;A Point of Honour&quot; onward she wears a cross necklace, but in the same episode she suggests that Buddhism is the true religion when the students argue about it. Also, in the episode &quot;I Belong to Glasgow&quot;, she crosses herself along with Juan, Danielle, Max and Giovanni.
* Pik-Sen Lim (27 episodes) as Chung Su-Lee (Series 1–3), a stereotypical Chinese communist woman who works as a secretary at the Chinese Embassy. She is never seen without her Little Red Book of Mao, from which she often quotes and constantly mixes up her &quot;r&quot; and &quot;l&quot; sounds. Early in the series, she had a fierce ideological rivalry with Taro, her Japanese classmate, but later in the series, he often rushes to her defence when a character insults her or China. When she quotes Chairman Mao, Mr Brown replies &quot;That&#x27;s a matter of opinion&quot;.
* Ricardo Montez (42 episodes) as Juan Cervantes, a Spanish Catholic bartender with an optimistic outlook. Juan is always laughing at himself, confident of his answers even when they are completely wrong. Early in the series, Juan speaks almost no English (apart from &quot;An Inspector Calls&quot;, where he describes Miss Courtney as &quot;Plenty awesome, very good!&quot;) and answers everything with &quot;Por favor?&quot; (please), necessitating Giovanni to translate some key terms for him (as Spanish and Italian have many mutually intelligible words). Because of this, the two often get into arguments due to misunderstanding. His typical catchphrase is &quot;S&#x27;all right!&quot; and sometimes when he is corrected he says &quot;Sorry, wrong number.&quot; Juan&#x27;s English improves as the series goes on, but he remains one of the worst speakers, often speaking a mix of English and Spanish. He cares a great deal for Mr Brown; he often calls him &#x27;Señor Brown&#x27; and considers almost as part of his family.
* Albert Moses (42 episodes) as Ranjeet Singh, an Indian London Underground employee from Punjab and a religious Sikh. In the first episode, Mr Brown mistook him for a Pakistani when he asked him to sit next to his &quot;fellow countryman&quot;, Ali Nadim. He has a good vocabulary but tends to mix up his general knowledge, and upon being corrected he always puts his hands together and says &quot;a thousand apologies&quot;. When angered, he threatens his tormenters with his kirpan. He usually comes late to class. In &quot;A Fate Worse Than Death&quot;, a woman named Surinder appeared at the school and he told everyone that they had been betrothed to each other as children, but he no longer wished to marry her. He often clashes with Ali, but they become friends in the later episodes.
* Dino Shafeek (29 episodes) as Ali Nadim (Series 1-3), a Muslim from Lahore, Pakistan. Religious and cultural differences often bring him into conflict with Ranjeet. He is one of the most honest and hardworking students in the class, which sometimes gets Mr Brown and him into trouble. He used to work at the Taj Mahal Tandoori Restaurant in Putney, but is unemployed at the beginning of the series and later gets a job as a travelling salesman. He is married, and his wife Rehana appears in &quot;Better to Have Loved and Lost&quot; and &quot;What a Tangled Web&quot;; in the latter episode, they have had a child.
* Françoise Pascal (29 episodes) as Danielle Favre (Series 1–3), an amorous young French Catholic au pair who instantly grabs the attention of all the men, including Mr Brown. Her good looks often distract Giovanni and Max from their answers, while Mr Brown is often found in seemingly incriminating positions with her, and she is strongly attracted to him. She is annoyed when Ingrid joins the class, instigating a rivalry for Mr Brown&#x27;s attention.
* Jacki Harding (42 episodes) as Anna Schmidt, a stereotypical West German who works as an au pair. In her introduction, she refers to &quot;German efficiency&quot;; accordingly, she&#x27;s a hardworking student, occasionally asking legitimate questions, and as the series progresses, answering Mr Brown&#x27;s questions correctly. Her main problem is mixing &quot;v&quot; and &quot;w&quot; sounds. She also punctuates her sentences with German words. She is shown to have exceptional physical strength and she is never reluctant to show it, often punching fellow students (such as Max) if they try to flirt with her. In one episode, she says that Lutheranism was the true religion while the students are having an argument, but in the episode &quot;How&#x27;s Your Father&quot; she says that there&#x27;s no life after death.
* Anna Bergman (21 episodes) as Ingrid Svenson (Series 2, 4), a Swedish au pair who joins the class at the beginning of Series 2. She is attractive and straightforward about her attraction to Mr Brown, sparking a rivalry between her and Danielle Favre. Her main problem with English is word order, often getting words mixed up, such as &quot;you for I question answer&quot;. She transfers schools at the end of Series 2, but returns in the independently produced Series 4.
* Zara Nutley (42 episodes) as Dolores Courtney, the stuffy, imperious principal of the school. Miss Courtney has a great dislike of the male gender, thinks women are superior to men, and prefers female teachers. She is hesitant about employing Mr Brown, but reluctantly puts him on a month&#x27;s trial. She likes to drop in at the English classroom unannounced to check up on the progress of Mr Brown&#x27;s students, and often leaves disappointed. She nearly eloped with a man in her early years, but was caught and sent home by her father. However, it was revealed that she was only six years old at the time and the &quot;man&quot; was eight. Her first name was mentioned only in the episode &quot;Brief Re-Encounter&quot;. She has a Master of Arts from Oxford.
* Iris Sadler (20 episodes) as Gladys (Series 1–3), the tea lady in the school cafeteria, most often referred to as &quot;Gladys the tea lady&quot;. She is a vivacious, friendly woman in her seventies. In Series 3, it is revealed that she is a widow. She has a friendly relationship with both Sidney and Mr Brown. She often cajoles Mr Brown and tattles on Miss Courtney.
* Tommy Godfrey (20 episodes) as Sidney (Series 1–3), the school caretaker, a rough, roguish Cockney in his sixties who speaks in rhyming slang. Only Miss Courtney calls him by his full name; everyone else calls him Sid. He dislikes his long-term partner and wears a black tie on their anniversary. Despite not being married, he routinely refers to her as his wife. He is hard of hearing, which often creates misunderstandings. He is very fond of alcohol and tricks the students into buying drinks for him and giving him money. He also steals supplies from the school and sells them. He is friendly with both Mr Brown and Gladys.
* Gabor Vernon (8 episodes) as Zoltan Szabo (Series 2), a Hungarian man from Budapest. He speaks hardly any English, constantly saying &quot;Bocsánat?&quot; (Hungarian for &quot;Pardon?&quot;) and relying on his phrase book to help him communicate. Juan and Giovanni teach him many slang expressions, but he remains the worst speaker in the class. He has an English girlfriend in &quot;All Present If Not Correct&quot;, but she beats him up after he gives her an insulting letter that Mr Brown had intended to deliver to Miss Courtney. He is fond of music and magic tricks, implying that he works as an entertainer, and returns to Hungary after Series 2 ends.

===Series 4 only===
* Sue Bond (13 episodes) as Rita, Gladys&#x27; successor.
* Marie-Elise Grepne (13 episodes) as Michelle Dumas, a student from France.
* Jenny Lee-Wright (13 episodes) as Maria Papandrious, a student from Greece and the sister of Maximillian Papandrious.
* Harry Littlewood (13 episodes) as Henshawe, Sid&#x27;s successor.
* Raj Patel (13 episodes) as Farrukh Azzam, a student from Pakistan.
* Vincent Wong (13 episodes) as Fu Wong Chang, a student from China.

==Production==
===Development===
The series was commissioned by Michael Grade, Director of Programmes at London Weekend Television.

The majority of recordings for the first three series took place on Tuesday evenings in Studio Two at the South Bank Television Centre while Series 4 was filmed at Uxbridge Technical College in Middlesex.

Using this series as an example, Sarita Malik, in &quot;Representing Black Britain&quot; (2002) wrote that &quot;Blacks, Asians or &#x27;race&#x27; were usually the butt of the joke&quot;, which &quot;tended to hit a racist note, but always in a well-meaning, benevolent tone&quot;. She continued that &quot;never before had so many diverse races... been seen in the same television frame, but they had never clung so tightly to their popular crude national stereotypes.&quot;

The series attracted about 18 million viewers. Grade cancelled the programme having considered the stereotyping offensive. &quot;It was really irresponsible of us to put it out&quot;, he told Linda Agran at the Edinburgh Television Festival in 1985.

===International screenings===
The series was sold to Pakistan, Australia, New Zealand, Sri Lanka, India, Malaysia, Kenya, Nigeria, Ghana, Singapore, Persian Gulf states and Hong Kong. It was also one of the first British TV programmes shown in South Africa after the end of the boycott by the British Actors&#x27; Equity Association. It was also broadcast in Canada on CBC Television from 1978 until 1982. The series was screened by some minor or independent ABC TV stations in the United States during 1985. In comments released in 2005, Jonathan Rigby said the series was still screened internationally, particularly in the countries represented in the series onscreen.

==Episodes==
==DVD releases==
The series was released as a &quot;Best of&quot; four-disc box set on Region 2 DVD in 2003 (Cinema Club), and on Region 1 DVD in 2004 (Granada). However, these sets exclude the Series 1 episode &quot;Kill or Cure&quot;, the Series 2 episode &quot;Don&#x27;t Forget the Driver&quot;, the Series 3 episode &quot;Guilty or Not Guilty?&quot; and all of Series 4.

Another four-DVD box set, &quot;The Complete LWT Series&quot;, released by Network in November 2007 contains all episodes of Series 1–3.

==International remakes==
International television shows based on the premise of &quot;Mind Your Language&quot; include:
* India: &quot;Zabaan Sambhalke&quot; and &quot;Zaban Sambhal Ke&quot; (in Hindi)
* Indonesia: &quot;Kelas Internasional&quot; (in Indonesian)
* Japan: &quot;日本人の知らない日本語&quot; (&quot;Nihonjin no Shiranai Nihongo&quot;; in Japanese)
* Jordan: العلم نور (&quot;al-ʿilm nūr&quot;; in Arabic)
* Kenya: &quot;Classmates&quot;
* Malaysia: &quot;Cakap Melayu Lah&quot; (In Malay) and &quot;Oh My English!&quot; (in English)
* Malta: &quot;Klassi Għalina&quot; (in Maltese)
* Nigeria: &quot;Second Chance!&quot; (in English), and &quot;Jami&#x27;ar Albarkawa&quot; (in Hausa)
* South Korea: &quot;So Not Worth It&quot; (in Korean)
* Sri Lanka: &quot;Raja Kaduwa!&quot; (in Sinhala)
* United States: A 1981 episode of sit-com &quot;Diff&#x27;rent Strokes&quot; titled &quot;Almost American&quot; served as a backdoor pilot for an American adaptation, with the regular &quot;Diff&#x27;rent Strokes&quot; cast only appearing briefly at the beginning and end of the episode. The series was not picked up. Later in 1986, &quot;Mind Your Language&quot; was adapted as &quot;What a Country!&quot; (in English)

==Criticism of racial stereotypes==
David Aaronovitch notes that even Michael Grade, the commissioner of the series, regrets that &quot;Mind Your Language&quot; was ever broadcast:

<text>Metaxa () is a line of branded Greek alcoholic drinks, each a flavored amber blend of spirits and Muscat wine, aged in oak barrels, and packaged in amphora-shaped bottles. Several Metaxa products have numbered “star” designations indicating, according to different sources, either the product’s age, the number of base spirits and wines used in making it, or simply the quality level (itself a reflection of the age). Metaxa&#x27;s main exported products are 5 Star, 7 Star, 12 Star, and Private Reserve. (Metaxa 3 Star is not exported.)

Created in 1888 and labeled first as a cognac and then as a brandy until prohibited by naming regulations, the maker remained in private hands until sold in 1989 to Grand Metropolitan, which in turn sold it in 2000 to Rémy Cointreau.

== History ==

The company&#x27;s founder, Spyros Metaxa, was born in 1848 into a family of Greek silk merchants. Exposed during his travels to spirits and wines from around the world, he created Metaxa in 1888, when he owned a tavern. The &quot;Salamina Warrior&quot;, the Metaxa emblem, is inspired by an ancient medallion that Spyros Metaxa found when building his distillery in Piraeus in 1888. In 1968, the distillery and the Metaxa cellars were relocated to new facilities in Athens&#x27;s northern suburb of Kifissia.

== Production ==
On Samos, an island in the eastern Aegean Sea, grapes, primarily Muscat, a variety originally from Greece, are cultivated in terraces and hand-picked. Metaxa uses sweet Muscat wines sourced from the island, which are aged several years and so somewhat oxidized. The maker used to buy wine from independent vintners but has begun making its own, from fruit grown in its own vineyards. Its base brandies come mostly (80%) from Spain and Italy, and the rest from Greece, where they are distilled from sun-dried grapes. These ingredients are aged separately and then combined in Limousin oak casks. Mediterranean botanicals are added as part of the finishing process, including May rose, also a component of Chanel No. 5 perfume. The result is aged for at least two years but in some cases decades.

The company&#x27;s current Metaxa master, the equivalent of a master distiller or master blender, Constantinos Raptis, is the fifth since 1888. He has overseen the production process for more than 25 years.

<text>The English Teacher is a 1945 novel written by R. K. Narayan. It is a part of a series of novels and collections of short stories set in &quot;Malgudi&quot;. &quot;The English Teacher&quot; was preceded by &quot;Swami and Friends&quot; (1935), &quot;The Bachelor of Arts&quot; (1937) and &quot;Malgudi Days&quot;, (1943) and followed by &quot;Mr. Sampath – The Printer of Malgudi&quot;.

This novel, dedicated to Narayan&#x27;s wife Rajam, is not only autobiographical but also poignant in its intensity of feeling. The story is a series of experiences in the life of Krishna, an English teacher, and his quest for inner peace and self-development after the traumatising death of his wife.

==Plot==
As an English teacher and lecturer at Albert Mission College, Krishna has led a mundane and monotonous lifestyle comparable to that of a cow. But he also plays an important role in protecting Indian culture. His life changes when his wife, Susila, and their child, Leela, come to live with him. With their welfare on his hands, Krishna learns to be a proper husband and learns how to accept the responsibility of taking care of his family. He feels that his life has comparatively improved, as he understands that there&#x27;s more meaning to life than to just teaching. The plot explores about Krishna&#x27;s account on Susila&#x27;s illness and events occurred afterwards. Susila might have been suffering from Malaria and Typhoid long before her symptoms appear according to research done by two Sri Lankan authors, Dr. Nishantha Karunarathna from Postgraduate Institute of Humanities and Social Sciences (PGIHS), University of Peradeniya and Mr. Lal Medawattegedara from Open University of Sri Lanka (OUSL).They even have gone on to say that Dr. Shankar is not negligent in his medical practice.
Susila eventually passes away due to typhoid complications. Krishna, destroyed by her loss, has suicidal thoughts but gives them up for the sake of his daughter, Leela. He is lost and miserable after her death, but he receives a letter from a stranger who indicates that Susila has been in contact with him and that she wants to communicate with Krishna. This makes him more collected and cheerful, leading to a journey in search of enlightenment, with the stranger acting as a medium to Susila in the spiritual world. Leela, on the other hand, goes to a preschool where Krishna gets to meet the headmaster, a profound man who cares for the students in his school and teaches them moral values through his own methods. The Headmaster puts his students as his top priority but he does not care for his own family and children, eventually leaving them on the day predicted by an astrologer as the day of his death, which did not come true. Krishna is influenced by the headmaster, eventually learning to &#x27;communicate&#x27; with Susila on his own, thus concluding the entire story with the quote that he felt &#x27;a moment of rare immutable joy&#x27;.

==Literary significance and criticism==
The synopsis at the back of &#x27;The English Teacher&#x27; by Indian Thought Publications says, &quot;Never has the magical storyteller of imaginary Malgudi woven tragedy and humour so deftly together.&quot;

==Book information==

A paperback edition was issued in Chicago by the University of Chicago Press in 1980 with . Many other editions have been issued in other countries by several other publishers. It was published in the U.S. as Grateful to Life and Death in 1953 by The Michigan State College Press.

<text>Frederick John Horniman (8 October 1835 – 5 March 1906) was an English tea trader and founder of the Horniman Museum in London. He was brought up and lived in Croydon&#x27;s Park Hill area.

==Life==
Frederick, born in Bridgwater, Somerset, was born into a Quaker family, the son of John Horniman, who established Horniman&#x27;s Tea, a tea business using mechanical packaging. By 1891, it was said to be the biggest tea company in the world.

He founded the Horniman Museum in Forest Hill, south London. In 1901, he gave the freehold estate, museum and the art and natural history collections to London County Council for use by the people of London.

He was a member of the London County Council, and Liberal Member of Parliament for Penryn and Falmouth in Cornwall from 1895 until 1906.

In 1859 he married Rebekah Emslie (1825–1895). Their son Emslie John Horniman (1863–1932) was Liberal MP for Chelsea (1906–10). He continued to develop the museum, and was a noted art collector and patron in his own right, who rebuilt his homes at Burford Priory in Oxfordshire (under Walter Godfrey) and at Garden Corner, Chelsea (under C.F.A. Voysey). Their daughter, Annie Horniman (1860–1937), worked in theatre, being a founder of the Abbey Theatre, Dublin.

His first wife died in 1895, and in 1897 he married Minnie Louisa Bennett; they had two daughters.

<doc id="749032" wikidata="Q748865" url="?curid=749032" title="Transit of minor planets">
<text>A transit of a minor planet takes place when a minor planet passes directly between an observer and another heavenly body, obscuring a small part of that body&#x27;s disc. From the perspective of observers on Earth, transits of the Sun and Moon by minor planets are very rare, as the minor planets orbiting between the Earth and those bodies are few and very small. Transits of the Sun would be more visible from the outer planets.

Transits should be distinguished from occultations, in which the minor planet entirely blocks out the light from the other body.

==Asteroids==
Most asteroids orbit in the asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter. For this reason, transits of the Sun by asteroids are rare from Earth&#x27;s perspective, but would not be uncommon from the perspective of Jupiter. Still, the high inclination of many asteroid orbits would make this less common that it would be otherwise. One example of a forthcoming asteroid transit visible from Jupiter will be that of 4 Vesta, which will transits the Sun on January 4, 2044, with an angular diameter of 0.24″.

From the perspective of Earth, the only types of asteroids that can transit the Sun are those with orbits that take them between the two bodies. These include Aten asteroids (including Apohele asteroids and the hypothetical Vulcanoid asteroids) and some Apollo asteroids (perhaps including quasi-satellites of Earth). Unfortunately, observations of such transits are difficult because all of these asteroids are only a few kilometres in diameter at most, so that their angular diameter is too tiny to observe against the Sun.

One example was the May 16, 1990 transit of 3838 Epona with a diameter of 2.5 km. At a distance of from Earth, its angular diameter was only 0.007 seconds of arc, far too small to see. Similarly, asteroid 30825 (1990 TG1) transited on April 14, 2005, but was again unobservable, having an angular diameter of about 0.05″, and 2101 Adonis transited on September 24, 2007, with an even smaller angular diameter of only 0.005″.

In theory, if a transit took place during a very close approach by a near-Earth asteroid, it might be observable. However, no such asteroid transits have been observed up to the present time.

==Comets==
Comets may also transit the Sun; for example, Halley&#x27;s Comet transited on 19 May 1910.

Another example was C/1819 N1, the Great Comet of 1819, but occurrence of that transit was not known until after it had happened, when the orbit was calculated, and although some observers later claimed to have seen the comet transiting the Sun at the time, these observations seem dubious.

==Transits of the moon==
It is theoretically possible that minor planets on an Earth-crossing orbit could transit the Moon. However, such events would be extremely rare since only a few catalogued minor planets, such as 2004 FH, have come closer to Earth than the distance of the Moon. Such an event might be observable (an asteroid of 25 metres&#x27; diameter at a distance of 380,000 km has an angular diameter of 0.01″), but none has been observed as yet, although there have been some reports of such events, sometimes classified as UFO-sightings.

<doc id="749033" wikidata="Q1134776" url="?curid=749033" title="Dilworth's theorem">
<text>In mathematics, in the areas of order theory and combinatorics, Dilworth&#x27;s theorem states that, in any finite partially ordered set, the maximum size of an antichain of incomparable elements equals the minimum number of chains needed to cover all elements. This number is called the width of the partial order. The theorem is named for the mathematician Robert P. Dilworth, who published it in 1950.

A version of the theorem for infinite partially ordered sets states that, when there exists a decomposition into finitely many chains, or when there exists a finite upper bound on the size of an antichain, the sizes of the largest antichain and of the smallest chain decomposition are again equal.

==Statement==
An antichain in a partially ordered set is a set of elements no two of which are comparable to each other, and a chain is a set of elements every two of which are comparable. A chain decomposition is a partition of the elements of the order into disjoint chains. Dilworth&#x27;s theorem states that, in any finite partially ordered set, the largest antichain has the same size as the smallest chain decomposition. Here, the size of the antichain is its number of elements, and the size of the chain decomposition is its number of chains. The width of the partial order is defined as the common size of the antichain and chain decomposition.

== Inductive proof ==

The following proof by induction on the size of the partially ordered set formula_1 is based on that of .

Let formula_1 be a finite partially ordered set. The theorem holds trivially if formula_1 is empty. So, assume that formula_1 has at least one element, and let formula_5 be a maximal element of formula_1.

By induction, we assume that for some integer formula_7 the partially ordered set formula_8 can be covered by formula_7 disjoint chains formula_10 and has at least one antichain formula_11 of size formula_7. Clearly, formula_13 for formula_14. For formula_14, let formula_16 be the maximal element in formula_17 that belongs to an antichain of size formula_7 in formula_19, and set formula_20. 
We claim that formula_21 is an antichain. 
Let formula_22 be an antichain of size formula_7 that contains formula_16. Fix arbitrary distinct indices formula_25 and formula_26. Then formula_27. Let formula_28. Then formula_29, by the definition of formula_30. This implies that formula_31, since formula_32. By interchanging the roles of formula_25 and formula_26 in this argument we also have formula_35. This verifies that formula_21 is an antichain.

We now return to formula_1. Suppose first that formula_38 for some formula_39. Let formula_40 be the chain formula_41. Then by the choice of formula_16, formula_43 does not have an antichain of size formula_7. Induction then implies that formula_43 can be covered by formula_46 disjoint chains since formula_47 is an antichain of size formula_48 in formula_49. 
Thus, formula_1 can be covered by formula_7 disjoint chains, as required. Next, if formula_52 for each formula_39, then formula_54 is an antichain of size formula_55 in formula_1 (since formula_5 is maximal in formula_1). Now formula_1 can be covered by the formula_55 chains formula_61, completing the proof.

==Proof via Kőnig&#x27;s theorem==
Like a number of other results in combinatorics, Dilworth&#x27;s theorem is equivalent to Kőnig&#x27;s theorem on bipartite graph matching and several other related theorems including Hall&#x27;s marriage theorem.

To prove Dilworth&#x27;s theorem for a partial order &quot;S&quot; with &quot;n&quot; elements, using Kőnig&#x27;s theorem, define a bipartite graph &quot;G&quot; = (&quot;U&quot;,&quot;V&quot;,&quot;E&quot;) where &quot;U&quot; = &quot;V&quot; = &quot;S&quot; and where (&quot;u&quot;,&quot;v&quot;) is an edge in &quot;G&quot; when &quot;u&quot; &lt; &quot;v&quot; in &quot;S&quot;. By Kőnig&#x27;s theorem, there exists a matching &quot;M&quot; in &quot;G&quot;, and a set of vertices &quot;C&quot; in &quot;G&quot;, such that each edge in the graph contains at least one vertex in &quot;C&quot; and such that &quot;M&quot; and &quot;C&quot; have the same cardinality &quot;m&quot;. Let &quot;A&quot; be the set of elements of &quot;S&quot; that do not correspond to any vertex in &quot;C&quot;; then &quot;A&quot; has at least &quot;n&quot; - &quot;m&quot; elements (possibly more if &quot;C&quot; contains vertices corresponding to the same element on both sides of the bipartition) and no two elements of &quot;A&quot; are comparable to each other. Let &quot;P&quot; be a family of chains formed by including &quot;x&quot; and &quot;y&quot; in the same chain whenever there is an edge (&quot;x&quot;,&quot;y&quot;) in &quot;M&quot;; then &quot;P&quot; has &quot;n&quot; - &quot;m&quot; chains. Therefore, we have constructed an antichain and a partition into chains with the same cardinality.

To prove Kőnig&#x27;s theorem from Dilworth&#x27;s theorem, for a bipartite graph &quot;G&quot; = (&quot;U&quot;,&quot;V&quot;,&quot;E&quot;), form a partial order on the vertices of &quot;G&quot; in which &quot;u&quot; &lt; &quot;v&quot; exactly when &quot;u&quot; is in &quot;U&quot;, &quot;v&quot; is in &quot;V&quot;, and there exists an edge in &quot;E&quot; from &quot;u&quot; to &quot;v&quot;. By Dilworth&#x27;s theorem, there exists an antichain &quot;A&quot; and a partition into chains &quot;P&quot; both of which have the same size. But the only nontrivial chains in the partial order are pairs of elements corresponding to the edges in the graph, so the nontrivial chains in &quot;P&quot; form a matching in the graph. The complement of &quot;A&quot; forms a vertex cover in &quot;G&quot; with the same cardinality as this matching.

This connection to bipartite matching allows the width of any partial order to be computed in polynomial time. More precisely, &quot;n&quot;-element partial orders of width &quot;k&quot; can be recognized in time &quot;O&quot;(&quot;kn&quot;2). 

==Extension to infinite partially ordered sets==
Dilworth&#x27;s theorem for infinite partially ordered sets states that a partially ordered set has finite width &quot;w&quot; if and only if it may be partitioned into &quot;w&quot; chains. For, suppose that an infinite partial order &quot;P&quot; has width &quot;w&quot;, meaning that there are at most a finite number &quot;w&quot; of elements in any antichain. For any subset &quot;S&quot; of &quot;P&quot;, a decomposition into &quot;w&quot; chains (if it exists) may be described as a coloring of the incomparability graph of &quot;S&quot; (a graph that has the elements of &quot;S&quot; as vertices, with an edge between every two incomparable elements) using &quot;w&quot; colors; every color class in a proper coloring of the incomparability graph must be a chain. By the assumption that &quot;P&quot; has width &quot;w&quot;, and by the finite version of Dilworth&#x27;s theorem, every finite subset &quot;S&quot; of &quot;P&quot; has a &quot;w&quot;-colorable incomparability graph. Therefore, by the De Bruijn–Erdős theorem, &quot;P&quot; itself also has a &quot;w&quot;-colorable incomparability graph, and thus has the desired partition into chains.

However, the theorem does not extend so simply to partially ordered sets in which the width, and not just the cardinality of the set, is infinite. In this case the size of the largest antichain and the minimum number of chains needed to cover the partial order may be very different from each other. In particular, for every infinite cardinal number κ there is an infinite partially ordered set of width ℵ0 whose partition into the fewest chains has κ chains.

 discusses analogues of Dilworth&#x27;s theorem in the infinite setting.

==Dual of Dilworth&#x27;s theorem (Mirsky&#x27;s theorem)==

A dual of Dilworth&#x27;s theorem states that the size of the largest chain in a partial order (if finite) equals the smallest number of antichains into which the order may be partitioned. This is called Mirsky&#x27;s theorem. Its proof is much simpler than the proof of Dilworth&#x27;s theorem itself: for any element &quot;x&quot;, consider the chains that have &quot;x&quot; as their largest element, and let &quot;N&quot;(&quot;x&quot;) denote the size of the largest of these &quot;x&quot;-maximal chains. Then each set &quot;N&quot;−1(&quot;i&quot;), consisting of elements that have equal values of &quot;N&quot;, is an antichain, and these antichains partition the partial order into a number of antichains equal to the size of the largest chain.

==Perfection of comparability graphs==
A comparability graph is an undirected graph formed from a partial order by creating a vertex per element of the order, and an edge connecting any two comparable elements. Thus, a clique in a comparability graph corresponds to a chain, and an independent set in a comparability graph corresponds to an antichain. Any induced subgraph of a comparability graph is itself a comparability graph, formed from the restriction of the partial order to a subset of its elements.

An undirected graph is perfect if, in every induced subgraph, the chromatic number equals the size of the largest clique. Every comparability graph is perfect: this is essentially just Mirsky&#x27;s theorem, restated in graph-theoretic terms. By the perfect graph theorem of , the complement of any perfect graph is also perfect. Therefore, the complement of any comparability graph is perfect; this is essentially just Dilworth&#x27;s theorem itself, restated in graph-theoretic terms . Thus, the complementation property of perfect graphs can provide an alternative proof of Dilworth&#x27;s theorem.

==Width of special partial orders==
The Boolean lattice &quot;B&quot;&quot;n&quot; is the power set of an &quot;n&quot;-element set &quot;X&quot;—essentially {1, 2, …, &quot;n&quot;}—ordered by inclusion or, notationally, (2[&quot;n&quot;], ⊆). Sperner&#x27;s theorem states that a maximum antichain of &quot;B&quot;&quot;n&quot; has size at most
:formula_62
In other words, a largest family of incomparable subsets of &quot;X&quot; is obtained by selecting the subsets of &quot;X&quot; that have median size. The Lubell–Yamamoto–Meshalkin inequality also concerns antichains in a power set and can be used to prove Sperner&#x27;s theorem.

If we order the integers in the interval [1, 2&quot;n&quot;] by divisibility, the subinterval [&quot;n&quot; + 1, 2&quot;n&quot;] forms an antichain with cardinality &quot;n&quot;. A partition of this partial order into &quot;n&quot; chains is easy to achieve: for each odd integer &quot;m&quot; in [1,2&quot;n&quot;], form a chain of the numbers of the form &quot;m&quot;2&quot;i&quot;. Therefore, by Dilworth&#x27;s theorem, the width of this partial order is &quot;n&quot;.

The Erdős–Szekeres theorem on monotone subsequences can be interpreted as an application of Dilworth&#x27;s theorem to partial orders of order dimension two.

The &quot;convex dimension&quot; of an antimatroid is defined as the minimum number of chains needed to define the antimatroid, and Dilworth&#x27;s theorem can be used to show that it equals the width of an associated partial order; this connection leads to a polynomial time algorithm for convex dimension.

<doc id="749038" wikidata="Q13479582" url="?curid=749038" title="National Express Coaches">
<text>National Express, also abbreviated NX, is a long and medium-distance intercity coach operator operating services throughout Great Britain. It is a subsidiary of the British multinational public transport company Mobico Group. Most services are subcontracted to local coach companies. The company&#x27;s head office is in offices above Birmingham Coach Station.

==History==

Pursuant to the Transport Act 1968, the National Bus Company (NBC) was formed as a holding company for the many state-owned local bus companies. Many of these companies also operated coach services, which were brought together for marketing purposes under the &quot;National&quot; brand, developed by NBC chair Frederick Wood and design consultant Norman Wilson. The &quot;National Express&quot; brand was first used in 1974 and gradually became the main brand name for the coach business, although the coach services continued to be operated by the individual companies.

Coach services were deregulated under the Transport Act 1980, and buses by the Transport Act 1985. In March 1988 National Express was privatised in a management buyout. In July 1989, the company bought ATL Holdings (with operations in Sheffield) and a 50% share in Yelloway Trathen, which was renamed Trathens Travel Services.

In August 1989, the Eurolines services from London to Alicante, Barcelona and Paris were purchased from the tour operator Wallace Arnold, and the express services (with 29 coaches) in Scotland and to London from Stagecoach. These were operated under the Caledonian Express brand.

In June 1991, National Express was sold to the Drawlane Group. In December 1992, National Express Group plc was floated on the London Stock Exchange.

In its early years, National Express had little competition in the long-distance coach market. A number of operators attempted to compete with the company after deregulation in 1980, the largest being the British Coachways consortium, but most had ceased to compete by the end of the decade. However, in 2003, Stagecoach introduced Megabus, a no-frills service whose £1 fares sparked a price war with National Express in autumn 2004. Competition intensified in 2007 when Megabus transferred its London terminus from the Green Line Coach Station into the main Victoria Coach Station.

==Operations==
A national network links more than 550 routes, including many of the UK mainland&#x27;s cities, with 11,000 cross-country journeys every week .
National Express operates coach services direct to the terminal for all major UK airports, 24 hours a day, with 1,100 airport services every day, including East Midlands, Gatwick, Heathrow, Luton and Stansted. The &quot;Airport&quot; brand was created in 2003 when the National Express image brand was updated, merging the former Airlink, Flightlink, Jetlink and Speedlink brands.

=== Effects of the COVID-19 pandemic ===
Following the introduction of guidance from the UK Government on avoiding non-essential travel, services were replaced from 24 March 2020 with a limited network of services for passengers with essential travel needs. However, due to declining passenger numbers as a result of the restrictions, all services were suspended from 6 April 2020. Services restarted nearly three months later on 1 July, on about a quarter of route mileage and with reduced frequencies.

As a result of the discovery of a new, more transmissible variant and the implementation of tighter restrictions prohibiting travel in many areas of the country, services were significantly reduced by the end of December 2020. On the implementation of a third national lockdown in January 2021, services were again suspended from 11 January. Eleven weeks later, limited services again resumed on 29 March.

==Fares==
National Express tickets are available through a variety of sources. Most tickets are booked on-line through both the company&#x27;s own website and many third party sites. Telephone bookings are also available as are tickets through the traditional channels tickets of National Express ticket offices at coach stations, third-party agents at bus stations and travel agents. Since 2013, tickets have also been available for purchase from the Post Office.

===Coachcards===
National Express offers several discounts to customers. 
*Young Persons Coachcard – Available to people aged 16–26. This card gives a third off standard and fully flexible fares.
*Senior Coachcard – Following the Government&#x27;s scrapping of the concessionary half-price fares for the over-60s in October 2011, National Express introduced a Senior Coachcard. Available to over-60s, this gives a third off standard and fully flexible fares.
*Disabled Coachcard – Following the government&#x27;s scrapping of the concessionary half-price fares for disabled people in October 2011, National Express introduced a Disabled Coachcard. Available to adults registered as disabled, this gives a third off standard and fully flexible fares.

==Fleet==
National Express and its franchisees operate a limited number of coach types, primarily standardising on the Caetano Levante body on Mercedes-Benz, Scania and Volvo chassis. The Levante was designed between 2003 and 2005 by Portuguese coachbuilder Salvador Caetano and National Express exclusively for use on the network, equipped with a wheelchair lift at the front entrance door, and could be built on either two or three axles depending on chassis configuration. The most recent tri-axle Levante III was introduced onto the network in July 2018, with an updated version named the Levante IIIA introduced from late 2022. 

After having initially trialled a Yutong TCe12 on airport service A9 during 2020, National Express is to introduce a Yutong GTe14 tri-axle battery electric coach on a four-week trial operating Stansted Airport services from March 2024. The company also purchased 25 Van Hool Altano TDX21 coaches for services 040 between London and Bristol, and the 540 between London and Manchester via Milton Keynes. These are due to enter service in 2024.

National Express also runs ten Caetano Boa Vista bodied Scania K410 double decker coaches on its network, all of which are operated by Edwards Coaches. The first six entered service with National Express mainly for use between London Victoria and Luton Airport in October 2016, with the additional four later purchased by Edwards Coaches during 2018. 

National Express had previously standardised on the double-deck variant of the MCW Metroliner for &#x27;Rapide&#x27; coach services in 1980s, however by January 2007, the double-decker coach fleet had been reduced to 12 Neoplan Skyliners, all of which were later withdrawn from National Express service following a speeding driver overturning a Skyliner on an M25 motorway sliproad, causing the deaths of three passengers.

==On-board services==
In April 2001 National Express phased out its on-board catering service, having already phased out its on-board television service in the 1990s. However, in late 2004 National Express launched NXTV or National Xpress Television. Rather than showing a whole film as on an aircraft, NXTV would instead show various episodes of British television series such as &quot;A Touch of Frost&quot;, &quot;My Family&quot; and &quot;Top Gear&quot;, all of which were commissioned by ITV and the BBC. The service was displayed on small monitors situated above the overhead luggage compartments, powered by a motor to move downwards and upwards while the programming would be played from a DVD drive at the driver&#x27;s dashboard.

The service was phased out in the summer of 2006, due to a lack of interest in purchasing headphones, available at vending machines in the major stations and also via on-board vendors before a journey. The headphone jack was compatible with any headphone, removing any reason to buy those offered. Also, by the time NXTV was launched, the Apple iPod was already at its height of popularity, diverting interest away from it. Programming was also very limited, with many of the episodes being frequent repeats from terrestrial television. The headphones were later given away for free when the service was about to be ceased. The advertising slogan was &quot;Television shows as you board the coach&quot;.

<doc id="749041" wikidata="Q460547" url="?curid=749041" title="Annie Horniman">
<text>Annie Elizabeth Fredericka Horniman CH (3 October 1860 – 6 August 1937) was an English theatre matron and manager. She established the Abbey Theatre in Dublin and founded the first regional repertory theatre company in Britain at the Gaiety Theatre in Manchester. She encouraged the work of new writers and playwrights, including W. B. Yeats, George Bernard Shaw and members of what became known as the Manchester School of dramatists.

==Early life==

Annie Horniman was born at Surrey Mount, Forest Hill, London, in 1860, the elder child of Frederick John Horniman and his first wife Rebekah née Emslie. Her father was a tea merchant and the founder of the Horniman Museum; her grandfather was John Horniman who founded the family tea business of Horniman and Company. Annie and her younger brother Emslie were educated privately at their home. Her father was opposed to the theatre, which he considered sinful, but their German governess took Annie and Emslie secretly to a performance of &quot;The Merchant of Venice&quot; at The Crystal Palace when Annie was aged 14.

Annie&#x27;s father allowed her to enter the Slade School of Fine Art in 1882. Here she discovered that her talent in art was limited but she developed other interests, particularly in the theatre and opera. She took great pleasure in Wagner&#x27;s &quot;Ring&quot; cycle and in Ibsen&#x27;s plays. She cycled in London and twice over the Alps, smoked in public and explored alternative religions. The &quot;lonely rich girl&quot; had become &quot;an independent-minded woman&quot;. In 1890 she joined the occult society the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn, where she remained a member until disagreements with its leaders led to her resignation in 1903. During this time she met and became a friend of W. B. Yeats, acting as his amanuensis for some years. Their friendship endured: Frank O&#x27;Connor recalled that on the day Yeats heard of her death, he spent the entire evening speaking of his memories of her.

==Theatre founder and manager==

Annie&#x27;s first venture into the theatre was in 1894 and was made possible by a legacy from her grandfather. She anonymously supported her friend Florence Farr in a season of new plays at the Avenue Theatre, London. This included a new play by Yeats, &quot;The Land of Heart&#x27;s Desire&quot;, and the première of George Bernard Shaw&#x27;s play &quot;Arms and the Man&quot;. In 1903 Yeats persuaded her to go to Dublin to back productions by the Irish National Theatre Society. Here she discovered her skill as a theatre administrator. She bought a property and developed it into the Abbey Theatre, which opened in December 1904. Although she moved back to live in England she continued to support the theatre financially until 1910. Meanwhile, in Manchester she had purchased and renovated the Gaiety Theatre in 1908 and developed it into the first regional repertory theatre in Britain.

At the Gaiety she appointed Ben Iden Payne as the director and employed actors on 40-week contracts, alternating their work between large and small parts. The plays produced included classics such as Euripides and Shakespeare, and she introduced works by contemporary playwrights such as Ibsen and Shaw. She also encouraged local writers who formed what was known as the Manchester School of dramatists, the leading members of which were Harold Brighouse, Stanley Houghton and Allan Monkhouse. The Gaiety company undertook tours of America and Canada in 1912 and 1913. Annie became a well-known public figure in Manchester, lecturing on subjects which included women&#x27;s suffrage and her views about the theatre. In 1910 she was awarded the honorary degree of MA by Manchester University. During the First World War the Gaiety continued to stage plays but financial difficulties led to the disbandment of the permanent company in 1917, following which productions in the theatre were by visiting companies. In 1921 Annie sold the theatre to a cinema company.

As a result of her tea connection, she was known as &quot;Hornibags&quot;. She held court at the Midland Hotel, wearing exotic clothing and openly smoking cigarettes, which was considered scandalous at the time. She introduced Manchester to what was called at the time &quot;the play of ideas&quot;. The theatre critic James Agate noted that Horniman&#x27;s high-minded theatrical ventures had &quot;an air of gloomy strenuousness&quot; about them.

==Later life==

Annie moved to London where she kept a flat in Portman Square. In 1933 she was made a Member of the Order of the Companions of Honour. She died in 1937 at her home in Shere, Surrey. Her estate amounted to a little over £50,000. &quot;The Annie Horniman Papers&quot; are held in the John Rylands Library at the University of Manchester.

<doc id="749044" wikidata="Q663049" url="?curid=749044" title="USS Marblehead (CL-12)">
<text>USS &quot;Marblehead&quot; (CL-12) was an light cruiser, originally classified as a scout cruiser, of the United States Navy. She was the third Navy ship named for the town of Marblehead, Massachusetts.

==Built in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania==
&quot;Marblehead&quot; was authorized on 1 July 1918, and assigned to William Cramp &amp; Sons, Philadelphia on 24 January 1919. She was laid down on 4 August 1920, and launched on 9 October 1923, sponsored by Mrs. Joseph Evans. &quot;Marblehead&quot; was commissioned on 3 November 1923, with Captain Chauncey Shackford in command.

&quot;Marblehead&quot; was long at the waterline with an overall length of , her beam was and a mean draft of . Her standard displacement was and at full load. Her crew, during peace time, consisted of 29 officers and 429 enlisted men.

&quot;Marblehead&quot; was powered by four Parsons geared steam turbines, each driving one screw, using steam generated by 12 White-Forster boilers. The engines were designed to produce and reach a top speed of . She was designed to provide a range of at a speed of , but in service proved capable of only at that speed.

&quot;Marblehead&quot;″s main armament went through many changes while she was being designed. Originally she was to mount ten /53 caliber guns; two on either side at the waist, with the remaining eight mounted in tiered casemates on either side of the fore and aft superstructures. After America&#x27;s entry into World War I the US Navy worked alongside the Royal Navy and it was decided to mount four 6-in/53 caliber guns in two twin gun turrets fore and aft and keep the eight guns in the tiered casemates so that she would have an eight gun broadside and, due to limited arcs of fire from the casemate guns, four to six guns firing fore or aft. Her secondary armament consisted of two /50 caliber anti-aircraft guns in single mounts. &quot;Marblehead&quot; was initially built with the capacity to carry 224 mines, but these were removed early in her career to make way for more crew accommodations. She also carried two triple and two twin, above-water, torpedo tube mounts for torpedoes. The triple mounts were fitted on either side of the upper deck, aft of the aircraft catapults, and the twin mounts were one deck lower on either side, covered by hatches in the side of the hull.

The ship lacked a full-length waterline armor belt. The sides of her boiler and engine rooms and steering gear were protected by of armor. The transverse bulkheads at the end of her machinery rooms were thick forward and three inches thick aft. The deck over the machinery spaces and steering gear had a thickness of 1.5 inches. The gun turrets were not armored and only provided protection against muzzle blast. The conning tower had 1.5 inches of armor. &quot;Marblehead&quot; carried two floatplanes aboard that were stored on the two catapults. Initially these were probably Vought VE-9s until the early 1930s when the ship may have operated the OJ-2 until 1935 and Curtiss SOC Seagulls until 1940 when Vought OS2U Kingfishers were used on ships without hangars.

===Armament changes===
During her career &quot;Marblehead&quot; went through several armament changes, some to save weight, and others to increase her AA armament. The lower torpedo tube mounts proved to be very wet and were removed, and the openings plated over, before the start of World War II. Another change made before the war was to increase the 3-inch guns to eight, all mounted in the ship&#x27;s waist. After 1940, the lower aft guns were removed and the casemates plated over for the same reason as the lower torpedo mounts. During the Battle of Makassar Strait, &quot;Marblehead&quot; had seven 3-inch/50-caliber guns and eight .50 caliber machine guns, four mounted atop the foremast and another four aft. The ship&#x27;s anti-aircraft armament had been augmented by three twin Bofors guns and twelve Oerlikon cannons by the end of the war.

==Inter-war period==
After commissioning, &quot;Marblehead&quot; departed Boston for shakedown in the English Channel and Mediterranean. In 1925, she visited Australia, stopping en route in the Samoan and Society Islands and, on her return, in the Galápagos Islands. A year after her return, &quot;Marblehead&quot; was underway again on an extended voyage. Early in 1927, she cruised off Bluefields and Bragman&#x27;s Bluffs, Nicaragua, her mission there to aid American efforts to bring together and reconcile the various political factions then fighting in that country. With one exception, Augusto César Sandino, faction leaders agreed to the terms of the Peace of Tipitapa on 4 May 1927, and the United States was requested to supervise elections in 1928.

&quot;Marblehead&quot; next sailed for Pearl Harbor, where she joined and and headed for Shanghai, China. Upon arrival there she contributed to the show of force aimed at the protection of American and other foreign nationals of Shanghai&#x27;s international settlement during operations against that city through the summer of 1927, in China&#x27;s civil war.

In addition to her stay at Shanghai, &quot;Marblehead&quot; spent two months up the Yangtze River at Hankow, and visited several Japanese ports before leaving the Far East in March 1928. &quot;En route&quot; home, the cruiser stopped at Corinto, Nicaragua to assist in the preparations for elections under the Peace of Tipitapa, delaying her return to Boston until August.

During the next decade &quot;Marblehead&quot; operated with both the Atlantic (August 1928-January 1933) and Pacific (February 1933–January 1938) Fleets. In January 1938, she was temporarily assigned to the Asiatic Fleet, receiving permanent assignment there seven months later. Home ported at Cavite, Philippine Islands, she cruised the Sea of Japan and the South and East China seas as tension, political and military, rapidly increased in the Far East.

==World War II==
&quot;About on 24 November 1941,&quot; her war diary reported, &quot;the Commander–in–Chief, US Asiatic Fleet sensed that the relations between the United States and Japan had reached such a critical state that movement of men–of–war...was indicated.&quot; The next day, &quot;Marblehead&quot;, with Task Force 5 (TF 5), departed Manila Bay for seemingly &quot;routine weekly operations.&quot; She anchored at Tarakan, Borneo on 29 November, and waited for further instructions. On 8 December, (7 December in the United States) she received the message &quot;Japan started hostilities; govern yourselves accordingly.&quot;

===Battle of Makassar Strait, 1942===
&quot;Marblehead&quot; and other American warships then joined with those of the Royal Netherlands Navy and the Royal Australian Navy to patrol the waters surrounding the Netherlands East Indies and to screen Allied shipping moving south from the Philippines. On the night of 24 January 1942, &quot;Marblehead&quot; covered the withdrawal of a force of Dutch and American warships after they had attacked, with devastating effect, an enemy convoy off Balikpapan. Six days later, in an attempt to repeat this success, the force departed Surabaja, Java, to intercept an enemy convoy concentration at Kendari. The Japanese convoy, however, sailed soon after, and the Allied force changed course, anchoring in Bunda Roads on 2 February. On 4 February, the ships steamed out of Bunda Roads and headed for another Japanese convoy sighted at the southern entrance to the Makassar Straits. At 09:49, 36 enemy bombers were sighted closing in on the formation from the east.

In the ensuing Battle of Makassar Strait, &quot;Marblehead&quot; successfully maneuvered through three attacks. After the third, an enemy plane spiraled toward the cruiser, but her gunners shot it down. The next minute a fourth wave of seven bombers released bombs at &quot;Marblehead&quot;. Two were direct hits and a third a near miss close aboard the port bow causing severe underwater damage. Fires swept the ship as she listed to starboard and began to settle by the bow. Her rudder jammed, &quot;Marblehead&quot;, continuing to steam at full speed, circled to port. Her gunners kept firing, while damage control crews fought the fires and helped the wounded. By 1100, the fires were under control. Before noon the enemy planes departed, leaving the damaged cruiser with 15 dead or mortally wounded and 84 seriously injured.

&quot;Marblehead&quot;″s engineers soon released the rudder angle to 9° left, and at 12:55, she retired to Tjilatjap, steering by working the engines at varying speeds. She made Tjilatjap with a forward draft of , aft . Unable to be docked there, her worst leaks were repaired and she put to sea again on 13 February. Some of her wounded crew were taken off the ship to be cared for by Dr Corydon M. Wassell; he received the Navy Cross for protecting them from capture by the invading Japanese. When the ship left Tjilatjap it was on the first leg of a voyage of more than in search of complete repairs.

Still steering with her engines, she made Trincomalee, Ceylon on 21 February. Repairs could not be made there or anywhere in India for several weeks, so &quot;Marblehead&quot; departed for South Africa on 2 March. After touching at Durban and Port Elizabeth, &quot;Marblehead&quot; arrived at Simonstown on 24 March. There she underwent extensive repairs and on 15 April, sailed for New York. Steaming via Recife, Brazil, she finally arrived in New York on 4 May, completing a journey of over from where she was damaged in action and immediately entered drydock at the Brooklyn Navy Yard.

===Atlantic, Mediterranean, 1942–1944===
On 15 October, the rebuilt &quot;Marblehead&quot; again put to sea. Attached to the South Atlantic Force, she operated against the enemy in the South Atlantic from Recife and Bahia, Brazil, until February 1944. Returning to New York on 20 February, she operated along the convoy lanes of the North Atlantic for the next five months. She then sailed for the Mediterranean. Arriving at Palermo on 29 July, she joined the task force then staging for Operation Dragoon, the invasion of southern France. From 15 to 17 August, the cruiser bombarded enemy installations in the vicinity of Saint Raphael, where Allied assault troops were landing. On 18 August, she withdrew to Corsica, her mission complete.

==End of career==
&quot;Marblehead&quot; returned to the United States, conducted a summer training cruise for Naval Academy midshipmen and then entered the Philadelphia Naval Shipyard, where she decommissioned on 1 November 1945. Her name was struck from the Naval Vessel Register on 28 November, and her hull was scrapped on 27 February 1946.

<doc id="749048" wikidata="Q6127679" url="?curid=749048" title="USS Memphis (CL-13)">
<text>USS &quot;Memphis&quot; (CL-13) was an light cruiser, originally classified as a scout cruiser, of the United States Navy. She was the fourth Navy ship named for the city of Memphis, Tennessee.

One of the noted events of the ship was to do VIP transport, including Charles Lindbergh in 1927 to receive the Distinguished Flying Cross from President Calvin Coolidge, and President Franklin D. Roosevelt from the Casablanca conference in 1943, taking him to a flying boat for a transatlantic flight.

==Built in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania==
&quot;Memphis&quot; was authorized on 1 July 1918, and assigned to William Cramp &amp; Sons, Philadelphia on 24 January 1919. She was laid down on 14 October 1920, and launched on 17 April 1924, sponsored by Miss Elizabeth R. Paine, daughter of Mayor Rowlett Paine of Memphis. &quot;Memphis&quot; was commissioned on 4 February 1925, with future Admiral, Captain Henry E. Lackey in command.

&quot;Memphis&quot; was long at the waterline with an overall length of , her beam was and a mean draft of . Her standard displacement was and at full load. Her crew, during peace time, consisted of 29 officers and 429 enlisted men.

&quot;Memphis&quot; was powered by four Parsons steam turbines geared steam turbines, each driving one screw, using steam generated by 12 White-Forster boilers. The engines were designed to produce and reach a top speed of . She was designed to provide a range of at a speed of , but was only capable of at a speed of 
&quot;Memphis&quot;″s main armament went through many changes while she was being designed. Originally she was to mount ten /53 caliber guns; two on either side at the waist, with the remaining eight mounted in tiered casemates on either side of the fore and aft superstructures. After America&#x27;s entry into World War I the US Navy worked alongside the Royal Navy and it was decided to mount four 6-in/53 caliber guns in two twin gun turrets fore and aft and keep the eight guns in the tiered casemates so that she would have an eight gun broadside and, due to limited arcs of fire from the casemate guns, four to six guns firing fore or aft. Her secondary armament consisted of two /50 caliber anti-aircraft guns in single mounts. &quot;Memphis&quot; was initially built with the capacity to carry 224 mines, but these were removed early in her career to make way for more crew accommodations. She also carried two triple and two twin, above-water, torpedo tube mounts for torpedoes. The triple mounts were fitted on either side of the upper deck, aft of the aircraft catapults, and the twin mounts were one deck lower on either side, covered by hatches in the side of the hull.

The ship lacked a full-length waterline armor belt. The sides of her boiler and engine rooms and steering gear were protected by of armor. The transverse bulkheads at the end of her machinery rooms were thick forward and three inches thick aft. The deck over the machinery spaces and steering gear had a thickness of 1.5 inches. The gun turrets were not armored and only provided protection against muzzle blast and the conning tower had 1.5 inches of armor. &quot;Memphis&quot; carried two floatplanes aboard that were stored on the two catapults. Initially these were probably Vought VE-9s until the early 1930s when the ship may have operated OJ-2 until 1935 and Curtiss SOC Seagulls until 1940 when Vought OS2U Kingfishers were used on ships without hangars.

===Armament changes===
During her career &quot;Memphis&quot; went through several armament changes, some of these changes were to save weight, but others were to increase her AA armament. The lower torpedo tube mounts proved to be very wet and were removed, and the openings plated over, before the start of World War II. Another change made before the war was to increase the 3-inch guns to seven, all mounted in the ship&#x27;s waist. After 1940, the lower aft guns were removed and the casemates plated over for the same reason as the lower torpedo mounts. The ship&#x27;s anti-aircraft armament were augmented by two twin Bofors guns along with 12 Oerlikon cannons by the end of the war.

==Inter-war period==
Late in February, &quot;Memphis&quot; got underway for a shakedown cruise in the Caribbean. On 13 April, the cruiser participated in the dedication of an American memorial gateway to Commodore Oliver Hazard Perry at Port of Spain, Trinidad. Six years after the indomitable Perry had defeated the British on Lake Erie on 10 September 1813, he died on board frigate &quot;John Adams&quot; at Port–of–Spain and was interred there until his remains were removed to Newport, R.I. seven years later. In June, &quot;Memphis&quot; joined ships of a scouting fleet off Honolulu, Hawaii, for a cruise to the South Pacific through September, with visits to Australia and New Zealand. From October 1925 to April 1926, she again operated in the West Indies before returning to her home port, New York City.

&quot;Memphis&quot; next sailed for Europe, arriving off St. Nazaire, France on 26 June 1926, and relieved as the flagship of Commander, US Naval Forces in Europe on 4 July. The new Commander, US Naval Forces in Europe was Vice-Admiral Guy Burrage. Vice-Admiral Burrage served as Commander, US Naval Forces in Europe from 1926 to 1928. &quot;Memphis&quot; operated in European waters into 1927. During a stay at Santander, Spain from 31 July to 31 August 1926, the ship was visited by King Alfonso XIII.

On 3 June 1927, &quot;Memphis&quot; embarked Captain Charles A. Lindbergh and his aeroplane &#x27;Spirit of St Louis&#x27; at Southampton, England, following his nonstop flight from New York to Paris. The next day the cruiser departed Cherbourg, France, arriving Washington, D.C., on 11 June, to debark her famous passenger at the Washington Navy Yard. For the rest of the year she performed surveillance duty along the Atlantic coast.

In January 1928, &quot;Memphis&quot; acted as part of an escort group for President Calvin Coolidge on a cruise to the West Indies. After four months of Caribbean operations, she served in the western Pacific as part of Light Cruiser Division TWO attached to the Asiatic Fleet along with and .

On 5 June, the cruiser arrived at Balboa, Canal Zone for duty off Central America to May 1933. &quot;Memphis&quot; operated in a peacekeeping capacity at Corinto, Nicaragua, during the inauguration of President Juan Bautista Sacasa in 1932. In the next five years she alternated duty along the west coast with patrols to the troubled area of the West Indies.

After a good will cruise to Australia in January 1938, &quot;Memphis&quot; reached Honolulu on 1 April, to rejoin the fleet for operations until she participated in the presidential review off San Francisco on 12 July 1939. In August, she sailed to Alaska, operating there until early 1941.

==World War II==

As the time of US involvement in World War II approached, &quot;Memphis&quot; sailed to the east coast. She departed Newport on 24 April 1941, to take part in the neutrality patrol of the ocean triangle Trinidad–Cape San Roque–Cape Verde Islands, arriving Recife, Brazil, on 10 May. She continued operations in the South Atlantic for most of the war. In March 1942, the ship escorted two Army transports in convoy to Ascension Island, where the Army&#x27;s 38th Engineer General Service Regiment debarked to construct an airport as staging point for planes flying from the United States to Africa. By May, she was on patrol near the entrance to Fort-de-France, Martinique.
In January 1943, the cruiser flew President Franklin Delano Roosevelt&#x27;s flag off Bathurst, Gambia, during the Casablanca Conference from 14 to 24 January. The President and British Prime Minister Winston Churchill outlined plans at that time for the invasion of Sicily and Italy. From February–September, &quot;Memphis&quot; was once more on patrol duty against blockade runners, mostly off Bahia and Recife, Brazil.

President Amenzoga of Uruguay, and President Getúlio Vargas of Brazil toured the ship in January 1944, while their countries continued to give valuable aid in blockading the &quot;Atlantic Narrows&quot;. The following year &quot;Memphis&quot; sailed for Europe, arriving Naples, Italy, on 16 January 1945. On 27 January, as flagship for Admiral Harold R. Stark, Commander, US Naval Forces in Europe, she got underway for Valletta, Malta, scene of preliminary Allied conferences prior to the Yalta Conference in February. Before the end of January the cruiser had two important visitors: Fleet Admiral Ernest J. King and General of the Army George C. Marshall.

On 18 February, &quot;Memphis&quot; arrived at Algiers for President Roosevelt&#x27;s last Allied conference before his return to the United States. For the next eight months, she continued to receive distinguished leaders. She participated in the first anniversary ceremonies of the Allied landings at St. Raphael and St. Tropez, southern France on 15 August, and the Navy Day festivities at Naples, Italy, on 27 October. Late in November, &quot;Memphis&quot; departed Tangier for Philadelphia, where she decommissioned on 17 December. She was struck from the Naval Vessel Register on 8 January 1946, and sold to Patapsco Scrap Co., Bethlehem, Pa. on 18 December, for scrapping following delivery on 10 January 1947.

<text>is a dry Japanese condiment sprinkled on top of cooked rice, vegetables, and fish, or used as an ingredient in . It typically consists of a mixture of dried fish, sesame seeds, chopped seaweed, sugar, salt, and monosodium glutamate. Other ingredients, such as (sometimes indicated on the package as bonito), (bonito flakes moistened with soy sauce and dried again), freeze-dried salmon particles, , egg, powdered miso, or vegetables, are often added.

 is often brightly colored and flaky. It can have a slight fish or seafood flavoring and may be spicy and/or sweet. It can be used in Japanese cooking for pickling and for rice balls ().

==Overview==
The Japan Furikake Association defines &quot;furikake&quot; as &quot;seasoned and dried one or more kinds of marine products, agricultural products, livestock products, etc., and mixed with seaweed, sesame seeds, seasonings, and others. Its main use is sprinkled (in Japanese: &quot;furikake&quot;) on rice and other foods.&quot;

According to this definition, &quot;Gomashio&quot; (sesame salt), which is traditionally sprinkled on Red bean rice, and shiso, after being used to season &quot;umeboshi&quot; (pickled plums) and dried and powdered, are also &quot;furikake&quot;. &quot;Chazuke-no-moto&quot;, a mixture that becomes &quot;chazuke&quot; when hot green tea is poured on it after sprinkling on rice, is also similar to &quot;furikake&quot;.

==History==
In Japan, an herb sprinkling powder on rice or other food has long been called &quot;furikake&quot;. For example, an article titled &quot;Picnic &quot;Bento&quot;&quot; published in 1925 describes how to make &quot;onigiri&quot;: &quot;Make a small onigiri of warm rice and &quot;furikake&quot; a little roasted-sesame on it.&quot;

The term &quot;furikake&quot; became established in the 1950s, but there were equivalent foods to it even before that.

The 13th-century culinary treatise &quot;Chujiruiki&quot; (厨事類記) lists shredded and dried red seabream, salmon, and shark meat, as well as thin slices of &quot;katsuobushi&quot;, as garnishes for rice.

Gomashio, which is still commonly eaten today, is made by roasting sesame seeds and mixing them with baked salt, and appears in an ancient document, &quot;Diary of Ishiyama Hongan-ji&quot; at 1536, under the name &quot;gomashio.&quot; In that document, it is written that &quot;on March 3, sekihan (red rice) was served at the celebration, and gomashio was placed on top of it.&quot;

&quot;Denbu&quot; (田麩), a food made by boiling powdered dried bonito flakes in sake and soy sauce, appears in an ancient 17th-century document called &quot;Kokin Ryouri-shu&quot; (&quot;Collection of Ancient and Modern Cookbooks&quot;).

Tsukudani (佃煮), which appears in the 19th century colloquial dictionary &quot;Risogonshuran&quot; (俚言集覧) compiled by Ota Zensai (太田全斎), is made by boiling down small fish, shellfish, seaweed, and other ingredients in soy sauce to a rich flavor. The use of tsukudani is similar to furikake, but it is not usually called furikake in Japan today.

The modern furikake was invented by several companies between the 1900s and 1920s for the purpose of tasty nourishment. Regarding modern furikake, the Japan Furikake Association recognized Futaba&#x27;s &quot;Gohan no Tomo&quot; as the original in 1994, but revoked this recognition in 2022 and is conducting a reexamination. The association&#x27;s conclusion has not been reached as of 2023.

One account of the origin of is that it was developed during the Taishō period (1912–1926) by a pharmacist in Kumamoto prefecture named . To address calcium deficiency in the Japanese population, Yoshimaru developed a mixture of ground fish bones with roast sesame seeds, poppy seeds, and seaweed that was made into a powder. This product, which he called , is generally considered the precursor to contemporary . A food company in Kumamoto later acquired the product and was able to sell it commercially. It was initially sold in a flask-like container shaped with a narrow neck to prevent moisture from seeping into the product.

Another theory is that in 1916, Tanaka Foods developed &quot;Travel Friend&quot;(旅行の友) in cans at the request of the military as a nutritional supplement. This is a blend of dried small fish powder seasoned with soy sauce, sesame, seaweed, and egg.

In 1927, a grocery retailer in Fukushima City named Seiichirō Kai developed a mixture consisting of &quot;ishimochi&quot; (silver white croaker, &quot;Pennahia argentata&quot;) with soy sauce seasoning, kelp, and sesame seeds. He founded the Marumiya Food Research Institute.
 Kai called his product ; it was popular on its release. Although was initially considered a luxury item for the affluent who were able to consume white rice on a regular basis, it later was made accessible to the Japanese working class.

The availability of in Japan increased starting shortly after September 1948, when Nissin Foods began to manufacture it on a large scale to address pervasive malnourishment. The product was commercialized on the basis that it provided a good source of protein and calcium. was made widely available as it was dispensed to those serving in the Japanese military starting in World War I.

The term was used generically to describe the product starting in 1959 with the formation of the National Association. Since 1959, products are usually differentiated by their particular ingredients, such as salmon and sesame-and-salt .

In the same year, Marumiya Foods developed &quot;Noritama,&quot; a sweetened egg added to which became popular as &quot;furikake&quot; for children. In 1963, &quot;Noritama&quot; with a sticker of 8 Man became explosively popular, and &quot;furikake&quot; was transformed from a luxury food for adults to a popular food for children.

In 1970, Mishima Shokuhin marketed a new &quot;furikake&quot;, made by reusing the red shiso used to color pickled plums, under the product name &quot;Yukari&quot;. The name comes from the desire to create a connection (&quot;縁&quot; (yukari) in Japanese) with customers.

In the 1980s, &quot;furikake&quot; became strongly associated with children&#x27;s food, and its use rapidly declined after the age of 12. In 1989, Nagatanien began selling &quot;furikake for adults&quot; using ingredients with a luxurious taste and pungent flavor. The initial varieties were &quot;Salmon,&quot; &quot;Bonito,&quot; and &quot;Wasabi.&quot;

==Manufacturers==
Marumiya has been selling &quot;furikake&quot; since 1927, and according to a 2021 &quot;The Nikkei&quot; survey, 11 of its products are among the top 20 value share about products in large bags. The product names include &quot;Noritama&quot;, &quot;Ajidoraku&quot;, &quot;Soft Furikake&quot;, &quot;Sukiyaki&quot;, and &quot;Honkatsuo.&quot;

Nagatanien sells &quot;furikake&quot; that is divided into individual servings. Its main products are &quot;Furikake for Adult&quot;, &quot;Furikake for Adult Mini&quot;, and &quot;Anpanman Furikake.&quot; However, Nagatanien&#x27;s market share is far behind that of Marumiya.

Mishima Shokuhin&#x27;s &quot;furikake&quot; products include &quot;Yukari&quot; and &quot;Umeko,&quot; and four of the aforementioned top 20 products in large bags are &quot;Yukari&quot; and one is &quot;Umeko.

<text>USS &quot;Alert&quot; was a steamship named &quot;A. C. Powell&quot; purchased by the Union Navy during the first year of the American Civil War.

&quot;A. C. Powell&quot; – later renamed &quot;Alert&quot;, and still later renamed &quot;Watch&quot; – served primarily as a tugboat, but at times she performed duty as a dispatch boat, ship&#x27;s tender, and even as a gunboat despite the fact that she had on board only a howitzer instead of a cannon or rifle.

==Built in New York in 1861==
&quot;Alert&quot; – a screw tugboat built in 1861 at Syracuse, New York., under the name &quot;A. C. Powell&quot; – was purchased at New York City by the Navy on 3 October 1861.

==Civil War service==

===&quot;A. C. Powell&quot; early blockade support===
Since this small tug&#x27;s logs prior to 27 January 1865 have been lost, there are several significant gaps in our knowledge of her career. All we know of &quot;A. C. Powell&quot;″s service until early in the summer of 1862 is that she was operating in the sounds of North Carolina on 13 March 1862. We next hear of her on 30 June, when she was detached from the Potomac River Flotilla for duty in the North Atlantic Blockading Squadron.
The reassignment was prompted by Confederate General Robert E. Lee&#x27;s success in the Seven Days campaign which turned back General George McClellan&#x27;s Union Army before Richmond, Virginia, and forced it to seek safety on the banks of the James River under the protection of Federal gunboats. &quot;A. C. Powell&quot; was one of several ships of the Union Navy sent to the James to assure Union control of that indispensable waterway.

===&quot;A. C. Powell&quot; renamed USS &quot;Alert&quot;===
While the tug was operating on that river, she was renamed &quot;Alert&quot;. Late in 1862, President Abraham Lincoln decided to withdraw the Army of the Potomac from the peninsula formed by the James and York Rivers and return it to the vicinity of Washington, D.C. to protect the Union capital which was threatened by Lee&#x27;s Army of Northern Virginia.

U.S. Secretary of the Navy Gideon Welles called &quot;Alert&quot; back to the Potomac River to strengthen the forces which were to meet Lee, but the steamer was undergoing repairs at Newport News, Virginia, and was unable to get underway until after Union soldiers had stopped Lee at Antietam Creek. With Lee&#x27;s decision to retire into Virginia, the need for &quot;Alert&quot; in the Potomac disappeared, and she remained in the North Atlantic Blockading Squadron.

===Service on the James River===
During most of the remainder of her service, the tug acted as a dispatch and picket boat on the James River. She also made occasional runs to the sounds of North Carolina with messages. During these operations, Confederate forces in the waters she frequented were constantly endeavoring to seize Union warships or to destroy them by guile. For instance, on 12 November 1862, Captain Thomas Turner, the senior Union naval officer in the Hampton Roads-Norfolk area, warned &quot;Alert&quot; that

. . . the enemy is preparing ... an expedition of armed launches [to be] sent down close inshore in the darkness of the night until they get abreast of you.

The admonition for &quot;. . . the officers and men to be constantly on the watch ...&quot; was especially important since &quot;Alert&quot; often served as tender to , the flag steamer of Acting Rear Admiral Samuel Phillips Lee who commanded the Union squadron.
Union warships on the James also cooperated with Army forces. In mid January 1863, Major General John Adams Dix notified Admiral Lee that there were &quot;... indications of activity on the part of the enemy . . .&quot; in the Dismal Swamp-Suffolk area. Since a major Confederate movement in that vicinity could jeopardize the entire Union hold on the south bank of the James, Admiral Lee ordered &quot;Alert&quot; and her sister warships to ready themselves to help turn back the Southern thrust should it come.

===Nansemond River expedition===
Almost three months passed before that particular threat materialized. Early in April, General Lee detached Lieutenant General James Longstreet&#x27;s corps from the Army of Northern Virginia to forage for supplies. Longstreet, apparently hoping to improve the South&#x27;s strategic position while finding food for General Lee&#x27;s soldiers, headed for Suffolk. When the Union Army called on the Navy for help, Admiral Lee ordered Lieutenant William B.Cushing to lead a group of gunboats up the Nansemond River – a tributary of the James – to assist Major General John J. Peck&#x27;s troops as they tried to stop Longstreet&#x27;s advance.
&quot;Alert&quot; ascended the Nansemond with Lt. William B.Cushing on 12 April, and for the next three weeks participated in almost daily duels with Confederate shore batteries. Because of her light draft, she moved above the bar of the river into the narrower, shallower, and more dangerous part of the stream near Suffolk where the fighting was fiercest. The afternoon of the next day, her rudder was severely damaged, requiring her to return briefly to Norfolk to have it replaced. The repair work was completed on the afternoon of the 16th, and the tug returned to the Nansemond and fought there through the end of the month.
Her vigorous fight and that of her sister ships prevented the Southern forces from dislodging Major General Peck&#x27;s troops from their defensive works and finally prompted Longstreet to withdraw – a movement hastened by a message from General Lee, who was about to engage the Union Army at Chancellorsville.

===Attempt at conversion to torpedo boat===
On 31 August 1863, the tug caught fire while moored in the Norfolk Navy Yard and sank. She was soon raised, and by October had returned to duty. In January 1864, work to fit her with a torpedo apparatus began, but the experiment proved to be unsuccessful. As a result, the tug returned to duty in the James in May.

===Renamed USS &quot;Watch&quot;===
On 2 February 1865, &quot;Alert&quot; was renamed &quot;Watch&quot;. Her work on the James reached its climax early in April when she participated in the naval expedition to Richmond, which took President Lincoln to the former Confederate capital. Soon thereafter, she left that river and raced to the Potomac River, presumably to try to cut off the escape of the assassin, John Wilkes Booth, who had shot the President.

==Post-war decommissioning and subsequent career==
Following the collapse of the Confederacy, &quot;Watch&quot; was decommissioned at the Washington Navy Yard on 26 May. She was sold at auction there to Robert Lear on 5 July. Redocumented as &quot;Watch&quot; on 2 August, she served as a merchant tug until abandoned in 1886.

<text>Nunhead () is a suburb in the London Borough of Southwark, England. It is an inner-city suburb located southeast of Charing Cross. It is the location of the Nunhead Cemetery. Nunhead has traditionally been a working-class area and, with the adjacent neighbourhoods, is currently going through a lengthy process of gentrification. Nunhead is the location of several underground reservoirs, built by the Southwark and Vauxhall Waterworks Company.

==Etymology==
The name is first recorded in a deed of 1583 relating to a land sale including estates &quot;lying at Nunn-head.&quot; The origin of the name Nunhead is not certain but is believed to be derived from a local inn named variously &quot;The Nun&#x27;s Head or The Nunhead Tavern&quot;. Local historians and local legend maintain that this name refers to the beheading of a nun during the Dissolution of the Monasteries.

The legend claims that the head of the Mother Superior of a nunnery, which stood where the current public house The Old Nun&#x27;s Head now stands, was placed on a spike on the green following her death. There is no evidence to support this claim. However, a nunnery in the area may have been connected with the nunnery of The Augustinian Priory of St. John the Baptist, Holywell (now Shoreditch) which acquired lands in Camberwell and Peckham in the 12th century.

==History==

A rural settlement of approximately ten buildings named &quot;NoneHead&quot; is clearly visible in the 1762 map titled &quot;A topographical map of the county of Surrey&quot; by John Roque. The settlement occupies the land which is now Nunhead Green and Nunhead High Street. At the time it was separated from the nearby settlement of Peckham Rye by fields and the now covered River Peck.

In 1834 the Girdlers Company built the Beeston&#x27;s Gift Almshouses, a terrace of seven Tudor-style cottages which still stand in front of a garden with railings on Consort road. Further almshouses were built in 1853 by the Asylum of the Metropolitan Beer and Wine Trade Association on the edge of Nunhead Green to provide housing for aged members of the trade. In 1868, Brocks Fireworks, a manufacturer of fireworks, built a firework &#x27;manufactory&#x27; close to where the pub, The Pyrotechnists Arms, still stands. The pub is so-named because of its original proximity to the firework factory.

Until 1878, Nunhead formed part of the large ancient parish of Camberwell in the Brixton hundred of Surrey. The area&#x27;s population growth led to a separate ecclesiastical parish of St Antholin, Nunhead, being formed in 1878, with the church built in 1877. The area then came within the area of responsibility of the Metropolitan Board of Works in 1855 and was transferred to the County of London in 1889. In 1887 Nunhead is recorded as having a population of 10,727. Having formed part of the Camberwell parish, it became part of the Metropolitan Borough of Camberwell in 1900.

There was a Nunhead Football Club from 1888 to 1949. Nunhead has some fine examples of late Victorian/early Edwardian properties; these can be seen on both Carden Road and Tresco Road. It is even reputed, in Claire Tomalin&#x27;s biography of Charles Dickens&#x27; mistress Nelly Ternan, that Charles Dickens was taken on his death bed from the house he rented for Ternan, at Windsor Lodge in Linden Grove to Gad&#x27;s Hill to die. The house no longer stands, but was at 31 Linden Grove. Old maps show that the church was next door to where the dental surgery now stands at 42 Linden Grove, so Windsor Lodge was presumably more or less opposite that.

== St Antholin&#x27;s, Nunhead ==
St Antholin church was built in 1877. Built in red brick it is large and rectangular and was built in the style of the first part of the 13th century. The church was built with funds from the sale of the site of St. Antholin&#x27;s, Budge Row, which was demolished in 1875. The oak reredos designed by Sir Christopher Wren and a bell were brought from the original church. The church was damaged by bombing in 1940 and later restored by Lawrence King. The church was reconsecrated in 1957 and officially renamed St Antony&#x27;s Church in 1958.

St Antony&#x27;s was Listed Grade II in 1972 but became surplus to requirements of the Anglican Church and was declared redundant in 2001 and sold to its present owners, a Pentecostal congregation. It then became the Lighthouse Cathedral. The bell from the original St Antholin&#x27;s now hangs in St Silas, Nunhead.

==Regeneration==
Nunhead forms part of Southwark London Borough Council&#x27;s &quot;Peckham Programme&quot; regeneration scheme. As part of this plan, the area forms part of the East Peckham and Nunhead renewal area. A component was the proposal that the Cross River Tram could serve the area, however in November 2008 Mayor of London Boris Johnson announced that due to funding constraints this project would be cancelled.

==Transport==
Nunhead railway station is located on Gibbon Road. It is on the line from Blackfriars to Sevenoaks and Victoria to Dartford. Services are provided by Southeastern and Thameslink. The area is also served by a variety of London Buses services. Bus route 78 starts in Nunhead and terminates in Shoreditch running via the commercial area surrounding Liverpool Street as well as going over famous Tower Bridge and bypassing the historical Tower of London. The P12, which begins its journey in Honor Oak Park, goes through Nunhead, terminating at Surrey Quays shopping centre. As part of the urban sprawl of London, Nunhead is contiguous with the neighbourhoods of Brockley to the east, Honor Oak to the south, East Dulwich to the south west, Peckham to the north west and New Cross to the north east.

==Politics==
Most of Nunhead falls within the Peckham Westminster constituency. The current MP is Miatta Fahnbulleh of the Labour Co-op party. 

The constituency forms part of the Lambeth and Southwark London Assembly constituency represented by Marina Ahmad of Labour.

Residents elect three councillors to Southwark Council every four years for the Nunhead and Queen&#x27;s Road ward.














Althea Smith was elected in 2010 for the Labour Party, but defected to the All People&#x27;s Party.

==Culture==
Nunhead Cemetery Open Day occurs every May and is organised by Friends of Nunhead Cemetery.

Nunhead Beats the Bounds is an annual event where Nunhead residents march around the perimeter of Nunhead - from Queens Road to Camberwell New Cemetery - to build community spirit. It is generally held the first Saturday afternoon in July.

Nunhead American Radio with Lewis Schaffer on Resonance 104.4FM is a radio programme for and about the residents of Nunhead, with special focus on the immigrant American community.

The Nunhead Art Trail is an art and craft showcase organised by volunteers. Nunhead artists and craftspeople exhibit their work in their flats, houses and gardens allowing the public to view and buy the work.

David Fenton Michie Todd was born in Middletown, Ohio, on February 22, 1915. He graduated from Dartmouth College in 1937 before receiving his bachelor&#x27;s degree in architecture from the University of Michigan in 1940. He married Suzanne Williams in 1942.

Todd served in the United States Army in the Pacific during World War II.

== Career ==
David Todd joined the Harrison, Ballard &amp; Allen architectural firm in 1946, following the end of World War II. He became a full partner in the firm in 1967, and it was renamed Ballard, Todd &amp; Snibbe. In 1967 the firm was simply known as David Todd &amp; Associates.

Some of Todd&#x27;s notable clients included the State University of New York, Princeton University, Lehman College, the Collegiate School on the Upper West Side of Manhattan, as well as vacation resorts in St. Martin and Puerto Rico. However, Todd&#x27;s personal interest in architecture often centered on theaters and public housing. Todd advocated that money be spent to improve the living conditions in subsidized public housing beginning in 1965.

===Manhattan Plaza===
Todd&#x27;s architectural firm&#x27;s best-known project was the Manhattan Plaza. The design for the Manhattan Plaza, which was designed by David Todd and Robert Cabrera, called for two large, 45 story red brick apartment buildings on either end of the block, with lower buildings in between them. The Manhattan Plaza project encompasses a single large, city square block surrounded 42nd Street and 43rdd Street and Ninth Avenue and Tenth Avenue.

Todd explained his choice to place the large apartment buildings on the ends of the block, rather than the center of it, saying that, &quot;Larger structures in midblock would have cut the sunlight and would have destroyed the small scale of the midblock areas as well.&quot;

== Death ==
David Todd died in Manhattan on March 31, 2008, at the age of 93. He was survived by his wife, Suzanne Williams.

<text>USS &quot;Worcester&quot; (CL-144) was a light cruiser in the United States Navy. It was the third ship to carry that name, honoring the city of Worcester, Massachusetts. &quot;Worcester&quot; was the lead ship of the &quot;Worcester&quot;-class of light cruisers. It was launched just after the close of World War II and decommissioned in 1958.

==Description and design==

The &quot;Worcester&quot; combined destroyer maneuverability with cruiser size, with a main battery that could engage both surface targets and aircraft. The design was largely considered a failure, due to the main armament of twin automatic guns achieving fire rates of 9-10 rpm which was lower than the similar design of automatic guns on . In addition, the fire control fitted to &quot;Worcester&quot; was optimized for anti-aircraft fire rather than surface action or naval gunfire support.

== Construction and career ==
&quot;Worcester&quot; was laid down on 29 January 1945 at Camden, New Jersey, by the New York Shipbuilding and Dry dock Corp, and launched on 4 February 1947. Sponsored by Gloria Ann Sullivan, the daughter of Mayor Charles F. Sullivan of Worcester, Massachusetts, she was commissioned at the Philadelphia Naval Shipyard on 26 June 1948.

&quot;Worcester was&quot; assigned to Cruiser Division 10. She spent the first year of her commissioned service completing her fitting out, conducting shakedown training, undergoing availability and type training off the eastern seaboard of the United States. In the summer of 1949, she participated in her first large-scale training exercises in Guantanamo Bay and visited Kingston, Jamaica. Later that summer, she sailed for the Mediterranean, departing Newport, Rhode Island, on 6 September and reaching Gibraltar 10 days later. She made her first deployment with the 6th Fleet in the ensuing months, visiting Malta; Bizerte, Tunisia; Golfe-Juan, France; Argostoli and Phaleron Bay, Greece; İskenderun, Turkey; Trieste and Venice, Italy; and Gibraltar. During her 6th Fleet deployment, she engaged in exercises and maneuvers with fast carrier task forces, including the carrier and the heavy cruiser . She returned to Norfolk, Virginia on 10 December.

&quot;Worcester&quot; operated off the eastern seaboard, ranging from Newport to Norfolk and south to Puerto Rico, with visits in between to Philadelphia, before she began her second 6th Fleet deployment in the spring of 1950. She departed Norfolk on 3 May, arrived at Lisbon on 13 May, and entered the Mediterranean soon thereafter.

In between her cycles of drills and exercises in the Mediterranean, &quot;Worcester&quot; visited Augusta, Sicily; Bizerte; Genoa and La Spezia, Italy; and Golfe Juan, on the southern coast of France, before she was put into Phaleron Bay on 20 July. She was there only for a week before she received orders to sail for the Far East. While the light cruiser and her consorts had been operating in the Mediterranean, war had broken out in Korea on 25 June. Accordingly, Worcester departed Phaleron Bay on 27 July, in company with Destroyer Division 21 composed of , , , and . Reaching Port Said, Egypt, on the morning of 29 July, &quot;Worcester&quot; transited the Suez Canal that afternoon.

Reaching Colombo for provisions and fuel, &quot;Worcester&quot; and her escorts tarried there from 7 August to 9 August before pushing on towards the Malacca Strait. They then proceeded through the Bashi Channel to Buckner Bay, Okinawa, where they arrived on 19 August. En route, the American warships had been diverted through the Bashi Channel to be available to counter any invasion attempt by the communist Chinese of Formosa.

After fueling from , &quot;Worcester&quot; departed Buckner Bay on 20 August and set a course for Keelung, Formosa, to join the Formosa Patrol.

Joining that force on 21 August, &quot;Worcester&quot; remained at anchor at Keelung from 22 through 26 August. She got underway the following day to add her anti-aircraft defense to the screen of Task Force (TF) 77—the fast carrier task force consisting of and , then operating in the Yellow Sea off the coast of Korea.

On 28 August, the light cruiser—steaming in company with &quot;Norris&quot;—joined TF 77 and proceeded into the Yellow Sea for operations against enemy targets located in central and southwestern Korea. Each day in the ensuing days, the carriers launched their strikes against North Korean ground targets while the screen provided protection in case of any attempts by the North Korean air forces to interrupt the operation. &quot;Worcester&quot;″s helicopter also performed plane-guard duty, standing by in the air to rescue any ditched pilots from the waters nearby.

On 4 September, &quot;Worcester&quot;″s radar picked up an unidentified contact at 13:31. The combat air patrol—four Vought F4U Corsairs from &quot;Valley Forge&quot;—soon reported the stranger as being a twin-engine bomber with a pointed nose, a single tailfin, and high inverted gull wings. It also bore red star markings. At 19:45, the F4Us vectored to the &quot;bogey&quot; by and shot down the plane 49 miles away.

The following day, &quot;Worcester&quot; went to general quarters at 11:08 and commenced maneuvering at to avoid possible attack when her radar picked up an unidentified plane closing the formation from the east. Three minutes later, the cruiser fired a warning shot of three rounds of 6-inch projectiles in the direction of the intruder—it turned out to be a British Short Sunderland flying boat on patrol. At 21:43, &quot;Worcester&quot; secured from battle stations and resumed her cruising with TF 77.

There was one more day of flight operations off the Korean coast, 6 September, before &quot;Worcester&quot; transferred her helicopter to &quot;Philippine Sea&quot; to clear the ship for a practice anti-aircraft firing. The cruiser later recovered the helicopter before heading for Sasebo, Japan, for replenishment of fuel, ammunition, stores, and provisions.

&quot;Worcester&quot; remained at Sasebo from 7 to 10 September and got underway at 05:32 on 11 September, again with TF 77, and proceeded to the operation area in the Yellow Sea to support a large-scale amphibious assault by United Nations (UN) forces against enemy forces in the Inchon and Seoul areas of Korea.

&quot;Worcester&quot; subsequently supported the Inchon landing — an attack aimed at outflanking the North Korean invaders by a strategic landing behind their lines in South Korea masterminded by General Douglas MacArthur. &quot;Worcester&quot; screened the fast carrier task forces as their planes dropped lethal loads on North Korean targets ashore until she was detached on 20 September to conduct a shore bombardment mission as part of TG 95.2 in the vicinity of Pohang Dong. Proceeding to the objective via the straits north of the Quelpart Islands and west of Tsushima, the light cruiser rendezvoused with three miles off the east coast of Korea and 12 miles north of Pohang Dong.

Over the following days, &quot;Worcester&quot; patrolled off the coast with TG 95.2. She relieved &quot;Helena&quot; in her fire support duties at 06:00 on 24 September, freeing the heavy cruiser to proceed to Sasebo. While her own helicopter was aloft providing anti-submarine screening, &quot;Worcester&quot; commenced firing at 08:05, shelling nine North Korean troop concentrations ashore. Directed by Korean Military Advisory Group (KMAG) personnel ashore, &quot;Worcester&quot; delivered call-fire throughout the day with pinpoint accuracy at troop concentrations and command posts. Relieved by as fire support ship, &quot;Worcester&quot; patrolled in company with to seaward of the fire support area for the night.

&quot;Worcester&quot; returned the following day and resumed her fire support duties, harassing the retreating North Korean forces. Throughout 25 September, &quot;Worcester&quot;—using KMAG spotting from shore—delivered fire support for the advancing UN forces, breaking up communist troop concentrations with 6-inch fire. As the ship&#x27;s war diary at one point recorded: &quot;Spotter reported troops dispersed. KMAG reported that all firing has been very effective and instrumental in enemy retreat.&quot;

&quot;Worcester&quot; spent the night hours on 25 September and into 26 September patrolling eight miles of a stretch of coast between Yonghae and Utchin. The rapid advance of the UN forces on 26 September obviated fire support from &quot;Worcester&quot;″s guns; but the cruiser received word that &quot;Brush&quot; had hit a naval mine off Tanchon, North Korea, at 12:20. While &quot;Samuel N. Moore&quot; took over the on-call fire support duties in the vicinity, &quot;Worcester&quot; sailed at and went to &quot;Brush&quot;″s aid.

The cruiser found &quot;Brush&quot; down by the bow with a 3-degree port list. There were five dead and 30 injured. At 01:01 on 27 September, &quot;Worcester&quot; commenced taking on board the more seriously wounded of the destroyer&#x27;s company via highline transfer, eventually receiving 15 stretcher cases—all men suffering from burns—by 02:28. The cruiser then altered course for Japan and, later that day, took on board four more stretcher patients, six ambulatory patients, and a corpse. At that time, two hospitalmen—who had been transferred from &quot;Worcester&quot; to &quot;Brush&quot; to tend the wounded on the destroyer—returned to the cruiser.

Proceeding in company with the crippled &quot;Brush&quot;, , and , &quot;Worcester&quot; headed for Sasebo and reached port on 29 September. As she was being made fast to her buoy in Sasebo harbor, &quot;Worcester&quot; received a message from the destroyer that she had aided: &quot;With us you are not only big league but world champions. The kindness, consideration and eagerness to help &quot;Worcester&#x27;s&quot; ship&#x27;s company will never be forgotten by the &quot;Brush&quot;.&quot;

The stay in Sasebo, however, proved a short one for &quot;Worcester&quot;, because she got underway on the 30th to return to Korean waters to resume her fire support and interdiction duties. At 06:00 on 1 October, &quot;Worcester&quot; joined the blockading force off the east coast of Korea, south of the 41st parallel, ready to render gunfire support for UN troops advancing against North Korean forces. As she patrolled off the coast, &quot;Worcester&quot; launched her helicopter to conduct anti-submarine and anti-mine patrols and frequently stationed lookouts in the bows of the ship, their eyes peeled for mines. Periodically, the screening destroyers found and destroyed mines drifting nearby.

&quot;Worcester&quot;—having served as flagship for TG 95.2, Rear Admiral Charles C. Hartman embarked—arrived back at Sasebo for replenishment on 8 October and fueled there before disembarking Rear Admiral Hartman. While still at Sasebo, &quot;Worcester&quot; became a flagship again the next day when Rear Admiral Allan E. Smith, Commander, TF 95 came aboard. At 12:48 on 10 October, &quot;Worcester&quot; got underway to return to the east coast of Korea—this time to screen minesweeping operations at the port of Wonsan and to support the advance of the 3rd Republic of Korea (ROK) Army Division.

Early on the next day, the British destroyer , the Australian destroyer , and the Canadian destroyer joined &quot;Worcester&quot;″s group which already included the British light cruiser HMS &quot;Ceylon&quot; and the heavy cruiser &quot;Helena&quot; besides the American warships , , and . On 12 October, the battleship joined.

While &quot;Missouri&quot;″s helicopter searched the projected bombardment track for mines, the UN force formed up for battle. At 11:50, when a shell from an unobserved shore battery fell short of the group, it apparently signaled the beginning. &quot;Worcester&quot; hoisted the blue and white UN flag to the foretruck and commenced firing at exactly noon on 12 October. For almost the next 90-odd minutes, &quot;Worcester&quot;″s 6-inch guns hammered at iron works and railroad tunnels in the vicinity. The next day, she extended her target list to include railroad marshalling yards, tearing up sections of track and blasting rolling stock.

Over the next few days, &quot;Worcester&quot; and the ships accompanying her proceeded to rain destruction on targets of opportunity near Wonsan—targets that ranged from railroad marshalling yards to rolling stock and adjacent warehouse areas. Also, on 16 October, &quot;Worcester&quot;, &quot;Helena&quot;, and accompanying destroyers fired at unidentified radar contacts—&quot;blips&quot; on the radar screens that approached from the northward.

After returning to Sasebo, &quot;Worcester&quot; returned briefly to Wonsan to transfer mail, passengers, and her helicopter unit to Rochester on 21 October, before she sailed from Wonsan at 17:23 on that day, in company with &quot;Helena&quot; and screened by and . Joined later by , &quot;Worcester&quot; parted company with the others and, escorted only by &quot;Collett&quot;, headed for Sasebo where, upon arrival, Rear Admiral Smith disembarked and shifted his flag to the destroyer tender .

&quot;Worcester&quot; completed the transfer of helicopter personnel, spares, and equipment to Fleet Activities, Sasebo, and, at 17:01 on 23 October, headed for Yokosuka. She reached that port at 08:23 two days later. After replenishment, liberty for her crew, and the cleaning of two boilers, the light cruiser left the Far East on 27 October, bound for Pearl Harbor. The day after she sailed, &quot;Worcester&quot; received a dispatch from Admiral C. Turner Joy, Commander, Naval Forces, Far East, which said: &quot;Upon the &quot;Worcester&quot;″s departure from the Far East I wish to extend a hearty &#x27;well done&#x27; to the entire ship&#x27;s company. Your rapid deployment from the European station to the Far East, followed by your immediate and most effective participation in the Korean effort, clearly demonstrates that your status of war readiness was excellent.&quot;

Returning to Philadelphia on 21 November—via Pearl Harbor and the Panama Canal—&quot;Worcester&quot; later spent six days at Norfolk, 23 to 29 November, before she was overhauled at the Boston Naval Shipyard from 1 December 1950 to 20 March 1951. After another brief period at Norfolk from 22 to 30 March, the light cruiser operated at Guantanamo Bay on refresher training for nearly a month before she headed back to Norfolk. Departing that port on 15 May, &quot;Worcester&quot; headed for the Mediterranean and her third deployment to the 6th Fleet.

&quot;Worcester&quot; conducted four more 6th Fleet &quot;Med&quot; deployments into the mid-1950s and twice visited northern European ports. During that time, she participated in fleet maneuvers and exercises and paid good-will calls on many ports—ranging from Bergen, Norway; to Copenhagen, Denmark; to Dublin, Ireland; and Portsmouth, England. Between her foreign deployments were operations closer to home: local operations out of eastern seaboard ports like Boston and Norfolk. In addition, the ship also plied the warmer waters of the Caribbean and West Indies, ranging from Guantanamo Bay to Kingston, Jamaica.

Transferred from the Atlantic to the Pacific Fleet in January 1956, Worcester made two more deployments to operate with the 7th Fleet, visiting such highly frequented ports as Sasebo and Yokosuka, Japan; Hong Kong; Manila; as well as the Japanese ports of Hakodate, Nagasaki, Shimoda, Yokohama, and Kobe. Returning each time to her home port at Long Beach, California, the ship conducted local operations between her cruises in Pacific waters.

=== Decommissioning ===
On 2 September 1958, &quot;Worcester&quot; departed Long Beach and steamed for the Mare Island Naval Shipyard to commence the inactivation process. She was decommissioned at Mare Island on 19 December 1958 and simultaneously placed in reserve. &quot;Worcester&quot; was subsequently berthed at San Francisco and later, at Bremerton, Washington, before she was struck from the Navy list on 1 December 1970. She was sold to Zidell Explorations, Inc., of Portland, Oregon, for disposal on 5 July 1972. The light cruiser, which never fought in its designated role, was subsequently broken up for scrap.

Approximately 200 tons of her armor plate was sent to the Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory in Batavia, Illinois, west of Chicago, and the armor is being used for absorption shielding in the particle accelerator and experiment lines.

The bell of USS Worcester is on display at the first floor near back entrance of Worcester City Hall.

<text>Styrene-butadiene or styrene-butadiene rubber (SBR) describe families of synthetic rubbers derived from styrene and butadiene (the version developed by Goodyear is called Neolite). These materials have good abrasion resistance and good aging stability when protected by additives. In 2012, more than 5.4 million tonnes of SBR were processed worldwide. About 50% of car tires are made from various types of SBR. The styrene/butadiene ratio influences the properties of the polymer: with high styrene content, the rubbers are harder and less rubbery. SBR is not to be confused with the thermoplastic elastomer, styrene-butadiene block copolymer, although being derived from the same monomers.

== Types ==
SBR is derived from two monomers, styrene and butadiene. The mixture of these two monomers is polymerized by two processes: from solution (S-SBR) or as an emulsion (E-SBR). E-SBR is more widely used.

=== Emulsion polymerization ===
E-SBR produced by emulsion polymerization is initiated by free radicals. Reaction vessels are typically charged with the two monomers, a free radical generator, and a chain transfer agent such as an alkyl mercaptan. Radical initiators include potassium persulfate and hydroperoxides in combination with ferrous salts. Emulsifying agents include various soaps. By &quot;capping&quot; the growing organic radicals, mercaptans (e.g. dodecylthiol), control the molecular weight of the product. Typically, polymerizations are allowed to proceed only to ca. 70%, a method called &quot;short stopping&quot;. In this way, various additives can be removed from the polymer.

=== Solution polymerization ===
Solution-SBR is produced by an anionic polymerization process. Polymerization is initiated by alkyl lithium compounds. Water and oxygen are strictly excluded. The process is homogeneous (all components are dissolved), which provides greater control over the process, allowing tailoring of the polymer. The organolithium compound adds to one of the monomers , generating a carbanion that then adds to another monomer, and so on. For tire manufacture, S-SBR is increasingly favored because it offers improved wet grip and reduced rolling resistance, which translate to greater safety and better fuel economy, respectively.

== Buna S ==
The material was initially marketed with the brand name Buna S. Its name derives Bu for butadiene and Na for sodium ( in several languages including Latin, German, and Dutch), and S for styrene. Buna S is an addition copolymer.

==Properties==
==Applications==


Styrene-butadiene is a commodity material which competes with natural rubber. The elastomer is used widely in pneumatic tires. This application mainly calls for E-SBR, although S-SBR is growing in popularity. Other uses include shoe heels and soles, gaskets, and even chewing gum.

Latex (emulsion) SBR is extensively used in coated papers, being one of the cheapest resins to bind pigmented coatings. In 2010, more than half (54%) of all used dry binders consisted of SB-based latexes. This amounted for roughly 1.2 million tonnes. 

It is also used in building applications, as a sealing and binding agent behind renders as an alternative to PVA, but is more expensive. In the latter application, it offers better durability, reduced shrinkage and increased flexibility, as well as being resistant to emulsification in damp conditions.

SBR is often used as part of cement based substructural (basement)waterproofing systems where as a liquid it is mixed with water to form the Gauging solution for mixing the powdered Tanking material to a slurry. SBR aids the bond strength, reduces the potential for shrinkage and adds an element of flexibility.

It is also used by speaker driver manufacturers as the material for low damping rubber surrounds.

Additionally, it is used in some rubber cutting boards.

SBR is also used as a binder in lithium-ion battery electrodes, in combination with carboxymethyl cellulose as a water-based alternative for, e.g. polyvinylidene fluoride.

Styrene-butane rubber is also used in gasketed-plate heat exchangers. It is used at moderate temperature up to 85 deg C, (358 K) for aqueous systems.

SBS Filaments also exist for FDM 3D printing

==History==
SBR is a replacement for natural rubber. It was originally developed prior to World War II in Germany by chemist Walter Bock in 1929. Industrial manufacture began during World War II, and was used extensively by the U.S. Synthetic Rubber Program to produce Government Rubber-Styrene (GR-S) to replace the Southeast Asian supply of natural rubber which, under Japanese occupation, was unavailable to Allied nations.

<text>Mind–body interventions (MBI) or mind-body training (MBT) are health and fitness interventions that are intended to work on a physical and mental level such as yoga, tai chi, and Pilates.

The category was introduced in September 2000 by the United States National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health (NCCIH), a government agency, and encompasses alternative medicine interventions. It excludes scientifically validated practices such as cognitive behavioral therapy. Cochrane reviews have found that studies in this area are small and have low scientific validity.

Since 2008, authors documenting research conducted on behalf of the NCCIH have used terms &quot;mind and body practices&quot; and &quot;mind-body medicine&quot; interchangeably with &quot;mind-body intervention&quot; to denote therapies, as well as physical and mental rehabilitative practices, which &quot;focus on the relationships between the brain, mind, body, and behavior, and their effect on health and disease.&quot; According to the NCCIH, &quot;mind and body practices include a large and diverse group of procedures or techniques administered or taught by a trained practitioner or teacher&quot;.

==Definitions==

The United States National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health (NCCIH) defines mind-body interventions as activities that purposefully affect mental and physical fitness, listing activities such as yoga, tai chi, pilates, guided imagery, guided meditation and forms of meditative praxis, hypnosis, hypnotherapy, and prayer, as well as art therapy, music therapy, and dance therapy.

The Cochrane Library contains 3 systematic reviews that explicitly cite and define MBI as MBT.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmidhttps://doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD007559.pub2&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The reviews consider biofeedback, mindfulness, autogenic training, hypnotherapy, imagery, meditation, and prayer as MBT despite them focusing more strictly on the mind.

One review uses a narrower definition, defining MBT as an &#x27;active&#x27; intervention in which mental and physical exercises are alternated.
A web search will yield mentions of mind-body training in offerings of entities that give yoga, pilates, or meditation training, but explicit definitions are rare.

== Origins and history ==
Western MBI was popularized in the early 20th century but dates back to Ancient Greece. The Greek values of strength and beauty in combination with Greek mythology led to activities intended to promote confidence.

Eastern MBI in the form of yoga originated in Ancient India and has been around since at least 500 BCE and possibly as early as 3300 BCE.

A renewed interest developed in mind-body work in the late 19th and early 20th century. Possibly due to visits from yoga gurus and increased interest, some medical practitioners and movement specialists developed movement therapies with a deliberate mental focus.

Two prominent names in modern mind-body training are Joseph Pilates (1880–1967) and Margaret Morris (1891–1980). A famous statement of Joseph Pilates was &quot;Physical fitness is the first requisite of happiness.&quot; Margaret Morris had a background in dance and claimed a connection between a free dance and a free mind.

==In conventional medicine==

All mind-body interventions focus on the interaction between the brain, body, and behavior and are practiced with intention to use the mind to alter physical function and promote overall health and well-being.

However, the NCCIH does not consider mind-body interventions as within the purview of complementary and alternative medicine when there is sufficient scientific evidence for the benefit of such practices along with their professional application in conventional medicine. Cognitive behavioral therapy is defined by the NCCIH as a mind-body intervention because it utilizes the mind&#x27;s capacity to affect bodily function and symptoms, but also there is sufficient scientific evidence and mainstream application for it to fall outside the purview of complementary and alternative medicine.

==Evidence for efficacy==

Most studies of MBI and related techniques are small and have low scientific validity, a finding that dominates many Cochrane Reviews. Some of the individual studies do show positive results, but this may be due to chance or placebo effects and the significance may diminish when groups are randomized.

Proponents of MBI techniques suggest that a rationale for mind-body training is that the mind follows the body and the body follows the mind. The body-mind connection can be attributed to hormones and chemicals released during movement, although the mind-body connection is dominated by the brain and is considered to be more of a neurological mechanism. There are some indications that movement complexity may have an impact on brain development.

When it comes to explicitly alternating mental and physical exercise sections, proponents rationalize that physical activity induces an elevated heart-rate and increases in stress, which mimics conditions in which athletes need their mental skills the most. It is believed that these conditions make training more functional and there is some limited scientific evidence supporting effectiveness because of this type of approach.

There are documented benefits of several mind-body interventions derived from scientific research: first, by MBI use contributing to the treatment a range of conditions including headaches, coronary artery disease and chronic pain; second, in ameliorating disease and the symptoms of chemotherapy-induced nausea, vomiting, and localized physical pain in patients with cancer; third, in increasing the perceived capacity to cope with significant problems and challenges; and fourth, in improving the reported overall quality of life. In addition, there is evidence supporting the brain and central nervous system&#x27;s influence on the immune system and the capacity for mind-body interventions to enhance immune function outcomes, including defense against and recovery from infection and disease.

Side effects are rarely reported in mind-body training. Some studies have indicated that meditation can have undesired adverse effects on specific clinical populations (e.g., people with a history of PTSD), although these are smaller studies.

There is limited high-quality evidence as well with regard to the effect of intensity and duration. In a small study observing 87 healthy female participants undergoing either mind-body training or no training, participants who actively participated in an online program showed significantly greater resilience toward stress, anger, anxiety, and depression at 8 weeks than at 4 weeks into the study. However, this study was not randomized and the placebo effect may be large on the subjective psychological test scores. Recent meta-analyses of randomized controlled trials (RTCs) confirmed the efficacy of smartphone interventions for mental health problems, including depression, anxiety, and stress.

==Popularity==

Mind–body interventions are the most commonly used form of complementary and alternative medicine in the United States, with yoga and meditation being the most popular forms.

<text>USS &quot;Collier&quot; was a stern wheel steamer built at Cincinnati, Ohio, in 1864 as the &quot;Allen Collier&quot; and purchased by the United States Navy on 7 December of that year.

The ship was commissioned as the USS &quot;Allen Collier&quot; on 18 March 1865 and renamed to be USS &quot;Collier&quot; soon thereafter. Navy records occasionally continued to refer to the ship by her original name, &quot;Allen Collier&quot; and more frequently by a name which she never carried officially: &quot;A. Collier&quot;.

&quot;Collier&quot; patrolled the Mississippi River until the end of the American Civil War. She was decommissioned on 29 July 1865 and sold into civilian service later that year.

<doc id="749180" wikidata="Q3035468" url="?curid=749180" title="Dominic Serres">
<text>Dominic Serres ( 4 November 1793) was a French-born British painter who specialised in marine art. He co-founded the Royal Academy (RA) in 1768, and served as the RA&#x27;s librarian from 1792 until his death.

==Life and works==
He was born in Auch, Gascony, in southwestern France, between 1719 and 1723. Some sources say he died at the age of 74, but this is not confirmed. He initially studied to become a priest at the Benedictine seminary in Douai, but then left and moved to Spain. He is said to have become a merchant sailor in the Mediterranean and to have lived in Italy. He also worked as a sailor in South America, became a merchant captain in Cuba, and lived for several years as a merchant in Havana. In 1748, he was captured by the British in the Caribbean, and was taken prisoner to England, in 1752. During his imprisonment in the Marshalsea prison he took up painting, and after his release he lived for a time in Northamptonshire, where he made his living by painting marine scenes. He copied the works of Willem van de Velde the Elder, a Dutch marine painter, very popular at the time in England. He then moved to London, where he is believed to have learned his techniques from the marine painter Charles Brooking (c. 1723–1759). If Serres did not settle in London until 1758, however, he could not have studied for long under Brooking, since he was buried on 25 March 1759.

During the Seven Years&#x27; War (1756-1763), the exploits of the British fleet in battles such as the Siege of Havana, in 1762, where the British inflicted significant damage on the Spanish Navy, and the Battle of Chandernagar, led to an increase of popularity of naval paintings depicting these battles, and Serres&#x27; work on that matter met British popular tastes. Working for a publisher documenting the events of the Seven Years&#x27; War, he painted a series of depictions, including the capture of Havana. He also painted events in the American Revolutionary War, such as the disastrous Penobscot Expedition launched by the Americans in 1779.

He participated at the exhibitions held by the Society of Artists of Great Britain, founded in the early 1760s, and became a member in 1765. The Royal Academy of Arts was founded in 1768, and he was elected as a founding member. 

In 1780, he was appointed Marine Painter to King George III. He was appointed librarian at the Royal Academy, but died shortly after, in London, in 1793. Serres was buried at St. Marylebone Old Church.

==Family==
Serres married Mary Colldycutt, aged 18 years old, on 16 July 1749. They were married in what was known as a &#x27;Fleet wedding&#x27;, a less expensive and less formal form of marriage that was possible without affiliation to a particular parish and was common in the area around Fleet Prison at the time. The couple had four daughters, Catherine, Augusta Charlotte, Johanna and Sarah, and two sons, the elder of whom, John Thomas Serres, also became a prolific marine painter. Dominique Michael, the younger, was also a painter but specialised in depicting landscapes.

<doc id="749188" wikidata="Q66665" url="?curid=749188" title="Paul Mauser">
<text>Peter Paul von Mauser (born Peter Paul Mauser) (27 June 1838 – 29 May 1914) was a German weapon designer, manufacturer, industrialist and politician.

==Early life==
Mauser was born in Oberndorf am Neckar, in what was then the Kingdom of Württemberg. His father was originally a shoemaker and then made leather scabbards for the Royal Rifle Factory in Oberndorf.

==Career==
Paul Mauser and his brother Wilhelm, who had become gunsmiths, first lived in modest conditions. Paul Mauser developed various firearms with his brother, and later he founded the company &quot;Gebr Mauser&quot; with him, which finally took over from the royal manufacture.

Together with his brother Wilhelm Mauser, Peter Paul Mauser designed the Mauser Model 1871 rifle, the first of a successful line of Mauser rifles and pistols. The rifle was adopted as the Gewehr 71 or Infanterie-Gewehr 71 and was the first metal cartridge weapon of the German Empire. While Wilhelm handled the business side of the factory, Paul proved to be the more technically capable engineer.

Peter Paul von Mauser made significant contributions to bolt action rifle design and successfully combined and improved various bolt action engineering concepts. The Mauser company bolt action development resulted in the Gewehr 98 and Karabiner 98k rifle series that were the latest in a line of Mauser bolt-action rifles that started with the Mauser Model 1889 and were adapted in 1889 and the 1890s as service rifles by several countries. The bolt-action design used for the Gewehr 98 was patented by Paul Mauser on 9 September 1895. Besides rifles, Paul Mauser also developed handguns, with the first Mauser designed handgun being the Mauser C78 revolver. In 1896, Paul Mauser would develop the C96 pistol, which was one of the first semi-automatic pistols in history.

Initially, Mauser&#x27;s designs were more successful abroad than in Prussia, but the Prussian Rifle Review Board in Spandau opted for the domestically developed 1888 rifle. Mauser designed an improved model of this rifle for the Imperial Order .

The name of Mauser is inseparable from the construction of the 1893 infantry rifle for Spain, 1894 carbine and 1896 infantry rifle for Sweden, with model rifles for Peru, Belgium, Argentina, the Brazil (1894), Chile (1895), then Costa Rica, the Dominican Republic, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, Nicaragua, Venezuela, Mexico (1902), Uruguay and Turkey. Deliveries to these countries make the Mauser name a world-renowned guarantee of quality for precise weapons.

The construction of the Gewehr 98 rifle was personally praised by Kaiser Wilhelm II on April 5, 1898. Mauser lost his left eye in 1901 as a result of a cartridge explosion during a test firing of the self-loading C98.

Mauser also designed the 7.65×53mm Mauser (1889) and 7×57mm Mauser (1892) rifle cartridges. These cartridges were high-performance service cartridge designs compared to other contemporary smokeless powder service cartridges such as the 8mm Lebel (1886), 8×50mmR Mannlicher (1890) and .303 British (1891).

==Entry into politics==
Mauser was a member of the German Reichstag for the National Liberal Party from 1898 to 1903, a party that appeared in the Kingdom of Württemberg as a German party. In the Reichstag, he represents the 8th district of Württemberg (Freudenstadt, Horb, Oberndorf, and Sulz).

<text>A , or, more colloquially, , is a sumo wrestler. Although used to define all wrestlers participating in sumo wrestling matches, the term is more commonly used to refer to professional wrestlers, employed by the Japan Sumo Association, who participate in professional sumo tournaments (called ) in Japan, the only country where sumo is practiced professionally. 

Professional follow traditions dating back to the Edo period, and therefore follow a number of codes and customs in their daily lives that distinguish them from other martial artists. Their life as professionals revolves around the observance of traditional rules that apply both to their life in the community and to the way they dress, the latter rules evolving according to the rank a wrestler has reached during his career.

Coming from many different nationalities, are the only employees of the Japan Sumo Association who can run the organization once they have chosen to retire. However, only a tiny fraction of wrestlers are given this opportunity, leaving the vast majority of the sport&#x27;s retirees in a precarious situation.

The number of active peaked at 943 in May 1994, at the height of the &quot;WakaTaka boom&quot;, but had declined to 599 by January 2024. The decline in the number of recruits applying to become professionals is a major topic in sumo, as it regularly breaks records for the lowest number of recruits.

==Terminology==
In popular use, the term refers to professional sumo wrestlers only and is an alternative term to or the more colloquial . It has been noted by authors such as Dorothea Buckingham and Mark Schilling that these terms should be preferred to &#x27;sumo wrestler&#x27;, because since sumo has little in common with Greco-Roman wrestling but more with judo or aikido, it was pointed out that it was a mistake to use the term &#x27;wrestler&#x27; to define the competitors in sumo matches.

The two kanji characters that make up the word are that of &#x27;strength&#x27; or &#x27;power&#x27; () and &#x27;warrior&#x27; or &#x27;samurai&#x27; (); consequently, and more idiomatically, the term can literally be defined as &#x27;strongman&#x27; or &#x27;powerful warrior&#x27;.

 is often defined as the more appropriate collective name for the wrestlers as a group or as individuals. The term itself comes from an abbreviation of the word , used in the early Edo period to define sumo wrestlers. There is no implication of hierarchy between and , the two terms being interchangeable. However, some wrestlers prefer to be referred to as .

A more prestigious term referring to wrestlers who have risen to the two highest divisions ( and ) also exists. The word refers to senior who have significantly more status, privilege and salary than their lower-division counterparts and excludes the lower-rankers. Wrestlers who qualify as are also given the suffix at the end of their name. That term, found also in the sumo terms , and , comes from , a road barrier which was used to control the movement of people from place to place within Japan. In feudal Japan, many wrestlers were recruited from the big, strong guards who manned the . Later &quot;&quot; came to mean an unbeaten performance.

==History==
===Origins of the wrestlers===
Mention of wrestlers can be found in traditions predating the emergence of sumo in Japan, in traditions on the mainland of the Asian continent. In Korea, in the tombs of the T&#x27;ung-kou valley, murals depict wrestlers in loincloths seemingly performing wrestling duels for the pleasure of court nobles. Traces of wrestling activities have been demonstrated by the exhumation of pottery depicting wrestlers in Korean wrestling attire dating from the Kofun period. As sumo became embedded in Japanese myths and legends, stories of powerful wrestlers began to appear in the (one of the first historical record of Japan), and with them the first accounts of matches held during the Yamato kingship period. At the same time the function of sumo wrestler began to appear under the term . The latter were conscripts from the provinces sent to the Heian court as tribute organized by local governors who, in order to supply the court&#x27;s festivities with participants, ordered the communities to send to the capital any man gifted in wrestling, horse-racing or archery. Although at the time wrestlers enjoyed a certain degree of recognition, with some being recruited into the palace guard; sending wrestlers was compulsory throughout the territory, and any delay was punishable by imprisonment. In 821, codes resembling the beginnings of etiquette were introduced at the court to organize the tournaments held during banquets. With the Minamoto clan&#x27;s rise to power, sumo and its wrestlers began to shift their practice from a court entertainment to a real military training. During the Sengoku period, Oda Nobunaga made sumo a popular sport, aided by the emergence of large cities (like Edo, Osaka, Sendai and Nagoya), which soon began to compete with Kyoto&#x27;s cultural monopoly, as it had been Japan&#x27;s only metropolis. These new cultural centres saw the emergence of wrestling groups, from both the commoners and the warrior classes, who took part in festivities at shrines.

===Edo period and sumo structuring===
During the period of peace established under the Tokugawa shogunate, Japan experienced an unprecedented period of vagrancy for many samurai who had lost their social standing with their previous masters, who had been deposed or killed so that the shogunate could assert itself. These masterless samurai, called , could not engage in any activity under their social category under threat of punishment, and with the period of peace, it had become almost impossible to be recruited by local lords who no longer needed to build up a sizeable military retinue. During the same period, sumo was gradually establishing itself as a popular sport, and two extremes coexisted side by side. On one side, certain powerful clans (such as the Kishū Tokugawa, Maeda, Ikeda, Matsudaira, Sakai and Hosokawa) formed suites of wrestlers organized into royal households called , and elevated them to the status of vassals. On the other, a number of had no choice but to put their martial art skills to good use in street sumo tournaments, called , for the entertainment of passers-by. Similarly, a number of street entertainment wrestling groups formed and began touring, sometimes with the support of shrines that occasionally recruited them as part of religious festivities and to help priests raising money for the construction of buildings.

Eventually, this mix of professional wrestlers and disgraced , along with the commoners who took part in the contests of strength of the street tournaments, came into conflict over money. Tense brawls, even deaths, sometimes occurred. Public order became so disturbed by 1648 that Edo authorities issued an edict banning street sumo and matches organized to raise funds during festivities. The edicts did not stop there, however, and also had an impact on wrestlers for some thirty years, with the publication of an order banning the use of , or ring name, a tradition observed since the Muromachi period. At the same time, instructions sent out to local lords advised drastic savings on suite costs, and the maintenance and recruitment of vassalized wrestlers ceased altogether. Over the next two decades or so, the wrestlers, now without any income, decided to petition the authorities to lift the bans, forming coalitions of interests to protect themselves from any violent repression of their movement.

In 1684, a named , leader of one of these coalitions, obtained permission to hold a tournament after proposing a new etiquette associated with matches organization. In fact, the systematization of sumo in Edo (with the introduction of the first and the strict use of the forty-eight first ) went hand in hand with the authorization of sumo tournaments. As sumo inevitably became systematized, new wrestler ranking systems were put in place with the development of the use of and the introduction of the ranks of , and .

Around 1717, local lords, who had ceased to maintain suites of wrestlers, revived the practice. The term also appeared at the same time, along with the more specific term , which referred to wrestlers attached to the patronage of local lords. With the emergence of etiquette, notable differences began to emerge to differentiate retainers of local lords from wrestlers who were not under the protection of a patron. were allowed to carry two swords, while wrestlers without patrons carried only one, or even a dagger. Wrestlers who took part in tournaments without the patronage of lords did not yet have samurai status or a salary and their finances depended largely on donations they could receive from the organizers of charity tournaments or admirers. Their participation was motivated in particular by the fact that they could be scouted by the lords&#x27; households, if their results or popularity were worthwhile, and by the fact that they were fed and housed for the duration of the tournament. In those days the promotion system was decided by the tournament organizers who then distributed the profits to the elders who then redistributed funds to their wrestlers, with the wrestlers under the protection of the lords receiving bonuses and having financial security and the others being kept in poverty.

The lords&#x27; wrestlers were given samurai status and a salary. They were allowed to participate as special guests in official tournaments organized with the approval of shrine authorities. During these tournaments, they represented the power of the domain in whose name they wrestled, and wore the lords&#x27; symbols on large aprons called . As representatives of their domains, wrestlers attended tournament matches at the foot of the ring, and made a point of contesting decisions unfavorable to their lords, as part of rivalries between clans. To avoid confrontations, it became customary to declare draws or postpone the decision on the outcome of a match.

Since professional sumo was intrinsically linked to the domains of the local lords, the sport also reflected their health and the political situation in Japan. During the Tenpō era, the feudal system was shaken by famine and rebellions, and the wrestlers who took part in the tournaments gradually withdrew to perform their duties at the households of the who maintained them. With this lack of the most popular figures, the public gradually deserted the tournaments, leading to a recession within the sumo associations. During the period, the feudal system collapsed, leading to a period of uncertainty about the future of the sport and therefore of wrestlers. Nevertheless, sumo had succeeded in establishing itself as a popular sport, recognized as the national sport, leading to the survival of the wrestlers&#x27; status.

===Meiji Restoration and social movements===
With the Meiji Restoration and the abolition of the han system, wrestlers lost the patronage of the lords, who could no longer maintain households of their own. With the loss of income security and social status came a period of semi-censorship of sumo, with the adoption of Western ideology leading to the perception of sumo as unworthy of the new era, as the matches were seen as barbaric and the semi-nudity of the wrestlers shocking. With the disappearance of government protection, some wrestlers organized themselves into fire brigades. At the same time, political circles were organized to preserve some of Japan&#x27;s indigenous traditions, saving the privilege of wrestlers to wear samurai (topknot) in 1871. With the absence of patronage on the part of the lords, a social crisis was also revealed among wrestlers, who now openly criticized the distribution of winnings from charity tournaments. When Emperor Meiji ordered a match to be held in front of him in 1884, wrestlers Umegatani I and Ōdate made such an impact on him that his attitude towards the sport was changed, and with it the attitude of imperialist groups calling for the abolition of sumo, restoring a semblance of popularity to the sport. 

Although sumo itself continued, the Meiji period was also marked by the first social movements in the history of professional sumo. In the 1870s, the first wrestlers&#x27; revolt was organized by Takasago Uragorō (then still called Takamiyama) asking for better treatment (without initial success) and breaking away from the Tokyo-based association before merging again. After that initial movement, a number of reforms were introduced to adapt the competitions to Japan&#x27;s new political and financial context, notably by distributing better salaries to wrestlers and basing the latter on results. Social movements in sumo did not cease, however, and in 1911 a strike by low-ranking wrestlers called for a new wage reform, securing a bonus (made up of payment in cash and a deposit in a pension fund) distributed to all wrestlers who were not or (professional sumo&#x27;s top two ranks). In 1923, another strike known as the Mikawajima Incident demanded better pensions for wrestlers and was led by Ōnishiki, without success. Finally, in 1932 (Taishō era), the last major wrestlers&#x27; strike broke out with the Shunjuen Incident, calling for fundamental reform of the newly created Japan Sumo Association and leading to a mass resignation of wrestlers the likes of which professional sumo had never seen before. Eventually, the situation calmed down and sumo enjoyed a new boom in popularity, notably driven by Futabayama.

During the second Sino-Japanese war, sumo emerged as a sport of pride, driven by strong nationalist sentiment and taking hold where Western sports (such as baseball) were denounced. As ambassadors of national sentiment, sumo wrestlers were sent on tour to occupied Manchuria and China to perform in front of soldiers. With the turning point of the war in 1943, competitions were disrupted. The Tokyo bombings killed many wrestlers, and those who survived were either drafted into the army or navy, or incorporated into provincial work units. Popular figures in the sport were also forced to leave competitions, such as Tochinishiki who left the association to be drafted into the navy at Arai, Shizuoka during the 1944–1945 period; or Yoshibayama, then newly promoted in the division, who had been drafted during the 1943–1946 period and was shot in the left thigh.

In the 1960s, sumo wrestlers once again served as emblems of Japan, with the first international tours of professional sumo since the &#x27;30s. In the summer of 1965, Taihō, Kashiwado and Sadanoyama were part of a group of eight wrestlers who went to the Soviet Union at the invitation of the Russian government to perform goodwill matches. Since the wrestlers fought in (fighting loincloth), the press echoed the diplomatic rapprochement, dubbing the delegation the &#x27;naked ambassadors.&#x27;
==Lifestyle==
The life of a is first and foremost oriented towards strict rules of absolute obedience and respect for superiors and seniors. Revolving around a strict hierarchy that may seem &quot;outdated&quot; or &quot;feudal&quot;, the sumo wrestler&#x27;s life is in reality based above all else on his own personal skills, since only his results–and the guarantee of more victories than defeats at official tournaments (called )–are the guarantees of his success. With success comes progression in the sumo hierarchy, which is not as much about rank as it is about status, the rank determining dress, earnings and treatment from peers.

A professional sumo wrestler leads a highly regimented life. The Sumo Association prescribes the behavior of its wrestlers in some detail. For example, the association prohibits wrestlers from driving cars, although this is partly out of necessity as many wrestlers are too big to fit behind a steering wheel.

===Recruits===
Recruiting young wrestlers is an essential aspect of perpetuating the sport&#x27;s wrestling pool. Since the 1970s, sumo has developed an intensive scouting system. The largest stables have established scouting networks throughout the country, partly supported with the help of their nationwide patron organizations, with retired wrestlers and patron-club members acting as part-time scouts for the stables. It is also not rare for acquaintances of the master, or one of the stable wrestlers, to also bring potential apprentices to the stable. When on provincial tours, masters always lookout for potential talent. Despite all the efforts made by masters to attract new talent, it is often the case that young wrestlers are motivated to join the stable solely by the reputation and achievements of the current master.

Since 1973, all new aspirants must have completed at least compulsory education. In the Japanese education system, it means graduating from the six years of primary school and the three years of junior high school. As of January 2024, recruits are no longer subject to physical standards. However, these had always been subject to revision, with the introduction of a minimum of and in 2012, replacing the need for recruits to be a minimum tall and weigh in the early 2000s. With the exception of recruitments based on special criteria, all wrestlers must be under 23 years old. Before the abolition of the height and weight prerequisite, young aspirants were subject to a physical examination to confirm that they met the minimum height and weight requirements to compete. To meet the height requirements, some recruits even injected silicone on top of their head to gain a few centimetres - a practice that is now prohibited. With the abolition of the height and weight prerequisite system, the Sumo Association now judges new recruits on the basis of an athletics test, reintroduced in April 2024 for the first time in 12 years. The test is based on seven physical tests (back strength, grip strength, repeated horizontal jump, handball throw, handstand, standing long jump and 50-meter run).

In professional sumo, the majority of new aspirants sign up in March, the end of the school year in Japan. All new wrestlers are then required to attend the Sumo School, located at the Ryōgoku Kokugikan, where they spend six months learning the basic movements as well as calligraphy, history, (folk songs) and sports medicine. If a new recruit experiences a record rise and already reaches the status of before completing his course at the Sumo School, it is accepted that he may not take part in lessons, although all the wrestlers who have found themselves in this situation have decided not to make use of this right (such as Endō and Ichinojō). In 2023, Hakuōhō became the first wrestler in sumo&#x27;s recorded history to earn his promotion to before attending any of the school&#x27;s classes, nonetheless also deciding to participate in the lessons.

===Ranks===

Professional sumo classifies its wrestlers into six divisions, in addition to status, under which newcomers without status must first develop. In the highest division, the , there are five different ranks. A parallel status to the traditional hierarchy also exists with the status of . This allows wrestlers who have competed and succeeded on the national amateur scene to begin their career at a more advantageous rank in the and divisions.

Statistics shows that only one wrestler in fifty makes it to the division, just one in a hundred becomes a wrestler, and only one in four hundred makes the rank. Hence, most wrestlers retire from professional sumo without ever having reached the salaried levels.

The lowest ranked wrestlers are expected to obey and act as assistants to their coaches and to the wrestlers ranked as , meaning every wrestler ranked in or above. In the lower divisions, however, the question of seniority and rank brings some nuances to the way wrestlers are treated. In , the wrestlers no longer have to perform the most thankless tasks and have a few extra freedoms within the stable. In the division above, in , the wrestlers have even more rights and are considered experienced enough to teach the basics to young wrestlers. When they retire, wrestlers who have reached and spent enough time in are eligible for a job offered by the Sumo Association and a retirement gratuity. 

In the stable, the senior wrestlers (even lower-ranked ones) have authority over their juniors and win the title of , allowing them to exercise authority, notably during training, over their ; meaning every wrestler with less seniority than them. However, exercise their authority in a brutal manner, and many of the violent scandals in professional sumo are their fault.

When a wrestler reaches the ranks, he becomes a and his daily life changes completely, with his daily needs taken care of for him. The difference in treatment between wrestlers classified as and those who are not is such that an expression says that the two statuses are &#x27;like heaven and hell.&#x27; A -ranked wrestler has many privileges. He is assigned a minimum of one (assistant) who will act as his personal servant, helping him dress and prepare, carrying his belongings, helping him bathe, acting as a secretary or running specific errands on behalf of his superior. The higher a climbs in the hierarchy, the more assistants he is entitled to. Wrestlers who qualify as have the additional privileges. These include having their name hand-painted with that of their sponsor on (tall banners), which are then erected at the entrance to tournament arenas during . Around the ring, are entitled to a number of small perks, such as personalized towels during pre-bout preparations. While waiting for their match, wrestlers ranked in the division are entitled to their own personalized waiting (cushion). These, often donated by sponsors, are made of silk with about 20 cm of padding and bear the wrestler&#x27;s name. Backstage, the wrestlers are distributed in the preparation rooms according to their rank, the higher ranked a wrestler is, the further away from the door he is. At the top of the hierarchy, a is installed at the end of the room. To transport their personal belongings, use an , a bamboo and luggage box dating back to the Edo period. Each wrestler has an bearing his name. At the top of the hierarchy, a is allowed to use three, as he has more regalia.

===Life in the stable===
Sumo life centers around the training stables, to which all active wrestlers must belong. Most wrestlers, and all junior ones, live in their stable in a dormitory style: training, cleaning, eating, sleeping and socializing together. Since stable members live in a brotherhood similar to a family, they are forbidden to fight another member of their stable during tournaments.

How a wrestler is treated in his stable is based on his ranking. Wrestlers ranked in the lower divisions get up at dawn (usually around four or five) to do morning chores around the building and stretch in preparation for the usual empty stomach morning training. Just before the training session, the day&#x27;s lunch team begin their preparations. The morning exercises done by the wrestlers are designed to exhaust wrestlers and strengthen their &quot;fighting spirit&quot;, and are repeated every morning without exception. Gradually by rank, the wrestlers join in the training and the stablemaster only appears once the wrestlers have joined. -ranked wrestlers always turn up last, often around eight o&#x27;clock, and their assistants have to temporarily leave the training to help them put on their . On arrival at the training hall, are systematically greeted by wrestlers of lower rank than themselves. 

Around eleven, the wrestlers head for the baths-in descending order of rank, so that the always benefit from a clean bathroom. When the practice is at its peak, the stable cooks begin to prepare the first and major meal of the day. Wrestlers eat only two meals a day and spend at least one of those sitting around a bubbling pot of chankonabe. In most stables the cooking brigade is supervised by one of the oldest and most experienced of the low-ranking wrestler, affectionately referred to as . Wrestlers eat by turns according to rank. Each wrestler is served by another wrestler belonging to a rank lower than his own, the eating first and the youngest apprentices last. The lowest ranks must patiently and hungrily wait until all of the others have finished and gone to have a nap. This regimen of no breakfast and a large lunch followed by a sleep is intended to help wrestlers put on a lot of weight so as to compete more effectively. Sumo wrestlers also drink large amounts of beer.

===Clothing and physical appearance===

 are bound by strict traditional dress codes. As they advance in their careers, wrestlers earn the right to wear certain clothing and accessories, meaning a wrestler&#x27;s appearance generally indicates his rank. Wrestlers&#x27; dress codes have changed over the years. Before the Heian period, the wrestlers came to the ring with distinctive flower crowns to distinguish wrestlers from the eastern team (&quot;alcea&quot; flowers) and those on the western team (calabash flowers). This practice later gave its name to the , the two corridors through which wrestlers enter the ring. Wrestlers also wore loose-fitting front loincloths similar to but called . 

Today&#x27;s wrestlers are expected to wear the and traditional Japanese dress at all times when in public. It is common for wrestlers to receive their clothes as gifts.

The -ranked wrestlers and above have the right to wear formal costumes. It includes the right to wear pants and crested kimono and jacket (respectively called and ) fastened by a , a braided cord.

In , wrestlers can wear &quot;&quot;. is a technique for removing the dye colour that can be adapted to any shape and considered to be of a higher-rank than simply sewing or embroidering the symbols &quot;a posteriori&quot;. The technique later gave its name to the clothing because the name of the wrestlers always appear in a different colour than that of the textile.

During their bouts, wrestlers also wear distinctive loincloths (called ) which are also subject to rules depending on the said wrestler&#x27;s rank. Since colors fade over time, it is also easy to recognize a wrestler who is more senior than another of equivalent rank by the color of their loincloth, the most senior wrestlers having yellowed (for ) and faded (for and below) loincloths over the years.

In Tokyo, the districts hosting wrestling stables have made a specialty of selling large kimonos adapted to the &#x27;s physique.

Wrestlers are entitled to clothing rights. These accumulate as follows (from their beginnings to the highest ranks):
The Japan Sumo Association is also able to regulate the physical appearance of its wrestlers. are expected to grow their hair long, in order to be worn in a style of , a topknot similar to the samurai hairstyles of the Edo period. Young wrestlers wear a simplified version, while wrestlers ranked in the two highest divisions ( and ) wear a more elaborate version called because it resembles the leaf of the ginkgo tree. 

The association&#x27;s statutes stipulate that wrestlers &quot;must keep their bodies clean&quot;. For this reason, the Sumo Association has banned the wearing of beards since 2019, judging that it made wrestlers&#x27; appearance too dirty. It was common at the time for wrestlers to allow themselves to grow a designer stubble during tournaments out of superstition, fearing that shaving during a winning streak would attract bad luck and put an end to it. The wearing of sideburns was however preserved. Similarly, wrestlers are expected to cut their fingernails short and tattoos are prohibited.

===Salary===

Professional sumo wrestlers only began to be paid according to a wage system in May 1957. Only wrestlers ranked and above receive a monthly salary. All wrestlers ranked below are given no monthly wages but receive a more modest allowance during the tournaments. Compensation paid to lower-ranked wrestlers varies according to their rank. In addition, the salary received by also depends on the division in which they wrestle and their rank. In addition, sumo wrestlers benefit from favourable tax treatment. For example, they are exempt from paying taxes on cash gifts received from individual supporters, although the gifts they receive from corporate supporters are taxed. They are also subject to more advantageous income tax laws, which means that wrestlers are taxed less for the same salary than someone who is not involved in professional sumo.

However, compared to other popular sports in Japan, particularly baseball, professional sumo seems to pay its athletes poorly, with the maximum annual salaries and bonuses capped at around 36 million yen, while in other sports athletes easily reach a hundred million yen a year. According to former Gagamaru and Tochinoshin, Hakuhō (sumo&#x27;s most successful wrestler) earned around ¥100 million a year (about US$646,840 and €607,200 as of April 2024) during his active years, all bonuses included. In addition, there is no pension fund as such in professional sumo. Wrestlers depend almost exclusively on the earnings generated by their success in the ring.

Wrestlers who are not earn allowance at tournaments as follows:
*: ¥165,000 (about US$1135 and €994)
*: ¥110,000 (about US$756 and €701)
*: ¥88,000 (about US$605 and €561)
*: ¥77,000 (about US$529 and €491)

Since the January 2019 tournament, the monthly salary figures for the top two divisions are:

*: ¥3 million (about US$26,500 and €19,000)
*: ¥2.5 million (about US$22,000 and €16,000)
* and : ¥1.8 million (about US$16,000 and €11,500)
*: ¥1.4 million (US$12,500 and €9,000)
*: ¥1.1 million (about US$9,500 and €7,000)

In addition to the basic salary, -ranked wrestlers also receive additional bonus income, called , six times a year (once every tournament, or ) based on the cumulative performance in their career to date. Prior to the establishment of the salary, wrestlers were exclusively paid according to this system. Wrestlers in the lower divisions earned three yen for each victory and fifty yen for each score, with the amount increasing as they moved up the hierarchy. Various bonuses added at the time of promotions, championships and were also added. Today, the continues to be registered and paid, but as a complement to the salary, and the amounts have been recalculated.

 receive an additional allowance every two tournaments, associated with the making of a new belt worn in their ring entering ceremony. Wrestlers who place in the category also receive bonuses. Also, prize money is given to the winner of each divisional championship, which increases from ¥100,000 for a victory up to ¥10 million for winning the top division. In addition to prizes for a championship, wrestlers in the top division giving an exceptional performance in the eyes of a judging panel can also receive one or more of three special prizes (), which are worth ¥2 million each.

Individual top division matches can also be sponsored by companies, with the resulting prize money called . For bouts involving and , the number of sponsors can be quite large, whereas for lower-ranked matchups, no bout sponsors may be active at all unless one of the wrestlers is particularly popular, or unless a company has a policy of sponsoring all his matchups. , a single sponsorship cost ¥70,000, with ¥60,000 going to the winner of the bout and ¥10,000 deducted by the Japan Sumo Association for costs and fees. Immediately after the match, the winner receives an envelope from the referee with half of his share of the sponsorship, while the other half is put in a fund for his retirement.

===The ===
The question of wages for professional wrestlers led to the creation, after the Shunjuen Incident, of a wrestlers&#x27; club called . Only salaried wrestlers belong to this group. Traditionally, wrestlers have used a representative to informally pass requests, particularly in relation to wages, to the elders sitting on the Board of Directors. The association does not recognize the as a union in the strict sense of the term. Relations between the and the association&#x27;s directors are therefore often compared to those between a child asking his parents for pocket money. It is common for wrestlers&#x27; demands to be ignored, and for them not to push the issue any further. In his memoirs, former Takamiyama wrote that in the meetings, the sometimes joked about a collective strike, but the action was rarely, if ever, considered.

Traditionally, the is represented by top-ranked wrestlers, notably , although in the past several intermediaries between the association and the have been lower-ranked wrestlers (such as Fujinishiki or Aonosato). Since Kakuryū&#x27;s retirement in 2021, the presidency of the is currently vacant.

===Punishments===
The Japan Sumo Association&#x27;s statutes set out disciplinary measures for its wrestlers. These have been subject to change over time, mainly in the 2010s, after match-fixing and gambling scandals. Until 2014, punishments consisted of five levels, to which was added a so-called &quot;extraordinary&quot; level. The wrestlers were subject to (from lightest to heaviest punishment): reprimand, salary reduction, suspension, demotion and dismissal. An extraordinary sanction (the expulsion) was then eventually added to the dismissal that allowed the association to dismiss a wrestler without retirement pay. The expulsion was the most severe sanction in the disciplinary statutes. This required a three-quarters vote in favor from the board of directors, composed at the time of the directors, as well as and . Since the founding of the All Japan Sumo Association in 1925, no wrestler had ever been expelled from the association. The only cases of expulsion was in 1873, with Koyanagi and Takasago. Following the 2011 match-fixing scandal, 23 wrestlers were however expelled from the association. Although marking a historic milestone, the disciplinary decision also embroiled the association in a legal battle with Sōkokurai, the latter setting a precedent in the association&#x27;s history by attacking and winning in court against the association in order to be reinstated.

In January 2014, the association shifted to a and the disciplinary statutes were amended, removing the sanction of expulsion and adding a recommendation to retire before the ultimate sanction of dismissal. In 2018, the sumo association also clarified its disciplinary rules, establishing a system for increasing penalties according to the rank of the concerned wrestler. On the subject of violence, a involved will therefore be subject to a sanction at least equal to a recommendation to retire due to their &quot;social responsibility&quot;, a will not have sanctions lower than a suspension when wrestlers or lower normally risk a suspension at the most, although there have been cases of wrestlers ranked as that have already been recommended for retirement.

==Retirement==
===Retirement ceremonies===

When a retires as an active wrestler, he symbolically marks the end of his career by cutting his topknot, symbolizing his traditional samurai rank and his career as a wrestler. The cutting of the topknot takes place in a dedicated ceremony called , even if the actually retire several months before the ceremony takes place.

The ceremony is regularly held to mark a wrestler&#x27;s retirement, with lower-ranked wrestlers having a more discreet ceremony often held at the usual end-of-tournament parties. For the top-ranked wrestlers, however, the ceremony takes the form of charity tournaments, with non-stake matches, presentations of traditional sumo-related arts and performances by prestigious guests. The ceremony closes with the actual cutting of the topknot, where the wrestler&#x27;s guests— all having to pay a symbolic participation fee —follow in succession to cut only a few strands of his hair with gold-plated scissors. Traditionally, the last hairs holding the topknot together are cut by the retiring wrestler&#x27;s master. It is also customary for a retired wrestler to keep his severed topknot in a box or glass case after the ceremony.

The ceremony can take place anywhere (and is often held in hotels), but a wrestler must have served at least thirty tournaments as a to perform his ceremony at the Ryōgoku Kokugikan.

===Post-retirement career===
Sumo wrestlers who retire can take on responsibilities within the Japan Sumo Association. Wrestlers who become managers are called , more commonly known as and translated into English as &#x27;elder&#x27; or &#x27;master.&#x27; Becoming an elder ensures that the retired wrestler will become one of the 105 coaches of the association, responsible for training the wrestlers and for running the association. 

Qualifications for becoming a master are determined by regulations: , , and only need one tournament at this rank to be considered for elder status. Wrestlers who have reached the rank of must have maintained it for twenty tournaments, while wrestlers must have maintained their rank for thirty tournaments. and receive preferential treatment and can remain in the association without acquiring elder status for five years () and three years (). 

Wrestlers who have attained the rank of and who have not been sufficiently active in may carry out subordinate functions within the association as or . These retired wrestlers serves as functionaries of the association, typically working at their former stables or within the associated (clan). are tasked to arrange matches and supervising young sumo wrestlers from and below. are the transportation and storage managers of the association&#x27;s equipments.

However, the vast majority of retiring wrestlers do not remain in positions within the Sumo Association. The luckiest manage to maintain their public profile by becoming TV personalities, sports commentators or actors. Most of them find themselves in activities unrelated to sumo and with no professional experience, having become wrestlers before their twenties and having had no other activities. This makes their situation complex, as when they enter the job market they find themselves competing with other employees of the same age group who do, however, have much more professional experience. Most of the time, retirees have no savings because they have not been able to secure a salary by reaching one of the two divisions. If they retire after an injury, it is all the more difficult to find work. Because they have no experience, most former wrestlers who find work also usually earn less than others in the same occupation. Most retirees find work in activities related to either cooking or physical labor, such as foodservices, care for the elderly and sports coaching. The majority find work in chankonabe restaurants, putting to good use the techniques they had learned while preparing meals in the stables.

Some former sumo wrestlers tried their luck competing in mixed martial arts or professional wrestling, with limited achievements. Sumo wrestlers who have fought in mixed martial arts include Akebono Tarō, Alan Karaev, Baruto Kaito, Henry Armstrong Miller, Kōji Kitao, Ōsunaarashi Kintarō, Tadao Yasuda, Takanofuji Sanzō, Teila Tuli and Wakashoyo Shunichi.

==Numbers==
Professional sumo has always had more wrestlers during periods of great rivalry between champions, with the record number of new apprentices taking the entrance exam set in 1958, at the height of the , with 250 successful candidates. At the peak of the , in 1992, 160 people were recruited in March alone. At the beginning of the 90s, professional sumo divisions numbered around 900 , hitting a record-high of 943 wrestlers in the 1994 May tournament.

In the 2020s, however, professional sumo is struggling to recruit. The number of newcomers to the sport has never been so low since the introduction of the six-tournament-a-year system. In the early 2020s, professional sumo recorded a decline of more than thirty percent in the number of wrestlers, reaching only 665 competitors in 2022. In November 2023 it was revealed that the total number of young recruits who had taken the professional exams during the whole year was 53, beating the record low of 56 new recruits having turned professional after the revelations of the 2012 match-fixing scandal. At the first tournament in 2024, the number of wrestlers even fell to 599, dropping below 600 active wrestlers for the first time in 45 years (at the March 1979 tournament).

The decline in the number of wrestlers is due in part to the number of scandals that have come to light in the 2010s, discouraging young aspirants from leading a life now known to be marked by hazing and violence. This drop in the number of wrestlers can also be explained by the dwindling number of amateur wrestlers who normally turn to professional sumo, whose numbers have been falling sharply over the last ten years. Japan&#x27;s declining birth rate has also been cited as the reason for the drop in the number of new recruits.

Since the Sumo Association&#x27;s bylaws include having &quot;a path to sumo [...] that maintains a level of tradition and discipline that must grow,&quot; many see the difficulties in recruiting and maintaining the number of wrestlers as an attack on the perpetuation of the traditional history of sumo.

==Foreign-born ==

Professional sumo is practiced exclusively in Japan, but wrestlers of other nationalities participate. Any young man meeting the Japan Sumo Association&#x27;s recruitment criteria can apply to become a . However, foreigners must have the support of two guarantors and a work visa. When officially registered on the Sumo Association&#x27;s list of professional , foreign wrestlers are registered by country and not by territorial subdivision, such as prefecture of origin. It is difficult for young foreign recruits to integrate into professional sumo. No translation is provided when young recruits take part in courses at the Sumo School. To give newcomers the tools they need to integrate, the association requires a year&#x27;s training at the Sumo School, instead of the 6 months normally required for Japanese recruits, so that foreigners learn Japanese cultural codes and know how to speak, read and write Japanese. Many foreigners give up out of homesickness. Those who persist generally find it very difficult to integrate into stable life, and more particularly to get used to the diet. Akebono commented that he had to forget all the codes of life he had learnt over eighteen years and relearn everything in order to adapt effectively to his way of life.

Historically, professional sumo gradually opened up to foreigners from the 1960s onwards. Before this date, foreigners had historically tried to join professional sumo. The earliest recorded attempt by a foreigner to enroll in professional sumo happened in 1885, when stablemaster Urakaze was approached by an American wrestler who wanted to join his stable, but without success because the association&#x27;s statutes at the time did not clearly state that foreigners were allowed to compete as . Prior to this date, professional sumo had already recruited non-Japanese wrestlers, notably Ainus and Koreans. The latter were not considered to be fully Japanese, but were referred to as coming from Japan because Hokkaido is the northernmost prefecture of Japan and Korea was part of the Japanese territory at the time. The first openly Ainu wrestler to reach the division was in 1966. 

In the 1930s, American-Japanese Shōji Hiraga became the first foreigner to be recognized as such in the . In the 1940s, a Japanese-American, Toyonishiki, and the Korean-born Rikidōzan achieved status prior to World War II, but neither were officially listed as foreigners. In the 1970s, around thirty foreign wrestlers joined. Most of them were Koreans born in Japan. The figurehead of these wrestlers was Maenoyama, who, despite being born in Osaka and having spent his whole life in Japan, was always referred to as &quot;the Korean&quot; by the Japanese media. In addition, foreigners have also been the subject of debate as to whether they can attain the supreme rank of . The most conservative commentators criticize them for their lack of typical Japanese ; loosely translated as &#x27;dignity&#x27; but meaning a balance of self-confidence, self-knowledge and self-control.

The first non-Asian to achieve a significant success in sumo was Hawaii-born Takamiyama. He reached the top division in 1968 and in 1972 became the first foreigner to win the top division championship, becoming the first foreign wrestler to be truly popular in Japan. Takamiyama was followed by a fellow Hawaii-born Konishiki, of ethnic Samoan descent, the first foreigner to reach the rank of in 1987; and the Native Hawaiian Akebono, who became the first foreign-born in 1993. Musashimaru, born in American Samoa and raised in Hawaii, became the second foreigner to reach sumo&#x27;s top rank in 1999. This generation of foreign wrestlers was nicknamed , to draw a parallel with the Americans who had conquered the country during the 19th century.

Between 2003 and 2014, all four wrestlers reaching the rank were Mongolian: Asashōryū, Hakuhō, Harumafuji and Kakuryū. In 2012, the Mongolian Kyokutenhō became the oldest wrestler in modern history to win a top division championship. 

Wrestlers from Eastern European countries such as Georgia and Russia have also found success in the upper levels of sumo. In 2005, Kotoōshū from Bulgaria became the first wrestler of European birth to attain the ranking and the first to win a top division championship.

Restrictions on the number of foreigners allowed in professional sumo began in May 1992, shortly after Ōshima stable had recruited six Mongolians at the same time. The Sumo Association&#x27;s new director Dewanoumi, announced that he was considering limiting the number of overseas recruits per stable and in sumo overall. There was no official ruling at the time, but no stable recruited any foreigners for the next six years. This unofficial ban was then relaxed, but only two new foreigners per stable were allowed, until the total number reached 40. Then in 2002, a one foreigner per stable policy was officially adopted, though the ban was not retroactive, so foreigners recruited before the changes were unaffected. The move has been met with criticism, not least because Japanese society, with its centuries-old and xenophobic culture, is accustomed to treating foreign wrestlers as , regardless of their place of birth, reinforcing the difference that the public and the media make between foreign and Japanese wrestlers. Paradoxically, all wrestlers involved in professional sumo are formally treated the same once they have joined the stables, and no distinction is clearly made as to any special treatment for foreigners. John Gunning also proposed another interpretation of the decision, claiming that this rule was not based on racist sentiment but to ensure that foreign assimilate into sumo culture. He explained, there would be ten Hawaiian wrestlers in the same stable living in their own &quot;little clique&quot;, not learning Japanese, so the rule &quot;protects the culture of stables.&quot;

Originally, it was possible for a place in a stable to open up if a foreign born wrestler acquired Japanese citizenship. This occurred when Hisanoumi changed his nationality from Tongan at the end of 2006, allowing another Tongan to enter his stable. However, on 23 February 2010 the Sumo Association announced that it had changed its definition of &quot;foreign&quot; to &quot;foreign-born&quot; (), meaning that even naturalized Japanese citizens will be considered foreigners if they were born outside of Japan. The restriction on one foreign wrestler per stable was also reconfirmed. As Japanese law does not recognize subcategories of Japanese citizen, this unique treatment of naturalized citizens may be illegal under Japanese law. Furthermore, since 1976, if a foreigner wishes to remain in the Sumo Association after his retirement, he must give up his nationality and become a Japanese citizen.

In July 2007, there were nineteen foreigners in the top two divisions, which was the all-time record of the time with, for the first time, a majority of overseas wrestlers in the top ranks. In June 2022 twenty-six foreign-born from nine countries were listed on the official .

==Society&#x27;s perception==
In Japan, wrestlers are perceived as gentle giants, possessing both a gentle character and great physical strength. During sumo&#x27;s first golden age in the late Edo period, the Japanese collective imagination first developed an image of larger-than-life wrestlers with excessive appetites and superhuman strength. Tales of thirteen-year-old Akashi lifting rocks to help his farmer father, Tanikaze separating two fighting bulls by grabbing them by the horns, or Shiranui lifting seven sacks of rice spread over his head and shoulders to impress Matthew C. Perry became popular myths and are credited to the wrestlers as biographical elements in their own right, like the stories of mythological heroes.

During the 1780s, wrestlers became veritable icons and card games and dolls depicting them became widespread. In order to benefit from the sport&#x27;s popularity, some physically strong individuals, called , were introduced for the duration of one or two tournaments as wrestlers, serving as an attraction without having any real wrestling ability. Production and distribution of works depicting the sport&#x27;s most popular figures also became more widespread, with authors like Utagawa Kunisada and Toyokuni, Hasegawa Sadanobu or Hiroshige who gained popularity thanks to their works. (picture books) and (erotic prints) were also mass-produced, with wrestlers as the central figures.

In more contemporary times, sumo&#x27;s links with ancient rituals for good health and good harvest are still alive and well. For example, it is traditional to ask a wrestler to carry babies, in the belief that the children will grow up healthy and strong. It is also traditional for children to be dressed as wrestlers so that the qualities of the latter influence them. It is also common for spectators to take advantage of the proximity of the wrestlers as they move through the (the two paths to the ring) to touch them, in the belief that this brings good luck. 

In a Japan still hit by numerous natural disasters, it is still common to see local communities requesting the performance of sumo-related rites performed by wrestlers in the belief that this will lessen the long-term effects of disasters.

==Health effects==

In contrast to many sports where fat is seen as something to be shed, sumo instead encourages the accumulation of fat as a weapon. Since the 2000s, the standards of weight gain became less strict to try to improve the health of the wrestlers. The Sumo Association ensures the health of its wrestlers by imposing an annual medical check-up. Sumo wrestlers have a life expectancy of 65, which is 10 years shorter than that of the average Japanese male, as the diet and sport take a toll on the wrestler&#x27;s body. The main health concern for wrestlers, however, remains the common cold or any other type of viral infection, which are easily transmitted in the (wrestlers&#x27; training quarters) environment, where the low-ranking wrestlers&#x27; dormitories are conducive to disease transmission. This ease of infection was particularly closely monitored in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, giving rise to numerous concerns about the number of wrestlers that could be affected by the virus.

<text>Paro District (Dzongkha: སྤ་རོ་རྫོང་ཁག་; Wylie: &quot;Spa-ro rdzong-khag&quot;) is a district (&quot;dzongkhag&quot;), valley, river and town (population 20,000) in Bhutan. It is one of the most historic valleys in Bhutan. Both trade goods and invading Tibetans came over the pass at the head of the valley, giving Paro the closest cultural connection with Tibet of any Bhutanese district. The dominant language in Paro is Dzongkha, the national language.

The only international airport in Bhutan, Paro International Airport, is located in Paro district.

==Geography==

Paro District is bordered by Haa district to the west, Tibet to the north, Thimphu district to the east, and Chukha district to the south.

==Administrative divisions==
Paro Districts comprises ten village blocks (or &quot;gewogs&quot;):

*Dokar Gewog
*Dopshari Gewog
*Doteng Gewog
*Hungrel Gewog
*Lamgong Gewog
*Lungnyi Gewog
*Naja Gewog
*Shapa Gewog
*Tsento Gewog
*Wangchang Gewog
==Environment==
Northern Paro District (the &quot;gewogs&quot; of Doteng and Tsento) contains part of Jigme Dorji National Park and the biological corridor connecting it to Torsa Strict Nature Reserve in neighboring Haa District.

==Cultural sites==

Important cultural sites of Paro include:
*Taktshang, or &quot;Tiger&#x27;s Nest&quot;, the most famous monastery and ancient highlights for the people of Bhutan. It was founded as a meditating cave by the famous saint Guru Padmasambhava in the early 8th century upon subjugating a demon and forcing him to take an oath to be the local protector of the region towards the very end.
*Kyichu Lhakhang, which along with Jambay Lhakhang in central Bhutan is the oldest temple in Bhutan, dating to the 7th century.
*Drukgyel Dzong, at the upper end of the valley, built to protect against invading Tibetans, but in ruins since a fire in the 1950s.
*Paro Town, the single market town in the dzonghag which is booming (by Bhutanese standards) due to an influx of tourist dollars.
*Rinpung Dzong, also known as Paro Dzong, the massive fortress/monastery which is also the administrative center of the dzonkhag. Scenes from the movie &quot;Little Buddha&quot; were filmed in and around this dzong.
*The National Museum of Bhutan, where visitors can learn about the culture of Bhutan.
*Dzongdrakha Goenpa is a sacred cliff of Guru Rinpoche above the two villages of Bonday and Gyepjag under Paro Dzongkhag blessed during his second visit to Bhutan in 822 A.D from Tibet.

<text>The Marais Poitevin () or Poitevin Marsh is a large area of marshland in the former province of Poitou in western France.

It is a remnant of what was the former . The western zone near the sea (about two-thirds of the area) is called the &quot;dry marsh&quot; (or &quot;dried marsh&quot;). It is used for farming and livestock breeding. The eastern zone, called the &quot;wet marsh&quot;, is a maze of islets crisscrossed by picturesque canals, primarily now a tourist destination for boating. It is nicknamed The Green Venice (&quot;la Venise Verte&quot;).

==Overview==
With an area of , this is the largest marsh on France&#x27;s Atlantic coast and the second largest of the country, after the Camargue in Provence. The Marais Poitevin is the most important area of angelica cultivation in France. Extending across three departments (Vendée, Deux-Sèvres, and Charente-Maritime), it is situated west of Niort, north of La Rochelle, and south of Fontenay-le-Comte.

In 1979 the Marais Poitevin was declared a Regional Natural Park (), in an effort to help preserve it. The marsh lost that status in 1997, due to intensive agricultural development around the Marsh that endangered the unique character of the region. Only a core Interregional Park (&quot;Parc Interrégional du Marais poitevin&quot;) of remains. Attempts to regain the full Park classification started in 2002, and supporters proposed a new charter in 2006. While this was accepted by the local authorities, it was rejected in late 2008 by the national government due to a perceived &quot;juridical fragility&quot;.

Tourism includes boating in traditional barques, which is a form of punting. There are several piers (), from which boats can be hired. The myriad canals have become covered in green duckweed (hence the Green Venice nickname). The drained marshland is home to a varied fauna.

==Geology==
The marsh developed above a limestone plateau, dating from the Jurassic period. This plateau covered much of the former province of Poitou. The Würm glaciation, c. 24,000–10,000 YBP, caused significant marine regression and the recovery of much river erosion (a watershed of c. 535,000 ha), thus exposing the marl-limestone formations. The villages of Maillezais, Saint-Michel-en-l&#x27;Herm, and Marans developed on such hillocks.

<doc id="749209" wikidata="Q1756474" url="?curid=749209" title="Peritoneal dialysis">
<text>Peritoneal dialysis (PD) is a type of dialysis that uses the peritoneum in a person&#x27;s abdomen as the membrane through which fluid and dissolved substances are exchanged with the blood. It is used to remove excess fluid, correct electrolyte problems, and remove toxins in those with kidney failure. Peritoneal dialysis has better outcomes than hemodialysis during the first two years. Other benefits include greater flexibility and better tolerability in those with significant heart disease.

== Side effects ==
Complications may include infections within the abdomen, hernias, high blood sugar, bleeding in the abdomen, and blockage of the catheter. Peritoneal dialysis is not possible in those with significant prior abdominal surgery or inflammatory bowel disease. It requires some degree of technical skill to be done properly.

== Mechanism ==

In peritoneal dialysis, a specific solution is introduced through a permanent tube in the lower abdomen and then removed. This may either occur at regular intervals throughout the day, known as continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD), or at night with the assistance of a machine, known as automated peritoneal dialysis (APD) or continuous cycling peritoneal dialysis (CCPD). 

The solution is typically made of sodium chloride, bicarbonate, and an osmotic agent. Glucose is the most commonly used osmotic agent and different concentrations of glucose in the dialysis fluid affect the ultrafiltration. Icodextrin is a high molecular weight glucose polymer developed as an alternative osmotic agent with slower absorbtion from the peritoneal cavity, facilitating better ultrafiltration. It is recommended for long dwells in patients with difficulties achieving or maintaining euvolemia. 

== History and culture ==
The solution used for peritoneal dialysis is on the World Health Organization&#x27;s List of Essential Medicines. As of 2009, peritoneal dialysis was available in 12 of 53 African countries.

== Medical uses ==
Peritoneal dialysis is a method of renal replacement therapy for those needing maintenance therapy for late stage chronic kidney disease and is an alternative to the most common method hemodialysis.

==Complications==

=== PD-related peritonitis ===
A common cause of peritonitis is touch contamination, e.g. insertion of catheter by un-sanitized hands, which potentially introduces bacteria to the abdomen; other causes include catheter complication, transplantation of bowel bacteria, and systemic infections. Most common type of PD-peritonitis infection (80%) are from bacterial sources. Infection rates are highly variable by region and within centers with estimated rates between 0.06 - 1.66 episodes per patient year. With recent technical advances peritonitis incidence has decreased over time.

Antibiotics are needed if the source of infection is bacterial; there is no clear advantage for other frequently used treatments such as routine peritoneal lavage or use of urokinase. The use of preventative nasal mupirocin is of unclear effect with respect to peritonitis. Of the three types of connection and fluid exchange systems (standard, twin-bag and y-set; the latter two involving two bags and only one connection to the catheter, the y-set uses a single y-shaped connection between the bags involving emptying, flushing out then filling the peritoneum through the same connection) the twin-bag and y-set systems were found superior to conventional systems at preventing peritonitis.

The fluid used for dialysis uses glucose as a primary osmotic agent. According to a 2020 review published in the &quot;American Journal of Nephrology&quot;, some studies suggest that the use of glucose increases the risk of peritonitis, possibly as a result of impaired host defenses, vascular disease, or damage to the peritoneal membrane. The acidity, high concentration and presence of lactate and products of the degradation of glucose in the solution (particularly the latter) may contribute to these health issues. Solutions that are neutral, use bicarbonate instead of lactate and have few glucose degradation products may offer more health benefits though this has not yet been studied.

The mortality rate of peritoneal dialysis related peritonitis is estimated to be 3-10%, with approximately 50% of cases resulting in hospitalization. Peritoneal fluid studies with a white blood cell count greater than 100 per μL and greater than 50% neutrophils strongly suggest peritonitis, with a definitive diagnosis based on culture of microorganisms from the peritoneal fluid. In order to avoid delaying treatment, a cloudy fluid in the dialysate fluid can be assumed to be due to peritonitis unless an alternative cause is identified. Peritonitis in those undergoing PD is usually due to gram positive bacteria. Intraperitoneal antibiotics are preferred to intravenous as they have a greater effect at the area of infection, unless sepsis is present, in which case intravenous antibiotics are indicated. The peritoneal dialysis catheter may have to be removed if the infection does not resolve with antibiotics, and it is recommended that the PD catheter be removed in all cases of fungal peritonitis.

=== Volume shifts ===
The volume of dialysate removed as well as patient&#x27;s weight are monitored. If more than 500ml of fluid are retained or a liter of fluid is lost across three consecutive treatments, the patient&#x27;s physician is generally notified. Excessive loss of fluid can result in hypovolemic shock or hypotension while excessive fluid retention can result in hypertension and edema. Also monitored is the color of the fluid removed: normally it is pink-tinged for the initial four cycles and clear or pale yellow afterward. The presence of pink or bloody effluent suggests bleeding inside the abdomen while feces indicates a perforated bowel and cloudy fluid suggests infection. The patient may also experience pain or discomfort if the dialysate is too acidic, too cold or introduced too quickly, while diffuse pain with cloudy discharge may indicate an infection. Severe pain in the rectum or perineum can be the result of an improperly placed catheter. The dwell can also increase pressure on the diaphragm causing impaired breathing, and constipation can interfere with the ability of fluid to flow through the catheter.

=== Chronic complications ===
Long term use of PD is rarely associated with fibrosis of the peritoneum. A potentially fatal complication estimated to occur in roughly 2.5% of patients is encapsulating peritoneal sclerosis, in which the bowels become obstructed due to the growth of a thick layer of fibrin within the peritoneum.

=== Other ===
Other complications include low back pain and hernia or leaking fluid due to high pressure within the abdomen. Hypertriglyceridemia and obesity are also concerns due to the large volume of glucose in the fluid, which can add 500-1200 calories to the diet per day.

==Method==
Best practices for peritoneal dialysis state that before peritoneal dialysis should be implemented, the person&#x27;s understanding of the process and support systems should be assessed, with education on how to care for the catheter and to address any gaps in understanding that may exist. The person should receive ongoing monitoring to ensure adequate dialysis, and be regularly assessed for complications. Finally, they should be educated on the importance of infection control and an appropriate medical regimen established with their cooperation.


The abdomen is cleaned in preparation for surgery and a catheter is surgically inserted with one end in the abdomen and the other protruding from the skin. Catheters can also be inserted without a general anaesthetic by a physician using a needle, known as a medical insertion. Both methods have similar safety profiles. Before each infusion the catheter must be cleaned, and flow into and out of the abdomen tested. 2-3 liters of dialysis fluid is introduced into the abdomen over the next ten to fifteen minutes. The total volume is referred to as a &quot;dwell&quot; while the fluid itself is referred to as dialysate. The dwell can be as much as 3 liters, and medication can also be added to the fluid immediately before infusion. The dwell remains in the abdomen and waste products diffuse across the peritoneum from the underlying blood vessels. After a variable period of time depending on the treatment (usually 4–6 hours ), the fluid is removed and replaced with fresh fluid. This can occur automatically while the patient is sleeping (automated peritoneal dialysis, APD), or during the day by keeping two litres of fluid in the abdomen at all times, exchanging the fluids four to six times per day (continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis, CAPD).

The fluid used typically contains sodium chloride, lactate or bicarbonate and a high percentage of glucose to ensure hyperosmolarity. The amount of dialysis that occurs depends on the volume of the dwell, the regularity of the exchange and the concentration of the fluid. APD cycles between 3 and 10 dwells per night, while CAPD involves four dwells per day of 2-3 liters per dwell, with each remaining in the abdomen for 4–8 hours. The viscera accounts for roughly four-fifths of the total surface area of the membrane, but the parietal peritoneum is the most important of the two portions for PD. Two complementary models explain dialysis across the membrane - the three-pore model (in which molecules are exchanged across membranes which sieve molecules, either proteins, electrolytes or water, based on the size of the pores) and the distributed model (which emphasizes the role of capillaries and the solution&#x27;s ability to increase the number of active capillaries involved in PD). The high concentration of glucose drives the filtration of fluid by osmosis (osmotic UF) from the peritoneal capillaries to the peritoneal cavity. Glucose diffuses rather rapidly from the dialysate to the blood (capillaries). After 4-6 h of the dwell, the glucose osmotic gradient usually becomes too low to allow for further osmotic UF. Therefore, the dialysate will now be reabsorbed from the peritoneal cavity to the capillaries by means of the plasma colloid osmotic pressure, which exceeds the colloid osmotic pressure in the peritoneum by approximately 18-20 mmHg (cf. the Starling mechanism). Lymphatic absorption will also to some extent contribute to the reabsorption of fluid from the peritoneal cavity to the plasma. Patients with a high water permeability (UF-coefficient) of the peritoneal membrane can have an increased reabsorption rate of fluid from the peritoneum by the end of the dwell. The ability to exchange small solutes and fluid in-between the peritoneum and the plasma can be classified as high (fast), low (slow) or intermediate. High transporters tend to diffuse substances well (easily exchanging small molecules between blood and the dialysis fluid, with somewhat improved results with frequent, short-duration dwells such as with APD), while low transporters have a higher UF (due to the slower reabsorption of glucose from the peritoneal cavity, which results in somewhat better results with long-term, high-volume dwells), though in practice either type of transporter can generally be managed through the appropriate use of either APD or CAPD.

Though there are several different shapes and sizes of catheters that can be used, different insertion sites, number of cuffs in the catheter and immobilization, there is no evidence to show any advantages in terms of morbidity, mortality or number of infections, though the quality of information is not yet sufficient to allow for firm conclusions.

A peritoneal equilibration test may be done to assess a person for peritoneal dialysis by determining the characteristics of the peritoneal membrane mass transport characteristics.

=== Improvised dialysis ===
Peritoneal dialysis can be improvised in conditions such as combat surgery or disaster relief using surgical catheters and dialysate made from routinely available medical solutions to provide temporary renal replacement for people with no other options.

==Epidemiology==
As of 2017, hemodialysis is the most widely available renal replacement modality found in 96% of countries whereas peritoneal dialysis (PD) is only available in 75% of countries. In 2016, the proportion of people receiving peritoneal dialysis (PD) was estimated at 11% with wide differences between different countries and regions. In Hong Kong and Mexico, PD is more common than the world average, with Mexico conducting most of its dialysis through PD, while Japan and Germany have rates lower than the world average. Peritoneal dialysis first models, patients requiring renal replacement therapy are placed on PD first, and financial incentives for using PD are associated with increase uptake of PD in multiple countries.

=== East and Southeast Asia ===
Hong Kong has the highest rate of PD use worldwide at 71.9% in 2014, while in Mainland China had 20% in 2014, 23% in Thailand during 2012, and 10-20% in Vietnam during 2011. Hong Kong had a PD-first model since 1985, Thailand began a PD-first model since 2008 which increased their levels of PD from &lt;10%.

=== Americas ===
Prevalence in of PD use was 9.7% in USA during 2013 and 16.3% in Canada during 2013. The lower PD rates in the USA are due to higher availability of large corporate owned hemodialysis centers. There have been recent increase in PD uptake in the USA due to changes to Medicare reimbursement such as bundled payment for dialysis this incentivizes use of PD which is a less costly modality for dialysis.

Overall, prevalence of PD use is 24.6% in Latin America during 2011. Within Latin America, hemodialysis has a higher growth rate in use compared to PD between 1994 - 2010. In 2010, the most prevalent use of PD were in Mexico 55.9% and El Salvador 67.6%. Between 2000 - 2010, Colombia&#x27;s PD rate dropped from 54% to 31.3%.

== History ==
Peritoneal dialysis was first carried out in the 1920s; however, long-term use did not come into medical practice until the 1960s. The timeline was
* 1923 – Georg Ganter performs the first peritoneal dialysis in a guinea pig and attempts the procedure in humans, without success. Hypertonic saline was used as the dialysate.
* 1927 – Heinrich Heusser and Hermann Werder were the first to treat 3 patients with continuous flow PD using two catheters. They demonstrated a decrease in the levels of blood urea, but did not suceed clinically.
* 1946 – Howard Frank, Arnold Seligman, and Jacob Fine of Beth Israel Hospital in Boston report the first successful use of peritoneal dialysis in clinical practice, in a 51-year-old man with acute renal failure caused by sulfathiazole poisoning.
* 1959 – Paul Doolan and Richard Ruben of Naval Hospital Oakland first use peritoneal dialysis to treat end-stage renal disease, in a 33-year-old woman named Willie Mae Stewart. After 6 months of intermittent dialysis, she declines further treatment due to complications and dies in June 1960.
* 1964–1965 – Henry Tenckhoff, G. Shilipetar and Fred Boen of the University of Washington report the first case of home peritoneal dialysis, with long-term success despite technical difficulties and a burdensome process.
* 1968 – Henry Tenckhoff creates the Tenckhoff catheter, avoiding the need to replace the catheter in the abdomen at every treatment.

== Comparison to hemodialysis ==
Compared to hemodialysis, PD allows greater patient mobility, produces fewer swings in symptoms due to its continuous nature, and phosphate compounds are better removed, but large amounts of albumin are removed which requires constant monitoring of nutritional status. The costs of PD are generally lower than those of HD in most parts of the world, this cost advantage is most apparent in developed economies. There is insufficient research to adequately compare the risks and benefits between CAPD and APD; a Cochrane Review of three small clinical trials found no difference in clinically important outcomes (i.e. morbidity or mortality) for patients with end stage renal disease, nor was there any advantage in preserving the functionality of the kidneys. The results suggested APD may have psychosocial advantages for younger patients and those who are employed or pursuing an education.

PD may also be used for patients with cardiac instability as it does not result in rapid and significant alterations to body fluids, and for patients with insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus due to the inability to control blood sugar levels through the catheter.

== Society and culture ==
=== Economics ===
The cost of dialysis treatment is related to how wealthy the country is. In the United States peritoneal dialysis costs the government about $53,400 per person per year.

<text>Pares (pronounced: ), also known as beef &quot;pares&quot;, is a term for a serving of Filipino braised beef stew with garlic fried rice, and a bowl of clear soup. It is a popular meal particularly associated with specialty roadside diner-style establishments known as &quot;paresan&quot; (&quot;Pares house&quot;). In recent years, it had also become a common dish served in small eateries called &quot;carinderias&quot; that serve economical meals for locals.

Informally, &quot;pares&quot; can also refer to any dish that is cooked in the manner reminiscent of the &quot;asado-style&quot; (i.e. stewed in a sweet-soy sauce).

==Etymology==
The origin of the term &quot;pares&quot; is credited to the carinderia &quot;Jonas&quot; established by Lolita Tiu and Roger Tiu in 1979 near the then named Calle Retiro (present-day N.S. Amoranto Sr. Street) in Quezon City. The term literally means &quot;pairs&quot; in English and comes from the practice of pairing the beef asado dish with &quot;sinangag&quot; (garlic fried rice) and a light beef broth soup; thus, forming a complete meal.

==Description==
Beef &quot;pares&quot;, or &quot;pares&quot; as it is commonly known, is a meal that consists of beef &quot;asado&quot; (beef stewed in a sweet-soy sauce), garlic fried rice, and a bowl of beef broth soup. The soup may originate from the broth in which the meat is simmered in until tender before being seasoned with the sweet-soy sauce, but it can also be prepared separately and be made with beef bouillon cubes instead. This soup is usually made and seasoned with onion, garlic, peppercorns, chives, and onion leeks. Some cooks also add bay leaves to this broth to improve the flavor.

Another variation of the dish, informally known as pares kariton (&quot;pushcart &quot;pares&quot;&quot;) or pares kanto (&quot;street corner &quot;pares&quot;&quot;) for being served on the roadside by mobile sidecar vendors, serves the beef and broth combined, usually with the broth slightly thickened by cornstarch. This variant is less sweeter and has less spices compared to the beef asado variant but is more savory due to the use of beef tendons (&quot;litid&quot;), bone marrow (&quot;utak ng buto&quot;), and fatty cuts of beef.

A garnish of chopped green onion and fried garlic mince is often added atop the dish before serving. Steamed rice is sometimes served instead of fried rice, depending on personal preference of the customer. Some Filipino restaurants also offer the option to serve the dish with an accompaniment of noodles instead of rice.

Another common way to eat &quot;pares&quot; is as beef &quot;pares mami (or simply pares mami&quot;). It combines &quot;pares&quot; with &quot;mami&quot;, the Filipino egg noodle soup. Its preparation is similar to &quot;pares kanto&quot; with the main difference being the addition of noodles instead of being eaten with rice. Its taste has been described as being similar to Vietnamese &quot;pho&quot;.

Pares overload refers to a recent trend of serving pares kanto with fried pork lechon and chicharong bulaklak (fried pork mesentery); a variant of this served with whole stewed bone marrow is also known as pares putok batok due to the unhealthy amount of fat and cholesterol contained by the toppings. It was introduced as early as 2021 and was popularized by the sidewalk eatery Diwata Pares Overload in the first quarter of 2024 with the trend having grown popularity through social media sites.

<text>Eduard Spranger (27 June 1882 – 17 September 1963) was a German philosopher and psychologist. A student of Wilhelm Dilthey, Spranger was born in Berlin and died in Tübingen. He was considered a humanist who developed a philosophical pedagogy as an act of &#x27;self defense&#x27; against the psychology-oriented experimental theory of the times.

Spranger was the author of the book &quot;Lebensformen&quot; (Translated as &quot;Types of Men&quot;), which sold 28,000 copies by the end of 1920. Spranger theorizes that types of human life are structures in consciousness. His belief was that personality types have a basis in biology, but can not be fully explained by biology. He wrote, &quot;On a lower level, perhaps, the soul is purely biologically determined. On a higher level, the historical, for instance, the soul participates in objective values which cannot be deduced from the simple value of self-preservation.&quot; He criticized psychologists who reduced the psyche and society to abstract elements of science. Another characteristic of Spranger&#x27;s thought is his interest in holism, which involves the discovery that &quot;everything is part of everything else,&quot; and that the &quot;totality of mind is present in every act.&quot; He asserts that quantitative calculations of sensations, reflexes, and citations from memory are meaningless units, that when synthesized, do not add up to the meaningful whole that we all live.

==Thought==
Spranger evaluated personalities in terms of six ideals or value orientations; theoretical, economic, aesthetic, social, political and religious &quot;types&quot; of personality traits.

Spranger contributed to the pedagogy of theory, in his book &quot;Types of Men&quot;. His value attitudes were: 
*The Theoretical, whose dominant interest is the discovery of truth
*The Economic, who is interested in what is useful
*The Aesthetic, whose highest value is form and harmony
*The Social, whose highest value is love of people
*The Political, whose interest is primarily in power
*The Religious, whose highest value is unity

Those six in more detail are:

Theoretical: A passion to discover, systemize and analyze; a search for knowledge.

Utilitarian: A passion to gain a return on all investments involving time, money and resources.

Aesthetic: A passion to experience impressions of the world and achieve form and harmony in life; self-actualization.

Social: A passion to invest myself, my time, and my resources into helping others achieve their potential.

Individualistic: A passion to achieve position and to use that position to affect and influence others.

Traditional: A passion to seek out and pursue the highest meaning in life, in the divine or the ideal, and achieve a system for living. This instrument is sometimes offered along with the DISC assessment.

<doc id="749247" wikidata="Q203268" url="?curid=749247" title="Michael C. Hall">
<text>Michael Carlyle Hall (born February 1, 1971) is an American actor and musician. He is known for playing the titular character in the Showtime series &quot;Dexter&quot; and David Fisher in the HBO drama series &quot;Six Feet Under&quot;. He won a Golden Globe Award for the former, three Screen Actors Guild Awards, and received six total nominations for the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Drama Series, which ties the record for most nominations in the category without a win. He reprised his role of Dexter Morgan in the miniseries &quot;&quot; and &quot;&quot;.

Born and raised in Raleigh, North Carolina, Hall graduated from New York University&#x27;s graduate acting program at the Tisch School of the Arts in 1996. He began his acting career on Broadway in the revival of &quot;Cabaret&quot; and appeared in a variety of shows throughout the 1990s. Aside from his roles on &quot;Six Feet Under&quot; and &quot;Dexter,&quot; he starred in the Broadway musical &quot;Hedwig and The Angry Inch&quot; and in films including &quot;Paycheck&quot;, &quot;Gamer&quot;, &quot;Mark Felt: The Man Who Brought Down the White House&quot;, &quot;Game Night&quot;, and &quot;In the Shadow of the Moon&quot;.

== Early life ==
Michael C. Hall was born in Raleigh, North Carolina. His mother, Janice (née Styons) Hall, is a mental health counselor at Lees-McRae College, and his father, William Carlyle Hall, was a systems engineer manager for IBM. Hall had one older sister who died in infancy before his birth. His father died of prostate cancer in 1982 at the age of 39 when Hall was 11 years old. He has said of this, &quot;There was a very one-on-one, immediate family relationship, my mom and I.&quot; In a 2004 interview, Hall spoke about his experience in the wake of his father&#x27;s death: &quot;Certainly, for a young boy, there&#x27;s no good age, but I think I was on the cusp of a time in my life where I was starting to reach puberty, to relate to my father. To have him ... something gets frozen. As you revisit it for the rest of your life, it&#x27;s sort of this slow—but hopefully sure—crawling out of that frozen moment.&quot;

Hall discovered acting early in life: he performed in &quot;What Love Is&quot; when he was in second grade at Ravenscroft School in Raleigh, North Carolina. In fifth grade, he began singing, first in a boys&#x27; choir, and later, in high school, in musicals, performing in standards such as &quot;The Sound of Music&quot;, &quot;Oklahoma!&quot;, and &quot;Fiddler on the Roof&quot;. Hall graduated from Ravenscroft School in 1989 and enrolled at Earlham College, a liberal arts college in Richmond, Indiana. At Earlham, Hall continued acting, starring in &quot;Cabaret&quot; and other productions. Hall graduated from Earlham College with a Bachelor of Arts in 1993. While he has said that he had planned to become a lawyer, he later acknowledged that he had never formed a serious intent to go to law school. Additionally, Hall graduated with a Master of Fine Arts from New York University&#x27;s graduate acting program at the Tisch School of the Arts in 1996.

== Career ==

=== Early work ===
Hall&#x27;s professional acting career began in the theater. Off-Broadway, he appeared in &quot;Macbeth&quot; and &quot;Cymbeline&quot; at the New York Shakespeare Festival; in &quot;Timon of Athens&quot; and &quot;Henry V&quot; at The Public Theater; &quot;The English Teachers&quot; at the Manhattan Class Company (MCC); and the controversial play &quot;Corpus Christi&quot; at the Manhattan Theatre Club. He also performed the role of Paris Singer in the workshop production of a Stephen Sondheim musical (titled &quot;Wise Guys&quot; at the time, and in later versions, &quot;Bounce&quot; and then &quot;Road Show&quot;. His character&#x27;s songs and function were transferred to the character Hollis Bessamer in the final version.) In Los Angeles, Hall appeared in &quot;Skylight&quot; at the Mark Taper Forum. As part of the Texas Shakespeare Festival in the summer of 1995, he played Lancelot in &quot;Camelot&quot;, Lysander in &quot;A Midsummer Night&#x27;s Dream&quot;, and Claudio in &quot;Much Ado About Nothing&quot;. In 1998, Hall performed in William Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Cymbeline&quot;, in the role of Posthumus Leonatus, which ran from August 4 to 30. In 1999, director Sam Mendes cast Hall as the flamboyant Emcee in the revival of &quot;Cabaret&quot;; this was Hall&#x27;s first Broadway role. Hall&#x27;s film credits from this period include the thriller &quot;Paycheck&quot; (2003) and the science fiction thriller &quot;Gamer&quot; (2009).

=== 2000s ===

Mendes suggested Hall for the role of closeted David Fisher, when Alan Ball began casting the TV drama &quot;Six Feet Under&quot;. &quot;Everything opened up for me in &quot;Cabaret&quot;,&quot; but, Hall reported in a 2004 interview, &quot;It slammed shut for David.&quot; Hall&#x27;s work in the first season of &quot;Six Feet Under&quot; was recognized with a nomination for an Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Drama Series and for an AFI Award nomination for Actor of the Year in 2002.

In 2005, he returned to off-Broadway theater in the premiere of Noah Haidle&#x27;s &quot;Mr. Marmalade&quot;, playing the title character, an emotionally disturbed little girl named Lucy&#x27;s imaginary friend.

Hall starred in and co-produced the Showtime television series &quot;Dexter&quot;, in which he played Dexter Morgan, a psychopathic blood-spatter analyst for the Miami Metro Police Department, who moonlights as a serial killer/vigilante. Jennifer Carpenter played his adoptive sister, Debra Morgan. The series premiered on October 1, 2006, and ended its run in 2013. After months of rumors, on April 18, 2013, Showtime announced via social media that season eight would be &quot;Dexter&quot;″s final season. Hall also voiced Dexter Morgan in the animated web series &quot;Dexter: Early Cuts&quot;. For his work on &quot;Dexter&quot;, Hall was nominated for five Emmy Awards for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Drama Series from 2008 to 2012. The show itself was also nominated for Emmy citations in the Drama Series category in the same years. He won the 2007 Television Critics Association award for Individual Achievement in Drama at the 23rd TCA Awards.

In 2014, he returned to Broadway in the play &quot;The Realistic Joneses&quot;, starring in the role of John Jones. He assumed the title role in &quot;Hedwig and The Angry Inch&quot; on Broadway on October 16, 2014, and performed the role until January 18, 2015. Hall returned to the role of Hedwig from February 17–21, 2015, to replace John Cameron Mitchell, who had a knee injury.

At the end of 2015 and the start of 2016, Hall starred as Thomas Newton in the NYTW stage production of &quot;Lazarus&quot;, created by David Bowie and Enda Walsh. Hall performed the song &quot;Lazarus&quot;, which appeared on Bowie&#x27;s final album, &quot;Blackstar&quot; (2016), on &quot;The Late Show with Stephen Colbert&quot; in December 2015. He later appeared in the London production from October 25, 2016, until January 22, 2017. In 2017, Hall played US President John F. Kennedy in season two, episode eight, &quot;Dear Mrs Kennedy&quot;, of the Netflix historical drama &quot;The Crown,&quot; alongside actress Jodi Balfour as First Lady Jackie Kennedy. Hall starred as Tom Delaney, a British widower and doctor, in &quot;Safe&quot;, an eight-part Netflix original crime drama which premiered on May 10, 2018.

Hall met drummer Yanowitz while performing together in &quot;Hedwig and The Angry Inch&quot;. They struck up a friendship and soon began collaborating on songs with Katz-Bohen, who was also a member of the Hedwig cast.

On February 3, 2019, Hall starred as a fictionalized version of himself in the half-hour-long, one-time-only Broadway musical, &quot;Skittles Commercial: The Broadway Musical&quot;. That same year, Hall starred as Holt in the Netflix thriller film &quot;In the Shadow of the Moon&quot;. Hall voices the character Toffee in Daron Nefcy&#x27;s &quot;Star vs. the Forces of Evil&quot; and also voiced Batman in &quot;Justice League: Gods and Monsters&quot;. Also in 2019, Hall starred alongside Martha Plimpton and Hamish Linklater in an episode of the theatre podcast &quot;Playing on Air&quot;, titled &quot;Nudity Rider&quot;. In 2019, Princess Goes filmed their first music video for their song, &quot;Ketamine&quot;, in Tarrytown, New York. The audio for the song was featured in the end credits for &quot;&quot; episode 5 &quot;Runaway&quot;, and &quot;Ketamine&quot; has been remixed by several artists on the &quot;Ketamine&quot; EP.

=== 2020s ===

Hall previously stated he would be open to returning for a &quot;Dexter&quot; spinoff series, but said: &quot;I can&#x27;t even wrap my mind around that. And it&#x27;s all just theoretical until there is some sort of script reflecting somebody&#x27;s idea of where it could possibly go. But it&#x27;s hard for me to imagine what that would be. Yeah, as far as playing Dexter again for an undefined amount of time, that&#x27;s a little daunting to consider. But doing another television series—there&#x27;s a lot of amazing stuff on TV. I don&#x27;t want to do that right away. But I wouldn&#x27;t say never to that.&quot; He has said he would consider revisiting his role as the serial killer if something was written that he deemed &quot;worth pursuing&quot;. Showtime president David Nevins said there had been discussions for a &quot;Dexter&quot; spinoff series that would take the character in a different direction and not continue the previous series. Nevins said they would only do the show if Hall agreed to return. In October 2020, Showtime confirmed that Hall would reprise his role of Dexter Morgan in a 10-episode limited series, with Clyde Phillips returning as showrunner. The series premiered on November 7, 2021 and ended on January 9, 2022. The series finale was the most watched finale in the history of the network, it also set streaming records as well.

Princess Goes to the Butterfly Museum released their eponymous debut EP on April 2, 2020. In 2021, the band self released their first full length album, &quot;Thanks for Coming&quot;. In 2023, the band released their second full length album, &quot;Come of Age&quot; through So/In De Goot Recordings, simultaneously shortening their name to Princess Goes. On September 21, 2024, the band played Riot Fest in Chicago. Princess Goes has toured all over the globe and continues to record and perform their music.

== Personal life ==
In 2002, Hall married actress Amy Spanger. The summer after their wedding, Hall played Billy Flynn opposite Spanger&#x27;s Roxie Hart in the Broadway musical &quot;Chicago&quot;. The pair divorced in 2006. In 2007, Hall began dating his &quot;Dexter&quot; co-star Jennifer Carpenter. They eloped on New Year&#x27;s Eve 2008 in California and publicly appeared together for the first time as a married couple at the 66th Golden Globe Awards in January 2009. In December 2010, Hall and Carpenter released a statement announcing that they had filed for divorce after having been separated &quot;for some time&quot;. The divorce was granted for irreconcilable differences and finalized in December 2011; however, the two remain close friends. In September 2012, Hall began dating Morgan Macgregor, who was an associate editor at the &quot;Los Angeles Review of Books&quot;, and they married on February 29, 2016.

On January 13, 2010, Hall&#x27;s agent and spokesman confirmed that Hall was undergoing treatment for a form of Hodgkin&#x27;s lymphoma. In an interview, Hall said that it was upsetting to learn of his cancer when he was 38 years old, as his father had died from cancer at age 39. Hall accepted his Golden Globe and Screen Actors Guild Award in 2010 while wearing a knitted cap over his bald head, having lost his hair due to chemotherapy, which he covered with a wig in season 5 of &quot;Dexter&quot;. On April 25, 2010, Carpenter announced that Hall&#x27;s cancer was fully in remission and he was set to get back to work for the 6th season of &quot;Dexter&quot;.

Hall is the face of the Somalia Aid Society&#x27;s &quot;Feed the People&quot; campaign. He has also worked with Kiehl&#x27;s to promote a limited-edition skin care line that benefits the Waterkeeper Alliance, an environmental nonprofit organization that works toward clean and safe water worldwide. In 2011, Hall was the celebrity spokesperson for the Leukemia &amp; Lymphoma Society&#x27;s &quot;Light the Night Walk&quot; fundraising campaign.

<text>The Bank of France ( , the name used by the bank to refer to itself in all English communications) is the national bank of France and the French member bank of the Eurosystem. It was established by Napoleon Bonaparte in 1800 as a private-sector corporation with unique public status. It was granted note-issuance monopoly in Paris in 1803 and in the entire country in 1848, issuing the French franc. Long independent from direct political interference, it was brought under government control in 1936 and eventually nationalized in 1945. While other banks of issue were established in the French colonial empire, the Bank of France remained Metropolitan France&#x27;s sole monetary authority until end-1998, when France adopted the euro as its currency.

The Bank of France long held high prestige as an anchor of financial stability, especially before the monetary turmoil that followed World War I. In 1907, Italian economist and statesman Luigi Luzzatti referred to the Bank of France as &quot;the centre of the world&#x27;s monetary power.&quot;

The French framework for banking supervision was initiated by the Vichy Government in 1941 and entrusted from the start to a separate body under the aegis of the Bank of France, which in 2013 became the French Prudential Supervision and Resolution Authority (French acronym ACPR). The ACPR lost its notional autonomy from the Bank of France in 2017.

==History==
===Background===

The Kingdom of France&#x27;s first experiment with a central bank was the &quot;Banque Générale&quot; (Banque Générale Privée or &quot;General Private Bank&quot;), set up by John Law at the behest of the Duke of Orléans after the death of Louis XIV. Law received the bank&#x27;s 20-year charter in May 1716 and its stock consisted of 1,200 shares valued at 5,000 livres apiece. It was meant to stimulate France&#x27;s stagnant economy and pay down its staggering national debt acquired from Louis XIV&#x27;s wars, including the War of the Spanish Succession. It was nationalized in December 1718 at Law&#x27;s request and formally renamed the &quot;Banque Royale&quot; a month later. It saw great initial success, increasing industry 60% in two years, but Law&#x27;s mercantilist policies saw him seek to establish large monopolies, leading to the Mississippi bubble. The bubble ultimately burst in a financial crisis in 1720, and on 27 November of that year, the &quot;Banque Royale&quot; officially closed.

The collapse of the Mississippi Company and the Banque Royale tarnished the word &quot;banque&quot; (&quot;bank&quot;) so much that France abandoned central banking for almost a century, possibly precipitating Louis XVI&#x27;s economic crisis and the French Revolution. Successors such as the Caisse d&#x27;Escompte (from 1776 to 1793) and &quot;Caisse d&#x27;escompte du commerce&quot; (from 1797 to 1803) used the word &quot;caisse&quot; instead, until Napoleon retook the term with &quot;la Banque de France&quot; (&quot;Bank of France&quot;) in 1800.

===Creation===

In 1803, financial power in France was in the hands of fifteen members of the Haute Banque, when the shareholders&#x27; meeting ratified the appointment of a “Council of Regency” composed of Jean-Frédéric Perregaux, , Jean-Barthélemy Le Couteulx de Canteleu, , Jacques-Rose Récamier, , , , , , , , Claude Perier, , , and Jean-Conrad Hottinguer. These powerful bankers, representative of the financial elite that would become referred to in France as the &quot;Haute banque&quot;, were deeply involved in the agitations leading up to the French Revolution. When the revolutionary violence got out of hand, they orchestrated the rise of Napoleon Bonaparte, whom they regarded as the restorer of order. As a reward for their support, Napoleon, in 1800, gave the bankers a monopoly over French finance by giving them control of the new Bank of France (Banque de France). Banker Claude Perier drafted the first statutes and Emmanuel Crétet was the first governor of the Bank. 

On 24 Germinal, year XI (14 April 1803), the new Bank received its first official charter granting it the exclusive right to issue paper money in Paris for fifteen years.

===Development===

On 22 April 1806, a new law replaced the Central Committee with a Governor and two Deputy Governors. All three were appointed by the Emperor. On 16 January 1808, a decree set out the &quot;Basic Statutes&quot;, which were to govern the Bank&#x27;s operations until 1936.

For the first fifteen years, the Bank of France was the sole issuer of bank notes in Paris, and this privilege was extended to other financially important cities and the rest of the country by 1848.

The Bank was also instrumental in the creation of the Latin Monetary Union (LMU) in 1865. The countries of France, Belgium, Italy, and the Swiss Confederation established the LMU franc as a common bimetallic currency.

In World War I, the Bank sold short-term Treasury bonds abroad to help pay for wartime expenditures. France abandoned the gold standard shortly after the outbreak of war. Debts amounted to approximately 42 billion francs by 1919. Following the war, the Bank sought to re-establish the gold standard and acquired capital from a number of American and British banking syndicates to defend the franc from exchange-rate fluctuations. The Bank also began to hoard gold reserves and, at its peak, held 28.3 percent of the world&#x27;s gold stock (only behind the United States at 30.4 percent). Some scholars have asserted that this gold accumulation was a contributing factor to the Great Depression. Under Émile Moreau, Governor from 1926 to 1930, the Bank consolidated gold reserves created a stabilization insurance fund (&quot;fonds de stabilisation&quot;), and tested new monetary policies in the wake of a global depression.

In World War II, the Bank oversaw the transfer of gold reserves overseas, which mainly included Canada, the United States, and the French overseas territories. In 1945, the Bank was nationalized by Charles de Gaulle and became a state-owned institution. Existing shareholders received bonds to replace their shares in the company. The Bank&#x27;s statute was reformed in 1973.

In 1993, the Bank of France was again reformed when it obtained independence from the state. It sought to establish credibility by promising to adhere to the single mandate of price stability. Jean-Claude Trichet, Governor from 1993 to 2003, was the final Governor of the Bank until the establishment of the European Central Bank (ECB) in June 1998. Today, the ECB sets monetary policy and oversees price stability for all countries in the Eurozone, including France.

On 1 June 1998, a new institution was created, the European Central Bank (ECB), charged with steering the single monetary policy for the euro. The body formed by the ECB, and the national central banks (NCB) of all the member states of the European Union, constitute the European System of Central Banks (ESCB). According to the Maastrict Treaty, the Bank would oversee the functioning of the payment system and conduct independent research on the French economy, while the newly established European Central Bank conducted monetary policy for the entire Eurozone. The French franc was replaced by the Euro as a virtual currency on 1 January 1999, being replaced entirely with coins and banknotes on 1 March 2002.

Following the Great Recession, the Bank of France implemented quantitative easing for the account of the ECB.

In 2010, the French government&#x27;s Autorité de la concurrence (the department in charge of regulating competition) fined eleven banks, including Bank of France, the sum of €384,900,000 for colluding to charge unjustified fees on check processing, especially for extra fees charged during the transition from paper check transfer to &quot;Exchanges Check-Image&quot; electronic transfer.

The Bank recently established a &quot;Lab&quot;, located on the Rue Réaumur in Paris, where start-ups and small businesses work on blockchain, artificial intelligence, and virtual reality. The Bank is the first to set up a blockchain system.

With the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic and the ensuing economic crisis, the Eurosystem resolved to inject €3 trillion of liquidity into banks, allowing them in turn to support households and businesses, particularly with regard to urgent cash flow needs. In addition to membership in the Eurosystem, the Banque de France is in charge of credit mediation. This service, which has been in very high demand during the crisis, provides assistance to companies facing difficulties in their relations with financial institutions. The Banque de France manages procedures to resolve overindebtedness, and while its premises are no longer open to the public, requests continue to be processed.

==Activities==
The Bank of France describes itself as responsible for three missions: monetary strategy, financial stability, and services to the economy.

=== Monetary policy ===
The Bank of France contributes to the design of the monetary policy of the Eurozone, through macroeconomic research and forecast and by taking part in the deliberations on ECB decisions, and implements it in France. It prints euro bank notes, in larger volumes than any of its Eurosystem peers, and manages the circulation of bank notes and coins. It also participates in the fight against counterfeit money, by training bank employees, merchants, police, and other stakeholders. It manages part of the foreign exchange reserves of the ECB.

=== Financial stability ===
The Bank of France participates in the prudential oversight of the French financial sector through the Prudential Supervision and Resolution Authority (ACPR) which operates under its aegis. 

The Banque de France also has special responsibilities with regard to payment systems and financial market infrastructures. It has direct oversight responsibility over LCH SA, a central counterparty (CCP); Euroclear France and ID2S, two central securities depositories; and CORE(FR) and SEPA.EU, two retail payment systems operated by STET SA. It is also involved in the cooperative oversight of ten infrastructures for which the lead oversight role belongs to another institution:
* Four infrastructures under the Eurosystem oversight framework led by the European Central Bank: T2, T2S, EURO1, and STEP2-T; 
* Four EU-based CCPs with an EMIR College: LCH Ltd (led by the Bank of England), Eurex Clearing (led by BaFin), CC&amp;G (led by the Bank of Italy), and EuroCCP (led by De Nederlandsche Bank); 
* Two global infrastructures with an international cooperative oversight framework, SWIFT (led by the National Bank of Belgium) and CLS (led by the U.S. Federal Reserve).

Like many other central banks, the Bank of France publishes a periodical Financial Stability Review (&quot;Revue de la Stabilité Financière&quot;).

=== Services to the economy ===
The Bank of France provides services to households, businesses, and the French state: 
* It is in charge of offering services to households in severe financial difficulty. This includes the management of over-indebtedness (one of the major tasks of the local branches of the bank), and the guarantee to an access to basic banking services for everyone, such as the right to a basic bank account. It is also in charge of financial and economic education of the general public, by developing an economic culture among specific populations (like youngsters and households in severe financial difficulty). This includes sensitizing high school students, providing online information and educational services, training social workers and the launch of the French Cité de l&#x27;économie et de la monnaie (Citéco), a museum based in the 17th district of Paris, in 2019.
* It provides company ratings for non-listed companies, which can for instance be used by business leaders to obtain credit from their bank. It also manages credit mediation (mediation between companies and their banks, their credit insurers, etc.) and proposes support to very small businesses (advice for their development and needs). The Bank of France publishes a number of economic surveys, national and regional statistics, destined to businesses.

==Governance==
The governor of the Bank of France is appointed by the president and is, as of 2019, François Villeroy de Galhau, since 1 November 2015. He presides over the Bank&#x27;s General Council, the body responsible for deliberating on all matters relating to non-Eurosystem activities. As of late 2023, the first deputy governor was and the second deputy governor was Agnès Bénassy-Quéré.

==Key figures==
In 2019, the main key figures of the Bank of France are as follows: 
* Number of full-time employees: 9,857
* Regional branches: 95 
*Profit before tax : 6.5 billion euros
* Dividend distributed to the French state : 6.1 billion euros

==Buildings==

A decree on 6 March 1808 authorized the Bank to purchase the former mansion of the Count of Toulouse in the rue de la Vrillière in Paris for its headquarters. The bank&#x27;s head office subsequently expanded from that original property, through the acquisition and remodeling of adjacent buildings and in the surrounding neighborhood. A major expansion occurred in 1924-1927 as part of an urban renewal project that entailed the demolition of several historical buildings and the creation of a new thoroughfare, the . It entailed the erection of a new complex for the bank above a large underground bunker known as the , designed by architect Alphonse Defrasse.

The Bank of France commissioned the erection of branches in many French towns and cities, which are often prominent in the urban landscape. 

In 2019, the bank opened its museum, the Cité de l&#x27;économie et de la monnaie, in a former branch in the 17th arrondissement of Paris. This followed comparable initiatives in Europe such as the Museum of the National Bank of Belgium (opened 1982), the Bank of England Museum (1988), and the (1999).

<text>The Bank of Thailand (BOT; abbr. ธปท.; , ) is the central bank of Thailand.

== History ==
The Bank of Thailand (BOT) was first set up as the Thai National Banking Bureau. The Bank of Thailand Act was promulgated on 28 April 1942 vesting upon the Bank of Thailand the responsibility for all central banking functions. The Bank of Thailand started operations on 10 December 1942.

The Bank of Thailand Act, B.E. 2485 was later amended in order to put emphasis on its social responsibility, to create a mechanism to guard against economic crisis, as well as to set up its decision making process to ensure good governance and transparency in the organization. The Bank of Thailand Act, B.E. 2551 came into force on 4 March 2008.

<text>The Central Bank of the Russian Federation (), commonly known as the Bank of Russia (), also called the Central Bank of Russia (CBR), is the central bank of the Russian Federation. The bank was established on 13 July 1990. It traces its beginnings to the State Bank of the Russian Empire established in 1860. 

The bank is headquartered on Neglinnaya Street in Moscow. Its functions are described in the Constitution of Russia (Article 75), as well as in federal law.

==History==
Shortly after declaring sovereignty in June 1990, the Russian SFSR decreed the creation of a central bank under the leadership of . Matiukhin commandeered Russian branches of the State Bank of the USSR and brought them under the control of the Bank of the RSFSR. A comprehensive central bank statute was passed in December 1990 and the bank adopted a charter in June 1991. A remnant of the State Bank continued to operate alongside it until it was dissolved along with the Soviet Union in December 1991, and the Bank of Russia assumed its remaining business.

Since 1992, the Bank of Russia began to buy and sell foreign currency on the foreign exchange market created by it, establish and publish the official exchange rates of foreign currencies against the ruble.

In 2006 capital controls mandate by the RCB began to ease, as confidence in the ruble mounted from the depths of the 1990s. Legislation continued to ease through the 2010s. The 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine reversed this trend. 

In August 2023 the RCB raised the primary interest rate from 8.5% to 12%. At the same time president Vladimir Putin was said to be considering capital controls on exporters from Russia, who would have to convert 80% of foreign funds to the ruble. This would be done in order artificially to increase demand for the domestic currency. In April 2024 this measure was prolonged for another year, from the original term of six months. It was reported that &quot;43 major Russian commodities groups&quot; were affected. At the time the ruble was trading at 93 to the US dollar.

In October 2023 western firms that wanted to exit the Russian economy were doubly fleeced when they were told about extraordinary capital controls. On 15 July 2024 the CBRF closed the statistics of the over-the-counter currency market; at the time it was under pressure from international sanctions over the Russian invasion of Ukraine.

On 26 July 2024 the CBRF hiked its primary interest rate by 200 basis points to 18%. In 2024 Q2, core inflation increased to 9.2% in annualised terms and labour shortages continued to grow.

In September 2024 it was reported that the RCB had allowed the Rosoboronexport to buy US banknotes from the Rwandan Ministry of Defence while entities in Russia were interdicted from having US currency.

On 13 September 2024 the RCB raised its primary interest rate to 19%.

==Role and duties==
According to the constitution, it is an independent entity, with the primary responsibility of protecting the stability of the national currency, the ruble.

Before 1 September 2013, it was the main regulator of the Russian banking industry, responsible for banking licenses, rules of banking operations and accounting standards, serving as a lender of last resort for credit organizations. After pointed date functions and powers of CBR were significantly expanded and the central bank received the status of a mega-regulator of all financial markets of Russia.

It holds the exclusive right to issue ruble banknotes and coins through the Moscow and St. Petersburg mints, the
Goznak mint. The central bank issues commemorative coins made of precious and non-precious metals as well as investment ones made of precious metals, which are distributed inside and outside the country. In 2010, in honor of its 150th anniversary it issued a 5-kilo commemorative gold coin Alexander II.

Under Russian law, half of the bank&#x27;s profit must be channeled into the government&#x27;s federal budget. The Central Bank of Russia is a member of the BIS.

The Bank of Russia owns a 57.58% stake in Sberbank, the country&#x27;s leading commercial bank.
The Bank of Russia also owns a 100% stake in Russian National Reinsurance Company (RNRC), the biggest national reinsurance company. The RNRC was established in July 2016 to prevent possible problems with reinsurance of large risks under international sanctions during the Russo-Ukrainian War, like constructing the Crimean Bridge.

The Bank of Russia is actively working on financial literacy of the population. In particular, the Fincult project is developing a website with materials aimed at improving financial literacy of the population, combating fraud through a description of all fraudulent schemes.

The Bank of Russia is also involved in working with citizens&#x27; pension savings. Pensions in Russia remain very low. For 2024, the minimum social pension is set at 13,269 rubles (147 US dollars). Since there is not enough money in the budget, citizens are offered to save for retirement on their own. To this end, since 2024, the Bank of Russia and all its regional divisions have been actively promoting the Long-term Savings Program developed by the Bank of Russia.

The main feature of the long–term savings program is co-financing by the state. That is, citizens who have joined the program will receive an increase in their savings from the state for a certain time. Thus, people can form additional capital for their priority goals in the future, for example, to buy a home or educate children, create a financial &quot;safety cushion&quot; or use this money as an increase to a pension, she said in an interview Bankiros.ru representative of the Central Bank of the Russian Federation Larisa Pavlova.

===Anti-fraud activities===
A key prospective witness in improper financial affairs was Lyubov Tarasova () who was a senior auditor for the Central Bank of Russia and worked for the &quot;Unicom&quot; () auditing firm which had been established on 20 August 1991 and was responsible for &quot;checking the correctness of the documentation and the essence of business transactions that are in doubt&quot; (), but was stabbed to death in her apartment in Moscow on 15-16 October 1997.

In 2017, within the framework of a joint anti-phishing project of the Bank of Russia and search engine Yandex, a special check mark (a green circle with a tick and &#x27;Реестр ЦБ РФ&#x27; (Bank of Russia Register) text box) appeared in the search results, informing the consumer that the website is really owned by a legally registered company licensed by the Bank of Russia.

== Governors ==

The President of the Board of Directors of the Central Bank is the head of the central banking system of the Russian Federation. The Governor is chosen by the President of Russia; and serves for four-year-terms after appointment. A Governor may be appointed for several consecutive terms (Sergey Ignatyev was the Governor of the Central Bank for 11 years, and he was appointed three times, in the longest serving term in post-soviet Russia).

==Subsidiaries==

The Central Bank of Russia holds directly significant participatory interests in a number of Russian companies:
* Sberbank of Russia (50%+1 voting share of the stock);
*Moscow Exchange (11.779% of the stock);
* Russian National Reinsurance Company (100% of the stock);
* Trust company of the Banking Sector Consolidation Fund (100% of the stock);
* Rosincas (Russian Association of Cash-in-transit).
Additionally, the Bank of Russia held earlier interests in some other Russian organizations. In particular, after the liquidation of Gosbank (State Bank of the USSR), the CBR beneficially acquired complete or controlling interests in five so-called &quot;Russian Foreign Banks&quot; (until 1991 – &quot;Soviet Foreign Banks&quot;): 
* VTB Bank (99.99% of the stock – until 2002, now - 60.9% owned by The Federal Agency for State Property Management (Rosimushchestvo) );
* Donau Bank AG, Vienna;
* East-West United Bank, Luxemburg;
* Eurobank, Paris;
* Moscow Narodny Bank, London;
* Ost-West Handelsbank, Frankfurt am Main.
All of them were members of the USSR Vnesheconombank system and were transferred to the CBR in 1992 by the Resolution of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of Russia. For over five years – 2000 to 2005 – all stocks of the Russian Foreign Banks were being purchased from the Bank of Russia by VTB Bank.
As part of the financial support to credit institutions, the Bank of Russia invests in them through the Banking Sector Consolidation Fund and acquires (on a temporary and indirect basis) shares in the equity of such banks. The first project of this kind was Otkritie FC Bank, in summer 2017.

==Policies==
In December 2014, amidst falling global oil prices, international sanctions during the Russo-Ukrainian War, capital flight, and fears of recession, the bank had increased the one-week minimum auction repo rate up by 6.5 points to 17 percent. This caused a run on the ruble, and on 29 January, the bank decreased the rate by two points to 15 percent.

In January 2015, the head of monetary policy, Ksenia Yudayeva, a proponent of strict anti-inflation policy, was replaced by Dmitry Tulin, who is &quot;seen as more acceptable to bankers, who have called for lower interest rates&quot;.

In response to the 2021–2022 Russo-Ukrainian crisis, multiple countries imposed economic sanctions against Russian banks. On 22 February 2022, US president Joe Biden announced restrictions of activities by US citizens involved with the Bank of Russia and others. In March, the Bank of International Settlements suspended the Bank of Russia. In March 2022, the Depository Trust &amp; Clearing Corporation blocked Russian securities from the Bank of Russia and Russia&#x27;s finance ministry.
At the end of May 2022, three months into the invasion of Ukraine, the central bank cut interest rates in an effort to prop up the increasingly isolated Russian economy, suffering shortages and supply chain issues. The inflation rate rose to 17.8 percent in April. Also the ruble reached its strongest level against the U.S. dollar in four years, hurting exports. The central bank announced a possible rate cut in 2025 due to stabilising inflation on the 1000th day of the Ukraine war.

Sanctions also included asset freezes on the Russian Central Bank, which holds $630 billion in foreign-exchange reserves, to prevent it from offsetting the impact of sanctions. On 5 May 2022, President of the European Council Charles Michel said: &quot;I am absolutely convinced that this is extremely important not only to freeze assets but also to make possible to confiscate it, to make it available for the rebuilding&quot; of Ukraine.

<text>The Peace River () is a river in Canada that originates in the Rocky Mountains of northern British Columbia and flows to the northeast through northern Alberta. The Peace River joins the Athabasca River in the Peace-Athabasca Delta to form the Slave River, a tributary of the Mackenzie River. The Finlay River, the main headwater of the Peace River, is regarded as the ultimate source of the Mackenzie River. The combined Finlay–Peace–Slave–Mackenzie river system is the 13th longest river system in the world.

== History ==
The regions along the river are the traditional home of the Dane-zaa people, called the Beaver by the Europeans. The fur trader Peter Pond is believed to have visited the river in 1785. In 1788 Charles Boyer of the North West Company established a fur trading post at the river&#x27;s junction with the Boyer River.

In 1792 and 1793, the explorer Alexander Mackenzie travelled up the river to the Continental Divide. Mackenzie referred to the river as Unjegah, from the Dane-zaa meaning &quot;large river.&quot;

The decades of hostilities between the Dane-zaa and the Cree, (in which the Cree dominated the Dane-zaa), ended in 1781 when a smallpox epidemic decimated the Cree. The Treaty of the Peace was celebrated by the smoking of a ceremonial pipe. The treaty made the Peace River a border, with the Dane-zaa to the North and the Cree to the South.

In 1794, a fur trading post was built on the Peace River at Fort St. John; it was the first settlement established on the British Columbia mainland by Europeans.

=== Post-settlement ===

The rich soils of the Peace River valley in Alberta have been producing wheat crops since the late 19th century. In the early 21st century, the BC Grain Producers Association was researching the productivity of wheat and other grain crops near Dawson Creek. The Peace River region is also an important centre of oil and natural gas production. There are also pulp and paper plants along the river in Alberta and British Columbia.
The Peace River has two navigable sections, separated by the Vermilion Chutes, near Fort Vermilion.
The first steam-powered vessel to navigate the Peace River was the &quot;Grahame&quot;, a Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company vessel built at Fort Chipewyan, on Lake Athabasca. Brothers of the Oblate Order of Mary Immaculate built the &quot;St. Charles&quot; to navigate the upper reaches of the River, from Fort Vermilion to Hudson&#x27;s Hope. Approximately a dozen vessels were to navigate the river. Most of the early vessels were wood-burning steamships, fueled by wood cut from the river&#x27;s shore. The last cargo vessel was the &quot;Watson&#x27;s Lake&quot;, retired in 1952.

=== Hydroelectric development ===
Hydroelectric development began on the Peace River in 1968 and continues to be an important source of renewable energy for British Columbia&#x27;s main electricity provider, BC Hydro. The river’s first dam, the W. A. C. Bennett Dam, was completed in 1968 and is British Columbia&#x27;s largest dam and the third-largest hydroelectric facility in Canada. It supplies over 30% of British Columbia&#x27;s total power demand. Engineers took advantage of the W. A. C. Bennet Dam&#x27;s large reservoir storage to further develop the river with the Peace Canyon Dam opened in 1980. The Site C dam is under construction and scheduled to be finished in 2025; it will further benefit from the upstream dams and generate additional electrical capacity to meet British Columbia&#x27;s growing demand for green energy and reduce the carbon footprint of residents. both the Alberta government and private producers were studying the possibility of hydroelectric development on the Alberta stretch of the river with one run-of-the-river project currently being proposed.
==Geography==

===Course===
This river is long (from the head of Finlay River to Lake Athabasca). It drains an area of approximately . At Peace Point, where it drains in the Slave River, it has an annual discharge of .

A large man-made lake, Williston Lake, has been formed on the upper reaches by the construction of the W. A. C. Bennett Dam for hydroelectric power generation. Prior to its flooding, the confluence of the Finlay and Parsnip Rivers at Finlay Forks was distinct. A half mile east of that location were the half-mile long Finlay Rapids and a further seven miles east is the Peace Pass, which separates the Muskwa Ranges and the Hart Ranges of the Canadian Rockies.

The only river cutting completely through the Rockies, it nowadays flows into Dinosaur Lake, a reservoir for the Peace Canyon Dam. After the dams, the river flows east into Alberta and then continues north and east into the Peace-Athabasca Delta in Wood Buffalo National Park, at the western end of Lake Athabasca. Water from the delta flows into the Slave River east of Peace Point and reaches the Arctic Ocean via the Great Slave Lake and Mackenzie River.

===Communities===
Communities located directly on the river include:
*Hudson&#x27;s Hope, British Columbia
*Taylor, British Columbia
*Peace River, Alberta
*Fort Vermilion, Alberta

Many provincial parks and wildland reserves are established on the river, such as Butler Ridge Provincial Park, Taylor Landing Provincial Park, Beatton River Provincial Park, Peace River Corridor Provincial Park in British Columbia and Dunvegan Provincial Park, Dunvegan West Wildland Provincial Park, Peace River Wildland Provincial Park, Greene Valley Provincial Park, Notikewin Provincial Park, Wood Buffalo National Park in Alberta.

A few Indian reserves are also on the river banks, among them Beaver Ranch 163, John D&#x27;Or Prairie 215, Fox Lake 162, Peace Point 222 and Devil&#x27;s Gate 220.

<text>The Central Bank of the Republic of Türkiye (CBRT) () is the central bank of Turkey. Its responsibilities include conducting monetary and exchange rate policy, managing international reserves of Turkey, as well as printing and issuing banknotes, and establishing, maintaining and regulating payment systems in the country.

The CBRT is tasked by law to achieve and maintain price and financial stability in Turkey, and has a mandate to use, by its own discretion, whichever policy instrument at its disposal to reach these objectives. Therefore, it has instrument but not goal independence. Since 2006, the CBRT follows a full-fledged inflation targeting regime.

== History of central banking in Turkey ==

=== The Ottoman Empire Period ===

In the Ottoman Empire, economic activities such as Treasury operations, money and credit transactions and trade in gold and foreign currencies were executed by various establishments such as the Treasury, the Mint, jewelers, moneylenders, foundations and guilds. In this organizational structure that prevailed until the second half of the 19th century, the Ottoman Empire minted gold coins on behalf of the Sultan.
The Ottoman Empire put cash banknotes (Ottoman Turkish:&quot;Kaime-i nakdiye-i mutebere&quot;) into circulation in 1840. 
During the Crimean War, in 1854, the Ottoman Empire, which borrowed from other nations for the first time in history, needed a state bank to assume an intermediary function in the repayment of external debts. As a result, the Ottoman Bank (Ottoman Turkish:&quot;Bank-ı Osmanî&quot;), headquartered in London, was established with English capital in 1856. The fundamental powers of the Bank were limited to lending in small amounts, making advance payments to the Government and discounting some Treasury bills.

In 1863, the Ottoman Bank was dissolved and restructured as an English-French partnership under the name “&quot;Bank-ı Osmanî-i Şahane&quot;” (Imperial Ottoman Bank) and became a state bank. The Imperial Ottoman Bank was granted the sole privilege of issuing banknotes for a period of thirty years. The Bank, acting as Treasurer of the State, was assigned to collect State revenues, make payments on behalf of the Treasury and discount Treasury bills, as well as making interest and principal payments pertaining to domestic and foreign debts. 
The capital of the Imperial Ottoman Bank retained by other nations triggered reactions in time and these reactions laid the foundation for establishing a national central bank. Efforts towards establishing a central bank with domestic capital culminated in the establishment of the Ottoman National Credit Bank (Ottoman Turkish: &quot;Osmanlı İtibar-ı Millî Bankası&quot;) on 11 March 1917. However, the defeat of the Ottoman Empire in the First World War prevented the bank from becoming a national bank, which would have assumed central bank functions.

=== The Republican Period ===
After the First World War, on account of the global trend of nations to formulate their monetary policies independently by establishing their respective central banks, which would be authorized to issue money, and to reinforce the political independence gained in the War of Independence with economic independence, deliberations about the establishment of a central bank in Turkey gained pace. This issue was first addressed in the 1923 Izmir Economic Congress with a special emphasis on founding a “national state bank”. In 1927, the Minister of Finance Abdülhalik Renda submitted a draft bill on the establishment of a central bank. Following the enactment of the law, Turkey exchanged views with the central banks of other countries’ in establishing the Turkish Central Bank. 
In 1928, having been invited to Turkey, Gerard Vissering, a member of the Central Bank of Netherlands, board of governors, highlighted in his report the necessity of an independent central bank not affiliated to the Government; espoused, in 1929, by Italian expert Count Volpi who suggested that the establishment of a central bank was necessary to ensure stability of the Turkish currency. Following these developments, the Government took the initiative to draft the necessary legal framework for the establishment of a central bank, and a draft was prepared for the Central Bank with the contributions of Prof. Leon Morf from the University of Lausanne.
The law was enacted by the Grand National Assembly of Turkey on 11 June 1930, and published in the Official Gazette of 30 June 1930 under the name “The Law on the Central Bank of the Republic of Turkey No. 1715”. Following the centralization of duties carried out by various institutions and organizations, the Central Bank started to function on 3 October 1931.

Initially, the central bank was not independent. Instead, it followed the government&#x27;s lead.

The shares of the Bank, which acquired legal status as a joint stock company; - to manifest that ‘it is not a public entity’, and that ‘it is independent’, were divided into (A), (B), (C) and (D) classes. Class (A) shares belong solely to the Treasury, and, for the purpose of strengthening the Bank&#x27;s independence, it is stipulated in the Law No. 1715 that these shares shall not constitute more than fifteen percent of the capital. Class (B) shares are allocated to national banks; Class (C) shares are allocated to banks other than the national banks and to privileged companies; and Class (D) shares are allocated to Turkish commercial institutions and to legal and real persons of Turkish nationality.

According to the Law No. 1715, the primary objective of the Central Bank was to support the economic development of the country. To this end, the Bank was authorized to set rediscount ratios (the main policy tool), regulate money markets and the circulation of money, execute Treasury operations, and take measures related to the stability of the Turkish currency. The Bank was vested with the exclusive privilege of issuing banknotes in Turkey. Additionally, the Bank also assumed the role of the treasurer of the Government. Under the fixed exchange rate regime implemented during that period, the Government was the authority to set the exchange rates. 
Independence of the Central Bank and low levels of inflation prevailed during the 1930s, as the Government could not intervene in the Bank&#x27;s field of authority and decisions.

=== Post-Second World War Period ===

During the 1940s, which were dominated by the adverse effects of the Second World War, the Central Bank, like its peers all over the world, implemented policies to offset the public finance deficit rather than implementing an independent monetary policy. Therefore, the general price level increased more than threefold in the 1938-1948 period.
During the 1950s, growth and rapid development were financed by Central Bank sources, and these sources were rendered available to public authority through short-term advances provided to the Treasury. An important development for the Central Bank in that period was the establishment of the Banknote Printing Plant in 1955 and from 1957 onwards banknote-printing started in Turkey. With the transition to planned economy in the 1960s, the Central Bank continued to provide resources to the public sector by pursuing expansionary monetary policies made possible by the economic circumstances and industrial development. It was during this time that the majority of practices related to foreign exchange control were transferred to the Central Bank.

=== The Law on the Central Bank of the Republic of Turkey No. 1211 ===

In order to adjust to the global changes that occurred in the aftermath of the Second World War and to enhance the efficiency of the Central Bank, the Law on the Central Bank of the Republic of Turkey No. 1211 was accepted on 14 January 1970. Thus, the Central Bank, turning a new page in its history, was vested with a new structure in line with, albeit partially, novelties in the field of the economy and central banking of the time. This Law brought significant changes to the legal status, organizational structure, duties and powers of the Bank. As per the Central Bank&#x27;s legal status as a joint stock company, its capital was increased from TL 15 million to TL 25 million. Furthermore, it was stipulated that the Treasury&#x27;s share should not constitute less than 51 percent of the capital. 
With Law No. 1211, the “Office of the Governor” was founded to ensure equivalence in terms of international representation, foreign relations and protocol, and Mr. Naim Talu became the first “governor” to assume this title. Moreover, a new decision-making body composed of the governor and the vice governors was established under the name of the executive committee. The top-level decision-making body of the Bank, the Board of Directors, which consisted of eight members, was transformed into the “Board” of the Bank, consisting of six members. Besides, the General Assembly of Shareholders was named the General Assembly; Board of Auditors was named the Auditing Committee; and the General Directorate was named Head Office. 
This Law also introduced significant changes in terms of enhancing the Bank&#x27;s duties and powers. First of all, the Central Bank&#x27;s control over direct and indirect monetary policy instruments was extended and the Bank was authorized to conduct open market operations to regulate money supply and liquidity. Meanwhile, it was decided that the Government would consult the Central Bank while taking measures with respect to money and loans. The Bank was authorized, through rediscount transactions, to lend medium-term loans to support investments and economic development. The upper limit for short-term advances to the Treasury was increased to 15 percent of budget allocations pertaining to the respective year.

=== Post-1980 Period ===

The 1980s saw important developments that might be described as a turning point for both the Turkish economy and the Central Bank. The decisions of 24 January 1980 sparked a structural transformation in the Turkish economy. Price controls were abandoned so that prices would be formed within the framework of market mechanisms, and a policy of free trade was adopted. With the launch of the financial liberalization process, important steps were taken to ensure the necessary infrastructure for implementation of monetary and exchange rate policies in compliance with the market economy. In the same period, it was decided that interest rates on deposits and loans would be determined by market conditions. Furthermore, the fixed exchange rate system was abandoned and the Turkish currency devalued against foreign currencies. 
In 1983, the Bank was empowered to manage gold and foreign exchange reserves effectively. In addition, it was incorporated into the Law that the Bank would carry out its fundamental duties in compliance with the basic requirements of the economy and with the objective of achieving price stability. The Central Bank started to conduct open market operations in 1987 and became a pioneer in the establishment of money and foreign exchange markets in the modern sense.
In 1989, with “Decree No. 32 on the Protection of the Value of Turkish Currency”, economic units were allowed to conduct foreign exchange transactions, and having declared the Turkish currency “convertible”, a relatively more flexible exchange rate regime was adopted. 
In 1990, the Bank announced a monetary program for the first time, which aimed to meet the liquidity requirement of the market without endangering the stability of exchange rates and interest rates. The targets announced in 1990 were achieved; yet, problems such as the pressure of the Gulf War on the financial sector, political instability, lax financial policy and the fragile structure of the banking sector hindered achievement of macroeconomic stability and led to a financial crisis in the first quarter of 1994. 
The initial regulations proposed to prevent financing of public debts – a key element of the period of high inflation – by Central Bank resources coincide with this period. On 21 April 1994, limitations were imposed on the Treasury&#x27;s use of Central Bank funds; and with the protocol signed between the Central Bank and the Treasury in 1997, it was concluded that the Treasury would not use short-term advances from the Central Bank from 1998 onwards.

=== The 2001 Crisis and Post-Crisis Period ===

In the 1995-1999 period, the Central Bank followed policies geared towards ensuring stability in the financial markets. A period of uncontrollable inflation paved the way for the adoption, in the year 2000, of an exchange rate based new stability program. However, amid the aggravating loss of confidence in the economy that started by the end of 2000 and the crisis that broke out in mid-2001, the said program ceased to be implemented and free floating exchange rate regime was adopted on 22 February 2001. 
Following the crisis, the Turkish economy underwent a structural transformation. During this process, significant amendments were made to the CBRT Law on 25 April 2001; above all, it was explicitly described in the Law that the primary objective of the Central Bank was to achieve and maintain price stability. Within this scope, it was stipulated that the Bank would determine at its own discretion the monetary policy that it would implement and the monetary policy instruments that it was going to use; thus, the Bank was vested with “instrument independence”. Moreover, the Law also stipulated that the Bank would support the growth and employment policies of the Government without conflicting with the objective of achieving and maintaining price stability. Besides, achieving financial stability was described as the supportive objective of the Bank. Furthermore, the Law prohibited the Bank from granting advances and extending credit to the Treasury and to public establishments and institutions, and from being a purchaser, in the primary market, of the debt instruments issued by the Treasury and public establishments and institutions. Thus, the utilization of Central Bank funds for the purpose of public finance was prevented. Within the scope of the amendment to the Law, the Monetary Policy Committee was established so as to institutionalize monetary policy strategies and decision-making mechanisms.

=== Inflation Targeting Regime ===

In 2002, the Central Bank adopted a modern monetary policy strategy, namely the “inflation targeting regime”. During the implementation of the implicit inflation targeting regime of the 2002–2005 period, the Bank tried to lay the basis for the regime by ensuring the necessary pre-conditions, strengthened its technical and institutional infrastructure, developed estimation models and expanded its data set. During this process, the Research Department was restructured as the Research and Monetary Policy Department and the Communications Department was set up to ensure effectiveness of communications policies. 
From 2005 onwards, the Monetary Policy Committee started to announce, in advance, its meeting dates as a yearly calendar, to increase predictability of policy decisions. The outcome of this entire process was the explicit inflation targeting regime that started to be implemented in 2006. 
Upon achieving some progress in the disinflation process, a two-stage monetary reform was launched in order to emphasize the Bank&#x27;s determination in its efforts, to enhance the credibility of the Turkish currency, and to eliminate various problems arising from high denomination. In the first stage, six zeros were removed from the Turkish lira, and banknotes of the New Turkish lira (YTL) and coins of the New kuruş (YKr) were put into circulation from 1 January 2005 onwards.
On 1 January 2009, the second stage of the reform was launched by removing the prefix “New” used on the “New Turkish lira” and “New kuruş”, and Turkish lira banknotes and coins were put into circulation with new designs and sizes. 
As of today, the Central Bank of the Republic of Turkey, as a credible institution, pursues its policy implementations with its qualified staff members and modern infrastructure within an ever-dynamic framework by keeping a close watch on global and domestic developments.

== Ownership ==

The CBRT is a joint stock company. Its capital of 25.000 Turkish liras are divided into 250.000 shares. Per the Central Bank Law of Turkey, these shares are divided into four classes:

* Class A shares are allocated solely to the Turkish Ministry of Finance and Treasury.
* Class B shares are allocated to national banks operating in Turkey.
* Class C shares are allocated to banks other than national banks and privileged companies. 
* Class D shares are allocated to Turkish commercial institutions and to real and legal persons of Turkish nationality.

As of the end of 2018, class A shares constituted 55.12% of CBRT&#x27;s capital, whereas class B, C and D shares constituted 25.74%, 0.02% and 19.12%, respectively.

== The CBRT Law ==
CBRT&#x27;s current powers and duties are defined by a specific law (CBRT law) accepted on 14 January 1970.

The Law on the Central Bank of the Republic of Turkey, No. 1715 was enacted on 11 June 1930. According to the Law No. 1715, the basic aim of the Bank was to support economic development of the country. In order to fulfill this aim, the Bank was given the following duties:

*To set rediscount ratios and to regulate money markets,
*To execute Treasury operations,
*To take, jointly with the Government, all measures to protect the value of Turkish currency.

With the introduction of economic development plans in Turkey in the 1960s, several changes were made in the Central Bank Law. For the same purpose, the Law No. 1211, which was enacted on 26 January 1970, redefined the duties and responsibilities of the Central Bank of the Republic of Turkey, so as to implement the money and credit policy within the framework of development plans.

In the second half of the 1980s, the Bank inaugurated interbank money market, foreign exchange money market and started to make use of open market operations.

== Duties and powers ==

&quot;The primary objective of the Bank shall be to achieve and maintain price stability. The Bank shall determine on its own discretion the monetary policy that it shall implement and the monetary policy instruments that it is going to use in order to achieve and maintain price stability.”

<text>USS &quot;Advance, the second [[United States Navy]] ship to be so named, was later known asUSS &quot;Frolic, and was originally the blockade runner &quot;Advance&quot; captured by the Union Navy during the latter part of the American Civil War. She was purchased by the Union Navy and outfitted as a gunboat and assigned to the blockade of the waterways of the Confederate States of America. She also served as dispatch ship and supply vessel when military action eventually slowed.

==Construction and Irish service==

Lord Clyde, named for Scottish military officer Colin Campbell, 1st Baron Clyde, was built for the packet service between Ireland and Scotland operated by the Dublin &amp; Glasgow Sailing and Steam Packet Company. She was launched at Greenock, Scotland, by Caird &amp; Co. as Yard No.97 on 3 July 1862. &quot;Lord Clyde&quot; was an iron-hulled vessel with a length of , a beam of , a depth of and a draft of . She measured and and was powered by a 2-cylinder oscillating side-lever steam engine of 350 nhp, also made by Caird, driving two side paddle wheels. On completion she conducted sea trials on 18 September 1862 and sailed from Greenock five days later for Kingstown, Dublin to commence her regular service with Glasgow.

==Service with the Confederacy==
During the American Civil War, a growing shortage of supplies for the manufacture of uniforms for North Carolina troops in 1862 prompted incoming governor Zebulon B. Vance to propose that the state purchase its own blockade runner. With the assistance of British businessman Alexander Collie, &quot;Lord Clyde&quot; was purchased by the state of North Carolina and on 28 June 1863 she successfully ran the Union blockade into Wilmington. At Wilmington the ship was changed to local registry and renamed &quot;Advance&quot; (some sources state &quot;A. D. Vance&quot; in honor of the Governor).

Three months later, a half share in &quot;Advance&quot; was sold to the firm of Power, Low &amp; Co. in order to raise funds towards purchasing additional ships. She successfully passed through the blockade between the Cape Fear River and Nassau or Bermuda some seventeen times between June 1863 and September 1864, under the command of Lt. John J. Guthrie, CSN.

==Capture by the Union Navy==

&quot;Advance&quot; was commanded by Capt. Tom Crossan when captured by on 10 September 1864 when she attempted to put to sea from Wilmington, North Carolina. Gov. Vance attributed her capture to use of low grade North Carolina bituminous coal and denounced Confederate Secretary of the Navy Stephen Mallory for giving the stockpile of smokeless anthracite to (a raiding cruiser) so that none was left for &quot;Advance&quot; to run out of Wilmington safely. Writing on 3 January 1865, Vance complained:

Why a State struggling for the common good, to clothe and provide for its troops in the public service, should meet with no more favor than a blockade gambler passes my comprehension.

&quot;Advance&quot; was condemned by the New York prize court, and she was purchased by the Navy that same month; then commissioned at the New York Navy Yard on 28 October 1864, Lt. Comdr. John H. Upshur in command.

==Civil War service==
===Bombardment of Fort Fisher ===

&quot;Advance&quot; departed New York City on 30 October; arrived off Wilmington, North Carolina, on 14 November; and joined the North Atlantic Blockading Squadron. In addition to her reversed role—catching blockade runners as opposed to being one—she participated in the two expeditions against Fort Fisher, located on Confederate (Federal) Point at the mouth of the Cape Fear River.

The first – abortive—attempt was carried out between 24 and 26 December 1864 after a bizarre attempt to flatten some of the defenses by running what amounted to a fire-ship stocked with some 30 tons of gunpowder aground at a point some 250 to 300 yards north of the fort. Needless to say, that unique shore bombardment proved to be a huge flash in the pan causing little or no damage. When the fleet moved in on 24 December, &quot;Advance&quot; was in the 1st Reserve Division which appears to have constituted a second line of bombarding ships behind the ironclads. She fired only her large 20-pounder rifle and stopped that when she had to go to the assistance of the stricken and tow her to a safe anchorage.

The following day, Christmas 1864, she and five or six other warships moved off to draw fire from Half Moon Battery as preparation for the Army&#x27;s landings. Though an 8-inch gun in the Confederate battery drove off other vessels in the division as well as some Union Army transports, &quot;Advance&quot; claimed credit for silencing that gun with her heavy rifle. The Army landed late Christmas Day. Firing continued through the day and intermittently that night—fire that degenerated into covering fire to protect the bogged-down Federals instead of a bombardment preparatory to the by-then cancelled assault. &quot;Advance&quot; retired from Cape Fear on the 26th and the remnants of General Butler&#x27;s Army force embarked on the 27th.

After a visit to Norfolk, Virginia, for supplies between 31 December 1864 and 11 January 1865, &quot;Advance&quot; returned to her blockade station off the Cape Fear River mouth on 13 January – Friday the 13th, to be exact, an ominous day for the Southerners defending Fort Fisher. Before dawn that day, the Federal fleet unleashed a terrific bombardment on the fort. Not long thereafter, around 0800, about 8,000 Union troops began landing on the peninsula north of the fortifications.

The following day, the fleet resumed its bombardment while the Union Army began landing its own supporting artillery. &quot;Advance&quot;, in one of the reserve divisions, helped support the landing of the Army guns and supplies while the bulk of the fleet continued to batter the Fort Fisher defenses. The main attack commenced on 15 January 1865. The Army, aided by sailors and marines from the fleet, stormed the Southern positions. Heavily outnumbered and outgunned, the Confederates fought with the tenacity and ferocity of desperation—more often than not at close quarters with bayonets and rifle butts. They fought the entire day and into the evening but to no avail. The last fortifications, Battery Buchanan and the Mound, gave up at about 2200 hours (10 p.m.) that evening. The Navy had closed the eastern portion of the Confederacy&#x27;s last avenue of contact with the outside world.

===North Atlantic blockade operations===

&quot;Advance&quot; resumed duty on the blockade. With the last deep-draft Confederate port closed, few runners tried to make the run. Those that did were of very shallow draft and of even more limited cargo capacity than that characteristic of their deep-draft predecessors. That fact made blockade running a highly unprofitable venture considering the danger involved. As a consequence, &quot;Advance&quot; participated in no captures.

Instead, she served as a dispatch and supply ship for the remainder of her tour of duty with the North Atlantic Blockading Squadron.

===End-of-war activity===

On 11 February, she put into Norfolk for a month of repairs before embarking passengers and sailing for New York City on 13 March. She reached that port the following day and entered the New York Navy Yard. On 16 March 1865, &quot;Advance&quot; was detached from the North Atlantic Blockading Squadron and was placed out of commission at New York City. She remained inactive for about three months during which time hostilities were coming to an end. On 22 April, almost a fortnight after General Robert E. Lee surrendered the Army of Northern Virginia, &quot;Advance&quot; was renamed USS &quot;Frolic&quot;, the second U.S. Navy ship of that name. On 12 June 1865, she was recommissioned under her new name, Lt. Comdr. John H. Upshur again in command.

==Post-war operations as USS &quot;Frolic&quot;==
thumb|USS &quot;Frolic&quot; (formerly USS &quot;Advance&quot;) at Naples, Italy, ca. 1865–69 
On 24 June 1865, &quot;Frolic&quot; departed the east coast to join the newly formed European Squadron and arrived at Flushing in the Netherlands on 17 July. Over the next four years, she made ceremonial visits to ports in Europe including many on the Mediterranean littoral. Those events reached a particularly high frequency during 1867 and 1868 when David Glasgow Farragut commanded the squadron. On 22 March 1869, the ship departed Lisbon, Portugal, to return to the United States. She arrived in New York City on 30 April and was placed out of commission there on 8 May 1869.

==1869 recommissioning==

Recommissioned on 24 September 1869, &quot;Frolic&quot; patrolled the fishing grounds off Nova Scotia between April and October 1870. She arrived at Washington, D.C., on 26 October 1870 and was decommissioned there on 11 November for repairs. On 18 January 1872, she was recommissioned at Washington, Lt. Comdr. G. C. Remey in command. On 19 February, &quot;Frolic&quot; departed Washington, D.C., to relieve on patrol off the New England coast. She concluded that assignment in May and returned to Washington on the 24th.

Between 12 and 16 June 1872, she made the passage between Washington, D.C. and New York City. At the latter port, she became station ship and, on the 29th, broke the flag of Vice Admiral Stephen C. Rowan. She served alternately as station ship at New York and on patrols at sea until 30 April 1874 at which time she was decommissioned at Philadelphia for repairs. Recommissioned on 18 August 1875, &quot;Frolic&quot; departed Philadelphia for duty on the South Atlantic Station a week later. She cruised the coasts of Argentina, Uruguay and Brazil for a little over two years. While at Montevideo on 20 April 1877, Second Class Fireman James M. Trout attempted to rescue a shipmate from drowning, for which he was awarded the Medal of Honor.

==Final decommissioning==
She returned to Washington, D.C., on 20 October 1877 and was decommissioned there for the last time on 31 October 1877. &quot;Frolic&quot; remained at Washington, in ordinary, until sold to Mr. J. P. Agnew, of Alexandria, Virginia, on 1 October 1883.

<text>A massage parlor (American English), or massage parlour (Canadian/British English), is a place where massage services are provided. Some massage parlors are front organizations for prostitution and the term &quot;massage parlor&quot; has also become a euphemism for a brothel.

==Background==
The term &quot;massage parlour&quot; (British English) or &quot;massage parlor&quot; (American English) sometimes refers to a front for prostitution, an association popularized by the &quot;Massage Scandals&quot; of 1894. In 1894 the British Medical Association (BMA) inquired into the education and practice of massage practitioners in London, and found that prostitution was commonly associated with unskilled workers and debt, often working with forged qualifications. In response, legitimate massage workers formed the Society of Trained Masseuses (now known as the Chartered Society of Physiotherapy), with an emphasis on high academic standards and a medical model for massage training.

Particularly where prostitution is illegal, massage parlors (as well as saunas, spas or similar establishments) may be fronts for places of prostitution. Illegal brothels disguised as massage parlors are common in many countries.

Alternatively, the massages at certain massage parlors may have a &quot;happy ending&quot;, meaning that the massage ends with the client receiving a sexual release. In addition to a &quot;happy ending&quot; service, given the restrictions imposed upon most striptease venues, some erotic massage venues now also offer a service where the client can masturbate while watching an artist perform a striptease.

There is a grey area and ambiguity as to when an ordinary massage becomes sexual when it comes to individuals with sexual interests such as tripsophilia, tripsolagnophilia, partialism, autofetishism or organofact, who may feel that the massage of the entire body or any ordinary bodyparts unrelated to typical erogenous zones are associated with eroticism and sensuality.

== China ==

Most types of massage, with the exception of some traditional Chinese medicine, are not regulated in China. Although illegal in China, some of the smaller massage parlors are sometimes linked to the sex industry and the government has taken a number of measures in recent times to curb this. In a nationwide crackdown known as the yellow sweep (&quot;Yellow&quot; in Mandarin Chinese refers to sexual activities or pornographic content), limitations on the design and operation of massage parlors have been placed, going so far as requiring identification from customers who visit massage establishments late at night and logging their visits with the local police.

==Germany==
Prostitution in Germany is legal. In 2004 the German city of Cologne introduced a tax on the city&#x27;s sex industry including its massage parlors. It was the only city to do so.

==Italy==
In Italy, massage parlours can be fronts for prostitution. Advertisements for massage parlours are listed in newspapers, in some cases offering &quot;Japanese&quot; or &quot;Oriental&quot; massage. Viva Lain, one of Italy&#x27;s largest chains of massage parlours, was raided by the police in 2003.

==Malaysia==
Since the end of the 20th century an expansion in prostitution in Malaysia has resulted in massage parlors being established across the country. Malaysian massage parlors often call themselves spas, salons, or health centres, and many offer erotic massages and &quot;happy endings&quot;.

==Nepal==
In Kathmandu&#x27;s tourist district of Thamel, massage parlours typically advertise Thai massage, Ayurvedic massage or Nepalese &quot;special massage&quot;. Some offer legitimate massage, while others are sex establishments. Prostitution in Nepal is illegal so the owners of such massage parlours do not explicitly solicit sex and the paying of police bribes is a customary part of the operation.

==Thailand==
There are many businesses in Thailand that provide traditional Thai massage which is therapeutic and non-sexual. However, the country also has a large number of massage parlors which are part of the country&#x27;s sex industry. These premises typically contain a large glass window behind which clothed women sit wearing identification numbers. Once one of them is chosen by a customer, she takes him into a private room for a bath and sexual services (oral sex or penetrative sex). Instead of a salary, the women receive a proportion of the fee paid by the customer, and they are also given tips.

In 1996, foreign women made up the majority of prostitutes from forty sex establishments in eighteen border provinces that were actually brothels masquerading as karaoke bars, restaurants and traditional massage parlours. In some venues though, there were no Thai women at all. In mid-1997, an increasing number of young girls, more than 60% of which were under 18 years old, were entering Thailand through the Mae Sai checkpoint into massage parlors, brothels, etc.

The legal difference between a &quot;spa&quot; and a &quot;massage parlour&quot; is unclear. The Federation of Thai Spa Associations (FTSPA) in 2016 urged authorities to clamp down on sexual services being offered at some massage parlours. The FTSPA maintains that influential figures have used legal loopholes to open &quot;pretty spas&quot; or massage parlours where tourists can buy sexual services.

==United Kingdom==

In the United Kingdom, prostitution itself is legal but activities such as pimping and owning or managing a brothel are not. However, the laws are not always strictly enforced. Many brothels in cities such as Manchester and London and Cardiff operate through legitimate businesses which are licensed as &quot;Massage Parlours&quot; and operate under that name. Police forces often turn a blind eye to such establishments. Massage parlours are sometimes advertised in newspapers, but a newspaper which carries advertising for a brothel under the guise of a massage parlour may be liable to prosecution for money laundering offences under the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002. The Newspaper Society&#x27;s guidelines suggest that their members (the majority of local newspapers) refuse to carry advertisements for sexual services. The advice also warns publishers that massage parlours can disguise illegal offers of sexual services and it suggests checking qualifications to ensure the advertised service is legitimate. Newspaper companies often adopt a policy of refusing all advertisements for massage parlours.

In 2005, it was reported that, in Manchester, there were around eighty &quot;massage parlours&quot; which were fronts for prostitution and that the police ignored those establishments, focusing instead on reducing street prostitution. On 12 October 2005, the &quot;Manchester Evening News&quot; reported that &quot;A self-confessed pimp walked free from court after a judge was told police had &#x27;turned a blind eye&#x27; to organised prostitution in massage parlours in Manchester.&quot;

In December 2007, the &quot;Manchester Evening News&quot; removed all advertisements for massage parlours from its personal columns. The move followed a meeting between ministers and newspaper and advertising industry representatives. It also followed comments by Harriet Harman, Minister for Women and Equality, in the House of Commons on 25 October that some local newspapers were promoting slavery by running sex adverts for foreign women.

==United States==
Massage parlors in the United States have been linked to prostitution since the nineteenth century. In 2019 it was reported that the Polaris Project estimated there were around 9,000 massage parlors in the US providing sexual services. Most of the staff were Chinese women. The larger cities of the US typically have hundreds of massage parlors, and they are often present in small towns. 

Between 1980 and 2009, massage parlors in Rhode Island (also known there as &quot;spas&quot;) were known to be involved in prostitution. Prostitution in Rhode Island was legal at that time as long as it was &quot;behind closed doors&quot;. The 2009 documentary &quot;Happy Endings?&quot; follows women who worked in the Asian massage parlors of Rhode Island. The film focuses on &quot;full service&quot; massage parlors, although &quot;rub and tug&quot; massage parlors (where only handjobs are offered) are also covered.

As of 2010, there were an estimated 525 massage parlors in New Jersey acting as fronts for the prostitution industry.

An ongoing study of the prostitution business in New York City by the Sociology Department of Columbia University found that, between 1991 and 2010, the rise of the Internet and mobile phones “have enabled some sex workers to professionalize their trade”, with a shift from street walking to &quot;indoor&quot; markets (including massage parlors and escort agencies), a geographical change in the concentration of sex work, and the growth of a more expensive luxury market. In January 2011, an investigation by &quot;Time Out New York&quot; found New York City massage parlors charging a &quot;house fee&quot; (which is usually paid, up front to the parlor&#x27;s mama-san) of $60 to $100 per visit, with an extra tip for the sex workers (usually around $40) for a massage and a basic “happy ending” (or manual stimulation of the penis until orgasm). Most of the massage parlors reviewed were very strict about the female masseuse not being touched by the male client, but, in some parlors, further contact could be negotiated.

In many large US cities there are Asian massage parlours, some advertising traditional Thai massage. In some cases these establishments are fronts for prostitution. As of 2005, more than forty Asian massage parlors (mostly Korean) operated as fronts for in-call brothels in Washington, D.C., and each earned an average of $1.2 million a year. More than 200 other massage parlors (that did not openly advertise and were operated largely out of private homes and apartments) serving mainly Latino clients made an average of at least $800,000 a year.

Sex acts performed at massage parlors can range from a basic &quot;happy ending&quot; to oral sex or &quot;full service&quot;. Some, mostly Asian, massage parlors offer a naked &quot;table shower&quot; or an &quot;Asian body slide&quot; as well as access to a sauna before a massage and/or any sexual activity takes place.

During the 2000s publications in major metropolitan areas of the US were under pressure not to advertise massage parlor operations. After the Fight Online Sex Trafficking Act became law on 11 April 2018 the classified advertising website Craigslist removed all of their personal advertisements. Another classified advertising website, Backpage, was shut down by federal officials during the same month. The closure of Backpage substantially benefited the massage parlor review website RubMaps which covers Asian massage parlors in the US. The site was under investigation by US authorities in 2019, a process made more difficult by the site&#x27;s corporate structures and domain name having moved to Europe.

Law enforcement agencies in the US attempt to shut down or fine massage parlor establishments that break federal, state or local laws. The penalty for breaking the law in these instances can be as high as life imprisonment in some cases, especially those that involve human trafficking.

<text>David Wilmot (January 20, 1814 – March 16, 1868) was an American politician and judge. He served as Representative and a Senator for Pennsylvania and as a judge of the Court of Claims. He is best known for being the prime sponsor and eponym of the Wilmot Proviso, a failed proposal to ban the expansion of slavery to western lands gained in the Mexican Cession. A northern Democrat when he introduced and supported the Proviso, he subsequently became a notable member of the anti-slavery Free Soil Party. Later, Wilmot was instrumental in establishing the Republican Party in Pennsylvania.

==Education and career==
David Wilmot was born on January 20, 1814, in Bethany, Pennsylvania. He completed preparatory studies at the local Beech Woods Academy and the Cayuga Lake Academy in Aurora, Cayuga County, New York. He then read law with Pennsylvania state judge William Jessup in Montrose, Pennsylvania, and with George Washington Woodward in Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania, in August 1834. Wilmot was admitted to the bar of Bradford County, Pennsylvania, and entered private practice in Towanda, from 1834 to 1844.

==Congressional service==
Wilmot was elected as a Democrat from Pennsylvania&#x27;s 12th congressional district to the United States House of Representatives of the 29th, 30th and 31st United States Congresses, serving from March 4, 1845, to March 3, 1851.

===Introducing the Wilmot Proviso===
Upon taking his seat in Congress, Wilmot initially supported the policies of Democratic president James K. Polk. He also became part of an informal group of anti-slavery Democrats led by New York congressman Preston King, who was a protégé of New York governor Silas Wright and an ally of former president Martin Van Buren. Although Wilmot opposed the extension of slavery into the territories, he was generally considered to be a Democratic Party loyalist; he supported Polk in the initiation of the Mexican–American War and was the lone House Democrat from Pennsylvania to vote for the Walker tariff. However, during Polk&#x27;s presidency, anti-slavery Northern Democrats increasingly came to view Polk as unduly favorable to Southern interests. They were specifically disappointed by Polk&#x27;s decision to compromise with Britain over the partition of Oregon, as well as Polk&#x27;s veto of an internal improvements bill. As James G. Blaine later wrote:

In August 1846, an appropriations bill for $2 million to be used by the President in negotiating a treaty of peace with Mexico was introduced in the House. Wilmot immediately offered the following amendment:

:&quot;Provided, That, as an express and fundamental condition to the acquisition of any territory from the Republic of Mexico by the United States, by virtue of any treaty which may be negotiated between them, and to the use by the Executive of the moneys herein appropriated, neither slavery nor involuntary servitude shall ever exist in any part of said territory, except for crime, whereof the party shall first be duly convicted.&quot;

Wilmot modeled the language for what would usually be referred to as the Wilmot Proviso after the Northwest Ordinance of 1787. Unlike some Northern Whigs, Wilmot and other anti-slavery Democrats were largely unconcerned by the issue of racial equality, and instead opposed the expansion of slavery because they believed the institution was detrimental to the &quot;laboring white man&quot;. Historian Sean Wilentz writes that it is unclear why Wilmot, an &quot;unremarkable&quot; first-term Congressman, was the one to introduce the measure. Wilmot would later claim that he had introduced the proviso independent of any other members of Congress, while Congressman Jacob Brinkerhoff claimed that he was the true author of the proviso. Wilentz speculates that the proviso was jointly drafted by Wilmot and other anti-slavery Democrats, and that the drafters agreed that whoever had the first opportunity to introduce the proviso would do so.

In a February 1847 debate over the Proviso, Wilmot explained that he was not an abolitionist, and was not seeking to abolish slavery in the Southern states, but simply wanted to preserve the integrity of free territories that did not have slavery and did not want it:
 
In an 1848 speech, Wilmot responded to critics who called him a radical abolitionist by pointing to Thomas Jefferson&#x27;s proposed Land Ordinance of 1784, which would have banned slavery in a large portion of western territory slated for federal expansion.

The House, after first voting down a counter-proposal simply to extend the Missouri Compromise line across the Mexican Cession, passed the proviso by a vote of 83–64. This led to an attempt to table the entire appropriations bill rather than pass it with &quot;the obnoxious proviso attached&quot;, but this effort was defeated &quot;in an ominously sectional vote, 78–94&quot;. The United States Senate adjourned rather than approve the bill with the proviso.

===Free Soil movement===
A measure to the Wilmot Proviso was brought forward at the next session of Congress, with the appropriation amount increased to $3 million, and the scope of the amendment expanded to include all future territory which might be acquired by the United States. This was passed in the House by a vote of 115 to 105, but the Senate refused to concur and passed a bill of its own without the amendment. The House acquiesced, owing largely to the influence of general Lewis Cass. As the 1848 presidential election took shape, the Democrats rejected the Wilmot Proviso in their platform and selected Cass as their candidate to run on a popular sovereignty platform. The new Free Soil Party rallied around the Wilmot Proviso, and nominated Van Buren on a platform calling for &quot;No more slave states and no more slave territory.&quot;

By 1848 Wilmot was thoroughly identified as a Free Soiler, but, like many other Free Soilers, he did not oppose the expansion of slavery based on a legal rejection of the short-term existence of the institution itself, but rather because he felt slavery was detrimental to the interests of whites. In fact, he sometimes referred to the Wilmot proviso as the &quot;White Man&#x27;s Proviso&quot;. In a speech in the House, Wilmot said, &quot;I plead the cause and the rights of white freemen [and] I would preserve to free white labor a fair country, a rich inheritance, where the sons of toil, of my own race and own color, can live without the disgrace which association with negro slavery brings upon free labor.&quot; Around the same time, however, Wilmot, in a New York speech, spoke of the ultimate demise of slavery when he argued, &quot;Keep it within given limits ...and in time it will wear itself out. Its existence can only be perpetuated by constant expansion. ... Slavery has within itself the seeds of its own destruction.&quot;

Wilmot was presented as the Free Soil candidate for speaker of the United States House of Representatives in 1849 and was soon at odds with the mainstream Pennsylvania Democratic Party led by James Buchanan. Wilmot was forced to withdraw from the 1850 congressional elections in favor of the more moderate Galusha A. Grow.

==State judicial service==
Wilmot was President Judge of the Pennsylvania Court of Common Pleas for the Thirteenth Judicial District from 1851 to 1861. He took a leading part in the founding of the Republican Party in 1854. He was Chairman of the Republican Party platform committee, was a delegate to the 1856 Republican National Convention and worked vigorously for the first Republican presidential candidate, John C. Fremont, in the 1856 election. He was an unsuccessful Republican candidate for Governor of Pennsylvania in 1857, losing to William F. Packer.

==Later congressional service==
Wilmot was elected as a Republican to the Senate to fill the vacancy caused by the resignation of Simon Cameron. Wilmot served from March 14, 1861, to March 3, 1863. He was not a candidate for reelection in 1862. He was a member of the Peace Convention of 1861, held in Washington, D.C., in an effort to devise means to prevent the impending American Civil War.

==Federal judicial service==
Wilmot was nominated by president Abraham Lincoln on March 6, 1863, to the Court of Claims, to a new seat authorized by 12 Stat. 765. He was confirmed by the Senate on March 7, 1863, and received his commission the same day.

Wilmot died on March 16, 1868. He was interred in Riverside Cemetery in Towanda.

==Family==
Wilmot was the son of Randall (1792–1876) and Mary (née Grant) Wilmot (1792–1820). His father was a well-to-do merchant, and David&#x27;s early life was a comfortable one. In 1836, he married Anna Morgan. The couple had three children, none of whom survived childhood.

<text>The Porsche 804 is a single-seat, open-wheeled racing car produced by Porsche to compete in Formula One (F1). It raced for a single season in 1962 in the 1½ litre formula.

==Background ==
In 1957 the Fédération Internationale de l&#x27;Automobile (FIA) changed their rules to allow cars with enveloping bodywork to compete in Formula races. That year Porsche entered three 550/1500RS Spyders in the German Grand Prix Formula Two (F2) event. Changes to the cars were minimal, being limited to removing the passenger seats and spare tires.

For 1958 Porsche fielded a modified 718, called the RSK Mittellenker (centre-steer), for F2 events. The bodywork for this car was only slightly modified from the sportscar model, but the single seat was now in the centre of the cockpit, with the steering wheel, pedals, and shift lever relocated to accommodate the change and a fairing enclosing more of the cockpit opening. Jean Behra drove the car to a win at the F2 event at Reims that year. At the German Grand Prix at the Nürburgring, driver Edgar Barth placed sixth overall and second in his class. At the Berlin Grand Prix at AVUS the car won both its heat and the F2 class in the hands of driver Masten Gregory.

In October 1958 the FIA announced another change to the regulations for Formula One. Beginning in the 1961 season, engine capacity would be limited to the same 1.5 litres as in Formula Two. This meant that Porsche could use their F2 cars almost unchanged in F1.

In 1959 Porsche unveiled the prototype of a narrow, open-wheeled car called the Porsche 718/2 that married the 718&#x27;s mechanicals with a more traditional single-seat Formula body. The unpainted car was entered in the 1959 Monaco Grand Prix, where driver Wolfgang von Trips qualified twelfth, but crashed on the second lap of the race. At Reims, driver Joakim Bonnier finished third. For 1960 the production 718/2, starting with chassis number 718201, received revised bodywork, a 6-speed transaxle, and a wheelbase extended by . A total of five cars were built. Some of these four-cylinder cars were later raced in F1 under the 1962 1½ litre formula.

For 1961 Porsche launched the Type 787. The car had a new chassis that was longer than that of the 718/2 by an additional to accommodate the Type 753 flat-eight engine in development. While it kept the earlier car&#x27;s rear suspension, at the front was a new upper and lower A-arm suspension with coil springs. The first chassis completed was powered by a 547/3 four-cylinder engine with Kugelfischer fuel injection. At the Monaco Grand Prix the car retired when the fuel injection cut out. A second car, also fitted with the 547/3 engine, was completed in time to appear in the Dutch Grand Prix alongside the other 787. The cars placed 10th and 11th, but their lack of power and poor handling caused Ferry Porsche to retire the model.

Porsche would focus on building a brand new competitive formula race car with an eight-cylinder engine.

==Design ==
===General===
The 804 was designed by Ferdinand Alexander &quot;Butzi&quot; Porsche, also known as F.A. Porsche. He is the son of Ferdinand Anton Ernst &quot;Ferry&quot; Porsche, and grandson of the company&#x27;s eponymous founder Ferdinand Porsche. F.A. Porsche was assigned the project by the company&#x27;s long-time chief body engineer Erwin Komenda.

The design was done for Wilhelm Hild, an engineer with the racing department, and Hubert Mimler, another engineer who worked on a variety of projects at the company and who was assigned to the racing department at the time. The two engineers worked with FA Porsche on the car. Acting as Racing director at Porsche was Fritz &quot;Huschke&quot; von Hanstein.

A total of four cars were built. The fourth chassis was never raced.

The 804 gave Porsche its only F1 wins as a constructor, at the 1962 French Grand Prix, and at the (non-WC) Solituderennen at Castle Solitude in Stuttgart, both with Gurney as driver.

A Porsche 804 is a part of the collection of the Porsche Museum. Following an eight-month long restoration, the car appeared at the Grand Prix Historique at Monaco in 2016. The car later appeared at the 2018 Goodwood Festival of Speed.

===Chassis and body===
Design of the 804&#x27;s chassis was headed by Helmuth Bott, Porsche&#x27;s chassis engineer.

Like the Porsche 787 before it, the 804 had a tubular steel frame and an aluminum body, but the two vehicles differed significantly in appearance. The 804 was narrower and lower, with a smoother surface than its predecessor that was achieved in part by using a horizontal cooling fan (vertical axis) on top of the new flat-eight engine, in contrast to the vertically mounted (horizontal axis) cooling fan used on the four-cylinder Fuhrmann engine.

The 804 was the first Porsche to have some factory body panels made of synthetic materials. The nose and the cockpit surround were made of fibreglass later in the season.

The aluminum fuel tanks had a capacity of , and were located in the car&#x27;s nose and on both sides next to the driver&#x27;s seat. The cockpit was narrow and contained the driver&#x27;s seat, the steering wheel, the shift lever, and the pedals. A tachometer in the middle of the instrument panel and oil pressure and oil temperature gauge gave the driver the most necessary information.

The 804 weighed approximately ; only slightly above the regulated minimum weight of .

===Suspension===
The suspension front and rear comprised unequal-length upper and lower A-arms. At the front, the suspension initially had only one radius rod on the bottom end of the upright. An upper rod was added later. Also at both front and rear, springing was provided by longitudinal torsion bars, and damping was by either Koni twin-tube or Bilstein monotube shock absorbers, mounted inboard. A front anti-roll bar attached to the inboard extensions of the upper A-arms.

The 804 was the first Porsche to come standard with disc brakes. The car used Porsche&#x27;s unique annular ring system. The 804 was also the first Porsche equipped with rack-and-pinion steering.

The car was fitted with 15-inch wheels front and back. The wheels were steel, in contrast to the magnesium pieces being used by some of the competition. The tires were 5.00–15 R tires in front and 6.50-15 R in the rear.

===Engine and transmission===
Design of the new Type 753 flat-eight engine for F1 was handled by Hans Hönick and Hans Mezger. The engine continued the Porsche traditions of a boxer layout and air-cooling.

The bore and stroke were respectively, giving a displacement of . The oversquare dimensions kept piston speeds low, and kept the engine narrow and as far out of the airflow on the sides of the car&#x27;s tub as possible, although it was still wider than the 120° V6 and 90° V8s of the competition.

A prototype engine was first started on a test-bench on 12 December 1960. That first 753 only produced (some sources say ).

During the development of the 804, there were concerns about the readiness of the eight-cylinder engine, so the second chassis, 804-02, was modified to accept the air-cooled 1.5-liter four-cylinder boxer engine type 547 from the 787. That chassis was later converted back to the eight-cylinder configuration. It was never raced with the four-cylinder engine.

Swiss racing driver, engineer and fuel injection specialist Michael May transferred from Mercedes-Benz to Porsche to work on the 753 engine, but wound up developing improvements for the 547/3 engine instead. May&#x27;s changes included reducing the oil pressure, removing two of the engines five piston rings, using a new hardening process on the built-up Hirth crankshaft, narrowing the inlet ports, modifying the piston crowns and valve depth, using direct fuel injection, and adding a second non-drive fan impeller below the driven one. The cam profiles were unchanged. The modified engine, dubbed 547/3B, managed to produce a reliable at a time when May estimated that the 753 was producing just , the Ferrari 156 V6 engine and the Coventry-Climax and BRM V8s about . May felt that the 547/3B could win Formula One races, and showed Porsche&#x27;s engineers that the 804 chassis could be modified to take the four-cylinder. He then struck an agreement with Ferry Porsche to have a 547/3B installed in a 718/2 that May would personally drive in practice at the 1962 Pau Grand Prix. When the car failed to arrive at Pau, May left Porsche for Ferrari. Only three 547/3B engines were ever built.

With a compression ratio of 10.0:1, the 753 flat-eight engine produced at 9200 rpm on its first outing. This was still less power than the new Coventry-Climax and BRM V8 engines. With the improved six-speed transmission from the Type 718 and a ZF limited-slip differential, the car reached a top speed of .

=== Technical summary ===

==Racing history==
The 804 debuted at the 1962 Dutch Grand Prix at Zandvoort on 20 May. This was also the debut race for the Lotus 25 monocoque chassis. The Porsche team was under instructions from Ferry Porsche that the cars should be returned to Stuttgart if they did not perform well in practice. Gurney started from eighth; Bonnier from thirteenth. Gurney managed to climb to third place but retired on lap ten after struggling with a broken shift linkage. Bonnier finished seventh, behind Carel Godin de Beaufort and his four-cylinder 718.

Ferry Porsche was reluctant to commit to another race, reportedly ready to cancel the program at that point. Gurney spent time on the track tuning the car and personally convinced the chairman to field a single 804 for the 1962 Monaco Grand Prix on 3 June. Driven by Gurney, it qualified fifth. A major accident at the first corner immediately after the start caused Richie Ginther&#x27;s BRM to run into the back of Gurney&#x27;s 804, damaging the transaxle and causing Gurney to drop out. Bonnier finished in fifth place with a four-cylinder 718.

The Porsche team sat out the Belgian Grand Prix, leaving privateer Godin de Beaufort to represent the marque with a seventh-place finish in his 718/2. The factory team spent the time in development and testing. Changes to the car included a revised front suspension that added radius rods from the upper A-arms back to a chassis bracket, and on Bonnier&#x27;s car the upper rear A-arms were filled in with fibreglass as a stiffening measure. An anti-roll bar that attached to extensions on the A-arms was added to the rear suspension. There was also a redesigned gear-shift mechanism, revised bodywork around the cockpit, a lower and more reclined seating position, and a detachable steering wheel. The fuel tanks were reshaped around the seat, and the pedals moved forward as part of the changes to the seating position. In addition there was extra diagonal bracing for the chassis, and an increase to the rear track of . After the development phase Ferry Porsche required that the cars be able to complete a full GP-race distance of around the Nürburgring without a mechanical breakdown, which Gurney was able to accomplish while bettering the track&#x27;s existing lap times.

The 1962 French Grand Prix was held on 8 July at Rouen-Les-Essarts rather than Reims. Gurney qualified his 804 in sixth place, and Bonnier&#x27;s sat ninth. Ferrari did not field any cars because of a metalworkers strike, Jim Clark&#x27;s Lotus dropped out on lap 33 with steering/suspension problems and Graham Hill&#x27;s BRM fell out due to a fuel-injection problem. Gurney won the race with an average speed of , having lapped Tony Maggs&#x27; second-place Cooper. Bonnier retired on lap 42 of 54 with a failed fuel pump.

A week later, Gurney and Bonnier drove their 804s in the 1962 Solitude Grand Prix at the Solitude track near Stuttgart. In this non-World-Championship event, Gurney led from start to finish, and Bonnier finished second.

At the 1962 British Grand Prix on 21 July at Aintree, Gurney and Bonnier qualified sixth and seventh respectively. During the race the clutch in Gurney&#x27;s 804 began to slip, but the car still managed a ninth-place finish. Bonnier recovered from a poor start, but later retired with gearbox trouble.

At the 1962 German Grand Prix on 5 August at the Nürburgring&#x27;s Nordschleife track, Gurney started from the pole position in the rain. He only held the lead until the third lap, when he was passed by Graham Hill. On lap five the battery in Gurney&#x27;s car came loose. While wedging the battery against the bulkhead with his foot to keep it from shorting, Gurney ran wide on a corner, allowing Surtees past. Gurney&#x27;s Porsche finished third behind Hill&#x27;s BRM and John Surtees&#x27; Lola. Bonnier finished seventh.

On 12 August Bonnier drove an 804 in the 1962 Kanonloppet at Karlskoga Motorstadion in Sweden, where he placed third. Bonnier and the 804 also appeared at the Ollon-Villars hill-climb held in Switzerland on 25 and 26 August. Competing in the 1100–1599 cc Racing class, driver and car set a new record of .

The 1962 Italian Grand Prix took place at Monza on 16 September. Prior to the race efforts had been made to lighten the car, with the front tubes of the upper A-arms removed and extensive drilling of lightly-stressed components. A driver-activated electromagnetic clutch was also added to the cooling fan, in the hopes that disconnecting the fan would briefly provide additional useful horsepower. Bonnier finished the race in sixth place, while Gurney retired on lap 67 with gearbox damage.

The last race of the Porsche 804 was the 1962 United States Grand Prix on 7 October at Watkins Glen. Gurney started from fourth and finished fifth. Bonnier damaged the gear selector on his car on lap 10, went to the pit twice for repairs and did not finish in the standings.

Just before the end of the season, prior to the running of the South African Grand Prix, Porsche halted its F1 activities. At this point Porsche&#x27;s F1 participation had cost the company £500,000. Huschke von Hanstein announced that the company was withdrawing from F1 to concentrate on endurance racing and the European Hillclimb Championship and that, officially, Ferry Porsche felt that owners of Porsche&#x27;s production cars could not relate to the F1 machines. The company did not believe that expenditures in Formula One would necessarily result in technology that could be applied to their production cars. At this time Porsche was trying to bring the 356&#x27;s successor to market, and was in the process of taking over the Reutters bodyworks.

Even after the announcement, some development work was done on the 804 in 1963. The rear suspension received upper and lower radius rods. Engine modifications brought power up to . The car was not raced again.
