<doc id="755486" wikidata="Q161278" url="?curid=755486" title="Summer time in Europe">
<text>Summer time in Europe is the variation of standard clock time that is applied in most European countries (apart from Iceland, Belarus, Turkey, Ukraine and Russia) in the period between spring and autumn, during which clocks are advanced by one hour from the time observed in the rest of the year, with a view to making the most efficient use of seasonal daylight. It corresponds to the notion and practice of daylight saving time (DST) to be found in some other parts of the world.

In all locations in Europe where summer time is observed (the EU, EFTA and associated countries), European Summer Time begins at 01:00 UTC/WET (02:00 CET, 03:00 EET) on the last Sunday in March (between 25 and 31 March) and ends at 01:00 UTC (02:00 WEST, 03:00 CEST, 04:00 EEST) on the last Sunday in October (between 25 and 31 October) each year; i.e. the change is made at the same absolute time across all time zones. European Union Directive 2000/84/EC makes the observance of summer time mandatory for EU member states (except overseas territories). A proposal to repeal this directive and require that member states observe their own choice year-round is currently going through the legislative process , but has not seen progress since October 2020.

Summer time lasts 30 weeks in years when the last Sunday in March is after the 28th; otherwise, it is 31 weeks.

==History==
Summer Time was first introduced during the First World War. However, most countries discontinued the practice after the war. It was then restarted in various countries during the Second World War and its immediate aftermath. Again it was widely cancelled by the 1950s, but reintroduced in isolated cases until the late 1960s, when the energy crisis of the late 1960s and early 1970s began to prompt policymakers to reintroduce Summer Time across the continent. It has remained in place in most European countries since then.

Historically, the countries of Europe had different practices for observing Summer Time, but this hindered coordination of transport, communications, and movements. Starting in 1981 the European Commission began issuing directives requiring member states to legislate harmonised start and end dates for Summer Time.

Since 1981, each directive has specified a transition time of 01:00 UTC and a start date of the last Sunday in March, but the end dates have differed. Successive Directives laid down two dates for the end: one on the last Sunday in September applied by the continental Member States, and the other on the fourth Sunday in October for the United Kingdom and Ireland. In 1996 the end date was changed to the fourth Sunday in October for all countries. In 1998 the end date was changed to the last Sunday in October; this happened to be the same as the previous rule for 1996 and 1997. The ninth directive, Directive 2000/84/EC, issued January 2001, specifies this rule and remains in force.

==Future==
There were proposals in 2015 and 2016 from members of the European Parliament to abolish summer time observance, but the European Commission did not at that time put forward proposals to be considered, saying it had not found conclusive evidence in favour of a change, and member states were divided. It did, however, note that a cost would be incurred if harmonisation between member states&#x27; summer time rules was lost. In 2017 the Finnish and Lithuanian parliaments both voted in favour of proposals calling on the EU to reconsider daylight saving, with similar criticism from Poland and Sweden. The European Commission at the time was reviewing the practice.

On 8 February 2018, the European Parliament voted to ask the European Commission to re-evaluate DST in Europe. After a web survey, that ran from 4 July to 16 August 2018, in which 4.6 million European citizens participated, showed high support for not switching clocks twice annually, on 12 September 2018 the European Commission decided to propose that an end be put to seasonal clock changes (repealing Directive 2000/84/EC). In order for this to be valid, the standard European Union legislative procedure must be followed, including that the Council of the European Union and the European Parliament must both approve the proposal.

Under the proposal, member countries were expected to decide by 31 March 2019 which time they would observe year round. This was however considered a fairly tight timescale by many. The Internet Assigned Numbers Authority, which coordinates changes to the time zone database used by most computers and smartphones, notes that &quot;With less than a year&#x27;s notice there is a good chance that some computer-based clocks will operate incorrectly after the change, due to delays in propagating updates to software and data.&quot; The airline industry pointed out the complexity of revising all airline schedules, particularly in terms of ensuring slot availability on flights outside the EU, and recommended keeping the status quo or deferring the change until at least 2021. An informal meeting of EU transport ministers on 29 October 2018 suggested that many member states would not support the &quot;unrealistic&quot; timetable and that implementation could be pushed back to 2021.

Discussions have shown support for year-round &quot;winter time&quot; in e.g. Denmark, the Netherlands (UTC+01:00), and Finland (UTC+02:00) while permanent summer time was supported in France, Germany and Poland (UTC+02:00), and Cyprus (UTC+03:00). Portugal, Spain, and Italy are in favour of keeping current daylight saving regime.

On 4 March 2019, the European Parliament Transport and Tourism Committee approved the Commission&#x27;s proposal by 23 votes to 11. The start date was, however, to be postponed until 2021 at the earliest, to ensure a smooth transition, and the Commission is to ensure that countries&#x27; decisions to retain winter or summer time are coordinated and do not disrupt the internal market. This decision was confirmed by the full European Parliament on 26 March; it must now be approved by the Council of the European Union. As of November 2021, this approval has not yet been obtained. Under the draft directive, member states would have chosen whether to remain on their current summer time, in which case the last transition would have been on the last Sunday of March 2021, or their current winter time, which would have taken permanent effect from the last Sunday of October 2021.

A consultation by the Irish government found that 80% of those surveyed would not support any measure that resulted in different time zones between Northern Ireland and the Republic. In July 2019, Ireland announced its opposition to the proposed directive and intends to lobby other EU states on the issue. A qualified majority of 55% of member states representing at least 65% of the European population is required for the Council of Ministers to implement a directive. In the UK, the House of Lords launched a new inquiry in July 2019 to consider the implications of the European changes, explore the preparations that should be made and the factors that should inform the UK&#x27;s response. The United Kingdom left the EU on 31 January 2020, before any reform became effective; EU rules continued to apply during the transition period (up until 31 December 2020) but thereafter the UK could choose to make its own arrangements. If the UK were thus to continue observing summer/winter time, Northern Ireland would have a one-hour time difference for 30 or 31 weeks of the year either with the rest of Ireland or with the rest of the UK. In September 2018, the UK Government said that it &quot;has no plans&quot; to end daylight saving.

, the decision has not been confirmed by the Council of the European Union. The Council has asked the Commission to produce a detailed impact assessment, but the Commission considers that the onus is on the Member States to find a common position in Council. As a result, progress on the issue is effectively blocked. 

Poland intends to resolve the issue during its presidency of the EU in 2025. 

==Table of transition dates for European Summer Time==

European Summer Time begins (clocks go forward) at 01:00 UTC on the last Sunday in March, and ends (clocks go back) at 01:00 UTC on the last Sunday in October:


==Double Summer Time==
&quot;Double Summer Time&quot; (two hours ahead of local winter time) has been observed on some occasions, notably in 1921, 1941–45, and 1947. See:
* British Double Summer Time (UTC+02:00)
* Central European Midsummer Time (UTC+03:00)
* Moscow Midsummer Time (UTC+05:00)

==Countries not switching to and from summer time==
There are five countries that do not use summer time, but keep the same time all year.

Some may be thought of as using &quot;permanent&quot; summer time, since they use time zones allocated to regions further east than themselves. Belarus explicitly decided to stay permanently on (what it formerly called) summer time after 2011.
* Greenland moved to permanent summer time (UTC-02:00) in spring 2023.
* Iceland observes UTC+00:00 all year round despite being at longitudes (13°W-24°W) which would indicate UTC-01:00. Iceland&#x27;s high latitude (the Reykjavík region, home to nearly two-thirds of the country&#x27;s people, is at 64°N) means that sunset and sunrise times change by many hours over the year, and the effect of changing the clock by one hour would, in comparison, be small.
* Russia used &quot;permanent summer time&quot; from 2011 to 2014. In October 2014 Russia changed permanently back to standard time (UTC+03:00) in the country&#x27;s west, including Moscow, setting the clocks back one hour at the same time as other European countries did.
* Turkey decided to stop daylight saving time in September 2016, but decided to stay on UTC+03:00 throughout the year rather than switching back to its original time zone UTC+02:00.

Spain, France, Belgium, and the Netherlands may also be thought of as observing &quot;summer time&quot; throughout the winter, and &quot;double-summer time&quot; during summer, because of their positions to the west of the central European time zone.

==Local observations==
In most of Europe, the word &quot;Summer&quot; is added to the name of each European time zone during this period: thus, in the UTC+01:00 time zone, Central European Time becomes Central European Summer Time (UTC+02:00).

===Austria===
Austria used summer time in 1916–1918, 1920, 1940–1948 (as part of Nazi Germany between 1940 and 1945), and since 1980.

====Austria-Hungary====
Austria-Hungary used summer time during World War I in 1916, 1917, and 1918, in line with the German Empire.

===Bulgaria===
Summer time was introduced in Bulgaria in 1979 by a regulation of the Bulgarian Council of Ministers. Bulgaria observes the European Union rules for summer time.

===Croatia===
Croatia was a part of Yugoslavia as summer time was introduced in 1983. Yugoslavia was the last country in Europe introducing summer time. After gaining independence in the Croatian War of Independence in 1992, Croatia followed the Central European way to change the time on the last Sunday of March and on the last Sunday of October, respectively on the last Sunday of September till 1995.

===Czech Republic===

In the Kingdom of Bohemia summer time was used for three seasons during World War I, from 1916 to 1918, while part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire.

During World War II, when the Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia became a de facto part of Nazi Germany, summer time was used from 1940. In 1940/1941 and 1941/1942, summer time was kept continuously even during the winter.

Czechoslovakia used summer time from 1945 to 1949 and from 1979 to 1992. In winter 1946/1947 (from 1 December to 23 February), winter time (CET+01:00) was used.

The Czech Republic continued to use summer time after the dissolution of Czechoslovakia in 1993.

===Denmark===
Summer time has been observed in Denmark since 1980. A national association against summer time (Landsforeningen mod Sommertid) exists, which celebrated the EU commission preliminary decision in August 2018.

====Faroe Islands====
The Faroe Islands has observed summer time since 1981. The islands have never been part of the EU, so the decision to observe summer time was its own.

====Greenland====

From 1980 to 2023, Greenland observed summer time simultaneously with Europe. In November 2022, the Greenland parliament voted to remain on permanent summer time from spring 2023 onwards. Exceptions, based on company decisions, are the northeastern coast around Danmarkshavn (UTC year-round) for Thule Air Base (which follows Atlantic Time and observes in accordance with US and Canadian rules).

===Estonia===
In Estonia summer time was not used in 1990–1996 and 2000–2001. It was used under Soviet rule in 1981–1989.

===Finland===
In Finland, summer time has been used on a regular basis since 1981.

A citizens&#x27; initiative to abolish daylight saving time was signed by 70,000 Finnish citizens. It was presented to the Finnish parliament in June 2017.

===France and Monaco===
France and Monaco follow Central European Time and Central European Summer Time. They apply EU rules regarding the start and end times and dates for summer time.

From 1923 until the Second World War, France and Monaco observed summer time from the last Saturday in March until the first Saturday in October. During the Second World War France also observed summer time. However, after the war the practice was abandoned (since the country changed time zones instituting &quot;de facto&quot; permanent summer time). In 1976, summer time was reimplemented because of the oil crisis.

Since UTC+00:00 is France&#x27;s &quot;natural&quot; time zone (extreme points correspond to UTC-0:20 to UTC+0:38), its use of UTC+01:00 in winter could be seen as a form of daylight saving time, while its use of Central European Summer Time (UTC+02:00) in summer can be seen as a form of &quot;double summer time&quot;.

===Germany===
Summer time was first introduced during World War I by the German Empire from 1916 to 1918. After the end of the war and the proclamation of the Weimar Republic in November 1918, summer time ceased to be observed. Summer time was reintroduced in 1940, during World War II, to try to save energy for the war economy. After the defeat of Germany, summer time was retained by the occupation powers. In 1945, Berlin and the Soviet Occupation Zone even observed Central European Midsummer Time (&quot;Mitteleuropäische Hochsommerzeit&quot;, &quot;MEHSZ&quot;; GMT+03:00): in 1947, all of Germany switched to midsummer time from 11 May to 29 June. After the Federal Republic (West Germany) and the German Democratic Republic (East Germany) were established in 1949, summer time again ceased to be observed in 1950.

In 1978, West Germany decided to reintroduce summer time, following the example set by several neighbouring states in the aftermath of the 1973 oil crisis. However, it only came into effect in 1980, after West and East Germany reached an agreement to observe summer time simultaneously from the last Sunday in March (02:00 CET) to the last Sunday in September (03:00 CEST). Thus both German states observed the same time until the German reunification in 1990, after which the reunified Germany retained the laws and thus also the Time Act (&quot;Zeitgesetz&quot;) of West Germany.

After 1980, West and East Germany; since 1991 reunified Germany: Central European Summer Time.

Büsingen am Hochrhein, a small exclave of Germany entirely surrounded by Swiss territory, did not implement summer time in 1980 but observed the same time as Switzerland; thus there was a one-hour time difference between this village and the rest of Germany. For the tz database, the zone Europe/Busingen was created in its 2013a release, because since the Unix time epoch in 1970, Büsingen am Hochrhein has shared clocks with Zürich, but not with Germany every year.

Germany follows the EU rules regarding the start and end times and dates for summer time.

===Greece===
Summer time was first introduced in Greece in 1932, from July 6 to September 1, but the idea was then quickly abandoned.

In the early 1970s and in the aftermath of the 1973 energy crisis that led many European states to implement summer time in order to save energy, Greece reintroduced summer time in 1975 for the period March–September.

Since 1997, Greece follows the EU rules regarding the start and end times and dates for summer time.

===Hungary===
Summer time was first introduced in Hungary in 1916, and it was observed until 1919. After that, summer time was in use between 1941–1949 and 1954–1957. Summer time has been in use again since 1980 and follows EU rules.

===Iceland===
Iceland uses UTC+00:00 but has not used summer time since April 1968. From 1908 to 1968 Iceland used GMT−01:00. Summer time was used in 1917–1919, 1921 and 1939–1967.
The European Union Directive 2000/84/EC is valid also in the European Economic Area, but Iceland has a special exception from it.

===Ireland===
In Ireland, Irish Standard Time (IST) (UTC+01, Western European Summer Time) is observed during Summer (March to October). IST is sometimes mistaken for &quot;Irish Summer Time&quot;, though this is incorrect. Winter Time (UTC+00, WET) is observed in the rest of the year.

(Northern Ireland, as part of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, observes UK time. , this is the same as the rest of Ireland).

===Italy, San Marino, and Vatican City===
Summer time is known as &quot;ora legale&quot; (literally &quot;legal hour&quot;, referencing the fact that it is mandated by law) in Italy, and it has been adopted and abolished several times: it was observed from 1916 to 1920 and between 1940 and 1948. A law was approved in 1965 that took effect the following year, and made the application of summer time mandatory in the whole country. Since 1996, it has been coordinated with the European Union. San Marino and Vatican City State share land borders solely with Italy and observe the same time as in Italy.

===Netherlands===

In 1940 the German occupants forced the Netherlands to observe CEST, Germany&#x27;s Daylight Saving Time, effectively advancing its time by one hour and 40 minutes. This time stayed in effect year round until 1942, when the normal clock followed the German DST switches.

The use of DST was abandoned directly after the war, and not observed again until 1977, when summer time was observed again, which it currently still is.

===Norway===
In Norway, summer time was observed in 1916, 1940–45, and 1959–65. The arrangement was controversial, and in 1965 the Norwegian parliament (Stortinget) voted to discontinue the practice. Their neighbour, Sweden, did not use it.

However, in 1980 summer time was reintroduced (together with Sweden and Denmark), and since at least 2002 Norway has followed the European Union in this matter.

===Poland===
In Poland, &quot;the summer time&quot; was observed in the following years:
* 1916–1919
* 1940–1949
* 1957–1964
* 1977–present
In the years 1979–1995 the last day of summer time was the last Sunday of September. In 1996 it was changed to the last Sunday of October, to synchronise with other countries of the EU.

===Portugal===
Most of Portugal operates Western European Time and Western European Summer Time, although the majority of mainland Portugal, west of 7º30&#x27;W, was supposed to be operating in UTC-1.

Summer time (locally known as &quot;hora de Verão&quot;) was introduced in 1916. In the years 1922, 1923, 1925, 1930 and 1933 summer time was not applied. From 1966 to 1976 permanent summer time was applied in Portugal (UTC+1), Madeira (UTC) and Azores (UTC-1).

Since 1912, the official time in Madeira was UTC-1, and in the Azores was UTC-2. However, since 1976 in Madeira (belonging to time zone -1), the official time is the same as that of Continental Portugal (UTC) and, in the Azores (belonging to time zone -2), it is one hour behind (UTC-1) the mainland. The start and end dates for summer time in Portugal follow the pattern in the rest of the EU.

===Romania===
Summer time in Romania (locally known by &quot;Ora de Vară&quot;) was originally introduced in 1932 (between 22 May and 2 October). Between 1933 and 1940 summer time started on the first Sunday in April and ended on the first Sunday in October. Summer time was abandoned in 1941 and reintroduced in 1979. Since 1996, with few exceptions, summer time in Romania follows European Union rules.

===Russia===

A decree of the Russian Provisional Government introduced summer time () in Russia on 1 July 1917, and clocks moved one hour forward. A decree of the Soviet government led to the abandonment of this system six months later: clocks moved one hour back again on 28 December.

From 1930, Decree time had the effect of imposing year-round time-zone advances in the Soviet Union.

A decision of the Council of Ministers of the USSR reintroduced summer time in the USSR (Moscow Summer Time, for example) on 1 April 1981, and its practice continued into post-Soviet times until 2011. The changeover dates in Russia were the same as for other European countries, but clocks were moved forward or back at 02:00 local time in all zones. Thus in Moscow (local time = UTC+03:00 in winter, UTC+04:00 in summer), summer time commenced at 02:00 UTC on the day before the last Sunday in March, and ended at 03:00 UTC on the day before the last Sunday in October. (&quot;Day before the last Sunday&quot; is not the same as &quot;the last Saturday&quot; in a month where the last day is a Saturday.)
On 8 February 2011, Russian President Dmitry Medvedev announced cancellation of biannual clock changes in Russia in favor of a permanent switch to summer time. An hour was added in March 2011 for the last time, and clocks did not move back again. At the same time some of Russia&#x27;s time zones were consolidated. After this reform many Russian cities had a &quot;standard time&quot; two hours more than would be suggested by their &quot;astronomical time&quot; (because the original standard time was already ahead of astronomical time in many areas).

During his 2012 election campaign, Vladimir Putin proposed re-introducing summer time, as some workers had complained about not seeing any daylight during the winter, since the sun had not risen when they went to work. According to a report in the &quot;International Herald Tribune&quot;, Russian citizens remembered the winter of 2011–12 as the &quot;darkest winter on record&quot; as a result of the time change. However, Putin later said it would be up to then Prime Minister Medvedev&#x27;s cabinet to decide how to proceed with a seasonal time shift, and it decided to stay with the 2011 policy.

On 26 October 2014, Russia permanently returned to &quot;winter&quot; time.

===Slovakia===
Slovakia used summer time (locally known as &quot;Letný čas&quot;) in 1916, 1917, and 1918 (as part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire), then again in the early 1940s (as the Slovak Republic (1939–1945), a client-state of Nazi Germany).

In 1979, Slovakia, as part of Czechoslovakia, established that summer time begins annually in the first weekend of April (moved to the last weekend in March in 1981) and ends in the last weekend of September.

After the dissolution of Czechoslovakia in 1993, independent Slovakia continued to use summer time. From 1996, Slovakia has prolonged summer time by about one month so it lasts until the last weekend in October, in accordance with European Union rules.

===Slovenia===
Summer time in Slovenia (locally known as &quot;Poletni čas&quot;) was introduced on 16 November 1982 to be practised from 1983 on. At that time, Slovenia was one of the Yugoslav republics. The same law was valid until 1996 when the end of summer time was changed from the first Sunday in October to the last Sunday in October. In 2006, the European Union standard was adopted and is still used today.

===Spain===
Spain including the Canary Islands has summer time, applying EU rules regarding the start and end times and dates.

In 1918, Spain observed summer time for the first time, and then introduced and abolished several times. It was abolished autumn 1949, and then reintroduced 1974 and has been used since. Spain used GMT+00:00 from 1901 to 1940 and GMT+01:00 from 1940 as standard time. The Canary Islands used GMT-01:00 before 1946 and GMT+00:00 since 1946 as standard time.

Since UTC+00:00 is Spain&#x27;s &quot;natural&quot; time zone (extreme points, except Canary Islands, correspond to UTC-0:37 to UTC+0:17), its use of UTC+01:00 in winter could be seen as a form of daylight saving time, while its use of Central European Summer Time (UTC+02:00) in summer can be seen as a form of &quot;double summer time&quot;.

===Sweden===
In Sweden summer time was originally introduced on 15 May 1916. It proved unpopular, and on 30 September in the same year, Sweden returned to year-round standard time. This continued for more than half a century.

On 6 April 1980, Sweden again introduced summer time, and since then summer time has been observed every summer in Sweden. Except for the introduction year 1980, summer time has always started on the last Sunday in March. It ended on the last Sunday in September during the years 1980–1995, and has ended on the last Sunday in October since 1996, following a unification of start/end dates of summer time within the EU as well as in several European countries then outside the EU.

The transit authority Västtrafik changes its clocks at 04:00, so that the last tram that leaves around 03:30 actually goes 02:30 on the last weekend of October for those who have changed their clocks at the legal time. The public transport company SL changes their clocks at the legal time, and runs extra departures during the October transition hour.

===Switzerland and Liechtenstein===
The second last country in Europe (only before Yugoslavia ) to adopt summer time, in 1981, was Switzerland, even though summer time had been rejected by 52.1% of voters in a federal referendum in 1978.
Since 1996, Swiss summer time has followed EU regulations. It had formerly been in use in 1941 and 1942. Liechtenstein observes the same time as Switzerland. The German village of Büsingen am Hochrhein, a small exclave entirely surrounded by Swiss territory, also observes the same time as in Switzerland. It did not implement summer time in 1980 and observed the same time as Switzerland, so that in 1980, there was a time difference of one hour during the implementation of summer time in Germany between Büsingen am Hochrhein and the rest of West Germany.

===Turkey===

Summer time was introduced in Turkey in 1947, but suspended from 1965 to 1972. Since 1974, Turkey follows European Summer Time.

In 2008, the Turkish Ministry of Energy proposed that Turkey should abolish summer time while at the same time switching to UTC+02:30, originally from 2009 onwards, but when this appeared infeasible, to start in 2011, the plan has not been heard of since.

For the year 2011, Turkey switched to European Summer Time at 3:00 am (03:00) on Monday 28 March, one day later than the rest of Europe, to avoid disrupting the national university entrance examinations held on 27 March.

Once again, for the year 2014, Turkey switched to European Summer Time at 3:00 am (03:00) on Monday 31 March, one day later than the rest of Europe, to avoid disrupting the local elections held on 30 March.

In 2015, Turkey delayed the switch from European Summer Time by 2 weeks, to 4:00 am (04:00) on Sunday 8 November, two weeks later than the rest of Europe, due to the calling of a snap general election on Sunday, 1 November.

In 2016, Turkey scrapped winter time, by permanently staying in UTC+03:00 daylight saving time zone passed Thursday 8 September.

===Ukraine===
Summer time was introduced in Ukraine in the early 1980s; from 1981 till 1989 this was Moscow Summer Time; since 1992 Eastern European Summer Time has been used.

On 20 September 2011, the Verkhovna Rada (Ukrainian parliament) voted not to return from Eastern European Summer Time to Eastern European Time. This change would have had the effect of moving Ukraine into the Further-eastern European Time zone UTC+03:00 along with Belarus and western Russia (which do not observe summer time). However, on 18 October 2011 the Parliament canceled these plans and the country returned to Eastern European Time as scheduled. 295 MPs voted in favour out of 349 registered MPs.

On 3 March 2021, the Verkhovna Rada voted on bill No. 4201 &quot;Draft Law on time observation in Ukraine&quot; which will abandon transitioning to summer time and establish year-round standard time on the whole territory of Ukraine. The bill received 277 votes from the 370 MPs present during the first reading. On 19 March, the bill was rejected in a second reading with 212 out of 226 required votes and was sent to an additional second reading instead. On 16 July 2024, the bill got passed, thus, the last clock transition is scheduled for 27 October 2024.

The regions of eastern Ukraine under the occupation of Russia, including Crimea, observe Further-eastern European Time.

===United Kingdom===
The standard time zone for the whole United Kingdom is Greenwich Mean Time (GMT), (UTC+00:00, WET), which is based on the solar time at Greenwich Observatory, London. The country observes British Summer Time (BST) (UTC+01:00), which is equivalent to WEST used in Portugal and Irish Standard Time in Ireland, in accordance with the standard European timings.

Summer time was first implemented under the Summer Time Act 1916. Subsequent legislation has altered this: Summer Time Act 1922; Time (Ireland) Act, 1916; Summer Time Act, 1925; Emergency Powers (Defence) Act, 1939; The Summer Time Order 1964; The Summer Time Order 1967; Summer Time Act 1972; The Summer Time Order 1997; and The Summer Time Order 2002.

The UK did not revert to GMT for the three winters of 1968–69, 1969–70 and 1970–71, remaining on BST continuously from 18 February 1968 to 31 October 1971.

The UK was, until 23:00 GMT on 31 January 2020, a member state of the European Union. Since 1996, all clocks in the European Union have changed to summer or winter time on the same dates and at the same moment, at 01:00 UTC+00:00 (Thus summer time ends at 01:59:59 UTC+01:00).
* Summer Time starts: Last Sunday in March
* Summer Time ends: Last Sunday in October

, it appears that the UK government intends to continue to operate winter and summer time on these dates, irrespective of any EU decision on the matter. This may have the effect that Northern Ireland will have a different time zone from the Republic of Ireland.

The Crown Dependencies also observe Greenwich Mean Time and British Summer Time, although under separate legislation. In 2008, Jersey held a referendum to consider moving permanently to Central European Time in winter and Central European Summer Time in summer; however, this was rejected.

None of the UK&#x27;s fourteen British Overseas Territories observe BST. Gibraltar observes CET and CEST, in line with neighbouring Spain. Due to Gibraltar&#x27;s longitude, which is further west than much of the UK, it could be considered that Gibraltar is on permanent summer time, and observes double summer time during the summer months.

<text>The pin-tailed snipe or pintail snipe (Gallinago stenura) is a species of bird in the family Scolopacidae, the sandpipers.

==Distribution==
It breeds in northern Russia and migrates to spend the non-breeding season in southern Asia from Pakistan to Indonesia. It is the most common migrant snipe in southern India, Sri Lanka and much of Southeast Asia. It is a vagrant to north-western and northern Australia, and to Kenya in East Africa.

==Habitat==
Its breeding habitat is damp marshes and tundra in Arctic and boreal Russia. Birds in their non-breeding range use a variety of wetlands, often with common snipe, but may be found also in drier habitats than their relative. They nest in a well-hidden location on the ground.

These birds forage in mud or soft soil, probing or picking up food by sight. They mainly eat insects and earthworms, but also some plant material.

==Description==
This 25–27 cm long bird is similar to the longer-billed and longer-tailed common snipe. Adults have short greenish-grey legs and a long straight dark bill. The body is mottled brown on top, with cream lines down their back. They are pale underneath with a streaked buff breast and white belly. They have a dark stripe through the eye, with light stripes above and below it. Sexes are similar, and immatures differ only in minor plumage details.

The wings are less pointed than common snipe, and lack the white trailing edge of that species. The shorter tail and flatter flight path when flushed also made flight separation from Common relatively easy.

Male pin-tailed snipes often display in a group, with a loud repetitive &quot;tcheka&quot; song which has a crescendo of fizzing and buzzing sounds, and also whistling noises produced in flight by the pin-like outer tail feathers which give this species its English name. The normal call is a weak &quot;&quot;.

<doc id="755501" wikidata="Q7829645" url="?curid=755501" title="Tower City Center">
<text>Tower City Center is a large mixed-use facility in downtown Cleveland, Ohio, on its Public Square. The facility is composed of a number of interconnected office buildings, including Terminal Tower, the Skylight Park mixed-use shopping center, Jack Cleveland Casino, Hotel Cleveland, Chase Financial Plaza, and Tower City station, the main hub of Cleveland&#x27;s four RTA Rapid Transit lines.

The structure was built in 1929 as Cleveland Union Terminal. On March 17, 1976, the complex was added to the National Register of Historic Places.

== History ==
=== Rail terminal ===

The building complex was originally commissioned by the Van Sweringen brothers, prominent local railroad moguls and real estate developers. The center of the complex was Cleveland Union Terminal (CUT), a terminal for all trains coming into Cleveland via the various railroad lines in a concept similar to Grand Central Terminal in New York City.

When Cleveland Union Terminal was built, the train station allocated the northern set of tracks for interurban or rapid transit service and the southern set of tracks for inter-city rail service. The portion of the station above the interurban tracks was called the Traction Concourse and the portion above the intercity train tracks was called the Steam Concourse. The Van Sweringen brothers envisioned a network of interurban lines extending from the CUT in all directions. They even acquired right-of-way for some of the lines.

The complex was designed by the firm of Graham, Anderson, Probst &amp; White. Site preparation began in 1922, and approximately 2,200 buildings were demolished. Construction began in 1926, and structural work was completed by 1927. At the time, it was the second-largest excavation project in the world after the Panama Canal. The Terminal Tower opened to its first tenants in 1928. From its completion until 1964, the Terminal Tower was the tallest building in North America outside of New York City. Three other office buildings, the Medical Arts Building, Builders Exchange Building, and Midland Building, were built in addition to the Terminal Tower. The three Art Deco buildings are collectively known as the Landmark Office Towers Complex and were completed in 1929. In addition to the new buildings, the 1918 Hotel Cleveland was connected to the complex. Cleveland Union Terminal was dedicated and officially opened in 1930.

The facility included a number of retail stores and restaurants. Original designs for the complex show that at first the brothers did not plan on building an office tower within the complex. However, they eventually decided to build the 52-story Terminal Tower on the northeast side of the complex facing Public Square.

In 1931, the Higbee Company moved its main store to a new building connected to Cleveland Union Terminal. In 1934, the U.S. Postal Service moved its main Cleveland office to Union Terminal in a new building designed by the firm of Walker and Weeks. It was known as M.K. Ferguson Plaza under the ownership of Forest City Enterprises.

The Union Terminal served most rail lines: the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad, New York Central Railroad and Nickel Plate Road. Exceptions were the Pennsylvania Railroad and initially the Erie Railroad.
Notable trains, particularly for their destinations included:
*Baltimore and Ohio Railroad:
**&quot;Cleveland Night Express&quot; (Cleveland–Pittsburgh–Baltimore)
**&quot;Washingtonian&quot; (Cleveland–Pittsburgh–Baltimore)
*Erie Railroad, with the Pittsburgh and Lake Erie Railroad:
**&quot;Steel King&quot; (Cleveland–Pittsburgh, with morning and evening variations)
*New York Central Railroad:
**&quot;Chicagoan&quot; (Chicago–New York)
**&quot;Cincinnati Mercury&quot; (Cincinnati–Cleveland) (beginning in fall, 1951)
**&quot;Cleveland Mercury&quot; (Detroit–Cleveland)
**&quot;Empire State Express&quot; (Cleveland–New York)
**&quot;Fifth Avenue Special&quot; (Chicago–Cleveland-New York)
**&quot;Iroquois&quot; (Boston–Chicago; in most years operating westbound only; in some years terminating in Cleveland, in some years having New York as the eastern terminus)
**&quot;North Star&quot; (New York–Cleveland; in most years operating westbound only)
**&quot;Ohio State Limited&quot; (Cincinnati–Cleveland–New York; in some years stopping for east-bound trips only, in other years running through the city without stopping)
**&quot;Pacemaker&quot; (Chicago–Cleveland–New York; in some years stopping for east-bound trips only; in latter years: Cleveland–New York)
**&quot;Southwestern Limited&quot; (St. Louis–Indianapolis–Cleveland–New York)
*Nickel Plate Road (Norfolk and Western in final year of service):
**&quot;Nickel Plate Limited&quot; (Chicago–Buffalo) [later named &quot;City of Chicago&quot; westbound/&quot;City of Cleveland&quot; eastbound]
**&quot;Blue Arrow&quot; (Cleveland–St. Louis)/&quot;Blue Dart&quot; (St. Louis–Cleveland)

However, the station was never particularly popular with the railroads. It required deviating from the quicker route along Lake Erie. As the city would not allow trains to operate under steam power near the downtown area, trains were forced to switch from steam to electric power at a suburban rail yard when heading inbound and then reverse on the way out at another yard. As a result, some lines began to bypass the station entirely, heading along the lake route, and some trains stopped serving the city altogether (examples of the latter case: the New York Central Railroad&#x27;s &quot;Lake Shore Limited&quot; and the &quot;New England States&quot;).

Several east–west routes on the circuit of trains bound east from Chicago through northern Ohio bypassed the city, traveling slightly to the south, passing through Akron and Youngstown, as in the case of B&amp;O and Erie mainlines. In addition, national passenger rail travel had already passed its peak and was starting its gradual decline in favor of the automobile and, later, the airplane. The Erie Railroad, owned by the Van Sweringens, could not afford the electric transfer and continued to use its own nearby station until 1948, when it replaced steam with diesel locomotives and was able to serve the Union Terminal under its own power.

By the end of 1965, the B&amp;O and the Norfolk and Western (the successor to the Nickel Plate) had terminated their last trains that had served Cleveland. By the end of 1967, the New York Central had discontinued all named trains that had run through Cleveland. All that remained as passenger trains were unnamed successors to trains #51 (westbound &quot;Empire State Express&quot;), #90 (eastbound successor to the &quot;Chicagoan&quot;), #27/28 (successor to the &quot;New England States&quot;) and #63/#64 (Chicago–New York) trains.

In the lead-up to the arrival of Amtrak, in 1970 the Erie Lackawanna ran an unnamed train to Youngstown. The Penn Central (successor to the New York Central) Chicago-bound trains stopping at the terminal included an unnamed remnant of the &quot;Empire State Express&quot; and another unnamed train. East-bound, there was an unnamed successor to the &quot;New England States,&quot; as well as two other unnamed trains. Southwest-bound there was an Indianapolis-destined remnant of the &quot;Southwestern Limited&quot; and an &quot;Ohio State Limited&quot; remnant bound for Columbus.

Amtrak&#x27;s short-lived &quot;Lake Shore&quot; served Union Terminal for seven months in 1971, but the railroad found the rents prohibitive. When the new &quot;Lake Shore Limited&quot; began in 1975, Amtrak chose to construct a new station near Lake Erie adjacent to the Cleveland Memorial Shoreway. The new Amtrak station is located near the former Cleveland Union Depot, once served by the Pennsylvania Railroad. The former Erie Railroad commuter service, ultimately inherited by Conrail, was discontinued on January 14, 1977, ending the facility&#x27;s use as a railroad station.

However, in 2021, a rail advocacy group by the name of &#x27;All Aboard Ohio&#x27;, voted in favor of returning Amtrak service to Union Terminal, in the anticipation of a proposed dramatic increase in rail service.



===Shopping mall===
Most of the platform area was demolished in the late 1980s renovation of the building. The station area itself was converted by Forest City Enterprises into a three-story, 367,000 square foot shopping mall and food court known as The Avenue, which opened on March 26, 1990. As part of the renovation, RTA rebuilt its rapid transit station beneath the center. The rest of the platform area was turned into a parking garage for the new complex. When the already renamed Tower City Center reopened, the mall housed many high-end retailers, including Bally of Switzerland, Barneys New York, Fendi, Gucci, Versace, and even had a letter of intent from Neiman Marcus to build a 120,000-square foot anchor store in 1992. Over the following 25 years, many of those shops were replaced by more-modest stores, some of them local retailers.

In 1991, two new 11-story office towers, the Skylight Office Tower and the Chase Financial Plaza, were added. The Chase Building houses Cleveland&#x27;s Ritz-Carlton Hotel and The Skylight Office Tower once housed the Hard Rock Cafe. After the completion of the nearby Gateway project in 1994, RTA built an indoor walkway connecting Tower City to the complex. A second walkway was built in 2002 to connect Tower City with the Carl B. Stokes U.S. Courthouse.

Higbee&#x27;s (by then bought by Dillard&#x27;s) closed its department store in the complex in January 2002. Positively Cleveland (formerly the Convention and Visitors Bureau of Greater Cleveland) and the Greater Cleveland Partnership (the local chamber of commerce) opened offices in the Higbee Building in 2007. Until late 2010, the Cleveland Plus Visitors Center occupied the first floor. The building was opened on May 14, 2012, as the Horseshoe Casino Cleveland. After Rock Gaming LLC assumed management of the Horseshoe, the casino was transformed into Jack Cleveland Casino and reopened on May 11, 2016.

In 2001, Time Warner Cable Amphitheater opened as an outdoor stage along the Cuyahoga River near the Tower City Complex. A site on the Cuyahoga River side of the complex was proposed as a location for a new Cleveland convention center, but in January, 2009 the Cuyahoga County Commissioners decided to redevelop the existing facility.

In July 2021 businessman Dan Gilbert&#x27;s company Bedrock announced plans to convert the mall into a &quot;retail marketplace&quot; with a blend of retail and entertainment. After renovations were completed in 2022, the main atrium was renamed to &quot;Skylight Park&quot;.

==Former rapid transit stations==
===Former Red Line station===
The Red Line took the place of a never-completed interurban line. An additional vault for that line was located at Mayfield Road, now the Little Italy–University Circle station.

==== History ====
The Shaker rapid transit remained the only service using the interurban portion of the CUT for 25 years. When the Cleveland Transit System built its rapid transit (later designated the Red Line) in 1955 (using much of the right-of-way previously developed by the Van Sweringens), another rapid transit station was built in the former interurban area of the CUT to serve it. Since the CTS Rapid Transit (Red Line) and the Shaker rapid transit (Green and Blue Lines) were owned by different entities at the time, there was no fare transfer between the trains, and the stations were entirely separate.

In 1968, the Cleveland Transit System line finished its extension through Cleveland&#x27;s west side to Cleveland Hopkins International Airport and Cleveland became the first North American city with direct rapid transit access from downtown to an airport.

Both lines became part of the Greater Cleveland Regional Transit Authority when it assumed control on September 5, 1975. The two stations remained separate until December 17, 1990, when an entirely new station was completed with the development of Tower City Center.

===Former Shaker Rapid station===
These platforms opened with the extension of the Cleveland Interurban Railroad from just east of the ramp at East 34th Street and Broadway in 1930.

==== History ====
Since the Van Sweringens-owned Cleveland Interurban Railroad which served the suburb of Shaker Heights, the interurban portion of the CUT was immediately occupied by the Shaker trains upon completion on July 20, 1930. (Previously, the Shaker trains had used streetcar tracks to reach downtown from East 34th Street, which caused significantly slower service.) The Shaker rapid transit station was located along the northernmost tracks of the complex, and it included a small yard for the storage of a few trains and a loop to allow trains to reverse direction. Development of the other interurban services, however, was stalled by the Great Depression, which hit the Van Sweringens particularly hard. By 1944, ownership of the Shaker rapid transit passed to the city of Shaker Heights.

The Shaker and Van Aken lines became part of the Greater Cleveland Regional Transit Authority when it assumed control on September 5, 1975. The two stations remained separate until December 17, 1990, when a completely new station was completed with the development of Tower City Center.

The platform was temporarily re-opened for westbound passengers in 2016, 2017, 2020, and 2024.

<doc id="755506" wikidata="Q3142272" url="?curid=755506" title="Hugh Kelly (poet)">
<text>Hugh Kelly (c. 1739 – 3 February 1777) was an Irish dramatist and poet. From the 1760s he was employed as a propagandist for the British government, attacking members of the Opposition. After arriving in London in 1760 to work as a staymaker, he soon turned to become a writer and made a living as a journalist. In 1766 he published &quot;Thespis&quot;, a long poem about the acting profession, which gained him wide attention. He followed up this success with the novel &quot;Memoirs of a Magdalen&quot; in 1767. He ultimately became known for his stage plays such as the comedy &quot;False Delicacy&quot; and &quot;A Word to the Wise&quot;.

==Early life==
The son of a Dublin publican, Hugh Kelly was born in Killarney, County Kerry. He enjoyed a reasonable education but was forced to drop out following his father&#x27;s financial difficulties. He was apprenticed to a staymaker, and in 1760, went to London where he worked at his trade for some time, fairly unsuccessfully, and then became an attorney&#x27;s clerk. He contributed to various newspapers, and wrote pamphlets for booksellers. Much of his early life remains uncertain and relies on anecdotes told by his contemporaries.

==Writer==

===First success===
In 1766, he published anonymously &quot;Thespis; or, A Critical Examination into the Merits of All the Principal Performers belonging to Drury Lane Theatre&quot;, a poem in the heroic couplet containing violent attacks on the principal contemporary actors and actresses. The poem opens with a panegyric on David Garrick, however, and bestows foolish praise on friends of the writer. This satire was partly inspired by Churchill&#x27;s &quot;Rosciad&quot;, but its criticism is obviously dictated chiefly by personal prejudice. In 1767, he produced a second part, less scurrilous in tone, dealing with the Covent Garden actors. This part includes some genuine praise, including that of Mary Wilford (later Mary Bulkley) &quot;blest with a person wholly without fault.&quot; In 1767, he published &quot;Memoirs of a Magdalen&quot; a novel which enjoyed considerable success. The William Kenrick play &quot;The Widowed Wife&quot;, staged the same year, was largely based on it.

===False Delicacy===

His first play, the comedy &quot;False Delicacy&quot;, written in prose, was produced by Garrick at Drury Lane on 23 January 1768, with the intention of rivalling Oliver Goldsmith&#x27;s &quot;The Good-Natur&#x27;d Man&quot; which it successfully did. It is a moral and sentimental comedy, described by Garrick in the prologue as a sermon preached in act. Although Samuel Johnson described it as totally void of character, it was very popular. It was translated into several languages and its French and Portuguese versions drew crowded houses in Paris and Lisbon.

===Journalism and politics===
Kelly was a journalist in the pay of Lord North, and therefore hated by the supporters of the radical journalist and politician John Wilkes, especially as being the editor of &quot;The Public Ledger&quot;. His &quot;Thespis&quot; had also made him many enemies; and Kitty Clive refused to act in his pieces.

===Further plays===
The production of his second comedy, &quot;A Word to the Wise&quot; (Drury Lane, 3 March 1770), occasioned a riot in the theatre, repeated at the second performance, and the piece had to be abandoned. There was still ill-feeling regarding Kelly&#x27;s defence of the government using force against Wilkes&#x27; followers during a recent clash at St George&#x27;s Field.

His other plays are: &quot;Clementina&quot; (Covent Garden, 23 February 1771), a blank verse tragedy, given out to be the work of a young American clergyman in order to escape the opposition of the Wilkites; his successful &quot;The School for Wives&quot; (Drury Lane, 11 December 1773), a prose comedy given out as the work of Major (afterwards Sir William) Addington; a two-act piece, &quot;The Romance of an Hour&quot; (Covent Garden, 2 December 1774), borrowed from Marmontel&#x27;s tale &quot;L&#x27;amitié à l&#x27;épreuve&quot;; and an unsuccessful comedy, &quot;The Man of Reason&quot; (Covent Garden, 9 February 1776).

==Lawyer==
He was called to the bar at the Middle Temple in 1774, and determined to give up literature. He failed in his new profession and died in poverty.

<text>USS &quot;Chandler&quot; (DD-206/DMS-9/AG-108) was a in the United States Navy. She was the only ship named for William Eaton Chandler, who served as Secretary of the Navy from 1882 to 1886.

==Construction and commissioning==
&quot;Chandler&quot; was launched on 19 March 1919 by William Cramp and Sons Ship and Engine Building Company; sponsored by Mrs. L. H. Chandler; and commissioned on 5 September 1919.

==Service history==

===1920s===
Assigned to Destroyer Squadron 3 of the United States Atlantic Fleet, &quot;Chandler&quot; departed Newport, Rhode Island, on 19 December 1919 for duty with U.S. Naval Forces, Turkey. After carrying a diplomatic mission to the Crimea and aiding the American Red Cross in its relief work with Russian refugees, &quot;Chandler&quot; joined the U.S. Naval Detachment, Adriatic. She served as station ship at Venice, Italy, and had relief duty throughout the Adriatic Sea until January 1921.

Passing through the Suez Canal, &quot;Chandler&quot; arrived at Cavite in the Philippines on 15 February 1921. She served with the Asiatic Fleet, protecting American interests in the Far East, until 25 August 1922. Clearing Chefoo, China, that day, she arrived at San Francisco, California, on 30 September 1922. She was decommissioned on 20 October 1922 and placed in reserve at Mare Island Navy Yard in California.

===1930s===
&quot;Chandler&quot; was recommissioned on 31 March 1930 for operations off the United States West Coast, in Hawaii, off the Panama Canal Zone, and in the Caribbean. In 1934, she steamed to New York City for the Presidential Fleet Review of 31 May 1934. In 1936 she took part in radio sound tests, and in 1940 she served as plane guard during the flight of the United States Secretary of the Navy to Hawaii.

Arriving to the Mare Island Navy Yard in California in October 1940, Chandler was converted there into a destroyer minesweeper, and was reclassified DMS-9 on 19 November 1940. As part of her conversion, her number 4 boiler, her fourth funnel, and her torpedo tubes were removed, her depth charge racks were repositioned forward from the stern and angled outboard, and her stern was modified to support minesweeping gear, including davits, a winch, paravanes, and kites. Two 60-kilowatt turbo generators replaced the three original 25-kilowatt electric generators to improve her capability for sweeping magnetic and acoustic mines.

&quot;Chandler&quot; arrived at Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, on 12 February 1941 to begin operational training and patrol.

===World War II===
====Pearl Harbor, 1941====
&quot;Chandler&quot; was at sea on 7 December 1941 when the Japanese attacked Pearl Harbor. She returned to her devastated base on 9 December 1941. Until 30 June 1942, she escorted convoys to San Francisco, Palmyra Atoll, Christmas Island, and Midway Atoll, and swept and patrolled in Hawaiian waters.

====Aleutians, 1942-3====
While en route to operations in the Aleutian Islands on 27 July 1942, &quot;Chandler&quot; collided with the destroyer minesweeper in a heavy fog. She underwent repairs from 11 August to 27 September 1942 at Mare Island Navy Yard. On 5 October 1942, she arrived at Dutch Harbor in the Aleutians for patrol and convoy escort duty in the Aleutians. In May 1943, she covered the amphibious landings at Attu, and in August 1943 the landings at Kiska. Leaving the Aleutians in October 1943, &quot;Chandler&quot; was readied at San Francisco for duty farther south in the Pacific.

====Marshalls and Marianas, 1944====
&quot;Chandler&quot; docked at Pearl Harbor on 1 January 1944. From there, in a succession of landings, at Majuro (31 January), Eniwetok (17 February–6 March), Saipan (13 June–20 July), and Tinian (21 July–24 July), she swept mines and screened assault shipping. At Eniwetok Atoll, she shared responsibilities with the minesweeper &quot;USS Zane&quot; in sweeping mines from two critical approaches into the atoll, Deep Entrance and Wide Passage, which was swept of mines between 700 and 900 on the morning of 17 February 1944. Patrolling each invasion area as the operation developed, &quot;Chandler&quot; joined with in sinking the on 22 June, at 15°55′N., 147°09′E.*

====Leyte Gulf, 1944====

On 17 October 1944, &quot;Chandler&quot; resumed mine-sweeping in landings, as she sailed into Leyte Gulf, Philippines, in advance of the major force for the assault to sweep a path for the attacking amphibious ships. At 637 on 18 October, Commander W. R. Loud, in charge of the minesweeping ships, gave word that only one fifth of the mines in the critical channel between Honophon and Dinagat Islands had been swept. The channel between the two islands was the path the 700 ship allied convoy would take to the North and South landing areas on Leyte Island, and had to be safe and secured. Though 26 moored mines had been swept, many more remained floating in the Gulf. Three Destroyer/Minesweepers including the &quot;Chandler&quot;, continued to sweep the mine fields in the channel between Honophon and Dinagat until it was fully cleared. &quot;Chandler&quot; was also likely tasked with sweeping the approaches to Dinagat Island where Allied ships would enter the Philippines, Looc Bay off Dinagat, and the approaches to the Northeastern coastal towns of Tacloban and Dulag on Leyte Island, which would become the two primary landing areas for Allied transports involved in the invasion of Leyte Gulf.

While near Dulag on Leyte Island, &quot;Chandler&quot; was visited by native Guerillas from the Philippine Island of Samar, immediately North of Leyte, who brought a message from their commander Lt. Colonel Juan Causing. In September, Causing had tried to unite two of the largest Philippine resistance groups on Samar, one commanded by Col. Pedro V. Merritt, P.A., who was established in the north, and the other by Manuel Valley, an escapee from Bataan, who led an organization in the South. An attempt to unite these two leaders was unsuccessful, and though much good work was done by the resistance fighters, little was completed to aid the plans of General MacArthur&#x27;s headquarters until after the assault at Leyte Island was completed. &quot;Chandler&quot; remained on duty, sweeping, patrolling, and screening, through the start of the landings, retiring on 25 October for Manus, Papua, New Guinea, after the delay caused by the Battles for Leyte Gulf, which consisted of several battles East of the large Island of Leyte.

====Lingayen Gulf, 1945====

During the Philippine&#x27;s Lingayen operation, mine sweeping commenced on 6 January 1945 around 700, with kamikaze attacks at their worst. Task force commander Admiral Jesse B. Oldendorf had anticipated word of heavy mine fields and significant obstacles on the beaches. Unexpectedly, exploratory sweeps during the morning of 6 January, revealed only two floating mines and no moored mines. When the sweepers completed their task on 8 January, a total of only four mines had been recovered. Information from Lt. Commander W. R. Loud indicated as many as ten mines may have been removed by the sweepers by end of day on 7 January, but though it was one of the most dangerous operations for converted Clemson Class destroyer minesweepers of the war, relatively few mines were found in Lingayen Gulf and only one additional mine on the beaches.

=====Rescue of the &quot;Hovey&quot;=====
In the early morning of 7 January 1945 at 430, &quot;Chandler&quot; detected low flying planes on her radar, and soon came under heavy fire from Japanese aircraft. Sighting accurately in the moonlit night, fire from &quot;Chandler&quot; and , shot down a Japanese aircraft which had been set aflame, that crashed off Hovey&#x27;s starboard beam. A second low flying aircraft had launched a torpedo, which struck &quot;Hovey&quot; on her starboard side in the after engine room around 0455, at the instant the burning plane crashed. The resultant flooding broke the ship in half and sunk her within three minutes. The explosion took 22 of her own crew and 24 survivors of &quot;Long&quot; and &quot;Brooks&quot; which &quot;Hovey&quot; had rescued on 6 January. &quot;Chandler&quot; stood by, recovering 229 officers and men from the &quot;Hovey&quot; which included survivors of the two ships the &quot;Hovey&quot; had rescued. The rescue was particularly memorable as around half of the survivors recovered by the &quot;Chandler&quot; had been twice rescued from sinking or abandoned ships. Among &quot;Hovey&#x27;s&quot; survivors was flag Commander Wayne Rowe Loud, in charge of the minesweeping task force, who would be awarded the Navy Cross for his rescues, and indomitable spirit inspiring the sweepers to complete their mission though under continuous enemy fire.
 &quot;Chandler&quot; remained on duty in Lingayen Gulf until 10 January, when she cleared for convoy escort operations through mid-February.

====Iwo Jima, 1945====
At Iwo Jima from 16 to 28 February, she gave her experienced aid in sweeping, patrolling, and screening for the buildup and the subsequent assault. Though there was damage to many vessels and smaller sweepers from shore batteries, damage to destroyer minesweepers at Iwo did not occur, as screening battleships and destroyers stayed closer to the sweepers, and the beach areas swept were smaller than those in the Philippine Island chain. As Samuel Morison noted, &quot;Bombardment ships were in position off Iwo by 7:00. Minesweeping began promptly&quot;. Though many American vessels were damaged at Iwo Jima, it was placed first before Okinawa and was expected to be a less costly battle. This proved to be the case, particularly for the Navy&#x27;s Destroyer/Minesweepers.

==Fate==

&quot;Chandler&quot; returned to the west coast for overhaul in April. While there, she was reclassified AG-108, on 5 June 1945, and after training, she began a tour of towing targets in gunnery exercises for new ships engaged in shakedown training. While performing this important task, she based on both San Diego and Pearl Harbor. After the end of hostilities, &quot;Chandler&quot; proceeded to Norfolk, Virginia, arriving on 21 October 1945. There she was decommissioned on 21 November 1945, and sold on 18 November 1946.

==Awards==
&quot;Chandler&quot; received eight battle stars for service in World War II.

<text>György Fejér (, ) (April 23, 1766 – July 2, 1851) was a Hungarian author, Provost – Canon, and Director of the Library, was born at Keszthely, in the county of Zala in Hungary.

He studied philosophy at Pest, and theology at Pressburg. In 1808, he obtained a theological professorship at Pest University. In 1818, he became chief director of the educational circle of Győr (: Raab), and in 1824 was appointed librarian to the University of Pest. Fejér&#x27;s works, which are nearly all written either in Latin or Hungarian, exceed one hundred and eighty.

His most important work, &quot;Codex diplomaticus Hungariae ecclesiasticus no civilis,&quot; was published in several volumes from 1829 to 1844. It consists of old documents and charters from 104 to the end of 1439, and forms an extraordinary monument of patient industry. This work and many others relating to Hungarian national history have placed Fejér in the foremost rank of Hungarian historians.

His later works were &quot;A Kunok eredete&quot; (&quot;The Origin of the Cumans&quot;), and &quot;A politikai forradalmak okai&quot; (&quot;The Causes of Political Revolutions&quot;), both published in 1850. The latter production, on account of its liberal tendencies, was suppressed by the Austrian government.

<text>Dionisio Aguado y García (8 April 178429 December 1849) was a Spanish classical guitarist and composer of the late Classical and early Romantic periods.

==Biography==
Born in Madrid, he studied with Miguel García. In 1826, Aguado visited Paris, where he met and became friends with and for a while lived with Fernando Sor. Sor&#x27;s duo &quot;Les Deux Amis&quot; (&quot;The Two Friends&quot;) commemorated the friendship: one part is marked &quot;Sor&quot; and the other &quot;Aguado.&quot;

Aguado&#x27;s major work &quot;Nuevo Metodo Para Guitarra&quot; was a guitar tutorial published in 1843. As of 2011, it is still in print, with Tecla Editions releasing a reprint in 2005. In the &quot;Nuevo Metodo&quot; Aguado describes his use of fingernails on the right hand as well as his invention of a &quot;tripodison&quot;: a device that held the guitar and thus minimized the damping effect of the player&#x27;s body on the guitar&#x27;s back and sides. Aguado&#x27;s other works include numerous waltzes, minuets, and other light pieces. The more extended works require a virtuoso technique and left-hand stretches that are almost impossible on the longer string lengths of modern guitars. (See Frederick Noad, &quot;The Classical Guitar&quot;)

Aguado returned home to Madrid in 1837 and died there aged 65.

Aguado&#x27;s surname comes from the Spanish word for &quot;soaked.&quot; (This is because an ancient relative of his, who was a knight, returned after a battle caked in mud. The nickname then eventually became the surname.)

==Instruments used by Aguado y García==
Of the instruments used by Aguado, two which were built by
*Pierre René Lacôte, (Paris 1838) and
*Etienne Laprevotte, (Paris 1838)
are held at the Museo Arqueológico Nacional in Madrid.
Aguado is known for having used a tripod to support his guitar.

<doc id="755515" wikidata="Q1590822" url="?curid=755515" title="Preston Brooks">
<text>Preston Smith Brooks (August 5, 1819 – January 27, 1857) was an American planter, politician, and member of the U.S. House of Representatives from South Carolina, serving from 1853 until his resignation in July 1856 and again from August 1856 until his death. An adamant defender of slavery, Brooks is best known for beating abolitionist Senator Charles Sumner with a cane in 1856, which caused his initial resignation until he was re-elected immediately after the incident.

A member of the Democratic Party, Brooks was a strong advocate of slavery and states&#x27; rights to enforce slavery nationally. He is most remembered for his May 22, 1856, attack upon abolitionist and Republican Senator Charles Sumner, whom he beat nearly to death; Brooks beat Sumner with a cane on the floor of the United States Senate in retaliation for an anti-slavery speech in which Sumner verbally attacked Brooks&#x27;s first cousin once removed, South Carolina Senator Andrew Butler.

Brooks&#x27; beating seriously injured Sumner, and he was unable to resume his seat in the Senate for three years, though eventually he recovered and resumed his Senate career. The Massachusetts Legislature reelected Sumner in 1856, &quot;and let his seat sit vacant during his absence as a reminder of Southern brutality&quot;.

An attempt to oust Brooks from the House of Representatives failed, and he received only token punishment in his criminal trial. He resigned his seat in July 1856 to allow his constituents to express their view on his conduct; they reelected him in the August special election to fill the vacancy created by his resignation. He was reelected to a full term in November 1856, but died in January 1857, five weeks before the new term began in March.

As described by historian Stephen Puleo, &quot;The caning had an enormous impact on the events that followed over the next four years... As a result of the caning, the country was pushed, inexorably and unstoppably, to civil war.&quot;

==Early life==
Brooks was born in Edgefield County, South Carolina, on August 5, 1819, the son of Whitfield Brooks and Mary Parsons Carroll Brooks. Of English descent, his great-great-grandfather John Brooks was the first in the Brooks family present in the Americas, settling in the Province of North Carolina from England around the early 18th-century.

He attended South Carolina College (now known as the University of South Carolina) but was expelled just before graduation for threatening local police officers with firearms. After leaving college, he studied law, attained admission to the bar, and practiced in Edgefield.

In addition to practicing law, Brooks owned a plantation located in Cambridge, between Edgefield and Ninety-Six. In 1840, Brooks fought a duel with future Texas Senator Louis T. Wigfall and was shot in the hip, forcing him to use a walking cane for the rest of his life. He was admitted to the Bar in 1845. Brooks served in the Mexican–American War as Captain of Company D of the Palmetto Regiment. &quot;South Carolina in the Mexican War&quot; notes the service of both Brooks and 4th Corporal Carey Wentworth Styles (who later founded &quot;The Atlanta Constitution&quot;) in Co. D, the &quot;Old 96 Boys&quot; of the Edgefield District.

==Family==
Brooks&#x27; first wife was Caroline Harper Means (1820–1843). They had one child, Whitfield D. Brooks, who was born in 1843 and died that same year. Brooks was widowed upon Caroline&#x27;s death.

His second wife was Martha Caroline Means (1826–1901), his first wife&#x27;s cousin. They had three children, Caroline Harper Brooks (1849–1924), Rosa Brooks (1849–1933), and Preston Smith Brooks (1854–1928). Martha outlived her husband.

==Political career==
Brooks was a member of the South Carolina House of Representatives in 1844. Brooks was elected to the 33rd United States Congress in 1853 as a Democrat. Like his fellow South Carolina Representatives and Senators, Brooks took an extreme pro-slavery position, asserting that the enslavement of Black people by whites was right and proper, that any attack or restriction on slavery was an attack on the rights and the social structure of the South.

During Brooks&#x27; service as representative, there was great controversy over slavery in the Kansas Territory and whether Kansas would be admitted as a free or slavery state. He supported actions by pro-slavery men from Missouri to make Kansas a slave territory. In March 1856, Brooks wrote: &quot;The fate of the South is to be decided with the Kansas issue. If Kansas becomes a hireling [i.e., free] state, slave property will decline to half its present value in Missouri ... [and] abolitionism will become the prevailing sentiment. So with Arkansas; so with upper Texas.&quot;

==Sumner assault==

On May 20, 1856, Senator Charles Sumner made a speech denouncing &quot;The Crime Against Kansas&quot; and the Southern leaders whom he regarded as complicit, including Brooks&#x27;s first cousin once removed, Senator Andrew Butler. Sumner compared Butler with Don Quixote for embracing a prostitute (slavery) as his mistress, saying Butler &quot;believes himself a chivalrous knight&quot;.
Senator Stephen Douglas of Illinois, who was also a subject of criticism during the speech, suggested to a colleague while Sumner was orating that &quot;this damn fool [Sumner] is going to get himself shot by some other damn fool.&quot;

Sumner&#x27;s language was intentionally inflammatory; Southerners often claimed that abolition would lead to intermarriage, arguing that abolitionists opposed slavery because they wanted to have sex with and marry black women. Abolitionists reversed the argument by accusing Southerners of supporting slavery so they could make sexual use of slave women. As Hoffer (2010) says, &quot;It is also important to note the sexual imagery that recurred throughout the oration, which was neither accidental nor without precedent. Abolitionists routinely accused slaveholders of maintaining slavery so that they could engage in forcible sexual relations with their slaves.&quot;
Brooks thought of challenging Sumner to a duel. He consulted with Representative Laurence M. Keitt (also a South Carolina Democrat) on dueling etiquette. Keitt said that dueling was for gentlemen of equal social standing. In his view, Sumner was no gentleman, no better than a drunkard due to his supposedly coarse and insulting language toward Butler. Brooks then decided to &quot;punish&quot; Sumner with a public beating.

On May 22, two days after Sumner&#x27;s speech, Brooks entered the Senate chamber in company with Keitt. Also with him was Representative Henry A. Edmundson (Democrat-Virginia), a personal friend with his own history of legislative violence. In May 1854, Edmundson had been arrested by the House Sergeant at Arms after attempting to attack Representative Lewis D. Campbell of Ohio during a tense debate on the House floor.
Brooks confronted Sumner, who was seated at his desk, writing letters. He said, &quot;Mr. Sumner, I have read your speech twice over carefully. It is a libel on South Carolina, and Mr. Butler, who is a relative of mine.&quot; As Sumner began to stand up, Brooks hit Sumner over the head several times with his cane, made of thick gutta-percha with a gold head. Sumner was trapped under the heavy desk (which was bolted to the floor), but Brooks continued to strike Sumner until Sumner wrenched the desk from the floor in an attempt to escape. By this time, Sumner was blinded by his own blood. He staggered up the aisle and collapsed unconscious. Senator John J. Crittenden, Representative Ambrose Murray (R-NY), and others attempted to restrain Brooks before he killed Sumner but were blocked by Keitt, who brandished a pistol and shouted at the onlookers to leave Brooks and Sumner alone. Brooks continued beating Sumner until the cane broke, then quietly left the chamber with Keitt and Edmundson. Brooks required medical attention before leaving the Capitol, because he had hit himself above his right eye with one of his backswings.

Sumner suffered head trauma that would cause him chronic pain and symptoms consistent with what would now be called traumatic brain injury and post-traumatic stress disorder, and spent three years convalescing before returning to his Senate seat. He suffered chronic pain and debilitation for the rest of his life.

==After the attack==

The national reaction to Brooks&#x27; attack was sharply divided along regional lines. In Congress, members in both houses armed themselves when they ventured onto the floor. At no time, between the incident and his death, did Brooks apologize for the attack. In his speech to the House of Representatives announcing his resignation on June 14, 1856, Brooks insisted that he had behaved honorably and condemned any efforts to censure or punish him for his behavior.
Brooks was widely cheered across the South, where his attack on Sumner was considered legitimate and socially justifiable. South Carolinians sent Brooks dozens of new canes, with one bearing the phrase, &quot;Good job&quot;; another cane was inscribed &quot;Hit him again.&quot; The &quot;Richmond Enquirer&quot; wrote: &quot;We consider the act good in conception, better in execution, and best of all in consequences. These vulgar abolitionists in the Senate must be lashed into submission.&quot; The University of Virginia&#x27;s Jefferson Literary and Debating Society sent a new gold-headed cane to replace Brooks&#x27; broken one. Southern lawmakers made rings out of the original cane&#x27;s remains, which they wore on neck chains to show their solidarity with Brooks.

In contrast, Northerners, even those previously opposed to Sumner&#x27;s extreme abolitionist invective, were universally shocked by Brooks&#x27; violence. Anti-slavery men cited it as evidence that the South had lost interest in national debate, and now relied on violence to express themselves. John L. Magee (artist)&#x27;s political cartoon famously expressed the general Northern sentiment that the South&#x27;s vaunted chivalry had degenerated into &quot;Argument versus Clubs&quot;.

American Party Congressman Anson Burlingame publicly humiliated Brooks in retaliation by goading Brooks into challenging him to a duel, accepting, and then watching Brooks back out. After Burlingame made provocative remarks, Brooks challenged Burlingame, stating he would gladly face him in any &quot;Yankee mudsill&quot; of his choosing. Burlingame, a well-known marksman, eagerly accepted, choosing rifles as the weapons and the Navy Yards in the border town of Niagara Falls, Canada, as the location to circumvent the U.S. ban on dueling. Brooks, reportedly dismayed by both Burlingame&#x27;s enthusiastic acceptance and reputation as a crack shot, backed out by citing unspecified risks to his safety if he was to cross &quot;hostile country&quot; (the Northern states) to reach Canada.

Brooks claimed that he &quot;meant no disrespect to the Senate of the United States&quot; by attacking Sumner, and also that he had not intended to kill Sumner, or else he would have used a different weapon. Brooks was tried in a District of Columbia court for the attack. He was convicted of assault and was fined $300, though he was not incarcerated.

A motion to expel Brooks from the House failed, but he resigned on July 15 to allow his constituents to ratify or condemn his conduct. They approved, returning him to office in the special election held on August 1 and then electing him to a new term in November 1856.

==Death==
Brooks died unexpectedly from a violent attack of croup on January 27, 1857, a few weeks before the March 4 start of the new congressional term to which he had been elected. He was buried in Edgefield, South Carolina. The official telegram announcing his death stated &quot;He died a horrid death, and suffered intensely. He endeavored to tear his own throat open to get breath.&quot; Despite terrible weather, thousands went to the Capitol to attend memorial services. After his body was transported back to Edgefield, another large crowd took part in funeral ceremonies before he was buried.

==Legacy==
The city of Brooksville, Florida (created from the merger of the towns of Melendez and Pierceville), and Brooks County, Georgia, are named after Brooks, as was present-day Big Bend, West Virginia which was previously known as Brooksville, Virginia. All were named shortly after his caning of Sumner.

Preston Brooks was portrayed by Johnny Knoxville in the 2014 &quot;Charleston&quot; episode of the TV series Drunk History. Patton Oswalt played Charles Sumner, and an inebriated Seth Weitberg told the story.

<text>The Senate Republican Conference is the formal organization of the Republican senators in the United States Senate. Over the last century, the mission of the conference has expanded and been shaped as a means of informing the media of the opinions and activities of Senate Republicans. The Senate Republican Conference assists Republican senators by providing a full range of communications services including graphics, radio, television, and the Internet. Its chairman is Senator Tom Cotton, and its vice chairman is Senator James Lankford.

==Conference hierarchy==
Effective , the conference leadership is:

*John Thune (SD) as Senate Majority Leader 
*John Barrasso (WY) as Senate Majority Whip
*Tom Cotton (AR) as Chairman of the Republican Conference
*Shelley Moore Capito (WV) as Chairwoman of the Senate Republican Policy Committee
*James Lankford (OK) as Vice Chairman of the Senate Republican Conference
*Tim Scott (SC) as Chairman of the National Republican Senatorial Committee
*Mike Lee (UT) as Chairman of the Senate Republican Steering Committee
*Mike Crapo (ID) as Senate Republican Chief Deputy Whip
*Chuck Grassley (IA) as President pro tempore

==History==
The Republican Conference of the United States Senate is a descendant of the early American party caucus that decided party policies, approved appointees, and selected candidates. The meetings were private, and early records of the deliberations do not exist. Senate Republicans began taking formal minutes only in 1911, and they began referring to their organization as the &quot;conference&quot; in 1913. An early outgrowth of the effort to enhance party unity was the creation, in 1874, of a steering committee to prepare a legislative schedule for consideration by the conference. The committee became a permanent part of the Republican organization.

The steering committee, formalized Republican &quot;leadership&quot; in the 19th century was minimal; most legislative guidance came from powerful committee chairmen managing particular bills. The conference began to acquire significance, however, with the election of Senator William B. Allison of Iowa as chairman in 1897, and during the terms of successors such as Senator Orville H. Platt of Connecticut and Senator Nelson W. Aldrich of Rhode Island. The chairman in 1915, Senator Jacob H. Gallinger of New Hampshire, who two years earlier had elected a whip to maintain a quorum to conduct Senate business. Senator James W. Wadsworth, Jr. of New York was elected both conference secretary and whip; a week later the responsibilities were divided between Senator Wadsworth as Secretary and Senator Charles Curtis of Kansas, who was elected whip.

The conference continued to meet in private to assure confidentiality and candor. This practice was suspended only once, on May 27, 1919, when the conference reaffirmed its commitment to the seniority system for choosing committee chairmen by electing Senator Boies Penrose of Pennsylvania as chairman of the finance committee over objections from Progressive Republican insurgents. (This was apparently the only open party conference in the history of the Senate.)

During this period, the chairman also served as informal floor leader. One reason for the lack of a formal post was that committee chairmen usually took responsibility to move to proceed to the consideration of measures reported by their respective committees and managed the legislation on the floor. The first recorded Conference election of a formal floor leader was held March 5, 1925, when the conference chairman, Senator Curtis of Kansas, was unanimously chosen to serve in both posts.

Throughout the 1920s, when Republicans held the Senate majority, the conference met chiefly at the beginning of each session to make committee assignments; for the remainder of the session, Members were notified of the order of business by mail. This slow pace continued through the 1930s, when Republican senators were so few that they dispensed with a permanent whip, and the conference chairman and floor leader, Senator Charles L. McNary of Oregon, appointed senators to serve as whip on particular pieces of legislation.

Senator McNary died in 1944, and the posts of conference chairman and floor leader were separated in 1945. Senator Arthur H. Vandenberg of Michigan became chairman and Senator Wallace H. White, Jr., of Maine became floor leader. This separation has continued to be one of the chief differences between the Republican and Democratic Conferences, since the floor leader of the Democrats has continued to serve as their conference chairman.

In 1944, Senator Robert A. Taft of Ohio, still in his first term, persuaded Republicans to revive their steering committee, and he became its chairman. In 1946, it became the Republican Policy Committee under legislation appropriating equal funds for majority and minority parties (a separate steering committee was created in 1974 but its operations are funded by member dues, not by Congress). Until the mid-1970s the staffs of the Conference and Policy Committee were housed together under a single staff director who administered their budgets jointly. Staff separation was begun during 1979–1980, while Senator Bob Packwood of Oregon was chairman of the conference, and completed under Senator James McClure of Idaho. Under Senator McClure&#x27;s leadership in the 1980s, the conference began providing television, radio and graphics services for Republican senators. Senator Connie Mack, as conference chairman, in 1997 created the first digital Information Technology department to communicate the Republican agenda over the web.

== Meetings of Republican Conference ==
The form and frequency of conference meetings has depended upon leadership personalities and legislative circumstances. Since the late 1950s, the conference has met at the beginning of each United States Congress to elect the leadership, approve committee assignments, and attend to other organizational matters. Although other meetings are called from time to time to discuss pending issues, the weekly Policy Committee luncheons afford a regular forum for discussion among senators. As a former Republican Leader, Senator Everett M. Dirksen of Illinois, said in 1959:

:When the Republican Policy Committee meets weekly, it is actually a meeting of the Republican Conference over the luncheon table, at which time we discuss all matters of pending business. Thus, so far as possible, all the information which is within the possession and the command of the leadership is freely diffused to every member.

At the time Senator Dirksen spoke, the elected party leadership included: chairman of the conference, secretary of the conference, floor leader, whip (now assistant floor leader), and chairman of the Policy Committee. On July 31, 1980, Conference rules were amended to make the chairman of the National Republican Senatorial Committee an elected position, a change which brought the rules into conformity with what had become custom.

== &quot;Conference&quot; versus &quot;caucus&quot; ==
The Republican Conference has never been a caucus in the dictionary sense, that is, a &quot;partisan legislative group that uses caucus procedures to make decisions binding on its members.&quot; Even during the tense years of Reconstruction, Republican senators were not bound to vote according to conference decisions. In 1867, for example, when Senator Charles Sumner of Massachusetts refused to follow conference policy on an issue, and Senator William P. Fessenden of Maine charged, &quot;you should not have voted on the subject [in Conference] if you did not mean to be bound by the decision of the majority,&quot; Sumner retorted, &quot;I am a Senator of the United States,&quot; and no attempt was made to discipline him. Such independence was reiterated on March 12, 1925, when a resolution introduced by Senator Wesley L. Jones of Washington passed in the conference without objection:

:To make clear and beyond question the long-settled policy of Republicans that our Conferences are not caucuses or of binding effect upon those participating therein but are meetings solely for the purpose of exchanging views to promote harmony and united action so far as possible.

:Be It Resolved: That no Senator attending this Conference or any Conference held hereafter shall be deemed to be bound in any way by any action taken by such Conference, but he shall be entirely free to act upon any matter considered by the Conference as his judgment may dictate, and it shall not be necessary for any Senator to give notice of his intention to take action different from any recommended by the Conference.&quot;

==Floor leaders==
==List of conference chairmen and chairwomen==
The Republican conference of the United States Senate chooses a conference chairperson. The office was created in the mid-19th century with the founding of the Republican party. The office of &quot;party floor leader&quot; was not created until 1925, and for twenty years, the Senate&#x27;s Republican conference chairman was also the floor leader.

In recent years, the conference chair has come to be regarded as the third-ranking Republican in the Senate, behind the floor leader and whip. According to &quot;Congressional Quarterly&quot;, &quot;The conference chairman manages the private meetings to elect floor leaders, handles distribution of committee assignments and helps set legislative priorities. The modern version drives the conference’s message, with broadcast studios for television and radio.&quot;
==List of secretaries and vice chairmen==
The vice chair of the Senate Republican Conference, also known previously as the conference secretary until 2001, is the fifth-ranking leadership position (behind the Policy Committee chair) within the Republican Party conference in the United States Senate. The vice-chair/secretary is responsible for keeping the minutes of the Senate Republican Conference and serves alongside the Senate Republican Conference chairperson. The vice chairman is James Lankford, serving since 2025.

<text>Alfonso López Pumarejo (31 January 1886 – 20 November 1959) was a Colombian political figure, who twice served as President of Colombia, as a member of the Colombian Liberal Party. He served as President of Colombia from 1934 to 1938 and again from 1942 to 1946.

==Biography==
Alfonso López Pumarejo was born in Honda (Tolima) to Pedro Aquilino López Medina, a businessman and Rosario Pumarejo Cotes. Alfonso López Pumarejo went on to study at the London School of Economics. His son, Alfonso López Michelsen, was president of Colombia between 1974 and 1978. 

The first administration of Alfonso López Pumarejo (1934-8) known as the &quot;revolución en marcha&quot;, has proven an enduring theme of historical interest.

He was elected president in 1934 almost unopposed, and as the second participant of the so-called Liberal Hegemony in Colombia, his initial government platform became known under the name &quot;Revolución en Marcha&quot; (Marching Revolution), as it attempted to implement far reaching social and political reforms. Several radical changes were promoted during his first administration, as the government supported the creation of labour unions and also passed the Law 200 of 1936, which allowed for the expropriation of private properties, in order to promote &quot;social interest&quot;.

These actions earned López Pumarejo the backing of important rural and labour sectors, in addition to that of the Colombian Communist Party, but they likewise divided his previous political allies, some of which called for moderation. The election of his successor Eduardo Santos Montejo took place in 1938.

After being re-elected in 1942, the second administration of López Pumarejo faced a stronger opposition in Congress and by both the more conservative and more radical sectors within the president&#x27;s own Colombian Liberal Party which resulted in the interruption of previous reforms.

When Colombia joined the Allies in declaring war against the Axis powers in July 1943, López Pumarejo strongly supported the decision and simultaneously declared that the government should take into account that the United States would always place its own interests ahead of anything else, implicitly indicating that these may not necessarily coincide with those of Colombia.

To permit López Pumarejo to travel to the United States and care for his sick wife, María Michelsen de López, Darío Echandía assumed the acting presidency of the country from 17 November 1943 to 16 May 1944. This turn of events also prevented the development of further reforms, as López himself was temporarily removed from the political arena.

After his return to the country, further political conflicts led to a failed military coup attempt in 1944, and López Pumarejo finally resigned in early 1945.

In 1946, he was head of the Colombian delegation to the United Nations.

Alfonso López Pumarejo died on 20 November 1959 in London, to which he had travelled as Colombia&#x27;s ambassador to the United Kingdom. He had lived at 33 Wilton Crescent in Belgravia, Knightsbridge in London with his second wife, Olga Dávila Alzamora. They married in 1953 after both their spouses had died (she had been married to Leopoldo Kopp Castello, son of well-known industrialist Leo Kopp (es), founder of Bavaria Brewery). López&#x27;s body was taken by horse-drawn carriage from his residency to Westminster Cathedral where a funeral mass was held in his name.

<text>Carlos Antonio López Ynsfrán (November 4, 1792 – September 10, 1862) was leader of Paraguay from 1841 to 1862.

==Early life==
López was born at Manorá (Asunción) on November 4, 1792, as one of eight children. He graduated from Real Colegio y Seminario de San Carlos and then began a law practice, a profession which allowed him to develop influential connections. He attracted the hostility of the dictator José Gaspar Rodríguez de Francia, his reputed uncle, which caused him to go into hiding for several years.

==Political career==

López was briefly secretary of the military junta led by Colonel Mariano Roque Alonso that ruled the country from 1840 to 1841, after the death of Francia. On March 12, 1841, Congress chose López and Roque to be joint consuls for three years. In 1844, he exiled Roque and assumed dictatorial powers. A few months later, Congress adopted a new constitution, which changed the head of state&#x27;s title from consul to president and elected López to the new post for a 10-year term. The constitution vested López with powers almost as sweeping as those Francia had held for most of his 26-year rule, effectively codifying the dictatorial powers he had seized just months earlier. The document included no guarantees of civil rights; indeed, the word &quot;liberty&quot; was not even in the text.

He was re-elected for a three-year term in 1854 and again in 1857 for ten more years, with the power to nominate his own successor.

His government was directed towards developing Paraguay&#x27;s primary resource extraction and strengthening Paraguay&#x27;s armed forces. He contracted numerous foreign technicians, most of whom were British, and built up the formidable Fortress of Humaitá.

Before the constitution adopted in 1844 that legitimized López’s presidency, Paraguay had no official document of sovereignty; López’s influence led to the recognition of Paraguay as an independent nation. However, his approach to foreign affairs several times involved him in diplomatic disputes with the Empire of Brazil, the United States, and the British Empire, which nearly resulted in war. 
His government was somewhat more tolerant of opposition than Francia&#x27;s had been. He released all political prisoners soon after he took full power and also took measures to abolish slavery.

During his presidency, Paraguay’s economy saw unprecedented growth. He signed commercial treaties with Brazil in 1850, with Great Britain, France and the United States in 1853, and with and Argentina in 1856. His government worked to improve infrastructure and transportation within the country through the establishment of a new railroad line and steamship river routes. López also encouraged public education through the expansion of primary schools and the reopening of the seminary he attended as a young man, which increased literacy throughout the country.

His eldest son, Francisco Solano López (1827–1870), succeeded him as president after his death. A barrio of Asuncion is named after him.

<text>Nick Duncombe (21 January 1982 – 14 February 2003) was an English rugby union footballer who played for Harlequins and England. Earmarked as a promising youngster since his time in the England youth teams, Duncombe was the England senior team&#x27;s youngest debutant scrum-half at the time of his debut and won two international caps before his death at age 21.

==Biography==
Duncombe attended the Royal Grammar School, High Wycombe, which was renowned for its rugby tradition. At school, he excelled in various sports including cricket and football and began playing for the England national youth teams and England Schoolboys. A neck injury he sustained during an England youth game in 2000 nearly ended his career but he recovered.

==Career==
Duncombe initially played for the Saracens&#x27; youth squads before joining Harlequins. He made his professional debut in 2002.

On 2 February 2002 Clive Woodward gave Duncombe his England début as a half-time replacement for the injured scrum-half Kyran Bracken against Scotland at Murrayfield. Selection came after having played just 270 minutes of senior rugby for Harlequins&#x27; first XV – and just 12 days after his 20th birthday – making him England&#x27;s youngest scrum half of the professional era. He earned his second cap in the next fixture against Ireland on 16 February 2002.

Besides the 15-a-side version, Duncombe also represented England in sevens at the 2002 Commonwealth Games.

==Death==
Duncombe contracted meningitis while on what has erroneously been described as a warm-weather training trip to Spain with his club Harlequins. In reality, it was a short break, to Lanzarote, with his club colleague, Nathan Williams.

Dan Luger, another established England international, was also due to be on the trip with Duncombe, but was called into the England squad to play France at Twickenham.

A statue of Duncombe is displayed at Harlequins Twickenham home, The Stoop. On the front of the statue, the plinth reads: 

Nick Duncombe, 1982–2003. 
Harlequins &amp; England.
&#x27;Carpe Diem&#x27; (Latin for: &#x27;Seize the Day&#x27;).

<text>Francisco Higino Craveiro Lopes (; 12 April 1894 – 2 September 1964) was a Portuguese Air Force officer and politician who served as the 12th president of Portugal from 1951 to 1958.

== Early life and career ==
Born in Lisbon, he was a son of João Carlos Craveiro Lopes, Portuguese army general and 122nd Governor-General of Portuguese India (1929–1936), and his wife Júlia Clotilde Cristiano Salinas.

He concluded his Colégio Militar studies by 1911, having then entered the Escola Politécnica de Lisboa, in the same year he joined a cavalry regiment. He succeeded his father as the 123rd General Governor of Portuguese India (1936–1938).

Lopez served as the commander of the Portuguese volunteer forces during the Spanish Civil War. 
== Presidency ==

Prime Minister António de Oliveira Salazar chose Craveiro Lopes as the regime&#x27;s presidential candidate in 1951 to succeed the late Óscar Carmona. Initially, he was to run in what would have been only the second contested election of the Estado Novo, when naval officer Manuel Quintão Meireles filed to run against him. However, Quintão Meireles withdrew before election day, and Craveiro Lopes was elected unopposed.

Under the Constitution, the president was vested with near-dictatorial powers. In practice, Carmona had mostly turned over the government to Salazar. However, Craveiro Lopes was not willing to give Salazar the free hand that Carmona had given him. Despite this, he did not go as far as to dismiss Salazar; for all intents and purposes, the president&#x27;s power to sack the prime minister was the only check on Salazar&#x27;s power.

Nevertheless, Salazar picked the seemingly more pliant naval minister, Américo Tomás, as the regime&#x27;s candidate in 1958. The Democratic Opposition then invited Craveiro Lopes to be their candidate, but he knew he stood no chance of winning and refused. The regime, however, as compensation promoted him to Marshal. He was involved in the failed military attempt to overthrow Salazar in 1961, led by the Defence Minister Júlio Botelho Moniz.

He died in Lisbon on 2 September 1964.

<doc id="755560" wikidata="Q5581319" url="?curid=755560" title="Gonadarche">
<text>Gonadarche () refers to the earliest gonadal (reproductive gland) changes of puberty. In response to pituitary gonadotropins, the ovaries in females and the testes in males begin to grow and increase the production of the sex steroids, especially estradiol and testosterone. The ovary and testis have receptors, follicle cells and leydig cells, respectively, where gonadotropins bind to stimulate the maturation of the gonads and secretion of estrogen and testosterone. Certain disorders can result in changes to timing or nature of these processes.

* In males, gonadarche is responsible for testicular enlargement and virilization.
* In females, gonadarche is responsible for thelarche and menarche (first menstruation).

Gonadarche should be contrasted with adrenarche. Gonadarche indicates that true central puberty has begun, while adrenarche is an independent maturational process only loosely associated with complete puberty.

== Physiology ==

Puberty is influenced by a multitude of factors including genetic, prenatal, nutritional, and environmental status. Parental pubescent age also influences what age a person starts puberty. Puberty usually begins around ages 10—11 in females and around ages 11—12 in males. Body weight and nutrition status is evidenced to have an effect on puberty onset as well, due to some input from adipose tissue hormonal signaling. Puberty involves both the processes of gonadarche and adrenarche. Adrenarche is responsible for the maturation of the adrenal gland during puberty and stimulates the development of body odor, axillary hair, and acne.

Gonadarche starts off by the macroneurons of the hypothalamus which produce hormone called the gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) which is responsible for the release of the hormones follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH), which are produced by the anterior pituitary.

Gonadarche marks the beginning of puberty and it is the process in which gonads, or the primary reproductive organs, mature, following stimulation of gonadotropin hormone-releasing hormone (GnRH) release in the hypothalamus. The release of GnRH triggers a release of hormones that activate the maturation of the ovary and testis. This release is mediated primarily through action of the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis, a hormonal signaling system active in gestation and fetal development, reactivated around the time of gonadarche to mediate GnRH pulsing release. This, as mentioned above, stimulates FSH and LH release. This activation is also influenced by release of the protein kisspeptin at the time of gonadarche onset. The production of kisspeptin mediates the GnRH pulse release in puberty, but also GnRH activity during fetal development. Prior to onset of gonadarche, stimulation of these hormones from the hypothalamus is suppressed through GABAergic-releasing inhibitory neurons in the central nervous system. Some input of suppression is also linked to secretions of estrogen from immature ovaries in females.

== Sex differences ==
Onset of gonadarche varies between sexes. Average age of onset averages to around eleven years old in males and averages to around nine years old in females.

In females, the first clinical indication of the beginning of adult breast development is thelarche. One in each five females may show signs of pubarche before thelarche. The clinical development across normal puberty is better classified by the Tanner Stages of sexual development for breast and pubic hair. In females, the pubertal growth spurt arise early in puberty due to the direct stimulation of sex steroids and indirectly by the growth hormone-insulin-like growth factor (GH-IGF) axis. Ovulation and follicular functions are stimulated by the gonadotropins released by the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis&#x27; action. Ovarian production of progesterone and estradiol come to adult levels through this process.

In males, gonadarche is determined with testicular volume greater than 3 mL, genital stage greater than or equal to 2, or pubarche, which is defined as pubic hair stage greater than or equal to 2. If testicular volumes of the 2 testes are not equal, the larger testis measurement is used. Similarly in females, if a female has a larger breast stage on one side, this stage is used. Gonadotropins release mediates maturation of seminiferous tubules to be ready to perform spermatogenesis primarily through stimulation of Sertoli cells, while Leydig cells are similarly stimulted to produce adult levels of testosterone.

Hormonal markers of progression of maturation differ between sexes as well. Tracking of AMH and inhibin B levels can be useful in males, as well as gonadotropin and androgen levels earlier on in puberty. Females also have stable AMH levels, with gonadotropin levels being useful markers longer from between 8 and 4 times as long compared to as in males.

== Disorders ==

=== Central Precocious Puberty [CPP] / Progressive Precocious Gonadarche ===
The disorder Central Precocious Puberty (CPP) is also known as Progressive Precocious Gonadarche or GnRH-dependent precocious puberty, and it occurs when a child&#x27;s body initiates puberty earlier than what is normally observed. Individuals with CPP will often experience an early growth spurt because their bones are maturing faster than usual. However, since their growth plates will often close earlier and without proper treatment, children with CPP may not reach their predicted adult height.

CPP is caused by premature activation or incompletely suppressed hypothalamic GnRH(gonadotropin-releasing hormone) pulse generator. The GnRH pulse generator is a control center in the body that regulates the release of two important hormones, LH (Luteinizing hormone) and FSH (follicle stimulating hormone), hormones crucial in fertility.

Children with this condition undergo the typical stages of puberty, including the early development of reproductive organs, at younger ages than usual. This is a rare condition with an estimated incidence of about 0.02 to 1.07 cases per million each year based on data collected from 2008 to 2010 in Spain.

CPP is seen more often in young females than males, possibly due to females having less suppression of this pulse generator before puberty. Around 90% of cases are considered to have no identifiable cause in females, while in males, 50% to 70% of cases can be linked to an identifiable cause. Some cases of CPP are associated with specific gene mutations related to GnRH and gonadotropin secretion.

Preferred treatment for CPP is a GnRH receptor agonist. These medications are modified variations of natural GnRH. They are degraded at a slower rate than native GnRH and have a stronger effect on GnRH receptors. This results in continuous GnRH stimulation in the pitutitary, which slows down the production of more GnRH, decreasing gonadotropin secretion. These GnRH receptor agonists are available in the US as daily injections or less frequent depot forms, given every 28 days.

When treating children with CPP, the main goal is to preserve adult height. When trying to preserve adult height it is important to keep a few precautions in mind. During treatment, there is a significant amount of variation in height gained, as it is closely related to the age at which treatment is started. This variation is especially seen in females. Additionally, height outcomes are usually calculated based on the difference between projected adult height, the height recorded at the beginning of treatment, and at the end of treatment. This approach is controversial, as there are frequent overestimations when heights are projected in children with CPP. As a result, health professionals are rarely able to accurately predict the hight outcome of people with CPP.

Psychological distress in relation to early puberty is a concern for many, and some have considered stopping puberty in children with CPP as a means to addressing this issue. Some reports have illustrated poorer psychological outcomes in children with CPP or early menarche. However, there are other studies that counter act this claim and find no difference in the psychological outcomes in gris with CPP.

=== Constitutional Delay in Growth and Puberty (CDGP) ===
CDGP is a conditions characterized by an extreme variation from the normal timing of puberty. Both gonadarche and adrenarche are delayed in this case, resulting in some children developing later than others. There is a delay in the development of the reproductive organs and adrenal glands seen in children with CDGP. Individuals with CDGP usually will display decreased growth velocity during early years of life, but their growth will ultimately catch up with and follow growth patterns seen in the fifth percentile during childhood. However, growth velocity subsequently decreases during the early years of adolescents, due to a transient decrease in GH (growth hormone) secretion. Often, there is a family history of delayed puberty. Individuals with CDGP, often have slower bone maturation, and predicted height is often lower than what is predicted by their genetic potential (based on the height&#x27;s of their biological parents).

There are currently no reliable diagnostic tests that can be conducted to distinguish CDGP from Hypogonadism. As a result, diagnoses of CDGP are done by ruling out other possible causes. However, there have been laboratory studies done to differentiate a diagnosis of CDGP from Hypogonadotropic Hypogonadism using inhibin B and anti-Müllerian hormone concentrations.

When treating children with CDGP, the goal is to improve growth as well as maintain average body proportions and peak bone mass, while ensuring that growth potential is not impaired. Emotional outcomes for children are also studied, as distress has been documented in some children due to their lack of growth. This distress has been shown to affect their school performance and social relationships.

=== Obesity and early puberty ===
Childhood obesity has increased over the past several years particularly around 1975–2016. The research supporting the link between obesity and delayed puberty in both females and males is still not concrete. Some studies have supported that obesity may have an effect of earlier puberty in females but the data is not consistent with its relation to delayed puberty in males.

Assessment of the start of puberty can be harder to identify between males and females. Thelarche or breast bud development is usually the first sign of puberty in females. In children with obesity, it may be harder to identify excess adipose tissue with bread bud development, leading to potential false early puberty diagnosis.

Some data suggests that obesity can lead to a later pubertal onset in males. However, markers of early gonadal development is harder to identify in males because the true marker of the onset of puberty is testicular enlargement of 3 ml of larger which requires more invasive observations.

In conclusion, starting treatment as early as right after diagnosis is related to significant success in maintaining final adult height in case of CPP. The outcomes are determined by different factors; such as advancement of bone change in case of CDGP, age at which a child&#x27;s body begins changing in case of CPP, the timing of initiation, and duration of treatment. The hypothalamic–pituitary–gonadal (HPG) axis which is essentially in charge of regulating reproductive activity and releasing estrogen and progesterone in humans returns to normal levels by the end of the treatment and the children generally have normal development of puberty after finishing the treatment same as the normal levels of typical children. There is not much data on the long-term endocrine, metabolic, reproductive, and psychological outcomes.

<text>Frederick Lonsdale (5 February 1881 – 4 April 1954) was a British playwright known for his librettos to several successful musicals early in the 20th century, including &quot;King of Cadonia&quot; (1908), &quot;The Balkan Princess&quot; (1910), &quot;Betty&quot; (1915), &quot;The Maid of the Mountains&quot; (1917), &quot;Monsieur Beaucaire&quot; (1919) and &quot;Madame Pompadour&quot; (1923). He also wrote comedy plays, including &quot;The Last of Mrs. Cheyney&quot; (1925) and &quot;On Approval&quot; (1927) and the murder melodrama &quot;But for the Grace of God&quot; (1946). Some of his plays and musicals were made into films, and he also wrote a few screenplays.

==Personal life==
Lonsdale was born Lionel Frederick Leonard in St Helier, Jersey, the son of Susan (née Belford) and John Henry Leonard, a tobacconist. He began as a private soldier and worked for the London and South Western Railway. His daughters included his biographer Frances Donaldson and Angela Worthington (who was born illegitimately, through his relationship with Muriel Rose Morice), while his grandsons included the actors Edward and James Fox, and the film producer Robert Fox.

==Career==
Frank Curzon produced the young Lonsdale&#x27;s first work, the musical &quot;King of Cadonia&quot; (1908). Lonsdale&#x27;s more substantial than usual dialogue for the show&#x27;s Ruritanian comic opera plot won &quot;King of Cadonia&quot; fine notices and helped the musical to a long career. His next success was also for Curzon, &quot;The Balkan Princess&quot; (1910); this was little more than &quot;King of Cadonia&quot; with the sexes reversed, but it enjoyed a good London run, a long and wide provincial tour, and foreign productions.

Lonsdale&#x27;s next success was five years later, for George Edwardes, with &quot;Betty&quot; (1915). Following Edwardes&#x27;s death, he submitted to Edwardes&#x27; executor, Robert Evett, a text that Curzon had rejected, &quot;The Maid of the Mountains&quot; (1917; revived in 1920), which became one of the phenomenally successful wartime shows in London, establishing itself as a classic of the British musical stage.

Lonsdale continued to write some musicals after the war. He adapted Booth Tarkington&#x27;s &quot;Monsieur Beaucaire&quot; (1919, with music by André Messager) as a highly successful light opera and Jean Gilbert&#x27;s &quot;Die Frau im Hermelin&quot; (1922, &quot;The Lady of the Rose&quot;) and &quot;Katja, die Tänzerin&quot; (1925), as well as Leo Fall&#x27;s &quot;Madame Pompadour&quot; (1923). He also wrote the successful original book to the Parisian tale of &quot;The Street Singer&quot; (based on a 1912 film of the same name for Phyllis Dare (1924) and &quot;Lady Mary&quot; (1928).

He also began to write straight comedies, and his plays included &quot;Aren&#x27;t We All?&quot; (1923), &quot;Spring Cleaning&quot; (1925), &quot;The Last of Mrs. Cheyney&quot; (1925, which ran for 514 performances), &quot;On Approval&quot; (1927), &quot;Canaries Sometimes Sing&quot; (1929) and &quot;Let Them Eat Cake&quot; (a.k.a. &quot;Half a Loaf&quot;) among others. In 1946 he had a further West End hit with the murder melodrama &quot;But for the Grace of God&quot;. His last play, &quot;The Way Things Go&quot;, was written in 1949, more than 40 years after his first stage work and five years before his death in London from a heart attack. It was staged in 1950 with a cast including Kenneth More and Glynis Johns and ran for 155 performances in the West End.

<text>The 2004 European Parliament election in Luxembourg was the election of MEP representing Luxembourg constituency for the 2004–2009 term of the European Parliament. It was part of the wider 2004 European election. It was held on 13 June 2004. The national parliamentary elections took place simultaneously.

The ruling Christian Social People&#x27;s Party polled strongly, while the opposition Luxembourg Socialist Workers&#x27; Party lost ground.

==Candidates==
==Results==
&lt;onlyinclude&gt;&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;

The Luxembourg electoral system allows each voter to cast as many votes as there are
members to be elected. These figures show the number of votes cast for each party, 
not the number of voters who cast them. Voting at European Parliament elections is obligatory (as is the case with all other kinds of elections in the country).

<text>Morris Louis Bernstein (November 28, 1912 – September 7, 1962), known professionally as Morris Louis, was an American painter. During the 1950s he became one of the earliest exponents of Color Field painting. While living in Washington, D.C., Louis, along with Kenneth Noland and other Washington painters, formed an art movement that is known today as the Washington Color School.

==Early life and education==
From 1929 to 1933, he studied at the Maryland Institute of Fine and Applied Arts (now Maryland Institute College of Art) on a scholarship, but left shortly before completing the program. Louis worked at various odd jobs to support himself while painting, and in 1935 was president of the Baltimore Artists&#x27; Association. From 1936 to 1940, he lived in New York City and worked in the easel division of the Works Progress Administration Federal Art Project. During this period, he knew Arshile Gorky, David Alfaro Siqueiros, and Jack Tworkov. He also dropped his last name.

==Work==

===Color field painting===
He returned to his native Baltimore in 1940 and taught privately. In 1948, he pioneered the use of Magna paint—a newly developed oil-based acrylic paint made for him by his friends, New York paintmakers Leonard Bocour and Sam Golden. In 1952, Louis moved to Washington, D.C. Living in Washington, D.C., he was somewhat apart from the New York scene and he was working almost in isolation. During the 1950s he and a group of artists that included Kenneth Noland, Gene Davis, Thomas Downing, Howard Mehring, Anne Truitt and Hilda Thorpe among others were central to the development of Color Field painting. The basic point about Louis&#x27;s work and that of other Color Field painters, sometimes known as the Washington Color School in contrast to most of the other new approaches of the late 1950s and early 1960s, is that they greatly simplified the idea of what constitutes the look of a finished painting. They continued in a tradition of painting exemplified by Jackson Pollock, Barnett Newman, Clyfford Still, Mark Rothko, Robert Motherwell, and Ad Reinhardt. Eliminating gestural, compositional drawing in favor of large areas of raw canvas, solid planes of thinned and fluid paint, utilizing an expressive and psychological use of flat, and intense color and allover, repetitive composition. One of Louis&#x27;s most important series of Color Field paintings were his &quot;Unfurleds&quot;.

===Stain painting===
All of the Color Field artists were concerned with the classic problems of pictorial space and the flatness of the picture plane. In 1953, Louis and Noland visited Helen Frankenthaler&#x27;s New York studio, where they saw and were greatly impressed by her stain paintings, especially &quot;Mountains and Sea&quot; (1952). Upon their return to Washington, Louis and Noland together experimented with various techniques of paint application. Louis characteristically applied extremely diluted, thinned paint to an unprimed, unstretched canvas, allowing it to flow over the inclined surface in effects sometimes suggestive of translucent color veils. The importance of Frankenthaler&#x27;s example in Louis&#x27;s development of this technique has been noted. Louis reported that he thought of Frankenthaler as the bridge between Jackson Pollock and the possible. However, even more so than Frankenthaler, Louis eliminated the brush gesture, although his flat, thin pigment is at times modulated in billowing and subtle tones.

In 1954, Louis produced his mature &quot;Veil Paintings&quot;, which were characterized by overlapping, superimposed layers of transparent color poured onto and stained into sized or unsized canvas. The &quot;Veil Paintings&quot; consist of waves of brilliant, curving color-shapes submerged in translucent washes through which separate colors emerge principally at the edges. Although subdued, the resulting color is immensely rich. In another series, the artist used long parallel bands and stripes of pure color arranged side by side in rainbow effects. The painting &quot;Tet&quot; is a good example of his &quot;Veil Paintings&quot;.

The thinned acrylic paint was allowed to stain the canvas, making the pigment at one with the canvas as opposed to &quot;on top&quot;. This conformed to Greenberg&#x27;s conception of &quot;Modernism&quot; as it made the entire picture plane flat.

===Late paintings===

Louis destroyed many of his paintings between 1955 and 1957. He resumed work on the &quot;Veils&quot; in 1958–59. These were followed by &quot;Florals&quot; and &quot;Columns&quot; (1960), &quot;Alephs&quot; (1960), &quot;Unfurleds&quot; (1960–61)—in which rivulets of more opaque, intense color flow from both sides of large white fields of raw canvas—and finally the &quot;Stripe&quot; paintings (1961–62). Between summer 1960 and January/February 1961, he created about 150 &quot;Unfurleds&quot;, generally on mural-size canvases.

== Artworks (selection) ==

* &quot;Beth Shin&quot;, 1958. Pérez Art Museum Miami, Florida
* &quot;Delta Eta&quot;, 1960. Pérez Art Museum Miami, Florida
* &quot;Untitled&quot;, 1959–60, the Doris and Donald Fisher Collection at the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art in the &quot;Approaching American Abstraction Exhibition&quot;

==Exhibitions==
A memorial exhibition of Louis&#x27; work was held at the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum in 1963. Major Louis exhibitions were also organized by the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, in 1967 and the National Gallery of Art, Washington, D.C., in 1976. In 1986 there was an important retrospective exhibition of his works at the Museum of Modern Art (MoMA) in New York. During 2007-2008 an important retrospective was held by museums in San Diego, at the Museum of Contemporary Art, in Atlanta at the High Museum, and in Washington, DC. at the Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden. 

In 2024, both &quot;Beth Shin&quot; and &quot;Delta Eta&quot;, integrated &quot;Every Sound Is a Shape of Time: Selections from PAMM&#x27;s Collection&quot;, at the Pérez Art Museum Miami. The show is curated by museum director and art historian, Franklin Sirmans. 

==Art market==
In 2015, a striped canvas by Louis, &quot;Number 36&quot; (1962), from the collection of Lord Anthony and Lady Evelyn Jacobs sold for £1.5 million at Christie&#x27;s London.

==Personal life==
He married Marcella Siegel in 1947. She supported him throughout his career and in memory of him she supported one artist every year through the Morris Louis Fellowship at George Washington University.

==Death==
Morris Louis was diagnosed with lung cancer in 1962 and soon after died at his home in Washington, D.C., on September 7, 1962. The cause of his illness was attributed to prolonged exposure to paint vapours. The Estate of Morris Louis is represented exclusively by Diane Upright, a former professor of fine art at Harvard University.

<text>Pierre-Félix Louÿs (; 10 December 1870 – 4 June 1925) was a Belgian poet and writer, most renowned for lesbian and classical themes in some of his writings. He is known as a writer who sought to &quot;express pagan sensuality with stylistic perfection&quot;. He was made first a Chevalier and then an Officer of the Légion d&#x27;honneur for his contributions to French literature.

==Life==
Pierre Louÿs was born Pierre Félix Louis on 10 December 1870 in Ghent, Belgium, but relocated to France, where he spent the rest of his life. He studied at the École Alsacienne in Paris, and there he developed a good friendship with a future Nobel Prize winner and champion of homosexual rights André Gide. From 1890 onwards, he began spelling his name as &quot;Louÿs&quot;, and pronouncing the final S, as a way of expressing his fondness for classical Greek culture (the letter Y is known in French as &quot;i grec&quot; or &quot;Greek I&quot;). During the 1890s, he became a friend of the Irish homosexual dramatist Oscar Wilde, and was the dedicatee of Wilde&#x27;s &quot;Salomé&quot; in its original (French) edition. Louÿs started writing his first erotic texts at the age of 18, at which time he developed an interest in the Parnassian and Symbolist schools of writing. Louÿs had a long-term romantic relationship with 
fellow writer Marie de Régnier.

===Early writings===
During 1891, Louÿs helped initiate a literary review, &quot;La Conque&quot;, where he proceeded to publish &quot;Astarte&quot;, an early collection of erotic verse already marked by his distinctive style. During 1894 he published another erotic collection of 143 prose poems, &quot;Songs of Bilitis (Les Chansons de Bilitis)&quot;, this time with strong lesbian themes. It was divided into three sections, each representative of a phase of Bilitis&#x27;s life: Bucolics in Pamphylia, Elegies at Mytilene, and Epigrams in the Isle of Cyprus; dedicated to her were also a short &quot;Life of Bilitis&quot; and three epitaphs in &quot;The Tomb of Bilitis&quot;. What made &quot;The Songs&quot; sensational is Louÿs&#x27;s claim that the poems were the work of an ancient Greek courtesan and contemporary of Sappho, Bilitis; to himself, Louÿs ascribed the modest role of translator. The pretense did not last long, and &quot;translator&quot; Louÿs was soon revealed as Bilitis herself. This did little to discredit &quot;The Songs of Bilitis&quot;, however, as it was praised for its sensuality and refined style, even more extraordinary for the author&#x27;s compassionate portrayal of lesbian sexuality.

Some of the poems were intended as songs for voice and piano. Louÿs&#x27;s friend Claude Debussy composed a musical adaptation of three of the poems as his &quot;Chansons de Bilitis&quot; (Lesure Number 90) for voice and piano (1897–1898):
* &quot;La flûte de Pan: Pour le jour des Hyacinthies&quot;
* &quot;La chevelure: Il m&#x27;a dit «Cette nuit j&#x27;ai rêvé»&quot;
* &quot;Le tombeau des Naiades: Le long du bois couvert de givre&quot;.

Debussy also published &quot;Six épigraphes antiques&quot; during 1914 as piano pieces for four hands, commissioned as preludes to a recital of Louÿs&#x27;s poems:
* &quot;Pour invoquer Pan, dieu du vent d&#x27;ete&quot;
* &quot;Pour un tombeau sans nom&quot; 
* &quot;Pour que la nuit soit propice&quot; 
* &quot;Pour la danseuse aux crotales&quot;
* &quot;Pour l&#x27;egyptienne&quot; 
* &quot;Pour remercier la pluie au matin&quot;

During 1955, one of the first lesbian organizations in America named itself Daughters of Bilitis, and to the present Louÿs&#x27;s &quot;Songs&quot; continues to be an important work for lesbians.

===Later writings===
During 1896, Louÿs published his first novel, &quot;Aphrodite – Ancient Manners&quot; (&quot;Aphrodite – mœurs antiques&quot;), a description of courtesan life in Alexandria. It is considered a mixture of both literary excess and refinement, and was the best selling work (at 350,000 copies) by any living French author of the time. Although Debussy claimed exclusive rights to compose an opera based on &quot;Aphrodite&quot; (and Louÿs said he had to turn down several similar applications), the project never got under way.

Louÿs later published &quot;Les Aventures du roi Pausole&quot; (The Adventures of King Pausole) in 1901, &quot;Pervigilium Mortis&quot; in 1916, both of them libertine compositions, and &quot;Manuel de civilité pour les petites filles à l&#x27;usage des maisons d&#x27;éducation&quot;, written during 1917 and published posthumously and anonymously in 1927.

Inspired by Abel Lefranc&#x27;s arguments for the Derbyite theory of Shakespeare authorship, Louÿs proposed in 1919 that the works of Molière were actually written by Corneille.

Even while on his deathbed, Pierre Louÿs continued to write erotic verses.

==Illustrators==
Many erotic artists have illustrated Louÿs&#x27;s writings. Some of the most renowned have been John Austen, Georges Barbier, Paul-Émile Bécat, Antoine Calbet, Donald Denton, Beresford Egan, Foujita, Louis Icart, Joseph Kuhn-Régnier, Georges Lepape, Mariette Lydis, Milo Manara, André Edouard Marty, Georges Pichard, Rojan, Marcel Vertès, Édouard Zier.

One of the best known illustrations for &quot;The Songs of Bilitis&quot; were done by Willy Pogany in art deco style for a publication circulated privately by Macy-Masius, New York, during 1926.

<text>GP Racing, formerly F1 Racing, was a monthly magazine focused on Formula One racing published from March 1996 to December 2024. In 2025, the publication was merged with its sister brand &quot;Autosport&quot; to create a newly combined monthly publication; which effectively ended the &quot;GP Racing&quot; magazine after 28 years in circulation.

== Launch and development ==
&quot;F1 Racing&quot; launch was the culmination of a year of preparation by UK publishers Haymarket. The magazine&#x27;s genesis was inspired by the sport&#x27;s peak in popularity following the death of Ayrton Senna, and high-profile rivalry between Michael Schumacher and Damon Hill. Haymarket&#x27;s weekly &quot;Autosport&quot; and &quot;Motorsport News&quot; titles supplied a pool of talented writers and their contacts: with the weekly market well served, &quot;F1 Racing&quot; would be more feature-based and former &quot;Autosport&quot; writer Mike Herd was appointed editor. 

Two business decisions in particular made the new title feasible: Haymarket&#x27;s focus on agreeing annual (rather than monthly or ad-hoc) deals with advertisers, and its publication of a German edition to capitalise upon Schumacher&#x27;s popularity. A private &#x27;dummy&#x27; test issue was produced in November 1995, dubbed &#x27;Issue Zero&#x27;, before the first issue proper was published to coincide with the beginning of the 1996 season.

Much of the title&#x27;s growth took place under long-standing editor Matt Bishop, who took over the helm of the title in December 1996. Bishop left both &quot;F1 Racing&quot; and &quot;Autosport&quot; (for which he wrote an online column) in late 2007 to join McLaren and was replaced as editor of the monthly magazine by the then executive editor Tim Scott, and later by Hans Seeberg. On 9 May 2012 it was announced that Anthony Rowlinson would become the magazine&#x27;s new editor.

In July 2005, &quot;F1 Racing&quot; celebrated its one hundredth issue; it continues to publish in over twenty countries, and claims the title &quot;The World&#x27;s Best-Selling Grand Prix Magazine&quot;. In the one hundred issues, Michael Schumacher had been cover feature over forty times – more than any other driver – including the first issue in March 1996. In February 2001, a &quot;Michael Schumacher Special Edition&quot; was published.

Many well respected journalists and photographers contribute to the magazine. Such regulars have included journalists Peter Windsor and Alan Henry, and renowned photographers Darren Heath, Steven Tee, Rip (Ripley &amp; Ripley), and Lorenzo Bellanca. Damon Hill was &#x27;Guest Editor&#x27; in January 2000, which featured an interview between him and Michael Schumacher. From the March 2006 issue to the February 2007 of &quot;F1 Racing&quot;, Max Mosley, then president of the FIA, had a monthly column in the magazine.

As of 2011 &quot;F1 Racing&quot; has been available as a digital download, alongside the print edition.

In 2016, Haymarket sold their motorsport properties to Motorsport Network, including &quot;F1 Racing&quot;.

In February 2020 it was announced that the magazine would no longer licence the F1 trademark and that from the March 2020 issue it would be renamed &quot;GP Racing&quot;. Editor Ben Anderson wrote in his editorial column that because of the cost of the licence, &quot;...it would not have been sustainable for us to continue reporting on Formula 1 in this way without significantly increasing the price of the magazine, reducing the physical quality of the product, or sacrificing its editorial independence.&quot;

In late 2024 &quot;Autosport&quot; and &quot;GP Racing&quot; merged and the magazine ended with its December 2024 issue.

== Team sponsorship ==
&quot;F1 Racing&quot; magazine briefly sponsored the ill-fated Mastercard Lola team in 1997. However, the team failed to qualify for the opening round of that season at the 1997 Australian Grand Prix with both of their cars having failed to make the 107% time. The team withdrew from the next race in Brazil and withdrew from the whole championship soon after.

== McLaren &#x27;brake steer&#x27; scoop ==
At the 1997 Austrian Grand Prix, Darren Heath, an &quot;F1 Racing&quot; photographer, noticed that the rear brakes of the McLarens were glowing red in an acceleration zone of the track. The magazine discovered through investigation that McLaren had installed a second brake pedal, selectable by the driver to act on any one of the rear wheels at the driver&#x27;s control. This allowed the driver to eliminate understeer and reduce wheelspin when exiting slow corners. This system was entirely legal, but was an innovation, and hence gave McLaren an advantage. While &quot;F1 Racing&quot; suspected what McLaren were doing, they required proof to publish the story. 

At the 1997 Luxembourg Grand Prix the two McLarens retired from the race while in first and second positions. This allowed Heath to take a picture of the footwell of Häkkinen&#x27;s car and the second brake pedal. The story was run in the November issue of &quot;F1 Racing&quot; and led to the system being dubbed &quot;brake steer&quot;. Ferrari&#x27;s protestations to the FIA led to the system being banned at the 1998 Brazilian Grand Prix.

<doc id="755582" wikidata="Q348857" url="?curid=755582" title="Gary Neville">
<text>Gary Alexander Neville (born 18 February 1975) is an English football pundit, coach, former player, and co-owner of English Football League club Salford City. As a player, Neville was a right-back and spent his entire career with Manchester United, serving as club captain for five years. He is one of the most decorated English and European footballers of all time, having won a total of 20 trophies, including eight Premier League titles and two UEFA Champions League titles.

Neville made his international debut for England in 1995 and was first-choice right-back for more than 10 years, representing the nation at three European Championships and two FIFA World Cups.

After retiring from football in 2011, Neville went into punditry and was a commentator for Sky Sports, until he took over the head coach position at Valencia in 2015. After being sacked by the club in 2016, he returned to his position as a pundit for Sky Sports later that year. He was also an assistant manager for the England national team from 2012 to 2016.

Neville is the older brother of twin siblings: his brother Phil Neville is also a former long-serving player for Manchester United, while his sister Tracey Neville is a retired netball international.

==Club career==
===1994–2004===
Neville joined Manchester United as an apprentice upon leaving school in 1991, and captained the youth side to FA Youth Cup glory in his first season. He made his senior debut for United on 16 September 1992 in a goalless home draw against Torpedo Moscow in the UEFA Cup. Neville emerged as part of Alex Ferguson&#x27;s youth-oriented side of the 1990s (nicknamed &quot;Fergie&#x27;s Fledglings&quot;, an updated take on the 1950s equivalent &quot;Busby Babes&quot;) that included his brother Phil, Ryan Giggs, David Beckham, Nicky Butt and Paul Scholes.

In the 1994–95 season, Neville became United&#x27;s first-choice right-back when Paul Parker was ruled out by injury, and remained so until his retirement, although in his first season as a regular player he often found himself on the sidelines as Denis Irwin was switched to right-back with Lee Sharpe (normally a winger) filling the left-back role.

Neville scored the first goal of his career in 1997 against Middlesbrough in a 3–3 draw, and he went on to score a total of five league goals for United; against Everton in 1999, Aston Villa in a 2–0 victory on 20 January 2001, the sole goal against Leicester City on 13 April 2004, and his final league goal came a week later when he scored the second in a 2–0 victory over Charlton Athletic on 20 April 2004. Neville also scored two goals in the UEFA Champions League, the first on 12 March 2003, when he scored the equaliser in a 1–1 draw with FC Basel, and his seventh and final ever United goal against Lyon on 23 November 2004 in Alex Ferguson&#x27;s 1,000th game in charge of the club, a 2–1 victory.

Neville formed a successful partnership with Beckham on the right wing, regularly contributing assists.

===2005–2011===
In January 2005, Neville was critical of Nike for starting anti-racism campaign Stand Up Speak Up, accusing them of being involved for good public relations. Neville made the comments after refusing to wear a training top bearing the logo ahead of a fixture against rivals Arsenal. Writing in &quot;The Independent&quot;, journalist Sam Wallace said Neville&#x27;s refusal, as well as that of teammates Scholes and captain Roy Keane, caused friction between the two teams before the match.

Following Keane&#x27;s departure in November 2005, Neville was appointed the new club captain. In January 2006, his actions were the subject of some controversy after his celebration in front of the visiting Liverpool fans at Old Trafford, when he was seen to run from the halfway line towards the opposing fans to celebrate the 90th minute injury-time winning headed goal by United defender Rio Ferdinand. His actions were criticised by Liverpool and fellow England defender Jamie Carragher, sections of the media and police who blamed him for disturbances between fans after the game. He was subsequently charged with improper conduct by the FA. Neville contested this, asking if it was preferable for players to act like &quot;robots&quot; and show no emotions. He was fined £5,000 and warned about his future conduct.

Neville recovered from an injury suffered against Bolton Wanderers in March 2007 and in his first match back, a reserve game against Everton in January 2008, he scored a rare goal in the 21st minute of the game which helped Manchester United to a 2–2 draw.

On 9 April 2008, Neville made his long-awaited comeback against Roma in the UEFA Champions League quarter-final second leg at Old Trafford, coming on as an 81st-minute substitute for Anderson; Neville was welcomed back to the pitch with a standing ovation, and was promptly given the captain&#x27;s armband. It was Neville&#x27;s 99th Champions League appearance. However, he was not selected for the Champions League final squad on 21 May, though he did join in with the post-match celebrations after United won on penalties following a 1–1 draw with Chelsea. Instead, Rio Ferdinand and Giggs lifted the trophy together having shared the captaincy during Neville&#x27;s absence.
Neville started his first game in 17 months when he captained Manchester United for the 2008 FA Community Shield against Portsmouth on 10 August 2008. He then made another start against Zenit Saint Petersburg in the UEFA Super Cup, before making his first start at home since his injury against Villarreal in the opening group game of the 2008–09 Champions League. On 21 September 2008, Neville started his first league game in almost 18 months when he played against Chelsea. Neville extended his stay at Old Trafford until June 2010.

On 27 October 2009, Neville was sent off for a tackle on Adam Hammill in United&#x27;s 2–0 away win against Barnsley in the League Cup Fourth Round. Neville added another medal to his honours list on 28 February 2010 when he came on as a substitute for Rafael in the 2–1 League Cup final win over Aston Villa. He did feature in enough league games to qualify for what would have been his ninth title medal, but United were beaten to the Premier League title by Chelsea who finished ahead of them by a single point. Neville signed a new one-year contract in April 2010.

Having made only sporadic appearances in the last couple of seasons, Neville stepped down as team captain in September 2010 in preference of a more-regular first-team player, usually Rio Ferdinand, Nemanja Vidić or Patrice Evra, although he remained as club captain off the pitch. On 24 October, Neville made his 600th appearance and his penultimate start for United in a 2–1 away victory against Stoke City; after receiving a 34th minute yellow card for a foul against Matthew Etherington, Neville was shown leniency seven minutes later for another reckless tackle on the same player, and was substituted at half-time for Wes Brown.

===Retirement===
On 2 February 2011, Neville announced his retirement from football after almost 20 years playing at Manchester United. Neville&#x27;s final professional appearance was against West Bromwich Albion on New Year&#x27;s Day 2011, a 2–1 victory at The Hawthorns. Neville later revealed that, during half-time of his last game, he sat on the toilet and knew for certain that it would be his last game. By the time of his retirement, Neville had won eight Premier League titles, three FA Cups, two Champions Leagues, an Intercontinental Cup, a FIFA Club World Cup, and two League Cups. The 2006 League Cup was his first trophy as captain.

His testimonial was played at Old Trafford against Juventus on 24 May 2011. Manchester United&#x27;s starting line-up included members of the &quot;Class of &#x27;92&quot;: Neville was joined by Phil Neville, Beckham, Butt, Scholes and Giggs. Juventus won the match 2–1. He made another appearance in Paul Scholes&#x27; testimonial at Old Trafford on 5 August 2011, playing for the New York Cosmos in their first fixture since their re-establishment in 2010.

==International career==

Neville made his first appearance for England in 1995 when he was picked by Terry Venables for the friendly against Japan. On 23 May 1996, he was joined in the England team by Phil Neville for a match against China; they had also appeared together in the 1996 FA Cup Final two weeks earlier and thus were the first pair of brothers to play together in an FA Cup-winning side and for England in the same season since Hubert and Francis Heron in 1877, 119 years earlier.

He was subsequently selected at right-back for his country by five different coaches. The form of Manchester City&#x27;s Micah Richards, Liverpool&#x27;s Glen Johnson and Neville&#x27;s Manchester United teammate Wes Brown placed his position in the England team under threat in the latter years of his career.

Neville had been the youngest first-choice player in the England first team during his debut tournament, Euro 96, playing in each game until the semi-final, for which he was suspended after receiving a yellow card in two separate games. England were knocked out by the eventual winners, Germany, in a penalty shootout. In June 1997, he participated in the Tournoi de France, the friendly international football tournament held in France as a warm-up to the 1998 FIFA World Cup. He also played in the 1998 World Cup under the tenure of Glenn Hoddle as manager. As &quot;a bit of a sceptic&quot;, Neville did not see Eileen Drewery, the faith healer Hoddle had brought into the England squad. Neville also played at Euro 2000 during the tenure of Kevin Keegan as manager.

A broken foot ruled Neville out of the 2002 World Cup, but he quickly returned to the side after regaining his fitness, and was once again the first-choice right-back by the time of Euro 2004, with the team now being managed by Sven-Göran Eriksson.

Neville missed the latter stages of the qualification campaign for the 2006 World Cup with injury. He returned to the England team in March 2006 for a friendly against Uruguay. Neville was selected for England&#x27;s 2006 World Cup squad. He played in England&#x27;s opening Group B game against Paraguay but pulled his calf in training the night before the team&#x27;s second game and was forced to miss the next three games until playing the full match in England&#x27;s losing quarter-final against Portugal on 1 July. It was his 81st England cap, bringing him up to ninth in the all-time rankings, ahead of Gary Lineker and teammate Michael Owen, who had briefly drawn level with Neville during the World Cup.

Neville briefly took over the England captaincy during this game after the substitution of David Beckham due to an injury shortly after half-time, despite the previous match&#x27;s deputy captain John Terry also being on the field.

After the defeat to Portugal, Neville announced that he would continue to be available for selection for his country under new coach Steve McClaren and added that, unlike some former international teammates, he would not ever make the decision to retire from the England set-up, saying, &quot;That decision is not Gary Neville&#x27;s to make&quot;. As one of three club captains (along with Terry and Steven Gerrard) in the first-choice England line-up, he was mentioned as a contender for the England captaincy vacated by Beckham after elimination from the World Cup. However, Terry was given the job and Steven Gerrard made vice-captain.

On 11 October, Neville was involved in a game-changing incident during a Euro 2008 qualifier against Croatia when his straightforward backpass took an unfortunate bounce and caused goalkeeper Paul Robinson to miss his kick, which resulted in the ball ending up in the net. Although Robinson was at the centre of the moment, Neville was officially credited with an own goal, the second of his England career; he has scored no goals for England.

On 7 February 2007, Neville won his 85th cap in England&#x27;s 1–0 friendly defeat to Spain. His appearance took him to within one cap of equalling Sansom&#x27;s record for an England full-back, and eighth in the all-time appearances list for his country. However, an ankle injury suffered on 17 March 2007 while playing for Manchester United robbed him of the chance to equal Sansom&#x27;s record, as he was forced to miss the Euro 2008 qualifiers against Israel and Andorra on 24 March and 28 respectively. Surgery on his ankle ruled him out of two summer matches at the new Wembley Stadium, and then a calf muscle injury delayed his recovery in the autumn. These injury problems together with a perceived decline in ability threatened to put an end to Neville&#x27;s international playing career.

On 24 May 2009, Neville was given a surprise recall to the England squad by Fabio Capello for the World Cup qualifiers against Kazakhstan and Andorra, but did not feature in any of these games.

Neville holds or co-holds a number of England records:

*When he came on as a substitute against Italy at Leeds in 2002, he earned his 51st cap, breaking the record for a right-back held previously by Phil Neal
*His 11 appearances for England in the European Championship finals (over three tournaments) is a record
*With his brother Phil, the Nevilles hold the record of England&#x27;s most-capped brothers, with 142 appearances between them. It was Phil&#x27;s appearance as a substitute against Israel in 2007, a game for which Gary was injured, which broke a record they had jointly held with Jack and Bobby Charlton
*The Nevilles hold outright the record for the most appearances in the same England team by a pair of brothers with 31, although the 31st in 2007 came a whole seven years after the 30th

Neville wrote in his autobiography that, at times, he had reflected on his international career and thought sometimes that it was &quot;a massive waste of time&quot;, and that success with United was &quot;always the most important thing&quot;.

==Style of play==
An experienced and dedicated footballer, regarded as one of England&#x27;s greatest right-backs, and as one of the best Premier League full-backs of his generation, Gary Neville was an aggressive, tenacious, and hard-tackling player, known for his work-rate, professionalism, determination, and consistency as a defender; due to his positional sense, he was also capable of playing as a centre-back on occasion. Under England manager Venables at Euro 96, Neville was also required to play in other different roles depending on the opponent, including as a right-sided wing-back and winger, in addition to his typical roles of right-back and right-sided centre-back. Although he was not the quickest, tallest, strongest, most talented or most technically gifted player, he was a reliable, traditional defensive-minded right-back, known in particular for his tactical intelligence and ability to read the game, as well as his stamina, work-ethic, authoritative presence on the pitch, and leadership, which enabled him to excel in this role; as such, he has been described as an &quot;old-fashioned&quot; defender, due to his combative playing style. During his career, Neville also formed a notable partnership with David Beckham down the right flank at Manchester United: he would often carry up the ball, lay it off to his teammate, and subsequently make overlapping runs to advance into more offensive positions, from which he could receive passes and deliver accurate crosses, providing an additional attacking threat to his team when Beckham was heavily marked. A vocal presence on the pitch and an opinionated dressing room personality, Neville also drew controversy throughout his career for his outspokenness and tendency to be involved in conflicts with opponents. His former manager, Ferguson, once described him as &quot;the best English right-back of his generation&quot;.

==Managerial career==
===England assistant manager===
Neville, who holds UEFA Pro Coaching Licences, was appointed to the England senior team coaching staff by newly appointed manager Roy Hodgson on 14 May 2012 along with Ray Lewington and goalkeeping coach Dave Watson, signing a four-year contract with the FA. This saw him on the coaching team for Euro 2012, and was met with the backing of former England and Manchester United teammate David Beckham, who called his appointment a &quot;shrewd move&quot;. Neville continued to work as assistant manager of England through the 2014 World Cup and subsequent Euro 2016 qualifying campaign.

===Valencia===
Neville was appointed as head coach at Valencia in Spain on 2 December 2015. Neville&#x27;s brother Phil had previously been caretaker manager and continued to work with his brother at the club; Neville also retained his England assistant coaching role while at Valencia. The decision to hire Neville was met with much surprise in Spain, due to his lack of prior experience, and as he was not fluent in Spanish. On 9 December, Neville managed his first game in charge of Valencia, suffering a 2–0 defeat against Lyon in the Champions League; as a result, Valencia finished third in their group, and were demoted to the UEFA Europa League.

On 3 February 2016, Valencia lost 7–0 away to Barcelona in the first leg of the semi-final of the Copa del Rey. This came after the team had gone eight games without a victory in La Liga since Neville took over, leading to criticism from the press as well as the club&#x27;s fans, who called for him to resign. A week later, Valencia were eliminated from the tournament after a 1–1 draw in the return leg.

Having started with a sequence of nine winless league matches, Valencia recorded their first win under Neville in a 2–1 victory at home against Espanyol on 13 February 2016. On 17 March, in the return leg of Valencia&#x27;s UEFA Europa League round of 16 tie, Neville was sent off for protesting against Athletic Bilbao&#x27;s goal to the officials; although Valencia won the match 2–1 at home, they were eliminated from the tournament on away goals, following a 2–2 draw on aggregate. On 30 March 2016, Neville was sacked by the club. At the time of his sacking, Valencia were 14th in the league, six points clear of the relegation zone, and had won only three of their 16 league games under Neville, also failing to keep a single clean sheet.

==Club ownership==
In 2014, it was announced that Neville, along with fellow Manchester United legends Ryan Giggs, Paul Scholes, Nicky Butt and Phil Neville, had agreed to a deal to purchase Salford City ahead of the 2014–15 season, with plans to get the club to The Football League. The group announced they would take part in a special friendly, with Salford facing a Class of &#x27;92 team. On 22 September, the group agreed to sell a 50% stake in the club to billionaire Peter Lim. Salford obtained promotion in their first season, as documented in the &quot;Class of 92&quot; television programme for the BBC.

===Property developments===

Ahead of his testimonial in 2011, Neville revealed he would spend the proceeds towards a supporters club and hotel near Old Trafford. Despite objections from Manchester United, Neville&#x27;s plans were approved in 2012. In 2013, Neville and Ryan Giggs launched a hospitality company named GG Hospitality, with plans to build football-themed hotels and cafés around the United Kingdom, initially in Manchester and London. The first operation was a football-themed restaurant named Café Football in Stratford, London, which opened in November 2013, with Hotel Football, previously under the guise of the supporters club Neville announced in 2011, scheduled to be opened in late 2014.

In 2015, Neville and Ryan Giggs gained planning permission for a second Manchester hotel which will not be football themed. The pair will be redeveloping Manchester&#x27;s former stock exchange building into a boutique hotel. Giggs and Neville bought the 1906-built Northern Stock Exchange Building for £1.5 million in 2013. The Grade II-listed building is on 4 Norfolk Street and will have 35 beds, a gym, spa, roof-top terrace, restaurant and bar. Zerum, Gary Neville&#x27;s property consultancy, acted as agents for the application for planning permission.

Along with other United players who won the 1992 FA Youth Cup, Neville founded a higher education institution in Greater Manchester, named University Academy 92 which offers &quot;broader courses than traditional degrees&quot; and aims to attract students who &quot;otherwise might not go on to higher education&quot;. It opened in September 2019 in Old Trafford, Greater Manchester. As of August 2022, it has 400 students.

In January 2022, it was announced that construction had begun on the £120 million St Michael&#x27;s redevelopment project in Manchester city centre. The development will feature &quot;a new public space (St Michael&#x27;s Square), 191 hotel rooms, 181 apartments and a rooftop restaurant capable of hosting 900 guests&quot;.

===Media career===
Neville wrote a weekly full-page column in the Sports section of &quot;The Sunday Times of Malta&quot;, the widest circulating newspaper in the country, which is home to the oldest recognised Manchester United Supporters&#x27; Club. He joined Sky Sports at the start of the 2011–12 season, taking over as match analyst on &quot;Monday Night Football&quot; from Andy Gray alongside Jamie Redknapp. Neville had previously done some punditry work for ITV Sport during the 2002 World Cup, which he missed due to injury, and for Euro 2008, which England did not qualify for. In 2014, he began presenting Sky Sports&#x27; &quot;Monday Night Football&quot; with broadcaster Ed Chamberlin. Former England teammate and retired Liverpool defender Jamie Carragher joined a year later. Neville and Carragher have been praised for their analysis, with their former on-field rivalry adding to their personalities on-air. His commentary for a Fernando Torres goal for Chelsea against Barcelona in the 2011–12 UEFA Champions League semi-finals second leg garnered notoriety and was dubbed a &quot;Goalgasm&quot;. On 8 August 2014, &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; announced that Neville would be joining their staff as a columnist.

In taking his managerial job at Valencia in December 2015, Neville quit his position as a regular Sky Sports pundit after four years in the job. After being sacked from the club during the 2015–16 season after only four months, in 2016, Neville returned to his position as a pundit for Sky Sports for the 2016–17 season. Neville participated as a pundit in ITV&#x27;s coverage of 2018 FIFA World Cup. and in the 2020 UEFA European Championship. In 2021, Neville started his own YouTube channel, named The Overlap, on which he interviews figures from the world of sport.

Neville has regularly been praised for his well-researched and neutral analysis, and he is now regarded as one of the best football pundits on British television, with Gary Lineker saying he would like to work with Neville on &quot;Match of the Day&quot;, and Des Lynam also praising his switch from player to pundit. Neville has also received criticism from some in the sport for being overly opinionated or excessively harsh in his analyses; in 2011, Chelsea manager André Villas-Boas spoke out against comments Neville had made about Chelsea during a period of poor form, accusing him of being &quot;biased&quot;, while in 2016, Hernán Crespo was critical both of Neville&#x27;s punditry and his tenure as Valencia&#x27;s manager, stating, &quot;To watch a game from the TV, it&#x27;s very different than from the bench. I&#x27;m almost happy for Gary Neville&#x27;s troubles at Valencia. I remember he was too harsh as a TV pundit.&quot;

Neville has spoken out publicly against the dominance of foreign players in the Premier League. In 2013, he said: &quot;We have reached a tipping point. You have Cristiano Ronaldo at Real Madrid and Lionel Messi at Barcelona but in the Spanish league 63 per cent of their players are still Spanish. That sounds about right. We&#x27;ve gone too far in England. We&#x27;re maybe 20 per cent off. We need to give chances to our own.&quot; In July 2018, Neville was interviewed by the Digital, Culture, Media and Sport Committee about the proposed sale of Wembley Stadium. Neville described it as a &quot;short-term plan we&#x27;ll regret forever&quot;. He suggested taking a 25% cut of agents&#x27; fees to fund grassroots football instead.

In 2021, when reports emerged that a number of European clubs (including six Premier League clubs) were breaking away from the European football pyramid system to form a European Super League without meritocratic relegation and promotion, Neville publicly opposed the plans. Shortly thereafter, the European Super League collapsed amid a strong backlash. Two weeks later, Neville expressed support for Anti-Glazer protests, which occurred in light of the attempted creation of the European Super League, and is part of a movement dating back to 2005.

In 2024, Neville began making guest appearances on the British reality television business programme &quot;Dragons&#x27; Den&quot;. He has invested in a number of businesses including sports recovery company MyoMaster run by former Harlequins rugby player Joe Gray and his wife, Lottie.

===Personal life===
Neville&#x27;s father, Neville Neville, was a former league cricketer. His mother Jill used to play netball in the local leagues, and was general manager and club secretary for Football League club Bury.

Neville was a talented cricketer as a schoolboy and played alongside future England captain Michael Vaughan at the Bunbury Cricket Festival and younger brother Phil for Lancashire&#x27;s Under-14 team, and also for Greenmount Cricket Club in the Bolton Cricket League, for whom on 19 July 1992 he scored 110 not out in an unbroken partnership of 236 with Australian professional Matthew Hayden in a Hamer Cup tie against Astley Bridge.

In 1999, Neville was best man for the wedding of team-mate David Beckham and Victoria Adams. Neville married Emma Hadfield on 16 June 2007; they have two daughters.

In July 2009, he was awarded an honorary degree from the University of Bolton for his outstanding contributions to football.

In January 2010, it was reported that Neville has applied for planning permission to build an eco-friendly home, which would be the first zero-carbon house in northwest England. Neville&#x27;s testimonial game was reported to be the most eco-friendly game in English football history.

Neville endorsed the Labour Party in the 2019 United Kingdom general election, joining the party in 2022. He criticised the party for not opposing the Conservative government&#x27;s lockdown restrictions during the 2020–2021 COVID-19 pandemic, arguing businesses should receive more economic support. Prior to the 2024 general election he appeared in a party election broadcast with Labour leader Keir Starmer.

On 16 April 2022, Neville revealed that he will be banned from driving after reaching 12 penalty points on his licence and issued an apology.

Neville drew public criticism for his support and financial partnership with the 2022 World Cup in Qatar, where he worked for the Qatari national broadcaster for an undisclosed fee. He was called out by Ian Hislop on an episode of Have I Got News For You prior to the World Cup, for supporting a state known for serious human rights abuses.

<text>The toy industry in Birmingham (and some other areas) was an economic sector that produced small goods in any material. Edmund Burke described Birmingham in Parliament in 1777 as &quot;the great Toy Shop of Europe&quot;.

Hinges, buttons, belt buckles and hooks are all examples of goods that were once considered &quot;toys&quot; and could be produced in metal, leather or glass, amongst others. The term &quot;toy&quot; was used starting in the 18th century or earlier to describe the industry in the English Midlands, and changed to its modern form (&quot;toy&quot; as in plaything) years later. The metalworking legacy still exists in the form of Birmingham&#x27;s Jewellery Quarter.

Although the toy industry tended to be based on small cottage manufactories at first, the rise of the middle class in London created a demand that led to rapid expansion of the industry in the mid-18th century. At this point economies of scale started to come into effect, and a number of very large manufactories were built, leading to the common use of the term &quot;factory&quot;. These factories typically had a number of designers that could be called on for any sort of work, while different parts of the building were dedicated to mass production of different sorts of goods. These early factories were an early step on the road to the assembly line, and an important factor in the creation of the Industrial Revolution.

One major entrepreneur in the toy industry was Matthew Boulton. In 1760 he described the Birmingham buckle trade to a House of Commons select committee, estimating that at least 8,000 were employed, generating £300,000 worth of business, with the majority being for export to Europe. In 1766 Boulton completed his &quot;model manufactory&quot; called Soho Manufactory near Birmingham, powered by a waterwheel, employing one thousand workers. Soho produced high-quality buckles, buttons, boxes, trinkets in steel, gold, sterling silver, goods of ormolu and Sheffield plate.

==Range of products==
In 1767, &quot;Sketchley&#x27;s Directory&quot; outlined the range of products that fell under the designation of &quot;toys&quot;:
In 1833, John Holland drew a distinction between Birmingham&#x27;s manufacture of &quot;heavy steel toys&quot; and &quot;light steel toys&quot;. The &quot;heavy steel toys&quot; he compared and contrasted with the &quot;tools&quot; made in Lancashire:
Of &quot;light steel toys&quot;, Holland wrote:

<doc id="755593" wikidata="Q7749331" url="?curid=755593" title="The Mad Scientists' Club">
<text>The Mad Scientists&#x27; Club is a series of four books written for children by Bertrand R. Brinley (1917 – 1994) and illustrated by Charles Geer.

==Books in the series==

* &quot;The Big Kerplop; A Mad Scientists&#x27; Club Adventure&quot; (1974, 2003) 
* &quot;The Big Chunk of Ice&quot; (2005) 

The title of &quot;The Big Kerplop&quot; was supposed to be &quot;The Big Kerplop!&quot;, but the original publisher, MacRae Smith Company, dropped the exclamation mark, which has now been restored. Even though it was written 14 years after &quot;The Strange Sea Monster of Strawberry Lake&quot;, chronologically it is the first story in the series, telling how the Mad Scientists&#x27; Club came into being and the full story behind their long-standing animosity with Harmon Muldoon.

==Synopsis==
During the course of the books, the boys often use technology (such as ham radios) and science to pull off harebrained schemes. For example, in &quot;The Strange Sea Monster of Strawberry Lake,&quot; they build a fake sea monster out of chicken wire mounted to a canoe, and row it out on Strawberry Lake. When it gets too dangerous to take the boat out on the lake in person, because hunters are preparing to shoot it with an elephant gun, they rig a remote control system to operate it at a distance.

The Mad Scientists&#x27; Club is an Explorer Scout organization, something that is mentioned occasionally in passing, but generally does not drive the stories.

Living in the fictional small town of Mammoth Falls, the members of the Mad Scientists&#x27; Club are:
* Jeff Crocker — President
* Henry Mulligan — Vice President and Chief of Research
* Dinky Poore — the smallest and nimblest
* Freddy Muldoon — the fat boy, but also known as &quot;Little Bright Eyes&quot; because he often notices things that others overlook
* Homer Snodgrass — often uses a flowery style of speaking as he reads a lot of literature
* Mortimer Dalrymple — added to the group because he might have extra radio equipment, and because he was an &quot;electronic bug&quot;
* Charlie Finckledinck — the narrator of the stories

Dinky Poore is the smallest and most sarcastic of the Mad Scientists; this is sometimes relevant to the stories, as in &quot;The Great Gas Bag Race&quot;, in which the boys prepare to compete in a hot-air balloon race without deciding which two Mad Scientists will have the honor of crewing the balloon; since Dinky weighs less than anyone else in the club, he is the only one who is certain of being chosen.

In contrast to the supernatural, mystical, romantic, or preachy moral elements usually found in children&#x27;s books, &quot;The Mad Scientists&#x27; Club&quot; books build their plot devices around science, mechanical inclination, a do it yourself ethic, and some good-natured pranks, making the boys in these books sort of junior precursors to MacGyver, or a fictional counterpart to the real-life &quot;Rocket Boys&quot;. The early stories and the first book in the series were published in the wake of the impact of Sputnik 1 and the Space Race and reflect the thinking of that period. The first book even includes a plug for joining the United States Air Force in the last story, &quot;Night Rescue&quot;. There are two odd, inexplicable exceptions to the usually science-based, non-supernatural nature of the stories. They are &quot;The Secret of the Old Cannon&quot; in the first book — at the end of the story it is hinted the boys unwittingly photographed a ghost — and the Indian Sun Dance from &quot;Big Chief Rainmaker&quot; in the second book. The level of technology found in these books is, of course, low by modern standards, with no commercial home computers or miniaturized electronics, but the technology depicted in the books — home-built computers, scuba, ham radio, helicopters, remotely radio-controlled devices — was, at the time, typical of the cutting edge of technology during the post-World War II, pre-Internet era. The science is accurate; Dinky provides actual Houdini escapology in &quot;The Telltale Transmitter&quot; that readers would do well to remember if they ever found themselves tied up.

Harmon Muldoon is the arch-enemy of the Mad Scientists&#x27; Club. Cousin to Freddy and brother to Homer&#x27;s girlfriend Daphne, Harmon was expelled from the Mad Scientists&#x27; Club &quot;for conduct unbecoming a scientist and for giving away secret information&quot;. Harmon responded by founding his own gang dedicated to interfering with the Mad Scientists&#x27; Club in any way they can. It is not stated whether Harmon&#x27;s gang engages in any activities beyond pestering the Mad Scientists, nor is it absolutely clear how many are in the gang.

Harmon was the radio expert when he was in the club, and has equal if not better radio equipment, as hinted in &quot;The Strange Sea Monster of Strawberry Lake&quot;, where he temporarily jammed the signals sent by The Mad Scientists Club and came very close to unmasking the monster. In &quot;The Great Confrontation&quot; he goes too far and kidnaps Freddy and Dinky. However, Harmon&#x27;s only triumph comes in &quot;The Cool Cavern&quot; where he makes such fools of the Mad Scientists that Henry uncharacteristically loses his temper. In &quot;Big Chief Rainmaker&quot; a truce is declared with Harmon&#x27;s gang because the Mad Scientists need their help. The named members of Harmon&#x27;s gang are:
* Harmon Muldoon — the gang leader. He is a radio expert and &quot;a big blabbermouth&quot;.
* Stony Martin — a &quot;loudmouth&quot;. The gang meets at the back of his house.
* Buzzy McCauliffe
* Joe Turner
* Speedie Brown — &quot;one of the best tree climbers in Harmon&#x27;s gang&quot;.

Harmon&#x27;s gang meets on the second story of an old garage at the back of Stony Martin&#x27;s house. &quot;It&#x27;s a neat place to spy from&quot; for the Mad Scientists Club. Stony and Buzzy are the members who appear the most frequently in the series, as they are constant companions to Harmon.

Other characters include:
* Alonzo Scragg — Mayor of Mammoth Falls
* Abner Sharples — rival of Mayor Scragg, lawyer and politician
* Chief Harold Putney — Chief of Police
* Constable Billy Dahr
* Zeke Boniface — junkyard operator and ally of the Mad Scientists
* Richard the Deep Breather — Zeke&#x27;s truck
* Kaiser Bill — Zeke&#x27;s guard-dog
* Colonel March — military ally of the Mad Scientists
* Elmer Pridgin — a hunter who literally holds the key to &quot;The Secret of the Old Cannon&quot;
* Jim Callahan — city engineer
* Mr. Willis — bank manager
* Seth Hawkins — congressman for Mammoth Falls
* Charlie Brown — town treasurer
* Daphne Muldoon — Harmon&#x27;s sister, Freddy&#x27;s cousin, and Homer&#x27;s girlfriend
* Melissa Plunkett — Stony Martin&#x27;s girlfriend with stick-out teeth
* Mike Corcoran — owner of the Idle Hour Pool Palace; he sponsors Harmon&#x27;s entry in &quot;The Great Gas Bag Race&quot; and keeps the Unidentified Flying Man on display in his front window.
* Mrs. Abner Larrabee — President of the Greater Mammoth Falls Garden Circle, conducts the Indian Sun Dance in &quot;Big Chief Rainmaker&quot;.
* Jason Barnaby — orchardist
* Ned Carver — barber
* Bud Stewart — reporter for the &quot;Cleveland Plain Dealer&quot;.
* Jasper Okeby — truck-garden farmer and the most cantankerous character in Mammoth Falls.
* Bo McSweeney — one of the few athletic heroes of Mammoth Falls and town favorite.
* Matilda Pratt — well-known personality for weighing over 300 pounds and having 13 girls.
* Old Pincushion — the trout nobody can catch.
* Professor Igor Stratavarious — State University professor who takes the Mad Scientists Club to Austria in &quot;The Big Chunk of Ice&quot;.
* Angelina Angelo and Angela Angelino — students who accompany the Mad Scientists to Austria in&quot; The Big Chunk of Ice&quot;. They become the first female members of the club.

==Publication history==
The Mad Scientists began as a series of short stories in &quot;Boys&#x27; Life&quot; magazine, the official youth magazine of the Boy Scouts of America. They were later collected into two volumes, &quot;The Mad Scientists&#x27; Club&quot; and &quot;The New Adventures of the Mad Scientists&#x27; Club&quot;, originally published by the MacRae Smith Company of Philadelphia. Only about 1000 copies of the third novel, &quot;The Big Kerplop!&quot;, were published in 1974 before MacRae Smith went bankrupt, so it is not well known. Later publications in 1965 included Scholastic Book Services in paperback out of New York, London, and Richmond Hill, Ontario.

Sheridan Brinley, the son of the author, authorized Purple House Press to reprint these books starting in 2001. The new edition of &quot;The Big Kerplop!&quot; was released in 2003 (with the exclamation point included), which includes all-new interior illustrations by Geer. The earlier MacRae Smith version is the only Mad Scientists&#x27; Club title without interior drawings since Macrae Smith never commissioned them. On November 17, 2005, Purple House Press released the final book, the previously unpublished second novel titled &quot;The Big Chunk of Ice&quot;, which was newly illustrated by Geer.

==Adaptations==
The 1971 television feature &quot;The Strange Monster of Strawberry Cove&quot; was loosely based on &quot;The Strange Sea Monster of Strawberry Lake&quot;. Starring Burgess Meredith and Agnes Moorehead, the movie had multiple broadcasts as part of &quot;The Wonderful World of Disney&quot;.

<doc id="755594" wikidata="Q2712378" url="?curid=755594" title="2004 European Parliament election in the Netherlands">
<text>An election of Members of the European Parliament representing Netherlands constituency for the 2004–2009 term of the European Parliament was held on 10 June 2004. It was part of the wider 2004 European election. Fifteen parties competed in a D&#x27;Hondt type election for 27 seats (down from 31).

==Background==

===Combined lists===
Several parties combined in one list to take part in this European Election and increase their chance on a seat in the European Parliament.
These combined lists are:
# Christian Union and SGP

===Electoral alliances===
Several parties formed an electoral alliance:
# PvdA/European Social-Democrats and GreenLeft
# CDA/European People&#x27;s Party and Christian Union-SGP
# VVD/European Liberal-Democrats and Democrats 66

The alliance between Christian Democratic Appeal and Christian Union-SGP cost the Christian Democratic Appeal a seat, which goes to Christian Union-SGP. Other alliances had no effect on the result.

===Treaty of Nice===

The exact number of seats allocated to each country is determined by the treaties, currently the Treaty of Nice, and is adjusted by the accession treaty of each new member. Hence no change to the seats occurs without ratification by all states. According to the treaties, the maximum number of members in the Parliament is 732. This why the seats for the Netherlands was reduced from 31 to 27

=== Numbering of the candidates list ===

== Results==

According to the European Commission, the publication of national results prior to Sunday evening is considered illegal. However, all the municipalities in the Netherlands published the results on Thursday, giving the media the opportunity to give an almost complete national result, only missing votes cast abroad. The complete and official result were publicised according to the rules.

The ruling centre-right parties, the Christian Democratic Appeal and the People&#x27;s Party for Freedom and Democracy polled poorly, while the opposition Labour Party and Socialist Party gained ground. The anti-fraud party Europe Transparent of whistleblower Paul van Buitenen unexpectedly won two seats. Voter turnout was 39.26%, a lot higher than the turnout in 1999 30.02%. 

===European groups===
The EPP-ED group lost 2 seats, making it just as big as the PES group. The ELDR becomes 3rd group after PES.
After the elections ELDR and European Democratic Party (EDP) formed a new European Group named ALDE in the European parliament. The EDP did not have member party&#x27;s in the Netherlands. Also the Europe of Democracies and Diversities (EDD) group reforms itself with party&#x27;s from Eastern-Europe. They rename their group to Independence/Democracy (ID).

<doc id="755600" wikidata="Q3946632" url="?curid=755600" title="Samuel Lover">
<text>Samuel Lover (24 February 1797 – 6 July 1868), also known as &quot;Ben Trovato&quot; (&quot;well invented&quot;), was an Irish songwriter, composer and novelist, and a portrait painter, chiefly in miniatures. He was the grandfather of Victor Herbert.

==Life== 
Lover was born at No. 60 Grafton Street, Dublin and went to school at Samuel Whyte&#x27;s at No. 79, which now houses Bewley&#x27;s Café. By 1830 he was Secretary of the Royal Hibernian Academy and living at No. 9 D&#x27;Olier Street. In 1835 he moved to London and began composing music for a series of comic stage works. For some, like the operetta &quot;Il Paddy Whack in Italia&quot; (1841), he contributed libretto and music, for others just a few songs. Before committing himself to a literary career, he enjoyed considerable success as a miniature painter.

Lover produced many Irish songs, of which several, such as &quot;The Angel&#x27;s Whisper&quot;, &quot;Molly Bawn&quot;, and &quot;The Four-leaved Shamrock&quot;, gained popularity. He also wrote novels, of which &quot;Rory O&#x27;Moore&quot; (in its first form a ballad), and &quot;Handy Andy&quot; are best known, and short Irish sketches, which with his songs he combined into a popular entertainment called &quot;Irish Nights&quot; or &quot;Irish Evenings&quot;, with which he toured North America in 1846–1848. He joined Charles Dickens in founding &quot;Bentley&#x27;s Magazine&quot;.

&quot;When once the itch of literature comes over a man, nothing can cure it but the scratching of a pen.&quot; – Samuel Lover

Lover&#x27;s daughter Fanny was mother to Victor Herbert, a composer remembered for many musicals and operettas premièred on Broadway. As a child he lived with the Lovers in a musical environment after the divorce of his mother.

==Death and legacy==

Lover died on 6 July 1868 in Saint Helier, Jersey. A memorial in St Patrick&#x27;s Cathedral, Dublin marks his achievements: &quot;Poet, painter, novelist and composer, who, in the exercise of a genius as distinguished in its versatility as in its power, by his pen and pencil illustrated so happily the characteristics of the peasantry of his country that his name will ever be honourably identified with Ireland.&quot;

===In popular culture===
In the 2013 computer game &quot;BioShock Infinite&quot;, the Lover piece &quot;Saddle The Pony&quot; (from &quot;Rory O&#x27;More&quot;), is heard in Battleship Bay, where Elizabeth is seen dancing to it. It is performed by an accordion player, a violinist and a pianist.

<doc id="755601" wikidata="Q959901" url="?curid=755601" title="2004 European Parliament election in Portugal">
<text>An election of MEPs representing Portugal for the 2004-2009 term of the European Parliament was held on 13 June 2004. It was part of the wider 2004 European election.

The Socialist Party (PS) was the big winner of the elections, achieving their best result in a European election ever. The party won 44.5 percent of the votes, an increase of 1.5 percentage points, and held on to the 12 seats won in 1999. However the Socialist victory, and the campaign overall, was overshadowed by the sudden death of the PS top candidate, António Sousa Franco. Sousa Franco died of a heart attack while campaigning in Matosinhos, just four days before election day. António Costa, number 2 on the list, became the Socialists&#x27; top candidate after Sousa Franco&#x27;s death.

The Social Democrats (PSD) and the People&#x27;s Party (CDS–PP) contested the election in a coalition called &quot;Forward Portugal&quot; (FP). The coalition had a very weak performance, winning just 33 percent of the votes, a big drop compared with the combined total of 39 percent the PSD+CDS had in 1999. The PSD lost two seats, while CDS–PP held on to their two seats.

The Democratic Unity Coalition (CDU) dropped one point and fell below 10 percent of the votes for the first time. CDU was still able to hold on to the two seats they had won in 1999. The Left Bloc (BE) gained a seat for the EU parliament for the first time, and saw its share of vote increase to almost 5 percent, an increase of more than 3 percentage points compared with 1999.

Turnout dropped compared with 1999, with 38.6 percent of voters casting a ballot.

== Electoral system ==
The voting method used for the election of European members of parliament, is proportional representation using the d&#x27;Hondt method, which is known to benefit the largest parties slightly. In the 2004 EU elections, Portugal had 24 seats to be filled. Deputies are elected in a single constituency, corresponding to the entire national territory.

== Parties and candidates ==
The major parties that partook in the election, and their EP list leaders, were:

* Left Bloc (BE), Miguel Portas
* Democratic Unity Coalition (CDU), Ilda Figueiredo
* Socialist Party (PS), António Costa
* Social Democratic Party (PSD)/People&#x27;s Party (CDS–PP) &quot;Força Portugal&quot;, João de Deus Pinheiro

==Campaign period==
===Party slogans===
===Candidates&#x27; debates===
One last debate between the four main candidates was expected to be held on RTP on 10 June, but it was cancelled after the sudden death of the PS lead candidate António Sousa Franco on 9 June. Parties also cut short their campaigns.

<doc id="755603" wikidata="Q10598" url="?curid=755603" title="David James (footballer, born 1970)">
<text>David Benjamin James (born 1 August 1970) is an English former professional footballer who played as a goalkeeper. His most recent position was manager at Kerala Blasters FC in the Indian Super League in 2018. He is also a pundit on Sky Sports football coverage.

James is fifth on the list of all-time Premier League appearances, having played in 572 top-level matches, and held the Premier League record for most clean sheets with 169 until Petr Čech surpassed this record. He holds the record for most penalties saved in Premier League history (13).

He was capped 53 times by England between 1997 and 2010, and was first choice goalkeeper during the team&#x27;s Euro 2004 and the 2010 World Cup campaigns. He was appointed a Member of the Order of the British Empire (MBE) in the 2012 Birthday Honours for services to football and charity.

Having started his career with Watford, James went on to feature in the Premier League for Liverpool, Aston Villa, West Ham United, Manchester City and Portsmouth. He gained a Football League Cup winner&#x27;s medal with Liverpool in 1995, an FA Cup winner&#x27;s medal with Portsmouth in 2008, as well as runners-up medals with Aston Villa in 2000, Liverpool in 1996 and Portsmouth in 2010. In 2010, at the age of 39, he became the oldest goalkeeper to appear in an FA Cup Final. James dropped down a division in 2010 to play for Bristol City and later played for League One side AFC Bournemouth. He joined Icelandic side ÍBV Vestmannaeyjar in 2013 in a joint playing and coaching capacity, before officially retiring.

In October 2013, James took up a coaching position at Luton Town, the club he has supported since his childhood. The following year, he became the marquee player and manager of the newly formed Kerala Blasters. He returned to the club in 2018, being dismissed in December following an 11-match winless run.

== Club career ==

=== Watford ===
Born in Welwyn Garden City, Hertfordshire, James grew up supporting Luton Town. He signed as a trainee with Luton&#x27;s local rivals Watford upon leaving school, and was first selected for the club&#x27;s senior team in 1989. In his days as a youth player, he helped Watford win the FA Youth Cup. Following the departure of Tony Coton, James made his league debut on 25 August 1990 in a 1–2 defeat against Millwall, and his performance resulted in an England U21 call-up for a match against the Republic of Ireland. He earned a total of ten caps for the U21s.

At club level, James made 89 first-team appearances for Watford, and was named the club&#x27;s Player of the Season for the 1990–91 season, when he kept goal in all 46 Second Division games as Watford escaped relegation. He was signed for £1.25m by Liverpool on 6 July 1992. In 2008, James was inducted into the Watford Hall of Fame for his services to the club.

=== Liverpool ===
James made his Liverpool debut on 16 August 1992 in a 0–1 league defeat to Nottingham Forest. After conceding twenty goals in eleven matches in the first half of the 1993–94, he was dropped in favour of veteran Bruce Grobbelaar, but was recalled to the starting line-up and kept his first clean sheet of the season in a 1–0 away win over Arsenal on 31 January 1993, which included a penalty save from Paul Merson. He also received a runners-up medal in 1996 in the FA Cup while being on the losing side against Manchester United.

James rose to fame together with Liverpool teammates Steve McManaman, Jamie Redknapp, and Robbie Fowler, who were nicknamed the &quot;Spice Boys&quot; – an epithet named after the Spice Girls that was used by those who alleged the Liverpool team of the 1990s were more focused on partying than winning games. James&#x27; frequent blunders earned him the nickname &quot;Calamity James&quot;. He put down his spate of errors to an overindulgence in playing computer games that in turn affected his concentration. Despite winning the 1995 Football League Cup, James&#x27; hold on the starting position was put in jeopardy with the acquisition of Brad Friedel. On 23 June 1999, after 277 games for Liverpool, he was sold to Aston Villa for £1.8 million.

=== Aston Villa ===
James made his Villa debut on 7 August 1999, and kept a clean sheet in a 1–0 away win over Newcastle United in the opening Premier League game. He was decisive in a penalty shoot-out against Bolton Wanderers in the 2000 FA Cup semi-final, but conceded Chelsea&#x27;s winning goal in the ensuing final, the last to be staged at the old Wembley.

After just two years and 85 appearances, James moved to West Ham United for £3.5 million on 11 July 2001, signing a four-year contract. However, a serious knee injury sustained while on international duty kept him out for several months.

=== West Ham United ===
James made his debut for West Ham on 24 November 2001 in a 1–0 home loss to Tottenham Hotspur. In 2002–03, West Ham were relegated to the First Division. James stayed with West Ham at the start of the 2003–04 season before returning to the Premier League, signing for Manchester City on 14 January 2004 for an undisclosed fee as a replacement for the retired David Seaman. He played 102 total games in all competitions for West Ham.

=== Manchester City ===

James made his Manchester City debut on 17 January 2004 in a 1–1 home draw with Blackburn Rovers. City won only four of the seventeen matches that James started, two of which came after James saved penalties against Wolverhampton Wanderers and Leicester City. James said that exploring the field of sport psychology improved his skills as a goalkeeper, particularly saving penalty kicks.

On the last day of the 2004–05 season, James was playing for City who needed to beat Middlesbrough to qualify for the UEFA Cup at the opposition&#x27;s expense. With five minutes remaining the score was 1–1, when City&#x27;s manager Stuart Pearce replaced midfielder Claudio Reyna with the substitute goalkeeper Nicky Weaver, and James was moved to play in attack for the remainder of the game. The unusual tactic almost worked when, in injury time, Middlesbrough defender Franck Queudrue conceded a penalty by handling a cross that was aimed at James. However, Robbie Fowler&#x27;s penalty was saved by Middlesbrough goalkeeper Mark Schwarzer, meaning they qualified for the UEFA Cup at City&#x27;s expense.

On 10 August 2006, James, who had separated from his wife, stated that he needed to leave Manchester City to be closer to his children, who lived in London. Manchester City confirmed they had accepted a bid from Portsmouth. Two days later, he joined Portsmouth for £1.2 million, signing a two-year deal.

=== Portsmouth ===

James kept clean sheets in his first five appearances for Portsmouth. On 22 April 2007, James kept his 142nd Premier League clean sheet in a goalless draw with Aston Villa, breaking the record of 141 previously held by David Seaman. At the end of 2006–07, James was named Portsmouth&#x27;s player of the season.

James has made the most league appearances of any goalkeeper since the formation of the Premier League over fifteen seasons, in addition to conceding the most goals. On 30 January 2008, in a league match against Manchester United, he became the third player (after Gary Speed and Ryan Giggs) to cross the 500-match threshold.

James signed a one-year contract extension in May 2007, which kept him at Fratton Park until the end of the 2008–09 season. James won the second major trophy of his career during that season, as Portsmouth claimed a 1–0 victory over Cardiff City at Wembley Stadium in the 2008 FA Cup Final. On 8 November 2008, he made his 100th appearance for Portsmouth.

He holds the distinction of twice having been the record holder for consecutive Premier League appearances, with 159 during his Liverpool days from February 1994 to February 1998, and 166 between Manchester City and Portsmouth from 2006 to 2008; both streaks were eventually topped by Chelsea&#x27;s Frank Lampard and Tottenham Hotspur&#x27;s Brad Friedel, respectively.

James had the significant distinction of being named as the Goalkeeper in the PFA Premier League Team of the Year in 2008, one of only 2 players outside the &quot;Big 4&quot; clubs to be named.

On 14 February 2009 against Manchester City, James made his 536th Premier League appearance, breaking Gary Speed&#x27;s all-time record.

On 22 April 2009, Times Online named James as the 15th greatest player in Portsmouth&#x27;s history.

James captained Portsmouth in the FA Cup semi-final against Tottenham Hotspur where Portsmouth won 2–0 in extra time, describing the experience as &quot;superb&quot;. He also captained the team in the final as Portsmouth were beaten 1–0 by double winners Chelsea.

His contract expired at the end of the 2009–10 season, and he expressed interest in succeeding Avram Grant as Portsmouth manager, though this came to nothing. The club offered him a new playing contract, but withdrew the offer after he failed to commit to the club; therefore, James left Portsmouth and became a free agent.

=== Bristol City ===

James signed a one-year contract with Championship side Bristol City on 30 July 2010, with the option of a second year. He stated that he hoped that his performances at the club would keep him on the radar for the England team and that his decision to join them was motivated by a desire to be closer to his family home in Devon.

James&#x27; league debut for Bristol City came on 7 August 2010 in a 3–0 defeat to Millwall. On 11 February 2011, the eve of his 850th club appearance, James announced he had signed a contract extension with the club until June 2012. On 10 March 2012, James reached 900 club appearances in a game against Cardiff City in the Severnside derby, in which he was made captain as a mark of respect.

He was released by Bristol City on 1 May 2012, and in July 2012 began training with Exeter City.

=== AFC Bournemouth ===
On 27 September 2012, he arrived at Dean Court to train with AFC Bournemouth, signing a one-year deal to play for them the following day. However, he did not see out the contract, leaving the club by mutual consent in March 2013 after making 19 appearances.

=== ÍBV Vestmannaeyjar ===
On 2 April 2013, James signed a contract with Icelandic club ÍBV until the end of the 2013 season in a joint player/coach capacity. He linked up with former Portsmouth teammate Hermann Hreiðarsson, the manager of ÍBV. The ÍBV chairman stated that James was not being paid high wages, and that he was primarily playing out of kindness and to gain coaching experience. His arrival at ÍBV saw much higher attendances than in previous years. ÍBV ended the season in sixth position, and James announced his retirement from playing.

=== Kerala Blasters and retirement ===
He was signed by Kerala Blasters FC, owned by Sachin Tendulkar, for the 2014 Indian Super League season as a player-manager. He said &quot;I hope my involvement with ISL will be the start of something great.&quot; The team&#x27;s first fixture on 13 October, in which James played, resulted in a 1–0 defeat at NorthEast United. His team eventually became the runners up in the inaugural ISL tournament by losing to Atletico de Kolkata 1–0 in the finals. James retired at the end of the season.

== International career ==
=== Youth career and early senior career ===
After making one England under-21 appearance whilst at Watford, James made his full debut for Glenn Hoddle&#x27;s England in a friendly against Mexico on 29 March 1997 when he was a Liverpool player. He kept his first international clean sheet as England beat Mexico 2–0 with goals from Teddy Sheringham and James&#x27; Liverpool teammate Robbie Fowler. He was in the provisional 28-man squad for Euro 2000 before missing the final cut.

James is the only black goalkeeper to represent England as a full international.

=== Years of rotation and Euro 2004 ===
James was selected by Sven-Göran Eriksson for his 23-man squad for the 2002 FIFA World Cup. He was third choice behind David Seaman and Nigel Martyn, as the veteran Arsenal goalkeeper played in all five of England&#x27;s games.

For several years he had to play understudy to England&#x27;s regular keeper, David Seaman. When Seaman was dropped after making a mistake against FYR Macedonia in 2002, James became the new England number one. He retained his place in the England team even after West Ham&#x27;s relegation to the First Division in 2003, and was the only player from outside the top flight to win an England cap between 1999 (Michael Gray) and 2007 (David Nugent). He went on to play in all of England&#x27;s matches at Euro 2004.

James was dropped from the starting XI, his place being taken by Tottenham&#x27;s Paul Robinson. James came on as a half-time substitute and conceded all four goals in the 4–1 drubbing England suffered at the hands of Denmark during a friendly on 17 August 2005 – their worst defeat in 25 years. James still remained part of the England squad, and was selected as the second-choice goalkeeper behind Robinson for the 2006 World Cup in Germany, though he did not play.

Along with fellow veterans David Beckham and Sol Campbell, James was dropped from the England squad at the start of Steve McClaren&#x27;s reign and was not called up during the 2006–07 season. He was recalled for the friendly with Germany on 22 August 2007, over a year since first being omitted. James played the whole of the second half of England&#x27;s 2–1 defeat to Germany as a substitute for Robinson. In so doing, he became the first Portsmouth player to play for the senior England team since Mark Hateley in 1984. However, Scott Carson was chosen ahead of both James and Robinson for the decisive Euro 2008 qualifier against Croatia on 21 November 2007. England lost the match 2-3, partly due to a fumble by Carson, which gifted Croatia the game&#x27;s opening goal. Following England&#x27;s failure to qualify for Euro 2008 McClaren was sacked as England manager and replaced by Fabio Capello. James was subsequently critical of McClaren&#x27;s treatment of England&#x27;s goalkeepers.

=== 2010 World Cup cycle ===
On 7 February 2008, James was selected as goalkeeper for Capello&#x27;s first match in charge, a friendly against Switzerland. It was his first start for England since a friendly with Colombia in May 2005. James firmly re-established himself as England&#x27;s first choice goalkeeper, starting in each of Capello&#x27;s first 13 games in charge. Persistent injury problems over the following year left James&#x27; hopes of retaining the No. 1 spot for the 2010 World Cup in doubt, with Capello stating he would only consider players who were 100% fit for his squad. After the World Cup qualifier against Ukraine on 1 April 2009, James did not start a match for England until the final friendly before the World Cup against Japan on 30 May 2010.

Prior to the tournament, James was backed to reclaim the number one shirt by former England goalkeepers Gordon Banks and David Seaman.

On 3 June 2010, it was confirmed that James would be travelling to the World Cup Finals in South Africa, and would be allocated the number 1 jersey. He was the oldest footballer in the tournament. James was not selected for the first game of the World Cup against the United States, with Robert Green instead starting in the England goal. However, Green made an error that allowed Clint Dempsey to score an equaliser that resulted in the game being drawn. James returned to the starting line-up in the next game, keeping a clean sheet against Algeria on 18 June 2010. In doing so James became the oldest ever World Cup debutant at 39 years and 321 days old. Five days later, he kept another clean sheet as England won against Slovenia 1–0 to ensure that they would reach the last 16, although they finished second in Group C behind the United States. They were eliminated in the following round after a 4–1 defeat to Germany.

== Style of play ==

James was an aggressive and imposing goalkeeper, who was known for his excellent shot-stopping ability and ability to produce long throws, as well as his professionalism, leadership, and ability to organise his defence; however, he also came under criticism in the media for his perceived poor decision–making and distribution with his feet, although he was able to improve upon this aspect of his game as his career progressed. His ability to claim crosses was also cited as a weakness in his gameplay. His inconsistency and error–prone performances led to him being nicknamed &quot;Calamity James&quot; in the media. In his youth, his role model was Italian goalkeeper Dino Zoff. James was also known for his penalty-stopping abilities.

== Coaching career ==
Commenting on the comparatively low numbers of black players who become managers in English football, James said in 2012 that &quot;I struggle with the racist issue in football because I don&#x27;t see it, and that&#x27;s not because I&#x27;ve got my head in the sand. In the earlier days, yes, but the game&#x27;s changed...If you don&#x27;t want to go, an [&quot;sic&quot;] moan about not getting jobs, well, probably because you haven&#x27;t been on the course is the reason why you haven&#x27;t got a job.&quot;

=== ÍBV ===
James served as a player-coach for manager Hermann Hreiðarsson at ÍBV in the Icelandic Úrvalsdeild karla during the 2013 season.

=== Luton Town ===
Following his stint at ÍBV, James joined Luton Town in October 2013 in a coaching capacity in order to gain experience towards a UEFA A-licence qualification.

=== Kerala Blasters ===
James was the player-manager of Kerala Blasters FC in the Indian Super League 2014 season. Utilising a distinctly British identity, signing players such as Stephen Pearson and Michael Chopra, he took them to the ISL playoffs at the first attempt, after a 4th-place finish in the league phase. In the playoffs, extra time was needed to see off Chennaiyin 4–3 on aggregate, taking James and Kerala Blasters to the 2014 Indian Super League final, only to lose 1–0 to Atlético de Kolkata. James left the club at the end of his contract.

James returned to the helm of the club as their head coach a day after the sacking of Rene Meulensteen on 3 January 2018, following a string of poor performances. He set about rebuilding the side in the January transfer window, releasing Mark Sifneos and signing Iceland international midfielder Guðjón Baldvinsson on loan from Stjarnan, along with appointing former Portsmouth teammate Hermann Hreiðarsson as his assistant. Despite overseeing a turnaround in form, he could only guide the Blasters to 6th place at the end the 2017–18 Indian Super League season, missing out on the play-offs.

The club started the 2018–19 Indian Super League season with a victory, beating ATK 2–0 at Salt Lake Stadium. However this was followed by an 11-match winless run, which resulted in James&#x27; sacking in December 2018

=== Þróttur Vogum ===
In July 2020, James served as an assistant coach to Hermann Hreiðarsson with Icelandic club Þróttur Vogum for one game.

== Personal life ==

James was brought up in Welwyn Garden City, attending the Sir Frederic Osborn School. He is of mixed Jamaican and English descent, and spent part of his childhood in Jamaica. He has four children with his former wife Tanya, whom he divorced in 2005, and as of June 2007 lived in Chudleigh, Devon with his partner, Amanda Salmon.

James has gained attention for modelling assignments, first with Giorgio Armani in 1995, and with H&amp;M in 2005.

James was known for experimenting with his hairstyle. In May 2007, a &quot;Who Ate All the Pies&quot; column ridiculed him, among David Beckham and others, for &quot;backcombed efforts&quot;, and likened a previous November 2006 cut to fictional character Clark Kent, both captured by BBC &quot;Match of the Day&quot;.

During the 2003 off-season, James was a guest at the training camp of American football team the Miami Dolphins, where he studied their training and conditioning methods.

James was a 20-a-day smoker during his early career, having taken up the habit while sidelined with injury at the age of 15 and quit for the new millennium. He fronted an anti-smoking campaign in 2008.

=== Charity work ===
In 2005, James visited the south eastern African nation of Malawi to help raise AIDS awareness. He subsequently set up the David James Foundation in order to help maize farmers in Malawi develop more efficient production techniques. The foundation also aims to give teenagers the skills, such as mechanical and construction skills, needed to go out and work. James has also made connections with West Exe Technology College, Exeter. This college has brought to his attention the Malawian charity, Friends of Mulanje Orphans. The foundation funds the David James Foundation Scholarship at the University of Westminster, which funds a student from Malawi to study for a master&#x27;s degree at Westminster. The charity has been supported by the Institution of Chemical Engineers (IChemE). James is also a global ambassador for the Special Olympics and works with Access Sport to provide sports provision in deprived areas of the United Kingdom.

In March 2024, James played for AFC Hutwood against Madeinheath United in the City of Southampton Sunday Football League Division One as a goodwill gesture after the club donated a number of football boots to the Football Rebooted charity of which he was an ambassador. He played the first half in goal and the second half outfield, scoring the winner with a free kick in a 2–1 victory.

=== Art and writing ===
James is an artist, and has auctioned several of his paintings for charity. He was the featured painter in episode three of the fourth series of &quot;Extraordinary Portraits&quot;, when he painted Gill Sayell. James also illustrated the children&#x27;s book &quot;Harry&#x27;s Magic Pockets: The Circus&quot; written by his friend, Steve Pearson.

He writes a regular column for &quot;The Observer&quot; newspaper, and donates his article fee to charity.

=== Bankruptcy ===
In May 2014, James was declared bankrupt. Despite earning an estimated £20m from his footballing career, owning several properties and having a lucrative contract modeling for Armani, James&#x27; debts had built up since his divorce from his wife, Tanya, in 2005.

In November 2014, James placed for sale hundreds of items of football memorabilia collected during his career, to pay off the debts. Items included 150 signed shirts, shorts and match balls as well as his customised Vauxhall Astra van and Raleigh Chopper bikes.

== Media career ==
Shortly before Euro 2012, James presented a BBC programme entitled &quot;Euro&#x27;s Most Shocking Moments&quot; alongside Richard Bacon. He was also a pundit for the channel at the tournament in Poland and Ukraine.

James was one of BT Sport&#x27;s first pundits in 2013. James worked as a pundit for Eurosport at the 2014 FIFA World Cup, and for India&#x27;s Sony Ten at the 2018 FIFA World Cup. On 6 June 2021, James presented &quot;Football Scores with David James&quot; on classical music radio station Scala Radio.

James was a contestant on the seventeenth series of &quot;Strictly Come Dancing&quot; in 2019. He was partnered with Nadiya Bychkova and was the fourth celebrity to be eliminated after a dance-off with Mike Bushell and Katya Jones.

James has been a guest on television game shows, including &quot;Countdown&quot; (2016), &quot;Go 8 Bit&quot; (2016), &quot;Richard Osman&#x27;s House of Games&quot; (2020) and &quot;Celebrity Catchphrase&quot; (2021). In March 2021, he won £1,250 for a homeless people&#x27;s charity on &quot;Pointless Celebrities&quot;. In 2022, James competed on &quot;Celebrity Mastermind&quot; with his specialist subject being the artist Roy Lichtenstein. In that same year he appeared on a Soccer Aid edition of &quot;The Chase: Celebrity Special&quot;, breaking the celebrity record for most questions answered during the cash-builder segment of the show. He made another appearance on The Chase: Celebrity Special in 2023.

In November 2024, James was announced to be a contestant in the 2025 &quot;Taskmaster&quot;&#x27;s New Year Treat special episode, alongside Hannah Fry, Martin Lewis, Melanie Blatt, and Sue Johnston.

<text>In mathematics, the complexification of a vector space over the field of real numbers (a &quot;real vector space&quot;) yields a vector space over the complex number field, obtained by formally extending the scaling of vectors by real numbers to include their scaling (&quot;multiplication&quot;) by complex numbers. Any basis for (a space over the real numbers) may also serve as a basis for over the complex numbers.

== Formal definition ==
Let formula_1 be a real vector space. The of is defined by taking the tensor product of formula_1 with the complex numbers (thought of as a 2-dimensional vector space over the reals):

:formula_3

The subscript, formula_4, on the tensor product indicates that the tensor product is taken over the real numbers (since formula_1 is a real vector space this is the only sensible option anyway, so the subscript can safely be omitted). As it stands, formula_6 is only a real vector space. However, we can make formula_6 into a complex vector space by defining complex multiplication as follows:

:formula_8

More generally, complexification is an example of extension of scalars – here extending scalars from the real numbers to the complex numbers – which can be done for any field extension, or indeed for any morphism of rings.

Formally, complexification is a functor , from the category of real vector spaces to the category of complex vector spaces. This is the adjoint functor – specifically the left adjoint – to the forgetful functor forgetting the complex structure.

This forgetting of the complex structure of a complex vector space formula_1 is called &#x27; (or sometimes &quot;&#x27;&quot;). The decomplexification of a complex vector space formula_1 with basis formula_11 removes the possibility of complex multiplication of scalars, thus yielding a real vector space formula_12 of twice the dimension with a basis formula_13

== Basic properties ==
By the nature of the tensor product, every vector in can be written uniquely in the form
:formula_14
where and are vectors in . It is a common practice to drop the tensor product symbol and just write
:formula_15
Multiplication by the complex number is then given by the usual rule
:formula_16
We can then regard as the direct sum of two copies of :
:formula_17
with the above rule for multiplication by complex numbers.

There is a natural embedding of into given by
:formula_18
The vector space may then be regarded as a &quot;real&quot; subspace of . If has a basis (over the field ) then a corresponding basis for is given by over the field . The complex dimension of is therefore equal to the real dimension of :

:formula_19

Alternatively, rather than using tensor products, one can use this direct sum as the &quot;definition&quot; of the complexification:
:formula_20
where formula_6 is given a linear complex structure by the operator defined as formula_22 where encodes the operation of “multiplication by ”. In matrix form, is given by:
:formula_23
This yields the identical space – a real vector space with linear complex structure is identical data to a complex vector space – though it constructs the space differently. Accordingly, formula_6 can be written as formula_25 or formula_26 identifying with the first direct summand. This approach is more concrete, and has the advantage of avoiding the use of the technically involved tensor product, but is ad hoc.

== Examples ==
* The complexification of real coordinate space is the complex coordinate space .
* Likewise, if consists of the matrices with real entries, would consist of matrices with complex entries.

== Dickson doubling ==

The process of complexification by moving from to was abstracted by twentieth-century mathematicians including Leonard Dickson. One starts with using the identity mapping as a trivial involution on . Next two copies of R are used to form with the complex conjugation introduced as the involution . Two elements and in the doubled set multiply by
:formula_27
Finally, the doubled set is given a norm . When starting from with the identity involution, the doubled set is with the norm .
If one doubles , and uses conjugation (&quot;a,b&quot;)* = (&quot;a&quot;*, –&quot;b&quot;), the construction yields quaternions. Doubling again produces octonions, also called Cayley numbers. It was at this point that Dickson in 1919 contributed to uncovering algebraic structure.

The process can also be initiated with and the trivial involution . The norm produced is simply , unlike the generation of by doubling . When this is doubled it produces bicomplex numbers, and doubling that produces biquaternions, and doubling again results in bioctonions. When the base algebra is associative, the algebra produced by this Cayley–Dickson construction is called a composition algebra since it can be shown that it has the property
:formula_28

== Complex conjugation ==
The complexified vector space has more structure than an ordinary complex vector space. It comes with a canonical complex conjugation map:
:formula_29
defined by
:formula_30 
The map may either be regarded as a conjugate-linear map from to itself or as a complex linear isomorphism from to its complex conjugate formula_31.

Conversely, given a complex vector space with a complex conjugation , is isomorphic as a complex vector space to the complexification of the real subspace
:formula_32
In other words, all complex vector spaces with complex conjugation are the complexification of a real vector space.

For example, when with the standard complex conjugation
:formula_33
the invariant subspace is just the real subspace .

== Linear transformations ==
Given a real linear transformation between two real vector spaces there is a natural complex linear transformation
:formula_34
given by
:formula_35
The map formula_36 is called the complexification of &quot;f&quot;. The complexification of linear transformations satisfies the following properties
*formula_37
*formula_38
*formula_39
*formula_40

In the language of category theory one says that complexification defines an (additive) functor from the category of real vector spaces to the category of complex vector spaces.

The map commutes with conjugation and so maps the real subspace of &quot;V&quot; to the real subspace of (via the map ). Moreover, a complex linear map is the complexification of a real linear map if and only if it commutes with conjugation.

As an example consider a linear transformation from to thought of as an matrix. The complexification of that transformation is exactly the same matrix, but now thought of as a linear map from to .

==Dual spaces and tensor products==

The dual of a real vector space is the space of all real linear maps from to . The complexification of can naturally be thought of as the space of all real linear maps from to (denoted ). That is,
formula_41

The isomorphism is given by
formula_42
where and are elements of . Complex conjugation is then given by the usual operation
formula_43

Given a real linear map we may extend by linearity to obtain a complex linear map . That is,
formula_44
This extension gives an isomorphism from to . The latter is just the &quot;complex&quot; dual space to , so we have a natural isomorphism:
formula_45

More generally, given real vector spaces and there is a natural isomorphism
formula_46

Complexification also commutes with the operations of taking tensor products, exterior powers and symmetric powers. For example, if and are real vector spaces there is a natural isomorphism
formula_47
Note the left-hand tensor product is taken over the reals while the right-hand one is taken over the complexes. The same pattern is true in general. For instance, one has
formula_48
In all cases, the isomorphisms are the “obvious” ones.

<doc id="755615" wikidata="Q1972579" url="?curid=755615" title="Poundal">
<text>The poundal (symbol: pdl) is a unit of force, introduced in 1877, that is part of the Absolute English system of units, which itself is a coherent subsystem of the foot–pound–second system.

:formula_1
The poundal is defined as the force necessary to accelerate 1 pound-mass at 1 foot per second squared.
1 pdl = exactly.

== Background ==
English units require re-scaling of either force or mass to eliminate a numerical proportionality constant in the equation &quot;F = ma&quot;. The poundal represents one choice, which is to rescale units of force. Since a pound of &quot;force&quot; (pound force) accelerates a pound of &quot;mass&quot; (pound mass) at 32.174 049 ft/s2 (9.80665 m/s2; the acceleration of gravity, &quot;g&quot;), we can scale down the unit of force to compensate, giving us one that accelerates 1 pound mass at 1 ft/s2 rather than at 32.174 049 ft/s2; and that is the poundal, which is approximately pound force.
For example, a force of 1200 poundals is required to accelerate a person of 150 pounds mass at 8 feet per second squared:
formula_2

The poundal-as-force, pound-as-mass system is contrasted with an alternative system in which pounds are used as &quot;force&quot; (pounds-force), and instead, the &quot;mass&quot; unit is rescaled by a factor of roughly 32. That is, one pound-force will accelerate one pound-mass at 32 feet per second squared; we can scale &quot;up&quot; the unit of &quot;mass&quot; to compensate, which will be accelerated by 1 ft/s2 (rather than 32 ft/s2) given the application of one pound force; this gives us a unit of mass called the slug, which is about 32 pounds mass. Using this system (slugs and pounds-force), the above expression could be expressed as:
formula_3

Note: Slugs () and poundals (1/) are never used in the same system, since they are opposite solutions of the same problem.

Rather than changing either force or mass units, one may choose to express acceleration in units of the acceleration due to Earth&#x27;s gravity (called &quot;g&quot;). In this case, we can keep both pounds-mass and pounds-force, such that applying one pound force to one pound mass accelerates it at one unit of acceleration (&quot;g&quot;):
formula_4

Expressions derived using poundals for force and lb for mass (or lbf for force and slugs for mass) have the advantage of not being tied to conditions on the surface of the earth. Specifically, computing on the moon or in deep space as poundals, lb⋅ft/s2 or avoids the constant tied to acceleration of gravity on earth.

<text>Frederick Ferdinand Low (June 30, 1828July 21, 1894) was an American politician and diplomat who served as the ninth governor of California from 1863 to 1867. He was previously a member of the United States House of Representatives from 1862 to 1863, and later in life was appointed United States Minister to China, where he served from 1869 to 1873.

==Early life and education==
Born in Frankfort (now Winterport, Maine) in 1828, Low attended the Hampden Academy in Hampden, Maine.

== Career ==
Low moved to California, entering the shipping business in San Francisco in 1849. Low became a banker in Marysville, California from 1854 from 1861.

Low presented credentials as a Republican Member-elect to the 37th Congress but was not permitted to take his seat until a special act of Congress was passed. He served as a member of the U.S. House of Representatives from June 3, 1862 to March 3, 1863.

Low was appointed in 1863 as collector of the Port of San Francisco, and later that year was elected the 9th Governor of California, serving from December 10, 1863 to December 5, 1867. He was the second California governor to live in the Stanford Mansion as the official residence and office until the opening of the California State Capitol in 1869. Low was California&#x27;s last Civil War governor. Hallmarks of his administration were the establishment of Yosemite National Park and University of California. Low was considered the father of the University of California, though his successor, Henry H. Haight, signed the Charter of the University.

Low served as United States Minister to China from 1869 to 1874.

== Personal life ==
He died in San Francisco on July 21, 1894. He is buried in the Cypress Lawn Memorial Park in Colma.

<text>Bertrand R. Brinley (19 June 1917 in Hudson, New York – 20 October 1994 in Luray, Virginia) was an American writer of short stories and children&#x27;s tales. He was best known for his &quot;Mad Scientists&#x27; Club&quot; stories.

The stories in &quot;The Mad Scientists&#x27; Club&quot; originally appeared over several years in &quot;Boys&#x27; Life&quot; magazine, starting in 1961, and were later collected into book form. &quot;The Mad Scientists&#x27; Club&quot;, &quot;The New Adventures of The Mad Scientists&#x27; Club&quot; and &quot;The Big Kerplop!&quot; were first published by the now-defunct MacRae Smith Company of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Much of the character of Mammoth Falls, the fictional town where the Mad Scientists&#x27; adventures take place, was based on the town of West Newbury, Massachusetts, where Brinley lived during part of his youth and where he graduated from high school in 1935. West Newbury contributed a good many place names and several of the characters to the Mad Scientists&#x27; Club stories.

They have since been republished by Purple House Press in Cynthiana, Kentucky. Brinley&#x27;s final work, &quot;The Big Chunk of Ice&quot;, was published posthumously in 2005 by Purple House Press with permission from his son, Sheridan Brinley.

<doc id="755626" wikidata="Q3586871" url="?curid=755626" title="2004 European Parliament election in Spain">
<text>The 2004 European Parliament election in Spain was held on Sunday, 13 June 2004, as part of the EU-wide election to elect the 6th European Parliament. All 54 seats allocated to Spain as per the Treaty of Nice were up for election.

The election saw a close race between the centre-left Spanish Socialist Workers&#x27; Party (PSOE), which had accessed power earlier in April in the wake of the 11M train bombings leading up to the 14 March general election, and the centre-right People&#x27;s Party (PP), still reeling from its election defeat. It marked the only time the PSOE emerged as the largest party in a European Parliament election in Spain between 1989 and 2019. It also saw a considerable drop in turnout down to 45.1%, the lowest up until that point—a figure that would be outmatched by the turnout in the two subsequent European Parliament elections, 2009 (44.9%) and 2014 (43.8%).

==Electoral system==
54 members of the European Parliament were allocated to Spain as per the Treaty of Nice. Voting was on the basis of universal suffrage, which comprised all nationals and resident non-national European citizens over 18 years of age and in full enjoyment of their political rights.

All seats were elected using the D&#x27;Hondt method and a closed list proportional representation, with no electoral threshold being applied to be entitled to enter seat distribution. Seats were allocated to a single multi-member constituency comprising the entire national territory. The use of the electoral method resulted in an effective threshold based on the district magnitude and the distribution of votes among candidacies.

==Outgoing delegation==

==Parties and candidates==
The electoral law allowed for parties and federations registered in the interior ministry, coalitions and groupings of electors to present lists of candidates. Parties and federations intending to form a coalition ahead of an election were required to inform the relevant Electoral Commission within ten days of the election call. In order to be entitled to run, parties, federations, coalitions and groupings of electors needed to secure the signature of at least 15,000 registered electors; this requirement could be lifted and replaced through the signature of at least 50 elected officials—deputies, senators, MEPs or members from the legislative assemblies of autonomous communities or from local city councils. Electors and elected officials were disallowed from signing for more than one list of candidates.

Below is a list of the main parties and electoral alliances which contested the election:

The abertzale left tried to run under the umbrella of the &quot;Herritarren Zerrenda&quot; list (Basque for &quot;Citizens&#x27; List&quot;). However, the Spanish Supreme Court annulled HZ lists and banned them from running on 22 May 2004, as it considered that the candidacy&#x27;s promoters and half of its candidates had links with the outlawed Batasuna and with the ETA environment.

==Opinion polls==
The tables below list opinion polling results in reverse chronological order, showing the most recent first and using the dates when the survey fieldwork was done, as opposed to the date of publication. Where the fieldwork dates are unknown, the date of publication is given instead. The highest percentage figure in each polling survey is displayed with its background shaded in the leading party&#x27;s colour. If a tie ensues, this is applied to the figures with the highest percentages. The &quot;Lead&quot; column on the right shows the percentage-point difference between the parties with the highest percentages in a poll.

===Voting intention estimates===
The table below lists weighted voting intention estimates. Refusals are generally excluded from the party vote percentages, while question wording and the treatment of &quot;don&#x27;t know&quot; responses and those not intending to vote may vary between polling organisations. When available, seat projections determined by the polling organisations are displayed below (or in place of) the percentages in a smaller font.


===Voting preferences===
The table below lists raw, unweighted voting preferences.

===Victory preferences===
The table below lists opinion polling on the victory preferences for each party in the event of a European Parliament election taking place.

===Victory likelihood===
The table below lists opinion polling on the perceived likelihood of victory for each party in the event of a European Parliament election taking place.

<text>Old Sheffield Plate (or OSP) is the name generally given to the material developed by Thomas Boulsover in the 1740s, a fusion of copper and sterling silver which could be made into a range of items normally made in solid silver. The material rapidly gained popularity as a substitute for solid silver, as it was much cheaper to produce. Any object made in silver could in effect be made in Old Sheffield Plate, although objects subject to heavy wear such as spoons and forks were not so satisfactory in plate. 

The characteristic identifying feature of OSP is the &#x27;bleeding&#x27; or &#x27;show through&#x27; of the copper base, especially on points of wear although there is also a subtle difference in colour from the pure silver of electro plating to the &quot;very faintly bluish lustre&quot; of OSP. In addition to having a distinct bluish cast, the alloy produced in OSP is also harder than electrodeposited silver. The material remained popular until being replaced by the electroplate process in the 1840s.

Items produced in Old Sheffield Plate included buttons, caddy spoons, fish slices, serving utensils, candlesticks and other lighting devices, coffee and tea sets, serving dishes and trays, tankards and pitchers and larger items such as soup tureens and hot-water urns.

&#x27;Old Sheffield Plate&#x27; with all three word capitalised is the accepted term in the antiques trade for this material. The expression &#x27;Sheffield plate&#x27; and all variations thereof are generic terms which may apply to any product of silver appearance made in Sheffield, UK.

==History==
The fact that silver and copper could fuse together was almost certainly well known to Sheffield silver makers, as silver based solder (an amalgam of silver, copper and zinc) was widely used. Boulsover&#x27;s discovery or invention was to find that sheets of silver and copper under high pressure would fuse together when heated to the melting point of the silver-copper eutectic alloy, then could be rolled out and shaped without the layers separating. The material could be rolled out to a thinness appropriate for the making of silver items. As far less silver was needed, the price of these items was far lower.

It is said that the material was accidentally invented by Thomas Boulsover, of Sheffield&#x27;s Cutlers Company, in 1743, but this attribution is probably anecdotal. It was said that while trying to repair the handle of a customer&#x27;s decorative knife, he heated it too much and the silver started to melt. When he examined the damaged handle, he noticed that the silver and copper had fused together very strongly. Experiments showed that the two metals behaved as one when he tried to reshape them, even though he could clearly see the two different layers. 

Boulsover set up in business, funded by Strelley Pegge of Beauchief, and carried out further experiments in which he put a thin sheet of silver on a thick ingot of copper and heated the two together to fuse them. When the composite block was hammered or rolled to make it thinner, the two metals were reduced in thickness at similar rates. Using this method, Boulsover was able to make sheets of metal which had a thin layer of silver on the top surface and a thick layer of copper underneath. When this new material was used to make buttons, they looked and behaved like silver buttons but were a fraction of the cost.

The main centre for the trade was always Sheffield, England, where there was already a substantial manufacturing industry for making small silver items such as buttons, cutlery and snuff boxes etc. Following Boulsover&#x27;s discovery, the trade rapidly expanded particularly from the 1760s onwards. The other centre of production in England became Birmingham, almost entirely through the efforts of Matthew Boulton. While Boulton&#x27;s ormolu and solid silver products tend to attract most attention, his button and plated wares manufacturing were financially always more important.

== Techniques ==

=== Double plating ===
Double plating or sometimes the &#x27;double sandwich&#x27; form of Sheffield plate was developed around 1770. Used for pieces such as bowls and mugs that had a visible interior, it consisted of a sheet of silver each side of a piece of copper; early manufacturers applied a film of solder over the bare edge of copper although such pieces are very rare. Edges of early salvers were hidden by folding them over but from about 1790, borders were applied with U-shaped lengths of silver wire to conceal the copper which can often be felt as a lip on the underside. Towards the end of the period, solid wire was sometimes used which can be hard to see.

=== Die stamping, plated wire and other techniques ===
The whole process of OSP manufacture was complex and involved a number of techniques. &quot;Die stamping&quot; was used extensively for shaping the basic sheets of OSP and also for forming small parts such as feet and handles. The manufacture of &quot;plated wire&quot; was another important technique, involving coating a circular rod of copper with silver. This could then be &#x27;drawn out&#x27; to produce not only circular wire but also various profiles, such as the arms of candelabra. Plated wire was used extensively for items such as cake baskets, but also for finishing the edges of items such as snuffer trays by creating U-shaped sections which could cover the bare copper edges. A further technique allowed &quot;gadrooned&quot; edging to be created. &quot;Pierced work&quot; was very common, again methods were developed to conceal the bare edges of the copper.

== Later practice ==
Following the invention of German silver (60% copper, 20% nickel and 20% zinc), around 1820, it was found that this new material also fused well with sheet silver and provided a suitable base metal for the Sheffield process. Because of its nearly silver colour, German silver also revealed less wear, or &quot;bleeding&quot;, when Sheffield-made articles were subject to daily use and polishing. Being much harder than copper, it was used from the mid-1830s but only for articles such as trays or cylindrical items that did not require complex shaping.

After about 1840 the Sheffield plate process was generally replaced with electroplating processes, such as that of George Elkington. Electroplating tends to produce a &quot;brilliant&quot; surface with a hard colour – as it consists of pure rather than sterling silver and is usually deposited more thinly. Sheffield plate continued to be used for up to a further 100 years for silver-plated articles subject to heavy wear, most commonly uniform buttons and tankards. During the 1840–1850 period, hybrid articles such as sugar bowls were produced, with the body being Old Sheffield Plate and complicated small parts such as the feet and handles made from electroplate. These are rare and seldom recognised. The Sheffield plating process is not often used today. During the Second World War, a process analogous to Sheffield plating was used to build intercoolers for Rolls-Royce Merlin engines to overcome problems with thermal fracturing.

==Replating and recognition==
Much Old Sheffield Plate seen today has been re-plated, especially items which received much use and polishing, such as candlesticks. Items seldom displayed or used, such as egg cruets or soufflé dishes, are often in excellent condition and so may be confused with electroplate. Collectors should be aware that many designs have been reproduced in electroplate, with those from the early 1900s being the hardest to recognise since, like the original items, they seldom have a maker&#x27;s mark. The way to recognise the genuine article is to look for signs that it was soldered from pre-plated metal sheet or wire rather than constructed in base metal and plated afterwards. Soldered joints, often well-disguised by the experts of the time, are also a hallmark of Sheffield plate.

==Terminology==
The term &quot;Sheffield plate&quot; is widely used by those dealing in electroplate produced in Sheffield, and most collectors prefer to use the term &quot;Old Sheffield Plate&quot; to identify the early fused plate product. &quot;Close Plated&quot; ware consists of silver foil soldered onto a steel base and was used for items such as candle snuffers or cutlery requiring greater strength than fused plate. It was produced from the eighteenth to the twentieth century.

<text>USS &quot;Permit&quot; (SSN-594) became the lead ship of her class of submarines when the former lead ship, was lost. She was the second ship of the United States Navy to be named for the permit, a game fish found in waters from North Carolina to Brazil.

The contract to build her was awarded to Mare Island Naval Shipyard on 27 January 1958, and her keel was laid down on 1 May 1959. She was launched on 1 July 1961, sponsored by Mrs. John A. McCone, and commissioned on 29 May 1962.

==Service history==
She spent five weeks of trials in the Puget Sound area, and then three weeks at Mare Island for checkout of the SUBROC missile system. Off the California coast in spring 1962, about west of the Golden Gate, she collided with the hull of the Matson freighter &quot;Hawaiian Citizen&quot; on 9 May, damaging both vessels, which caused a change of command. During late summer and early fall, &quot;Permit&quot; underwent shakedown in the San Diego area. After final acceptance trials in January 1963, she participated in a thorough evaluation of the SUBROC missile, and on 28 March, became the first submarine to successfully fire one. During 1964 and 1965, &quot;Permit&quot; engaged in more testing and training of an advanced nature.

&quot;Permit&quot; underwent an overhaul at Mare Island during the winter of 1966. From May to July, she deployed to WestPac, and after a short stop at Pearl Harbor, returned to San Diego on 13 August. She spent the remainder of the year operating in local waters.

The submarine underwent overhaul at Mare Island in 1967. During this period, her homeport was changed to nearby Vallejo. By late November, &quot;Permit&quot; was ready for trials in Puget Sound, and a return to San Diego on 12 December. The boat operated off San Diego until 22 April, then departed for special operations in the Pacific, which lasted until 26 June. From 24 July to 1 October, she was engaged in another special assignment. &quot;Permit&quot; then resumed local operations off San Diego.

In late 1982, the submarine USS La Jolla collided with the surface-operating USS Permit at periscope depth about 30 miles off San Francisco. La Jolla sustained minor damage to its rudder and left a 10-by-3-foot scratch in the paint on Permit&#x27;s keel.
&quot;Permit&quot; was decommissioned and stricken from the Naval Vessel Register on 23 July 1991. Ex-&quot;Permit&quot; entered the nuclear-powered Ship and Submarine Recycling Program in Bremerton, Washington, on 30 September 1991, and on 20 May 1993, ceased to exist.

<text>USS &quot;Plunger&quot; (SSN-595), a , was the third ship of the United States Navy to be named &quot;plunger&quot;, meaning a diver or a daring gambler.

The contract to build her as a guided-missile submarine (SSGN) was awarded to Mare Island Naval Shipyard on 23 March 1959, but by the time her keel was laid down on 2 March 1960 she had been redesigned as an attack submarine (SSN). She was launched on 9 December 1961 (sponsored by Mrs. Clinton P. Anderson), and commissioned on 21 November 1962.

==Service history==
Following a trip to Puget Sound on 27 November to test torpedo tubes and sound gear, &quot;Plunger&quot; departed Mare Island on 5 January 1963 for shakedown to Pearl Harbor. &quot;Plunger&quot; next was homeported at Mare Island and operated to test the performance of sonar and the fire control system. In April she changed homeport to Pearl Harbor, where she became flagship of ComSubDiv 71, on 1 April.

Continuing in a testing capacity, &quot;Plunger&quot; evaluated the most advanced class of nuclear attack submarines. Operating off the U.S. West Coast during the spring and summer, she proceeded to Wake Island on 15 September 1964 for SubRon Operational Evaluation missile firing.

At Pearl Harbor again in January 1965, &quot;Plunger&quot; was selected to demonstrate the capability of the Navy&#x27;s latest ASW weapon system to Dr. Donald Hornig, Special Assistant to the President for Science and Technology. At Wake Island in May, &quot;Plunger&quot; participated in C/S-17, the SubRon Operational Training Test. In September, she prepared for WestPac deployment, which continued into mid 1966. During this deployment, &quot;Plunger&quot; conducted evaluation exercises of the AN/BQQ-1 sonar systems and traveled as far east as Okinawa and Subic Bay. She also conducted ASW exercises and executed oceanographic and port surveys.

At Pearl Harbor with SubRon 7 in 1967, &quot;Plunger&quot; operated to improve the ASW readiness of the Pacific fleet; from 6 March to 22 March, she participated in ASW exercises and later continued in advanced type-training work. During inport periods at Pearl Harbor, &quot;Plunger&quot; provided services to Fleet Training Program Pearl Harbor. Homeporting at Puget Sound the last six months of 1967, &quot;Plunger&quot; returned to Pearl Harbor on 1 February 1968.

In the latter part of 1968, while on a WestPac (Western Pacific) deployment, &quot;Plunger&quot; was the first nuclear ship to visit Japan at Yokosuka. Many Japanese protested the arrival of the submarine due to the power plant and fear of nuclear contamination of their waters. In January 1969, a two-month &quot;special operations&quot; patrol was conducted, and again in mid 1969 a &quot;Pearl to Pearl&quot; special operations patrol completed. It is on that patrol that the ship garnered a Navy Unit Citation for operations in the North Pacific under the command of Cdr. Nils Thunman. While on the 1968-1970 WestPac deployment ports of call were made at Yokosuka, Japan (twice); Guam, USA; Sasebo, Japan; Okinawa, Japan; Subic Bay, Philippines; Pusan, South Korea; and Hong Kong. &quot;Plunger&quot; was also the successful test bed for a new torpedo tube launched rocket called the &quot;SubRoc&quot; which was used in anti-submarine operations at a distance of up to twenty-five miles.

Commander Alvin L. Wilderman, the submarine&#x27;s skipper, was washed overboard from the bridge in a storm near San Francisco on 30 November 1973. The officer of the deck and lookout were not lost.

From 1970 to 1973 she was deployed to WestPac and Vietnam. In the fall of 1973 she was conducting sea trials of the coast of California. Subsequent to those trials she returned to WestPac where she remained until 1980.

USS Plunger underwent a refit in Bremerton from 1980 to 1982 receiving several modernizations including the BQQ-5 Sonar System. She returned to San Diego after sea trials in 1983. She deployed to Westpac from January - June 1984 participating in two long operations during the deployment. She was involved in a collision with a freighter off Southern California while coming to periscope depth in early 1985 which damaged portions of her bow and sonar dome. These repairs required an unscheduled drydock during the spring of 1985.

In 1986 &quot;Plunger&quot; won the Marjorie Sterrett Battleship Fund Award, becoming the first warship to win both the Sterrett and the Arleigh Burke Awards. In this year, too, &quot;Plunger&quot; made yet another deployment to the Western Pacific, making port calls in Yokosuka, Japan and Subic Bay in the Philippines as well as visiting Hong Kong as a liberty port. During the 1986 WestPac &quot;Plunger&quot; participated in naval exercises with ships from the US, Japan, and other nations as well as a ten-week &quot;special operation&quot;, for which it was awarded the Meritorious Unit Commendation. After returning from the WestPac Plunger conducted normal operations in the SoCal Operational Area for the next several months.

The next few years saw a number of other accomplishments - &quot;Plunger&quot; was recognized for excellence in virtually every major inspection and won the Battle Efficiency (the coveted &quot;Battle E&quot;) award for overall combat readiness. Although aging, &quot;Plunger&quot; maintained a grueling operational schedule, spending over 60% of her time at sea and never missing a scheduled underway period - a record that many much newer submarines were unable to match.

&quot;Plunger&quot; made her final WestPac deployment in 1988, visiting Japan and the Philippines as well as Guam and Chinhae, South Korea (and making port calls in Okinawa and Hong Kong) and conducting another two-month &quot;special operation&quot; that garnered her a Navy Unit Commendation. This WestPac was followed by another fairly intense period of routine operations out of San Diego and, in December 1988, departure for her final &quot;special operation&quot; - this time keeping her crew at sea over Christmas, New Year&#x27;s Day, and (to the disappointment of the crew) Super Bowl Sunday. This special operation ended with Plunger completing its final Operational Reactor Safeguards Examination (which it passed with flying colors) and giving its crew some well-earned R&amp;R in Pearl Harbor Hawaii.

Returning to home port, &quot;Plunger&quot; was deactivated (while under the command of William Large), in commission, on 10 February 1989, decommissioned on 3 January 1990 and stricken from the Navy Register the following 2 February. Ex-&quot;Plunger&quot; entered the Nuclear Powered Ship and Submarine Recycling Program in Bremerton, Washington, on 5 January 1995 and on 8 March 1996 ceased to exist.

At the time of decommissioning &quot;Plunger&quot; was noted by the San Diego Tribune as being the most-decorated submarine in the Pacific Fleet and it was the most-decorated warship in San Diego. Through its history, &quot;Plunger&quot; was awarded four Navy Unit Commendations as well as multiple Meritorious Unit Commendations, Battle Efficiency, and other awards. And as of its retirement &quot;Plunger&quot; was the only submarine to win the Arleigh Burke Award (in 1969 under Commanding Officer Nils Thunman).

<text>USS &quot;Pollack&quot; (SSN-603), a &quot;Permit&quot;-class attack submarine, was the second ship of the United States Navy to be named for the pollack, a food fish resembling the true cod, but with the lower jaw projecting and without the barbel.

The contract to build &quot;Pollack&quot; was awarded to New York Shipbuilding Corporation in Camden, New Jersey on 3 March 1959 and her keel was laid down on 14 March 1960. She was launched on 17 March 1962, sponsored by Mrs. John Pastore, and commissioned on 26 May 1964.

==Service history==
&quot;Pollack&quot; reported to the Commander in Chief, U.S. Atlantic Fleet for duty, and became a unit of Submarine Squadron 4, homeported in Charleston, South Carolina. After shakedown in the Caribbean Sea, she underwent a six-month evaluation as an anti-submarine warfare (ASW) weapon.

Most of 1965 was spent at sea evaluating new ASW tactics, participating in a destroyer versus submarine evaluation, and practicing an anti-shipping mission. Also during 1965 &quot;Pollack&quot; earned the Navy Unit Commendation.

During 1966, &quot;Pollack&quot; was evaluated in coordinated ASW operations. She spent most of 1967 at sea, making various weapons tests. On 1 March 1968, &quot;Pollack&quot;&#x27;s homeport was changed to Norfolk, Virginia, and she became a unit of Submarine Squadron 10, the first all-nuclear attack submarine squadron in the Navy. &quot;Pollack&quot; remained with the Atlantic Fleet into 1970.

:&quot;History from 1970 to 1975 needed.&quot;

Following refueling overhaul at Charleston Naval Shipyard, &quot;Pollack&quot; was transferred to the Pacific Fleet and SubRon-3. She made a liberty call in Roosevelt Roads, Puerto Rico and transited the Panama Canal to reach her new home port of San Diego, California, in March 1975.

:&quot;History from 1975 to 1979 needed.&quot;

In 1979 &quot;Pollack&quot; began a refit in Mare Island Naval Shipyard in Vallejo, California. She returned to Submarine Squadron 3, Submarine tender , and San Diego, in 1982.

:&quot;History from 1982 to 1986 needed.&quot; 
:In January 1987, &quot;USS Pollack&quot; was still stationed at port-of-call Point Loma, San Diego, SUB Squadron 3, performing weekly operations at sea and returning to port. In October 1987, she left port for a three month cruise (NORPAC), but a month out to sea she ran into some equipment malfunctions that could not be handled at sea. So, she was brought back to port at Point Loma in November 1987. It was decided then that &quot;USS Pollack&quot; would transfer to Mare Island Shipyard and begin decommissioning a little earlier than originally planned.

In 1988, &quot;Pollack&quot; transferred to Submarine Group 5 at Mare Island Naval Shipyard. At the Mare Island Shipyard, the &quot;Pollack’s&quot; crew (now designated as the decommissioning crew) worked on removing and documenting all reusable equipment prior to defueling the reactor. After removing the spent fuel from the reactor, more work was done removing salvageable equipment that couldn’t be removed while the reactor still had its fuel installed. By March 1st of 1989, fuel and salvageable parts were removed and the &quot;Pollack&quot; was moved to Puget Sound, awaiting it’s entry into the SSRP (Ship and Submarine Recycling Program).

&quot;Pollack&quot; was decommissioned and stricken from the Naval Vessel Register on 1 March 1989 . Ex-&quot;Pollack&quot; entered the Nuclear Powered Ship and Submarine Recycling Program in Bremerton, Washington, on 9 February 1993. Recycling was completed on 17 February 1995.

<doc id="755639" wikidata="Q502766" url="?curid=755639" title="USS Tinosa (SSN-606)">
<text>USS &quot;Tinosa&quot; (SSN-606), a &quot;Permit&quot;-class submarine, was the second ship of the United States Navy to be named for the tinosa, a poisonous, black, tropical fish.

The contract to build her was awarded to Portsmouth Naval Shipyard in Kittery, Maine on 17 December 1958 and her keel was laid down on 24 November 1959. She was launched on 9 December 1961 sponsored by Mrs. Samuel S. Stratton, the wife of Congressman Samuel S. Stratton of New York, and commissioned on 17 October 1964.

==Service history==
Following shakedown out of New London, Connecticut, the submarine underwent availability at her builder&#x27;s yard from April to June 1966 before making a cruise to Faslane, Scotland, and the Caribbean Sea. After an overhaul which lasted from March through June 1967, the ship provided services for the Naval Underwater Sound Laboratory at New London through the first three months of 1968. During this tour, &quot;Tinosa&quot; was based briefly at Port Everglades, Florida, as well as at New London and visited Bermuda in the course of her operations. At the end of this experimental and test duty, &quot;Tinosa&quot; began local operations out of New London.

&quot;Tinosa&quot; continued to work off the eastern seaboard and in the Caribbean into 1969. During her major overhaul in the spring of that year, she received the SUBSAFE submarine safety improvements designed in the wake of the tragic loss of submarine in April 1963.

Following the completion of this yard period in December 1971, &quot;Tinosa&quot; resumed active operations off the eastern seaboard and into the familiar waters of the Caribbean Sea and continued the routine into the middle of 1972. In July, she crossed the Atlantic for visits to ports in northern Europe and for deployment in the Mediterranean Sea with the 6th Fleet. After operating out of Sardinia and Holy Loch during this period, she returned home in December to conduct tests in conjunction with a project sponsored by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.

&quot;Tinosa&quot; worked out of New London from 1 February 1973 until the end of March, operating with submarines and surface craft on exercises and maneuvers. After a three-day visit to the United States Naval Academy in late April, where she served in a familiarization program for midshipmen, &quot;Tinosa&quot; underwent a tender availability alongside at New London. In ensuing months, the submarine was twice deployed to Bermuda and operated off Andros Island before participating in joint United States-Canadian antisubmarine warfare exercises in December off the Florida coast.

After being dry-docked in auxiliary repair drydock at New London from January to March 1974, &quot;Tinosa&quot; departed her home port on 19 May, bound for the Mediterranean, and conducted her second deployment with the Sixth Fleet through the summer months. She visited Bizerte from 24 June to 1 July and was the first nuclear-powered submarine to visit Tunisia.

Returning to New London on 16 November, the ship operated locally out of her homeport into late February 1975. Subsequently, operating in the Narragansett Bay area into the spring of that year, &quot;Tinosa&quot; departed New London on 23 July, bound for Charleston, South Carolina. She later shifted south to operate off the Florida coast. The ship underwent a major overhaul at the Ingalls Shipbuilding yard at Pascagoula, Mississippi, from late 1975 to 12 December 1977. She then resumed operations with the Atlantic Fleet commencing with two months of weapons system testing in the Caribbean from 13 February to 20 May 1978. This was followed by a combined exercise with units of the Royal Canadian Navy off Florida in mid-April. Most of the summer was spent in preparing for &quot;Tinosa&quot;&#x27;s forthcoming deployment to the Mediterranean Sea. On 13 September, she departed New London for five months of operations with the Sixth Fleet. At the end of 1978, the nuclear attack submarine was in upkeep in La Maddalena, Sardinia, following operations with a NATO task force composed of United States, British, Italian, and Turkish naval units.

In 1981 &quot;Tinosa&quot; visited Frederiksted, St. Croix, as a port visit in October that year.

:&quot;History from 1981 to 1988 needed.&quot;

On 4 January 1988, she departed New London for six months of operations with the Sixth Fleet in the Mediterranean. In October 1988 she departed New London for 60 days of North Atlantic Operations and crossed the Arctic Circle.

&quot;Tinosa&quot; was deactivated while still in commission on 15 July 1991, then decommissioned and stricken from the Naval Vessel Register on 15 January 1992. ex-&quot;Tinosa&quot; entered the Nuclear Powered Ship and Submarine Recycling Program in Bremerton, Washington, on 15 July 1991 and on 26 June 1992 ceased to exist.

<text>USS &quot;Haddo&quot; (SSN-604), a &quot;Permit&quot;-class submarine, was the second ship of the United States Navy to be named for the haddo, a pink salmon fish prevalent on the Pacific coast of the United States and Canada.

The contract to build her was awarded to New York Shipbuilding Corporation in Camden, New Jersey on 3 March 1959 and her keel was laid down on 9 September 1960. She was launched on 18 August 1962 sponsored by Mrs. Henry M. Jackson, and commissioned on 16 December 1964, with Commander John G. Williams, Jr. in command.

After shakedown out of New London, Connecticut, in January 1965, &quot;Haddo&quot; arrived at her home port, Charleston, South Carolina, on 8 February and joined SubRon 4. She operated off the Atlantic coast and in the Caribbean Sea until departing Charleston on 7 July for the Mediterranean Sea. She participated in numerous exercises with ships of the Sixth Fleet and NATO countries before returning home 7 November. &quot;Haddo&quot; has continued this pattern of service, alternating operations out of home port in the Atlantic with Sixth Fleet deployments, through 1967.

During the summer of 1965 &quot;Haddo&quot; became the first ship of her class to be deployed to the Mediterranean Sea with the U.S. Sixth Fleet. For operations during a period in 1966, &quot;Haddo&quot; was awarded the Navy Unit Commendation and was awarded the Meritorious Unit Commendation for operations conducted during a period in 1967. As a result of the outstanding teamwork and many long hours of training and operations during fiscal years 1968 and 1969, &quot;Haddo&quot; was awarded the Battle Efficiency &quot;E&quot; for Excellence. &quot;Haddo&quot; received an eighteen-month &quot;subsafe&quot; overhaul at Charleston Naval Shipyard from August 1969 to April 1970. Following overhaul, &quot;Haddo&quot;&#x27;s home port changed to New London, Connecticut, where she became a member of Submarine Squadron TEN. &quot;Haddo&quot; operated out of New London from 1971 to 1973. In the spring of 1972, &quot;Haddo&quot; completed the first six-month Mediterranean deployment for an SSN. In the fall of 1972, she again deployed to the Med, returning just prior to Christmas.

From August 1973 until December 1975, &quot;Haddo&quot; underwent an extensive refueling overhaul at Ingalls Shipyard in Pascagoula, Mississippi. After transiting the Panama Canal on 13 February 1976, &quot;Haddo&quot;&#x27;s homeport shifted to San Diego, California and joined the Pacific Fleet as a member of Submarine Squadron THREE.

In the spring of 1977, &quot;Haddo&quot; departed for the Western Pacific, returning in the fall after an arduous six-month deployment. During the first three months of 1978, &quot;Haddo&quot; accomplished an intensive Selected Restricted Availability at Puget Sound Naval Shipyard in Bremerton, Washington. In December 1978, &quot;Haddo&quot; again deployed to the Western Pacific, visited New Zealand and returned in 1979.

&quot;Haddo&quot; arrived in Mare Island Naval Shipyard for another intensive Selected Restricted Availability in February 1980. In August of the same year she deployed to the Indian Ocean, visited HMAS Stirling in Western Australia from 16–22 December 1980, and returned to San Diego in February 1981.

In July 1981, &quot;Haddo&quot; deployed to the Western Pacific, visited Japan and returned to San Diego in late October 1981. &quot;Haddo&quot; arrived at Mare Island Naval Shipyard in April 1982 and underwent an extensive modernization and overhaul in January 1984, returning to San Diego.

From February to August 1985, &quot;Haddo&quot; again deployed to the Western Pacific visiting Japan and Hong Kong. As a result of her successful deployment, and superb operational reliability, &quot;Haddo&quot; was again awarded the Battle Efficiency &quot;E&quot; for Excellence for 1985. &quot;Haddo&quot; underwent an intensive Selective Restricted Availability in October 1985 in San Diego. &quot;Haddo&quot; then deployed to the Western Pacific from August 1986 to February 1987, again visiting Japan and Hong Kong. She completed several months of successful local operations before undergoing her last Selected Restricted Availability in San Diego from January to March 1988.

&quot;Haddo&quot; conducted a two-month ASW operation in June and July 1988. From February 1989 until February 1990, &quot;Haddo&quot; was deployed from San Diego over 300 days, conducting intensive operations in support of the National Defense, including a six-month deployment to the Western Pacific visiting Korea, Japan, Hong Kong and the Philippines. During her last of six WESTPACs, she also completed the longest continuously submerged period in her 25-year history. In the fall-winter of 1989 and 1990, &quot;Haddo&quot; participated in the largest Pacific Fleet naval exercise since 1945, PACEX-89, and conducted a two-month ASW operation in the northern Pacific.

&quot;Haddo&quot; was decommissioned and stricken from the Naval Vessel Register on 12 June 1991. Ex-&quot;Haddo&quot; entered the Nuclear Powered Ship and Submarine Recycling Program in Bremerton, Washington, 

and on 20 June 1992 ceased to exist.

<text>, a in commission from 1967 to 1990, was the second ship of the United States Navy to be named for the jack, a name of fish applied to any young pike, large California rockfish, or green pike or pickerel. She saw extensive service during the Cold War.

==Construction and commissioning==
The contract to build &quot;Jack&quot; was awarded to Portsmouth Naval Shipyard in Kittery, Maine, on 13 March 1959 and her keel was laid down there on 16 September 1960. She was launched on 24 April 1963, sponsored by Mrs. Grace Groves, the wife of Lieutenant General Leslie R. Groves, who had been the head of the Manhattan Project. She was commissioned on 31 March 1967. The principal speaker at her commissioning ceremony was Rear Admiral James F. Calvert, USN, who served with distinction in the Pacific during World War II on &quot;Jack&quot;&#x27;s predecessor, the submarine .

===Unique silencing features===
&quot;Jack&quot; was a variation on the standard &quot;Permit&quot;-class design. She was longer than her sisters and used an experimental direct-drive plant with two contra-rotating propellers on concentric shafts. This allowed the propellers to be smaller and thus make less noise (termed &quot;blade rate&quot;) when interacting with the hull&#x27;s uneven wake, with no loss of thrust. It was judged that the specialized turbine and extra shaft watertight packing required by this solution was less effective than the alternative adopted on the other &quot;Permits&quot;: a much larger, scythe-shaped or skew-shaped propeller that interacted with the wake more slowly (another possible solution was the pump-jet, which would be adopted on the later Seawolf-class).

==Operational history==

===1982–1990===

Near the end of September 1982, &quot;Jack&quot; went to Portsmouth Naval Shipyard in Kittery, Maine for a 27-month overhaul. In April 1983, while in dry dock, she suffered a casualty. While conducting a hydrostatic test of the oxygen banks, the shipyard was using Freon (R-12) as the fluid to conduct the test (the Freon would leave no residue and potential contamination in the O2 banks upon evaporation after the test). One of the shipyard workers was unable to get out of the engineering space in time, and succumbed to the oxygen deprivation effects of the Freon and was not able to be revived.

Jack was formally decommissioned and stricken from the naval register on 11 July 1990. ex-Jack was then sent to Washington state to be disposed of by the Ship-Submarine Nuclear Recycling Program, &#x27;dying&#x27; on 30 June 1992.

<doc id="755645" wikidata="Q2274772" url="?curid=755645" title="Seth Low">
<text>Seth Low (January 18, 1850 – September 17, 1916) was an American educator and political figure who served as the mayor of Brooklyn from 1881 to 1885, the president of Columbia University from 1890 to 1901, a diplomatic representative of the United States, and the mayor of New York City from 1902 to 1903. He was a leading municipal reformer fighting for efficiency during the Progressive Era.

==Early life==

Low was the son of Abiel Abbot Low and Ellen Almira Dow. Low&#x27;s father was a leading trader in China, and his father&#x27;s sister, Harriet Low, was one of the first young American women to live in China. The Low family was old Puritan New England stock, descended from Thomas Low of Essex County, Massachusetts. Low was named after his grandfather Seth Low (1782–1853) who moved with his son Abiel to Brooklyn to start a prosperous importing company. When Brooklyn was incorporated as a city in 1834, Seth the elder was one of the incorporators; he also served on the Board of Aldermen and was first President of the Board of Education. Seth the elder was also involved with charity and support work for the poor; on his deathbed, he admonished his three-year-old grandson and namesake: &quot;Be kind to the poor.&quot;

Low&#x27;s father was a Unitarian, and his mother was an Episcopalian. For years, Low wavered between the two faiths. Finally, at age 22, Low decided he would henceforth be an Episcopalian.

Low attended Poly Prep Country Day School in Brooklyn and Columbia College. After graduating from Columbia in 1870, Low made a short trip abroad, and then entered the tea and silk house of A. A. Low &amp; Brothers, which had been founded by his father in New York. In 1875, he was admitted a member of the firm, from which, upon its liquidation in 1888, he withdrew with a large fortune.

In the mid-1870s, Seth Low began to lay the groundwork for his political career by supporting &quot;welfare reform&quot; and the elimination of food and coal disbursements for the poor which caused &quot;starving people&quot; to gather at &quot;warehouses where food was stored&quot; to beg for help. During this period, the reform movement, of which Low was a stalwart, denounced emergency assistance of potatoes and flour for the poor. The reduction in welfare assistance for the poor led many to seek shelter in &quot;police station basements&quot; and in city hospitals, and led many poor parents to bring &quot;their children to asylums&quot; and many men to beg on the streets for &quot;charity or work.&quot;

On December 9, 1880, he married Anne Wroe Scollay Curtis of Boston, daughter of Justice Benjamin R. Curtis of the United States Supreme Court. They had no biological children, but adopted two nieces and a nephew.

==Mayor of Brooklyn==

===First term===
By 1881 Brooklyn had been governed for years by a corrupt Democratic political machine under Hugh McLaughlin. By this time, a wave of goo-goo (or &quot;good government&quot;) sentiment had begun to gain favor, and public sentiment was starting to turn against the incumbent Democratic regime.

Brooklyn Republicans sensed an opportunity, but they were split between the &quot;stalwart&quot; candidate Benjamin F. Tracy and reform candidate Ripley Ropes. Low had no particular ambition to become Mayor, but his name was brought forth as a compromise, because his wealth and old family name appealed to the &quot;stalwarts&quot; and his reformist views appealed to the reformers. Low accepted the nomination at the Republican city convention, making it clear that he would not be a partisan mayor. Low defeated the incumbent Democrat James Howell after a two-week campaign, 45,434 votes to 40,937.

Low&#x27;s time in office was marked by a number of reforms:

* Low&#x27;s major achievement as mayor was to secure a degree of &quot;home rule&quot; of the city. Previously, the State Government dictated city policies, hiring, salaries, and other affairs. Low managed to secure an unofficial veto over all Brooklyn bills in the State Assembly.
* Low instituted a number of educational reforms. He was the first to integrate Brooklyn schools. He introduced free textbooks for all students, not just those who had taken a pauper&#x27;s oath. He instituted a competitive examination for hiring teachers, instead of giving teaching jobs to pay political debts. Low set aside $430,000 for the construction of new schools to accommodate 10,000 new students.
* Low introduced Civil Service Code to all city employees, eliminating patronage jobs.
* German immigrants wanted to enjoy their local beer gardens on the Sabbath, in violation of state &quot;dry&quot; laws and the demands of local puritanical clergy. Low&#x27;s compromise solution was that saloons could stay open as long as they were orderly. At the first sign of rowdiness, they would be closed.
* Low served as a member of the board of the New York Bridge Company, the company that built the Brooklyn Bridge, and led an unsuccessful effort to remove Washington Roebling as the chief engineer on that project.
* Low raised the tax rate from $2.33 of $100 assessed valuation in 1881 to $2.59 in 1883. He also went after property owners who had not paid back taxes. This increase in city revenue enabled him to reduce the city&#x27;s debt and increase services. However, raising taxes proved extremely unpopular.

===Second term===
Low&#x27;s tax increases and non-partisan governing policy lost him a measure of public support. By 1883, fellow Republicans were criticizing Low openly, and the press was critical of his tax policy. Although the Democrats ran the weak, nearly unknown candidate Joseph C. Hendrix in 1883, Low beat him by a slimmer margin than his first election. Where Low won his first term by 5,000 votes, he squeaked by re-election with only a 1,548-vote margin.

In 1884, Low&#x27;s mugwump support of Democrat Grover Cleveland in 1884 furthered the rift with his fellow Republicans. He declined to run for a third term in 1885, and refused to support Republican nominee General Isaac S. Catlin. Instead, he supported a reform candidate, General John R. Woodward. By this time, the public was losing their attraction to reform, and Democrat Daniel D. Whitney won election. With Whitney came the return of Democratic machine politics for another seven years. By 1892, some writers were looking back on Low&#x27;s tenure as a &quot;Golden Age&quot; of clean government.

==President of Columbia University==
Following his tenure as mayor of Brooklyn, Low assumed the presidency of Columbia College, serving between 1890 and 1901. Not an educator in the specific meaning of the word, he succeeded by his administrative skill in transforming the institution. He led the move of the institution from Midtown Manhattan to Morningside Heights, and secured trustee approval to change its name to &quot;Columbia University&quot;. The new campus matched Low&#x27;s vision of a civic university fully integrated into the city; the original design subsequently reconceived, left it open to the street and surrounding neighborhoods.

To forge a university, Low vitally united the various schools into one organization whose direction was moved from the separate faculties to a university council. Further reforms effected by him include the reorganization of the Law School, the addition of a faculty of pure science, the association of the university with the Teachers College, and the extension of the department of political and social study. In 1895, he gave one million dollars of his inheritance from his father for Low Memorial Library to be built at the new Columbia University campus. It was dedicated to his father and opened in 1897.

During his time at Columbia, Low was elected to the American Philosophical Society.

==International Peace Conference==
On July 4, 1899, he was one of the American delegates to attend the International Peace Conference at The Hague. Others in the delegation were Andrew D. White, then the United States Ambassador to the German Empire; Stanford Newel of Minnesota, then the United States Minister to the Netherlands; Captain Alfred Mahan, of the United States Navy; Captain William Crozier, of the United States Army; and Frederick Holls of New York.

At the conference, Low made the concluding speech, printed two months later in &quot;The New York Times&quot;, saying:

==Mayor of New York City==

Low&#x27;s first campaign for mayor of consolidated New York in 1897 was unsuccessful, partially because of a division among anti-Tammany Hall candidates and parties. However, four years later, he managed to attain office.

During his 1901 campaign, he had the support of humorist Mark Twain. He and Twain made a joint appearance that drew a crowd of more than 2,000.

In 1902, Low resigned as president of the university to become the second mayor of the newly consolidated City of New York. He stands out as the first mayor of Greater New York to be elected on a fusion ticket, with the support of both the Citizens Union and Republican parties. Some of his notable achievements include the introduction of a civil service system — based upon merit — for hiring municipal employees, reducing widespread graft within the police department, improving the system of education within the city, and lowering taxes. Despite these seemingly impressive achievements he only served for two years and was defeated in 1903 by Democrat George B. McClellan Jr.

==Later life==

He was chairman of the Tuskegee University (formerly &quot;Tuskegee Institute&quot;), a historically black college directed under Booker T. Washington, from 1907 until 1916. From 1907, he was also president of the business-labor alliance the National Civic Federation. Even though he believed in collective bargaining rights, which had customarily been denied to labor unions by those in authority, he did not favor strikes, but rather embraced arbitration as a suitable labor-management negotiation tactic.
He was a founder and the first president of the Bureau of Charities of Brooklyn, and was elected vice-president of the New York Academy of Sciences and president of the Archaeological Institute of America.

Low became interested in the food supply problem, that is its contribution to the constantly increasing cost of living. He became convinced that this difficulty could best be solved by democratic cooperation among farmers and consumers. He was president of the Bedford Farmers&#x27; Cooperative Association. He was also one of the founders of the Cooperative Wholesale Corporation of New York City, an organization which seeks to bring about a business federation of all the consumers&#x27; cooperative store societies in the eastern United States, but not being in sympathy with the radical tendency of this phase of the cooperative movement, he finally resigned and devoted himself entirely to the agricultural phase of cooperation. Low was also a trustee of the Carnegie Institute of Washington, D.C.

In the Spring of 1916, Low became ill with cancer. He died in his home in Bedford Hills, New York, on September 17, 1916. Even his funeral demonstrated the ability of Low to reach political consensus, with honorary pallbearers that included both financier and philanthropist J. P. Morgan Jr. and labor activist and AFL founder Samuel Gompers. 

He is buried in Green-Wood Cemetery in Brooklyn, New York.

==Legacy==
The Brooklyn Fire Department operated a fireboat named &quot;Seth Low&quot; from 1885 to 1917.

In the Bensonhurst neighborhood of Brooklyn there is also a playground named after Low.

In Seth Low Pierrepont State Park Reserve, named after Low&#x27;s nephew, there is a street named after Low called Seth Low Mountain Road.
Intermediate School 96 in Bensonhurst, Brooklyn is known as Seth Low Intermediate School 96.

In the Brownsville section of Brooklyn, New York, there is a NYCHA public housing development named Seth Low Houses. It consists of four 17 and 18 story buildings.

There was a Seth Low Junior College at Columbia University between 1928 and 1936.

<text>In mathematics, a join-semilattice (or upper semilattice) is a partially ordered set that has a join (a least upper bound) for any nonempty finite subset. Dually, a meet-semilattice (or lower semilattice) is a partially ordered set which has a meet (or greatest lower bound) for any nonempty finite subset. Every join-semilattice is a meet-semilattice in the inverse order and vice versa.

Semilattices can also be defined algebraically: join and meet are associative, commutative, idempotent binary operations, and any such operation induces a partial order (and the respective inverse order) such that the result of the operation for any two elements is the least upper bound (or greatest lower bound) of the elements with respect to this partial order. 

A lattice is a partially ordered set that is both a meet- and join-semilattice with respect to the same partial order. Algebraically, a lattice is a set with two associative, commutative idempotent binary operations linked by corresponding absorption laws.

==Order-theoretic definition==

A set partially ordered by the binary relation is a &quot;meet-semilattice&quot; if

: For all elements and of , the greatest lower bound of the set exists.

The greatest lower bound of the set is called the meet of and denoted 

Replacing &quot;greatest lower bound&quot; with &quot;least upper bound&quot; results in the dual concept of a &quot;join-semilattice&quot;. The least upper bound of is called the join of and , denoted . Meet and join are binary operations on A simple induction argument shows that the existence of all possible pairwise suprema (infima), as per the definition, implies the existence of all non-empty finite suprema (infima).

A join-semilattice is bounded if it has a least element, the join of the empty set. Dually, a meet-semilattice is bounded if it has a greatest element, the meet of the empty set.

Other properties may be assumed; see the article on completeness in order theory for more discussion on this subject. That article also discusses how we may rephrase the above definition in terms of the existence of suitable Galois connections between related posets — an approach of special interest for category theoretic investigations of the concept.

==Algebraic definition==

A &quot;meet-semilattice&quot; is an algebraic structure formula_1 consisting of a set with a binary operation , called meet, such that for all members and of the following identities hold:

; Associativity: 
; Commutativity: 
; Idempotency: 

A meet-semilattice formula_1 is bounded if includes an identity element 1 such that for all in 

If the symbol , called join, replaces in the definition just given, the structure is called a &quot;join-semilattice&quot;. One can be ambivalent about the particular choice of symbol for the operation, and speak simply of &quot;semilattices&quot;.

A semilattice is a commutative, idempotent semigroup; i.e., a commutative band. A bounded semilattice is an idempotent commutative monoid.

A partial order is induced on a meet-semilattice by setting whenever . For a join-semilattice, the order is induced by setting whenever . In a bounded meet-semilattice, the identity 1 is the greatest element of Similarly, an identity element in a join semilattice is a least element.

== Connection between the two definitions ==
An order theoretic meet-semilattice gives rise to a binary operation such that is an algebraic meet-semilattice. Conversely, the meet-semilattice gives rise to a binary relation that partially orders in the following way: for all elements and in if and only if 

The relation introduced in this way defines a partial ordering from which the binary operation may be recovered. Conversely, the order induced by the algebraically defined semilattice coincides with that induced by 

Hence the two definitions may be used interchangeably, depending on which one is more convenient for a particular purpose. A similar conclusion holds for join-semilattices and the dual ordering ≥.

==Examples==

Semilattices are employed to construct other order structures, or in conjunction with other completeness properties.
* A lattice is both a join- and a meet-semilattice. The interaction of these two semilattices via the absorption law is what truly distinguishes a lattice from a semilattice.
* The compact elements of an algebraic lattice, under the induced partial ordering, form a bounded join-semilattice.
* By induction on the number of elements, any non-empty finite meet semilattice has a least element and any non-empty finite join semilattice has a greatest element. (In neither case will the semilattice necessarily be bounded.)
* A totally ordered set is a distributive lattice, hence in particular a meet-semilattice and join-semilattice: any two distinct elements have a greater and lesser one, which are their meet and join.
** A well-ordered set is further a &quot;bounded&quot; join-semilattice, as the set as a whole has a least element, hence it is bounded.
*** The natural numbers formula_3, with their usual order are a bounded join-semilattice, with least element 0, although they have no greatest element: they are the smallest infinite well-ordered set.
* Any single-rooted tree (with the single root as the least element) of height formula_4 is a (generally unbounded) meet-semilattice. Consider for example the set of finite words over some alphabet, ordered by the prefix order. It has a least element (the empty word), which is an annihilator element of the meet operation, but no greatest (identity) element.
* A Scott domain is a meet-semilattice.
* Membership in any set can be taken as a model of a semilattice with base set because a semilattice captures the essence of set extensionality. Let denote &amp; Two sets differing only in one or both of the:
# Order in which their members are listed;
# Multiplicity of one or more members,
:are in fact the same set. Commutativity and associativity of assure (1), idempotence, (2). This semilattice is the free semilattice over It is not bounded by because a set is not a member of itself.
* Classical extensional mereology defines a join-semilattice, with join read as binary fusion. This semilattice is bounded from above by the world individual.
* Given a set the collection of partitions formula_5 of is a join-semilattice. In fact, the partial order is given by formula_6 if formula_7 such that formula_8 and the join of two partitions is given by formula_9. This semilattice is bounded, with the least element being the singleton partition formula_10.

==Semilattice morphisms==

The above algebraic definition of a semilattice suggests a notion of morphism between two semilattices. Given two join-semilattices and , a homomorphism of (join-) semilattices is a function such that

Hence is just a homomorphism of the two semigroups associated with each semilattice. If and both include a least element 0, then should also be a monoid homomorphism, i.e. we additionally require that

In the order-theoretic formulation, these conditions just state that a homomorphism of join-semilattices is a function that preserves binary joins and least elements, if such there be. The obvious dual—replacing with and 0 with 1—transforms this definition of a join-semilattice homomorphism into its meet-semilattice equivalent.

Note that any semilattice homomorphism is necessarily monotone with respect to the associated ordering relation. For an explanation see the entry preservation of limits.

==Equivalence with algebraic lattices==

There is a well-known equivalence between the category formula_11 of join-semilattices with zero with formula_12-homomorphisms and the category formula_13 of algebraic lattices with compactness-preserving complete join-homomorphisms, as follows. With a join-semilattice formula_14 with zero, we associate its ideal lattice formula_15. With a formula_12-homomorphism formula_17 of formula_12-semilattices, we associate the map formula_19, that with any ideal formula_20 of formula_14 associates the ideal of formula_22 generated by formula_23. This defines a functor formula_24. Conversely, with every algebraic lattice formula_25 we associate the formula_12-semilattice formula_27 of all compact elements of formula_25, and with every compactness-preserving complete join-homomorphism formula_29 between algebraic lattices we associate the restriction formula_30. This defines a functor formula_31. The pair formula_32 defines a category equivalence between formula_11 and formula_13.

==Distributive semilattices==

Surprisingly, there is a notion of &quot;distributivity&quot; applicable to semilattices, even though distributivity conventionally requires the interaction of two binary operations. This notion requires but a single operation, and generalizes the distributivity condition for lattices. A join-semilattice is distributive if for all and with there exist and such that Distributive meet-semilattices are defined dually. These definitions are justified by the fact that any distributive join-semilattice in which binary meets exist is a distributive lattice. See the entry distributivity (order theory).

A join-semilattice is distributive if and only if the lattice of its ideals (under inclusion) is distributive.

==Complete semilattices==

Nowadays, the term &quot;complete semilattice&quot; has no generally accepted meaning, and various mutually inconsistent definitions exist. If completeness is taken to require the existence of all infinite joins, or all infinite meets, whichever the case may be, as well as finite ones, this immediately leads to partial orders that are in fact complete lattices. For why the existence of all possible infinite joins entails the existence of all possible infinite meets (and vice versa), see the entry completeness (order theory).

Nevertheless, the literature on occasion still takes complete join- or meet-semilattices to be complete lattices. In this case, &quot;completeness&quot; denotes a restriction on the scope of the homomorphisms. Specifically, a complete join-semilattice requires that the homomorphisms preserve all joins, but contrary to the situation we find for completeness properties, this does not require that homomorphisms preserve all meets. On the other hand, we can conclude that every such mapping is the lower adjoint of some Galois connection. The corresponding (unique) upper adjoint will then be a homomorphism of complete meet-semilattices. This gives rise to a number of useful categorical dualities between the categories of all complete semilattices with morphisms preserving all meets or joins, respectively.

Another usage of &quot;complete meet-semilattice&quot; refers to a bounded complete cpo. A complete meet-semilattice in this sense is arguably the &quot;most complete&quot; meet-semilattice that is not necessarily a complete lattice. Indeed, a complete meet-semilattice has all &quot;non-empty&quot; meets (which is equivalent to being bounded complete) and all directed joins. If such a structure has also a greatest element (the meet of the empty set), it is also a complete lattice. Thus a complete semilattice turns out to be &quot;a complete lattice possibly lacking a top&quot;. This definition is of interest specifically in domain theory, where bounded complete algebraic cpos are studied as Scott domains. Hence Scott domains have been called &quot;algebraic semilattices&quot;.

Cardinality-restricted notions of completeness for semilattices have been rarely considered in the literature.

==Free semilattices==

This section presupposes some knowledge of category theory. In various situations, free semilattices exist. For example, the forgetful functor from the category of join-semilattices (and their homomorphisms) to the category of sets (and functions) admits a left adjoint. Therefore, the free join-semilattice over a set is constructed by taking the collection of all non-empty &quot;finite&quot; subsets of ordered by subset inclusion. Clearly, can be embedded into by a mapping that takes any element in to the singleton set Then any function from a to a join-semilattice (more formally, to the underlying set of ) induces a unique homomorphism between the join-semilattices and such that Explicitly, is given by formula_35 Now the obvious uniqueness of suffices to obtain the required adjunction—the morphism-part of the functor can be derived from general considerations (see adjoint functors). The case of free meet-semilattices is dual, using the opposite subset inclusion as an ordering. For join-semilattices with bottom, we just add the empty set to the above collection of subsets.

In addition, semilattices often serve as generators for free objects within other categories. Notably, both the forgetful functors from the category of frames and frame-homomorphisms, and from the category of distributive lattices and lattice-homomorphisms, have a left adjoint.

It is often the case that standard treatments of lattice theory define a semilattice, if that, and then say no more. See the references in the entries order theory and lattice theory. Moreover, there is no literature on semilattices of comparable magnitude to that on semigroups.

<doc id="755652" wikidata="Q584973" url="?curid=755652" title="Frank O. Lowden">
<text>Frank Orren Lowden (January 26, 1861 – March 20, 1943) was an American Republican Party politician who served as the 25th Governor of Illinois and as a United States Representative from Illinois. He was also a candidate for the Republican presidential nominations in 1920 and 1928.

Born in Sunrise Township, Minnesota, Lowden practiced law in Chicago after graduating from the University of Iowa. He emerged as a local Republican leader and served in the House of Representatives from 1906 to 1911. He served as Governor of Illinois from 1917 to 1921, earning wide notice for his reorganization of state government and his handling of the Chicago race riot of 1919.

At the 1920 Republican National Convention, Lowden was the preferred candidate of many of the party&#x27;s conservatives. His supporters coalesced behind Warren G. Harding as a compromise candidate, and Harding won both the nomination and the 1920 presidential election. Lowden was nominated for vice president at the 1924 Republican National Convention, but he declined the nomination. Lowden was a candidate for president at the 1928 Republican National Convention, but Herbert Hoover won the nomination on the first ballot.

==Early life==
Lowden was born in Sunrise Township, Minnesota, the son of Nancy Elizabeth (Breg) and Lorenzo Orren Lowden, a blacksmith. He lived in Iowa from the age of seven, on the farm in Hardin County, Iowa, in poverty. He attended school when chores on the family farm allowed. At age fifteen he began to teach in a one room school house in Hubbard, Iowa. 
After teaching five years, he entered the University of Iowa at twenty, graduating in 1885. 
He aspired to be a lawyer, but taught high school for a year while learning stenography. 
That skill got him a job in 1886 at the Dexter law firm in Chicago, and he took evening courses at the 
Union College of Law, completing the two year curriculum in one year, finishing as valedictorian in 1887. He was admitted to the bar the same year and practiced law in Chicago for about 20 years. His wife, Florence, was the daughter of George Pullman and namesake of the Hotel Florence. In 1899, he was professor of law at Northwestern University, Evanston, Illinois.

==Political career==

=== Entry ===
In 1900, Lowden declined the first assistant postmaster-generalship, offered him by President McKinley, whom he had supported. He was a delegate to the Republican National Convention in 1900 and 1904, and from 1904 to 1912 was a member of the Republican National Committee. He was also a member of the executive committee in 1904 and 1908. 

Lowden was elected a U.S. Representative from Illinois in 1906 to fill the unexpired term of Robert R. Hitt, deceased. He was re-elected for succeeding terms until 1911, when he declined to run for another term.

=== Governor of Illinois (1917–1921) ===
From 1917 to 1921, he was the Governor of Illinois. While governor, he won wide notice for the major reorganization of state government he spearheaded. He introduced the budget system for state expenditure, thereby reducing the rate of taxation in spite of rising prices. 

He was a strong supporter of the death penalty, and when in 1918 both houses of the Illinois General Assembly voted to abolish capital punishment, he vetoed the bill. He was energetic in marshalling the resources of his state in support of the United States&#x27; World War I effort. 

In 1917, when the mayor of Chicago refused to interfere with a meeting of the People&#x27;s Council, an organization accused of pro-Germanism, he ordered out the state troops to prevent the meeting. He favoured woman suffrage and the enforcement of the Volstead Act for war-time prohibition. He was opposed to the League of Nations without reservations, on the ground that it would create a super-state. He gained nationwide stature for his handling of the Chicago Race Riot of 1919 and a simultaneous transit strike in Chicago.

=== 1920 presidential election and aftermath ===
He was a leading candidate for the Republican nomination for president in 1920. His campaign was embarrassed by reports of profligate spending. His Missouri campaign manager gave out $32,000 to promote his campaign, including $2,500 (a laborer&#x27;s annual wage) to at least two convention delegates. 

Delegates at the Republican convention deadlocked over several ballots between Lowden and General Leonard Wood, resulting in party leaders meeting privately to determine a compromise candidate. Their choice, Warren G. Harding, went on to win the nomination. 

In the 1924 election, he declined the Republican nomination for vice president. In 1928, he again positioned himself to run for the party&#x27;s nomination, but he was never much more than a minor threat to front runner Herbert Hoover, who went on to win the presidential nomination and the election.

==Railroad career==
In 1933, Lowden was appointed to be one of three receivers for the bankrupt Chicago, Rock Island and Pacific Railroad. He served in this capacity with co-receivers Joseph B. Fleming and James E. Gorman (the latter had been president of the railroad since 1917) until his death in 1943 in Tucson, Arizona. His remains are buried in Graceland Cemetery, Chicago.

==Legacy==
The following are named after Lowden: Camp Lowden Boy Scout Camp, Lowden State Park and Lowden-Miller State Forest, all near his estate outside Oregon, Illinois; the Frank O. Lowden Homes in Chicago; and two Lowden Halls, located on the campus of the Northwestern University School of Law in Chicago and Northern Illinois University in DeKalb.

A plaque dedicated to Lowden can be found in Lowden State Park, in front of a flagpole not far from Illinois Route 56. It was erected by the Holstein-Friesian Association of America, for which he served as president from 1921 until 1930.

<text>Jaco van der Westhuyzen (born 6 April 1978) is a South African former professional rugby union footballer who played fly-half or fullback.

==Early life==
Born in Groblersdal, Mpumalanga province, South Africa, van der Westhuyzen was educated at Ben Viljoen High School, Groblersdal, van der Westhuyzen studied law at the University of Natal (Pietermaritzburg) and through UNISA. Van der Westhuyzen played for South Africa A, U23s and U21s (helping them to the Sanzar title in Argentina in 1999), as well as the South African Barbarians in 2001 and South Africa Schools in 1996. He made his debut in the Super 12 as an 18 year old in 1997.

==Professional rugby career==
He made his name with the as a fly-half starting at U21 level in 1997. Played in both the Currie Cup (scoring 96 points in 21 games) and then making his Super 12 debut in 1997 as a 19-year-old. He was unable to cement himself a place in the starting line-up, and moved north to the Mpumalanga Pumas where he came under the eye of ex-Springbok centre Danie Gerber.

Van der Westhuyzen was first capped for the Springboks in the 2000 Tri Nations tournament against New Zealand as a replacement, but a knee injury after his first two tests curtailed his international career.

Van der Westhuyzen then moved to the Pretoria-based Blue Bulls in 2001 helping them to the Vodacom Cup in his first year then, still playing as a fly-half, claiming the Currie Cup title in 2002. He was named the South African Super 12 Player of the Year following the Bulls&#x27; sixth-place finish in the competition – the highest of any South African team in 2003. He returned to the Bulls in 2006 after stints at Leicester Tigers and NEC Green Rockets. He has been played mainly at fullback since his return; Morné Steyn and Derick Hougaard are currently well-established as the team&#x27;s fly-halves.

He scored his debut international try against Samoa in Brisbane in the 2003 Rugby World Cup, after he was called into the South African squad as a late replacement.

In 2006, van der Westhuyzen was part of the Springboks side that was thrashed 49–0 by the Wallabies, in their opening Tri Nations match. van der Westhuyzen made many handling errors during the match, leading to Butch James to be brought into the side. One of van der Westhuyzen&#x27;s errors involved him dropping the ball and after in the bounced, kick it, claiming to the referee that he was attempting a drop goal. Later, van der Westhuyzen claimed he &quot;needed to think of something&quot;.

===Leicester Tigers===
After the 2003 Rugby World Cup, he joined Leicester Tigers, where he initially was brought in as a fullback to replace Tim Stimpson. However, he was soon switched to fly-half, following in the tradition of Joel Stransky. His performances earned him a recall to the Springbok side in 2004. Van Der Westhuyzen made a total of 12 appearances, scoring 33 points for the Tigers.

===NEC Green Rockets===
Despite attempts by Leicester to keep him at the club, he decided to honour a contract he had signed with NEC Green Rockets in Japan and was registered from 2004 to 2009.

===Return to Bulls===
In 2010, van der Westhuyzen rejoined Bulls for the 2010 Super 14 season.

==Beliefs==
Van der Westhuyzen is a devout Christian. He claims his knee injury was miraculously healed by prayer when he visited T.B. Joshua, pastor of The Synagogue, Church of All Nations in Lagos, Nigeria. According to him, he was cured from a career threatening knee ligament injury immediately following the prayer.

==Achievements==
* SANZAR u21 Championship with South Africa Under-21 1999.
* Currie Cup 2002 with Blue Bulls.
* Superrugby winner 2007 &amp; 2010 (Bulls)

<text>Leopold Löwenheim [ˈle:o:pɔl̩d ˈlø:vɛnhaɪm] (26 June 1878 in Krefeld – 5 May 1957 in Berlin) was a German mathematician doing work in mathematical logic. The Nazi regime forced him to retire because under the Nuremberg Laws he was considered only three quarters Aryan. In 1943 much of his work was destroyed during a bombing raid on Berlin. Nevertheless, he survived the Second World War, after which he resumed teaching mathematics.

Löwenheim (1915) gave the first proof of what is now known as the Löwenheim–Skolem theorem, often considered the starting point for model theory.

Leopold was the son of Ludwig Löwenheim, a mathematics teacher at the polytechnic in Krefeld and Elizabeth Röhn, a writer. In 1881 the three of them left Krefeld first for Naples and then Berlin where Ludwig was a private scholar working on a comprehensive account of the influence of Democritus on modern science. Although he hoped this would gain him a teaching job at Humboldt University Ludwig died in 1894.

<text>Bert Kalmar (February 10, 1884 – September 18, 1947) was an American songwriter. He was inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame in 1970. He was also a screenwriter.

==Biography==
Kalmar, a native of New York City, left school at an early age and began working in vaudeville. He appeared on stage as a magician, comedian and dancer before switching to songwriting, after a knee injury ended his performing career. By this time, he had earned enough to start a music publishing company, Kalmar and Puck, where he collaborated with a number of songwriters, including Harry Puck (1891–1964) and Harry Ruby. The publishing firm also operated under the name Kalmar, Puck, Abrahams, Consolidated, Inc., the other named partner being Maurice Abrahams (1883–1931), husband of Belle Baker.

By 1918, Kalmar and Ruby had formed a permanent songwriting team. Together, they wrote the musical score for the Marx Brothers&#x27; stage production of &quot;Animal Crackers&quot; (1928) and subsequent film version. Their songs were also featured in the Marx Brothers&#x27; films &quot;Horse Feathers&quot; (1932), &quot;Duck Soup&quot; (1933) and &quot;A Night in Casablanca&quot; (1946). Kalmar&#x27;s partnership with Ruby was portrayed in the 1950 Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer musical &quot;Three Little Words&quot;, starring Fred Astaire and Red Skelton. Kalmar did, however, occasionally work with Oscar Hammerstein II, Ted Snyder and other songwriters.

Bert Kalmar was married to Jessie Brown, with whom he had two children. The couple were later divorced.

He died in Los Angeles, California on September 18, 1947 (aged 63). He was interred at Forest Lawn Cemetery in Glendale, California.

<text>Gillian Chung Ka-lai (born Chung Tik-shan, 21 January 1981), known by her stage name Chung Yan-tung, is a Hong Kong actress and singer. She is a member of the Cantopop duo Twins, along with Charlene Choi.

==Early life==
Chung was born in Hong Kong as Chung Tik-shan (). Her father died when she was one year old. When she was two years old, her family believed the character Tik (狄) from her birth name to be too strong and renamed her to Chung Ka-lai ().

She initially grew up in a single parent family until her mother remarried to a man also surnamed Chung, when Chung was in high school. She was given the English name &quot;Gillian&quot; while in high school. Chung graduated from Kowloon True Light Middle School and briefly attended the William Angliss Institute of TAFE in Melbourne, Australia. 

==Career==
===Early years===
In 2000, Chung was contacted by one of the model agencies she worked part-time with when she was in Hong Kong. She was offered a job opportunity by Emperor Entertainment Group (EEG), which she accepted in that year. She became a contracted artist and underwent training before making her debut. She was advised by her manager Mani Fok to adopt the &quot;Chung Yan-tung&quot; () as her stage name, after consulting fortune tellers. The name was supposed to enhance her business skills. On 18 May 2001, the management company assigned her to form a singing duo, Twins, with Charlene Choi. Chung and Choi released their first album three months later.

===Acting debut===
Chung made her acting film début in &quot;U Man&quot; (2002). She appeared in a number of films such as &quot;Beyond Our Ken&quot; (2004), which earned her critical acclaim as well as a nomination for Best Actress in the Golden Bauhinia Awards. In &quot;Beyond Our Ken&quot;, Chung played Chan Wai-ching, a spurned girlfriend of the eponymous Ken. The film had its world premiere at the Tokyo International Film Festival and grossed HK$3,886,355 at the box office. 

In January 2006, the film &quot;49 Days&quot; that Chung starred in had exceeded the HK$10 million (US$1.28 million) mark, earning a spot in one of Hong Kong&#x27;s best box office films for that year.

===Return to film industry===
After withdrawing from public for more than a year following the Edison Chen photo scandal incident and later confessed to having contemplated suicide, Chung apologised for hurting those around her, especially her long-time bandmate Charlene Choi. During the hiatus, she took classes in many areas, such as kung fu (Wing Chun), gymnastics, singing, dancing and acting, which she hoped would serve her professionally. In March 2009 she discussed the scandal on an episode of &quot;Be My Guest&quot;, which garnered 679 public complaints for the show. Afterwards she returned to work as spokesperson for TOUGH Jeansmith in the Asia region with a seven-figure pay-check. She flew to Taiwan, Shanghai, and other places for promotion. In July 2009, it was disclosed that she would get a 7-figure sum for the endorsement of botox treatment clinic Dr. Pro. Chung also appeared on stage in an adaptation of Neil Simon&#x27;s &quot;I Ought to Be in Pictures&quot;, produced by Emperor Concerts, part of EEG, for a budget of HK$2 million.

On 13 September 2009, Chung showcased an emotional performance art video at the Harbin Ice Snow World carnival singing competition. The silent video, previously filmed in Hong Kong, was shown at the fair lasting 8 minutes and 43 seconds. The video showed Chung switching from laughing to crying. This attraction drew hundreds of visitors each day. Many audiences thought that Chung used the art expression to reveal her apologetic attitude. However the video was only meant to show how attitudes are expressed through art, according to artist and video creator Jiang Zhi.

===Debut solo album===
On 27 March 2010, Chung released her début solo EP, which was sold as part of the package of Twins&#x27; fourth compilation album &quot;Everyone Bounce&quot; (人人彈起). The EP includes six songs, including début solo single &quot;More Hearts&quot; (心多) that was released a year prior to the album release.

===&quot;Sisters Who Make Waves&quot;===
On 5 August 2022, Chung debuted at 5th place for the third season of &quot;Sisters Who Make Waves&quot; which premiered on 20 May 2022, on Mango TV. Chung decided to join the competition with her long time bandmate Charlene Choi and compete against other 28 female artistes with diverse talents. At the same time, Chung aimed to lose weight and retuning her mindset. Due to 4 months of rigorous dance rehearsals and sheer willpower, Chung succeeded in shedding 20 pounds at the end of the competition.

==Personal life==
===2006 invasion of privacy incident===
In 2006 during a concert in Genting Highlands, Malaysia, a reporter surreptitiously photographed Chung nude in the changing room. On 22 August 2006, Hong Kong tabloid magazine &quot;Easy Finder&quot; published the photos as a cover story. Hong Kong celebrities such as Jackie Chan and Andy Lau staged a public protest denouncing the magazine. The Obscene Articles Tribunal classified the published photographs as &quot;indecent&quot;. On 1 November, &quot;Easy Finder&quot; lost its appeal against the obscenity ruling, with the appeal panel declaring the article as a &quot;calculated act of selling sexuality which is corrupting and revolting&quot;. Jimmy Lai, founder of &quot;Easy Finder&quot;″s publisher Next Media, apologized to Chung and offered to return all the negatives.

===2008 photo scandal===

In January and February 2008, sexually explicit photos of Edison Chen with a number of Hong Kong female celebrities were leaked online. The scandal involved Chung, as well as Bobo Chan and Cecilia Cheung, amongst others. The pictures tarnished Chung&#x27;s &quot;squeaky-clean image&quot;, and she apologized to the public for being naive and silly. Her subsequent television appearance on &quot;Jade Solid Gold&quot; triggered over 500 complaints to TVB, while the Hong Kong Broadcasting Authority received over 1200. Other promotion events were cancelled.

Chung was dropped from performing in the 2008 Summer Olympics opening ceremony by director Zhang Yimou. She was originally set to appear in Chen Kaige&#x27;s film &quot;Forever Enthralled&quot; and Oliver Stone&#x27;s &quot;W.&quot;, but her scenes were left on the cutting room floor.

=== Marriage ===

In July 2017, Chung met Michael Lai, a Taiwanese gynecologist, while filming &quot;Tree in the River&quot; in Taiwan and they were in a relationship in October. On 1 February 2018, Chung announced her engagement with Lai on Instagram, with a photo of a diamond ring given by her fiancé. The pair held a wedding ceremony in Los Angeles on 26 May, and one in Hong Kong on 20 December. The couple separated in March 2020.

<doc id="755682" wikidata="Q2613116" url="?curid=755682" title="Stasys Lozoraitis">
<text>:&quot;See Stasys Lozoraitis Jr. for an article about a son of Stasys Lozoraitis.&quot;
Stasys Lozoraitis (born: September 5, 1898 – December 24, 1983) was a prominent Lithuanian diplomat and politician who served as the Foreign Minister of Lithuania from 1934 until 1938. After Lithuania lost its independence in June 1940, Lozoraitis headed the Lithuanian diplomatic service from 1940 to his death in 1983. Most western countries did not recognize the Soviet occupation and continued to recognize legations and envoys of independent Lithuania thus maintaining the legal continuity of Lithuania.

Lozoraitis was a son of Motiejus Lozoraitis, a lawyer, activist of the Lithuanian National Revival, and contributor to &quot;Varpas&quot;. In 1923 he was assigned to the Lithuanian legation in Berlin. While in Germany, Lozoraitis studied international law at the University of Berlin. In 1929, he was transferred to Rome, where he became &quot;chargé d&#x27;affaires&quot; in 1931. In 1932, he returned to Lithuania and worked at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, becoming the Minister in June 1934. He worked to establish the Baltic Entente and to normalize relations with Poland, with which there were no diplomatic relations since Żeligowski&#x27;s Mutiny in 1920. Lozoraitis resigned after Poland presented an ultimatum in 1938 to resume diplomatic relations.

In February 1939, Lozoraitis was appointed as minister plenipotentiary to Italy. After the Lithuania was occupied by the Soviet Union in June 1940, Lozoraitis became the leader of all Lithuanian diplomatic service that remained abroad. As the highest &quot;de jure&quot; official of independent Lithuania, he represented Lithuania, advocated for non-recognition of the Soviet occupation, and popularized the Lithuanian cause. Lozoraitis continued to live in Rome and head the diplomatic service until his death on December 24, 1983. Upon his death, he was succeeded by Stasys Bačkis.

<doc id="755685" wikidata="Q5436219" url="?curid=755685" title="Farragut State Park">
<text>Farragut State Park is a public recreation area in the northwest United States, located in northern Idaho at the southern tip of Lake Pend Oreille in the Coeur d&#x27;Alene Mountains. The state park is east of Athol in Kootenai County, about northeast of Coeur d&#x27;Alene. Activities include camping, picnicking, hiking, mountain biking, cycling, fishing, boating, swimming, water sports, orienteering, disc golf, flying model aircraft, archery, and horseback riding.

==History==
===Naval training base===

The park grounds were formerly the Farragut Naval Training Station, a major training base of the U.S. Navy during World War II. Over 293,000 sailors received basic training at Farragut during its 30 months of existence. The last recruit graduated in March 1945 and the facility was decommissioned in 

===College===
From 1946–49, it was the site of the Farragut College and Technical Institute, which had copious athletic It ceased operations prior to the fall term in 1949, due to decreased enrollment and financial difficulties.

===State park===
In 1950, the federal government transferred of the former Farragut Naval Training Center to the Idaho department of fish and game, creating the Farragut Wildlife Management Area. The department transferred back to the federal government in 1964; this was deeded to the state parks department and became Farragut State Park by an act of the state legislature in 1966.

===Scouting===
Farragut State Park is significant in the history of Scouting in Idaho. It hosted the National Girl Scout Senior Roundup in 1965, the World Scout Jamboree in 1967, the National Scout Jamboree in 1969 and 1973, and the 2002 Star Northwest of the Boy Scouts of America. The world event in 1967 was the only time it had been held in the United States until 2019.

While traveling to the moon aboard &quot;Apollo 11&quot; on July 18, 1969, astronaut Neil Armstrong extended a greeting to the Scouts attending the national jamboree in Idaho. Armstrong was an Eagle Scout from Ohio. Frank Borman, astronaut and commander of &quot;Apollo 8&quot;, addressed the Scouts, as did Lady Baden-Powell, the widow of Scouting&#x27;s founder. At the Jamboree in 1973, Admiral Elmo Zumwalt, Chief of Naval Operations, and Gene Cernan, astronaut and commander of &quot;Apollo 17&quot;, addressed the Scouts. 

==Wildlife==
The residential animals of this state park are bass, trout, white-tailed deer, moose, elk, mountain goat, cougar, and black bear.

==Activities and amenities==
The park offers traditional recreational opportunities such as picnicking, boating, swimming, hiking, and camping, as well as disc golf, a model airplane flying field, the Naval Training Center and a museum. A remaining military feature is the Museum at the Brig, located in the confinement facility of the naval training station. Its displays include boot camp, naval, and war memorabilia as well as historic prison cells.

<doc id="755690" wikidata="Q315411" url="?curid=755690" title="Francesco Maria Grimaldi">
<text>Francesco Maria Grimaldi (2 April 1618 – 28 December 1663) was an Italian Jesuit priest, mathematician and physicist who taught at the Jesuit college in Bologna. He was born in Bologna to Paride Grimaldi and Anna Cattani.

==Work==
Between 1640 and 1650, working with Riccioli, he investigated the free fall of objects, confirming that the distance of fall was proportional to the square of the time taken. Grimaldi and Riccioli also made a calculation of gravity at the Earth&#x27;s surface by recording the oscillations of an accurate pendulum.

In astronomy, he built and used instruments to measure lunar mountains as well as the height of clouds, and drew an accurate map or, &quot;selenograph&quot;, which was published by Riccioli and now adorns the entrance to the National Air and Space Museum in Washington D.C.

He discovered and was the first to make accurate observations on the diffraction of light (although by some accounts Leonardo da Vinci had earlier noted it), and coined the word &#x27;diffraction&#x27;. In his book &quot;Physico-Mathesis de Lumine, Coloribus et Iride&quot; (1665), he stated the theory of the reconstitution of sunlight from refracted coloured light.

Through experimentation he was able to demonstrate that the observed passage of light could not be reconciled with the idea that it moved in a rectilinear path. Rather, the light that passed through the hole took on the shape of a cone. Later physicists used his work as evidence that light was a wave, significantly, Dutch mathematician Christiaan Huygens. He also discovered what are known as diffraction bands.

The crater Grimaldi on the Moon is named after him.

== Publications ==
He only published one work:
The work is mainly remembered for being the first report of diffraction. In the work, he was mainly concerned with two questions:

# Is light a substance or an accident [roughly the same as &quot;property&quot;]?
# What is the relation between light and color?

He argued that light is probably a subtle fluid (thus a substance), though it might still be an accident (as Aristotelians believed). He also argued that color is associated with undulations of the subtle fluid.

<doc id="755695" wikidata="Q1853611" url="?curid=755695" title="Brandy (album)">
<text>Brandy is the debut studio album by the American singer of the same name. It was released on September 27, 1994, by Atlantic Records. Chiefly produced by Keith Crouch, the album contains a range of contemporary genres, including hip-hop, pop-soul, and R&amp;B. Aside from Crouch, Norwood worked with a range of other writers and producers, including R&amp;B group Somethin&#x27; for the People, Arvel McClinton, Damon Thomas, and Crouch&#x27;s brother Kenneth.

Upon release, &quot;Brandy&quot; received generally positive reviews from music critics, who complimented Norwood&#x27;s appearance, as well as the album&#x27;s timeless appeal. While the album initially sold slowly, it reached number 20 on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 and was certified quadruple platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), selling over two million copies in the United States. Worldwide, the album has sold over 6 million copies.

Four singles were released from the album. &quot;I Wanna Be Down&quot; was chosen as the album&#x27;s lead single and peaked at number six on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. The song was critically lauded and was regarded as a standout track on &quot;Brandy&quot;. The album&#x27;s second single &quot;Baby&quot; was also well-received and peaked at number four on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. The following two singles, &quot;Best Friend&quot; and &quot;Brokenhearted&quot;, peaked at numbers 34 and nine on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, respectively. &quot;Brandy&quot; and its singles garnered Norwood nominations for various awards, including two Grammy Award nominations. The success of the album allowed Norwood to establish herself as one of the most successful of the then-new generation of R&amp;B female vocalists who emerged during the mid-to-late 1990s.

== Background ==
In 1990, Norwood&#x27;s talent led to a binding oral contract with Teaspoon Productions, headed by Chris Stokes and Earl Harris, who obtained her gigs as a backing vocalist for their R&amp;B boy band Immature. The agreement, also called for Teaspoon to represent her and attempt to secure her a record deal. Norwood first auditioned for Atlantic Records when she was 11 years old. Unfortunately, the executives at the label turned her away as they felt she was too young and urged her to come back when she turned 14. Coincidentally, on the same day in 1993 Teaspoon Productions had negotiated a deal for Norwood with East West Records, while her parents organized a recording contract with Atlantic Records. During her audition at Atlantic she auditioned for the company&#x27;s director of A&amp;R, Darryl Williams. Williams, recalled Norwood&#x27;s audition saying, &quot;Brandy stood out. She was just energetic and had an incredible voice for a 14-year-old.&quot; Norwood subsequently dropped out of Hollywood High School later and was tutored privately from tenth grade on.

During the early production stages of her debut on the Atlantic label, Norwood was selected for a role in the ABC sitcom &quot;Thea&quot;, portraying the 15-year-old daughter of a single mother played by Thea Vidale. Broadcast to mediocre ratings, the series ended after one season, consisting of 19 episodes. Norwood appreciated the cancellation of the show as she was unenthusiastic about acting at the time; also taping caused scheduling conflicts with the recording of her album. According to Norwood, &quot;I wanted to sing so badly that I was miserable when I had to cancel studio time to tape&quot;. She further discussed the shows cancellation saying, &quot;When Thea was canceled I was like, ‘Okay, I can now put all my focus into my album.&quot;

==Recording and production==
Recording of &quot;Brandy&quot; commenced in 1993. Williams initially consulted all-male R&amp;B group Somethin&#x27; for the People and musician Damon Thomas to work on the album, with Somethin&#x27; for the People contributing &quot;Sunny Day&quot;, &quot;Give Me You&quot;, and &quot;I Dedicate,&quot; the latter of which was later split into three interludes. Thomas co-wrote &quot;I&#x27;m Yours&quot; and produced &quot;Love Is on My Side.&quot; A then 16-year-old Robin Thicke scored his first co-writing credit on the latter. While they produced the majority of &quot;Brandy&quot;, Williams brought in the then-21-year-old, relatively unknown writer-producer Keith Crouch, nephew of gospel singer Andraé Crouch, towards the end of the project to work with Norwood on the bulk of the throwback, funk-soul production of the album. In a 2012 interview with &quot;Vibe&quot; magazine, Norwood elaborated that her collaboration with Crouch &quot;was very important for me as a young artist. At the time he was not trying to be like anyone else on radio. He was all about his own sound. [He] gave me real music. He didn’t give me teenybopper records. It was age appropriate, youthful records, but it was still real music. We had a great connection.&quot; Crouch would go on to work on 50 percent of &quot;Brandy&quot;, setting much of the tone of the album, with four from his five tracks becoming singles. While recording her vocals with him, Norwood was inspired by several singers, citing Whitney Houston and gospel group The Clark Sisters as major inspirations, particularly on &quot;Movin&#x27; On.&quot; However, she struggled to identify with some of Crouch&#x27;s material at first, especially on &quot;Baby&quot;, whose lyrics made her afraid of not being old enough.

==Music and lyrics==
With &quot;Brandy&quot; consisting mostly of street-oriented R&amp;B songs with influences from hip hop, the lyrics highlighted her youthful and innocent image. Norwood later summed up the songs on the record as young and vulnerable: &quot;I did not really know much – all I wanted to do was sing. You can easily understand that it is a person who sings genuinely, without any real experience. I sang about being attracted to the opposite sex but had no experience of it.&quot; The album&#x27;s fourth track, &quot;I Dedicate (Part I)&quot;, is the first of three where Norwood thanks artists who inspired her for a career in music. In the first part, which lasts one minute and 29 seconds, she mentions Whitney Houston as her &quot;mentor&quot; and &quot;role model&quot;.

==Singles==
&quot;I Wanna Be Down&quot; was released as the album&#x27;s lead single on September 5, 1994, to positive critical reception. The song peaked at number six on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 and atop the Hot R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Songs. Internationally, the song peaked at numbers 12 and 11 in Australia and New Zealand, respectively. It was certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) on November 4, selling over 600,000 copies in the United States by the end of 1994. The song&#x27;s accompanying music video, directed by Keith Ward, portrays Norwood in her tomboyish image, dancing in front of a Jeep near a forest, surrounded by backup dancers. The Rhythm Nation Hip-Hop Remix of the song, featuring MC Lyte, Queen Latifah and Yo-Yo, was included on the B-Side single for &quot;Baby&quot;.

&quot;Baby&quot; was released as the second single on December 24, 1994, to positive critical reception. It became an even larger commercial success than &quot;I Wanna Be Down&quot; peaking at number four both on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 and in New Zealand, while becoming her second consecutive Hot R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Songs number-one. The single sold over one million copies by the end of 1995, being certified platinum by the RIAA. Its accompanying music video, directed by Hype Williams, features Norwood and her company dancing in skiing outfits in Times Square. The song was nominated for Best Female R&amp;B Vocal Performance at the 38th Annual Grammy Awards.

&quot;Best Friend&quot; was released as the third single on June 27, 1995. Although positively received by critics, the song failed to duplicate the commercial success of the previous two singles. It peaked at number 34 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, but fared better on the Hot R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Songs, where it peaked at number seven. Internationally, the song charted only in New Zealand, where it peaked at number 11. Its accompanying music video, directed by Matthew Rolston, features Norwood and her backup troupe displaying their hip hop dancing skills in front of a garage; Norwood&#x27;s younger brother Ray J, to whom the song was dedicated, appears in the video.

The re-recorded duet version of &quot;Brokenhearted&quot;, with Wanya Morris from Boyz II Men, was released as the fourth and final single on August 22, 1995, to mixed critical reception. It became Norwood&#x27;s third &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 top-ten single, peaking at number nine, as well as peaking at number two on the Hot R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Songs. Additionally, it peaked at number six in New Zealand. The single was certified gold by the RIAA on November 10 for shipments of 500,000 units in the United States. Norwood reunited with Williams, director of previous videos for the Human Rhythm Hip Hop remix of &quot;I Wanna Be Down&quot; and &quot;Baby&quot;, to film a music video for &quot;Brokenhearted&quot; inside the Oheka Castle.

== Critical reception ==

In his review for AllMusic, Eddie Huffman wrote that &quot;this teenage R&amp;B singer hit the Top Ten late in 1994 with &quot;I Wanna Be Down&quot;, a representative track from her solid debut album. Brandy knows her way around a hip-hop beat, layering tender-tough vocals over spare arrangements like a lower-key Janet Jackson or a more stripped-down Mary J. Blige. Good songs and crisp production make Brandy a moody, moving success.&quot; In 2007, &quot;Vibe&quot; rated &quot;Brandy&quot; among the 150 most essential albums since its launch. The magazine found that &quot;Brandy&#x27;s debut is slow, deliberate, and naive — not for lack of accomplishment, but because the best moments here sound as wide-eyed and new as a first date.&quot;

&quot;People&quot; compared the effort with Aaliyah&#x27;s debut album &quot;Age Ain&#x27;t Nothing but a Number&quot;, which was released four months prior, writing: &quot;While everything about Aaliyah screams here-and-now, Brandy&#x27;s well-groomed blend of gently lilting hip hop and pop-soul has a more timeless appeal. With the poise and sassy confidence of a diva twice her age, Brandy mixes her love songs with tributes to her little brother (&quot;Best Friend&quot;), God (&quot;Give Me You&quot;), the perfect man (&quot;Baby&quot;) and older crooners like Aretha and Whitney (&quot;I Dedicate&quot;). While this isn&#x27;t groundbreaking stuff, Brandy has the pipes to become more than the latest teenage next-big-thing.&quot; Anderson Jones from &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; was less enthusiastic with the album. He gave the album a C rating and considered it as: &quot;An album that seems based on the philosophy &#x27;If Aaliyah can do it, why can&#x27;t I?&#x27; except that in singing about best friends, heroes, and puppy love instead of about making love, teen actress Norwood (TV&#x27;s &quot;Thea&quot;) acts her age. A premature effort, at best.&quot;
In his Consumer Guide, Robert Christgau gave the album a &quot;neither&quot; score, and said it &quot;may impress once or twice with consistent craft or an arresting track or two. Then it won&#x27;t.&quot;

== Impact and legacy ==
With the release of her debut album and the combined commercial success of its singles, Norwood had established herself a successful solo artist. The album led her to successful endeavors before the release of her second album &quot;Never Say Never&quot; (1998), including a joint tour with vocal group Boyz II Men, songs landing on successful soundtracks for films such as &quot;Waiting to Exhale&quot; (1995) and &quot;Set It Off&quot; (1996), her first starring TV role in the sitcom &quot;Moesha&quot;, and starring as the first African-American Cinderella in &quot;Cinderella&quot; (1997).

Widely acclaimed, &quot;Brandy&quot; was named one of the 50 best R&amp;B albums of the 1990s by &quot;Complex&quot;. American neo soul singer Erykah Badu revealed on Twitter that her debut studio album &quot;Baduizm&quot; (1997) was partly influenced by &quot;Brandy&quot;, tweeting: &quot;Brandy&#x27;s first album was one of my inspirations when writing &quot;Baduizm&quot;. I looove that album [...] songs i liked were &quot;I Wanna Be Down&quot; and &quot;Always on My Mind&quot;... nice.&quot; Fellow neo soul artist Jill Scott particularly praised the songs &quot;Sunny Day&quot; and &quot;Always on My Mind&quot;, saying &quot;I listen to her shit all the time&quot;. Pop group Karmin&#x27;s song &quot;Brokenhearted&quot; was inspired by Brandy&#x27;s song of the same title. Canadian recording artist Drake sampled all three parts of &quot;I Dedicate&quot; on his fourth studio album &quot;Views&quot; (2016) for the song &quot;Fire &amp; Desire&quot;. Gospel recording artists The Walls Group covered the song &quot;Always on My Mind&quot;, turning it into &quot;God on My Mind&quot;.

<text>Scott Wike Lucas (February 19, 1892 – February 22, 1968) was an American attorney and politician. A member of the Democratic Party, he represented Illinois in the U.S. House of Representatives (1935–1939) and the U.S. Senate (1939–1951). He was the Senate Majority Leader from 1949 to 1951.

==Early life==
Lucas was born on a tenant farm near Chandlerville, in Cass County, Illinois. He was the youngest of six children of William Douglas and Sarah Catherine (née Underbrink) Lucas. His parents named him after Scott Wike, a Democrat who served as a representative from Illinois (1875–1877, 1889–1893). His nephew was Allen T. Lucas who practiced law with Lucas and who served in the Illinois General Assembly. After attending public schools, he began his studies at Illinois Wesleyan University. During college, he was active in athletics. He lettered in football, basketball, and baseball and played semiprofessional baseball in the Three-I League during his summer breaks.

Lucas graduated from Wesleyan with a law degree in 1914 and was admitted to the bar the following year. He served as a schoolteacher before entering private practice in Havana. During World War I, he served in the US Army and rose to become a lieutenant.

Lucas returned to his law practice following his military service and served as a state&#x27;s attorney for Mason County from 1920 to 1925. He also worked as a commander of the Illinois Department of the American Legion. In 1932, he was defeated by William H. Dieterich for the Democratic nomination to challenge Republican incumbent Otis F. Glenn for a United States Senate seat from Illinois.

Lucas was later appointed chairman of State Tax Commission by Governor Henry Horner, serving from 1933 to 1935.

==House==
In 1934, following the death of Speaker of the House Henry Thomas Rainey, Lucas was elected to the House of Representatives from Illinois&#x27;s 20th congressional district. He established himself as a strong supporter of Franklin D. Roosevelt&#x27;s New Deal, working to pass the Soil Conservation and Domestic Allotment Act of 1936 and the Agricultural Adjustment Act of 1938. However, Lucas disagreed with Roosevelt over the president&#x27;s court-packing plan, which Lucas denounced as &quot;useless, selfish, and futile.&quot;

==Senate==
In 1938, after William Dieterich declined to run for re-election, Lucas was elected to the U.S. Senate over Republican Richard J. Lyons, with a 51%–48% victory. He was re-elected in 1944. Lucas was a favorite son candidate and among twelve nominated at the 1944 Democratic National Convention to serve as Franklin D. Roosevelt&#x27;s running mate in the presidential election that year. With support from Harry S. Truman, he was elected party whip in 1946. Lucas, a moderate, drew support from both conservative and liberal wings of the party. He took over the Midwest campaign for Truman and was credited with assisting Truman&#x27;s 1948 re-election and bringing nine Democrats into the Senate. When Alben Barkley became vice-president and resigned his seat, Lucas became majority leader. However, he was unable to build a consensus as Senate Majority Leader with the onset of the anticommunist era, and lost in 1950, to Republican Everett Dirksen. Lucas had become a target of Republican wrath with loss of political power in the Senate and the White House. His 1950 reelection campaign featured the active intervention into Illinois politics of Wisconsin Senator Joseph McCarthy, who traveled the state with Dirksen saying that Senator Lucas was &quot;soft on communism.&quot; Dirksen would go on to decisively defeat Lucas with a 54% to 46% victory. Privately, in later years, Dirksen attributed his victory to Lucas&#x27;s responsibilities as Senate Majority Leader, at the apparent expense of his state; Dirksen was free to campaign locally, often debating Lucas&#x27;s Illinois Democratic Party proxies and calling attention to Lucas&#x27;s prolonged absence from the state.

==Policy positions==
Overall, as Congressman and Senator Lucas focused on civil rights, labor unions, foreign policy, and agriculture. He supported anti-lynching legislation, opposed the poll tax, and was a vocal advocate for desegregation. Lucas played a major role in the passage of the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938. It established a federal minimum wage and maximum hours, and required overtime pay under specified conditions. He supported Franklin Roosevelt&#x27;s main foreign policy initiatives, including Lend-Lease in 1941 for military aid to the Allies, and the creation of the United Nations. Lucas supported the New Deal farm programs, which were popular in rural Illinois, especially the Agricultural Adjustment Act of 1938. As Majority Leader of the Senate in 1949-1950 he supported Harry Truman&#x27;s domestic and foreign agenda.

<text>Charlene Choi Tsoek-jin (; born 22 November 1982) is a Hong Kong and Canadian actress and singer. She is a member of Hong Kong pop duo Twins, along with Gillian Chung.

==Early life==
Choi was born in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada on 22 November 1982. She moved with her family to Hong Kong a few years later. She was educated at Marymount Secondary School and Rosaryhill School. She is fluent in Cantonese, English and Mandarin. After graduating from Rosaryhill School, where many other would-be pop stars had attended, she started working full-time as a model in Hong Kong. She was scouted by Emperor Entertainment Group (EEG), and was then linked with Gillian Chung to form the Cantopop group Twins.

==Career==
===Acting===

Aside from her musical career, Choi has become a successful actress in the Hong Kong film industry. She wrote an article describing her acting career:
Earlier, I shared with everyone some of my acting experiences. This time, I want to talk about movies. As an artist, whenever I&#x27;m working, I have to show my best side and give my best performance. I have to show the fittest side of me and hence, I&#x27;m often in &quot;battle mode&quot;. When free, I like to watch slow-paced movies. I can&#x27;t stand movies with too much excitement. I&#x27;m the type who can be easily sucked into the world of the movie. That type of fast-paced movie will end up making me tense and nervous so comedy, romance or movies centered on issues of humanity all suit me better.&quot;
Choi&#x27;s first acting gig was a starring role in the 2000 television drama &quot;Youth Y2K&quot;. Choi made her first film debut in 2001 in &quot;Funeral March&quot; (filmed prior to Twins&#x27; debut), which drew rave reviews from critics and earned her a Best New Performer nomination at the 21st Hong Kong Film Awards. Choi&#x27;s next big acting break was in 2003 with her earnest and pretence-free portrayal of a young girl who battles through all odds in hopes of becoming a singer in &quot;Diva – Ah Hey&quot;.

Choi has taken Jim Chim as a mentor, and portrayed a kind and comedic porn star in the comedy film &quot;Simply Actors&quot; (2007). Her breakthrough role in the Pang brothers&#x27; psychological thriller &quot;Diary&quot; (2006) earned her many film award nominations and she received the Best Actress award at the 11th Bucheon International Fantastic Film Festival (BiFan Korean Movie Award). Choi&#x27;s acting was identified by film critics with her portrayal of Dani Dan in &quot;Simply Actors&quot;. She won the Best Actress and Favourite Actress awards at the 2007 Golden Bauhinia Awards for her performance. Choi also played the leading role alongside the Taiwanese singer Jay Chou in the 2008 comedy-action film &quot;Kung Fu Dunk&quot;.

Choi co-starred with Wu Chun and Hu Ge in &quot;The Butterfly Lovers&quot;, based on the Chinese legend of the same name, which was released on 9 October 2008. Throughout the filming, rumors of an off-set romance between Choi and Wu Chun developed. Though they have denied such rumors, Wu stated that the pair reached an agreement with director Jingle Ma to collaborate once again in the future.

In December 2008, she began filming her first Taiwanese television drama, &quot;Calling For Love&quot;, produced by Angie Chai, co-starring with Mike He. The series was first aired in May 2010.

In December 2009 after over a year of post-production, positive response at the Shanghai International Film Festival, &quot;The Storm Warriors&quot; was released with Choi taking on the main female lead role as Second Dream and starring alongside Aaron Kwok, Ekin Cheng, Simon Yam and Nicholas Tse. Though it was only released on 10 December, &quot;The Storm Warriors&quot; ranked fifth in the Hong Kong Chinese-language box office of the year.

In 2010, after having concentrated heavily on music in the previous year, Choi started taking on more acting projects. Her first film for that year was &quot;Beauty on Duty&quot;, which she co-starred with Sandra Ng. Following that, Choi appeared in &quot;Triple Tap&quot; with Daniel Wu and Louis Koo. Choi&#x27;s next film, &quot;The Jade and the Pearl&quot;, saw her co-starring with Raymond Lam and her close friends Joey Yung and Wong Cho-lam, as well as a collaboration between Choi and Lam in singing a duet theme song. Choi concluded work on &quot;God of Fortune&#x27;s Inn&quot; with Nicholas Tse and Nick Cheung. She again co-starred with Nicholas Tse in Mainland Chinese television series &quot;Sword Heroes&#x27; Fate&quot;, which was aired in 2011.

Starring as Chan in &quot;Detective vs Sleuths&quot;, the latest film from director Wai Ka Fai, co-founder of Milkyway Image. As per the director&#x27;s comment during interviews, Choi took the risk by performing many of the stunts herself while shooting.

===Musical career===

Choi&#x27;s first solo song, &quot;Diva, Ah Hey!&quot;, was released in Twins&#x27; 2003 album &quot;Touch of Love&quot;. The song received a nomination for Best Song at the 23rd Hong Kong Film Awards and won a place in the Top 10 Songs at the Jade Solid Gold Songs Awards Ceremony. Choi&#x27;s second solo song, &quot;Watching Movie Alone&quot;, was released in Twins&#x27; 2006 Mandarin album &quot;Around the World with 80 Dollars&quot;. Choi&#x27;s third solo song, &quot;You are Not a Good Lover&quot;, was released in Twins&#x27; 2006 Cantonese album &quot;Ho Hoo Tan&quot;. This was Choi&#x27;s first recorded personal composition and Twins&#x27; recorded version earned the place of Hit Song at the Metro Showbiz Hit Awards and one of the Top 10 Songs at the Jade Solid Gold Songs Awards Ceremony.

Choi&#x27;s remaining two solo songs, &quot;Little Sister&quot; and &quot;60 Percent&quot;, were released before the Edison Chen photo scandal in their 2008 Mandarin album &quot;Tong Hua Yan Yu&quot;. Both solo songs were extremely personal. &quot;Little Sister&quot; in particular recounts Choi&#x27;s relationship with her mother throughout the years despite her parents&#x27; divorce at a young age and won Choi several music awards at the Metro Showbiz Hit Awards and TVB8 Music Awards.

Choi&#x27;s first solo single was released in 2008 with the award-winning &quot;Make a Wish&quot;, which sold 5000 copies within a span of 30 minutes with all proceeds going to the Make-A-Wish Foundation. Meanwhile, her two hit songs, &quot;Little Sister&quot; and &quot;Make a Wish&quot; ranked first in music charts and remained in the top 10 for four music charts over 11 weeks. With Twins placed on hiatus, Choi went on to be awarded with a variety of solo singer awards in 2008: Favorite Idol and Most Voted Singer at the Metro Showbiz Hit Awards, Most Popular Female Singer at the Vanguard Music Awards and Most Popular Hong Kong Female Artist at the Sprite Music Awards.

Towards the end of 2008, Choi further expanded her career, entering new fields of the entertainment industry. In the musical &quot;Knight Star&quot; she stars as the female lead Rose. Acting as her lover, she reunited with Jimmy Lin after seven years. Lin first collaborated with Choi in her first series &quot;The Monkey King: Quest for the Sutra&quot; when she first entered the industry. Other stars in the musical include Julian Cheung, and Alice Liu. The musical served as a promotional event for the Chivas company to expand in China with their &quot;Live with Chivalry&quot; campaign.

Choi&#x27;s first musical collaboration as a solo singer with another artist was the duet &quot;Little Dimples&quot;, released in late September 2008, which she performed with JJ Lin. The song received six awards in the remaining three months of 2008.

Choi released her debut solo album &quot;Two Without One&quot; on 9 April 2009. In less than one week, the album sold 10,000 copies in Hong Kong and has been certified &quot;Gold&quot; in Hong Kong. In less than a month, the album sold a total of 30,000 copies in Hong Kong and was certified &quot;Platinum&quot;. Due to high sales and demand, a second version of the album is slated to be released on 6 May as a limited edition with 5,000 copies available.

Following the success of &quot;Two Without One&quot;, Choi released her next EP, titled &quot;Another Me&quot;, on 15 October 2009. Consisting of five tracks and three music videos, the overall theme of the EP is an evolving process as an individual. The release of &quot;Another Me&quot; marked new territory for Choi with a black-and-white cover and a largescale photo exhibition open to the public. As with &quot;Two Without One&quot;, &quot;Another Me&quot; was also certified &quot;Platinum&quot;, selling nearly 60,000 copies in Hong Kong, in addition to high sales in Asia and overseas. Choi&#x27;s success as a solo female singer in 2009 was best displayed at the 2009 IFPI HK Top Sales Music Awards, where she was awarded &quot;Top 10 Best Selling Hong Kong Singers of 2009&quot;. In addition, &quot;Two Without One&quot; and &quot;Another Me&quot; were each awarded &quot;Top 10 Best Selling Cantonese Albums of 2009.&quot;

Following her success in 2009 as a solo singer, Choi released her debut Mandarin album &quot;As A Sa&quot; in 2010. With more than HK$1 million spent on producing the album, &quot;As A Sa&quot; was released across China on 15 June. Consequently, Choi launched her country-wide promotional tour with a multitude of mini-concerts, autograph sessions, performances, recorded television programs, national radio interviews, and talk shows.

Choi has released her third Cantonese album &quot;Beauty Remains&quot; on 15 October 2010.

Choi reunited with Gillian and released a new song titled &quot;Femininity&quot; to celebrate Twins&#x27; 20th anniversary. The music video was released on 18 May 2021, featuring Twins&#x27; songs including &quot;Strawberry Apple Orange&quot;, &quot;Summer Frenzy&quot;, &quot;Thank You So Much&quot; and &quot;Love is Bigger than the Sky&quot;. Affected by the pandemic and quarantine policy, an online concert &quot;TME live Super Live Twins 20 Love You Anniversary Celebration&quot; was held that month, broadcast live exclusively with Tencent&#x27;s TME and JOOX.

Later in the same year, Choi and Gillian went on recording the theme song for the movie &quot;Sunny Sisters&quot; and released a new song &quot;Nice to Meet You&quot;.

Charlene signed up for the comeback survival reality show &quot;Sister Who Make Waves&quot; season 3 with her long time bandmate Gillian Chung. They were competing against a lineup of a total of 28 female artists with diverse talents. On 5 August 2022, Charlene Choi debuted at 7th place for the third season of &quot;Sisters Who Make Waves&quot; which premiered on 20 May 2022, on Mango TV.

== Personal life ==
Charlene Choi and Ronald Cheng knew each other through the film &quot;The Pursuit of 15 August&quot;, scandals are spread that they are dating in the set of this film. At the beginning of 2010, a news broke out on the internet that they got married. On 17 March 2010, at the promotion of the film &quot;The Secret Order of Beauty&quot;, she said that she had broken up with Cheng for some time, and the two were separated because of mutual understanding. Cheng admitted that he had been separated from Choi during the promotion of the film &quot;The Treasure Box of Yue Guang&quot;. On 27 March 2010, the &quot;Apple Daily&quot; in Hong Kong published the marriage certificate that the two married in the Van Nuys, Los Angeles as early as 31 January 2006. In the evening of the same day, the two attended a press conference and admitted that they were married as early as 2006 and had completed the divorce procedures for several months.

Afterwards, Charlene Choi and William Chan publicly kissed each other after their collaboration in the film &quot;The Secret Order of Beauty&quot;, and they publicly admitted their relationship on 10 October 2010; on 20 September 2015, they both issued a statement on Weibo announcing their breakup

In the fall of 2017, Charlene Choi was rumoured to be dating Shi Hengcong, and later confirmed her new relationship in person during the event. In 2019, Charlene Choi completed her second egg freezing procedure.

==Philanthropy==
As a donor to the Make-A-Wish Foundation since 2001 and a Make a Wish ambassador in 2008, Choi released the hit single and award-winning &#x27;Make a Wish&#x27;, which sold 5000 copies within a span of 30 minutes with all proceeds going to the foundation. Choi also sold clothing from her own &quot;SAL&quot; clothing line to fans to raise more money for the foundation.

Choi also wrote an autobiographical book about her teenage years as a child of divorced parents. Although she remains close to both her parents, Choi lived with her father after her parents&#x27; divorce. However, following her decision to become a singer-actress, the time she spent at home and with her parents rapidly diminished. As a result, the means of communicating with her father became all the more special. In her book &quot;Single Family&#x27;s Love&quot;, many little notes exchanged between her and her father over the years can be seen. Through the autobiography, readers are encouraged to find happiness in single parent families. The money raised from the 5000 Limited 1st Edition copies sold were all donated to the Make a Wish Foundation. Choi thanked her friends and fans for the good sales of her autobiography. Her friends such as Jay Chou (who wrote her book&#x27;s introduction), bandmate Gillian Chung (who also put her thoughts into Choi&#x27;s introduction), Niki Chow, Mani, and Wu Chun were big supporters as well, buying copies for their friends and families. As of now, a new edition of her book is being printed and will be distributed overseas.

Choi became an ambassador for the 30 Hours Famine charity in the beginning of February 2009. She went to Nepal for a week to help the locals by bringing supplies to schools. In return, she was taught the local gardening technique. In April 2009, Choi performed at the 30-Hour Famine Concert, opening the concert and performing an assortment of new Chinese and English songs, as well as old Twins songs for nearly an hour.

<doc id="755719" wikidata="Q4791420" url="?curid=755719" title="Arizona State Prison Complex – Yuma">
<text>Arizona State Prison Complex – Yuma is one of 13 prison facilities operated by the Arizona Department of Corrections (ADC). ASPC–Yuma is located in San Luis, Yuma County, Arizona, 187 miles southwest from the state capital of Phoenix, Arizona. It lies about 12 miles south of downtown Yuma and only about three miles north of the Mexican border.

The &quot;Cocopah Unit&quot;, a 250 bed minimum security facility, readied for inmates in 1986, but was not used until 1987 due to a possible sale to the Federal government that never occurred. The Cocopah Unit, is a level two (low custody) unit. In October 1992, ASP Yuma became part of the Arizona State Prison Complex – Perryville until November 1995 when it became its own prison complex.

In June 1995, the &quot;Cheyenne Unit&quot; began construction using both commercial and inmate labor. In September 1996, the Cheyenne Unit, a level three (medium custody) was opened to receive inmates.

In June 1997, the &quot;Dakota Unit&quot; began construction with only commercial labor and was expected to open in September 1998.

ASPC–Yuma has an inmate capacity of 2,245 in 3 housing units, at security levels 2, 3 and 4. The ADC uses a score classification system to assess each inmate&#x27;s appropriate custody and security level placement. The scores range from 2 to 5, with 5 being the highest risk or need. (level 1 no longer exists). ASPC–Yuma is a modern, medium security prison.

The ASPC–Yuma complex has added two new units in the past 10 years. The new additions are La Paz level 2 and Cibola level 3. The 2 new units house over 2000 inmates. Bringing the population to a total of at least 4,200 inmates incarcerated.

<text>Timothy Richard George Stimpson (born 10 September 1973 in Liverpool) is a former rugby union international full back (and occasional wing). During his career he played for Wakefield, West Hartlepool, Newcastle Falcons, Leicester Tigers, Perpignan, Leeds Tykes and Nottingham, England and the British and Irish Lions. His international career was a start-stop affair, however, he excelled at club level. In particular, during his five-year spell at Leicester Tigers between 1998 and 2003, as a goalkicker, he was an integral part of the dominant Leicester side that won the league four times in succession to add to back-to-back Heineken Cup, becoming the Premiership&#x27;s top points scorer in the process (his points total has now been overtaken by both Jonny Wilkinson and Andy Goode).

==Early life==
Stimpson was educated at Silcoates School, Wakefield. In 1992, he went to the University of Durham, where he studied anthropology at Grey College, graduating in 1995.

==Club career==
Stimpson fell out with Newcastle&#x27;s management and Rob Andrew during the 1997–98 season and only made four appearances for them as they won the Premiership. At the end of the season he signed for Leicester Tigers. After the retirement of Joel Stransky in 1999 he became Leicester Tigers&#x27; principal goalkicker.

In the 2001 Heineken Cup Final against Stade Français he converted Leon Lloyd&#x27;s last minute try from the right-hand touchline—the most difficult position to kick a conversion from for a right-footed kicker—to take the match from 32–30 to 34–30 to Leicester. This meant that to win the match, Stade would have had to score a try rather than the easier task of their fly-half Diego Dominguez, who kicked all of Stade&#x27;s points, landing a goal. There were no further scores.

A year later, in the 2002 Heineken Cup semi-final against Llanelli. With only a few minutes remaining, the score was 10–12 to Llanelli, Stimpson having kicked a penalty and converted Harry Ellis&#x27;s try, Stephen Jones having kicked four penalties for the Scarlets. In windy conditions, Tigers were awarded a penalty at a scrum inside their own half, and Stimpson elected to go for goal from 60m out. The ball hit one of the posts and the crossbar, before going over to give the Tigers a 13–12 lead which they held onto to gain the victory. Tigers went on to win the final against Munster, Stimpson kicking a penalty and a conversion.

In 2003 he was rumoured to be linked to French club Perpignan despite having time left on his contract at Leicester. Despite initial denials from Tigers&#x27; management, he did sign and moved to France after the 2003 World Cup, Tigers releasing him from his contract. However, he failed to play for Perpignan and in 2004 returned to England to play for Leeds Tykes. While at Leeds he helped them win the Powergen Cup in 2005, however he was not in the squad for the final itself. He decided to retire from playing for Leeds Tykes to pursue a career in coaching in January 2006. In the summer of 2006 his services were used by Nottingham Rugby Club, where he presently holds a part-time coaching role.

Stimpson won a record five consecutive Premiership titles with Newcastle Falcons and Leicester Tigers.

The Leeds Tykes Coach, Phil Davies, commented &quot;he will always be remembered as one of the most successful players ever in the professional era in this country&quot;.

==International career==
Stimpson went on the 1997 British Lions tour to South Africa and would have played in the tests as first choice full back were it not for the better goal-kicking of Neil Jenkins that was crucial to the Lions&#x27; series victory.

<text>Stephen Bleecker Luce (March 25, 1827 – July 28, 1917) was an admiral in the United States Navy. Regarded as one of the Navy&#x27;s outstanding officers in many fields, including strategy, seamanship, education, and professional development, he founded and served as the first president of the Naval War College in Newport, Rhode Island. He also co-founded and later served as president of the United States Naval Institute in Annapolis, Maryland.

==Early years and personal life==
Born in Albany, New York, to Dr. Vinal Luce and Charlotte Bleecker, Luce entered the Navy on October 19, 1841, at the age of 14. He was instructed at the Naval School in Philadelphia until 1845, when the United States Naval Academy opened in Annapolis. He graduated from the Academy in 1848 and was warranted as a passed midshipman to date from August 10, 1847. He was promoted to lieutenant on September 15, 1855. 

In 1854, Luce married Elizabeth Henley, a grand-niece of Martha Dandridge Custis Washington, wife of George Washington. Their children included daughter Caroline (1857–1933), who became the wife of Montgomery M. Macomb, later a brigadier general in the United States Army.

=== American Civil War ===
Luce served with the Atlantic Ocean / East Coast blockade squadron during the American Civil War (1861-1865), and commanded the ironclad monitor at the siege of Charleston, South Carolina. He was promoted to lieutenant commander in 1862. He was assigned to the U.S. Naval Academy, which was moved to Newport, Rhode Island, from January 1862 to October 1863. In 1862, while serving as head of the Department of Seamanship, he prepared one of the first seamanship textbooks. During the war, he also commanded the naval vessels USS &quot;Sonoma&quot;, USS &quot;Canadaigua&quot;, and USS &quot;Pontiac&quot;.

He was promoted to full commander in 1866.

=== Post-Civil War ===
After the Civil War, Luce organized the Navy&#x27;s apprentice training program to prepare naval seamen and petty officers for fleet duty. From 1869 to 1872, he commanded the sloop-of-war USS &quot;Juniata&quot; which was assigned to the Mediterranean Sea Fleet. He was promoted to captain in December 1872 and served as the captain of the yard at the Boston Navy Yard (at Charlestown, Massachusetts, across the Charles River from Boston), until 1875. He commanded the &quot;USS Hartford&quot; from November 1875 to August 1877. From August to December 1877, Luce was the Navy&#x27;s inspector of training ships, then from January 1878 to February 1881, he commanded the training ship USS &quot;Minnesota&quot;.

From July to September 1884, Luce commanded the North Atlantic Squadron with the &quot;USS Tennessee&quot; as his flagship. From June 1886 to February 1889, Luce again commanded the North Atlantic Squadron with the &quot;USS Richmond&quot; this time as his flagship.

Luce helped start the United States Naval Institute in October 1873; he would serve as the Institute&#x27;s president from 1887 to 1898.

==== Newport ====
In 1881, Luce was promoted to commodore, and commanded the U.S. Navy Training Squadron in Newport from April 1881 to June 1884.

While in command of the Training Squadron, Luce developed and implemented the apprentice training program—the first formal program for training American enlisted sailors. Luce&#x27;s plan was to have bright and healthy young men, 14 to 17 years old, serve a three-year apprenticeship with the Training Squadron during which they received an academic education and hands-on seamanship training.

The &quot;boys&quot; were typically enlisted around 14 or 15 and typically served until 21, when they could extend their service in the Navy. Previously, the Navy had taken recruits with no prior experience; all training of enlisted sailors was &quot;on the job&quot;. Many recruits lacked the discipline and skills necessary to be useful. The program ended when the United States entered the First World War in April 1917 and began to train sailors far more rapidly as the Navy expanded.

Based on Luce&#x27;s urgings and exhaustive reports, the Naval War College at Newport, Rhode Island, was established on October 6, 1884. Luce served as its first president. In 1885, he was promoted to rear admiral, and the next year handed off the presidency to Captain Alfred Thayer Mahan.

=== Retirement ===
The wooden-hulled, steam-powered sloop-of-war &quot;Richmond&quot;, was Luce&#x27;s last assignment at sea. Having reached the mandatory retirement age of 62, he retired from the Navy on March 25, 1889. 

Luce returned to the War College in 1901 and served for nearly a further decade as a faculty member. He retired in November 1910 at the age of 83.

==Affiliations==
Luce belonged to several military societies. In 1894, Luce joined the Aztec Club of 1847, a military society of U.S. Army and Navy officers who had served during the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, and served as its vice president from 1909 until 1910 and as its president from 1910 to 1911.

He joined the Pennsylvania Commandery of the Military Order of Foreign Wars (MOFW) in 1896 and became the founding commander of the Rhode Island Commandery of the MOFW in 1900. He was also a member of the Military Order of the Loyal Legion of the United States (insignia number 13,113) and the Naval Order of the United States.

In 1901, he was elected to the board of directors of the Redwood Library in Newport.

An active member of the Protestant Episcopal Church, Luce served as a vestryman of two Newport churches: All Saints Memorial Chapel and St. John&#x27;s Episcopal Church, where he also served as a warden.

==Death and burial==
Luce died on July 28, 1917 and was buried in the churchyard of St. Mary&#x27;s Episcopal Church in Portsmouth, Rhode Island.

==Publications==
In 1863, David Van Nostrand published Luce&#x27;s textbook &quot;Seamanship&quot;, intended for use at the Naval Academy. A later edition appeared in 1905.

In December 1891, &quot;The North American Review&quot; published Luce&#x27;s paper &quot;The Benefits of War&quot;.

Luce also edited &quot;The Patriotic and Naval Songster&quot; (1883).

<doc id="755749" wikidata="Q311374" url="?curid=755749" title="Alexander Ovechkin">
<text>Alexander Mikhailovich Ovechkin (; born 17 September 1985) is a Russian professional ice hockey left winger and captain of the Washington Capitals of the National Hockey League (NHL). Nicknamed &quot;The Great 8&quot; in reference to his jersey number and &quot;Ovi&quot; as a shortform of his last name, Ovechkin is widely regarded as one of the greatest ice hockey players of all time. Second only to Wayne Gretzky in all-time goal scoring, Ovechkin holds many NHL career records, including the most power play goals, most goals in away games, most overtime goals, most goalies scored upon, and most goals with one team in NHL history. Ovechkin is one of just three players in NHL history to score 800 career goals, along with Gretzky and Gordie Howe.

Ovechkin began his professional career with Dynamo Moscow of the Russian Superleague in 2001, playing there for four seasons and returning briefly during the 2012–13 NHL lockout. A highly touted prospect, Ovechkin was selected by the Capitals first overall in the 2004 NHL Entry Draft. In the 2005–06 season, Ovechkin&#x27;s first with the Capitals, he scored 52 goals and 54 assists to lead all rookies in points, capturing the Calder Memorial Trophy as rookie of the year and finishing third overall in league scoring.

Ovechkin has won the Maurice &quot;Rocket&quot; Richard Trophy, awarded annually to the NHL&#x27;s leading goal scorer, an NHL-record nine times, first doing so in 2007–08, when his 65 goals and 112 points also earned him the Art Ross Trophy for most points scored. He holds the NHL record for most 40-goal seasons with thirteen and co-holds, with Mike Bossy and Gretzky, the record for most 50-goal campaigns with nine. He is also the only player to have tallied 200 or more goals in three different decades, with 245 in the 2000s, 437 in the 2010s, and 200 in the 2020s. He has won the Hart Memorial Trophy for most valuable player three times (in 2008, 2009, and 2013), and the Lester B. Pearson Award/Ted Lindsay Award for best player as voted on by the National Hockey League Players&#x27; Association three times (2008, 2009, 2010). In 2018, Ovechkin won the Stanley Cup for the first time, and was awarded the Conn Smythe Trophy for most valuable player in the 2018 playoffs. He has also been named to the NHL first All-Star team eight times, and the second All-Star team four times. In 2017, Ovechkin was named one of the 100 Greatest NHL Players of all time.

Internationally, Ovechkin has represented Russia in multiple tournaments. His first IIHF tournament was the 2002 World U18 Championship. The following year he made his debut at the World Junior Championship, helping Russia win the gold medal. He played two more years at the World Juniors, as well as once more at the World U18 Championships. Ovechkin&#x27;s first senior tournament was the 2004 World Championship, and he also played in the World Cup that year. Ovechkin has also played for Russia at the Winter Olympics in 2006, 2010, and 2014. Overall, Ovechkin has represented Russia at thirteen World Championships and three Olympics in his career, winning the World Championship three times.

==Early life==
Ovechkin was born on 17 September 1985 in Moscow, the son of Soviet athletes. His mother, Tatyana Ovechkina, is a two-time Olympic gold medalist (1976, 1980) and world champion (1975) in basketball. His father, Mikhail, was a football player. He has two older brothers, Sergei and Mikhail. His mother sensed her youngest son was destined for &quot;sporting greatness&quot;. &quot;From birth, it was obvious,&quot; she said. &quot;In a child, it&#x27;s clear immediately. He was very active and walking and curious.&quot; Early on, Ovechkin did not have a television growing up, but learned of the NHL and its biggest stars like Wayne Gretzky, Mario Lemieux, and Sergei Fedorov through videotapes that showed highlights of goals, hits, and fights. His favorite NHL team growing up was the San Jose Sharks and also was the first NHL jersey he received. He was two years old when he first picked up a hockey stick. Whenever a hockey game came on television, he would drop whatever he was doing, refusing to allow his parents to change the channel.

In early childhood, he moved with his family to a tall high-rise building surrounded by a &quot;crumbling neighborhood&quot; on the outskirts of Moscow. There he attended public school #596, infamous for military discipline and a &quot;tyrannical&quot; principal, completing eight and a half grades before starting at Dynamo Moscow&#x27;s sports school. While he saw his friends &quot;getting high and getting dead,&quot; Ovechkin was attending daily training sessions morning and night. &quot;You dive into sport with your head and arms and legs, and there&#x27;s no time for anything else,&quot; he said of this early training.

Whenever his parents were no longer able to get young Alex to hockey events, his elder brother Sergei stepped up, making sure his little brother got where he needed to go. When Ovechkin was 10, his brother Sergei died of a blood clot following a car accident. Ovechkin had a youth hockey game the next day, which his parents insisted he play in. Ovechkin credits his elder brother Sergei for introducing him to, and encouraging him to pursue hockey. When he scores, Alex will often kiss his glove and point to the sky in a salute to his brother.

Ovechkin established his reputation within the Dynamo Moscow system by scoring 56 goals at the age of 11, surpassing the previous record held by Pavel Bure, who had scored 53 goals. Meanwhile, Ovechkin dreamed of playing in the NHL, keeping the cards of star players stashed in his room, especially those of his idol, Mario Lemieux. &quot;It&#x27;s the best hockey there is,&quot; Ovechkin would say of the NHL.

==Playing career==

===Dynamo Moscow (2001–2005)===
Ovechkin began playing in the Russian Super League (RSL) for Dynamo Moscow at the age of 16. Making his professional debut in the 2001–02 season, he scored four points in 21 games. He would spend three seasons there prior to being drafted by the NHL, and he would rack up 36 goals and 32 assists in 152 career games.

The following off-season, Ovechkin was selected first overall in the 2004 NHL Entry Draft by the Washington Capitals. He had been projected as the first overall pick for nearly two years and had earned comparisons to Mario Lemieux. He was so highly regarded that the Florida Panthers attempted to draft him in the 2003 NHL Entry Draft in the ninth round, even though his birthday was two days after the cut-off (15 September 1985). Rick Dudley, the general manager of the Panthers, claimed the pick was legitimate, claiming that Ovechkin was old enough with leap years taken into consideration.

Due to the 2004–05 NHL lockout, Ovechkin remained with Dynamo for one more season. He recorded 27 points in 37 games in 2004–05, while missing nearly two months of play because of a shoulder injury sustained in the gold medal game against Canada in the 2005 World Junior Championships. In the playoffs, he helped Dynamo win the RSL title.

With the threat of the lockout canceling another NHL season, Ovechkin signed a contract with rival Russian team Avangard Omsk. In order to maintain his eligibility for the NHL in the event that the lockout ended, the contract contained an out clause with a 20 July 2005 deadline. Although a new NHL collective bargaining agreement (CBA) had not yet been reached between players and owners, Ovechkin decided to opt out and signed with the Capitals on 5 August 2005. The deal was a three-year, entry-level contract worth the rookie maximum of $984,200 per season with performance-based bonuses to inflate his annual salary to as much as $3.9 million.

===Washington Capitals (2005–present)===

====Early dominance (2005–2007)====

Two days after signing, the lockout ended with a new CBA. Ovechkin played his first game with the Capitals in the 2005–06 season opener on 5 October 2005, scoring two goals against goalie Pascal Leclaire in a 3–2 victory over the Columbus Blue Jackets. On 13 January 2006, in Anaheim, Ovechkin scored his first career hat trick against Jean-Sébastien Giguère of the Mighty Ducks of Anaheim to help Washington win the game. Three days later, on 16 January, he scored a goal that veteran hockey reporter Bill Clement called &quot;one of the greatest goals of all time.&quot; Knocked down by Phoenix Coyotes defenceman Paul Mara and sliding on his back facing away from the net, Ovechkin was able to hook the puck with one hand on his stick and slide it into the net past goalie Brian Boucher for his second goal of the night. It became referred to as &quot;The Goal.&quot; Auston Matthews, a future Toronto Maple Leafs first overall selection, was in attendance during the game; he said in an interview in November 2016, shortly into the 2016–17 season that it was the best goal he ever saw live. On 1 February, Ovechkin was named NHL Rookie of the Month for January 2006 as well as being named Offensive Player of the Month, becoming only the third player in NHL history to earn both honors simultaneously. Ovechkin finished the 2005–06 season leading all NHL rookies in goals, points, power play goals and shots. He finished third overall in the NHL in scoring with 106 points and tied for third in goals with 52 and 54 assists. His 425 shots led the league, set an NHL rookie record, and was the fourth-highest total in NHL history. Ovechkin&#x27;s point total was the second-best in Washington Capitals history and his goals total tied for third in franchise history. He was also named to the NHL first All-Star team, the first rookie to receive the honor in 15 years. After the season ended, Ovechkin received the Calder Memorial Trophy, awarded to the NHL&#x27;s best rookie.
He was also a finalist in his rookie season for the Lester B. Pearson Award, which ultimately went to New York Rangers winger Jaromír Jágr. EA Sports made him one of the cover athletes for &quot;NHL 07&quot;.

In the 2006–07 season, Ovechkin appeared in his first NHL All-Star Game in on 24 January 2007. He completed his second NHL season with 46 goals, 46 assists and 92 points in all 82 games.

====Hart Trophy wins, beginning of captaincy (2007–2013)====
On 12 October 2007, Ovechkin scored his 100th NHL goal against goaltender Henrik Lundqvist in a 3–2 loss to the New York Rangers. Playing in the final season of his rookie contract, in 2007–08, Ovechkin signed a 13-year contract extension worth $124 million with the Capitals on 10 January 2008. The contract, which averages $9.5 million per year, was the richest in NHL history. Working without an agent, Ovechkin negotiated with Capitals owner Ted Leonsis and former general manager George McPhee.
Late in the season on 3 March against the Boston Bruins, Ovechkin notched his 50th, 51st and 52nd goals of the campaign for his fourth career NHL hat trick and to hit the 50-goal mark for the second time in his career. Later that month, on 21 March, Ovechkin scored his 59th and 60th goals of the season against the Atlanta Thrashers, becoming the first NHL player to score 60 goals in a season since Mario Lemieux and Jaromír Jágr in 1995–96 and 19th player overall. Four days later, on 25 March against the Carolina Hurricanes, Ovechkin scored his 61st goal of the season to break the Washington Capitals&#x27; team record for goals in a single season previously held by Dennis Maruk. He also went on to break Luc Robitaille&#x27;s record for most goals by a left winger in one season on 3 April, by scoring two goals for his 64th and 65th of the season. He also became the first NHL player to score at least 40 even-strength goals in one season since Pavel Bure in 1999–2000. Leading the league in scoring with 65 goals, 47 assists and 112 points in all 82 games played, Ovechkin captured both the Art Ross Trophy and the Maurice &quot;Rocket&quot; Richard Trophy in 2007–08. It was the first time in 41 seasons that a left-winger led the NHL in points since Bobby Hull led the league with 97 points in 1965–66. Ovechkin helped lead a rejuvenated Capitals team back to the Stanley Cup playoffs for the first time since 2003 with a stronger supporting cast that included winger and countryman Alexander Semin, rookie center Nicklas Bäckström and defenceman Mike Green as the team finished third in the East. He scored the game-winning goal in his NHL playoff debut with less than five minutes left in game 1 of the first round of the 2008 playoffs on 11 April against the sixth-seeded Philadelphia Flyers. He scored nine points (four goals and five assists) in all seven games against the Flyers as the Capitals were eliminated in the opening round. After the season ended, Ovechkin was awarded the Lester B. Pearson Award as the most outstanding player voted by the National Hockey League Players&#x27; Association (NHLPA) and the Hart Memorial Trophy as the league&#x27;s MVP, becoming the first player in the history of the NHL to win four major regular season awards, including the Art Ross and Rocket Richard trophies. Ovechkin was also awarded his third consecutive Kharlamov Trophy, named after Soviet hockey star Valeri Kharlamov and presented by &quot;Sovetsky Sport&quot; newspaper, as the best Russian NHL player as voted by other Russian NHL players.
On 27 October 2008, shortly into the 2008–09 season, Ovechkin returned home to Moscow to visit his ailing grandfather, missing only the second game of his career up to that point, snapping a consecutive streak of 203 games played. On 5 February 2009, Ovechkin scored his 200th goal, against Jonathan Quick of the Los Angeles Kings, becoming only the fourth player in the NHL to reach the milestone in four seasons, joining Wayne Gretzky, Mike Bossy and Mario Lemieux. On 19 March, he scored his 50th goal of the season against the Tampa Bay Lightning, becoming the first Washington Capitals player to reach the 50-goal mark three times. He finished the campaign with 56 goals to capture his second consecutive Rocket Richard Trophy, joining Jarome Iginla and Pavel Bure as the third player to win the award twice and the second player after Bure (2000 and 2001) to win the award in back-to-back seasons. With 110 points (56 goals and 54 assists), he finished as runner-up to countryman Evgeni Malkin of the Pittsburgh Penguins for the Art Ross Trophy. Ovechkin and the Capitals repeated as division champions en route to meeting the New York Rangers in the opening round. After advancing to the second round in seven games and erasing a 3–1 series deficit against the Rangers, Ovechkin notched his first NHL playoff hat trick on 4 May, in game 2 against the Pittsburgh Penguins to help Washington to a 4–3 win. The Capitals were eventually defeated by Pittsburgh, the fourth seed in the East and eventual Stanley Cup champions, in seven games. Ovechkin finished the 2009 playoffs with a postseason career-high 21 points (11 goals, 10 assists) in all 14 games. He went on to win the Hart and Pearson trophies for the second consecutive year, becoming the seventeenth player in league history to win the Hart multiple times.
Just over a month into the 2009–10 season, Ovechkin suffered an upper-body injury during a game against the Columbus Blue Jackets on 1 November 2009, after a collision with opposing forward Raffi Torres. After returning, Ovechkin was suspended by the NHL on 1 December for two games (one for the action, and one for a second game misconduct penalty during the season) for a knee-on-knee hit to Carolina Hurricanes defenceman Tim Gleason during a game the previous day. Both Gleason and Ovechkin had to be helped off the ice, although Gleason later returned during the game, while Ovechkin did not. Ovechkin was assessed a five-minute major penalty and a game misconduct at the time. Capitals head coach Bruce Boudreau commented that Ovechkin&#x27;s style of play was at times &quot;reckless.&quot; The suspension was Ovechkin&#x27;s first of his career, causing him to forfeit $98,844.16 in salary.
On 5 January 2010, Ovechkin was named captain of the Washington Capitals after previous captain Chris Clark was traded to the Columbus Blue Jackets. He became the first European, second-youngest and 14th overall captain in team history. On 5 February, at a game against the New York Rangers, Ovechkin, with his second goal and third point of the game, reached the 500-point milestone of his NHL career. He is the fifth player to achieve the milestone in only five seasons, reaching it in 373 career games. On 14 March, at a game against the Chicago Blackhawks at United Center, Ovechkin sent Blackhawks&#x27; defenceman Brian Campbell into the boards after Campbell had dumped the puck to the blue line. Ovechkin was called for boarding, receiving a five-minute major and a game misconduct, and was suspended for two games (for a third game misconduct of the season, a two-game suspension is automatic). Campbell suffered a fractured clavicle and fractured rib, and was expected to be out seven-to-eight weeks.
Ovechkin won the Ted Lindsay Award, becoming only the second player in NHL history to win the award in three consecutive years. He also led the NHL in goals per game and points per game for three straight seasons, from 2008 to 2010. Ovechkin is the Capitals&#x27; all-time leader in goals. His 50 goals made him the runner up for the Richard Trophy which went to Pittsburgh Penguins forward and captain Sidney Crosby and Tampa Bay Lightning forward Steven Stamkos who both had 51 goals for league leader(s) in goals. Ovechkin was also the runner up for the Art Ross Trophy for the second straight season (alongside Crosby with both players having 109 points) only behind Vancouver Canucks forward Henrik Sedin, who ended with 112 points. In 2009–10 Ovechkin surpassed the mark of Hall of Fame goaltender Bill Durnan (first four seasons from 1943–44 through 1946–47) and became the first player in NHL history voted a First Team All-Star in each of his first five seasons. Ovechkin also recorded 10 points (five goals and assists) in the 2010 playoffs as the Capitals would lose the series in seven games to the eighth-seeded Montreal Canadiens, surrendering a 3–1 series lead in the process.

On 1 January 2011, Ovechkin and the Capitals took part in the New Year&#x27;s Day NHL Winter Classic, facing the Pittsburgh Penguins. While Ovechkin did not score any points in his first career outdoor game, the Capitals won 3–1. On 9 March, in a 5–0 victory over the Edmonton Oilers, Ovechkin recorded his 600th career point with an assist on a goal by Eric Fehr. On 5 April against the Toronto Maple Leafs, Ovechkin scored his 300th career goal against Maple Leafs goaltender James Reimer, becoming the sixth-youngest and seventh-fastest player to do so. He ended the 2010–11 season with 32 goals and 53 assists for 85 points in 79 contests. In the 2011 playoffs, Ovechkin recorded 10 points (five goals and assists) in all nine games as the top-seeded Capitals defeated the eighth-seeded New York Rangers in five games in the first round before getting swept in the second round by the fifth-seeded Tampa Bay Lightning.

On 3 December 2011, Ovechkin played in his 500th NHL game in a 3–2 OT win over the Ottawa Senators and ended the game with an assist recorded on a goal by Troy Brouwer. On 23 January 2012, Ovechkin received a three-game suspension for a hit on Zbyněk Michálek of the Pittsburgh Penguins. The following day, Ovechkin announced he would not attend the 2012 NHL All-Star Game due to the suspension. Ovechkin ended the 2011–12 season with 38 goals and 27 assists for 65 points in 78 games as the Capitals as a team finished as the seventh seed in the East. In the 2012 playoffs, Ovechkin and the Capitals would upset the defending Stanley Cup champion and second-seeded Boston Bruins in seven games before getting defeated in the second round by the top-seeded New York Rangers in seven games. He would end the playoffs with five goals and four assists for nine points in all 14 games.

During the lockout in the first half of the shortened 2012–13 season, Ovechkin went to play in the KHL and re-joined Dynamo Moscow with his teammate Nicklas Bäckström. In 31 games for the team, Ovechkin scored 19 goals, 21 assists and 40 points. At the end of the season, the Dynamo would go on to win the Gagarin Cup, albeit after the NHL lockout concluded and Ovechkin and Bäckström returned to North America in January 2013. However, Ovechkin and Bäckström still received championship rings from the team. In the abbreviated 2012–13 season, Ovechkin led the NHL in goal scoring with 32, earning him his third Rocket Richard Trophy. He also added 24 assists to give him 56 total points in all 48 games played of the season, good for third-most points in the NHL with only Tampa Bay Lightning stars Steven Stamkos and league leader Martin St. Louis ahead. In the 2013 playoffs, Ovechkin was limited to a goal and an assist for two points in all seven games as the third-seeded Capitals would lose in the first round in seven games by the sixth-seeded New York Rangers and giving up a 3–2 series lead during the series. After the season ended, he was also awarded the Hart Memorial Trophy for the third time in his career. Ovechkin was also a finalist for the Ted Lindsay Award for the fifth time in his career, which was eventually given to Pittsburgh Penguins captain and centre Sidney Crosby. After the season, Ovechkin made history by being named to both the first and second NHL All-Star teams. He had switched to playing right wing that entire season and thus was voted the first All-Star team&#x27;s right wing, but because some voters were not aware of the change, they voted for him at his traditional left wing position, thereby also landing him at left wing on the second All-Star team.

====Continued success, Stanley Cup championship and Conn Smythe Trophy (2013–2019)====
On 20 December 2013, in a game against the Carolina Hurricanes, Ovechkin scored into an empty net for his 400th career goal. He became the sixth-fastest player to ever reach that mark, getting it in 634 games, one fewer than Pavel Bure. At the conclusion of the 2013–14 season, Ovechkin had the strange distinction of winning the Maurice &quot;Rocket&quot; Richard Trophy, scoring 51 goals, while going −35, one of the NHL&#x27;s worst, in the plus-minus statistic. However, the Capitals missed the 2014 playoffs by three points, marking the first time since 2006–07 where Ovechkin and the Capitals missed the playoffs.

On 4 November 2014, in a game against the Calgary Flames, Ovechkin recorded his 826th point, a franchise record, surpassing Peter Bondra, who previously held the record with 825 points. On 31 March 2015, in a game against the Carolina Hurricanes, Ovechkin scored his 50th goal of the year on Hurricanes goaltender Cam Ward and became the sixth player in NHL history to have six 50-goal seasons, joining Guy Lafleur, Mike Bossy, Wayne Gretzky, Marcel Dionne and Mario Lemieux. On 2 April, Ovechkin scored his 51st and 52nd goals of the season in a 5–4 shootout win against Carey Price of the Montreal Canadiens, surpassing Bondra as the franchise leader in goals scored. It was also his 15th multi-goal game of the season, none of which was a hat trick. Ovechkin finished the 2014–15 season with 81 games played and 53 goals, 28 assists and 81 points. His 53 goals once again led the league in goal scoring, capturing his fifth Rocket Richard Trophy as a result. Ovechkin was named a finalist for the Hart Memorial Trophy for the fifth time in his career and the Ted Lindsay Award for the sixth time, both awards were ultimately awarded to Montreal Canadiens goaltender Carey Price. In the 2015 playoffs, Ovechkin recorded five goals and four assists for nine points in all 14 playoff games as the fourth-seeded Capitals defeated the fifth-seeded New York Islanders in seven games in the first round before getting defeated in the second round in seven games by the Presidents&#x27; Trophy-winning New York Rangers (despite the Capitals initially having a 3–1 series lead before the eventual 4–3 series defeat).

On 7 November 2015, shortly into the 2015–16 season, in the second period of a game against the Toronto Maple Leafs, Ovechkin scored his eighth goal of the season to tie Sergei Fedorov&#x27;s tally for the most goals among Russian born players, with 483. On 19 November, Ovechkin scored his ninth goal of the season against goaltender Kari Lehtonen in a 3–2 loss to the Dallas Stars; that goal broke Fedorov&#x27;s record. On 10 January 2016, Ovechkin scored his 500th and 501st goals in a 7–1 victory over the Ottawa Senators against goaltender Andrew Hammond, becoming the 43rd player to reach the 500-goal plateau, and the fifth-fastest player to do so in his 801st game, as well as the first Russian. On 9 April, in the 2015–16 season finale against the St. Louis Blues, Ovechkin scored his 50th goal of the season and became the third player in NHL history to have seven or more 50-goal seasons. During the 2015–16 season, Ovechkin, for the first time in his career, did not lead the Washington Capitals in points, although he still led the team in goals and the entire league with 50 for his sixth Rocket Richard Trophy, and finished second on the team in points with 71, behind fellow countryman Evgeny Kuznetsov, who finished with 77. The Capitals would win the Presidents&#x27; Trophy as the regular season champions. Ovechkin was named a finalist for the Mark Messier Leadership Award for his contributions both on and off the ice during the regular season, which was eventually awarded to Nashville Predators defenceman and captain Shea Weber. In the second round of the 2016 playoffs after defeating the Philadelphia Flyers in six games in the first round, the Capitals lost the series to the Pittsburgh Penguins in game six after a 4–3 overtime defeat.

On 11 January 2017, Ovechkin scored his 1,000th career point with a goal on Marc-André Fleury in a 7–1 win over the Pittsburgh Penguins, becoming the 37th player in NHL history to reach 1,000 points with only one team. Ovechkin finished the 2016–17 season playing all 82 games with 33 goals, 36 assists and 69 points to help the Capitals clinch their second consecutive Presidents&#x27; Trophy and third in franchise history. In the 2017 playoffs, the Capitals defeated the eighth-seeded Toronto Maple Leafs in the first round. Still, they were defeated in the second round for the second consecutive year by the eventual Stanley Cup champion Pittsburgh Penguins, this time in seven games. In the fallout of their playoff loss, Ovechkin was considered among the greatest players to have never won the Stanley Cup. Upon returning to training camp the following season, Ovechkin arrived in Washington two weeks early and predicted: &quot;We&#x27;re not gonna fucking suck this year .&quot;

Ovechkin broke many NHL and Capitals&#x27; records during the 2017–18 season. On 7 October 2017, he became the first player in 100 years with back-to-back hat tricks to start the season against the Ottawa Senators and Montreal Canadiens, respectively. On 21 October, in a game against the Detroit Red Wings, Ovechkin surpassed Jaromír Jágr for most regular season overtime goals with the 20th of his career. On 25 November, Ovechkin passed Peter Bondra as the team&#x27;s all-time leader in hat tricks with his 20th of his career. On 25 January 2018, Ovechkin recorded his 500th career assist on a Nicklas Bäckström goal in a 4–2 win over the Florida Panthers. On 12 March, Ovechkin scored his 600th career goal against Connor Hellebuyck of the Winnipeg Jets, making him the 20th player to do so, and the fourth to do so in fewer than 1,000 games. On 1 April, Ovechkin would play against the Pittsburgh Penguins in his 1,000th NHL game, becoming the first Capitals player to play 1,000 games and the 54th NHL player to do so with the same franchise. At the conclusion of the season, Ovechkin was awarded the Rocket Richard trophy for the seventh time in his career with his league leading 49 goals. He became the second player, tied with Bobby Hull, to win the NHL&#x27;s goal scoring title seven times. Besides his 49 goals, Ovechkin also recorded 38 assists for 87 points in all 82 contests played as the Capitals finished as the second seed in the Eastern Conference and fifth in the NHL overall. During the 2018 playoffs, Ovechkin scored 15 goals, 12 assists and 27 points in all 24 games averaging 20:44 of ice time per game. After defeating the seventh-seeded Columbus Blue Jackets in six games in the first round, the Capitals would once again meet their longtime rivals, the Pittsburgh Penguins, in the second round for the third straight season; headed by Penguins centre and captain Sidney Crosby, Ovechkin&#x27;s main rival for the greatest player of their generation. Ovechkin assisted on Evgeny Kuznetsov&#x27;s game six overtime goal for 4–2 defeat in the series against the two-time defending Stanley Cup champion and fourth-seeded Penguins to clinch his first Eastern Conference Finals appearance in 13 seasons. After defeating the Penguins in round two, Ovechkin would face another main rival of his generation in Tampa Bay Lightning centre and captain Steven Stamkos in the Eastern Conference Finals. Ovechkin and the Capitals recovered from a 3–2 series deficit to defeat the top-seeded Lightning in seven games and reach the Stanley Cup Finals, the second time in franchise history (they previously did in 1998 before Ovechkin came to the team), and defeated the second-seeded Vegas Golden Knights in five games to win the Stanley Cup for the first time in franchise history and first in Ovechkin&#x27;s career. Ovechkin won the Conn Smythe Trophy, awarded to the most valuable player for his team in the playoffs by NHL commissioner Gary Bettman.

On 6 December 2018, Ovechkin became the fastest player in NHL history and ninth overall to take 5,000 shots on goal, reaching that mark in 1,031 career games. Marcel Dionne, the previous holder of the record, required 184 more games than Ovechkin. He scored the 21st hat trick of his NHL career in a 6–2 win over Detroit Red Wings on 11 December, passing Pavel Bure for most by a Russian-born player in league history. On 14 December in a 6–5 shootout win over the Carolina Hurricanes, Ovechkin recorded his 23rd career hat trick with one of those goals being the 237th power play goal of his career on Hurricanes goaltender Scott Darling to pass Mario Lemieux for most power play goals with one franchise. Ovechkin had a career-best 14 game point streak from 16 November to 15 December, which included back-to-back hat tricks against the Red Wings on 10 December and Hurricanes on 15 December, respectively. On 2 January 2019, Ovechkin was named a captain for the upcoming 2019 National Hockey League All-Star Game, but announced that he was choosing to skip the game to rest, forcing him to serve an automatic one game suspension as a result. Ovechkin ended the 2018–19 season with 51 goals, 38 assists and 89 points in 81 games played while the Capitals as a team finished as the Metropolitan division champions for the fourth consecutive season and the second seed in the Eastern Conference overall for the second consecutive season and fourth in the NHL overall. His 51 goals earned him the Rocket Richard Trophy for the eighth time in his NHL career. Ovechkin would also record four goals and five assists for nine points in all seven playoff games as the defending Stanley Cup champion Capitals were upset in seven games in the first round of the 2019 playoffs by the seventh-seeded Carolina Hurricanes, despite having a 3–2 series lead at one point.

====Recent years, goal-record pursuit (2019–present)====
On 30 November 2019, in a 5–2 win over the Detroit Red Wings at Little Caesars Arena, Ovechkin recorded his 24th career hat trick which passed Jari Kurri for 10th most hat tricks in NHL history. In that same game, he also recorded an assist on a goal by Tom Wilson for a four point night. On January 24, 2020, Ovechkin was named to the NHL all decade team for the 2010s. He ended the 2010s decade as the leading goal scorer (437 goals between January 1, 2010 to December 31, 2019) and the third most points (with 780), only trailing Sidney Crosby (788) and Patrick Kane (802), respectively. Ovechkin would be named captain for the 2020 National Hockey League All-Star Game, and again chose to skip the game on January 26, to rest, and would serve another automatic one game suspension. On 22 February, Ovechkin scored his 700th career goal in the third period of a 3–2 loss against the New Jersey Devils at Prudential Center, making him the eighth player in NHL history to accomplish the feat. The 2019–20 season ended three weeks early due to restriction surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic, so Ovechkin and Boston Bruins forward David Pastrňák were named co-winners of the Rocket Richard Trophy, with each having 48 goals at the time.

The 2020–21 season would mark the first time in Ovechkin&#x27;s NHL career where he would not score at least 30 goals and having finished with 24 goals mainly due to the season being shortened due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.

Ovechkin signed a five-year, $47.5 million contract extension with the Capitals on 27 July 2021. He scored his 28th career hat trick, tying Marcel Dionne and Bobby Hull for sixth most in NHL history, on 26 November against the Florida Panthers. On 31 December, Ovechkin scored his 275th power play goal against the Detroit Red Wings, breaking Dave Andreychuk&#x27;s all-time record. On 15 March 2022, Ovechkin scored his 767th career NHL goal in a 4–3 win over the New York Islanders, moving him into third place for goals scored all-time in the NHL, passing Jaromír Jágr; he achieved the feat in 477 fewer games than Jagr, yet had also taken 400 more shots on goal. On 20 April, in a 4–3 overtime loss against the Vegas Golden Knights, he scored his 50th goal of the season for the ninth time in his career, tying Mike Bossy and Wayne Gretzky for having the most 50-goal seasons in NHL history. At 36 years and 215 days of age, he is the oldest player to score 50 goals in a season; the previous oldest was Johnny Bucyk, doing so at the age of 35 years and 308 days. He ended the 2021–22 season with 50 goals, 40 assists and 90 points in 77 games played as the Capitals finished the season as the eighth and final seed in the Eastern Conference. Ovechkin would also record a goal and five assists for six points in all six playoff games in the Capitals first round loss in the 2022 playoffs by the Presidents&#x27; Trophy-winning Florida Panthers.
On 5 November 2022, Ovechkin scored his 787th goal with the Washington Capitals against the Arizona Coyotes, setting a new NHL record for most goals with one team, a record previously held by Gordie Howe. He set another NHL best on 29 November, surpassing Gretzky for most road goals with 403, after scoring two goals against the Vancouver Canucks. Ovechkin became the third player in NHL history to score 800 regular season goals, behind Howe and Gretzky, by scoring a hat trick against the Chicago Blackhawks at United Center on 13 December. It was also his 29th hat trick in the NHL, giving him the sixth most hat tricks by any player in the league&#x27;s history. On 23 December, Ovechkin scored his 801st and 802nd career goals in a 4–1 win against the Winnipeg Jets, passing Gordie Howe for the second most goals in NHL history, behind only Wayne Gretzky. Ovechkin tied Mike Gartner for having the most 30-goal seasons upon recording a 30-goal season for the 17th time on 14 January 2023, in a 3–1 loss to the Philadelphia Flyers. He surpassed Gretzky to set a new NHL record for most 40-goal seasons after securing his 13th on 21 March, in a 7–6 overtime loss to the Columbus Blue Jackets. The Capitals would miss the 2023 playoffs by 12 points in the standings mainly due to injuries to other players on the team, marking the first time since 2014 where the Capitals missed the playoffs. Despite the team difficulties, Ovechkin still continued his individual success by having ended the 2022–23 season with 42 goals, 33 assists and 75 points in 73 games played.

On 7 December 2023, Ovechkin recorded his 1,500th point with an assist on a goal scored by Dylan Strome in a 5–4 shootout loss to the Dallas Stars to become the 16th player in NHL history to reach the mark. Ovechkin later scored his 57th career empty-net goal in a 3–0 Capitals win over the Boston Bruins on 10 February 2024, passing Wayne Gretzky for the most all-time. On 9 April, Ovechkin scored his 30th goal of the season on Detroit Red Wings goaltender Alex Lyon for his 18th 30-goal campaign, passing Mike Gartner for most 30-goal seasons in NHL history. He finished the 2023–24 season with 31 goals, 34 assists and 65 points in 79 games played. Ovechkin and the Capitals narrowly got back into the playoffs as the eighth and final seed in the Eastern Conference, however, Ovechkin did not record a single goal or assist as the Capitals were swept in four games by the Presidents&#x27; Trophy-winning New York Rangers in the first round of the 2024 playoffs.

On 15 October 2024, Ovechkin recorded his 700th career assist on a goal by Aliaksei Protas in a 4–2 win over the Vegas Golden Knights, becoming the 60th player in NHL history to reach the mark. On 2 November, he became the fourth player in NHL history 39 years of age or older to record three points in consecutive games (a goal and two assists in a 6–3 win against the Montreal Canadiens on 31 October and a goal and two assists in a 7–2 victory against the Columbus Blue Jackets on 2 November) after Tim Horton (1968–69), Gordie Howe (1968–69) and Jean Ratelle (1980–81). On 18 November, in a 6–2 win over the Utah Hockey Club, Ovechkin sustained a broken fibula as a result of a knee-on-knee collision with Utah forward Jack McBain, sidelining him for four-to-six weeks. At the time of this injury, Ovechkin had a league-leading 15 goals (including two goals earlier in the game against Utah prior to the injury) along with 10 assists for 25 points in the first 18 games of the 2024–25 season. After missing 16 games, Ovechkin returned to the Capitals lineup on 28 December in a 5–2 win over the Toronto Maple Leafs, where he would record an empty-net goal. On January 11, 2025, Ovechkin scored an empty-net goal in a 4–1 win over the Nashville Predators, making him the second player in NHL history to record 20 consecutive 20-goal seasons, after Gordie Howe. On January 16, Ovechkin recorded the lone goal of the game in a 1–0 overtime win against the Ottawa Senators. This goal on Senators goaltender Leevi Meriläinen resulted in Ovechkin surpassing Jaromir Jagr for most goalies scored on in NHL history with 179 different goaltenders since the start of his NHL career in 2005. On 23 February, Ovechkin recorded his 32nd career hat trick in a 7–3 victory against the Edmonton Oilers, making him the first player in NHL history to score 200 or more goals in three different decades (245 goals in the 2000s, a league high 437 goals in the 2010s and 200 in the 2020s).

==Player profile==


Ovechkin is widely considered a generational talent and one of the greatest goal scorers in NHL history and the only active NHL player who stands as having a realistic chance at overtaking Wayne Gretzky in total career goals (894). Gretzky himself has stated he is cheering for Ovechkin to break his record, and when asked about it in April 2019 Gretzky stated he wants to be the first one to shake Ovechkin&#x27;s hand if he were to do so. He is famous for his deadly one-timer, which he typically fires from the left faceoff circle, an area known as his &quot;office.&quot; In August 2006, New York Rangers forward Jaromír Jágr expressed admiration for Ovechkin&#x27;s goal scoring productivity by quoting &quot;All his goals, they are not flukes. Most of the time, he beats guys one-on-one, then you get your highlight&quot;. Teammate Brooks Orpik said of his one-timer: &quot;You know it&#x27;s going there, and you still can&#x27;t stop him.&quot; Ovechkin proves &quot;the exception rather than the rule when it comes to success&quot; on one-timers, which &quot;can be very difficult to pull off,&quot; involving as they do &quot;taking a hard pass and timing a shot perfectly, when the puck may be rolling or on end, while also aiming at a small net, particularly from far distances.&quot; In October 2014, Tampa Bay Lightning captain Steven Stamkos said of Ovechkin’s playing style, &quot;He’s a guy that not only uses his skill set, but his physicality, that’s what sets him apart. He’s willing to go to those areas and has one of the best shots in the league.&quot; In July 2015, Los Angeles Kings goaltender Jonathan Quick quoted Ovechkin&#x27;s powerful shooting skills by saying &quot;Guys like Ovi shoot it so hard that it&#x27;s almost like you&#x27;re a batter in baseball. You see the blur of the puck coming at you in frames.&quot; 

Ovechkin&#x27;s ability to shoot heavily as a power forward has been well documented. After clinching the hardest shot title at the 2018 National Hockey League All-Star Game skills competition with a 98.8 mph first attempt, he became the only player in the 2018 All Star game to break the century mark, surpassing 100 mph on his second shot, stepping &quot;up to plate and delivered a blistering 101.3 MPH blast.&quot;

Ovechkin has been awarded the Hart Memorial Trophy honoring the most valuable player in the league three times (2008, 2009, 2013). Ovechkin&#x27;s most enduring nickname is &quot;The Great 8.&quot;

While Ovechkin has been well known for being a prolific goal-scorer with his powerful shooting skills, he has also been shown to be a proficient passer and setting up goals scored by teammates. On 25 January 2018, when Ovechkin recorded his 500th assist on a Nicklas Bäckström goal in a 4–2 win over the Florida Panthers, then–Capitals head coach Barry Trotz said after the game, &quot;He&#x27;s a legendary player. He&#x27;s getting the points, the goals, the assists. Everybody thinks of Alex as a pure goal-scorer, which he is, and he&#x27;s got to those numbers hundreds of games before other people have reached that number but you always tend to forget he&#x27;s a pretty good playmaker as well.&quot; On 22 October 2018, in a game against the Vancouver Canucks, after Vancouver had pulled their goalie, Ovechkin passed the puck to teammate T. J. Oshie rather than score the easy hat trick for himself since he had scored twice earlier in the game. &quot;[Oshie asked] &#x27;Why did you pass me the puck?&#x27;&quot; Ovechkin said. &quot;But he was so wide open and I try to give him pass. Save mine for next time.&quot; On 9 February 2025, after a 5–4 SO loss to the Utah Hockey Club, a game where Ovechkin was held goalless but recorded three assists, Capitals head coach Spencer Carbery described Ovechkin&#x27;s passing abilities by remarking &quot;Everybody is so focused on his shot when he gets the puck, you’re always thinking shot, shot, shot. But he’s got that look-off pass too, the shot-pass, I call it&quot;.

Ovechkin has also been recognized for showing opposing players respect and admiration for either returning to their team after overcoming hard obstacles off the ice or by their performance on the ice. For example, In a game against the Montreal Canadiens on 19 November 2018, early in to the 2018–19 season, Canadiens goaltender Carey Price made a sprawling stop on Ovechkin’s signature left circle slapshot in the dying seconds of the third period with both teams tied 4–4 and once he covered up the puck he skated over to Price and applauded him for his effort in denying him a hat trick and the game winner. The Capitals would go on to defeat the Canadiens in OT 5–4 with former Canadien Lars Eller scoring the winning goal for the Capitals but if Ovechkin had scored it would’ve been a regulation 5–4 win for the Capitals and a hat trick for Ovechkin himself since he already had two goals earlier in that same game. Also, in a game against the Montreal Canadiens on 16 April 2022, towards the end of the 2021–22 season, Ovechkin showed respect and admiration for Canadiens goaltender Price by giving him a fist bump from across their respective benches during a stoppage of play. The Canadiens game previous day against the New York Islanders was Price’s first game back from a knee injury he sustained the previous summer in the 2021 Stanley Cup Finals against the Tampa Bay Lightning in which Price and the Canadiens lost the series in five games and had multiple setbacks in his recovery that was also followed by a brief stint in the NHL Players Assistance Program to get help with his mental health after coming forward about his struggles from alcohol abuse. When asked about this welcome back gesture in a post-game interview, Ovechkin responded by saying &quot;Obviously, he&#x27;s one of the best players in the league. He was in a tough situation. He&#x27;s a warrior and good for him, his organization, his family and the game of hockey.&quot;

The Capitals&#x27; morning skate ritually begins with Ovechkin &quot;sprinting around the rink, a solo lap to the sound of sticks tapping from his teammates.&quot; Once he&#x27;s made it all the way around, the rest of the team jumps onto the ice to join him. Ovechkin is known as a durable player, losing little time to injuries, illnesses, or suspensions. After being struck on the foot by a teammate&#x27;s wrist shot during an 26 October 2006 practice in Vancouver, he &quot;crumpled to the ice and had to be helped to the locker room.&quot; Exhibiting no ill effects in practice the next day, Ovechkin famously told reporters, &quot;I&#x27;m okay; Russian machine never breaks.&quot;

Late in the 2008–09 season, Ovechkin garnered some criticism over his exuberant after-goal celebrations. On 28 February 2009, during a segment of &quot;Hockey Night in Canada&quot;&#x27;s Coach&#x27;s Corner, Canadian hockey analyst Don Cherry likened Ovechkin&#x27;s celebrations of jumping into the boards and his teammates to that of soccer players, concluding that this was not the Canadian way and advising Canadian kids to ignore Ovechkin&#x27;s example. Then–Capitals head coach Bruce Boudreau came to Ovechkin&#x27;s defence, stating Cherry &quot;doesn&#x27;t know Alex like we know Alex&quot;, and Ovechkin himself stated that he &quot;doesn&#x27;t care&quot; about Cherry. The next notable incident happened on 19 March 2009, in a game against the Tampa Bay Lightning. After scoring his 50th goal of the season, Ovechkin put his stick on the ice, pretending to warm his hands over it because it was &quot;hot.&quot; The incident sparked an immediate response from then-Tampa Bay head coach Rick Tocchet, who said that &quot;[Ovechkin] went down a notch in my books.&quot; Boudreau had also stated that he would discuss the incident with Ovechkin, and then-teammate Mike Green, despite being the first to celebrate with Ovechkin afterwards, commented that he did not wish to join in the pre-meditated celebration. Ovechkin himself was unapologetic, and said about Don Cherry in particular, &quot;He&#x27;s going to be pissed off for sure...I love it!&quot;.

After using and endorsing CCM equipment for most of his career, Ovechkin made the move to Bauer Hockey in August 2011 following a decline in his point production in the 2010–11 season. He continued to use Bauer equipment until the Stanley Cup-winning 2017–18 season, when he switched back to CCM. Ovechkin currently uses the Ribcor Trigger stick and Super Tacks AS1 skates.

==International play==






At the age of 16, Ovechkin played at the 2002 World U-17 Hockey Challenge, where he scored two hat tricks, one against Switzerland and one against the United States, and an assist.

At the age of 17, when he was selected by Russian coach Viktor Tikhonov to play in the Česká Pojišťovna Cup EuroTour tournament, Ovechkin became the youngest skater ever to play for the Russian national team. In that tournament, he also became the youngest player ever to score for the national team. He also was selected to play at the 2002 IIHF World U18 Championships, in which he amassed 14 goals and four assists in eight games, leading Russia to a silver medal. Ovechkin now shares the single tournament goals record with Cole Caufield, who scored as many in seven games at the 2019 IIHF World U18 Championships.

At the age of 18, Ovechkin was named captain of the junior Russian national team. Russia finished fifth in the tournament. In 2003, the team would go on to win a gold medal in the World Junior Championships.

At the age of 19, Ovechkin was named to the Russian national team for the 2004 World Cup of Hockey, making him the youngest player to play in the tournament.

Also at 19, Ovechkin was named captain of the junior team in the 2005 World Junior Ice Hockey Championships. The tournament, lasting from 25 December 2004 to 4 January 2005, was Ovechkin&#x27;s third and last. At the conclusion of the tournament, he had collected seven goals, tied for the tournament lead. His team received the silver medal after losing the gold medal game to Canada on 4 January, and Ovechkin was named the Best Forward of the tournament as well as selected to the tournament All-Star team. In 2005, Ovechkin played in his first IIHF men&#x27;s World Championships. He scored five goals and three assists, landing eighth in the top scorers list and sharing third place in goal scoring.

In 2006, Ovechkin played in his first Winter Olympic Games. Although Russia came away from the games without a medal, Ovechkin scored five goals in the tournament, including the game-winner against Canada&#x27;s Martin Brodeur, eliminating Canada from the tournament. Ovechkin was the only player not on the Swedish (gold medal winners) or Finnish (silver medal winners) teams to be named to the all-tournament team.

At the 2006 IIHF World Championships, Ovechkin scored six goals and three assists (nine points) in seven games before Russia lost 4–3 to the Czech Republic in the quarter-finals. For his efforts, Ovechkin was one of six players selected to the Media All-Star team.

At the 2008 IIHF World Championships, Ovechkin helped lead Russia to the gold medal by finishing with 12 points (six goals, six assists) in nine games. He was selected to the Media All-Star team for the second time in five tournament appearances.
In the 2010 Winter Olympics, Ovechkin and Team Russia were one of the favorites to win the Gold Medal. Despite high expectations, Russia lost to Canada 7–3 in the quarterfinals. Ovechkin finished with two goals and two assists in Russia&#x27;s four games.

After being eliminated in the first round of the NHL playoffs, Ovechkin joined Russia for the 2010 IIHF World Championships along with many other Russian stars, such as Evgeni Malkin, Pavel Datsyuk and Ilya Kovalchuk. Despite being heavily favored to win the tournament, Russia lost to the Czech Republic in the finals.

Ovechkin also joined the Russian team for the 2011 IIHF World Championships after the Capitals were eliminated from the NHL playoffs. He played in five games for the Russian team, but did not manage to score any points, the first time he failed to score any points in a World Championship tournament.

Ovechkin played in Russia&#x27;s last three games of the 2012 IIHF World Championships. He recorded two goals and two assists as Russia won the tournament.

Ovechkin also represented Russia in 2013 IIHF World Championships. He joined the national team after the Capitals were eliminated from the Stanley Cup playoffs in 2013. Russia had already advanced to the first playoff round where they faced the U.S. The Americans defeated Russia 8–3, eliminating them from the tournament.

In the 2014 Winter Olympics, Ovechkin represented Russia under enormous pressure as the tournament was hosted on home ice in Sochi. Russia lost to arch-rivals Finland 3–1 in the quarter-final round.

Ovechkin participated in the 2014 IIHF World Championships where Russia won gold. After the tournament, he asked Vladimir Putin to reward the Russian hockey team on an equal basis with the 2014 Olympic champions. That was criticized as the World Championship was considered insignificant compared to Olympic gold, which Russia had failed to win earlier that year in Sochi. He also joined the Russian team late in the 2015 IIHF World Championships, where Russia won the silver medal.

==Off the ice==
Ovechkin was the cover athlete of 2K Sports hockey simulation video game &quot;NHL 2K10&quot;, as well as the cover athlete of EA Sports&#x27; &quot;NHL 07 and NHL 21&quot;. On 11 June 2008, Ovechkin launched his own line of designer streetwear with CCM. On 6 July 2009, Ovechkin was named an ambassador for the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi, Russia. In late 2009, he was named &quot;GQ&quot;&#x27;s 48th most powerful person in Washington, D.C.

On 4 January 2011, halfway into the 2010–11 season, Ovechkin was featured in one of ESPN&#x27;s &quot;This is SportsCenter&quot; commercials, in which he laughed off a question by ESPN personality Steve Levy accusing him of being a Russian spy before being pulled upward by a line through an open ceiling tile by countryman and then-Capitals teammate Semyon Varlamov.

Ovechkin is a dedicated car enthusiast, owning many fine automobiles, such as a Mercedes-Benz SL65 AMG Black Series and a custom Mercedes S63 AMG. In January 2015, at the 2015 NHL All-Star Game, Ovechkin lobbied Honda for a new car, and brought an element of fun silliness to the &quot;draft&quot; where he was chosen third to last; the last two players selected, Ryan Nugent-Hopkins and Filip Forsberg, each received a new car, but Ovechkin would not give up. When Honda representatives asked his agent why he wanted a car so badly, they were told that he planned to donate it to the American Special Hockey Association, and at the end of the event, he was handed the keys to a new Honda Accord. That Accord was auctioned off, and the proceeds used to benefit the charity Ovechkin highlighted and brought attention to with his antics.

Following the Capitals&#x27; 2018 Stanley Cup victory, Ovechkin participated in a number of memorable celebrations, including an incident on 9 June 2018, two days after the Capitals&#x27; victory, where he and teammates T. J. Oshie, Braden Holtby, Lars Eller and Tom Wilson swam in the fountains at the Georgetown waterfront with the Cup. The summer of 2018 was dubbed by the Washington media as &quot;The Summer of Ovi.&quot;

Ovechkin is a keen football fan and an avid supporter of Liverpool F.C. In May 2021, he was reportedly also an investor in the Washington Spirit, a professional team in the National Women&#x27;s Soccer League, but Sportico reported in June 2022 that he might not have formally completed the process to acquire the stake, and that even if he had, it was unclear whether he retained his stake after the club was sold in February 2022. In June 2022, he signed a one-game contract with FC Dynamo Moscow, the club his father played for, in a friendly against FC Amkal Moscow. He wore the number 3 jersey in honor of his father, who wore the number when he played football for the club. Ovechkin scored a goal in the match.

Ovechkin has appeared in three films: &quot;Zaytsev, zhgi! Istoriya shoumena&quot; (2010) as an actor, and &quot;NHL: Just Like Me&quot; (2008) and &quot;Boys to the Bigs&quot; (2008) as himself.

===Philanthropy===
In 2006, Ovechkin created a program called Ovi&#x27;s Crazy 8&#x27;s, a program through which he purchases and donates eight Capitals season tickets to Most Valuable Kids which allows fans who normally wouldn’t have access to tickets the opportunity to attend Capitals home games. As of 2024, more than 5,700 individuals have had a chance to see a game free of charge through this program.

Since 2014, Ovechkin has been an ambassador for the American Special Hockey Association, a charity which supports individuals with intellectual, developmental and physical disabilities and the mission to give them a chance to learn and grow by playing ice hockey.

===Russian politics===
In January 2017, Ovechkin said: &quot;I have a good relationship with Russians and with Americans. So, I&#x27;m neutral.&quot; In November 2017, Ovechkin started a movement called PutinTeam in support of Russian President Vladimir Putin during the 2018 Russian presidential election. Asked whether it was political, Ovechkin described his actions as a show of support for Russia, &quot;I just support my country, you know? That&#x27;s where I&#x27;m from, my parents live there, all my friends. Like every human from different countries, they support their president. It&#x27;s not about political stuff.&quot; Of his participation in PutinTeam, Ovechkin also said:

PutinTeam was first announced in a 2 November 2017 post on Ovechkin’s Instagram account, which has over one million followers. On 23 November, Ovechkin announced on his Instagram that the group&#x27;s official website had been launched. On the soft launch of the site, visitors were encouraged to sign up for the team, track related news, participate in contests and attend and organize events. Ovechkin has claimed that the idea for PutinTeam was all his and that the group is non-political in its nature. Vedomosti, a Russian financial newspaper, reported that Kremlin sources have said that IMA-Consulting were behind the creation of the organization. A Kremlin-supported public-relations firm, IMA-Consulting reportedly held a $600,000 contract to promote the 2018 Russian presidential elections. The Kremlin spoke in support of the movement after its announcement. According to &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, Ovechkin has a personal relationship with Putin. Ovechkin has a personal phone number for Putin, who is a big hockey fan, and received a gift from Putin at his 2016 wedding. Ovechkin said that he and Putin don&#x27;t have much in common: &quot;We talk about hockey and all that stuff. That&#x27;s it.&quot;

On 25 February 2022, following the Russian invasion of Ukraine, Ovechkin called for peace and no more war without mentioning Russia or Ukraine directly. In May 2022, he reiterated his support for Putin, as well as retaining the Russian president on his Instagram profile photo.

===Feud with Evgeni Malkin===

Ovechkin was involved in a feud with Pittsburgh Penguins forward Evgeni Malkin, who was drafted second behind Ovechkin in the 2004 NHL Entry Draft. Though the two were reported to be good friends when they roomed together during the 2006 Winter Olympics in Turin, Italy, this friendship quickly saw tension arise.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ovechkin/Malkin Feud&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The feud may have started in August 2007 when Ovechkin punched Malkin&#x27;s Russian agent, Gennady Ushakov, at a Moscow nightclub. Ovechkin has denied that version of events, while Malkin has confirmed it. On 21 January 2008, in Pittsburgh, Ovechkin took a run at Malkin, which would have seemingly resulted in a devastating hit had Malkin not ducked out of the way just in time. The two would also not make eye contact at the 2008 NHL Awards Ceremony. Ovechkin has repeatedly denied &quot;having it out&quot; for Malkin. In 2009, in an interview with RT, Ovechkin would confirm that the event in which he punched Malkin&#x27;s agent was true, while also stating &quot;but is okay&quot;.

The feud raised many concerns as to its effect on the league, and the Russian national team at the 2010 Winter Olympics in Vancouver. On 24 January 2009, at the SuperSkills Competition, Malkin assisted Ovechkin in his stunt during the Breakaway Challenge. Malkin handed Ovechkin his props for the stunt as well as handing him his stick and pouring some sports drink down Ovechkin&#x27;s throat. It has been reported that Ilya Kovalchuk, who was then the Atlanta Thrashers&#x27; captain and a teammate of Ovechkin and Malkin on the Russian national team, brokered the peace between the two.

Malkin gave a speech at Ovechkin&#x27;s 35th birthday party in September 2020. The two are reportedly very close friends again, with the feud long in the past.

==Personal life==
Ovechkin was formerly engaged to tennis player Maria Kirilenko. On 21 July 2014, Kirilenko announced that the wedding was called off and that the two were no longer seeing each other. On 11 September 2015, Ovechkin announced his engagement to Nastya Shubskaya, the daughter of Russian actress Vera Glagoleva, whom he subsequently married.

Ovechkin and his wife have two children. In August 2018, the couple had a son, whom they named after Ovechkin&#x27;s late brother. In May 2020, the couple had a second son.

By June 2021, Ovechkin was studying for and close to obtaining a Doctor of Sciences, the Russian equivalent of a PhD or higher doctorate. Ovechkin&#x27;s field of study is Pedagogical Sciences.

<doc id="755751" wikidata="Q301636" url="?curid=755751" title="Pinus koraiensis">
<text>Pinus koraiensis is a species of pine known commonly as the Korean pine. It is a relic species of the Tertiary, identified as a rare tree species by United Nations. It is native to eastern Asia: Korea, northeastern China, Mongolia, the temperate rainforests of the Russian Far East, and central Japan. In the north of its range, it grows at moderate elevations, typically , whereas further south, it is a mountain tree, growing at elevation in Japan. Other common names include Chinese pinenut. The ancient woodland of &quot;P. koraiensis&quot; on the earth is about 50 million hectares, and China has about 30 million hectares, accounting for 60%. It is a second-class national key protected plant in China. &quot;P. koraiensis&quot; is a tree species with high economic and ecological value. The official name in Chinese is &quot;红松 hóng sōng/red pine&quot;, because almost every part of it is related to red.

According to research, &quot;P. koraiensis&quot; can be divided into two natural types according to the thickness of the bark, namely &quot;Pinus koraiensis&quot; Sieb. et Zucc. f. &quot;pachidermis&quot; Wang et Chi and &quot;Pinus koraiensis&quot; Sieb. et Zucc. f. &quot;leptodermis&quot; Wang et Chi.

==Description==
&quot;P. koraiensis&quot; is a member of the white pine group, &quot;Pinus&quot;, section &quot;Quinquefoliae&quot;. Cultivated specimens may grow to about tall, whereas in their native habitat and growing conditions they can reach as much as or even in height. It is pyramidal in shape, with younger specimens having ascending branches and older trees having more horizontal branches that reach ground level. The gray or brownish bark flakes off to reveal reddish inner bark. The sapwood is yellowish white, while the heartwood is light yellowish-brown or light reddish-brown. The branchlets and winter buds are also reddish-brown. The branches are lined with bundles of five blue-green needles, each up to , and bear brown cones up to long.

In Northeast China, a particularly large cone is nearly long and in diameter. The seeds take two years of growth to mature, and the mature seeds do not fall off. The cones release a strong scent that is so irresistible to animals that they help to open the hard cones allowing the seeds to disperse. The nutshells are reddish brown. &quot;P. koraiensis&quot; is monoecious with different flowers. Male cones are reddish-yellow, mostly clustered in the lower part of new branches to form spikes; female cones are green-brown, solitary or in groups near the top of new branches. &quot;P. koraiensis&quot; can live up to 700 years; after 100–200 years of growth, it enters the fruitful youth stage, and after 300–400 years, it enters the fruitful adult stage. The wild &quot;P. koraiensis&quot; grows very slowly, it takes fifty or even eighty years to bear fruit, and the cultivated &quot;P. koraiensis&quot; usually takes more than twenty years to bear fruit, but grafted seedlings can bear fruit within a few years.

==Conservation==
The value of &quot;P. koraiensis&quot; has led to overexploitation of wild populations of the tree, and destruction of the forest ecosystems in which it grows. The Siberian tiger is resident in these pine forests, and preservation of this tree species is one step in the conservation of the tiger.

Other associates of the tree in nature include the spotted nutcracker (&quot;Nucifraga caryocatactes&quot;), which collects the seeds and plays an important role in their dispersal.

In China, the ancient &quot;P. koraiensis&quot; forests are concentrated in the Paektu Mountain and Lesser Khingan areas, and are the building species of the natural forests in the northeast. Except for the pure &quot;P. koraiensis&quot; forests in some areas, most of them are mixed with other coniferous and broad-leaved tree species. The broad-leaved-&quot;P. koraiensis&quot; forest preserves the ancient structural characteristics of the Tertiary plant community. It is a climax community in Northeast China, and its ecological value is extremely precious. It maintains ecological balance and ecological security in Northeast China.
Yichun located in Lesser Khingan has the most typical and best-preserved &quot;P. koraiensis&quot; virgin forest community in Asia. Yichun has two national nature reserves, 丰林/Fenglin and 涼水/Liangshui, which specialize in the protection of &quot;P. koraiensis&quot;. Among them, Fenglin Nature Reserve has been included in the World Network of Biosphere Reserves&quot; by UNESCO. The &quot;P. koraiensis&quot; virgin forest community in Yichun is an important gene pool of China&#x27;s biodiversity. &quot;There are more than 110 kinds of precious coniferous and broad-leaved trees, more than 60 kinds of large mammalian wild animals, and more than 270 kinds of birds, including 64 kinds of national first-class and second-class protected animals; there are 1390 kinds of plants, including more than 700 kinds of wild medicinal materials&quot;. Since 2004, the logging of wild &quot;P. koraiensis&quot; trees has been completely prohibited in Yichun, and the existing &quot;P. koraiensis&quot; trees have been registered one by one for protection.

==Uses==
&quot;P. koraiensis&quot; is a precious tree species with both economic and ecological value. Ecologically, it has the functions of water and soil conservation – its root having a large water storage capacity, which is a &quot;small reservoir&quot; in the eyes of ecologists – and the function of maintaining biodiversity. Economically, every part of the plant can be used. In China, it has a long history of being used in food, beverage, health preservation and medical treatment. The ancients called its fruit &quot;長壽果/longevity fruit&quot;. The traditional Chinese medicine &quot;海松子/sea-pine nut&quot; refers to the seeds of &quot;P. koraiensis&quot;, which is a nourishing and strengthening agent. At present, the high-tech industry of &quot;P. koraiensis&quot; has outstanding achievements in the fields of food, health products, medicine, cosmetics and fine chemicals.

The nuts of this tree are edible and sold commercially. It is the most common taxon sold as pine nuts in markets throughout Europe and the United States. The nut oil contains 11.5% of the unusual fatty acid pinolenic acid (&quot;cis&quot;–5–&quot;cis&quot;–9–&quot;cis&quot;–12 octadecatrienoic acid). It &quot;has a variety of physiological effects such as weight loss, lipid lowering, immune enhancement, anti-inflammation, anti-oxidation, enhancement of insulin sensitivity, and anti-tumor metastasis.&quot; Pine nut oil extracted from &quot;P. koraiensis&quot; nuts has high nutritional value. The oil is also used to make lubricants and soap. The tree is a source of turpentine resin and tannin. The pine needles can be used to extract pine needle oil.

松花粉/Pine pollen is the dried pollen produced by the stamens. It is a traditional Chinese medicine and a traditional Chinese cooking ingredient. It is even used as the name of cakes or drinks, such as &quot;松花糕/pine flower cake&quot;, &quot;松花酒/pine flower wine&quot; etc.
&quot;&quot;中国预防医学科学院营养与食品卫生研究所/The Institute of Nutrition and Food Hygiene of the Chinese Academy of Preventive Medicine&quot; has confirmed that pine pollen contains more than 200 nutritional components and bioactive substances, with anti-fatigue, anti-aging, regulating blood lipids, enhancing immunity, and beautifying five major health care functions&quot;. &quot;&quot;国家体育总局运动医学研究所兴奋剂检测中心/The Doping Testing Center of the Institute of Sports Medicine of China&quot; indicated that no ingredients banned by the Olympic Games were found in pine pollen&quot;.

The Korean pine is used as an ornamental tree. It is tolerant of several soil types and thrives in urban settings. It is adapted to climates with very cold winters. There are several cultivars, including the blue-tinged &#x27;Glauca&#x27; and &#x27;Silveray&#x27; and the wide-bodied &#x27;Winton&#x27;. The Korean pine is also a good tree species for afforestation in Northeast China.

The wood is versatile and very useful for construction. It is light, with straight grains, and easy to work. It is used for a great variety of products, including telephone poles, railroad ties, bridges, boats, plywood and flooring, furniture, sports equipment, and musical instruments. It is easy to break down into chips, particle board, or pulp for paper. The fatwood used to be the best kindling in the forest area of Northeast China, and now it is a rare objet. The carvings or prayer beads made of it are collected or used like precious ancient objects.

<text>Taalib Johnson (born September 16, 1977), better known by his stage name Musiq Soulchild (or simply Musiq; pronounced &quot;music&quot;) is an American singer-songwriter. His music blends R&amp;B, funk, blues, jazz, and gospel influences fused with hip hop.

He signed with Def Soul to release his debut studio album, &quot;Aijuswanaseing&quot; (2000). It moderately entered the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, while his second album, &quot;Juslisen&quot; (2002), peaked atop the chart and spawned the single &quot;Halfcrazy&quot;, his highest entry—at number 16—on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. He released third album, &quot;Soulstar&quot; (2003), before parting ways with the label in favor of Atlantic Records. The label released his fourth album, &quot;Luvanmusiq&quot; (2007), which peaked atop the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 once more.

==Early life==
Musiq was born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, and raised in a strict Muslim household. During his teenage years he built a reputation for being musically gifted, beat boxing for MCs freestyling on the open mic circuit, scatting at jazz clubs, or just performing an a cappella for strangers on the streets, which is where he got the name &quot;Musiq&quot; and later added &quot;Soulchild.&quot; He cites as his inspirations such icons as Marvin Gaye, Stevie Wonder, and Donny Hathaway. He dropped out of high school to pursue a career in music.

==Career==

===1998–2004: Def Soul===
In 1998, Musiq Soulchild signed with Def Soul Records, the contemporary R&amp;B division of Universal Music&#x27;s Def Jam Recordings. He later released his debut album, &quot;Aijuswanaseing&quot;, in late 2000. Its lead single was &quot;Just Friends (Sunny)&quot;. His second single &quot;Love&quot; spent 22 weeks on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 charts.

Musiq&#x27;s second album, 2002&#x27;s &quot;Juslisen&quot;, debuted at number one on both the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 and R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Albums, reaching platinum-sales status. The singles were &quot;Halfcrazy&quot; and &quot;Dontchange&quot;, which were top ten hits.

In 2003, Musiq released his third album, &quot;Soulstar&quot;, which went gold. It included the singles &quot;Forthenight&quot; and &quot;Whoknows&quot;.

Musiq took a four-year break and changed his management to Solqi Management. In 2006, media outlets circulated that Musiq was involved in a &quot;de facto&quot; record label trade, transitioning from Def Soul&#x27;s master label Def Jam Recordings to Atlantic Records, and sending rapper Fabolous from Atlantic to Def Jam.

===2006–2012: Atlantic Records===
In March 2007, Musiq&#x27;s released his fourth album &quot;Luvanmusiq&quot;. Its singles were &quot;B.U.D.D.Y.&quot;, an uptempo track, &quot;Teachme&quot;, and &quot;Makeyouhappy.&quot;

His fifth album &quot;OnMyRadio&quot; was released on December 2, 2008. The lead single &quot;Radio&quot; was a complete contrast to the usual smooth neo soul Musiq fans were accustomed to. The following singles were the duet &quot;IfULeave&quot; featuring Mary J. Blige, and the ballad &quot;SoBeautiful&quot;. The latter marked the first collaboration between Musiq and producer JR Hutson, after Hutson had spent &quot;about eight months&quot; trying to get Musiq to come by his studio. According to Hutson, the two planned to work together again.

In May 2010, he changed management to Victor Grieg.

His last album for Atlantic &quot;MusiqInTheMagiq&quot; was released on May 3, 2011, available on CDs and also as a digital download. The first single was &quot;Anything&quot; featuring Swizz Beatz, followed by &quot;Yes&quot;.

===2013–present My Block Records, Soulstar Music Company, eOne Records===
In September 2013, Musiq released a duet album with Syleena Johnson, titled &quot;9ine&quot;. This album was a compilation of nine reggae songs recorded in nine days on the independent Shanachie label.

Also in September 2013, Musiq announced his departure from Atlantic Records and becoming an independent artist. He revealed he is now signed to record producer Warryn Campbell&#x27;s label My Block Records.

<doc id="755755" wikidata="Q371104" url="?curid=755755" title="Patrick Lucey">
<text>Patrick Joseph Lucey (March 21, 1918 – May 10, 2014) was an American politician. A member of the Democratic Party, he served as the 38th Governor of Wisconsin from 1971 to 1977. He was also independent presidential candidate John B. Anderson&#x27;s running mate in the 1980 presidential election.

Born in La Crosse, Wisconsin, Lucey served in state and local government offices after graduating from the University of Wisconsin. He served in the Quartermaster Corps of the United States Army during World War II. He held the position of Lieutenant Governor of Wisconsin from 1965 to 1967 and unsuccessfully challenged Governor Warren P. Knowles in the 1966 gubernatorial election.

Lucey won the 1970 Wisconsin gubernatorial election and served as governor until 1977, when he accepted President Jimmy Carter&#x27;s appointment to the position of United States Ambassador to Mexico. As governor, Lucey presided over the merger of the Wisconsin State University system and the University of Wisconsin System. In 1980, he agreed to serve as the running mate to John B. Anderson, a former Republican congressman running an independent campaign. The ticket of Anderson and Lucey won 6.6% of the popular vote in the 1980 election, which saw Carter unseated by Republican nominee Ronald Reagan.

==Early life and education==
Lucey was born in La Crosse, Wisconsin, on March 21, 1918, the son of Ella (McNamara) and Gregory Lucey. He grew up in the village of Ferryville, Wisconsin, and graduated from Campion High School in nearby Prairie du Chien, Wisconsin, in 1935. He later attended St. Thomas College in Saint Paul, Minnesota. During World War II Lucey was drafted and served in the United States Army Quartermaster Corps in the Caribbean until he was discharged with the rank of captain in 1945. After the war, Lucey graduated from the University of Wisconsin in 1946 with a B.A. in philosophy.

==Political career==

Lucey served as justice of the peace in Ferryville, Wisconsin, in 1946. He also served on the De Soto School Board and was board treasurer in 1946. Lucey served in the Wisconsin State Assembly from 1949 to 1951. From 1957 to 1963 he served as state chairman of the Democratic Party. Lucey was a Wisconsin campaign aide of John F. Kennedy in his presidential run in 1960.

In 1964, Lucey was elected Lieutenant Governor of Wisconsin and served one term from 1965 to 1967. At this time the governor and lieutenant governor of Wisconsin were elected on separate tickets, and voters chose Lucey, a Democrat, as lieutenant governor while simultaneously electing Republican Warren P. Knowles as governor (An amendment to the Wisconsin Constitution in 1967 combined elections for governor and lieutenant governor onto a single ticket).

Lucey ran as the Democratic candidate for governor of Wisconsin in 1966 but failed to unseat incumbent Warren Knowles. He was initially a supporter of Senator Robert F. Kennedy in his 1968 presidential bid, but began working for Senator Eugene McCarthy&#x27;s presidential campaign following Kennedy&#x27;s assassination. He was the acting director of the McCarthy campaign at the 1968 Democratic National Convention. In 1970, Lucey campaigned again for governor and was elected with 54 percent of the vote. Lucey was the first Wisconsin governor elected to a four-year term after a 1967 amendment to the state constitution extended terms from two years to four. He took office on January 4, 1971. Lucey ran successfully for a second term as governor in 1974, and served until his resignation on July 6, 1977, to accept a nomination as United States Ambassador to Mexico.

One of Lucey&#x27;s executive initiatives was to revive an idea to merge the state&#x27;s two university systems, the Wisconsin State University (WSU) system and the University of Wisconsin System, with campuses at Madison, Milwaukee, Green Bay, and Parkside (Racine–Kenosha), as well as the University of Wisconsin–Extension. The idea was suggested in the 1940s and 1950s by Governors Oscar Rennebohm and Walter J. Kohler, Jr.

In 1971, Lucey raised the issue again, saying a merger would contain the growing costs of two systems; give order to the increasing higher education demands of the state; control program duplication; and provide for a united voice and single UW budget. Madison faculty and administrators by and large opposed the merger, fearing it would diminish the great state university. Most WSU faculty and administrators favored the merger, believing it would add prestige to their institutions and level the playing field for state funding.

Merger legislation easily passed the Democratic-controlled Assembly. After much maneuvering and lobbying, it was approved by a one-vote margin in the Republican-controlled Senate. It took until 1974 for implementation legislation to be finalized. &quot;I had to be pretty heavy-handedno merger, no budget&quot;, said Lucey in an interview following his term in office.

==Other gubernatorial accomplishments==
Lucey also recommended additional funding for tourism, which spurred development throughout the state. Two examples were the expansion of the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources park system and the Mt. Telemark Resort in Cable, Wisconsin. Since 1974, Cable and Mt. Telemark host the American Birkebeiner each year, the largest cross-country ski race in North America. He appointed a number of task forces to address minority concerns, including the Governor&#x27;s Investigating Committee on Problems of Wisconsin&#x27;s Spanish Speaking Communities, which identified the lack of programs to address the Mexican American and Puerto Ricans&#x27; lack of access to education, health, housing, and work across the state. At a time when there were over 30,000 Mexican Americans living in Wisconsin, with half living in Milwaukee, less than 10 Mexican Americans were enrolled at UW-Milwaukee.

==1980 vice presidential campaign==
The John Anderson–Patrick Lucey presidential ticket received 5,719,437 votes for 6.6 percent of the total vote in the 1980 presidential election, despite a 25% showing in early polls by Anderson and a spirited televised debate between Anderson and Ronald Reagan.

==2011 Wisconsin Supreme Court election==
In 2011, Lucey, although a Democrat, acted as David Prosser&#x27;s campaign co-chairman. On March 31, 2011, he resigned from Prosser&#x27;s campaign and endorsed JoAnne Kloppenburg, attributing his decision to Prosser&#x27;s &quot;disturbing distemper and lack of civility&quot;, while praising Kloppenburg for &quot;[adhering] throughout the campaign to even-handedness and non-partisanship and [exhibiting] both promising judicial temperament and good grace, even in the heat of a fierce campaign.&quot;

==Death==
Lucey died on May 10, 2014, in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, at the age of 96.

==Legacy==
In September 2009, Lucey was honored with a Wisconsin Historical Society marker in Ferryville. In October 2013, Wisconsin Highway 35 between Ferryville and Prairie du Chien was renamed the &quot;Governor Patrick Lucey Highway&quot; in his honor. Lucey also had a biography written about his time in politics.

<text>Ludvonga II (c. 1855 – 1872) was the Crown Prince of Swaziland, son of Mswati II of Swaziland. His mother&#x27;s clan was Khumalo. As a result of internal power struggles within the royal family, he was poisoned and died in 1872 before he could take the throne. He was succeeded by his half-brother Mbandzeni, who was adopted by Ludvonga&#x27;s mother.

<text>William Stein Newman (April 6, 1912 – April 27, 2000) was an American musicologist.

He was born in Cleveland, Ohio. From 1945 he taught at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. He is best remembered for his three volume &quot;History of the Sonata Idea&quot;, a study of the term &quot;sonata&quot; comprising &quot;The Sonata in the Baroque Era&quot;, &quot;The Sonata in the Classical Era&quot; and &quot;The Sonata Since Beethoven&quot;. He also wrote on performance practice.

His textbook &quot;Understanding Music&quot; is perhaps the most thoroughgoing text on music appreciation in the English language.

Newman was initiated as an honorary member of Phi Mu Alpha Sinfonia by the Alpha Rho chapter in May 1963.

Newman died in Chapel Hill, North Carolina.

Philip F. Gura, a professor at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, is the William S. Newman Distinguished Professor of American Literature and Culture. A concert series at UNC-Chapel Hill is named in his honor.

His intense interests extended from pugilism (specifically, boxing), to hands-on involvement with sports cars, and, of course, the Chopin Études and the Beethoven Sonatas. Pianists should read his &quot;The Pianist&#x27;s Problems&quot;.</text><links>

<doc id="755791" wikidata="Q512593" url="?curid=755791" title="Tutush I">
<text>Abu Sa&#x27;id Taj al-Dawla Tutush (; died 25 February 1095) or Tutush I, was the Seljuk emir of Damascus from 1078 to 1092, and sultan of Damascus from 1092 to 1094.

==Years under Malik Shah==
Tutush was a brother of the Seljuk sultan Malik-Shah I. In 1077, Malik-Shah appointed him to take over the governorship of Syria. Later that year, Tutush reached Aleppo, then ruled by the Mirdasid emir Sabiq ibn Mahmud, and began a three-month-long siege of the city.

In 1078/9, Malik-Shah sent him to Damascus to help Atsiz ibn Uvaq, an independent Turkish warlord who had taken the city in 1076, who was being besieged by the Fatimid forces. After the siege had ended, Tutush had Atsiz executed and installed himself in Damascus. He later expanded his realm by annexing Sidon, Gibelacar, Tiberias, Ramla, Jaffa and Jerusalem, which he granted to Artuk Bey, another Seljuk commander. He later returned to besieging Aleppo and called for reinforcements from Malik-Shah, yet his reinforcements were ambushed and routed by a coalition of Arab tribesmen led by Kilabi chief Abu Za&#x27;ida at Wadi Butnan. This forced him to leave Aleppo and to pursue the tribesmen who fled into the desert. Meanwhile, the Aleppines raided Tutush&#x27;s camp outside the city walls, killing the guards he left behind and seizing all of its provisions. Tutush consequently withdrew to Diyar Bakr where he spent the winter. In 1080, Tutush determined to capture Aleppo by force, in which he wanted to strip it from its nearby defenses; hence, he seized Manbij, Hisn al-Faya (at modern-day al-Bira), Biza&#x27;a and Azaz. He later influenced Sabiq to cede the emirate to the Uqaylid emir Muslim ibn Quraysh &quot;Sharaf al-Dawla&quot;.

The headman in Aleppo, Sharif Hassan ibn Hibat Allah Al-Hutayti, currently under siege by Suleiman ibn Qutalmish, promised to surrender the city to Tutush. Suleiman was a distant member of the Seljuk dynasty who had established himself in Anatolia and was trying to expand his rule to Aleppo, having captured Antioch in 1084. Tutush and his army met Suleiman&#x27;s forces near Aleppo in 1086. In the ensuing battle of Ain Salm, Suleiman&#x27;s forces fled, Suleiman was killed and his son Kilic Arslan captured. Tutush attacked and occupied Aleppo except for the citadel in May 1086, he stayed until October and left for Damascus due to the advance of Malik-Shah&#x27;s armies. The Sultan himself arrived in December 1086, then he appointed Aq Sunqur al-Hajib as the governor of Aleppo. Tutush finished the construction of the Citadel of Damascus, a project begun under the direction of Atsiz.

==Struggle for Sultanate==
Tutush took control of Syria in 1092, following the death of his brother, Malik-Shah, naming himself sultan. He marched towards Upper Mesopotamia, in which he managed to capture Nisbis, Amida, Mayyafariqin and Mosul, but he had to return in December 1093, as two Seljuk rulers, Bozan of Edessa and Harran and Aq Sunqur al-Hajib of Aleppo, had switched allegiance and declared their support for his nephew, Sultan Berkyaruq. However, Tutush along with Yağısıyan of Antioch launched an attack against the dissidents, whom he managed to defeat at Tell Sultan in June–July 1094. Bozan and Aq Sunqur were killed, meanwhile Kerbogha was taken prisoner to Homs.

Tutush, along with his general the Kakuyid Ali ibn Faramurz, headed east until he reached Hamadan, where Berkyaruq had withdrawn to Isfahan. However, Tutush was shortly defeated in a battle against Berkyaruq&#x27;s forces near Ray, where he and Ali were killed on 25 February 1095. Tutush was decapitated and his head was displayed in Baghdad.

Tutush&#x27;s younger son Duqaq then inherited Damascus, whilst Ridwan received Aleppo, splitting their father&#x27;s realm. His youngest son Irtash was briefly ruler of Damascus in 1104.

<text>This toponymical list of counties of the United Kingdom is a list of the origins of the names of counties of the United Kingdom. For England and Wales it includes ancient and contemporary ceremonial counties, but excludes those English unitary authorities that are not ceremonial counties.

==Background==

Throughout the histories of the four countries of the United Kingdom, a variety of languages have been used to name places. These languages were often used in parallel with each other. As a result, it is often difficult to assess the genuine etymology of a placename, hence some of the entries below are assigned more than one meaning, depending on which language was used to originally give the place its name. One of the most common words used in county names in the United Kingdom is the suffix &quot;shire&quot;. This is a West Saxon word meaning &quot;share/division&quot;.

<doc id="755801" wikidata="Q7337865" url="?curid=755801" title="River Tavy">
<text>The Tavy () is a river on Dartmoor, Devon, England. The name derives from the Brythonic root &quot;Tam&quot;, once thought to mean &#x27;dark&#x27; but now generally understood to mean &#x27;to flow&#x27;. It has given its name to the town of Tavistock and the villages of Mary Tavy and Peter Tavy.

It is a tributary of the River Tamar and has as its own tributaries: Collybrooke, River Burn, River Wallabrooke, River Lumburn, and River Walkham. At Tavistock it feeds a canal running to Morwellham Quay.

Its mouth is crossed by the Tavy Bridge which carries the Tamar Valley railway line.

==Navigation==

The river is navigable inland as far as Lopwell, where a weir marks the normal tidal limit, about a journey from North Corner Quay at Devonport. River transport was an important feature of the local farming, mining, tourism and forestry economies.

The Queen&#x27;s Harbour Master for Plymouth is responsible for managing navigation on the River Tavy up to the normal tidal limit.

<text>River Walkham is a river whose source is on Dartmoor, Devon, England. 

It rises in the wide gap between Roos Tor and Great Mis Tor and flows almost due south for approximately leaving the tors and thus National Park behind then south-west for past Woodtown. The river then reaches a village, Horrabridge, with a small compact network of streets mainly on the south or left bank. It receives most of its tributaries which are unnamed headwaters along its south-flowing inception, draining the near side of two series of six tors (peaks) to the west ending in Pew Tor at 320 metres and likewise to the east ending in Leeden Tor at 389 metres (above mean sea level). In absolute distance, west of the village and the same south of the small well-preserved town of Tavistock by a footbridge on the West Devon Way the Walkham joins the Tavy which discharges into the Tamar Estuary north of the Plymouth conurbation after a fast descent around wide hillsides, a few miles south.
The confluence of the Walkham and Tavy is a few hundred metres downstream from the Tavistock Canal a mainly closed canal with many mining heritage centres, leading to the Tavy&#x27;s near-neighbour, the River Tamar.

== In popular culture ==
Television presenter Angela Rippon wrote in her book about the West Country that the River Walkham was &quot;one of the loveliest rivers in Devon&quot;.

<doc id="755804" wikidata="Q622698" url="?curid=755804" title="Aq Sunqur al-Hajib">
<text>Abu Said Aq Sunqur al-Hajib (full name: &quot;Qasim ad-Dawla Aksungur al-Hajib&quot;) was the Seljuk governor of Aleppo under Sultan Malik Shah I. He was beheaded in 1094 following accusations of treason by Tutush I, the ruler of Damascus.

Aq-Sunqur was the father of Imad ad-Din Zengi, the founder of the Zengid dynasty. 

==Biography==
===Governor of Aleppo===
Aq Sunqur was one of the Türkmen begs that were assigned in 1084 by Sultan Malik-Shah I to aid Fakhr ad-Dawla ibn Jahir in the capture of the Uqaylid realm. Malik-Shah then made Aq-Sunqur the governor of Aleppo in 1086. 

Aq Sunqur subsequently ruled for eight years. Because of the many conflicts between the rulers and princes of the regions, conditions within the city were difficult. A combination of high taxes and goods prices led to an increase in crime.

Aq-Sunqur began reforming by fixing the security situation in Aleppo and its environs. He activated the Hudud in Islam, repelling thieves and bandits and stamping out corruption. He increased the use of the police to secure civilian rights. He used the police authority to protect people rather than to control them. Aq-Sunqur created the &quot;principle of collective responsibility&quot; for every village or sector, which meant that if a village was raided by thieves, the whole village shared the responsibility of defending it.

Because of his policy to make order in the city, it became a suitable place for trading and farming, the economy recovered and inflation went down. He asked the people to not remove their goods from the road should they travel, stating that he would guarantee that their goods would not be stolen.

===Conflict with Tutush and death===
In 1089, Aq Sunqur was sent together with Bozan and Yağısıyan by Malik Shah to aid his brother Tutush to capture cities that the Fatimids had reconquered under Badr al-Jamali. However, the coalition fell apart when Aq Sunqur refused to continue the siege of Tripoli after he had been bribed and claimed the city had proclaimed allegiance. 

After the death of Malik Shah, Tutush tried to become Sultan himself and Aq Sunqur first supported his bid until he and Bozan defected again, forcing Tutush to withdraw. In return, Tutush marched on Aq Sunqur in March/April together with Yağısıyan. Aq Sunqur was defeated and captured in battle on 27 May 1094 after a part of his Türkmen defected. Aq Sunqur was then decapitated together with fourteen others by Tutush. He died when his son Zengi was 10 years old.

== Legacy ==
Ibn al-Qalanisi said in his book &quot;The history of Damascus&quot;: that he was just with the people, he protected the roads, guaranteed order, treated religion properly, attacked corruption and removed the bad people.

Ibn Kathir and Ali ibn al-Athir wrote about him and found that he had a good reputation.

<doc id="755809" wikidata="Q554237" url="?curid=755809" title="Chris Duhon">
<text>Christopher Nicholas Duhon (born August 31, 1982) is an American former professional basketball player. Duhon was a point guard for the Duke Blue Devils men&#x27;s basketball team from 2000 to 2004. He then played for the Chicago Bulls, New York Knicks, Orlando Magic, and Los Angeles Lakers.

==College career==
In his senior year at Salmen High School in Slidell, Louisiana, Duhon was voted Mr. Basketball for the state of Louisiana, made the McDonald&#x27;s All-American Team, and won the McDonald&#x27;s Three Point Shootout.

Duhon arrived at Duke in 2000, where he was an important role player, playing backup to point guard Jason Williams. Following the injury of teammate Carlos Boozer, Duhon was placed into the starting lineup as point guard, with Williams moving to shooting guard, a combination in which Duhon played well. The Duke Blue Devils went on to win the 2001 national championship, defeating Arizona in the finals.

His sophomore season, Duhon again started in the Duke backcourt alongside fellow guard Jason Williams. That season, Duhon&#x27;s reputation grew for his defense, court vision, and versatility as a point guard, averaging 2.3 steals per game, and 5.9 assists per game.

From his junior season on, Duhon became an instrumental leader for the Blue Devils. In the 2002–2003 season, he led a young Duke team to the Sweet 16, and averaged 9.2 points, 6.4 assists, and 2.2 steals per game and was among the top 10 assists leaders in NCAA Division I history.

In his senior season, Duhon averaged 10 points, 6 assists, 2.2 steals, and 4.1 rebounds per game, en route to another Final Four.

Duhon finished his career as Duke&#x27;s all-time leader in steals (300) and minutes played (4,813), and second in assists (819). He had one of Duke&#x27;s top assists to turnover ratios as well. In Duhon&#x27;s four years, Duke compiled a 123–21 record, making Duhon the second winningest player in Duke and Atlantic Coast Conference history, behind Duke&#x27;s Shane Battier (131 wins). He helped the Blue Devils win three ACC Championships. Duhon was a finalist for the 2004 Wooden Award, the Naismith Award, and Rupp Trophy awards. He left as the only Atlantic Coast Conference player to record 1,200 points, 800 assists, 475 rebounds, 300 steals, and 125 three-point shots.

==NBA career==
===Chicago Bulls (2004–2008)===

In June 2004, Duhon was selected as the 38th pick in the 2004 NBA draft by the Chicago Bulls. In his rookie season with the Bulls, Duhon played in all 82 games, averaging 5.9 points and 4.9 assists per game. Duhon&#x27;s best game in his rookie year was against the Atlanta Hawks. Duhon led the Bulls in a comeback against the Hawks, where they trailed at the half. Duhon hit 8 of 9 three-point field-goals in the game, scoring 24 points. This was a franchise record before Ben Gordon, a fellow 2004 draft pick, hit nine threes the following season. The Bulls re-signed Duhon after matching an offer from the Toronto Raptors for the 2005–06 season. In the 2005–2006 season, Duhon averaged 8.7 points per game and 5.0 assists per game.

In 2005, after Hurricane Katrina, Duhon&#x27;s Stand Tall Foundation handed out over 3,000 boxes of supplies worth $450,000 for residents of his hometown Slidell.

Duhon played a key role in the Bulls winning their first playoff series since the Michael Jordan era against the Miami Heat. The Bulls swept the Heat four games to zero. Duhon provided key minutes as the sixth man in the series against Miami, where he played more minutes because of the foul trouble Kirk Hinrich was plagued with throughout the series.

After the Bulls fell in a 3–0 hole, a deficit no team has come back from in the NBA Playoffs, Duhon played solidly off the bench. He hit a key three-pointer in Game 4 that forced the lead to 23 points. In a relatively easy Game 5 win, Duhon scored 8 points off of 2 threes and a driving lay-up.

The trade of Ben Wallace and Joe Smith to the Cleveland Cavaliers for Larry Hughes and Drew Gooden also caused a logjam in the backcourt. He eventually found his way back into the rotation and once again proved to be a solid floor general. In a game against the Golden State Warriors on February 7, 2008, Duhon scored a career-high 34 points along with 9 assists, 3 steals, 2 rebounds, and 4 three-pointers. Duhon&#x27;s contract expired June 30, 2008.

===New York Knicks (2008–2010)===
On July 4, 2008, Duhon accepted a two-year deal worth close to $12 million total to play for the New York Knicks. Though his other suitor, the Orlando Magic, were considered a team more championship-built, he would have been a backup to Jameer Nelson. With the Knicks, he was considered a possible replacement to Stephon Marbury, whose contract with the Knicks was bought out later that season.

On November 29, 2008, in a game against the Golden State Warriors, Duhon set a new Knicks single-game record with 22 assists in one game.

===Orlando Magic (2010–2012)===
On July 8, 2010, Duhon signed a four-year deal worth a guaranteed $12 million with the Orlando Magic.

===Los Angeles Lakers (2012–2013)===
On August 10, 2012, Duhon was traded to the Los Angeles Lakers along with teammates Dwight Howard and Earl Clark as part of a four-team deal. On June 29, 2013, Duhon was waived by the Lakers.

==Coaching career==
In April 2014, Duhon was hired by first-year head coach Dan D&#x27;Antoni as an assistant coach at Marshall. D&#x27;Antoni previously coached him as an assistant in New York and Los Angeles. After his 2015 aggravated DUI arrest, Marshall University&#x27;s athletic department issued a statement saying Duhon has been suspended for a violation of department rules and policies. On January 24, 2017, Duhon resigned from Marshall following an arrest for driving on a revoked license three days earlier.

In 2023, Duhon was hired as head coach for the Gaston Christian School boys&#x27; basketball team.
